1
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:26,283
Excuse me, will you
take me to Malvani?

2
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,293
Have you gone crazy?

3
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,558
Go take the Taxi and burn it.
- Don't go if you don't want to.

4
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,892
Why are you getting angry?
- l'm getting angry?

5
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:33,559
Don't you know what's
going on in the city?

6
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,294
Fool.

7
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:46,904
Excuse me.

8
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,242
You're going to Malvani now?

9
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,373
lt's not safe there.

10
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,650
Here, have a drink.
- No.

11
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,248
Have a little?
- No.

12
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:00,384
What the...

13
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,324
Show me your licence.

14
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,470
Back it up. Park it behind.

15
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,622
Hey, who is that?

16
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:33,750
Stop.

17
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:35,352
Suryakant Sarang.

18
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,291
Why are you here?

19
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:38,822
l live in Malvani, sir.

20
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,891
Sector 4, behind the old compound.

21
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,895
Who are you? King Kong?

22
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,300
Throw him in the van.

23
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,300
Farooque sir knows me.

24
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:47,897
So? Should l welcome you?

25
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,969
Farooque sir isn't
on duty today, now?

26
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,307
He is, sir. l just
heard him on the wireless.

27
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,304
Of course! He's here to protect

28
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,905
....his community
from being massacred.

29
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,040
Rubbish.

30
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,979
You police officers
are talking like fools.

31
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:03,721
The report doesn't
match the logbook at all.

32
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,321
Sir, everything happened so quickly
that we didn't get the time.

33
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,517
You didn't get the time?

34
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,319
Tell me, why is the time
of the police firing...

35
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,387
...different in the
logbook and the report?

36
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,329
Those who've been
taken into custody...

37
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,595
...their statements have
been taken but not recorded.

38
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,594
Sir, you would've got
the entire report tomorrow.

39
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:19,730
Shut up.
- Sorry, sir.

40
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,864
Sir, a Suryakant Sarang...

41
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,068
...was trying to enter
into Malvani through Charkop.

42
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:24,605
Says that he knows you.

43
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,341
Last evening l met the
12 Mohalla committees...

44
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:31,350
...the trustees of the
three temples, and the priests.

45
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,476
There was no tension.

46
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:33,610
There wasn't even a
hint of any such thing.

47
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,081
And suddenly this afternoon,
Malvani was under curfew.

48
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,414
The Minar was broken.

49
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:39,416
Stones were pelted behind Sector 4.

50
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,751
A Bus set ablaze. A Taxi burnt.

51
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,425
Police firing.

52
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,828
l don't understand who
is instigating all this.

53
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:47,092
And now, anything can happen anytime.

54
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,893
One stray shriek, one stone,

55
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,503
One fanatic. Just one.

56
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:52,696
And everything will be over.

57
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,566
Sir, l have no news from home.

58
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,434
lf l could go to Malvani...
- As soon as the curfew...

59
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,444
...is released, the police
vehicle will drop you there.

60
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:13,115
There are 90% Muslims, and
just 10% Hindus in Malvani.

61
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,394
And, most of the Hindus stay...

62
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:17,521
...in Sector 1 and 4.

63
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,400
Kadam was saying that the
burning of the police post...

64
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,060
a Hindu mob was responsible.

65
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,405
And you say that...
you recognised a few...

66
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,408
...Muslims among them.

67
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,005
So, the people who were
killed in the taxi, they were?...

68
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,863
lf we waste time thinking,
they'll think we're cowards.

69
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,525
Don't worry.

70
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,193
Hey.

71
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:33,530
Don't be scared.

72
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:34,664
Hail Lord Ram!

73
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,003
Hail Lord Ram!

74
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,487
Surya, what are you doing here?

75
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,083
Your family too has been attacked.

76
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,550
We won't spare any of them.

77
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,224
Don't worry, come on.

78
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:15,572
'Second.'

79
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,716
'We always have play second.'

80
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,043
'Life always plays first.'

81
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,578
'lt always takes the break.'

82
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:23,517
'And then comes our turn.'

83
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:25,919
'One who survives till
the end, is the winner.'

84
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,853
l won't tell Papa, l swear on Ma.

85
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,855
That means you'll tell Ma?
- No. l swear on Papa.

86
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,589
Come on.

87
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,131
Your Master lost the
last time as well.

88
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,261
Hey.

89
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,937
Hey Chandra, how are you?

90
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,665
Has Master started his
gun-machine yet? - There's still time.

91
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,008
Smallie?
- He's my brother.

92
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:46,540
He'll just be quite and watch.

93
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,144
You'll be quiet, won't you?
- Yes.

94
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:49,674
Really? Go on.

95
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:03,819
'Four pockets, 18 coins,
1 queen and 2 strikers.'

96
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,095
'That's all there is
to game, in one way.'

97
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,632
'But there's more to
the game than that.'

98
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,231
'The players'.

99
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,569
'The gamblers'.

100
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,840
'And those like me,
who just stare in awe.'

101
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:19,636
'Everyone would come.'

102
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,640
'Great players frequented that joint.'

103
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,982
'l recognised Master
in a immediately.'

104
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:31,655
'He didn't talk much...'

105
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,917
'...his striker
would talk to the coins.'

106
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,224
Surya this car has
come to your house.

107
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,350
Uncle, please open the door.

108
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,820
Uncle, please open the door.
- Surya, come.

109
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,691
l don't see any way.

110
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,230
Can you think of anything?

111
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,827
You don't understand.
- l don't understand...?

112
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,637
l suggest that we both set out,
with a bowl in hand.

113
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,902
We'll wander around in
the streets, and beg.

114
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,777
And, we'll definitely
mange something.

115
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,643
Sister-in-law, please explain to him.
Please explain.

116
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,649
Have your tea, it's getting cold.
- What tea?

117
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:31,775
But, where will we go?

118
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:34,114
We've been settled here for so long.

119
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,651
lt's not about this...
- This is just an advance.

120
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:37,781
Listen...
- Listen to me.

121
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,654
l'm not sending you
empty-handed from here.

122
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,991
Go to Malvani,
you'll find a bigger house.

123
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,390
Plus you'll save some money
for your daughter's wedding.

124
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,857
l'll give you more money.

125
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:52,930
'The eldest, was Rajni.'

126
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:54,731
'Then Chandra.'

127
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,672
'Then, Devi. And l was the youngest.'

128
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,139
Surya, come here.

129
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,270
'Brother and sister
would go till Dadar...'

130
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,404
'...for the Ganesh immersion.'

131
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,748
'But, Devi and l had never
stepped out of Nagpada.'

132
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,144
'That day we realised
how big Mumbai was.'

133
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,355
'We were thrown from one
corner of the city, to another.'

134
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,693
'lt seemed like
between the two corners...'

135
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,753
'...there was a
third city... Malvani.'

136
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,828
'Malvani was filled
with all kinds of noises.'

137
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,429
'And strange silences.'

138
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,902
'Amidst all the chaos
one thing was certain...'

139
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,971
'...someone would
surely be tricked everyday.'

140
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,103
What's going on up ahead?

141
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:37,714
Some fraudster sold the same
shop to two buyers and fled.

142
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:42,380
Your benevolence is unique, God.

143
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:47,256
Your benevolence is unique, God.

144
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:49,727
Unique is my devotion, Lord.

145
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:52,060
Your benevolence is unique, God.

146
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,723
The cradle of life...

147
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,928
...swings with the pace of time.

148
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:16,821
The heart keeps beating.

149
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:21,820
Numerous thoughts cross my heart.

150
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:26,488
Thousands of
questions crowd my mind.

151
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:32,102
Why did you make each day a mystery?

152
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:42,445
Lord. Lord. Lord.

153
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,848
Write Rs.26.
- Ma. Here.

154
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,112
You took so long.

155
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,116
What did you write?
- Yes?

156
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,521
Did you write 26?
- Yes, l did.

157
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,454
Wow.

158
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,526
Your brother plays really well.

159
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,857
lt was great.

160
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,127
Would you like to play one more?

161
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,797
Why one? Let's play ten.

162
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,464
Will you bet a rupee?
- Fine.

163
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,801
Okay.

164
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,274
Brother, the money...
- lf winning is definite,

165
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,010
How does it matter if there is...

166
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,136
Money in the pocket or nuts?

167
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:16,545
Hey. Have you lost it?

168
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,077
Wasting such talented
fingers for loose change.

169
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,815
Why not add few zeroes?

170
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,091
Add a zero after one,
and it becomes 10.

171
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,827
Add two zeros, and it becomes 100.

172
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:40,033
And if you add three zeros...
then it becomes 1000.

173
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,841
You have to defeat this
fool a thousand times...

174
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,572
...to make Rs.1000.

175
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:52,575
And, if you beat now just one time,
l'll give you Rs.1000.

176
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,378
Think about it.

177
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,516
Do you want to play a
thousand games, or just one?

178
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,453
2000.

179
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,911
He's under pressure now.

180
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,038
Not pressure, he's in a cooker.

181
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,113
Watch, how the whistle blows!

182
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,654
Get up.

183
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:15,992
Come here.

184
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,340
What is your name?
- Chandra.

185
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,402
Chandra what?
Horse, elephant, garlic.

186
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,538
Chandra what?
- Chandrakant Sarang.

187
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,408
Where do you stay?
- Sector 4, Room No. 26.

188
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,013
Get lost for now.

189
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,016
We'll find you if we need you.

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,691
Get lost.

191
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,623
We were just joking with you.

192
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,023
Go on.

193
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,025
2000.

194
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,303
'At that time l didn't know,
how much 2000 was.'

195
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,701
'But brother knew that
he had lost a big game.'

196
00:14:58,711 --> 00:14:59,973
'Jaleel called him many times.'

197
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,309
'But brother never went
back to the carom club.'

198
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:06,109
What did you buy?

199
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,983
We got the onions,
potatoes, and everything else...

200
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,049
Boss.

201
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:14,987
Come this way.
- But l need to buy ration...

202
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,119
Just come this way.

203
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,521
Open the umbrella.

204
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:20,994
What difference does it make?

205
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,592
We'll buy it from any shop.

206
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,134
Wait here, l'll get it.
- Hurry up.

207
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:30,733
There he is.

208
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,076
Boss, you?

209
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,210
What would you like?

210
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:47,091
You tell me, what should l get?

211
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,095
What do you have for me?

212
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,490
The entire shop belongs to you Boss.

213
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:58,236
Hear that? Everything in
this shop belongs to me.

214
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:03,305
Chandra, what does your sister want?

215
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,436
What do you want miss?

216
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,105
Rajni, let's go.

217
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,118
Sir...

218
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,726
Surya. Surya.
- What?

219
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,669
Jaleel is beating up your
brother at the crossroads.

220
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:34,797
What?

221
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,074
lt has just stopped.

222
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,668
There's no trusting the Bombay rains.

223
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,144
lt can start again anytime.

224
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:52,423
You beat up a small child,
aren't you ashamed?

225
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,224
You beat up children like this?

226
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,094
What are you? The local goon?

227
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,220
Are you some don?

228
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,161
l've seen bigger dons than you.

229
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,290
Beating up the weak
like this, you eunuch!

230
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,092
Hey woman! Enough of your abuses.

231
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,100
l've heard enough of it.

232
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,231
lf l lose it...

233
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:10,366
You've just settled in here.

234
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,109
lf l lose my mind...

235
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,770
...you'll disappear in no time.

236
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,172
He owes me Rs.2000. Ask him.

237
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,251
Hey you wimp, why
don't you tell your mother?

238
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,179
Ask him.

239
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:24,313
Hey shortie.

240
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:25,715
Come here.

241
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,191
Don't worry, am not
abducting him, just inquiring.

242
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:32,187
So? Wasn't he there with
him that day? - Yes boss.

243
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:33,790
Weren't you there as well?

244
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,195
So? You've started denying already?

245
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,538
Take care of the children.

246
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,201
Get that.

247
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:49,146
'Father would always say
if we keep walking ahead...'

248
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,807
'...bad times always shed away.'

249
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,548
'Rajni got married.'

250
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,210
'Devi went to class six.'

251
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,151
'And l, to class four.'

252
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,214
'But hardly went to school that year.'

253
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,882
'l fell ill several times.'

254
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:05,161
'Brother seemed to
have grown up overnight.'

255
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:08,359
'He worked 2-3,
sometimes 4 jobs a day.'

256
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,174
lf you get bored, you
can play alone as well.

257
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:27,910
No need to bang the
striker around unnecessarily.

258
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,245
Look here.

259
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,312
Two coins here. Two coins here.

260
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,921
Two coins here. Two coins here.

261
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,618
And, the queen in the centre.

262
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,752
Get it.

263
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,854
Once you hit a piece, then
go after it till pocketed.

264
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:42,592
Take rest, okay.

265
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:02,210
Great. You want to
play a game, with me?

266
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:04,881
Begin.

267
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,423
Hold the Striker properly. Yes.

268
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:12,955
Keep it in line. Yes.

269
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,290
And, watch this piece.

270
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:15,424
lf you hit this piece...

271
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,559
...just watch where
your striker goes.

272
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:17,693
'l stayed home for five months.'

273
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,303
'So, l wasn't taken back in school.'

274
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,434
'That entire year, l kept
slidding the striker on the board.'

275
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,367
Zaid.
- Surya.

276
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,502
l'm going to the carom association...

277
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,843
...to enrol my name.
We'll meet in the evening. - Listen...

278
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:30,373
Your name.
- Say your name.

279
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,574
Suryakant Sarang.

280
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,927
'That year, l won the
junior national championship.'

281
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:49,598
Wonderful, son.

282
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,663
How nice.
- Ma, Surya won.

283
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:52,795
How nice.

284
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:04,539
'Zaid and l, the kings of Bombay.'

285
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,285
'And the Malvani
water tank, our throne.'

286
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,411
Look, that's the whole of Mumbai.

287
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,346
'We owned any building
we put our finger on.'

288
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,295
'Then we believed that
we could see the whole city...

289
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:18,421
'...from the water-tank.'

290
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,357
'But we didn't know that...'

291
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,300
'...every time you see Mumbai,
a little more is seen.'

292
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,907
'People grow old with time.'

293
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,369
'But, the city gets
younger and newer.'

294
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:38,312
'Money was known to run
in the veins of Mumbai.'

295
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,909
'Some even said that if
you put your hand in...'

296
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,010
'...the gutters of the city,
you'll find money.'

297
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,539
You from Dhobi Talao?

298
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:14,076
Want some tea?

299
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:19,081
ls this your dad's wedding?

300
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,690
Get lost.

301
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:24,420
Rascal.

302
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,032
'l was in the ninth grade
when Father passed away...'

303
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,526
'...Studying for the
tenth grade replaced carom.'

304
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,498
'And making quick
money replaced studies.'

305
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:34,770
'Brother took the
responsibility of the family...'

306
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,503
'And now l had to do
something as well.'

307
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,968
'But, in my own style.'

308
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,374
'Delivering jewellery,
money for jewellers...'

309
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:44,041
'...from Malad to Zaveri Bazaar.'

310
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,108
'They would call it Angdiya.'

311
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:47,977
'lt was a risky job.'

312
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,979
'And, brother didn't totally approve.'

313
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,384
'But, the work hours
weren't too long...'

314
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,516
'...lt involved good money...'

315
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,924
'...And, a first-class pass
from Borivali to Churchgate.'

316
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,587
Mrs. Sarita just called.

317
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,788
She's coming here to pick it up.

318
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,457
And, did you have any
problems in the train? - No, sir.

319
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,932
'l would try to find my identity
among the millions in the city.'

320
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,138
'Some made it big in chemicals.'

321
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,401
'Some said diamonds
has a lot of money.'

322
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,399
'Many made good profit in plastic...'

323
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,411
'...while so many lost
out in stocks.'

324
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,608
'But Devi knew
what she wanted to do.'

325
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,949
'She aimed for the
right scholarships.'

326
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,010
'And would choose
the toughest subjects.'

327
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:24,814
Surya.

328
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,151
You can never be on time, can you?

329
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,484
ls it 12?

330
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,019
Always screaming at me.

331
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:32,096
And anyway, we spend so much on you.

332
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,426
That's obvious.

333
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,160
You'll have to pay a
price to be my brother.

334
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:36,492
Give it quickly.

335
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,900
Get lost. l should
benefit a little as well.

336
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:41,497
You won't get anywhere
with that face, get lost.

337
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,501
Dubai?
- Yes.

338
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:46,969
Within three months.

339
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,574
Take it easy.

340
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,177
lf you get ahead of yourself,
you'll regret it.

341
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,977
Devi, there are so many people here.

342
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:57,587
There's no value for human life.

343
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,454
Do you know, in Dubai?...

344
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,787
...people don't pay for electricity...

345
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,650
lt's absolutely free, just imagine.

346
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,459
lf l slog for just 3 years...

347
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,997
...we can do everything we want to.

348
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,532
And, will brother agree?

349
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,463
Life isn't a book of fairytales.

350
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:11,202
You don't find any
magical fairies here.

351
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:12,795
But the world is
filled with. Con artists.

352
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,065
Don't have to find 1 ,
you'll come across thousands.

353
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,071
Fine. Let's stay right
here in this 10 by10.

354
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,472
They'll promise you a job in a mall...

355
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,069
...but you'll end up in a car wash.

356
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,470
And, if they take your passport...

357
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,210
...you'll be a slave.

358
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:27,480
Brother, all those
people who go there...

359
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:30,488
...and return with a fortune,
are they...

360
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,215
Are they crazy?

361
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:36,688
Do you know you're
talking like a madman?

362
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,555
l don't want it.

363
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,562
l don't want any
tantrums while eating.

364
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,496
You know, your
father came to Mumbai...

365
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,232
...when he was just 14 years old.

366
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,897
Like a hero, he said to me,
l'll come back for you.

367
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:51,767
We had just gotten engaged then.

368
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:53,106
Ma, times are changed.

369
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,236
What changed?

370
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:56,505
Look, flowing water should be
channelled in the right direction...

371
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,243
...and not confined.

372
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,513
Let him do whatever he wants to now.

373
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,515
Otherwise, he'll
curse us in his old age.

374
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:03,646
lsn't it?

375
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,003
Aren't you Mr. Shashikant's son?
- Yes.

376
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,001
l was there at the funeral.

377
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,542
Mr. Qureshi, you know brother...

378
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,601
...is burdened with a
lot of responsibilities.

379
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,938
And, now, it's upon me,
how much can l take on.

380
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:32,678
Just get me a good job there.

381
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:34,617
Hard work runs in our blood sir.

382
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:38,755
Do you know how to read
and speak Arabic? - No, sir.

383
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,558
l teach in my house.

384
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,888
That's Adnan sir.

385
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,765
He has all the contacts in the Gulf.

386
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,165
Did you get the money?
- For the forms?

387
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,293
Yes.

388
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,637
1600.
- Fill these forms and come.

389
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,169
- Thank you. l'll leave.

390
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:01,704
They dare raise their hands on me?

391
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,838
So, what if they're
police officials...

392
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:03,973
...can they do as they please?

393
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,175
l told them clearly.
- What?

394
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,581
We need you, and you need us.

395
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:07,710
We cannot do without each other.

396
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,254
Did l say anything...?
- You said the right thing.

397
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:12,715
Zaid. Wait.
- Later.

398
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,849
Deserting us?

399
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:14,984
Surya...

400
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,661
No, no, not here.
Let's go to the side.

401
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,656
Faheem said that you
were arrested selling drugs.

402
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:25,669
Who Faheem?
- Who do you work for?

403
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,600
For that Sonu, the Ladies Bar owner?

404
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,675
Go ahead cook up a story.
- Are you mad?

405
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:33,802
No story.

406
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,070
Got arrested for no reason.

407
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,205
When they found nothing on me...

408
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,339
...they accused me of
any crime they pleased.

409
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,345
Hey... this way, let's go from here.

410
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:40,943
Let's go this way.

411
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,285
You haven't returned
Mansoor's money yet?

412
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:45,619
Who? l paid it long time back.

413
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:46,749
Listen to me.

414
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,757
'Every month Zaid would find a
new way of getting locked up...'

415
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,363
'With long tales for me.'

416
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,231
Mother... you're wearing a tie!

417
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:58,894
l'm going to Dubai.

418
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,634
No!
- Yes.

419
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:05,235
Passport, etc.
- All set?

420
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,102
All set?

421
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,774
l don't even have my
name on the ration card.

422
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:14,379
l've never gone beyond Ghatkopar.

423
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,649
There going to be a street
named after me, right here.

424
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:17,916
Zaid Khan Marg (Road).

425
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:19,885
You have only yourself to blame.

426
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,122
Look, there is time; sort
yourself out. We can go and...

427
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,821
- Hey. lt's nothing like that.

428
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,130
There are other ways
to go to Dubai also.

429
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:27,789
Just one phone call...
- You rascal.

430
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:29,725
Better reform yourself.

431
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:30,927
How long will you carry on like this?

432
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,030
l was just joking.

433
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:34,669
l'm not that bad.

434
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,667
You know when l find a
bat the ball is missing.

435
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:38,869
And, when l find the
ball the bat breaks.

436
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,406
Now l've started a brokerage business.

437
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,942
When l get a house l
don't have clients.

438
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:44,073
And, when l have
clients l can't find a house.

439
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,810
Tell me, what can l do?
- Are you done?

440
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,418
Now, do you want a house or client?

441
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,212
l need a house.

442
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:51,747
Right in front of my house,
the tenants...

443
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,085
...just vacated Majid's room.

444
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,216
He was just asking me...

445
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,351
...whether l know someone who needs...

446
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:56,689
l know, why don't you?

447
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:58,220
There's some
connection between you and me.

448
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:01,224
Whenever we meet,
something always works out.

449
00:27:02,935 --> 00:27:04,232
Get the luggage.

450
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:06,895
Greetings, Uncle.

451
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,374
l'll get it, Uncle. You don't worry.

452
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:35,722
The doors to heaven opened.

453
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:36,927
Son, please get that bag.

454
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:42,998
Some devotees were chosen.

455
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:49,409
They carried that little angel.

456
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:56,950
The message of God.

457
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:07,159
Since then, you've been
shining in this world.

458
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:19,438
The greatest happiness
that's beyond all expectations.

459
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:22,440
My friend!
- What happened?

460
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:24,908
Your job is done. Come on.

461
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,508
What job is done?

462
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,185
All the village
simpletons come to the city.

463
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:30,379
lt's all wrong.

464
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:31,922
They grow smart as
soon as they enter Mumbai.

465
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,856
The old man deducted money
for four days from my fees.

466
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:37,787
No man They're nice people.
- What nice people?

467
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,057
Do you want to eat?
- Yes. - Come on.

468
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:40,856
lt's my money after all.

469
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:07,416
Move aside.

470
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:14,831
Why are you standing in the way?

471
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:24,365
Move aside, l'm getting late!

472
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,034
l'll miss my local.

473
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:27,578
Nothing better to do
early in the morning!

474
00:29:54,272 --> 00:30:03,408
These hands,
glittering like the stars.

475
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:13,352
Your sweet voice is
like a gentle fragrance.

476
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:19,159
The fair body, like
fragrant sandalwood.

477
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:24,362
l wish to spend my
entire life in your arms.

478
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:29,100
There's innocence in your manner.

479
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:34,110
Charm in your grace.

480
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:39,047
l want to fill your
life with stars.

481
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:43,985
Your face is more
endearing than God.

482
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:49,456
Your face. Your face. Your face.

483
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,540
Devi, go and sleep there today.

484
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,079
Get up from here.

485
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,545
Go and sleep.

486
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,350
l said no means no.

487
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:20,282
Please?

00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:25,025
What's so special here?
- lt's nice and breezy.

490

ls she going to come to the window?

491
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:35,366
Of course she will. Why won't she?

492
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,972
Does she know,
that you'll be watching her...

493
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:41,035
...like an owl, the entire night?
- No.

494
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,638
What's her name?
- Noorie,

495
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,513
And does she know yours?

496
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,981
Noorie.
- What are you doing?

497
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:51,984
Telling her.

498
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:54,250
Noorie.
- Have you gone mad?

499
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,655
After she knows your name, we'll see.

500
00:31:57,729 --> 00:32:01,130
Now go to your own place.
- Don't bore me.

501
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,257
Go and sleep.

502
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,060
Noorie.

503
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,130
Are you going or not?
- l am.

504
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,078
Hello, Aunty.
- Hello, son.

505
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:24,688
You smiled like a
flower in full bloom.

506
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:31,427
Our eyes met like seeing the moon.

507
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:39,428
You smiled like a
flower in full bloom.

508
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:45,306
Our eyes met like seeing the moon.

509
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:56,112
Your smile is radiant
like the rays of dawn.

510
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:06,258
Your eyes are
filled with radiance.

511
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:16,131
Noorie, you're my life.

512
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:21,201
The eyes yearn for
a glimpse of you.

513
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,611
This passion is your effect.

514
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,343
Hey! Who threw this stone?

515
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,212
Devi, give it here!
- Get lost.

516
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:31,346
Devi, don't read it!
- Quiet!

517
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:34,086
Dear Surya...

518
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:39,688
l was startled by your airplane.

519
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:42,089
My classes will start after Eid.

520
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,294
lt was really
difficult to convince father.

521
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,098
When l go for classes along
with neighbourhood girls...

522
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,105
...we can meet then.

523
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,767
Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid, Uncle.

524
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:53,435
Happy Eid, son.

525
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,509
Happy Eid, Aunty.
- Happy Eid, son.

526
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,114
Let's go.

527
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,714
The moon has come out
somewhere else for you!

528
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:14,664
Gradually, you cast a spell
on me, and l was enchanted.

529
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,126
Bye, Surya.
- Bye.

530
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:23,197
Gradually, you cast a spell
on me, and l was enchanted.

531
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,540
lf you don't fail, your
college will continue...

532
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,407
...for at least three more years.

533
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,143
l'll leave for Dubai in six months.

534
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,146
l'll make a fortune in 2 1/2 years.

535
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,480
First, Devi will get married.

536
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,148
Then us.

537
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,679
What?

538
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,349
Don't be scared.

539
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,223
l'll tell my boss...

540
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,221
...that l'll be bringing my
wife along after our marriage.

541
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,353
Come on.

542
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:47,296
You'll stay there for three years?

543
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:49,833
This is the time to
slog it out, Noorie.

544
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,634
Otherwise, we'll be
eating peanuts all our life.

545
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,234
My father will never agree.

546
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,173
Hey Noorie. l'll talk to my brother.

547
00:34:58,243 --> 00:34:59,574
My brother will talk to your father.

548
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:02,179
They will get along really well,
just wait and see.

549
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:05,239
Don't you worry. Have some nuts.

550
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:07,376
l'll get you dates from Dubai.

551
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:13,584
Come and grace my life.

552
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:18,527
Just like you graced this moment.

553
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,321
Graced this moment.

554
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,663
Graced this moment.

555
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:54,363
Will you sit up all night?

556
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,625
Would they have hit her?

557
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:58,230
Are you mad?

558
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,361
Why will they hit her?

559
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,374
Get some sleep now.
- You go and sleep, l'll wait.

560
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:48,810
We don't know anything.

561
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,887
l don't think they are here.

562
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,356
l think they've left Mumbai.

563
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,420
Thank you.

564
00:36:58,897 --> 00:36:59,955
He didn't even take his dues.

565
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,290
Left his entire money back.

566
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,295
lt is an investment...

567
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:08,896
...but business is going to bloom.

568
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:11,498
The shop will look
really nice, once done.

569
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,634
What say?

570
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:14,711
What's going on here?

571
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,713
Preparing a feast?
- Can't you see?

572
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:17,839
Hey...

573
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:19,448
What about the agency that was here?

574
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,984
Closed, shutters down.

575
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:22,444
How can it close down?

576
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,379
And, what about Bhushan, Mr. Qureshi?

577
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:25,649
They're in Sagar Bar.

578
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,392
l think even before us men
have got cleaned up here.

579
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:34,998
We'll try something else after that.

580
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:40,462
What happened to the agency?

581
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:41,930
Everything is over, finished.

582
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,866
Give me back my money.

583
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:46,801
We don't have it.

584
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:49,012
Didn't guarantee you a job.

585
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:50,809
Your passport is done right?
- Hey...

586
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,407
Our accomplice there is
locked up for six years.

587
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:56,351
To send the birds from here...
- Shut up.

588
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:00,351
Listen carefully.
l want my money back.

589
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:05,686
You eat it up and l'll pull it
out from each of your stomachs.

590
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,424
Hey...
- Don't touch me.

591
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,556
Don't touch me.

592
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:09,759
There's no point using force on us.

593
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,369
Jaleel took our entire money.

594
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:13,495
He took the entire share.

595
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,368
Now, get your money back from him.

596
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,634
How did Jaleel get
involved in all this?

597
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:20,502
That was my hard-earned money.

598
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,444
l want my money back, whether
it's from Jaleel or his father.

599
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,572
Remember Adnan, l'll be back.

600
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,776
l won't spare anyone.

601
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,511
Get lost.

602
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:31,719
Try to learn from what happened.

603
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,388
And you even lost the money.

604
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,983
l'll get the money back from them.

605
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:38,855
He isn't going to learn anything.

606
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:41,656
People learn from their mistakes,
but not him.

607
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,859
Be quiet both of you.

608
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:44,592
Eat your food.

609
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,464
Mistakes are not made intentionally.

610
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,070
What is my mistake?
- See that.

611
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:51,006
He doesn't accept that he is at fault.

612
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,406
How is it my mistake?

613
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:53,808
l warned him so many times...

614
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,470
...that, no need to go...
- Look, who's here.

615
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:56,740
Look, look.
- How nice.

616
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,479
Aunty? You didn't invite me?

617
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,948
Family members don't need invitations.

618
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:04,076
Surya, Jaleel has called you.
- Who told you?

619
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:05,680
What do you mean?

620
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:06,815
l was there when they
mentioned your name.

621
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,085
l believe, some
fight with Adnan you had?

622
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:09,688
l said, Surya is my friend.

623
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,888
And, he said, Call him
on Sunday. That's all.

624
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:13,487
And, what were you doing there?

625
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,088
That's a long story.

626
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,690
But, it's not like what you think.

627
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,497
No, Zaid it's the opposite.

628
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:19,831
lt's not like what you think.

629
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:23,438
Fooling yourself will only
get you in trouble, Zaid.

630
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,635
My brother, you can deal
with me whenever you wish.

631
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,644
Let's go now, and settle this first.

632
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,770
Come on.

633
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,039
Stop here.

634
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:38,579
'ln the Carrom of life,
cant quit get up from the board...

635
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,456
'Win, or lose...'

636
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,057
'...A new board after another...'

637
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,120
'...have to keep playing.'

638
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,666
Surya, l can do
something only if you tell me.

639
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,001
You know, Jaleel...

640
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,474
'Jaleel had illegally acquired
hotel Starlite in Versova...'

641
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,602
'...and tightened his
grip in the business.'

642
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,674
'He had turned hotel
Starlite into his head office.'

643
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:06,016
'And controlled Malvani from here.'

644
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:08,746
'While his father,
Zuber, bred race horses.'

645
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:10,816
'Jaleel would breed Carrom players.'

646
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,485
'He had no regrets if he
lost in any other gamble.'

647
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:14,885
'But, if his player lost
in a game of Carrom...'

648
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,483
'...he would lose it.'

649
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,559
'He was proud about his
ability to choose players.'

650
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:21,698
'His player had to win.'

651
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:25,502
He flirted with my girlfriend!

652
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,571
ln front of the entire college.
- ls that so?

653
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:32,701
Slap him.

654
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:33,835
Give him one.

655
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:38,706
He abused me in front of
everyone in the canteen?

656
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,717
Were you present there?
- Hey, you be quiet.

657
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,178
You carry on.

658
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:44,848
Why are you still staring at him?

659
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:48,589
Slap him hard.

660
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,926
He deflated the tyres of my bike.

661
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:54,589
Near Topiwala theatre.

662
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:55,723
ls that so?
- Yes.

663
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,595
But, he...
- Hey. You carry on.

664
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,537
Now, you slap him.

665
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:06,540
What else?

666
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:08,804
Tell me.

667
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:13,549
You fools, say something.

668
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:15,012
Was that all?

669
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:18,555
Our country seems to
have a bright future.

670
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:19,817
Hey you.
- Yes.

671
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:21,616
Take them to the college...

672
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:25,025
...and slap them both in
front of everyone in the canteen.

673
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,620
Come on, get lost from here.

674
00:41:26,697 --> 00:41:27,755
Come on.

675
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,027
How are you?

676
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:37,234
Did you get the mutton?
- Mother...

677
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:38,639
...completely forgot about it?

678
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:39,767
So, what did you get?

679
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:41,175
You had called Surya.

680
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,974
Some tiff with Adnan.

681
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:44,781
So, l forgot
everything else in a hurry.

682
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:49,714
ls Adnan here?
- Yes.

683
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:50,913
He's sitting in the room inside.

684
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:03,597
When Adnan told me
that there's someone...

685
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:07,604
...who's going to get
money from my father...

686
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,664
...l thought l must meet this boy.

687
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,736
l was never able to do it.

688
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,677
So, what are you going to do?

689
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:20,016
He's buried in the Byculla cemetery.

690
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:23,017
They took Rs.20,000 from me.

691
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,682
And, made me spend an extra 1500.

692
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,622
They said, You'll
surely get a job in Dubai...

693
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,627
...lt's just a question of
how good a job it will be.

694
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:32,820
They cheated me.

695
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,155
Deceived me.

696
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:35,699
And they didn't do it secretly.

697
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,165
ln broad daylight with
an agency in the market

698
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:38,293
'Gul Gulshan Gulfam'.

699
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,030
They dishonoured your name as well.

700
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,767
l don't have any enmity with you.

701
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:44,232
lf he'd have taken
Rajiv Gandhi's name...

702
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:45,639
...l would've
insulted his father as well.

703
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,844
l am fired up, but to do hard work.

704
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:50,644
lf l did want to pick a fight...

705
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,239
...l would've smashed a
bottle on his head that day...

706
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:55,978
Wow! You'll bring
about a revolution one day.

707
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,718
Our country needs you.

708
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:00,915
Why are you going to Dubai?

709
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,183
Don't go to Dubai.

710
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,918
Tell me, what do you do?

711
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:06,122
Boss, can l say something?

712
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:10,200
Yes.
- l've known Surya since childhood.

713
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:12,669
He's a junior national champion.

714
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,068
l mean, he was. ln Carrom.

715
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:15,730
He plays really well since childhood.

716
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:16,864
Just like a rocket.

717
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,203
His fingers get going
and the board is clean.

718
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,267
The swine is a man
of hidden talents...

719
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,337
You mean to say he's a player.
- Yes.

720
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,005
l'm no player. lt's been six years...

721
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:25,742
...since l last touched the board.

722
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:26,874
Hey, what are you doing?

723
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,078
He's playing hard to get.

724
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:31,678
Boss he doesn't know
what he is worth.

725
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:37,752
Really? And you do?
- He can win big games for you Boss.

726
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:39,153
Hey, Zaid.

727
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,956
Just ask them to
return my money, that's it.

728
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,762
l didn't come here to play any games.

729
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:47,770
Hey smart mouth, you came
here because l called you.

730
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:51,966
And, some Adnan didn't
take your money. l have it.

731
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:54,369
And, if you want your money back...

732
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:55,844
...you'll have to win it.

733
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,712
l'm going to turn this
place into a casino...

734
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:00,910
...on the night of Diwali.

735
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,380
The bets will be for 10-15,000.

736
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,718
l'll charge you nothing for a game.

737
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:07,181
Tell me, what is your amount?

738
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,725
Defeat my player, and take 25,000.

739
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:19,133
Friends always know
how to have a gala time.

740
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:21,797
You rascal, have you lost it?
- What are you doing?

741
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:26,141
You're laughing.
- What happened?

742
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,802
What happened? You'll bet on me.

743
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,406
You'll make me Jaleel's player?

744
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:32,881
Carefully, it'll break.
- Carefully? Why you...

745
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,410
Have you gone mad?

746
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:38,148
l just thought of a way to
get your money back, what else?

747
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:42,950
You drug-addict.

748
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,896
This junk is what messes
up your brain, isn't it?

749
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:49,159
Someday, you'll sell me also for this.

750
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,291
Rascal...

751
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,779
Have you tasted the fish here?

752
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,309
Here comes my fish.

753
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,112
So, were you in jail or out of town?

754
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:08,776
Why, what happened? You missed me?

755
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:10,787
Not me,
my fish were yearning for you.

756
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:12,322
Lady, go get some ice.

757
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:16,452
Raju, get them some ice.

758
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:24,400
Surya, eat it.

759
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,930
When l got out,
everything had changed.

760
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,872
l didn't listen, and you
never told me Look Surya...

761
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:31,999
Surya, listen to me...

762
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:33,805
Enough about going to Dubai,
learning Arabic...

763
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:35,004
...pining for Noorie.

764
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:37,877
l didn't want my bad
luck to fall on you. - Yes.

765
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:40,149
You saved me by staying away from me?

766
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:42,879
l wanted to settle everything,
and start a business.

767
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,011
Oh, no, no...
- Listen, Surya.

768
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,818
You never said... you
never came up to me and said...

769
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:50,292
One problem after the another...
- Enough of this...

770
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:52,886
What did l do now?
- Not you.

771
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:55,022
You'll have to win your
money back from Jaleel.

772
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,964
Have you gone mad?
- l'm telling you.

773
00:45:58,035 --> 00:45:59,969
Just pick up the striker
and everything will be fine.

774
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:02,836
You know, last month a man
from Elphinstone Road...

775
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:06,240
...won an Ambassador car in one game.

776
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:08,845
Many novices in Mumbai
are placing their bets...

777
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:11,040
...and making lots of cash.

778
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,912
You can be a tough player.

779
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,245
You're a champion... a champion.

780
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:23,251
Everyone sitting here
is a seasoned player.

781
00:46:24,195 --> 00:46:25,253
That's Sharad Bhadge.

782
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:27,928
He works in the merchant navy.

783
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,191
But smokes like a steam engine.

784
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:35,528
We don't have to fear him though.

785
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,939
He never plays for anyone.

786
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,074
One table, after the next. Red shirt.

787
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:50,015
Sallu Tadatadi...
That's Jaleel's best player.

788
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:59,954
'Zaid warned me, that l
shouldn't practise in my area.'

789
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:01,889
'Because, Jaleel shouldn't know...'

790
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,297
'...how good l was at the game.'

791
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:06,297
'After one of my
courier deliveries...'

792
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,962
'...l went to an old club,
far away from Malvani.'

793
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:09,096
All the machines
there have grown old.

794
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:10,231
lf you insert the coin,
nothing comes out.

795
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:43,064
Hey, get lost.

796
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:45,608
Go out and play video games outside.

797
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,075
Spits out money... clink clink.

798
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:48,202
lts lights out here...

799
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:58,086
You'll get bored
humouring an old drunk.

800
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:02,223
Can you stop making silly excuses...

801
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:04,551
Start the gun-machine, Master.

802
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:10,098
Let the Striker do the talking.

803
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:13,027
Come on.

804
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:22,105
'Master's finger was rusty.'

805
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,444
'And, l had lost my touch as well.'

806
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:34,986
'But, that day while
playing with Master...'

807
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,118
'...l realised that
Carrom was back in my life.'

808
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:44,128
Carrom is merely a pressure game.

809
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:47,998
Take control of the
game from the break.

810
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:52,403
And then, it's just
the coin and your aim.

811
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:56,003
Keep the Striker on the line...

812
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,413
...look into your
opponents eyes directly.

813
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:02,677
And, then break.

814
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,420
You should get three.

815
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:15,097
Your opponent will be in
a fix from the beginning.

816
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:16,689
l'll place this here, and that there.

817
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:21,101
You fool, what is this
there and that here...

818
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:22,431
Diwali is drawing closer.

819
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:24,030
Get whatever you have to
and finish quickly, come on.

820
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:25,166
Get to work.

821
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,044
Where do you get these people from?

822
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,314
Zaid, what did you get?

823
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:34,442
Lamb from Miya Bhai's.
- Wow, that's great.

824
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:35,576
Lay it on the table.

825
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,644
Get washed, clean plates.
- Okay.

826
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:40,449
Did you hear?
- What?

827
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,258
Wasim and Bittu were
caught last night.

828
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,185
That's why l was wondering...

829
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:45,319
...they're nowhere to be seen.

830
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:46,658
There's a new
three-star officer in Malvani.

831
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,130
Find out what's he all about.
- Yes Boss.

832
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:50,725
And, listen, we'll
fall short of men...

833
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,200
...in the evening at the club.

834
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,736
So, be there.
- Yes Boss.

835
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:02,210
l can tie it in the bags,
and chuck it out.

836
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:08,144
What're you chucking buddy?
- Nothing.

837
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:09,543
Say it.

838
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,212
l just thought of an idea.
- What?

839
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:13,483
Doesn't it happen at times...

840
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:15,286
...the coins are laid on
the board in such a way...

841
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,486
...so that you
can pocket them easily?

842
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:19,557
Zaid, start your stories.

843
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,154
What do you want to say?

844
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:22,755
A new ACP from Bihar has
been transferred here.

845
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,095
Farooque.

846
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,226
l've heard, he's been called here...

847
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,360
...specially for cleaning up Malvani.

848
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,765
Jaleel is apparently
his top priority.

849
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:33,242
At the smallest of tips he
is raiding and arresting.

850
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,368
And, you're happy about it?

851
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:35,571
Listen to my idea.

852
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:37,375
l'll be able to repay Sonu's money.

853
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:38,779
And, give some at home as well.

854
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:40,111
What did l tell you?

855
00:50:40,184 --> 00:50:42,516
Didn't l say that l'll give you
half the money after Diwali? So?

856
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:45,180
l leaned on Jaleel to
save myself from Sonu.

857
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:46,779
And now l'll lean on you
to save myself from Jaleel?

858
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:50,657
ls it the same thing?
- l was just joking.

859
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,787
Listen to my idea.
- l don't want to.

860
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,125
Listen to me!

861
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:55,256
Let me go.

862
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,198
'lf l had listened to
Zaid's idea that night...'

863
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:00,261
'...Maybe...'

864
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:16,815
Place your bets! Place your bets!

865
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,548
Eight for one.

866
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:22,422
Place your bets, quickly.
- Come. Welcome.

867
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:26,158
We've made all the arrangements here.

868
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,230
Give sir a place to sit here.

869
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,766
Give him a counters of 2000.

870
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,165
How are you all doing?

871
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:38,301
Get up, the minister is here.

872
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,434
Let him sit. Get the
imported liquor out.

873
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:54,652
No one should have
any complaints, get it.

874
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:55,783
Surya.

875
00:51:57,194 --> 00:52:02,188
Happy Diwali, champion.
- Happy Diwali.

876
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,531
Are you ready?
- Where do l have to sit?

877
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:08,467
Attention, everyone.

878
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,202
lt's a 25,000 game.

879
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:16,208
Undiscovered Surya,
and Starlite's player, Mehmood.

880
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:18,274
lt's an eight-board game.

881
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:22,413
Whoever scores 29 points first, wins.

882
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:07,320
Zaid, you leave.

883
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:39,762
Two, three, four.

884
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,501
This is just the first party.

885
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:52,570
Watch from next time.

886
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:55,375
Just see how grand
Jaleel's Diwali party will be.

887
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,504
The whole of Mumbai will
talk about just one thing.

888
00:53:57,581 --> 00:53:59,572
Jaleel's Diwali party. Get it.

889
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,981
Just one thing.

890
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:37,478
Take care, Mehmood.
What are you doing?

891
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:41,756
He won't make any points after eight.

892
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,417
Seems like he's in a tight spot.

893
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:13,522
Brother he's losing.
- That's okay.

894
00:55:14,858 --> 00:55:16,450
Zaid, what are you counting?

895
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,446
What is this, Mehmood?

896
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:12,573
What's wrong?

897
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:16,515
He isn't getting the striker at all.

898
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:55,614
What a shot!

899
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:03,966
Wow champion, you played well.

900
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:05,626
Here.

901
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:08,568
But we haven't settled the score yet.

902
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:11,640
You remember your brother's game.

903
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,568
Chandra, isn't it?

904
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:17,579
You can settle the score today.

905
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:20,711
You seem to be on a roll.

906
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:22,775
My brother played
his game, and l, mine.

907
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,512
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

908
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:47,540
Take me to Malvani.

909
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:50,669
Surya, take this and go.
- What is this?

910
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,146
Don't ask, just go.

911
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:53,614
Happy Diwali. Come on.

912
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:55,014
Hey, get out of here. Go.
- Zaid.

913
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:03,549
Hello? Farooque sir, this is Pinto.

914
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:07,753
Come now, everyone's at the hotel.

915
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:17,630
Place your bets.
Yes, place your bets.

916
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,698
lt's eight. lt's eight.

917
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,641
Who bet on eight?

918
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,922
Come on, come on, everyone.

919
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:38,051
Get up.
- Police.

920
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:42,997
Come on, get up. Come on.

921
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,192
Get everyone. Get them.

922
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,598
Arrest them.

923
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:50,133
Don't let them go.

924
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,266
Take them in.

925
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,065
l want a report of where
Shinde was doing his rounds...

926
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,725
...since afternoon,
by tomorrow morning.

927
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:53,599
And, if anyone wants to
know who asked for it...

928
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,796
...tell them l've asked for it.

929
00:59:55,205 --> 00:59:56,331
l'll be at home but will be up.

930
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,465
As soon as Shinde returns call me.

931
00:59:58,541 --> 00:59:59,667
You cannot use force on me.

932
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,073
Excuse me, excuse me.

933
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:02,202
What's the problem?

934
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:03,404
Sir, we tried to
drive them away thrice.

935
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,141
But they keep trying to barge in.

936
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:06,614
We aren't trying
to barge in anywhere.

937
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:07,807
We're just doing our duty.

938
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:09,676
No need to be so restless.

939
01:00:10,286 --> 01:00:12,220
By morning, you'll get all
the blood on the streets.

940
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,755
And your news.

941
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:15,688
Are you denying the
police's role in the riots?

942
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,093
There are several
places in the city...

943
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,220
...where the police has
taken a communal stand.

944
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:25,424
Jogeshwari, Bandra East...
l can go on and on.

945
01:00:26,503 --> 01:00:28,095
Here in Malvani,
the police was seen...

946
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:30,162
...target practising.

947
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:32,170
A man was brushing his
teeth outside his house.

948
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:33,300
His head was blown off!

949
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:37,437
You want to be proud of
yourself sir, then assure us...

950
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,839
...that there won't be blood
on the streets in the morning...

951
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:58,865
With the grace of Allah, all the
children of our alley are awake.

952
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:14,144
Hello, Brother.

953
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:19,546
Hello.

954
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:21,883
That's a cool shirt.

955
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:45,839
Surya.

956
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:47,907
Come here.

957
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:49,911
Come.
- What is it?

958
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:53,314
He's Suryakant Sarang.

959
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:54,447
And, l'm his elder
brother Chandrakant.

960
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:55,582
Tell us, what's wrong?

961
01:01:55,658 --> 01:01:57,387
Sir has called for you.

962
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:58,585
But, what's the problem?

963
01:01:58,661 --> 01:01:59,719
Hey, come on.

964
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:01,263
Do you understand what
l've been saying for so long?

965
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:02,856
What do you want to do?

966
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:05,594
Become a carom hustler?
- Brother, let it be.

967
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:07,602
Didn't l tell you...
- l heard what you said.

968
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,805
You go to work, l'll handle this.

969
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:14,942
Don't try to teach me.

970
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:17,212
Suryakant Sarang...
- That's me.

971
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,946
He lives in Sector 4.

972
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:26,279
Works as an Angdiya.

973
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:27,681
Doesn't have any police record.

974
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:30,290
You were not seen during the raid.

975
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:32,888
But, the boys l caught said...

976
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:36,693
...that you're Jaleel's player.
- l'm not anyone's player, sir.

977
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,501
l played a few small bets, and left.

978
01:02:39,902 --> 01:02:41,631
The next morning l
heard about the raid

979
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,500
Do you know Jaleel?
- l know of him, sir.

980
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,305
Just like everyone else does.

981
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:47,634
But, l don't know him.

982
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:49,845
What if l found
evidence claiming otherwise?

983
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,778
lf you find evidence, you
won't ask so many questions sir?.

984
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:55,908
There's a great difference between...

985
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,850
...being smart and acting like one.

986
01:02:58,588 --> 01:03:00,988
Will you inform us if you
find out anything about Jaleel?

987
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:03,917
l don't want to get
involved in all this, sir.

988
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:05,919
There are many other boys.

989
01:03:06,663 --> 01:03:08,927
l'll first help myself, and then...

990
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:11,991
Fine, go.

991
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:33,883
'1988 was over.'

992
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:35,886
'The target for '89...'

993
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,026
'...Devi's diploma and her marriage.'

994
01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:41,021
'Zaid was missing since 1 1/2 months.'

995
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:43,290
'And, there was no
news of Jaleel as well.'

996
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:46,028
'My Angdiya job was slow too.'

997
01:03:46,969 --> 01:03:49,494
'Just one or two
parcels a month, that's all.'

998
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,835
l'm your Superman.

999
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:59,037
l'm the real Superman.

1000
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:00,974
What do you say?

1001
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,643
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?

1002
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:07,715
The entire world is celebrating.

1003
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,389
What are you doing, Surya?

1004
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:10,926
Why are you so quiet?

1005
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:12,051
What's wrong?

1006
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:14,926
Where were you?
- Goa.

1007
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:17,589
Listen to the entire story.

1008
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,926
l saved Jaleel from Farooque,
so that he doesn't suspect me.

1009
01:04:21,003 --> 01:04:22,470
Even his driver Ali was caught.

1010
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:23,937
Jaleel quickly took the car out.

1011
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:27,066
And, l've been on a free
vacation in Goa till yesterday.

1012
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:32,005
The police came home.

1013
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:34,877
Brother and l had to spend an
entire day in the police station.

1014
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:36,075
Forget it, Surya.

1015
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,343
lt's the past now.

1016
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,413
These things aren't
easily forgotten Zaid.

1017
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:43,087
They always come back, and slap you.

1018
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:44,484
Surya listen to me.

1019
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,960
There Jaleel has been
abusing Sonu's mother, sister...

1020
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:49,827
All the ladies of his family...
Listen to me.

1021
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:52,366
He thinks that Sonu
is behind the raid.

1022
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,094
He doesn't suspect me at all.

1023
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:58,100
lts like getting 2
birds without a stone.

1024
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:03,571
lf Jaleel finds out that
you're behind all this...

1025
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:06,774
...then he'll chop
you to pieces, Zaid.

1026
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,917
This is not a joke.

1027
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:12,114
Tonight Jaleel's men are
going to smash Sonu's bar.

1028
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:13,787
The real joke's on him.

1029
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:16,118
Both are going to be
gunning for each other.

1030
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:17,859
Why do we have to worry?

1031
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:33,600
Come here.

1032
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:38,538
Was there a bonus sanctioned?

1033
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:43,617
Everyone's back on
duty on 1 st morning.

1034
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:45,883
What is this?
- Report, sir.

1035
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:48,081
Who signed it?

1036
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,419
Farooque sir.

1037
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,891
Sir, what are you doing here?

1038
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:53,019
This block is my responsibility.

1039
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,153
You're late, Shinde.

1040
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,488
ln any case the police is late.

1041
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:56,623
But you are even later than that.

1042
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,963
Sir, there are many petty
fights on New Year's eve.

1043
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,426
2 boys must have taken a
fancy for the same girl...

1044
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:03,438
...that's all.
- The waiters have reported...

1045
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,030
...that there was more
spilling than drinking.

1046
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,642
And the manger was
threatened by Jaleel's men.

1047
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:10,439
What you call a bar brawl,
is actually a result...

1048
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:12,572
...of the enmity
between Sonu and Jaleel.

1049
01:06:12,648 --> 01:06:15,173
But...
- Your breath still smells of alcohol.

1050
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:16,845
You can go home if you like.

1051
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:18,853
But, sir...
- l've taken care of everything here.

1052
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:19,979
Sorry, sir.

1053
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,991
'Though lnspector Farooque
looked more like a church priest...'

1054
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:26,127
'...he was gradually becoming a
menace for all the goons of Malvani'

1055
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:33,868
'The birthday of Kurla's,
lqbal Kurla.'

1056
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:36,061
'First big game of the year.'

1057
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:41,200
'And, marked my entry
into the world of betting.'

1058
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,205
'Bets would reach up to a lakh here.'

1059
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:50,742
'But, that day l was there
only to play small games.'

1060
01:06:55,157 --> 01:06:56,215
Take a seat.

1061
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:00,153
Where do you stay?
- Malvani.

1062
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:02,487
l don't play below a thousand.
- Fine.

1063
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,177
When the coin goes in the pocket,
then everything goes right.

1064
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,507
Otherwise...

1065
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,241
Well said. No?

1066
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,847
Have you seen Gafoor's game today?

1067
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:23,510
No. Why?
- He's playing so well.

1068
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:26,111
Go, take a look.
He's killing it today.

1069
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:27,917
Go, go. Quickly.

1070
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:33,251
When did you come?
- At 9:40. Had a good start...

1071
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:34,654
...let's see.

1072
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,254
Aren't you playing lqbal
Kurla's challenge game?

1073
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,533
This time Jaleel has
doubled the prize money.

1074
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,259
How much?
- The same as the reward for Gabbar.

1075
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:45,205
Rupees 50,000.
- Don't we need to have 25?

1076
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,208
Why worry about money when l'm there.

1077
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:48,868
What did l tell you about
laying low? Keep it inside.

1078
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:50,139
You ask for it, wont get it.

1079
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,070
Stealing it is wrong.

1080
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:53,738
Winning is the only way.

1081
01:07:54,016 --> 01:07:56,007
And l feel you can win.

1082
01:07:56,218 --> 01:07:58,277
Now you decide what you want to do.

1083
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,553
Everyone, on the
occasion of my birthday...

1084
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:05,287
...Jaleel has increased
the prize money to 50,000.

1085
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:08,688
And, now, l'm calling
forth his player for this game.

1086
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,156
Vilas.

1087
01:08:10,232 --> 01:08:11,290
Vilas Bullet.

1088
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:13,828
How nice. A big hand everyone.

1089
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,962
This will be fun.

1090
01:08:17,106 --> 01:08:19,165
lf you don't loose under 5 boards...

1091
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:20,572
...you can take 15,000 back.

1092
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,978
You going to play?

1093
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:36,315
25,000.

1094
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:40,326
What is your name?
- Surya.

1095
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,330
Surya and Vilas are going
to have a game. A big hand.

1096
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:51,998
How long will a mango
survive behind the leaves...

1097
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:55,606
Sooner or later it has
to end up in the market.

1098
01:08:57,213 --> 01:08:59,613
Come on Vilas,
kick start your bullet!

1099
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:14,288
Great Vilas. Get him.

1100
01:10:13,355 --> 01:10:16,153
Don't let him win. Come on. Get him.

1101
01:10:31,373 --> 01:10:32,704
This boy will hit a 'start to finish'.

1102
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:34,299
There's no chance he'll do it.

1103
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:37,709
Want to bet 20,000 on it?
- We're on.

1104
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:08,826
Wow, amazing, his fingers
have been a trigger today...

1105
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:11,532
2-2 coins in one shot, unbelievable.

1106
01:12:12,007 --> 01:12:16,535
Mr. lqbal this new kid uses
his Striker like an AK 47 no?

1107
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:18,538
You really made my day today, boy.

1108
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:20,006
What a game.

1109
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:23,017
l've had a great birthday. Very good.

1110
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:24,143
A big hand brothers.

1111
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:27,817
Surya.

1112
01:12:33,429 --> 01:12:35,021
You play with a lot of rage.

1113
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:38,094
But you play really well.

1114
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,836
The next week hustle is
fixed on the roof of Navjeevan...

1115
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:44,429
... at Bombay Central.
Come play for me.

1116
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:46,567
What do you say, Mr. lqbal?

1117
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:47,900
Right, brother.

1118
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:49,103
Jaleel is very lucky.

1119
01:12:51,046 --> 01:12:52,843
lf he's going to buy all the guns...

1120
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:54,041
...who'll fire from the other side?

1121
01:12:55,517 --> 01:12:56,575
What do you say, Mr. lqbal?

1122
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:58,318
Even this is right, Mr. Jaleel.

1123
01:12:58,387 --> 01:12:59,581
Both sides have be firing bullets.

1124
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:03,382
Okay, you can go now.

1125
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:04,854
We'll meet again.

1126
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,122
But remember one thing.

1127
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,195
lts better to be safe than sorry.

1128
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,608
Here.
- What is this?

1129
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,475
Pepper fish. What do you think it is?

1130
01:13:23,545 --> 01:13:25,604
l asked for some paper.
- Oh, God, what kind of a man are you?

1131
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:27,007
You want to eat paper?

1132
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:28,541
Now, what about this?

1133
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,482
Shall l take it away?
- No, let it be.

1134
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,278
Give me a piece of paper, if possible.

1135
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,355
Brother, could you take it there?

1136
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:43,622
Hey man.

1137
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,094
You were the talk of the
whole evening after you left.

1138
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:52,440
Everyone was talking only
about you and the game...

1139
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:53,973
'Once a player is famous...'

1140
01:13:54,043 --> 01:13:55,305
'...people fear and
avoid placing big bets...'

1141
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:57,910
'but Zaid and l
preceded my reputation...'

1142
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,174
'...and nailed a few big ones.'

1143
01:13:59,915 --> 01:14:02,383
Demand it, demand it.

1144
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:05,248
Demand what's yours from God.

1145
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,515
Look, they're dressed like grooms.

1146
01:14:07,122 --> 01:14:08,384
Come lets help them celebrate.

1147
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:11,584
First lose up to 3000,
then take all they have.

1148
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,652
Cast your luck aside.

1149
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:17,592
The key's right in your hands.

1150
01:14:17,933 --> 01:14:20,595
Why worry about destiny?

1151
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,534
Just play your game.

1152
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:26,600
They'll know you, respect you.

1153
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:29,672
You'll be celebrated.

1154
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:31,276
They'll know you, respect you.

1155
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:32,609
You'll be celebrated.

1156
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,616
The streets will know your name.

1157
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,619
A spark from the ashes.

1158
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:41,955
Will singe everyone.

1159
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:44,492
The ember hidden in ashes.

1160
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,688
Will singe everyone.

1161
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:49,626
This world...

1162
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,361
...is your treasure.

1163
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,694
Life is a party...

1164
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:54,367
... Don't hold back.

1165
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:57,097
This world... is your treasure.

1166
01:14:57,506 --> 01:14:59,633
So come and take what's yours.

1167
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:00,970
Did you see his face?

1168
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:02,703
lt looked like the ashtray.

1169
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,447
Come on, shell out 500.

1170
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:14,380
Demand it, demand it.

1171
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:17,583
Demand what's yours from God.

1172
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:20,391
Demand it, demand it.

1173
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:23,727
Demand what's yours from God.

1174
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,998
Cast your luck aside.

1175
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,731
The key is in your hands.

1176
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:33,007
Why are you worried about fate?

1177
01:15:33,142 --> 01:15:35,667
Play your game.

1178
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,736
They'll know you, respect you.

1179
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:41,744
You'll be celebrated.

1180
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:43,416
They'll know you, respect you.

1181
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:44,679
You'll be celebrated.

1182
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:48,018
The streets will know your name.

1183
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:51,417
Stop the car.

1184
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:03,571
Jaleel, l'm Farooque. Hello.
- Hello.

1185
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,035
Look, there are many issues.

1186
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:08,775
Let's deal with things one at a time.

1187
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:13,506
A business, whether
it's legal or illegal...

1188
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:14,640
...is still a business after all.

1189
01:16:15,717 --> 01:16:18,777
But, hooliganism...
that's a different issue.

1190
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,315
And, if it's done
without any reason...

1191
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:22,120
...then it's called foolishness.

1192
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:24,591
Sir, everything you've said...

1193
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,789
...has gone above my head
like an lmran Khan bouncer.

1194
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,667
Then, l'll give you
a Kapil Dev Yorker.

1195
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:33,792
Come.

1196
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,738
The informer for the Diwali
raid was one of your own men.

1197
01:16:45,747 --> 01:16:47,146
Sonu has nothing to do with it.

1198
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,214
You attacked his
property on New Year's eve.

1199
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,150
And, he'll do the same on Holi.

1200
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,346
When the informer is
actually one of yours.

1201
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,086
Better tell him that, sir.

1202
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:58,825
l have no enmity with him.

1203
01:16:59,361 --> 01:17:00,828
Zaid had to pay me
such a huge amount.

1204
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,830
But, you called me up once,
and l forgot everything.

1205
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:05,824
Who?

1206
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:11,298
From where did you
get all this money?

1207
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:12,765
Don't get any wrong ideas?

1208
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,103
l won it in carom.

1209
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:20,104
l know you'll never do
anything wrong. - Then?

1210
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:22,844
But, this isn't right either Surya.

1211
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:26,184
Devi, do you even know anything?

1212
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:27,853
Just keep saying
something for the sake of it.

1213
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:29,651
Don't get angry with me.

1214
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:31,450
lf brother finds out...

1215
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:44,196
l said yes to Swanand.

1216
01:17:45,474 --> 01:17:48,875
Mhatare from Bhandup?
- Yes.

1217
01:17:51,346 --> 01:17:52,540
What about your studies,
after your marriage?

1218
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:56,412
l will continue with it,
but in Bangalore.

1219
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:58,679
He's working there.

1220
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:01,888
They've not asked for a
single penny in dowry.

1221
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:05,154
You'll go to Bangalore?

1222
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:11,892
Yes.
- Great.

1223
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,911
You came very late last night.

1224
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:27,506
And up so early?

1225
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,177
Brother, Devi shocked me
with the news last night.

1226
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:32,511
She'll be getting engaged.

1227
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:34,584
Eyes opened automatically.

1228
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:36,187
Yes, just yesterday it was fixed.

1229
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:37,716
Get Somtya ready quickly.

1230
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:38,917
l have to go via Dadar.

1231
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:40,320
Pack your lunch box first.

1232
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:41,587
Brother.

1233
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:44,256
What is this?

1234
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,858
Zaid had some and
some the Zaveri owed me.

1235
01:18:47,536 --> 01:18:48,662
Mother is collecting all the money.

1236
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:49,928
Give it to her yourself.

1237
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:52,331
And, Brother.

1238
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:54,935
l'll take care of the catering,
and decorations for the engagement.

1239
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,336
l have a friend who does this.

1240
01:18:56,878 --> 01:18:58,402
Let me know if l can do anything else.

1241
01:18:58,614 --> 01:18:59,672
Anything.

1242
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:00,873
l will.

1243
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,408
Shall we?

1244
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:03,876
How are you?

1245
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:09,551
Everything okay.

1246
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,351
How are you, Sonu sir?

1247
01:19:13,895 --> 01:19:16,830
After this we have
only seven more to go.

1248
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,965
Really? You're
rolling in cash these days.

1249
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:21,759
Have you been selling for
someone else? - Tell me.

1250
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:25,295
No, Sonu sir. l've
modifying old bikes for money...

1251
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:26,432
lt's going well...

1252
01:19:26,508 --> 01:19:27,566
Fine, whatever.

1253
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,908
Sit down. Pull one.
- No.

1254
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:33,641
Forget everything, pull one.
- No, l've to go.

1255
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:34,977
l have lots to do. l'll go crazy.

1256
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,775
What are you saying?
Come sit & pull one!

1257
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:38,911
No.

1258
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:40,852
Sure?
- Sure. Goodbye.

1259
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:45,519
Scoundrel.

1260
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:47,459
See you later.
- Okay.

1261
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:22,354
Hey, Zaid.

1262
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:27,296
Seems like l've been
invited for 2 parties today.

1263
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,504
But, you guys won't
take no for an answer.

1264
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,705
Come on.

1265
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:38,038
You should be thankful
that my men saw you first...

1266
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:40,977
...and not Jaleel's men.

1267
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,311
lt's not that, sir.

1268
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:43,918
l haven't done anything wrong.

1269
01:20:43,985 --> 01:20:45,782
l'm even clearing my old debts, sir.

1270
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:47,321
lt's my sister's engagement today.

1271
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,447
So, l was going there all dressed up.

1272
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:50,453
l thought, maybe, l'll find
someone there for myself too.

1273
01:20:50,525 --> 01:20:51,856
Sir, if you want l can
come in the evening...

1274
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:53,053
...or tomorrow morning.

1275
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,591
Where were you at the
time of the Diwali raid?

1276
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:57,990
Which raid, sir?

1277
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,366
Sir, l wasn't in Mumbai.

1278
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:04,071
He missed three attendances after.

1279
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:06,465
Sir.

1280
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:08,734
You were with Jaleel, in Goa.

1281
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,875
Sir, l took mother
to our native place.

1282
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:13,739
lt's true, sir.

1283
01:21:14,015 --> 01:21:15,607
ls the room behind empty?
- Yes, sir.

1284
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:16,742
Take him there.

1285
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:17,876
Sir, try to understand,
it's my sister's engagement.

1286
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:19,011
Take him away.
- Sir, try to understand.

1287
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,349
Come on.

1288
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:38,096
Hey, why are you pushing?

1289
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:44,105
My... bag.

1290
01:21:46,047 --> 01:21:47,776
Thief. Thief.

1291
01:21:48,049 --> 01:21:50,916
My bag.
- Are you crazy?

1292
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:56,653
l'm helpless too.

1293
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:58,056
Otherwise, l wouldn't
have made you sign on this.

1294
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,388
But, what can l do?
- l've to run a business too.

1295
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,395
Sir, l'll return your money...

1296
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:03,727
...before the time you've given me.

1297
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:37,155
Hey...

1298
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:38,824
What are you doing?

1299
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:42,094
Have you gone mad?

1300
01:22:42,637 --> 01:22:44,502
Who was on at Churchgate route today?
- lt wasn't me!

1301
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,504
Who was it?
- lt wasn't me!

1302
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,171
'Hit by the loss of 150,000...'

1303
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:53,173
'Like being bitten in a game of
snakes and ladders, on 98 ...'

1304
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:57,110
'...right back to 5.'

1305
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:04,118
Did you find out who they were?

1306
01:23:06,928 --> 01:23:07,986
Nothing at all.

1307
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:10,190
What happened with Farooque?

1308
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:13,193
He let me go last evening.

1309
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:15,533
But, there seems no
end to his questions.

1310
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:19,605
Look Zaid. lf Farooque finds out...

1311
01:23:20,141 --> 01:23:21,870
...that you were the
informer for the Diwali raid...

1312
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,008
...his sword will hang
above you, all your life.

1313
01:23:25,146 --> 01:23:26,204
Forget Farooque.

1314
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:29,812
l've grown up in the
shade of swords my friend...

1315
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:32,880
Ma, give me food.
- What's going on with you?

1316
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:34,680
What do you mean?

1317
01:23:35,156 --> 01:23:36,487
l mean, l didn't teach you
Carrom to be a hustler...

1318
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,025
...to play with these goons.

1319
01:23:39,961 --> 01:23:41,019
Who told you?

1320
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:42,821
Does anyone have to tell me?

1321
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:44,823
You're such a big hustler.

1322
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:45,958
You're so renowned.

1323
01:23:46,701 --> 01:23:49,693
The police came home and
you still didn't get it?

1324
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:51,504
He won't stop getting into trouble.

1325
01:23:51,973 --> 01:23:53,167
What trouble, Brother?

1326
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:55,106
Did l steal or murder anyone?

1327
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:56,234
Don't just say anything.

1328
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:57,569
Surya.

1329
01:23:57,646 --> 01:23:59,170
Surya, stand here and talk to me.

1330
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:00,509
There's a wedding at home.

1331
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:01,976
Aren't you ashamed?

1332
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,575
Gambling money means illegal money.

1333
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:05,711
Get that.

1334
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:07,516
Taking back like this.

1335
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:09,250
Can't you find a proper job?

1336
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:12,716
You want to feed us
with this gambling money?

1337
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:13,987
And if you need more money...

1338
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:15,120
...for your booze and cigarettes...

1339
01:24:15,196 --> 01:24:16,595
...then please don't
resort to these things.

1340
01:24:16,798 --> 01:24:18,129
l'll do some more overtime for you.

1341
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:19,928
Stop it, Brother.
lts getting too much...

1342
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:21,866
Aren't you ashamed?

1343
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,567
Talking like that!

1344
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:25,197
He's right.

1345
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:27,537
lt's better you sit at home,
rather than doing this.

1346
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:28,667
Ma, you relax.

1347
01:24:28,743 --> 01:24:29,801
Brother is talking to him.

1348
01:24:29,878 --> 01:24:30,936
He's fooling everyone, Ma.

1349
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:32,206
He's fooling everyone.

1350
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:34,139
But now all this is over.

1351
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,084
You'll have to work
wherever l get you a job.

1352
01:24:37,686 --> 01:24:39,153
Enough of trying different things.

1353
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,278
Do you understand what l'm saying?

1354
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:42,283
Look at me...
- Hey!

1355
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:23,194
Come on, l have to close down.

1356
01:25:23,264 --> 01:25:26,597
And, it so happened.

1357
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:35,275
l was woken by a dream in the night.

1358
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:45,012
And it so happened.

1359
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:53,360
l was woken by a dream in the night.

1360
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,358
And, it so happened.

1361
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:03,363
The moon dissolved.

1362
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:07,367
And, it so happened.

1363
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:12,905
The string of dreams was broken.

1364
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:18,379
The darkness continued.

1365
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:26,387
And the light
disappeared into shadows.

1366
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:30,392
Then couldn't sleep ever...

1367
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:38,399
...The souls in anguish.

1368
01:26:40,275 --> 01:26:43,802
Then couldn't sleep ever...

1369
01:26:43,878 --> 01:26:46,278
We'll fall short of everything.

1370
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:48,815
...The souls in anguish.

1371
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:55,080
Hey, want a shot for
your hangover or lime-soda?

1372
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,349
Can l get some cold water?

1373
01:26:57,425 --> 01:27:00,417
Raju, get him water. With ice.

1374
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,763
So, did Chintu-Mintu
trouble you last night? - Who?

1375
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:08,834
Chintu-Mintu, the two mice.

1376
01:27:08,903 --> 01:27:09,961
They stay up in that room.

1377
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:15,776
l was in the boat last night?...
- Hey.

1378
01:27:16,711 --> 01:27:19,703
l can understand that a man
staggers after drinking...

1379
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,715
...what's with the
memory loss next morning?

1380
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,396
Surya, l think we'll
have to leave Bombay.

1381
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:38,455
Have you gone mad?
- Listen to me.

1382
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,395
We'll buy three-four,
second-hand motorcycles...

1383
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,732
...rent them out...

1384
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:44,863
... and party.

1385
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:45,997
You can leave Bombay...

1386
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,800
...but Bombay isn't
going to spare you.

1387
01:27:50,879 --> 01:27:52,471
There's no point in running, Zaid.

1388
01:27:54,282 --> 01:27:55,476
Life has taken the break.

1389
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,813
Now, we have to play.

1390
01:27:59,487 --> 01:28:00,886
lt's our turn now.

1391
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:16,162
You play well.

1392
01:28:16,771 --> 01:28:20,901
But, l will defeat you someday.

1393
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:31,513
Surya, Jaleel is
totally gunning for you.

1394
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:35,180
What is he saying?

1395
01:28:35,256 --> 01:28:37,451
He's made an offer.
- What?

1396
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:40,323
He says, A lot has changed,
after since the lqbal Kurla night.

1397
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:41,453
l asked, What has changed?

1398
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:44,526
He said, Surya
desperately needs money.

1399
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:47,461
l thought, how does
he know about Surya?

1400
01:28:47,936 --> 01:28:49,403
He's giving you 15,000 to win.

1401
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:50,799
He also said, Surya needs 1
- 1 .5 lakhs...

1402
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:52,203
...Go, and ask him.

1403
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:58,877
So, he's behind the
robbery on the train!

1404
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:02,208
Zaid, l won't spare him.
- No.

1405
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:03,341
Don't do anything here.

1406
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,547
His man is carrying a gun.

1407
01:29:05,954 --> 01:29:07,012
Think before you do anything.

1408
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:09,818
Boss.
- Very good.

1409
01:29:10,091 --> 01:29:13,356
lt's true Jaleel, a lot has changed.

1410
01:29:14,095 --> 01:29:15,153
Let us change as well.

1411
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:17,428
Let's up the number and the zeros.

1412
01:29:18,566 --> 01:29:19,965
This way or that...

1413
01:29:21,903 --> 01:29:25,031
...Two lakhs.
- Straight two lakhs!

1414
01:29:26,574 --> 01:29:28,235
Have you ever seen two lakhs?

1415
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,909
No, that's why the urge to win it.

1416
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,041
You can pit any player against me.

1417
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:36,114
lf l lose, l'll play
for you and repay it.

1418
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:38,385
Just like his brother.

1419
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:41,180
They both come from
the same mould after all.

1420
01:29:42,323 --> 01:29:43,585
The bet is on.

1421
01:29:43,992 --> 01:29:46,586
Save all your
aggression till next week.

1422
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:48,861
lt'll be useful.

1423
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:51,992
Don't spill it around. The
game will be held right here.

1424
01:30:03,945 --> 01:30:05,003
Stop here.

1425
01:30:07,415 --> 01:30:09,280
How much?
- 4.80.

1426
01:30:10,551 --> 01:30:11,609
Keep the change.

1427
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:16,287
This won't do.

1428
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:18,415
l only agreed for you
to sleep for a few days.

1429
01:30:18,493 --> 01:30:19,551
What is all this?

1430
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:20,889
l need to practise

1431
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:22,223
lt won't bother anyone.

1432
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:28,295
Here the advance money.

1433
01:30:30,505 --> 01:30:31,563
The money is okay.

1434
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:32,901
But you'll be alone up there?

1435
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:34,635
Or, will l be seeing
more goons hanging around?

1436
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:38,173
Whether l'm a goon or a priest...

1437
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:39,372
...lt's none of your business.

1438
01:30:39,981 --> 01:30:41,039
l'll be alone up there.

1439
01:30:41,249 --> 01:30:42,648
Will give you the
money on time as promised.

1440
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:43,975
There won't be any hindrance to you...

1441
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:45,110
...Or your business.

1442
01:30:45,186 --> 01:30:46,244
Do we have a deal?

1443
01:30:47,121 --> 01:30:48,520
l'll have to ask Chintu-Mintu.

1444
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:54,324
And, it so happened.

1445
01:30:56,664 --> 01:31:03,661
All was dispersed by
the morning breeze.

1446
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:08,540
And, it so happened.

1447
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:16,682
All was dispersed by
the morning breeze.

1448
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:21,678
And, it so happened.

1449
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:27,084
The lines on the
face were washed away.

1450
01:31:27,628 --> 01:31:31,029
And, it so happened.

1451
01:31:31,099 --> 01:31:36,696
We came from dust, and
that's what life turned us into.

1452
01:31:37,638 --> 01:31:43,975
Drenched in our own tears...

1453
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:51,508
...we silently kept fading away.

1454
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,518
Then couldn't sleep ever...

1455
01:31:58,126 --> 01:32:04,395
...The souls in anguish.

1456
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:14,605
...The souls in anguish.

1457
01:32:14,675 --> 01:32:16,734
A sea-facing room in Bombay,
that's the best.

1458
01:32:17,278 --> 01:32:19,746
How is your practise going?
- Great.

1459
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:21,607
Let's go to the beach,
and have a beer.

1460
01:32:21,682 --> 01:32:22,740
Come on.

1461
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:29,756
Look. Your father and my father.

1462
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:31,683
How are you, Father?

1463
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,422
Surya and l are having a beer.

1464
01:32:34,228 --> 01:32:35,286
Cheers.

1465
01:32:44,705 --> 01:32:45,763
You know.

1466
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:47,774
l had a doubt before
the Diwali night...

1467
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:51,772
...Had no clue what you'd do
after playing that old Master.

1468
01:32:52,246 --> 01:32:54,771
You were playing after so
many years. What if you lost?

1469
01:32:55,116 --> 01:32:57,050
But, now, l'm absolutely sure.

1470
01:32:57,585 --> 01:33:00,452
No matter who plays for Jaleel,
you'll beat him.

1471
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:01,713
You'll clean him out.

1472
01:33:02,323 --> 01:33:03,790
After tomorrow,
everything is going to be right.

1473
01:33:05,259 --> 01:33:07,318
l'll be leaving Jaleel
after the game.

1474
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,258
Come on.

1475
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:24,607
Have you called Salim and everyone?
- Yes, l have.

1476
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:26,074
They'll be there directly.

1477
01:33:26,147 --> 01:33:27,205
Did you talk to them yourself?

1478
01:33:27,281 --> 01:33:28,339
Yes, l did.

1479
01:33:29,684 --> 01:33:32,812
Zaid. How are you?

1480
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:35,217
You must be thinking...

1481
01:33:35,556 --> 01:33:38,081
...you're of no use to me,
but yet l let you hang around.

1482
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:39,623
l was going to say the same thing.

1483
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,489
l should leave.

1484
01:33:41,562 --> 01:33:43,291
Scoundrel, getting emotional.

1485
01:33:43,831 --> 01:33:46,698
This is the right time to
knock Sonu out of the game.

1486
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:51,094
All his suppliers for drugs, cocaine,
are in my pocket.

1487
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:53,833
Zaid. l've got this sample.

1488
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:57,109
ls this cocaine or carrom powder...

1489
01:33:57,245 --> 01:33:58,837
l just cant tell the difference.

1490
01:33:59,113 --> 01:34:00,512
Take a look, and tell me what it is?

1491
01:34:01,115 --> 01:34:02,844
Take it.

1492
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:05,512
Do a line, and tell
me how the stuff is.

1493
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,384
Zaid don't think so much.

1494
01:34:08,856 --> 01:34:11,848
You're no ordinary person now.

1495
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:15,662
Now, we'll have real
fun getting Sonu.

1496
01:34:15,796 --> 01:34:17,787
You have to handle all this.

1497
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:20,390
You'll be my partner, Zaid.

1498
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:22,197
You're going to work with me.

1499
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:23,796
Check it and tell me.

1500
01:34:25,406 --> 01:34:28,136
They say it's the best stuff.

1501
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:32,869
One line and you're
30,000 feet above the ground.

1502
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:36,279
Try it.

1503
01:34:40,555 --> 01:34:41,749
Hello.

1504
01:34:41,822 --> 01:34:45,223
Surya. My brother.
- What are you doing?

1505
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,558
Come on, come on.

1506
01:34:50,298 --> 01:34:51,697
Boss Surya is here to play.

1507
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:54,359
Nice, you ready?
- Lets get started.

1508
01:34:55,836 --> 01:34:57,428
You are in a hurry, aren't you?

1509
01:34:58,372 --> 01:34:59,566
l bet you can see the
two lakhs in your hand?

1510
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:04,633
l want to see your
face too, after the game.

1511
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,179
Hey.
- Yes.

1512
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:11,179
ls Shippie here?
- There he is.

1513
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:12,377
Hey, Shippie.

1514
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:15,918
Come on, my king, come on.

1515
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:19,318
Do you know Sharad Badge?

1516
01:35:19,393 --> 01:35:22,453
He's the champion of the world.
- Be quiet.

1517
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:24,725
l was just introducing them.
- Be quiet.

1518
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:27,457
Think about it once more.

1519
01:35:27,802 --> 01:35:29,929
Sometimes the return
fire becomes fatal.

1520
01:35:30,204 --> 01:35:31,535
He hasn't lost a game till today.

1521
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:36,738
You mean till yesterday.

1522
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:38,809
Amazing!

1523
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,414
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1524
01:35:44,352 --> 01:35:46,479
Jaleel, Surya will
settle all the scores today.

1525
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:50,690
Will you shut your tap
or should l cut the water?

1526
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:53,818
Friends, lt's time to
fill your buckets everyone.

1527
01:35:55,363 --> 01:35:56,421
Laugh on.

1528
01:35:56,497 --> 01:35:59,694
Surya, they don't know
how much we laugh at them.

1529
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:00,892
But, in our minds.

1530
01:36:01,969 --> 01:36:03,231
Be quiet.

1531
01:36:03,437 --> 01:36:06,565
Hey, scoundrel, be open
about what you want to say.

1532
01:36:08,843 --> 01:36:11,243
Silent.
Are you laughing in your mind?

1533
01:36:12,246 --> 01:36:14,373
Wait, l'll give you
something to laugh at.

1534
01:36:27,862 --> 01:36:30,456
What a shot. Wow.

1535
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:43,674
That's right.

1536
01:36:54,689 --> 01:36:56,281
You're fired from the start.

1537
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:59,291
Someone shut him up
during the game please.

1538
01:36:59,694 --> 01:37:01,685
Hey. Be quiet.

1539
01:37:43,604 --> 01:37:45,538
Surya, everything is going wrong.

1540
01:37:45,806 --> 01:37:46,864
l'll be back.

1541
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:48,340
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

1542
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:50,338
Wait.

1543
01:37:50,745 --> 01:37:51,803
Stop this game.

1544
01:37:53,347 --> 01:37:54,609
l want to hear what he was saying.

1545
01:37:55,683 --> 01:37:56,809
What were you saying?

1546
01:37:56,884 --> 01:37:59,352
l need to make a call.
- Who are you going to call?

1547
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,479
There's someone.
- Listen to me...

1548
01:38:01,555 --> 01:38:02,613
l need to make an urgent call.

1549
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:03,748
l'll be right back.
- Come back here.

1550
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:04,882
Surya, take care of everything here.
- Come back.

1551
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,818
Bring him here.

1552
01:38:11,899 --> 01:38:14,959
Run.

1553
01:38:24,912 --> 01:38:25,970
Catch him!

1554
01:39:15,162 --> 01:39:18,427
What are you doing, Zaid?

1555
01:39:19,433 --> 01:39:20,491
Come on.

1556
01:39:22,970 --> 01:39:26,098
Surya, listen to me.
- Hush!

1557
01:39:31,445 --> 01:39:32,503
That's it.

1558
01:39:35,049 --> 01:39:36,175
How much further?

1559
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:41,045
l'll kill you Zaid.

1560
01:39:41,589 --> 01:39:42,647
Quiet.

1561
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,460
What are you doing?
- That's it. No more!

1562
01:39:48,929 --> 01:39:49,987
Go, get a taxi.

1563
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:54,861
Don't move. l'll be right back.

1564
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:56,127
Come back soon.

1565
01:40:02,676 --> 01:40:06,077
Zaid!

1566
01:40:10,684 --> 01:40:12,948
Zaid!

1567
01:40:13,554 --> 01:40:15,078
ls Zaid here?
- What is the time?

1568
01:40:15,556 --> 01:40:17,683
l've to close up here, and
finish chores at home also.

1569
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:19,223
l can't keep waiting here everyday.

1570
01:40:19,493 --> 01:40:21,552
Stop it. l'm here now you can go.

1571
01:40:22,096 --> 01:40:23,495
l'll close up after Zaid comes.

1572
01:40:23,564 --> 01:40:26,089
Look, l don't want any trouble.
- Get lost.

1573
01:40:27,501 --> 01:40:28,559
l'm going.

1574
01:40:29,169 --> 01:40:30,693
Don't forget to lock up.

1575
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:54,924
Surya.
- Zaid. Where are you?

1576
01:40:54,995 --> 01:40:56,257
l'm absolutely fine wherever l am.

1577
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,861
You don't get out of there.
There's danger.

1578
01:40:57,932 --> 01:40:58,990
Where are you?

1579
01:40:59,066 --> 01:41:00,192
Why didn't you come here last night?

1580
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:01,996
l'm coming, this evening or tomorrow.

1581
01:41:02,269 --> 01:41:03,531
Come here right now.

1582
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:04,866
Or, tell me where you are.
- l'll be right there.

1583
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:06,531
Don't venture out. l'm telling you.

1584
01:41:06,674 --> 01:41:08,005
Don't invite any more trouble.

1585
01:41:08,142 --> 01:41:11,270
There's no trouble.
- l'm absolutely safe.

1586
01:41:11,545 --> 01:41:12,603
l'm taking care of everything.

1587
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:13,806
l'm making a great plan.

1588
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:16,145
l'm making arrangements for us
both to get to Dubai. - Dubai?

1589
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:17,608
Why you...

1590
01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:19,550
Don't get into any more trouble,
Zaid. - Get that.

1591
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:20,678
Don't worry, Brother.
- Worry...

1592
01:41:20,754 --> 01:41:21,812
l said l'm making arrangements.

1593
01:41:21,889 --> 01:41:24,016
We'll meet later...
- Come here right now.

1594
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:25,149
l'm coming!

1595
01:41:25,893 --> 01:41:26,951
Sonu sir.

1596
01:41:27,027 --> 01:41:28,688
Didn't l tell you at night...
but still the door is open.

1597
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:33,566
Oh God, what kind of a man is he?

1598
01:41:34,034 --> 01:41:36,093
Hey. l gave you a place to stay.

1599
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:37,569
At least have some responsibility.

1600
01:41:47,047 --> 01:41:51,848
How are you, Surya?
- What do you want to say?

1601
01:41:53,988 --> 01:41:55,046
You get angry with me?

1602
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:57,651
l'm getting married in five days.

1603
01:41:59,593 --> 01:42:00,651
And then l'll leave.

1604
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:03,060
l'm not getting angry with you.

1605
01:42:04,598 --> 01:42:05,656
We won't be meeting after this.

1606
01:42:06,266 --> 01:42:07,995
Why won't we meet?

1607
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:13,869
l won't be upset on your wedding.

1608
01:42:15,009 --> 01:42:17,671
The tea vendor told brother
that your life is in danger.

1609
01:42:18,879 --> 01:42:20,608
Jaleel's goons are
looking all over Malvani...

1610
01:42:20,681 --> 01:42:22,615
...for you and Zaid.

1611
01:42:24,018 --> 01:42:25,076
God knows what will happen.

1612
01:42:25,152 --> 01:42:26,210
Nothing will happen.

1613
01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:28,085
Devi, you...
- Surya.

1614
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:30,349
Swear on me.

1615
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:33,883
You won't come to Malvani.

1616
01:42:37,364 --> 01:42:38,831
Not even for my wedding.

1617
01:42:41,769 --> 01:42:42,895
Look after yourself.

1618
01:44:03,984 --> 01:44:05,975
Hey. Where are you going?

1619
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:09,320
Take your luggage,
and get out of here.

1620
01:44:09,389 --> 01:44:11,186
l don't want you, or your money.

1621
01:44:11,258 --> 01:44:14,193
Don't piss me off today,
l'm not in a good mood.

1622
01:44:15,729 --> 01:44:18,391
Who do you think you are, you goon?

1623
01:44:18,866 --> 01:44:22,267
l told you, don't push it.

1624
01:44:22,336 --> 01:44:23,394
l don't want to hear anything.

1625
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:24,937
Get out of here.

1626
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,798
Enough of it.

1627
01:44:29,877 --> 01:44:31,071
Take everything and get out of here.

1628
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:33,404
lt's all my fault...

1629
01:44:33,814 --> 01:44:35,145
Brought home dirt from the street.

1630
01:44:35,282 --> 01:44:38,740
Didn't l tell you,
don't push it today.

1631
01:44:39,419 --> 01:44:40,477
What will you do?

1632
01:44:41,155 --> 01:44:42,747
You scoundrel,
hooligan. Will you hit me?

1633
01:44:45,492 --> 01:44:47,756
What are you doing?
- l'm a goon, isn't it?

1634
01:44:51,365 --> 01:44:52,491
Have you gone mad?

1635
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:48,210
Madhu... l...

1636
01:45:48,889 --> 01:45:51,289
You know what you've done is wrong.

1637
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:54,151
No point in saying anything now.

1638
01:45:57,431 --> 01:45:58,489
Forget it.

1639
01:46:03,437 --> 01:46:07,430
Like every evening come
and get drunk.

1640
01:46:31,465 --> 01:46:33,456
Surya? Jeetu.

1641
01:46:34,134 --> 01:46:35,192
Yes, Jeetu.

1642
01:46:35,335 --> 01:46:36,393
What are you doing here?

1643
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:38,597
To buy fish. So?

1644
01:46:39,072 --> 01:46:40,596
Don't you know about Zaid?

1645
01:46:40,874 --> 01:46:41,932
What about Zaid?

1646
01:46:42,009 --> 01:46:44,477
They hunted Zaid in
the streets yesterday...

1647
01:46:46,546 --> 01:46:47,945
...The lane, besides the flour mill...

1648
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:51,475
...slashed him with
swords and knives...

1649
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:52,609
...Chased him down...

1650
01:46:54,955 --> 01:46:57,150
...He was screaming and crying...

1651
01:47:21,048 --> 01:47:23,915
...he isn't dead, yet.

1652
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:25,109
He's still alive.

1653
01:47:25,185 --> 01:47:26,516
Lying in LM hospital.

1654
01:47:32,926 --> 01:47:33,984
Excuse me.

1655
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:38,522
Excuse me, my friend Zaid...

1656
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:01,348
He knew that this would happen.

1657
01:48:01,955 --> 01:48:03,217
You could've saved him.

1658
01:48:04,024 --> 01:48:06,151
He's here because of us.

1659
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,359
You wouldn't have
found his body otherwise.

1660
01:48:09,696 --> 01:48:11,027
lt doesn't make any difference.

1661
01:48:11,565 --> 01:48:12,691
Everyone is the same.

1662
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:16,963
He had to pay for choosing
to deal with those people.

1663
01:48:18,372 --> 01:48:19,703
Sonu didn't help him either.

1664
01:48:19,973 --> 01:48:21,031
Then he came to me.

1665
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:23,240
Filed a complaint against Jaleel.

1666
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:24,977
Be thankful that you're alive.

1667
01:48:25,379 --> 01:48:29,110
Are you trying to scare me, sir?
- No. l'm warning you.

1668
01:48:29,983 --> 01:48:31,507
You're on Jaleel's hit list too.

1669
01:48:31,985 --> 01:48:33,111
You know everything?

1670
01:48:33,653 --> 01:48:34,711
Then, why don't you do something?

1671
01:48:34,988 --> 01:48:36,114
Are you trying to teach me my job?

1672
01:48:37,324 --> 01:48:40,054
The police have arrested 12
of his people since morning.

1673
01:48:40,727 --> 01:48:41,989
He's hiding in Malvani.

1674
01:48:42,062 --> 01:48:43,256
The police are looking for him.

1675
01:48:44,197 --> 01:48:45,528
We won't let him get away this time.

1676
01:48:46,733 --> 01:48:50,999
'Farooque got a big case,
Jaleel his revenge.'

1677
01:48:53,006 --> 01:48:57,409
'And that day along with Zaid,
a huge part of me died.'

1678
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:19,157
'l came back home.'

1679
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:22,032
'Got a job in a reputed company.'

1680
01:49:22,769 --> 01:49:24,031
'Because of brother's
friend's connections.'

1681
01:49:24,104 --> 01:49:25,503
'And my carom certificates.'

1682
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:29,433
Ma!

1683
01:49:29,509 --> 01:49:31,306
Somtya!

1684
01:49:31,445 --> 01:49:32,503
You've grown up.

1685
01:49:32,646 --> 01:49:33,704
How are you?

1686
01:49:36,116 --> 01:49:37,174
How are you, Sister-in-law?

1687
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:38,376
l'm fine.

1688
01:49:39,052 --> 01:49:41,384
Your wedding photos
are seen everyday here.

1689
01:49:43,256 --> 01:49:44,655
l'm not in even one of them.

1690
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:51,121
That still hurts.
- l won't forgive you either.

1691
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,062
Get married again.

1692
01:49:55,402 --> 01:49:56,528
This time, l'll definitely be there.

1693
01:49:56,803 --> 01:49:59,397
Rascal! l'm very happy
with my married life.

1694
01:49:59,673 --> 01:50:01,072
Let's talk about your marriage.

1695
01:50:02,075 --> 01:50:03,667
Why are we discussing
my marriage now?

1696
01:50:05,212 --> 01:50:08,477
Get married.

1697
01:50:10,684 --> 01:50:11,810
Did mother ask you to do this?

1698
01:50:12,352 --> 01:50:13,410
Why will mother say anything?

1699
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,678
l want to discuss it.

1700
01:50:15,155 --> 01:50:17,817
And, l will ensure you
select a girl before l leave.

1701
01:50:19,292 --> 01:50:20,350
Tell me if there's someone.

1702
01:50:21,428 --> 01:50:22,486
Or else, it'll be my choice.

1703
01:50:24,698 --> 01:50:25,824
Tell me.

1704
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,172
Uncle, that's all you'll get today.

1705
01:50:36,243 --> 01:50:37,301
You'll get this tomorrow.

1706
01:50:47,387 --> 01:50:49,378
Her. Sure?

1707
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:52,119
Have l ever been
unsure about anything?

1708
01:50:54,594 --> 01:50:56,391
Her fish is very good.

1709
01:50:56,663 --> 01:50:57,721
Rascal.

1710
01:51:00,133 --> 01:51:05,127
As l reminisce...

1711
01:51:05,205 --> 01:51:11,144
...the meaning of
this evening with him.

1712
01:51:11,344 --> 01:51:17,146
Tells the story...

1713
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:22,154
...of this relationship.

1714
01:51:22,422 --> 01:51:25,823
My Krishna.

1715
01:51:28,428 --> 01:51:32,364
My Krishna.

1716
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:39,167
My Krishna.

1717
01:51:39,239 --> 01:51:41,173
My Krishna.

1718
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:00,191
Hello.
- Hi.

1719
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:05,660
ls it ivory?
- lt only looks like ivory.

1720
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:09,259
All the best.
- Thank you.

1721
01:52:16,409 --> 01:52:17,467
Ready?

1722
01:53:52,305 --> 01:53:53,636
Brother.

1723
01:54:02,916 --> 01:54:04,577
Surya, leave him.
He doesn't know anything.

1724
01:54:05,852 --> 01:54:06,910
Who did this?

1725
01:54:06,986 --> 01:54:09,454
Tell me right now.
- Surya.

1726
01:54:09,522 --> 01:54:12,719
Tell me right now.
- Surya.

1727
01:54:25,338 --> 01:54:28,330
Ma. Devi!

1728
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,938
Mangesh, stop.

1729
01:54:35,348 --> 01:54:36,406
Yes, sir?

1730
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,612
Take a left, and through Malvani.

1731
01:54:39,419 --> 01:54:41,683
l said hurry up; let's go to Malvani.
- Yes.

1732
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:58,769
Stay with Ma, l'll be there.

1733
01:55:00,907 --> 01:55:03,705
Are you fine?
- l'll be there, soon.

1734
01:55:17,857 --> 01:55:21,384
Surya, maybe, l can
never understand...

1735
01:55:21,461 --> 01:55:24,396
...what's going on in
your heart and mind.

1736
01:55:25,064 --> 01:55:26,463
But, still, l would like
to tell you one thing.

1737
01:55:27,534 --> 01:55:30,401
lts not about religion,
but about humanity.

1738
01:55:31,004 --> 01:55:32,995
When this war of
temples and mosque started...

1739
01:55:33,807 --> 01:55:37,743
...everyone here said, there
won't ever be riots in Malvani.

1740
01:55:38,545 --> 01:55:40,410
And, by the grace of Allah,
it will remain true.

1741
01:55:41,614 --> 01:55:43,411
My son lssa was present...

1742
01:55:43,483 --> 01:55:45,417
...when this
terrible tragedy occurred.

1743
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:48,750
Just listen to what he saw.

1744
01:55:49,689 --> 01:55:52,419
lf you still feel angry
at Muslims after that...

1745
01:55:52,559 --> 01:55:54,151
...then you can come
and grab my throat.

1746
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:56,626
Tell him, son, tell
him everything you saw.

1747
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:58,488
l was running too.

1748
01:55:58,565 --> 01:56:00,430
Hindus and Muslims were
running helter-skelter.

1749
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,167
God knows what was going on?

1750
01:56:02,435 --> 01:56:04,096
8-10 guys were instigating everyone.

1751
01:56:04,571 --> 01:56:06,436
Hindus were attacked
and also, Muslims.

1752
01:56:06,973 --> 01:56:09,908
But, l saw those
rag-pickers set the taxi ablaze.

1753
01:56:10,443 --> 01:56:13,037
Those three people,
who hang around near the pipeline.

1754
01:56:13,446 --> 01:56:15,107
l saw them do it.

1755
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:31,856
The rat said to the elephant...

1756
01:56:31,931 --> 01:56:33,728
Sir, Farooque sir, is coming.
- What?

1757
01:56:33,867 --> 01:56:34,925
There was a message on the wireless...

1758
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:36,992
...all Malvani teams have
been called to Gate No. 2.

1759
01:56:37,136 --> 01:56:38,467
And sir is coming here himself.

1760
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:41,196
All of you leave. l'll see you there.
- Okay, sir.

1761
01:56:41,474 --> 01:56:42,532
Go on.

1762
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:07,891
Sir.

1763
01:57:07,967 --> 01:57:09,901
Where is Shinde?
- Sir, he's on patrol.

1764
01:57:10,169 --> 01:57:11,227
ls that so?

1765
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:14,763
All of you report to the station,
and wait for me.

1766
01:57:15,041 --> 01:57:16,099
Yes sir.
- Let's go.

1767
01:57:20,113 --> 01:57:21,171
Rascals. Tell me!

1768
01:57:21,247 --> 01:57:22,509
We didn't do anything.

1769
01:57:22,582 --> 01:57:23,844
Tell me. Why did you
set the taxi ablaze?

1770
01:57:23,917 --> 01:57:24,975
We didn't do anything.

1771
01:57:25,051 --> 01:57:26,518
We were told to do so.

1772
01:57:26,853 --> 01:57:29,185
What did you get?

1773
01:57:30,523 --> 01:57:31,581
l will kill you rascals.

1774
01:57:31,658 --> 01:57:32,716
Who asked you to do all this?

1775
01:57:32,792 --> 01:57:33,850
They guys from the warehouse did it.

1776
01:57:44,537 --> 01:57:46,528
Hey. lnspector.

1777
01:58:03,222 --> 01:58:04,280
Shinde sir is here.

1778
01:58:04,624 --> 01:58:05,886
Shinde sir...
- What Shinde?

1779
01:58:05,959 --> 01:58:07,620
Listen to me.
- Just forget it.

1780
01:58:07,694 --> 01:58:09,559
Didn't l tell you before?

1781
01:58:10,029 --> 01:58:12,554
That Farooque, he asked
us to move from there.

1782
01:58:12,765 --> 01:58:14,562
And, has come into Malvani himself.

1783
01:58:14,834 --> 01:58:17,564
Look, Jaleel, it's
madness to do all this tonight.

1784
01:58:18,104 --> 01:58:20,629
You wimp why are you
shuddering like this?

1785
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:24,232
You said he's on a holiday today.
- Even l am as shocked.

1786
01:58:24,577 --> 01:58:27,102
We were standing just behind
Gate No. 2, beside the van.

1787
01:58:27,246 --> 01:58:28,577
But, he landed up there too.

1788
01:58:29,782 --> 01:58:31,909
Pick up all your stuff and leave.

1789
01:58:31,985 --> 01:58:33,577
He might land up here also.

1790
01:58:33,853 --> 01:58:34,911
Be quiet.

1791
01:58:35,588 --> 01:58:36,646
Let him come here.

1792
01:58:39,792 --> 01:58:43,785
l'll cut him into pieces
& feed him to the crows.

1793
01:58:44,998 --> 01:58:46,590
Stop shuddering like this.

1794
01:58:46,733 --> 01:58:47,995
Go, and do your work.

1795
01:58:49,202 --> 01:58:52,603
Go, and instigate
the Hindus in Sector 1 .

1796
01:58:58,144 --> 01:59:00,203
Whether it's inspector Farooque,
or anyone else.

1797
01:59:00,747 --> 01:59:02,078
There's no need to fear anyone.

1798
01:59:03,216 --> 01:59:05,616
There will be a gift
waiting for them in the temple...

1799
01:59:05,685 --> 01:59:07,209
Before the first prayers tomorrow.

1800
01:59:08,221 --> 01:59:09,882
And, for our Muslim brothers...

1801
01:59:11,024 --> 01:59:12,616
...in the mosque.

1802
01:59:16,963 --> 01:59:18,021
Understood?

1803
01:59:18,898 --> 01:59:19,956
Go on now.

1804
01:59:28,241 --> 01:59:29,970
There's no trusting
this rascal Shinde.

1805
01:59:30,243 --> 01:59:31,767
God knows whether
he'll do anything or not.

1806
01:59:32,378 --> 01:59:34,107
But, we have to be ready.

1807
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,647
Get that.
- l get it.

1808
01:59:35,915 --> 01:59:38,850
Brother, the Hindus and
the Muslims are ready.

1809
01:59:39,252 --> 01:59:40,310
They've got all the weapons.

1810
01:59:40,386 --> 01:59:41,648
All the petrol bombs are ready.

1811
01:59:42,188 --> 01:59:43,655
But the rag-pickers aren't here yet.

1812
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:45,314
Let them die, bloody drug-addicts.

1813
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:48,659
You, you take the cow in the pickup.
- Fine.

1814
01:59:48,728 --> 01:59:50,127
And, you take the pig in the auto.

1815
01:59:50,263 --> 01:59:51,855
As soon as the riots begin...

1816
01:59:52,265 --> 01:59:53,994
What's wrong with the lights?
- The fuse must've blown.

1817
01:59:54,067 --> 01:59:55,125
Take a look, what's wrong?

1818
01:59:55,201 --> 01:59:56,259
l'll take a look.

1819
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:23,213
Surya.

1820
02:01:23,289 --> 02:01:24,347
What are you doing?

1821
02:01:24,891 --> 02:01:25,949
Have you gone mad?

1822
02:01:26,025 --> 02:01:27,083
Surya, wait.

1823
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,889
Tell me. Tell me, what do you want?

1824
02:01:31,964 --> 02:01:33,829
We're of the same kind, Surya.

1825
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:37,495
Surya, Malvani belongs to you.

1826
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:39,761
Now, you're the king
of Malvani, Surya.

1827
02:01:40,039 --> 02:01:42,303
That's Jaleel's promise to you.

1828
02:01:44,777 --> 02:01:45,835
What are you doing, Surya?

1829
02:01:45,912 --> 02:01:47,777
No. No!

1830
02:02:24,283 --> 02:02:25,807
This morning in Malvani
the sound of prayers from ...

1831
02:02:25,885 --> 02:02:27,819
...temples and mosques
together is a sign that...

1832
02:02:27,887 --> 02:02:29,821
...something
disastrous has been evaded...

1833
02:02:29,889 --> 02:02:31,823
'Farooque raised many
questions in his department...'

1834
02:02:31,891 --> 02:02:33,825
'regarding the
police's role in the riots.

1835
02:02:36,362 --> 02:02:39,024
'Farooque claimed Jaleel's
killing as an encounter.'

1836
02:02:41,567 --> 02:02:43,558
'Ma says that l saved Malvani.'

1837
02:02:45,104 --> 02:02:46,162
'l don't think so...'

1838
02:02:48,107 --> 02:02:49,836
'l just saw my sister's body...'

1839
02:02:49,909 --> 02:02:51,433
'...and killed a person
in that rage.'

1840
02:02:54,847 --> 02:02:56,906
'l don't sleep the
nights l think about it.'

1841
02:02:59,919 --> 02:03:01,250
'And then, l tell myself that...'

1842
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,912
'...a lot of people could've died.'

1843
02:03:04,857 --> 02:03:05,983
'a lot of people didn't burn.'
