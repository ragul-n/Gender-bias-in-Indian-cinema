00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,530
Make way
Make way

5
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,490
How are you?

6
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,250
I am good

7
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,770
A drunken driving case
I gave first aid

8
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,730
One moment

9
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,370
Here's the patient's bag

10
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,490
What did the nurse say?

11
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,490
How is the guy?

12
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,370
Everything in the bag is safe

13
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,450
We are buddies

14
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,890
Give me the money

15
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,290
You always suspect me

16
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,930
I have mended my ways
Don't embarrass me in public

17
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,330
Here it is

18
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,650
It's getting late

19
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,890
Go on, check me, check me

20
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,370
That's my money

21
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,010
I will bite you

22
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,850
It's my money

23
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,810
Whose money?

24
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,610
My money

25
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,050
This is your money eh?

26
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,810
Listen to me, buddy

27
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,970
We saved his life

28
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,450
What if someone had gone
to the accident spot...

29
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,890
...would we have known that?

30
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,130
Taking a small amount from his bag
is not wrong at all

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,570
A outsider knows about me

32
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,930
You are my only friend
why don't you understand?

33
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,970
Just give me 100 bucks for a drink

34
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,170
You don't know how to live

35
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,850
Take all these reports

36
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,410
The lab is to your left

37
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,170
I have victim's wallet,
gold chain and ring

38
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,490
I've informed his family

39
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,410
Give this to them
Bye

40
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,330
Okay, Sathya

41
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,170
Don't feel bad

42
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,650
Come on

43
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,450
Sathya, have you started?

44
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,890
Yes

45
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,410
I will be there in half an hour

46
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,570
How's your ballon-faced Dad?

47
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,450
Don't you have any
respect for my dad?

48
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,250
Fathers-in-law should
respect sons-in-law

49
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,370
He has great attitude
He was smoking cigarette yesterday

50
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,250
Ask him to respect me a bit

51
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,450
Okay sir, you come with the same attitude
and maintain your attitude

52
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,850
Don't worry, when he sees me
He will be flabbergasted

53
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,570
Okay enough
Come quickly

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,290
Bye

55
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,410
Did you inform your mother?

56
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,210
First, let me see if her
dad likes me

57
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,530
Then I will inform my mom

58
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,690
You could have respected him
when he was alive

59
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,370
What do you want?

60
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,410
I need some money for dinner

61
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,370
You are earning more than me

62
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,010
What do you do with your salary?

63
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,250
My phone bills are too high

64
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,970
If you keep paying your girlfriends'
phone bills, this is what will happen

65
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,450
That's not true

66
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,650
I don't have cash

67
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,130
From today onwards I will change
Believe me

68
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,690
You have been saying this for years

69
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,930
Go and get drunk

70
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,170
Take this

71
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,730
You will flourish

72
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,530
Thank you

73
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,210
All the best

74
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,930
You are so kind

75
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,570
Convey my regards to
your girl friend

76
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,810
You owe my 6000 rupees, till now

77
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,090
Stop

78
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,090
- Where are you going?
- Sathya has come

79
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,290
First our Dad should talk to him

80
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,170
Till then, hold your horses

81
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,010
Come in

82
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,290
Please be seated

83
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,090
Dad will come now

84
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,410
What would you like to have?

85
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,850
He likes coffee

86
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,050
Yes, I will have coffee

87
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,810
Okay

88
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,170
Hello, sir

89
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,690
Hello!
Take your seat

90
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,650
Lord Muruga!

91
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,490
Ok, tell me

92
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,850
My daughter has told me
a lot about you

93
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,250
How long have you known each other?

94
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,530
Five years

95
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,730
What do you do?

96
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,610
I am working as an EMT

97
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,290
I am a paramedic in an ambulance

98
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,330
What is your caste?

99
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,210
Dont worry
I was pulling your leg

100
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,730
I like you

101
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,130
Move away

102
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,650
I will make the coffee

103
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,530
He looks handsome today, eh?

104
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,930
He is handsome

105
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,330
You can be proud to do such a noble
job of saving lives

106
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,810
But how much do you earn?

107
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,370
How will you manage after marriage?

108
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,850
After marriage your expenses will increase
kids, schooling etc, etc

109
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,810
I have a suggestion

110
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,210
I have various business

111
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,770
Petty shop, Xerox, Stationary and Bakery

112
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,410
You can take care of one business

113
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,850
Hey what are you doing?

114
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,410
He is my husband,
so it's okay if I taste it

115
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,850
I will go and give it to him

116
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,410
No, I will do it

117
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,810
Don't worry about the business

118
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,730
I will take care of everything,
you take care of the cash counter

119
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,930
I want both of you to be happy

120
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,250
Give him coffee

121
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,370
Take it

122
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,770
As a father I'm very happy

123
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,850
Please have the coffee

124
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,330
I need a day's time to decide

125
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,530
Who can say no to this offer?
Take your time

126
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,530
Dad, ask him to have lunch and go

127
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,450
Have lunch and go

128
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,770
It's okay
Next time, I will have it

129
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,210
I know, you don't like to have food
till you finalize the wedding

130
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,850
Not like that
I will come on some other day

131
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,810
Bye

132
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,370
Who do you think you are?

133
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,850
You think you are a Collector?

134
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,770
What's there to decide?

135
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,370
They should be worried about this marriage

136
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,290
You are destined to toil with
medicine and blood

137
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,290
'You had dinner, dear?'

138
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,210
Hello?

139
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,170
'This is your future wife speaking'

140
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,130
Go on

141
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,730
'What are you doing?
Have you had dinner?'

142
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,530
You sound so formal

143
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,570
My sister told me that

144
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,690
I should address my
husband with respect

145
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,250
'Sir, how are you?'

146
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,650
'How do you do, sir?'

147
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,250
What do you want to tell me?

148
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,650
I never thought my father would say 'yes'
to our marriage so easily

149
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,330
But why did you ask for more time?

150
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,570
That's some attitude you have

151
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,330
Wait till I get my hands on you

152
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,010
I have a headache
Shall we talk later?

153
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,490
You didn't feel like
calling me back, eh?

154
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,410
Keep thinking think properly

155
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,330
It's been 5 years now
Maybe you're bored with me

156
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,650
Just tell me it's over between us

157
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,090
Good-bye

158
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,410
"Journeys continue"

159
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,050
"The roads grow ever longer"

160
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:54,090
"I'm a bird who forgot
the route I used to travel"

161
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:01,970
"I am the curve in which two poles meet"

162
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,130
"When I travel through the desert,
the oasis makes me glad"

163
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,770
"Nothing lasts forever"

164
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,050
"This will also pass away"

165
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,930
(Chanting for the departed soul)

166
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,930
Father's name?

167
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,890
Kalimuthu

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,930
Grandparents' name?

169
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,850
Gurusamy

170
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,930
(whispering on phone)

171
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,970
I don't want any

172
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,610
What is it, sir?

173
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,810
Where are you Sathya?

174
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,210
I'm at the pickup point

175
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,050
Kailasam

176
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,730
Kailasam

177
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,930
Agasthiarpatti

178
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,410
It's urgent

179
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,890
We're going to Agasthiarpatti

180
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,770
Why?

181
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,130
It's really urgent
Patient's had a heart attack

182
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,530
I have to meet my girlfriend
I can't come

183
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,410
'Have you decided about us?'

184
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,810
Can you tell us the way to
Agasthiarpatti?

185
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,050
Where exactly do you want to go?

186
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,730
North Street

187
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,170
Is Kailasam having chest pains?

188
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:51,890
Yes

189
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,250
The ambulance can't get through

190
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,970
The road's really bad
You have to walk

191
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,770
Its near the temple,
the second house facing south

192
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,050
Okay

193
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,330
How far is it from here?

194
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,730
Not far, it's nearby

195
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,730
Okay

196
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,970
Any place to eat along the way?

197
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,730
What's going on?

198
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,250
I can't walk

199
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,050
What's wrong?

200
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,690
What do you mean?

201
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,930
We're supposed to be equals

202
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,290
Why can't you carry it?

203
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,090
Tell them the vehicle has a flat tyre
Get another vehicle

204
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,170
Or send another driver to carry this

205
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,810
Does this seem nearby to you?

206
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,450
Kailasam, Kailasam

207
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,450
Go and pick up the patient yourself

208
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,890
I'm not coming

209
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,730
Where is Kailasam's house?

210
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,650
This is his house

211
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,450
What do you want?

212
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,090
We got a call saying
he's having chest pains

213
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,370
We came to take him to hospital

214
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,530
He lives alone
Go inside

215
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,250
Kailasam, sir

216
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,130
We're from the emergency service

217
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,210
I say he's dead
Let's take this and scram?

218
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,330
Shut up

219
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,730
Kailasam, sir
Where are you?

220
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,130
Can you hear me?

221
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,770
He seems to be a big shot!

222
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,010
Sir, are you all right?

223
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,730
Where's your blood pressure monitor?

224
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,210
Where is the blood pressure monitor?

225
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,770
Sorry, sir

226
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,610
What's your name?

227
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,370
Sir?

228
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,210
Name?

229
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,090
Sathya

230
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
Your name?

231
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,730
Arumugam

232
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,330
Ambulance pilot

233
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,250
You're just the driver?

234
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,570
Why are you wearing a doctor's coat?

235
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,970
Put the BP sleeve on properly

236
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,930
Sorry, sir

237
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,410
How long have you been in this job?

238
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,290
7 years

239
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,610
How many people have you killed?

240
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:53,490
My records are in a bag in the other room
Bring it to me

241
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,610
What's my BP?

242
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,850
160 by 90

243
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,610
Give him the records

244
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,050
Bring my Red shirt from that room

245
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,970
I'm not your servant

246
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,450
I'm a patient
Please help me

247
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,570
Sir, have you ever had
a heart attack before?

248
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,770
Yes, 27 times

249
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,610
Sir, can you please be quick?

250
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm the patient, not you, right?

251
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,850
Sir, we're already late

252
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,450
I told you to bring one shirt

253
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,370
You keep asking for stuff

254
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,890
Put it all back

255
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,090
Go on

256
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,050
Come on, sir, let's go

257
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,290
You're taking me on the stretcher,
aren't you?

258
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,811
It's a long way to the vehicle

259
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,886
It would be better if you walked

260
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,850
If I were dead, what would you do?

261
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,090
But you're not dead

262
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,210
What did you say?

263
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,210
You look fine

264
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,610
That's all

265
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,010
I can't walk

266
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,930
You expect a heart attack
patient to walk?

267
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,050
Okay, sir

268
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,650
Put it down

269
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,730
Put it down

270
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,610
Lie down

271
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,530
Lie down
Go on

272
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,490
I can't lie down

273
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,170
If I lie down,
I'll start wheezing

274
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,770
Now what?

275
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,890
"Life is like tidal waves"

276
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,050
"We float on it"

277
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,090
"We sway to and fro
our whole life"

278
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,650
"Life is like tidal waves"

279
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,890
"We float on it"

280
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,810
"We sway to and fro
our whole life"

281
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,930
Vellachamy

282
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,730
I heard you saw a movie yesterday

283
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,930
'Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya'

284
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,170
It had my favourite actress in it

285
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,450
So you liked the movie?

286
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,730
Heroine is awesome

287
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,930
When you return
We can see it together

288
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,010
See you

289
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,170
Take care

290
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,410
Enough Stop

291
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,450
Come on, let's go

292
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,050
How long will it take to get
to the hospital?

293
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,250
We'll try to go as fast as possible

294
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,490
Are you all right?

295
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,770
Are you short of breath?

296
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,650
If you feel uncomfortable, tell me

297
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,010
Sir, please don't touch that
It's not a toy

298
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,650
Don't put your foot there
That's for patients

299
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,130
I'm a patient too

300
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,650
'My father treated you with respect'

301
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,610
'I don't know what else to do?'

302
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,170
Kavya, have you eaten?

303
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,770
I'm not Hungry

304
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,930
If I met with an accident,
what would you do?

305
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,810
What could I do?
I would take you to the hospital

306
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,970
You wouldn't cry?

307
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,970
What's your problem?

308
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,290
Leave it
Just answer this

309
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:54,450
What if my Dad forced me to
marry another person?

310
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,970
If you invite me,
I will come to your marriage

311
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,290
If not, I won't come

312
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:04,330
Who do you think you are?

313
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,330
Don't shout

314
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,130
Do you want to ditch me?

315
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:11,844
No one can separate us
I won't leave you

316
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,930
Truly?

317
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,690
Are you pulling my leg?

318
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,010
Eat it

319
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,570
Come on everyone, out here

320
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,330
Stop, stop

321
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,770
Don't just stand there
Bring the patient

322
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,770
Have you lost your minds?

323
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,090
Why did you stop our ambulance?

324
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,210
There's a sick man here
Take him with you

325
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,530
If it's serious,
call another ambulance

326
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,770
Don't stop this vehicle

327
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,170
Why can't you take him?
It's your job

328
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,770
We have another patient with us

329
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,170
That's not my problem
But you have to take this patient

330
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,010
The patient in the ambulance is seriously ill
Please try to understand

331
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,050
Listen to me, we can't take
2 patients at a time in the ambulance

332
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,730
You can't leave here
without taking him

333
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,130
Why can't you understand?

334
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,730
If you don't take him,
we won't let you leave this place

335
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,810
Ok, go and check the patient condition

336
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,890
This is my area
I make the decisions here

337
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,210
Any relative of the patient here?

338
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,050
He's my son-in-law
I'll follow behind you

339
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,690
Go on

340
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,890
Make way

341
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,930
Give way to the ambulance

342
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,010
Everybody get back to your business

343
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,610
How is he?

344
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,170
Hey, I'm talking to you

345
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,050
He's a piss tank,
a drunk like you

346
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,850
His pulse is normal

347
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,450
He hasn't consumed poison

348
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,250
He's as drunk as a skunk,
not to worry

349
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,850
We'll drop him nearby

350
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,930
(curses under breath)

351
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,530
Nothing to worry

352
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,330
We're going to the hospital

353
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,770
Calm down
Relax

354
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,490
I'm gonna die
I wanna die

355
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,970
I want to die
I want to die

356
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,330
Be relaxed

357
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,650
I'm gonna kill myself

358
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,290
I keep on saying I wanna die

359
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,810
Aren't you guys even gonna
bother to ask why?

360
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,690
Are you humans or monsters?

361
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,810
Doctor

362
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,490
Why do you want to die?

363
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,210
You're the first real human
I've ever met

364
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,810
You're not a human
You're a God

365
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,530
Love failure, sir

366
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,410
I was madly in love for seven years

367
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,890
Whenever she called me, I was there

368
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,570
Any time of day or night

369
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,850
I was like an ATM

370
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,850
ATMs get stuck sometimes, but not me

371
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,730
I ignored my parents and
their well-being

372
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,090
Just one look from her was
enough for me

373
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,090
I'd lay the whole world at her feet

374
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,810
Don't you have any other job?

375
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,130
What other job should I have?

376
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,490
This is my only job

377
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,810
A girlfriend should be guarded
twenty-four seven

378
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,530
Maintaining a love affair
is hard work

379
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,970
Make one mistake,
someone else will snatch her away

380
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,450
A guy came between us

381
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,690
An old curmudgeon,
exactly like you

382
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,330
I don't know where her
father came from

383
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,810
But he had long list of conditions

384
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,330
I had to have a good job,
fancy car and big house

385
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,890
Love doesn't come with conditions

386
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,450
It comes from the bottom of your heart

387
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,850
Her father ruined everything

388
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,850
Fathers shouldn't be spared

389
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,090
They'll never change

390
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,330
There should be a law

391
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,570
There should be a law that says
girls in love should not have fathers

392
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,570
Who would allow their daughter
to marry a nutcase like you?

393
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,730
Sir, please be quiet

394
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,570
Doctor, I'll solve this problem

395
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,050
Do I look like a madman to you?

396
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,490
Yes, you're a crazy useless bum

397
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,810
You're calling me a bum? Eh?

398
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,930
Okay, I'm a bum

399
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,730
Ask your daughter
why she fell in love with this bum?

400
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,530
My daughter's not as clever as you

401
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,290
But you're clever, aren't you?

402
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,810
After the wedding,
You'll be so busy

403
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,130
Producing four or five snot-nosed brats

404
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,730
How do you plan to feed them?

405
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,770
You're trying to trick me with logic

406
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,810
You should've taught your daughter

407
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,250
My dearest darling sweetest daughter

408
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:34,290
You must only love a guy who has
a good job, status and money

409
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,250
You should've taught her well

410
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,370
Or arranged a rich guy to marry

411
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,970
If you'd done that
I wouldn't be in trouble now

412
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,810
No one tells their parents when
they fall in love

413
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,010
Should people ask permission?

414
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,090
Lovers do everything on the sly

415
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,730
If I'd known this earlier,
I'd never have allowed it

416
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,490
You call me a madman?

417
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,770
Yes, you are

418
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,130
Okay, I am mad
I'm a crazy bum

419
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,090
Just watch what this madman
is going to do

420
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,410
I could kill myself by
jumping out of here

421
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,290
Go on, jump
Who's stopping you?

422
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,490
Let go of me

423
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,530
I gonna die myself

424
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,690
He's alive
Help me lift him

425
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,810
Hey, old man

426
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,850
You thought I wouldn't jump, eh?

427
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,570
Why can't you keep quiet?

428
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,370
I'm not gonna die
when you tell me to die

429
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,010
Check his leg for a fracture

430
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:48,530
But I am gonna kill myself now

431
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,610
Even if you beg at my feet,
I'm still gonna die

432
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,730
Hey oldie, I took the decision

433
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,970
I want to die

434
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,530
I'll die in front of your eyes

435
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,370
I'm gonna hang myself

436
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,570
Hold him

437
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,090
Let go of me

438
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,850
Go and get the first aid kit

439
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,690
I'm gonna die

440
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,970
Go and bring it

441
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,050
I'm gonna die

442
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,250
Find me a girl or let me die

443
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,970
Now he wants me to find
a girl for him

444
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,730
I'll run you over with the ambulance
and kill you myself

445
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,450
Where are we now?

446
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,970
The tour bus is stopping here
for ten minutes

447
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,170
Are you making fun of me?

448
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,490
You're roaming around with
a heart patient

449
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,050
Sure, they'll throw money at us
with a circus freak show like you

450
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,170
My son is a journalist

451
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,570
When he finds out how you're
treating me, you're finished

452
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,490
That drunk was a small fry

453
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,570
So we took him to a small hospital

454
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,890
But you're a big shot

455
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,330
So we're taking you
to a big hospital

456
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,850
Till then, please excuse us

457
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,010
Damn his looks!

458
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,130
What's wrong, Arumugam?
Are you angry?

459
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,690
What?

460
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,370
What's your problem?

461
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,570
You're crossing the limit

462
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,610
No, you're crossing the limit

463
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,170
Please go and sit inside, sir

464
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,970
He is a old man

465
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,370
Is this any way to talk to a patient?

466
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,490
Where are you, Sathya?

467
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,650
I'm at a dispensary in Pudhur

468
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,770
Why did you take the heart
patient to a dispensary?

469
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,770
Some villagers stopped the ambulance
and forced us to take another patient

470
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,370
Is this a public bus line?

471
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,890
We didn't do anything

472
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,450
The villagers forced us
It was a suicide attempt

473
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,290
Why didn't you inform the office?
Idiot

474
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,330
If anything happens to the heart patient?
Who has to answer for it?

475
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,130
The patient is fine, sir

476
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,810
Don't play doctor
Do as I tell you

477
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,450
Take the heart patient to
the hospital immediately

478
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,810
Learn to obey orders

479
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,490
Sorry, Sir

480
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,770
What happened?

481
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,010
The supervisor is mad at me

482
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,250
Ever since the old guy came on board,
things have been going south

483
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,890
I'll take the shortcut which
should save some time

484
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,210
What?
A flat tyre?

485
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:50,730
Yes, sir

486
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,010
Where are you now?

487
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,890
Kalyanapuram

488
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:53,970
What are you doing there?

489
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,210
Are you trying to cost me my job?

490
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,850
No, sir

491
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,490
To save time we took
a short cut but

492
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,810
Idiot, there's an accident
on the highway

493
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,450
Other ambulances have
been sent there

494
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,650
Don't know what to do

495
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,730
How's the patient now?

496
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,810
His ECG is normal, is BPs 160/90

497
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,930
He's okay

498
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,930
There's no problem for
the time being

499
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,850
Get the patient to
the hospital quickly

500
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,650
Okay, sir

501
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,130
From now on, keep me
informed on everything

502
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,170
Sure, sir

503
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,930
Sir, do you mind going
over to that side?

504
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,890
Why?
Am I in your way?

505
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,890
Do your job

506
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,690
Stand back and let me work

507
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,690
If I move away,
you'll fix that in no time, eh?

508
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,570
Why are you always on my case?

509
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,130
Who's always on your case?

510
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,370
You make all the fuss

511
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,010
If you don't know the job,
just say so

512
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,130
Who doesn't know the job?

513
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,970
You couldn't even tend a buffalo
How did you get this job?

514
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,090
Sir, please calm down

515
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,370
Is this any way to talk to a patient?

516
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,250
Is he a patient?
I know what a patient looks like?

517
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,170
Shut up and do your job

518
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,330
Are you the doctor?

519
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,610
Sir, calm down

520
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,890
Ask him to keep quiet

521
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,530
Sir, please

522
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,290
You finish the job

523
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,930
The spanner keeps slipping
I can't work with that

524
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,050
It's your job to check it all before
hand, isn't it?

525
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,130
I can't predict flat tyres

526
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,650
Call the office
Have them send another ambulance

527
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,010
There was an accident on the highway

528
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,250
All the ambulances are there
We can't do anything

529
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,570
I don't know what to do

530
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,370
How will we get there?

531
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,170
I'll go to the main road and
look for a garage

532
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,330
Come back quickly

533
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,250
Sir, please wait inside
the ambulance

534
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,170
Please, sir

535
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,810
'If you don't want to marry me,
why did you come and talk to my father?'

536
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,130
'My family has been good to you'

537
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,370
'Why are you dragging your heels?'

538
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,690
Sathya, is there a problem?

539
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,050
You've been fiddling with your phone
since this morning

540
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,450
This is a personal problem

541
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,250
I'll deal with it
Don't worry

542
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,650
Can I help you in some way?
Let me help

543
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,330
Mind your own business, sir

544
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,370
You mind your business by taking me
to the hospital first

545
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,370
Just stay calm till the driver
comes back, okay?

546
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,450
'If you get a message from my family,
that I'm serious'

547
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,890
'Don't worry, continue with your duty'

548
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,890
'You ditched me
Don't worry about me anymore'

549
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,890
(cell phone switched off)

550
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,090
Sir, what's happening?

551
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,370
Sir, are you alright?

552
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,290
Brother

553
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,050
Have you seen a tall man?

554
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,850
No

555
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,770
I am not your brother
I am Arumugham

556
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,490
Why are you crying?

557
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,530
Nothing

558
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,810
Just tell me

559
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,530
Nothing

560
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,170
What is the problem?

561
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:30,570
My boy friend told me to wait here
but till now he has not come

562
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,810
I am scared

563
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,810
Give me his phone number
I'll call him

564
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:40,690
I tried it's switched off

565
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,010
Don't know what to do

566
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,650
How does he look like?

567
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,570
He looks like you

568
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,450
Come on, I'll drop you off and go

569
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,450
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

570
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,690
Come, I'll drop you at your home

571
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,370
No need

572
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,050
Mind your own business

573
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:19,610
It's a sin to leave such a beautiful
girl in this lonely place

574
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,850
My conscience will ask me

575
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,370
Are you or are you not a man?

576
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,530
Check the vehicle

577
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,570
Ok, sir

578
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,810
Sir, there is an old man's
dead body inside

579
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,810
Open it

580
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,130
Hey

581
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,650
What happened?

582
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,490
What happened?

583
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,970
What happened, Aaru?

584
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,850
Who did this to you?

585
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,730
What happened?

586
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,210
Four thugs attacked me,
Stole my wallet and cell phone

587
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,530
Four guys?

588
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,170
Aren't you hurt?

589
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:56,970
No

590
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,090
Are you alright?

591
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,450
I am alright

592
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,330
Come on, let's go

593
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,610
I haven't repaired the vehicle yet
How can we go?

594
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,450
Come on, we'll find a way
The patient's condition is serious

595
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,010
Wear your slippers

596
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,890
Come

597
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,930
You go

598
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,570
Hurry up

599
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,490
Sir, the inspector is talking to you

600
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,930
Where have you been?

601
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,130
What is the problem?

602
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,930
We have a flat tyre

603
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,690
We went to the main road
to look for a garage

604
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,930
Is there a problem?

605
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,250
Couldn't you tell me
the vehicle had a flat tyre?

606
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,770
Why should I tell you?

607
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,490
Do I work for you?

608
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,850
He's the driver
Ask him

609
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,250
Just ignore him, sir

610
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,130
Do you have a spanner in your vehicle?

611
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,890
You drive an ambulance

612
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,610
Why don't you have the tools with you?

613
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,690
Give him the spanner

614
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,250
Sir, somebody stole my
wallet and cell phone

615
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,810
How many people?

616
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,130
A girl

617
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,530
A girl?

618
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,210
What were you doing when
she robbed you?

619
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,930
She was crying I was trying to help
But she tricked me

620
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,690
You work for emergency services

621
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,090
How can you be so stupid?

622
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,690
If you sees girls
nothing to remember

623
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,970
File a complaint at the police station
Let's see

624
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:28,770
Ok, sir

625
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,970
Tools

626
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,250
We have a thief with stomach pain

627
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,770
You need to have a look at him

628
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,570
What have you eaten?

629
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,290
No, I haven't eaten anything
I had a few drinks last night

630
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,850
For the time being,
a painkiller will do

631
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,250
It may be normal stomach pain

632
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,450
Better take him to a nearby hospital

633
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,410
Sir, if you are going to the hospital,
can you please take him too?

634
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,690
It'll take at least half an hour
to repair the vehicle

635
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,130
Kailasam sir, can you go along
with him to the hospital?

636
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,250
You want me to ride in
the police vehicle?

637
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,890
How dare you say that?

638
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,370
No one in my family has ever been
in a police vehicle

639
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,890
I called the ambulance,
not the police

640
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,930
What if this guy kills me on the way?

641
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,130
What is he blabbering about?

642
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,610
My son is a journalist
You know that?

643
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,330
So what?

644
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,250
Mind your tongue

645
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,770
What are you going to do?

646
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,170
Please calm dome

647
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,890
Hey, who does this guy think
he's talking to?

648
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,250
I don't need your help
You can go no w

649
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,730
Sorry, sir

650
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,610
Let's go
Old fart's lost his marbles

651
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,410
Sir, I'll bring the tools to
the police station

652
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,850
Don't bring that old man

653
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,090
Start the vehicle

654
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,530
Watch your step

655
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,850
How are you?

656
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,490
Fine

657
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,970
I didn't recognize you

658
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,410
I am Shreeja's mother

659
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,410
You saved my daughter
when she met with an accident

660
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,290
Yes, now I remember
How is your daughter?

661
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,090
She's fine

662
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,210
What are you here for?

663
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,570
I'm not well

664
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,410
I came for a check-up

665
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,690
Shall we get moving?

666
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,850
Bye

667
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,210
One moment

668
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,210
Please give me some candies

669
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,050
Why?

670
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,530
Come on
Give them to me

671
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,650
Tell your daughter these are from me

672
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,530
Sure

673
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,130
What's the problem here?

674
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,450
He vomited once, during the trip

675
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,530
I gave him Emicet and Pan

676
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,530
His ECG, normal sinus rhythm

677
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,210
BP is 160/90

678
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,730
I think it's fine for his age

679
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,570
Okay, fine

680
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,530
It's not fine

681
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,490
Why?

682
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,530
Who's the doctor here?

683
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,450
I am

684
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,730
Then you do the diagnosis

685
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,490
Okay

686
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,010
I've checked your medical records

687
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,530
They're fine

688
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,290
Did you come alone?

689
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,090
Yes

690
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,810
Why is there no one with you?

691
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,170
My son is really busy

692
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,210
Too busy to accompany his father?

693
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,050
He's a Journalist

694
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,770
Can you please raise your hand?

695
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,490
Can you please raise your right hand?

696
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,890
Higher, raise it higher

697
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,330
Up, up, higher

698
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,210
Raise it higher

699
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,290
Okay, lower it

700
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,210
You're okay

701
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,050
Nothing to worry about

702
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,650
You are fine

703
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,090
Be brave

704
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,890
I suggest you have a CT scan

705
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,450
We're not equipped for that here

706
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,410
You have to go to the city hospital

707
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,130
You have to go to the city hospital

708
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:00,890
Be brave

709
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,850
I'm not deaf, Doctor

710
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,690
What happened?

711
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,130
Accident on the highway

712
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,610
Let me have a look at him

713
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,290
Any other casualties in the accident?

714
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,690
The others are fine

715
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,530
Give him first aid

716
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,930
Take him carefully

717
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,810
Please wait here
I'll be back

718
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,570
Sathya, come

719
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,290
I've met this man before
and seen his files

720
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,330
He has chronic kidney
disease and diabetic

721
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,810
He's not taking
the medicines properly

722
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,770
He should be admitted to hospital

723
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,450
Inform his family as
soon as possible

724
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,170
His condition is serious
Take care of him

725
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,130
Hey, buddy!

726
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,530
What's with your girlfriend?

727
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,930
She has a real attitude problem

728
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:57,970
Why?
What happened?

729
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,130
You go and ask her

730
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,090
Where did you see her?

731
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,250
I saw her in the pharmacy

732
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,330
I'll be right back

733
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,330
So she avoided you
completely, did she?

734
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,130
Yes, sir

735
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,090
Who is Kavya?

736
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,170
She's Sathya's girlfriend

737
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,730
What's your business with her?

738
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,490
Are you in love with her?

739
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,370
Watch what you're saying
She's like a sister to me

740
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,410
I know you're in love with her

741
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,810
I can negotiate with Sathya for you

742
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,650
Shall I?

743
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,330
Yes, I like her,
but she loves him

744
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,970
What's the problem between them?

745
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,370
Tell me what the problem is?

746
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,530
Why do you want to know?

747
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,130
Tell me

748
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,210
If I don't tell you,
will your brain explode?

749
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,490
I won't tell you

750
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,250
Please tell me

751
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,250
Just tell me

752
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:18,130
His father-in-law asked him to quit
this job and join the family business

753
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,290
He's really angry

754
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,130
He and his girlfriend had a fight over this

755
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:24,010
This is more than enough

756
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,970
I'll make sure
you get her

757
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,970
Two minutes
I need to talk to her

758
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,170
Kavya, come with me

759
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,850
I want to talk to you
Kavya, come

760
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,690
What's your problem?

761
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,410
I came with my sister for
her check-up

762
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,050
I have to leave now

763
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,250
Why did you switch off your phone?

764
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,090
I came with my sister
for her check-up

765
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,370
I have to leave now

766
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,930
Why are you sending me
all the stupid text messages?

767
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,850
- I have to take my sister
- Stop it

768
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,690
Go...go with your sister

769
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,650
If you've made a decision,
please inform my father

770
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,810
- What is it?
- Stay back

771
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,450
- What?
- Go...go

772
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,090
Are you my friend?

773
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,090
What?

774
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,250
Are you listening to me?

775
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,250
What is it?

776
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,810
Don't believe anything
that man says

777
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,770
Sathya

778
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,690
Come here

779
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,890
- Let's go
- Where?

780
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,410
Doctor said I needed a scan, right?

781
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,050
Our job was just to bring you here

782
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,450
Ask your son to come

783
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,370
We'll update him, and leave

784
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,370
Call him

785
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,170
My son has gone abroad
He can't come

786
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,890
You said your son is a Journalist?

787
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,930
Why? Can't a journalist go abroad?

788
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,810
Okay, then please call someone else

789
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,370
We'll hand you over and go

790
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,010
My supervisor is angry
because we're late

791
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,010
Would you leave your own
father like this?

792
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,810
I'll lose my job

793
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,290
Please call someone to come

794
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,170
You'll grow old too

795
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,570
You'll end up like me

796
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,690
I don't trust him

797
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,930
You sacrificed your love
for your friend

798
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,850
I brought this money
and I trust you

799
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,130
If something happens to me
my only hope is you

800
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,250
But you want to leave too

801
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,210
That's okay, leave it

802
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,050
I want to give you some money

803
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,650
How much do you want?

804
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,290
Give me as much as you like

805
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,170
I don't need Sathya

806
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,010
Come with me
and take the cash

807
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,010
Till then,
shall I keep the money?

808
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,650
How can I trust you?

809
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,210
Okay, then take what you want

810
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,330
Okay

811
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,850
How many times have I
told you not to take bribes?

812
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,050
You have no pay
at least Rs.100

813
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,450
Why do you destroy the good
that comes my way?

814
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,650
Idiot! He's trying to manipulate you

815
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,010
He'll do anything

816
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,530
He seems like a good man

817
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,410
Thief...thief
He is taking away the money

818
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,290
Thief...thief
Catch him

819
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:16,370
Don't worry, sir
We'll find the thief

820
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,050
Just sign here

821
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,610
When you cheat someone
God will cheat you in a bigger way

822
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,290
I lost some money
and a cheap cell phone

823
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,930
But you lost fifty thousand rupees

824
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,330
From now on,
try to reform

825
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,770
Come on,

826
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,610
I'll drop you at the hospital

827
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,050
Don't worry

828
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,730
I'll manage

829
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,690
No problem

830
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,850
I'll drop you off
and then go

831
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,850
Where are you taking him?

832
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,810
We'll drop him off at
the hospital and go

833
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,450
Haven't you suffered enough?

834
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,250
If the supervisor asks,
what will you say?

835
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,050
I'll handle it
Don't worry about that

836
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,330
- Let's go
- Sathya

837
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,090
It's very lonely in
the back and boring

838
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,050
Why don't you sit
in the driver's seat?

839
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,610
I'll sit on the other side

840
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,610
What fun, we're going
on a sightseeing trip

841
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,010
You go and start the vehicle

842
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,290
You come, sir

843
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:06,850
Switch on the radio

844
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,330
That's not possible

845
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,650
It's a long way to go

846
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,650
It's boring
Let's have some music

847
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,010
No music when a
patient is on board

848
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,290
The doctor said I'm fine

849
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,730
We're only going to do a scan, right?

850
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,050
How many times do
I have to tell you?

851
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:30,690
(Music playing in the radio)

852
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,210
Why don't you listen
just one FM station?

853
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,730
"My desires never end"

854
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:49,730
"I am a river that
yearns for the rain"

855
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:57,490
"I am like the restless
waves upon the shores"

856
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:04,810
"The roads I travel never end"

857
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,810
"My desires never end"

858
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,730
"My voice never stops"

859
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,250
"My roads never end"

860
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,170
"They keep going on and on"

861
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,530
"My desires never end"

862
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:43,690
"I am a river that
yearns for the rain"

863
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,210
"My voice never stops"

864
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,210
"I am like the restless
waves upon the shores"

865
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:29,290
"I saw a wingless bird in the sky"

866
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:36,810
"I saw a moonlit night
without a moon, when I slept"

867
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:44,770
"My destiny is the road I take"

868
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:51,890
"Who can tell me where it leads"

869
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,850
"My desires never end"

870
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:00,610
"My voice never stops"

871
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:04,050
"The roads I travel never end"

872
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,770
"They keep going on and on"

873
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:35,130
"What we call the end
is not the end"

874
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,410
"End is a new beginning"

875
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,890
"All that turns to rubble
is not destroyed, "

876
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,690
"What is destroyed
can be created again, "

877
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:53,810
"Forgotten memories
and quests in vain"

878
00:59:53,850 --> 01:00:00,850
"I'll be a wave in an ocean
with no shores"

879
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,370
Stop...stop!

880
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,250
Sir, one minute

881
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,210
What happened to him?

882
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,810
Take a deep breath

883
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,330
Keep breathing

884
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,330
Keep breathing

885
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,370
Stay still

886
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,130
Is that better?

887
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,690
Fold your hand

888
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,010
I'll hold it for you

889
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,330
Let go
Let me hold it

890
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:52,810
Let me help you

891
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,090
Let's go

892
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,290
Sit in the wheelchair

893
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,170
Why? What's wrong with me?

894
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,650
I'm perfectly all right

895
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,810
Will you listen to a friend?

896
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,250
Go on

897
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:26,170
Don't believe anything he says

898
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:29,450
He's planning to trick us

899
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,290
We should drop him off
and make our getaway

900
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,370
What do you say?

901
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:35,890
Idiot

902
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,970
You do what you want
What shall I tell the supervisor?

903
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:41,890
I'll see him in the office
tomorrow morning

904
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,210
Dr Prasanna from the local hospital
referred this patient

905
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,450
Chronic kidney disease

906
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,290
The doctor requested a CT scan

907
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:57,330
The patient has been
travelling since morning

908
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,090
He's in critical condition

909
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:00,770
Who are you?

910
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,290
Emergency medical technician (EMT)

911
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,170
Don't you know you're supposed
to greet the doctor?

912
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,890
Sorry, Doctor

913
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,450
Where's the patient?

914
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,810
He's waiting outside

915
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,650
Go on Bring him in

916
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,970
Yes, Doctor

917
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,690
He vomited once

918
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,090
I gave him Emicet and Pan

919
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,530
He was wheezing, so I gave him
one ampule of Deriphyllin

920
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:33,810
His BP and ECG

921
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,810
You're just an EMT, aren't you?

922
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,490
How many times
do I have to tell you?

923
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,090
Your duty ends here

924
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,850
Go on, we'll look after him

925
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,210
I'll be waiting outside

926
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:56,730
Lift your hand

927
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,570
Show me your tongue

928
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,330
Close your mouth

929
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,930
What's the problem?

930
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,090
I'm talking to you

931
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:17,890
That's what he was
trying to tell you

932
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,850
He didn't tell you how to
do your job, did he?

933
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,250
He's been with me since yesterday

934
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:25,410
He was trying to explain
what first aid he gave me

935
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,810
You should've listened to him

936
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,650
You're treating humans,
not animals, correct?

937
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,930
Don't you know how to
behave with patients?

938
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,810
Sister

939
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,370
Take this specimen to observation

940
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,690
The doctor who treats humans
will be here tomorrow

941
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,130
He'll treat you

942
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,250
What did the doctor say?

943
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,970
The doctor wants him
in for observation

944
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,650
Why didn't she start the treatment?

945
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,050
If you irritate the doctor,
this is what happens

946
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:01,930
Who started it?
Me or the doctor?

947
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,530
Please go, sister

948
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,370
What did you do?

949
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,330
This is not a good hospital

950
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,050
We'll look for another place

951
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,130
Why?

952
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,330
The doctor has no bedside
manner whatsoever

953
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,010
And you showed the doctor
your best behaviour, eh?

954
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,050
Go on in

955
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,570
Please go in, sir

956
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,370
Go inside

957
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,530
Who's staying with the patient?

958
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,370
I informed his son.
He's on his way.

959
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:53,250
Okay.

960
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,890
Don't think too much.
Just relax.

961
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,370
What happened, sir?

962
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,370
What's wrong?

963
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,770
We're going home, Sathya.

964
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:43,730
No, don't go

965
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:46,210
Go to your bed
and take some rest

966
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,930
Doctor will come
in the morning.

967
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:50,010
You can't leave
just like that.

968
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,250
- Let's go, Sathya
- What is this?

969
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,250
Do I look like a fool to you?

970
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,210
I'm not a servant.

971
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,890
I'm not your puppet.
I can't dance to your tune.

972
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,370
What did I do wrong?

973
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,890
I gave you extra care

974
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,210
But you keep taking
advantage of me.

975
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,250
I was wondering why nobody
came looking for you.

976
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:18,730
You're a psycho.
No one's coming to see a psycho.

977
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,290
Call your son immediately.

978
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,250
I want your son
to come immediately.

979
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:26,370
Everything you say
is a pack of lies.

980
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,450
Do you really have a son?
Or is that a lie too?

981
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,650
What's my relationship with you?

982
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,330
Call your son now...now.

983
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,290
I don't care if he comes or not.

984
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,250
I don't give a damn.

985
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:46,850
I'm leaving.
Do as you please.

986
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,890
Sir, what's your problem?

987
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:17,370
Do you know
how bad your condition is?

988
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,250
I knew it four years ago.

989
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,130
I need to be
admitted immediately.

990
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,210
The doctors said I only had
six months to live.

991
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,730
So I need to be
admitted immediately.

992
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:02,370
They'll see me
through to the end.

993
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,690
What kind of treatment is that?

994
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,570
To keep me in a hospital till I die.

995
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:18,010
Anyway, I knew I didn't
have much time.

996
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,130
I decided to live the way
I want to live.

997
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,690
Shall we go?

998
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:04,290
Why did you take me
out of the hospital?

999
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,010
Don't play games.

1000
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,170
You're the one who insisted.

1001
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,010
What are you saying now?

1002
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:11,770
It's okay.
Forget it.

1003
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,090
Where are we going next?

1004
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,690
Please call your son.

1005
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:23,250
Your money has been stolen.

1006
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:25,810
If you die on my watch,
I'll be in trouble.

1007
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,330
I'm sorry, sir.

1008
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,490
Please call your son.

1009
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,770
What happened?

1010
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,330
I told you to stay in the hospital.

1011
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:49,650
Let's go back to the hospital.

1012
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,290
No, I don't want to go back.

1013
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,050
Listen to me

1014
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:59,090
If you're so scared of the hospital,
then why do you call the ambulance?

1015
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,450
If I tell you,
you'll tear a strip off me.

1016
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,850
Stop acting.

1017
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:17,770
My village is very remote.
I get really bored.

1018
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,810
When I'm really bored,
I call an ambulance...

1019
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:22,090
...go out for a spin
and return home, that's all.

1020
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,850
Sir, wait.

1021
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:28,890
You go for a ride in an ambulance
when you feel bored, eh?

1022
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,050
Hey, stop.

1023
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,930
Don't you have a conscience?

1024
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,770
So, Sathya.

1025
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,410
What about your family?

1026
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,890
My Mom is alive.

1027
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,450
Yesterday was the first
anniversary of my dad's death.

1028
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,370
Since my dad's death, my mom's
been living with my grandmother.

1029
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,370
That's it.

1030
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:56,930
Then what else?

1031
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:59,010
What else?
That's it.

1032
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,610
What about your girlfriend?

1033
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:04,850
Who told you about her?

1034
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,210
The ambulance driver.

1035
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,770
It would be nice to hear
your love story while we travel.

1036
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,570
There's nothing to tell.
That's it.

1037
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,010
An old man is asking you.
Why can't you tell about it?

1038
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,370
Mind your own business.

1039
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,410
Switch on the radio.

1040
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,170
- Stop the vehicle.
- Why?

1041
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,050
I'm going to dance.
Would you care to join me?

1042
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,410
Are you crazy?

1043
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,210
I'm going to dance.
Stop the vehicle.

1044
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,050
You're not supposed
to exert yourself.

1045
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,770
(Song from radio)

1046
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,450
I warned you several times.

1047
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,690
Are you okay?

1048
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,330
I'm Okay.

1049
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,290
Shall we go back
to the hospital?

1050
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,330
Let's go

1051
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,610
- Go...!
- Listen to me, sir.

1052
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,610
Go I say

1053
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,050
Just leave me alone, go.

1054
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:51,970
Leave me.

1055
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:54,530
Come.

1056
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:49,610
Sir.

1057
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,850
We've reached your son's house.

1058
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,250
Sir.

1059
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,570
Sir?

1060
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,170
Sir.

1061
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:02,770
Sir.

1062
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:08,010
Why are you doing this?

1063
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,170
Come

1064
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,930
Go and tell him
his dad is downstairs.

1065
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,570
First floor, his name Kathiresan,
will be on the door...go on.

1066
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:34,490
Can you talk like Sasikumar?

1067
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,690
Mind your own business.

1068
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:40,690
I like his acting a lot

1069
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,570
Do one of his famous dialogues.

1070
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:46,370
I am trying
to be a normal guy.

1071
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,330
Don't irritate me.

1072
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,210
Just one dialogue.

1073
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:00,890
Who are you?

1074
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,330
Sir, my name is Sathya.

1075
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,850
Are you Kailasam's son?

1076
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:07,810
Yes, that's me.

1077
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,210
Yesterday we got a call saying
your dad had a heart attack.

1078
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,570
So we picked him up

1079
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:14,210
We got admitted him in the hospital
but he is not ready to stay-

1080
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,570
- Is he dead?
- Sir...?

1081
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:19,010
I'm asking if he's dead.

1082
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:20,650
No, sir.

1083
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:23,650
He's downstairs waiting for you.

1084
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:26,610
He said you would come
down to see him.

1085
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,410
Let me know when he's dead.
Then I'll come.

1086
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:56,690
What?

1087
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,090
Are you...

1088
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,210
I don't know what the problem is
between you and your dad.

1089
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,250
I didn't appreciate my own dad
when he was alive.

1090
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:18,410
I feel badly that
I didn't take care of him.

1091
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,250
This is not advice.
Sorry, sir.

1092
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,970
(Mimics the famous dialogues)

1093
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,410
You are exactly
like the star actor

1094
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:09,210
You are right.
Your son's not there.

1095
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,050
Only your daughter-in-law was there.

1096
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,370
- I informed her
- Shall we go to VK puram?

1097
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:14,930
- Yes.
- Wait.

1098
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:17,010
It's too far.

1099
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:19,330
- You can't go in this vehicle.
- That's not a problem.

1100
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,130
Come here,
I have to talk to you.

1101
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,690
That's not where you live.

1102
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,290
Why do you want to go there?

1103
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,210
That's where your girlfriend lives?

1104
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:29,490
I've already told you not to
interfere in my personal matters.

1105
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,290
You went and met
my son just now.

1106
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:32,690
Isn't that my personal matter?

1107
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,050
I went to see your son
because you asked me to.

1108
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,570
You need help
fixing your love life?

1109
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:55,970
Sathya, what are you going to say?

1110
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,450
Why do you ask?

1111
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:01,730
Suppose her father kicks you out?

1112
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:06,730
Or if the girl says
she doesn't know you?

1113
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:24,090
Don't expect things to happen
the way you want them to happen

1114
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:27,290
Procrastinating won't help

1115
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:33,930
Follow your instincts
and speak from your heart

1116
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:36,770
Do you understand?

1117
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,330
You of all people
are advising me?

1118
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:46,050
Where are you?

1119
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,210
I am nearby, sir

1120
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,730
When will you be
coming to office?

1121
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,130
- I'll be there in half an hour, sir
- Come immediately

1122
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,090
Okay

1123
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:55,970
The supervisor urgently wants to
see me, I think I'll see him first

1124
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:59,170
You're not marrying
the supervisor, are you?

1125
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,450
Shall I come?

1126
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,770
I can handle it

1127
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:29,410
I didn't come to console
or pamper you

1128
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:36,770
You know my job, my character,
and how much I love my job

1129
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:41,970
In the past five years,
I've never taken a single dime from you

1130
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:45,850
I can't work in your
dad's store as his cashier

1131
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:48,450
If we can have a better life
than we have now...

1132
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,250
...why can't we go for that?
What's wrong in that?

1133
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,570
He's my dad, isn't he?

1134
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,210
Why do you have such an ego?

1135
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:58,610
It's not about my ego
I'm satisfied with what I have

1136
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,250
If you can live within my income,
then I'll welcome you

1137
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,650
Otherwise marry someone
your father chooses

1138
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,090
Nothing wrong with that

1139
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,890
Don't spoil your life
just because you loved me

1140
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:09,930
Be happy

1141
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:15,650
"Journeys continue"

1142
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:23,130
"The roads grow ever longer"

1143
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:31,410
"I'm a bird who forgot
the route I used to travel"

1144
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:39,050
"I am the curve
in which two poles meet"

1145
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:46,410
"When I travel through the desert,
the oasis makes me glad"

1146
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:50,170
"Nothing lasts forever"

1147
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:53,890
"This will also pass"

1148
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,650
What are you doing here?

1149
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,050
What are you doing here?

1150
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:12,410
I work here

1151
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,850
What are you doing here?

1152
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:18,330
Sathya went to see the supervisor
I'm waiting for him

1153
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:19,610
Sathya?

1154
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,250
He still hasn't dropped you off?

1155
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,770
What's your problem?

1156
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,810
Can I ask you something?

1157
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:34,290
Are you wicked or good?

1158
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,210
I've had the same nagging
doubt myself

1159
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:41,250
If you feel that I'm a good man,
That means I'm pretending

1160
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:44,810
If you feel that I'm a bad man,
Then I'm not faking

1161
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,570
I am what I am
So you decide

1162
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,970
You be whatever you want to be
Leave me alone

1163
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:53,770
What happened?

1164
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:55,250
I've been suspended for a month

1165
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,450
Suspended for a month?
Why?

1166
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:00,530
What's wrong?
Everything went well yesterday

1167
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:02,330
Is the supervisor harassing you?

1168
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,770
Why did he suspend you?

1169
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:04,730
Because

1170
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:09,050
He was roaming around with you
You want an award for that?

1171
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:10,890
I can talk to your supervisor

1172
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,010
If you interfere,
he'll be fired permanently

1173
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,370
I am furious with you

1174
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:20,250
Come, sir,
let's go

1175
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,210
I'll drop you at
your home and-

1176
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,530
Why can't his highness go alone?

1177
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:27,490
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go

1178
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:40,530
What next?

1179
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:45,690
Shall we go for a movie?

1180
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:52,370
No time for
practical jokes, come on

1181
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,050
I'll drop you at your house

1182
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:39,890
What did my son say?

1183
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:42,330
Sir?

1184
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,770
You went and met my son
What did my son say?

1185
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:51,090
Your son wasn't there

1186
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,850
I spoke to your daughter-in-law

1187
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:02,330
My daughter-in-law
passed away two years ago

1188
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:06,970
What did my son say?

1189
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:16,770
That guy is no father to me
He's not even a human being

1190
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:20,330
I'll come and see him
after he's dead, is that it?

1191
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,170
That's exactly what I told my father

1192
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,450
My father told his
father the same thing

1193
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,650
My son's old age
will be different

1194
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:41,970
He wanted this to end with him
He decided not to have kids

1195
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,090
Your medical records

1196
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,770
I'm leaving

1197
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:23,570
If you need anything, call me

1198
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:27,250
Take care of your health

1199
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,570
- See you
- Okay, sir

1200
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:43,930
Sir

1201
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,730
Take care of your health

1202
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,530
Bye

1203
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,370
Why are you following me?

1204
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:52,930
Just because

1205
01:31:34,629 --> 01:31:38,450
Sir, you know his nature
Please go in and talk to him

1206
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:14,290
I went to your house
Your son wasn't there

1207
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,730
Where is he?

1208
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:21,650
He comes, fights and leaves

1209
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:25,370
Your son started the fight? eh?

1210
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,370
Yes

1211
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:35,210
My son shouldn't teach me, how to pee
I am his dad

1212
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,970
How's your girlfriend?

1213
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,810
She told me to stay away from you

1214
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:10,770
She invited me to choose
our wedding invitation designs

1215
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:44,010
I've had another heart attack
I'm on the way to the hospital

1216
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:46,690
I'm on duty

1217
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:50,490
I'll come and see you
at home this evening

1218
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:15,650
What next?

1219
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:19,330
"I don't even know what I want"

1220
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:22,850
"I don't even know what I need"

1221
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:24,730
"I am just looking, looking"

1222
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,930
"I don't get anything"

1223
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:30,650
"Somebody tell me where to stand"

1224
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:36,050
"Somebody tell me where to stand"

1225
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:41,890
'Listen, he is going to give a message'

1226
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,610
"Then what?"

1227
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:03,530
"Go straight and take left and turn right"

1228
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:06,650
"There will be a tall pillar"

1229
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,730
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"

1230
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:13,250
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"

1231
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,250
'Help, help'

1232
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:17,290
'Then what?'

1233
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:20,130
"Go straight and take left and turn right"

1234
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:23,530
"There will be a tall pillar"

1235
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:26,490
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"

1236
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:29,730
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"

1237
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,850
'Then what?'

1238
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,010
'Well done'

1239
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:00,770
'Listen carefully'

1240
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:03,650
'Life is a tale, told by an idiot'

1241
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:07,210
'Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'

1242
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:10,570
"Go straight and take left and turn right"

1243
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:13,770
"There will be a tall pillar"

1244
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,690
"If you go straight,
You will find a temple"

1245
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:20,010
"There is a movie theatre
on the south side of the temple"

1246
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:21,450
'Then what?'

1247
01:36:59,010 --> 01:36:59,890
'Then what?'

1248
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,850
'Then what?'

1249
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:11,690
I am a mistakenly born mistaker
I always makes mistakes

1250
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:13,530
I never make yes takes

1251
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:16,330
I thought you are going
to convey a message

1252
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:17,210
Message?
