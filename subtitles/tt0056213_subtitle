4
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:38,863
Saurabh, Sukhiram Come soon.
The gentleman came.

5
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:50,238
- Hello, Master.
- Welcome.

6
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,702
So Narayan.  How is the harvest?

7
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,863
Sir, when your heart is
golden, so are your fields.

8
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,422
Doesn't gold grow?

9
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,863
Well, Narayan, when
the harvest is over.

10
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,707
Send one hundred sacks
of grain to Ramnagar.

11
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,485
I'm opening an orphanage there.

12
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:09,655
- Sir.
- What's the matter, Madhav?

13
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,447
There is a message, sir.

14
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,492
Madhav, your young
master is coming tonight.

15
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,256
Take the cart and go to
the station at nine tonight.

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,380
- Sir, I'm going to eight.
- Why is that?

17
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:25,680
Sir, this is monsoon season.

18
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,604
Reaches quickly due
to slipping on rails.

19
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,655
You're a joker.  Come and sit down.

20
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,447
God wants to give
this master my life too.

21
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,710
He released me from prison.

22
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:43,125
He saved me when I
tried to commit suicide.

23
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:46,128
Give me a plot of land to live in...

24
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,485
... sent my daughter to town to study.

25
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:51,281
Who in the world today
is helping so much?

26
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,412
Of course he is a god to me.

27
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,816
To Basantpur, a
third class ticket.

28
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,650
The train is about
to leave.  Hurry Up.

29
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,395
Ah... this is first class!

30
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,483
pardon me.  This is because
the train started its journey.

31
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,066
I'm getting off at the next station.

32
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:37,056
But who asked you to come down?

33
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:40,389
I made a mistake and hurried into this cabin.

34
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,432
I have a third class ticket.

35
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,502
It's a cheap bug.

36
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,323
You are losing....

37
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:49,487
... if you took a first class ticket and
entered a third class compartment.

38
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,847
Why are you standing?  Sit down.

39
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:55,931
please sit down.

40
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,014
Oranges?

41
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,469
Grapes?

42
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,388
I have a sore throat.

43
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,179
But these are sweet, eat.

44
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:41,279
- Sweet, isn't it?
- Yes.

45
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,979
No, thank you.

46
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,096
- Where are you going?
- Basantpur.

47
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,763
So, we are on the same side.

48
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:55,929
- I am also going to Basantpur.
- Basantpur, to whose house?

49
00:05:56,596 --> 00:06:02,054
- To the palace.
- To the palace... to the landlord's house?

50
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,138
Why did you stand up when
you heard the landlord's name?

51
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,304
Not afraid.  With respect.

52
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:13,763
My father farms under him.

53
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,655
It was with the help of that landlord
that I learned this and came back.

54
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,634
Today my teacher training is over.

55
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:24,929
How can I sit like that
in front of his cousin?

56
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,054
please sit down.  I have
nothing to do with him.

57
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,301
I go there for a job.

58
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:35,638
Yes.  But you do not
look like an employee.

59
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,346
Don't get me wrong.

60
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:41,709
You too cannot be called
the daughter of a farmer.

61
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:44,054
The look can be deceptive.

62
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:48,346
all right.  What job
do you do there?

63
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:50,679
Occupation...?

64
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:55,009
Yes, I am an electrician there.

65
00:06:55,471 --> 00:07:02,013
I like lamp repair
and wiring and so on.

66
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,179
Take this.

67
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:42,179
Two made the same mistake.

68
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,638
A car was coming to pick me
up from the landlord's house.

69
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:07,388
I'll put you home too.

70
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,971
No, please.
This is not a city but a village.

71
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,828
When someone sees
us, everyone talks.

72
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,596
Is that so... then when
will we meet again?

73
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:18,643
It was a random encounter on the train.
This is enough.

74
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,679
- Really?
- Yes.

75
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,388
Get some grapes for your dad.

76
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,429
No, they are sour.

77
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:41,712
- The grapes are very sweet.
- No, they're sour.

78
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,888
- Sour?
- Yes.  Madhav.  You...?

79
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,489
- Yes, sir.
- Go, unload.

80
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:47,554
Okay, sir.

81
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:49,878
I feel strong after
eating grapes.

82
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:56,417
Was the train late?

83
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,971
No, sir.  The train arrived on time.  But
he was the only one who applied the brakes.

84
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,051
Madhav.

85
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:04,089
all right.  Eat dinner now.

86
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,841
Guys did you eat anything?

87
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,405
I ate on the train.

88
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,344
Why is that?  Is there a
train service with the ticket?

89
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,056
No, Dad.

90
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,767
Looks like you forgot to eat.

91
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,980
Like still on the train.

92
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:28,267
Boy, are you sleepy or
did you leave it on the train?

93
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,320
I didn't leave anything out, Dad.

94
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,351
I brought something.

95
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:38,226
Look at this.  My pass certificate.

96
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,396
What are you showing me, baby?

97
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,934
To an ignorant man like me,
the letters look like a buffalo.

98
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,226
Go, get some rest.

99
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,542
Would you please tell
me the route to Rupnagar?

100
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,904
Rupnagar cannot be reached from this side.

101
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,212
I see an image in front of me.

102
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,588
Cities should be here too.

103
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:18,487
You...?  I meant sir.

104
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,654
There is no place to look.

105
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,930
Where did you get this horse?

106
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,695
From the landlord.  This
landlord is a very good man.

107
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,120
He treated me well last night
and gave me this gun too.

108
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,029
Go hunting this horse this morning.

109
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,695
Yes, our prince is a very good man.

110
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:38,070
The prince is good,
and so are his subjects.

111
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,078
What are they?

112
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,527
So are you.

113
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,987
Remember the
Lord in the morning.

114
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,695
This is not the time for jokes.
Find your hunt.

115
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:53,519
- Someone hunted me down.
- How is that?

116
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:56,612
Someone did that to
me on the train last night.

117
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,737
An evil arrow, it
pierced my heart.

118
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,529
so what?  You know
how to repair broken wires.

119
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,987
- Repair your heart yourself.
- The heart is not a toy.

120
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,971
Yes, their own heart is valuable
to everyone, but they think...

121
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,279
- That other people's hearts are toys.
- Not everyone is like that.

122
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,156
all right.  Say whatever I want.

123
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:20,362
- Do you have that toy?
- Not a toy.  I have a heart.

124
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,362
- Does it move?
- Only for me.

125
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:24,987
Not to anyone else?

126
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,237
Your mind is a very selfish one.

127
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:29,862
I like the way it is.

128
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,991
Miss grapes, Miss grapes!

129
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,695
Why do you call me that?
My name is Gayathri.

130
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:40,904
It's nice to hear this name first thing in the morning.

131
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:43,820
Where will we meet tomorrow?

132
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:46,362
- You mean?
- Did I mean here or somewhere?

133
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,029
It does not happen here or anywhere else.

134
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:49,820
Look, this is unfair.

135
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,987
I am a stranger in your village and
does anyone break a visitor's heart?

136
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,945
That heart... who
knows what disease it is.

137
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:58,044
Only the sufferer knows about it.

138
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,612
It was a night I could not bear.

139
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,904
Do not worry.
God will save you.

140
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:05,987
What is it?

141
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:10,904
If I have been like that to my heart, there
is no one to grieve for me, you see about it.

142
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:14,279
If you have a
heart attack, treat it.

143
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,070
If you ignore it, it will not be
curable.  Do you understand

144
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:19,279
It doesn't matter.

145
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,612
- Madhava.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,612
Where is the gentleman?

147
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:28,112
- Sir, he's gone out to breathe.
- So long ago?

148
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,487
Yes, here he comes.

149
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:32,279
- Kamal.
- Yes, Dad.

150
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:33,529
Why did you go out alone?

151
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:35,432
Did you not take an employee?

152
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,813
Employee... Am I still a child?

153
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,085
Certainly you are
a prince, not a child.

154
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,154
Son of a landlord.

155
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:46,570
There should always be
an employee with the rich.

156
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:49,474
Father, is this a sign of
prosperity that should always exist?

157
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,820
- You mean a slave with you?
- Now we have real freedom.

158
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,112
- Madhav.
- I'm quiet, sir.

159
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,154
The situation of the poor was gone, Dad.

160
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,529
Going after the rich.

161
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:04,579
If this is a new world, then
this world must extend freedom.

162
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,205
The servant does not obey his master.

163
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:12,971
The young man disobeys
his elder.  Is this a progress?

164
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:17,429
Look at this.  This is a letter
from our agent in Singapore.

165
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,242
Its workers have
harassed them endlessly.

166
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,303
If the situation worsens, one of
us will have to go to Singapore.

167
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:27,471
Dad, can't you handle
it without going there?

168
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,138
The agent is very upset.

169
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,138
I have worked very hard
to make this rubber project.

170
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,763
If I lose it, it's like
losing respect.

171
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:40,721
I should have gone to
Singapore today, but the doctor...

172
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,072
... I'm not allowed
to travel by air.

173
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:46,138
Because my blood pressure is rising.

174
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,346
Why are you upset, Dad?

175
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,846
If you want to go there I will go.

176
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,846
You came back years later.

177
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,429
How can I remove you
from my eyes now, son?

178
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,179
I'm not leaving forever.

179
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,888
Let's see somehow.  Now,
take your bath and eat.

180
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,763
- Good.
- Come on, sir.  The water is boiling.

181
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,501
Only the sufferer knows about it.

182
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:24,224
The guest is right.

183
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:26,418
The arrow hits the target.

184
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:58,334
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

185
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:03,376
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

186
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,709
"Ask where the pain is."

187
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:12,768
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

188
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:17,709
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

189
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,834
"Ask where the pain is."

190
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,584
"I do not know where the
sleepiness in my eyes went"

191
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,459
"Flying at night"

192
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,626
"I do not know where the
sleepiness in my eyes went"

193
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:52,418
"Flying at night"

194
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,046
"The poor lover is leaving..."

195
00:15:56,126 --> 00:16:00,320
"... when she sees
someone else near her own"

196
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:08,713
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

197
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:13,626
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

198
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,985
"Ask where the pain is."

199
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:37,373
"Because it's on my mind."

200
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,168
"Shake like that"

201
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,418
"Because it's on my mind."

202
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:48,126
"Shake like that"

203
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:55,751
"That means I'm
someone else's now."

204
00:16:57,293 --> 00:17:04,373
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

205
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:09,334
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

206
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,584
"Ask where the pain is."

207
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,959
"When there is pain on this side..."

208
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,709
"... make sure
the reason is love"

209
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:40,168
"When there is pain on this side..."

210
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,834
"Make sure the reason is love"

211
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:51,601
"Then what is the use of love
that robs you of your peace?"

212
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:59,959
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

213
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:04,751
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

214
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,834
"Ask where the pain is."

215
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:13,876
"Someone tell me why the
place where the heart hurts"

216
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:18,834
"Do not shoot the arrow,
ask where the heart is."

217
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,084
"Ask where the pain is."

218
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:31,444
- Hello, Master.
- How are you, Narayan?

219
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,611
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes, Master.

220
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:34,770
bless you.

221
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:38,194
Sir, as you said,
I taught her well.

222
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:39,611
Of course, good.

223
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,691
When you look at her, no one
will say she's your daughter.

224
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:44,629
Looks like she
belongs to a rich family.

225
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,361
And marry her to a better place.

226
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:49,478
If you said so, it would
definitely happen.

227
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,751
"Orphanage - Ramnagar"

228
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:20,220
"Orphanage - Inauguration
Ceremony at Ramnagar"

229
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,340
Brothers and sisters!

230
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:32,056
We are all indebted
to the landlord.

231
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,673
The life of this householder
has been spent in charity.

232
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,442
This orphanage was donated...

233
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,465
... another development has
taken place in his noble life.

234
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,673
Now I invite his son
Kamal Kumara...

235
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:49,590
... to open this orphanage
at this auspicious time.

236
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:06,898
Thank you all so much...

237
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,923
... about coming to this work.

238
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,590
This orphanage was
created because of orphans.

239
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,965
I mean, about these orphans.

240
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:22,840
Orphanage is definitely a
useful thing, thank you guys!

241
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:38,974
Gayathri, listen to this!

242
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,328
Why did you want to deceive me?

243
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,921
Why did you lie to me?

244
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm thankful to have
known the truth before...

245
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:45,904
... before problems arise.

246
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,617
I'm sorry, Gayathri.
I had reason to lie.

247
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:51,451
If I had said then I was
the son of the landlord.

248
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,296
You are not afraid to talk to me.

249
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,227
Why did we need to talk?

250
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:59,800
Son of a landowner and
daughter of a poor farmer.

251
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,699
These are lies.  Love
does not have those limits.

252
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:07,400
Do not deceive me with sweet talk.

253
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,908
After all, I can never
be worthy of your love.

254
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,485
Why is that?  In what
way are you inferior to me?

255
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,442
In what ways am
I similar to you?

256
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,779
With us, your family
will be discredited.

257
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:23,783
My dad and I are joking.

258
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,603
It's good that we're separated
before something happened.

259
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,241
Gayathri you will
not believe me.

260
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,324
I will marry you.

261
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:36,486
No... no.  Do not say the word
marriage out of your own mouth.

262
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:40,449
The consequences of this
pleasant dream will be very bad.

263
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:44,116
This is your magic, your fear.

264
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:48,116
To make you believe, I make
you mine before God tonight.

265
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,741
The temple at the top of the hill.

266
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:53,366
How can this be done?

267
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:57,783
Neither your father nor my
father will ever accept this.

268
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,783
My dad kills me.

269
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:03,033
When the marriage is
over, everyone will be quiet.

270
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,158
Today, in this hot moment, so to speak.

271
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:10,824
All of that tomorrow.

272
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:12,703
You will forget.

273
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:15,701
Gayathri Do not insult my love.

274
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:18,824
Is there anything in my
life other than your love?

275
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:21,092
Do you want to see me
suffer for the rest of my life...

276
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:23,016
... keeping only thoughts about you in mind?

277
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:25,616
Should I be a joke to the world?

278
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:28,824
No... no.  I do not wish so.

279
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:33,908
But there is no other way,
right?  My mind is so confused.

280
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:39,866
Gayathri, I will be with you
my whole life.  Say yes for once.

281
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,533
Please say so.

282
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:45,783
Okay, never mind.

283
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,380
No more tears.

284
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:53,101
Laugh.

285
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:58,785
Ready.  One.  Two.  Three.

286
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,257
Should I go now?

287
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:06,074
Tonight.  Don't forget it.

288
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:12,838
Even the walls have ears.
Everyone knows me.

289
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,999
I know your secret.

290
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,279
Why are you afraid?

291
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,908
Madhav.  You...?

292
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:26,643
Laugh.  Go and laugh.
one.  two.  Say three.

293
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,408
come down.  Come down.

294
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,664
- Hurry Up.
- I'm coming, sir.

295
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:35,779
Sir, you were scared of even the smallest thing.

296
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:37,988
The path of love is full of problems.

297
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,050
Just imagine that the big gentleman
found out about your marriage.

298
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:43,561
- Then what happens?
- Madhav.

299
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:49,540
You can tell Dad.
Then I will not put your tongue out.

300
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:52,616
Sir, how can I tell
the big gentleman?

301
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,074
I too am a worshiper of love.

302
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:56,074
How can I be the
enemy of lovers?

303
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:58,496
So, you're a good boy.

304
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,279
God, you are a
witness to this union.

305
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:57,821
- There is another witness.
- Madhav, you know this secret.

306
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:01,488
Sir, I have a little
sense of this too.

307
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:04,446
I am also a person who respects love.

308
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:06,696
do not be scared.
I will not tell anyone.

309
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,349
Congratulations on your wedding.

310
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:10,768
- Where are the sweets?
- Get out of here.

311
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:18,392
Please God be pleased.
Keep everyone happy.

312
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:30,412
What kind of marriage is this?

313
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,912
No one was happy.

314
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,991
No entourage, no music.

315
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,912
Train performed the
function of providing music.

316
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,703
Those tourists became my entourage.

317
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,203
God is also pleased
with this union.

318
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,325
The night you got
married, tears in your eyes.

319
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:06,453
The mind is happy, but the eyes are crying.

320
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,987
If I have sinned, to
wash away my sins...

321
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:11,620
... with my own tears.

322
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,328
Don't say things like this tonight.

323
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:18,703
Laugh.

324
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:25,042
Ready.  One.  Two.  Three.

325
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:53,133
"Looks like the moon is gone"

326
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:57,420
"Where did the moon go?"

327
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,171
"You should not have
removed your face mask"

328
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:06,592
"What happened to the moon?"

329
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:10,842
"What happened to the moon?"

330
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:15,633
"You never had a laugh like this."

331
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:20,146
"Where did the moon go?"

332
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:40,620
"Love is so young,
the night is so beautiful"

333
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,890
"Earth stops moving today"

334
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:53,883
"Love is so young,
the night is so beautiful"

335
00:27:54,008 --> 00:28:00,572
"Earth stops moving today"

336
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:05,067
"Because I started
looking at the stars."

337
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:09,175
"Because I started
looking at the stars."

338
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:14,005
"You should not have awakened
the magic of love like this."

339
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:18,425
"Where did the moon go?"

340
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:22,633
"Where did the moon go?"

341
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:27,283
"You should not have
removed your face mask"

342
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:31,845
"Where did the moon go?"

343
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:52,508
"Lost in love, where did you go?"

344
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:57,269
"Why aren't my eyes dreaming?"

345
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,883
"Lost in love, where did you go?"

346
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:12,300
"Why aren't my eyes dreaming?"

347
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:16,776
"This is the destination of two hearts"

348
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:21,008
"This is the destination of two hearts"

349
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:25,842
"If you hadn't come I wouldn't have either"

350
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:30,144
"Out of the moon,
why is this happening?"

351
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:34,425
"Out of the moon,
why is this happening?"

352
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:39,095
"You shouldn't have
laughed like this."

353
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:43,550
"Where did the moon go?"

354
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,133
"Where did the moon go?"

355
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,675
I will never let this happen.

356
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:53,425
- Madhav.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:54,967
Tell Kamal to come.

358
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:56,838
Yes, Dad.

359
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,675
Kamal This is a question of my honor.

360
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,001
What happened, Dad?

361
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,251
Read this message.

362
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,335
Some enemy set fire
to the rubber plantation.

363
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:11,825
Great damage has been done.

364
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,835
Dad, how did this happen?

365
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:17,376
I do not know whose this is.
I'm frustrated.

366
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,668
Kamal you have to go
to Singapore tomorrow.

367
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,710
- But...
- What do you mean by but?

368
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:24,918
If my health is
good I will go alone.

369
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:28,032
I value the
Singapore estate a lot.

370
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:31,001
All the property I own today
is earned through dedication.

371
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,751
This is the Singapore estate.

372
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:36,918
Dad, can't our agent
solve the problem?

373
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,960
If the agent is so talented
this situation will not occur.

374
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:44,210
Dad, this garden must
have been lost to us.

375
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,793
We have a lot of property.

376
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:49,436
Why chase lost wealth?

377
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,210
Avoid the problem as if
you were newly married.

378
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,758
Then you were ready to go.

379
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:57,611
So why is this happening today?

380
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:01,960
If this is your command,
I'm not going back, Dad.

381
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,126
It is not an order, it is your duty.

382
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,163
You're sorry, why is that?

383
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,496
- I have to carry out my father's orders.
- what is that?

384
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,496
I was told to go to Singapore tomorrow.

385
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,955
Some enemy set fire to
our rubber plantation there.

386
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,021
I do not know what to do.

387
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:44,455
On the one hand, this is my duty.

388
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,121
You, on the other hand,
are my love, my life.

389
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:53,788
Who should I go with?

390
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:04,121
I will solve the problem.

391
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,330
Your father is now your
father, not just mine.

392
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:13,371
It is not only yours but also
my duty to obey his command.

393
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,538
- You go to Singapore.  You have to go there.
- Gayathri!

394
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,205
Are you saying...?

395
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,913
No, the landlord's niece says.

396
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,955
Your wife says.

397
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:29,288
Until coming from Singapore.

398
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,496
No one knows the
secret of our marriage.

399
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,580
Gayathri.

400
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,371
How great you are.

401
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:44,830
Your face is beautiful
and your heart is beautiful.

402
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,913
tell me.  What should I
bring you from Singapore?

403
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,871
You return safely.
That's all I want.

404
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:58,080
I will bring a symbol
of love to my Gayathri.

405
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,246
Souvenir of our first meeting.

406
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:05,330
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,968
Mr. Kamal.

408
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:16,182
I wish you success
in the work you do.

409
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:19,338
- You go and return safely.
- thank you.

410
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:26,763
- Are you looking for someone, son?
- Yes?  No, Dad.

411
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,341
all right.  Look, son.
Take care of your health.

412
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:33,668
- Yes, Dad.
- bless you.

413
00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:39,213
God bless you.

414
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:41,984
Let's go, Master.

415
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:54,779
Madhav, give this
envelope to Gayathri.

416
00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:56,532
What's the matter Kamal?

417
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,580
- Dad, nothing.
- Come on, I'll leave you.

418
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:17,950
Someone tell me why it
hurts where the heart is.

419
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:21,965
- Why, Madhav.  You look so happy today.
- Yes.

420
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,808
- what is the matter?
- No problem.

421
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,861
- What... what did you hide?
- nothing.

422
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:27,767
let me see.  Give it.

423
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:30,065
Look, what a beautiful picture.

424
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,352
The pictures of the princes are like this.

425
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:35,783
The light of my life, Gayathri - Kamal?

426
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,024
Who is the light of
Kamal's life, Gayathri?

427
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:41,105
Sir, I asked
Mr. Podi for a picture.

428
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,798
I did not tell Sir to write anything.

429
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:46,455
You are trying to deceive me.

430
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:48,133
Tell me who this Gayathri is.

431
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:50,002
That's not me.  Sir.

432
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:53,291
Tell me, or I will beat you.

433
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:57,171
I'm really confused, sir.  If I
do not, you will not leave me.

434
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:59,598
But if I do so, Mr. Kamal
will shoot and kill me.

435
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,328
I'm dying on both sides, sir.

436
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:06,682
- Madhav, quietly ignite this fire.  Tell me about this.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:07,867
I will say sir.

438
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:10,070
There were some rumors circulating
between Sir, Kamal and her.

439
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,690
It's been a while since
Narayan's daughter Gayathri.

440
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:14,462
Yes, sir.  But now those
mouths have stopped, sir.

441
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:15,806
Stopped... why is that?

442
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:18,168
Two days ago at the
temple, on top of the hill...

443
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,823
Before God, Kamal
accepted Gayathri as his bride.

444
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:22,800
What did you say,
Kamal is married...

445
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,100
... without asking me?

446
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:38,481
Hold the flute, I adore you!

447
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:40,599
Let the mountains of sorrow fall on me!

448
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:42,888
But do not let him hurt.

449
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:46,010
God give me the strength to
keep the secret of my marriage.

450
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:48,028
Until when?

451
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,683
You...?

452
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:55,201
Why is that?  Are you scared of me?

453
00:35:56,117 --> 00:36:00,514
Where was this fear
when my son got married.

454
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,642
Near the dead at night?

455
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,911
Do you know all this?

456
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,447
I know everything.

457
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:15,262
And I know that the world
does not know this secret.

458
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:20,024
Gayathri, you have
to forget Kamal.

459
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:23,518
I have to forget him...
What am I hearing?

460
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:25,225
I have to forget him.

461
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:28,690
How could this be?  God.

462
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:37,296
I have committed no sin.

463
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:41,086
By the grace of God I
found a place at his feet.

464
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:43,657
But first you need to think
about whether you are suitable.

465
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,290
You do not deserve that place.

466
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:48,185
I did not deserve it.

467
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:55,392
But the driver said he
would treat me like gold.

468
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,139
Do not care about me, but
at least care about your son.

469
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:04,422
I care more about his mother
who gave birth to him than my son.

470
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,400
Promised to Kamal's
mother at the time of death.

471
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:10,103
That I will marry
Kamal to a good family.

472
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:13,823
Then, future generations
will be proud of it.

473
00:37:14,257 --> 00:37:17,358
To fulfill a vow made
to a dead soul...

474
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:22,106
... are you going to kill
the two you started in life?

475
00:37:22,188 --> 00:37:25,817
Gayathri, to this day no
one has dared me like this.

476
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:30,166
To speak loudly and to look at me.

477
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:34,014
I am the landlord of this area.

478
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,422
You are the daughter of a farmer who had nothing.

479
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,174
When he comes out of prison.

480
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,846
Would you like to be my
niece and put me down?

481
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:46,638
Why do people point fingers
at me in front of the world?

482
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:55,083
I thought so too, do not
dare to look at the sun.

483
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:59,646
But your son taught
me that God created...

484
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,963
... that they are human
beings, not poor or rich.

485
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,900
These are just the things that tell the story.

486
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,798
He comes to his senses only after he has
cooled down from the fire of your youth.

487
00:38:09,382 --> 00:38:12,288
Someday when you have a baby...

488
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:15,369
... can't marry him
into a good family.

489
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,769
Then even Kamal regrets...

490
00:38:17,854 --> 00:38:19,928
... about the mistake he made.
Then he will start to hate you.

491
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,567
The world blames you.
Then you will understand too.

492
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:26,411
Love is only a worldliness.

493
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,573
And your dad still
doesn't know about this.

494
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,241
If he knew his philanthropist
did this to you...

495
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:38,575
... that humble man
commits suicide out of shame.

496
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:41,392
Then poison me
with your own hands.

497
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,702
But I can not forget him.

498
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,197
Poison...?  I can kill you
with my own hands if I want to.

499
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:54,902
But I'm not a devil, I'm a
human being, I'm helpless too.

500
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:58,410
The rules of society are like swords.

501
00:38:58,808 --> 00:39:02,244
They will never forgive those who
want to be removed from society.

502
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,113
But especially the so-called
leaders of the society are forgiven.

503
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:12,368
Gayathri, I beg you...

504
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:14,641
... to protect my reputation.

505
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,063
What do you think, Gayathri?

506
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:23,388
If you do not stop.

507
00:39:24,023 --> 00:39:26,881
I have no choice
but to commit suicide.

508
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:33,486
"Gayathri, the landlord
is not just our master"

509
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,118
"He is like our God."

510
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:38,311
"Does anyone betray his God?"

511
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:41,225
"Would you like to
take my master's life?"

512
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:42,993
No... no.

513
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:45,295
"You are the cause of my father's death"

514
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:48,349
"My reputation in the eyes of the community
has been tarnished by your marriage."

515
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:51,517
"I do not know
when I married you."

516
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,659
"I will give my life
for my self-respect"

517
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:57,213
"I wish you were not
born into my family."

518
00:39:57,657 --> 00:40:00,627
"A child is expected to
bring honor to his parents"

519
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:01,943
"Not to bring shame"

520
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,699
"If you do not move"

521
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,603
"I have no choice
but to commit suicide"

522
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:09,687
"I'm from a good family, but
people think I'm unworthy."

523
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:11,621
"Nobody likes to associate with me"

524
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:15,320
"If you had not come into my
life, this would not have happened"

525
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:19,790
"Gayathri you destroyed
me. You destroyed me"

526
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,872
Sir, nothing will happen to you.

527
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:32,228
I will forget that I am
his wife.  I swear to God.

528
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:35,617
After today I will not tell anyone
to hear, that it is your niece.

529
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:39,626
But when Kamal comes
back you will forget all this.

530
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,853
You will tell him...

531
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:44,725
... that I did this at my insistence.

532
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:48,642
This promise of yours will fall
like a straw from the storm of love.

533
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:53,549
If you still can not believe...

534
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,563
... I promise my
husband's life...

535
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:59,563
... there is no hindrance to your son's
life.  I have been silent all my life.

536
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:13,560
Gayathri, you have
given me my honor, child.

537
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:16,324
Tell me what you want.

538
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:21,879
Price... Price for something like this!

539
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:25,323
Can't pay, even
God can't pay it.

540
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:28,999
Sir, if you would like to give me something...

541
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,126
... bless my head...

542
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:38,577
... like father-in-law
blessing his daughter-in-law.

543
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:41,030
My child, God protect you.

544
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:03,732
- Gayathri.  Gayathri.
- Yes, Dad?

545
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:07,571
Looks like you changed.
What's wrong with my baby?

546
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,334
Nothing, Dad.

547
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:12,870
I once discussed you.

548
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:15,259
- For marriage with the landlord.
- With the landlord?

549
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:17,604
Yes.  Do you know what he said?

550
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:22,547
He said that children today are
more sensitive than their parents.

551
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:28,480
- When did you meet the landlord?
- A few months ago.

552
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:32,021
Why is that?  If you have an
idea about marriage in your mind...

553
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:33,257
... tell me, baby.

554
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:39,110
I know there is
something bothering you.

555
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:41,284
It will be known anyway.

556
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:54,264
What happened to Gayathri?

557
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:59,339
Brother Narayan, come here.

558
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:01,728
Why this?

559
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:06,931
What has happened to my child?

560
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,136
Nothing to worry about, brother Narayan.

561
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:12,575
- You're going to be a grandfather.
- What nonsense?

562
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,232
Why are you fighting with me?

563
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:16,612
Ask your daughter because she is unmarried.

564
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:18,991
- Where did she get this gift?
- Keep quiet.

565
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,193
Gayathri, what am I hearing?

566
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:27,711
Get up.  If you want to
die, go home and do it.

567
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:32,486
She fainted.  This is being talked
about in every household in the village.

568
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,655
People say that she brought
these sins from the city.

569
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:39,315
Madhav, don't you dare talk about this.

570
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:41,648
Yes, I will not tell anyone.

571
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:45,265
But sir, the reputation of
poor Narayan is now tarnished.

572
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:47,382
Why did you not die when you were born?

573
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,928
father!

574
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:55,491
Gayathri I never dreamed
you were like this...

575
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:57,539
... that my face was muddy.

576
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,384
What were my expectations?

577
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:03,649
To make you aware and
to marry into a good family.

578
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,232
It's all over.

579
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:11,621
A child is expected to
bring honor to his parents.

580
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:13,416
Not to bring shame.

581
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:17,297
I wish you had poisoned
me and killed me.

582
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:20,282
- father!
- Your father is dead.

583
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:22,710
Tell me this first.

584
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:25,556
Who is this sinner who
stole my happiness?

585
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:29,974
Who harmed my reputation?
tell me.

586
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,065
Why don't you tell me?
Why are you silent?

587
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:41,053
Won't you tell me?

588
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,756
I went to jail once
for doing nothing.

589
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:50,143
This time I'm going to jail
for cutting my daughter's neck.

590
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,101
What are you doing here?

591
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:58,898
Sir, I'm a beggar.
I'm doomed, sir.

592
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:03,769
Be patient Narayan.
I have heard it all.

593
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:08,840
Sir, the poor have no wealth, but...

594
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:11,350
... he only has respect.

595
00:45:11,531 --> 00:45:13,689
Today it is dirty too.

596
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,914
Now end my sorrow with your own hands.

597
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:21,562
Don't get angry Narayan.  Get up.  What
should have happened has already happened.

598
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:25,492
Sir, more is happening...

599
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:28,297
... she refuses to say his name.

600
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:32,953
If he tells me his name once,
I will tell him, his father and...

601
00:45:33,035 --> 00:45:35,804
... his whole family, like a rooster...

602
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,077
Narayan.

603
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:43,197
Sir, you ask her, maybe
she will tell you his name.

604
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:52,022
Dad has no respect.

605
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:54,000
I hope you...

606
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:57,186
This is a noble man, sir.

607
00:45:57,357 --> 00:45:59,282
Not going to another house.
But come here.

608
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:01,450
Tell him his name.

609
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:04,727
He will use his influence to
make this marriage happen.

610
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:07,519
The gentleman does it.

611
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:18,109
Why not talk?

612
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:23,056
Narayan, calm down.  Come here.

613
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:30,314
I know you can
not stand this shock.

614
00:46:31,043 --> 00:46:35,527
Now there is only one thing
to do.  Give me any help I can.

615
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,744
You take Gayathri and leave this village.

616
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:45,458
Gentlemen, I am
ready to leave this world.

617
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:47,037
What do you mean, Narayan?

618
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:50,832
Kids make mistakes.  So now
try to get somewhere out of here.

619
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:57,241
Take care of her.  She
should have no problems.

620
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,260
Do you understand

621
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:31,894
Mom... Mom!

622
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:56,311
What is the fate of you
who came to this evil world?

623
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,394
You will not live in peace and will
not allow your mother to live in peace.

624
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,519
You are the living symbol of sin.

625
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:08,894
You are the living symbol of sin.

626
00:52:25,453 --> 00:52:27,116
No one is visible.

627
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:29,408
You always look like an idiot.

628
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:32,575
People leaving children...

629
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:33,858
... looking forward to meeting us?

630
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,325
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Come on.

631
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,655
father.

632
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:09,283
Where is my baby dad?

633
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:16,283
He's dead, baby.

634
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,616
No, no.

635
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:34,427
Gayathri, I will see you
tomorrow at this time.

636
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,421
I want to tell you beautiful
stories from abroad.

637
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,979
You will laugh a lot.

638
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:44,521
Until tears came to those eyes.

639
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:58,144
Dad, is the baby dead?

640
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:01,138
Yes, my child.

641
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,750
Did you bury it in the ground?

642
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:09,456
Yes.

643
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:12,594
You dug deep into the earth, didn't you?

644
00:54:15,945 --> 00:54:17,406
Yes, my child.

645
00:54:18,831 --> 00:54:26,580
You did well.  My son is
in the depths of the earth.

646
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:31,556
Can't say harsh words
in a cruel world now...

647
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,691
... reach for his ears.

648
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:42,124
He was such a good
boy, he hid himself.

649
00:54:42,473 --> 00:54:45,791
Because of my mother's sins, I was born and went away.

650
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:48,832
Enough, Gayathri has.

651
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:56,291
Why are you crying, Dad?
If he were alive we would have to cry.

652
00:54:57,424 --> 00:55:00,082
People laugh when a baby is born.

653
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:03,166
We should laugh
at his death, Dad.

654
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:05,541
We should laugh at his death.

655
00:55:05,621 --> 00:55:06,874
Laugh, celebrate.

656
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:14,082
I thought the problem would not
be solved in two or three years.

657
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:16,122
- You solved it in a year.
- Yes.

658
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,267
You could have stayed a few more days.

659
00:55:18,347 --> 00:55:19,889
As soon as it was over I came back.

660
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:21,597
Okay, come on.

661
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:24,494
The agent wrote...

662
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:26,991
Dad, I'm so tired right now.

663
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:29,407
I would like some rest.

664
00:55:29,487 --> 00:55:32,922
- Yes, have something to eat and drink and get some rest.
- Come with me.

665
00:55:33,648 --> 00:55:37,735
- Madhava.
- Yes.

666
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:47,940
Sir, is it for me?

667
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:54,995
Sir, what is this?

668
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:58,357
This is a necklace.
I brought it for Nona.

669
00:55:58,604 --> 00:55:59,686
That's beautiful, isn't it?

670
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:05,524
Madhava, why are
you quiet, Gayathri well?

671
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,607
- Did you tell her about my arrival?
- How can I tell her?

672
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:10,149
Why is that?  Isn't she here?

673
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:12,253
It would be nice if she was not in this world.

674
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:14,399
Madhava, what are you saying?

675
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:18,107
Mr., she was
about to give birth.

676
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,621
It was rumored throughout the village
that she had an affair with someone.

677
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:22,906
Madhav.

678
00:56:23,649 --> 00:56:26,190
Kill me if you
want, but that's true.

679
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:29,065
Because of this she left the village.

680
00:56:29,194 --> 00:56:33,174
Sir, if she said your name,
the family honor would be over.

681
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:37,315
No, my Gayathri cannot be like this.

682
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:39,274
This is all a lie.

683
00:56:40,785 --> 00:56:43,322
tell me.  Where is she

684
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:46,440
Sir, I have heard that
she is in Ramnagar.

685
00:57:15,634 --> 00:57:21,431
Sir, someone had left this
child here on a stormy night.

686
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:22,964
From then on the baby cries constantly.

687
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:26,033
It's amazing he's quiet when you see him.

688
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:33,222
Sir, I have heard the
people of Ramnagar say...

689
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:35,756
... that Mr. Narang was here.

690
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,396
With his daughter
Gayathri a few days ago.

691
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,926
Gayathri gave birth to a fatherless child.

692
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:45,578
Then the child died.

693
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:49,745
Sir, why are you worried
about them?  forget it.

694
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:03,460
"Someone tell me why the
pain is where the heart is"

695
00:58:11,973 --> 00:58:16,235
"What happened to the moon?"

696
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:20,483
"What happened to the moon?"

697
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:25,038
"Never laughed
like this before."

698
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:28,706
"It's a random encounter on the train. This is enough."

699
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:35,024
Where r u  Come
and tell me the truth.

700
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:40,456
"The baby she gave birth to
is yours. Why did you do that?"

701
00:58:40,536 --> 00:58:43,997
"Can't she tell the world, why?"

702
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:51,081
"If she's chaste, why
did she not wait for you?"

703
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,789
"Why did she run away?
She changed your life."

704
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:58,122
"Now look, the whole
world is laughing at you."

705
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:05,914
all right.  I'm sure
we'll meet someday.

706
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:15,124
Daughter, get down carefully.

707
00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:21,458
It's all God's game.

708
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:24,249
He takes us wherever He wills.

709
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:28,412
Mr. Ram will at least give
me a job as a gardener.

710
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:33,291
His address is on
the alert, isn't it?

711
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:35,708
- Yes, Dad.
- Come on.

712
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,357
- Kamal.

713
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:47,357
- Yes, Dad.
- Even if you come back from Singapore...

714
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:50,152
... you were not at home.

715
00:59:50,346 --> 00:59:52,430
I look after you all the time.

716
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,305
- Son, what's the difference?
- Nothing, Dad.

717
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:59,346
Listen Kamal.  You know
about the Ramnagar contractor.

718
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,938
He is my friend.

719
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,221
You marry his daughter.
I like that.

720
01:00:05,638 --> 01:00:07,055
marriage...

721
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:09,508
- Is getting married the biggest thing?
- Kamal?

722
01:00:09,766 --> 01:00:14,346
I see marriage as a fraud
and women as cheaters.

723
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:16,930
I do not want any
cheaters in my life.

724
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,180
Kamal, son of Kamal!

725
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:08,596
God, this tree is big.

726
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:12,360
In the same way, my grandson must have grown up.

727
01:03:59,824 --> 01:04:02,148
Get off the ball carefully.

728
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:14,024
Mercy is another name for God.

729
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,877
We should always
feel sorry for the poor.

730
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:18,842
Shyam we are poor, then how...

731
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:21,179
... do we feel sorry for others?

732
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:24,842
There are probably poorer
people in the world than we are.

733
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:28,612
Shyam we play.  Why hang
out with this Cora every day.

734
01:04:28,692 --> 01:04:32,602
Bahadur, to those who insult by saying kora...

735
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:34,800
... God punishes.

736
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,047
In what book is all this written?

737
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,967
One day God told me in a dream.

738
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:42,217
But Daddy told me...

739
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:44,262
... to tell Cora that name.

740
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:45,884
Fool, get out of here!

741
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:49,124
- Your father is an idiot.
- You called my father an idiot, didn't you?

742
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,100
Now only one of
your legs is broken.

743
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:52,660
I break the other leg too.

744
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,217
Bahadur, do not hit the ball.
He is an orphan.

745
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:59,285
We should feel sorry for the orphans.

746
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:02,259
Do not try to teach me a lesson.
You called my dad an idiot.

747
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:06,130
Bola, are you injured?

748
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,009
Get up, get up.

749
01:05:09,675 --> 01:05:12,422
Bahadur, is it brave to
attack a disabled person?

750
01:05:12,634 --> 01:05:15,387
- You're a bad boy.
- I'm not bad, you are.

751
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,717
- Even your mother is a bad woman.
- Bahadur, what do you mean?

752
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:19,755
When you need...

753
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:23,054
- If you insult my mother...
- Really?

754
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:25,884
Do you love your mother so
much?  If she's a good girl...

755
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,634
... will she drop you off at an
orphanage on a stormy night?

756
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:32,146
Did you see me
leaving my mother here?

757
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:35,345
- My father saw it.
- Then why did he take me to my mother...

758
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:37,762
-... not returned?
- How do I know...

759
01:05:37,842 --> 01:05:39,117
... go and ask Dad.

760
01:05:39,259 --> 01:05:41,012
I know everything
you said was wrong.

761
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:43,384
Why is mom leaving me here?

762
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:46,679
I'm sure someone stole
me and brought me here.

763
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:48,762
I'm sure my mom is a good woman.

764
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:51,839
If she's so good, why does
she not come to see you here?

765
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:54,887
He must have thought I was dead.

766
01:05:54,967 --> 01:05:58,134
Who knows.  Poor
thing she's dead.

767
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:01,414
She is not poor.  She is a bad
woman.  A very bad woman.

768
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:03,619
Don't you dare call
my mom a bad girl.

769
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:05,360
She is a bad woman.
A very bad woman.

770
01:06:05,384 --> 01:06:09,249
- do not say that.
- I say that.

771
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:12,781
Give up.  Stop the fight.
do not say that.

772
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:18,330
Child, it is very bad to quarrel with someone.

773
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,925
Is it right to insult someone's
mother?  Tell me, Grandpa.

774
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:28,842
You called me Grandpa.
My child.  Your story is so sweet.

775
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:36,509
- Baby, what's your name?
- My name is Shyam.

776
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:42,009
Shyam... This name was
given by the guardian of orphans.

777
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,198
- It does not belong to an orphan.
- Grandpa, you...

778
01:06:47,342 --> 01:06:49,258
... are you crying or did you feel sorry for me?

779
01:06:49,783 --> 01:06:53,169
Yes, you are a perfect example of compassion.

780
01:06:53,438 --> 01:06:57,375
Look, I'll give you sweets.

781
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:06,420
Not just sweets.
There's a toffee.

782
01:07:06,509 --> 01:07:10,095
Bola, you get one, I'll get one.

783
01:07:10,175 --> 01:07:14,252
- Get a grandfather.
- No, baby, you take mine too.

784
01:07:14,506 --> 01:07:17,842
No, Grandpa.  Everything has to be shared and eaten.

785
01:07:18,021 --> 01:07:23,679
When I say 1, 2, 3 the
toffee should be in the mouth.

786
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,289
1,2,3 OK.

787
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:32,304
Grandpa, the school bell rang.  we are going.

788
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:35,717
Bola take this.
You come in slowly.

789
01:07:43,175 --> 01:07:45,789
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

790
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:54,134
By your grace my
grandson is well.

791
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:57,342
God, you have
seven grandchildren.

792
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:03,675
Sir, today is my
grandson's haircut festival.

793
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:07,467
- Please help me.
- You even have a grandson.

794
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:11,148
- Madhav.
- Yes sir.

795
01:08:11,228 --> 01:08:14,419
- Tell the manager to give him a hundred rupees.
- Thank you very much sir.

796
01:08:16,098 --> 01:08:19,620
The poor man has no money to eat.

797
01:08:20,102 --> 01:08:22,813
But borrow or celebrate.

798
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:26,039
I have a lot.

799
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:29,217
Despite having money, my son
does not even want to get married.

800
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,469
Why don't you go to
town and talk to him, sir?

801
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:40,550
I went a few times but
he would not listen to me.

802
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:44,255
Children make mistakes.

803
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,479
Adults, they need to be made aware.

804
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:50,985
That Mr. Kamal is stubborn...

805
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:58,342
-... we must not stop trying.
- Okay, I'll try again.

806
01:09:10,753 --> 01:09:14,080
- Do you study in college?
- No, I'm a teacher.

807
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,413
- Which school?
- I'm a tutor.

808
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:21,663
- What is this book?  Would you show me, please?
- The name of the book is "Words".

809
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:25,580
It's a beautiful book.
I have no free time...

810
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,788
... read books because of homework.

811
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:30,303
If you have children like this...

812
01:09:30,538 --> 01:09:32,413
... who likes to read books?

813
01:10:06,646 --> 01:10:07,683
the ticket.

814
01:10:09,225 --> 01:10:10,280
Mr.

815
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:18,280
Do you sell tickets?
Give me one ticket to hell.

816
01:10:18,742 --> 01:10:21,614
- I'll give you anything you need.
- Like you're drinking too much?

817
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:24,905
I'm a train ticket checker.

818
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:28,780
- Show me your ticket.
- Train tickets...

819
01:10:32,617 --> 01:10:33,800
Here.

820
01:10:35,054 --> 01:10:37,030
You have a first class ticket.

821
01:10:37,264 --> 01:10:40,739
Why travel in third
class, are you crazy?

822
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:45,322
I was not crazy.  Made me crazy.

823
01:10:46,898 --> 01:10:51,780
She took a third-class
ticket and boarded first-class.

824
01:10:52,836 --> 01:10:56,614
By that mistake, she went to see me.

825
01:10:57,122 --> 01:11:01,140
Does God know where she is?
Now I bought a first class ticket...

826
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,989
... traveling in third
class to find her.

827
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:09,322
Everyone calls me crazy.

828
01:11:12,872 --> 01:11:17,739
Look, this is the memory of our first meeting.

829
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:22,322
You're crazy and drunk.

830
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,673
Don't you know it's wrong
for Beela to travel here?

831
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,072
The next station is nearby.

832
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:28,322
Please go down.

833
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:34,947
Get down, Mister.

834
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:50,586
Where am I, where am I going?

835
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:53,947
I can not think of it.

836
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:56,572
I can not think of it.

837
01:11:59,617 --> 01:12:02,072
Sister, did you forget your book?

838
01:12:09,352 --> 01:12:11,286
Good thing you reminded me.

839
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:27,695
- Give it up.  Get out of here.
- Mother!

840
01:16:28,868 --> 01:16:33,528
Bola, what happened?  Get up.

841
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:37,153
I told you, I'm
going to bathe you.

842
01:16:37,236 --> 01:16:39,111
Why did you come alone?

843
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:42,815
Shyam, you have a lot of other
work to do around the orphanage.

844
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:47,320
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm glad to help you.

845
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,698
You and I are orphans.

846
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:53,314
One orphan needs
to help another.

847
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:55,903
Come on.  Sit down.

848
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:09,736
Hello Sita-Ram.  Hello Krishna.

849
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,361
Hello Sita-Ram.  Hello Krishna.

850
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:17,028
Hello Sita-Ram.  Hello Krishna.

851
01:17:17,111 --> 01:17:20,697
Hello Sita-Ram.  Hello Krishna.

852
01:17:24,777 --> 01:17:27,190
Not all glitter is gold.

853
01:17:27,617 --> 01:17:32,482
Shiny silk dresses do not
make a person beautiful.

854
01:17:32,943 --> 01:17:35,940
True beauty lies in
the purity of the soul.

855
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:38,357
Good with good thoughts...

856
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:40,815
... Those with a character are immortal.

857
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,232
Like Sita, Savithri, Damayanthi.

858
01:17:44,464 --> 01:17:47,065
Teacher, how do we
test someone's character?

859
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:50,039
Why are you misleading this kid?

860
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:53,065
Teach her a little English.
Tell her useful things.

861
01:17:53,365 --> 01:17:56,469
Things that are appropriate to
navigate in society when she grows up.

862
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:59,341
She does not want to learn about
the character and starve to death.

863
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:11,348
- My friend, sit down.
- Who?

864
01:18:12,594 --> 01:18:16,133
- Where did you bring me with this?
- My friend at this place...

865
01:18:16,344 --> 01:18:18,424
... will heal the
restlessness in your heart.

866
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:21,091
Menaka Nona about this friend...

867
01:18:21,174 --> 01:18:25,383
-... I told you.
- Yes sir.  What do you like?

868
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:28,133
Tea, coffee, cocoa
or an oval drink?

869
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,278
What are these things
you are talking about?

870
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:32,779
Tea and coffee have
ruined his health.

871
01:18:33,428 --> 01:18:35,428
I came here because I
was afraid of the world.

872
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,424
Let him swim in your eyes and let
him swim in the lake of your sweet voice.

873
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:45,015
- Mr. Kamal, you stay.  I will come.
- You...

874
01:20:36,822 --> 01:20:39,446
What is this big night music for?
Is there a party?

875
01:20:39,526 --> 01:20:41,489
One party every morning.

876
01:20:41,572 --> 01:20:43,072
In the evening it becomes Deepavali.

877
01:22:28,864 --> 01:22:31,989
Did your anxiety subside?

878
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,947
- Grapes...?
- Yes, they are sour.

879
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:47,572
A touch that lightens my heart.

880
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,489
Only Gayathri's pet.

881
01:22:53,197 --> 01:22:56,405
So why did you come here?
You had to go to Haridwar.

882
01:22:56,822 --> 01:22:58,447
I came here not
of my own free will.

883
01:22:58,946 --> 01:23:03,155
I was brought here.  My
drink brought me to this hell.

884
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:06,197
Looks like this is your
first time.  Come with me.

885
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,822
Go!  I say get away from me.

886
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:31,947
Gayathri...?  My Gayathri...?

887
01:23:48,168 --> 01:23:50,239
Gayathri you.

888
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:55,822
Are you in a place like this?

889
01:23:56,117 --> 01:24:00,155
No... no.  I work here.

890
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,322
In this hell?

891
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:12,905
Gayathri, is what the villagers say true?

892
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:16,655
Is that true?

893
01:24:17,518 --> 01:24:18,697
Why don't you say anything?

894
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:22,947
Not really illegal ..

895
01:24:24,117 --> 01:24:26,655
If you are pure, speak the truth.

896
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,423
Tell me why do people
talk bad about you?

897
01:24:28,447 --> 01:24:31,072
What happened after I left?
Tell me the truth.

898
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:40,075
Gayathri, if you talk I
can regain my happiness.

899
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:41,256
My life is worse than death.

900
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,530
Worth living again.

901
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:45,569
Why are you silent?

902
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:47,246
Why do not you say
that all this is not true?

903
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:50,104
No, I can not say that.
I can not say that.

904
01:24:50,936 --> 01:24:53,812
If God is blind I
can say nothing.

905
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,395
If a convict
cannot plead guilty.

906
01:24:58,437 --> 01:25:00,062
He then seeks refuge
in the name of God.

907
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:02,895
Are you in this house now...?

908
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:07,356
Now I do not want to know
anything else.  Seems true.

909
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:09,623
It's right in front of my eyes.

910
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,899
Never believe the
truth with your eyes.

911
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:13,496
Try to forget what the truth is.

912
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,163
Go home and obey your father's will.

913
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:18,812
Get back on track with life.

914
01:25:18,895 --> 01:25:23,145
Drinking will ruin your life.

915
01:25:23,562 --> 01:25:25,645
Life is about pleasing others.

916
01:25:26,854 --> 01:25:28,645
You teach me the lesson of life.

917
01:25:29,437 --> 01:25:30,705
Get yourself off the track...

918
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:34,520
... teach me a lesson?
You are the cause of my destruction.

919
01:25:34,982 --> 01:25:37,142
If I had not met you on the
train, I would never have met you.

920
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:39,520
You fell into the trap of your dishonest love.

921
01:25:42,645 --> 01:25:46,145
For years I have regarded
you as an image of holiness.

922
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:48,395
Your memory is close to my heart.

923
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:51,769
The world tried to
make me understand...

924
01:25:52,395 --> 01:25:54,562
... that you are a despicable sinner.

925
01:25:55,895 --> 01:25:57,895
But I did not trust anyone.

926
01:25:59,604 --> 01:26:02,729
Today I realized the world...

927
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:05,229
... OK I was wrong.

928
01:26:12,562 --> 01:26:13,678
Gayathri.

929
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:20,812
- What's the matter, baby?
- Nothing, Dad.

930
01:26:22,145 --> 01:26:27,062
Dad, I do not want to be
here.  Let's go somewhere else.

931
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:32,812
If we have to leave, why
don't we go to Ramnagar?

932
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:36,937
I have heard that the
school needs a teacher there.

933
01:26:37,665 --> 01:26:40,187
If you work, your
mind will relax too.

934
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,979
Dad, let's go somewhere.
I need to get out of here.

935
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,604
OK baby.  Let's go.

936
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:53,987
Bola take this medicine.

937
01:26:54,653 --> 01:26:56,987
Shyam why are you so late?

938
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:59,862
The amount given was not enough...

939
01:26:59,945 --> 01:27:02,296
... for the doctor's fee.

940
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,671
I touched his feet and
begged him to understand.

941
01:27:03,695 --> 01:27:05,103
Then I was given medicine.

942
01:27:05,528 --> 01:27:09,445
Shyam, you help me a lot.

943
01:27:09,903 --> 01:27:12,208
Why should I not?
You are my friend.

944
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:15,570
Bola, give me a smile.
I'm going to school now.

945
01:27:16,933 --> 01:27:20,752
Otherwise I would not
be able to focus on school.

946
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,070
Okay, Bola.

947
01:27:38,528 --> 01:27:41,650
Dad, I got the job.

948
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:43,737
I teach second grade.

949
01:27:44,612 --> 01:27:47,612
I'm going inside.  Now you go home.

950
01:27:51,612 --> 01:27:54,928
My dear Shyam.

951
01:27:55,008 --> 01:27:57,467
You're the uncle who gave me the toffee.

952
01:27:57,612 --> 01:28:01,108
- You recognized me.
- Who can forget Uncle Toffee?

953
01:28:01,278 --> 01:28:04,028
Did you come to school too?

954
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:07,157
Child, what can an older
person like me learn?

955
01:28:07,237 --> 01:28:10,362
Why hasn't it been so long?

956
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:12,987
I could not come because it was busy.

957
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:14,950
But from now on I
come every day, right?

958
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:19,153
You are very good.  The bell rang.

959
01:28:19,237 --> 01:28:21,570
If I do not want
to go I will be late.

960
01:28:22,403 --> 01:28:25,195
Son Shyam, tell me,
what class are you in?

961
01:28:25,403 --> 01:28:28,570
- 2nd class.
- 2nd class...?

962
01:28:28,653 --> 01:28:31,945
From today you will get a new
teacher.  She is so beautiful.

963
01:28:32,028 --> 01:28:35,581
- She will love you like a mother.
- Is she that good?

964
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:38,678
- Okay, I'll go and see him.  Welcome.
- Welcome.

965
01:28:39,737 --> 01:28:43,612
Dear children, the greatest
thing in the world is cleanliness.

966
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,695
We should always wear
clean clothes to school.

967
01:28:47,528 --> 01:28:49,612
I do not like...

968
01:28:50,028 --> 01:28:52,791
... for those who are not paying
attention in class and are late for school.

969
01:28:52,871 --> 01:28:53,945
Teacher!

970
01:29:00,862 --> 01:29:04,737
- Who are you?
- Teacher, I'm Shyam.  I am studying in this class.

971
01:29:04,987 --> 01:29:08,612
You are my teacher, aren't you?  I
have heard that you are very beautiful.

972
01:29:12,237 --> 01:29:13,352
Wait.

973
01:29:15,987 --> 01:29:17,820
Why are you entering
without my permission?

974
01:29:18,112 --> 01:29:20,438
May I not come in, teacher?

975
01:29:20,737 --> 01:29:21,963
Why not comb your hair?

976
01:29:21,987 --> 01:29:24,945
- Is there no oil in the house?
- No, teacher.

977
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:26,879
Go to your bench
and stand on it.

978
01:30:01,726 --> 01:30:06,101
The world is divided into
water and land in a 3: 1 ratio.

979
01:30:06,851 --> 01:30:09,559
People, there are different races.

980
01:30:09,642 --> 01:30:12,559
Of the land animals,
the big ones are.

981
01:30:12,642 --> 01:30:16,625
Elephants and lions.  Cows...

982
01:30:16,851 --> 01:30:20,014
Small animals are
rabbits, chickens and so on.

983
01:30:20,684 --> 01:30:23,059
There are many other animals besides this.

984
01:30:23,142 --> 01:30:26,309
Snakes crawl on the
ground like scorpions.

985
01:30:26,476 --> 01:30:30,892
Many insects, such as
ants and cockroaches.

986
01:30:31,101 --> 01:30:33,915
Cockroaches.  Cockroaches.

987
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:40,559
Shyam, what happened?  Come here.

988
01:30:46,418 --> 01:30:49,142
- Why did you scream?
- Teacher, Bahadur...

989
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:53,226
... put a cockroach on
my feet.  I was scared.

990
01:30:53,559 --> 01:30:57,809
- Sir, he's lying.
- Sir, check his pocket.

991
01:30:57,892 --> 01:30:59,464
There is a cockroach in it.

992
01:31:00,434 --> 01:31:02,476
Bahadur, show me your pocket.

993
01:31:02,934 --> 01:31:05,351
Sir, I have no cockroaches.

994
01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:08,351
Shyam, show me your pocket now.

995
01:31:13,417 --> 01:31:15,684
You are lying.  Give me your hand.

996
01:31:18,309 --> 01:31:19,351
Mother!

997
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:36,537
- Are you not afraid of being attacked?
- No.

998
01:31:36,767 --> 01:31:40,514
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Why is that?

999
01:31:40,892 --> 01:31:43,892
I was born an orphan.
I live in an orphanage.

1000
01:31:44,226 --> 01:31:46,142
If I start to get
scared of these things.

1001
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:48,017
Who is there to protect me?

1002
01:31:48,434 --> 01:31:53,434
I did not know you
were an orphan.

1003
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:03,305
- Sir.
- Yes, Madhav.

1004
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,080
Your face is shining today.

1005
01:32:05,105 --> 01:32:08,980
But that day when I came to
town to pick you up with your dad.

1006
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,830
I was shocked to see the situation you were in.

1007
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:15,397
Madhav, you brought my body back.
But my heart is elsewhere.

1008
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:17,522
Sir this heart
really hurts a lot.

1009
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:20,561
There is only one cure for it.

1010
01:32:20,641 --> 01:32:22,313
That is, the loss of a heart.

1011
01:32:22,605 --> 01:32:24,980
Now I have learned
to say such things.

1012
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:59,486
"You are our mother, you are our father"

1013
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:06,486
"You are our brother
and you are our friend"

1014
01:33:09,281 --> 01:33:12,902
- Shyam, what are you looking at?
- Photo of my mom and dad.

1015
01:33:16,148 --> 01:33:20,867
That is Lord Krishna.
You are very lucky.

1016
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:23,013
To have such parents.

1017
01:33:23,778 --> 01:33:26,194
- Did you have your lunch?
- No, teacher.

1018
01:33:26,274 --> 01:33:29,113
Here we get food only twice.

1019
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:31,944
Morning and evening.

1020
01:33:32,256 --> 01:33:34,152
Feeling hungry during the day?

1021
01:33:34,396 --> 01:33:38,152
If I feel hungry I drink
water and I lose my hunger.

1022
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:43,027
- There's some food.  Do you like to eat?
- No, teacher.

1023
01:33:43,795 --> 01:33:45,736
- Get some.
- do not.

1024
01:33:51,652 --> 01:33:55,736
No matter what happens, a good
person always does the right thing.

1025
01:33:55,885 --> 01:33:58,777
A lion is hungry but
does not eat grass.

1026
01:33:59,004 --> 01:34:00,902
Even if a sandalwood tree burns...

1027
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,569
... gives off a sweet smell.

1028
01:34:31,531 --> 01:34:36,194
Shyam you are hungry
aren't you?  Come with me.

1029
01:34:36,911 --> 01:34:40,652
- Why is that?
- Teacher, you can feed me today.

1030
01:34:40,732 --> 01:34:42,152
Who is there to feed me tomorrow?

1031
01:34:42,733 --> 01:34:46,152
- You can eat with me every day.
- Really?  - Yes.

1032
01:34:52,694 --> 01:34:53,792
Sit down.

1033
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:00,990
I will eat with you
on one condition.

1034
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,736
When I grow up and start working
I think I will compensate you.

1035
01:35:04,835 --> 01:35:07,694
That's a good deal.
Then I'm getting old.

1036
01:35:07,777 --> 01:35:09,428
I will lose my arms and legs.

1037
01:35:09,508 --> 01:35:11,069
That would be a good help to me.

1038
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,320
Shyam, would you like
to stay in an orphanage?

1039
01:35:16,468 --> 01:35:20,152
Teacher, I do not like it.
But I have no choice.

1040
01:35:20,361 --> 01:35:22,736
I heard as a child my...

1041
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:25,319
... Mom left me there.

1042
01:35:26,192 --> 01:35:28,777
Shyam, are you at
my house with me?

1043
01:35:28,976 --> 01:35:30,152
I'm not hitting you.

1044
01:35:30,232 --> 01:35:35,027
I'm not afraid to fight but I
can not stay at your house.

1045
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:39,694
- Why is that?
- I have a lame friend at the orphanage...

1046
01:35:39,846 --> 01:35:43,163
... called Bola.  If I
come to live with you...

1047
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:45,085
... will there be a friend to help him?

1048
01:35:45,165 --> 01:35:47,444
He can't even bathe alone.

1049
01:35:47,907 --> 01:35:52,027
What a wonderful child you are.
Actually your mom's...

1050
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:56,236
... heartless, enough to leave a
child of God like you in an orphanage.

1051
01:35:56,527 --> 01:35:59,444
Teacher, do not tell my mother anything.

1052
01:35:59,524 --> 01:36:04,194
- I'm angry.
- All right.  Eat something now.

1053
01:36:07,014 --> 01:36:08,069
Take.

1054
01:36:08,906 --> 01:36:12,402
- Teacher, eat yourself.
- Yes.

1055
01:36:13,787 --> 01:36:17,611
Teacher, wait.  When I
count 1, 2, 3, you eat fast.

1056
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:19,512
Your food.

1057
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:25,569
1,2,3 ready.

1058
01:36:28,236 --> 01:36:32,319
- Teacher, eat your food.
- Yes baby, I will eat.

1059
01:36:32,694 --> 01:36:33,986
You eat first.

1060
01:36:36,694 --> 01:36:40,444
Kamal, life is not
just about living for us.

1061
01:36:41,461 --> 01:36:43,152
We too must live for others.

1062
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:45,777
Until you get it...

1063
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,361
... there will be no peace
in my life or in yours.

1064
01:36:50,444 --> 01:36:52,527
May Nirvana heal the
soul of the departed mother.

1065
01:36:53,406 --> 01:36:58,152
Dad, I tried to live my
life the way I wanted to.

1066
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,518
But there was no consolation.

1067
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:03,361
Now I will do what you like.

1068
01:37:03,945 --> 01:37:06,902
Kamal, I'm happy.  I'm so happy.

1069
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:11,194
- But Dad, don't force me to get married soon.
- all right.

1070
01:37:11,274 --> 01:37:12,902
I will arrange your
marriage when you wish.

1071
01:37:12,982 --> 01:37:17,527
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sit down.

1072
01:37:17,769 --> 01:37:18,976
Thank you.

1073
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,922
Son, how do you feel now?

1074
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:25,978
- I feel better than before.
- That's good news.

1075
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,902
- My work will be done.
- work?  - Yes.

1076
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:31,694
The school in Ramnagar is
scheduled to hold their annual function.

1077
01:37:31,827 --> 01:37:36,944
- I wanted to make Mr. Kamal the chief guest at the event.
- All right.

1078
01:37:37,354 --> 01:37:38,794
But this is something that belongs to adults.

1079
01:37:39,763 --> 01:37:42,986
- You invite Dad.
- It was your dad's turn last year.

1080
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,736
This year it is your turn.

1081
01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:48,402
You maintain your
accounts very well.

1082
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,294
Kamal, you have to agree to this.

1083
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,789
Changing your routine
will be good for your health.

1084
01:37:53,912 --> 01:37:57,486
- Your father is right.
- Shall I agree for you?

1085
01:37:58,268 --> 01:38:00,152
- Your choice, Dad.
- All right then.

1086
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:03,611
I'm sure I left home
today in a happy moment.

1087
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:06,819
- Mr. Kamal, hello.
- Please come.

1088
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,800
- Bola.
- Yes.

1089
01:38:15,577 --> 01:38:17,546
You have a fever.

1090
01:38:17,626 --> 01:38:20,194
How do you get to school to see a play?

1091
01:38:20,647 --> 01:38:23,444
Shyam, then I will be fine.

1092
01:38:23,836 --> 01:38:25,593
What is your role in the play?

1093
01:38:25,673 --> 01:38:28,017
I'm going to be an
orphan rabbit in the play.

1094
01:38:28,097 --> 01:38:30,901
Are you an orphan in the play?

1095
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:33,479
Yes, Bola.  That lion is the mother
of the rabbit, because it kills and eats.

1096
01:38:34,059 --> 01:38:36,736
What happens next?

1097
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:39,652
Rabbit, revenge...

1098
01:38:39,732 --> 01:38:42,122
-... against the lion.  It is me.
- How is that?

1099
01:38:46,936 --> 01:38:50,336
Shyam Do not be afraid.  Do well.

1100
01:38:50,613 --> 01:38:54,319
Do not worry, teacher.
The landlord's son will be happy.

1101
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:57,193
He will give you a good position.

1102
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:01,297
Shyam, do well.
I know about you.

1103
01:39:01,526 --> 01:39:03,190
Grandpa, don't worry about me.

1104
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,456
- Drag the screen exactly.
- All right.  - Come on, put this on.

1105
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:25,204
"My boyfriend is not
here, what can I do?"

1106
01:39:25,288 --> 01:39:27,829
"My sweetheart has not come"

1107
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:40,520
"If anyone calls me crazy"

1108
01:39:41,207 --> 01:39:43,909
"Let him say whatever he wants."

1109
01:39:44,374 --> 01:39:50,121
"I'm starving to
death, what can I do?"

1110
01:39:50,413 --> 01:39:53,163
"If anyone calls me crazy"

1111
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:20,073
"My dear mother. I played
with your hand when I was little."

1112
01:40:22,844 --> 01:40:27,371
"Mom, my dear mom"

1113
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:39,672
"Don't worry so much,
you're a poor kid"

1114
01:40:40,301 --> 01:40:43,992
"Think wisely and take
revenge on the lion"

1115
01:40:44,072 --> 01:40:48,413
"May such an injustice
never happen again."

1116
01:40:57,782 --> 01:41:03,639
"I want to say thank
you to all of you."

1117
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:09,246
"Something for you all"

1118
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:17,371
"I hate the lion, I do not want
to endure his torture anymore."

1119
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:25,659
"I'm grateful to you all."

1120
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:30,788
- You should not say such things.
- Why is that?

1121
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:36,871
"The king of that
forest can devour you"

1122
01:41:45,404 --> 01:41:50,579
- Now I have to go alone.
- Why is that?

1123
01:41:50,881 --> 01:41:56,329
"Because of a coward who endures that injustice."

1124
01:41:59,454 --> 01:42:02,121
"Little boy, listen to us"

1125
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:05,204
"Little boy, listen to us"

1126
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:08,913
If your life is worth living,
stop being stubborn.

1127
01:42:09,069 --> 01:42:11,746
"Little boy, listen to us"

1128
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:23,246
"You have a mustache
and are very strong"

1129
01:42:23,912 --> 01:42:30,288
"You're one in a million"

1130
01:42:30,579 --> 01:42:36,127
"You have a mustache
and are very strong"

1131
01:42:36,207 --> 01:42:38,121
"Very good"

1132
01:42:38,855 --> 01:42:44,670
"But there are two
lions living here."

1133
01:42:44,819 --> 01:42:49,206
"One in the jungle, the other in the water."

1134
01:42:49,286 --> 01:42:54,021
"Two lions live here."

1135
01:42:56,055 --> 01:43:04,055
"Come, Mr. Lion,
see who is here."

1136
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:12,360
"Come, Mr. Lion,
see who is here."

1137
01:43:15,597 --> 01:43:23,597
"Come face to face, traitor.
Why are you hiding?"

1138
01:43:24,905 --> 01:43:29,055
"Fight with me if you are brave"

1139
01:43:29,389 --> 01:43:33,680
"I have control over this forest"

1140
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:49,015
"Look, this little guy's
adventure, he did a real trick."

1141
01:43:49,095 --> 01:43:53,097
"No one has ever seen
such a beautiful magician."

1142
01:43:53,222 --> 01:43:57,472
"Look, this little guy's
adventure, he did a real trick."

1143
01:43:57,555 --> 01:44:01,472
"No one has ever seen
such a beautiful magician."

1144
01:44:01,555 --> 01:44:05,787
"Look, this little guy's
adventure, he did a real trick."

1145
01:44:05,892 --> 01:44:10,930
"No one has ever seen
such a beautiful magician."

1146
01:44:38,681 --> 01:44:41,735
You played very well.

1147
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:45,305
- Baby, what's your name?
- Sir, my name is Shyam.

1148
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:49,639
- I'm in the orphanage.
- is it?  I did not know.

1149
01:44:49,818 --> 01:44:52,055
That a child as talented as
you is staying in an orphanage.

1150
01:44:52,295 --> 01:44:54,587
Please come.  We would
love to show you our school.

1151
01:44:59,283 --> 01:45:03,129
Mr. Kamal, this is our
new teacher Mrs. Gayathri.

1152
01:45:03,209 --> 01:45:06,254
She was the one who coached this show.

1153
01:45:11,504 --> 01:45:13,670
Do you employ such
women as teachers here?

1154
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,521
Principal, why are you...

1155
01:45:16,545 --> 01:45:19,545
... such a person is responsible
for the future of the children.

1156
01:45:19,629 --> 01:45:22,139
For someone who does not have this good character.

1157
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:24,476
If I had known about this before...

1158
01:45:24,966 --> 01:45:26,246
... I'm not coming here.

1159
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,215
Ma'am, get her out
of this job right away.

1160
01:45:29,295 --> 01:45:31,462
Mrs. Gayathri, you were dismissed.

1161
01:45:32,462 --> 01:45:33,879
Gayathri.

1162
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:40,476
Dad, what happened?

1163
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:43,252
Someone help me.

1164
01:45:45,932 --> 01:45:47,094
Nothing to worry about.

1165
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:48,795
His head is injured.

1166
01:45:49,314 --> 01:45:50,954
His age causes him to
have high blood pressure.

1167
01:45:51,422 --> 01:45:52,682
He will soon regain consciousness.

1168
01:45:52,706 --> 01:45:54,089
He needs a complete rest.

1169
01:45:55,589 --> 01:45:57,922
- Yes.
- Take care of him.

1170
01:45:58,266 --> 01:46:00,346
- I'm going to the contractor's bungalow.
- All right, sir.

1171
01:46:06,353 --> 01:46:10,520
The fever has increased.
Bola, open your eyes.

1172
01:46:11,197 --> 01:46:13,436
What do I do now?

1173
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:19,270
Sir, Bola has a high fever.

1174
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:22,811
- Talk to a doctor.
- forget it.  Let that cripple die.

1175
01:46:22,891 --> 01:46:25,895
If the doctor does not come, he will die.

1176
01:46:25,975 --> 01:46:29,853
He will die.  But why
would you die for him?

1177
01:46:29,991 --> 01:46:33,270
- go to sleep.
- No.  I'll go and talk to the doctor.

1178
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:37,712
- Stop!  I'll teach you a lesson.
- Leave me alone.

1179
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:42,645
- You're going to the doctor, aren't you?
- Leave me alone.

1180
01:46:46,478 --> 01:46:53,110
Sir, open the door, open the door.

1181
01:46:57,353 --> 01:46:58,436
Mother!

1182
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:49,186
Are you trying to escape?

1183
01:47:49,954 --> 01:47:53,628
You are already used to
breaking down doors at this age.

1184
01:47:54,003 --> 01:47:57,557
Never come to the
orphanage again.

1185
01:47:57,688 --> 01:47:58,936
Get out of here.

1186
01:48:01,904 --> 01:48:04,645
- Doctor!
- why?

1187
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,853
I came from an orphanage.

1188
01:48:06,933 --> 01:48:11,228
My friend, Bola is very sick.
He needs treatment from a doctor.

1189
01:48:11,388 --> 01:48:12,898
But the doctor is not here.

1190
01:48:13,202 --> 01:48:14,738
He went to the contractor's bungalow.

1191
01:48:14,762 --> 01:48:16,061
You can go there if you want.

1192
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,270
- To the contractor's bungalow?
- Yes.

1193
01:48:20,297 --> 01:48:25,436
Daughter, I did you an injustice.

1194
01:48:26,478 --> 01:48:31,436
- I hid something from you.
- What is it?

1195
01:48:32,651 --> 01:48:36,328
Please forgive me.

1196
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:39,353
Dad, tell me, what is it?

1197
01:48:40,228 --> 01:48:43,686
- Your child.
- My child...?

1198
01:48:44,811 --> 01:48:47,518
- He was not dead.
- Aren't you dead?

1199
01:48:47,729 --> 01:48:49,645
- Is he or she alive?
- Yes.

1200
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,270
Dad, are you telling the truth?

1201
01:48:51,526 --> 01:48:54,228
Yes, I lied to you.

1202
01:48:54,606 --> 01:48:58,770
- Where is my baby now?
- At the orphanage.

1203
01:48:59,147 --> 01:49:01,728
- Who is my child?
- Shyam.

1204
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:03,595
Is Shyam my child?

1205
01:49:03,678 --> 01:49:05,278
- Yes.
- Shyam.

1206
01:49:05,378 --> 01:49:07,978
Daughter, you go to the orphanage.

1207
01:49:08,351 --> 01:49:09,895
Get him quickly.

1208
01:49:15,731 --> 01:49:19,228
- Who, why is this?
- Please talk to Shyam.

1209
01:49:19,413 --> 01:49:22,403
- He's not here.
- Where did he go?

1210
01:49:22,483 --> 01:49:24,811
How do I know?
He escaped from here.

1211
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:30,270
He is not like that.

1212
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:32,499
I have not looked at his horoscope.

1213
01:49:32,512 --> 01:49:34,159
If you want to find him, do so.

1214
01:49:34,183 --> 01:49:35,645
He may be begging on the streets now.

1215
01:49:39,523 --> 01:49:42,103
Shyam... Shyam!

1216
01:49:42,273 --> 01:49:43,353
Please eat.

1217
01:49:46,626 --> 01:49:48,728
- Please.
- No.

1218
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,186
No, thank you.

1219
01:49:52,798 --> 01:49:55,103
Daughter Rajni, play the tambourine now.

1220
01:49:55,216 --> 01:49:58,003
Since my son-in-law came for the first
time we definitely listened to some music.

1221
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,061
Mr. Kamal, I'm
sorry to hear that.

1222
01:50:00,145 --> 01:50:03,021
- You son-in-law before marriage.
- It's okay.

1223
01:50:03,174 --> 01:50:05,561
But she does not want to be bothered.

1224
01:50:06,227 --> 01:50:08,204
- Dad is waiting for me.
- There is nothing wrong with that.

1225
01:50:08,228 --> 01:50:10,145
just a moment.
Daughter, you start.

1226
01:50:11,729 --> 01:50:15,641
- Doctor... Doctor!
- why?

1227
01:50:15,831 --> 01:50:18,936
My friend, Bola, is very
sick at the orphanage.

1228
01:50:19,141 --> 01:50:20,436
Please come with me.

1229
01:50:20,585 --> 01:50:23,020
- Or he will die.
- Who is this?

1230
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:25,311
News of death at
such a good time?

1231
01:50:26,023 --> 01:50:28,103
Son you go.  I can
not come with you now.

1232
01:50:30,989 --> 01:50:35,895
Landlord, please tell the
doctor to come with me.

1233
01:50:36,168 --> 01:50:39,936
- Ask him to save my friend.
- Who took him in?

1234
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:43,811
Mr. Landlord, you are like a father to us.

1235
01:50:44,145 --> 01:50:46,660
Please fulfill the child's wishes.

1236
01:50:46,768 --> 01:50:49,570
Shyam, don't worry.  Doc
will definitely come with you.

1237
01:50:49,606 --> 01:50:51,366
Doctor, let's go.  I
will come with you.

1238
01:50:51,481 --> 01:50:53,145
Come on, Shyam, let's go.

1239
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:00,228
Dad, he doesn't care about us.

1240
01:51:00,446 --> 01:51:03,161
But he cares about this boy.

1241
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:07,867
Don't worry daughter.
Let me show you who I am.

1242
01:51:09,244 --> 01:51:10,270
father!

1243
01:51:12,881 --> 01:51:15,561
Where is Shyam and why
did you not come with him?

1244
01:51:16,311 --> 01:51:18,103
He escaped from the orphanage.

1245
01:51:18,395 --> 01:51:20,853
- I wonder.  Where did he go?
- Escaped...?

1246
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:27,561
God punishes me
for my bad deeds.

1247
01:51:28,134 --> 01:51:30,973
I had separated him from his mother.

1248
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,830
Dad, I'll never find my Shyam.

1249
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:41,910
Baby, don't cry.  God will
not be so harsh with us.

1250
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:49,520
- Doctor, how is the baby?
- I can't say anything right now.

1251
01:51:51,148 --> 01:51:52,908
Is this how orphans are cared for?

1252
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:54,661
Who is responsible if something happens?

1253
01:51:54,685 --> 01:51:56,978
- Sir, I do.
- Shut up.

1254
01:51:57,731 --> 01:52:00,942
Doctor, you must have
given Bola a good cure.

1255
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:04,641
But please do not
leave until he is well.

1256
01:52:04,806 --> 01:52:07,311
No, I'm not going anywhere.

1257
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:18,561
Bola, the landlord himself
gave you the doctor.

1258
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,645
Shyam Why did you bother him?

1259
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:25,520
Again I will not bother anyone.

1260
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:29,906
I am going to God.

1261
01:52:30,184 --> 01:52:37,353
I'll tell him to send
you mom and dad.

1262
01:52:37,523 --> 01:52:39,686
Why say such things?

1263
01:52:39,842 --> 01:52:43,186
I do not want a mom and dad.

1264
01:52:43,436 --> 01:52:45,311
I just want you.

1265
01:52:45,728 --> 01:52:49,561
No, God is talking to me.

1266
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,270
Shyam, you sing bhajans every day.

1267
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,995
- Please sing it for me today.
- Bola, how do I sing?

1268
01:52:58,061 --> 01:53:01,314
Can't you see there
are tears in my eyes?

1269
01:53:01,394 --> 01:53:05,186
Shyam, only once.
Are you my friend

1270
01:53:06,567 --> 01:53:09,145
Please sing for
me one last time.

1271
01:53:09,222 --> 01:53:11,770
- I'll never ask you to sing again.
- all right.

1272
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:22,770
You are our mother, you are our father.

1273
01:53:25,228 --> 01:53:31,895
You are our brother, you are our friend.

1274
01:53:32,228 --> 01:53:38,686
You are our mother, you are our father.

1275
01:53:39,106 --> 01:53:46,270
You are our brother, you are our friend.

1276
01:53:53,561 --> 01:54:00,228
Flowers we never bloom.

1277
01:54:00,385 --> 01:54:07,353
We are the dust at your feet.

1278
01:54:10,747 --> 01:54:17,603
Flowers we never bloom.

1279
01:54:17,853 --> 01:54:24,311
We are the dust at your feet.

1280
01:54:24,856 --> 01:54:31,478
Always keep your
loving eyes on us.

1281
01:54:31,815 --> 01:54:38,270
You are our brother, you are our friend.

1282
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:45,478
You are our mother, you are our father.

1283
01:54:45,839 --> 01:54:52,436
You are our brother, you are our friend.

1284
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:59,353
- Bola.
- Shyam, your balls are gone now.

1285
01:54:59,895 --> 01:55:02,353
Bola, wait.

1286
01:55:02,728 --> 01:55:04,561
Where are you going alone?

1287
01:55:04,895 --> 01:55:06,853
Take me with you.

1288
01:55:08,853 --> 01:55:10,353
You ended our friendship.

1289
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:15,145
You said you would
never be angry with me.

1290
01:55:15,398 --> 01:55:17,270
Talk, Bola, talk.

1291
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:23,395
Shyam, do not cry.

1292
01:55:23,728 --> 01:55:28,936
I have no mother or father.

1293
01:55:29,397 --> 01:55:33,145
I only had the ball.
Now he has left me alone.

1294
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:37,353
Where do I go now?

1295
01:55:37,653 --> 01:55:41,103
Shyam, I am with you.
You are not an orphan.

1296
01:55:41,432 --> 01:55:42,686
You are not an orphan.

1297
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,228
I thought there was only
selfishness in the world.

1298
01:55:46,311 --> 01:55:49,228
That there is no love in this world.

1299
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:53,936
But seeing your love
in this orphanage...

1300
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:58,811
..I learned that life is
only giving, not taking.

1301
01:56:00,895 --> 01:56:02,603
I'm a runaway.

1302
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:07,186
But Shyam you have given
me a new reason to live.

1303
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:12,645
I will always keep you with me.
I will never leave you.

1304
01:56:12,981 --> 01:56:16,811
- Please do not worry.
- Shyam.

1305
01:56:39,915 --> 01:56:43,160
Big bungalow!
How many are here?

1306
01:56:43,451 --> 01:56:48,701
- My father and I.
- Really?

1307
01:56:48,785 --> 01:56:50,910
Sister, brother or
grandfather, aren't they?

1308
01:56:51,746 --> 01:56:54,993
- No, no one.
- That means you're an orphan like me.

1309
01:56:55,326 --> 01:56:58,118
Then what is the need
for such a big house?

1310
01:56:58,413 --> 01:57:04,785
The one who eats less
and saves more is a thief.

1311
01:57:04,955 --> 01:57:08,868
- Did you know that?
- Is that so?  Have you read this in any book?

1312
01:57:09,138 --> 01:57:14,368
- No, my heart tells me so.  Let's do something.
- what?

1313
01:57:14,742 --> 01:57:19,660
You say 1, 2,
3, then I tell you.

1314
01:57:22,975 --> 01:57:27,451
Why are you looking
like an idiot?  Say 1, 2, 3.

1315
01:57:28,878 --> 01:57:33,951
1,2,3 OK!

1316
01:57:34,266 --> 01:57:38,618
Now I will tell you.
The orphanage is very small.

1317
01:57:38,698 --> 01:57:40,368
There are a lot of people out there.

1318
01:57:40,448 --> 01:57:43,454
Why, not all of
those kids get here.

1319
01:57:43,534 --> 01:57:46,410
You and your father can
stay in the orphanage.

1320
01:57:46,490 --> 01:57:50,710
Amazing!  Sir, he
is totally like you.

1321
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:53,160
Long live you!  I'll get you
some sweets soon, son.

1322
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,910
Madhava.  Keep quiet.

1323
01:57:56,568 --> 01:57:59,826
- Kamal, who is this kid?
- Dad, this is Shyam.

1324
01:58:00,006 --> 01:58:02,226
He is an orphan.  Shyam, this is my father.

1325
01:58:02,691 --> 01:58:04,326
- Grandpa, hello.
- Grandpa?

1326
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:08,049
- Sir, the wish for your grandson has come true.
- Madhav.

1327
01:58:08,526 --> 01:58:10,360
Kamal, where did you come with him?

1328
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:14,061
- He calls me Grandpa.
- Sir, Grandma can't tell.

1329
01:58:14,085 --> 01:58:15,365
be quiet.

1330
01:58:15,486 --> 01:58:18,643
Kamal, go and leave
this garbage dump.

1331
01:58:18,735 --> 01:58:21,427
Dad, kids are not dirty.

1332
01:58:22,118 --> 01:58:24,244
They are flowers that bloom because of God.

1333
01:58:25,094 --> 01:58:28,341
Adults make mistakes.
The children have to pay for them.

1334
01:58:28,998 --> 01:58:31,731
The fault lies not with their parents.

1335
01:58:31,985 --> 01:58:34,776
Even if it's my
fault, send him here.

1336
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:37,610
No, Dad, he's not going anywhere.

1337
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:40,360
He, like my two eyes.
He should be here.

1338
01:58:40,693 --> 01:58:41,893
Kamal are you conscious?

1339
01:58:42,195 --> 01:58:44,595
Everything you need
is done to your liking.

1340
01:58:44,979 --> 01:58:47,419
If this orphan were here I
would not live in this house.

1341
01:58:47,443 --> 01:58:50,943
Grandpa, the house is yours.
Why should you go?

1342
01:58:51,193 --> 01:58:52,985
- I will go.
- No, Shyam.

1343
01:58:53,568 --> 01:58:55,419
If this child does not have space in this house...

1344
01:58:55,443 --> 01:58:57,443
... so I'm leaving here too.

1345
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:01,360
Sir, why are father
and son fighting for me?

1346
01:59:01,568 --> 01:59:03,193
I'm going back to my orphanage.

1347
01:59:03,276 --> 01:59:09,526
- Shyam, I will go with you.  Come on.
- Kamal... Kamal!

1348
01:59:09,985 --> 01:59:14,194
Sir, do you not obey
your father's command?

1349
01:59:14,409 --> 01:59:17,276
That is very wrong.
Humans at the behest of their parents...

1350
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:23,068
.... not only the
animals are obedient.

1351
01:59:23,151 --> 01:59:25,791
Amazing!  Such a little
boy and such great thoughts.

1352
01:59:25,871 --> 01:59:28,855
Even the wise will defeat you.

1353
01:59:28,935 --> 01:59:32,174
Sir, people keep
dogs and cats as pets.

1354
01:59:32,254 --> 01:59:34,401
They grow like beards.

1355
01:59:34,610 --> 01:59:37,276
Sir, can't you keep this baby here?

1356
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,610
- Someone like little Kamal.
- That's enough.

1357
01:59:41,526 --> 01:59:48,443
Kamal do as you wish.
But you don’t go anywhere.

1358
02:00:10,193 --> 02:00:15,151
Sir, what is this red
drink you drink?  Blood?

1359
02:00:18,985 --> 02:00:23,526
No, Shyam.  This is not blood.

1360
02:00:24,543 --> 02:00:27,276
It is poisonous.

1361
02:00:28,142 --> 02:00:30,943
Poison...?  We should not drink poison.

1362
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:33,276
People die from poisoning.

1363
02:00:34,774 --> 02:00:37,871
Shyam, bring back my glass.

1364
02:00:38,335 --> 02:00:40,943
If I am your friend,
you must listen to me.

1365
02:00:41,225 --> 02:00:43,174
- Give me back my glass.
- No, I will not give up.

1366
02:00:43,351 --> 02:00:47,068
- Will you give it or not?  - No.
- Shyam, do not be stubborn.

1367
02:00:47,348 --> 02:00:50,141
Give me my glass.
Why did you throw it away?

1368
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:52,600
- Not polite.
- Mother!

1369
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:55,294
- Not polite.
- Mother!

1370
02:00:55,318 --> 02:00:56,901
You and Mom have to go to hell.

1371
02:00:58,727 --> 02:01:00,651
He has come to
teach me a lesson.

1372
02:01:01,097 --> 02:01:04,526
I don't care about anyone.

1373
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:24,924
Shyam?

1374
02:01:45,162 --> 02:01:46,204
Shyam.

1375
02:01:48,116 --> 02:01:49,287
Madhav.

1376
02:01:51,207 --> 02:01:53,120
- Madhava.  - Yes sir.
- Where is Shyam?

1377
02:01:53,204 --> 02:01:55,662
- He's out now.
- Went out?  - Yes.

1378
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,120
Shyam.

1379
02:02:01,329 --> 02:02:08,162
- Shyam... Shyam!
- Let me go, sir.

1380
02:02:08,245 --> 02:02:11,704
- I'm going to the orphanage.
- Shyam, I will not leave you.

1381
02:02:11,912 --> 02:02:14,912
Please leave me.
Why bother a poor boy?

1382
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:18,204
- Are you so angry with me?
- I'm just an orphan.

1383
02:02:18,418 --> 02:02:21,620
I'm angry but it doesn't
make any difference to you.

1384
02:02:22,204 --> 02:02:27,370
Please forgive me.  It
was my fault last night.

1385
02:02:27,829 --> 02:02:30,204
You did not hit me.

1386
02:02:30,374 --> 02:02:32,370
- So who did?
- Am I telling the truth?

1387
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:36,704
- You didn't hit me.
- So?

1388
02:02:36,995 --> 02:02:43,745
- That red water you drank, told me to hit.
- Shyam.

1389
02:02:44,495 --> 02:02:45,495
Shyam.

1390
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:50,910
You are small but you
have a good understanding.

1391
02:02:53,162 --> 02:02:54,679
For me, I'm ashamed of myself.

1392
02:02:56,343 --> 02:03:00,162
If I had a son of my own he
would not love me that much either.

1393
02:03:02,329 --> 02:03:03,745
Although you value me more than a son...

1394
02:03:03,825 --> 02:03:08,245
-... I'm just an orphan.
- No Shyam, you...

1395
02:03:08,677 --> 02:03:11,245
... not an orphan.
You cannot be an orphan.

1396
02:03:11,787 --> 02:03:16,120
Shyam, you are my son.  You are my son.

1397
02:03:18,409 --> 02:03:22,704
Shyam, are you my son?

1398
02:03:22,954 --> 02:03:25,912
- Will you really be my dad?
- Yes, of course...

1399
02:03:26,995 --> 02:03:30,204
-... will be your father.
- This is very good news.

1400
02:03:30,495 --> 02:03:34,162
Bola has fulfilled his promise.
He called Lord Krishna.

1401
02:03:34,242 --> 02:03:36,823
Ask me to send a father.

1402
02:03:37,185 --> 02:03:38,791
I'm not just my son...

1403
02:03:38,871 --> 02:03:42,568
... when you grow up I will
make you the owner of all my land.

1404
02:03:42,829 --> 02:03:47,162
Landlord, from today
you will have to fulfill...

1405
02:03:47,242 --> 02:03:50,500
... Landlord, Shyam Kumarage, Will.

1406
02:03:50,664 --> 02:03:52,537
If you touch that red water again.

1407
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,660
Will never be friends again.

1408
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:57,120
Then you are not my father either.
I am not your son either.

1409
02:03:57,412 --> 02:04:01,412
No.  I will never
touch them again.

1410
02:04:02,314 --> 02:04:04,162
Those who can be happy with their son's love...

1411
02:04:04,376 --> 02:04:07,329
... Why use such things?
Come on, let's go inside.

1412
02:04:11,749 --> 02:04:13,745
Why do you always pick him up?

1413
02:04:13,912 --> 02:04:17,052
Grandpa, who do you think I am?

1414
02:04:17,186 --> 02:04:20,886
I am the son of Mr. Ratan
Kumara, the owner of a large land...

1415
02:04:20,966 --> 02:04:24,065
... Shyam Kumar, son
of Mr. Kamal Kumar.

1416
02:04:24,145 --> 02:04:27,976
- Junior Landlord.  - all right.
- What do you mean, Dad?

1417
02:04:28,329 --> 02:04:31,995
- Yes, son.  Let's go.
- Listen, Kamal.

1418
02:04:32,707 --> 02:04:34,508
Good day next Monday.

1419
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:37,912
Can I arrange your wedding
with the contractor's daughter?

1420
02:04:38,494 --> 02:04:41,230
Dad, why are you in such a hurry to get married?

1421
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:44,619
When you hear the name
marriage, you get nervous.

1422
02:04:44,987 --> 02:04:47,495
You brought this
orphan home. I agreed.

1423
02:04:47,799 --> 02:04:49,385
As soon as he arrived he started calling me Grandpa.

1424
02:04:49,409 --> 02:04:51,995
I agreed.  I agree
with all your wishes.

1425
02:04:52,011 --> 02:04:53,756
But you will never obey me.

1426
02:04:53,795 --> 02:04:55,454
Please keep my dignity as a son.

1427
02:04:55,954 --> 02:04:58,758
Dad, I obey you, right?

1428
02:04:58,838 --> 02:05:01,620
Now you too must obey your father.

1429
02:05:01,832 --> 02:05:05,620
He's happy too, and I'm getting a mom too.

1430
02:05:06,495 --> 02:05:09,370
Please agree, son.
At least listen to him.

1431
02:05:09,955 --> 02:05:13,995
Dad, please agree.
Do not be stubborn like children.

1432
02:05:14,075 --> 02:05:17,037
If you're stubborn, I'm
going to the orphanage.

1433
02:05:20,607 --> 02:05:24,662
- All right, Dad.
- Very good.  Now you are a good father.

1434
02:05:24,915 --> 02:05:29,579
- Grandpa, start getting ready for the wedding.
- Yes.

1435
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:35,120
Sir agreed to something he
could never do, surprisingly.

1436
02:05:35,204 --> 02:05:37,901
This little kid did it in an instant.

1437
02:05:38,469 --> 02:05:43,586
However, he at least agreed.

1438
02:05:47,429 --> 02:05:49,201
- Madhava.
- Yes.

1439
02:05:51,426 --> 02:05:54,663
Throw this glass and bottle out.

1440
02:05:55,181 --> 02:05:56,775
God, how do you do that?

1441
02:05:56,855 --> 02:05:59,476
Madhava, he is right.
Throw them all out.

1442
02:05:59,556 --> 02:06:00,863
Thank God for this.

1443
02:06:03,355 --> 02:06:04,425
Disgusting.

1444
02:06:13,367 --> 02:06:17,004
- Dad, is that a temple?
- Yes, son.

1445
02:06:18,288 --> 02:06:22,382
- It is the temple of Lord Krishna.
- God Krishna?  - Yes.

1446
02:06:22,808 --> 02:06:25,063
I'm sure my balls are there.

1447
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:29,642
Should I go and see him?
Can i go  Will you come with me?

1448
02:06:29,924 --> 02:06:33,799
- Yes, baby.  Let's go.
- You are the best father.

1449
02:06:42,491 --> 02:06:47,788
- I came first.
- Good.  Shyam wins!

1450
02:06:48,188 --> 02:06:49,869
Shyam go and bow your head and come quickly.

1451
02:06:49,949 --> 02:06:51,521
You come too, Dad.

1452
02:06:51,794 --> 02:06:56,796
- No, baby.  I can not face Lord Krishna.
- Why is that?

1453
02:06:57,958 --> 02:07:00,491
- He's angry with me.
- Why is that?

1454
02:07:00,574 --> 02:07:02,453
I will make you two friends again.

1455
02:07:02,742 --> 02:07:05,865
Shyam I know you
win God's heart too...

1456
02:07:06,241 --> 02:07:09,824
... with your innocent smile.
You're my good son, aren't you?

1457
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:12,619
Then listen to me.
Go and bow and come quickly.

1458
02:07:12,699 --> 02:07:16,908
- I'll wait for you.
- You're so stubborn.  - Please go.

1459
02:07:18,056 --> 02:07:22,158
Sir, after showing a ray of
light, why this darkness again?

1460
02:07:23,026 --> 02:07:27,616
Where is my son?
Please let me meet him.

1461
02:07:37,158 --> 02:07:41,776
God, did Bola come here?
How is his leg now?

1462
02:07:41,949 --> 02:07:45,229
I want to see him.

1463
02:07:46,699 --> 02:07:48,578
Krishna, why don't you talk?

1464
02:07:48,658 --> 02:07:53,101
Aren't you talking and
your mouth is full of butter?

1465
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:55,283
Please speak.  Please speak.

1466
02:08:00,991 --> 02:08:02,165
Bola.

1467
02:08:07,033 --> 02:08:12,106
"You are our mother, you are our father"

1468
02:08:12,186 --> 02:08:17,119
"You are our brother, you are our friend"

1469
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:22,241
"You are our mother, you are our father"

1470
02:08:22,321 --> 02:08:27,846
"You are our brother, you are our friend"

1471
02:08:28,116 --> 02:08:33,338
- Shyam... Shyam!  Are you here
- Teacher...?

1472
02:08:33,503 --> 02:08:36,054
Child, do not call me
teacher.  Call me mom.

1473
02:08:36,134 --> 02:08:38,831
I am your mother.  I am your mother.

1474
02:08:38,911 --> 02:08:44,445
- Are you my mother?
- Yes I am.  Call me mom.

1475
02:08:44,783 --> 02:08:49,213
- Mother.
- My child.

1476
02:08:49,353 --> 02:08:51,410
Bola kept his promise.

1477
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:55,283
Krishna told God to
send me a mother too.

1478
02:08:56,283 --> 02:08:59,794
- Shyam, what are you saying?
- My friend, Bola, told me.

1479
02:08:59,997 --> 02:09:02,699
That he would go to Lord Krishna
and send me a mother and a father.

1480
02:09:02,783 --> 02:09:07,241
He sent me a father some time ago.

1481
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:11,494
- Your father, who is he?
- You do not know?

1482
02:09:11,574 --> 02:09:15,241
Mr. Kamal Kumara, son
of land owner Ratan Kumar.

1483
02:09:17,949 --> 02:09:19,699
Who told you he was your father?

1484
02:09:19,908 --> 02:09:22,442
He himself told me.
Who else is telling me?

1485
02:09:22,522 --> 02:09:24,756
He was in the habit
of drinking red liquor.

1486
02:09:24,908 --> 02:09:28,303
I broke his habit, he
became my father.

1487
02:09:28,525 --> 02:09:36,028
Shyam, you stopped his drinking.

1488
02:09:36,385 --> 02:09:38,991
That means my tears...

1489
02:09:41,345 --> 02:09:44,953
Do you like him?
Does he love you?

1490
02:09:45,033 --> 02:09:47,908
Mom if he doesn't love me why...

1491
02:09:47,988 --> 02:09:50,295
... taking me from the
orphanage to his house?

1492
02:09:50,543 --> 02:09:53,908
Mom she loves me so much.

1493
02:09:53,988 --> 02:09:56,040
He's going to make
me a big landlord.

1494
02:09:59,486 --> 02:10:01,783
Lord, you have heard my prayers.

1495
02:10:01,986 --> 02:10:04,752
The Lord even
heard Bola's prayers.

1496
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:11,462
- But something went wrong.
- What is it?

1497
02:10:11,764 --> 02:10:16,574
- Bola sent me one father and two mothers.
- You mean?

1498
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:20,786
- Who's second?
- The father is the one who is going to get married.

1499
02:10:20,866 --> 02:10:26,155
Oh my God, is your father getting married?

1500
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:34,483
Mom, why are you crying?
If Dad doesn't want to get married...

1501
02:10:34,563 --> 02:10:39,472
... I will say no.

1502
02:10:39,552 --> 02:10:43,370
- He will never disobey me.
- Shyam.

1503
02:10:45,538 --> 02:10:48,330
Mom, come on.  I will
let you meet my father.

1504
02:10:48,968 --> 02:10:52,244
- Is he here?
- Yes, he came with me.

1505
02:10:52,324 --> 02:10:56,885
He is standing outside.
He has a very large house.

1506
02:10:56,968 --> 02:11:00,885
I'll give you a bigger
room too.  Come with me.

1507
02:11:01,551 --> 02:11:06,343
- No, baby.  I do not like your father.
- Why is that?

1508
02:11:06,423 --> 02:11:09,301
Did you hit him at school too?

1509
02:11:09,787 --> 02:11:14,176
No, baby.  It's something else.
You are still young.

1510
02:11:14,385 --> 02:11:15,926
I'll tell you when you grow up.

1511
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:19,551
Mom, can I be with you or Dad?

1512
02:11:21,885 --> 02:11:27,176
Shyam, you stay with him.
It is your home.

1513
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:30,135
Shyam, hurry up baby.

1514
02:11:30,218 --> 02:11:35,885
Go to Shyam.  Your
father is talking to you.  Go.

1515
02:11:41,218 --> 02:11:43,885
- Don't tell him I met you.
- Why is that?

1516
02:11:44,385 --> 02:11:47,510
- He will be angry with me.
- All right.

1517
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:52,051
- I'll be back to see you.
- Promise.  - Promise.

1518
02:12:08,016 --> 02:12:10,293
What did Shyam do
inside after all this time?

1519
02:12:10,373 --> 02:12:13,718
- You don't know what I'm doing inside?
- No, I'm not.

1520
02:12:13,798 --> 02:12:17,676
- I saw a lot of things inside.
- Really?  - Yes.

1521
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:22,426
I saw my friend Bola
in the statue of the god.

1522
02:12:22,612 --> 02:12:25,513
Then Bola left.

1523
02:12:25,593 --> 02:12:28,093
Baby, let's go.  It's too late, isn't it?

1524
02:12:28,173 --> 02:12:31,718
- Dad, take this.  - What is it?
- It is an offering to God.

1525
02:12:31,888 --> 02:12:34,843
- It's very tasty.
- it is not.

1526
02:12:35,159 --> 02:12:37,801
You want to feed me
with your little hands, right?

1527
02:12:41,551 --> 02:12:43,885
Yes, it is very tasty.

1528
02:12:45,926 --> 02:12:49,142
My Shyam, in his hand?

1529
02:12:50,133 --> 02:12:54,885
God I can dedicate my
whole life to a vision like this.

1530
02:13:03,801 --> 02:13:07,885
I knew Mr. Kamal
would never reject you.

1531
02:13:08,218 --> 02:13:09,676
It's a good thing he agrees.

1532
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:15,926
- There's something you have to agree on.
- Yes, tell me.

1533
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,900
Kamal's mother always
said he wanted her.

1534
02:13:19,468 --> 02:13:22,010
To perform the marriage of
her child in her own home.

1535
02:13:22,163 --> 02:13:25,464
Why should I oppose it?

1536
02:13:25,676 --> 02:13:28,455
You know Rajni doesn't even have a mother.

1537
02:13:28,535 --> 02:13:30,319
If there were women this could have been argued.

1538
02:13:30,343 --> 02:13:34,385
This house is like our own home.

1539
02:13:34,468 --> 02:13:36,051
I will be here a few days
before my wedding with Rajni.

1540
02:13:36,093 --> 02:13:37,776
It's good to have a wedding here.

1541
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:41,743
- Or we can salt water in his house...
- Madhav.

1542
02:13:54,026 --> 02:13:56,026
Sir, congratulations on your marriage.

1543
02:13:56,235 --> 02:13:57,941
Hello, congratulations.

1544
02:13:58,021 --> 02:14:01,326
Congratulations to me too.
This is my father's wedding.

1545
02:14:02,818 --> 02:14:05,725
Dad, what kind of person are you?

1546
02:14:05,972 --> 02:14:09,566
Why is your face like this
even on your wedding day?

1547
02:14:10,027 --> 02:14:13,881
OK, do not answer.
I'm going to see my new mom.

1548
02:14:23,188 --> 02:14:27,024
God I married him before you.

1549
02:14:27,341 --> 02:14:30,571
I promised his father that
I would be heartbroken.

1550
02:14:30,651 --> 02:14:34,899
In front of you.  And when
you hear this wedding music?

1551
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:37,634
Why God, my heart is on fire.

1552
02:14:38,625 --> 02:14:41,941
Please give me strength.
Give me strength.

1553
02:14:42,024 --> 02:14:43,732
To fulfill my promise.

1554
02:14:44,463 --> 02:14:45,607
Please give me strength.

1555
02:14:46,732 --> 02:14:50,589
Mom I never knew my
mom was so beautiful.

1556
02:14:50,735 --> 02:14:52,774
Rajani, congratulations.
You have a son.

1557
02:14:52,857 --> 02:14:54,149
Even before your wedding.

1558
02:14:55,229 --> 02:14:57,941
Rajani Is this your
husband's second marriage?

1559
02:15:00,902 --> 02:15:04,855
New mom you
shine like lightning.

1560
02:15:05,002 --> 02:15:06,842
Get out of here.
What are you here for?

1561
02:15:07,319 --> 02:15:12,857
I came to my dad getting married...

1562
02:15:12,937 --> 02:15:17,316
- See if it suits my mother.
- what?

1563
02:15:18,161 --> 02:15:22,609
You are a bad mother.  I will
not let you marry my father.

1564
02:15:22,689 --> 02:15:24,476
I go to my teacher mother.

1565
02:15:24,556 --> 02:15:27,186
Now what is this new question?
Who is this teacher?

1566
02:15:27,399 --> 02:15:30,686
She is a very good mother.
If he saw you hitting me...

1567
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:33,107
... he will not keep you.

1568
02:15:33,357 --> 02:15:36,216
what are you doing here?

1569
02:15:36,396 --> 02:15:38,097
Who are you to ask that?

1570
02:15:38,877 --> 02:15:40,109
father!

1571
02:15:43,101 --> 02:15:44,606
I'm sure there's some secret here.

1572
02:15:44,686 --> 02:15:46,372
Otherwise how can an
orphan get so much freedom.

1573
02:15:46,396 --> 02:15:49,024
He dares to make fun
of people as he pleases.

1574
02:15:49,626 --> 02:15:51,542
Don't you remember
Mr. Kamal the other day...

1575
02:15:51,566 --> 02:15:53,649
... went with him without
listening to my song.

1576
02:15:53,943 --> 02:15:55,941
Daughter, do not worry about this.

1577
02:15:56,021 --> 02:15:57,857
I will tame him.

1578
02:15:58,017 --> 02:16:01,546
- Come on, get out of here.
- Are you trying to control me?

1579
02:16:01,626 --> 02:16:03,532
You can tie horses
with your mustache.

1580
02:16:03,774 --> 02:16:06,316
Do not try to scare me.
Do you know who I am?

1581
02:16:06,441 --> 02:16:07,441
Who are you

1582
02:16:07,521 --> 02:16:09,321
I am the son of Mr. Ratan
Kumara, the owner of a large land...

1583
02:16:09,396 --> 02:16:12,658
... Shyam Kumar, son
of Mr. Kamal Kumar.

1584
02:16:12,738 --> 02:16:15,566
- Future landlord.
- Future landlord?

1585
02:16:15,646 --> 02:16:18,257
- Get out of here.
- I'm leaving.

1586
02:16:18,437 --> 02:16:22,932
Let me tell you what
happens to your mustache.

1587
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,563
Drive fast.

1588
02:16:35,693 --> 02:16:38,381
Dad, there is a problem here.

1589
02:16:38,949 --> 02:16:43,381
I think I will be like a
housemaid after I get married.

1590
02:16:44,574 --> 02:16:46,986
Baby, don't worry.
Let the marriage happen.

1591
02:16:47,132 --> 02:16:50,267
It's my job to cheat
on them after marriage.

1592
02:16:50,347 --> 02:16:54,384
- Landlord's property can be taken.
- He's not as stupid as you.

1593
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:59,090
He's a bit of an idiot.
I will take care of the rest.

1594
02:16:59,381 --> 02:17:03,548
- How dare you...
- No, Madhav, no.  We have to think logically.

1595
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:08,130
Somehow this marriage has to happen.

1596
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:19,256
- Where is my teacher mom?
- Teacher mom...?  - Yes.

1597
02:17:19,385 --> 02:17:23,465
I went to her house.  There
she found out she was here.

1598
02:17:23,794 --> 02:17:26,923
- Gayathri?  - Yes.
- She went out.

1599
02:17:27,003 --> 02:17:29,006
- Her father's name is inside.
- Inside...?  - Yes.

1600
02:17:33,012 --> 02:17:37,265
The toffee guy.  You are here.

1601
02:17:37,411 --> 02:17:41,483
So, you are the father of my teacher mother.

1602
02:17:41,563 --> 02:17:43,881
Where is my grandfather, my mother?

1603
02:17:44,099 --> 02:17:47,070
Your mother?  Who told
you she was your mother?

1604
02:17:47,362 --> 02:17:52,529
you do not know anything.
Mom said she was my mom.

1605
02:17:52,725 --> 02:17:55,756
Dad said he was my dad.

1606
02:17:55,836 --> 02:17:59,797
If parents can't get married...

1607
02:17:59,931 --> 02:18:04,340
... What is the use
of being their son?

1608
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:06,840
Who is your father?

1609
02:18:07,013 --> 02:18:10,548
My father was the youngest
landowner in Wasanthapur.

1610
02:18:11,215 --> 02:18:12,731
Okay, I'll go now.

1611
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:15,879
Tell mom to get ready.

1612
02:18:15,959 --> 02:18:18,673
I'll send the car.
Tell her to come right away.

1613
02:18:18,753 --> 02:18:21,673
The wedding should take
place today.  Welcome!

1614
02:18:21,756 --> 02:18:24,923
Baby, what do you say?
Do not cause any problems.

1615
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:28,548
Drive fast.

1616
02:18:32,506 --> 02:18:33,631
Shyam.

1617
02:18:38,214 --> 02:18:41,048
Shyam, son Shyam.

1618
02:18:48,397 --> 02:18:50,673
Shyam, wait.

1619
02:18:52,673 --> 02:18:54,861
My father is not in the room.

1620
02:18:54,941 --> 02:18:56,566
He went to the bungalow.
I tried to stop him.

1621
02:18:56,590 --> 02:18:59,631
- But he did not listen.  He shouted, Shyam.
- Shyam.

1622
02:19:01,999 --> 02:19:03,336
Dear Shyam.

1623
02:19:11,446 --> 02:19:16,090
No problem.  That orphan
is friendly with Kamal.

1624
02:19:16,373 --> 02:19:20,954
When he said anything.
You are a wise person.

1625
02:19:21,034 --> 02:19:22,965
Why are you upset about the baby?

1626
02:19:23,045 --> 02:19:25,173
Now the auspicious time has passed.

1627
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:30,673
Sir, I trust you completely.

1628
02:19:30,885 --> 02:19:32,715
But if I think I have
a doubt in my heart.

1629
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:35,756
If you want to clear my doubts...

1630
02:19:35,894 --> 02:19:38,673
... I can transfer all your
property to my daughter's name.

1631
02:19:39,404 --> 02:19:41,840
Is this a condition for marriage?

1632
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:44,756
All right then.

1633
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,990
I do not need to keep my
property with me when I die.

1634
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:49,641
It's the same for Kamal and Rajni.

1635
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:52,574
I will write them.  I promise.

1636
02:19:52,654 --> 02:19:55,881
Thank you.  If Sir is not in trouble.

1637
02:19:55,965 --> 02:20:00,048
- Please sign this.
- Sign?

1638
02:20:01,625 --> 02:20:05,465
- Do you not believe my word?
- Of course I believe.

1639
02:20:05,545 --> 02:20:07,631
But it should be satisfied.

1640
02:20:07,907 --> 02:20:11,715
Contractor, you were the first
person I ever met in my life...

1641
02:20:12,010 --> 02:20:14,381
... insulted my family's self-esteem.

1642
02:20:15,010 --> 02:20:17,923
Do you think that I am
not keeping my word?

1643
02:20:18,532 --> 02:20:20,810
Don't you know
that I want to die...

1644
02:20:21,324 --> 02:20:24,173
... rather than going against a promise.

1645
02:20:24,533 --> 02:20:27,840
- Who do you think I am?
- Grandpa, how are you...

1646
02:20:27,923 --> 02:20:30,567
... understands this idiot.  That
I had a good mom for my dad.

1647
02:20:30,647 --> 02:20:35,256
Look at this little
boy and his courage.

1648
02:20:36,298 --> 02:20:40,004
Wait, where are you running?

1649
02:20:40,256 --> 02:20:43,881
- Where are you going?  Get out of this house.
- father.

1650
02:20:44,072 --> 02:20:48,881
- father.  - The naughty child.
- Contractor, leave him.

1651
02:20:48,965 --> 02:20:52,256
- father.  - Shyam.
- father.  father.

1652
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:55,840
- Contractor, leave him.
- Get out of here.  - Mother.

1653
02:20:56,316 --> 02:20:58,256
- Shyam, my child.
- Mother.

1654
02:20:58,417 --> 02:21:00,173
Shyam, where are you?

1655
02:21:00,253 --> 02:21:02,631
Stop it.  No sympathy.

1656
02:21:02,711 --> 02:21:05,523
- Assaulting a child?  Whether you are human or not.
- Stop.

1657
02:21:05,548 --> 02:21:06,717
what happened?

1658
02:21:10,631 --> 02:21:11,659
You.

1659
02:21:13,455 --> 02:21:15,301
Shyam, what are you doing here?

1660
02:21:15,474 --> 02:21:18,753
- come to me.
- No, Dad.  She is my mother.

1661
02:21:18,965 --> 02:21:20,540
- Mother?
- Yes.

1662
02:21:20,715 --> 02:21:24,235
Gayathri, were you born to block me?

1663
02:21:24,548 --> 02:21:27,745
At every step of my life?

1664
02:21:28,465 --> 02:21:30,673
I considered this child
to be a support to me...

1665
02:21:30,753 --> 02:21:34,512
... to my miserable and empty life.

1666
02:21:35,548 --> 02:21:37,711
Today you are stealing it.

1667
02:21:37,791 --> 02:21:40,715
By naming you as his mother.

1668
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:44,491
Tell me, what is the proof
that you are his mother?

1669
02:21:44,673 --> 02:21:47,441
There is no evidence for
everything in this world.

1670
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:52,118
Man has never seen God,
but still believes in him.

1671
02:21:52,381 --> 02:21:53,899
Because there is no answer...

1672
02:21:53,923 --> 02:21:55,363
... Do you take God's name for granted?

1673
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,923
To this day, I live
by the grace of God.

1674
02:21:58,923 --> 02:22:00,840
People always missed me.

1675
02:22:01,506 --> 02:22:05,506
- Son, let's go.  This world is not for us.
- Wait.

1676
02:22:05,806 --> 02:22:07,899
You can not take
this child with you.

1677
02:22:07,923 --> 02:22:13,847
- Mr. Young Landlord.
- father.  - Shyam is her son.

1678
02:22:14,146 --> 02:22:16,961
If he was her son, why did
he stay in the orphanage?

1679
02:22:17,548 --> 02:22:19,881
When he was born I
left him in an orphanage.

1680
02:22:20,216 --> 02:22:24,308
I was afraid of what
people would say.

1681
02:22:24,631 --> 02:22:27,303
Prevent me Gayathri from
falling into the dark for years...

1682
02:22:27,465 --> 02:22:29,135
... I said her son was dead.

1683
02:22:29,215 --> 02:22:33,211
But a few days ago I
told him who Shyam was.

1684
02:22:33,756 --> 02:22:37,229
Do you know who the
father of this child is?

1685
02:22:38,505 --> 02:22:42,528
No sir, I scolded
her many times.

1686
02:22:43,090 --> 02:22:45,302
But she did not say that.

1687
02:22:45,631 --> 02:22:50,465
How can she say that?
Who openly admits their guilt?

1688
02:22:51,131 --> 02:22:54,340
Talk.  Tell us who the
father of this child is.

1689
02:22:55,465 --> 02:22:58,423
Why are you silent?  Why not talk?

1690
02:22:58,724 --> 02:23:01,584
You know about this kid.
Tell us who his father is.

1691
02:23:01,631 --> 02:23:05,691
No, I can not tell anyone.

1692
02:23:05,771 --> 02:23:11,090
I'm not saying that.
Dad threatened to kill me.

1693
02:23:11,173 --> 02:23:16,676
But I wanted to die,
not open my mouth.

1694
02:23:16,979 --> 02:23:22,616
The whole world made
fun of me but I am still silent.

1695
02:23:23,215 --> 02:23:26,465
Except for me, the only
god in the sky and...

1696
02:23:26,548 --> 02:23:29,744
... someone on earth knows
who my child's father is.

1697
02:23:30,006 --> 02:23:32,277
Save his honor...

1698
02:23:32,357 --> 02:23:36,412
... I made my
life a living hell.

1699
02:23:37,173 --> 02:23:41,111
This secret will always be in my life.

1700
02:23:41,506 --> 02:23:44,006
Even if I die, I will
never reveal this secret.

1701
02:23:45,253 --> 02:23:47,340
Dad, let's go.

1702
02:23:49,419 --> 02:23:53,798
Senior, I do not
bother you anymore.

1703
02:23:54,298 --> 02:23:59,162
Please do not yell at
the inferior landlord.

1704
02:23:59,381 --> 02:24:01,506
Shyam... Shyam!

1705
02:24:02,135 --> 02:24:04,628
We will end this question here.

1706
02:24:04,883 --> 02:24:06,486
The wedding auspicious time is dawning.

1707
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:10,131
What marriage?
A marriage does not happen.

1708
02:24:10,215 --> 02:24:13,631
- What do you mean?
- I have a lot to say.

1709
02:24:13,711 --> 02:24:15,783
Today I learned the meaning of life.

1710
02:24:16,506 --> 02:24:19,229
I thought honor meant
money, property...

1711
02:24:19,381 --> 02:24:21,634
... and called false pride.

1712
02:24:21,764 --> 02:24:24,144
But today I learned what
a clear conscience is.

1713
02:24:24,215 --> 02:24:30,756
More than all the wealth in the world.
The oath is worth a lot.

1714
02:24:32,048 --> 02:24:33,648
I am rich.  People respect me.

1715
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:36,542
But today I learned about a clean
conscience because of my money

1716
02:24:37,548 --> 02:24:39,392
I have no respect here.

1717
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:41,430
All those honors should
go to Mrs. Gayathri.

1718
02:24:41,465 --> 02:24:46,298
She kept her promise as
a mother raises her child.

1719
02:24:47,256 --> 02:24:48,656
Mrs. Gayathri is my niece.

1720
02:24:49,368 --> 02:24:53,045
Shyam is Kamal's son.
He is the light of my house.

1721
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:58,456
- Dad, what are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth, son.

1722
02:24:59,090 --> 02:25:02,215
I'm telling the truth.
I am guilty.

1723
02:25:03,548 --> 02:25:06,423
Save my family's false pride...

1724
02:25:06,506 --> 02:25:08,906
... I forced Gayathri
to give me a promise.

1725
02:25:10,196 --> 02:25:11,608
She succumbed to my pressure.

1726
02:25:11,897 --> 02:25:13,504
She was hiding the truth.

1727
02:25:14,595 --> 02:25:17,676
Excuse me daughter.

1728
02:25:17,756 --> 02:25:24,687
- Sir.
- Narayan, don't call me sir.  Call me your cousin.

1729
02:25:24,767 --> 02:25:28,972
If you intend to make
employees your relatives...

1730
02:25:29,056 --> 02:25:33,181
... so why did you
insult us to come?

1731
02:25:33,809 --> 02:25:37,000
Do you think I will be silent?
I will destroy them all.

1732
02:25:37,482 --> 02:25:38,516
Daughter, let's get out of here.

1733
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:41,297
- Contractor, do not forget to take your stick.
- Get out of here!

1734
02:25:41,971 --> 02:25:49,556
Gayathri I suspect you
have committed a grave sin.

1735
02:25:51,347 --> 02:25:54,403
- I'm so disgusted.
- do not say that.

1736
02:25:54,889 --> 02:25:57,764
There is nothing wrong with either of these.

1737
02:25:58,309 --> 02:26:01,194
What are you two talking about?

1738
02:26:01,351 --> 02:26:07,764
No one talks to me.
Tell me aren't you my parents?

1739
02:26:08,597 --> 02:26:13,347
Yes baby.  We are your parents.

1740
02:26:18,274 --> 02:26:21,639
daughter in law.  You
really belong in our house.

1741
02:26:22,291 --> 02:26:26,597
Get home for this auspicious time.  Come on.

1742
02:26:29,767 --> 02:26:35,864
No, first I will say 1, 2, 3.
Then set foot in the house.

1743
02:26:36,023 --> 02:26:40,110
Get ready.  1, 2, 3.

1744
02:26:42,344 --> 02:26:43,556
Come on.

1745
02:26:50,181 --> 02:26:54,286
