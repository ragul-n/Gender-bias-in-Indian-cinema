1
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,958
Who's there?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,667
Miaow!

3
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:28,292
As you entered this house
like a thief

4
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,458
I'll disarm you with the punishment
that a thief deserves …

5
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,083
If the snake enters
the nest of an eagle,

6
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,000
does it ever get the chance
to return to its hole? …

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,208
Villain …

8
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,833
Who prompted you to enter
this place … you devil!

9
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,208
Clan...

10
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,375
No Ma! … This can't go on...

11
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,792
I'll read in Houston that
the house has been robbed...

12
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:09,375
and my mother becomes a heroine,
after beating up the robber...

13
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,875
and she had …
all the ammunitions …

14
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,625
stick … chili powder …
and what was the other thing?

15
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,167
Banana peel …
that actually made him skid …

16
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,750
Mom!

17
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,500
I want to tell you something …

18
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,375
you will not stay here alone! …

19
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,750
I'll not go anywhere
leaving this house …

20
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,667
not until I board the pyre …

21
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,333
Why all of you are silent?

22
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:35,125
I don't understand what's
there in this house?

23
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,583
… Rather what's there in this city?

24
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,750
Your father's memories …

25
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,750
Every room in this house
contains his memories!

26
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,250
This house may not
be important to you …

27
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,667
but to me ...it is.

28
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:48,375
We have our traditional family idol and
we take care of him regularly …

29
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,667
Leaving Radha Gobindo alone,
I'll not go anywhere …

30
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:54,542
Why're you speaking in English so
frequently have you forgotten Bengali?

31
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,583
Ok ok … let me intervene …

32
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,958
Aunty (Mashima) …
to be very honest …

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,917
this city is no longer safe
for elderly people…

34
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,292
You need not be bothered
about my security …

35
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,208
I've crossed seventy …
can you make out?

36
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,417
Going up and down this four storied
house continuously …no palpitation!

37
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,417
But Mukti, from now on
we'll have to engage a caretaker …

38
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:23,708
Jethu (uncle) … we've tried
at least ten caretakers.

39
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,083
First was Dasarath …

40
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,042
Ma never liked Dasarath's face …

41
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,375
because he used to chew
'paan' all the time …

42
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,208
Having 'paan' again?

43
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,625
The other one was …

44
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,500
Dinu …
Correct! Dinu …

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,333
Complaint against Dinu was that
he was always half-naked!

46
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:46,917
Exposing that sweaty
pot -bellied naked body! Obnoxious!

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,792
Then there was Haran …

48
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,000
what was his fault?

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,208
He smoked 'biri' …

50
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,250
Then came Ramprasad …
now what about him Ma?

51
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:01,708
Never heard of Sukanta …
Sukanta Bhattacharya …

52
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:06,375
Su-kan-to …
never heard of him … is it?

53
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,417
Get out of here!

54
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,875
How can I keep such
a person in this house?

55
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,750
So you've understood uncle …

56
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:17,375
Eventually, Ma successfully drove
every caretaker out of this house …

57
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,167
Deservedly so...

58
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:23,167
Listen Mukti... a caretaker
has to be engaged …

59
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
I can't support you...

60
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,833
otherwise sell this
house and go to Houston.

61
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,208
Ok ok!

62
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,042
Mashima... one last try!

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,708
Let's see …

64
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,542
whom we discover…

65
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:49,125
On the cornice of the first floor,
an elderly woman's body was found.

66
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,500
Her head tilted to the left …

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,417
strangled with a saree …

68
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,500
that dangled from a window
on the fourth floor …

69
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,625
According to the police, strangling
oneself in this manner is rare.

70
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:11,417
Excellent Bhaba! Wonderful!

71
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,208
Read the headline …

72
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:17,208
Was the old woman's suicide
caused by depression?

73
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,792
There is some more dada …

74
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,333
Sangita debi was,
once, a school teacher …

75
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,750
but was, recently,
suffering from depression …

76
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,125
Wanted to shift to an old age home …
as her son lives abroad …

77
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,500
felt lonely after her
husband's death!

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,167
It's the same everywhere …

79
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,458
Depression, then … suicide …

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:46,667
Above 60 … lives alone
son settled abroad …

81
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:53,208
vulture … "Vulture Bapi"
starts flying overhead...

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,750
to grab it... with it's claws!

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
There is a signature to it …

84
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,292
a style of its own...
you will recognise

85
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,625
"Vulture" Bapi's presence …

86
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,375
And look at this guy …

87
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,875
compare Bhaba with him …

88
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,542
I asked him to
slightly threaten mashima …

89
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,667
just pose a threat …

90
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,125
he himself got beaten up …

91
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:22,458
Look at his red eyes …
as if he has conjunctivitis …

92
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,167
Now it seems
it's better to get rid of him

93
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,083
and take mashima in my gang …

94
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,042
I want mashima's "Gobindo Dham" …

95
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,250
I've given my word …

96
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,625
and taken an advance …

97
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,458
By any means, whatsoever …

98
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,250
either posing a threat …

99
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,792
or by applying Bhaba's technique …

100
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,583
depression …

101
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,000
the Vulture's claw…

102
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,292
You still have the same sharpness…

103
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,667
Continuing practice?
Regularly sir …

104
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,792
swimming, karate, rifle …
one never forgets all these …

105
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,708
just need to practice for reflex …

106
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,708
Very good!

107
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,625
What about your work?

108
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,750
Nothing sir!

109
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,292
Had you been to
the places I referred you?

110
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,542
Recommended you to quite
a few places …

111
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,542
Your recommendations earned me
only a cup of tea …

112
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,875
allowed me to sit in the reception …
but no one offers job to a convict …

113
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,792
that too after 9 long years
of imprisonment …

114
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,625
Who told you to mention …

115
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,792
that you had been in prison
for 9 years or so?

116
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,083
Sir, I can't tell lies …

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,458
Listen!

118
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,208
There's a job …

119
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,792
of a caretaker …

120
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,583
at one of my friends' house …

121
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,458
my friend stays abroad …

122
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,875
He'll pay you well …

123
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,125
only you'll have to
take care of his mother …

124
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,583
Is she handicapped?

125
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,625
Completely fit …

126
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Recently she made the headlines
by beating up robbers …

127
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,458
Then she can take
the best care of herself …

128
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,583
Tareq …

129
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:53,250
You'll have to stay in this house
for a minimum of one year …

130
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,417
then only you can prove to
the senior officers that

131
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,417
you can mix with the mainstream
after getting out of jail …

132
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:03,333
Just for one year …
you'll have to stay in this house …

133
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,458
with no complaints … honestly …

134
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,250
and without any criminal case …

135
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,500
Tareq …

136
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
please don't miss this chance …

137
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,333
just for one year …

138
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,250
I believe you can do it …

139
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,542
Yes sir.

140
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:21,000
Hey! You're here?

141
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,875
Come, sit!

142
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,417
Please sit!

143
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,333
Sir! I'm Tareq Ali …

144
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,625
Had been in jail for nine years …

145
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,250
for ten extortion cases …
and two murder cases …

146
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,083
I didn't murder sir!

147
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,000
Shot in the leg in self defence …

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,458
and the other one was in the shoulder …

149
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,167
They've released me
for lack of evidence …

150
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,625
You should mention …

151
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,833
it's also for your good conduct …

152
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,333
Yes!

153
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,000
So...

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Can you get a better
caretaker than him?

155
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,167
Just a minute!

156
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,375
What happened?

157
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,500
An ex-convict…

158
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,750
Name … Tareq Ali …

159
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,542
What's the name of the house? …

160
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,500
'Gobindo Dham' …

161
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,208
Radha Gobindo are
established in the house …

162
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,125
You know Ma very well Ritam …

163
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,583
Impossible … that's the word …

164
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,667
Ma will never agree to this …
gone totally mad?

165
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,458
Anirban!

166
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,792
The man who can
admit to his crime …

167
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,833
and wishes to reform...

168
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,792
to do good work …

169
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,417
to mix with the mainstream …

170
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,042
Should we not give him a chance?

171
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,250
Let's see...

172
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:44,583
...if Tareq Ali is accepted by Lord
Gobindo in his 'Gobindo Dham' …

173
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,542
let's try! …

174
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,208
Now give the things …

175
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,333
Here …

176
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,750
Take care …

177
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,333
Who's there?

178
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,500
Jhuma …

179
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:59,250
Mashima … have done your shopping.

180
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,167
1 kg flour … 500gms. 'maida' …

181
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,000
Fortune Kacchi Ghani mustard oil …

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,875
two bottles of Phenyl …

183
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,125
'scotch brite' and soap …

184
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,250
and with that your favourite
puffed rice sweets …

185
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,208
Toffee nuts...

186
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,333
and also brought two new
'dhotis' for your Thakur (deity) …

187
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,042
Eh .. keep it there

188
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:34,000
Along with that your Thakur's (deity)
mango and coconut sweet.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,750
Oh … you had mentioned about
newly beautifying your Thakur (deity) …

190
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,417
told about Rabida …
don't you remember?

191
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,208
He made the idol at Rashuda's
house … a master artist …

192
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,833
said he'll do it …

193
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,708
Ma said – tell mashima...

194
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,417
… being born in a Brahmin family,
he'll take good care of your deity...

195
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,333
What's the time?

196
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:59,083
What's the time that you're
leaving stealthily?

197
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,417
Now you're waking up my deity
after one o' clock in the afternoon?

198
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,833
When did you yourself wake up?

199
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,750
At 7 o' clock in the morning mashima …

200
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,375
Must have had tea?

201
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:12,000
Unless I have tea I
do not feel the urge …

202
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,292
Don't you feel ashamed? …

203
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,583
After having food,
you'll touch my deity?

204
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,458
What kind of unholy activity
is being practiced here?

205
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,667
That's why thieves and dacoits
are sneaking in here …

206
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,042
Save me Lord! Save me!

207
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,375
Do you remember …
it is Kartik Purnima today?

208
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,167
Oh yes mashima!

209
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:34,458
Today Radha had danced with
Krishna … it's called Rashnritya …

210
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,292
you'll decorate
Radha-Krishna beautifully …

211
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,542
have you brought the garland?

212
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,333
Mm … umm…

213
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,083
Bring a thick garland
in the evening … now go …

214
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,750
Aren't you wearing
an under garment?

215
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,417
Yes Madam!

216
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,500
No no! Stand there!

217
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,125
Fie on you!
Worn a 'dhoti' without underwear?

218
00:14:56,167 --> 00:15:00,167
How terrible... women live here …
don't you feel ashamed?

219
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,875
Actually, mashima
I've only two underwears …

220
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,833
wife has given both of them for washing …
it will never happen again …

221
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,042
I'll give you money …buy four underwears …
wash them and wear …

222
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,042
so that I do not have
to see this any more …

223
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,792
All this happens only to me …

224
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,792
Fie! Fie! What a shame!

225
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,250
Ma!

226
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,208
See who's here!

227
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,625
Take off your shoes here!

228
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,167
Your new caretaker!

229
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,792
So?

230
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,750
So huge!

231
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,417
What's your name?

232
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,792
Tareq … Tareq Ali …

233
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,542
What?

234
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,125
Tarak …

235
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,333
Tarak ma!

236
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,125
Tarak what?
I mean what's the surname?

237
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:43,500
Guha … Tarak Guha …

238
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,083
There's Tarak Guchhait in
Sanjib Chattopadyay's story …

239
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
he's Tarak Guha...

240
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,125
… a tom cat …

241
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,708
Why have you kept such long hair?

242
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:00,000
Like an animal … long hair …
long nails … what's this?

243
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,375
Listen … there are
many rules in this house …

244
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,458
There you can see …
that's your room …

245
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,458
you'll stay there …

246
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:12,417
show him his plate, bowl, glass,
cot, bedding, bucket, mug …

247
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,833
Our main gate closes
at 10 o' clock in the night …

248
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:19,250
Your bathroom is outside the house …

249
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,083
therefore, whatever you've to do …

250
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,208
you'll have to do it before 10 …

251
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,250
And if I need to go the bathroom in the night?
You'll not go!

252
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,250
You'll suppress the urge …
Suppress it …

253
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,583
In our Kamala Girls' School,

254
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,250
no one could go to the toilet
in the first two periods …

255
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,917
very strict … very very strict …

256
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,042
Correct …

257
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,125
As many times as you
go to the bathroom …

258
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,208
take a bath …
wash your clothes yourself!

259
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,708
Do you listen to Hindi songs?

260
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,042
Yes!

261
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,292
That's not allowed in this house …

262
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
Mobiles to be shut off after 10pm!

263
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,750
You never stayed in a boarding …
otherwise you would have known.

264
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,500
Madam, I stayed for 9 years …

265
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,208
Which boarding were you in?

266
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,750
Yes … that …

267
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,542
Alipore …

268
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,125
Which boarding at Alipore?

269
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,583
Alipore … that one … in Alipore …
which is very famous …

270
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,750
in Alipurduar … in Dooars …

271
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,125
he was there in Alipur Dooars'
boarding for 9 years …

272
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,917
Then you must be knowing
all the rules …

273
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,458
Come … touch my feet first
and start your work.

274
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,792
Yes …

275
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,500
Come! Touch my feet...

276
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,375
Why are you standing
and shaking your head?

277
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,875
Go … mind your work!

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,167
Hey, show him everything...

279
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,875
Happy?

280
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,833
Ma, I'm so happy that I
can't express myself!

281
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,958
I'm so relaxed now!

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,125
You are just like your father …

283
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,875
When my maid took leave …

284
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,833
your father used to go and
bring her back …

285
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
Listen! All your pickles have come!

286
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,625
Pickles? But I can't take pickles!

287
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,958
Of course you can!

288
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,667
Oh! What a mess …

289
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,208
Look at this …

290
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,917
… the camp cot is hanging loose …

291
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,000
how will you lie here?

292
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,708
Actually, those who came before
you never used this cot …

293
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:23,708
All of them lay on the floor …
that's why this camp cot is …

294
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,042
Hey! What're you doing?
Why are you loosening the tapes?

295
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,083
Don't loosen them... listen to me!

296
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,167
To hell with it!

297
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:42,083
If one doesn't want to talk to Jhuma,
why should Jhuma bother?

298
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,750
Jhuma doesn't forcibly talk
to anyone …

299
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,625
Here is your...

300
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,042
...bedding …

301
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,833
I'm keeping it here.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,125
And here is your plate,
bowl and glass …

303
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,917
And mashima has already
told you about the toilet rules …

304
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,167
At night, you won't get water …

305
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:17,250
the ferrule has not been changed as yet …
water comes in droplets …

306
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,792
If you need to go at night,
the gate remains closed …

307
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,417
you'll have to scale the gate.

308
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,667
And one more thing …
Radha Gobindo deity is here …

309
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,083
only vegetarian food
is allowed in this house …

310
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,208
you'll have to go outside
for non-veg.

311
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,042
Non-veg food is available
in Jhuma's shop …

312
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,083
you can have it there...

313
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:40,625
mutton Rs.70/- … chicken Rs.60/- …
fish Rs.40/- …and egg Rs.20/- …

314
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,375
Jhuma can also get tea leaves
and biscuits for you

315
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,333
but you'll have to make
the tea yourself …

316
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,750
and after having food,
you'll have to clean your own utensils …

317
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:08,750
Actually you know, when Jhuma was
just six, Jhuma's father died …

318
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,417
the liver had completely rotted …

319
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,417
And from then on … Jhuma
and her mother runs the shop …

320
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:20,625
One day mashima said – Jhuma are
you born to only run the shop?

321
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,542
Hearing mashima's words, tears
rolled down from Jhuma's eyes …

322
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,000
Mashima, then, admitted
Jhuma in school …

323
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:30,333
Jhuma is now studying Dance
at the university …

324
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,917
Mashima, then, also helped them
in opening a food joint.

325
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,333
Jhuma can make very
soft and thin 'rotis' …

326
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,208
It is Jhuma who supplies
'rotis' to this house …

327
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,042
O my my!

328
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,458
How beautifully you've made the cot!

329
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Wait! I'm helping you!

330
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,458
It seems you know a lot of work …

331
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,667
Shall I sit here for once?

332
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:58,542
This is wonderful!

333
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,292
What a beautiful cot you've made …

334
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,417
See! How talking to you
has made Jhuma late!

335
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,500
Now Jhuma has work in the kitchen …
classes in the evening …

336
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
then bye!

337
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,333
Should I ask Jhuma to bring
something in the evening?

338
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,542
But remember!
Jhuma doesn't give things on loan!

339
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,583
Who's Jhuma?

340
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,750
Jhuma …

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,167
Jhuma Pal …

342
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,625
Owner of the "Khai Khai"
food joint outside …

343
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:41,542
Bye!

344
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,417
Smoking -- no!

345
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,625
Meat -- no!

346
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,208
Clothes should be spotlessly clean...
Clear pronunciation!

347
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,000
If you perspire,
Hell will break loose...

348
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,833
If you step in the bathroom...
You'll have to take a bath.

349
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,500
What a rule...
Return home by nine!

350
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,792
Then only you will have dinner...
It's a very queer place!

351
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:59,333
Only no! no! no! no! no!
Abide by the rules!

352
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,000
In the name of Mashima...
It's Hitler's hotel!

353
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,250
Beware! Beware! Beware!
If I sniff of smoke...

354
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:41,792
I'll send you out...
And not allow it inside the house.

355
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,833
Hindi songs are also rejected...
What shall I do?

356
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:49,625
If you touch an used plate...
Better wear a wet towel!

357
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:53,292
What a rule...
Return home by nine!

358
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:00,208
Only then will you be allowed
So continue to water the plant!

359
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,792
Only no! no! no! no! no!
Abide by the rules!

360
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,125
In the name of Mashima...
It's Hitler's hotel!

361
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,708
Can't resist you... Mashima!

362
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,417
Go!

363
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,125
What are you seeing?

364
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,042
What? Nothing!

365
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,833
Nothing? Let me also see then!

366
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,417
Can't you speak softly?
Didn't I tell you it's nothing?

367
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,375
Aren't you ashamed to
peep into other's rooms?

368
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,792
You were also peeping...
don't you feel ashamed?

369
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:27,958
I'll also see!

370
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,375
I told you it's nothing!
you are such a sceptic...

371
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,375
Leave my way
or I'll call mashima!

372
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,417
It seemed something went in!

373
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,833
Lizard!

374
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,958
Panditji (Priest)!
A lizard inside your dhoti?

375
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,292
No no! That's a very poisonous thing!

376
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:54,708
It's moving about your body!
Turn round! It's at your back!

377
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,167
No no! It's in the front!

378
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,542
Bring it out!

379
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,542
Panditji!
What's wrong with you?

380
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,875
It's moving around...

381
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,292
Panditji!
Why are you jumping like that?

382
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:14,625
Mashima... a poisonous lizard has
sneaked into my dhoti!

383
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:30,542
Jai Jagannath!
Have to open my dhoti!

384
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,083
Who shat?

385
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,625
Who shat at Gobindodham?

386
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,333
I did...

387
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,375
From now on the rule is...

388
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,833
one who will shit

389
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,750
will go and clean it …

390
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,958
You'll go to Gobindodham …

391
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,833
Bapida! I can't go …

392
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:01,833
What?

393
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,583
I'll get identified …

394
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,292
last time there was direct
eye contact …

395
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,792
Send Ponchu, Shyamal, Chhotu any one …

396
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:12,667
Give me any other work
… any work …

397
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,667
I'll do it …

398
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,750
Stop it!
What did I say?

399
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,792
You will go to Gobindodham …

400
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,792
you yourself will clean your shit …

401
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,042
no one else …

402
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,292
And listen!
Now there's a new caretaker there …

403
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,750
You'll go and tell him …
What?

404
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,083
That if he wants to stay
in this locality

405
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:38,083
he'll have to make offerings
at the temple of vulture …

406
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:42,875
as people make
offerings at the temple of Saturn …

407
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,333
Who's there?

408
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:14,750
What do you want?

409
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,708
Donation...

410
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,208
Donation...?

411
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,375
Donation… for what?

412
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:22,750
For vulture worship …
Sorry! What am I saying?

413
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,708
For Ma Shitala puja!

414
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,958
But now there is no Shitala Puja!

415
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,417
No? …

416
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,292
We take donation in advance …

417
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:32,333
Anyone else in the house? …
I mean anyone senior? …

418
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,250
Hey! Whom are you looking for?

419
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,333
Anyone senior …

420
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:42,542
Mashima!
Someone here is asking for donation…

421
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:46,208
No no!
No need for any donation!

422
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,750
We never take advance …

423
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,667
Who're you? Let me see!

424
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,292
Leave him!

425
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,083
Now get up!

426
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,333
Get up!

427
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,917
Let me see your face, dear boy!

428
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:09,417
Yes! You look very familiar!

429
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,458
Yes! Now I know!
You came here to steal … isn't it?

430
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:18,458
I didn't come to steal Mashima …

431
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,667
Actually, I feel very hungry …

432
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,333
I entered this house to eat something …

433
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:29,375
See! His eyes are still red!

434
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,792
Have not cured as yet …

435
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:34,792
Mashima! I've had no
food for the last 7 days...

436
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,375
Aha! Come with me …
I'll give you food … come …

437
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,667
I'll put eye drops …
come …

438
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,875
No… no …

439
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,500
It's already late in the day …
after all you're a guest …

440
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,250
Mashima! I don't need any food …

441
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,292
I'll eat …

442
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,167
Look he's running away! …

443
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,000
Go! Get that rogue! …

444
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,125
Bapida!

445
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,375
My God!

446
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:20,708
Lord Taraknath!
Take my offerings at your feet!

447
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,417
Everyone makes
their offerings at my temple,

448
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,333
only I'm yet to
receive your offerings!

449
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,000
How do I get to see you my lord?

450
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:41,167
In Ward No.83 not one rod has been
planted without my permission.

451
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:47,708
CC certificate of no building has
been issued without my approval.

452
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,875
I've already taken
the time for Gobindodham …

453
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,542
6 months …

454
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:59,625
...for you I can stretch
it up to one year …

455
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,583
Mashima's last prescription says

456
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,833
she has spondolitis in the neck …

457
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,667
Pressure rises if her son is not here …

458
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,958
Recently the lower one reached 110 …

459
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,417
Takes sleeping pills 1 mg daily …

460
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,417
She has a light sleep …

461
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,500
She has an Ischemic
heart, but it's strong …

462
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,542
Goes straight up to the second floor …

463
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:25,792
Knees are correct …

464
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,542
Apparently, everything is ok …

465
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:32,292
Still Mashima will die …

466
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,167
If I kill her, you'll get nothing …

467
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,083
and if you do it … 10%

468
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,958
Just think …
the deal is for 4 crores …

469
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,792
so 40 lakh …

470
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,875
Depression …
suicide …

471
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:56,042
… death caused by slipping down
the stairs …whichever you wish …

472
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,000
Only you will be arrested …

473
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,625
Headlines will feature your name …

474
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:05,083
"Old woman
murdered by the caretaker …"

475
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,792
You will be jailed …

476
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:10,375
Police will come to reconstruct the death …

477
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,250
From there the deal
will be controlled by me …

478
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:17,000
My police … my lawyer …

479
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,167
will reconstruct the case …

480
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,750
It will never be proved …

481
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,875
You will get released after
serving term for 7 years …

482
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,542
The money will be kept ready …

483
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:29,583
You can take it in advance
or after you come out of jail …

484
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,042
Is that ok?

485
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,833
Disclosing my offer to the police
will not be of any help …

486
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:39,125
because the reconstruction of that
will also be done by me …

487
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,833
Try not to forget Vulture Bapi
Tareq Mia …

488
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,583
How did I know …?

489
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,917
I've already heard the
fairy tales of your life in jail …

490
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,333
Mashima's case should
be child's play for you!

491
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:10,083
The problem is if I kill,
you'll be convicted …

492
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,833
and if you kill,
again you only will be found guilty …

493
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,667
only the percentages will differ …

494
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,625
Remember the date Tareq Mia …

495
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,333
30th September …

496
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,625
Ok! Now I understand!

497
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,667
Will not call you by the old name …
only by your new name …

498
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,875
Call me by a new name …

499
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,792
If you do not remember
me at that time …

500
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:47,333
When I thought our separation
is complete …

501
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:52,333
I was walking without destination,
without purpose …

502
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:57,875
Monsoon clouds hover over the forest

503
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:02,375
Sharp lightning scratches
the breast of the night...

504
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:07,583
Can hear from afar
the ripples of Baruni river...

505
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:14,750
My mind only says...
impossible! It's impossible!

506
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,458
How did you come upstairs?

507
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,333
Your signature is not there
in the register …

508
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,125
Please come down to sign …

509
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,458
Is he your bodyguard?

510
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,083
Bodyguard?! Rubbish!

511
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,125
Don't you know how to
talk to a senior person?

512
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,083
Do you know him?

513
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,375
Do you know how he is related
to this house … do you know?

514
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:39,333
You're asking him to sign the register?

515
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,375
I'll just tear your register book …

516
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,667
He's an outsider …

517
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,125
His name and signature is required
in the register book …

518
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,167
Otherwise how do I know
who is entering this house?

519
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,625
You call him an outsider?
Outsider?

520
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,125
I am compelled to see this
day today, Sajal da...!

521
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,542
Touch his feet!
Seek pardon from him!

522
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,458
No no! He's right!

523
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,042
He's doing his duty!
Don't restrict him!

524
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:07,542
I'll definitely come down
and sign, dear boy...

525
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,958
Ok... It's fine!

526
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,583
Now go away!

527
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,625
See! How you're outwitted …

528
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,250
You could have told me earlier
that Mashima has a boyfriend …

529
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:44,292
Not one, Mashima has
so many boyfriends …

530
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,208
it is just the beginning …

531
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:50,375
they'll come and go …
come and go …

532
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,292
how many of them will
you stop from entering …

533
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,417
adjust your antenna Taraknath!

534
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,583
Did you call the mechanic?

535
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,375
Mechanic's wife is pregnant …
he can't come …

536
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,000
What will happen now?
The pump is burnt …

537
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,500
What do you mean?

538
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,042
The pump runs
throughout the day …

539
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,167
How can you say that?

540
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,792
You're running the pump
at least 5 times a day …

541
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,583
I'm running the pump?

542
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,750
Reservoir is empty;
yet the pump is running...

543
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:25,042
Obviously it will get burnt.

544
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,750
Listen! Do you mean to say
it's my fault? My fault?

545
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,542
Whenever you're using the
bathroom you're washing it,

546
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,208
even washing the balcony …

547
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,667
you're eccentric … a maniac …

548
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,583
What? I'm an eccentric,
a maniac?

549
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,417
It's my bathroom …
I'll wash it …

550
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,167
It's my balcony … I'll wash it …

551
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,167
Previously when the pump
had stopped working …

552
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,708
I mended it by striking
it with a pestle …

553
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,250
Enough to break the pump …

554
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,500
Now I'll have to learn from
him how to repair the pump …

555
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,875
Where are you going?

556
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,667
Arguing with me?
You've learnt to retort?

557
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,042
Want me to call Ani?

558
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,250
I'll call him just now …

559
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,417
A tom cat! …

560
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:24,875
Arguing … your person is retorting
to every word I say …

561
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,125
He is blaming me for
pump's breakdown...

562
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,042
as I use a lot of water …

563
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,417
No! No one will
ever come to this house.

564
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:36,333
No no! Don't put
the whole blame on me Ani …

565
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,542
The person you've sent …

566
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,167
he has so many rules …

567
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,292
Now even Panditji
has to sign the register …

568
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:53,333
calling Sajalbabu an
outsider … an outsider …

569
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:58,042
he's doing whatever
he likes … whatever …

570
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:03,042
insulting people to the extreme …

571
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:07,375
If I fall ill...
I'll not live …

572
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,625
When I depart,
you'll understand …

573
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,583
What happened?
Why are you calling again?

574
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:33,292
You're coming with wife and son
during the summer vacation?

575
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,500
You are not falsely
consoling me, are you?

576
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:42,708
I've a lot of things to share with
my bouma(daughter in law)

577
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,333
Have to go the bank,
open the locker …

578
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,708
will inform bouma about
all the ornaments…

579
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:52,250
will explain everything to her...

580
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:56,542
If you don't need it,
donate it …

581
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,792
Now listen to me!

582
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:02,083
Since you're coming in summer,
don't cancel the Puja trip …

583
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,333
No! I'll paint the house anew …

584
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,083
please come with
your wife and son.

585
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,958
Ani, remember your
ma is aging …

586
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,708
Bye for now!

587
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,583
Turn towards my right … my right …

588
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,708
Turn towards right …
again right Mashima …Again right …

589
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,208
This side?
Yes … turn …

590
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,167
Turn with more speed …
Turn fully …

591
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,542
Fully to the left …
and then fully to the right …

592
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,208
Why are you dancing?
Nothing is happening …

593
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,167
It will Mashima …
Last time we did it like this …

594
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,875
Nothing is happening … nothing …

595
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:48,875
Just move! Move!

596
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,125
Jhuma! Call that tomcat!

597
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,542
Turn fully to the left Mashima!

598
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:56,542
You mean on this side?

599
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,750
Oh my my! Seems he
knows all kinds of work!

600
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,458
Mashima was
saying you restored the pump …

601
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,458
Lifted water in buckets …

602
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,208
Applied fertilizer to the plants
now they are yielding tomatoes … Chilli …

603
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,375
Move away...

604
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,125
Mashima is calling you upstairs …

605
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,875
I'll finish my work …
then go upstairs …

606
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,667
See! She's calling for she needs you!

607
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,417
Give it to me!
I'm mopping the room!

608
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,042
Give … Give …

609
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,750
I can perform my own job.

610
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,583
Told you, mashima is
calling you upstairs …

611
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:55,708
Tarak!

612
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,042
I told you …
he's coming Mashima …

613
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,542
Go! Quick!

614
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,708
Move!

615
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:12,958
Too much...

616
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:21,625
How far did you study?

617
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,458
Class eight …

618
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,875
Why class eight?
Why didn't you study further?

619
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,625
Didn't get the chance …

620
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:36,625
Must have been very bad at studies …
so the school had to drive you out...

621
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,667
Heard of Balasore? Odisha?

622
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,333
I was born there … in a village …

623
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,042
Father deserted us in my childhood …

624
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,833
Mother took care of me...

625
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,667
Came to Kolkata from Balasore …

626
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,833
Mother worked here
as a housemaid …

627
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,250
It was mother who sent me to school …

628
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:01,458
Which school?

629
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,417
In Howrah … near the flower market …

630
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,083
Used to feel very hungry
during the night …

631
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,542
I still remember …
I was in class eight …

632
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,292
Felt very hungry in the night …

633
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,625
Mom gave her food to me …

634
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,500
That day …

635
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,750
What happened that day?

636
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,833
That day I decided – what do
I gain by having education?

637
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,583
I got engaged in a job …

638
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,917
Were you a goon?

639
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,750
You can start your studies again …

640
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,250
Age is no bar…

641
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,833
You! What are you looking at?

642
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,042
Get exercise books and
pencils for him tomorrow …

643
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,417
Ok!

644
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,375
Bring the class eight books on
Bengali, Geography and Maths …

645
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,708
You'll read the newspapers daily …

646
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,708
I'll ask you questions …

647
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,583
Now switch it on …

648
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,083
come on …

649
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,958
Man is wailing …

650
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,667
Stand by him as a human being …

651
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:25,417
Man is setting a trap …
stand by him as a bird …

652
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,750
Man is very lonely …

653
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,333
Come! Stand by his side …

654
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,125
Stop!

655
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:36,417
Man is too lonely … come!
Stand by his side …

656
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:42,500
Why has the poet written this
'ponkti' thrice?

657
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,292
'Ponkti' means the line of a poem …

658
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:50,667
Man is very lonely … so the poet is
asking us to stand by his side …

659
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,333
Like you are lonely,
I've come to stand by you!

660
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:57,375
I'm lonely?

661
00:45:57,417 --> 00:45:59,208
Go away from here …

662
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,667
What is stuffed in your head?

663
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,833
Cowdung?

664
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:10,792
Sikander: What did you write
young man? Tell the truth!

665
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:19,125
Chandragupta: I'll tell the truth Emperor!
Indians have not yet learnt to tell lies.

666
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:27,458
"Indians have not yet learnt to tell lies" –
what is meant by this sentence? Tell me.

667
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,375
Indians have not learnt to bluff …

668
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:33,667
Bluff...?

669
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,000
Stand up … Get up … stand there …

670
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,458
Stand up …

671
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,667
… now hold your ears and stand …

672
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:47,958
Hold your ears …
that's your punishment …

673
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,833
Worthless … you will do nothing …
just nothing in life …

674
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,500
Hold your ears …

675
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:14,833
Sir, you sent me there
to work as a caretaker …

676
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,250
but she's started engaging me
in all sorts of work …

677
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,667
Now she's teaching me …

678
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:21,208
asking me to stand up
holding my ears …

679
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,417
if I fail to answer her questions
she is driving me out of the house …

680
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,417
Sir, this is impossible for me …

681
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:27,917
Please Sir!
Engage some other person!

682
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,375
Tareq!

683
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,667
Given the background that you have,

684
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,125
how many families do you think
will give you an entry?

685
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:39,333
Mashima is teaching you!

686
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,917
Try to understand her concern for you!

687
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:44,125
How many people will do it for you?

688
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,833
I'm telling you –

689
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,292
Just for once win her heart!

690
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,167
You'll find you've got
a whole new lease of life!

691
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,583
Come on!

692
00:47:56,542 --> 00:48:00,042
You know, I acted on stage
only for once in my life!

693
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:01,625
That was the only time I did it!

694
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,792
And my part was that of a dead body …

695
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,542
The director didn't
give even a single dialogue …

696
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:13,000
I was lying there with
eyes shut like a corpse …

697
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:15,292
Suddenly the director
whispered in my ear --

698
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,958
Sajalda! Bring a bit of life!
Life! …

699
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,792
I could not understand how to bring
life into a dead character!

700
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,208
That was the only time I acted in life …

701
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,417
Listen here!

702
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,042
Bedcovers … curtains
have to be purchased!

703
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,208
Today itself we'll go for shopping!

704
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,500
I'll come with you!

705
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,542
You and me!

706
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,667
I'll go with you!

707
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,542
Ah! Look there's phuchka!

708
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,542
Let's have phuchka!
Please come … come …

709
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:25,750
Let's go …

710
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,792
Come … come …

711
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,792
Too spicy?

712
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,042
Will you have some?

713
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,125
No …

714
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,250
So rigid!

715
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,333
God knows where he has come from …

716
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,333
Have you ever seen him smile?

717
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,083
Never …he never smiles …

718
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:54,625
Give me a dry one …

719
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,917
One without water …

720
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:20,458
After a long time
I enjoyed the day fully …

721
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,958
Having so many phuchkas was
probably not right …

722
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,167
Yes! Probably I had too many …

723
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,042
Feeling a bit heavy …

724
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,292
What has happened to you?

725
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:53,708
Have soiled the bathroom …

726
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,625
My clothes are dirty …
don't touch me …

727
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,792
Dirty means? What's happened?

728
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:01,583
Had to go repeatedly to
the toilet all through the night …

729
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,667
Don't touch me …
I'm unclean all over …

730
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:05,958
My touch won't do any harm …

731
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,375
Get up …

732
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:10,625
I'm holding you … get up …

733
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,750
I've soiled my clothes …

734
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,958
Don't lift me up …
don't … please …

735
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,458
My clothes are all dirty
… couldn't wash them …

736
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,375
I'll do that … I'll do everything …

737
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,667
You go inside …
You get out! Out!

738
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:32,417
It's ok!
Now close the door!

739
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,167
Shall I come?

740
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,792
Yes …

741
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,792
Just hold me …

742
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:53,542
I'll fall down …
you'll not …

743
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:56,792
Nothing will happen …
I'm there for you …

744
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,750
There's nothing left in this body …

745
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:03,333
Everything has gone out like water …

746
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:07,042
This saree has to be taken off...
it's unclean.

747
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,083
I'll do that …

748
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,292
No you go! I'll do it!

749
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:14,708
You just lie down …
I'll do everything …

750
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:17,417
I need to go again …

751
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,042
I'm coming!

752
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,417
I'm there! It will be all right!

753
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,375
You go! Don't close the door!

754
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,500
Shall I come?

755
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,250
Yes … come …

756
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,292
Why are you pouring water? I've
told you I'll wash it all …

757
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,000
Hold me! Hold! Now come …

758
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:55,708
Slowly! Take care!

759
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,292
Nothing will happen!

760
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,250
Now lie down!

761
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:16,167
You take rest!
I'm calling the ambulance!

762
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,500
No no …

763
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,583
They'll take you … I'll
not go to the hospital …

764
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,417
They'll prick needles all over the body …

765
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,833
How painful!

766
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,583
Oh God!

767
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,667
Oh! Can't stand it!

768
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,750
Can't stand it any more!

769
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,125
I've given her the injection …

770
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:23,250
Hope that will bring
the situation under control …

771
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:29,292
Continue the medicines and
the oral ORS after this …

772
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:33,250
But if the condition deteriorates,
she has to be admitted to the hospital …

773
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:40,250
If her the condition improves, give her
boiled food, curd, raw bananas etc.

774
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:42,292
Very severe type of diarrhoea …

775
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,500
Engage a nurse... if possible.
I'm here sir.

776
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:51,375
Lakkhi hasn't come?

777
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,167
No …

778
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,792
How annoying...

779
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,458
Take this …

780
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,792
No... I'll not have anything …
my deity Radha Gobindo is starving …

781
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:11,250
Panditji will be late today …
it's Tuesday …

782
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:14,667
he, usually, comes after 3 pm on
Tuesdays and Saturdays …

783
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:17,417
I called him...
not answering …

784
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:24,375
I have, repeatedly, told him not to
keep my deity starving for so long …

785
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:28,625
I can't eat if my deity starves...

786
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,458
If Jhuma were here,
I would have told her

787
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:33,125
to take bath, sprinkle Ganga
water on the head …

788
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:37,083
rouse Thakur from sleep … and give
sugar pellets and water …

789
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,708
After Panditji comes,
he'll do the regular worship …

790
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,375
Can I do it? …

791
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,750
No … you won't be able to…

792
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,917
I know my religion is different …

793
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:24,542
I don't know whether you'll
accept my touch …

794
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,625
But I'm helpless…

795
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:29,083
If you don't eat,
she … upstairs … will not eat …

796
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:09,875
I do not know the ways
of worshipping you …

797
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,125
Whether you'll have
the food given by me …

798
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,750
Whether you'll accept
the water given by me …

799
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:23,750
I'm doing what my religion
has taught me to do …

800
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:28,375
Pardon me for all my blemishes …

801
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:37,500
Jhuma … all my soiled
clothes are lying there …

802
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,000
No one is there to clean …

803
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,708
and Lakkhi decided not
to come on such a day …

804
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:44,833
All my clothes are unclean …

805
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,250
All your clothes have been washed …

806
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,042
I know it …

807
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:51,708
now you've come … I'm relieved …

808
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,833
Jhuma has not washed your clothes …

809
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,875
it was Tarakda …

810
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,458
he has washed all your clothes …
spread them for drying …

811
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,792
cleaned the house …

812
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:03,000
even cleaned the bathroom …

813
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,375
Take this …

814
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,458
now eat …

815
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,333
Your deity has eaten …

816
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,000
Have it …

817
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:17,833
You'll not move from here …

818
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:19,958
I'll go and visit the doctor …

819
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,083
Just eat it …

820
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:37,458
This Tarak Guha...

821
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:41,083
...the very first day
he entered this house …

822
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:48,375
I admit that I looked
at him with a lot of suspicion …

823
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:53,500
Sajalda … the day
I had diarrhoea …

824
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,000
I was groaning in pain
on the floor of my room …

825
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:58,333
almost unconscious …

826
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:02,667
that boy lifted me up from that state …

827
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:05,167
Sajalda … I'm telling you …

828
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:07,417
...even he...

829
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,792
...he cleaned even
my soiled clothes …

830
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,875
...which my own son never did …

831
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,458
Get out of my house...

832
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:41,292
You are mistaken….
Get out of my house!

833
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,958
I did not want to lie to you

834
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:45,750
I refuse to hear you!
I tried telling you…

835
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,792
I don't want to ever see you again…
get out this minute!

836
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,417
Get out!
What you are thinking is wrong…

837
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,542
Get out of my house!
Get out at once!

838
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:01,458
I had promised to look after you!

839
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,583
Move away!

840
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,917
I had promised Sir,
that I would protect you…

841
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:09,417
Liars and cheaters have no place
in this house…move away!

842
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,958
Listen to me please!
For once, at least!

843
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:31,583
Song of the softest
flower that's you...

844
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,792
Please listen to me…

845
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:37,958
Steam of steamed rice
that's you...

846
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:44,375
You're the silence of sensitivity,

847
01:03:47,292 --> 01:03:51,000
...the candle with crystallized tear.

848
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,750
Song of the softest
flower that's you...

849
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,042
Steam of steamed rice
that's you...

850
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:15,333
You're the silence of sensitivity,

851
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:18,333
You are the candle with
crystallized tear.

852
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:23,333
I live in the shadows of you,
my ma!

853
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,125
What has happened?

854
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:27,708
Do your own job…

855
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:30,208
I live in the eyes of you,
my ma!

856
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:33,042
I don't need to sign?

857
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:39,042
In your tender affection, my ma!

858
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:45,125
I float my call in the blowing
wind... ma!

859
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:52,375
I keep you wrapped in love
...my ma!

860
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,792
Want some more?

861
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,792
Mashima saw you doing the 'namaaz'? I

862
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,833
I had seen it earlier…

863
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,375
I know everything!

864
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:33,292
You are not aware of many things…

865
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,333
I was in jail for 9 years…

866
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,792
I needed a job after getting out …

867
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:44,042
...how do I survive otherwise?
What do I eat?

868
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,167
I want to live properly….

869
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:53,542
Silent corner of a hut
neatly plastered with mud …

870
01:05:53,583 --> 01:06:00,042
Sound of the conch shell
in the twilight hour …

871
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:06,625
Light as dark as the collyrium...

872
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:12,667
A dawn with caring hands
spreading the wrapper …

873
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:23,167
I keep you wrapped in love...
my ma!

874
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:29,250
I live in the shadows of you...
my ma!

875
01:06:29,292 --> 01:06:35,958
I live in the eyes of you...
my ma!

876
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:42,625
In your tender affection...
my ma!

877
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:49,333
I float my note in the blowing wind...
ma!

878
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:58,125
I keep you wrapped in love...
my ma!

879
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:23,042
Hey, you!

880
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:27,750
Move away…
I want to go inside…move!

881
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,250
Untouchable!(vermin)

882
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:32,042
Worn your underwear, I suppose…

883
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:42,292
The last murder that I had committed….

884
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,333
He, too, was
a nasty Brahmin like you…

885
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,375
And, he, too,
never wore underwear…

886
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,542
When I slit his throat…

887
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:55,083
Please…not me!

888
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,375
“Tareq Mia…Tareq Mia”..

889
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,125
...he had screamed;

890
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:06,125
But I refused to relent…
Save me, O lord!

891
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,125
O lord!

892
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:24,708
Hey! What is this carcass doing here?
Come on, move away!

893
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,458
Where are the sweets?

894
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,917
Here it is...

895
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,000
Wait here…

896
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:48,125
Mashima...

897
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:03,875
You really got me worried!

898
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:07,875
I rushed here, the moment,
I heard…

899
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,875
What have you done?
To whom did you offer shelter?

900
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:15,417
I tell my boys,
look at this courageous lady….

901
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:22,208
But don't you worry!
This time I will give you a 'clean' guy,

902
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:25,833
having all necessary identity cards.

903
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,208
I'll be back
Okay...

904
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,250
Son of a Bhrahmin!

905
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:38,917
You should have informed us…
what are we here for!

906
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:44,792
Have some… Your safety
is our resposibility.

907
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,500
Do sit down…

908
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:53,167
While climbing up,
saw plaster peeling off your walls….

909
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,000
Not at all!

910
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
My house is in perfect condition!

911
01:09:57,042 --> 01:10:00,750
All homes have such problems…
it's nothing!

912
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,583
You aren't interested in selling
the house, are you?

913
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:08,458
How do you profit by
'promoting' my house?

914
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,500
My profit!
Think of your profits…

915
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:16,292
you needn't even keep a guard…

916
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:20,125
Let me do the 'promoting' and
you will get to stay on the top floor!

917
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:25,375
A dupleix…You on the top
and everyone below you!

918
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:27,208
Give your house for 'promoting'...

919
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,792
then, you can fix the money
that you will receive, in a bank

920
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,250
and the rest of your life
you will be secured.

921
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:36,833
Mashima…

922
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:44,875
After 'chop', 'promoting' is the only
other legal business in West Bengal!

923
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:53,250
So Bapi, weren't
you Putu's tenants?

924
01:10:54,333 --> 01:11:00,000
Tenants? No..no we are the owners…
landlords, you can say…

925
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,042
We were tenants once…

926
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:09,167
...but; once Potu died, we took over
and converted the property into apartments.

927
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,667
Heard of the Rahmania shop?

928
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:15,708
Sells biryani…
they rented the place from us….

929
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,417
Have you had Rahmania's biryani?

930
01:11:18,417 --> 01:11:25,000
Simply great…only they can make
such stuff… impossible for us!

931
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:32,625
That means, you did not pay rent for
the house you occupied, did you?

932
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:39,792
Illegally occupied the house, then brokered
it legally and built apartments to sell.

933
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:41,125
How clever!

934
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:45,875
You've never visited your
own terrace, have you?

935
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:51,375
Where you can see clouds,
or get wet in the rains…?

936
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:57,000
What are you saying, mashima!
Feeling romantic all of a sudden!

937
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:03,917
Reminds me of Kajol in
“Dilwale Dulhaniya”…

938
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,917
Big house….
large bathrooms…

939
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:11,750
your own water reservoir…
to draw as much water as you desire….

940
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,667
Never experienced it, have you?

941
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:16,500
So….

942
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:17,500
Useless….

943
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,125
….Useless trying... Bapi!

944
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:27,250
I will never let you do
the 'promoting' of my house!

945
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,583
Then..

946
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,542
I will take your leave!

947
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:54,583
My contract with you has ended!

948
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,417
No one will ever touch you…neither the
jail authorities nor 'Vulture' Bapi,

949
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,125
what will you do, now?

950
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:02,792
Get rid of him!

951
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:07,500
I was crazy to have depended on him!

952
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,042
Get rid of him! Come on….

953
01:13:11,042 --> 01:13:15,958
(A popular Hindi film dialogue):
Eat, scratch, put off the light…and go to sleep!

954
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:22,333
What?!!

955
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,875
40%...

956
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,458
...is my deal….

957
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,750
United Constructions….

958
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,667
Rajeev Dalmia…

959
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:40,167
…met at a hotel at Rajarhat

960
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:43,083
Rajeev's partner Amir Hussein…

961
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:45,333
…lives in Dubai,

962
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,750
made a video call..

963
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:50,458
Amir wants to start a shopping
mall in Kolkata

964
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,500
And start a real estate business…..

965
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:59,333
153,152, 151, 151B,
all houses settled...

966
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:03,708
The problem lies
only with 157/C...

967
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,167
You get 2% of the total deal…

968
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,208
where you will also supply
all the construction materials.

969
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,042
Have also spoken to Bhaiyada….

970
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,458
….Do you require any more details?

971
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,375
40% is my deal!

972
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:30,500
You have time till tonight or else
I'll offer them 1% and take the deal.

973
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,000
And don't try to scare me….

974
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,792
Ask your cronies to
deal with pennies….

975
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,000
...not important ones!

976
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:06,083
It's been three days since
Tarakda has been driven out…

977
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:10,417
Can Jhuma call Tarakda in?

978
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,500
Do your own job!

979
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:36,333
I had asked you to leave…

980
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,083
Why are you still here?
What are you trying to prove?

981
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:45,833
The responsibility of this house and
your well being was given to me….

982
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,667
I cannot shirk my responsibilities!

983
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,625
You have no responsibilities
towards me…

984
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:53,000
I have driven you away
you are free!

985
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,250
Mr Anirban felt that...

986
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:58,667
as I am a Muslim, you will refuse
to keep me in this house!

987
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:03,000
So when you wanted to know my
surname, he said 'Guha'…

988
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,417
Everyone fears you…

989
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,417
...thus everybody hid the truth from you!

990
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,333
People know so little of me!

991
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:14,000
Did I drive you away
because you are a muslim?

992
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:21,417
One takes birth
without caste or religion…

993
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,083
...only with humanity.

994
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:31,917
In my eyes both
you and the priest are equal

995
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:35,583
I drove you out of this house
because you had lied to me,

996
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,667
you had cheated me..

997
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:40,000
Another truth has
been hidden from you…

998
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,667
More secrets?!

999
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:45,625
I am an ex-convict…

1000
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,708
...jailed for 9 years!

1001
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:51,292
Did you commit murder?

1002
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,708
No…

1003
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:56,542
…but two murder cases
are still pending…

1004
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,250
Ever disrespected women?

1005
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,792
In jail, rapists...

1006
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,500
...were never considered as men!

1007
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,542
Your past is of
no importance to me…

1008
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:10,708
your bad deeds,
will get you your due punishments.

1009
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,542
And good deeds...

1010
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,083
will get you respect and praise…

1011
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:21,500
Now stop fussing and come inside!

1012
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:26,000
I don't like conversing with you
outside at this time of the night...

1013
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,667
And you stink!

1014
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,542
I promise never ever to lie to you!

1015
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:37,125
You are... only
'Tarak' to me…

1016
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:39,375
Ali' or 'Guha'
does not matter to me!

1017
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,917
Come in!

1018
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,833
Do you jump over the gates
to go to the bathroom at night?

1019
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,333
What can I do if I need to go?
I don't have the keys!

1020
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,000
Take the keys...

1021
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,750
...or else you will break
your limbs, someday!

1022
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,250
Come inside!

1023
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:21,625
'While writing exams, a student
does a 'live' on Facebook…'

1024
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:22,875
Loudly...

1025
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:30,042
...amidst other students giving exams...
she was 'live' on Facebook.

1026
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:34,042
“Watching facebook live…while
others watched her watching.. ”

1027
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:39,750
“Watching…watched…watching….”
Read properly!

1028
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:49,542
“Only after a complaint,
the authorities swung into action…

1029
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,583
Read the next…

1030
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:55,833
This is what remains to be seen!
Mobiles are extremely destructive!

1031
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,250
“A couple murdered at Salt lake...

1032
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:02,500
…An elderly couple were
murdered in their own home…

1033
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:08,333
The murder took place on Sunday…
the main suspect is the caretaker of the house.

1034
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:13,042
The caretaker has been
missing since the incident…

1035
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,000
What happened?

1036
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,667
Everyone is not the same
Tarak…

1037
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,708
keep reading…

1038
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:31,208
The bodies were discovered
in the couple's bedroom….

1039
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,333
They were strangled to death…

1040
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,750
Then their throats were slit open….

1041
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,458
Goodness! What language!
What rubbish they write!

1042
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:45,083
Hail the Lord….

1043
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:57,958
Sir, ADG Vinod in Uttar Pradesh has started
giving an incentive to preserve moustaches

1044
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,167
During the British rule, Rs.50 was given
every month for moustache care.

1045
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:09,708
Previously, cops coming to Kolkata from
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar also kept moustaches.

1046
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:15,042
Do you know that how much is
required to transplant a moustache?

1047
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,750
How much?

1048
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:19,000
Rs.40 to 50,000/-

1049
01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:22,292
What do you say!
Can I come in, Sir?

1050
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,417
Moustache transplant!

1051
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:28,958
Came to give my attendance, Sir…

1052
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:47,917
Have you heard of
Bibhuti Bhusan Bandhopadhayay?

1053
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,333
Have you heard of
"one-armed Gopal"?

1054
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:55,417
"One-armed Gopal"!
Who is he?

1055
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:58,500
"Bibhuti Bhusan Bandhopadhayay" …
who is he?

1056
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:03,000
He is an immortal writer
of Bengali literature

1057
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,542
...and who is one-armed Gopal?

1058
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,875
One-armed Gopal
is a famous criminal…

1059
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:14,333
his name will exist as long as
crime in Bengal exists

1060
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:19,417
Oh Lord! You equate Bibhuti Bhusan
Bandhopadhayay and one-armed Gopal?

1061
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,625
I did not equate them…

1062
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:26,542
I am felling unwell….if I teach you
any longer, I'll suffer a stroke…

1063
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:29,750
I need to call Ani…
go..go at once!

1064
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,125
So…we end it here!

1065
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,708
Go!

1066
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:57,667
Among all the characters in the Mahabharata,
Karna becomes his favourite character…

1067
01:21:57,708 --> 01:22:02,917
Therefore, he develops an
affection for Karna.

1068
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:11,792
Listening to his mother's narration,
young Apu's heart is filed with sadness

1069
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:14,708
Unable to control his tears….

1070
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,042
Feeling sad?

1071
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:21,333
For whom? Karna?

1072
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,625
For my mother….

1073
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:39,958
Jai Jai Gobindo

1074
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:45,000
Sing the glory of
Gobindo Gopal Gadadhar!

1075
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:52,083
Krishnachandra!
Have mercy on us!

1076
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,667
You are the sea of kindness!

1077
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:03,000
Glory be of Radhe Gobindo...

1078
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:09,125
Gopal Banamali!

1079
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:20,000
Mukunda Murari!
You are the soulmate of Sri Radha!

1080
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:31,958
Without chanting
the names of Hare Gobindo

1081
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:39,917
Human life gets wasted day by day …

1082
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:59,708
Dearest Balaram gave
the name of Hare Krishna...

1083
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,917
Disciple Sridam called
him the king of cowherds...

1084
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:16,750
Mother Jashoda said, Listen,
my son...

1085
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:24,833
Thus Lord Narayan
adopted 108 names!

1086
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:07,042
Sri Nanda called him
the son of Nanda...

1087
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:15,500
Brindaban's king took
the name... the light of Brindaban.

1088
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:28,333
All the poor calls him
the fountain of kindness...

1089
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:35,458
Thus Lord Narayan adopted 108 names...!

1090
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:57,583
Bashishtha calls him
the captivating jewel...

1091
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:06,333
Biswamitra calls him
the essence of the universe

1092
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:10,667
Milkmaids call him butter thief...

1093
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:18,375
Why did you get up, brother?
Anything wrong?

1094
01:26:20,292 --> 01:26:22,792
What has happened, Bapi?

1095
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:24,750
You won't eat? Why did
you get up? Won't you have prasad?

1096
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,458
This is blasphemy!

1097
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:34,500
Whatever is happening here
is not right!

1098
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:39,375
Immoral! Do you understand?

1099
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,333
What is immoral here? Bapi?

1100
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:47,250
All these days, you were committing
immoral deeds in your house,

1101
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:49,792
now, you are doing it in
front of everyone!

1102
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,417
This is not right, Mashima...

1103
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,083
Since childhood I come every year,
to have the Lord's food on Janmashtami…

1104
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:01,708
And today, the 'prasad' is
being served by a muslim!

1105
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:09,458
'Prasad' will be served by a muslim!

1106
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:16,875
Have you ever heard of the Lord's food
being served by a muslim on Janmashtami?

1107
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:23,542
Have you heard of Hindus and Muslims
celebrating Janmashtami together?

1108
01:27:24,292 --> 01:27:27,500
Religion will never support this….
don't play around with religion!

1109
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,958
Everything will be burned down…

1110
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,375
I will burn everything down!
A muslim serving 'prasad'!

1111
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,417
No one should touch the 'prasad'...

1112
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:42,917
I am commanding you …
no one should eat the 'prasad'...

1113
01:27:42,917 --> 01:27:44,833
None of you will leave!

1114
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,292
Don't you dare get up!

1115
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:55,542
Bapi…the religion that embraces
you starts from your home, itself…

1116
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:02,375
I don't know if you have heard;
but I have…

1117
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:07,083
At Chirawah, which is near Jaipur,
at Narahar dargah,

1118
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,750
Janmashtami is celebrated
since 400 years.

1119
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:18,292
Hindus, muslims get together
to celebrate this festival.

1120
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:22,708
On Janmashtami, qawalis are sung….

1121
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:28,167
Hindu mothers offer 'chuddar'
at this same dargah,

1122
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:34,083
...praying for their sons who
battle at the borders.

1123
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:36,250
There's more…

1124
01:28:36,292 --> 01:28:45,167
In Khirowa at Agra…on Janmashtami, muslim
children roam around dressed as little Krishna.

1125
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:53,500
Krishna, to them, is not just a God;
but their playmate, the god of love!

1126
01:28:56,292 --> 01:29:02,833
Bapi, do you know that the creators
of those metal gods and

1127
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:07,667
goddesses that you worship?

1128
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,625
You haven't, have you?

1129
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,208
Let me tell you…

1130
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:23,083
At Aligarh, hindu and muslim artisans,
together create the metal gods.

1131
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:29,792
Before praying, have you ever questioned,
who created those statues?

1132
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:33,542
Then why question now…
who will serve the 'prasad'?

1133
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
But, of course, you cannot do without
the biryani made at Rahmaniya!

1134
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,125
What a devotee of Krishna!

1135
01:29:43,167 --> 01:29:49,583
Truly, Krishna is in a fix,
where his devotees are concerned!

1136
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:56,625
Especially those who cannot do without
biryani from Shiraz, Rahmaniya or Arsalan!

1137
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:05,542
Bapi…that biryani has to be cooked
solely by muslims only! Isn't it so?

1138
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:12,458
Tarak…serve 'prasad' to everyone…

1139
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
...eat to your heart's content!

1140
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,625
Please eat.

1141
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,292
Bapi…

1142
01:30:19,292 --> 01:30:23,500
…don't try and destroy this
harmonious atmosphere…

1143
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:27,958
Everyone equally deserves
the lord's food.

1144
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:31,333
Please sit down and eat…

1145
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:36,333
Start the devotional song….

1146
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,708
Come Jhuma,

1147
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,208
Begin…begin….

1148
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,250
Why have you stopped?

1149
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:45,542
Eat...!

1150
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:51,417
Chant names, think names,
make names the essence of life

1151
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:54,500
Grace of Krishna's names is never ending...

1152
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,750
Names and Krishna are the same,
chant them with devotion

1153
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:12,792
You'll find your
Sri Hari with the names...

1154
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:20,625
Listen, my brothers, to
the holy chanting of the names

1155
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:24,083
Listening to the names absolves
you of all your sins...

1156
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:27,917
Chanting Krishna and Hari
gives you the ultimate pleasure

1157
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:34,750
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare

1158
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:38,375
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare

1159
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,792
On the blue horizon….

1160
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:06,542
No…do it this way….
like this…

1161
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,625
She's looking great…

1162
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:10,833
Hey! Careful…
she's your sister-in-law!

1163
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:14,708
I'm not talking about my sis-in-law!
Seen her grace?

1164
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,958
During springtime….

1165
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:20,708
She will do this alone…

1166
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:24,000
I love her too much….

1167
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,458
But she doesn't care about you!
She will….she will….

1168
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:35,000
That's it…you can go now;
but careful keep away from the sun!

1169
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:36,333
You have a show in front of you….

1170
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,833
Has she said anything
about our costumes?

1171
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,250
It has to be a sari….

1172
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:47,333
Trying to 'ping' you since three days….
You are not replying.

1173
01:32:49,417 --> 01:32:52,958
Do your fingers ache to
reply to my messages?

1174
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:59,000
Why aren't you replying?
Trying to ignore me?

1175
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:01,500
She's trying to ignore me!

1176
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:06,583
Be sure of one thing… wherever you
go….I will be following you!

1177
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:10,583
Everything about you is tied
to me…remember that!

1178
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,667
Does Jhuma reply to your Whatsapp
messages? She does not!

1179
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:18,625
If you message her, does
she reply….she does not!

1180
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,917
If you call her, does Jhuma
respond…she does not!

1181
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:26,167
Why are you so stupid? Don't you realise that
Jhuma is not interested in a stupid boy like you?

1182
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:28,125
Stupid Bijon!

1183
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:31,500
Why are you upset?
After all I'll be marrying you!

1184
01:33:31,542 --> 01:33:34,000
Have you seen your
face in the mirror?

1185
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,542
I'll slap you hard!

1186
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:39,083
Jhuma already has a boyfriend!

1187
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:43,917
Hey! She bit me!

1188
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:45,542
Tell me his name…

1189
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:51,625
Just tell me his name…Wherever he is, I'll pick
him up and make mincemeat out of him

1190
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:53,500
at Hussein's meatshop!
Just tell me his name!

1191
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,875
I don't have to tell you his name…

1192
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,583
He will come to fetch
Jhuma from the college…

1193
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,167
If you want to make mincemeat
out of him…you can do it then!

1194
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,542
Come…let's go!

1195
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:08,708
Keep cool…
we'll take care of him….

1196
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,042
Let's go…..

1197
01:34:14,042 --> 01:34:16,083
My father-in-law's ancestral property!

1198
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,167
Do you know how old it is?

1199
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,708
Nearly 100 years old!

1200
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,667
Where did you learn masonry?

1201
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:33,000
9 years in prison teaches
you everything!

1202
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,750
I got lucky…

1203
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,125
...no longer lack for anything!

1204
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:43,042
Electrician, carpenter, mason,
gardener…all rolled into one…

1205
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:50,417
Jhuma…wait here,
have to attend to the phone call

1206
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:06,917
Will you accompany Jhuma
to her college?

1207
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:08,708
I don't have the time!

1208
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,917
A rogue in college is troubling Jhuma!

1209
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,333
Harrassing Jhuma!

1210
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,750
Let Jhuma settle the matter herself….

1211
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,167
Jhuma is unable to…

1212
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,167
So…what should I do?

1213
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:20,625
You can scare him…

1214
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:21,958
You go and do it!

1215
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,333
In fact, Jhuma has told him…

1216
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,542
” Have you seen your
face in the mirror?”

1217
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:28,958
Jhuma has told him that
he is worth nothing!

1218
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:33,167
Jhuma has told him that Jhuma is
crazy about someone!

1219
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:36,792
Jhuma is in love with him...

1220
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,750
He is Jhuma's boyfriend!

1221
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:47,542
Jhuma has already revealed it
all…now what will she do?

1222
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,917
Who is your boyfriend?

1223
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:13,750
Oh my goodness!
A leech…always following me!

1224
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:16,500
Have to convey the news
to the right person!

1225
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,958
I'll see to it….

1226
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:38,542
Mashima...

1227
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,000
Gently…gently…
why are you hyperventilating?

1228
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Koochu..koochu…

1229
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,708
Jhuma is calling Tarak her boyfriend!

1230
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,458
Hail the lord! How disgraceful!

1231
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,375
You are amused, Mashima?

1232
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,375
Here….

1233
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:14,042
Sit down….

1234
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:20,042
He is an ex-convict, sister….

1235
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:24,083
How can I give him my daughter?
What will people say?

1236
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,500
My relatives?
Especially my in-laws?

1237
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,875
Which in-laws are you
talking about Shyamoli?

1238
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,875
Which relatives?

1239
01:37:36,042 --> 01:37:38,750
I did not see any of them
after your husband departed!

1240
01:37:40,542 --> 01:37:46,042
When you were thrown out on the
streets….who gave you shelter?

1241
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:53,125
Those who shut the door on your face
…are you referring to them?

1242
01:37:56,792 --> 01:38:03,000
Shyamoli…at least you are aware that your
son-in-law is an ex-convict….

1243
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:06,333
You are aware of his crime…

1244
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,292
And the criminals surrounding you…

1245
01:38:09,292 --> 01:38:12,750
Those who made indecent propositions
after your husband's death….

1246
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:25,750
Tarak will lovingly
take care for Jhuma…

1247
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,083
I understand people…

1248
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,583
Some dreams some clouds Some
books with a layer of dust...

1249
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:54,625
Some wishes coming true
This sleepless night of spring...

1250
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:07,958
Turning side in my mind
On this day of the poetry of palash

1251
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:12,667
While dancing and plucking flowers
My mind will think only of you...

1252
01:39:12,708 --> 01:39:17,292
Today the heedless wind
Roused by a flock of evening birds

1253
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:21,583
Let this evening and
'belphool' stay in my heart...

1254
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:31,583
The blue horizon has caught fire
with the colors of the flowers.

1255
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:40,125
In this spring... the flame
of fragrance is ablaze!

1256
01:40:12,792 --> 01:40:17,292
In the horizon
burns a composition of fire...

1257
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:22,125
Scorches the inconsolable spring...

1258
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,750
It causes trepidation...

1259
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,875
Lest the mind goes erratic...

1260
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:40,542
When the leaves start to fall.

1261
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:44,917
Today the heedless wind
roused by a flock of evening birds

1262
01:40:44,917 --> 01:40:49,125
Let this evening and
'belphool' stay in my heart...

1263
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:14,875
Some dreams some clouds
the eyes meet for a moment...

1264
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:19,625
Some wishes respond in the corners
of the mind – it's true...

1265
01:41:19,667 --> 01:41:24,167
What method what
sight good or bad...

1266
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:28,417
What rhythm and waves
splash breakers it's true.

1267
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:00,458
Today is a special day….

1268
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:07,042
I conveyed my proposal regarding
Tareq and Jhuma to Shyamoli...

1269
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:22,167
Wait here…

1270
01:42:22,167 --> 01:42:24,250
Remember... today
you are 'Kabir Singh'...

1271
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:26,292
Don't get nervous...

1272
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,292
The person I had told you
about…mine...

1273
01:42:34,625 --> 01:42:37,417
Whom you were considering
making mincemeat of...

1274
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:42,875
Careful brother….

1275
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,542
Tareq Ali...

1276
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:00,417
Bijoooo………

1277
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:06,458
What... what have you done?

1278
01:43:07,167 --> 01:43:08,625
Hey, let's run….

1279
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:12,625
This is called 'internal blow'...
Can't be seen externally…

1280
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:17,042
The finger bone has been dislocated…

1281
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:20,583
Will have to be X-rayed…

1282
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:23,292
Will take time to cure…

1283
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:26,917
Hey, what happened?

1284
01:43:30,292 --> 01:43:34,417
Never again tease girls
from this college…

1285
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,792
They are all my sisters!
Sisters... all of them sisters…

1286
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:50,458
What has happened?

1287
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
What happened to your hand?
Everyone is my sister!

1288
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,417
Ani had called…

1289
01:44:41,792 --> 01:44:45,917
Perhaps, he won't be
coming this time…

1290
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:53,958
Leaving Houston for San Fransisco…

1291
01:44:56,792 --> 01:45:00,750
Ani has a new job in a new company…

1292
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:06,750
For the next two years,
he won't be able to come…

1293
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:08,792
except for emergencies……

1294
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,667
Won't get permission to come…

1295
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:16,167
What emergency!

1296
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:20,750
If I depart..he will have to come…

1297
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,500
to complete the last rites…

1298
01:45:28,542 --> 01:45:31,375
Painted the house with such hopes…

1299
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,708
Changed everything in the house…

1300
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:38,125
Hoping for my grandchild
to see his house…

1301
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:45,542
Ani had promised to take
us on a holiday this time…

1302
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,667
It's years since I have been on
a holiday anywhere!

1303
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:57,375
Can I address you as 'mother'?

1304
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:07,958
Then now, you have two sons…

1305
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:12,083
One of them is
busy with his work...

1306
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:15,083
and your other son….

1307
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:19,333
Would you like to visit Balasore….
my village there…?

1308
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:22,958
From there,
we will go to Dhabalgiri…

1309
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:24,958
To see the Shantistupa…

1310
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:31,000
Will also take Jhuma along…

1311
01:47:22,292 --> 01:47:25,000
28th... 29th... 30th….
only 3 days remaining…..

1312
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,708
Your time starts now!

1313
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,125
Hey...

1314
01:47:39,125 --> 01:47:42,042
...what kind of a car is this?
No music!

1315
01:47:42,042 --> 01:47:45,292
Here, you will only hear Odiya songs
on an Odiya radio station.

1316
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:47,500
That's okay... will hear Odiya songs.

1317
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:10,458
Give it to me…

1318
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:14,292
Take some Chena jhili…

1319
01:48:14,333 --> 01:48:17,000
Aah... it's hot!

1320
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:21,250
Is it good?

1321
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:23,042
Awesome! Awesome to eat!

1322
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:24,583
Superb!

1323
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:28,292
Mashima... what is this 'Chena Jhili'?

1324
01:48:28,292 --> 01:48:33,125
Cottage cheese balls,
dipped in sugar syrup…

1325
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:35,792
Is this a popular sweet here?

1326
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:36,792
Hmm…

1327
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:40,000
Aha..ha…

1328
01:48:50,833 --> 01:48:51,833
My village…

1329
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:56,000
See these drawings here? Artistes from
the Pipli village have drawn them…

1330
01:48:57,417 --> 01:48:59,750
Look there….
Go... go…

1331
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,542
Ma...

1332
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:11,875
This is my house... we used to all live here
together... now it is a school…

1333
01:49:15,417 --> 01:49:16,792
My house….

1334
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:23,750
Wait... wait …

1335
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:51,833
What ...??

1336
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,750
What is it?

1337
01:50:02,958 --> 01:50:05,042
Ma…

1338
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:08,417
Marbles…

1339
01:50:08,417 --> 01:50:10,125
Kept it there...
in my childhood!

1340
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:11,542
Let me see…
No…

1341
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:14,500
Childhood...?
Let me see…

1342
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,958
Made of stone…

1343
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:19,417
Stone!! Hmm…

1344
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:22,417
Keep it in your pocket... Ma…

1345
01:50:22,458 --> 01:50:24,625
Let's go... I will take you
to a wonderful place…

1346
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:45,167
You know Ma... this is
Kaipada's Pir Bukhari' s mazaar..

1347
01:50:45,792 --> 01:50:49,250
Here Hindus and Muslims jointly
celebrate all festivals together…

1348
01:50:49,292 --> 01:50:54,083
And the 'prasad' here is made by
a Hindu only... this is the ritual here…

1349
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:56,333
With these eyes blinded by light

1350
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,208
My search for you continues …

1351
01:50:58,208 --> 01:51:03,000
I'll find you for sure
I promise by the name of God …

1352
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:22,375
With my head down I walk
Thorns stuck all over my body...

1353
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:26,375
I'll find you for sure
I promise by the name of God …

1354
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:30,750
Show me the way my Nabi
My mind river flows without destination

1355
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:34,250
In which quay shall I find my destination …

1356
01:51:42,542 --> 01:51:47,167
Murshid, tell me for once

1357
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:50,458
The address which
I've been searching relentlessly …

1358
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:54,833
Murshid, tell me for once

1359
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,417
which address will reveal my home!

1360
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:18,458
It was here in Dhabalgiri that the
Kalinga war had taken place…

1361
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:23,833
That war had transformed
Emperor Ashoka into a sage….

1362
01:52:25,917 --> 01:52:28,375
Lakhs of people had died…

1363
01:52:28,417 --> 01:52:31,458
Dayanadi was transformed
into a river of blood..

1364
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:36,292
Witnessing all this, Emperor Ashoka...
embraced the religion of non-violence

1365
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:39,083
for the rest of his 40 years…

1366
01:52:41,167 --> 01:52:45,167
Let go off violence...
let go off bloodshed…

1367
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:47,333
let go off revenge…

1368
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:51,250
embrace only peace...

1369
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:54,125
and forgiveness…

1370
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:05,792
That is why we have
the 'Shantistupa' here…

1371
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:12,750
The Japanese Buddhist society
created this here…

1372
01:53:13,542 --> 01:53:15,542
Shantistupa…

1373
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:24,500
You both go ahead and see it…

1374
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:29,125
Too many steps for me to climb...
you both go ahead and see it... go!

1375
01:53:48,583 --> 01:53:50,958
Jhuma is tired...

1376
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,583
Jhuma's feet are aching…

1377
01:53:53,625 --> 01:53:54,917
So...?

1378
01:53:56,083 --> 01:53:56,917
"So...?"

1379
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:00,167
Haven't you watched 'Chennai Express'?

1380
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:05,375
And Sharukh picking up Deepika in his arms…

1381
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:09,875
What??

1382
01:54:09,875 --> 01:54:11,750
What are you staring at?

1383
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:14,083
There were so many steps there …

1384
01:54:15,458 --> 01:54:17,667
Then they get married...

1385
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:22,917
Will you marry Jhuma?

1386
01:54:24,167 --> 01:54:26,542
I'll throw you down the stairs…

1387
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:29,583
What a monster!

1388
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:41,708
Where will you live?

1389
01:54:47,167 --> 01:54:50,042
Where will you live?
I don't have a place to stay…

1390
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:53,542
Why…in your village, of course!

1391
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:55,792
You will work at the stone quarry….

1392
01:54:55,792 --> 01:54:58,125
And Jhuma will open
a Dance school…

1393
01:54:58,167 --> 01:54:59,750
Hmm?

1394
01:55:04,542 --> 01:55:06,375
Jhuma is very dissatisfied…

1395
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:11,958
Here, no one is taking Jhuma to the beach
or buying shells and Sambalpuri Jewelry for her ..

1396
01:55:11,958 --> 01:55:14,875
Jhuma is very offended...

1397
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:17,292
Hmm…. 'Rangaboti'!

1398
01:55:34,542 --> 01:55:39,958
Rangabati...

1399
01:55:39,958 --> 01:55:48,375
You coloured my heart
Your words sink and float there...

1400
01:55:48,417 --> 01:55:52,667
I'm so abashed to tell...

1401
01:55:58,292 --> 01:56:06,292
My heart doesn't hesitate to be
with you, my love!

1402
01:56:06,292 --> 01:56:11,708
Prabhu Dutta Pradhan set tune to
the words of Mitra Bhanu Bantiyar.

1403
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:14,792
Such a lovely song of ours …

1404
01:56:14,792 --> 01:56:19,500
Would you like me to sing
this song in your language?

1405
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:44,125
Rangabati you coloured my heart
Your words sink and float there...

1406
01:56:50,125 --> 01:56:53,250
I'm so abashed to tell...

1407
01:56:57,667 --> 01:57:02,708
My heart doesn't hesitate to be
with you, my love!

1408
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:12,667
You live in my dreams...

1409
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:19,125
Your beauty kills and enlivens me...
Your words sink and float there!

1410
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:42,083
Your nose-drop and bangle
the bird of my mind my life...

1411
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:45,250
goes about flying in the dust …

1412
01:57:54,833 --> 01:57:57,958
No words on his lips...

1413
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:10,042
Only gestures and signs... created by
your beautiful eyes sitting in the mustard field...

1414
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:19,792
My heart burns
sinking in the fire of love...

1415
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:26,042
The cuckoo inside me coos...

1416
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:24,458
Tata…

1417
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,750
Taken everything?
Taken your jewellery?

1418
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:29,042
Here it is...

1419
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:30,292
Drive carefully…

1420
01:59:30,333 --> 01:59:32,125
Tata…

1421
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,292
Come on…

1422
01:59:50,292 --> 01:59:53,792
I lost my first baby, you know…

1423
01:59:53,792 --> 01:59:56,750
Died prematurely…

1424
01:59:59,583 --> 02:00:03,042
Then when I conceived again…

1425
02:00:03,042 --> 02:00:07,000
I told my doctor...
I want a son..that's it!

1426
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,375
It was my ardent wish…

1427
02:00:09,417 --> 02:00:11,708
Then I gave birth to Ani…

1428
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:16,208
...a beautiful baby...
My son... my own son…

1429
02:00:17,417 --> 02:00:21,667
Then when Ani grew up, I realised
it was time to let him go…

1430
02:00:21,708 --> 02:00:25,000
He wouldn't stay...
he wanted to leave..

1431
02:00:26,542 --> 02:00:29,375
It was extremely painful...

1432
02:00:29,375 --> 02:00:33,917
the day he left Kolkata...
my heart broke…

1433
02:00:33,917 --> 02:00:37,208
Couldn't come to terms….

1434
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:41,083
Can I say something?

1435
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,125
What is it?

1436
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,625
I know why you drove
out your caretakers…

1437
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:49,667
Why?

1438
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,750
So that Anirban returns to you
as quickly as possible…

1439
02:00:54,750 --> 02:01:01,250
Every time you dismissed your caretakers...
Anirban quickly returned to you..

1440
02:01:01,292 --> 02:01:03,125
Oh... you mischievous brat!

1441
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,542
How did you guess?

1442
02:01:08,417 --> 02:01:12,125
True... I deliberately
drove them away….

1443
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:17,250
" Go... get out!".
But my son was fully aware…

1444
02:01:17,292 --> 02:01:21,167
He refused to keep me alone...
so he rushed back home…

1445
02:01:22,292 --> 02:01:24,292
But now I have another son…

1446
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:27,792
One who doesn't let me carry my bags..

1447
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:31,875
Arranges my food
and medicines for me ..

1448
02:01:34,333 --> 02:01:42,500
Never dreamt that at the end of my days...
the Lord would gift me another son!

1449
02:01:42,542 --> 02:01:46,042
Ma... you go upstairs... I will
lock the door and join you…

1450
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,000
Ma…..ma…

1451
02:02:34,042 --> 02:02:36,708
Come on….
turn the car around…

1452
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:02,833
Fast... fast... fast...

1453
02:03:03,375 --> 02:03:04,833
This side...

1454
02:03:04,833 --> 02:03:06,875
Get the OT ready immediately…

1455
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,208
Well... excuse me….

1456
02:03:14,208 --> 02:03:18,583
The operation has been successful...
but cannot say anything before 48 hours.

1457
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:22,208
She has suffered a massive head injury…
and some internal bleeding too..

1458
02:03:25,083 --> 02:03:26,458
Mukti's pressure was normal...

1459
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:29,875
What caused her to fall?

1460
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:33,292
I don't think it was an accident…

1461
02:03:51,583 --> 02:03:53,542
Drive quickly …

1462
02:04:07,958 --> 02:04:09,708
Bapi...

1463
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:13,292
Who has hurt my mother?
You?

1464
02:04:13,292 --> 02:04:15,292
Leave... let be…

1465
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:35,833
Let go off violence...
let go off bloodshed…

1466
02:04:35,875 --> 02:04:37,583
let go off revenge…

1467
02:04:38,917 --> 02:04:40,292
Hold him...

1468
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:43,875
embrace only peace...
and forgiveness…

1469
02:04:43,875 --> 02:04:47,458
Tareq Ali... you are under arrest!
Charges... attempt to murder Muktidevi…

1470
02:04:52,458 --> 02:04:53,792
Bring him along…

1471
02:05:21,667 --> 02:05:23,750
How is my mother?

1472
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,667
Come this side...
I will tell you everything…

1473
02:05:25,708 --> 02:05:27,542
Anyone from Muktidevi' s family?

1474
02:05:27,542 --> 02:05:29,708
I…
Come with me.. only one of you…

1475
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,917
Let me see... Yes…

1476
02:05:39,958 --> 02:05:43,958
Swamiji used to say,
"Indians... do not forget..

1477
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,375
low caste people, the illiterate,
the poor... the ignorant...

1478
02:05:48,417 --> 02:05:52,958
the shoemaker... the sweeper...
are your blood brothers.."

1479
02:05:52,958 --> 02:05:57,958
We, only, mouthed these words...
but never followed them…

1480
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,500
Tarak... will come.

1481
02:06:00,542 --> 02:06:06,958
Separate bathrooms for our domestic help… We will
dine at the tables... they... on the floors.

1482
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:11,750
This has been the practice all
along… I, too, followed the same..

1483
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:20,000
Tarak... no... Tareq Ali
made me see religion in a new light…

1484
02:06:20,958 --> 02:06:28,250
If Tarak can address me as his mother…
Why can't I accept him as my own?

1485
02:06:28,292 --> 02:06:33,667
In this Govind dham...
Tareq Ali is my child…

1486
02:06:33,708 --> 02:06:38,917
He may not be my heir...
but he is dear to me..

1487
02:06:47,417 --> 02:06:50,292
Ani…

1488
02:06:52,542 --> 02:06:54,167
Tell me, ma..

1489
02:07:06,708 --> 02:07:09,083
Does she still have fever?

1490
02:07:14,708 --> 02:07:16,625
What is it?

1491
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:22,542
Tarak….

1492
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:26,750
Any news of him?

1493
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,625
I will get him back, ma…

1494
02:07:34,833 --> 02:07:36,167
Ritam...

1495
02:07:38,333 --> 02:07:39,375
I want you to release Tarak.

1496
02:07:41,417 --> 02:07:44,500
Tareq was released two days
after his arrest…

1497
02:07:44,542 --> 02:07:45,542
What?

1498
02:07:45,542 --> 02:07:46,125
Yes...

1499
02:07:47,333 --> 02:07:52,083
After being employed at your place,
Bapi started keeping an eye upon Tareq…

1500
02:07:52,083 --> 02:07:56,583
A big syndicate
was behind all this...

1501
02:07:56,625 --> 02:08:00,500
Tareq reveals
the entire plan to us…

1502
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:04,708
The day he left for Balasore with mashima
They sent him a little note saying,

1503
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:07,458
Some incident will take place
around 30th Sept.

1504
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:10,583
Tareq had guessed quite early...

1505
02:08:12,208 --> 02:08:15,458
Therefore, before 30th of September,
Tareq left the city with mashima…

1506
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:20,125
But, unfortunately, the whole incident took
place after their return from Odisha..

1507
02:08:20,125 --> 02:08:26,667
A very thin aluminum wire
was tied to the staircase.

1508
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:30,167
While climbing up, mashima's feet got
entangled in the wire and she fell over…

1509
02:08:32,667 --> 02:08:35,833
Arresting Tareq was part of our plan…

1510
02:08:35,833 --> 02:08:39,542
After Tareq' s arrest, Bapi started contacting
his partner Amir Hussein in Dubai…

1511
02:08:39,583 --> 02:08:42,833
United Construction Company...

1512
02:08:42,833 --> 02:08:47,292
headed by Rajiv Chhetri and
Kanhaiyalal Dalmia.

1513
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:48,917
My God!
Yes…

1514
02:08:48,917 --> 02:08:52,833
We were able to intercept this whole
gang with the help of Tareq Ali…

1515
02:08:53,917 --> 02:08:55,417
But why my mother, Ritam?

1516
02:08:56,542 --> 02:09:01,208
You used my mother
to nab a criminal...?

1517
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:03,625
I took the risk ..
knowing Tareq was there…

1518
02:09:03,667 --> 02:09:05,333
And I was certain...

1519
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:08,958
that as long as Tareq was there...
no harm would befall mashima…

1520
02:09:08,958 --> 02:09:10,292
But I am sorry...

1521
02:09:10,917 --> 02:09:12,625
I admit...

1522
02:09:13,417 --> 02:09:15,792
I am responsible for
mashima's present condition….

1523
02:09:17,542 --> 02:09:19,083
By the way...

1524
02:09:19,083 --> 02:09:21,208
you are looking
for Tareq, aren't you...?

1525
02:09:27,458 --> 02:09:30,833
Brother... do you know where
Tareq Ali is?

1526
02:09:33,042 --> 02:09:41,750
Show me the way my Nabi
My mind river flows without destination

1527
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:48,875
In which quay shall I
find my destination …

1528
02:09:48,917 --> 02:09:57,333
Murshid, tell me for once the address
which I've been searching relentlessly …

1529
02:10:02,333 --> 02:10:07,333
Which address will reveal my home!

1530
02:10:09,667 --> 02:10:11,708
I failed to protect your mother...

1531
02:10:13,625 --> 02:10:16,417
Though your mother is
my mother too…

1532
02:10:17,917 --> 02:10:19,542
I won't be able to return to that house…

1533
02:10:19,583 --> 02:10:21,375
Ma wants to see you Tarak..

1534
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:27,292
At the hospital, she was asking for
you, all the time...

1535
02:10:27,833 --> 02:10:32,042
Just a few minutes ago... you said...
my mother is also your mother…

1536
02:10:36,458 --> 02:10:40,042
That makes you my brother...
from this day onwards Tarak…

1537
02:10:40,042 --> 02:10:41,333
Come with me…

1538
02:10:43,542 --> 02:10:44,542
Come…

1539
02:10:48,542 --> 02:10:52,625
Five months later...

1540
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:01,583
Mashima…

1541
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:05,375
Ani... Anirban Goswami...

1542
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:08,625
Vatsav... gotra...

1543
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:50,000
Mashima... are there any others...
or do I end the rituals?

1544
02:11:53,042 --> 02:11:54,583
I have another son…

1545
02:11:56,333 --> 02:11:58,042
Meaning?

1546
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:58,917
Tareq...

1547
02:12:01,125 --> 02:12:03,125
Tareq Ali…

1548
02:12:04,542 --> 02:12:06,542
Offer prayers in his name…

1549
02:12:08,792 --> 02:12:09,667
Gotra?

1550
02:12:11,917 --> 02:12:13,708
'Gotra'?

1551
02:12:14,167 --> 02:12:18,292
'Gotra'... Humanism...
and religion Humanity…

1552
02:12:18,667 --> 02:12:25,000
A Baishnab is he
who stays by you for life...

1553
02:12:25,042 --> 02:12:31,042
Feels the pain of others...

1554
02:12:43,292 --> 02:12:48,000
In spite of helping others
in many ways...

1555
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,958
He doesn't have an
iota of pride in him...

1556
02:13:30,958 --> 02:13:37,333
