1
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:43,707
Give alms for the blind horse,
O people.

2
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,310
Give alms for the blind horse,
O people.

3
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:05,763
Give alms for the blind horse,
O people.

4
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,034
Kindly get up and make a cup of tea.

5
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:50,968
Didn't you listen?

6
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,344
See what your father is upto.

7
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,183
Make him a cup of tea.

8
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,741
They are wet with dew.

9
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,770
So many times have
I said to keep them inside.

10
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,872
Wake up now.
Otherwise father will be angry.

11
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:05,132
Father, you go inside
or you will catch a cold.

12
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:10,305
I will bring the tea inside.

13
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,688
Don't beat the speechless creatures.

14
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,101
You start beating these hungry
fellows early in the morning.

15
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:18,068
Is anyone left alive here?

16
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,008
Get up.
The village council is gathering.

17
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,982
What happened uncle?
At least tell something.

18
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,721
Girl, you can ask later.
First send your father.

19
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,426
You shall know about things when..

20
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,960
..we all have to take shelter
in the desert, like nomads.

21
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:06,751
Walk fast.

They have left us nowhere.

41
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,924
Have some courage,
sister, have courage.

42
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:43,934
How can we have any courage?

43
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,403
Do whatever you want brothers.

44
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,843
We will die here only.

45
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,779
Anyways,
they have hardly left us alive.

46
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,791
Is this the way issues are resolved?

47
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,965
You have been mumbling for so long,
have you reached any resolution?

48
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,093
Nobody has cared to get
a cup of tea for their kids.

49
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,898
Just keep talking aimlessly.

50
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,828
Do one thing,
send the children with me..

51
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,836
..till there is no solution.

52
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:36,007
My house is like your own.

53
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:40,336
You and your sons stay here,
come what may.

54
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,738
We will see who has
the guts to evict you.

55
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,716
Its been seven years
since you've been living here.

56
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:48,383
This way the village will
tell all our neighbourhood..

57
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:51,352
..that the land where we have
our homes belongs to the village.

58
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:53,656
Remove your belongings from here.

59
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,885
How's your son? The one in the city.

60
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,656
He's fine. May they
be happy wherever they live.

61
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:11,826
How come such a tragedy
happened in the night?

62
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,126
You stay in the village or
some far flung forest? You fool.

63
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,234
The dispute has been
going on for months..

64
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:20,865
..and you come and ask what's
the matter. Hats off to you!

65
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,271
Who is Dharma amongst you?

66
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:03,171
Its me.

67
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,237
And these two?

68
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,750
They are people from my community.

69
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,688
Come on, move away.

70
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,016
Go get lost.

71
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,898
Am I talking in Pashto?
Didn't you listen?

72
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,361
Go and sit there.

73
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,138
When I have spoken to him,
you can come and sympathise.

74
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,738
They have not come to
steal something from you.

75
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,878
They are people from my community.

76
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,219
In times of crisis if
they don't come, then who will?

77
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,761
It is this community bonding of
yours that has spoiled your brain.

78
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,222
Otherwise we would have
settled the issue long ago.

79
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,928
How can our brains get spoilt, sir?

80
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:01,704
Only if we have a brain,
will it get spoilt.

81
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:04,131
When we don't have a brain,
what is there to spoil?

82
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:43,446
What was he saying?

83
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,014
Why is the police coming this way?

84
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,180
Come on old man.

85
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:56,387
Leave him you scoundrels.

86
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,055
May you be hit by plague.

87
00:20:59,097 --> 00:20:59,995
Move away old woman.

88
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:03,056
Bloody goons, why don't
you arrest the big bellied..

89
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:06,228
..who have demolished our house.

90
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:09,702
You ruthless scoundrels.

91
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:14,741
You cunning bastards.
May your children die.

92
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:21,413
May the black snake bite you.

93
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:26,287
May you never wake from your sleep.

94
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:35,325
It's the era of the satan.

95
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,398
May your children die.

96
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,794
Come on, lets move fast.

97
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,158
How can there be such injustice.

98
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:01,742
Come back here. Idiots.

99
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:04,976
Will you turn back fast?

100
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:24,169
I had told the watchman
that I'm coming.

101
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:28,200
Why did you all take the trouble?
Tell me, what's the matter?

102
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:32,312
You still don't know of the issue?

103
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:35,315
I know absolutely nothing.

104
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,913
Ask the watchman standing
here if he has told me anything.

105
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,251
Sarpanch, you talk as
if you were born yesterday.

106
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:47,924
It's been two months
since the trouble started.

107
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,762
O silly fellow,
is there one problem in the village?

108
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,239
A new problem keeps
erupting every now and then.

109
00:28:56,807 --> 00:29:00,299
Do I dream of which
issue you are talking about?

110
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:05,305
You know that Dharma had
his house on Surjit's land..

111
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:09,084
..which Surjit sold to the factory.

112
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,911
The new owners came with
a bulldozer and razed his house.

113
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:14,021
Really? Razed It?

114
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,353
Not just razed, they took
away the doors and the windows too.

115
00:29:18,863 --> 00:29:21,161
And the police took away Dharma.

116
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:46,623
How can anyone
obstruct a legal issue?

117
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:52,355
Tomorrow I can also say that this
house is mine and not Sarpanch's..

118
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,994
..because I had tea here today!

119
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:58,098
This is as if I rule the land.

120
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,296
After all,
law has some authority or not?

121
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,007
Of course it's like their own law.

122
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,108
When, for the sake of votes..

123
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,081
..they have been
given land for their homes,

124
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:13,807
given hand-pumps,

125
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:17,718
made their barely educated
kids officers above us.

126
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:19,412
Then it is their own rule.

127
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,350
Not yours, mine or Sarpanch's.

128
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,040
You all move now.

129
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:44,045
I will join you with the
rest of the village representatives.

130
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:48,375
You go and meet our village
lawyer outside the courts.

131
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:50,085
I will see you there.

132
00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:52,382
Till what time should
we wait for you there?

133
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:55,691
What do you mean?

134
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:57,451
I will be there before you.

135
00:30:57,728 --> 00:30:59,218
Shouldn't I even wear my shoes?

136
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,821
I will reach soon.

137
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:18,973
Member, you behave like a woman.

138
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,081
You should have at
least said something.

139
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:22,743
Just stood here like a scarecrow.

140
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:25,982
Let's go.

141
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:15,458
Uncle, how frequent
are the buses here?

142
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:20,164
Its unpredictable.
Sometimes every half hour,

143
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:22,330
sometimes two come together.

144
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,705
At times there is
no bus till evening.

145
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:27,301
Same is the situation
in our village.

146
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:30,712
Besides, there's a private
bus service also there.

147
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:33,179
There must be mostly
government buses here?

148
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:35,045
They are all the same.

149
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:43,822
Anyways,
what difference does it make?

150
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:53,859
Why don't you both sit.

151
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,370
Bloody monkeys.

152
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:59,940
Didn't you listen? Come sit here.

153
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,771
Come here both of you.

154
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,413
Sit there.

155
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,729
Whose land is this, uncle?

156
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:26,896
It belonged to the landlords.

157
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,934
Recently they sold it off.

158
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,869
Dharma of our community
had his house there.

159
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:34,471
They demolished it in the night.

160
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,040
Demolished it?

161
00:34:37,214 --> 00:34:38,977
How could they just demolish it?

162
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,309
How can you challenge the mighty?

163
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:44,183
They did as they wanted.

164
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:50,093
Is it some anarchy that
they demolished a settled home?

165
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,228
If this was the case,
were the rest of you dead?

166
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:55,160
You should have pounced on them.

167
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,030
What would have
happened at the most?

168
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,699
You think we did not oppose it?

169
00:35:01,138 --> 00:35:03,834
Oppose.. you must have.

170
00:35:03,974 --> 00:35:07,171
But what difference
does it make to anyone?

171
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,713
Dear girl,
ask Melu to come and see me one day.

172
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:21,851
Don't worry. I will send him soon.

173
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,729
Gentleman,
we have to reach Sarpanch's house.

174
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,260
Will this path be fine?

175
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,805
Yes, this one is fine.

176
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,867
Turn left from the pond.

177
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:47,171
Greetings.

178
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:10,867
When we were about to sleep,
you know what happened?

179
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,808
What? - My earrings..

180
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,011
Which one?

181
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:18,172
The ones my mother had gifted me..
they fell somewhere.

182
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:22,478
My mother-in-law said
"how did you lose them?

183
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:24,777
They looked so nice on you."

184
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:27,221
I said "how can I find them now?"

185
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:31,922
The village is so
big and it was night.

186
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:36,728
And who would
return them if found?

187
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:41,032
The entire procession
turned back with the torches.

188
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:45,871
Asking in front of each
house if they found the earrings.

189
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:49,673
I told my mother-in-law: "Forget it.
We will get new ones made.

190
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:52,112
We are in a wedding and should
let the celebrations go on."

191
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:25,046
Sister, do they own this house?

192
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,441
No, it's rented.

193
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:29,749
They are just like us.

194
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,913
Earlier her father-in-law
lived here. He died.

195
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:36,254
Now the owners can't get the place
vacated. Nor do they want to leave.

196
00:42:42,432 --> 00:42:44,957
You have these while I get the tea.

197
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:49,735
You ruffians..

198
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:52,297
..come and have some snacks.

199
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:12,757
What work does her husband do?

200
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,460
She says he works as a foreman.

201
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:19,367
But actually he just lifts
coal in the thermal plant.

202
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:23,964
Why do they need to lie?

203
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:28,869
Well, they can boast
that they are well off.

204
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:35,481
I was asking just like that.

205
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:24,187
What happened?

206
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:27,457
I had hidden the money in this.
It's not there now.

207
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:31,294
You must have kept it somewhere
else. Search properly.

208
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,794
No, I had kept it in this.

209
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:36,096
Did it fly away?

210
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:39,068
It's all his handiwork.

211
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:43,643
Whose? Melu's?

212
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:45,246
Who else?

213
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:47,272
Must have wasted it on alcohol.

214
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,842
Now he has also
started doing all this.

215
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,812
If I had known, I would
have taken the money with me.

216
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,151
I would have never left it behind.

217
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:01,425
There is nothing left
to even buy grocery.

218
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:04,025
Should I now cook
his head for the meal?

219
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,736
What's the point of wailing now?

220
00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:10,263
When you don't share these
matters with your close relatives,

221
00:46:10,874 --> 00:46:12,432
..then suffer the consequences.

222
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:14,307
What can anyone do?

223
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:33,426
Come on, don't get distracted.

224
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:38,885
Deesa..

225
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,121
O Deesa..

226
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:52,193
What's the matter?

227
00:49:10,954 --> 00:49:13,252
How did this happen?

228
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:17,359
Did you have a fight with someone?

229
00:49:19,095 --> 00:49:20,392
No, friend.

230
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:23,663
A calf suddenly came in front,
near the fort.

231
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,665
I lost control of the
handle and crashed into a wall.

232
00:49:29,939 --> 00:49:32,703
Melu Singh, stop bluffing me.

233
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:35,340
Its my daily job.

234
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:39,908
If you still think that I am dumb,

235
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:42,811
..then its upto you brother.

236
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,617
Why will I lie to you, friend?

237
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:47,287
I swear by the holy cow.

238
00:49:47,991 --> 00:49:49,856
Why do you swear by the cow?

239
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:52,254
If you don't want to tell,
don't tell.

240
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:54,286
What will I achieve by knowing?

241
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:39,268
Get the bandage done
once again tomorrow.

242
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:15,434
Deesa, let's go to
the village one day.

243
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,975
What will we do in the village,
Melu Singh?

244
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:25,753
Eat the leftovers of the landlords?

245
00:51:26,422 --> 00:51:28,413
Besides, what is left for us there?

246
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:33,090
Parents have died.

247
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:37,160
The small house that is there
is taken by my younger brother.

248
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:41,268
Have I built any cold storage
there that I need to go?

249
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:47,373
Don't you want to
give any medicine to eat?

250
00:57:57,646 --> 00:57:59,341
Be quiet.. shut up.

251
00:57:59,815 --> 00:58:01,180
Come inside.

252
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:17,858
I see you have a deep wound.

253
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:20,327
Let me apply a paste
of turmeric and oil.

254
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:25,061
Be quiet, you old Hakim.

255
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:31,933
Let me apply a paste
of turmeric and oil.

256
00:59:32,007 --> 00:59:35,272
It will quickly heal your wound.

257
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:40,382
O old man, just go away.

258
00:59:40,749 --> 00:59:42,239
Where should I go away?

259
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,014
I am repeatedly telling you..

260
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:48,279
It will give you relief..
its a home remedy.

261
00:59:48,757 --> 00:59:50,019
Just go away, friend.

262
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:53,153
Its a home remedy..

263
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:56,624
Let me sleep for a while.

264
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:12,914
Blue eyes and round cheeks

265
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:15,712
Your every bit full of youth..

266
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:20,153
..out in the world,
you will wreak havoc over us.

267
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:35,659
O, you should not giggle so much..

268
01:00:35,738 --> 01:00:38,798
..standing amongst the girls.

269
01:00:39,074 --> 01:00:41,770
Having crossed the age of fifteen..

270
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,244
..tread cautiously in the day.

271
01:01:02,197 --> 01:01:04,165
Hurry up, pick your glass.

272
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:06,360
Be patient.

273
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:09,334
Ok, give it.

274
01:01:11,373 --> 01:01:13,967
C'mon! - Wait.

275
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:18,773
Drink.

276
01:01:24,453 --> 01:01:26,045
What a relief.

277
01:01:26,388 --> 01:01:28,185
Lets play a round now.

278
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:34,828
Pick it.

279
01:01:48,911 --> 01:01:50,276
Pick it.

280
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:01,278
Come on leader, come join us.

281
01:02:01,357 --> 01:02:03,052
Let's play a game.

282
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,957
Look, he has got the real
certificate of leadership!

283
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:15,860
If I find any clubs with you,
I'll not spare you.

284
01:02:19,975 --> 01:02:22,705
Come, I'll show you
my true colours today.

285
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:27,915
O, Melu..

286
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:32,887
Your wife was supposed
to reach today..

287
01:02:39,194 --> 01:02:40,855
Brother Melu Singh..

288
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:45,299
I'll give you an advice.
Will you follow?

289
01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:47,699
Pick it.

290
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:54,832
It's been seven years
since you moved here.

291
01:02:56,678 --> 01:02:58,873
Tell me, what have you achieved?

292
01:02:59,848 --> 01:03:01,907
You have been abusing your body.

293
01:03:01,984 --> 01:03:03,110
Or not?

294
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:06,721
Scoundrels like us are fine.

295
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:10,350
At sunset we come over to Sitaram's,

296
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:13,190
..have a couple of
swigs and become kings.

297
01:03:13,896 --> 01:03:15,261
And this idiot..

298
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:20,992
This idiot keeps breaking
his legs till midnight.

299
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,134
And neither eats
nor drinks anything.

300
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:29,206
You fool..

301
01:03:30,145 --> 01:03:33,114
Half your breath has been
squeezed out by your family..

302
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:36,845
..and the remaining
half by your work.

303
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:42,154
The hundred that you earn in a day..

304
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:45,920
..and the ten that
you save for food,

305
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:48,191
..how long will your
wife be happy with that?

306
01:03:49,398 --> 01:03:51,093
You know what will
happen in the end?

307
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:57,060
In the end she will find a desperate
man like me and run away with him!

308
01:03:57,673 --> 01:03:59,971
And you will be left with nothing.

309
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:06,708
This dick-head looks
very depressed today.

310
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:09,317
Get up, you looser. Let's go.

311
01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:13,344
If you had taken the
amount of blows we did,

312
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:17,916
..your wife would
have been wailing by now.

313
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:22,255
He who did not drink heavily..

314
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:24,859
..and did not mercilessly
beat his wife..

315
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:26,901
..and did not get high on drugs

316
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:29,130
..of what use is that man's life!

317
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,431
Lets's wrap it up.

318
01:04:35,844 --> 01:04:38,244
Lets go.

319
01:08:17,332 --> 01:08:18,890
O you merciful one..

320
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:21,299
Forgive us O Lord.

321
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:23,769
Must remain fearful of your acts.

322
01:08:24,406 --> 01:08:27,273
What was it like before
and what happens now..

323
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,109
What will become of this world?

324
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:39,114
See.. how many stalks
of mustard these must be.

325
01:08:39,154 --> 01:08:41,622
I slogged the whole
day plucking cotton..

326
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:43,885
..getting scratches on my hands.

327
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:46,018
I didn't leave a
single bud in the field.

328
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,892
While leaving,
I plucked a few leaves of mustard..

329
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,922
..and these stalks for the goats.

330
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:56,069
He said: "Who the hell
are you to touch our mustard?"

331
01:08:56,304 --> 01:08:58,272
He started fuming in anger.

332
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:04,805
He said: "You have
ruined our mustard fields!"

333
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,112
I also got angry and said:

334
01:09:07,215 --> 01:09:10,981
"Listen kid. I am like your mother,
have some shame."

335
01:09:11,052 --> 01:09:12,246
"Is this the way to talk?"

336
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:16,420
He said: "You ruin our fields
and we should be ashamed of it!"

337
01:09:16,825 --> 01:09:20,693
I said: "These are
just two stalks of mustard.

338
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:23,196
God has given you everything.

339
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:27,133
Now you even have a
tractor as big as a house.

340
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:30,932
You miserly,
what are two stalks of mustard?"

341
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:33,099
God also has to give it to..

342
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:35,974
..those who don't have
any respect or pity for humans.

343
01:09:36,044 --> 01:09:39,309
I will never again pluck
cotton for such treacherous people.

344
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,246
First, they don't pay
wages for two-two months..

345
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:43,079
..and when they settle your
accounts, they cut half your wages.

346
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:47,144
Still they boss over
you: "We give you work!"

347
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:51,023
If you give us work,
you don't do us any favour.

348
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:52,889
Its for your own need
that you call us to work.

349
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:55,896
Hundred carts of mustard stalks
would be lying with the trecherous,

350
01:09:55,964 --> 01:09:58,626
never will they give
a bundle to anyone.

351
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,693
Those will rot in the summer, but
they don't let anyone touch them.

352
01:10:03,138 --> 01:10:07,370
Finally I got these stalks
of mustard from Khema's farm.

353
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:12,146
Even he did not simply give it and
made it sound like some huge favour.

354
01:10:12,214 --> 01:10:17,083
He muttered: "Aunt, you
can take it today, but not again.

355
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:19,277
We also don't have much of it."

356
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:22,390
What is this? It's just meagre fuel.

357
01:10:22,891 --> 01:10:24,358
Those were also the times..

358
01:10:24,426 --> 01:10:27,691
..when people called you
home to take away the dry stalks.

359
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:32,096
The poor would give blessings.

360
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:37,365
Don't know what's
happening to this world.

361
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:41,067
Even the devil does
not behave like this.

362
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:35,923
What the hell have you done,
my enemy?

363
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:38,864
May the earth devour
you at such a small age.

364
01:11:39,935 --> 01:11:42,199
Why are you beating up the poor kid?

365
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:44,296
At least ask him what happened.

366
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:47,139
Bachittar's son hit
the goat with a sickle.

367
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,802
Why? Why the hell did he hit it?

368
01:11:49,878 --> 01:11:52,005
Did the goat eat his grape vine?

369
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:56,873
May there be no one left
to light their funeral pyres..

370
01:11:56,952 --> 01:11:58,920
Let there be no one
left to remember them.

371
01:11:58,954 --> 01:12:01,081
May there be no trace left of them.

372
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,824
Girl, I told you
to make some rotis..

373
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,760
..so that I can go
and give it to them.

374
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,164
You are standing as if
you are attending a wedding.

375
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:16,430
Are you in your senses or not?

376
01:12:17,706 --> 01:12:19,196
Is the sun rising or setting?

377
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:20,999
Make them. I will go and give.

378
01:12:21,076 --> 01:12:23,135
You expect me to go in the dark?

379
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:25,236
She's sitting idly.

380
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:33,282
Were you also hit somewhere?

381
01:12:35,824 --> 01:12:37,416
Were you also hit somewhere?

382
01:12:38,026 --> 01:12:41,086
I got two blows here,
and one at the back.

383
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:48,001
Don't worry. They will
suffer from a deadly disease.

384
01:12:48,269 --> 01:12:50,169
You lie and be warm in the quilt.

385
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:51,899
I will make you some tea.

386
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,167
Fine?

387
01:13:29,778 --> 01:13:33,407
Today Melu Singh has
crossed all limits.

388
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:38,476
At least tell us what's the matter.

389
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:04,008
There is no issue.

390
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:07,042
I just don't feel like..

391
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:13,119
What will he tell you?

392
01:14:14,189 --> 01:14:15,884
You ask me.

393
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:19,720
He has taken to heart what we said.

394
01:14:21,129 --> 01:14:23,120
Nothing else.

395
01:14:24,232 --> 01:14:25,722
Swear.

396
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:27,697
Ask him.

397
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,699
Is that the truth, Melu?

398
01:14:34,142 --> 01:14:39,739
If that is the case,
then we both apologise to you.

399
01:14:44,686 --> 01:14:49,248
We both just talk nonsense.

400
01:14:51,326 --> 01:14:53,851
While giving away wisdom..

401
01:14:55,296 --> 01:14:57,662
..God overlooked us a little.

402
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:05,097
A man talks according to
the sense he has.

403
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:09,941
Don't take it to heart.

404
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,314
One should not feel bad.

405
01:15:26,027 --> 01:15:27,858
What do you think Melu Singh,

406
01:15:30,965 --> 01:15:33,195
that we are happy talking nonsense?

407
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,239
Take this..

408
01:15:41,843 --> 01:15:44,744
..have a swig.

409
01:15:57,659 --> 01:15:59,650
Then I will tell you..

410
01:16:02,697 --> 01:16:05,825
who you are and who I am!

411
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:30,891
Now you listen to me carefully.

412
01:16:33,027 --> 01:16:34,995
Now you are capable of listening.

413
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:39,698
Till a person is not drunk,

414
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:47,335
he can neither listen
nor understand anything.

415
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,207
Understood?

416
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:56,106
How can a person in his senses
understand anything!

417
01:18:15,797 --> 01:18:17,822
If I have my way,

418
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:21,899
I will set the water on fire.

419
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:26,870
Set this thermal plant on fire.

420
01:18:29,377 --> 01:18:31,868
Burn down the entire city.

421
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,216
Is this a thing to drink?

422
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:42,749
Poison..

423
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:44,884
..bloody poison.

424
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:55,694
People say that
the soul does not die.

425
01:18:57,705 --> 01:19:00,674
If the soul does not die,
then what is bloody death?

426
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:03,971
Isn't that also a life?

427
01:19:07,148 --> 01:19:08,240
Or not?

428
01:23:57,071 --> 01:24:00,006
Add the bill to my account.
I will pay together.

429
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,310
Your wife will come back tomorrow.

430
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:07,745
She will go to her parents
after six months or a year.

431
01:24:07,948 --> 01:24:09,711
Then you will come
and show your face.

432
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:12,376
Till then Chaunda
will be after my life.

433
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,988
Come and give it yourself
by tomorrow or day after, brother.

434
01:24:58,065 --> 01:24:59,692
Who's there?

435
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,731
It's me.

436
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,894
Who me?

437
01:25:05,072 --> 01:25:06,664
Me Melu.

438
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,117
Have you come to dig
the earth at this hour?

439
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:22,915
What's the matter?

440
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:25,285
I will tell you.
At least let me come inside.

441
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:37,762
You should not come
at such odd hours, friend.

442
01:25:39,707 --> 01:25:41,299
At least park that uncle
of yours on the side.

443
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,798
I will spend the night here, friend.

444
01:26:15,776 --> 01:26:17,175
This is not possible, brother.

445
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:19,712
Have such camaraderie
with someone else.

446
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:22,774
I am a man with family to support.

447
01:26:23,217 --> 01:26:24,912
If something goes wrong..

448
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:27,243
I will be left with nowhere to go.

449
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:45,004
Remember then what you said now.

450
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:07,951
Asshole..

451
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:12,254
He behaves as if
I live on his father's pension.

452
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:30,192
All of you go home.
Don't stand here.

453
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,404
You also get back home, aunt.

454
01:34:32,573 --> 01:34:33,870
Feena is all right.

455
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:35,665
Don't create commotion
unnecessarily.

456
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:51,823
Seemed to be Lakha's younger son.
Maybe he's telling the truth.

457
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,387
Maybe he just said it to comfort me.

458
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:05,096
Be strong. Lets go home.
Men will look into the matter.

459
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:10,640
God knows what's
happening in the village.

460
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:11,803
It's better to remain quiet.

461
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:45,243
What happened, mother?

462
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,812
Hey mother, what's the matter?

463
01:37:35,389 --> 01:37:36,879
Go and lie down inside.

464
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:40,156
Why?

465
01:37:40,327 --> 01:37:41,624
What's wrong here?

466
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:45,127
I am fine here.

467
01:37:45,632 --> 01:37:47,532
Is there any storm brewing?

468
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:50,562
Have you ever seen
a storm in the winters?

469
01:37:53,407 --> 01:37:54,533
You get up.

470
01:38:51,398 --> 01:38:55,164
Give alms for the blind horse,
O people..

471
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:03,872
Give alms for the blind horse,
O people..

472
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:23,793
What happened?

473
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:27,166
Nothing.

474
01:39:27,701 --> 01:39:31,899
I was perfectly fine outside,
she asked me to lie down inside.

475
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:35,403
Tell me, what was the need?

476
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:39,476
So, should she have
put a sack on you there?

477
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:59,355
You went there. What was the matter?
Did you come to know?

478
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:03,660
What was there to know?

479
01:40:23,757 --> 01:40:26,658
So brother, were you able to decide?

480
01:40:33,767 --> 01:40:35,598
What? You are off to sleep so early?

481
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:37,261
Greetings, uncle.

482
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:40,901
Just like that.

483
01:40:41,174 --> 01:40:42,539
You are off so soon?

484
01:40:42,943 --> 01:40:45,605
I just have to load Lala's sacks.

485
01:40:46,813 --> 01:40:49,407
So did you decide?

486
01:40:51,818 --> 01:40:53,752
I suggest you come with me.

487
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,447
We will stay there tomorrow.

488
01:40:55,722 --> 01:40:59,681
If the boys are not happy,
we will return in the evening.

489
01:40:59,759 --> 01:41:01,852
Nobody is going to
forcibly keep us there.

490
01:41:02,195 --> 01:41:03,662
Isn't that so?

491
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:07,757
Will you have some tea?

492
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:09,600
Tea?

493
01:41:09,636 --> 01:41:11,263
It will unnecessarily waste time.

494
01:41:11,538 --> 01:41:14,166
I suggest let's go. Why waste time?

495
01:41:15,308 --> 01:41:17,503
Don't worry. It's very cold.

496
01:41:17,878 --> 01:41:20,438
Besides, the night is long.

497
01:41:28,688 --> 01:41:32,249
Brothers,
give alms for the blind horse..

498
01:41:37,397 --> 01:41:41,197
Brothers,
give alms for the blind horse..

499
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:52,707
Brothers,
give alms for the blind horse..

500
01:42:12,632 --> 01:42:15,260
So dear,
should I then go with Labbhu?

501
01:42:17,637 --> 01:42:20,435
You decide father. As you wish.

502
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:24,609
What is there to see.
I will go and meet Melu.

503
01:42:24,878 --> 01:42:27,711
I will return by tomorrow
evening along with Labbhu.

504
01:42:29,416 --> 01:42:30,644
Fine.

505
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:33,915
If you don't wish, I will not go.

506
01:42:36,222 --> 01:42:38,417
Why not father? You should go.

507
01:42:39,693 --> 01:42:43,527
Every idle and useless
person here thinks he's the boss.

508
01:42:45,432 --> 01:42:47,832
Besides, don't tell your mother.

509
01:42:47,901 --> 01:42:52,668
If she asks, tell her I have
gone for a meeting in the village.

510
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,767
Where are you off to sister?

511
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:53,312
Be quiet. I will come back soon.

512
01:45:53,653 --> 01:45:55,143
You go off to sleep.

513
01:45:55,455 --> 01:45:57,150
I will have a look at the goat.

514
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:00,150
Let me see if she is
eating any fodder or not.

515
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:04,252
It seems she has fever.
Poor creature.

516
01:46:04,497 --> 01:46:06,465
Only if animals could
judge for themselves.

517
01:47:25,578 --> 01:47:30,413
How can we leave what
our ancestors have been doing?

518
01:47:31,384 --> 01:47:34,547
If there is no eclipse for 2 years,
how will you survive?

519
01:47:34,821 --> 01:47:36,755
You don't get rid
of ancestor's customs,

520
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:38,882
that's why you have
suffered for ages.

521
01:47:39,292 --> 01:47:42,728
This is God's will.

522
01:47:43,496 --> 01:47:47,227
We have to abide by the tradition.

523
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:48,790
Bloody God's will..

524
01:47:49,135 --> 01:47:53,094
I am repeatedly requesting
you to go home.

525
01:47:53,239 --> 01:47:55,434
Or should I give you your alms here?

526
01:47:55,708 --> 01:47:59,474
I will go if that's how
you are going to talk..

527
01:48:00,146 --> 01:48:02,614
Unnecessarily you are
talking rough, brother.

528
01:48:48,328 --> 01:48:50,523
Dayalo..

529
01:48:50,596 --> 01:48:52,120
O girl..

530
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,231
Dayalo..

531
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:05,907
Dayalo.

532
01:49:09,849 --> 01:49:11,441
Brother Melu..

533
01:49:20,226 --> 01:49:21,853
Its midnight..

534
01:49:22,895 --> 01:49:24,328
Where were you headed to?

535
01:49:27,367 --> 01:49:28,766
Nowhere.

536
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:32,470
I was just feeling restless at home.

537
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:37,336
Have you gone mad?

538
01:49:38,745 --> 01:49:40,736
On such a day, nobody comes out.

539
01:49:41,948 --> 01:49:43,176
Come..

540
01:49:44,884 --> 01:49:46,374
Let's go home.

541
01:50:16,616 --> 01:50:20,575
"O the boat of the Stern One.."

542
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:25,914
"..you who took him away from me."

543
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:33,693
"O the boat of the Stern One.."

544
01:50:35,234 --> 01:50:39,432
"..you who took him away from me."

545
01:50:43,543 --> 01:50:46,842
"On your bow lies asleep.."

546
01:50:48,614 --> 01:50:51,549
"On your bow lies asleep.."

547
01:50:52,118 --> 01:50:56,316
"..my indifferent Lord."

548
01:50:57,523 --> 01:51:00,151
"O the boat of the Stern One.."

549
01:51:00,226 --> 01:51:04,253
"..you who took him away from me."

550
01:51:08,367 --> 01:51:11,564
"Is that all the white shroud.."

551
01:51:13,206 --> 01:51:16,869
"..that you have left me.."

552
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:21,644
"..the fish has been cast ashore."

553
01:51:27,286 --> 01:51:30,551
"Is that all the white shroud.."

554
01:51:31,724 --> 01:51:35,854
"..that you have left me.."

555
01:51:36,863 --> 01:51:41,391
"..the fish has been cast ashore."

556
01:51:45,404 --> 01:51:49,704
"Her body scribbled with.."

557
01:51:51,811 --> 01:51:55,303
"Her body scribbled with.."

558
01:51:55,848 --> 01:52:00,342
"..all the love and pain."
