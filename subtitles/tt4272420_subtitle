00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,208
'Every man has his own story.'

3
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,458
'Just like Amitabh Bachchan did, in Deewar.'

4
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,125
'Similarly, even I have a story.'

5
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,458
'But there's a huge difference..'

6
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,125
'..between my story and Amitabh Bachchan's story in Deewar.'

7
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,166
'And the biggest difference is..'

8
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:12,541
'I still don't pick-up money thrown at me.'

9
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,041
'But I do.'

10
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,625
'After all I am a Gujarati.'

11
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,208
'I was born in Rajkot, Gujarat.'

12
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,791
'Father was a trader.'

13
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:26,000
'And mom was always worried about his son settling down.'

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,250
'He did get married... To Kokila.'

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,541
'My dear wife.'

16
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,083
'I tried my best to make Kokila a big star.'

17
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,125
'But failed.'

18
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,333
'It was impossible.'

19
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,625
'Children are a specialty of Gujaratis.'

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,458
'Sign of manhood.'

21
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,916
'And we soon became a family of five.'

22
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,791
'But since we only had a single bedroom..'

23
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,208
'..we had no choice but to disjoint this joint family.'

24
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,208
'And we arrived in Kuala Lumpur.'

25
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,875
'By us I mean Koki, Jigar and Me.'

26
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,791
'In Kuala Lumpur, our house is on Petaling Jaya.'

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,708
'We started a new family business.'

28
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,041
'Patel Stores.'

29
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,541
These are my best friends.

30
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,125
Velji and Nausar.

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,666
'We Gujaratis have another specialty.'

32
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,166
'There must be at least one temple at walking distance from our home.'

00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,500
'So Koki was busy in the temple..'

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,458
'..and I, in my store.'

35
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,375
'Bollywood is my passion.'

36
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,541
'From Madhubala to Madhuri, every actress..'

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,625
'..held a special place at every turn of my life.'

38
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,333
I forgot to introduce myself... Sorry.

39
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,625
I am Praveen Patel... PP.

40
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,166
Hi.

41
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,625
You all must be wondering..

42
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,750
..why I am narrating this boring story.

43
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Because...like every story in this world..

44
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,291
..there's a twist in this story too.

45
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,916
And that twist is a girl.

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,916
And her name is Shanaya.

47
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,291
"Your wet body...sets the water on fire."

48
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,291
"Baby you're just like a fish...

49
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,041
"Slipping through everyone's fingers."

50
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,833
"You play with water...and have loads of fun."

51
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,250
"But don't give us...what we want...tell me why."

52
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,791
"Hot summer...and I am really hot."

53
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,375
"Come on baby let's go get two tequila shots."

54
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,333
"Hot summer...and I am really hot."

55
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,791
"Come on baby let's go get two tequila shots."

"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,625
"Water Dance."

58
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,791
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

59
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,166
"Water Dance."

60
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,041
"Come with me baby and do some romance."

61
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,416
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

62
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,791
"Water Dance."

63
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,208
"After taking a dip in the swimming pool.."

64
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,458
"..baby you look more sultry."

65
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,291
"You look sultry."

66
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,916
"After taking a dip in the swimming pool.."

67
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,958
"..baby you look more sultry."

68
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,958
"You look sultry."

69
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,208
"Liver like steel and heart of platinum."

70
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,666
"Let's do the water dance without a care in the world."

71
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,708
"I am number one... I am priceless baby."

72
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,291
"I'll make you weak in the knees...so baby please."

73
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,125
"These blue eyes...like a pearl in the ocean."

74
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,666
"Don't come out of the pool."

75
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,041
"Or someone might jinx you my hottie."

76
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,666
"These blue eyes...like a pearl in the ocean."

77
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,416
"Don't come out of the pool."

78
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,333
"Or someone might jinx you my hottie."

79
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,458
"Take a look at this gorgeous waist."

80
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,625
"Come on baby let's go get two tequila shots."

81
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,291
"Take a look at this gorgeous waist."

82
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,791
"Come on baby let's go get two tequila shots."

83
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,166
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

84
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,625
"Water Dance."

85
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,875
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

86
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,250
"Water Dance."

87
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,041
"Come with me baby and do some romance."

88
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,416
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

89
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,166
"Water Dance."

90
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:38,250
"You've grown young...but you're not aware."

91
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,625
"Your body shines...like the hot summer sun."

92
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,000
"I've been waiting for you, cause the wise have always said.."

93
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,083
"Baby, patience is always sweetly rewarded."

94
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,166
"Squish and splash...slop and slash."

95
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:53,958
"A girl on the beach splashing water."

96
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,708
"I swear I really like...girls of your age."

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,708
"Hot summer...but you don't know."

98
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,541
"I am your lover, baby...I care for you."

99
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,500
"I am completely crazy...since we met."

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,083
"I am a gal...hard to get."

101
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,833
"But I feel like I'm slowly...slipping hear your words."

102
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,333
"Be patient...you silly boy."

103
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,916
"There must be a reason we met."

104
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,250
"Be patient...you silly boy."

105
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,291
"There must be a reason we met."

106
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

107
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,250
"Water Dance."

108
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,375
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

109
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
"Water Dance."

110
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,541
"Come with me baby and do some romance."

111
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,916
"And just do that... do that... do that... do that..."

112
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,458
"Water Dance."

113
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
"After taking a dip in the swimming pool.."

114
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,875
"..baby you look more sultry."

115
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,750
"You look sultry."

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,916
"After taking a dip in the swimming pool.."

117
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,250
"..baby you look more sultry."

118
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,250
"You look sultry."

119
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,416
Hey old chap, were you watching? - No, I was..

120
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,416
Yes. Only watching.

121
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,041
See you later.

122
00:08:24,541 --> 00:16:48,999
Hi, Mike.

123
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,458
Hello. Hello.

124
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,458
I just saw two beautiful angels.

125
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,166
Hi...hi...hi...hello.

126
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,916
You know, PP, Indian women are a completely different story.

127
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,583
Spicy, spicy.

128
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,125
You're already up to your antics.

129
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,666
Look, I don't want to get into this mess.

130
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,208
I only love my wife.

131
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,666
Hey...even I love your wife. - What do you mean?

132
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,375
Relax. Relax.

133
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
It's his old habit.

134
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,541
He only loves others wives.

135
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,041
That's why I don't get married.

136
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,000
Those who love other's wives, say no to marriage.

137
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,833
And anyway...once you're married..

138
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,708
..love gets washed down the drain.

139
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,541
And what happens next is you going brain dead.

140
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,916
PP...if I tell this to your wife, she will beat you.

141
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,208
Why?

142
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,833
Are you looking for another member for your club?

143
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,041
Club? - Don't you know?

144
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,208
A club for husband's who get beaten by their wife.

145
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,083
That's him.

146
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,375
Hold on. Hold on.

147
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:46,833
Listen...does your wife beat you every day? - No, no, no.

148
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,458
She doesn't beat me regularly.

149
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,625
You see...last month I was giving driving lessons to my secretary.

150
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,083
Hold on.

151
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,333
But giving driving lessons isn't a crime? - Let me explain.

152
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,666
This man...was giving lessons to his secretary..

153
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:10,791
..in the office, with him sitting on his chair and her on his lap.

154
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Which means...she was driving..

155
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,583
..and he was blowing the horn. - Nice.

156
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,541
And...his wife dropped in, caught him red-handed.

157
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,458
And since then she hasn't allowed him..

158
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,333
..to park his car in her garage.

159
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,291
No entry.

160
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,708
Come on, PP, stop laughing.

161
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,041
You'll be caught red-handed someday.

162
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,041
Your countdown begins today.

163
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,458
Not possible. My wife has no time.

164
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,375
Hold on, PP.

165
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
Sister-in-law doesn't have time, and you didn't tell me.

166
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,791
Stupid, I meant she has no time for me.

167
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,958
Why? What is she busy with?

168
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,958
God!

169
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,000
Swamiji. How are you? - All well. Come.

170
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,875
How are you? - All well.

171
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,041
And...did you see the horoscope?

172
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:17,833
I did.

173
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,083
All fine?

174
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,000
Everything was fine, but now there's a problem, Mrs. Patel. - What?

175
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,375
There's a problem. A woman.

176
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,583
Correct. Absolutely correct.

177
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,250
Samsya. - Who?

178
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,083
My maid, my house-help.

179
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,375
She comes to work for 2 days, and takes leave for three.

180
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,750
She really bothers me.

181
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,458
This is not about your maid. - Then.

182
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,375
It's someone who's a threat to you. - Oh my.

183
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,041
Some girl will soon enter your life..

184
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,125
..and she'll make your life hell.

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,416
Disrupt your peace.

186
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,541
Disrupt my peace? - Yes.

187
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,000
Will there be quarrels? - A lot.

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,166
Will we fight? - You will.

189
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,625
I know who is coming.

190
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:03,833
Who?

191
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,708
My Jigolo. - Ji..

192
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,125
Jigolo. My son, Jigar. - Yeah,

193
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,708
His wife. - Wife?

194
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,333
Jigar's a grownup now. - He has.

195
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,708
Since when?

196
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,875
There's a system to know that a boy has grown up.

197
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,666
When you clean a 7 year old boy's room, you'll find comic books.

198
00:12:22,166 --> 00:24:44,996
Yes.

199
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,916
If you clean a 15 year old boy's room, you'll find sports magazines.

200
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:25,833
Yes.

201
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,875
And if you find something like I did this Sunday.

202
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:35,791
You know he's a grownup now. - Find what?

203
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,666
Playboy.

204
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,875
Scared, weren't you?

205
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,666
I'll soon become a mother-in-law. - You will.

206
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,375
But this problem will soon enter your life.

207
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,083
That woman is going to trouble you a lot.

208
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,250
And I have a solution to avert this problem..

209
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,916
..which I can give to you if you want.

210
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,916
How much do I pay you?

211
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,916
You know me really well, Mrs. Patel. - Right.

212
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,750
Jigar!

213
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,791
Jigar!

214
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,291
Jigar!

215
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,291
Who's going to clean this up?

216
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,375
Jigar!

217
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,916
Jigar!

218
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
Stupid, fool...I've told you a thousand times..

219
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,416
..stop playing that guitar and look after the family business.

220
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,166
Why don't you listen?

221
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,875
Have you lost it? - Shameless, what did you say to your father?

222
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,583
And why are you playing it so loudly?

223
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,333
So Naina can hear it too.

224
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,041
Naina?

225
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,041
Where is she?

226
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,208
Hey...idiot.

227
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,750
Stay away from a girl who's got two Na's in her name.'

228
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,541
Look... Na-I-Na... Naina.

229
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,083
Dad, what's in the name?

230
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,958
She's a friend, and she's your neighbor too.

231
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,041
Well that doesn't give her right to bathe in my pool.

232
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,375
Can't she bathe in her own pool?

233
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,458
And if still wants to take a bath..

234
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,500
..can't she do it like your mother.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
Your mother completely dressed even in the shower.

236
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,375
And look at her.

237
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,500
Dad, it's a free-country.

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,708
In every country girls spell trouble.

239
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,708
Oh, God! When will he listen?

240
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,166
Moron...you haven't delivered this box to the store yet.

241
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,875
If your mother sees this, she will bury me alive.

242
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,416
Get this to the store immediately.

243
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,166
Dad, stop over-reacting.

244
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,416
And listen to this.

245
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,416
Over-reacting..

246
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,458
What the hell..

247
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,208
Koki's religious songs.

248
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,583
Correct...this house is hell for me.

249
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,583
Koki.

250
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,916
Koki..

251
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,708
What...are you doing, Koki?

252
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,750
These religious songs, and the dance won't get you in heaven.

253
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,375
And if you dislocate a bone, I'll have to call a doctor.

254
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,541
I know..

255
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,208
You want me to break a bone..

256
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,583
..and land in the hospital.

257
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,666
So you can do as you please.

258
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:08,958
Do as I please?

259
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,708
Do as I please?

260
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,041
In 26 years, I only did that once.

261
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,333
The result is sitting up there and playing the guitar.

262
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,250
You know, you keep playing these songs all day.

263
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,166
Someday the counselor will serve us notice..

264
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,083
..and we'll have to evacuate. Get that.

265
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,916
Praveen Patel...I am a Patlani from Mesana.

266
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,041
Getting me out of his house is impossible.

267
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,541
And anyways, this is a free country.

268
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:38,958
Wow!

269
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,833
Wow! Like mother like son.

270
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,708
"It is a free country."

271
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,458
It's free only for you two.

272
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,708
I never got that feeling myself.

273
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,291
Stop grumbling and listen.

274
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,083
There's a live Garba program at the temple tonight.

275
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,666
Come on, Praveen, let's practice Garba.

276
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,208
We'll do Garba all night.

277
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,250
I even brought your favorite dress from the laundry.

278
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,958
You like coming on TV, don't you?

279
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,083
Garba Kokila Jackson Studio.

280
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,125
My dear...spare me.

281
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,291
No Garba for me.

282
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,083
I did it once in 1985...only once.

283
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,958
I still remember that blow to my stomach..

284
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,291
..and it still bothers me every morning.

285
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:24,666
You won't understand my problem. - That reminds me, Praveen.

286
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:29,416
You know...some female will soon enter our family.

287
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,458
What female?

288
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,625
My Jigolo's wife, who else? - Yes.

289
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:42,958
Anyway...I'll have to find a bride for him.

290
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,958
You know, Patel...I am so nice.

291
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,750
Right? - Yes...you are.

292
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,208
Ask the Lord... I am a satisfied soul.

293
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,208
I never demand for anything.

294
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,083
I've a small...miniature wish.

295
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:05,208
My daughter-in-law should be a Gujarati.

296
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,750
Even better if she's from our community.

297
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,708
She must be beautiful, cultured, educated, religious..

298
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,041
..and from a good family.

299
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:22,875
She should be an expert in making Gujarati delicacies.

300
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,750
And I'll teach her the rest.

301
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,708
You know today's generation..

302
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,000
Sorry...sorry..

303
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,333
Why are you laughing?

304
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,750
Is Jigar crazy after someone? - He is.

305
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,250
Naina.

306
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,333
Look, there he is. - Jigolo.

307
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,041
Here.

308
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,625
Have a sweetmeat.

309
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:49,458
Eat it.

310
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,541
I am taking some for Naina.

311
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,000
Jigar, what's this?

312
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,458
It's not mine, its Dad's.

313
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,583
Hey.. - Praveen.

314
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,333
It's not for me Koki, it's for the store.

315
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:08,333
Praveen...if you sell these shameless DVDs..

316
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,666
..then what values will you teach him?

317
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,333
It's just business, Koki. Just business.

318
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,333
And anyway, he never listens to me in the first place.

319
00:19:17,833 --> 00:38:35,583
Here, eat it.

320
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,041
Eat it, son.

321
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,083
Listen. Give those to Murgados.

322
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,583
And tell him I am coming.

323
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,041
I am going.

324
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,916
Don't try to be a hero in front of mom.

325
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,916
Go or I..

326
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,208
Hello, aunty.

327
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,666
How are you?

328
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,625
Very fine, dear.

329
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,583
Black is back, right?

330
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Very smart.

331
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,541
But, is that all you're wearing?

332
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,791
Where's the rest?

333
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,916
Mom? - Sorry, enjoy...enjoy.

334
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,916
Bye, Naina... Na...na...na...na...

335
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,541
Patel. Who eats powder for breakfast?

336
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,333
I'll get you bread and curd. - Let it be.

337
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,791
You won't understand. - I don't want to either.

338
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,916
Listen, do you know any girl of marriageable age?

339
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,000
I do...many. - Who?

340
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,750
But how can I get married again when you're still around?

341
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,000
I meant for Jigar.

342
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,833
So should I look for one?

343
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,708
You can do anything you want, just leave me alone.

344
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,708
Okay.

345
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,500
Finally we're alone.

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,125
Just me and.. - Go take a bath.

347
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
I will.

348
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,458
Koko-dile.

349
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,416
Sorry.

350
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,416
Tonight...I give you my word.

351
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,416
Just me...you and scotch.

352
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,250
Jigar, good morning.

353
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,250
Good morning.

354
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,041
Working.

355
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,333
Hot chic. - She's okay.

356
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,333
My dad's favorite. - I know.

357
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,333
How do you know?

358
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,833
Jigar, are you ready?

359
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,833
Yeah!

360
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,583
Just crazy, dude.

361
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:43,250
It's like Pandora's box.

362
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,833
But why are you showing me this.

363
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,708
Actually, I need a favor.

364
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,791
You're in the music business, right?

365
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,958
And my passion's music as well.

366
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,458
So if someone need's a drummer..

367
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:00,750
..will you please refer my name.

368
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,625
I play the drums really well.

369
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,250
If you're such a good drummer..

370
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,750
..then what are you doing in this store?

371
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,375
Family problem, sir.

372
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,375
I've send money to my mother every month.

373
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,708
Fine...you can play with me in my band.

374
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,291
We'll jam together.

375
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,666
Really? - Yes.

376
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:21,875
Thank you, sir.

377
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,333
I won't let you down. - Okay.

378
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,916
Oh no...sir. - Oh no, dad.

379
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,166
Jigar, leave.

380
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,458
Yeah...one second..

381
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,291
Thank you, sir.

382
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,916
See you in the evening at the jamming.

383
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,916
Hi, dad. - Hey fool, where are you going now?

384
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,875
Jigu, why don't you talk to your parents?

385
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,458
I will. - When?

386
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,708
Once I become a superstar, I will tell everyone.

387
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,208
Even my brother?

388
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,666
He hates you.

389
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,791
He doesn't like you or your music.

390
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:06,541
I see.

391
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,916
Yes. - That's a compliment for me.

392
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,791
And anyway, it doesn't matter whether he likes me or not.

393
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,833
Jigar, why doesn't your mom like me?

394
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,708
Of course she likes you.

395
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,708
I'll talk to her.

396
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,083
When? - Soon.

397
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:25,375
No! Right now.

398
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,416
What happened?

399
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,083
Everyone thinks that you're just fooling around.

400
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,333
You know, baby, that's not true. I love you.

401
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,750
If you love me are you ready to marry me? - Marriage?

402
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,791
Yes. I want to marry you.

403
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,250
I want to have kids.

404
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean I am not saying right now.

405
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,666
But if Rambo finds out that you're serious..

406
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:46,375
..and want to marry me, then maybe..

407
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,708
What the..

408
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,208
Rambo!

409
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,583
There's Rambo. Go talk to him now.

410
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:53,958
I won't talk to him.

411
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,166
Later. I will talk to him later. - Later.

412
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,333
Everything for you comes later.

413
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:58,041
But..

414
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,583
Then you also see me later.

415
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,583
No. - Naina.

416
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,583
Naina, wait.

417
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:14,250
Hey. - Hey, Sam.

418
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,541
Why so furious?

419
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,333
Jigar's lies and false promises. And his fights with Rambo.

420
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,333
I can't take it anymore.

421
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,791
By the way, do you love him?

422
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,416
Of course I love him.

423
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,375
But there are problems in both the family.

424
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,125
What do I do?

425
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,791
Excuse me, why do you need to care about families..

426
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,500
..when you love each other?

427
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,458
Family matters.

428
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,333
Even I am half Indian.

429
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,625
We should value our family.

430
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:44,750
Okay, and what about Jigar?

431
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,208
Well, Jigar...

432
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,208
Naina.

433
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,000
"I wonder what bond I share with you?"

434
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:31,375
"Your face...dwells in my eyes."

435
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:35,625
"I'm right behind you like a shadow."

436
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:41,958
"There's purity in your grace."

437
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:46,000
"I've left my heart at your threshold."

438
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,416
"Whether you hold me or let go."

439
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,458
"Whether you keep me together or break me apart."

440
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,333
"My heart says to me.."

441
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:56,166
"There's someone who loves you."

442
00:26:56,666 --> 00:27:00,166
"I wonder what bond do I share with you?"

443
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,958
"Come closer and let me tell you.."

444
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:30,750
"..I want to you to light up my dreams."

445
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:38,458
"The heart conveys...I am in love with you."

446
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,750
"I can't take my eyes off you."

447
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,666
"My heart's being stubborn as well."

448
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,041
"Whether you hold me or let go."

449
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,250
"Whether you keep me together or break me apart."

450
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,833
"My heart says to me.."

451
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,875
"There's someone who loves you."

452
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:01,875
"I wonder what bond do I share with you."

453
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,208
"Now I am wherever you are."

454
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:49,416
"Your lanes are where I want to be."

455
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:57,083
"I feel like our bond is older than the moon."

456
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:01,166
"Without you...even my breath seems like a burden."

457
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:06,458
"Do me a favor and just say yes."

458
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,625
"Whether you hold me or let go."

459
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,583
"Whether you keep me together or break me apart."

460
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,541
"My heart says to me.."

461
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:16,208
"There's someone who loves you."

462
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:20,208
"I wonder what bond I share with you?"

463
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,833
Ma'am may I come in. - Yes.

464
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,791
Yes, ma'am.

465
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,083
Did you book the ticket for Kuala Lumpur? - Yes, ma'am.

466
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,750
Ma'am, Mac Mohanta sir is here.

467
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,166
We need to finalize dates for his movie.

468
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,541
Shall I call him in? - Yes.

469
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:07,541
Thank you.

470
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,750
Hello. - Please, come in.

471
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,833
So...are you ready for this, Shanaya?

472
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,916
This is a non-glamorous role.

473
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,250
But your character..

474
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,291
No one has done a role like this in Hollywood or Bollywood.

475
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,041
I am so ready.

476
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,833
I do have the looks to work for a director like you.

477
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,916
But...I am ready to show talent.

478
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:44,666
Great.

479
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,125
So the next time I see you is in Kuala Lumpur?

480
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,333
What is the show you're doing in Kuala Lumpur?

481
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,333
It's a reality show.

482
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,041
Valentine's Day special.

483
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,583
Guess what?

484
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,958
I am the prize.

485
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,583
Really? - Yes.

486
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,375
Anand. - Yes, ma'am.

487
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:06,458
Show him the poster. - Yes.

488
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,708
Great!

489
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,708
Fantastic.

490
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:22,791
Win a date with a Diva on Valentine's Day.

491
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,750
I can't believe it. Can you believe it?

492
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,458
No, sir? - Hey...take your hands off.

493
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:28,958
What are you doing?

494
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,875
She's like your sister-in-law. - Sorry, sir.

495
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,208
Sorry, sir.

496
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,375
Look at her.

497
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,916
What a face.

498
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,291
What eyes.

499
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,916
What lips...

500
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:50,541
What figure. - Sir, even you have a nice figure.

501
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,166
What...what do you mean?

502
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:52,666
No, sir.

503
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,583
All the heroes in my hometown look like you.

504
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,541
Completely round.

505
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,250
Yes, sir.

506
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,250
Keep the poster down, and get out. - Okay, sir.

507
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:02,750
Okay, sir.

508
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,750
Okay, sir.. - Figure..

509
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,041
Good day, sir.

510
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:12,041
Good day, ma'am.

511
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:24,333
This is my chance.

512
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,875
Maybe my last chance.

513
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,041
My dream can finally come true.

514
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:36,916
I will have to win this contest.

515
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:43,166
I love you, Shanaya. I love you a lot.

516
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,458
That would be 68.

517
00:32:45,958 --> 01:05:31,708
Yes.

518
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,458
Muru..

519
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,333
Sorry, myself Praveen Patel.

520
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,875
PP. Enjoy.

521
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,375
I am going. - Where, sir?

522
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,041
What do you care? - Right, sir.

523
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,000
You're the boss, sir. - Yes, I am boss.

524
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,000
Give me the money.

525
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,541
Goodbye, sir.

526
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,750
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry,

527
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,250
Why did you take so long? - Rambo was at home.

528
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,375
S*** him.

529
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,166
And why didn't you answer your phone?

530
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:27,750
I'll do as you say.

531
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,666
But first marry me. - Yes, I will.

532
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,125
You promised that we'll get married on this Valentine's Day.

533
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,083
Yes. I will.

534
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,833
But.. -But what?

535
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,250
Naina, I love you okay.

536
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,416
But first I want to be someone.

537
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:45,958
I want to make money.

538
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,750
Enough to buy you everything you like.

539
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,416
Cars...clothes...jewelry...

540
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:55,708
And everything. Okay.

541
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,458
Continue.

542
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,041
I want to give you all the happiness in the world.

543
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,916
And my mother's love too.

544
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,791
And your dad. - Dad?

545
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:07,125
He's in love with some Bollywood heroine.

546
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,000
What? - Yes.

547
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,750
I saw him the other day. - No.

548
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,791
Box of DVDs.

549
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:15,291
And inside the DVD.. - Jigar. That's your dad.

550
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,666
My dad.

551
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:21,666
What the hell.

552
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,291
Oh s**t.

553
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,458
What's he doing in the mall?

554
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:30,458
I don't know.

555
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,708
He never comes to the mall.

556
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,708
What's he doing in the mall? - I think he's confused.

557
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,583
Good morning, miss. - Yes.

558
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:48,208
Myself PP.

559
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,875
Praveen Patel, I have an appointment.

560
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,875
You need one.

561
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,875
Roberto. Your 3 o'clock is here.

562
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,000
Please, have a seat.

563
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,000
I know...I need one.

564
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,958
Indian!

565
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,041
Yes.

566
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:26,000
No, Indian. Only Italiano.

567
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,125
I get it.

568
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,125
There's a pizza stuck in your antenna.

569
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,000
What?

570
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,583
Welcome.

571
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,875
Haircut. - Yes, hair.

572
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,875
Roberto!

573
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:51,500
Hello, darling. I am Roberto.

574
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,791
Who are you?

575
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:57,583
What is there on your head? - Myself PP.

576
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:58,791
Praveen Patel.

577
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:05,708
And this is...45 years of money saving hair-cut.

578
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:10,041
Come, it's time to give you a new makeover.

579
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,625
Yes, yes, will do.

580
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,916
Superb, huh!

581
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:20,666
He...speak in Hindi? - Hindi.

582
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:26,208
No, Italiano. - English...little.

583
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:30,291
Okay, start now.

584
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:33,875
Ooh...your follicles are frocking my fingers.

585
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,208
You have no idea...how young I am going to make you.

586
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes, you need a complete make-out.

587
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,000
Oops, sorry. Makeover.

588
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh my...God!

589
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,916
"They're scared of their wife, and crazy about Sunny.."

590
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,500
"Day and night, they're on Google.."

591
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,458
He looks younger. - Yeah, but why is he doing this?

592
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:13,250
"They can lie like an expert."

593
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,625
"Make even their son look like his father."

594
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,833
Do you know how expensive this salon is? - How much?

595
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,791
300 for a haircut. - 300.

596
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,250
What?

597
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,125
I still need to buy clothes.

598
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,375
You ripped me off for a haircut, now how do you expect me to buy clothes?

599
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,083
300..

600
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:39,666
"Just do what you're good at."

601
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,041
"Something's definitely wrong."

602
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,458
"Something's definitely wrong."

603
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,750
"Something's definitely wrong."

604
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,750
"Something's definitely...wrong."

605
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,000
Something's definitely not right.

606
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,250
Everything's wrong.

607
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,208
What?

608
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:03,833
What?

609
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:04,958
Nothing, let's go.

610
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,625
Where? - Home.

611
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,833
"They're always so confused, a big miser."

612
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,458
"He's spent so much money, everyone's confused."

613
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:18,000
"I'm like a hot sweetmeat, and he's like and old fritter."

614
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,250
"I know he's a bit lazy, but he's also crazy in her love."

615
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,833
"He's fooling everyone only for a kiss."

616
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,125
"Let it happen.."

617
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,416
You understood right,

618
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,083
I am going in his room.

619
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,458
You stand at the window. And as soon as you see him, give me a call, okay?

620
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,333
Okay, baby.

621
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,125
Come on.

622
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,708
"Something's definitely...wrong."

623
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,041
Call me. - Okay. .

624
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:45,250
"Something's definitely...wrong."

625
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,250
Mom.

626
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:05,458
Mom.

627
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,250
Jigar.

628
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,250
Jigar.

629
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,000
Koki. Koki.

630
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,333
Koki.

631
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:52,333
Koki..

632
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,875
"My heart's crazy for you."

633
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:31,041
"What's wrong with my heart since I'm in love."

634
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,708
"What's wrong with my heart since I'm in love."

635
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:40,166
"You're my madness, you're my love."

636
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:44,166
"It's you."

637
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,625
I guess I am drunk.

638
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,833
Who's going to help me?

639
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,833
I will...help you.

640
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:29,458
Shanaya...right before my eyes.

641
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:33,916
Shall we begin? - Yes.

642
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,041
Your name.

643
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:40,958
Your name. - Praveen..

644
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,166
PP.

645
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,833
And your age.

646
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,333
Whatever you feel's right.

647
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:54,416
Actually...I am just 35.

648
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,041
You look like you're 45.

649
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:00,875
Fine...it's neither you nor me.

650
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,583
Let's finalize on 40, right?

651
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,875
Naughty at 40!

652
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,166
Will do?

653
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:12,000
And...sex?

654
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,708
Yes...will do.

655
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:15,666
Why not?

656
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,458
Stupid... Male or Female?

657
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:24,750
Stupid! You know Gujarati?

658
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,750
I do. - Me too.

659
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,250
Amazing.

660
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,708
They say...one should look in the eye while talking.

661
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,458
Not somewhere else. - Yeah.

662
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:47,833
Sorry.

663
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,041
My eyes slipped a little below.

664
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,833
Sorry.

665
00:42:55,333 --> 00:43:01,791
Tell me...what about 'that'?

666
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,458
That? - Yeah.

667
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,458
I'm putting in all this effort for 'that'.

668
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:12,375
Not 'that'...I mean marriage. - Sorry.

669
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,583
I didn't.

670
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:20,291
I am a bachelor forever and ever my love.

671
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:21,250
Who is it?

672
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,500
Who is it?

673
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,541
Who is it?

674
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,166
You?

675
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:27,041
Yes, Naina.

676
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,125
The old man is home.

677
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:30,333
The old man is home.

678
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,166
Yes, I know the old man's at home.

679
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:33,250
Would you like to talk to him?

680
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,000
Old man?

681
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,583
Old man who?

682
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:40,541
Was your uncle here? - You.

683
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:45,000
This latest shirt and new haircut doesn't make you look young.

684
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,166
Get real!

685
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,583
First tell me...what are you doing here?

686
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,250
Spying. - On who?

687
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,625
You. - Why?

688
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:58,625
I've seen and heard everything, dad.

689
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,916
Dad.

690
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:22,750
Stop it, dad, are you going to finish the bottle? - Yes, so?

691
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,750
I will finish the entire bottle, so?

692
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:39,750
A man and his bottle stay together forever.

693
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,416
Understood?

694
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:41,125
You didn't?

695
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,708
Let me explain.

696
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,791
Which bottle do you get when you're born?

697
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,458
Speak up?

698
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,000
Milk bottle. - Right, milk bottle.

699
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,166
Remember.

700
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,750
After that, which bottle do you get at school?

701
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,375
Come on.

702
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,708
Water bottle.

703
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:00,875
Yeah.

704
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,666
Then, when you're a grown up...it's the beer bottle.

705
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,166
Which you drink, I know.

706
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:12,583
After that...once you're married, it's the whiskey bottle.

707
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:18,958
And after you're dead, it's the bottle of holy water.

708
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,375
Get it.

709
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,125
It's a deep bond.

710
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,666
Whether anyone else stays with you or not..

711
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,583
..but the bottle will never leave you.

712
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,166
Understood.

713
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:34,166
My tall-legged son.

714
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:43,208
Dad, stop it now. You're drunk.

715
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:47,208
What...

716
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:52,458
Will you hear the tragedy of my life? - Tell me.

717
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,375
Don't misunderstand me.

718
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:05,791
You see...Koki has a clear heart.

719
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:15,500
But she's only interested in praying, worshipping, saints..

720
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,208
..her crab-dance...and her mixed vegetables.

721
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:26,750
Other than that, she isn't interested in anything else.

722
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,833
Shanaya...is my dream girl.

723
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,541
She's my dream girl.

724
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:40,125
I want to spend one...only one day with her.

725
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:45,541
So that I can live my dream.

726
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:46,833
I don't like this, dad.

727
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,583
This doesn't suit you.

728
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:50,916
And I love mom. I don't want her to get hurt.

729
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:57,375
Hey...even I love my Koko-dile.

730
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:02,166
I'll never do anything to hurt your mother.

731
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,083
I promise you.

732
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,500
You won't listen, will you?

733
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,500
Promise.

734
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,166
Koko-dile.

735
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:24,250
Years later I'm watching father and son together.

736
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,083
Thank you O great one.

737
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:30,375
He's my son, who else do you expect to see me with?

738
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:31,500
Correct.

739
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,625
Listen up.

740
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,083
Babaji has predicted that..

741
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,833
..soon some lady will be entering our family.

742
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,250
And she's your destiny.

743
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,250
Yes, I know. It's Naina.

744
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,541
Yes, mom. It's naina.

745
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,375
I'll talk to her. - What?

746
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,541
You shut up.

747
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,125
Naina can't be a part of this family, son.

748
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,541
She isn't a bad girl, she's nice.

749
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,791
But there's a big difference in our lifestyle and hers.

750
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,333
She can't adjust. - Mom, she will manage.

751
00:47:58,833 --> 00:47:59,250
Trust me.

752
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,583
She won't, you trust me.

753
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,791
Dad, say something okay.

754
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:07,250
Fine, you two go out...let me think something.

755
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:07,750
Go on.

756
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:08,833
Thinking won't help.

757
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,708
Keep thinking...but not Naina.

758
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:14,708
Dad, you better take care.

759
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,791
Pen.

760
00:48:58,958 --> 00:48:59,958
Congratulations.

761
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,833
Same to you, sir.

762
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:08,000
Shanaya, remember one thing.

763
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,875
I will be your best friend off set.

764
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,375
But on the set, I am a professional.

765
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,083
And I expect the same from you. - You won't be disappointed, sir.

766
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,416
I am sure I won't.

767
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,750
And remember.

768
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,541
If you really want to give life to this character..

769
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:30,541
..then you must live in a middle-class Gujarati family.

770
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,375
Only then will you be able to do justice to this role.

771
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:35,166
Okay.

772
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:36,875
Great.

773
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,875
Let's have a photo.

774
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:58,875
Good morning, sir.

775
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,208
You're early today.

776
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,833
This is my store.

777
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,458
I can come whenever I want.

778
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,250
Right, sir.

779
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,416
Very good.

780
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:12,041
Now do as I say, and don't think too much.

781
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,250
Something might break inside.

782
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,875
And just do as I say.

783
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:23,375
Get all the Valentine's Day forms from the other stores.

784
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,375
Okay, sir.

785
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:30,541
Next, take all the forms in our stores.

786
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:35,375
And shred the entire bundle in the shredder.

787
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,083
Don't think... or something might break.

788
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:41,083
Just go.

789
00:50:55,291 --> 00:51:00,541
How can anyone else win when there will be no form left?

790
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,083
So I will win.

791
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:06,000
I love you, Shanaya.

792
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,000
I'll be your hero...and I'm your villain.

793
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,875
Shanaya, my love.

794
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,875
We'll definitely talk in 5 minutes.

795
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:37,458
Hello and welcome to the Vjon presents 'Date with a Diva' contest.

796
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,541
For the first time in television history..

797
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:43,041
..the winner gets a chance to go on a romantic date..

798
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,666
..with his favorite superstar on Valentine's Day.

799
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:47,125
And that superstar is..

800
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:51,458
The stunning, the gorgeous, the reigning queen of Bollywood..

801
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:55,458
Superstar Shanaya!

802
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,625
Welcome to 'Date with a Diva'..

803
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,000
..with yours, truly Shanaya.

804
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:30,416
As you all know, I am waiting for your...call.

805
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:34,375
All that later, first talk to me.

806
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:38,750
You will be my date for Valentine's Day.

807
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,708
Talk to her! Talk to her!

808
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,958
Hello. Hello.

809
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:45,875
Who's that?

810
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,833
How did his call get connected, and not mine?

811
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,083
I think I can't hear you.

812
00:52:53,583 --> 00:53:00,541
I am sorry...I guess we won't meet on Valentine's day.

813
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,541
Get lost...

814
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,583
Hello.

815
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:12,208
Hello.

816
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:16,583
Your name? - What's my name?

817
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,916
Praveen Patel!

818
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,208
What kind of a name is Praveen Patel?

819
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,708
Such a rotten name.

820
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,916
One should think twice before suggesting a name..

821
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,083
..it comes with an expiry date.

822
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,416
Hello.

823
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:40,250
Can you hear me? - I can even hear your heartbeat.

824
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,541
How sweet.

825
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,458
You haven't told me your name yet.

826
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,541
What's in the name, Shanaya?

827
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,125
You can call me anything you want.

828
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,333
If you're Shanaya, I am radish.

829
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:57,625
If you're a kite, I am your solar cell.

830
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,916
If you're a bull, I am the bell.

831
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:04,666
No...I am the bull..

832
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,916
Sorry...I fumbled, sorry. - You're so funny.

833
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:12,875
But you will have to tell me your name. - I see.

834
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,458
I've a very outdated name, huh!

835
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:16,583
Don't mind.

836
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:20,458
If you don't like it, I'll change it.

837
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,916
My name is PP.

838
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:25,541
Okay, Mr. PP.

839
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,875
Are you ready to play a game?

840
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:31,208
Can I ask you a question? - Yes.

841
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:34,250
My first question..

842
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,708
What if I wasn't an actress?

843
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:43,125
Third world war. - What?

844
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,666
Look...

845
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,708
If you hadn't been so gorgeous, you wouldn't be an actor.

846
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,208
And if you wouldn't have come on television.

847
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:54,208
And then people like me wouldn't have fallen in love with you.

848
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:59,750
And without love, I would've joined the army out of frustration.

849
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,250
And thousands of youngsters like me..

850
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,416
..would've joined their army out of frustration.

851
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:06,541
Think about it.

852
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:12,541
If so many frustrated people, join the army in their country..

853
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:15,541
..it could only lead to the third world war.

854
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:16,833
Oh my, God!

855
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:20,166
Your line of thinking is really unique.

856
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,333
I can never think like that.

857
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,250
Don't think, Shanaya. Don't think.

858
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,500
Just ask the next question and make me win.

859
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,916
Okay, PP, my last question.

860
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:37,333
If I don't go on a date with you, then what?

861
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:40,208
End of the world. - What?

862
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,750
Let me explain.

863
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:47,000
If I can join the army and start a Third World War..

864
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,208
..even though I don't know you.

865
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:52,375
So you can imagine, after knowing you, and talking to you..

866
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:56,833
..if I don't get to meet you, what am I capable of doing.

867
00:55:57,333 --> 00:56:00,708
Third World War is a small thing, I can annihilate the entire planet.

868
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:01,333
Oh...

869
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:04,291
Shanaya, please don't mind, but..

870
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:07,208
..you will have to go on a date with me.

871
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,875
Not for me, not for yourself...

872
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,125
But, for the future of this planet.

873
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:18,208
For the future of small, innocent kids.

874
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,500
For the betterment of the entire human race..

875
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,291
..you will have to go on a date with me.

876
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:24,125
Please, please...

877
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,208
PP, I've been to every city in the world.

878
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:33,208
But...I never came across anyone like you.

879
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:39,750
But...you haven't seen me yet. - But I will soon.

880
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,583
Because...with your unique answers..

881
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:48,708
..you've won my heart, along with this contest.

882
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,458
You're the winner, PP.

883
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:53,583
Hail Lord!

884
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:57,583
Thank you! Thank you!

885
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,916
Jigolo...your father did a cool Jackson style.

886
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:31,958
Hello. Is PP sir in?

887
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,291
Hello? - Sorry, ma'am.

888
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:39,958
Can I.. - PP sir has won the contest.

889
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,208
Can you please give this to him?

890
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,458
And tell him I came down personally to invite him.

891
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:44,958
Okay?

892
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:48,458
By the way, what's your name? - Murgados.

893
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,333
But you can call me Muru.

894
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:51,666
Okay, Muru.

895
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,791
Thanks for everything. You're so sweet.

896
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:57,791
Bye.

897
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:26,166
Hello, Mr. Patel. - Hi.

898
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:39,708
Sir.

899
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,708
Are you okay?

900
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:49,833
Yes.

901
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:57,208
PP? - Yes

902
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:01,916
Hi. Hi..

903
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:02,750
Sorry.

904
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,083
Hi...Hello..

905
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:08,208
Happy Valentine's Day.

906
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:11,375
But I didn't get anything for you. - So what?

907
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:15,625
No, this is not done.

908
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:19,500
Keep this banana. It's very nutritious.

909
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,208
I don't eat bananas.

910
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:23,791
I see. - I don't like.

911
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,208
Have a seat.

912
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,791
I have my..

913
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:30,791
Oh, sorry.

914
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,583
Can we talk? - Sure.

915
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:41,833
You know how I feel about you.

916
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:45,708
Why don't you tell me how do you find me?

917
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,875
Well...you don't look 40.

918
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:57,875
Yeah, I've always looked older than my age.

919
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,541
Sorry...sorry.

920
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,958
Actually, I am not 40.

921
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,916
It was my birthday yesterday, and I turned 41.

922
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:09,750
Aah...happy belated birthday. - Thank you.

923
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:13,875
If I had known, I would've brought another gift.

924
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:18,083
You're in front of me, what could be a better gift?

925
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:22,541
No one ever made me so happy in 45 years.

926
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:23,875
What? - What?

927
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,791
You said 45. - 45?

928
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:27,583
Yes.

929
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:32,333
Yeah...I mean 4 to 5. - Oh.

930
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,250
4 to 5...

931
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,208
No one ever made me so happy in the last 4 to 5 years.

932
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,875
You know, PP.

933
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,458
The other day, when we were talking on the phone..

934
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,791
..you only talked about me.

935
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:49,000
Today I want to talk about you. - Me?

936
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,833
Yes. I want to know everything.

937
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,833
Your hobbies, your interests...what do you like.

938
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:05,375
Forgive me...but the truth is..

939
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:11,416
..you're my hobby, you're the one I am interested in.

940
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:13,958
Do you like films? - Yes.

941
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,791
You know, PP, that day when we were talking on the phone..

942
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,625
..I realized you've a writer's mind.

943
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:23,833
Really? - Yeah.

944
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:28,833
Can you help me with my film's story?

945
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,458
Yes, why not.

946
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,708
By the way, I've made-up many stores.

947
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:38,916
I need to cook-up lies for Kokila.

948
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:39,833
Who's Kokila?

949
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,916
Who's Kokila? Kokila, who?

950
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:43,333
Who's Kokila?

951
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,041
I was talking about my mother.

952
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,208
We address our mother as Kokila.

953
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:49,125
Kokila.

954
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,458
By the way, my mother's name is Rama.

955
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,416
And where is she? - She passed away.

956
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:58,208
Two years ago... due to a heart attack.

957
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,125
So sad.

958
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,958
By the way, I love such families.

959
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:06,541
You know...mom, dad, brother, sister..

960
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:07,958
Complete family.

961
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:12,000
Who's in your family?

962
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,291
Problem!

963
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:16,416
The old lady's already dead.

964
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,333
I'll have to lie about the old man now.

965
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:21,333
What?

966
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:26,083
Like I said...my mother passed away..

967
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:27,958
..but, my father's still alive.

968
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:32,541
I live with my father.

969
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:39,333
'If you really want to give life to this character..'

970
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:44,791
'..then you must live in a middle-class Gujarati family.'

971
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:48,791
'Only then will you be able to do justice to this role.'

972
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,083
PP. - Yes.

973
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:40,916
Do you want me to be a big star? - Yes, of course.

974
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:45,208
You know, only you can make me a star.

975
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,666
Me? - Hmmm.

976
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,083
I'm supposed to play the role of a Gujarati housewife.

977
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,083
But honestly speaking..

978
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,625
..I've no experience of any Gujarati family.

979
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,375
I have no one.

980
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,625
And I spent all my childhood in a boarding school.

981
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,541
I grew up away from home.

982
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,333
You know, I never had a family..

983
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:08,541
..which consisted of parents or siblings.

984
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,458
You know, like a proper Indian family. - Yes.

985
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,583
I don't have such a family.

986
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,250
But one man can give me such a family. - Who?

987
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,375
You! - Me?

988
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,625
Yes.

989
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,375
I know it's a little awkward, but..

990
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,458
..can I stay in your house?

991
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,666
You know, to learn about a Gujarati family.

992
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:27,833
You, mother, father..

993
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:31,708
I mean, if you have no objection.

994
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:32,250
You...

995
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,208
You will...

996
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:37,000
You will live in my house?

997
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,000
Objection..

998
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,625
I need an injection, I'm going to faint with happiness.

999
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:43,125
Okay..

1000
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,083
You..

1001
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:49,083
PP...in-out.

1002
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,750
Are you okay?

1003
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,458
I'll come by day after tomorrow.

1004
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,916
We'll stay together for few days. - Yes.

1005
01:04:57,416 --> 01:05:00,333
You, me and.. - And?

1006
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:01,416
Your papa.

1007
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:05,416
My papa?

1008
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,166
This isn't a dream, PP...its reality.

1009
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:48,166
Shanaya's going to stay with you.

1010
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:53,916
What about Koki?

1011
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:57,333
And what about Jigar?

1012
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,333
This is a serious problem.

1013
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:08,041
PP, God doesn't always give an opportunity like this.

1014
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:11,916
Don't let this slip from your hands.

1015
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:13,250
You can do this!

1016
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,958
You can do this!

1017
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:20,958
Now watch what I do?

1018
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,250
Hey...go on.

1019
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,375
Go get popcorn, cold drink and hurry back.

1020
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,291
There's lot of confusion left ahead.

1021
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:35,291
See you...after the break!

1022
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:51,833
Hi. Myself Praveen Patel.

1023
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:55,833
How are you?

1024
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,250
PP! How come you're so early today?

1025
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,875
No, no, you two are late.

1026
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,708
Wait, wait..

1027
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:08,333
Stop.

1028
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:11,000
Hi.

1029
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,583
Why did you two come so late?

1030
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,583
It's alright.

1031
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:25,208
Listen, while I was working out, I..

1032
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,500
I..

1033
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,833
I was thinking...

1034
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,250
The world...

1035
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,333
The world's made of brass.

1036
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:40,583
If there's anything like pure gold, then that's friendship.

1037
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,333
Our friendship.

1038
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:48,416
You see, PP, I'm running low on my bank balance these days.

1039
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:51,833
And...I'm flying to India next week.

1040
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:56,125
If you can wait, I can arrange something next month.

1041
01:07:56,625 --> 01:08:00,083
Hey... How can you think so low?

1042
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:04,083
I want to take you two out for lunch.

1043
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,333
You'll take us out for lunch.

1044
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:12,875
So what's the problem?

1045
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,666
You two are my best friends.

1046
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:20,250
What do you want, PP? - Nothing!

1047
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,625
Fine, I want a small favor. Small one.

1048
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,708
See, Velji. I knew it.

1049
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,958
When PP's too generous..

1050
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:29,541
..it means his shop's in trouble.

1051
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:30,875
It's not like you think. It's not like you think.

1052
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,750
Come on, speak up... what do you want?

1053
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:33,875
What do you want?

1054
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:34,791
Okay, okay.

1055
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,750
Listen.

1056
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:43,833
Somehow we've to get Koko-dile out of the house.

1057
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:50,750
..and one of you has to pose as my father.

1058
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,333
What?

1059
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:53,958
Relax. Relax. Calm down.

1060
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,083
You'll get a heart attack.

1061
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,416
Let me explain, I'll explain everything.

1062
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,416
Listen.

1063
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:30,625
What's going on, papa?

1064
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,916
Are you drunk in the morning?

1065
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,833
Come.

1066
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,958
Oh my.

1067
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,333
Last night, when I was walking alone.

1068
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:45,375
You, alone?

1069
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,625
Don't interfere, I'll cancel your marriage.

1070
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,375
Okay, sorry. Go on.

1071
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,416
Last night, when I was walking alone..

1072
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:59,916
..my heart said to me "PP, you're no longer a young".

1073
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:03,208
That happened 20 years ago, dad.

1074
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,541
Sorry. Sorry. Go on.

1075
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:07,875
Go on.

1076
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:11,416
Continue.

1077
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:15,875
I want to bring a change.

1078
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:21,708
I...want to spend more time with my family..

1079
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:30,166
..with Jigar and his future wife, and with you.

1080
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:36,125
Now...it's time for a change, Koki.

1081
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:46,458
My coarse husband...is sounding sweeter than Shah Rukh Khan today.

1082
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,625
These pointy hairs like Sanjay Dutt.

1083
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,541
The colorful Himesh Reshamiya shirt.

1084
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:53,708
And..

1085
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,583
Red shoes?

1086
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,541
Fine, fine. I am very happy.

1087
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:01,875
It's all babaji's blessings. - Babaji?

1088
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,583
Koki... - Compulsory.

1089
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:09,708
Hold on. - Okay

1090
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,250
Koki. - Yeah.

1091
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,291
Get me some water. - Now?

1092
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:19,333
Please. - I'll get it.

1093
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:20,958
Who is it, dad?

1094
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,958
Why don't you... mind your own business.

1095
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,791
Hello. - Hi, PP.

1096
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,541
I hope I'm not disturbing you, right?

1097
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:39,541
What are you saying?

1098
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,875
You can never disturb me.

1099
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,958
If you don't call me, I'll get disturbed.

1100
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:49,583
Please...don't be so formal with me.

1101
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,625
Treat me like a buddy.

1102
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:54,041
PP, you're such a darling.

1103
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:59,416
I called because.. I'll come on Saturday, not Sunday.

1104
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,250
It won't be a problem, right?

1105
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,041
What are you saying?

1106
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,958
Of course you can come, this is your home.

1107
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:11,416
Why Saturday, you can come today.

1108
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:18,250
Give me an hour, I'll call you and confirm it.

1109
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,250
Okay, PP. - Bye.

1110
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,000
I'll call Velji.

1111
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,583
Moron, what's your problem?

1112
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,625
You're always sneaking up on me..

1113
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:41,333
..either from inside the cupboard, or from behind the door.

1114
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,666
Are you my son or black-money?

1115
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,750
Who were you calling home?

1116
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,083
The stray-animal catches.

1117
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:52,083
They must be on their way, better hide.

1118
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:09,458
Oh Lord..

1119
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:15,166
Patel.

1120
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:20,208
It's 11 o'clock.

1121
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,833
Hello. Hello.

1122
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,833
What hello...I made the call.

1123
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:28,750
Mansukh bhai.

1124
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,750
How are you? All okay?

1125
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,083
Keep speaking.

1126
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,208
What?

1127
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:36,375
Shanti Bai is serious.

1128
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,416
You're serious about Shanaya.

1129
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:40,166
Your grandma.. - Grandma!

1130
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,791
She isn't dead yet. She isn't dead.

1131
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:45,166
She's just serious. - I see, give me the phone.

1132
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,208
Hold on, I am talking to him.

1133
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:50,083
Yes, go on.

1134
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:51,625
What?

1135
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,541
She's only got few days to live.

1136
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:55,083
Shanaya's going to be your guest.

1137
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:56,875
Jigar's marriage.

1138
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,708
What is she saying?

1139
01:13:59,208 --> 01:13:59,958
Her last wish!

1140
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:01,875
You're wish.. - What is she saying?

1141
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,875
Get Jigar married with Naina. - What?

1142
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:04,541
Yes.

1143
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:08,125
Koki and I will fly down tomorrow morning.

1144
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:09,750
Only Koki.

1145
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:10,708
Why?

1146
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,541
Give me the phone.

1147
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:16,333
Okay...here talk to Koki. Talk to Koki.

1148
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:17,541
Here. Here.

1149
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,166
Hello.

1150
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,916
Hello.

1151
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,875
Why can't I hear anything? - Give it to me.

1152
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:24,791
It's a trunk call.

1153
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:26,625
And you know you're going deaf. - Yeah.

1154
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:27,250
Yes..

1155
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,958
Hello. - Pervert, why did you give the phone to her?

1156
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:34,416
Listen...I'll send Koki for Mumbai tomorrow morning.

1157
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:39,083
She'll take a train after she lands, and see you in three days.

1158
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:40,458
Fine, I'm hanging up.

1159
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,625
Yeah.

1160
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:46,000
Granny. Poor granny.

1161
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,708
Poor thing's worried about Jigar's marriage..

1162
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,541
..even when she's on her deathbed. - Yes..

1163
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:50,833
But you.. - Yeah.

1164
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,583
Malindo.. - He's doesn't care.

1165
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:53,791
Be quiet.

1166
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,708
Malindo, tomorrow morning first flight booking.

1167
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,333
Mumbai.

1168
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,000
Thank you.

1169
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:00,958
Jigar.

1170
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:02,750
Jigar!

1171
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,333
Mom has to leave for Mumbai tomorrow.

1172
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,541
Help her pack, I'll go get the ticket.

1173
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,083
Get the red bag. - Yeah!

1174
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,208
Get it from the top shelf.

1175
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,708
She isn't dead, she's just serious.

1176
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:12,333
She isn't dead.

1177
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,125
Yea, but I will have to pack, right? - Okay.

1178
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,333
Get it. - Okay.

1179
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:19,208
Gomyo, we go to airport... hurry..

1180
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,625
Listen, Jigar. - Yes.

1181
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,291
Take care of the house. Take care of your papa.

1182
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,416
And remember...

1183
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,958
I'll get a gorgeous wife for you from Mumbai.

1184
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,791
But, you just stay calm. - Mom, just go. - Okay.

1185
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:33,125
Hail Lord, son. - Hail Lord.

1186
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:36,666
Hail, Lord. Gomyo, let's go.

1187
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:37,583
Hey, Jigar.

1188
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,166
Are you excited? - Of course I am excited.

1189
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,958
Europe trip. Pre-honeymoon.

1190
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,625
But...how did you convince dad? - I didn't.

1191
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,875
In fact, he said...go take a trip to Europe.

1192
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,125
Very unlike him. - I know, but who cares.

1193
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,333
Mom's left already.

1194
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,375
We're leaving too.

1195
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,458
And dad's all alone.

1196
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:02,791
Naina...I'll call you in a minute.

1197
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:06,083
0kay.

1198
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,208
Dad.

1199
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,625
Dad.

1200
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,916
You'll be alone the entire week, right? - Yes, so.

1201
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:13,458
And where's Shanaya?

1202
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:15,250
Sitting on my lap.

1203
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,791
Don't you see her?

1204
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,458
Why are you asking about Shanaya?

1205
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:22,458
Don't you want to leave? Get lost.

1206
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:31,291
You know...PP can't be so lucky. - What do you mean?

1207
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:36,875
We filled the contest forms as well. - Right?

1208
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:42,541
And what did PP say? He'll submit our forms personally.

1209
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:43,708
Right.

1210
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,916
But he didn't submit our forms at all. - Oh, God!

1211
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:49,916
And he won.

1212
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:51,208
Yes, you're right.

1213
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:55,083
I'll have to do something now. - Velji.

1214
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:56,875
Don't do anything absurd.

1215
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:01,791
Praveen is our childhood friend.

1216
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,083
Nothing absurd...

1217
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,708
This time...I'll teach him a good lesson.

1218
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:13,291
I mean...PP will have to pay for his sin.

1219
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:17,291
What?

1220
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,833
Yes, my soon to-be father.

1221
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:31,500
You see, PP, I can't pose as your father.

1222
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,875
What?

1223
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:38,000
You see... I can't deceive sister-in-law.

1224
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,791
Are you crazy?

1225
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,916
I clearly told Shanaya that I live with my father..

1226
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:44,416
..that's the reason she's coming over.

1227
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:47,166
But.. -Bye, bye.

1228
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:51,166
Hello.

1229
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:59,333
What the..

1230
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:05,541
Your plan's failing, PP.

1231
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,000
Think.

1232
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,000
Think. Think. Think.

1233
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:23,208
Yes. - Is it possible for you to keep quiet for a while?

1234
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:26,166
It would be very helpful.

1235
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:29,291
It looks so easy in films.

1236
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:32,708
One man...playing two roles.

1237
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,708
Why not in real..

1238
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,375
Hi, dad.

1239
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,375
Thanks, best gift ever.

1240
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,791
Happy? - Yeah.

1241
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:58,333
Sometimes too much happiness isn't good.

1242
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,708
It can cause a heart attack.

1243
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,333
You aren't going anywhere. - What?

1244
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:08,208
I am going. - I said you're not going.

1245
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:09,375
But, dad..

1246
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,125
Naina will slaughter me.

1247
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,500
You can't do this with me.

1248
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,791
Listen to me. Listen to me. - I won't.

1249
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:18,000
Hold on. Hold on. - No.

1250
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,000
Just listen. Hold on. Listen to me.

1251
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,125
Yes, that's more like it. - Hold on.

1252
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,583
If you try to get fresh with Shanaya..

1253
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:41,291
..and cheat on my mother..

1254
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,541
Swear on your mother, that..

1255
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:47,458
..you won't break my mother's heart. - Yes.

1256
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:50,250
I won't do anything like that. I promise.

1257
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,166
Okay, dad. I'll be your father.

1258
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:56,541
But...I've got three conditions. - Tell me.

1259
01:19:57,041 --> 01:20:00,208
No 1. You will promote my rock band.

1260
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:00,875
Done.

1261
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,583
No. 2. Get me married to Naina.

1262
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:04,250
Done.

1263
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:08,333
And no.3; if I am going to be your father, Naina will be your mom.

1264
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:12,333
Are you crazy? I'll slap you.

1265
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:24,166
Hi, Teddy. I was waiting for your call.

1266
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:28,583
I need to do an experiment. - Experiment.

1267
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,916
With me. How exciting.

1268
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:32,708
By experiment I mean...

1269
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,333
..you've to make my son look like my father.

1270
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:36,916
What?

1271
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,291
I am in a fix.

1272
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,000
What do I tell her?

1273
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,458
Naina.

1274
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:44,916
Tea? Coffee? - What now?

1275
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:47,833
Breakfast...food...anything.

1276
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:51,750
What do you two want?

1277
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,958
You say it. - You do it.

1278
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,041
No, you. - No, you.

1279
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:58,583
Listen to me.

1280
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:02,708
Our trip to Europe. - Yeah. So excited.

1281
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:08,041
I know...but, we'll have to cancel that. - What?

1282
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:11,041
Liar! I knew you were going to do this.

1283
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,291
But, listen to me. - Naina, listen to him.

1284
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,791
He wants to say something. - Can I?

1285
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,083
Dad said he'll get us married.

1286
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:23,875
But there's a small condition. - Small.

1287
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,166
What?

1288
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:29,708
You'll have to pose as an old woman.

1289
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:30,708
What?

1290
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,875
It's a good idea.

1291
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,583
Listen to the plan.

1292
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:38,250
Look, Praveen, when I'm done with them..

1293
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,041
..they will look young and beautiful.

1294
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,750
No, no, no. No!

1295
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,333
I want...I want them to look old and ugly.

1296
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:50,333
What?

1297
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,750
Experiment. Secret.

1298
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,208
PP!

1299
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,833
Teddy. PP...Come, Honey.

1300
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,333
Come on in. - Yeah.

1301
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:19,833
Are you ready? - Yeah.

1302
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:24,583
My teddy. - Yes.

1303
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:25,583
Ta-dah!

1304
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,333
"Something's definitely fishy."

1305
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,625
"Something's definitely fishy."

1306
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:32,041
Genius.

1307
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:33,750
"Something's definitely fishy."

1308
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:34,625
Thank you for saying that.

1309
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,750
You..

1310
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,416
Here, take money.

1311
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:43,083
You go. Go.

1312
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,875
Go.

1313
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,875
"Something's definitely fishy."

1314
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,000
Hold on. Wait.

1315
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,666
What are you two doing?

1316
01:22:58,166 --> 01:23:00,333
You can't prance around like this.

1317
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,000
Here.

1318
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,458
Bend over...and walk slowly.

1319
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:05,875
Do it.

1320
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:10,250
Do it.

1321
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:14,250
Bend.

1322
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,458
Thank you so much, sir. - Hey! It's not for you.

1323
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:36,833
Get those in carefully.

1324
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:40,833
You're already late. - Yes.

1325
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,666
Come in.

1326
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:48,333
Muru!

1327
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,666
I'll call you when I need you. Now go in.

1328
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:53,416
Dad, it's only Muru. What difference does it make?

1329
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:58,041
Jigar...I can hear your voice, but where are you?

1330
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:03,125
You fool...wandering soul, I am right here.

1331
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:04,166
Hey...

1332
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:05,833
Don't think too hard.

1333
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,708
And you? Do you want to get me killed?

1334
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,583
She must be on her way. Go inside.

1335
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:13,583
Hey... Come on.

1336
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:39,458
Sir!

1337
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,708
Is this Praveen Patel's house.

1338
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:47,250
Sir! Sir!

1339
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,666
Sir! Sir!

1340
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:51,083
What sir..

1341
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:55,083
Hi.

1342
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:01,416
Shanaya's here. She's here.

1343
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,208
This is for you.

1344
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:04,458
She's here.

1345
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:05,625
Sorry!

1346
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,833
This is for you. - Thank you.

1347
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:10,625
PP.

1348
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,083
Praveen?

1349
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,125
Shall we go inside? - Yeah.

1350
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:15,833
Come in.

1351
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,083
Bring those inside.

1352
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:22,083
Bye.

1353
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:26,375
This is my home.

1354
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:30,375
Muru.

1355
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,708
Shanaya...

1356
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,750
You're looking very nice.

1357
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,833
Really? - Yes, truly.

1358
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:42,833
Praveen, you're so sweet.

1359
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,625
Son, it's time for my nap.

1360
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:57,458
And what are you up to?

1361
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:01,250
This...is Shanaya, our guest.

1362
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,083
And he's my father.

1363
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:09,291
Hello, uncle. - Hello.

1364
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,791
You're very beautiful.

1365
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:13,625
Praveen's papa...

1366
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,250
Your milk's kept in your room.

1367
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,750
You won't like it if it gets cold.

1368
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:25,125
And stop getting so hot at this age.

1369
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:31,500
Otherwise, you won't like what I do with you.

1370
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,541
Father...shall I give you a hand. - I'll go.

1371
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:39,500
Your mom's waiting for me. - Go, go.

1372
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,666
Bye. - Shanaya, that's my mom.

1373
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:45,166
Mom, this is Shanaya.

1374
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:47,958
Hello, aunty. - Hello.

1375
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,625
Breakfast is served at 7:30am sharp.

1376
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:51,875
Be ready.

1377
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:55,666
Now get some sleep.

1378
01:26:56,166 --> 01:27:00,666
You said your mother had a heart attack, and she..

1379
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:04,250
She.. - Yes. I did. I did.

1380
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,583
You see, my mother did get a heart attack..

1381
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:12,416
..but, she didn't die.

1382
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:16,916
PP. You said, you only live with your dad.

1383
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:21,625
Right? - Right.

1384
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,541
I live with my father.

1385
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:27,125
But you see, my mother's never at home.

1386
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:30,333
She stays in her bedroom. She doesn't come out.

1387
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:31,208
Why?

1388
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:32,750
Why?

1389
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,958
The doctor has advised her bed-rest.

1390
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:36,208
Bed-rest?

1391
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:38,583
But, PP, she was just.. - Yes.

1392
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,250
Sometimes she..

1393
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,583
You see, just like commercial breaks on television, she also..

1394
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,083
But let's forget it.

1395
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:49,041
Why are we discussing her?

1396
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,125
Okay, it'll be good for me too.

1397
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,000
Influence. Female influence, right? - Yes.

1398
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,166
PP, where's my room?

1399
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:05,458
You...can sleep in my room. - PP, don't be naughty.

1400
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:09,541
I will sleep alone. - I didn't mean that.

1401
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,416
I meant...you can sleep in my room.

1402
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,916
And I will sleep in the study.

1403
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:20,125
PP...you're so sweet.

1404
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:24,083
But...why are we talking about bed?

1405
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:26,333
I mean...are you in a hurry to get in bed? - No.

1406
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,708
So let's sit and talk. - On the bed?

1407
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:32,333
No, here. Let's sit here. - I see.

1408
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:33,916
Shall we? - Okay.

1409
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,041
Come on.

1410
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,500
Yeah.

1411
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,500
Hold on.

1412
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,250
You? - Bloody useless...what kind of a son are you?

1413
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,291
Your father's standing outside and ringing the bell..

1414
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:57,958
And you're not concerned about him at all.

1415
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,916
No, no..

1416
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,250
What are you posing as? - Your father.

1417
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:07,458
See, see, did you see what kind of a son is he.

1418
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,875
I mean...I'm growing old and he's losing his memory.

1419
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:16,916
Anyways, I am Praveen's father...baby.. - Hold on.

1420
01:29:17,416 --> 01:29:21,708
Come here. I told you no, didn't I?

1421
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,875
I wanted to help you out.

1422
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:27,291
I know why you're here you bloody pervert.

1423
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:28,375
Get out.

1424
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:33,416
Listen, either you let your father stay here..

1425
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:35,708
..or I will call Jigar's mom.

1426
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:37,916
You bloody..

1427
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:42,708
What's happening?

1428
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:46,958
PP talking to papa. - No, no.

1429
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:54,166
PP, your papa.. - Yes.

1430
01:29:54,666 --> 01:29:57,625
He's my second father. - What?

1431
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:00,416
I mean...my adopted father. - What?

1432
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,958
I mean..

1433
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:05,041
Come here.

1434
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:08,125
You see...

1435
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:11,458
He's a distant relative.

1436
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,708
Relative.

1437
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:19,833
And...he separated from his son in a fair. - How sad.

1438
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:25,125
Since then he considers me his son. - So sweet.

1439
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:27,291
So you adopt him too. - What?

1440
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:28,291
I am sorry.

1441
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:31,833
I mean...consider him as a father too.

1442
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,833
He's a nice man.

1443
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:38,750
He won't bite, harmless.

1444
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,208
Okay.

1445
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:43,208
I guess...the bigger the family, better for me.

1446
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:44,375
Yes.

1447
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:47,333
What's that you say in Gujarati? - That?

1448
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:50,041
I mean...those small ones.. - "Thali" Plates.

1449
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:51,083
Right, plates.

1450
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,958
Your family is just like that. - Right.

1451
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:54,791
Gujarati food plate. Exactly like that.

1452
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:56,666
So all fine now? - Yes.

1453
01:30:57,166 --> 01:31:02,041
Okay, father...everything okay.

1454
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:05,333
Hello, uncle.

1455
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,750
You don't call me, uncle.

1456
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,500
You don't call me, uncle.

1457
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,708
You know, I am Praveen's father, not yours.

1458
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:15,666
So you call me Velji, baby.

1459
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:19,083
Father...you must be tired.

1460
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:22,291
Go take some rest. - Yes.

1461
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:26,791
Where's my room?

1462
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:31,000
PP...he doesn't have a room?

1463
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,708
Well...

1464
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,333
The old..

1465
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:39,833
I mean at this old age, he sleeps anywhere.

1466
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:40,791
Really.

1467
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,291
Yesterday morning, I found him in the bathroom.

1468
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:45,791
Didn't I?

1469
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,166
He's right, absolutely right.

1470
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:54,291
But, baby...you see, I feel scared sleeping alone.

1471
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,750
Look here.

1472
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,000
First I will show her, her room.

1473
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,083
Later I will come back and take care of your fears.

1474
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,291
Okay?

1475
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:06,541
Come, Shanaya. Father, stay here.

1476
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:08,166
Bye, baby.

1477
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:12,166
Baby...

1478
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:35,458
Come here.

1479
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:37,333
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1480
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:40,541
PP...I'm doing what you're doing.

1481
01:32:41,041 --> 01:32:43,958
Shanaya watching. - You stupid fool...

1482
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:48,250
My home, my food...my guest...and your heaven?

1483
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:52,375
PP, I just saw, I didn't touch her yet.

1484
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:55,375
Mend your way, Velji.

1485
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:58,833
I asked you to be my father, but what you're doing is a sin.

1486
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:02,000
Chill out, PP.

1487
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,750
Look, she's gone.

1488
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,291
Goodnight. Show over, now go.

1489
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,083
PP...tell me one thing.

1490
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,208
When do you wash the curtains in your room?

1491
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:14,458
Shall I drown you in the swimming pool? - No.

1492
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:15,500
Now go..

1493
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,500
"Curtains..."

1494
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:11,125
"Let me go."

1495
01:34:11,625 --> 01:34:15,458
"Come closer."

1496
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:20,000
"Let me go."

1497
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,208
"Come closer."

1498
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:25,208
"Touch me not."

1499
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:26,125
"Touch me not."

1500
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:27,375
"Touch me not."

1501
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:28,291
"Touch me not."

1502
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,041
"Touch me not."

1503
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,083
"Touch me not."

1504
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,333
"Touch me not."

1505
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:37,625
"Come closer."

1506
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:42,083
"Let me go."

1507
01:34:42,583 --> 01:34:46,458
"Come closer...come...closer."

1508
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:51,083
"Come closer...come...closer."

1509
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:55,083
"Let me go."

1510
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:59,083
"Come closer."

1511
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,000
"Your tresses are raking up a storm."

1512
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:30,708
"Is it the conspiracy of the ambiance...is it a trial?"

1513
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:40,041
"Your tresses are raking up a storm."

1514
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:44,500
"Is it the conspiracy of the ambiance...is it a trial?"

1515
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,666
"It's an intoxication hard to get over."

1516
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:49,166
"It's hard to stop this."

1517
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:53,333
"It's fire on water...and the water's on fire."

1518
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:57,875
"Let me go."

1519
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,958
"Come closer."

1520
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:03,041
"Touch me not."

1521
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:03,958
"Touch me not."

1522
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:05,333
"Touch me not."

1523
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:06,166
"Touch me not."

1524
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:07,708
"Touch me not."

1525
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:08,875
"Touch me not."

1526
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,875
"Touch me not."

1527
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:33,000
"Normally I've an arrogant attitude."

1528
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,875
"Don't worry I've a big heart."

1529
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:51,333
"Normally I've an arrogant attitude."

1530
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:55,625
"You've a very delicate heart."

1531
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,916
"Why are you after me?"

1532
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,875
"Love is a dangerous business."

1533
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:04,375
"Whoever fell in it, always drowned."

1534
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:08,666
"Let me go."

1535
01:37:09,166 --> 01:37:12,666
"Let me go."

1536
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:34,625
Come on, PP. just a few more meters.

1537
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:38,625
Coming, baby.

1538
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:40,666
Come on, you can do it.

1539
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:42,750
Haven't you run before?

1540
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,333
Oh...

1541
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:46,791
Okay.

1542
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:51,791
I am okay. - Good.

1543
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:58,083
PP...considering your age, you're slightly low on stamina.

1544
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:01,041
No, no. I've got stamina.

1545
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:02,916
I wonder what happened to it today?

1546
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:04,875
Last night I had too much.

1547
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:10,875
Normally...I can easily do 5-6 miles.

1548
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,041
Strange.

1549
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:17,041
Usually...I can go on and on and on...all day long.

1550
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:27,416
You go inside, get ready.

1551
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:30,375
We'll meet for breakfast. I'll go talk to them.

1552
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:34,375
Alright, bye.

1553
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,916
Who is that, old chap?

1554
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:41,791
Did you tell him anything? - No.

1555
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:43,166
That's..

1556
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:44,791
That's my friend.

1557
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:48,625
Big Bollywood star. - Get her over for a cup of tea.

1558
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,916
My wife would love her.

1559
01:38:51,416 --> 01:38:51,958
Okay.

1560
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:53,708
Cheers.

1561
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:57,208
PP! - Nothing...happened.

1562
01:38:57,708 --> 01:39:02,125
I was just asking...when is sister-in-law coming back?

1563
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:06,125
Get lost. - Bye, see you.

1564
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,166
Get up! Get up! Get up, you two.

1565
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:20,583
Let us sleep some more, dad. - What sleep?

1566
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:23,083
Shanaya wants to meet you two downstairs.

1567
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:25,000
Quickly make breakfast, Naina, please.

1568
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,958
She's very hungry. Come on, come on, get up.

1569
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:30,666
Breakfast.

1570
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:34,666
Jigs...I don't know how to cook.

1571
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:39,333
It's okay.

1572
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:43,333
You go take a shower, let me think of something.

1573
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:53,833
Should I squeeze it out? - What?

1574
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,708
Juice? - Whose?

1575
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:57,625
This juice.

1576
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:58,833
Oh...

1577
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:02,833
Yes.

1578
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:11,208
Once more, please.

1579
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:14,666
What? - I mean, thank you.

1580
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:18,708
I mean nothing.

1581
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:20,625
I'll take the juice out.

1582
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:24,625
Come quickly, okay.

1583
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,458
Baby...baby...

1584
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:34,458
Show me now, baby. - Father.

1585
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:39,375
I meant...show me whatever you got, baby.

1586
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:43,875
For now see the plate, father.

1587
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:47,875
Thanks, PP.

1588
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:51,500
Sit straight.

1589
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,666
Good morning, aunty. Good morning, uncle.

1590
01:40:54,166 --> 01:40:57,666
Morning.

1591
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:05,750
Uncle, juice. - Yes, why not.

1592
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:15,875
Aunty, can you teach me to cook?

1593
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:19,833
PP said you cook really well.

1594
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:23,833
Her? She'll teach you to cook?

1595
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,958
PP, why are you still sitting there?

1596
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:34,833
Go get some bread, butter, jam and sauce.

1597
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:43,666
Yes, and get me some snacks and the mixed vegetables.

1598
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:45,458
Is that all?

1599
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,291
Why don't I bring the entire kitchen for you two?

1600
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:52,041
PP, stay seated. I'll go get it.

1601
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:53,875
Thank you, mom.

1602
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:56,458
Aunty, shall I come too? - No.

1603
01:41:56,958 --> 01:42:00,458
Relax. You're our guest.

1604
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:09,416
Muru, where are you?

1605
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:11,958
Listen up, come in through the kitchen door.

1606
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:16,250
Okay. Come fast.

1607
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:18,000
Naina. - Muru.

1608
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:22,000
Where were you?

1609
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:33,041
Wow! You cooked food so quickly.

1610
01:42:33,541 --> 01:42:34,375
No, that's Muru..

1611
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:37,250
Mummy's magic.

1612
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,375
Eat, dear.

1613
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:40,625
Take.

1614
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:42,041
Here.

1615
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:46,041
Thank you.

1616
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,541
Aunty, that was fantastic.

1617
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:00,625
Okay, everybody.

1618
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,000
I've to go for my rehearsals.

1619
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,375
So I'll see you guys later, alright.

1620
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:09,041
I'll drop you. - No need.

1621
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:11,500
But, she'll have to show everything now. - What?

1622
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I mean...the direction, the road...I'll have to show all that.

1623
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,083
Old man, control yourself.

1624
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:21,083
Otherwise...I'll direct your life towards heaven.

1625
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:23,041
Even if I'll become an orphan.

1626
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:26,666
Why? I am there. - Oh yes, I forgot.

1627
01:43:27,166 --> 01:43:28,291
I've got two old men.

1628
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:31,125
Buy one get one free!

1629
01:43:31,625 --> 01:43:35,583
PP...be nice. - Oh, sorry.

1630
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:37,541
Come.

1631
01:43:38,041 --> 01:43:41,541
Baby...bye. - Yeah, bye.

1632
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:45,958
Where have you been?

1633
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:47,333
Morning. - Morning.

1634
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,416
How are you? - Nice to see you.

1635
01:43:49,916 --> 01:43:52,041
Vivek, this is Praveen Patel.

1636
01:43:52,541 --> 01:43:53,833
Praveen, this is Vivek. - Hi, Praveen.

1637
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:55,000
Hi. - My costar.

1638
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:58,208
Nice to meet you.

1639
01:43:58,708 --> 01:43:59,083
Shall we? - Shall we?

1640
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,333
Yeah. Please.

1641
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:04,333
See you around.

1642
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:47,833
I love you.

1643
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:51,833
I want to marry you.

1644
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:28,333
Koki, get me a glass of water..

1645
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:31,916
Koki's isn't here.

1646
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:35,916
Koki.

1647
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:43,500
Aren't you two ashamed?

1648
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,500
You just start anywhere.

1649
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,916
And what about what you're doing? - What?

1650
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:58,458
What am I doing?

1651
01:45:58,958 --> 01:45:59,458
What am I doing wrong?

1652
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:01,750
I see...don't you think you're doing wrong.

1653
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,791
Are you trying to teach your father? - Yes.

1654
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:05,750
I will if necessary. - You..

1655
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:09,291
Jigs, calm down. It's only a matter of few days.

1656
01:46:09,791 --> 01:46:11,250
Dad, taste this.

1657
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,500
I made this for you. Mixed vegetables.

1658
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,666
Actually Jigar said it's your favorite.

1659
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:21,666
Jigar..

1660
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:30,625
This tastes just like Koki's..

1661
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:33,166
How did you make it? - Really?

1662
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:34,583
Thank you, daddy.

1663
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:37,375
I found mom's recipe book.

1664
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:40,166
I am so happy that you liked it.

1665
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,500
No just like, I liked it a lot.

1666
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,958
It's really good. - See, dad.

1667
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:46,541
She's not like that Shanaya.

1668
01:46:47,041 --> 01:46:49,000
Shanaya is just a friend.

1669
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,458
Why do you think so much about her?

1670
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,625
Those mixed-vegetables smells superb.

1671
01:46:56,125 --> 01:46:57,583
Come.

1672
01:46:58,083 --> 01:46:58,916
Finish everything.

1673
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:01,041
After that you can eat my furniture.

1674
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:03,500
And f**t all night.

1675
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,208
And you two hurry up and get ready.

1676
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:09,208
She'll be here soon.

1677
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:25,166
Lovely house.

1678
01:47:25,666 --> 01:47:26,541
Looks good.

1679
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:30,125
You have a good time. - Okay, thanks.

1680
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:36,208
Have a nice one. - Bye.

1681
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:40,208
I'll show that rascal what Praveen Patel's made of.

1682
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,958
Hi.

1683
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:54,541
Hi, PP. how was your day? - Busy.

1684
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:58,333
Too many customers in the store, no time for myself.

1685
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:00,250
Very tired also.

1686
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:04,625
And my shoulder's aching too.

1687
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:08,625
What? - Doorbell.

1688
01:48:12,375 --> 01:48:14,416
Oh...Hi, Mike.

1689
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:15,875
Good evening, old chap.

1690
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:16,958
Hello.

1691
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:17,625
Hello.

1692
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:20,625
Praveen. Do you have any news from Naina and Jigar.

1693
01:48:21,125 --> 01:48:22,916
It's been few days, and I haven't heard.

1694
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:26,458
Have a seat. - Thank you.

1695
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:28,583
You must be tired.

1696
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:30,458
Come, I'll help you fresh up.

1697
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:34,708
Come on.

1698
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:40,000
PP. Who are Jigar and Naina? - You don't know them.

1699
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,875
Oh...

1700
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:45,500
PP, what's this? - This is for you.

1701
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,500
Really? - Yes.

1702
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:54,458
So dinner...tonight? - Yes. Of course.

1703
01:48:54,958 --> 01:48:58,458
Then...hold on. Just wait..

1704
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:11,291
For me? - You like? - I love.

1705
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:13,083
Baby

1706
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:16,166
Baby, when did you arrive? - She stays here.

1707
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:17,625
Why do you always drop in here?

1708
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:19,083
She's a guest.

1709
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:20,333
And guest is our God.

1710
01:49:20,833 --> 01:49:23,458
I'll send you to God. You..

1711
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:27,958
You guys, not again. - Sorry. Sorry.

1712
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:32,958
You go ahead and change, I'll deal with the old man.

1713
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:36,958
Come here.

1714
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:40,250
Come on.

1715
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:42,041
Velji?

1716
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:44,541
Is that you? What did you do to yourself?

1717
01:49:45,041 --> 01:49:45,958
You look older.

1718
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:48,750
Yes..

1719
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:52,083
Gas problem.

1720
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:54,083
He'll be fine. It'll not last long.

1721
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:56,708
Jigar and Naina no news.

1722
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,250
When they call, I'll call you.

1723
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:00,666
I'll call you. - Okay.

1724
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:03,541
I'll call you. Bye.

1725
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:05,000
See you, bye.

1726
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:09,458
Safe.

1727
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:13,458
What are you doing down here? - Where else should I be?

1728
01:50:20,791 --> 01:50:22,208
Baby...

1729
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:27,208
Baby...you're looking beautiful.

1730
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:28,666
You like..

1731
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:34,375
You're looking...very nice.

1732
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:38,375
Very, very beautiful.

1733
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:48,166
Aunty, are you fine?

1734
01:50:48,666 --> 01:50:54,666
I am okay...but my husband's about to fall sick.

1735
01:50:55,166 --> 01:51:00,333
Let's go to the room, I'll give you your pill.

1736
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:04,166
Praveen, I'll go take my pills.

1737
01:51:04,666 --> 01:51:07,083
Clear all this up until then.

1738
01:51:07,583 --> 01:51:08,333
Me?

1739
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:12,333
Who else? Your old mother?

1740
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:19,833
Come, darling. Give me my pills.

1741
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:22,250
Baby, why do you wear such big clothes?

1742
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:25,375
Stop it... - Father.

1743
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:31,375
I think...it's time for my meditation, dear.

1744
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:32,791
Bye, baby.

1745
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:37,875
Bye. - Bye, baby.

1746
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,291
PP, don't worry. I'll help you. - No, no.

1747
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:44,291
It's okay.

1748
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:46,833
Dress.

1749
01:51:47,333 --> 01:51:49,833
PP...I've another dress.

1750
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,583
Especially for you.

1751
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:55,583
Okay. - Bye.

1752
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:03,541
Thanks for the lovely dinner.

1753
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:06,125
But, PP, I think I am drunk.

1754
01:52:06,625 --> 01:52:07,416
It's okay.

1755
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:09,375
You enjoyed, didn't you?

1756
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:13,916
But tell me...why didn't you get married?

1757
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:15,916
I..

1758
01:52:16,416 --> 01:52:19,000
I didn't find a girl like you.

1759
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:23,000
PP...don't be silly.

1760
01:52:26,875 --> 01:52:30,375
PP, let's go...inside. - Okay.

1761
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:48,583
"I tried hard...to hide.."

1762
01:52:49,083 --> 01:52:52,583
"But I couldn't stop my eyes."

1763
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:04,041
"I tried hard...to hide.."

1764
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:09,083
"But I couldn't stop my eyes."

1765
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:14,208
"I've given you...the entire universe."

1766
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:19,458
"I've given you...the entire universe."

1767
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:24,666
"But, this is the limit...I'm helpless because of my heart."

1768
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:29,708
"Tell her...I am down with love."

1769
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:33,708
"Tell her...I am down with love."

01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:13,000

01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,625
"Get high and just dance."

1787
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:20,541
"Romance in the open, just dance."

1788
01:55:21,041 --> 01:55:24,541

1790
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:51,416
"The cocktail's strong add more rum."

"Take a sip...enjoy the moment."

1792
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:58,875
"The cocktail's strong add more rum."

1793
01:55:59,375 --> 01:56:02,583
"Seal the night, dim the lights."

1794
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:07,666
"The ambiance is romantic...light the bulb of love."

1795
01:56:08,166 --> 01:56:12,041
"We sway and dance."

1796
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:15,625
"Get high and just dance."

1797
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:19,583
"Get high and just dance."

1798
01:56:20,083 --> 01:56:23,125
"Romance in the open, just dance."

1799
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:27,125
"Get high and just dance."

1800
01:56:36,458 --> 01:56:37,708
"The mood's a bit higher."

1801
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:39,708
"My heart's on fire."

1802
01:56:40,208 --> 01:56:41,291
"It's the body's desire..."

1803
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:45,041
"Seal my lips with yours."

1804
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,000
"The mood's a bit higher."

1805
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,833
"My heart's on fire."

1806
01:56:49,333 --> 01:56:50,625
"It's the body's desire..."

1807
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:52,333
"Seal my lips with yours."

1808
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:54,416
"The heat rises really high."

1809
01:56:54,916 --> 01:56:56,166
"It makes you yearn."

1810
01:56:56,666 --> 01:56:58,083
"The distance troubles me..."

1811
01:56:58,583 --> 01:57:01,083
"Take me in your arms."

1812
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:05,625
"We sway and dance."

1813
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:09,416
"Get high and just dance."

1814
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:13,166
"Get high and just dance."

1815
01:57:13,666 --> 01:57:16,625
"Romance in the open, just dance."

1816
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:20,625
"Get high and just dance."

1817
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:38,458
You guys were amazing.

1818
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:40,625
Thank you. - You know, if you're interested in films..

1819
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:42,541
..I can introduce you to my producer.

1820
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:44,291
What.. - He'll love you guys.

1821
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:47,541
Mr. PP, Shanaya just offered us a Bollywood film.

1822
01:57:48,041 --> 01:57:49,541
What are you doing?

1823
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:52,083
These people don't have any experience.

1824
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:55,791
That's it, they are fresh. And we all want new music.

1825
01:57:56,291 --> 01:57:58,416
I'll give you my manager's number. - Sure.

1826
01:57:58,916 --> 01:58:00,708
Shall we go?

1827
01:58:01,208 --> 01:58:04,458
I have a surprised planned for you.

1828
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:06,541
Okay, guys, I have to go.

1829
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:10,375
PP always has so many surprises for me.

1830
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:11,416
Mr. PP...

1831
01:58:11,916 --> 01:58:15,416
Let's go. - Bye.

1832
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:31,000
Cheers.

1833
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:39,875
What are you looking at, PP? - You.

1834
01:58:40,375 --> 01:58:42,375
You are very beautiful.

1835
01:58:42,875 --> 01:58:46,375
Thank you.

1836
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,291
PP, let's go to the lawn.

1837
01:59:00,791 --> 01:59:03,083
No, Shanaya, listen.

1838
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:05,916
There's something I want to tell you, Shanaya.

1839
01:59:06,416 --> 01:59:08,375
PP...don't say anything.

1840
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:12,791
We're good friends. - Yes. I know, we're good friends.

1841
01:59:13,291 --> 01:59:16,583
But haven't you seen "Kuch Kuch Hota Hain".

1842
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:19,458
Yes, I have. Please, PP, let's go.

1843
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:21,041
Please. - Okay.

1844
01:59:21,541 --> 01:59:25,041
Okay. Okay.

1845
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:13,541
Kokodile! Kokodile!

1846
02:00:14,041 --> 02:00:18,666
Where? - There.

1847
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:19,500
PP.

1848
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
PP. PP.

1849
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:23,458
You're drunk.

1850
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:25,916
Come on, I'll give you a glass of milk.

1851
02:00:26,416 --> 02:00:29,916
There's no one.

1852
02:00:36,583 --> 02:00:40,916
PP...I think we'll call it a night.

1853
02:00:41,416 --> 02:00:43,375
My clothes are drenched...and it's late.

1854
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:46,000
Yes, so...we'll meet tomorrow.

1855
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:52,875
PP, if you see a Kokodile again, don't be scared.

1856
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:53,791
Okay.

1857
02:00:54,291 --> 02:00:57,791
Goodnight.

1858
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:08,000
Stupid fool, how dare you scare your father?

1859
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,541
What if I had had a heart attack?

1860
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:13,250
No, dad. You'll die only because of your actions.

1861
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,916
I saw everything.

1862
02:01:15,416 --> 02:01:18,583
You taking up on the opportunity.

1863
02:01:19,083 --> 02:01:22,458
Can't you watch cricket or football like the other kids?

1864
02:01:22,958 --> 02:01:26,875
Do you have to spy on others?

1865
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:30,458
Did you call Kokila? - No, I didn't.

1866
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:31,833
And anyway, it's quite late now.

1867
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:34,541
I won't call her now.

1868
02:01:35,041 --> 02:01:38,541
So, will you get lost or are you planning on sleeping with me?

1869
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:55,541
Two heart attacks on the same day.

1870
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,083
Kokodile.

1871
02:01:57,583 --> 02:02:00,208
I am really scared of you.

1872
02:02:00,708 --> 02:02:04,208
Hail Lord! Hail Lord!

1873
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:26,041
Kokodile.

1874
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:27,125
Jigar.

1875
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:28,791
Jigar.

1876
02:02:29,291 --> 02:02:31,166
Jigar.

1877
02:02:31,666 --> 02:02:33,458
Come here.

1878
02:02:33,958 --> 02:02:35,750
Dad, what's wrong?

1879
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:39,750
Dad!

1880
02:02:41,125 --> 02:02:41,583
Two Kokodile.

1881
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:44,000
Two Kokodile. Slap me, Jigar. I am dreaming.

1882
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,000
Two Kokodile. Look.

1883
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,000
Dad, relax.

1884
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,333
That's Naina and Shanaya.

1885
02:02:49,833 --> 02:02:53,333
Naina and Shanaya? - Yes, look.

1886
02:02:55,833 --> 02:02:56,958
Naina and Shayana? - Yes.

1887
02:02:57,458 --> 02:02:59,291
Garba.. - And I talked to mom,

1888
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:03,291
she's still in the village.

1889
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:34,083
Babaji!

1890
02:03:34,583 --> 02:03:40,958
Listen...eat some offerings.

1891
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:44,958
Baby.

1892
02:03:54,666 --> 02:03:57,708
Who is she? - She..

1893
02:03:58,208 --> 02:04:01,666
She's my sister, your aunt.

1894
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:06,000
Jigna Odumbe Tikolo from Kenya.

1895
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:10,375
No!

1896
02:04:10,875 --> 02:04:14,375
He's PP. Praveen.

1897
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:23,333
Velji, why did you bring her here?

1898
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:25,458
How many more people are you going to bring in my home?

1899
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:32,875
PP, I told dad that I want to learn Gujju dance.

1900
02:04:33,375 --> 02:04:35,791
And he said his sister's a choreographer..

1901
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:38,125
..and she just arrived from Kenya.

1902
02:04:38,625 --> 02:04:39,583
She will teach me.

1903
02:04:40,083 --> 02:04:41,750
And she's the best, darling.

1904
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,125
If you say so?

1905
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:48,750
By the way, you're looking really nice. - Very nice.

1906
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:52,791
Thank you, PP. By the way, this is for my role.

1907
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:56,791
What are you doing?

1908
02:05:00,541 --> 02:05:04,041
Jackpot! Jackpot!

1909
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:20,000
Behave yourself.

1910
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:21,958
Have a banana.

1911
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:25,833
Why are you staring like this?

1912
02:05:26,333 --> 02:05:27,541
Okay. Bye, PP.

1913
02:05:28,041 --> 02:05:31,250
See you at lunch? - Yes, 1 o'clock.

1914
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,083
La Boutega.

1915
02:05:33,583 --> 02:05:35,291
Bye.

1916
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:39,291
Just look at him.

1917
02:05:44,583 --> 02:05:48,208
Praveen. Clean this in the washing machine.

1918
02:05:48,708 --> 02:05:49,791
See you for lunch.

1919
02:05:50,291 --> 02:05:51,333
1 o'clock, at La Boutega.

1920
02:05:51,833 --> 02:05:55,333
Bye.

1921
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:14,166
What happened? - Nothing, sir.

1922
02:06:14,666 --> 02:06:16,500
What's this? - Letter, sir.

1923
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,333
Whose is it? - Mine.

1924
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:23,291
So you take it. - It's for you.

1925
02:06:23,791 --> 02:06:25,791
Make up your mind, yours or mine?

1926
02:06:26,291 --> 02:06:30,125
Sir, I wrote this letter for you.

1927
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:33,166
Hey...just tell me what's wrong.

1928
02:06:33,666 --> 02:06:37,291
Actually, this is my resignation letter. - What?

1929
02:06:37,791 --> 02:06:41,875
I am quitting this job and joining the band, as a drummer.

1930
02:06:42,375 --> 02:06:44,375
You..

1931
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:46,625
Are you crazy?

1932
02:06:47,125 --> 02:06:48,958
You want to be a drummer.

1933
02:06:49,458 --> 02:06:50,458
You have such a nice job.

1934
02:06:50,958 --> 02:06:52,958
You get paid at the end of every month.

1935
02:06:53,458 --> 02:06:53,958
You have a good boss.

1936
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:56,708
If you quit, I won't take you back again.

1937
02:06:57,208 --> 02:06:58,666
Its okay, sir.

1938
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:00,875
Actually, sir, even I have dreams.

1939
02:07:01,375 --> 02:07:03,625
You just don't see it, but that's okay.

1940
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:07,041
You get on with your life, and I'll get on with mine.

1941
02:07:07,541 --> 02:07:09,958
Do you know how absurd you sound?

1942
02:07:10,458 --> 02:07:11,458
Are you in your senses?

1943
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:14,625
I wasn't all these years, but I am now.

1944
02:07:15,125 --> 02:07:18,916
I am a bit late, but I still got time.

1945
02:07:19,416 --> 02:07:22,041
So...please, sir.

1946
02:07:22,541 --> 02:07:23,291
It's okay.

1947
02:07:23,791 --> 02:07:27,291
There you go.

1948
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:30,041
Hello.

1949
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:32,500
Who? - This is Vivek Hinduja.

1950
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,958
Who do you want? - I want Shanaya.

1951
02:07:36,458 --> 02:07:37,125
And you are?

1952
02:07:37,625 --> 02:07:40,041
PP. Praveen Patel.

1953
02:07:40,541 --> 02:07:44,833
Shanaya. - Hey. Some PP's calling for you.

1954
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:47,166
Give me the phone.

1955
02:07:47,666 --> 02:07:49,125
Be a sweetheart, can you zip me please?

1956
02:07:49,625 --> 02:07:52,083
Oh yes, sure.

1957
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:53,750
It's good. - That's so sweet.

1958
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:55,541
Will you give me a second? - Please take your time.

1959
02:07:56,041 --> 02:07:58,375
Hi, PP. - Hi.

1960
02:07:58,875 --> 02:08:02,250
Who's Vivek? Your secretary?

1961
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:04,583
No, he's my costar.

1962
02:08:05,083 --> 02:08:07,541
He's such a fabulous actor, and he's so sweet.

1963
02:08:08,041 --> 02:08:10,333
What do I do if he's sweet?

1964
02:08:10,833 --> 02:08:12,666
Are you getting jealous?

1965
02:08:13,166 --> 02:08:15,666
Me...why would I get jealous?

1966
02:08:16,166 --> 02:08:18,250
Actors come and go.

1967
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:21,500
I was just saying..

1968
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,416
..why don't you come down to my office for lunch.

1969
02:08:24,916 --> 02:08:25,750
There's no one here.

1970
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:27,666
Even my assistant ran away.

1971
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:29,625
No possible, PP.

1972
02:08:30,125 --> 02:08:32,916
I have just half an hour.

1973
02:08:33,416 --> 02:08:37,000
And...it kind of sounds a little boring.

1974
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:40,916
So...now I am boring? - No, PP.

1975
02:08:41,416 --> 02:08:43,666
Why are you getting so serious? - No.

1976
02:08:44,166 --> 02:08:45,875
It's okay if you don't want to come.

1977
02:08:46,375 --> 02:08:47,333
But don't forget to eat.

1978
02:08:47,833 --> 02:08:48,666
Don't stay hungry.

1979
02:08:49,166 --> 02:08:51,458
Don't worry, I'll eat with Vivek.

1980
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:56,625
And do you remember Naina and Jigar from the concert?

1981
02:08:57,125 --> 02:08:59,208
They are coming to meet the director.

1982
02:08:59,708 --> 02:09:03,208
Looks positive.

1983
02:09:07,583 --> 02:09:11,291
"I don't know what bond I share with you."

1984
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:15,291
Hey, PP...

1985
02:09:30,291 --> 02:09:33,208
Nice to see you.

1986
02:09:33,708 --> 02:09:35,875
Hey, guys, look who's here.

1987
02:09:36,375 --> 02:09:38,833
Mr. Praveen Patel, the owner of the house.

1988
02:09:39,333 --> 02:09:40,375
Hi, Praveen.

1989
02:09:40,875 --> 02:09:44,458
I hope you don't mind, I kept a music session here.

1990
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:48,083
Mr. Patel, you're a wonderful host. - Host?

1991
02:09:48,583 --> 02:09:49,541
But I haven't done anything.

1992
02:09:50,041 --> 02:09:52,666
Praveen, just listen to this young group's song.

1993
02:09:53,166 --> 02:09:53,750
Guys, hit it.

1994
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:54,500
We can have it?

1995
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,875
One, two, three, four..

1996
02:09:57,375 --> 02:10:02,416
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

1997
02:10:02,916 --> 02:10:09,458
You guys can continue, I...I'll be..

1998
02:10:09,958 --> 02:10:14,166
What's wrong?

1999
02:10:14,666 --> 02:10:17,041
Patel, speak up.

2000
02:10:17,541 --> 02:10:19,083
They're playing so loudly.

2001
02:10:19,583 --> 02:10:20,583
You should've thought about mom and dad.

2002
02:10:21,083 --> 02:10:21,791
It must be bothering them.

2003
02:10:22,291 --> 02:10:25,666
They went to the Prem Puri Ashram, they won't be back in the evening.

2004
02:10:26,166 --> 02:10:27,250
And Velji?

2005
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:30,166
He isn't here either.

2006
02:10:30,666 --> 02:10:33,666
PP, you're looking stressed. What's wrong?

2007
02:10:34,166 --> 02:10:36,708
Not stressed..

2008
02:10:37,208 --> 02:10:40,416
You could've told me you're going to do this.

2009
02:10:40,916 --> 02:10:43,875
No, I didn't mean that.. I mean..

2010
02:10:44,375 --> 02:10:47,208
You have time for this, you've time for parties..

2011
02:10:47,708 --> 02:10:50,125
..you have time for Vivek, to have lunch and dinner with him.

2012
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:51,625
But you don't have time for me.

2013
02:10:52,125 --> 02:10:53,833
Did you even ask whether I am tensed or not?

2014
02:10:54,333 --> 02:10:58,708
Am I okay, or not? Did you ever ask?

2015
02:10:59,208 --> 02:11:01,666
Have you finished?

2016
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:03,083
Yes!

2017
02:11:03,583 --> 02:11:07,083
Sit here for five minutes, I'll be right back.

2018
02:11:24,791 --> 02:11:26,666
Shanaya..

2019
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:28,583
Where are you going?

2020
02:11:29,083 --> 02:11:30,625
Shanaya, listen to me..

2021
02:11:31,125 --> 02:11:31,791
Don't touch me.

2022
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:36,125
You insulted me.

2023
02:11:36,625 --> 02:11:40,125
Shanaya.

2024
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:45,375
Shanaya.

2025
02:11:45,875 --> 02:11:48,875
Why are you crying? - So? What do you care?

2026
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:50,458
Why are you saying that?

2027
02:11:50,958 --> 02:11:52,291
How else do I say it, Praveen?

2028
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:55,041
Shanaya, I am sorry.

2029
02:11:55,541 --> 02:11:56,541
I shouldn't have screamed at you.

2030
02:11:57,041 --> 02:11:59,208
But...I don't like Vivek at all.

2031
02:11:59,708 --> 02:12:05,000
And when you spend time with him, I.. - You feel insecure.

2032
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,375
He's my costar, it's professional.

2033
02:12:07,875 --> 02:12:09,708
I have to do it.

2034
02:12:10,208 --> 02:12:12,750
I know, but I still don't like it.

2035
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:15,291
Why? Who am I to you?

2036
02:12:15,791 --> 02:12:18,958
Shanaya, you mean everything to me.

2037
02:12:19,458 --> 02:12:21,833
Then marry me?

2038
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:26,875
Marriage? - Why? Speechless?

2039
02:12:27,375 --> 02:12:28,833
You can't marry me, can you?

2040
02:12:29,333 --> 02:12:30,375
Your world looks at our world..

2041
02:12:30,875 --> 02:12:32,708
..with a completely different perspective.

2042
02:12:33,208 --> 02:12:36,000
I know what you think of actresses.

2043
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:40,166
Wherever I go, everyone's eyes stay on me.

2044
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:42,833
I know where they're looking, what they're looking at..

2045
02:12:43,333 --> 02:12:47,958
..and what they're thinking about doing with me.

2046
02:12:48,458 --> 02:12:50,791
Today when I am with you, you're proud to show me off.

2047
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:53,166
Look, there's an actress with you.

2048
02:12:53,666 --> 02:12:57,666
All I did was hug my costar, and it made you jealous.

2049
02:12:58,166 --> 02:13:01,458
It's my job, PP.

2050
02:13:01,958 --> 02:13:04,125
If we were together, will you let me work?

2051
02:13:04,625 --> 02:13:05,583
And if you do let me work..

2052
02:13:06,083 --> 02:13:09,208
..can you adjust yourself with an actress' lifestyle?

2053
02:13:09,708 --> 02:13:11,916
And when people stare at me..

2054
02:13:12,416 --> 02:13:14,083
..will you be able to control yourself?

2055
02:13:14,583 --> 02:13:16,875
Will you understand my professional behavior?

2056
02:13:17,375 --> 02:13:18,000
You can't.

2057
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:21,666
Because your insecurities will eat you up.

2058
02:13:22,166 --> 02:13:25,000
Every man fantasizes about an actress.

2059
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,916
But when he has her..

2060
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:31,250
..he doesn't know what to do with her.

2061
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:35,875
It takes a strong, secure man to marry an actress.

2062
02:13:36,375 --> 02:13:39,750
So PP, you live your life, and let me live mine.

2063
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:43,750
Let me go.

2064
02:13:48,208 --> 02:13:49,291
Shanaya, please.

2065
02:13:49,791 --> 02:13:53,958
Shanaya... Shanaya, please don't leave me like this.

2066
02:13:54,458 --> 02:13:56,000
You can't do anything for me.

2067
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,791
Shanaya, I'm ready to do anything for you.

2068
02:13:59,291 --> 02:14:01,250
Bet on it, I'll do anything for you.

2069
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,250
Fine, when the time comes..

2070
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:07,250
..I'll ask you for what I want.

2071
02:15:20,875 --> 02:15:21,958
Good morning, Mr. Patel.

2072
02:15:22,458 --> 02:15:24,250
Congratulations, sir.

2073
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:25,500
Praveen...hello. Congratulations.

2074
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,500
Yo man, what a champ you are.

2075
02:15:33,875 --> 02:15:36,166
Mr. Patel, finally you scored.

2076
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:41,041
Sir, you're dream walked out of the DVD.

2077
02:15:41,541 --> 02:15:42,500
You hit the jackpot.

2078
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,208
Praveen, look at you.

2079
02:15:45,708 --> 02:15:49,125
Someone get the groom ready. Roberto.

2080
02:15:49,625 --> 02:15:52,708
Hi, Teddy.

2081
02:15:53,208 --> 02:15:56,708
Roberto, what is this..

2082
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:07,166
I personally picked this dress for you.

2083
02:16:07,666 --> 02:16:12,458
You know, PP...I will miss you.

2084
02:16:12,958 --> 02:16:13,916
Velji, what's happening?

2085
02:16:14,416 --> 02:16:19,416
Am I dreaming? - PP, your dream is finally coming true.

2086
02:16:19,916 --> 02:16:21,416
Are you crazy..

2087
02:16:21,916 --> 02:16:23,416
Guys, what's going on?

2088
02:16:23,916 --> 02:16:26,458
Daddy, you're getting married. - What?

2089
02:16:26,958 --> 02:16:28,958
Yes, dad, everything is going according to plan.

2090
02:16:29,458 --> 02:16:30,791
Come on, Shanaya is waiting for you.

2091
02:16:31,291 --> 02:16:32,375
But...

2092
02:16:32,875 --> 02:16:35,250
How did this escalate to marriage? Will someone explain me?

2093
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:39,416
But dad you said you're going to marry Shanaya.

2094
02:16:39,916 --> 02:16:41,000
And then leave with her.

2095
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:42,666
When did I say that?

2096
02:16:43,166 --> 02:16:44,000
It doesn't matter, dad.

2097
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:47,416
You will marry Shanaya, I will marry Naina.

2098
02:16:47,916 --> 02:16:49,125
Mom will stay with us.

2099
02:16:49,625 --> 02:16:51,208
You'll be happy in your world, and we'll be happy in ours.

2100
02:16:51,708 --> 02:16:52,833
Hold on. What's..

2101
02:16:53,333 --> 02:16:54,875
Take him away. - Where?

2102
02:16:55,375 --> 02:16:56,833
Come on.. - What are you doing?

2103
02:16:57,333 --> 02:16:58,333
Come on, PP. Come on.

2104
02:16:58,833 --> 02:17:02,333
Come, PP.

2105
02:18:11,166 --> 02:18:15,625
You said, PP...you'll give me whatever I want.

2106
02:18:16,125 --> 02:18:17,375
Yes.

2107
02:18:17,875 --> 02:18:28,000
So I want you...to marry her right here, right now.

2108
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:31,875
Look, Shanaya, I want to say something.

2109
02:18:32,375 --> 02:18:33,958
Shanaya, I made a big mistake.

2110
02:18:34,458 --> 02:18:37,333
Look, I lied to you.

2111
02:18:37,833 --> 02:18:39,625
I cannot marry you, and..

2112
02:18:40,125 --> 02:18:41,958
..sorry I can't marry you either.

2113
02:18:42,458 --> 02:18:46,666
Look...I am already married and I love my wife.

2114
02:18:47,166 --> 02:18:52,375
Forgive me, Shanaya, I.. - Hey, Patel.

2115
02:18:52,875 --> 02:18:56,291
Didn't I tell you...I'm Mehsana's Patlani.

2116
02:18:56,791 --> 02:19:05,041
It's impossible to even get me out of your heart, smarty.

2117
02:19:05,541 --> 02:19:09,250
She...she...she... How?

2118
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:12,416
I'll tell you.

2119
02:19:12,916 --> 02:19:18,416
That night when I went to my room, I met Kokila.

2120
02:19:18,916 --> 02:19:21,833
She told me the entire story.

2121
02:19:22,333 --> 02:19:23,666
That she's your wife.

2122
02:19:24,166 --> 02:19:27,041
And Jigar's your son.

2123
02:19:27,541 --> 02:19:31,583
You deviated, for a date and a dream. ,

2124
02:19:32,083 --> 02:19:33,708
Since that moment..

2125
02:19:34,208 --> 02:19:37,625
..everything I did to you..

2126
02:19:38,125 --> 02:19:41,625
..it was just acting.

2127
02:19:58,916 --> 02:20:05,041
And this way...you all made a plan to teach you a lesson.

2128
02:20:05,541 --> 02:20:09,041
All of us? - All of us!

2129
02:20:13,625 --> 02:20:18,250
Jigar...only Naina and you knew about it.

2130
02:20:18,750 --> 02:20:19,916
So this was..

2131
02:20:20,416 --> 02:20:23,333
You did all this you stupid fool.

2132
02:20:23,833 --> 02:20:26,250
Hey Patel, don't abuse him in front of his bride.

2133
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:27,500
You can do it later.

2134
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,041
I was joking.

2135
02:20:31,541 --> 02:20:35,000
I was saying, now that we've already spent a lot..

2136
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:40,125
..why don't we get these two engaged.

2137
02:20:40,625 --> 02:20:42,041
Yeah!

2138
02:20:42,541 --> 02:20:44,541
Great.

2139
02:20:45,041 --> 02:20:46,666
Thank you, dad. Love you. - Mom.

2140
02:20:47,166 --> 02:20:50,666
Now the bride and groom exchange rings.

2141
02:21:03,458 --> 02:21:06,583
Congratulations.

2142
02:21:07,083 --> 02:21:10,583
Congratulations.

2143
02:21:14,291 --> 02:21:17,250
Shanaya, forgive me.

2144
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:20,375
I had strayed.

2145
02:21:20,875 --> 02:21:25,750
But...everyone opened my eyes.

2146
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:27,250
Thank you very much.

2147
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:30,916
And once again sorry for lying to you.

2148
02:21:31,416 --> 02:21:32,166
You're so sweet.

2149
02:21:32,666 --> 02:21:33,458
You know, PP.

2150
02:21:33,958 --> 02:21:39,500
I learnt much more about life, than my role.

2151
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,875
Gathiya, Undhiya, Khakra..

2152
02:21:45,375 --> 02:21:47,000
And Garba.

2153
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,458
It's always going to be a part of my life.

2154
02:21:49,958 --> 02:21:51,666
But now I have to go.

2155
02:21:52,166 --> 02:21:54,625
Baby - Control.

2156
02:21:55,125 --> 02:21:58,625
Group Hug.

2157
02:22:33,166 --> 02:22:35,541
"How will I say it? How will I tell you?"

2158
02:22:36,041 --> 02:22:38,458
"I'll skirt myself from your eyes."

2159
02:22:38,958 --> 02:22:41,208
"I'll show the grace of your attitude."

2160
02:22:41,708 --> 02:22:43,833
"Let your love dwell in my heart."

2161
02:22:44,333 --> 02:22:49,125
"My heart's crazy for your love."

2162
02:22:49,625 --> 02:22:54,791
"What's happened to my heart in your love?"

2163
02:22:55,291 --> 02:23:00,541
"My heart's crazy for your love."

2164
02:23:01,041 --> 02:23:06,708
"What's happened to my heart in your love?"

2165
02:23:07,208 --> 02:23:09,458
"How will I say it? How will I tell you?"

2166
02:23:09,958 --> 02:23:12,416
"I'll skirt myself from your eyes."

2167
02:23:12,916 --> 02:23:15,041
"I'll show the grace of your attitude."

2168
02:23:15,541 --> 02:23:17,625
"Let your love dwell in my heart."

2169
02:23:18,125 --> 02:23:23,125
"My heart's crazy for your love."

2170
02:23:23,625 --> 02:23:27,125
"What's happened to my heart in your love?"

2171
02:23:52,333 --> 02:23:54,583
"Girls are crazy about me."

2172
02:23:55,083 --> 02:23:57,458
"They roam around my lane."

2173
02:23:57,958 --> 02:24:00,333
"You're the lucky baby, you dwell in my heart."

2174
02:24:00,833 --> 02:24:03,916
"You're the Juliet of my dreams."

2175
02:24:04,416 --> 02:24:06,250
"Come...dwell in my heart."

2176
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:08,666
"You're my pride...."

2177
02:24:09,166 --> 02:24:11,125
"...and you're my glory."

2178
02:24:11,625 --> 02:24:13,708
"You're my life."
