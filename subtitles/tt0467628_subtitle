1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,913
Hell is a world of misery.

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,113
We can feel it close at hand,

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,033
but we do not care and choose to forget.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,516
It's a world full of evil acts
and cruelty among human beings.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,790
Thousands or even millions of sinners

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,878
cry and moan in excruciating pain

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,355
to repent sins that they have committed.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,948
Some ask for a little mercy.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,510
Others try to capture us and kill us for food.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,359
No one is likely to believe
what I have just recounted.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,552
However, none of us could escape

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,832
the power of the Great Keeper
who governs hell.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,828
Sooner or later,
you will be aware of the truth.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,073
25 hours earlier

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,950
- Don't drag our kid into this mess.
- I didn't want her to begin with.

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,355
I wouldn't be so miserable
if I'd never had her.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,909
Shut up! Enough is enough!

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,155
Ja, sweetie, are you pregnant?

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,673
Let me have a look.

20
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,798
Let me see.

21
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,949
Ja!

22
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,555
Who is it?

23
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,710
Ja, come on in.

24
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,675
Art!

25
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,798
Let me get you a towel.

26
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
Drink something warm first.
It'll make you feel better.

27
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,674
Art,

28
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,754
I'm not sure if I'm right about Chot.

29
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,798
I think you better leave first.

30
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,831
I agree. I'm of no use to you anymore.

31
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,952
I didn't mean that.

32
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,878
It's all right, but don't stay up too late.

33
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,236
We have a project tomorrow morning.

34
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,349
Ja, have some breakfast first.

35
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,309
I'm in a hurry.

36
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,638
Can't we talk?

37
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,151
What do you care?

38
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,793
My life is none of your business.

39
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,990
You just gave birth to me and that was it!

40
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,868
Peace be with you.

41
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,269
It must be very sacred,

42
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,069
drinking while praying like that.

43
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,192
Lae! You bastard!

44
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,597
I was praying and you still bother me.

45
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,996
Sorry...

46
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,675
Don't ever do that again!

47
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,759
Anyway, when is our producer
supposed to arrive?

48
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,912
I don't know. He's almost never late.

49
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,235
It's late now.

50
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,993
Good luck, Aun.

51
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,148
Call us when you get back.
We'll pick you up.

52
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,436
Bye, Mum, bye, Dad. I'll call you later.

53
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,312
Take care of yourself.

54
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,354
Why did they have to drop me off?

55
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,312
They think I'm still a baby.

56
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,674
Hi, Lae. Hi, Uncle Tao. Where's Chot?

57
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,198
Good Lord!

58
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,155
Those two are so annoying!

59
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,153
UNMASKED

60
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,232
How many people know the truth
that this girl is only sixteen?

61
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,990
She willingly leads this life.
She works here for free,

62
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,716
so that she can use this place to turn tricks.

63
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,391
- Ja.
- Hello, Ja!

64
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,277
Aun, it's late. Let's start loading.

65
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,473
Where are you? How could you
let everyone wait for so long?

66
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,637
You're so selfish and irresponsible.

67
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,399
Are you done complaining?

68
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,276
Next time, you should look around first.

69
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,834
Kim, this is the script.

70
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,439
Thank you, Uncle!

71
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,791
Talk to Art, if you have any concerns.

72
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,309
You'll be equipped
with two concealed cameras,

73
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,070
one inside the brooch
and one in your purse.

74
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,552
Try to avoid touching those things.

75
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,318
Don't worry. This is safe.

76
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,512
Just try to control
the camera the way I taught you.

77
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,753
Stay calm and act normal. You'll be safe.

78
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,309
All right.

79
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,596
Your responsibility

80
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,438
is to take care of the equipment.

81
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,836
Don't confuse her. I'll take care of her.

82
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,872
Aun, could you turn that off?

83
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,231
Aun, stop drooling.

84
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,472
When we finish this job,
I'll let you meet some real angels.

85
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,872
Only cute and light-skinned girls.

86
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,675
Are you for real? You know lying is a sin.

87
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,316
I'm not lying. I never deceive anyone.

88
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,429
I agree. There are hundreds of virtues,

89
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,037
but Lae can follow only one of them.

90
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,709
Uncle, you make it sound like I'm so rotten.

91
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,311
When your time comes,
don't even ask Aun and me for help.

92
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,119
Hey, we share the same blood,
I'll go wherever you guys go.

93
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,117
I thought so.

94
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,555
Aun, you're still young.

95
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,716
You should save some money.

96
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,919
Don't spend it all on bullshit.

97
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,154
You must learn to behave well,

98
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,838
so you go to heaven when you die.

99
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,356
What's the point of going to heaven
when you die?

100
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,673
I'm warning you,
but you just want to joke around.

101
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Beware! Your soul is heading to hell!

102
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,355
That stuff was strong. It was good.

103
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,517
What the hell is going on?
Why is it so hot today?

104
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,953
Where are you going?

105
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,151
Chot! I have to talk to you.

106
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,035
Ja, don't do this.

107
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,916
I don't have any feelings for Kim.

108
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,479
You worry so much.

109
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,071
I'm pregnant.

110
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,035
With who?

111
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,916
I mean, are you sure?

112
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,790
Am I sure that I'm pregnant
or that you're the father?

113
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,832
What are you going to do?

114
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,799
What about you?

115
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,512
I'm not ready.

116
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,638
You're not going to take responsibility,
are you?

117
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,479
No, but we're so young.

118
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,672
Neither of us even has a steady job.

119
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,154
I'm ready.

120
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,108
Ja, let's talk about it
after we finish this project.

121
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,789
Let's go.

122
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,235
Lae!

123
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,151
Lae!

124
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,673
What the heck is going on?

125
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,793
I almost peed my pants.

126
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,958
I have to get out to take a leak.

127
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,634
Keep moving!

128
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,234
Come on!

129
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,669
Move along!

130
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,394
Hello?

131
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,394
Yes.

132
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,631
Go! Go! Get out of my way!

133
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,309
Kim!

134
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,034
- Don't go, Ja.
- If you want to stay, then stay by yourself.

135
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,911
Where do you think we can go?

136
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,271
Get away from me!

137
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,471
What's going on?

138
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,313
Kim?

139
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,796
Are you okay? Help him! Help!

140
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,114
Art, are you all right?

141
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,958
Hello? Yes, I'm his wife.

142
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,279
What?

143
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,478
Where? Where is he now?

144
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,551
Your dad just causes us constant trouble.

145
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,716
I wonder when he's gonna die.

(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

147
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,197
Move along!

148
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,629
Move along!

149
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,878
If you wanna stay,
then stay here by yourself!

150
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,435
Ja!

151
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,755
Kim, you go ahead. I'll be right back.

152
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,118
- No, I don't want to.
- Just go on.

153
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,229
Art!

(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

155
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,317
What the hell is this room?

156
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,428
People who came here before us named it
the Waiting Room.

157
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,155
- The Waiting Room?
- Waiting for the reincarnation.

158
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,316
Which one is mine?

159
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,358
Chot, don't let them do anything to me!

160
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,314
Move along!

161
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,595
Chot! I don't want to go! No!

162
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,632
Uncle Tao, help me! Help me, please!

163
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,549
I can't help you. I can't even help myself!

164
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,228
Chot! Help me!

165
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,033
Let me go! Let me go!

166
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,516
- Chot!
- Ja!

167
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,879
Kim, listen! We're not dead.

168
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,958
I saw the lights of our lives on earth.

169
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,518
We're all in the emergency room.

170
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,398
We're in critical condition, but we're
not dead. We have to hurry back.

171
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,518
Get back? How?

172
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,875
This is really good,
I've been waiting for so long for this.

173
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,637
It was so tormenting.
It took forever before I could redeem myself.

174
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,517
Yes. I don't mind being reborn as anything.

175
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,714
Just let me out of this place.

176
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,355
Do we have to eat that black pill?

177
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,877
Of course! That black stuff

178
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,636
is the place where you will be reborn.

179
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,471
The water that they drink
will erase all their memories

180
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,636
of past lives.

Then, I won't be able to remember a thing?

182
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,951
Honey, why would you
want to remember anything?

183
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,915
Now we can go back, right, Art?

184
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,314
We have to help our friends first.
We're not dead.

185
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,749
We don't belong here.
Kim, you wait here, okay?

186
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,880
Wait! Let me go with you.
I don't want to be alone!

187
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,871
Don't think that you can just torture me!

188
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,716
Mum!

189
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,189
What do you care?

190
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,756
You didn't even want me to begin with.

191
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,597
Chot, help me.

192
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,439
Hurry up, Ja!

193
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,359
I can't walk.

194
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,155
Come on!

195
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,994
Chot!

196
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,358
This way! Help me, too!

197
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,198
I can't! You have to help yourself.

198
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,713
Idiot! I'm hanging here.
How can I help myself?

199
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,039
Every man for himself! I have to go now!

200
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,232
Why don't you help me?
We're in this together.

201
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,155
Help me, you selfish bastard!

202
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,595
Chot! You bastard!
Don't let me see you again!

203
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,313
Now, Ja, you have to walk.
I can't carry you anymore.

204
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,598
Chot! You selfish bastard!

205
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,352
Son of a bitch!

206
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,589
I can't even save myself
and I also have Ja with me.

207
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,469
Hurry up. They're here again.

208
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,712
There!

209
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,354
(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

210
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,679
Art, how did you get here?

211
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,959
We're not dead yet.

212
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,275
- How do you know?
- I'll tell you later.

213
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,875
I know how to get out of here.

214
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,479
I think we'd better go now.

215
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,120
Then why would they bring us here?

216
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,798
They should take us back.

217
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,153
They might not know. So many deaths!

218
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,317
Or they knew,
but didn't want to take us back.

219
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,356
It was a lot of work bringing us here.
They wouldn't have enough time

220
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,633
if they decided to take us back.

221
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,877
How could they do this to us? It's not fair.

222
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,913
Then we have to sue them for torturing us.

223
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,629
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

224
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,591
We have to help Lae and Aun first.

225
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,109
Don't try to be a hero!
We can't even help ourselves here.

226
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,549
I think...

227
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,956
Didn't you see how ruthless
those people were? If we go help those two,

228
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,275
we might not have a chance.
Don't act like a hero. It can get you killed!

229
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,829
If you want to go, then go.
We won't go with you.

230
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,312
Ja, have you lost your mind?
Art has no mum and dad.

231
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,671
He has no one to worry about!
Ja, you still have your mum.

232
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,398
Think about your mum!

233
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,357
What about our baby?
Aren't you worried about him?

234
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,476
In a situation like this, nobody
can blame anyone for being selfish.

235
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,510
Kim, you know the way, right?

236
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,909
Ja and Kim, you two should go back first.

237
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,752
Take care of this fag, too. I'll go with Art.

(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

239
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,079
Where the hell is this place?

240
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,472
- Kim, are you sure this is the right way?
- It wasn't like this before.

241
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,479
This is weird.

242
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,437
Are you taking us the right way?

243
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,592
I don't know.

244
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,149
Please help!

245
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,596
Please help!

246
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,310
Help me! Please!

247
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,479
Mum, come play with us!

248
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,473
Please help me!

249
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,194
Mum, let's play!

250
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,358
Help me! Help me! Help me!

251
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,592
Come on, Mum! Play with us! Play with us!

252
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,189
Play with us!

Help me! Anyone! Please help!

255
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,317
Are you crazy? Go on! Hurry up!

256
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,558
Lae. Lae.

257
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,229
Lae.

258
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,838
Art, help me!

259
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,271
Aun. Aun.

260
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,078
- It's me!
- Uncle.

261
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,516
Shut up! You want all of them to come here?

262
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,828
Bastard!

263
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,115
Easy. Easy.

264
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,270
- What are we gonna do, Art?
- Let's hide first.

265
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,549
Ja!

266
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,592
Art! Uncle Tao! Lae!

267
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,791
What are you guys doing here?

268
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,154
What about Kim?

269
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,875
Chot! Where's Kim?

270
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,031
She was eaten by little monsters.
Don't make me get into the details.

271
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,635
It was horrible!

272
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,550
How's that possible? Dead again and again?

273
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,718
Chot killed her.

274
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,594
Son of a bitch!

275
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,038
Let me go!

276
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,912
Art! Don't!

277
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,077
Enough! Leave that bastard alone!

278
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,035
Let's go!

279
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,633
I could use a few drinks.

280
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,839
Look, Lae, we're in hell
and Uncle Tao still wants his drink.

281
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,076
What about the drink in those giant pots?
I saw quite a few of them.

282
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,119
Watch out! You've got a sharp tongue.
I shouldn't have saved you.

283
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,959
I'm just kidding! Don't take it seriously!

284
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,908
Hey, brave girl.

285
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,995
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,753
Don't be.

287
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,514
I'm the one who should be sorry.

288
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,797
I always thought that I was too good
and didn't care about others.

289
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,951
I was so self-righteous.

290
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,831
Even when it came to Chot.

291
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,916
I deserve to be here,

292
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,111
to repent for what I did to my mum.

293
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,436
I caused her so much pain.

294
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,349
I only looked at her past mistakes.

295
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,231
I was so resentful
that my mum wanted an abortion.

296
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,996
She didn't want to have me.

297
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,831
But my mum was truly sorry.

298
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,355
She was trying to make it up to me.

299
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,199
I never thought about forgiving her.

300
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,799
Besides,

301
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,518
I made the same mistake,

302
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,719
just like her.

303
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,751
I am so

304
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,075
ungrateful!

305
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,111
If I ever go back,

306
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,680
how could I look her in the eyes.

307
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,791
Don't give up, Ja.
Your mum is waiting for you.

308
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,833
Just say sorry,
your mum would be very happy.

309
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,794
I appreciate that you came and rescued us.

310
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,314
If I were you, I'm not sure

311
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,356
if I would go back to help you all.

312
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,350
Don't mention it.

313
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,509
Lae.

314
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,595
Lae, what are you thinking?

315
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,272
I must have hurt so many people.
I didn't realize it at the time.

316
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,038
I thought it was fun.

317
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,828
Me, too.

318
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,430
I don't know why I was so useless.

319
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,555
I drank and hit my wife all the time.

320
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,719
I didn't care.

321
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,390
If I ever go back, I'll make it up

322
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,268
to my wife and my kid.

323
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,597
To tell you the truth,
your face reminds me of my parents.

324
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:19,240
Uncle, what's wrong?
Don't joke around! It's not funny!

325
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:23,114
Lae, I don't think he's joking.

326
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,789
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

327
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,949
Uncle!

328
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,991
Uncle! Are you okay?

329
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,872
Uncle!

330
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,639
Ready!

331
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,716
Clear!

332
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,958
The patient's in a coma.
We're trying our best,

333
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,595
but he's still unconscious.

334
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,156
We can't guarantee anything.

335
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,269
He may not be normal ever again.

336
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,472
Worst-case scenario, he might be brain-dead

337
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,353
and may slip into a vegetative state.

338
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,428
When he was normal,
all he did was drink and get drunk.

339
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,594
Now I have to take care of him?

340
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,234
To be honest,
I don't have the money to take care of him.

341
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,637
We barely make end meets.

342
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,154
And I don't have time
to take care of the disabled.

343
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,272
If his condition gets worse,

344
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,077
I think you should let him go.

345
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,838
You have my permission.

346
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,669
There it is. The place that will take us back.

347
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,079
Yeah!

348
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,909
Nim, please wait for Daddy.

349
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,079
I'll see you soon.

350
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,356
- Lae, it's me, Art.
- Art?

351
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,229
- Let's try to light this place up.
- Sure.

352
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,590
Ja? Ja?

353
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,395
Ja?

354
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,509
Ja?

355
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,232
- Art, help me!
- Lae, go take a look.

356
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,789
Uncle! How are you feeling? Uncle!

357
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,234
Uncle! Are you okay?

358
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,555
Art, let's go!

359
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,791
- Aun.
- Art! Lae!

360
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,516
Stop playing around! Hurry up!
Find something to feed the fire.

361
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,994
What the hell is this?

362
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,108
This stinks!

363
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,153
Chot! You scared me!

364
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,431
Run! Run! Run! Quick!

365
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,276
Ja, run! Get out of here!

366
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,599
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a drink.

367
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,314
Drink. Drink.
You never think about family, about us.

368
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,477
- Why can't I drink?
- What about your family?

369
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,478
Shut up! Idiot! What do you want from me?

370
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,429
Fine! If you want to die, then go ahead!

371
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,316
Uncle Tao! Uncle Tao! Uncle Tao!

372
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,229
Lae!

373
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,316
Uncle!

374
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,668
- Uncle!
- Lae!

375
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,794
Lae!

376
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,510
Uncle!

377
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,273
Uncle Tao.

378
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,555
Come back! Come back here! Uncle!

379
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,515
Jitra.

380
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,312
Please help me.

381
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,519
I'm so scared.

382
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,439
I don't know why,

383
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,233
but whatever I did to you,

384
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,839
I'm so sorry.

385
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,190
Please forgive me, Jitra.

386
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,075
Let's go, sweetie.

387
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:31,471
Where are you taking me?

388
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,393
I don't want to go.

389
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,632
Lae! Lae, don't lose it!

390
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,319
Try to stay focused!

391
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,399
Aun, hurry up! We have to go now.

392
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,035
Let's go!

393
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,676
(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

394
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,032
- Lae, help me!
- Aun!

395
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,315
Art. Art. Art.

396
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,078
I can't go on any further.

397
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,273
Aun, you take Art and Ja away.

398
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,755
I'll follow you guys later. Don't worry!

399
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,550
Lae, what do you think you're doing?

400
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,190
I'll take care of these guys. You take Ja out.

401
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,873
No, Lae, don't do that!

402
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,916
Hurry up, Art! Ja can't hold on anymore.

403
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,909
Hurry up!

404
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,197
You, too!

405
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,835
Go!

406
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,879
See you soon, Lae!

407
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,352
This way, girls! I love having fun!

408
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,715
Come on! Come! I'll satisfy everyone!

409
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,158
Are you cheating on me?

410
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,109
Come here now!

411
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,038
Don't hurt me!

412
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,029
(SPEAKING SANSKRIT)

413
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,398
Her condition is stable, but still critical.

414
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,314
We have to see if she can survive the night.

415
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,036
We tried our best to save the baby.

416
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,318
I'm very sorry.

417
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,675
Thank you.

418
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,434
Ja.

419
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,714
Who wants to wait? Wait? I can't!

420
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,595
Get out of my way!

421
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,313
Get out of my way!

422
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,314
Get away from me!

423
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,595
Ja! Ja!

424
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,838
No, Ja, no. We made it here. Don't give up!

425
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,431
Aun, go get those pills. Quick!

426
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,839
Where are they?

427
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,029
Chot!

428
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,913
I had it first!

429
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,953
Ja. Ja.

430
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,069
Son of a bitch!

431
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,556
- Ja. Ja. Ja.
- Ja!

432
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,597
Get up there, Aun!

433
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,554
Are you sure? It's...

434
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,910
Go! We don't have any choice!

435
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,109
Lae!

436
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,956
You probably think that
what you just saw is only a fiction

437
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,312
created by someone.

438
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,909
I can't prove otherwise,
nor have any evidence

439
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:39,190
to confirm.

440
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,911
However, I can guarantee one thing.
Whatever you've done,

441
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,598
bad or good,

442
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,197
everything has consequences.
One day you will realize

443
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,675
that karma exists.
