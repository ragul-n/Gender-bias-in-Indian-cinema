Hey Sexy!

00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,085
-Hi.
-Hi.

8
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,862
You look so pretty.

00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:43,351
-Thank you.

10
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,658
May I have your phone number?

11
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:47,900
Come on.

12
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,692
Hey, are you crazy? Behave yourself.

13
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,650
You stupid, I will kill you.
What the hell?

14
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:00,519
You bloody bugger!

15
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,932
How dare you flirt with our girl!

18
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,958
What is this, Sreenu?

19
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:58,429
It seems you wore a mask yesterday,
snatched that girl returning from college,

20
00:03:58,476 --> 00:03:59,811
into the lemon farm and assaulted?

21
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:00,649
What is the matter?

22
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,919
Where is the protection
for men in this country?

23
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:07,161
If a woman sheds two tears,

24
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:11,458
everybody from our President to
American President supports them.

25
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,768

26
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,616
five hundred acres of land

27
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,199
and as am shining in black, you
thought to trap me, girl? Huh?

28
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,672
What dear, you said that he wore a mask
and how can you be sure it's him?

29
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:25,008
Do you have any proof?

30
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,831
It is him, sir.

31
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,683
Would anybody go with proof,
Aadhar card, ration card,

32
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:31,714
or the Paytm and then assault a girl?

33
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,493
Someone wore a mask and assaulted
her, but blaming my brother. That is it!

34
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:37,294
Look Rajaiah,
there should be proper proofs.

35
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,023
If not the case will not stand, right?

36
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,319
It is not good to call an elderly man
like me to this meeting and insult.

37
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:44,667
Correct yourself, if you
have committed any mistakes.

38
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,881
Are there any more issues to
be sorted? Come on tell me.

39
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:50,771
How dare someone throws a sandal at me?

40
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:51,759
It's size seven sandal, bro.

41
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,189
-Whose sandal is this?
-Such a beautiful sandal in our village?

42
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,968
See where is the other sandal?

43
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,491
-Hey!
-Go and search for it.

44
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:59,634
Bro, need not search.
Even the second sandal is here.

45
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,619
Chitti... we should put
on mask next time for her.

46
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,388
Chitti, why are you over reacting?

47
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:14,347
I respect women and thus I gave
you some respect. What is the matter?

48
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,043
My brother-in-law is
coming to sort this out.

49
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:18,929
He is just passed LLB.

50
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,430
He will definitely find out who
among you is the culprit?

51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,883
What is LLB?

52
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,136
RMP Doctor bro.

53
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,971
-What does that mean?
-He gives injections to animals.

54
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,544
Is it?
Do you mean that Sapthagiri fellow?

55
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:29,831
Yes, he is my brother-in-law.

56
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:30,812
Ask him to come.

57
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:33,906
-Call him... Ask him to come.
-Where is he? Hey, Sapthagiri...

58
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:35,983
[vehicle honking]

59
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:41,377
"Sapthagiri LLB has arrived..."

60
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:57,440
"Sapthagiri LLB has arrived..."

61
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:01,254
Hey, move...
move aside...

62
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,052
He dashed.

63
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,805
-Hi, brother-in-law.
-Chitti.

64
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,237
Blacky brother-in-law.

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,796
Melupatla village in our Punganur
Mandal has a very good name.

66
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:16,337
And such an incident taking place
in this village is a bad thing.

67
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,572
Sir, my daughter was cheated.

68
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,005
Shut up, don't you dare to speak again!

69
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,668
Your responsibility as a father is to...

70
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,049
to bring her up well.

71
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,615
She is seen in every restaurant,
hotel and park in Madanapalle.

72
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:29,982
You know she goes out with a
different guy every day?

73
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,685
How could you both blame
our innocent Prabhas Sreenu?

74
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,727
whose heart is as pure as a child?

75
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,140
You know how much would
that tender heart suffers?

76
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,261
-Brother, what are you talking?
-Shut up, you dirty lady!

77
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,250
I will not talk with you.

78
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,588
What Sapthagiri,
why do you talk so cheap about a girl?

79
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,185
I clearly understood the situation.

80
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,888
He is planning to get you out
from this and charge some money.

81
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,023
You do not back off and pay him well.

82
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:49,960
Not now but later.

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,580
When I recently went to
Madanapalle that lab assistant, Dhamadri,

84
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:55,050
said a horrible truth about your daughter.

85
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:58,349
But I'm afraid cannot
utter those words here.

86
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,265
Hey, what is that?
Do you know that?

87
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,511
Why do you ask me?
Ask that fellow.

88
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:03,925
-Giri...
-Hey Blacky!

89
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,644
Brother-in-law...
brother-in-law...

90
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:09,512
I am unable to bear that she has put
such blame on you brother-in-law.

91
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:13,923
Brother-in-law, you would have not
done it. You are not such a person.

92
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,130
Who is the reason that our
village has developed so well?

93
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,589
-It's Prabhas Sreenu.
-Who is the celebrity in our village?

94
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:19,638
-It's Prabhas Sreenu.
-Who is the legend?

95
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:20,134
It's Prabhas Sreenu.

96
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,291
-Who is a great man?
-It's Prabhas Sreenu.

97
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,364
-Who is the kind-hearted person?
-It's Prabhas Sreenu.

98
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,300
Who is an idiot and a human beast?

99
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:25,539
-That too is Prabhas Sreenu.
-Hey!

100
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,671
You do not know, let me say.

101
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,363
But what did that lab
guy at Madanapalle say?

102
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,604
You ask anything but I
cannot tell about that.

103
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,167
-Say it out, Giri.
-Hey, blacky...

104
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:35,897
This is the problem of our village
and I cannot say it.

105
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,631
-The whole village should listen, say it.
-Say it out, Giri.

106
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,733
All of us would get humiliated,
and get defamed blacky.

107
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,784
-Say it out, Giri...
-I will not say, I will not...

108
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,321
-Say it out...
-Alright, listen to me, Blacky!

109
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:46,506
What happened to that girl?

110
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:47,677
That girl...

111
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:48,565
-That girl...?
-That girl...?

112
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:49,474
That girl...

113
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,170
-Yes, what happened to that girl?
-What happened?

114
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,789
is infected with AIDS.

115
00:07:59,122 --> 00:07:59,943
Bro.

116
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:01,396
[gasps]

117
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,670
My bro has AIDS, he has AIDS.

118
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,596
The first gets leprosy when AIDS attacks

119
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,239
Limbs and hands get twisted.

120
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,378
One loses eyes and mustache.

121
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,789
Resulting in the loss of the nose,
he will die all of a sudden...

122
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,435
-Please go back a bit.
-See!

123
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:22,382
How badly my brother-in-law
worried about the village even now?

124
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:26,497
Now, I'm not worried about that but about
that great man who assaulted this girl.

125
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,535
Within 24 hours...

126
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:34,172
Anti-virus HIV injection must
be given. Else, he will die.

127
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,172
It is already been 23
hours that she is molested.

128
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,810
Just an hour is left and he would
live if this injection is given.

129
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,980
-Tell me who is that great person?
-It's me.

130
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,276
-Who is that great man?
-It's me.

131
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,000
-Who is that...
-It's me.

132
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,079
It is my bro, who molested.

133
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:48,551
-Is that you?
-Yes.

134
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,175
Excuse me, it is my bro
who assaulted that girl physically.

135
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,687
-When did he rape?
-23 hours ago.

136
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:56,694
-Where has he molested?
-In the lemon farm.

137
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:57,687
What were you doing?

138
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,469
I was plucking the lemons.

139
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,818
-You skinny rogue!
-Oh no!

140
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,192
My dear President,

141
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:06,405
as this guy molesting her is true,
the disease I told she has is false.

142
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,170
As per IPC section 376 A,

143
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,204
10 years of imprisonment will be imposed

144
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:12,491
...for touching one's own
wife without her consent.

145
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,976
And this person has
molested an innocent girl.

146
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:18,288
If he is arrested under Nirbhaya
case of IPC section 376,

147
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:21,891
he may get a life imprisonment or 10
lakhs fine and a non-bailable warrant.

148
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,277
The judge's mood is off he might impose
all the three and hang him to death.

149
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:28,789
So, will he die suffering in jail
lifelong or stay happy marrying that girl?

150
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,497
You give the judgment.

151
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,645
Sorry dear,
I'm the son of a farmer as well.

152
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,909
As I did not want the daughter of
another farmer to have injustice,

153
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,292
I had to lie about you.

154
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,682
Forgive me, dear.

155
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,895
Hey Sreenu,
as it is proved that you did the crime,

156
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,269
you should marry that
girl and keep her happy.

157
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,177
Okay.

158
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:50,325
[laughing]
[cheering]

159
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:51,894
I like you, brother-in-law.

160
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,510
"He has a fearless heart"

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,166
"Move aside,
we should whistle and move aside"

162
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,832
"Fight..."

163
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,283
"Facing him is a fight"

164
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:17,224
"All India should shake seeing his energy"

165
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:22,293
"He is the moon of Chittoor
and Indra when he dances"

166
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:32,661
"He is both the head and
tails of the coin, justice"

167
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,867
"He is so great, oh my God"

168
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,412
"Whole village should salute you"

169
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:52,581
"He is the son of Nampalli
village and care of for justice"

170
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:57,753
"He is the right in judgment and
the flag of justice is flying high"

00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,138
Jhansi sister.

193
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,786
-[gasps] Is it you?
-Hmm.

194
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:47,201
What is your case early in the morning?

195
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,342
Hey, I already have 14 cases today.

196
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:53,171
You bring all idiotic cases, argue
foolishly and cause me headache.

197
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,905
Have you won at least one case?

198
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,370
You just waste the court time.

199
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,231
Your honor!

200
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,927
The allegation is that my client
Mr. Naidu has made his son,

201
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:02,105
perform cesarean surgery
just at an age of 14 years.

202
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,290
-This is completely false.
-Objection, your honor.

203
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,098
Dr. Naidu indeed made his son operate.

204
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,562
But,
he is threatening them from a month.

205
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,654
He is trying to close the case
using his political influence.

206
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,813
I saw that in the paper and
presented a PIL in the court, madam.

207
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,432
Hey, silence!

208
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:23,772
Your honor, it is true that the small
boy was there while the operation was on.

209
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,908
As he was rigid to see an operation,
he took him in as a father.

210
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,652
Just because he was present
there, doesn't mean he operated.

211
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:30,914
For instance,

212
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,507
last week when your younger daughter,

213
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,710
wanted to see the court so you
brought and made her sit beside you.

214
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,832
Does that mean she has
passed the judgement?

215
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:37,829
Hey Bunty, come here.

216
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,674
Look at this little boy for once, madam.

217
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:44,811
See how cute is this little
fellow with saturated fat.

218
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,245
When he can't even spell
cesarean, how could he even do it?

219
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:49,844
Even operation theater will not believe.

220
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,569
And I cannot believe
that you believe this.

221
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:53,376
Huh?

222
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:54,797
You have to believe, your honor.

223
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,038
He let him do this operation to get his
son's name enrolled in the Guinness Book.

224
00:14:58,392 --> 00:14:59,198
Any evidence?

225
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,126
Yes, your honor.

226
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,337
I downloaded it from Facebook, your honor.

227
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,292
What is it?

228
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,075
Hell with you and your Facebook!
Okay, cool. I will take care.

229
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,903
Heights of stupidity!

230
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,040
What Doctor, do you have no sense?

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,053
What is wrong in it, madam?

232
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:18,624
It happens nowhere in this world
that a 14 years boy operated.

233
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:23,253
They are appreciating in phones from
Russia, America and England nations.

234
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,330
They are offering in lakhs
saying to give a job.

235
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:30,457
As the Doctor himself agreed, I am
requesting to punish him rigorously.

236
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,420
Your honor, Sachin Tendulkar at
an age of 16 years and 205 days

237
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,433
has debuted into cricket
at Karachi in Pakistan.

238
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,034
If he was stopped thinking as
a small boy and would get hurt,

239
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,534
do we have a cricket God today?

240
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,901
Malavath Purna of 16 years age,
a Telugu girl from our Nizamabad,

241
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,612
has made our national flag
fly high on the Mount Everest

242
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,823
We wrote great about
her in our headlines.

243
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,556
If she was stopped
thinking it as dangerous,

244
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,447
would the fame of
Telugu go worldwide?

245
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,229
Our 14 years aged Bunty belonging
to a similar category,

246
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,626
has operated and got a success means,
your honor...

247
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,892
this a bad day...
sorry, great day in medical history.

248
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,336
Look man, one may have any great talent.

249
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,753
But what if the patient had lost life?

250
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:07,819
But she didn't lose her life.Both
mother and the baby are safe.

251
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,294
My Lord, please give it a
thought and grant bail to my client.

252
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,860
What you said is good to
listen logically but against rules.

253
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,584
I cannot give a bail under any section.

254
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:22,293
Hey, to know more about me,
ask the knife I operate with,

255
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:25,024
or ask the needle I stitch
with and they would say.

256
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,231
Madam! 22 Kidney operations,

257
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,194
33 heart operations,

258
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:35,370
44 eye operations and
did 55 piles operations.

259
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,319
I have even done 99 sex-change operations.

260
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,896
If required, I am promising to do
the 100th for free to anyone here.

261
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,758
-[indistinct voices]
-Order...

262
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,726
-Hey! I'll do the sex operation to you.
-You should not talk like this.

263
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,599
You are not understanding.

264
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,840
Buzz off, you short fellow!

265
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,653
Do you think this is a court or a market?

266
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:53,255
Your honor, he spoke like
that, as his sugar levels went high.

267
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,888
You get all crazy cases,
the court is adjourned.

268
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:57,412
-Madam, sister.
-Hey!

269
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,020
Will you not visit my hospital
someday and not get operated by me?

270
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:06,157
-Hey! I will then teach you a lesson.
-Take him away.

271
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,182
-Constable, take him away first.
-[indistinct voices]

272
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,575
-Leave!
-Please, sister.

273
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:12,818
District court today has
denied bail to Dr. Naidu.

274
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,269
Lawyer Subash who filed the
PIL on this case is with us.

275
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,245
Tell us, Mr. Subash,
what happened in the court?

276
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:23,068
Dr. Naidu for Guinness record
made his son aged 14 operate.

277
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,723
Lawyer,
Sapthgiri LLB on the side of that Doctor,

278
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,888
brought a cake, impressed the Judge

279
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,780
and made a fool of himself
as he could not win the case.

280
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,612
That is the matter.

281
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,011
Why have put a long face?
Because of losing the case?

282
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:37,664
Hmm!

283
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,517
Sir, I used to win any case
at my place just like that.

284
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,200
[sighs] That is the
Panchayat and this is the court.

285
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,726
Hell with the courts, sir!
Even God is not cooperating with me.

286
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,318
Hey, father gives birth,

287
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,876
teacher gives education

288
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,429
but God will not give the victory.

289
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:54,882
We should achieve it.

290
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,135
Listen to me and go to the higher courts.

291
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:58,696
There would be big cases.

292
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,594
You will get the experience and
the knowledge grows.

293
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:04,684
Then the success will come
in search of you.

294
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:05,808
All the best.

295
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,750
-Hey Buddy!
-Sister is inside.

296
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,684
Get down, I got my information.

297
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,113
-In unison: Good morning, brother-in-law.
-Good morning.

298
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,618
Brother-in-law, you said you'd
come for lunch and didn't turn up.

299
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:21,751
You know, I brought lemon rice for you.

300
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:23,176
I am hurt.

301
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:25,202
Chitti, I should talk to you.
Come on, I will tell you.

302
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,027
Where are you taking me,
brother-in-law? Wait.

303
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,215
Chitti, I am planning
to shift to Hyderabad.

304
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,321
Why? Are you bored of me?

305
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:34,156
Why will I get bored of you, Chitti?

306
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,428
All here are making fun of me and
there is none to encourage, you know?

307
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:38,680
If I go to Hyderabad,

308
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,071
there would be big cases,
big courts and big lawyers.

309
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,621
I will join as an Apprentice to
them and win with experience.

310
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,679
I anyways have my brother-in-law
there and he would help me.

311
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,159
Have you again lost the
case brother-in-law?

312
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,503
-Hmm.
-Shall I tell you something?

313
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,131
You should have the luck to win a case.

314
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,211
Marry me and you will win all the cases.

315
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,246
Will luck come along
if I marry you, Chitti?

316
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,856
This sounds good.
Come on, let us go and get married.

317
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,262
Hey!
Where are you taking my daughter?

318
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,552
Father,
I am going to marry brother-in-law.

319
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,212
She is mine!

320
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,726
I am going to Hyderabad.

321
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,983
I will acquire all the
qualifications required to marry her.

322
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,493
and then come back.

323
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:16,918
If you try to play any tricks
I will have to teach you a lesson.

324
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,553
I love you.

325
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,797
6 MONTHS LATER

326
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:35,242
Brother, is it an extramarital affair?

327
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,327
Why do you say divorce
when we just married!

328
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:38,151
Come on, darling.

329
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,248
Hey, I will argue your divorce
case in the next six months, do remember.

330
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,210
-Hey Punganur!
-Yeah.

331
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,007
You turned the court
into a bus stand.

332
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:45,886
-Damn! Hey, juniors.
-In unison: Yes, boss!

333
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,077
It has been six months and
I'm couldn't get even one case.

334
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:50,753
My village was better, whether I won or
lost, but I used to get 25 cases a day.

335
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:51,685
Do not worry, boss.

336
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,139
I will get a wonderful case.

337
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,719
We will have continuous
money flow for a month.

338
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,137
-Do something.
-You take this bill.

339
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,293
Hey, brother.

340
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,045
-Yeah!
-You should do me a small favor, bro.

341
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,198
I will pay if you want.

342
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,945
Are the cops distributing money
to the lawyers these days?

343
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:03,763
What is the matter?

344
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:04,536
Nothing, bro.

345
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,876
We brought five-member robbery
gang of Dandupalyam batch.

346
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,776
One from those has escaped and
we have the argument today.

347
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,974
-Moreover the entire media is right here.
-So?

348
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:16,202
If you stand before the media in the
getup of that escaped guy, my job is safe.

349
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,421
You, bloody rascal!

350
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,124
Do I look like a dirty thief for you?

351
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:20,883
I will give you five thousand.

352
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,404
Fold it and keep it in
your underwear pocket.

353
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,744
Brother, my daughter's wedding is in
a week and I will lose my prestige.

354
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,523
Wedding might be called off. I beg you.

355
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,146
I'm convinced as you said that
your daughter's wedding is on cards.

356
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,946
Added it is been very long
since I did a disguised role.

357
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,066
Basically, that's what I am.

358
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,719
Here,
everything is in this bag.

359
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:40,917
-You are not trapping me, right?
-No.

360
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:41,697
You will manage, right?

361
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:43,661
See the rest on the screen.

362
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,169
"Moon of Chittore..."

363
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,884
"Hey Shakalaka Shankar... Here I come..."

364
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:12,376
Hey! Who are you idiot,
dashing? Are you blind?

365
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:14,153
You look like a guy who eats
insects on the Discovery channel.

366
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:17,640
-[gasps]
-Hey!

367
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,207
What did you say?

368
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:22,049
You look like the guy who eats insects...

369
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:23,553
-...on Discovery channel.
-Hey!

370
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,584
I will kill this
fellow and drink his blood...

371
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:33,143
I will kill this fellow and
drink his blood. Hey...!

372
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,807
I will kill one per one shot... Hey...

373
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:38,552
Buzz off!

374
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:41,932
He did not recognize it.

375
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,458
Hey, move aside...
Move...

376
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:46,900
Hey, who are you, rascal?

377
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:47,684
Who are you, idiot?

378
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,028
Ours is Dandupalyam gang.

379
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:50,305
Ours is Bangarupalyam batch.

380
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:53,007
-Hey, I will cut the throats.
-We cut the goats.

381
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,944
Hey,
why are you talking with those murderers?

382
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,626
-Am I living in the role?
-Shucks! Move.

383
00:21:57,023 --> 00:22:00,651
Swathi, police have just shown up
the Dandupalyam batch murderers,

384
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:02,954
arrested a week back, before the media.

385
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,731
This batch is notorious as
cold blooded murderers.

386
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:09,392
Public groups are demanding to encounter

387
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:14,455
and hang these dreaded
murderers in public.

388
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:15,239
It's live.

389
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,816
-Hey!
-Am I looking handsome?

390
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:21,136
There are intelligence bureau reports
that, there could be an attack...

391
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,143
-Will they kill?
-...these may be killed any time.

392
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,352
They are media, right?
They will have their reports.

393
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,542
-Hey, are you laying a death bed for me?
-Believe me.

394
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,120
In unison: [gasps]

395
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,844
Hey, their men are coming.
Runaway.

396
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:34,260
-Will they kill me?
-Hey!

397
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,572
-Hey!
-Hey!

398
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,557
He is the main leader
of Dandupalyam batch.

399
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:40,883
Me?

400
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,376
It is not me.

401
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:43,698
Kill that fellow.

402
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,620
Runaway!

403
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:48,277
Hey!

404
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:51,245
Hey, it is not me dude.
I beg you.

405
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,043
Who are you, guys?

406
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,806
Oh no, he hit me

407
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,361
Bro, I beg you.
I don't belong to Dandupalyam batch.

408
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:00,683
I am from Punganur.

409
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:04,603
[indistinct voices]

410
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:06,650
Oh my God!
He is killing.

411
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,697
-Hey, I'm not aware of anything!
-[indistinct voices]

412
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,592
[stabbing]

413
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:13,684
-Hey!
-[shouts]

414
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:19,127
They are chopping as if
they are some vegetables.

415
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,163
[shouts]

416
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:25,193
You get in. Aunty, come fast...
they are dropping bombs.

417
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:25,825
Come on.

418
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:27,185
Move, where is Eswari aunty?

419
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,519
Hey Eswari aunty,
have you come for marriage to walk slowly?

420
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,948
-Hell with you idiots!
-Move-in faster.

421
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:33,940
[explosion]
[screams]

422
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,853
Hey, I am not from Dandupalyam batch.

423
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,248
I just did this role just for time pass.

424
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:47,306
-Don't come closer. Hey, it is not me.
-Hey!

425
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:48,469
[gun shots]
[groans]

426
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:57,983
Boss, you would have been to
the buffalo of Yama by now.

427
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,677
-Boss, you are an Everest in acting.
-Thank you.

428
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,049
Aunty, at least you say to our boss.

429
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,734
Hey, do you have any sense at all?

430
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:15,014
If you are crazy for acting then
you should go and act in films,

431
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,276
but why are you doing
all of these at a court?

432
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,274
Brother-in-law, what happened now?
Why are you so angry? Sit down.

433
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:20,695
Uncle, four cups of tea.

434
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,127
It is coming, son.

435
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,649
-Hey, Khasim...
-Sir.

436
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:27,317
Bring four cups of tea
quickly to table six.

437
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,032
Yes, sir.

438
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:34,689
Brother-in-law, who is it?

439
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,114
He is the great Rajpal.

440
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:37,118
Rajpal?

441
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:46,757
-[clamour]
-Wait...

442
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:57,555
Move... Move aside.

443
00:24:57,692 --> 00:25:00,133
Hey you, move... Move aside.

444
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:01,189
Please.

445
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,382
-Move aside, please.
-Move aside.

446
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:25,130
Six thousand four hundred and sixteen.

447
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,323
The number of accidents occurred
in Hyderabad last year are,

448
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:32,518
six thousand four hundred and sixteen.

449
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:34,780
But I have a doubt, your honor.

450
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,406
How many from them are remembered
by those sitting here?

451
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,070
But from the past six months,

452
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:44,424
it feels like total media has
focused on just one single accident.

453
00:25:45,383 --> 00:25:48,202
The so-called Toyota
Fortuner hit and run case.

454
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:53,489
Which involves the most respected and
the law-abiding families of the city.

455
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,006
Because making these as headlines,

456
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,935
circulation of papers and
TRPs of channels rise high.

457
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:05,074
Everyone tries to blame
the rich in our country.

458
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:08,420
The reason is jealousy.

459
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:14,725
But your honor, not even a single
proof is found in relation to this case.

460
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:17,567
The proofs must exist to present.

461
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:22,854
The name of my client Rohit is added
two days after the FIR is prepared.

462
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,970
Why?

463
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:29,712
It is never been proved that Rohit was
present at the accident site. Never!

464
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,210
Your honor,

465
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:33,163
though the case is
running from six months,

466
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:38,526
the prosecution could not
present at least one evidence till now.

467
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,241
None has directly witnessed this accident.

468
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:42,801
Before I forget,

469
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,409
where is the great
imaginary Toyota Fortuner,

470
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:48,218
in this Toyota Fortuner
hit and run case?

471
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:51,641
By the way, as per the report
of Sub-inspector Patnaik,

472
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,417
a truck caused this accident, not a car.

473
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,849
Sir, you have the
investigation reports with you.

474
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,588
-Ok, I too have that copy.
-Yes, sir.

475
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,592
Your honor,

476
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:07,256
media and prosecution are unnecessarily
making this case a sensation.

477
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,075
There is no single evidence
or proof... Nothing.

478
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:10,789
In fact, there is no scope in
this case at all, your honor.

479
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:17,448
It is crystal clear that Rohit's name
is involved in this case purposefully.

480
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:18,777
Your honor.

481
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:22,976
Rohit caused this accident and the
court should not believe him as innocent.

482
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:24,113
What would it believe then?

483
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:27,440
This is a court, speak only if
you have proofs and evidence.

484
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:29,912
I am demanding for proofs.

485
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:30,942
Where is the evidence?

486
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,610
Where is that Toyota Fortuner and
where are the witnesses? Huh?

487
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,384
All of you have come to an understanding.

488
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,385
When you file a case
on such rich families,

489
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,964
you assume that they fear, come for a
compromise and give you money.

490
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,501
This is what you expected, isn't it?

491
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:50,444
And now the media outside the court.

492
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,700
They have nothing to do
with any proof or inquiry.

493
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,302
Full of a publicity stunt!

494
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,245
Let me remind you, Mr. Prosecutor.

495
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,759
This is not a media trial,
this is a real trial.

496
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,831
[gasps]

497
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:06,908
There is no value for the
judgments of media in this country.

498
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,811
Judgment by the judge
sitting there is the final.

499
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:12,993
That is all, your honor.

500
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,624
You still have not lost the touch of your
passionate speeches, Mr. Rajpal.

501
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:17,687
I am impressed.

502
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:18,715
Thank you, your honor.

503
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,833
Mr. Apparao, any further submission?

504
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,986
Your honor,
if court gives me some time,

505
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:33,220
I am planning to re-investigate
on some points in this case.

506
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:34,983
How much more time do you need?
Sit down.

507
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:36,193
Okay.

508
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,985
As the prosecution could not prove
that Rohit caused this accident,

509
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,054
the case is closed and judgment is
being given that Rohit is innocent.

510
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:45,862
Yes, I won.

511
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:47,352
-That is Rajpal.
-The court is adjourned.

512
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:51,273
Congratulations.
[clapping]

513
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:52,090
Sir, hello.

514
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:54,042
-That was awesome, good.
-Thank you.

515
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,530
Thank you, Mr. Rajpal.

516
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,464
Yes.

517
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:58,448
Love you, uncle.

518
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:00,561
Come Sunny

519
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:01,859
-Meet you soon.
-Hey, come guys.

520
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,581
Sir...
Sir, I am your big fan.

521
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:06,209
My name is Sapthagiri.
I am also an advocate, sir.

522
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,905
Sir, what I could not learn
from 3 years in college,

523
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:10,364
you said it great in just three minutes,
sir.

524
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:11,830
Wow, you argued great sir.

525
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,038
Having heard about you all these days
and when I could see you directly today...

526
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:16,544
Whoa! It's overwhelming sir!

527
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:17,649
I need your blessings, sir.

528
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,401
-May I go?
-Sure.

529
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,175
Sir...
Bless our boy, sir.

530
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,186
-Hey, damn! Idiots!
-Sir, please bless me.

531
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:27,202
-Sir, please bless me.
-Sir.

532
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,536
-Madam, please bless him.
-Madam, please bless me.

533
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,193
-Hey, you damn!
-Hey!

534
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,185
You leave, madam.

535
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,633
Idiots, you just ruined our image.

536
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:38,519
Lawyer sir, you have
finally saved our prestige.

537
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:40,820
Rohit is the future of our family.

538
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:45,875
I must say, he is all
gone by this grandfather.

539
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:49,802
Still, such mistakes do
take place in his age.

540
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:53,592
But doesn't mean we spend our
lives going around the courts.

541
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,650
I completely agree with you, Diwan sir.

542
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:58,430
Who hasn't committed a
mistake in this country?

543
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,534
Foot paths are not built to sleep.

544
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:03,035
Still, what our Rohit did
was a service to nation.

545
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:06,780
He cleaned the waste on the
foot path and threw it to aside.

546
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,956
Correct!

547
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:08,703
Yogi...

548
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:12,080
Yes, Rajpal.
Here is your full and final settlement.

549
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,426
And thank you very much.

550
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,285
Sir... cheque...

551
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,132
What happened, any problem?

552
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:20,963
But we agreed upon a
different amount, isn't it?

553
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,982
There are so many people involved in this
case and I should satisfy all of them.

554
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:26,147
But, take it.

555
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,847
You can satisfy all them with this money.

556
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:32,327
And do not be greedy, greed is not good.

557
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:36,053
But still this case is
closed in just six months, right?

558
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:39,086
Even your heir has returned
in six months, right?

559
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:41,661
Yogi... make it thirty.

560
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,313
Rajpal uncle.

561
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:45,854
Hey!

562
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:49,542
-I am very happy today.
-Good.

563
00:30:49,642 --> 00:30:50,943
It is all because of you.

564
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:55,822
Dad, pay ten lakhs to uncle.

565
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:58,455
It's thirty lakhs not ten lakhs.

566
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:00,764
What, thirty lakhs?

567
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,057
-For blabbering for just five minutes...
-No, that is not right.

568
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,533
It's for arguing.

569
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:07,386
Be happy.

570
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:08,842
-Diwan, sir.
-Hmm.

571
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,765
Thank you, thank you very much.

572
00:31:13,442 --> 00:31:15,088
-Take care of your health.
-Okay.

573
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:22,486
Bye.

574
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:31,211
"Take the offering...
Oh uncle, take this offering"

575
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:33,921
"Oh uncle, take this offering"

576
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:36,688
Shut up!

577
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:39,466
Look Apparao bro,
you lost and what do you say now?

578
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:47,482
-"Oh Rajpal sir..."
-Exactly!

579
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:48,432
Exactly!

580
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,067
"Those eyes resemble the owl,
hey Rajpal..."

581
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,101
Come on!

582
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:59,782
"The voice resembles roar of the lion,
hey Rajpal"

583
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:04,558
"He always keeps saying 'fire' and 'relax"

584
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:05,683
JUDGMENT OF HIT AND RUN
CASE WITHOUT THE EYE WITNESS

585
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,654
DISSATISFACTION AMONG
BEGGARS WITH THE COURT JUDGMENT

586
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,505
JUDGMENT OF HIT AND RUN
CASE WITHOUT THE EYE WITNESS

587
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,807
DISSATISFACTION AMONG
BEGGARS WITH COURT JUDGMENT

588
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:20,288
Hey Tippu.

589
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,416
Have they closed this case
because there was no eye witness?

590
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:24,682
Boss, it is Rajpal on the other side.

591
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:28,402
Even if there is an eye witness,
judgment comes in favor of Rajpal.

592
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:29,560
What if the eyewitness is brought in?

593
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,053
It is still difficult, boss.

594
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,960
My father-in-law is says that
he would not get me married,

595
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:34,371
to Chitti unless I win a case.

596
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,268
What if I put a PIL on this case and win?

597
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:37,369
Give it a try, boss.

598
00:32:58,828 --> 00:33:01,525
[music mutes voice]

599
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:21,862
-Advance congrats, boss.
-Thank you.

600
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:23,960
-Shake hands one after the another.
-Thank you, thank you.

601
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,256
-Thank you.
-Boss, all the best.

602
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:29,587
-Hey boss, they are our aunts.
-Hey, order tea for all.

603
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:30,200
What about the money then?

604
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,867
-We will pay through Paytm.
-Oh, is it?

605
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,715
-Hey bring tea.
-Hey Giri!

606
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:35,670
-Hey!
-Uncle.

607
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,586
-Bujjulu, how are you?
-I am good.

608
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,157
A small gift from uncle for you.

609
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:40,974
Yeah!

610
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:45,078
This looks like a broken piece of pencil
and do you call this as a chocolate?

611
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,127
And that's my financial situation, dear.

612
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:48,651
I just filed a PIL in the court.

613
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,107
Let me win that case and I will make
you open a chocolate factory.

614
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,843
No need, it is time for my school.

615
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:54,331
-She has gone by my Vani sister.
-Bye daddy, bye uncle.

616
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,142
Bye.

617
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,626
Hell with your success! It seems
you've filed a PIL against to Rajpal?

618
00:33:57,742 --> 00:33:59,892
-His nonsense has started.
-What do you know about Rajpal?

619
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,366
Ok, tell us what you know.

620
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:04,865
He can prove that sea has no salt
and that the Sun rises in the West.

621
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,471
Brother-in-law,
I somehow put a PIL to win and

622
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,390
why are you discouraging
instead of encouraging?

623
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,976
This is just my trial with
the blessings of the God.

624
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,072
That is your ignorance.

625
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:13,613
You idiot, it is Rajpal there.

626
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,710
Brother-in-law,
I just tried.

627
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,355
I will either succeed or
it will be an experience.

628
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,832
Listen to me...

629
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:20,970
Hey...

630
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,642
Who is Sapthagiri here?

631
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:40,407
It is me, sir.

632
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,860
Why did you file this PIL?

633
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,454
The Police have investigated.

634
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,450
Even the previous Judge might
have given a good judgment.

635
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:50,774
Why do you need a
reinvestigation? A mere waste of time.

636
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:54,022
Your honor, it was clearly
written in Eenadu paper last Friday.

637
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:58,041
That the cops have hidden many truths
in this case and got the case closed.

638
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,765
They even ran hours of
programs even in news channels.

639
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,943
Even interviews of the
eyewitness were printed in paper.

640
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,312
But no eye witness was called to
court and inquired, your honor.

641
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,879
Hey, wait man.

642
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,006
What is your name?

643
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,903
Sapthagiri, LLB.

644
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,827
Where did you study LLB?

645
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,539
Punganur.

646
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,108
BRGJ Law College.

647
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,214
Has none taught you there that the media
stories will not be accepted in the court?

648
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,622
Yes, they taught me.

649
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:28,468
Why do you nod? Say something.

650
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,716
What is this?
You wrote appeal as apple.

651
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:36,522
You wrote prosecution as prostitution.

652
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:38,424
My ill fate, what is this?

653
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:40,577
How can I accept this if there are
five mistakes every line? Damn!

654
00:35:40,777 --> 00:35:43,000
I subject, your honor.
I subject.

655
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:44,926
Where are you all
specimen from?

656
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,843
It's object but not subject!

657
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:49,888
Yes, I said the same.
I said subject.

658
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,391
When my boss wants to win
a case against a big guy,

659
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,383
instead of encouraging why are
you making fun of him?

660
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,492
Hey, what is your name?

661
00:35:58,692 --> 00:35:59,827
Shakalaka Shankar.

662
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,033
The name sounds different.

663
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,270
Thank you, your honor.

664
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,276
Go to that corner and kneel
down to wall till the case ends.

665
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,748
This is your punishment.

666
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:12,423
Will you talk as you like with a judge?
Huh?

667
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:14,668
Your honor, what I mistaken?

668
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:15,483
Boss, tell him.

669
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:17,752
I do not know who he is.

670
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:21,473
Oh no, sir. I just replaced my knees
as the old were worn away.

671
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,481
They are not available anywhere
here, made in Barampur.

672
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,247
I beg you, please show mercy.

673
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:29,382
Okay,
go and kneel down till this evening.

674
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:30,815
[gasps] Till the evening?

675
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:33,686
-Sir, show some more mercy.
-Do you still feel funny? Get away.

676
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,307
I will do it.

677
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:38,534
Not showing your back
dear, turn this way..

678
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:39,438
Oh!

679
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:42,987
What is that sound?

680
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:46,165
I didn't fart.
My pants ripped.

681
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,400
Oh God, you are a great guy!

682
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:49,573
Come on lift your hands up.

683
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:52,673
What is it, again?

684
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:56,679
I farted now.
I had dal rice.

685
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,809
You should be careful
before coming to the court.

686
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:01,773
Your honor, you may have to
suffer if you do not leave me.

687
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,963
[laughing]

688
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,960
Order...

689
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,775
Sapthagiri, you tell me.

690
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:10,033
Sir, I will get the
evidence if you give me some time.

691
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:13,013
Don't you know that you can file the
case only after having the evidence?

692
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,088
You wasted the court's time.

693
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,178
I am giving you two days time.

694
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,931
-Okay.
-If you do not bring evidence by then,

695
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:25,862
I will throw your PIL in the dustbin.

696
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,129
Boss, will you not go home?

697
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,724
-You go Tippu, I will come.
-Okay, bye.

698
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,874
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

699
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:39,988
-Mr. Sapthagiri...
-It's me.

700
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,704
Is it you who filed the PIL
in that Rohit case?

701
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,400
Yes, it's me..
Do you have any problem?

702
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:48,246
Problem? No, sir.
I felt happy.

703
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:51,919
My name is Albert Pinto, sir.
I stay in Vijayawada.

704
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,117
I have a small business and so
I regularly travel to Hyderabad.

705
00:37:56,817 --> 00:38:00,999
On that night of January
20th, I was in city.

706
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,124
While I was returning to the
hotel after watching a film,

707
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,187
that accident took place in
front of my eyes, sir.

708
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,078
I am the one and only witness
remaining in this case, sir.

709
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,651
What have you done all these days, sir?

710
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,353
I did, sir.

711
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,775
I did everything that
a common man should do.

712
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,025
I went to the Police station
and gave a complaint.

713
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:20,379
Do you have the complaint copy?

714
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:24,525
They said that they would call me.

715
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:26,215
They didn't call me till date.

716
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,603
Will you come to the court
and give the witness?

717
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:30,102
If there is a daring
lawyer like you behind me,

718
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,721
I will come anywhere and do anything,
sir.

719
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:38,537
Rajpal, you are done.

720
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:45,846
A new twist in the Toyota
Fortuner hit and run case.

721
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:49,565
Lawyer Sapthagiri filed the PIL,

722
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:52,797
submitted new affidavit and created
a sensation in this accident case.

723
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,925
Sapthagiri said to the media
that he has an eye witness,

724
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,414
named Albert Pinto in this case.

725
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,421
The court accepted the affidavit

726
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:02,950
and ordered Advocate Rajpal
on the side of the convict,

727
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,736
to attend in person for
the next adjournment.

728
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,786
As a challenge for judiciary system,

729
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,756
Sapthagiri, LLB reopened the Toyota
Fortuner hit and run case standing.

730
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,281
The weapon in the hands of Sapthagiri
is the eye witness Albert Pinto.

731
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,215
By filing PIL against the
great senior most advocate Rajpal,

732
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,185
Sapthagiri, LLB has
become an overnight star.

733
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:23,668
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT

734
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,511
Oh, Mr. Rajpal!

735
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,490
Have you come?

736
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,501
Not just the supreme
court and the high court...

737
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,200
Please keep visiting the
lower courts too, sir.

738
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,292
We would boast that a great
lawyer like you came and argued here.

739
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,792
Nothing as such sir,
I have been little tired up.

740
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:45,983
-My Lord.
-Tell me.

741
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,160
I meant, we have the eye
witness, Albert Pinto...

742
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,808
Who is the eye witness?

743
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,988
But I already submitted
in the affidavit sir.

744
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:52,895
Where is he?

745
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:53,707
He is here.

746
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,772
Call him if he is here.
Is he that Pinto?

747
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,721
-Go. All the best, Pinto.
-Come on man, come on.

748
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,542
Albert Pinto.

749
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,468
Name sounds different.

750
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:07,275
Your height and weight are good.

751
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:09,175
Do you play any Pro Kabaddi?

752
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,583
No, sir.
I just have a business.

753
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:13,709
-Sir.
-Business?

754
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,560
-Mr. Albert Pinto.
-Yes, sir.

755
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,340
As said in your affidavit,

756
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:26,817
on the night of the accident, you were
there and moreover you saw Rohit too?

757
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:27,692
Yes, sir.

758
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:31,054
Look man,
where did the accident take place?

759
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:32,174
Punjagutta, sir.

760
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,362
When did it take place?

761
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:38,316
On January 20th,
Friday night at around 1:00 am.

762
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,358
What were you doing there at that time?

763
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,900
I was returning from
the second show movie.

764
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:43,942
Which movie?

765
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,231
Khaidi number 150.

766
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,329
Is it Chiranjeevi's film?

767
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,483
Your honor, Police complaint coffee...

768
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:51,067
It's not coffee man but a copy.

769
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:55,765
Yes, I already submitted the same
copy and the cinema tickets.

770
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:58,404
Okay.

771
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:01,929
Mr. Rajpal, do you want to say anything?

772
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,203
Your honor,

773
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,533
before I say anything please
arrange an AC here.

774
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,203
-It is sweating here.
-Is it?

775
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:09,483
How are you even
working for eight hours here?

776
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,650
It is just going on like this, sir.

777
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,567
It has been two months since we
applied to the government for an AC

778
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,144
and there is no response till date.

779
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:19,223
The fan is working
and that is a boon for us.

780
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,785
Leave all that, do you have
anything to say in this regard?

781
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:26,256
I haven't seen the affidavit as I had been
to Shimla with family for summer trip.

782
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,180
I would appreciate if you
could give us another day.

783
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:31,070
Mr. Sapthagiri,
you have no objections, right?

784
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:33,874
I have no objection,
sir but I have a small request.

785
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:37,307
If you can call Rohit for the next
adjournment, Albert would identify him.

786
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:38,791
And the case would close fast, sir.

787
00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:44,916
Mr. Sapthagiri, this is a court and
nothing here would close fast.

788
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:48,900
I do not understand on what grounds
is my client being further victimized.

789
00:41:49,108 --> 00:41:51,926
Mr. Rajpal, I am here right?

790
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:53,648
You do not get tensed.

791
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:57,715
There is no need for your client
to be present in the court.

792
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,264
But why?

793
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,858
But,
he is an youngster and gets bored at home.

794
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:02,813
If he is brought in here,

795
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:06,100
he would visit the court
and have some fresh air too.

796
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,400
I am adjourning this case to the 10th
date and we shall meet then.

797
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:15,942
Mr. Rajpal, they gave order to let Rohit
be present for the next date, right?

798
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:17,126
-What are your comments on this?
-[indistinct voices]

799
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:19,095
Well, we will respect the
court orders and what else?

800
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,252
What if Albert Pinto identifies Rohit?

801
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,983
If you ask these silly questions,
he will identify you.

802
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,084
Do you know what evidence does he have?

803
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,292
Do you know?

804
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:31,045
Is it the cinema ticket?
Khaidi Number 150!

805
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,108
Come with some smart questions, please.

806
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:36,154
-Sir, one minute, please...
-[indistinct voices]

807
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,924
-Hey, Mr Sapthagiri is here.
-[indistinct voices]

808
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:40,221
Tell us, sir.

809
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:41,317
-Mr Sapthgiri.
-Yes.

810
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,692
Are you taking the proceedings today
in the court as a small victory?

811
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:44,650
Yes, why not?

812
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:47,150
We treat this as our first victory.

813
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:48,025
Yes!

814
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,938
In addition, suspect Rohit
is called to the court means that,

815
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,293
...we partly succeeded in this case.

816
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:57,275
Sir, we wish to do a special
program on this case at our studios.

817
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:57,942
Can you come?

818
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,108
-Yes, we will come. Why not?
-Thank you, sir.

819
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:00,971
Will you arrange a car?

820
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:01,533
Sure, sir.

821
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:03,150
-What about the lunch in the afternoon?
-Yes, sir.

822
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:03,942
In unison: Then we will come.

823
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,486
-Sir, still.
-Yes, take.

824
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,147
Our boss is not less in posing.

825
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,817
He spends half his time
of practice for this.

826
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:09,983
Remove the glasses.
Rock it.

827
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,733
Come on change the pose...
Great boss!

828
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,921
Uncle, for whom is such a big chamber?

829
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,582
For the future lawyer, Sapthagiri.

830
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:32,351
Have you vacated half your
canteen and made a chamber for me?

831
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:35,733
Hey son, you are arguing a very big case.

832
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:40,108
You need so many facilities
to compete with that Rajpal.

833
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,650
I have been waiting from these 16
years to see the man to oppose him.

834
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:47,733
A man to oppose him
has come after so long.

835
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:48,442
Yes.

836
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,658
Though you are new,
you were ready to fight.

837
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:51,332
Yes.

838
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:55,608
I see something in you.
You will win for sure.

839
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:58,031
You should win.

840
00:43:58,442 --> 00:43:59,238
Bless me, uncle.

841
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:03,361
God will give the best, son.

842
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:04,859
He would do for sure.

843
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:09,442
Yes.

844
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,193
You rocked it, Giri.
Really nice of you.

845
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,818
Brother-in-law, all of you are like ATM

846
00:44:14,887 --> 00:44:16,958
and I am like Paytm
and thus developed fast.

847
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:19,172
-Anyway, congratulations.
-It is okay but...

848
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,025
...what is the story of this Rahim uncle?

849
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:27,650
Rahim uncle? See that girl in the photo,
she is his daughter.

850
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,275
She is Reshma and is a good topper.

851
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:32,067
Mayor's son and his
friends molested and killed her.

852
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,233
Rajpal gave entered at the time when
their punishment was almost confirmed.

853
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,345
You know about Rajpal, right?

854
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:41,358
He reversed all the witnesses and
brought all of them out as innocents.

855
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:43,339
Despite being in the Judiciary system,

856
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,152
with the pain of not being able
to do justice to their girl

857
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,174
his health deteriorated and
he is running the canteen.

858
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:48,836
But, he is a loyal person.

859
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,804
Anyway, you are great as
you impressed such a person.

860
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,525
-Anyway, call mother once.
-Okay.

861
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:59,185
Congrats boss, all the beggars
of city came to meet you.

862
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:00,198
Where are they?

863
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:02,184
-In unison: Greetings, sir.
-Greetings.

864
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:03,442
My dear beggars!

865
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:07,756
As I filed a PIL and am fighting
for in order to do justice to you,

866
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,798
do not try to felicitate me.

867
00:45:09,898 --> 00:45:11,856
-Sir, what we wanted to say is...
-You do not say anything.

868
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:16,076
I can understand the pain in your
heart by looking into your eyes.

869
00:45:16,176 --> 00:45:17,682
You will get the
justice and that's all!

870
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,464
-Brother, that is...
-Sister.

871
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:23,929
in this Hyderabad city at every center,
temple, street and junction,

872
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:28,688
I will fight towards a ten rupee donation
is made once you raise the hand and beg.

873
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,233
The footpaths on which you got injustice,

874
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,358
I'll fight with the government and get you
documents saying that they are your own.

875
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,067
Hey big beggar, from today the
footpaths are yours, they are yours.

876
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:40,942
It's not that, sir.
Listen to what we are saying...

877
00:45:40,983 --> 00:45:43,483
Come on, what?
What are you blabbering?

878
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:45,858
By any chance, will you pay me
the money you begged as fees?

879
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:46,966
Hey Tippu, send them away.

880
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:49,208
-Hey, move guys...
-Hey, move guys...

881
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:51,733
Hello... Chitti...

882
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:54,483
I didn't get the signal.

883
00:45:55,233 --> 00:45:56,442
Chitti, am I audible?

884
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,610
Hello

885
00:45:58,713 --> 00:46:00,044
Hello, brother-in-law...

886
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:00,813
Chitti.

887
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:03,900
Do you know I recently filed a PIL
in the court and became a superstar.

888
00:46:03,942 --> 00:46:06,363
All my colleagues and
media are talking about me.

889
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:09,675
I was seen in the media and you
know how handsome was I?

890
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:12,805
Is it, brother-in-law?
Meanwhile, I wore a sari today.

891
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:14,047
Wow, Chitti.

892
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,846
You look very beautiful in a saree.
By the way, what is special?

893
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:19,175
My father has arranged
alliance for me.

894
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:20,791
Alliance?

895
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:22,013
But I did not agree.

896
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,594
I hit him bad and sent
him away, brother-in-law.

897
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:31,076
-[gibberish]
-In unison: Buzz off!

898
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:34,127
Look Chitti, I am missing you.

899
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:35,298
I love you, Chitti.

900
00:46:35,498 --> 00:46:36,288
I love you too.

901
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:53,686
"For the sound of the
bangles on the hand"

902
00:46:53,742 --> 00:46:57,412
"Heart is flying like a kite"

903
00:46:59,178 --> 00:47:04,348
"Hey, it is a disturbance in the heart"

904
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:07,881
"Seeing your nose stud"

905
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:11,652
"It is great even in fasting"

906
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:15,638
"Hey, what is this?"

907
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:18,580
"Earth and sky are upside down"

908
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,615
"Hey sister-in-law, love you"

909
00:47:22,147 --> 00:47:25,661
"Hey... Hey..."

910
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,803
"Hey... Hey..."

911
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:32,339
"Hey... Hey..."

912
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:35,877
"Hey... Hey..."

913
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:54,201
"It is a love game"

914
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:57,476
"And the moon is my maternal uncle"

915
00:47:57,576 --> 00:48:01,236
"This game of shy and love"

916
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:04,560
"Is very surprising at this moment"

917
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,875
"Hey, evil-eyed lady,
I fell in your love"

918
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,895
"Oh!"

919
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:16,109
"I ruined a lot in your thoughts"

920
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,086
"Hey lovely babe"

921
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:36,798
-"Hey, Sapthagiri has got the phone"
-"Phone"

922
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,379
-"His sister-in-law, Chitti called him"
-"Chitti"

923
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:43,906
-"She conveyed about alliance"
-"The matter"

924
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:47,465
-"Groom has come for the marriage"
-"Groom"

925
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:51,111
-"She put him a flower"
-"Flower"

926
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:54,891
-"Chitti's father became a scape goat"
-"A scape goat"

927
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:05,233
"The beautiful lip has asked in greed"

928
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,525
"The size zero waist has asked to pinch"

929
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:19,596
"Your sharp looks are like..."

930
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:22,806
"...celebrations in
the heart of the boy"

931
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,602
"In between your waterfalls like hair,"

932
00:49:26,674 --> 00:49:29,911
"My life is disturbed"

933
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:36,183
"Come Chitti,
I will take care of you like a queen"

934
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:38,193
"Oh!"

935
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:44,192
"Shall I hold your finger,
whistle and turn as your hubby?"

936
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:50,275
"Hey, evil-eyed lady,
I fell in your love"

937
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,428
"Oh!"

938
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:55,676
"I ruined a lot in your thoughts"

939
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:58,450
"Hey lovely babe"

940
00:50:16,025 --> 00:50:18,983
Sapthagiri...!
Who the hell is this Sapthagiri?

941
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,568
He is nothing, nobody!

942
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:23,483
After all, just one SMS is
enough to close him down.

943
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,206
Just one SMS... That is it!

944
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:27,248
Then do it.

945
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:29,126
But the problem here is not Sapthagiri.

946
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,713
Albert Pinto!

947
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:34,067
Honest bloody citizen!

948
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:36,539
What can Sapthagiri do if he is not there?

949
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:38,817
It's because of that Albert Pinto.

950
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:43,144
The total media is again
focusing on this case.

951
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:45,678
Albert Pinto!

952
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:59,171
[train honking]

953
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:02,807
-Sapthgiri.
-Hmm.

954
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:04,635
What is this suddenly, brother?

955
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:10,242
I mean, I am a bit tensed thinking
of the court and witness tomorrow.

956
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,983
Of course, it has to be.
Is this any normal case?

957
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:15,807
The entire media would
focus on us tomorrow.

958
00:51:15,912 --> 00:51:18,692
You just identify the accused
Rohit in the court tomorrow

959
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,608
and entire court will cheer.

960
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,034
I will show my power,
and justice prevails.

961
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:28,423
By chance,
if I do not identify Rohit in the court?

962
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:32,733
-What if I give witness against you?
-Bro, you are unnecessarily scared.

963
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:36,317
Both of us would become big fools if
you do even a small mistake tomorrow.

964
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:37,650
Please be cool and be brave.

965
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,119
I will take care of anything.

966
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:40,435
I am here and please believe me.

967
00:51:40,692 --> 00:51:42,733
Brother, you are not understanding.

968
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:45,108
They are very big people.

969
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:46,680
And more dangerous people than that.

970
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,233
Our lives would go upside down
if something goes wrong tomorrow.

971
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,108
We cannot bear it.

972
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,001
Brother, justice is on our side no
matter how big or dangerous they are.

973
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:57,716
We are fighting for the
beggars living on the roads.

974
00:51:57,816 --> 00:51:58,742
Let us fight for the justice.

975
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:01,192
Justice!

976
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,071
I am not a fool to
not to understand,

977
00:52:07,343 --> 00:52:11,380
whether you are fighting for justice or
the experience or for the publicity.

978
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,069
Okay, ignore this nuisance, brother.

979
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,138
I will directly come to the point.

980
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:25,777
I had a deal with Rohit's
family for 2 crores.

981
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:29,275
And 10% for you.

982
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:30,999
That means 20 lakhs.

983
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:31,942
What do you say?

984
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,358
Brother, what is in money?

985
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,650
Let us win this case tomorrow
and see the fame we get.

986
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,576
Money too will automatically
follow with that.

987
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:39,882
Yet they came for a
compromise with the money means,

988
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:41,296
they lost half of this case.

989
00:52:41,396 --> 00:52:43,025
Please brother,
be with me tomorrow in the court.

990
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:45,294
I will make that Rajpal
go weak in the knees.

991
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:52,764
-Is that Rajpal afraid of you?
-Hmm.

992
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,786
-Shall we both together get Rajpal scared?
-Hmm.

993
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:04,048
You exactly proved to have come
from a village, brother.

994
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,292
So cute!

995
00:53:07,983 --> 00:53:08,977
Do you know who I am?

996
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,280
I am the man of Rajpal.

997
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:23,017
I actually did not go to any police
station nor did I watch watch any movie.

998
00:53:23,858 --> 00:53:26,240
I do not have any relation
with this case at all.

999
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,605
All this is Rajpal's screenplay.

1000
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:33,145
And you are a dummy character in that.

1001
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:38,167
Still, you are very lucky, brother.

1002
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:41,192
You got so much publicity just
in a month after filing the PIL.

1003
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:44,044
Such a heavy payment
even when you are losing.

1004
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,322
You are somehow lucky.

1005
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,007
Yes, I remembered... by payment.

1006
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,087
Here are 4 lakhs.

1007
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:54,650
Take... Your advance!

1008
00:53:57,733 --> 00:53:59,139
Your hands are shivering.

1009
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:06,275
That is Rajpal.
Enjoy!

1010
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:12,125
Send an SMS to Rajpal sir saying
'Thank you, sir.'

1011
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:15,648
You will get a surprise
gift if he is happy.

1012
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:28,150
Wow...!
He is not an ordinary fellow...!

1013
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,775
He is not an ordinary fellow!

1014
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,343
I should learn a lot from him.

1015
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,536
You said that you would come to
the bus stand and didn't come.

1016
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:34,577
I felt bad, because of you.

1017
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,011
I thought the entire game was in
my hands but they fixed the match.

1018
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:40,036
Really hats off!

1019
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:42,851
Rajpal is genius and thus has
become number one lawyer in India.

1020
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:45,765
You know, there is nothing wrong in the
public bowing and saluting to him.

1021
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:46,662
He deserves it.

1022
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,201
He deserves to be in
that place, that is it.

1023
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:51,692
What happened?
Tell me clearly.

1024
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:54,209
I did not even understand whether
I won or lost in this deal.

1025
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:55,659
What is this deal,
brother-in-law?

1026
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,513
Our witness Albert Pinto
is the man of Rajpal.

1027
00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:01,810
He set the deal for 2 crores and
gave us an offer for 20 lakhs

1028
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,943
and gave an advance of 4 lakhs, you know?

1029
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:07,726
That means,
did you take a bribe brother-in-law?

1030
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,733
Hey!
Why do you say bribe?

1031
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:13,025
If I go, set a deal and then get money
from them, then it is called a bribe.

1032
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:14,983
But they have come and
put money in my hands.

1033
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,233
That means,
it is like I won in this case morally.

1034
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:21,261
You think so, but to say it
openly you behaved like a broker.

1035
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:22,190
Why do you say a broker?
[plate clunks]

1036
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:22,989
Mental!

1037
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:26,067
Yes, I am a broker and brought money.
For whom did I get it?

1038
00:55:26,275 --> 00:55:27,733
I brought it for you and for us.

1039
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,322
I brought for our future.

1040
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,136
Did you bring it for me?

1041
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:33,405
Did I ask for any cars or bungalows?

1042
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:35,233
I just wished that you should prosper.

1043
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:37,214
Is earning money not prospering?

1044
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:38,810
Should I not earn money to prosper?

1045
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:42,242
Is the money earned over the dead
bodies of the beggars called an income?

1046
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,420
I don't need you to take
care of me with that money.

1047
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:09,642
Mr. Rajpal,

1048
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,517
give this money to Pinto to settle
and get my son out from the case fast.

1049
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:16,183
Mr. Yogi.

1050
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:18,518
One second.

1051
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,058
What is this?

1052
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,017
For me to have blabbered... sorry.

1053
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:30,058
the cheque of 30 lakhs you
gave to me for arguing.

1054
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:34,933
I will take this only after getting
Rohit completely out of the case.

1055
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,084
No.

1056
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:52,308
Thank you so much.

1057
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,450
-Vivek.
-Yes, sir.

1058
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:01,183
Keep it inside.

1059
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:03,081
Vivek.

1060
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:04,100
Sir.

1061
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:06,392
You will not get greedy
seeing so much money, right?

1062
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:07,683
Do not be greedy.

1063
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:09,808
No sir, but you are a genius.

1064
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,183
What do you know the
meaning of greed, you fools?

1065
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,558
Your properties are not enough
to buy the brain of this Rajpal.

1066
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:23,808
I only demand what I deserve.

1067
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,350
Nobody can call me greedy.

1068
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,017
No sir, he is not that person.

1069
00:57:46,183 --> 00:57:49,388
Mr. Pinto,
it was you who wrote in the affidavit,

1070
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:51,702
that you saw Rohit that day night, right?

1071
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:55,975
Say the truth, is he Rohit or not?

1072
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:02,058
No, sir.

1073
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:03,767
I am sure.

1074
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:06,392
I am seeing him for the first time.

1075
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:09,814
I thought to identify seeing
the photo in the newspaper,

1076
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:11,861
but this is not him at all, sir.

1077
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:18,308
Mr. Pinto, you know how valuable is
your witness in this case, right?

1078
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:19,975
Of course, I know, sir.

1079
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:26,225
But for that we cannot get an innocent
guy into this case, right sir?

1080
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:30,642
Wow, well said.

1081
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:32,225
You are the right man
for these present times.

1082
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:36,308
Sapthagiri, do you wish to say anything?

1083
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,725
No, your honor, no arguments.

1084
00:58:51,058 --> 00:58:51,600
Thank you.

1085
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:54,169
When you have settled this
case somewhere outside,

1086
00:58:54,213 --> 00:58:55,481
why do you come to the Court then?

1087
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,100
Is it to strain our brains?

1088
00:58:57,475 --> 00:58:58,100
It is alright.

1089
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:00,475
I am adjourning this case to another date.

1090
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,644
-Sir, do you think you'd win this case?
-[indistinct voices]

1091
00:59:02,925 --> 00:59:04,373
As usual, we will win.

1092
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:06,433
Victory will be ours, okay?

1093
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:11,225
What Giri, it seems you
took 20 lakhs from Rajpal.

1094
00:59:11,642 --> 00:59:12,545
Who told you?

1095
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,161
Whole court is saying it aloud.

1096
00:59:14,256 --> 00:59:16,129
-Such matters cannot be hidden.
-Boss.

1097
00:59:17,475 --> 00:59:19,767
I heard that you earned lakhs.

1098
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,558
I love you, boss.
You are great boss. Mwah!

1099
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:22,690
-You are super boss.
-Hey, wait dude.

1100
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:24,225
Do you fail to understand?

1101
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:26,583
There should be some professional
ethics even to earn, you know?

1102
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:27,433
Oh no, ethics!

1103
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:29,392
You have been with the
black coat on from 10 years.

1104
00:59:29,475 --> 00:59:30,850
You will not allow earning even
a rupee in the wrong way.

1105
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,448
Our boss has just stepped in

1106
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:34,539
and has become a collection
king and a corruption king.

1107
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:35,669
-Damn!
-Boss, I am saying now...

1108
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:37,484
You are greater than that Rajpal.
Come on whistle, dude.

1109
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:43,683
Uncle.

1110
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,017
Uncle.

1111
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:08,975
As the eye witness Albert Pinto couldn't
identify the accused in the Rohit's case,

1112
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:11,350
this case has again come
to a closure state.

1113
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:12,850
The shocking news is that,

1114
01:00:13,058 --> 01:00:16,308
it seems like a settlement has taken place
between both the parties off record.

1115
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:19,834
That means, it is once again proved
that life of the poor is cheaper,

1116
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:21,009
than the car of rich.

1117
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:25,965
Legal analysts are saying that the reasons
behind lawyer Sapthagiri to file a PIL,

1118
01:00:26,094 --> 01:00:29,413
was to get popular and to earn money.

1119
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,954
After the court has adjourned,

1120
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:34,750
as both eye witness Albert Pinto
and lawyer Sapthagiri went missing,

1121
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,725
the doubts are further strengthened.

1122
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,290
Public committees are demanding
to suspend such lawyers,

1123
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:43,382
for lifetime from the bar council.

1124
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,604
To say openly you behaved
as a broker and did mediation

1125
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:49,642
Have I asked any cars or bungalows?

1126
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:51,600
I just wished that you should prosper.

1127
01:00:52,392 --> 01:00:53,977
Is the money earned over the
dead bodies of the beggars too,

1128
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:55,375
an income brother-in-law?

1129
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:57,767
I don't need you to take
care of me with that money.

1130
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:02,767
Hey son, you are arguing a big case.

1131
01:01:03,475 --> 01:01:08,100
I have been waiting from these
16 years for a guy to oppose that Rajpal.

1132
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:11,183
A man to oppose him
has come after so long.

1133
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,336
You will win for sure and should win.

1134
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,201
I heard that you took
20 lakhs from Rajpal?

1135
01:01:18,225 --> 01:01:20,367
You know, there should be some
professional ethics even to earn?

1136
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:22,574
Is the money earned over the
dead bodies of the beggars...

1137
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,249
-... too an income brother in law?
-I have been waiting from these 16 years,

1138
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:26,223
for a guy to oppose that Rajpal.

1139
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:28,033
You know, there should be some
professional ethics even to earn?

1140
01:01:28,133 --> 01:01:30,152
I don't need you to take care
of me with that money.

Congrats sir, God has shown mercy in
the form of Rajpal sir,

1147
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:46,058
and sent you a surprise gift

1148
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:48,392
Your future would change if
I say the features of this.

Bro, a second hand car is best
even if it is a tar or a mud road.

1152
01:02:56,225 --> 01:02:57,600
It goes very smooth to drive.

1153
01:02:58,058 --> 01:02:59,142
This is the car, bro.

1154
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,972
You drive this car from today and rock it,
bro.

Why do have get that emotional?

1160
01:03:23,975 --> 01:03:28,392
You should be very happy to be fighting
me just at the beginning of your career.

1161
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:29,267
I see!

1162
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:31,918
All the opposition
lawyers who lost over me,

1163
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,696
have kept my photo in
their respective chambers.

1164
01:03:35,058 --> 01:03:35,933
You too can have it.

1165
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:37,100
Oh!

1166
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:42,767
Public is speaking high of you,
as you have faced Tejendar Rajpal.

1167
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:43,975
I see.

1168
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:46,119
But, 20 lakhs is too huge for you.

1169
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,702
-I think your career is set. Leave!
-Oh!

am I telling a story?

-Hey!
-[gasps]

1173
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,618
What I am thinking is,

1174
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:05,818
if one's career is set
just by losing to you,

1175
01:04:06,018 --> 01:04:07,600
maybe our life gets set if I win over you.

1176
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:08,392
What do you say?

1177
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,958
That is why,
I went to the temple, prayed to God,

1178
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:14,498
distributed that bribe
money to those beggars.

1179
01:04:14,698 --> 01:04:17,267
I made a scrap out of your car.

1180
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:19,530
I came and sat before you
and I will win over you.

1181

What are you blabbering, idiot?

1182
01:04:25,433 --> 01:04:27,850
Now this guy Vivek,
had his first case with me.

I made him lose bad and now
he is holding the files.

Is it so, idiot?

is vacant and you can take that.

shoes or make you run without dress,

01:04:57,138 --> 01:04:59,048
You have gained good glamor with
the corrupted money, uncle.

1191
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:03,600
What idiot, don't you see the hierarchy?

1192
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:04,600
You think you can speak so rude
and step out of this office?

1193
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:34,761
Hey uncle, is that a smile?

1194
01:05:59,978 --> 01:06:00,537
Hey!

1195
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:31,773
[glass shattering]

1196
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:39,392
This is Yoga body and will play
kabaddi with everyone.

1197
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:40,808
Take the shot and you are out!

1198
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:44,892
I will aim and hit he bulls eye! Mind it!

1199
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:38,683
Hey!
Have you gone mad?

1200
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:40,496
You warned Rajpal it seems!

1201
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:42,767
It seems you had been to Rajpal's
office and hit his staff too?

1202
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,058
Brother-in-law,
he messed with the sober man,

1203
01:07:46,546 --> 01:07:49,020
I will see his end.

1204
01:07:49,225 --> 01:07:50,433
Only one of us, must be left.

1205
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:51,767
Will you not change at all?

1206
01:07:52,308 --> 01:07:53,600
He will change brother-in-law.

1207
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:54,734
Buzz off, you idiot?

1208
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:58,642
Look... I need the video footage
taken right after the accident.

1209
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,267
Will you do or not?

1210
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:03,517
Okay, I will do.

1211
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:07,614
"Hey Rathalu...!"

1212
01:08:07,745 --> 01:08:10,248
"Seeing you my shirt buttons say
they cannot stay intact anymore"

1213
01:08:10,348 --> 01:08:11,936
Hell with your song!

1214
01:08:11,986 --> 01:08:12,856
Who asked you to sing?

1215
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,337
You sing, Anasuya.

1216
01:08:14,537 --> 01:08:16,599
-"My shirt buttons"
-Correct.

1217
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:18,270
Though you are old, you sing pretty well.

1218
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,279
You will pay for this.

1219
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:20,893
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

1220
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:23,207
Be seated.

1221
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:27,758
Not bad, many turned up
for the SHO post's auction.

1222
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:31,072
You know the conditions required
for getting this post, don't you?

1223
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,892
Higher officials ordered me to give this
post to only those with a clean image

1224
01:08:35,392 --> 01:08:38,261
We will now see whose image is clean.

1225
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:39,915
Okay?
Yes!

1226
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:42,445
Why are you all looking at each
other like thieves?

1227
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:44,924
-First start the auction, sir.
-Why not!

1228
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:46,284
We should pray to God, right?

1229
01:08:46,384 --> 01:08:48,618
The Government rate is 10 lakhs.

1230
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:49,699
15 lakhs.

1231
01:08:49,768 --> 01:08:51,640
-20 lakhs.
-25 lakhs.

1232
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:52,956
-35 lakhs.
-[gasps]

1233
01:08:53,056 --> 01:08:55,987
Hey Babu Rao!
Have you gone deaf?

1234
01:08:56,187 --> 01:08:57,271
Didn't you listen?

1235
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,637
This is only for a guy with a
clean image but not for a cheater like you

1236
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,420
How dare you to teach me
growing weed in your own apartment?

1237
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,102
Hey, don't you dare to
blame me saying weed.

1238
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,217
What will you do, rascal?

1239
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:10,908
-[chaos]
-Hey...!

1240
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:13,640
Hold on...!

1241
01:09:13,808 --> 01:09:15,394
Come and be seated.
Sit down.

1242
01:09:15,594 --> 01:09:18,846
Sir, I will pay 40 lakhs.
Give me that post, sir.

1243
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:20,933
-Of course...
-I just have two years for retirement.

1244
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:22,109
Give that post only to me, sir.

1245
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:26,085
Hey old fellow, you fooled him thrice till
now and why do you want that post?

1246
01:09:26,285 --> 01:09:27,793
Hey, don't you have shame at all?

1247
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:30,180
You burnt your wife alive
along with your mother's help

1248
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,333
-and came out from jail on bail, right?
-Damn!

1249
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,642
I got clean chit long back in that case.

1250
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:36,725
Sir, do not give it to that fellow.

1251
01:09:36,892 --> 01:09:39,433
Sir, do not give him.
Give it to me.

1252
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,722
Both of you move.
Give that post to me, sir.

1253
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:43,986
Sir, give it to me.

1254
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:48,287
-Sir, give it to me...
-[indistinct voices]

1255
01:09:48,505 --> 01:09:49,190
Stop it

1256
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,933
Why are you fighting as
if you want a Jio sim?

1257
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,633
He says no for that guy and
he says not for this guy.

1258
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,759
Whom shall I give it then?

1259
01:09:56,094 --> 01:09:57,522
In unison: Give it to him, sir.

1260
01:10:01,924 --> 01:10:03,129
You must be lucky, dude.

1261
01:10:06,225 --> 01:10:08,517
Meanwhile Bhattacharya,
are there any cases filed against you?

1262
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:11,558
There was an eve teasing
case long back in 2006, sir.

1263
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:13,210
Eve teasing?

1264
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,506
-That is not any big scar.
-Is it?

1265
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:19,608
-Start the auction.
-65 lakhs, sir.

1266
01:10:19,808 --> 01:10:22,410
Going once, going twice...

1267
01:10:22,508 --> 01:10:24,226
In unison: Going thrice!

1268
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:25,892
Give it to him.

1269
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:27,859
You got it, idiot!

1270
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:30,762
-Hello, Guruji sir.
-Hello, Mr. Kiran.

1271
01:10:30,956 --> 01:10:32,877
-You asked the CD, right?
-Yes, sir.

1272
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:34,332
Who is he?

1273
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:35,803
He is my brother-in-law,
Sapthagiri.

1274
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,413
-Hello, Mr. Giri.
-Hello, sir.

1275
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:40,047
He started practice recently
and is fighting for the justice.

1276
01:10:40,147 --> 01:10:40,978
Yes, please do.

1277
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:43,046
If you arrange for that CD...

1278
01:10:43,642 --> 01:10:45,118
You asked as if it's a film CD.

1279
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,543
That is an accident CD.

1280
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,176
You know how many VIPs are behind that?

1281
01:10:48,376 --> 01:10:51,113
I'll lose my job if something goes wrong.

1282
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:52,625
We can't move ahead if
you deny for this sir.

1283
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:56,571
-You should do something.
-Yes, it can be done but...

1284
01:10:57,517 --> 01:10:58,183
It costs ten lakhs.

1285
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:58,767
-Ten?
-Ten?

1286
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:01,308
Why are so tensed as if
I asked some 10 crores.

1287
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:04,592
Forget 10 lakhs but somehow
manage with this 2 lakhs, sir.

1288
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,258
Two?

1289
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,433
Shall I cut the CD into half and give?

1290
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:07,720
Just two?

1291
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,683
Do one thing, give me 20% commission
in every case you take up for an year.

1292
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:12,808
20%?

1293
01:11:13,058 --> 01:11:14,748
Can't you pay me 20%?

1294
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,248
You will give. You will, right?

1295
01:11:16,348 --> 01:11:17,586
-20?
-Yes, very low.

1296
01:11:17,786 --> 01:11:18,301
Okay, sir.

1297
01:11:18,364 --> 01:11:19,328
Good!

1298
01:11:19,528 --> 01:11:20,710
Come tomorrow morning and take the CD.

1299
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,308
Your honor,
may I know what is happening here?

1300
01:11:40,707 --> 01:11:44,086
They brought Albert Pinto
last time and that guy...

1301
01:11:46,392 --> 01:11:48,933
And now they brought a fake
CD worth 10 rupees.

1302
01:11:49,475 --> 01:11:51,683
What exactly is the relation
of that CD to this case?

1303
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,767
Your honor, I think Mr. Rajpal
has not seen that CD properly.

1304
01:11:55,933 --> 01:11:57,428
Please rewind it once again,
sir.

1305
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,677
Stop, Stop...

1306
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:03,892
Your honor TS 09 EA 9999,

1307
01:12:04,117 --> 01:12:06,058
this car is registered on
the name of Yogi Diwan.

1308
01:12:06,267 --> 01:12:09,697
I already submitted those
registration and purchase papers.

1309
01:12:09,897 --> 01:12:10,842
Please look into them once, your honor.

1310
01:12:16,517 --> 01:12:17,606
Switch on the lights.

1311
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:26,642
Your honor, I wish to present the
constable shooting that video as witness.

1312
01:12:26,933 --> 01:12:28,169
With your permission, sir.

1313
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:31,350
Sorry, your honor.

1314
01:12:32,308 --> 01:12:35,328
Kids these days are becoming
lawyers without knowing the rules.

1315
01:12:35,528 --> 01:12:37,350
They are arguing in the
court watching films.

1316
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:40,362
-It would be so if all such fools...
-Who the hell is a fool here?

1317
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:41,412
...become lawyers.

1318
01:12:43,808 --> 01:12:46,528
You are asking to call
random people as witness...

1319
01:12:46,808 --> 01:12:51,350
Is this any function at your
house to invite all at your wish?

1320
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,611
[laughing]

1321
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:58,434
Before submitting a witness in the court,

1322
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:03,475
you have to submit advance notice to the
witness, court and the defense team.

1323
01:13:03,975 --> 01:13:07,767
You should present the witness only
after the court gives the permission to.

1324
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:10,850
You have come without knowing even this.

1325
01:13:11,042 --> 01:13:13,808
Your honor, I might have made a
mistake but please listen to me once.

1326
01:13:14,017 --> 01:13:16,642
Hey, we will meet again in
the next adjournment, Giri.

1327
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:19,017
Sir, please I beg you.

1328
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,225
I took a lot of effort to bring
the witness till court, sir.

1329
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,308
Please sir, understand! Please, sir...

1330
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:27,392
Don't irritate me, Giri.
Mr. Rajpal is a senior.

1331
01:13:27,933 --> 01:13:30,791
Even the Supreme Court
lawyers go to him and learn.

1332
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:35,267
What would you lose going to him and
learn court rules and regulations?

1333
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:37,517
Will you lose anything?

1334
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:39,350
You should not have any egos,
dear.

1335
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:42,683
Sir, rules and regulations are
there to safeguard the justice.

1336
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:44,401
But not to bury the truth.

1337
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,639
Sir, by using all the
loop holes in the law,

1338
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:50,725
Fraud lawyers like him are letting
all the criminals loose. Damn!

1339
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:51,661
What did he say?

1340
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:52,902
Sir, that is...

1341
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,381
-What did he say?
-I said "Fraud."

1342
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,684
How dare you call me fraud?

1343
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:03,183
I will and I already said it, didn't I?

1344
01:14:03,383 --> 01:14:04,017
Be in your limits.

1345
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:05,767
You already saw my potential
at your office, didn't you?

1346
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,308
I bashed up everyone.

1347
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,892
Hey, hell with the office! Show your
power here if you have the guts.

1348
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,305
-Come, come let us fight...
-Come!

1349
01:14:11,483 --> 01:14:14,012
-Hey stop!
-[indistinct voices]

1350
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,333
Mr Rajpal,
maintain silence.

1351
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:19,829
-[chaos]
-What is this? Hey, stop it.

1352
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:25,172
Hey! If you lay your hands on me,
I swear I will punch you in the face.

1353
01:14:25,277 --> 01:14:27,850
Will you hit me?

1354
01:14:27,892 --> 01:14:30,725
Don't you believe?
Let me show you then. Come on!

1355
01:14:31,142 --> 01:14:34,767
Hey! Mind your language.
I will slit your tongue, mind it!

1356
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:37,054
-You bloody rascal!
-Sir, what is this?

1357
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,558
Sir, give me permission.
I will kill right here and hoist the flag.

1358
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,267
I am a big goon in Chittore, sir.

1359
01:14:41,308 --> 01:14:42,142
Hell with you, rascal!

1360
01:14:42,342 --> 01:14:46,081
-[chaos]
-Silence! Where is my gavel?

1361
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,777
Why should I fear,
just because you are a senior?

1362
01:14:47,977 --> 01:14:49,683
-What is this behaviour like a rogue?
-Hey, stop him

1363
01:14:49,892 --> 01:14:51,308
-Should I fear him?
-Hey, I will kill you.

1364
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:55,094
-Come, let us fight.
-Silence...!

1365
01:14:55,185 --> 01:14:56,476
-You would have been dead by now!
-Silence!

1366
01:14:56,676 --> 01:14:57,659
-Leave me.
-What is this?

1367
01:14:57,859 --> 01:15:01,683
What do you think?
Is this a court or a fish market?

1368
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:02,955
-Sir, please...
-Hey! Leave me, sit down.

1369
01:15:03,254 --> 01:15:05,403
Sorry, sir...

1370
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:09,945
Have you got only my court to fight?

1371
01:15:11,517 --> 01:15:12,822
Go and fight on the streets.

1372
01:15:15,867 --> 01:15:17,402
You know, it's not wrong

1373
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:22,581
to suspend you for a minimum of five years
from the bar council for what you did.

1374
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:24,875
Sorry, sir.

1375
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,912
I should not have behaved so.

1376
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,350
I will make sure not to repeat it.

1377
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:31,969
Now you can go.

1378
01:15:32,517 --> 01:15:33,306
Thank you, sir.

1379
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:40,850
Giri! You wait.

1380
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:43,350
What was that in the court?

1381
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:46,658
Will you punch in his face?

1382
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:48,725
Will you kill and hoist the flag?

1383
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:50,267
What is that language?

1384
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:51,933
I did not like at all.

1385
01:15:52,808 --> 01:15:55,892
You just started the practice
and why do you ruin your image?

1386
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,558
Why are you so angry?

1387
01:15:57,808 --> 01:16:00,350
What is wrong with my anger, sir?
I am a lawyer and not a clerk.

1388
01:16:00,617 --> 01:16:02,392
One gets angry only when
he is fighting for justice.

1389
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,850
Wow, well said. Justice is it?

1390
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:09,062
What happened to your senses when
Albert Pinto gave a false witness?

1391
01:16:09,162 --> 01:16:10,892
I had no sense then,
sir and now I got my sense back.

1392
01:16:11,183 --> 01:16:13,517
-Shouldn?t a man change?
-Hell with the change!

1393
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:20,142
Look Giri, law may be blind
but not the judge, right?

1394
01:16:20,725 --> 01:16:22,642
You think I do not know
what is happening out there?

1395
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:24,642
I can see everything.

1396
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,475
Then put all those laws aside and give
a judgment as per what you see, sir.

1397
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:30,725
Total system would change.

1398
01:16:30,892 --> 01:16:32,808
Court rules do not agree for that.

1399
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:34,967
Then what is the use of these
courts, sir? Close them down.

1400
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,082
We will finalize it outside, won't we?

1401
01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:37,267
Close down?

1402
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:38,633
Wow!

1403
01:16:38,975 --> 01:16:41,092
You are talking too much!

1404
01:16:41,308 --> 01:16:43,017
Do not show these Chittore
goon qualities before me.

1405
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:44,475
Leave!

1406
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:51,642
Look, if you find any Goddess of justice
there, offer a salute on my behalf too.

1407
01:16:51,892 --> 01:16:52,433
Go!

1408
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:56,892
Rajpal, I believed you a lot.

1409
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:01,225
You are watching it, right?
Situations are going out of hand.

1410
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:06,267
Once we think, everything if fine
new problems are coming up.

1411
01:17:06,683 --> 01:17:09,558
Diwan sir, everything would
settle down in two to three days.

1412
01:17:10,017 --> 01:17:11,005
I will take care.

1413
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:11,933
Oh I see!

1414
01:17:12,267 --> 01:17:14,723
I came to know when that CD went
into the hands of Sapthagiri,

1415
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:16,584
about how good are you taking care of.

1416
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:19,017
Sir, everything will be alright
and I need some more time.

1417
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:20,433
Why should I give you some more time?

1418
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:24,808
On one hand we on are
spending all our money,

1419
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:26,532
but there is no use.

1420
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,767
And what is his name? Pinto...

1421
01:17:29,225 --> 01:17:30,933
Yes, we gave two crores to Pinto.

1422
01:17:31,183 --> 01:17:33,410
And damn the bloody deal! What's the use?

1423
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,277
Sir, that Pinto did his
job for the money you paid.

1424
01:17:36,377 --> 01:17:37,297
Your money wasn't wasted.

1425
01:17:37,397 --> 01:17:38,538
-Hey!
-Hey!

1426
01:17:39,848 --> 01:17:44,350
Mr Lawyer, we spent lakhs so that
there shouldn't be any issue from them.

1427
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,850
And we are spending crores here.

1428
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,850
Hell with it! It's not about money.

1429
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,475
I am worried about the
prestige of my family.

1430
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:52,183
Can you do this or not?

1431
01:17:52,475 --> 01:17:53,808
Or should I hire some other lawyer?

1432
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:57,475
-Lawyers like Subramania Swamy
-Sir...

1433
01:17:57,517 --> 01:17:58,769
Hell with you!

1434
01:17:58,969 --> 01:18:03,267
Look, at this age, I cannot
see my grandson going to jail

1435
01:18:03,982 --> 01:18:05,433
I am giving you one more chance.

1436
01:18:05,975 --> 01:18:08,308
We should win in this case now.

1437
01:18:09,827 --> 01:18:10,429
That's all!

1438
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,183
Hey, you are overacting these days.

1439
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:30,933
Do you imagine yourself a hero,
just because you got popular on TV?

1440
01:18:32,032 --> 01:18:34,157
Learn how to talk with seniors!

1441
01:18:34,726 --> 01:18:35,325
Did you get it?

1442
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:36,131
Hey!

1443
01:18:46,732 --> 01:18:48,040
How dare you mess with the seniors!

1444
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:05,826
Do remember!

1445
01:19:06,026 --> 01:19:11,110
If you repeat this, you will be sent
to those for whom you are fighting.

1446
01:19:42,025 --> 01:19:44,525
Mr. Rajpal, please proceed.

1447
01:19:45,067 --> 01:19:50,442
Your honor... Our Sapthagiri Sir showed a
movie last time in CD and became a hero

1448
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:54,900
I agree that the car in
that video is of my client

1449
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:57,817
They shot it on the night of the accident

1450
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:01,733
But, what is the relation between the
footpath's truck accident and this car?

1451
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:03,817
But, both the accidents
happened on the same day

1452
01:20:04,317 --> 01:20:05,442
it's just a sheer coincidence.

1453
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,317
That is why all this
confusion is created.

1454
01:20:08,775 --> 01:20:12,900
Your honor, I would like to
call my client's family driver.

1455
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:15,150
-What is his name?
-Gopal

1456
01:20:15,525 --> 01:20:16,067
Gopal

1457
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,858
-Sir...
-Come, stand there

1458
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,733
Stand straight, hey this way.

1459
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,567
Stand straight man!

1460
01:20:29,233 --> 01:20:32,025
Ok, Can you describe
what happened that night?

1461
01:20:32,067 --> 01:20:35,108
Sir, I dropped Rohit sir at birthday
party and was returning home...

1462
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:36,233
What was the time then?

1463
01:20:36,442 --> 01:20:37,192
Around 1 am.

1464
01:20:37,483 --> 01:20:39,358
Ok, then?

1465
01:20:39,608 --> 01:20:41,567
I was going fast as the road was empty

1466
01:20:41,858 --> 01:20:44,900
As I couldn't control speed,
I dashed the divider at a turning point.

1467
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:46,650
What did you do then?

1468
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:48,567
I called Yogi sir being tensed.

1469
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,775
He scolded me and asked to
give a complaint in the Police station

1470
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,150
What happened in the Police station?

1471
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:55,192
At the Police station, they shot a
video of the car for insurance purpose

1472
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,983
This is the real story
behind that CD your honor

1473
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,942
Media people are repeatedly
showing this video

1474
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:04,442
and are trying to trap
my client into this case

1475
01:21:05,025 --> 01:21:07,733
Sapthagiri sir is trying to become a hero

1476
01:21:08,692 --> 01:21:11,900
I have a Police report copy and
the insurance copy your honor

1477
01:21:12,942 --> 01:21:15,025
I objection your honor...
Wait, be right there

1478
01:21:15,275 --> 01:21:17,233
Is he a guest at your home?

1479
01:21:17,358 --> 01:21:19,650
That you direct him what to do?

1480
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:23,442
Sir, we are learning from you.
Give us a chance too.

1481
01:21:24,108 --> 01:21:26,692
Your honor,
I should cross examine the witness

1482
01:21:26,775 --> 01:21:28,358
Why not? Go ahead.

1483
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:30,525
Come on go ahead

1484
01:21:32,692 --> 01:21:33,567
You do not worry

1485
01:21:34,525 --> 01:21:35,358
Gopal Sir

1486
01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:36,942
From how many years have you been driving?

1487
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:38,317
From 14 years

1488
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:38,942
Wow

1489
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:42,608
14 years, in court
language means a life time!

1490
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:44,025
So you have a great experience.

1491
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,108
How did that accident occur
despite your years of experience?

1492
01:21:47,192 --> 01:21:48,900
Hey...
why do you look that way, look at me?

1493
01:21:50,942 --> 01:21:51,483
Are you drunk?

1494
01:21:51,775 --> 01:21:52,442
No sir,

1495
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:55,108
I raised the speed as road
was empty at that hour

1496
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:57,858
Speed in the sense...
around 60 to 70 kmph?

1497
01:21:58,192 --> 01:22:01,358
That is a top model luxury car, it picks
up 60 to 70 right in the first gear sir

1498
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:02,650
Oh, is it?

1499
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,567
What gear were you in?

1500
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:07,983
-I was in third gear on 120 speed.
-Yes, note this point your honor

1501
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:12,400
Our dialogue king Rajpal sir could not
teach him acting with expressions

1502
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,817
And thus he is simply caught shaking
his head with dialogues they fed him.

1503
01:22:16,817 --> 01:22:19,358
Your honor, that car
has an automatic gear system

1504
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:20,442
and it does not have any gears.

1505
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:22,233
Then how did he go in third gear?

1506
01:22:22,608 --> 01:22:26,067
I have already submitted all
papers in regards with that car model.

1507
01:22:28,608 --> 01:22:29,692
Automatic car?

1508
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:31,150
Yes, Mr. Rajpal

1509
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:32,442
Ok...

1510
01:22:32,525 --> 01:22:33,442
Your honor,

1511
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:36,900
it is the first time that he is coming
to the court and is thus feeling nervous.

1512
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:38,775
He is not but looks like
you started to get nervous.

1513
01:22:39,858 --> 01:22:41,733
Please your honor,
give the next adjournment

1514
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,067
Why an adjournment sir, when he is
making him lie right in front of our eyes?

1515
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:46,025
What man, are you lying?

1516
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:49,400
Do you know what happens
if you lie in the court?

1517
01:22:49,817 --> 01:22:51,900
Bend like a cock... Come on bend!

1518
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,483
I do not know how to bend sir

1519
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:54,567
I will show sir

1520
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,900
This is it sir

1521
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:01,150
You too bend like that, come on do it!

1522
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,442
Silence!

1523
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:06,108
Silence!

1524
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:10,108
Your honor, they are calling and
threatening me to get away from this case.

1525
01:23:10,275 --> 01:23:11,192
else they said they'd kill me.

1526
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,025
Here, they hit me too.
These wounds are their gifts.

1527
01:23:15,567 --> 01:23:16,150
What?

1528
01:23:17,483 --> 01:23:18,192
Have they hit you?

1529
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,317
This is very serious matter your honor

1530
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,650
Poor fellow, look how hard they hit him.

1531
01:23:26,192 --> 01:23:28,400
I thought you slipped and
fell down in the bathroom.

1532
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:31,233
Your honor, we should not
leave this matter here.

1533
01:23:31,775 --> 01:23:34,108
Let us declare a holiday tomorrow
for court and do a protest.

1534
01:23:35,483 --> 01:23:38,025
Wow, what an acting sir! He deserves
a Golden Nandi for his acting.

1535
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:41,858
He made his assistants thrash me and is
now acting like innocent in the court.

1536
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,108
Me?

1537
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,733
I would never use such lame
tricks on rookie like you.

1538
01:23:48,858 --> 01:23:54,525
Hey, maybe someone did this to you
for all the nuisance you create.

1539
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:57,858
Hey, agree to have got me thrashed when
you did and prove you got guts of a man

1540
01:23:58,067 --> 01:23:59,233
Guts of a man?

1541
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:01,192
Is it how you speak with a senior?

1542
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:02,192
How are your deeds then?

1543
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,608
-Sir, is this the way...
-Stop...

1544
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:04,817
Are you fighting again?

1545
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:06,358
Will you not stop even
after being said repeatedly?

1546
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:10,858
Look Sapthagiri, I am passing
orders to provide you security.

1547
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:11,608
Ok?

1548
01:24:12,108 --> 01:24:13,608
Sir, I do not need security.

1549
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:15,650
I just wanted to say what
happened to me, that's all sir.

1550
01:24:15,733 --> 01:24:18,983
No, I am definitely
giving you the security.

1551
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,237
Because, if something happens to you...

1552
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:25,996
Mr Rajpal would be blamed for it.

1553
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,775
What do you say Mr. Rajpal?

1554
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:29,525
Yes or No?

1555
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:31,817
Yes...

1556
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:33,275
Exactly!

1557
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:36,942
Boss, atrocities of this
Rajpal are increasing day by day!

1558
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:38,525
That idiot is nearing his end

1559
01:24:38,608 --> 01:24:40,358
He is an idiot and thus hit from behind.

1560
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:44,692
Let him come face to face and
attack, we would fry him up!

1561
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:46,608
Hey, I am getting a head ache

1562
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:49,442
I will bring a strong tea... Ok?

1563
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:56,358
-Boss, escape...
-Hey, what happened?

1564
01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:00,025
Oh no! Oh God, what is this?

1565
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,608
Who are you dude? You look
like a twenty tired lorry?

1566
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:10,025
Why are you coming inside? Get out.

1567
01:25:10,233 --> 01:25:12,608
-Is Sapthagiri sir here...
-He is our boss

1568
01:25:13,733 --> 01:25:14,692
Go, idiot

1569
01:25:17,942 --> 01:25:21,650
Sir, this is bodyguard Baby appointed by
the Government. Reporting for duty sir!

1570
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,900
I myself am trying hard to make ends
meet and now another burden too?

1571
01:25:24,233 --> 01:25:25,817
Hey, why do we need security?
Send him away

1572
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:28,442
No sir, this is Government
order and I have to obey it

1573
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,400
Hey, send him away

1574
01:25:29,567 --> 01:25:31,317
You wait baby Where to send him sir?

1575
01:25:31,692 --> 01:25:34,317
We are dealing with big cases now
and we will have so many enemies

1576
01:25:34,442 --> 01:25:36,858
Would you have got hurt if this
Baby was there? Come on tell me boss.

1577
01:25:37,858 --> 01:25:40,942
Hey, look at his body. Can we feed him?

1578
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:42,983
A guy with a big body
will not have much hunger boss.

1579
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:44,692
He would lie there in the corner,
by giving him just two idlis.

1580
01:25:44,858 --> 01:25:48,858
-Hey, you are not understanding,
-Boss, please agree

1581
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:50,692
Hey Baby, start the action

1582
01:25:51,025 --> 01:25:52,442
Sir, I am feeling hungry

1583
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:56,817
Just two idli and he would
lying there in the corner.

1584
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:17,192
Wow, there is a rhythm in your walk boss

1585
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:22,983
That rascal should vomit
seeing your speed boss

1586
01:26:26,317 --> 01:26:27,442
Boss, you want to eat?

1587
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,067
Hey fat guy, come on eat!

1588
01:26:32,858 --> 01:26:35,775
Boss, he seems to die
if not fed for one time!

1589
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,525
Look, you elephant!
Make sure none obstructs boss.

1590
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:40,192
Drive them out

1591
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:42,400
Come on, none should be seen!

1592
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,733
You already look handsome

1593
01:27:16,358 --> 01:27:17,733
Why do you need that make up?

1594
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,858
I am seeing if there are still any
negative shades left in my face.

1595
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,608
It was my mistake brother in law,
I could not understand you well

1596
01:27:35,608 --> 01:27:36,942
Chitti, I will never scold you again.

1597
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,567
You know, cooked curd rice just for you?

1598
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:43,067
Yes, taste it, Chitti.

1599
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:45,442
How does it taste?

1600
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:52,358
Sorry

1601
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:29,067
"Babe is like a fish and teased the heart,
I am locked up like a boy"

1602
01:28:29,358 --> 01:28:33,817
"Babe is great, the babe is great"

1603
01:28:35,317 --> 01:28:41,108
"Summer Sunrise and burnt the winter,
I am thrilled for the killer looks"

1604
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:45,942
"It is great hey boy, it is great"

1605
01:28:46,942 --> 01:28:52,794
"Hey smile is like thunder, walk like
tender and waist is liked a wonder"

1606
01:28:53,358 --> 01:28:59,150
"It came saying to stick like tattoo
on heart, sticker on the face"

1607
01:29:04,204 --> 01:29:05,775
"Hey it is great!"

1608
01:29:05,858 --> 01:29:09,733
"Hey babe, your plait is great"

1609
01:29:15,775 --> 01:29:21,150
Hey boy, your goggles are great

1610
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:57,803
"I will make it popularized
that yours is a great beauty"

1611
01:29:58,003 --> 01:30:00,775
"I will play with band"

1612
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:03,983
"and shout that you are the
mind blocking sensation"

1613
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:07,067
"I will make it popularized"

1614
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:09,775
"I will play with band and shout"

1615
01:30:09,817 --> 01:30:12,650
"I will become the dot on your cheek"

1616
01:30:12,692 --> 01:30:15,692
"I will become the wing to your heart"

1617
01:30:15,942 --> 01:30:18,525
"I will happily get booked now"

1618
01:30:18,692 --> 01:30:21,608
"I will be your right for hundred years"

1619
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:28,358
"Hey it is great"

1620
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,108
"Hey babe, your plait is great"

1621
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:43,858
"Hey boy, your goggles are great"

1622
01:31:18,108 --> 01:31:19,692
Hello Boss, a good news for you.

1623
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,483
We got the address of that beggar
and he says he'll meet tomorrow.

1624
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,650
Not tomorrow,
I am coming there right away.

1625
01:31:24,858 --> 01:31:25,817
You don't let him escape.

1626
01:31:25,858 --> 01:31:27,067
I am coming there and
you too stay right there

1627
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,567
You get ready, I will drop
you at brother-in-law's house.

1628
01:31:30,608 --> 01:31:31,150
Ok. Ok

1629
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:32,233
-Get ready Chitti
-Ok

1630
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:38,525
Brother in law, where is he?

1631
01:31:38,817 --> 01:31:41,150
He is right here,
deal carefully and the work will be done

1632
01:31:42,983 --> 01:31:43,525
Hello,

1633
01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:45,233
What do you know about
this accident old man?

1634
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,900
That accident took
place right before my eyes

1635
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,275
I carried the dead bodies with my
own hands and put them into the tractor.

1636
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:50,567
Will you come to the
court say the witness?

1637
01:31:50,775 --> 01:31:52,108
-I will not come sir.
-Why?

1638
01:31:52,483 --> 01:31:55,192
Who would feed us if I roam
around courts and Police station?

1639
01:31:56,067 --> 01:31:59,192
Justice is a very costly thing
for the poor in this country.

1640
01:31:59,233 --> 01:32:02,067
Hey, none gets the justice just like that,
one should have to fight for the justice.

1641
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,025
What if everyone thinks like you?
Someone should come forward right?

1642
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:06,858
Yes, but we cannot.

1643
01:32:07,192 --> 01:32:08,858
Why do you make us the scape goat sir?

1644
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,317
I told you all that I knew.

1645
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:13,150
But I will not come to give the witness

1646
01:32:14,025 --> 01:32:17,108
If you fear so much to tell the truth,
why did you call us so late in the night?

1647
01:32:18,192 --> 01:32:20,900
Hey, you stay regretting this forever.

1648
01:32:21,192 --> 01:32:22,275
and another accident takes place tomorrow

1649
01:32:22,442 --> 01:32:24,942
Ten more beggars would die and
you too will be one among them.

1650
01:32:25,275 --> 01:32:29,650
Look old man, whether you come to give the
witness or not, I'll search for the truth.

1651
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:32,025
Lives of beggars like
you will never change.

1652
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,817
Live that damn life!

1653
01:32:35,067 --> 01:32:35,942
Sir, lawyer sir!

1654
01:32:37,525 --> 01:32:39,733
Do not repeatedly keep saying beggars sir.

1655
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:42,817
It's not beggars that died that night.

1656
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:46,150
But the farmers who feed the nation.

1657
01:32:53,733 --> 01:32:56,650
What are you saying?
Is it farmers who died that night?

1658
01:32:57,983 --> 01:32:59,150
You are hiding something.

1659
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:01,525
Tell me what exactly has
happened, I will take care.

1660
01:33:02,358 --> 01:33:03,233
What happened?

1661
01:33:03,942 --> 01:33:08,025
If you really need the truth, go to
Tamsi village of Adilabad district.

1662
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:09,358
You will know it all

1663
01:33:12,358 --> 01:33:13,025
I mean...

1664
01:33:15,358 --> 01:33:16,067
Please go!

1665
01:33:44,692 --> 01:33:46,275
Where are you headed to lawyer sir?

1666
01:33:46,733 --> 01:33:47,692
Hey, get the bag

1667
01:33:48,025 --> 01:33:48,483
Hey...

1668
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,150
This is not right, SI, Not right!

1669
01:33:52,442 --> 01:33:53,942
I know whether I'm right or not.

1670
01:33:54,775 --> 01:33:55,483
Give that bag first

1671
01:33:56,192 --> 01:33:57,983
Hey, you can't go to Tamsi!

1672
01:33:59,525 --> 01:34:00,067
Tamsi?

1673
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:02,150
How do you know that
I am going to Tamsi?

1674
01:34:02,317 --> 01:34:03,275
How do I know?

1675
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,733
Oh come on lawyer,
I am your shadow.

1676
01:34:06,317 --> 01:34:08,460
We know everything about where you
are going, what you are doing...

1677
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:11,853
and whom you are meeting.

1678
01:34:12,053 --> 01:34:13,442
I understood, because of that Baby right?

1679
01:34:13,817 --> 01:34:15,525
You only have appointed that
bodyguard too, right?

1680
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:19,442
Yes, your lawyer brain
is working right now

1681
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,108
Hey Baby!

1682
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:26,108
How dare you aim gun
to your higher officer?

1683
01:34:26,358 --> 01:34:26,817
Give the gun!

1684
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:32,233
Sir, I came as they sent
but I'm not their man.

1685
01:34:33,483 --> 01:34:37,108
Not even a mosquito will land on your
body until this bodyguard is alive.

1686
01:34:37,483 --> 01:34:38,192
You go sir

1687
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:42,858
Thank you sir

1688
01:34:45,067 --> 01:34:48,233
Hey, do you know what happens
aiming gun at a higher official?

1689
01:34:48,483 --> 01:34:49,108
Sorry sir

1690
01:34:49,983 --> 01:34:51,108
Hey, catch that Sapthgiri

1691
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:02,900
Hey baby, no... No please baby

1692
01:35:03,108 --> 01:35:03,567
No please baby

1693
01:35:17,483 --> 01:35:20,400
-I am your higher official.
-Higher official? Sorry sir... Ok?

1694
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,400
I beg you, please leave me

1695
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,442
Where is Sir? Hey baby

1696
01:35:25,483 --> 01:35:26,233
Come sir..

1697
01:35:26,275 --> 01:35:29,275
Hey baby, no please... Leave me please...

1698
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:31,733
No please...

1699
01:36:00,067 --> 01:36:02,067
-Sir, will you take to Tamsi?
-Come on...

1700
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:18,719
Tamsi

1701
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:38,150
Sir, Mr. Hanuman Das...

1702
01:36:38,733 --> 01:36:40,733
You will get justice and that's all

1703
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:42,400
I do not know

1704
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,400
They said he is from this village

1705
01:36:44,567 --> 01:36:45,650
I said I do not to know!

1706
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,608
Why? Will you sell him too?

1707
01:36:50,108 --> 01:36:52,567
What is it old man?
I came to do justice for you

1708
01:36:52,942 --> 01:36:55,108
What justice will you do, idiot?

1709
01:36:55,692 --> 01:37:00,650
Hey, you made money out of
the the dead bodies of farmers

1710
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:03,900
This sin will not be forgiven
that easily, you will pay for it.

1711
01:37:05,108 --> 01:37:07,108
I came to correct that mistake sir

1712
01:37:08,067 --> 01:37:12,192
Do not kill us again
to correct your mistake

1713
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,900
What is your relation to those who died?
How much do you need to shut your mouth?

1714
01:37:17,983 --> 01:37:21,567
Hey, we are not money
minded, we are toiling farmers.

1715
01:37:21,858 --> 01:37:25,900
We are not the city people who don't care
when people die in front of their eyes

1716
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:29,775
We are true villagers
who live like one family

1717
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:33,490
Hey, when a farming calf dies...

1718
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:37,408
we grieve and don't feel like
eating anything that whole day.

1719
01:37:37,692 --> 01:37:41,233
Will I be quiet when my own
people face such an injustice?

1720
01:37:41,317 --> 01:37:43,317
You country brute!
Come on beat them

1721
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:47,442
If anyone comes out on the name
of court and Police station,

1722
01:37:47,483 --> 01:37:50,692
men will not be spared alive,
and women will be assaulted.

1723
01:37:52,483 --> 01:37:56,108
We died when some rich
idiot dashed inebriated

1724
01:37:57,733 --> 01:38:02,192
We died again for telling the
dead farmers as beggars

1725
01:38:02,692 --> 01:38:08,178
Above all when you to have made
us believe so much and cheated...

1726
01:38:08,378 --> 01:38:10,748
we died completely!

1727
01:38:11,358 --> 01:38:14,328
Whole life of our farmers is a death...

1728
01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:18,113
Hit by the electric wires,
hanging ourselves, drinking pesticides...

1729
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:20,525
When were we alive?

1730
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
We were dead the moment
we were born as farmers.

1731
01:38:23,442 --> 01:38:26,108
Everyone has been
killing us at every step

1732
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:29,608
Come on kill, keep killing us!

1733
01:38:29,858 --> 01:38:33,525
Hey, though you keep
killing us umpteen times,

1734
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:38,150
...we will keep feeding you!

1735
01:38:38,233 --> 01:38:42,983
Sir, I can understand your pain.
I did one mistake unknowingly or knowingly

1736
01:38:43,108 --> 01:38:46,358
I too am the son of a farmer.
Send Hanuman Das once with me

1737
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,858
I will stand up to your confidence

1738
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,025
Hanuman Das will not come with you

1739
01:38:50,233 --> 01:38:51,858
You have no courage to save.

1740
01:38:51,983 --> 01:38:53,858
Still,
we will not send him with a cheat like you

1741
01:38:53,942 --> 01:38:56,983
What are we even talking to him? It is
a danger to our village if he is here.

1742
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,025
Kick him out and drive him away

1743
01:38:58,692 --> 01:38:59,817
Hey...

1744
01:39:01,692 --> 01:39:03,650
Go away you idiot...

1745
01:39:04,692 --> 01:39:06,483
Live cheating people!

1746
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:08,358
Go idiot

1747
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:35,556
"What happened, what has happened now?"

1748
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:40,264
"What is a life without up and downs?"

1749
01:39:40,389 --> 01:39:46,098
"There is a way ahead and
you have breath to go ahead"

1750
01:39:46,264 --> 01:39:50,973
"Morning comes in the paths of darkness"

1751
01:39:51,389 --> 01:39:56,431
"God is nowhere but
he's the morale in you"

1752
01:39:56,848 --> 01:40:01,639
"Do not let the light
of hope blow off in you"

1753
01:40:02,014 --> 01:40:07,139
"Courage is nothing
but the justice in you"

1754
01:40:07,348 --> 01:40:12,431
"Your aim will never lose"

1755
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:17,785
"Though you have no helping hand,"

1756
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:22,747
"fight alone for all"

1757
01:40:23,098 --> 01:40:27,986
A good guy like you should win

1758
01:40:28,056 --> 01:40:33,497
"and the God will see to that you win"

1759
01:40:33,745 --> 01:40:38,941
"What happened, what has happened now?"

1760
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:43,536
"What is a life without up and downs?"

1761
01:41:10,835 --> 01:41:15,843
"What happened, what has happened now?"

1762
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:17,851
"What is a life without up and downs?"

1763
01:41:33,523 --> 01:41:36,564
They asked to hit you to
go into coma for six months

1764
01:41:37,122 --> 01:41:40,523
But you should not die. How dude, how?

1765
01:41:44,648 --> 01:41:47,523
Do you have to mess bigwig's cases?

1766
01:41:48,148 --> 01:41:50,773
How will you go into coma, idiot?
How should I hit that you go into coma?

1767
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:52,981
We will tie him a sack
and beat him up bro!

1768
01:41:59,023 --> 01:42:00,148
Hit him so hard that he doesn't get up.

1769
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:03,155
Only face broke when hit in the court and
total body should be hurt hitting here

1770
01:42:03,398 --> 01:42:04,106
Come on hit...

1771
01:42:04,304 --> 01:42:06,554
I will burn down the total
village, you rascal

1772
01:42:07,064 --> 01:42:09,731
Not a single farmer will be spared
alive if you take to the court

1773
01:42:11,523 --> 01:42:13,117
Did you get angry saying farmers, idiot?

1774
01:42:21,007 --> 01:42:22,132
Not a single farmer be spared is it?

1775
01:42:28,523 --> 01:42:30,981
Not a single farmer be spared, is it?

1776
01:43:03,606 --> 01:43:05,564
Not a single farmer be spared is it?

1777
01:43:21,715 --> 01:43:23,352
Hey, farmer will live!

1778
01:43:23,384 --> 01:43:25,892
[thunder rumbling]

1779
01:43:35,689 --> 01:43:37,314
Wow, what a rain!

1780
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:40,064
-Good Morning sir [in unison]
-Good morning!

1781
01:43:40,856 --> 01:43:42,898
Even the rest stand up, guys.

1782
01:43:42,939 --> 01:43:47,273
No problem if you do not respect me as
judge but learn to respect the court

1783
01:43:48,023 --> 01:43:50,814
Ok, all of you sit... Be seated

1784
01:43:54,136 --> 01:43:55,523
Sir, tea

1785
01:44:00,593 --> 01:44:03,426
What is this? Did you bring
it from the fridge or what?

1786
01:44:04,231 --> 01:44:07,523
How is the case today and
how should the tea be?

1787
01:44:07,898 --> 01:44:09,731
Shouldn't it be very hot?

1788
01:44:13,231 --> 01:44:15,064
Take it away... don't stand!

1789
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:23,689
Sapthagiri...

1790
01:44:25,976 --> 01:44:28,309
Oh no, what happened again?

1791
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:32,291
Will you not come without getting hurt?
We gave you a bodyguard too right?

1792
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:35,251
Nothing sir, had a tiff in
the village and we fought.

1793
01:44:35,314 --> 01:44:36,731
-Who won?
-Me sir

1794
01:44:36,939 --> 01:44:38,564
Ok, come to the point

1795
01:44:38,918 --> 01:44:43,751
Your honor, I wish to question SI Patnaik
who investigated this case from first

1796
01:44:43,837 --> 01:44:45,462
Ok, call hm

1797
01:44:45,577 --> 01:44:48,535
Do not get tensed Mr.Rajpal, I gave the
advance notice to witness in advance

1798
01:44:53,106 --> 01:44:53,898
Sir

1799
01:44:55,939 --> 01:44:58,314
You are the investigation
officer of this case right?

1800
01:44:58,507 --> 01:44:58,975
Yes

1801
01:44:59,314 --> 01:45:02,212
Can you whole-heartedly say that you
have investigated this whole case

1802
01:45:02,243 --> 01:45:04,007
with complete loyalty?

1803
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:08,898
With complete loyalty and taking great
trouble, I investigated every evidence.

1804
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:11,547
I swear on my conscience and say this.

1805
01:45:11,856 --> 01:45:15,064
Can you say another matter
taking the same promise?

1806
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:16,439
Yes, why not?

1807
01:45:16,939 --> 01:45:21,398
Was it the beggars or the farmers
who died that day in the accident?

1808
01:45:25,523 --> 01:45:27,814
What, why are so tensed
when I said farmers?

1809
01:45:27,939 --> 01:45:29,523
I am not any tensed

1810
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:33,564
You are hiding something. You are lying.
Speak out are they farmers or beggars?

1811
01:45:33,731 --> 01:45:35,189
What farmers? They are beggars.

1812
01:45:35,313 --> 01:45:36,176
No, they are farmers

1813
01:45:36,273 --> 01:45:38,106
-No, beggars
-Farmers

1814
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,868
-No, they are beggars!
-Farmers

1815
01:45:39,981 --> 01:45:41,231
-No, beggars
-Farmers

1816
01:45:41,273 --> 01:45:42,231
-Beggars..
-Beggars..

1817
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:42,856
Farmers!

1818
01:45:42,898 --> 01:45:44,939
There your honor, he is caught

1819
01:45:45,093 --> 01:45:47,884
As we all thought, argued and understood

1820
01:45:47,976 --> 01:45:51,101
it was not the beggars sleeping on the
footpath who died in the accident

1821
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:53,814
but the farmers belonging to Tamsi
village of Adilabad district

1822
01:45:56,189 --> 01:45:59,222
If it comes out that they
were farmers, the feared

1823
01:45:59,247 --> 01:46:01,898
it would create a sensation in the nation
and all the farmers would protest...

1824
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:05,314
they have preplanned it and
said that they were beggars.

1825
01:46:05,356 --> 01:46:06,606
and got the case closed your honour.

1826
01:46:06,648 --> 01:46:10,398
Objection your honor,
unfolded mischievous aspirants...

1827
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:12,523
They are deviating the case

1828
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:15,314
Where did these farmers come suddenly?

1829
01:46:15,356 --> 01:46:15,981
I will tell you!

1830
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:20,030
Mr. Rajpal, let us first listen.
You have some patience

1831
01:46:20,259 --> 01:46:23,593
I meant... He now says farmers,
and tomorrow soldiers...

1832
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:28,106
then students and then the aliens
falling from space. Will you believe?

1833
01:46:28,231 --> 01:46:31,898
Mr. Rajpal, we'll look into it later.
You first be seated

1834
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:36,546
Sapthagiri, you continue

1835
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:39,085
-Mr. SI
-Yes

1836
01:46:39,481 --> 01:46:41,389
These are the names of those who
died that day in the accident.

1837
01:46:41,494 --> 01:46:42,780
Can you read out once to the court?

1838
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:44,123
Sir...

1839
01:46:44,215 --> 01:46:47,382
Come on read out, case is very interesting

1840
01:46:47,981 --> 01:46:52,731
Ramulu, Kishtappa, Saleem,
Yesaiah, Saidulu, Hanuman Das...

1841
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:56,356
All of them come into my dreams
and are doing great nuisance.

1842
01:46:56,523 --> 01:47:00,439
That SI sir has not done the
investigation properly. What do you say?

1843
01:47:01,648 --> 01:47:04,023
You just said farmers
and now saying dreams.

1844
01:47:04,523 --> 01:47:07,574
Do one thing, make the ghosts
coming into your dreams and

1845
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:09,755
make them say witness and it stands good

1846
01:47:09,785 --> 01:47:11,452
I am doing the same now your honor

1847
01:47:11,505 --> 01:47:15,380
I am going to bring one ghost from the
six dead and make it give witness today

1848
01:47:17,023 --> 01:47:21,494
Order, order! What are
farmers and what nonsense?

1849
01:47:21,519 --> 01:47:23,356
What is this
fantasy in between?

1850
01:47:23,381 --> 01:47:26,489
Not a nonsense your honor.Victim
number six from the dead

1851
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,297
Mr. Hanuman Das is still alive

1852
01:47:31,898 --> 01:47:35,481
But our Patnaik sir in the FIR has
shown him as dead. He is that great

1853
01:47:35,564 --> 01:47:38,819
My humble request to present the
key person in this case and

1854
01:47:38,844 --> 01:47:41,297
my witness Mr. Hanuman Das
in court your honor

1855
01:47:41,356 --> 01:47:42,648
What the hell?

1856
01:47:43,731 --> 01:47:48,731
Objection your honor!
How many times should I say you

1857
01:47:49,356 --> 01:47:51,648
That a witness cannot be called
without giving an advance notice?

1858
01:47:51,689 --> 01:47:55,134
I know I should not call. But will
they let him come at least to court

1859
01:47:55,181 --> 01:47:56,728
once they get to know that
I have a witness?

1860
01:47:56,814 --> 01:47:58,043
Another story!

1861
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,501
This is a court proceeding

1862
01:47:59,526 --> 01:48:01,779
and not your village settlement
for anyone to come at their will

1863
01:48:01,898 --> 01:48:05,814
Sir, this is the only chance for getting
out the truths hidden in this case sir,

1864
01:48:05,856 --> 01:48:06,673
just give me one chance sir

1865
01:48:06,697 --> 01:48:08,762
Let even the justice be alive
along with the law. Please sir

1866
01:48:08,796 --> 01:48:11,171
Do not beg saying please
sir, you first go and sit!

1867
01:48:11,356 --> 01:48:13,746
You can tell the truth when
you are asked to, go sit

1868
01:48:13,855 --> 01:48:15,648
-Sir please sir
-Hey, sit

1869
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:18,939
See sir, he is threatening right before
you. Please sir, just one chance sir

1870
01:48:19,023 --> 01:48:22,439
Mr. Rajpal, you just wait and sit.
You be seated

1871
01:48:22,856 --> 01:48:26,356
Mr. Sapthagiri,
you present your witness Thank you sir

1872
01:48:27,981 --> 01:48:28,773
Sir...

1873
01:48:29,273 --> 01:48:30,898
None should speak.

1874
01:48:31,023 --> 01:48:32,856
Sapthagiri, you bring him.

1875
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:36,064
But rules are rules,
you cannot call a witness just like that.

1876
01:48:36,106 --> 01:48:40,689
Come on, I am saying right?
Sapthagiri, you bring the witness

1877
01:48:40,939 --> 01:48:44,231
Sir, the rules do not permit it.
You have to give an advance notice

1878
01:48:44,564 --> 01:48:45,773
Mr. Rajpal...

1879
01:48:48,231 --> 01:48:53,439
I too know the rules. I am giving the
permission, right? No more discussion.

1880
01:48:53,648 --> 01:48:58,398
As per the Supreme Court guidelines,
you cannot call such a witness.

1881
01:48:58,439 --> 01:48:59,814
How can you call such a witness?

1882
01:49:00,356 --> 01:49:01,064
What?

1883
01:49:01,189 --> 01:49:02,981
I said, how can you call such a witness?

1884
01:49:03,023 --> 01:49:05,523
-How can I?
-Yes

1885
01:49:05,606 --> 01:49:09,314
How will you permit witness without giving
an advance notice? I have a case law...

1886
01:49:09,356 --> 01:49:14,273
Mr. Rajpal, this is my court and not
any club of yours. Do you understand?

1887
01:49:14,856 --> 01:49:18,314
Here, only I can and I am doing this.
Mind it

1888
01:49:23,064 --> 01:49:24,523
This is illegal.

1889
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:25,856
This is illegal.

1890
01:49:26,023 --> 01:49:28,981
Mr. Rajpal, will you stop intervening?

1891
01:49:29,023 --> 01:49:30,106
This is illegal.

1892
01:49:30,148 --> 01:49:35,023
Look, you are committing
contempt of court. This is bad

1893
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:36,564
Contempt of court?

1894
01:49:36,773 --> 01:49:39,576
I am making an objection that
something illegal is happening here and

1895
01:49:39,722 --> 01:49:41,086
I am in contempt of court?

1896
01:49:41,286 --> 01:49:44,849
When I am telling contempt of court,
still you are arguing with me.

1897
01:49:45,049 --> 01:49:46,740
This is not good for you.

1898
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:49,189
Sit down... Sit down I say

1899
01:49:49,231 --> 01:49:50,064
I will not sit down

1900
01:49:50,106 --> 01:49:53,231
Come on, I am ordering you go and sit down

1901
01:49:53,939 --> 01:49:55,273
It is not the end of this

1902
01:49:55,314 --> 01:49:57,773
I will not tolerate if
you utter another word.

1903
01:49:57,814 --> 01:49:58,898
I will approach bar council

1904
01:49:58,981 --> 01:50:00,689
How dare you speak again, come on sit!

1905
01:50:00,773 --> 01:50:02,523
I am going to make a big stink of this!

1906
01:50:02,606 --> 01:50:03,398
Sit down I say!

1907
01:50:03,481 --> 01:50:04,773
This cannot go on!

1908
01:50:04,898 --> 01:50:06,189
Come on, sit down!

1909
01:50:06,481 --> 01:50:08,398
Sit down I say, how
many times should I say?

1910
01:50:08,648 --> 01:50:13,374
This is my court! This is my court! And
whatever I say, that is final.

1911
01:50:13,574 --> 01:50:15,025
Go, sit down!

1912
01:50:15,356 --> 01:50:20,356
In the 28 years of my legal career,
no court has given such a weird ruling

1913
01:50:20,439 --> 01:50:21,606
-I cannot...
-Shut your mouth.

1914
01:50:22,231 --> 01:50:25,648
This is Naramalli Sivaprasad,
senior most Judge

1915
01:50:25,731 --> 01:50:30,648
You tell me the rules? Where have you come
from? You are posing like a big hero, sit!

1916
01:50:30,689 --> 01:50:31,898
I am already sitting no, sir...

1917
01:50:32,606 --> 01:50:34,648
-I am down.
-Sit down

1918
01:50:43,131 --> 01:50:44,548
-Mr. Sapthagiri...
-Sir

1919
01:50:44,589 --> 01:50:46,631
-Present the witness.
-Thank you sir

1920
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:50,381
Move aside... Move aside

1921
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:03,839
All the best dude

1922
01:51:22,839 --> 01:51:27,798
Sir, we got the main witness,
Sapthagiri cannot win tomorrow.

1923
01:51:32,298 --> 01:51:34,423
-Your name?
-Hanuman Das sir

1924
01:51:35,256 --> 01:51:38,381
Can you explain your relation
with this case to the Court?

1925
01:51:38,756 --> 01:51:42,506
I am sixth person who was thought
to have died in this accident sir

1926
01:51:44,839 --> 01:51:47,714
Can you explain what happened that night?

1927
01:51:48,256 --> 01:51:51,548
Sir, we are from a small village
Tamsi of Adilabad district

1928
01:51:51,798 --> 01:51:56,089
Sir, we six that day came to Hyderabad
to purchase seeds under subsidy.

1929
01:51:56,298 --> 01:52:00,298
When the shopkeepers said there was no
stock and they'd be available the next day

1930
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:02,464
...we did not know
where to go and what to do

1931
01:52:02,631 --> 01:52:07,631
As we couldn't afford hotel room, we
slept on the footpath alongside the road

1932
01:52:10,881 --> 01:52:15,464
Sir, I head a loud noise that
midnight, while I was asleep.

1933
01:52:23,839 --> 01:52:27,256
When I woke up and saw,
a boy got down from the car.

1934
01:52:27,964 --> 01:52:32,631
He saw our guys in blood stains.
I thought he would help us.

1935
01:52:32,798 --> 01:52:36,293
But in fear he took out
beer bottle from the car

1936
01:52:36,493 --> 01:52:39,713
...drank it and threw
the bottle down.

1937
01:52:39,913 --> 01:52:45,006
got into the car and drove it reverse in
full speed over us.

1938
01:52:45,048 --> 01:52:48,589
He again went ahead in the same speed.
and I went unconscious sir

1939
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:51,550
When I opened the eyes and saw,
was in the hospitals sir

1940
01:52:51,925 --> 01:52:53,717
Then came a person to me...

1941
01:52:53,967 --> 01:52:55,092
Hey, get up

1942
01:52:57,092 --> 01:53:00,342
Do you remember the truck
number which made your accident?

1943
01:53:00,383 --> 01:53:03,300
Sir, the accident was not
caused by a truck, but a car

1944
01:53:03,425 --> 01:53:04,133
Just shut up!

1945
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,175
Accident was caused by a truck

1946
01:53:06,217 --> 01:53:09,550
I remember very well sir
Accident happened with a car sir.

1947
01:53:09,925 --> 01:53:13,467
From there, SI took me to the dead
bodies of my people in the mortuary

1948
01:53:13,508 --> 01:53:15,550
-Are these your people?
-Yes sir

1949
01:53:15,633 --> 01:53:18,008
All these died as the truck has crashed

1950
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:20,508
No sir, all these died as the car crashed

1951
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:23,008
Not the car idiot,
they died as the truck crashed.

1952
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:25,508
I fall at your feet and
beg sir, leave me sir!

1953
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:29,050
I too wish to leave you, but,
I get money killing you

1954
01:53:29,217 --> 01:53:34,092
Sir, I have Rs30,000 brought to buy seeds
and fertilizers. Please take these sir.

1955
01:53:34,925 --> 01:53:39,050
Sir, those are the bangles I bought
on loan, for my sister's wedding.

1956
01:53:39,092 --> 01:53:40,425
Hey, go away!

1957
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,258
Later a constable got me
boarded into a bus to Tamsi.

1958
01:53:47,767 --> 01:53:50,578
Your honor, I request to give one chance

1959
01:53:51,415 --> 01:53:53,977
for the main witness Hanuman Das
to identify the main convict Rohit

1960
01:53:54,177 --> 01:53:57,800
Objection your honor,
I wish first to cross examine the witness

1961
01:53:58,008 --> 01:54:01,842
Objection overruled.
Mr. Rajpal, you sit down.

1962
01:54:01,883 --> 01:54:03,925
Thank you, thank you your honor!

1963
01:54:04,467 --> 01:54:07,717
Mr. Rohit, come dear...

1964
01:54:09,383 --> 01:54:11,967
What is that cat walk, come fast!

1965
01:54:15,633 --> 01:54:19,092
Hanuman Das, look at
him thoroughly and tell.

1966
01:54:19,633 --> 01:54:24,092
Is he the same person, who caused the
accident that night with Toyota Fortuner?

1967
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:35,217
Sir, he is the one.

1968
01:54:38,201 --> 01:54:39,928
[clock hour bell rings]

1969
01:54:40,128 --> 01:54:45,800
Oh! It's lunch time.
Let's meet after lunch.

1970
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:48,092
Your honor, I have a request.

1971
01:54:48,342 --> 01:54:49,592
Mr. Rajpal...

1972
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,467
Can you give us another adjournment?

1973
01:54:51,675 --> 01:54:53,925
Because, I have an important
case today at the high court.

1974
01:54:55,758 --> 01:55:00,425
Are you that busy? Then,why
don't you send your junior here?

1975
01:55:01,175 --> 01:55:02,973
No matter who stays and who doesn't...

1976
01:55:03,173 --> 01:55:07,820
The Judgment in this case will
be given today. That's all!

1977
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:16,258
Jyothi, it's the lunch break and final
judgment will be given post lunch.

1978
01:55:16,525 --> 01:55:21,675
In this hit and run case full of
twists like a suspense thriller,

1979
01:55:21,717 --> 01:55:23,633
as it came to know that the dead
were not beggars but the farmers,

1980
01:55:23,675 --> 01:55:26,425
this case is bagged
more importance Jyothi.

1981
01:55:26,925 --> 01:55:28,842
-Hey Ramaraj...
-Sir

1982
01:55:29,967 --> 01:55:31,842
Did we win the case sir?
Is everyone happy, sir?

1983
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:33,967
-Where is that fellow?
-He is inside sir

1984
01:55:34,342 --> 01:55:35,633
-Bring him
-Yes sir

1985
01:55:42,758 --> 01:55:44,633
-Who is this fellow?
-Hanumantha Rao of Tamsi sir

1986
01:55:44,925 --> 01:55:48,092
I said Hanuman Das
not Hanumantha Rao.

1987
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,425
Idiot, why didn't you say?

1988
01:55:50,467 --> 01:55:53,258
Sir, when did they let me say?

1989
01:55:53,525 --> 01:55:54,300
Get out!

1990
01:55:55,092 --> 01:55:55,967
Come idiot!

1991
01:55:59,175 --> 01:56:01,300
-Patnaik...
-Sir...

1992
01:56:10,967 --> 01:56:14,092
-Confirm me just three things...
- Yes sir

1993
01:56:14,508 --> 01:56:16,800
-Is his name correct?
-Correct sir

1994
01:56:17,217 --> 01:56:19,967
-Is he from Tamsi?
-Yes sir

1995
01:56:23,842 --> 01:56:26,508
-Is what all he said in court true?
-True sir

1996
01:56:34,967 --> 01:56:37,675
You let him go in greed
of just Rs30,000, idiot!

1997
01:56:37,883 --> 01:56:38,592
Sir...

1998
01:56:38,717 --> 01:56:42,300
For the first time in my 28 years of
career I had to bend my head in the court.

1999
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:47,633
Useless fellow, I gave you so many lakhs
and would have given another lakh if asked

2000
01:56:47,842 --> 01:56:49,717
Sir, I did a mistake

2001
01:56:50,508 --> 01:56:53,030
You cannot get away with a
sorry for the mistake you did now.

2002
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:56,164
Never show your face again! Idiot!

2003
01:57:01,217 --> 01:57:06,092
Mr. Rajpal, please finish your arguments
before the court gives the judgment.

2004
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:09,008
Thank you your honor!

2005
01:57:12,092 --> 01:57:14,117
Firstly...

2006
01:57:14,317 --> 01:57:16,944
for filing a PIL on the closed case...

2007
01:57:17,144 --> 01:57:20,230
I thank Mr. Sapthagiri.

2008
01:57:22,067 --> 01:57:28,058
After reopening, new truths, new proofs...

2009
01:57:29,021 --> 01:57:31,343
and new witnesses came forward.

2010
01:57:31,633 --> 01:57:37,217
But, none from these is true to
prove my client as the convict.

2011
01:57:37,508 --> 01:57:42,883
But your honor, I have to admit I
am little worried. I am worried.

2012
01:57:43,508 --> 01:57:49,425
Because, as I see the faces
of all the people here...

2013
01:57:49,675 --> 01:57:53,425
they look to have come to a confirmation
that Rohit has done the accident.

2014
01:57:54,008 --> 01:57:56,331
Not sure why...

2015
01:57:57,395 --> 01:58:02,207
but I notice an eagerness in
their eyes to send Rohit to jail

2016
01:58:03,342 --> 01:58:07,300
May not be a conspiracy,
but certainly an intent!

2017
01:58:08,425 --> 01:58:12,342
But before we do that,
let us examine certain facts.

2018
01:58:13,133 --> 01:58:15,630
There is no clarity about what
happened on the night of accident

2019
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:18,671
...in the investigation report yet.

2020
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:22,133
There is some confusion.
Some confusion!

2021
01:58:22,925 --> 01:58:26,050
As per the FIR,
accident was because of a truck

2022
01:58:26,342 --> 01:58:30,008
But prosecution and this world says
accident was because of Toyota Fortuner.

2023
01:58:30,425 --> 01:58:34,092
As per the Police report, six were dead.

2024
01:58:34,633 --> 01:58:37,592
But prosecution and media
says it is five persons.

2025
01:58:37,842 --> 01:58:40,965
Records clearly state that
the dead are beggars.

2026
01:58:41,165 --> 01:58:43,152
but prosecution says they are farmers.

2027
01:58:43,925 --> 01:58:46,217
What is true and what should
we believe, your honor?

2028
01:58:46,925 --> 01:58:51,050
Similar to a thriller film,
suddenly a dead body has come alive.

2029
01:58:51,383 --> 01:58:53,534
We have a dead man who
is walking in the court...

2030
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:56,051
and who has become the only
eye witness in this case.

2031
01:58:57,175 --> 01:58:58,842
Is this a kind of a joke?

2032
01:58:59,508 --> 01:59:05,133
Your honor, as per the prima
facie, I understand something.

2033
01:59:06,508 --> 01:59:10,217
I feel the Police have not
handled this case with fidelity.

2034
01:59:11,633 --> 01:59:14,925
Especially this
investigating officer Patnaik

2035
01:59:15,925 --> 01:59:19,508
I request the court to
take severe action on him

2036
01:59:19,633 --> 01:59:22,383
The whole department being
defamed because of such people.

2037
01:59:22,967 --> 01:59:27,049
Court, case and investigation are
mocked because of people like him.

2038
01:59:27,249 --> 01:59:28,412
He made a fun of it.

2039
01:59:31,342 --> 01:59:36,633
Your honor, my client should not be
punished because of this Patnaik,

2040
01:59:37,175 --> 01:59:40,383
which brings me to a very,
very, very important question

2041
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:44,093
Is this court...

2042
01:59:44,293 --> 01:59:48,876
willing to send my client to jail on the
basis of this botched up investigation?

2043
01:59:49,076 --> 01:59:50,175
Make no mistake.

2044
01:59:50,675 --> 01:59:54,883
This is a botched up investigation with
this law fumble and hilarious evidence

2045
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:00,376
If this happens...
this will be the darkest hour

2046
02:00:00,758 --> 02:00:03,694
in the history of judicial
system of this country.

2047
02:00:10,258 --> 02:00:12,258
Sorry... Sorry your honor!

2048
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:20,133
The dead were five members or six... I
convey my deep condolences to them.

2049
02:00:20,758 --> 02:00:22,092
My sympathies are with them.

2050
02:00:23,267 --> 02:00:28,008
But your honor, there is a danger of death
sleeping on the footpath beside the road

2051
02:00:28,967 --> 02:00:32,383
It be a a car, truck,
van or something that kills

2052
02:00:33,883 --> 02:00:38,977
Your honor, if the affected
is a victim of an accident

2053
02:00:40,225 --> 02:00:42,733
...the accused is a victim
of the circumstances.

2054
02:00:43,967 --> 02:00:49,922
Mistake is theirs who sleep on the road.
This is the harsh reality. Harsh reality!

2055
02:00:50,467 --> 02:00:53,508
The rest... Your honor!

2056
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:59,217
I leave it to your wisdom and
your fine sense of judgment.

2057
02:01:00,342 --> 02:01:01,675
Thank you your honor!

2058
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:13,967
Mr. Sapthagiri, your submission please.

2059
02:01:14,633 --> 02:01:15,675
Thank you your honor.

2060
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:21,633
Your honor, for the first
time I agree with Mr. Rajpal.

2061
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:25,800
True that there is a risk of
death sleeping on the footpath.

2062
02:01:27,008 --> 02:01:29,008
But, I wish to ask
something to Mr. Rajpal.

2063
02:01:29,508 --> 02:01:33,758
Not just him but I want to ask
everyone here including you, your honour.

2064
02:01:33,925 --> 02:01:35,925
Actually, who are those
who sleep on the footpath?

2065
02:01:36,258 --> 02:01:38,467
Why are they ruining the beauty
of our beautiful city like this?

2066
02:01:38,592 --> 02:01:41,342
Why are they dying crushing
under the tires of lorries and cars?

2067
02:01:41,467 --> 02:01:42,717
There is just one answer to that.

2068
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:46,842
They do not have a job.
Neither have money nor a shelter.

2069
02:01:47,092 --> 02:01:50,425
Lakhs of such are living on
thousands of footpaths like this.

2070
02:01:50,467 --> 02:01:53,842
If they sleep beside the roads, will they
drink, drive cars and kill dashing them?

2071
02:01:54,508 --> 02:02:00,217
Our nation, Government and rulers
might not have given any rights to them

2072
02:02:00,342 --> 02:02:04,253
But every citizen born in India will
have an equal right in one aspect.

2073
02:02:04,453 --> 02:02:05,546
That is the justice!

2074
02:02:05,797 --> 02:02:09,010
You, me or anyone here cannot
snatch that right from them.

2075
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:11,008
Our Indian constitution gives it to them

2076
02:02:11,108 --> 02:02:13,967
Because the constitution of
India is the Supreme Law of India.

2077
02:02:18,383 --> 02:02:23,967
Inebriated and filthy rich young
and energetic, innocent drinker Rohit

2078
02:02:24,592 --> 02:02:28,050
has driven over five
innocents sleeping on the road

2079
02:02:28,217 --> 02:02:31,469
That was due to his carelessness
but shows no signs of regret or remorse.

2080
02:02:31,669 --> 02:02:33,703
But that looks like a joke to Mr Rajpal.

2081
02:02:33,903 --> 02:02:36,883
Shall I tell you what the
real joke is? Shall I?

2082
02:02:37,342 --> 02:02:40,092
Mr. Rajpal knows that the dead
are not beggars but farmers.

2083
02:02:40,383 --> 02:02:42,550
He knows that accident
was by car and not truck.

2084
02:02:42,717 --> 02:02:47,167
But for the fees he took and to save
his client who committed the crime

2085
02:02:47,367 --> 02:02:49,632
changed the car into a
truck in the records.

2086
02:02:49,883 --> 02:02:51,622
He made the farmers into beggars.

2087
02:02:51,822 --> 02:02:54,501
If you give six more months, he's say
that it was an air plane not truck

2088
02:02:54,601 --> 02:02:55,932
He would say the beggars as dogs.

2089
02:02:56,132 --> 02:02:59,006
He can even prove this Hanuman Das
as our Powerstar Pawan Kalyan.

2090
02:02:59,206 --> 02:03:01,425
Because he is so efficient,
he is so efficient

2091
02:03:01,717 --> 02:03:04,967
You believe his words and give judgment.
Why? Because what you see is the justice.

2092
02:03:05,008 --> 02:03:06,675
Court needs evidences and
they wouldn't be available

2093
02:03:06,717 --> 02:03:10,592
You declare the convict as innocent and
release him. This is the real joke, sir.

2094
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:13,050
Shall I laugh, shall I?
Come on, all of you laugh!

2095
02:03:14,467 --> 02:03:18,550
What did you say? 'Footpaths are
not meant for sleeping'... True!

2096
02:03:18,717 --> 02:03:21,050
At the same time, they aren't meant
to drive the cars either right?

2097
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:26,760
Your honor, in India on an average
1214 accidents are taking place

2098
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,468
and 377 are dying.

2099
02:03:28,668 --> 02:03:32,534
137000 in 2013, 139000 in 2014,

2100
02:03:32,734 --> 02:03:36,194
146000 in 2015, 150000 in 2016 died...

2101
02:03:36,294 --> 02:03:39,050
That means for every 4 minutes one
person is dying in road accidents.

2102
02:03:39,092 --> 02:03:41,258
More than half from these are
dying in drink and drive cases.

2103
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,008
But is the government
banning the liquor consumption?

2104
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:47,175
When the poor people agitate and
question why they is no ban on liquor...

2105
02:03:47,217 --> 02:03:50,633
They answer that 'Majority of our revenue
is accumulated through liquor business'.

2106
02:03:50,758 --> 02:03:55,175
The answer is that 'We'd sell, you
have to drink and you have to die'

2107
02:03:55,425 --> 02:03:57,425
It is our plight our Governments
do not change their methods.

2108
02:03:57,633 --> 02:04:01,748
And if our Rohit Diwan
realizing his grave mistake and

2109
02:04:01,948 --> 02:04:03,749
paid compensation
to the dead farmers...

2110
02:04:03,949 --> 02:04:07,174
and had surrendered
voluntarily to the law,

2111
02:04:07,374 --> 02:04:08,960
he would have remained
a great person in the history.

2112
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:12,008
But he did not do so... He threatened the
village and made the farmers into beggars

2113
02:04:12,217 --> 02:04:16,050
He joined hands with a false lawyer,
went on doing mistakes,

2114
02:04:16,092 --> 02:04:19,592
spending crores in court and proved to the
society that humanity is dead in humans

2115
02:04:19,633 --> 02:04:21,383
and the evil mentality is grown!

2116
02:04:21,467 --> 02:04:22,008
Sir...

2117
02:04:23,133 --> 02:04:26,488
The criminal layers who are letting
the criminal escape from the judiciary

2118
02:04:26,688 --> 02:04:28,085
are the real criminals.

2119
02:04:28,285 --> 02:04:29,599
People like him are the
real criminals sir.

2120
02:04:29,799 --> 02:04:31,429
Such people should be
expelled from our courts.

2121
02:04:33,758 --> 02:04:35,918
Winning is not just for mere sake of it.

2122
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:39,773
But should the win should be heartfelt
and true to your own conscience.

2123
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:42,305
You said to have won more
than 200 cases, isn't it?

2124
02:04:42,505 --> 02:04:45,147
You did mistake defeating
the justice all the 200 times.

2125
02:04:45,592 --> 02:04:47,800
For what, for what? Is it for the money?

2126
02:04:48,508 --> 02:04:53,133
After a point, money can just be hidden
but of no use for anything, you know?

2127
02:04:53,342 --> 02:04:56,326
If you had once stood for
justice and made that win,

2128
02:04:56,526 --> 02:04:58,774
you would have remained
great forever in the history

2129
02:04:58,974 --> 02:05:02,967
We should win to earn love,
affection and respect from the people sir

2130
02:05:03,133 --> 02:05:04,842
That is the real
fulfillment for a human being.

2131
02:05:05,092 --> 02:05:07,092
Haven't you read
Bhagawadgita? Haven't you?

2132
02:05:08,467 --> 02:05:13,842
Your honor, law says not to forgive
even Prime Minister or the President

2133
02:05:13,883 --> 02:05:15,092
when all the proofs and
witnesses are in favour.

2134
02:05:15,217 --> 02:05:18,842
If that is true, all the evidences and
accused Rohit are right in front of you

2135
02:05:18,883 --> 02:05:20,050
Take him and push him
in the jail right away!

2136
02:05:20,217 --> 02:05:24,050
Like a lesson to the public mocking
and betting on our judiciary system.

2137
02:05:24,092 --> 02:05:27,467
To gain confidence on courts and to
prove power of Indian Judicial system

2138
02:05:27,675 --> 02:05:32,633
Give such a judgement, with which the
whole nation and the justice feels proud.

2139
02:05:32,883 --> 02:05:36,133
Please, give one judgment your honor

2140
02:05:39,525 --> 02:05:45,443
Our farmer is the only person who always
gets cheated but never cheats, your honor

2141
02:05:46,217 --> 02:05:50,258
We anyways could not do justice
to such a farmer when he was alive

2142
02:05:50,508 --> 02:05:53,675
Let us at least do justice
after his death.

2143
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:58,175
Let us give the confidence that even a
farmer too deserves to live in our country

2144
02:05:58,550 --> 02:06:02,675
Give one judgment to say that
we should let our farmers live.

2145
02:06:02,967 --> 02:06:05,675
Give one such judgment...
Thank you my Lord!

2146
02:06:05,875 --> 02:06:09,532
[crowd applause]

2147
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:18,592
Silence!

2148
02:06:19,258 --> 02:06:22,175
What a speech? It was a great speech.

2149
02:06:22,717 --> 02:06:25,383
This is one of the best
speeches in my career also

2150
02:06:27,008 --> 02:06:32,300
Mr. Rajpal, look how clever is Sapthagiri?
He is the right opponent for you.

2151
02:06:32,758 --> 02:06:35,050
-Will you at least agree now or not?
-Yes

2152
02:06:54,592 --> 02:07:00,133
Now, coming to this case...
We can see this case in two parts.

2153
02:07:00,342 --> 02:07:05,069
First... Investigation done
by the Police in this case...

2154
02:07:05,269 --> 02:07:07,523
is full of flaws and corrupted!

2155
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:13,124
Thus I order Police department to suspend
the investigating officer Mr. Patnaik

2156
02:07:13,424 --> 02:07:19,381
and to get a complete
investigation done

2157
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:25,425
Coming to the latter part.
Manipulating the evidences.

2158
02:07:26,133 --> 02:07:29,217
Mr. Rajpal, your client
has done this crime.

2159
02:07:29,508 --> 02:07:33,258
If not, why would he try to
manipulate the evidences?

2160
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:38,467
Look, all of you know
that Rohit is the murderer.

2161
02:07:39,133 --> 02:07:42,133
I am the Judge and I too know.

2162
02:07:42,258 --> 02:07:46,925
I cannot give the judgment as I
know or as all of you know, right?

2163
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,967
Based on the evidences...

2164
02:07:49,467 --> 02:07:51,995
on the first day when the
case comes for the hearing...

2165
02:07:52,195 --> 02:07:53,648
we get to know who the convict is.

2166
02:07:53,848 --> 02:07:58,425
That is why, we keep waiting eagerly
for the evidences to reach the court.

2167
02:07:58,758 --> 02:08:03,320
Adjournments go on and on
and the files pile up but...

2168
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,383
not a single paper comes to the court
saying that this is the evidence.

2169
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:12,925
In such times, the accused is
escaping and moving freely.

2170
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:16,039
I am not saying that this
happens in all the cases.

2171
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:19,048
But in most of the cases it is happening.

2172
02:08:19,383 --> 02:08:21,342
Coming to this case now...

2173
02:08:21,383 --> 02:08:25,465
Rohit and his family
and the great lawyer...

2174
02:08:25,665 --> 02:08:28,711
made all believe that
the farmers as beggars.

2175
02:08:29,092 --> 02:08:33,133
This is very dreaded, mean and cheap.

2176
02:08:33,342 --> 02:08:34,883
As quoted by Sapthagiri,

2177
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:37,633
this case is an example...

2178
02:08:37,833 --> 02:08:43,320
to say that humanity is dead in humans
and the evil nature has reached its peaks.

2179
02:08:44,258 --> 02:08:47,377
Now the PIL number 48693,

2180
02:08:48,173 --> 02:08:50,834
The trial state versus Rohit...

2181
02:08:55,508 --> 02:09:00,217
In this case after examining
the evidences thoroughly,

2182
02:09:00,758 --> 02:09:06,565
As the convict Rohit in drunken state
driving Toyota Fortuner car and dashed...

2183
02:09:06,765 --> 02:09:09,981
was the reason for the
death of five farmers.

2184
02:09:10,883 --> 02:09:15,526
As per the IPC section 302 and 304A,

2185
02:09:15,726 --> 02:09:19,099
I impose a life term jail punishment.

2186
02:09:21,133 --> 02:09:23,845
I also order Rohit's family...

2187
02:09:26,205 --> 02:09:30,090
to pay a compensation of 25
Lakhs each to the deceased's family

2188
02:09:30,425 --> 02:09:36,383
they should also adopt Tamsi
village of Adilabad district.

2189
02:09:36,467 --> 02:09:40,633
Yes... Super!
We won boss! We won!

2190
02:09:40,675 --> 02:09:43,883
Sister, we won the case right?

2191
02:09:48,133 --> 02:09:49,758
Your honor, this is bizarre!

2192
02:09:49,842 --> 02:09:50,925
What?

2193
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:54,467
How do you give such a judgment?
I am compelled to go to the high court

2194
02:09:55,383 --> 02:09:58,675
Your judgment will be struck just in two
minutes there. I will go to the high court

2195
02:09:58,717 --> 02:10:02,966
You go anywhere.
Go to high court, Supreme Court...

2196
02:10:03,166 --> 02:10:06,167
go to the President or jump into a river.

2197
02:10:06,633 --> 02:10:10,008
This is my court and my
final judgment is this.

2198
02:10:10,133 --> 02:10:15,092
Look, your client Rohit
is going to the jail.

2199
02:10:18,925 --> 02:10:22,467
This judgment should build
a confidence in the farmers.

2200
02:10:23,383 --> 02:10:26,508
Let us keep farmers alive
and let us let them live.

2201
02:10:26,592 --> 02:10:28,883
The detailed judgment follows soon

2202
02:10:29,342 --> 02:10:31,633
Now the court is adjourned

2203
02:10:31,833 --> 02:10:32,833
[crowd applause]

2204
02:10:33,883 --> 02:10:34,633
Dad...

2205
02:10:35,092 --> 02:10:37,133
-Come on move...
-No..

2206
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:40,133
Honey, do something!

2207
02:11:07,342 --> 02:11:09,633
Sapthagiri, LLB

2208
02:11:19,592 --> 02:11:21,258
Congratulations!

2209
02:11:43,592 --> 02:11:46,425
I already told you that
you will win for sure!

2210
02:11:47,175 --> 02:11:50,508
You have won... No, you made us win!

2211
02:11:50,675 --> 02:11:52,967
No, you made the justice win!

2212
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:03,308
You made the farmers live and
proved you are son of a farmer.

2213
02:12:03,508 --> 02:12:05,903
You are a great man!
