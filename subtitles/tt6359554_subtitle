1
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,521
- Who do you guys think you are?
- What do you think?

2
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:08,434
- Sorry, sir.
- This is my country.

3
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,350
- Go away..
- To hell with you.

4
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,927
If you don't leave, you'll
suffer the consequences.

5
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:14,503
What do we do now?

6
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:20,261
- Let's call helpline.
- You're right.

7
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:27,867
Leave me.

8
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,463
Help me, man.

9
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,619
Even I am from Karnataka.

10
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,924
You can talk to me in Kannada.

11
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,580
Are you from Karnataka?

12
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,538
I am from Mangaluru. And you?

13
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,343
Is this the time to
ask for address?

14
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:42,870
I don't divide cities
and states like you do.

15
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:47,528
My father taught me country means
India, and state means Karnataka.

16
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,645
Never put a boundary line.

17
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:53,794
But, if anyone crosses
the boundary..

18
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,540
"Six."

19
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:12,215
"Appu!"

20
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:44,202
Appu..

21
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,331
I hope this will
not happen again.

22
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,782
The children from my country shouldn't
have to face this trouble again.

23
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,282
- Yeah..
- Okay, take care.

24
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:28,908
Respect India..Respect Indians.

25
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,159
Your father has
pampered you too much.

26
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,656
We were waiting at home to
celebrate your birthday.

27
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,154
But you went out to
fight for your country.

28
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:47,731
Mom, Sachin Tendulkar
came right back..

29
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,322
..to play the World Cup after
his father passed away.

30
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:52,171
Along with family sentiments..

31
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,613
..one should have commitment
towards the country as well.

32
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,998
Well, if I hurt you, I am sorry.

33
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,358
Happy birthday to you.

34
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:07,501
Mom, where's your younger
brother Venky, the singer.

35
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,300
He wanted to surprise you..

36
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,601
..that's why he's been practicing
his song since morning.

37
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,749
Where is Venky?

38
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:13,389
Where is he?

39
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,300
I don't know. He was
here a minute ago.

40
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:20,303
"I wish you live really long."

41
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:24,608
"Happy-Happy-Happy
birthday to you."

42
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:27,460
"Happy birthday to you."

43
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,348
"Happy birthday to
you, Dear Sid."

44
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,358
Appu, this song is
my gift to you.

45
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:34,345
Just like elders say..

46
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,612
May you live a long life..

47
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:36,749
Bless you.

48
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:37,908
May God bless you!

49
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:41,448
"M..m..m..m.."

50
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,334
"Macho Man..!"

51
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:45,414
"Macho Man..!"

52
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:48,934

55
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,046
"Look at him swoop down
my favorite hero."

56
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:09,790
"He's so strong he can
shake up anyone."

57
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,721
"He's really cute he's
the king of the world."

58
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,068
"He's the one who
dwells in our hearts."

59
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,093
"His soul is pure, his
heart is heaven."

60
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,938
"He's twinkle-twinkle
little star."

61
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,794
"He's the coolest..everyone's
dearest."

62

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,463

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your wonderful presentation.

00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,722
It was wonderful meeting you.

110
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:54,618
This year the twin-tower
project of Melbourne goes to..

111
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:58,346
Willians and Cort.

112
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,280
Dad, I..

113
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,616
It was an important
project, son.

114
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,600
I thought we'll get it.

115
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
It's alright.

116
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,784
Best of luck for next time.

117
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,840
- I am going home, are you coming?
- No, dad. You go.

118
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:19,768
Hello.

119
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,055
- Hello, Helpline?
- Yes.

120
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,648
This is Nandini. Right
now I am in a problem.

121
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,232
Can you please help me out?
Please.

122
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,346
- It's urgent.
- Where are you?

00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,509
- Nandini?
- Huh..

124
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:06,587
- Helpline?
- Yeah..

125
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,628
Actually, I am new to Australia.

126
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,706
I am from Karnataka. Can
you please help me?

127
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,519
Ohh..so you're from Karnataka.

128
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,894
- Yes.
- How can I help you?

129
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,830
You'll have to be my partner.

130
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,022
So soon.

131
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,733
I mean I am a Salsa dancer.

132
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,084
I've applied as a trainer
at the Dance Academy.

133
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,590
The selections are today.

134
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,625
But no Australian is
ready to be my partner.

135
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,412
I am so sorry, I
don't know Salsa.

136
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,535
- I can't help you..
- Please, don't say no.

137
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,788
Can't you do this
much as an Indian?

138
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:33,426
Please.

139
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,145
I will teach you. Don't worry.

140
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,564
Please..

141
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:37,542
Please!

142
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:48,790
Start.

143
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:02,185
- Hey..
- Yes.

144
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,112
I am selected.

145
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,575
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

146
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:06,610
Thank you for the help.
Take care.

147
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:12,105
- Your name?
- Siddharth.

148
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,980
Bye.

149
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:24,788
Why are you so late?

150
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,744
I walked all the way home.

151
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,949
- Where's your car?
- Don't know.

152
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,285
Huh..

153
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,355
Siddharth, let's eat.

154
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,464
I am not hungry, mom.

155
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,508
- Brother-in-law.
- Yeah..

156
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,848
He left his car somewhere
and walked home.

157
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,932
He must be worried because
we didn't get that project.

158
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,506
Tension?

159
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,395
Well, we've celebrated even
when he didn't get a project.

160
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:50,430
What kind of a project was this?
I don't get it.

161
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:54,662
Appu!

162
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:57,063
Uncle, should I use a
soap or a shampoo?

163
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,587
Close the door, son.

164
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,255
There are children running
around in the house.

165
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:03,325
What's wrong with him, God?

166
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:06,765
- Bye, sister-in-law.
- Bye.

167
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:07,911
- Bye.
- Bye.

168
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,171
- See you.
- Yeah.

169
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,964
- Good morning, Sid.
- Good morning, dad.

170
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:16,380
Dad, I really don't feel like
coming to the office today.

171
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,613
It's okay, Sid. Take care.

172
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:22,527
'He's really upset because
we didn't get the tender.'

173
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,466
'He's taking more interest
in business than me.'

174
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,502
He's been watching
this since morning.

175
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,686
I don't know what kind
of a dance is this?

176
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,766
She lifts her leg,
he lifts his leg.

177
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,376
She sticks to him..then
flies through the air.

178
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,866
Like Gemini Circus.

179
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,470
He's out of focus.

180
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:51,648
'He's eating while he's dancing.

181
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,936
God, what's wrong with him?'

182
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:57,660
Dad, why don't you learn Salsa?

183
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,940
It's a very interesting
form of dancing.

184
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,264
Sounds nice, but I
need a partner.

185
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,328
You have mom.

186
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,928
Drink some water.

187
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:10,438
'If I see these two
doing the Salsa,

188
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,768
it will make me dizzy.'

189
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,098
'I know what's in your heart.'

190
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,034
- Goodnight, dad.
- Goodnight.

191
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,526
- Goodnight, mom.
- Goodnight.

192
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:21,249
'I see..so he's more worried about
Salsa, and not the business.

193
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:25,908
What's wrong?

194
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:30,324
Dance-master, Acting king..

195
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,024
Everyone thinks you're
behaving like this..

196
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,946
..because you didn't
get the project.

197
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,504
Is the reason that I think it is, Mr.
Perfect.

198
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,354
Hello, you're the only guy
without a controversy.

199
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,360
What is it?

200
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,096
Don't worry, uncle.

201
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,723
I am worried because that our
family might get embarrassed.

202
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,878
- Great.. - Do you know what's
wrong with me? I am in love.

203
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,187
- You're in love.
- Love is everything.

204
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:53,958
Who is that girl?
What's her name?

205
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,300
Where is she from? Is
she an Indian girl?

206
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:56,950
I am not giving you any details.

207
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,133
I'll tell you everything
once she says yes.

208
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,917
Until them stop following
me around like the Press.

209
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,197
Fine, then I'll
ask you properly.

210
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,404
Are you learning Salsa
because of her?

211
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,548
Yes, she's a Salsa instructor.

212
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,660
And, I am going to join Salsa
classes from tomorrow.

213
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,516
- Nandini.
- Mom.

214
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,844
- She's a mom.
- Mom?

215
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:26,523
What is this?

216
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:28,840
Did you fall for an old
lady instead of a girl?

217
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,900
Hey, my phone.

218
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,617
- Hello.
- Hello, Nandini.

219
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,961
- Yes.
- This is Helpline..Salsa..

220
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:40,139
- Hey, Siddharth, how are you?
- I am fine.

221
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:44,025
- But, that kid..
- He's my friend's son.

222
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,337
I see, your friend's son.

223
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,321
Oh, God.

224
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,801
For a minute I thought
he's after some widow.

225
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,073
God saved me.

226
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:51,721
You can join classes
from tomorrow.

227
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:52,385
See you tomorrow.

228
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

229
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,969
Is he going to learn
Salsa or fall in love?

230
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:57,881
Only God knows that.

231
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:02,033
1..2..1..2..

232
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,305
Hold 2..

233
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:04,185
1..

234
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,017
Siddharth, come practice.

235
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:08,457
1..2..1..2..

236
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,481
1..2..1..2..

237
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:14,915
Spin..

238
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,555
Catch.

239
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,579
Very good Siddharth,
you catch well.

240
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,987
'I joined so that
I can catch you.'

241
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:23,903
You must practice at home too.

242
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,319
You will learn very fast.

243
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:26,695
Do you have a partner?

244
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,405
- I can't-do it.
- Lift it up!

245
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,213
- I can't-do it.
- Lift it up!

246
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,541
If I lift my other
leg, I'll be dead.

247
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:36,209
Hey, uncle, you can't
even do a single step.

248
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,963
What about this paunch
that intervenes?

249
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,096
Then slim down first.

250
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,213
For a man losing weight,
and for a woman..

251
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,821
..gaining weight is
a difficult task.

252
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,445
Uncle, I cannot practice
if depend on you.

253
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,062
I'll do it myself.

254
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,308
There won't be any
classes this week.

255
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,856
I am going on a trip,
with my best friend.

256
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,449
- See you next week, okay.
- Okay.

257
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,694
- Bye.
- Bye.

258
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,404
I thought I'll get through to
her this weekend.But bad luck.

259
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:09,709
Son, I want to share
something with you.

260
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:10,359
- Go ahead, dad.

261
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,664
You know, last month
we donated funds..

262
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,936
..to Karnataka
State Education.

263
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,328
This time we'll
donate for Polio.

264
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,456
The karnataka Government
will support us.

265
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,488
He's Mr. Sridhar.

266
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,392
The state Health Minister.

267
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:28,192
I had a word with him along with
a couple of government officers.

268
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,536
I am also sending
some funds this week.

269
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,053
Great, dead. Very
nice initiative.

270
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:39,191
Sid, our country has given
me plenty of things.

271
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,039
Education, culture,
and my identity.

272
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,183
We must do something
for our country.

273
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,639
God has given us two hands.

274
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:52,206
One to protect yourself, and the
other to protect our people.

275
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,846
I am extremely
proud of you, dad.

276
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:57,822
I feel proud to be your son.

277
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:00,310
By the way, Sid tomorrow
when you meet them,

278
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,366
..you must meet Harry first.

279
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,870
- And close the deal.
- Okay, dad.

280
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,374
I am sure you can do it.

281
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,389
Check, please.

282
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:41,787
Oh..so your friend
betrayed you..

283
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,246
..and you had to take
up a job as a waiter..

284
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:44,680
..because you didn't have money.

285
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,773
You should take some
friendship lessons from me.

286
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:50,028
Boys get their bones broken
for the sake of friendship.

287
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,742
In fact, they even
dump their lover.

288
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:54,513
And your friend, she betrayed
you on your first trip.

289
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,220
Fine, I'll book a taxi.

290
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,921
- Go home.
- I won't go back.

291
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,494
I will go with you.

292
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:04,161
Let's go out, huh.

293
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,866
I want a mobile.

294
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,338
Really?

295
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,542
You're very lucky.

296
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,836
Anything you want eventually
lands in your lap.

297
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,775
- Venky..
- Huh!

298
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,497
- Is that Siddharth?
- Yes.

299
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:18,974
Ask him whether he ate or not.

300
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,835
He's just getting started.

301
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,836
He will finish soon. Won't you?

302
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:25,055
Uncle, your problem
is you're a bachelor.

303
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,717
Even a table will look
like a bed to you.

304
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,718
- Don't worry baby..
- Hang up, I'll call you later.

305
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:33,164
I am absolutely fine. Okay.

306
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:35,600
Take care, bye.

307
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,478
Where did she go?

308
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,345
We're not husband and
wife to stay together.

309
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,887
She has a separate
room, and so do I?

310
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,829
Listen, you're young..you
should never sleep alone.

311
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,323
A person shouldn't stay
alone after a certain age.

312
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:15,703
Don't bore me with
your lectures.

313
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:19,802
Give her your virginity,
not lectures.

314
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:28,377
Are you two in the same room?

315
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,371
"The moon's young, and
so is the night."

316
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,104
"Don't let our conversation
remain unsaid.."

317
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:36,303
Seal this deal today, son.

318
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,635
- Uncle.
- What now?

319
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:40,171
You always get me wrong.

320
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,346
I mean, I will propose to her.

321
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:46,184
During dinner, I will seal..

322
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,566
Go get her, son.

323
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:14,488
Hi.

324
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,464
Is everything set?

325
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:24,144
Did you seal the deal?

326
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:27,205
- Your looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

327
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,125
- Nandini.
- Excuse me, order, please.

328
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:33,053
Sure.

329
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:36,781
Nandini, what I want
to tell you is..

330
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:39,653
Excuse me.

331
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:44,357
Whoever invented the mobile
should get a beating.

332
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:53,255
Nandini, you're always
on the phone, you're..

333
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,107
I am really sorry.

334
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:57,022
It was my boyfriend's call.

335
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,391
He is very worried.

336
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:00,812
I came on this trip
without telling him.

337
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,120
That's why he keeps
calling and asking me.

338
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,271
I have a competitor.

339
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:14,647
My love didn't work out.

340
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,168
Who can compete against you?

341
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,326
No one can compare
himself to you.

342
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,414
You won the National
Award age the age of 10.

343
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:24,063
There's a big difference between the
flowers on the road and in the shop.

344
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:25,983
Goodnight.

345
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,816
Thanks for everything.

346
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:57,222
I thought you'll sleep
in the room last night.

347
00:26:57,246 --> 00:27:01,657
But you slept in the car because
I'll feel uncomfortable.

348
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,444
You're not like others.

349
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:06,114
First of all, your judgment
about boys is wrong.

350
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:09,080
According to the girls, the only
perfect man is their father.

351
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,082
Handsome means their son.

352
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,420
The only lucky man is
their brother-in-law.

353
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,318
And the one they trust
is their brother.

354
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,421
And, the rest look
like hooligans to you?

355
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,268
Hi, friends.

356
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,822
This song is dedicated to
only for love failures.

357
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:31,843
"- When the heart's broken."
- Come Siddharth, join the party.

358
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:37,031
- No, mom. You guys enjoy.
"- What do I live for?"

359
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:37,837
Come.

360
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:42,324
"When the heart's broken."

361
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:45,934
- Good night, dad.
- Okay, Sid. Take rest.

362
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:51,084
"When the heart's broken."

363
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:55,374
"What do I live for?"

364
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,754
"What do I live for?"

365
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:08,336
Hi, Siddharth.

366
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:11,179
- Are you free today?
- Boys are not always free..

367
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,131
But they always manage
to spare some time.

368
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:15,399
- What is it?
- It's my friend's son's birthday.

369
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,106
His mom and dad are busy.

370
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:18,073
Both are working.

371
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:21,655
At least, why can't we
celebrate his birthday.

372
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:31,087
Just a minute, I'll be back.

373
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:34,136
What is this?

374
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,312
Doesn't your sister have
anything better to do?

375
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,333
She's always talking
to her boyfriend.

376
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:39,455
What? Boyfriend?

377
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,086
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

378
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,045
But that's what
she always says..

379
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,162
..to save herself from everyone.

380
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,226
A few days ago she
went on a trip..

381
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,306
..where she found a scapegoat.

382
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,150
And, she said the
same thing to him.

383
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,432
- Bujji, are you enjoying?
- Yes.

384
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:04,681
- Nandini.
- Yeah.

385
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,393
I want to talk to you.

386
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,484
- Are you free this evening?
- Okay, Siddharth.

387
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:14,030
I am really sorry, Nandini.

388
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:15,810
I made a big mistake.

389
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:16,918
Why? What happened?

390
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,326
Even after I knew you
had a boyfriend..

391
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,994
..we kept going out together.

392
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,805
And we were also close.

393
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:25,469
- I really made a big mistake.
- What?

394
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:28,832
- It was almost like our honeymoon.
- Siddharth!

395
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,958
Yes, Nandini. Yes!

396
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,546
It's wrong for one guy
to betray the other.

397
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:45,084
After today it's just
you and your boyfriend.

398
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:46,409
Bye.

399
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,199
What's wrong with you?

400
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,150
You were behaving
strangely last night too.

401
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,733
15 missed calls.

402
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,759
I feel pity for her.

403
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,743
Imagine my plight when she
said she has a boyfriend.

404
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:35,144
So this is revenge.

405
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:38,934
In every love story, it's always
the girl who shows attitude..

406
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,796
..but in this story,
it's the guy.

407
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,350
Instead of playing with her, you should
marry her and play with your kids.

408
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:47,717
Must be her.

409
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:50,358
Hey..hey, kid..

410
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,073
It's on.. Talk to her.

411
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,675
- Hello.
- I called you so many times.

412
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,520
- I am busy.
- Spare 10 minutes from your schedule..

413
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,715
..if you don't show up
or answer my calls..

414
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,183
..I'll write your name on my
death note and commit suicide.

415
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:15,781
I've already lost 5 minutes
of the time I asked you.

416
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:19,734
The place we're sitting
in the hot-seat.

417
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,106
Honestly speaking, I
don't have a boyfriend.

418
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:32,902
The person I keep talking
to is my friend Simran.

419
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:34,642
You're my Mr. Perfect.

420
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:37,110
I was scared that I might
cross my boundaries.

421
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,198
That's why I maintained
my distance.

422
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:41,366
I am single.

423
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:46,259
What can I do if you
don't have a boyfriend?

424
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,395
I love you.

425
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:52,194
Why don't you say something?

426
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,681
Do you have a girlfriend?

427
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:58,101
Do you love me?

428
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,125
"I love you"

429
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,839
"She looks only at me..

430
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,576
What's happening?"

431
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,614
"What's happening?"

432
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:37,669
"What's happening?"

433
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:41,549
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."

434
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,559
"She's saying something."

435
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,779
"Why does she keep smiling?"

436
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:50,079
"How did you..become
so beautiful?"

437
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:53,829
"Now you've become my poem."

438
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,189
"Forgive me for my
small mistakes."

439
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,639
"She looks only at me..

440
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,349
What's happening?"

441
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,429
"What's happening?"

442
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:06,459
"What's happening?"

443
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:10,403
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."

444
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,451
"She's saying something."

445
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,035
"Why does she keep smiling?"

446
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:23,151
'English Rap Song.'

447
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:31,167
'English Rap Song.'

448
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:40,021
"I practice our long
conversations for hours."

449
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,973
"I can't remember
anything else."

450
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:48,301
"I keep sending flowers
to you on whatsapp.."

451
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:52,429
"..but the feeling over
technology is not enough."

452
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:56,525
"She staggers whenever
we take a selfie."

453
00:33:56,605 --> 00:34:00,597
"Whenever I get close..she
gets closer to me."

454
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:04,773
"I know..she's
like touchscreen."

455
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,621
"The world's crazy
about technology."

456
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:12,981
"I'll never turn off
my phone, pardon me."

457
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,115
"She looks only at me..

458
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:17,053
What's happening?"

459
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,252
What's happening?"

460
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,190
"What's happening?"

461
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,070
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."

462
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,132
"She's saying something."

463
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:29,969
"Why does she keep smiling?"

464
00:34:57,353 --> 00:34:59,306
"She's a capricious butterfly."

465
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,416
"Gives me whatever I want."

466
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:05,131
"I will never leave her alone."

467
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,648
"I can't tolerate any
distance from her."

468
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,658
"We'll be together forever."

469
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:13,558
"Let's have fun."

470
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:17,938
"Why does she keep smiling
while having fun?"

471
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:22,268
"She makes me dance
to her tunes."

472
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:26,308
"Her smile..drives me crazy."

473
00:35:26,388 --> 00:35:30,048
"She's a magician."

474
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,178
"She's the one that won
my heart, pardon me."

475
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,418
"She looks only at me..

476
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:38,548
What's happening?"

477
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,558
"What's happening?"

478
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,588
"What's happening?"

479
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:48,111
"She's quiet but feels like
she's saying something."

480
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:50,251
"She's saying something."

481
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,961
"Why does she keep smiling?"

482
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,270
Hello, Jagdish. How are you?

483
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,250
I am fine.

484
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,815
- I hope everything is fine at your end.
- Everything is fine.

485
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,975
I've sent the project
details through email.

486
00:36:01,396 --> 00:36:04,846
I'll email you the business details
of the Bangalore project in an hour.

487
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,996
By the way, we're
coming to Australia.

488
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:10,196
Okay..I called for
a personal matter.

489
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:11,305
And not business matter.

490
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,556
- It's Ashok.
- Yeah..

491
00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:15,196
I've said this before.

492
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,302
I want your daughter
as my daughter-in-law.

493
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,678
- And that's why I called.
- You see, Ashok..

494
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,163
Don't make excuses.

495
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,503
You're coming here next week.

496
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,779
So bring your daughter along.

497
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:26,320
We'll fix an engagement date.

498
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,987
- But my daughter..
- Listen.

499
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:29,989
Don't tell him our
daughter ran away.

500
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:32,546
Otherwise, he'll get the
wrong impression about us.

501
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:34,546
- Hello. Hello, Jagdish.
- Yes.

502
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:36,080
Sorry, Ashok.

503
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,026
- I was on the other line.
- Okay.

504
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:39,895
Well, prepare for your trip.

505
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,748
- See you in Australia.
- Bye, thank you.

506
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:42,490
Okay.

507
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,236
How will we face Ashok?

508
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:52,820
What will we say when he
asks about our daughter?

509
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:00,633
She looks like a nice girl.

510
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:01,434
Yes.

511
00:37:01,514 --> 00:37:04,093
Brother, together they are
like match made in heaven.

512
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,802
- Yes..
- Vicky.

513
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:08,791
- Come and see the picture.
- Coming, brother-in-law.

514
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,191
They are finalizing
a bride for him.

515
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:15,419
Vicky, what's taking so long?

516
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,831
I told him that he
should tell everyone.

517
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:22,377
We can hide pregnancy, but hiding
your love ruins everything.

518
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:23,727
Come on.

519
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:25,937
Coming, sister. It's all ruined.

520
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:28,881
Come, take a look at her.

521
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:31,097
Isn't she beautiful?

522
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,796
Sister? What kind
of a girl is she?

523
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,275
What's wrong with her?

524
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,452
She looks so lame compared
to our Siddharth.

525
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,805
She's absolutely perfect
for our Siddharth.

526
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,330
You better take
another look at her.

527
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,451
I don't think she can
handle a family.

528
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,796
Brother-in-law, our family
will be the talk of the town.

529
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:47,463
Stop talking nonsense.

530
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,648
Do you think we'll wait
for your approval?

531
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,129
I like her, the family
likes her so she's final.

532
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,661
You'll just take
her to his room.

533
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,151
But he's going to suffer.

534
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:56,799
Why don't you ask Appu?

535
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,352
He's never said no to me.

536
00:37:58,432 --> 00:37:59,460
He will do as I say.

537
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,045
I know my son really well.

538
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:04,661
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Sid. Come. Come.

539
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,738
What's going on? Everyone's
sitting together.

540
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,846
- Surprise!
- Even, I have a surprise for you.

541
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:12,177
- But, you go first.
- No, you first.

542
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,560
Someone, please say something, we've
been waiting for a long time.

543
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:17,683
Dad..

544
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,903
I am in love!

545
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,012
I wanted to tell you after
everything was clear.

546
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,739
I was waiting..to
surprise all of you.

547
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:46,003
Dad..

548
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:57,009
What's wrong, uncle? Did
I say something wrong?

549
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:59,317
Your father chose a girl..

550
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,808
..she is the daughter
of his friend.

551
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,562
Everyone in the
family liked her.

552
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,497
That's when you came in and
told them about your love.

553
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:08,433
I think they were hurt.

554
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,291
Dad, ice-cubes.

555
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,161
Dad..dad..

556
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:31,368
- See you..
- Dad.

557
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,625
So did say yes for the wedding?

558
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:53,167
Someone brought a marriage
proposal for me as well.

559
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:54,711
But, I didn't even
see his picture.

560
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,276
My marriage should
be my decision.

561
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:58,231
And, your marriage
should be your decision.

562
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,515
How can they fix your wedding
without your decision?

563
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,618
They should've asked you.

564
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,785
Never say that again.

565
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:07,730
My family is important for me.

566
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,676
They mean everything to me.

567
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,730
Nothing else matters to me.

568
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:24,696
Siddharth, come son.

569
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:28,070
Sit, eat your dinner.

570
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,812
Why can't he marry
the girl he likes?

571
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,862
He never went against
any of your decisions.

572
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:05,943
And, we're lucky to
have a son like him.

573
00:41:21,206 --> 00:41:23,697
Brother-in-law, your silence
won't solve anything.

574
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:30,298
Watching you not speaking with your son
makes a lot of people happy, but..

575
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,535
But what did go wrong?

576
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:37,121
You just want to keep your promise
which you made to your friend, right?

577
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:40,383
Nothing's lost yet, you can
still keep your promise. Yeah..

578
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,319
I've no one this
world, brother-in-law.

579
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,418
Except for you.

580
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,068
If I marry that girl, then you
can still keep your promise.

581
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:53,182
Please say yes, brother-in-law.
Please.

582
00:41:57,592 --> 00:42:00,308
I always respected everyone..

583
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:04,867
But he broke my bones.

584
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,840
We can convince everyone
in your family..

585
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:11,067
..but, how will we
convince your father?

586
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:14,134
Why don't we get married first
and then take his blessings.

587
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:16,219
- He will definitely accept us.
- We cannot do that.

588
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:17,537
Only useless people do
that sort of thing.

589
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,131
Hey, I have an idea.

590
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:21,182
We'll tell him that
I am pregnant.

591
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,961
Then he cannot refuse.

592
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,102
My dad knows me too well.

593
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,834
He will never believe it.

594
00:42:33,324 --> 00:42:33,872
Hi.

595
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:36,671
- Hi. - I want to meet Mr.
Ashok, director of this company.

596
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:37,679
- Thank you.
- This way.

597
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:38,572
Okay.

598
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:43,910
Excuse me, dad.

599
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,080
But, if we follow this our
budget will overshoot.

600
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,664
Friends, I've taken
everything into aspect.

601
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,412
The budget is absolutely right.

602
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,141
- I want you to final this, Mr. Moorthy.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,867
Siddharth, you were right.

604
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:06,538
- I think Ashok sir's decision
isn't correct. - No, Moorthy.

605
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:08,465
Dad has taken the
right decision.

606
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:09,928
He is always right.

607
00:43:18,744 --> 00:43:19,677
Morning.

608
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,192
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

609
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:34,501
I need to meet Mr. Ashok.

610
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,140
Oh, he's going there.

611
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:37,827
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

612
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:41,222
Sir.

613
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:43,514
Sir.

614
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,885
Sir..

615
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,553
Nandini, have you
lost your mind.

616
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,291
I told you not to
do anything crazy.

617
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,712
What are you up to?

618
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:04,457
What's crazy about it?

619
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,191
We can get married if
your father agrees.

620
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,464
That's why I came
here to convince him.

621
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,412
He's not talking to me.

622
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:11,568
He's completely shattered.

623
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,287
And, if you say something
absurd he'll be more hurt.

624
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:15,702
Please.

625
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:36,968
Dad..

626
00:44:39,474 --> 00:44:40,912
Dad, please talk to me.

627
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,753
I don't mind if the entire
world stops talking to me.

628
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,075
But atleast not you.

629
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:47,247
Dad, you're my world.

630
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:49,173
For all the kids
around the world..

631
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:52,178
..their father is their hero.

632
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:54,183
When they see the
father of other kids..

633
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:57,157
..they don't see anything
special in them.

634
00:44:57,225 --> 00:44:59,286
When they don't listen to us..

635
00:44:59,535 --> 00:45:01,423
..we feel like they
are avoiding us.

636
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:05,433
When we start our life, it has
family, responsibility, everything.

637
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:07,553
That's when we understand
the role of our father.

638
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,109
And after everything, when
we want to apologize..

639
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:12,082
..we already lose our father.

640
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:13,856
And left only with regret.

641
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:16,035
I don't want to regret, dad.

642
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,499
I care about your
love rather than..

643
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,726
..the girl that I just met.

644
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:22,928
Please, dad.

645
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:33,432
Sorry, dad.

646
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,895
Nandini, forgive me.

647
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:08,059
Nothing matters to me the most,
compared to my dad's love.

648
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:10,202
I will marry the
girl of his choice.

649
00:46:10,825 --> 00:46:14,461
Nothing matters to me
then my son's happiness.

650
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:17,681
Siddharth will marry
the girl he wants.

651
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,280
That means I'm no
one in your life.

652
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:23,654
- That's not it. - I thought even,
I am a part of your family.

653
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:27,451
But you separated
me from your life.

654
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,142
Nandini.

655
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:41,759
I will convince my
friend somehow.

656
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:47,048
Because I can't be happy
when my son's sad.

657
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,924
Until now, I stayed quiet
and was angry with him.

658
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:54,004
Not because he went against me.

659
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,696
It's because I couldn't
give him my approval.

660
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,975
You know we're in this
position because of him.

661
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:04,043
He's the reason for all the
happiness in this house.

662
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,909
And, we shouldn't forget that.

663
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:11,639
He gave us happiness,
and we made his sad.

664
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,347
Your friend Jagdish is
coming over today evening.

665
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,191
How will you explain
him, brother?

666
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:20,665
No marriage..everything
is damaged.

667
00:47:20,745 --> 00:47:23,089
Appu's just like the
Indian Cricket team.

668
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:27,470
He gets to the final round and then loses.
He comes again.

669
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,397
But, we still support
the India team.

670
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:32,596
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

671
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:35,968
No matter what, even if I have
to move heaven and earth..

672
00:47:36,048 --> 00:47:37,359
- ..or break my sister's head..
- What are you saying?

673
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:40,459
..but, I won't let this
wedding take place.

674
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:42,109
Appu..

675
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:45,492
I am behind you, and
Karnataka's behind me.

676
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:49,019
- Cauvery's ours..and Nandini is ours too.
- Nandini?

677
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,370
No, Nandini is just yours.

678
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,203
Ashok..

679
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,533
I don't know how to tell you.

680
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:11,011
But my daughter doesn't
like this proposal.

681
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:16,513
She ran away from home thinking
that we might force her.

682
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,015
She is very stubborn.

683
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:20,282
We don't know where
she is these days.

684
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:23,356
Don't worry, your
daughter will come back.

685
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,104
She will be safe.

686
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:30,667
Actually, even Siddharth is
not happy with this alliance.

687
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:35,167
I didn't know how to tell you.

688
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:36,879
It's a good thing
you said it first.

689
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:37,820
Oh, God.

690
00:48:39,024 --> 00:48:40,828
We would've ruined their lives..

691
00:48:41,715 --> 00:48:43,511
..by getting them married.

692
00:48:43,634 --> 00:48:45,838
And, our friendship
would've been over too.

693
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:46,908
Thank God.

694
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:50,246
- God is great.
- God is great.

695
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,316
Friendship..celebrating..

696
00:48:57,403 --> 00:49:03,588
Brother-in-law..do you want
to ruin your son's life?

697
00:49:03,764 --> 00:49:05,554
- Have you lost your mind?
- What is this, Vicky?

698
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:07,105
Why are you sounding
like a madman?

699
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:08,543
Be quiet, sister.

700
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:12,681
Brother-in-law is behaving like
this because you always kept quiet.

701
00:49:12,761 --> 00:49:14,899
- What's wrong with him?
- Brother-in-law, if he's your friend..

702
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:16,493
..then invite him over,
offer him tea-coffee..

703
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:17,781
..but, not your son.

704
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:19,925
Ashok, what nonsense is this?

705
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:20,630
- Who is he?
- Relax.

706
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,416
- Calling me nonsense!
- Jagdish.

707
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,605
- Check on Google..
- Idiot!

708
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:27,695
- Is this a joke?
- I am the joke, or are you?

709
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:30,158
Couldn't you find someone in
Bengaluru for your daughter..

710
00:49:30,238 --> 00:49:32,156
..that you want our Appu?

711
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:34,525
Have you seen your
daughter's face?

712
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:36,887
Don't you dare say anything
about my daughter?

713
00:49:37,523 --> 00:49:39,444
- Vicky..
- Uncle..

714
00:49:39,524 --> 00:49:41,092
What are you doing?

715
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:42,661
- Uncle..
- Vicky..

716
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,795
- Leave me.
- Vicky, listen to me.

717
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,240
I won't spare you.
I'll show you..

718
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,067
Let's go.

719
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:50,114
- Jagdish, come on.
- Calm down.

720
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:52,141
- Come on.
- Idiot! Nonsense! Rascal!

721
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:54,145
- I don't want to see his face again.
- Sit down.

722
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:57,989
Appu, find a good
lawyer and divorce him.

723
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,972
You're too much, uncle.
Be quiet.

724
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:00,704
- Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
- Calm down.

725
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:01,984
- Drink some water.
- You keep quiet.

726
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,932
If we keep quiet, how
will you have kids, Appu?

727
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:06,775
Uncle, control.

728
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,387
Out of control Siddharth!

729
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:16,125
I love you Siddharth.
You must love me.

730
00:50:16,205 --> 00:50:17,842
I must go find a lawyer.

731
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:18,752
- Siddharth.
- Nandini..

732
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:19,980
- Leave me.
- Please, please.

733
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,990
Go away, Nandini.

734
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:24,537
- Nandini. Nandini.
- I want to talk to your father.

735
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:26,274
- Hello, Nandini.
- Leave me.

736
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:27,314
- Nandini.
- Sir..

737
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:29,906
I love your son.

738
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:31,337
- Don't stop us.
- Keep quiet.

739
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,678
Don't interfere between us.

740
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,412
You're the villain
in our love-story.

741
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:38,817
That's..

742
00:50:39,564 --> 00:50:40,663
Nandini.

743
00:50:43,112 --> 00:50:44,822
- Mom?
- Nandini.

744
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,648
Dad..

745
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,838
..she's the girl I love.

746
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:54,121
- You were in Australia dear..
- Father.

747
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:55,585
- ..and hiding from us.
- What is all this, dear?

748
00:50:56,979 --> 00:51:00,000
- You'll embarrass us.
- But she's the one I chose for you.

749
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:02,412
She's my friend's daughter.

750
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:10,570
Father chose the same
girl, so did the son.

751
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:13,223
If only they had seen the picture,
things would've been better.

752
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,547
Oh, God.

753
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:17,046
In all this tension
I drank neat.

754
00:51:17,126 --> 00:51:18,831
Now my stomach's burning.

755
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,684
Oh, God.

756
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:24,110
You could've at least told
us that you're in Australia.

757
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:29,041
- We were really worried about you.
- Drink this.

758
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:31,641
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

759
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:35,333
Drink this buttermilk.

760
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,716
Dear..

761
00:51:37,796 --> 00:51:39,975
Nandini, what a sweet name.

762
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,564
Drink the buttermilk, dear.
Don't drink alcohol.

763
00:51:42,693 --> 00:51:44,735
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

764
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:48,273
Let's keep the
engagement in Bangalore.

765
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:50,705
- Is it okay?
- Of course.

766
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:53,059
We're done with our work here.

767
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:54,490
We've also booked
return tickets.

768
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,909
We must leave.

769
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:57,580
- Where is Nandini?
- She..

770
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,529
I'll go get her, sir.

771
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:02,070
Stupid.

772
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:04,493
We'll meet at our engagement.

773
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:06,609
It will be a long gap. Isn't it?

774
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:14,533
Appu, everyone's still fixing your
engagement not your baby shower.

775
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:17,446
- Please go. Go.
- I didn't see anything.

776
00:52:27,322 --> 00:52:29,442
Dad, I'll attend that
tender meeting today.

777
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,016
- Siddharth, I'll come along for
the tender meeting. - Dad..

778
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:37,593
You've always sacrificed family
parties, get-togethers, and functions.

779
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:39,182
It's enough.

780
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:41,665
After today, you won't miss
a single family party.

781
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,001
You will stay at home.

782
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:46,913
As I promised, this project is going
to be a new year gift for you.

783
00:52:47,477 --> 00:52:48,304
Okay, Sid.

784
00:52:57,702 --> 00:53:00,232
We'll wait for you,
come back soon.

785
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:20,695
The biggest oil pipe project
for Sydney goes to..

786
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,542
Ashok and Company.

787
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,112
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

788
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:35,843
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

789
00:53:50,475 --> 00:53:50,932
Hey..

790
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,357
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

791
00:53:56,219 --> 00:53:57,720
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

792
00:53:58,222 --> 00:53:59,231
Sir..

793
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:04,893
Murthy?

794
00:54:05,735 --> 00:54:06,698
Murthy?

795
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,584
Sir, your private jet..

796
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:16,678
..crashed, and your
entire family..

797
00:56:33,872 --> 00:56:39,148
"Why did the waves look tired?"

798
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:44,491
"Why are the mountains falling?"

799
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,808
"The raindrops are thirsty."

800
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:54,701
"The moon has lost
its moonlight."

801
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:57,464
"The clouds have disappeared."

802
00:56:57,544 --> 00:57:00,065
"The birds are not
flapping their wings."

803
00:57:00,145 --> 00:57:05,946
"Everything seems
to have stopped."

804
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:10,665
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."

805
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,954
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."

806
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:18,910
"I am drenched in a
deluge of fire."

807
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,612
"How will the flowers
blossom now?"

808
00:57:55,114 --> 00:58:00,171
"My life..seems lost."

809
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:05,523
"Nothing looks familiar to me."

810
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:11,070
"Unknown paths are unfolding."

811
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,852
"The darkness is spreading,
and I've lost everything."

812
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:21,073
"Everywhere I look,
I see new faces."

813
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:26,258
"Whatever I try to think, the same
old memories come back to me."

814
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:28,906
"I got everything
I ever desired.."

815
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:31,585
"..and lost
everything I wanted."

816
00:58:31,665 --> 00:58:37,255
"How will I swim across?"

817
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:42,271
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."

818
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:45,565
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."

819
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:57,395
Thanks..dad..

820
00:58:57,773 --> 00:58:58,890
You're welcome.

821
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:18,881
He doesn't answer the phone.

822
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:25,605
"Moments pass by.."

823
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:31,305
"..they mean nothing to me."

824
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:41,650
"My only support..are
still there."

825
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:44,411
"Nothing's left except for me."

826
00:59:44,491 --> 00:59:47,063
"No one knows the path ahead."

827
00:59:47,143 --> 00:59:52,962
"Everything seems
to have stopped."

828
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:57,930
"Even the cold breeze
has stopped.."

829
00:59:58,157 --> 01:00:01,066
"..and the world has
stopped spinning around."

830
01:00:01,146 --> 01:00:06,253
"Why did the waves look tired?"

831
01:00:06,463 --> 01:00:11,566
"The raindrops are thirsty."

832
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:17,828
"The moon has lost
its moonlight."

833
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:43,830
Here you go.

834
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,486
Appu.

835
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,345
Krishna.

836
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:19,827
Appu! Appu.

837
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,296
How are you, Appu?

838
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:27,415
It's been so long
since we last met.

839
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:29,852
I guess you haven't
forgotten anything.

840
01:01:29,932 --> 01:01:31,883
And the proof is this "doll".

841
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:33,650
Are your parents alright?

842
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:38,065
What kind of surprise is this?
Why come down here so suddenly?

843
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,143
This is where I left, now fate
has brought me back here.

844
01:01:48,683 --> 01:01:51,849
We don't let the children
here feel they are orphans.

845
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:55,079
That's why we keep
them in hostels.

846
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,496
Everyone loves "Appu" here.

847
01:01:59,441 --> 01:02:02,459
He's never seen his parents.

848
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:05,362
Please give him lots of love.

849
01:02:05,457 --> 01:02:08,380
Don't worry. We
don't have kids..

850
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,189
..so he means
everything to us now.

851
01:02:10,205 --> 01:02:12,607
God gave me everything.

852
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:16,428
And, He took everything
back, Krishna.

853
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:25,477
Everywhere I would go, their
memories would haunt me.

854
01:02:26,168 --> 01:02:30,209
I couldn't stay there,
so I came back here.

855
01:02:30,308 --> 01:02:35,111
I've no one except for you
and this orphanage, Krishna.

856
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:39,860
I'll need time to come
out of this incident.

857
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,882
Can, I live here for some time?

858
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:46,445
This is your home.

859
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,398
You don't need
permission to stay here.

860
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:51,580
Come on.

861
01:04:25,725 --> 01:04:26,915
- Hello, aunty.
- Hello.

862
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:29,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

863
01:04:31,298 --> 01:04:32,903
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

864
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:35,249
- Did you have your coffee?
- Not yet.

865
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:37,048
- Haven't you?
- Chikkanna.

866
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:40,061
- Nagraj, where is chikkanna?
- Haven't seen him.

867
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:41,050
Where could he be?

868
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,367
"Call me wild if you like.."

869
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,657
"Keep calling me all the time.."

870
01:04:45,737 --> 01:04:50,174
"But I am crazy about buffaloes,
and I'll ride it all day."

871
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:54,255
Chikkanna, what's going on?

872
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,755
The milkmaid's on her honeymoon.

873
01:04:57,369 --> 01:04:59,589
There's no one to bring the milk.
That's why I bought this buffalo here.

874
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:00,805
Go make coffee first.

875
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:02,453
What's the hurry?

876
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:05,681
I can make a decoction, and
coffee only when she gives milk.

877
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:11,438
Appu. Appu..

878
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,355
Good morning, dad.

879
01:05:17,202 --> 01:05:19,248
Come and have coffee.

880
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:24,483
Sit.

881
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,191
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

882
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,353
Hello, sir.

883
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,180
When you were here,
this was an orphanage.

884
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:37,883
Now, this is an old age home.

885
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:39,846
Hello. How are you, son?

886
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:41,290
Yes, son.

887
01:05:41,652 --> 01:05:43,459
- Yes, okay..
- One needs an old age home..

888
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:45,601
..more than schools,
colleges, and hospitals.

889
01:05:46,161 --> 01:05:49,526
After a certain age, no one
looks after the parents.

890
01:05:50,334 --> 01:05:51,378
Coffee..

891
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,633
Here you go.. this one's yours.

892
01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:57,660
- Thank you.
- Is he new here?

893
01:05:58,085 --> 01:05:59,906
You look like from
Sadashiv Nagar.

894
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:01,581
What brings you here?

895
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:03,494
- Forget it. How's the coffee?
- It's nice.

896
01:06:03,574 --> 01:06:05,866
- Thank you.
- What kind of coffee is this?

897
01:06:06,681 --> 01:06:09,000
It's so plain, no milk at all.

898
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,877
Who will call this coffee?

899
01:06:10,898 --> 01:06:13,731
The old man has lost his mind.
He finds fault in everything.

900
01:06:14,552 --> 01:06:16,678
Don't worry. That's
what he always does.

901
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:19,158
No matter what we do, its
never enough for them.

902
01:06:19,193 --> 01:06:21,836
Right from food, breakfast, coffee to
their children and grandchildren..

903
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:23,333
..they are not
happy with anyone.

904
01:06:23,372 --> 01:06:25,292
They are always worried
about themselves.

905
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,358
They are restless souls.

906
01:06:30,223 --> 01:06:32,864
Krishna, no one knows I am here.

907
01:06:32,944 --> 01:06:34,895
I left Australia without
telling anyone.

908
01:06:35,064 --> 01:06:37,317
Nandini and uncle must
be really worried.

909
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:38,800
I must go meet them.

910
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,868
Fine, go meet them.
And come back soon.

911
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:43,900
- Here.. Here..
- Another fritter, please.

912
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:46,622
You've grown old but can't control
your hunger for fritters.

913
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:48,708
You haven't lost
your greed for food.

914
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:51,029
Don't eat these things,
and you'll be healthy.

915
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,100
Brother, that beard
didn't suit you at all.

916
01:06:59,614 --> 01:07:02,164
But this suits you so well, better
than it suits on anyone else.

917
01:07:02,244 --> 01:07:04,292
Sit down, I'll serve breakfast.

918
01:07:08,169 --> 01:07:09,757
The rice-cakes are really nice.

919
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:12,055
- You eat.
- You call these rice-cakes, huh!

920
01:07:12,273 --> 01:07:14,867
They are hard like rocks.

921
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,827
And this lentil tastes awful.

922
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:19,057
Unfortunately..

923
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,226
It was his voice,
but I lip-synced.

924
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:23,031
Finish your breakfast,
this is his daily routine.

925
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:25,512
Finish your breakfast,
I'll get your coffee.

926
01:07:52,946 --> 01:07:54,830
- Hello, sir, please listen..
- I won't listen to anything.

927
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:56,391
The deadline ends tomorrow.

928
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:58,744
If you don't pay up you won't
live to tell the tale.

929
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,734
I will throw you out on the streets
along with those other old people.

930
01:08:01,784 --> 01:08:04,519
Krishna..shall we?

931
01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:16,704
Uncle.

932
01:08:21,505 --> 01:08:22,470
Siddharth.

933
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:31,859
Where were you? We
were worried for you.

934
01:08:32,224 --> 01:08:34,113
Is business okay?

935
01:08:34,422 --> 01:08:36,206
We didn't get any
news from your side.

936
01:08:37,104 --> 01:08:38,215
Sorry, uncle.

937
01:08:38,669 --> 01:08:41,191
Actually, I was not in the
mood to talk to anyone.

938
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:45,624
I cannot forget what happened.

939
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:51,916
Uncle..I don't know whether
dad told you this or not..

940
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:54,239
- But I..
- Forget it, Siddharth.

941
01:08:54,675 --> 01:08:56,076
He told me everything.

942
01:08:56,156 --> 01:08:57,561
And, I fixed this wedding
only after that.

943
01:08:57,641 --> 01:09:00,320
You were raised in that house.

944
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,783
One can guess the son's nature
by looking at his father.

945
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,485
You just have to be strong.

946
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,164
Be strong.

947
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:11,592
Uncle, how is Nandini?

948
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,122
Look, please stay with us now.

949
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:31,702
It'll be easier for you to
forget if you stay with us.

950
01:09:31,782 --> 01:09:34,932
Nandini, it's not
easy to forget them.

951
01:09:36,112 --> 01:09:38,644
I can understand your feeling.

952
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:39,751
I will be alright.

953
01:09:41,062 --> 01:09:44,033
I feel at home in
that orphanage.

954
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:48,716
I feel at peace and feel
surrounded by family.

955
01:09:49,747 --> 01:09:51,466
You can stay wherever you want.

956
01:09:51,546 --> 01:09:53,425
You can come here
whenever you want.

957
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:55,926
By the way, this
is your home too.

958
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:03,557
- Boss, Amrutanjan (pain balm)!
- Amruntanjan?

959
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:05,051
- Why?
- Yes, it's evening.

960
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:06,385
The guys will get drunk..

961
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:07,645
..and the women hurdle
up in front of the TV.

962
01:10:07,725 --> 01:10:10,603
The guys get drunk, and
the women loosen up.

963
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:13,660
If someone's fighting on the television,
they will start fighting too.

964
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,447
- Give me the remote.
- There they go.

965
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:17,662
Give me the remote.

966
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:19,618
This is not your personal TV.

967
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:21,447
You know I watch television
every day at this hour.

968
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:23,568
- Do I have to keep telling you?
- This TV is for everyone..

969
01:10:23,648 --> 01:10:24,478
..not just you alone.

970
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:26,734
You can watch when
I am not watching.

971
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,423
You won't touch the remote
as long as I am watching.

972
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:31,676
I cannot fight with
you..you're always arguing.

973
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:34,074
- That's why your family chucked you out.
- I see..

974
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:35,625
Why did they leave you?

975
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,896
- You got thrown out of the house too.
- See..

976
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:39,549
We get tortured by their
arguments every day.

977
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:42,154
They say there's no
tolerance in this country.

978
01:10:42,546 --> 01:10:43,982
There should be
tolerance in the house.

979
01:10:44,062 --> 01:10:46,302
But, if you have a mother
like her and a wife..

980
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:48,471
..then the man gets troubled.
Understand.

981
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:51,519
He can't support his
mother or his wife.

982
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:53,428
He can't upload this
on Facebook either..

983
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:55,189
..that's why he gets confused
and suffers in the end.

984
01:10:55,269 --> 01:10:57,400
In the end, he gets fed up and
leaves his parents in this..

985
01:10:57,401 --> 01:10:58,647
..old age home and
live peacefully.

986
01:10:58,650 --> 01:10:59,942
Even after throwing them
out of their home..

987
01:10:59,978 --> 01:11:02,223
..they give their children
all their property.

988
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,894
And give them every detail.

989
01:11:03,952 --> 01:11:06,135
But what do we care?
See you, boss.

990
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:10,369
Boss, boss..boss,
don't close the door.

991
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:11,396
Someone's coming.

992
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,292
But it's 10:30.

993
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:13,973
For them, it's just
the beginning.

994
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:16,872
He'll go around the entire city,
meet up with his friends..

995
01:11:16,952 --> 01:11:19,864
..and get a peg for
himself and me too.

996
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,119
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi, sir.

997
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,882
I've kept your
dinner in your room.

998
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:24,494
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

999
01:11:24,574 --> 01:11:25,821
Who is he?

1000
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:27,687
His name is Siddharth,
he lives here.

1001
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:30,651
Did your family send you to the
old age home at such a young age?

1002
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:33,289
Or, are you tired
of life so soon?

1003
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,215
- I am Mohammad Rafi.
- Hello.

1004
01:11:35,294 --> 01:11:38,248
- Would you like a peg too?
- No, thanks.

1005
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,315
I sent you an amazing
video on whatsapp.

1006
01:11:41,356 --> 01:11:42,302
Watch it.

1007
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,506
- Is it about wrestling?
- Of course.

1008
01:11:44,585 --> 01:11:46,729
"The moonlight face.."

1009
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:50,381
"- And the golden tresses.."
- Rafi sir.. he's not like the others.

1010
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:51,173
He's very nice.

1011
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:53,008
He never complains about anyone.

1012
01:11:53,088 --> 01:11:56,110
Not even his son,
who left him here.

1013
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,369
He never takes money
from anyone..

1014
01:11:57,373 --> 01:12:00,111
..and stays happy
with whatever he has.

1015
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:01,576
Goodnight, boss.

1016
01:12:01,798 --> 01:12:03,997
Time for my drink.

1017
01:12:14,759 --> 01:12:17,595
Father, next week we're
shifting into our new home.

1018
01:12:18,015 --> 01:12:20,582
And, I am giving you the
first invitation card.

1019
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:24,821
Please come to the
function, father.

1020
01:12:27,562 --> 01:12:31,133
The government allotted me this
plot when I was still working.

1021
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,964
This is my plot and my money.

1022
01:12:34,044 --> 01:12:35,297
And, you built a home on it.

1023
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:37,307
And now, you want
to live happily..

1024
01:12:37,388 --> 01:12:40,759
..while your father rots
in this old age home!

1025
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:43,250
Boss, intolerence.

1026
01:12:43,945 --> 01:12:45,122
Please do come, sir.

1027
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,041
See you, Krishna.

1028
01:12:53,584 --> 01:12:54,460
Hello, sir.

1029
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:01,767
Hello, uncle.

1030
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,732
- Hi.
- What are you thinking?

1031
01:13:05,018 --> 01:13:05,801
Nothing.

1032
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:07,293
Tell me, Siddharth.

1033
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:10,032
Uncle, dad had many ideas..

1034
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:12,301
..but, he couldn't finish them.

1035
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,743
So, I am thinking about
completing some of them.

1036
01:13:14,799 --> 01:13:17,540
I have decided, the most
important are charities.

1037
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,690
I've decided to give 40 %
of my profit to charities.

1038
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,988
I just want to tell you and
get the funds released.

1039
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,060
What's wrong, uncle?

1040
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,833
What happened?

1041
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:42,039
Doesn't seem right to tell you in
your condition but, I must tell you.

1042
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,550
I think good things don't happen
to good people, Siddharth.

1043
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:50,828
Ashok had designed a Polio fund
to help everyone in the society.

1044
01:13:50,908 --> 01:13:54,991
But, he didn't tell you
about the lack of funds.

1045
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:58,444
The entire state was
hating your father.

1046
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,287
The entire population of
the state was against him.

1047
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:05,619
"- Ashok.. - Down-Down!"

1048
01:14:05,894 --> 01:14:09,856
Down-Down!"

1049
01:14:09,936 --> 01:14:11,850
Down-Down!"

1050
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:16,247
There were dangerous chemicals in
the medicine which Ashok funded..

1051
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,532
..because of which many
children fell sick.

1052
01:14:18,612 --> 01:14:21,680
Some children died as well.

1053
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:24,365
The ex-Health Minister was
jailed for the Polio Scam.

1054
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:26,447
Ashok was also served
a court notice.

1055
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:29,714
But, before he could tell
you any of this, Ashok..

1056
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,575
I know he's innocent.

1057
01:14:32,665 --> 01:14:36,949
But, we don't have
evidence to prove it.

1058
01:14:38,037 --> 01:14:40,218
And, he's not alive either.

1059
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:42,679
I don't know in whose
favor will this case go.

1060
01:14:42,759 --> 01:14:46,178
But as his son, everyone
is going to blame you.

1061
01:14:46,188 --> 01:14:50,177
I think you should go
back to Australia.

1062
01:14:50,759 --> 01:14:53,177
I am not someone who hides..

1063
01:14:53,226 --> 01:14:56,692
..and, my father never
taught me to do so.

1064
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:58,649
The man who gave
me my identity..

1065
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:02,352
..I can do anything to
save his reputation.

1066
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,256
Siddharth.

1067
01:15:12,337 --> 01:15:14,398
'We should do something
for our country.'

1068
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:20,204
'If we set out to help someone, we'll
have to face many difficulties.'

1069
01:15:21,128 --> 01:15:25,708
'Then, we should change our
path, but not our goal.'

1070
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:46,521
Boss, Krishna borrowed some
money to run the orphanage.

1071
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:48,764
He's been paying the interest
with great difficulty.

1072
01:15:48,765 --> 01:15:50,441
But, he couldn't do
so last three months.

1073
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:52,649
And the financier
through everyone out.

1074
01:15:52,704 --> 01:15:56,105
Brother Krishna begged and
pleaded, but to no avail.

1075
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,823
Sir, please.. please
listen to me.

1076
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:03,256
Old people live here.

1077
01:16:03,336 --> 01:16:05,033
- Sir..
- Get out!

1078
01:16:07,865 --> 01:16:10,531
Get lost with these old folks.

1079
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:13,050
Hey, lock all doors.

1080
01:17:24,364 --> 01:17:25,078
Appu!

1081
01:18:11,065 --> 01:18:12,839
It's not wrong to ask
for your money..

1082
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:15,168
..but your method is wrong.

1083
01:18:15,928 --> 01:18:17,114
Here's a blank cheque.

1084
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:21,510
Fill in your amount plus the interest
as well for your hospital bills.

1085
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:25,387
If you ever come
back here again..

1086
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:45,742
Let's go inside.

1087
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:05,458
I've people earn
millions for themselves.

1088
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:09,410
But never saw anyone give
millions for others until now.

1089
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:12,669
No wonder people call him
Karnataka's Millionaire.

1090
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:16,545
You were facing so many
problems and didn't tell me.

1091
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,926
- What did you think? Was I dead?
- No, Appu.

1092
01:19:19,978 --> 01:19:22,609
You were dealing with
your own problems..

1093
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:25,735
..and, I didn't want to
trouble you anymore.

1094
01:19:26,246 --> 01:19:27,825
When those guys were
standing outside..

1095
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:30,127
..I could see fear,
embarrassment in their eyes.

1096
01:19:30,202 --> 01:19:32,939
Where would they have gone
without the old age home?

1097
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:36,310
For a minute, it reminded
me of my own past.

1098
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:39,182
And I realized that no one should
go through the same trouble.

1099
01:19:39,202 --> 01:19:41,192
They should be happy,
always smiling.

1100
01:19:53,259 --> 01:19:58,163
"The doll rocks and clinkers."

1101
01:19:58,567 --> 01:20:02,305
"You are my prince."

1102
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:11,695
"The doll rocks and clinkers."

1103
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,585
"You are my prince."

1104
01:20:19,663 --> 01:20:24,832
"New directions are unfolding."

1105
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:30,492
"Old wounds are healing."

1106
01:20:30,932 --> 01:20:35,855
"It's sacred, it's
loveable and its mine."

1107
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:41,351
"You cannot throw it down,
or throw it up in the air.."

1108
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:47,347
"..or ever give
up and bow down."

1109
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:58,812
"The doll rocks and clinkers."

1110
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:02,186
"You are my prince."

1111
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:05,815
Wow..nice one.

1112
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:07,652
- Be quiet.
- Great.

1113
01:21:07,732 --> 01:21:09,929
Why isn't anyone talking to me?

1114
01:21:10,009 --> 01:21:12,240
No one was talking
when I was at home.

1115
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,339
It's the same thing
all over again.

1116
01:21:14,945 --> 01:21:17,911
If you keep fighting for the
TV, who will talk to you?

1117
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:19,467
It's not my fault.

1118
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:21,599
No one ever talked
to me at home.

1119
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,518
What else could I
do alone at home?

1120
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:25,406
I started watching television.

1121
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:28,561
Abhi, I've told you so many
times not to speak with granny.

1122
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:30,694
She will spoil you.

1123
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:33,902
Your mother is spoiling my son.

1124
01:21:33,982 --> 01:21:35,982
She can't even speak
English properly.

1125
01:21:36,019 --> 01:21:38,047
Do you know how
embarrassing that is?

1126
01:21:38,218 --> 01:21:42,189
It is clear, either your mother
stays in this house or me.

1127
01:21:42,743 --> 01:21:45,195
And that's how English
became my enemy, son.

1128
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:47,545
You don't need to worry if
you don't know English.

1129
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,759
A lot of people can't even
speak Kannada properly.

1130
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:51,604
I'll teach you English.

1131
01:21:51,684 --> 01:21:53,788
What are you saying?
English and me?

1132
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,276
That's impossible.

1133
01:21:56,632 --> 01:21:59,120
If you can learn Kannada, which
has such a huge diction..

1134
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,331
..then why not English, which
has only 26 alphabets.

1135
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:11,902
Asthma case.

1136
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:18,526
"House for sale"

1137
01:22:23,661 --> 01:22:28,087
"Whether it's a hut or a bungalow,
he never differentiates."

1138
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:31,527
"Always plays around."

1139
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:36,790
"Treats the young and
the old the same."

1140
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:42,648
"Respects everyone..and
lives with dignity."

1141
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:51,242
"He's rich but never arrogant."

1142
01:22:51,322 --> 01:22:56,179
"Always lost in the
good memories."

1143
01:22:56,259 --> 01:23:07,070
"Stay with us always
just like your father."

1144
01:23:07,534 --> 01:23:12,388
"You are lucky for us..
you are our life."

1145
01:23:24,683 --> 01:23:27,351
"Lights himself to
spread the light..

1146
01:23:27,431 --> 01:23:29,165
He's like a lamp."

1147
01:23:29,245 --> 01:23:32,805
"You're like a burning lamp."

1148
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:40,006
"Lord is the puppeteer,
and we're the puppets."

1149
01:23:40,086 --> 01:23:43,539
"He controls everyone."

1150
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:51,088
"My life has changed
for the good."

1151
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:55,923
"When you gave
happiness to them."

1152
01:23:56,003 --> 01:24:01,185
"Everyone should get a chance."

1153
01:24:01,265 --> 01:24:06,942
"No one's righteous like you."

1154
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:12,250
"You're like the sun and the
moon, no one's like you."

1155
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:15,365
"No one's like you."

1156
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:25,223
You call these pancakes.

1157
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,062
You don't even know how
to make them properly.

1158
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,209
Such terrible day
even on a festival.

1159
01:24:29,422 --> 01:24:31,660
I am so unfortunate.

1160
01:24:33,059 --> 01:24:37,016
I'll be there by 1:30.
Have your food. Okay.

1161
01:24:42,604 --> 01:24:44,396
Boss, boss, boss,
don't eat that.

1162
01:24:44,644 --> 01:24:46,781
The old man left that saying
it's not cooked properly.

1163
01:24:46,861 --> 01:24:49,489
I'll get you another one.

1164
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:50,207
Doesn't matter.

1165
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:52,173
Never get up in the middle
when you're eating.

1166
01:24:52,242 --> 01:24:54,136
Some people don't get
this much either..

1167
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,436
..and some people are so
unfortunate that no..

1168
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:57,036
..one cares whether
they ate or not.

1169
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:59,503
Our life is just a dream
for other people.

1170
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:01,149
We should be happy
with whatever we have.

1171
01:25:01,156 --> 01:25:03,986
Go get me some butter.

1172
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:11,568
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1173
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:16,424
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1174
01:25:16,504 --> 01:25:20,174
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1175
01:25:20,254 --> 01:25:25,013
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1176
01:25:27,219 --> 01:25:30,128
This is a big responsibility,
I am very happy.

1177
01:25:30,188 --> 01:25:32,534
I want to serve the
people and my party.

1178
01:25:33,355 --> 01:25:34,912
That's why I've been appointed
the Health Minister.

1179
01:25:34,992 --> 01:25:38,256
I will always execute my job and
my responsibility honestly.

1180
01:25:38,386 --> 01:25:41,387
Will you tell us about your schemes,
your plans, and your thoughts?

1181
01:25:41,413 --> 01:25:43,204
- Are you on Twitter?
- Yes, sir.

1182
01:25:43,284 --> 01:25:44,389
- Then follow me on Twitter.
- Okay, sir.

1183
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:46,041
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1184
01:25:51,387 --> 01:25:52,871
Grandma, are you really
learning English..

1185
01:25:52,873 --> 01:25:54,673
..or trying to fool us with
the book in your hand.

1186
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:58,571
- I am learning, son.
- I see.. let me test you.

1187
01:25:59,684 --> 01:26:00,648
What is this?

1188
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:04,026
FLOWER..Flower.

1189
01:26:04,106 --> 01:26:06,698
- What does that mean?
- It means 'Flower'.

1190
01:26:07,715 --> 01:26:09,002
And this?

1191
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:13,581
- P O W E R.. Power.
- Meaning?

1192
01:26:16,608 --> 01:26:17,914
Him!

1193
01:26:23,086 --> 01:26:24,313
- Nice!
- Yeah.

1194
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,752
My son's moving into
his new home today.

1195
01:26:31,907 --> 01:26:34,193
My son came all the way
here to invite me.

1196
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:40,715
I want to go but, I've left them
behind, as well as the house.

1197
01:26:41,222 --> 01:26:44,260
So, I feel strange
going there alone.

1198
01:26:49,535 --> 01:26:50,809
- Hi.
- Hi.

1199
01:26:55,374 --> 01:26:56,772
Papa.

1200
01:26:58,825 --> 01:27:00,052
Bless you.

1201
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:01,550
Are you okay?

1202
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:03,438
I am really happy
to see you here.

1203
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:04,038
- Hello.
- Hello.

1204
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:04,962
- Hello.
- Hello.

1205
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:06,567
Come, papa.

1206
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:27,620
- Sir, can I serve you some rice.
- No, it's enough.

1207
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,726
- Just a little..
- No..

1208
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:30,890
Don't force him if
he doesn't want to.

1209
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:32,508
He'll eat as much he wants.

1210
01:27:32,588 --> 01:27:36,140
Don't waste that rice you
can feed someone else.

1211
01:27:42,088 --> 01:27:42,910
Towel, papa.

1212
01:27:44,185 --> 01:27:46,317
You've built a nice home.

1213
01:27:46,356 --> 01:27:47,698
It's entirely my fault.

1214
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,602
If I stay here, I'll
only cause you trouble.

1215
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:55,713
If I ever hurt you,
then forgive me.

1216
01:27:58,512 --> 01:27:59,570
See you..

1217
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:02,309
Take care.

1218
01:28:04,565 --> 01:28:07,957
Papa. These things are
common in a family.

1219
01:28:08,037 --> 01:28:09,630
Don't gloat over it.

1220
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,659
You have a home, children,
granddaughter..

1221
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,123
..so why do you want to
live in that old age home?

1222
01:28:13,182 --> 01:28:15,699
- Listen to me, and please stay.
- Please, papa.

1223
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:17,930
Papa, please.

1224
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:23,558
Krishna.

1225
01:28:30,446 --> 01:28:33,939
Do come again..I'll
stay with my son now.

1226
01:28:37,003 --> 01:28:38,259
Papa!

1227
01:28:38,339 --> 01:28:39,886
Papa!

1228
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:53,428
Krishna, did you see
how happy he was?

1229
01:28:53,508 --> 01:28:54,912
No matter how much
we look after him..

1230
01:28:54,992 --> 01:28:56,673
..but he feels happy
around the children.

1231
01:28:57,044 --> 01:28:59,489
Children's love is
really essential.

1232
01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:03,855
Being happy doesn't mean
property, money fame or fortune.

1233
01:29:04,435 --> 01:29:06,445
We should learn to
be always happy.

1234
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,523
I am an orphan too.

1235
01:29:07,578 --> 01:29:09,412
But I got everything in life.

1236
01:29:09,492 --> 01:29:13,386
Even though he has everything,
why should he be an orphan?

1237
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:17,471
Every parent should be
happy with their children.

1238
01:29:26,758 --> 01:29:29,023
Parents got their
children polio vaccine..

1239
01:29:29,103 --> 01:29:31,572
..for the good health
of their children.

1240
01:29:32,057 --> 01:29:35,194
But these children fell
sick after the vaccination.

1241
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:37,715
The government hasn't
taken any action yet.

1242
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:40,123
They're left to
die..because they are poor.

1243
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,282
Those who indulge in corruption
in the name of Polio..

1244
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:45,362
..are demons and
not human beings.

1245
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:03,230
Doesn't matter what the
expenses will be..

1246
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:05,421
..but, our charity will
help you in every way.

1247
01:30:05,497 --> 01:30:07,227
- Okay.
- All these children should be cured.

1248
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:10,443
- You can call me anytime.
- Thank you, sir.

1249
01:30:12,027 --> 01:30:15,101
Uncle, I want to meet
that ex-Health Minister.

1250
01:30:16,813 --> 01:30:18,831
That's how the system works.

1251
01:30:19,138 --> 01:30:21,775
Isn't the quality of the polio drops
checked before sending to the booths?

1252
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,560
Everything was
perfectly alright.

1253
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:28,542
In fact, I personally got it checked
and then signed the papers.

1254
01:30:28,577 --> 01:30:30,951
I don't know what
happened overnight.

1255
01:30:32,446 --> 01:30:34,313
I was trapped.

1256
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,794
Siddharth, how will
this lab test help us?

1257
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:48,179
You see, uncle the samples
which the Minister checked..

1258
01:30:48,182 --> 01:30:50,781
..and the drops administered in
the booths are the same or not.

1259
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:52,525
What if the polio drops in
the booths are different?

1260
01:30:52,623 --> 01:30:55,607
We'll know who is
behind this scam.

1261
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,127
And then he will be exposed.

1262
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:00,948
You're right.

1263
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:10,284
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1264
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:13,749
- Long live..
- The Minister!

1265
01:31:34,212 --> 01:31:38,302
- What is the next program?
- Sir, you have to visit an old age home.

1266
01:32:07,382 --> 01:32:08,376
Yes, Mr. Tiwari.

1267
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:10,340
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Thank you.

1268
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:13,492
- We must speak.
- Yeah, see you in Delhi.

1269
01:32:32,109 --> 01:32:33,181
Goodbye.

1270
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,907
- You're doing a great job.
- Thank you.

1271
01:32:35,559 --> 01:32:37,610
- Appu, he's the Health Minister.
- Hello, sir.

1272
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:39,518
He came here to
celebrate his birthday.

1273
01:32:39,598 --> 01:32:42,299
- He is..
- You were praising our old age home.

1274
01:32:42,379 --> 01:32:43,689
The entire credit goes to him.

1275
01:32:43,769 --> 01:32:44,953
Very good.

1276
01:32:45,011 --> 01:32:47,776
I feel really proud of my country
when I see youngsters like you.

1277
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,858
People like you
should join politics.

1278
01:32:49,938 --> 01:32:50,836
It's a good platform.

1279
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,736
That's what my dad used to say.

1280
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,338
If you want to rule hearts, one
must have political power.

1281
01:32:55,418 --> 01:32:56,602
But, I love the masses, sir.

1282
01:32:56,682 --> 01:32:59,028
- All I need is my will power.
- Well said.

1283
01:32:59,108 --> 01:33:01,463
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1284
01:33:10,622 --> 01:33:12,872
- Engagement in such a situation..
- Siddharth.

1285
01:33:12,952 --> 01:33:15,569
Your father fixed
this engagement.

1286
01:33:15,649 --> 01:33:19,071
He would've celebrated
this if he had been alive.

1287
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,533
Say yes, Appu.

1288
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:27,050
Shall we?

1289
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:39,836
The auspicious time
is passing away.

1290
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:41,480
Call your family.

1291
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:45,954
Don't make excuses.

1292
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:48,592
Jagdish, call your
family members.

1293
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,879
We're running out of time.

1294
01:33:50,934 --> 01:33:53,370
Actually..

1295
01:33:53,968 --> 01:33:56,395
I guess the family is here.

1296
01:33:56,475 --> 01:34:00,591
Call them quickly we must begin the
rituals according to the scriptures.

1297
01:35:44,601 --> 01:35:47,582
Appu, the engagement's done.

1298
01:35:47,662 --> 01:35:51,896
But, you must throw a bachelor's
party before the wedding.

1299
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:53,566
Where will you take us?

1300
01:35:54,978 --> 01:35:59,277
Goa. Goa. Goa. Goa.

1301
01:36:09,949 --> 01:36:12,509
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

1302
01:36:12,972 --> 01:36:15,944
Stop drooling already.

1303
01:36:16,024 --> 01:36:17,113
We're in Goa.

1304
01:36:17,193 --> 01:36:20,464
We still have to get a massage,
and party hard, etc.etc.

1305
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:21,896
Happy ending.

1306
01:36:22,749 --> 01:36:25,377
- Happy ending meaning..
- All's well that ends well.

1307
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:30,831
You guys have a lot of plans, but you
need a guy who knows Goa really well.

1308
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:32,307
That is already arranged.

1309
01:36:32,387 --> 01:36:33,867
The guy is on the way.

1310
01:36:33,947 --> 01:36:39,540
'Regional song'

1311
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:45,193
'Regional song'

1312
01:36:45,273 --> 01:36:46,236
Hi, girls.

1313
01:36:46,316 --> 01:36:51,947
'Regional song'

1314
01:36:52,027 --> 01:36:56,688
'Regional song'

1315
01:36:57,225 --> 01:36:59,052
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hi.

1316
01:36:59,132 --> 01:37:00,470
Welcome to Goa.

1317
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,018

1318
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:06,209
I am Jayasurya Sushant aka
Joseph Anthony Gonsalves.

1319
01:37:06,578 --> 01:37:09,279
- That's my name.
- His name is even longer than he is.

1320
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:11,960
You see, I am from
karnataka settled in Goa.

1321
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,843
You're from Karnataka.
can guess from your face.

1322
01:37:15,593 --> 01:37:19,446
Ladies and Oldies, if you want any
information about Goa, then ask me.

1323
01:37:19,815 --> 01:37:21,884
Don't use Jio sim
because its free.

1324
01:37:21,964 --> 01:37:23,048
And this is my assistant.

1325
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,306
- Yes.
- We're at your service.

1326
01:37:25,788 --> 01:37:26,641
Who is this?

1327
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:29,109
A useless machine amongst
these old machineries.

1328
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:30,598
- I am the cook.
- What do you cook?

1329
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,338
- You will soon find out.
- For your kind information.

1330
01:37:33,808 --> 01:37:37,315
Do you guys want to see
Old Goa or New Goa?

1331
01:37:37,395 --> 01:37:41,014
- Or that Goa.
- What does 'that' mean?

1332
01:37:42,099 --> 01:37:44,244
Take you over there.

1333
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:51,729
Let's start, go, go.

1334
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:56,048
- Yes, come on..
- That's it. Come on.

1335
01:37:56,128 --> 01:37:58,151
- Nice..Come on..
- He's getting so excited at this age..

1336
01:37:58,231 --> 01:38:01,648
- Wonder what was he like when
he was young. - Come on, hard.

1337
01:38:01,786 --> 01:38:05,114
- Come on, come on..nice.
- Okay, go. Go.

1338
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:10,863
That cook wants to book her.

1339
01:38:13,162 --> 01:38:15,244
My son never made me this happy.

1340
01:38:15,324 --> 01:38:16,845
Don't worry.

1341
01:38:17,839 --> 01:38:19,967
No matter how much you
take care of your son..

1342
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:24,771
..but, after the marriage,
he goes his own way.

1343
01:38:24,851 --> 01:38:28,733
That's how life is nowadays.
Zip it.

1344
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:42,209
The old machineries are
cooling down in the pool.

1345
01:38:42,289 --> 01:38:44,097
What a useless boy.

1346
01:38:44,177 --> 01:38:46,483
Drinking coconut water in Goa.

1347
01:38:46,563 --> 01:38:48,287
Drink beer.

1348
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:51,076
It's really fun.
Throw this away.

1349
01:38:51,156 --> 01:38:52,930
Enjoy.

1350
01:38:57,458 --> 01:39:00,046
I saw what I
shouldn't have seen.

1351
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:03,574
Oh, God. They are
such mad people.

1352
01:39:03,654 --> 01:39:05,533
- Come on..come on.
- At least wear your underwear.

1353
01:39:05,613 --> 01:39:08,271
Don't you have a reputation?

1354
01:39:09,078 --> 01:39:10,437
Very good..

1355
01:39:12,022 --> 01:39:15,141
- Sir, soft drink.
- No, I don't want it. thanks.

1356
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:39,784
Hey, Appu. Come on, let's dance.

1357
01:39:39,941 --> 01:39:40,756
Coming.

1358
01:39:40,836 --> 01:39:41,613
Excuse me, sir.

1359
01:39:41,693 --> 01:39:43,908
Sir, this cruise and this
getup are very expensive.

1360
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:47,031
Is that alright? Is it okay?

1361
01:39:47,884 --> 01:39:50,737
You can spend all you want.

1362
01:39:51,724 --> 01:39:55,630
Hello..he's our debit
card and credit card.

1363
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:57,679
His father is like Aadhar card.

1364
01:39:57,759 --> 01:40:00,509
- You can swipe all you want.
- Bloody midget.

1365
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,271
- Hi, having fun?
- Thank you.

1366
01:40:03,351 --> 01:40:04,712
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1367
01:40:04,792 --> 01:40:07,705
- Have a foreign drink?
- No, I'll drink Indian.

1368
01:40:07,785 --> 01:40:11,747
- You're in Goa, have a foreign drink?
- No, I drink Indian drink.

1369
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:16,244
When I was in trouble, and sad,
Vinay Maliya helped me out.

1370
01:40:16,324 --> 01:40:19,380
Now he's in trouble, so
I should help him out.

1371
01:40:19,535 --> 01:40:21,714
Drunkards are honest,
and not like you.

1372
01:40:21,794 --> 01:40:22,522
Cheers..

1373
01:40:24,033 --> 01:40:26,480
What is this? You're
playing such a sad song.

1374
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,955
Hey, man, this song is not nice.

1375
01:40:29,103 --> 01:40:32,839
Put something new..

1376
01:40:33,554 --> 01:40:37,466
Useless, I can speak your dialect
too..I am from your area.

1377
01:40:37,546 --> 01:40:38,715
I'll play something nice.

1378
01:40:38,795 --> 01:40:40,893
- Go have a drink..run away.
- Okay.

1379
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:45,458
This is the fun.

1380
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:54,447
"It's a face-off
(battle), Oh my love! "

1381
01:40:55,002 --> 01:41:02,132
"It's a face-off, Oh Lord!
Oh my love!"

1382
01:41:02,687 --> 01:41:09,818
"When our caravan
of love set out.."

1383
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:14,099
"..people got jealous,
lovers got united."

1384
01:41:14,179 --> 01:41:16,863
"That's the tradition of love."

1385
01:41:18,076 --> 01:41:24,841
"It's a face-off
(battle), Oh my love!"

1386
01:41:25,732 --> 01:41:32,736
"It's a face-off, Oh Lord!
Oh my love!"

1387
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:51,652
I tell him not to drink so
much, but he doesn't listen.

1388
01:41:51,732 --> 01:41:54,809
The doctor's said he'll
die if he drinks.

1389
01:41:54,855 --> 01:41:57,565
He also has a heart
problem, boss.

1390
01:41:58,838 --> 01:42:00,221
I love you.

1391
01:42:02,196 --> 01:42:03,197
Take care.

1392
01:42:15,315 --> 01:42:17,268
This old man seems
to be in a hurry.

1393
01:42:18,724 --> 01:42:20,151
- Is everyone ready?
- Ready!

1394
01:42:20,231 --> 01:42:21,569
- Ready!
- Come, come,

1395
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:24,566
- Enjoy, enjoy.
- Okay.

1396
01:42:24,646 --> 01:42:26,289
Don't miss anything.

1397
01:42:29,881 --> 01:42:31,827
You can't even stand
on your feet..

1398
01:42:31,996 --> 01:42:33,919
..yet you have hope.

1399
01:42:33,999 --> 01:42:36,560
Good, good, good..enjoy.

1400
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,822
These old men are
enjoying their life.

1401
01:42:41,784 --> 01:42:43,251
All the old men are
getting a massage..

1402
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:44,673
..and you're busying
messaging someone.

1403
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:48,479
They are getting physical enjoyment,
while you're happy watching it.

1404
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:51,517
I guess your life
is a closed book.

1405
01:42:51,528 --> 01:42:53,167
How did you know?

1406
01:42:53,512 --> 01:42:57,457
You don't even open your eyes
properly how will you see this world?

1407
01:42:57,817 --> 01:42:59,043
- Open your's first.
- What?

1408
01:42:59,109 --> 01:43:00,376
Eyes!

1409
01:43:02,838 --> 01:43:04,522
I'll get a massage too.

1410
01:43:07,187 --> 01:43:08,422
That was fun.

1411
01:43:09,036 --> 01:43:12,511
- Stop.
- Wait..where are you going?

1412
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:19,951
Careful.

1413
01:43:20,702 --> 01:43:22,616
Do slowly, don't press on that.

1414
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:23,837
- Okay.
- Carefully.

1415
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:35,955
Careful..very good.

1416
01:43:38,193 --> 01:43:40,469
Let's jump..higher.

1417
01:43:40,549 --> 01:43:42,725
You try.

1418
01:43:42,955 --> 01:43:44,962
- You'll enjoy this.
- Can't you just drive straight?

1419
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:46,247
What are you saying?

1420
01:43:46,327 --> 01:43:47,974
Let me show you..

1421
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:57,205
He was forcing me to drink beer.

1422
01:43:57,285 --> 01:43:59,041
But now he's dead from
drinking all that sea water.

1423
01:44:18,356 --> 01:44:20,603
"- Love me or hate me."
- Nice singing.

1424
01:44:20,683 --> 01:44:22,733
"- Kiss me or kill me."
- Come on, enjoy.

1425
01:44:22,813 --> 01:44:25,912
"Oh darling, do
something with me."

1426
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:34,361
Sir, I've been noticing
since yesterday.

1427
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,766
Everyone's enjoying.

1428
01:44:35,846 --> 01:44:38,414
But you two are quiet.
What's the matter?

1429
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:41,673
Last year we came
here with our family.

1430
01:44:42,227 --> 01:44:44,024
We are missing those days.

1431
01:44:44,907 --> 01:44:49,728
By the way, parents never want to
live separate from their children.

1432
01:44:50,335 --> 01:44:52,274
'Papa, I want to
live separately.

1433
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,421
How much more trouble will I
have to bear for this family?'

1434
01:44:54,426 --> 01:44:56,652
'Why? You're not alone
shouldering the burden.

1435
01:44:56,663 --> 01:44:57,535
I work hard too.'

1436
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,999
'Does he have to do everything if
he's the eldest in the house?'

1437
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:01,071
'Think before you speak.

1438
01:45:01,151 --> 01:45:03,551
He bought the TV and
fridge in this house.'

1439
01:45:03,551 --> 01:45:04,629
'But everyone uses them.'

1440
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,690
'I am tired of debating over
this house is his or mine.'

1441
01:45:06,749 --> 01:45:09,839
'I want to live separately
now, please give me my share.'

1442
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:13,612
A family is when
everyone lives together.

1443
01:45:14,185 --> 01:45:17,362
Don't worry, sir.
Everything will be fine.

1444
01:45:23,049 --> 01:45:24,234
Hello, sir.

1445
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,866
Is everything okay, sir?

1446
01:45:26,592 --> 01:45:30,096
- By the way, which is his parent?
- No one.

1447
01:45:30,176 --> 01:45:33,367
- I want to know whose son he is.
- No one.

1448
01:45:33,447 --> 01:45:36,587
He treats everyone in this
old age home as his parents.

1449
01:45:36,667 --> 01:45:39,148
And they treat him
like their child.

1450
01:45:39,228 --> 01:45:41,616
- No one's related here.
- Great..

1451
01:45:41,983 --> 01:45:45,707
People spend their
lives differentiating.

1452
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:48,370
And he's happy in
making others happy.

1453
01:45:48,391 --> 01:45:50,721
He has a big heart.

1454
01:45:55,293 --> 01:45:58,123
'Family is when everyone
lives together.'

1455
01:46:07,839 --> 01:46:09,390
Happy Birthday.

1456
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:12,181
Happy Birthday, Appu.

1457
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:16,557
You're surprised
how we found out.

1458
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:19,527
Well, if you can worry for us..

1459
01:46:19,607 --> 01:46:21,974
..we can know things
about you too.

1460
01:46:22,172 --> 01:46:24,443
Don't think you're alone.

1461
01:46:24,782 --> 01:46:26,910
We're with you.

1462
01:46:27,438 --> 01:46:30,936
Happy Birthday to you!

1463
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:33,792
Happy Birthday to you!

1464
01:46:33,872 --> 01:46:36,513
Happy Birthday, Dear Appu.

1465
01:46:37,315 --> 01:46:40,905
Appu, get married really soon.

1466
01:46:40,985 --> 01:46:45,066
And have a dozen kids.
And be happy.

1467
01:46:47,405 --> 01:46:50,667
"Come on, come on Boys-girls..
let's start this super show."

1468
01:46:50,747 --> 01:46:54,583
"This is going to
be a lot of fun."

1469
01:46:59,725 --> 01:47:02,932
"Come on, come on Boys-girls..
let's start this super show."

1470
01:47:03,012 --> 01:47:06,419
"All the Appu fans let's dance."

1471
01:47:12,514 --> 01:47:14,025
"He's Shaktimaan."

1472
01:47:14,105 --> 01:47:15,630
"Like Chota Bheem."

1473
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:18,631
"There's no one like you."

1474
01:47:18,711 --> 01:47:20,204
"He's Superman.."

1475
01:47:20,284 --> 01:47:21,743
"He's Batman!"

1476
01:47:21,823 --> 01:47:24,953
"You are my macho man."

1477
01:47:25,033 --> 01:47:26,410
"Here comes James Bond,

1478
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:27,891
My dear beloved."

1479
01:47:27,971 --> 01:47:29,452
"He's super strong."

1480
01:47:29,532 --> 01:47:31,381
"Let's go 1-2..1-2.."

1481
01:47:31,461 --> 01:47:37,637
"Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star
we're loving power star."

1482
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:38,728
"Dance-dance-dance."

1483
01:47:38,808 --> 01:47:40,267
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1484
01:47:40,347 --> 01:47:41,806
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1485
01:47:41,886 --> 01:47:43,814
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1486
01:47:43,894 --> 01:47:49,933
"1..2..3..4..5 star.."
"..we're loving power star."

1487
01:47:50,013 --> 01:47:52,644
"Dance-dance-dance Appu
dance-dance-dance."

1488
01:47:52,724 --> 01:47:56,503
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1489
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,599
"Once upon a time.. I am
like a diamond in the sky.."

1490
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:29,646
"I am here to win every heart."

1491
01:48:29,726 --> 01:48:32,750
"I am like the internet,
I can give anything."

1492
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:35,589
"Ask whatever you
want, sweetheart."

1493
01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:38,651
"- Live your life with a smile.
- Appu, right."

1494
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:41,527
"- Let our hearts unite and fall in love.
- Appu, right."

1495
01:48:41,607 --> 01:48:47,571
"I am this hero's
partner and his life."

1496
01:48:48,617 --> 01:48:51,676
"First day, first
show..watch this film."

1497
01:48:51,756 --> 01:48:55,145
"Be happy.. And wait
for the twist."

1498
01:48:55,225 --> 01:49:01,727
"Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star
we're loving power star."

1499
01:49:01,807 --> 01:49:04,068
"Dance-dance-dance Appu
dance-dance-dance."

1500
01:49:04,148 --> 01:49:07,445
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1501
01:49:07,525 --> 01:49:13,673
"1..2..3..4..5 star we're
loving power star."

1502
01:49:13,753 --> 01:49:16,351
"Dance-dance-dance Appu
dance-dance-dance."

1503
01:49:16,431 --> 01:49:19,814
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1504
01:49:19,894 --> 01:49:24,794
"You're my Appu buddy come
on we really want the power"

1505
01:49:26,305 --> 01:49:32,130
"We are ready for the party,
just show me all the power"

1506
01:49:52,787 --> 01:49:58,856
"Whenever I am close to you why
do I feel your eyes are on me."

1507
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:02,275
"Since I started dancing
to your tunes.."

1508
01:50:02,355 --> 01:50:05,345
"..I cannot see anything
except for your love."

1509
01:50:05,425 --> 01:50:08,098
"- I've come here only for you.
- Appu, right."

1510
01:50:08,178 --> 01:50:11,000
"- You're the only one I am going to love.
- Appu, right."

1511
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:17,168
"We met just yesterday..but
now you dwell in my heart."

1512
01:50:17,248 --> 01:50:20,259
"Here comes James Bond,
My dear beloved."

1513
01:50:20,339 --> 01:50:21,749
"He's super strong."

1514
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:23,729
"Let's go 1-2..1-2.."

1515
01:50:23,809 --> 01:50:29,943
"Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star
we're loving power star."

1516
01:50:30,023 --> 01:50:32,537
"Dance-dance-dance Appu
dance-dance-dance."

1517
01:50:32,617 --> 01:50:36,087
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1518
01:50:36,167 --> 01:50:42,208
"1..2..3..4..5 star we're
loving power star."

1519
01:50:42,288 --> 01:50:44,930
"Dance-dance-dance Appu
dance-dance-dance."

1520
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:48,807
"Appu dance-dance-dance."

1521
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:54,069
Children are falling sick
after getting polio drops.

1522
01:50:54,156 --> 01:50:55,242
Look, what happened to him?

1523
01:50:55,322 --> 01:50:58,499
Something happened to my son.
Please save him.

1524
01:50:58,579 --> 01:50:59,916
We must give them
vaccine immediately.

1525
01:50:59,996 --> 01:51:01,124
But, it's not in the hospital.

1526
01:51:01,204 --> 01:51:02,153
- It's costly.
- Oh God.

1527
01:51:02,233 --> 01:51:03,799
Get it from somewhere
outside, doctor.

1528
01:51:03,879 --> 01:51:05,375
Don't worry about the expenses.

1529
01:51:05,455 --> 01:51:06,310
Doctor..

1530
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:09,145
Transfer the funds to my
account, immediately.

1531
01:51:09,214 --> 01:51:12,012
Doctor, please take a
look at my daughter.

1532
01:51:12,092 --> 01:51:14,472
- What's wrong with my daughter?
- Oh God!

1533
01:51:14,552 --> 01:51:15,227
Sir..

1534
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:18,156
Sir, why are you worried?

1535
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:19,863
Is your family member
admitted here?

1536
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:23,498
- Or maybe some kid you know?
- Yes..

1537
01:51:23,578 --> 01:51:25,799
Doctor, see what's
wrong with my son.

1538
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:28,426
None of my family members
are amongst them.

1539
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:33,907
But, this is happening
because of my family, son.

1540
01:51:34,614 --> 01:51:44,877
..the reason is the current Health
Minister Jagannath, and he's my son.

1541
01:51:46,127 --> 01:51:49,323
'There was a competition between the
two to become the Health Minister.'

1542
01:51:49,605 --> 01:51:51,635
'High Command chose Shridhar.'

1543
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,499
'He knew that he would
become the minister..'

1544
01:51:53,554 --> 01:51:56,270
'..that's why Jagannath
okayed a 2 billion project.'

1545
01:51:56,350 --> 01:52:00,925
'Whereas he planned to sabotage NRI
Ashok and Shridhar's polio program.'

1546
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:07,065
Stop, stop..

1547
01:52:07,792 --> 01:52:12,172
Sir, I am a journalist. I've
information about the polio vaccine.

1548
01:52:12,252 --> 01:52:15,359
When I was performing a sting
operation, some gang attacked me.

1549
01:52:15,617 --> 01:52:17,280
Some bigshot is
behind this, sir.

1550
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,372
If I keep this camera with
me, I'll be in grave danger.

1551
01:52:19,452 --> 01:52:20,188
They will kill me.

1552
01:52:20,268 --> 01:52:22,336
Please handover this camera to
the police, sir. Please, sir.

1553
01:52:22,519 --> 01:52:24,676
Jagannath was no
longer a human being..

1554
01:52:24,756 --> 01:52:25,981
..he had turned into a demon.

1555
01:52:26,061 --> 01:52:28,412
Jagannath! I tried to
used the camera footage..

1556
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:30,834
..to make him surrender.

1557
01:52:30,914 --> 01:52:33,440
But he threatened me
instead and made..

1558
01:52:33,845 --> 01:52:35,238
..the inspector shoot the
journalist in front of my eyes.

1559
01:52:35,318 --> 01:52:37,393
Sir, don't kill me. Please.

1560
01:52:37,993 --> 01:52:39,114
Father..

1561
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:45,612
I ran away to give that
evidence to the media..

1562
01:52:46,033 --> 01:52:48,540
..but his goons were
looking for me everywhere.

1563
01:52:48,884 --> 01:52:53,198
I even went to the Police
Commissioner to ask for justice.

1564
01:52:53,355 --> 01:52:54,227
But..

1565
01:52:56,178 --> 01:52:59,996
I knew that the medicine cannot
be stopped from circulation..

1566
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,734
..that's why I went to the place
where the Health Minister..

1567
01:53:01,814 --> 01:53:03,955
..was going to
inaugurate the vaccine.

1568
01:53:04,026 --> 01:53:05,968
But my effort was a waste..

1569
01:53:06,173 --> 01:53:10,712
..and I couldn't raise a voice
against this injustice.

1570
01:53:11,971 --> 01:53:15,165
He killed innocent
children for that post.

1571
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:19,224
But, he couldn't
erase the evidence.

1572
01:53:19,592 --> 01:53:24,607
But, I have evidence of his
misdeeds saved on a hard disk.

1573
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:28,309
Even though I had proof,
no one believed me.

1574
01:53:28,882 --> 01:53:34,863
It's me, sir..Non Resident Indian
(NRI) Ashok's son Siddharth.

1575
01:53:35,319 --> 01:53:38,087
I was waiting for this proof.

1576
01:53:38,706 --> 01:53:41,810
Now I can use this to
prove my dad's innocence.

1577
01:53:41,944 --> 01:53:44,600
You can prove that your
father's innocent.

1578
01:53:44,952 --> 01:53:47,124
But, what about those
innocent kids.

1579
01:53:47,218 --> 01:53:50,339
This evidence is enough to
put my son behind bars.

1580
01:53:50,433 --> 01:53:52,393
But, he will be out in 6 months.

1581
01:53:52,448 --> 01:53:54,047
Political power.

1582
01:53:54,122 --> 01:53:59,303
No..he must face the same ordeal
as the parents of those children.

1583
01:53:59,395 --> 01:54:01,160
He must admit that
it was his mistake.

1584
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,199
He must be punished.

1585
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:06,483
This is not your problem
alone, Siddharth.

1586
01:54:06,595 --> 01:54:08,330
It's about the entire people.

1587
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:11,421
You must fight this
battle for the people.

1588
01:54:15,974 --> 01:54:19,909
Today on Public Talk we have with
us Jagannath, our Health Minister.

1589
01:54:19,989 --> 01:54:21,744
- Welcome to Public Talk.
- Hello.

1590
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:24,866
As you know, in this program the
public will ask you questions..

1591
01:54:24,946 --> 01:54:28,154
- ..and you must answer them.
- Sure. Ask.

1592
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:32,517
Hello, sir. The people have to suffer
because of the shortage of ambulance.

1593
01:54:32,597 --> 01:54:33,691
I know that.

1594
01:54:33,771 --> 01:54:37,091
I've already approved 500 ambulances
for Bengaluru and other districts.

1595
01:54:37,286 --> 01:54:39,989
The next question..

1596
01:54:42,587 --> 01:54:43,835
Yes, gentlemen.

1597
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:46,851
Sir, the government
hasn't given any aide..

1598
01:54:46,931 --> 01:54:48,539
..to the children
affected by Polio.

1599
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:51,185
No, no, no, you've wrong information.
That is wrong.

1600
01:54:51,265 --> 01:54:53,378
The government has already
given a go ahead.

1601
01:54:53,436 --> 01:54:56,344
The Child Welfare
Association says..

1602
01:54:56,423 --> 01:54:59,426
..that they haven't received
any grant from the government.

1603
01:54:59,934 --> 01:55:02,982
- Excuse me. Pass it on.
- Yes, sir.

1604
01:55:06,477 --> 01:55:08,846
Oh, what a surprise. I am sorry.

1605
01:55:08,926 --> 01:55:11,247
I never received this. I
don't even know about this.

1606
01:55:11,313 --> 01:55:12,536
I'll solve this.

1607
01:55:12,607 --> 01:55:15,145
There are other
problems to solve, sir.

1608
01:55:15,712 --> 01:55:18,917
The medicines certified by the Drug
Control Department of Karnataka.

1609
01:55:18,997 --> 01:55:21,620
..and approved by the
ex-Health Minister..

1610
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,480
..and the medicines delivered to
the Polio booth are different.

1611
01:55:24,577 --> 01:55:28,025
Look here..lab reports.

1612
01:55:30,808 --> 01:55:33,773
Someone else is
behind this, sir.

1613
01:55:33,854 --> 01:55:35,390
We must expose them.

1614
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,836
Yes, we must..

1615
01:55:37,916 --> 01:55:41,024
The people should know, and
so should the government.

1616
01:55:41,072 --> 01:55:43,431
This case should be
handed to the CBI.

1617
01:55:43,511 --> 01:55:46,831
Yes, CBI. Give it to the CBI.
Give it to the CBI.

1618
01:55:47,793 --> 01:55:50,620
The rascal who toyed with the
lives of innocent children..

1619
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:51,984
..should be punished.

1620
01:55:52,064 --> 01:55:53,409
This case should be
handed to the CBI.

1621
01:55:53,489 --> 01:55:55,813
- That's what we demand.
- Yeah, you're right.

1622
01:55:56,124 --> 01:55:57,318
That's the right thing to do.

1623
01:55:57,915 --> 01:55:59,590
The government is
with the public.

1624
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,250
And, we must do as
the people say.

1625
01:56:03,284 --> 01:56:05,727
We'll hand this over to the CBI.

1626
01:56:05,747 --> 01:56:07,398
You have my complete support.

1627
01:56:07,473 --> 01:56:09,930
I'll talk to the government and hand
this case over to the government.

1628
01:56:09,988 --> 01:56:11,003
- Thank you.
- Thank you gentleman..

1629
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:13,483
- ..for bringing this matter to the light.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1630
01:56:13,506 --> 01:56:14,517
Thank you.

1631
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:15,994
Thank you for coming, sir.

1632
01:56:16,019 --> 01:56:17,375
Thank you.

1633
01:56:44,808 --> 01:56:47,412
Hey..stop!

1634
01:56:48,051 --> 01:56:49,319
Stop the car!

1635
01:56:57,367 --> 01:56:59,766
He's telling me to hand
over this case to CBI.

1636
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:02,379
He thinks he's smart.

1637
01:57:02,422 --> 01:57:05,526
I've seen him somewhere.
But where?

1638
01:57:07,573 --> 01:57:10,656
He lives where my father lives.

1639
01:57:10,709 --> 01:57:14,032
That means my father is
hiding at the old age home.

1640
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:19,013
Sir, I thought we were safe..

1641
01:57:19,025 --> 01:57:21,460
- ..but we're all going to get in trouble.
- What happened?

1642
01:57:21,518 --> 01:57:24,615
I thought that no one will
question us if we blame an NRI.

1643
01:57:25,047 --> 01:57:27,560
But there's a man who has come
forward to ask questions.

1644
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:30,356
The guy who was
questioning you..

1645
01:57:30,357 --> 01:57:31,834
- ..was the NRI's son.
- Oh my, God.

1646
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:33,482
He has all the case details.

1647
01:57:33,536 --> 01:57:36,213
So they want to destroy us.

1648
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:39,855
That proof have with my father.
And he want to prove it.

1649
01:57:39,935 --> 01:57:44,433
If we'll leave him like this
then he will destroy us.

1650
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:46,142
Hello.

1651
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:54,369
Like you said, I paid
the hospital bills.

1652
01:57:54,503 --> 01:57:56,055
But are those kids safe?

1653
01:57:56,398 --> 01:57:59,683
You did a good job saving
those kids, Siddharth.

1654
01:57:59,695 --> 01:58:01,248
It's my duty, sir.

1655
01:58:26,094 --> 01:58:28,886
- They..they are Jagannath's men.
- Hey, stop!

1656
01:58:52,308 --> 01:58:53,932
Hey, come out everyone.

1657
01:58:54,278 --> 01:58:56,303
Now you're scared
and hiding inside.

1658
01:58:56,483 --> 01:59:00,335
You were questioning our
boss on television.

1659
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:02,891
You wanted to show your
strength, didn't you?

1660
01:59:02,922 --> 01:59:04,598
- Come out.
- Come out.

1661
01:59:05,426 --> 01:59:07,532
I said come out.

1662
01:59:16,593 --> 01:59:21,605
Hey..you guys are
sycophants of your boss.

1663
01:59:22,357 --> 01:59:26,736
But he needs no one..he's
a power house himself.

1664
02:01:15,465 --> 02:01:17,145
Sir, you must leave
for Delhi tomorrow.

1665
02:01:17,225 --> 02:01:19,738
You have a meeting
with the High Command!

1666
02:01:37,046 --> 02:01:40,046
Sending 10 men to kill
me isn't your fault.

1667
02:01:40,882 --> 02:01:44,329
But it's your mistake
that I'll be scared.

1668
02:01:44,818 --> 02:01:46,448
I give you a week's time.

1669
02:01:47,016 --> 02:01:49,612
You must admit to your mistake
and surrender yourself.

1670
02:01:49,692 --> 02:01:52,016
- What if I don't?
- I will make you.

1671
02:01:52,053 --> 02:01:54,334
I still have that hard
disk as evidence.

1672
02:01:54,414 --> 02:01:58,081
I'll spread that video over
TV, internet, and phone.

1673
02:01:58,852 --> 02:02:00,254
Then the public will drag
you out of your home.

1674
02:02:00,699 --> 02:02:02,949
Don't get carried away, hand
over that evidence to me.

1675
02:02:03,285 --> 02:02:06,969
And you can take all the
money you want in return.

1676
02:02:07,683 --> 02:02:11,856
My dad was an honest
man, and so am I.

1677
02:02:12,276 --> 02:02:14,240
The consequences
will be really bad.

1678
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,336
If you attack me 100 times,
I'll retaliate 100 times.

1679
02:02:18,707 --> 02:02:23,175
But, if I attack..then that will
become tomorrow's headlines.

1680
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:38,624
Appu.

1681
02:02:39,308 --> 02:02:39,871
Appu.

1682
02:02:40,366 --> 02:02:42,119
I haven't seen the old
lady since morning.

1683
02:02:42,992 --> 02:02:44,564
- What?
- She knows nothing around Bengaluru..

1684
02:02:44,644 --> 02:02:46,308
..she's never gone out
of the old age home.

1685
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:48,348
I don't know where she could be.

1686
02:02:48,489 --> 02:02:51,820
The consequences can be worse.

1687
02:02:54,282 --> 02:02:57,965
I really like my grandson.

1688
02:02:58,028 --> 02:02:59,439
Come, Krishna.

1689
02:03:07,167 --> 02:03:08,661
You love your grandson.

1690
02:03:09,142 --> 02:03:10,691
But you're afraid
to talk to him.

1691
02:03:10,699 --> 02:03:13,539
How long are you going
to hide your love?

1692
02:03:15,421 --> 02:03:16,260
Abhi!

1693
02:03:18,558 --> 02:03:20,324
How long has this been going on?

1694
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:23,501
How many times have I told you
not to mingle with this lady?

1695
02:03:23,667 --> 02:03:24,909
What lady?

1696
02:03:26,448 --> 02:03:28,320
You're a lady, I am a lady.

1697
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,423
You're a mother, I am a mother.

1698
02:03:30,503 --> 02:03:32,498
You have a son, I have a son.

1699
02:03:32,626 --> 02:03:36,230
The only difference is I
am good, and you're bad.

1700
02:03:37,247 --> 02:03:37,973
Did you hear that?

1701
02:03:38,053 --> 02:03:40,581
Now I've to hear that from
this illiterate woman.

1702
02:03:40,644 --> 02:03:44,977
If he keeps meeting this old
woman, my son will get spoiled.

1703
02:03:45,063 --> 02:03:49,324
If you say another word against
mother, I won't stay quiet.

1704
02:03:49,605 --> 02:03:52,674
She's speaking in English too,
you're the one who has no values.

1705
02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:54,021
Abhi come let's go.

1706
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:58,045
No mom. I want to stay
with my grandmother.

1707
02:03:58,602 --> 02:04:00,859
- Abhi.
- Now do you get it?

1708
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:04,686
When your son didn't
follow you, you felt hurt.

1709
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:08,751
And you kept us apart all these
years, imagine our plight.

1710
02:04:15,746 --> 02:04:16,882
Mom..

1711
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:20,600
You proved that you're a son.

1712
02:04:20,806 --> 02:04:22,765
Forgive me, mom.

1713
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:25,342
Let's go home.

1714
02:04:25,869 --> 02:04:27,445
This won't happen again.

1715
02:04:27,601 --> 02:04:29,208
Doesn't matter, son.

1716
02:04:29,529 --> 02:04:34,114
My other son is here
to look after me.

1717
02:04:36,327 --> 02:04:40,256
- Appu, I'll keep visiting you.
- Of course, grandma.

1718
02:04:40,278 --> 02:04:42,001
- Let's go.
- Yes, dear.

1719
02:04:43,018 --> 02:04:46,075
Appu, I text you..whatsapp.

1720
02:04:46,122 --> 02:04:47,517
- Bye.
- Bye.

1721
02:04:56,116 --> 02:04:57,042
Calm down.

1722
02:04:57,122 --> 02:04:59,575
There's no point
in shedding tears.

1723
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:01,160
It won't melt your
children's heart.

1724
02:05:01,181 --> 02:05:02,901
Chikkanna, take him to his room.

1725
02:05:02,981 --> 02:05:04,213
- Yes. Come, sir.
- Go.

1726
02:05:04,453 --> 02:05:06,593
- Go.
- If you had cried when you should have..

1727
02:05:06,595 --> 02:05:08,241
..then you wouldn't
be crying now.

1728
02:05:08,325 --> 02:05:09,889
How many children
you do you have?

1729
02:05:09,999 --> 02:05:11,741
Krishna..monthly expenses.

1730
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:15,297
He came here seeking
refuge, and I took him in.

1731
02:05:15,377 --> 02:05:17,367
When one leaves,
another one joins in.

1732
02:05:17,551 --> 02:05:19,765
People never change.

1733
02:05:21,918 --> 02:05:22,519
Yes.

1734
02:05:22,599 --> 02:05:25,661
Brother, ex-Health Minister is
out of prison by NRI's son.

1735
02:05:26,232 --> 02:05:28,096
- Long live..
- Shridhar.

1736
02:05:28,176 --> 02:05:30,159
- Long live..
- Shridhar.

1737
02:05:31,341 --> 02:05:33,963
If the CBI takes over this
case, then I will cooperate.

1738
02:05:34,043 --> 02:05:36,298
Ex-Health Minister is
out of jail on bail.

1739
02:05:36,427 --> 02:05:38,761
There's a new twist in
the Polio scam case.

1740
02:05:38,841 --> 02:05:40,231
This is prashanth from Bengaluru

1741
02:05:51,106 --> 02:05:52,282
Did you find the evidence?

1742
02:05:52,378 --> 02:05:55,028
No, sir. I looked everywhere.

1743
02:06:01,105 --> 02:06:04,170
Only one more room
left to search.

1744
02:06:04,291 --> 02:06:06,176
I don't know what you will do.

1745
02:06:07,329 --> 02:06:08,952
But I want that
evidence tonight.

1746
02:06:09,186 --> 02:06:10,341
Otherwise, the
consequences will be bad.

1747
02:06:10,421 --> 02:06:12,429
I'll get it done tonight.

1748
02:06:29,462 --> 02:06:31,722
90 percent survival
is difficult.

1749
02:06:32,235 --> 02:06:34,911
Give this news to his children.

1750
02:06:38,395 --> 02:06:40,700
He has only one son,
and he lives abroad.

1751
02:06:41,058 --> 02:06:42,238
Krishna, his number.

1752
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,877
The diary with the
number is in your room.

1753
02:06:43,935 --> 02:06:45,946
Fine, I'll talk to him.

1754
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:11,396
These things are common
when one gets old.

1755
02:07:11,418 --> 02:07:12,316
I cannot come right away.

1756
02:07:12,396 --> 02:07:14,354
Sir, at least you can
talk to him on the phone.

1757
02:07:14,367 --> 02:07:15,749
What's left to talk?

1758
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:17,268
He'll say the same old things.

1759
02:07:17,348 --> 02:07:18,353
And I'll get angry.

1760
02:07:18,433 --> 02:07:20,522
If its money you need,
I'll make the transfer.

1761
02:07:20,602 --> 02:07:22,782
You can do the rest.

1762
02:07:36,164 --> 02:07:36,815
Appu..

1763
02:07:37,524 --> 02:07:39,337
Rafi sir is conscious.

1764
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,882
He's insisting on
calling his son.

1765
02:07:41,962 --> 02:07:44,053
I don't know what to do.

1766
02:07:44,443 --> 02:07:46,338
Please try again.

1767
02:07:54,512 --> 02:07:56,675
Talk to him, your
son is on the line.

1768
02:07:56,997 --> 02:07:58,830
Talk to him, please.

1769
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:04,132
Asif, how are you?

1770
02:08:04,947 --> 02:08:07,029
I am fine, papa.

1771
02:08:07,212 --> 02:08:08,138
How are you now?

1772
02:08:08,218 --> 02:08:10,133
I am fine too.

1773
02:08:10,613 --> 02:08:11,976
You'll be fine.

1774
02:08:12,016 --> 02:08:13,389
Don't think too much.

1775
02:08:13,448 --> 02:08:15,875
I am coming tomorrow,
with my family.

1776
02:08:17,181 --> 02:08:18,192
You will be alright.

1777
02:08:18,272 --> 02:08:19,782
Goodbye, son.

1778
02:08:19,862 --> 02:08:21,292
Goodbye, father.

1779
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,383
Krishna, did you give
him all the tablets?

1780
02:08:29,463 --> 02:08:32,424
- No, not yet.
- Fine, sit down.

1781
02:08:34,133 --> 02:08:37,172
You act well.

1782
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:41,752
You talked to me on the phone.

1783
02:08:43,126 --> 02:08:46,249
The voice may have
sounded like my son.

1784
02:08:46,301 --> 02:08:49,160
But you talked to me.

1785
02:08:49,214 --> 02:08:51,174
I know, son..

1786
02:08:51,815 --> 02:08:54,952
I recognized you
through your breath.

1787
02:08:55,244 --> 02:08:58,809
That rascal doesn't
want to talk to me.

1788
02:08:58,867 --> 02:09:02,137
It's true. Only
because I insisted..

1789
02:09:02,498 --> 02:09:05,809
..you couldn't see my plight.

1790
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:10,838
I just want to say that
I am dying happily.

1791
02:09:12,264 --> 02:09:15,099
In these 68 years..

1792
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:19,238
..I only lived a
few days happily.

1793
02:09:19,533 --> 02:09:23,152
And, only after you
came in my life.

1794
02:09:23,952 --> 02:09:29,085
You gave me every
happiness I desired.

1795
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:37,772
You also gave me a
life I never imagined.

1796
02:09:38,794 --> 02:09:42,919
You came in life like God.

1797
02:09:42,930 --> 02:09:46,236
You're the real Rajkumara
(Prince) for me.

1798
02:09:46,309 --> 02:09:50,028
You mean more to me than my son.

1799
02:09:52,568 --> 02:09:58,631
If I am born again, I'll
be reborn as your son.

1800
02:09:58,711 --> 02:10:01,799
To repay your debts.

1801
02:11:07,283 --> 02:11:08,320
Sir.

1802
02:11:13,554 --> 02:11:16,625
- Hello. - Boss, we have the
hard disk along with the proofs.

1803
02:11:16,705 --> 02:11:18,920
Call me back after
checking all the details.

1804
02:11:19,061 --> 02:11:20,275
Seena, take this.

1805
02:11:20,411 --> 02:11:22,492
- Connect the hard disk.
- Okay.

1806
02:11:23,983 --> 02:11:27,810
"Seven wonders of this world."

1807
02:11:30,823 --> 02:11:34,487
"And the eight is
you and me, buddy."

1808
02:11:37,311 --> 02:11:40,778
"Seven wonders of this world."

1809
02:11:40,858 --> 02:11:43,753
- "And the eight is you and me, buddy."
- What an acting, what singing..

1810
02:11:43,894 --> 02:11:47,836
..what dancing! Acting
runs in his blood.

1811
02:11:48,167 --> 02:11:50,007
Do you like the song, guys?

1812
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:51,655
Change the folder.

1813
02:11:54,082 --> 02:11:55,752
"Abracadabra."

1814
02:11:55,832 --> 02:11:58,973
"Why do the moon and the stars
disappear when the sun comes up."

1815
02:11:59,053 --> 02:12:00,851
"When the sun comes up."

1816
02:12:00,931 --> 02:12:04,389
"When the night falls
we can see them again."

1817
02:12:04,469 --> 02:12:08,199
"When the sun comes up,
we cannot see them."

1818
02:12:16,216 --> 02:12:18,385
He's been playing double
roll since he was a kid.

1819
02:12:18,616 --> 02:12:21,650
You guys didn't even know
how to wear your underwear.

1820
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,325
You're amazing.

1821
02:12:24,263 --> 02:12:27,217
You should watch his childhood film.
You will be amazed.

1822
02:12:27,297 --> 02:12:28,866
Turn that off.

1823
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:31,555
Thank you very much.

1824
02:12:32,263 --> 02:12:33,259
Thanks. Thanks.

1825
02:12:34,344 --> 02:12:35,799
Excuse me, just a minute.

1826
02:12:36,949 --> 02:12:39,243
- Hello.
- Boss, there's nothing on the hard disk.

1827
02:12:39,371 --> 02:12:42,493
What are you saying?
Send that folder.

1828
02:12:43,369 --> 02:12:44,837
Hurry up! Sorry..

1829
02:12:44,917 --> 02:12:49,022
Sorry, we were
discussing that topic..

1830
02:12:49,645 --> 02:12:52,822
- Will you please give that file to him.
- Okay.

1831
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:59,702
"Classical rap..Indian steps."

1832
02:13:05,135 --> 02:13:07,031
Mr. Jagannath, how are you?

1833
02:13:07,111 --> 02:13:08,432
- I am fine. I am fine.
- Okay.

1834
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:11,925
Hands up!

1835
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:18,568
Hey..he tricked us.

1836
02:13:18,648 --> 02:13:21,052
I'll be swearing in
tomorrow evening.

1837
02:13:21,132 --> 02:13:23,060
He can do anything
with this evidence.

1838
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:26,701
You must get that hard disk
before I reach Bengaluru.

1839
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:28,800
Attack the old age home.

1840
02:13:28,807 --> 02:13:31,189
Even if my father's
there, don't stop.

1841
02:13:31,269 --> 02:13:33,755
I want that hard
disk at any cost.

1842
02:13:44,204 --> 02:13:46,627
I came to the old age
home to steal this.

1843
02:13:47,936 --> 02:13:50,528
There was a small hole in
my grand daughter's heart.

1844
02:13:50,776 --> 02:13:52,429
I needed one million
for the operation.

1845
02:13:52,964 --> 02:13:55,616
They said they will pay
me if I do this job.

1846
02:13:56,127 --> 02:13:59,484
My daughter called when I was
going to steal the hard disk.

1847
02:13:59,841 --> 02:14:02,504
And she said the operation
was successful.

1848
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:05,682
The doctor said she's
perfectly alright.

1849
02:14:05,713 --> 02:14:08,904
Your trust gave me the
money for the operation.

1850
02:14:08,984 --> 02:14:11,029
That's when I knew that even
Lord won't forgive me..

1851
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:12,639
..if I betray people like you.

1852
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:15,355
Please forgive me, sir.

1853
02:14:21,969 --> 02:14:23,218
Appu..

1854
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:28,197
- Where is the hard disk? Tell me.
- I don't know.

1855
02:14:28,297 --> 02:14:30,745
Where did you hide it? Tell me.

1856
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:33,370
I don't know.

1857
02:14:42,463 --> 02:14:44,078
Hey, if you don't hand
over the hard disk..

1858
02:14:44,497 --> 02:14:48,201
..I will kill these people
in front of your eyes.

1859
02:16:04,603 --> 02:16:06,748
Leave me. Leave me. Leave me.

1860
02:16:06,828 --> 02:16:08,076
Leave me.

1861
02:16:10,177 --> 02:16:11,317
Leave me.

1862
02:16:11,908 --> 02:16:13,116
Where are you taking me?

1863
02:16:31,533 --> 02:16:33,408
Appu!

1864
02:16:58,804 --> 02:17:01,333
- Who staged this attack?
- Do you know who is behind this?

1865
02:17:01,334 --> 02:17:02,617
Is this some personal enmity?

1866
02:17:02,676 --> 02:17:03,314
Answer us.

1867
02:17:03,722 --> 02:17:05,516
- Listen.
- You're in charge of this old age home.

1868
02:17:05,528 --> 02:17:06,904
Is this how you run
your old age home.

1869
02:17:06,984 --> 02:17:09,219
People bring their parents here
thinking they will be safe.

1870
02:17:09,299 --> 02:17:09,973
But they are not safe.

1871
02:17:09,975 --> 02:17:12,557
If anything had happened to our
parents, who would've been responsible?

1872
02:17:12,615 --> 02:17:14,484
You guys!

1873
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:18,878
You guys left your parents
at the old age home.

1874
02:17:19,211 --> 02:17:21,004
You're responsible for it.

1875
02:17:21,024 --> 02:17:23,775
Did you ever visit them
when they were fine?

1876
02:17:23,777 --> 02:17:24,809
That's our problem.

1877
02:17:25,305 --> 02:17:28,314
We never care for them
when they are okay.

1878
02:17:28,336 --> 02:17:30,391
If anything happens to them..

1879
02:17:30,421 --> 02:17:33,057
..then our mind starts working and
suddenly our love for them awakens.

1880
02:17:33,138 --> 02:17:35,877
Why don't you have the same
feeling when they live with you?

1881
02:17:36,451 --> 02:17:38,837
We don't know their values
when they are alive.

1882
02:17:39,209 --> 02:17:41,117
But we miss them
after they are dead.

1883
02:17:41,197 --> 02:17:43,367
The place where he
used to take a stroll.

1884
02:17:43,377 --> 02:17:45,735
We regret thinking about them.

1885
02:17:45,736 --> 02:17:49,025
We never ask about their
wishes when they are alive.

1886
02:17:49,142 --> 02:17:53,413
But later we cook their favorite
dishes and feed 100 people.

1887
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:57,288
The love we give them when they
are alive, that's real love.

1888
02:17:57,343 --> 02:17:59,490
When parents send their children
to the hostel to study..

1889
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:01,400
..they also bring
them back home.

1890
02:18:01,466 --> 02:18:04,572
But when parents grow
old, we cannot adjust.

1891
02:18:04,575 --> 02:18:06,424
We get irritated,
fight with them.

1892
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:07,505
Send them to old age home.

1893
02:18:07,536 --> 02:18:09,927
But, we never bring them back.

1894
02:18:10,633 --> 02:18:13,494
Old people are just
like children.

1895
02:18:13,922 --> 02:18:18,048
You're lecturing us, but do you
take care of your parents?

1896
02:18:18,139 --> 02:18:19,911
I am not destined for that.

1897
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:22,038
I'm an orphan.

1898
02:18:46,925 --> 02:18:49,431
How dare you come here!

1899
02:18:51,426 --> 02:18:53,496
A man who goes against anyone..

1900
02:18:56,203 --> 02:18:58,273
..can never be touched
by the likes of you.

1901
02:18:58,588 --> 02:19:00,440
Killing me is just a dream.

1902
02:19:02,379 --> 02:19:04,987
You're not worried about your
father who's in the ICU..

1903
02:19:05,419 --> 02:19:06,934
..then, why will you worry
about those innocent children?

1904
02:19:07,204 --> 02:19:10,465
Nor the old men in
the old age home!

1905
02:19:10,516 --> 02:19:12,524
You want this
evidence, don't you?

1906
02:19:13,641 --> 02:19:16,961
I just wanted to prove
my dad innocent.

1907
02:19:17,029 --> 02:19:20,971
But, it's my duty to protect those
old people in the old age home.

1908
02:19:21,036 --> 02:19:23,526
And listen, this battle
is between you and me.

1909
02:19:23,606 --> 02:19:25,714
You won't harm anyone else.

1910
02:19:25,804 --> 02:19:28,877
Either there's you..or me.

1911
02:19:33,218 --> 02:19:37,489
If anyone dies, then no
matter how hard to try..

1912
02:19:37,919 --> 02:19:40,328
..but I won't spare you.

1913
02:19:44,462 --> 02:19:46,671
Stop staring at him. Connect it.

1914
02:19:46,751 --> 02:19:48,065
Okay, sir.

1915
02:19:58,101 --> 02:20:00,398
I, Jagannath promise..

1916
02:20:00,662 --> 02:20:02,626
I, Jagannath promise..

1917
02:20:02,744 --> 02:20:06,184
According to the law made by
the constitution of India..

1918
02:20:06,264 --> 02:20:09,688
According to the law made by
the constitution of India..

1919
02:20:09,768 --> 02:20:11,648
I shall honestly
and faithfully..

1920
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:14,081
I shall honestly
and faithfully..

1921
02:20:14,946 --> 02:20:17,316
I will serve my country..

1922
02:20:18,638 --> 02:20:22,095
I will serve my country..

1923
02:20:22,175 --> 02:20:24,066
While carrying out my duties..

1924
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:27,212
While carrying out my duties..

1925
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:30,571
As the Health Minister
of Karnataka..

1926
02:20:43,324 --> 02:20:45,394
Sir, that's the family folder.

1927
02:21:00,349 --> 02:21:01,628
Jagannath!

1928
02:21:06,766 --> 02:21:08,614
Listen..

1929
02:21:11,898 --> 02:21:13,847
Start the car immediately.

1930
02:21:13,927 --> 02:21:14,796
Let's go.

1931
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,140
No one should have
any kind of problem.

1932
02:21:36,368 --> 02:21:37,833
Tell me whatever you need.

1933
02:21:37,913 --> 02:21:39,727
- I'll handle everything. Okay.
- Dr..

1934
02:21:39,782 --> 02:21:41,995
Please, expenses don't matter.
Just save my father.

1935
02:21:42,908 --> 02:21:45,270
Singapore, Malaysia, doesn't
matter where you have to take him.

1936
02:21:45,350 --> 02:21:47,614
Just save my father,
please doctor.

1937
02:21:47,694 --> 02:21:49,999
If money and medicines
can cure everything..

1938
02:21:50,238 --> 02:21:52,634
..then everyone coming to the
hospital would go back alive.

1939
02:21:52,750 --> 02:21:54,397
Today you want to
save your father..

1940
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:56,181
..then just show him your love.

1941
02:21:56,259 --> 02:21:57,917
Go save him if you can.

1942
02:22:08,822 --> 02:22:09,507
Papa..

1943
02:22:11,858 --> 02:22:12,582
Papa..

1944
02:22:14,742 --> 02:22:16,951
I want to talk to you.

1945
02:22:19,699 --> 02:22:23,261
All your life to told me
to take the right path.

1946
02:22:23,262 --> 02:22:25,540
But, I never listened.

1947
02:22:25,615 --> 02:22:27,588
And now, I am regretting it.

1948
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,433
You taught me how
to ride a bike..

1949
02:22:37,456 --> 02:22:40,704
..and I remembered that
but, I forgot the cycle.

1950
02:22:40,841 --> 02:22:42,965
I learned how to earn..

1951
02:22:43,149 --> 02:22:46,148
..but forgot what you taught me.

1952
02:22:47,646 --> 02:22:50,734
In my greed to acquire power..

1953
02:22:50,858 --> 02:22:52,924
..I forgot myself.

1954
02:22:57,048 --> 02:22:57,690
Papa..

1955
02:22:59,707 --> 02:23:03,196
..you never told me to get rich.

1956
02:23:03,246 --> 02:23:07,283
Not to become a doctor
or an engineer.

1957
02:23:08,068 --> 02:23:11,040
You just told me to
be an honest man..

1958
02:23:11,123 --> 02:23:13,367
..but, I even failed
to be a good son.

1959
02:23:13,448 --> 02:23:16,762
Papa, you've always
forgiven my mistake.

1960
02:23:18,041 --> 02:23:21,144
Please forgive me one
last time, papa.

1961
02:23:21,894 --> 02:23:25,077
Just give me one more chance.

1962
02:23:25,368 --> 02:23:28,432
Now, I will do as you say.

1963
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:30,966
I'll become a good man.

1964
02:23:31,046 --> 02:23:32,324
Please, papa.

1965
02:23:33,478 --> 02:23:35,358
Please, papa.

1966
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:48,309
Papa..

1967
02:23:50,422 --> 02:23:54,450
..won't you give me one
chance to reform myself.

1968
02:24:04,151 --> 02:24:06,152
My father was leading
a good life..

1969
02:24:06,668 --> 02:24:09,045
..but, I pushed him
towards his death.

1970
02:24:09,086 --> 02:24:14,711
And, you kept your father
alive in your heart and mind.

1971
02:24:14,733 --> 02:24:18,103
One doesn't need an minister
Or MP to reform this society.

1972
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:22,608
A son like you in every
family is enough.

1973
02:24:22,671 --> 02:24:26,090
A person is blessed
with talents only once.

1974
02:24:26,143 --> 02:24:30,163
But, it stays till the end.

1975
02:24:30,454 --> 02:24:32,266
Thank you.

1976
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:45,936
Careful, papa.

1977
02:24:48,235 --> 02:24:49,724
- Sorry, sir.
- It's okay.

1978
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,077
Sorry, sir.

1979
02:25:06,310 --> 02:25:07,372
I am very sorry, sir.

1980
02:25:07,787 --> 02:25:10,889
- I'll take good care of my father.
- It's alright.

1981
02:25:13,475 --> 02:25:16,781
- Take good care of him.
- Here's the spray.

1982
02:25:18,717 --> 02:25:21,542
- See you, son.
- Bye. Bye.

1983
02:26:10,566 --> 02:26:13,566
KASTURI NIWASA (Kasturi
Orphan's Home)

1984
02:26:19,477 --> 02:26:22,636
Finally, the polio
scam comes to an end.

1985
02:26:22,668 --> 02:26:27,005
NRI Ashok and ex-Health Minister were
found innocent. It's been proven.

1986
02:26:27,772 --> 02:26:31,823
The present Health Minister Jagannath
has admitted to his crimes.

1987
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:35,992
And, he has taken the entire
responsibility of this scam.

1988
02:26:37,152 --> 02:26:38,416
I am proud of you.

1989
02:26:39,725 --> 02:26:43,152
A real son is someone who
makes his father proud.

1990
02:26:43,232 --> 02:26:45,878
You won everyone's heart
with your smile, boss.

1991
02:26:45,922 --> 02:26:48,591
Those who were sad,
you gave them love.

1992
02:26:48,609 --> 02:26:51,331
You truly are a prince.

1993
02:26:51,956 --> 02:26:55,289
I wish your father was alive
he would've been really happy.

1994
02:26:55,369 --> 02:26:57,237
I never really felt that
my father is not alive.

1995
02:26:57,885 --> 02:26:59,308
I do everything from my heart.

1996
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,196
I treat everyone as my kin.

1997
02:27:01,276 --> 02:27:02,741
And people love me too.

1998
02:27:02,777 --> 02:27:06,777
That's why they are my family.

1999
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:21,239
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince

2000
02:27:26,763 --> 02:27:34,763
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince

2001
02:27:40,727 --> 02:27:50,727
Luck comes only once,but
Character remains forever.

2002
02:27:50,751 --> 02:28:00,751
We have only one sun and moon.
Likewise, we have only one King.

2003
02:28:00,775 --> 02:28:11,775
Play with it or topple it,It
never gives up and bows down.

2004
02:28:16,799 --> 02:28:24,799
The doll says, the doll says
it again that you are prince

2005
02:28:27,823 --> 02:28:31,823
Greatness lies in Simplicity.
