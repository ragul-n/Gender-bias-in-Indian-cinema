1
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,688
Stories...stories...stories...

2
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,480
Not in hundreds or thousands....

3
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,105
But in millions.

4
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:38,855
Anyone who walks this earth is a story.

5
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:40,438
I have a story too.

6
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,480
I wanted to be a writer.

7
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,980
But I’d never imagined
that my life itself would become a story.

8
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:14,605
♫Why am I this way? ♫

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,896
♫I had many plans for us. ♫

10
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:33,563

Are you done with your work?

21
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,271
What do you expect, Gautham?

22
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,646
It’s 9 o’ clock in the night.

23
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,563
Give me two minutes.
I will shower and come back

24
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,855
Gautham.

25
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,396
Let’s eat.

26
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,980
Two minutes.

27
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:38,438
♫I am drifting apart from you. ♫

28
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,855
♫ Every moment I feel sad. ♫

29
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:46,896

35
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:35,730
Didn’t you go to work?

36
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:42,230
What happened?

37
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,105
Do you have a fever?

38
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,188
No coffee today?

39
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:20,730
Yamini...

40
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,355
Are you among those days?

41
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,396
Gautham?

42
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:41,896
Gautham?

43
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,771
I need to talk to you.

44
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,438
What?
-I need to talk to you.

45
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,480
Tell me, Yamini.

46
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,021
Do you notice any change in me?

47
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,938
Did you change your hairstyle?

48
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,355
No.

49
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:03,980
New dress?

50
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,730
New shoes?

51
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,021
I’ve put on weight, Gautham.

52
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,521
I am getting fat.

53
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,021
You’ve stopped noticing me, right?

54
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,938
I am sick and tired of those contraceptive pills!
They're bloating me.

55
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,396
Gautham, do you remember
what happened one year ago?

56
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:38,896
Hey.

57
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:40,438
Hi.

58
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,688
I submitted my papers today.

59
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:54,688
What?

60
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:00,980
Tell me.

61
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,355
I mean...

62
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,063
I quit my job.

63
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,105
With so many responsibilities... how...

64
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:12,563
Yamini, you know me.

65
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,105
Ever since I was in college,
I wanted to be a writer.

66
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,105
And you told me to take up the job.

67
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:20,938
I took it up for you.

68
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,271
If I don’t do this for myself now,

69
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,146
I will never be able to pursue this ever in my life.

70
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,355
But, why writing Gautham?

71
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,355
With such growth in technology,
who would be interested in reading books?

72
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,230
You said technology, right?

73
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:37,938
If a rocket has to go to space...

74
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,021
Look at that laptop...

75
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,938
For that keypad or laptop to work...

76
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:47,355
or for us to watch a movie and enjoy ourselves,

77
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:51,271
someone must put pen to paper, Yamini.

78
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,271
Without Pen and Paper,

79
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:00,521
the world is as good as dead.

80
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,688
You doubt if people really do read books, isn’t it?

81
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:06,480
They will certainly read.

82
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,646
If you write something interesting and exciting.

83
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,771
Anyone will read it.
And I will write it.

84
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,271
Give me an year.

85
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,855
Will you support me?

86
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:19,771
Please?

87
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:26,730
That day, I was really proud of you Gautham.

88
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,855
I was proud to be in love with a man like you.

89
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,730
I was so proud falling in love with you.

90
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,896
So proud sharing my life and bed with you.

91
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,480
But what do you do on a normal day, Gautham?

92
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,855
You wake up really late.

93
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:47,480
And if there is tea or coffee around, you have it.

94
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,521
Or else you let it be.

95
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,813
If the food is ready, you have it
Or else you starve yourself.

96
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,063
You watch Cartoon Network like a small kid.

97
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,855
You read books.
You wait for me to come home.

98
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:59,271
Have your dinner
and pull me onto this bed man!

99
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:03,021
This has been going on since a year and a half.

100
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,230
If by chance you wake up early,

101
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,896
You accompany me to a stationary shop.

102
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:14,396
You buy yourself pens, papers, colour pencils and all.

103
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,105
And you put it in this cupboard, man.

104
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:19,146
This fu**ing shit looks like a stationary shop in itself.

105
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:24,771
Did you ever feel like opening the bundle,

106
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:28,063
fixing that paper onto a writing pad and just writing?

107
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,396
You’ve insulted me

108
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,646
and my unconditional love for you, Gautham.

109
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,105
You've taken me for granted, right?

110
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:50,271
If you don’t care of things
they fall into disrepair, Gautham.

111
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,480
I am a human.

112
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,271
Apart from having a life,
I have a heart too.

113
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,521
And you took it for a ride.

114
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:00,271
You completely shattered it.

115
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,313
You’ve completely killed me

116
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,688
and my soul.

117
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,563
I can’t take this pain anymore, Gautham.

118
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,855
Love is a compromise, Gautham.

119
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,688
It is a sacrifice.

120
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:21,021
There is divinity in love.

121
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,646
But you don’t understand any of these.

122
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:32,771
I am tired, Gautham.
I am tired.

123
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,105
My mind, my heart...
It's just bleeding.

124
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,730
Let’s break up, Gautham.

125
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:49,105
You know Gautham....
This is not easy.

126
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:55,688
How many times did I sit on this chair
and wonder how to break this to you!

127
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,105
Let’s break up, Gautham.

128
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:09,980
Take care of yourself.

129
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,021
Write well.

130
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:20,355
Yamini...

131
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:22,813
What do you want me to make for dinner?

132
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:25,938
Do you want some Chinese?

133
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:34,355
I said fu**ing breakup! Breakup means breakup!
You don’t understand?

134
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,980
Eat whatever you want.

135
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:47,021
What do you mean by fu**ing breakup?

136
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,355
Yamini!

137
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,771
What do you mean by fu**ing breakup?

138
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,396
Stop shouting.
Everyone is watching us.

139
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:55,313
Let them watch!

140
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,938
Didn’t they watch us when we were hugging
and kissing each other in love?

141
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:01,480
What do you mean by fu**ing breakup?

142
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,230
Breakup means breakup!
Period.

143
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,396
What happened to you all of a sudden?

144
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:10,813
Remember you kept telling me.

145
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,771
Gautham, I love your eyes.

146
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:16,480
You have lovely lips.
I love your nose.

147
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:20,271
Soft skin...
I love how you smell...

148
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,271
What happened now?
Did my eyes, nose and skin change?

149
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,230
None of those things changed
But you are not the same Gautham I knew.

150
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,521
What nonsense?!

151
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:35,105
What do you mean?
What is the difference?

152
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:36,896
The Gautham I knew loved me.

153
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:37,938
What about this Gautham now?

154
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,688
What did this Gautham do to you?

155
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,563
This Gautham just spreads my legs.

156
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,063
Buddy, I read your Facebook post.
It’s quite long.

157
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,063
It must be a short story.

158
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:58,021
Who did you write it for?

159
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:58,646
Excuse me...

160
00:15:59,105 --> 00:15:59,730
One second.

161
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,355
Brother, could you help me with an address?

162
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,938
Brother? Who is the brother here?
Whose brother am I?

163
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,063
I am Gautham.

164
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,938
Hi, Gautham.
-Hi.

165
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,813
Can you help with the address
of this auditorium?

166
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,271
This is close to my place.

167
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,605
What happened to the GPS?

168
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,855
It cheated me.
I’ve been moving about in circles.

169
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,646
Do you know the directions?

170
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,396
Aren’t you the one who danced
in ‘Dhee’ dance program?

171
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:31,605
What?
No!

172
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:33,730
Crazy...

173
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:37,980
Can I hop in?

174
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:39,230
Why?

175
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:45,188
Well, if the GPS kept cheating you,
that means the address is a bit tricky.

176
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,063
I will show you.

177
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:48,480
Okay.

178
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:52,549
Nice car.

179
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,341
Your dress is good too.

180
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:58,383
Thank you.

181
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,424
I was born and brought up in Hyderabad

182
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,674
but, thus far no girl pierced my heart.

183
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:07,841
What does piercing your heart mean?

184
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,008
This is the address. Straight.
It’s on the right.

185
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,424
Gautham?
Park the car.

186
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:19,549
Me?

187
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:20,883
Yeah, park it.

188
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,091
I have a performance.

189
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,508
Hey, listen.

190
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:24,883
Make it quick.

191
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:25,883
You don't want to miss it.

192
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,341
Hey, Yamini. Make it quick.
Come fast.

193
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:27,966
Yamini!

194
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,716
Hey! Who are you?
Are you her brother?

195
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:35,299
No. No. I am not.

196
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,633
Even she asked me the same question.

197
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:40,091
But I made it clear to her.
I am not ‘Brother’. I am Gautham.

198
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:42,591
Friend?

199
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,216
No, bro.
I don’t really know if we can call it that yet.

200
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:49,591
Boyfriend?

201
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,258
Boyfriend?

202
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,633
How dare you make friends with girls from our college?!
You bloody...

203
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,341
It looks like the program started.

204
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,966
She very sweetly asked me not to miss it, bro.

205
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,424
I will go.

206
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,341
Hey! Where do you think you are going?

207
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,633
What exactly happened?
Tell me.

208
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,174
He gave up his job, Dad.

209
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,049
He wanted to become a writer.

210
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,216
He said he needed help.
I helped him.

211
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,883
He doesn’t write anything, Dad.

212
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,299
Even if I am ok with all this...

213
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,008
he lives in a completely different world.

214
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,008
And I am not a part of that world, Dad.

215
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,049
You kept accusing me that I didn’t write.
I wrote!

216
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,716
You kept pushing me to write, write and write.
Do you think it’s easy to write?

217
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,508
Not just one or two.

218
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:29,633
I wrote ten books.

219
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,924
When I read what I write,
I feel disgusted.

220
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,883
Writing doesn’t mean turning a white paper to black.

221
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,174
It’s like sharing a soul.

222
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:41,341
The soul is missing in these.

223
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,424
You abandoned me because I didn’t write?

224
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:48,008
I will write.

225
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,549
I will fu**ing write...

226
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,008
...for you!

227
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,216
Hey.
You?

228
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:47,591
Why did you hit them yesterday?

229
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:48,799
Didn’t they tell you?

230
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,133
No, they didn’t.

231
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,591
Then it’s not important.

232
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,591
Alright.
Where is room no. 5?

233
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:57,549
I don’t know.

234
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:03,008
Hey, classical dancer...

235
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:03,841
What?

236
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:05,883
Where are the flowers?

237
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,258
What do you mean?

238
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,591
You would look great with flowers in this chiken dress.

239
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,424
Do you think I am here to take
an exam or accept a marriage proposal?

240
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,424
Flowers it seems!

241
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:29,466
What?

242
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,174
Won’t you write?

243
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:32,883
I am done.

244
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,549
I was watching you because
I didn’t want to waste time

245
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,216
What’s your name?

246
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:42,716
Silence!

247
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:47,133
Sorry.
It just slipped out of my mouth.

248
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:50,258
What is your name?

249
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,883
Yamini.

250
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:55,883
Yamini...

251
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,549
Were you born beautiful...

252
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,049
Or you grew up to be beautiful?

253
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,841
[11 miners dead in coal mine mishap]

254
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,216
[11 miners dead in coal mine mishap]

255
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:44,424
Look...

256
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,216
Look how she is crying

257
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:48,216
She must be of our age.

258
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:50,508
Her husband died in a coal mining accident.

259
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,799
And she is not able to let him go.
She is begging him to come back to her.

260
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,383
I am still alive, right?

261
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:57,299
How could you leave me and go?

262
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,508
This isn’t love, Yamini.

263
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,424
Is she educated like you are?

264
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:04,466
No.

265
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:06,549
But she knows the value of a person.

266
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:11,508
Look at how it feels
when your loved ones leave you.

267
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,966
I met you because I was born
and raised here in Hyderabad.

268
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,174
You came into my life.

269
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,383
You became a part of my story.

270
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:23,966
If I was born in Yellandu,

271
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:25,924
do you think I would have met you? No!

272
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,133
I would have met some girl like her,
and gotten married to her.

273
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,424
I would have someone who would
be willing to die for me.

274
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,133
I wish I wasn’t born in Hyderabad.

275
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,591
I wish I never met you.

276
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,716
If I was born in Yellandu...

277
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,008
You... Idiot.

278
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,508
Why did you sleep here of all places?

279
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:10,299
Tea.

280
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,049
You are here in Yellandu as well?

281
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,258
You will leave him too.

282
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:36,508
You said you wanted to leave me, right?
Leave me then.

283
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,174
Leave my writing alone as well.

284
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:44,008
Suvarna.

285
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:47,799
Tea.

286
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:55,049
Here is your Tea.

287
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,966
It’s been seven years since we got married.

288
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,883
We have a five-year-old son as well.

289
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,508
What are you so scared of?

290
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,591
Do I hit you , scold you or eat you up?

291
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:06,758
You burned my hand early in the morning.

292
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,258
What’s up, man?
Where are you headed so early in the morning?

293
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:19,674
There is a car with a beacon light in front of the house.

294
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,591
I became a civil servant.
I am going to the administrative office to work.

295
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,716
I’ve got 503 marks in my tenth grade.

296
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:29,424
No officer's son in the collieries has this kind of a score.

297
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:32,674
Thanks to your drinking habit you lost your arm.
Because you wanted a miner’s son to become a miner,

298
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:33,758
You smeared coal all over my face.

299
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:35,674
And now you nonchalantly ask me where I am off to?!

300
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,049
Where would a laborers’ son go?
Of course, to labour.

301
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,258
Didn’t you think it would be wise to wait a bit
after a 20-year old took up a job?

302
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:44,383
You got me married to that dimwit!

303
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,133
Before I could even make sense of what happened,
I had a 5-year-old son!

304
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,674
And then, this constant nagging everyday!

305
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:50,341
Where am I off to, you ask?!
Where am I off to?!

306
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,008
Shamelessly, you ask!

307
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,383
Next time if you ask me,
I will break your other arm.

308
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:54,508
You are going to break my arm?

309
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,133
Break it then!
Break my hand then!

310
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,258
Hey, shut it and sit down.
Sit down and read your papers.

311
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:03,174
Greetings...

312
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,966
Greetings.

313
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,966
How come you guys gathered
In front of my house?

314
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:10,466
You don’t need to be reminded, brother.
Today is the counting day.

315
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:13,091
Everyone is of the opinion that
you are going to win.

316
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,549
I got everyone along for our victory lap.

317
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:16,174
Is it?

318
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:19,008
But I’ll just go and drop my son off at school.

319
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:19,508
Go on.

320
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:20,216
Alright!

321
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,091
Let’s go fellows.
-Kiddo, get on the bike.

322
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:23,633
Carefully.
-Brother?

323
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,841
The counting is going on. Come soon.
-Alright, fine. I’ll come around.

324
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:30,049
Hey, take off your hand.

325
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:35,966
Srinu...

326
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:37,799
all the best.

327
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,174
Yadhi, come here.

328
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,424
Brother?

329
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,883
Call that cable guy
and get the cable disconnected.

330
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,674
Why, brother?
Isn’t the cable working?

331
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,008
The cable is doing too damn fine a job of
teaching English to the ladies of the house.

332
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:49,758
Call him and get it disconnected.

333
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:50,716
Alright, brother.

334
00:28:54,966 --> 00:29:00,508
The results for the elections of the Union of Black Diamonds
Coal Mine are going to be announced in some time.

335
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,299
We request the candidates to cooperate
with the officials.

336
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:07,258
These sunglasses are so cool, Yadhi.

337
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:09,591
That’s true, brother.

338
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,799
Srinu, you cocky brat!

339
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,966
The counting isn’t done yet.

340
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,299
and you are already here at the Union office!

341
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,466
Right here at the doorstep too.

342
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,133
And with sunglasses too.

343
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:25,508
Did you dream of winning?

344
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,924
Listen here, Mr. Patnaik.
I want to tell you something.

345
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,091
You have been the union leader for the past 10 years.

346
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,966
That has always been unanimous.

347
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,883
And no one here dares to contest against you.

348
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:43,799
And after ten years, If a novice like me comes along,
rebels and files his nomination papers in the elections,

349
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:45,216
it means you’ve lost.

350
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:50,091
The counting is just a formality.

351
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:52,341
In the seventh incline, Srinu has a 23-vote majority.

352
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:58,174
Stop it!

353
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,424
Don’t go celebrating your success yet.

354
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,674
Bro, Is the entire election over
with just a seven incline?

355
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:09,049
With just a 23-vote majority,
you seem to be so getting giddy over this victory?

356
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,299
There is a lot long battle ahead.

357
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:15,799
There is the 10 incline, 11 incline and the 23 incline.

358
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:17,799
What else?
-NGO, open cast.

359
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,883
NGO, open cast and many more, bro.

360
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,508
In the Black Diamond coal mines elections,

361
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:26,174
a young mine leader Srinu,

362
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,674
has won the election with a resounding majority.

363
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:40,966
Srinu brother!

364
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,299
Srinu brother!

365
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:43,758
Srinu brother!

366
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,091
Suvarna?

367
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:52,716
Is your mom around?

368
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:55,008
Why would my mom be here?
She must be in the village.

369
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:57,133
What about your father then?

370
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,924
My father is with my mother in the village.

371
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:01,716
Then who is going to scrub my back?

372
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,549
I am coming. Coming.

373
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:27,466
Manager sir.

374
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:30,383
How many times do I have to ask you
not to flash your light like that?

375
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,258
Am I a buffalo or a goat?

376
00:31:32,508 --> 00:31:34,716
You must be taking me for granted
just because I give your respect.

377
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:38,258
I wasn’t sure if you could hear me
amidst all this noise.

378
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:41,174
If I can’t hear you,
Climb the machine and call me loudly.

379
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,008
If I reprimand,
I am accused of being the crazy one.

380
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:46,174
Set that aside. I have some work with you.
Come down.

381
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:48,549
Tell me... what's it?

382
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:51,424
Smitha Ma’am joined as our Junior Welfare officer.

383
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:54,633
You guys would be seeing a lot of each other at work.
So, I thought it is best to introduce you to each other.

384
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,633
Madam is from Mumbai, Srinu.

385
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,216
Smitha Madam, this is Srinu.

386
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,049
Hi, Srinu.

387
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:08,758
Srinu?

388
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:09,799
Sir...

389
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:11,216
Srinu?

390
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,174
Sir...

391
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,133
Srinu?

392
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:16,383
Smitha Madam.

393
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:17,966
Smitha Madam.

394
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:21,841
Madam, I am Srinu.
I am the union leader here.

395
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,258
Hi Srinu.
I am Smitha.

396
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,174
My hands are smeared with coal dust.

397
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:29,758
What do you expect while working in a coal mine,
Gold dust?

398
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:32,216
It’s ok, Srinu.
Shake hands.

399
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,091
Nice to meet you.

400
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:40,966
Brother, did you notice?

401
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:44,633
When you were the Union leader,
there was an old hag who was the Welfare officer.

402
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:49,299
As soon as he became the union leader, some young lady comes down
and he gets to squeeze her hand.

403
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,924
This handshake of theirs!
Did you ever shake hands in this manner, ever?

404
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:53,508
Saidulu?
-Yes, brother.

405
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:54,799
You have no brains at all.

406
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,216
If they are appointed,
they will stick around until their retirement.

407
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,758
If we are lucky
and if there is a by election next year,

408
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,799
won’t we win?

409
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,674
Are you saying that
you would offer your hand and squeeze hers?

410
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:07,424
Is that what I said?!

411
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:09,716
Go about business!
Idiot!

412
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:31,213
Why are you touching me?
Turn that way and sleep!

413
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:47,879
You... woman!
Why are you throwing yourself at me?

414
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,213
I am already suffocating because of the heat.

415
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,129
One kick and you'll fall through the window.

416
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,879
Why are you so angry today?

417
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:54,004
So, what ?

418
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:55,379
When you come to me...
I will show you.

419
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,129
Why would I come to you?
-For that.

420
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:58,879
I won’t come or go.

421
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,713
Idiot!
I will gouge you!

422
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:03,004
Shut up and sleep.
-Yeah, right!

423
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:03,504
Go.

424
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:07,796
What do expect while working in a coal mine?
Gold dust?

425
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,046
Everything is clear, sir.

426
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,879
It’s clear.

427
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:27,921
The blasts have begun, sir.

428
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:32,546
It would take at least another hour for it to be loaded.
-Mr. Srinu.

429
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,254
Mr. Srinu.

430
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:37,671
Call him... call srinu.

431
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:38,796
Madam is here.

432
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:39,588
Madam is here.

433
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:40,713
What is it?
-Madam is here.

434
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,088
Hi.

435
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:43,171
Greetings, Madam.

436
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:44,838
Good morning.
-What brings you here?

437
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:46,004
Nothing in particular, Srinu.

438
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:49,213
The Manager here said that
you are the person to help me take a look at all the mines.

439
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,796
So, I came here.

440
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:51,713
Ok.

441
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:53,504
Yadhi!
-Yeah, Bro...

442
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:54,629
I got some really important work.

443
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,629
Madam wants me to show her the mines.
I am going.

444
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,546
Alright, fine. I will take care of it.
Go on ahead.

445
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:00,004
Hey!
-I will take care of it, brother.

446
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:01,379
I will... you go.
-Come.

447
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,254
No. No, Srinu.
Sit here.

448
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:10,129
♫Hey sir, you are on a roll. ♫

482
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,129
I’ve been working here for close to thirty years.

483
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,296
Even you didn’t ask me to stop drinking.

484
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:09,004
And yet, this pup who is still wet behind his ears
dares to give me an ultimatum?

485
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:09,879
Srinu!

486
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:11,338
Get down.

487
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,046
What is this nuisance so early in the day?

488
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,713
You asked grandpa Rattaya to quit drinking?

489
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,004
He will drink.

490
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:24,671
He will continue to drink to his fullest and come to work.

491
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:25,713
What can you do?

492
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:27,171
What can you do?

493
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,671
After you became the union leader,
You’ve grown horns.

494
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:33,421
Mr. Patnaik.
You guys discussed something beforehand.

495
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,713
You came here and grabbed my collar.

496
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:38,379
Since you're here now,
why don’t you turn around and take a look?

497
00:38:41,004 --> 00:38:43,129
Do you want each of them to give you a beating?

498
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:45,296
Won't a warning suffice?

499
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:47,546
What do you say guys?

500
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,004
Hey, calm down, brother.

501
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:54,713
You take the joke too far.

502
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:56,963
There is still dirt on your collar.

503
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:58,254
Didn’t you have a proper bath?

504
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,921
Couldn’t you have someone clean you with soapnuts?
Didn’t sister help?

505
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:02,754
Do you know how a leader should look?

506
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:03,921
He should look sharp.

507
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:05,088
Old man!

508
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,046
If you drink and come here again,
I will smash you.

509
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:09,796
That is my warning to each one of you.

510
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:11,838
If anyone drinks and comes...

511
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:15,171
there is no way you are getting down into the pit
and touching the coal. Do you understand?

512
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:16,629
Go on. Go.
Go about your business.

513
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:19,088
I shall take your leave, Srinu.

514
00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:20,254
Hey you!
Come along.

515
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:23,671
Brother Patnaik.

516
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:26,504
Who is going to greet me?

517
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:29,296
Greetings, Srinu.

518
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:32,129
Brother Srinu, I shall take your leave

519
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,004
Pedda Babu, come here.

520
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:35,588
I wish to speak something with you.

521
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,754
You guys go on ahead.
Go about your business.

522
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,546
What is it?
-You have two sons, right?

523
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,546
So what?
-What is the youngest one’s name?

524
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,754
Karthik.
-I see him hanging about the house.

525
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:45,379
Isn’t he studying Bi.P.C?

526
00:39:46,463 --> 00:39:47,338
So, what if he is?

527
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:49,254
He is capable of getting a medical seat.

528
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:52,713
You know, in my 10th grade,
I scored 503 marks.

529
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:56,338
My father kept drinking, lost his arm
and turned me into a labourer.

530
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:58,629
Are you going to turn your children into labourers too?

531
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:01,129
Why would you ruin their lives?

532
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:02,171
Go.

533
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:04,754
Go and get sober
and then come back to work.

534
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:12,088
Here. If you insist that you need to drink
and are thirsting for it...

535
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,879
I am going to get you on track for Voluntary Retirement.

536
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,004
I am going to make a fixed deposit on their names.

537
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:19,838
You do whatever you want.
At least, they will move progress in life.

538
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,171
Go on.
Go and drink.

539
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:24,504
It seems like we were born to you guys
so that you could ruin it for us.

540
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:53,879
Hi, Srinu.

541
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:55,546
What brings you here Madam?

542
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,504
Hi.
-I am eating, madam.

543
00:40:57,504 --> 00:40:58,088
Okay, sit.

544
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:02,296
Since I don’t have friends around here...

545
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,421
I just thought I'll have my lunch with you.

546
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,879
Are you having Dosa?

547
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,338
Yes, madam.
-I love Dosa.

548
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:11,004
Brother, when you were the union leader,
that old hag...

549
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:12,713
I mean that ex-welfare officer.

550
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:14,754
Did she ever come to you
and have her lunch with you?

551
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:17,004
She used to sit in the same room and have her meals.

552
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:19,713
And this woman here,
comes with such enthusiasm.

553
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:22,046
She came and sat down with him as well.

554
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:26,463
She is getting all chummy with Srinu.
Isn’t it bothering you?

555
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:28,838
You?!
Are you back to that nonsense?

556
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:30,629
I can see it.

557
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:33,296
Stop making a ruckus.
Shut up and eat.

558
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:34,754
Narsingh.
-Brother...

559
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:36,046
Get madam a Dosa.

560
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:36,838
Alright, brother.
-No, I don’t need it.

561
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:38,171
This will be enough for me.

562
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:39,713
I will eat this.

563
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,421
And you eat this...
My lunch box.

564
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,254
Just try it.

565
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:46,463
Yadhi...

566
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,296
Madam gave me her lunch box.

567
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:53,588
I swear on my mother, madam.
- What?

568
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:56,463
I eat this thick bread only when I am sick, madam.
If not, I don’t.

569
00:41:56,671 --> 00:41:58,504
This isn’t thick bread, Srinu.

570
00:41:58,504 --> 00:41:59,879
This is Vada Pav.

571
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:02,296
People in Mumbai have this as a meal.

572
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:04,629
How does one eat this?

573
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:07,254
One minute.
It’s very simple.

574
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:12,129
Open the Pav like this,
Put the Vada in it like this,

575
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:14,171
And that’s it.
Ready to eat.

576
00:42:14,504 --> 00:42:15,796
Go for it.. Take a bite.

577
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:22,796
She got a bun, opened it and
put something inside.

578
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:25,213
As if he doesn’t have hands,
she even fed him.

579
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,963
Saidulu, I am going to kill you today.

580
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,879
Shut up and eat.

581
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:33,588
How is it?
-Superb, madam.

582
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,879
Try it with this sauce.
It’s going to be better.

583
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:46,546
How is it?

584
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:49,213
It’s even better with this paste, madam.

585
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:50,338
Paste?

586
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:52,754
You are eating like a caveman!

587
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,588
The sauce is all over your mouth, man.

588
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:56,754
What?!

589
00:42:57,046 --> 00:43:00,004
She even licked off his saliva.

590
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:00,629
damn!

591
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:01,796
I am going to die, brother.

592
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,004
How are you eating so nonchalantly, brother?

593
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,213
You piece of shit!
I am unable to take this.

594
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,088
I couldn’t take a single bite.
You... idiot.

595
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:13,296
Mr. Srinu.

596
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,713
Your son isn’t doing well in his studies.

597
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:18,796
He is not performing well.

598
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:21,421
He needs to concentrate.

599
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:24,004
It would be better if you pay attention.

600
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,421
What is it?
Why aren’t you studying?

601
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:31,963
He studies well, Madam.

602
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:35,421
I've been quite busy these days
with some Union work.

603
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,046
I will take care of this, madam.

604
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:42,046
Come fast.

605
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:45,546
Listen, a child is a mix of two sets of genes.

606
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,838
You don’t have education in your blood.
You are not educated.

607
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:48,546
And he doesn’t study well either.

608
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,754
Not only are you shaming me at home,
you are doing that to me in public now?

609
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:54,129
You...

610
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:57,046
Escort him to his class and go home.

611
00:44:00,129 --> 00:44:01,879
What’s going on?
Why isn’t he still here?

612
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:03,338
He must be taking...
Mr. Patnaik.

613
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:04,879
Looks like you have some work.

614
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:06,796
Saidulu, how are you?
-I am doing well, brother.

615
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:07,754
Madam called me.

616
00:44:07,754 --> 00:44:09,338
You seemed to have lucked out.

617
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:10,129
Who is it?

618
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:11,504
Madam, I am Srinu.

619
00:44:11,504 --> 00:44:13,046
Yes, Srinu.

620
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:14,504
Come in.
-She is asking me to come in.

621
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:15,963
I will be back.
You stay here.

622
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:17,879
Good evening, madam.

623
00:44:17,963 --> 00:44:19,546
Hi, good evening.
Come in.

624
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:21,171
Srinu, please close the door.

625
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:26,213
Madam asked me to close the door.

626
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:29,338
Really?

627
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:39,213
Isn't it customary to keep the doors
open while meeting a lady in her office?

628
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:42,088
When that old hag was in the office,
you would always keep the door open.

629
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:43,254
What the!

630
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:44,629
She is from Mumbai.

631
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,713
And Srinu is a hot-blooded man.

632
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,629
They have gone inside
and closed the doors.

633
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,421
I wonder what’s happening.

634
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:51,088
I don’t understand this story at all.

635
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,004
Saidulu.

636
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:53,671
Come here once.
I need to tell you something.

637
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:56,421
You piece of crap!
-Brother!

638
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:58,088
Are you on his side or mine?

639
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,421
If I hear another word from you,
I will hit you with this bucket.

640
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:01,671
Why should I care brother?!
-Get lost.

641
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:03,088
Why should I care brother?

642
00:45:03,463 --> 00:45:04,546
You saw what I saw.

643
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:06,254
Why? Don’t you see it?
-Sit down.

644
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:07,129
Move aside.

645
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:12,463
Srinu, all the 120 files and cheques are ready.

646
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,796
Are these the files you asked for?
Is anything missing?

647
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:15,671
Take a look.

648
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,754
Thank you, madam.
You were pretty quick.

649
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:22,296
I wonder what’s going on inside.

650
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:27,004
Everything is fine, madam.
But I can’t find Pedda Babu’s name.

651
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,296
Who is Pedda Babu?

652
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:29,921
I mean Rattaya.

653
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:32,213
Rattaya’s name is there.
It’s a big amount.

654
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:36,421
It shouldn’t be missing.
It must be there.

655
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:39,296
I put it here myself.

656
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:44,713
Kumarsamy... Manohar... Naresh,

657
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,296
Where is it?

658
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:51,088
Here it is!

659
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:54,046
Oh, it is?
It’s right here.

660
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:56,671
My eyes!
I didn’t see it, madam.

661
00:45:58,004 --> 00:46:00,588
It's all fine, madam.
-No problem, Srinu.

662
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:01,338
That’s fine.

663
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:02,921
So, do you want the cheques now?

664
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:06,838
As usual, credit them madam.
I will inform everyone.

665
00:46:08,963 --> 00:46:11,504
Keep the doors open, Srinu.
The heat is suffocating.

666
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:18,921
When he went in, he closed the doors.
And when he came out, he left them open.

667
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:21,296
Pedda Babu!
Come here.

668
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:22,879
I’ve been looking for you.
-What is it?

669
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:25,213
Your insurance money is here.
One lakh, ninety thousand.

670
00:46:25,213 --> 00:46:26,129
What do you want to do then?

671
00:46:26,463 --> 00:46:28,004
You tell me?
Aren’t you the one always advising people?

672
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:31,629
Buy a bike for Karthik.
He goes to tuitions.

673
00:46:33,254 --> 00:46:35,046
Are you paying attention to what I'm saying?

674
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:37,463
I was watching the plane.
-A plane?

675
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,421
I was thinking of buying that for Karthik.

676
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:40,504
Yes.

677
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,171
If Karthik does get himself a medical seat,
I am going to buy him a plane.

678
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,338
Everyday he would get on the plane in Yellandu
and get off at Warangal.

679
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:48,796
He would commute to the college in it.

680
00:46:49,088 --> 00:46:51,504
Don’t you think I know what to do with my money?!

681
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:53,796
You already made me quit alcohol because of him.

682
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:58,546
If Karthik doesn’t get that medical seat,
I will deal with you then.

683
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:00,213
I will get you on that wretched plane.

684
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:01,254
Get lost.

685
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:03,254
What the hell is he talking, brother?

686
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,879
Let him be.

687
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:07,088
Greetings, madam.
-Madam, greetings.

688
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:10,171
Srinu, is there a good shopping mall nearby?

689
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:12,171
Mall? Yes, it’s very close by.

690
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:13,921
I will ride first.
You follow me.

691
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,379
No. No. Hop into my vehicle.
I will drop you back.

692
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,588
Alright, madam.
Let’s do that.

693
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,296
Uncle... Tea.

694
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:31,463
What happened daughter?
What are you waiting for?

695
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:33,504
Nothing.

696
00:47:33,713 --> 00:47:36,546
Your son didn’t come home yet
and he didn’t bring my son home yet.

697
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,046
It’s been an hour since he finished school.

698
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:39,796
I wonder where he went.

699
00:47:40,129 --> 00:47:41,963
Srinu is not a small-time worker anymore.

700
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:43,504
He is a union leader now.

701
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:45,129
He must have a lot of things to do.

702
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:47,088
I wonder what got him busy.

703
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:50,004
Father-in-law, if that’s the case,
I will go and pick him up from school.

704
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:51,504
You stay right here.
-Alright, fine. Go on.

705
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:52,629
Don’t go anywhere.
-Go on, daughter. Go on.

706
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:00,796
Srinu? This colour will look very good on you.

707
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:02,296
Go change and come.

708
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,088
Me?

709
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:05,213
Why do I need clothes?

710
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:08,421
Srinu, my wardrobe is already full.

711
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:11,254
The real reason why we came here
is to buy you some clothes.

712
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:12,796
Look...

713
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:15,088
I can’t judge how you look when
you are dressed in your uniform.

714
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:17,504
But when you dress formally,
you will look superb.

715
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:18,546
You will surely rock it.

716
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,629
Trust me.
You'll look great.

717
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:22,921
Go on and try it.

718
00:48:23,421 --> 00:48:25,129
Madam, please no...
-Go.

719
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:28,713
Oh, Srinu... Wait.

720
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:31,254
When you come back...
tuck your shirt in and come.

721
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,213
Oh, my goodness!
These clothes fit me just right.

722
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,629
Wow!

723
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:47,296
It’s good.

724
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:49,629
Really good.

725
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,421
But... Something is missing.

726
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:58,254
Oh yeah.

727
00:48:58,546 --> 00:48:59,046
Come...

728
00:49:02,129 --> 00:49:02,879
Belt.

729
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:04,546
One minute.

730
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:05,963
Madam, Madam. No...

731
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:07,046
I will wear it myself.

732
00:49:14,671 --> 00:49:15,838
How does it look now, madam?

733
00:49:16,963 --> 00:49:19,588
What is this, madam?
It feels weird.

734
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:21,004
It feels cool

735
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:22,921
and smells great too.

736
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,046
It’s perfume, Srinu.

737
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,546
If it’s in the bottle, it has a particular kind of smell.

738
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:29,629
If you spray it into the air, it has a different kind of smell.

739
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:33,046
And if you spray it on me,
it has a different smell.

740
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:35,921
On you...

741
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:38,921
Wow!

742
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:42,171
Irresistible.

743
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:18,671
You found yourself a beauty now, Srinu?

744
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:21,504
Is that why you keep telling me not to touch you?

745
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,463
Come home today,
I will break your leg.

746
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:37,921
Hello.

747
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:39,254
I am back.

748
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:41,129
So, what do you want me to do?

749
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:42,879
Welcome you?

750
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:45,629
Do you want me to sing your praises?

751
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:50,171
That’s not what I meant.
I simply said I am back.

752
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,588
You were back yesterday, today
and will be back tomorrow as well.

753
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:53,671
Why do you need to inform me?

754
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:56,338
Gosh! Why is she this angry?

755
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,754
Listen.
Won’t you get up?

756
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,796
I came back. I washed myself and...

757
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:09,796
changed my clothes.
I am hungry.

758
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:10,921
So, what should I do?

759
00:51:11,963 --> 00:51:13,004
What should you do?

760
00:51:13,796 --> 00:51:15,004
Won’t you serve me food?

761
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:17,171
It’s right there.
Serve yourself.

762
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:18,629
I wonder why she is behaving like this.

763
00:51:20,004 --> 00:51:21,296
What have you cooked today?!

764
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,171
I made lentil soup.
Pour it and eat.

765
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:24,129
Hey...

766
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:26,379
Are you cured of your fear?

767
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:29,171
Do you want me to come into the bedroom
and take out my belt?

768
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,046
You are getting angry over petty things.

769
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,254
I am not angry.
Just eat.

770
00:51:33,796 --> 00:51:35,421
I have a headache.

771
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,254
I go out and work the whole day.

772
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:52,713
But I can't get a proper meal at night.

773
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:02,838
Keep the lights turned off.
I have a headache.

774
00:52:03,046 --> 00:52:04,504
First, take a look at what’s in the cover.

775
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:06,921
How does it matter what’s in the cover?
I will take a look at it in the morning.

776
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,629
Until you take a look at what’s in the cover,
I will not turn the lights off.

777
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,504
You won't live me in peace!

778
00:52:16,963 --> 00:52:17,879
Nothing much.

779
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:22,879
Ever since I became a Union leader,
I’ve been meeting a lot of higher ups.

780
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:26,921
I was getting sick of this uniform.
So, I bought a few pairs of clothes.

781
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:29,963
And for the past two years,
I didn’t buy you a single saree, right?

782
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:31,796
I bought a few sarees as well.

783
00:52:32,713 --> 00:52:35,546
This green sari will look
wonderful on you.

784
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:37,963
Take a look.

785
00:52:39,796 --> 00:52:40,963
Stop being angry and look this way.

786
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:58,463
You said your head was aching, right?
Did you take a tablet?

787
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:03,129
Put that saree aside and sleep.

788
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:03,796
Come.

789
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:45,463
Goddamn!

790
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,671
Can’t you women control yourselves?

791
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,754
Do you have to try on new clothes so quickly?

792
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:55,129
There is Sankrati, Ugadi, Dusshera, Deepavali (festivals)
and many more such occasions.

793
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:57,379
Well... I thought this green
sari would look good on me.

794
00:53:57,379 --> 00:53:58,338
That’s why I wore it.

795
00:53:58,338 --> 00:53:59,629
If you say...
-No. No. Let it be.

796
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:01,338
It looks quite good.

797
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:04,254
I am letting it go today.

798
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:06,463
Remember that those other sarees
are for festivals and other occasions.

799
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:09,629
That is all well.
Today is Sunday, right?

800
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,546
What do you want me to cook?

801
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:14,671
Chicken fry or chicken stew?

802
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,254
Go and ask your father-in-law.

803
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:18,171
Just make whatever he suggests.

804
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:19,838
Father-in-law?

805
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:24,088
Should I make chicken fry or chicken stew?

806
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:25,213
Make chicken stew.

807
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,963
The pieces of chicken will slip into the mouth easily.

808
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:30,338
Listen... Father-in-law wants chicken stew.

809
00:54:30,504 --> 00:54:31,921
Then why don’t you get to work?

810
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:32,713
Okay.

811
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:58,588
Greetings, Madam.

812
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,588
Good morning.

813
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,754
Good morning, Srinu.

814
00:55:01,588 --> 00:55:03,463
I wanted to have chicken biryani.

815
00:55:03,546 --> 00:55:06,129
Where can I find good chicken
biryani around here?

816
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:07,004
Biryani?

817
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:11,171
They don’t make good Biryani in the town.

818
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:14,713
I know of a restaurant at the outskirts.

819
00:55:15,129 --> 00:55:16,296
They make it really tasty.

820
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:17,338
Do one thing, madam.

821
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:22,213
Come to the park at 1 o’clock.
I will get it for you.

822
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:23,254
We shall eat together in the park.

823
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,546
Hey, what are you doing?

824
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:34,838
Our kid is watching us.

825
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:36,254
Are you teasing me?

826
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:37,463
He is off playing somewhere.

827
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:44,421
We might get caught by father-in-law.
Let me go.

828
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:45,838
He is outside.

829
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:47,296
If you stay quiet, he won’t realise.

830
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:49,338
Come here.
-Don’t make a mess.

831
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:51,713
You are just unable to control yourself today.

832
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:57,963
Anyways, what are you doing today?

833
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:01,588
Father-in-law said he wanted chicken stew, right?

834
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:03,046
That is why I am washing these pieces of chicken.

835
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:11,379
Well, I feel like eating your Kadai Biryani.

836
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:12,129
Goodness!

837
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:14,879
Thank God you told me before
I began making the stew.

838
00:56:14,879 --> 00:56:16,088
Go shower and come.

839
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:17,838
I will make you delicious Kadai Biryani.

840
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:21,046
Hey!

841
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:27,213
You are looking divine in this green sari.

842
00:56:27,213 --> 00:56:28,713
Go shower and come.

843
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:04,095
Hello.

844
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:06,345
Yes, hello.

845
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,554
What? You want me to come for a meeting?

846
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:12,887
Why would you organize a meeting on a Sunday?

847
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,304
Don’t you consider the fact
that we have wife and children at home?

848
00:57:15,137 --> 00:57:17,054
What? All the members have gathered?

849
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:19,054
Alright, fine. I’m coming.

850
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:21,137
I just have to wear my clothes.

851
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,345
Suvarna.

852
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:28,012
I am leaving.

853
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:30,387
I got a call.
Apparently, all the members of the union have assembled.

854
00:57:30,387 --> 00:57:31,512
They said it was an urgent meeting.

855
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:32,095
Wait... wait...

856
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,804
You asked me to make Kadai Biryani and
you are leaving without tasting it.

857
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:35,095
Have a bite and go.

858
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:37,220
Should I have a quick bite?
-Yes.

859
00:57:38,012 --> 00:57:40,345
I am getting late.I will eat it in the night.
-Wait. Wait.

860
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:42,304
I will pack it for you.
At least, you can try and eat there.

861
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:48,929
Careful.

862
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:49,845
Alright.

863
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:53,429
Srinu.
One minute. Just a minute.

864
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:56,054
What is it?

865
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:59,887
You have a large appetite.
I wasn’t sure if just one lunchbox would be enough for you

866
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:00,762
I packed another one for you.

867
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:03,595
Srinu, I made this out of so much love.

868
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:05,054
Don’t share it with anyone.

869
00:58:05,554 --> 00:58:06,304
Only you eat it.

870
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:07,470
Alright, fine.
Only I'll eat it.

871
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:18,720
What?
What happened Srinu?

872
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,804
I never wore such clothes all my life, madam.

873
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:22,720
Srinu, you’ve got the looks of a movie star.

874
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,429
Wait.

875
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:24,804
One minute. Look here.

876
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:27,845
Look here. Look.
-No, madam I don’t want to.

877
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:31,470
Srinu, why are you feeling shy?
-I feel weird, madam.

878
00:58:31,804 --> 00:58:32,845
Please stop it, madam.

879
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,304
That lady is smoking hot.

880
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:40,179
She seems to have lit up of Yellandu.

881
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,262
Why are you guys gawking?

882
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:43,845
Run away.

883
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:45,512
Don’t you have women in your house?

884
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:47,262
I am going to give you a whack, you idiot!

885
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,762
The world is gone to sh*t, madam.

886
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:57,720
You said you wanted to have Biryani.
Shall I take the box out?

887
00:59:00,095 --> 00:59:03,554
Survana!
I slipped. I fell down.

888
00:59:03,554 --> 00:59:05,762
What happened, father-in-law?
-Suvarna, I fell down. I fell down.

889
00:59:06,054 --> 00:59:07,387
I fell down.

890
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:09,512
One minute. One minute.

891

892
00:59:26,554 --> 00:59:27,429
Is it good?

893
00:59:29,804 --> 00:59:30,929
Pick the call, Srinu.

894
00:59:31,012 --> 00:59:32,262
You never know what kind of emergency it is.

895
00:59:34,929 --> 00:59:36,762
Hello.
Who is it?

896
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:39,762
Your father slipped from the stool
while getting up and fell down.

897
00:59:39,929 --> 00:59:41,554
It looks like his arm slipped from the socket.

898
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:43,554
The man is in great pain.

899
00:59:43,637 --> 00:59:45,845
We have to take him to the hospital.
Where are you?

900
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:48,470
Is that so?
That old man fell?!

901
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:52,179
Listen, do this.
Take him to the Collieries Hospital.

902
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,262
Tell them that Union leader Srinu sent you.

903
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,012
They would be quick on their feet.

904
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:57,554
Did you understand?

905
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,804
I am in an important meeting.

906
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,637
As soon as I finish here,
I’ll come to see the old man.

907
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:02,762
You...
You be careful.

908
01:00:02,845 --> 01:00:04,054
Go safely.
Safely.

909
01:00:05,304 --> 01:00:06,637
What happened, Srinu?

910
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:08,679
Apparently, some old man fell down.

911
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,887
I told them to take him to the hospital
and inform the staff that I sent them.

912
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,887
The number of responsibilities on me have increased, madam.

913
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:19,012
Dear...Suvarna?
-It’s quite close. Just a few more minutes.

914
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:20,720
Suvarna.
I am unable to breathe.

915
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,512
It’s close.
It’s close. Don’t worry.

916
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:25,095
How is the Biryani madam?

917
01:00:25,095 --> 01:00:27,720
It’s very good, Srinu.
It’s really very tasty.

918
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,512
Ask Srinu to come.

919
01:00:29,512 --> 01:00:30,762
Yes. yes. He will certainly come.

920
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:32,304
He said that he was in a meeting.

921
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,512
It’s close. It’s close.

922
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:40,345
Mom, I can smell biryani.

923
01:00:42,345 --> 01:00:43,804
Didn’t you wash your hands properly after you ate?

924
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:45,137
Mom, there is dad.

925
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:46,220
Here, take a piece of chicken.

926
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:55,179
So, the smell of Biryani is from there?
Not here?

927
01:00:55,429 --> 01:00:57,679
I told you that your father’s arm was broken.

928
01:00:58,304 --> 01:01:00,220
Is this the important meeting you were in, Srinu?

929
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:04,137
You are checking your phone now?

930
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:05,845
I told you that we need to go to the hospital.

931
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:08,470
And he is in absolute misery. Look, the signal turned green.
Go on. Drive.

932
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:10,387

Srinu,

I want to tell you something.

What is it?

948
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:19,345
You would go early in the morning
and return late at night.

949
01:02:20,054 --> 01:02:22,345
And you are also a Union leader.

950
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,512
Don’t waste my time.

951
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:26,304
Come to the point.
What do you want?

952
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:27,345
No. What I meant was...

I will learn.

956
01:02:38,137 --> 01:02:40,679
Do you need to ask me such a trivial thing?
How much do we need to pay there?

957
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,470
Rs. 2,000

958
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,304

Since you are a Union leader.

964
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,970

01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,512
What is all this?

1043
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:40,387
Srinu.

1044
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:43,929
Shall I tell you something?

1045
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:48,720
Even before we were married,
I completed my 12th grade.

1046
01:08:50,595 --> 01:08:52,304
I even enrolled in an Open University.

1047
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:56,637
You know what my mother said?

1048
01:08:58,929 --> 01:09:01,845
Your husband will flatter you on the bed.

1049
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:04,554
If he asks you about your education,

1050
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:08,137
don’t blurt out details about you clearing 12th grade
and enrolling in an Open University.

1051
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:11,470
It’s because he studied only till the 10th grade.

1052
01:09:12,054 --> 01:09:13,512
His ego is going to be hurt.

1053
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:16,637
And if his ego is hurt,

1054
01:09:18,012 --> 01:09:21,429
you will have ruined your own marital life.

1055
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:27,845
That is the reason why...

1056
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:32,054
Whenever you asked me,

1057
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:37,470
I kept telling you that
I failed my 6th grade or 7th grade.

1058
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,637
How would I know that...

1059
01:09:44,137 --> 01:09:47,054
you like educated women.

1060
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,679
That is the reason why I studied.

1061
01:09:58,262 --> 01:10:00,512
I studied really well.

1062
01:10:02,054 --> 01:10:02,679
But...

1063
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:12,345
I never thought my education
would land me in the newspapers.

1064
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:22,929
Do you like this Srinu?

1065
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,929
This is what you like, don’t you?

1066
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,720
You like women who dress this way.
Isn’t it, Srinu?

1067
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:35,137
Tell me

1068
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:40,054
I will wear even shorter clothes than this, Srinu.

1069
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:44,429
If you like it...
...I would wear even shorter clothes than this.

1070
01:10:44,429 --> 01:10:45,137
No....

1071
01:10:47,054 --> 01:10:49,762
If you want me to be naked,
I would do that too, Srinu.

1072
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:51,220
What are you doing?

1073
01:10:52,387 --> 01:10:56,304
What is all this?
Stop it. Stop...no.

1074
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,054
I beg you, Srinu.

1075
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:11,262
Don’t abandon me and my child.

1076
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:15,762
Both of us have no one else other than you, Srinu.

1077
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:22,262
I will do whatever you want me to.

1078
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,970
I will dance to your tunes.

1079
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:28,887
Don’t abandon us, please.

1080
01:11:49,345 --> 01:11:52,220
Will anyone leave Smitha and go back to Suvarna?

1081
01:11:56,095 --> 01:11:56,929
No one does that.

1082
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:02,179
If anyone says that they will,
he is a bloody liar.

1083
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:08,637
But Srinu compromised and went back to his family.
Because compromise is something I do.

1084
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:14,554
We are what we write
and what I write is in my fu**ing blood.

1085
01:12:23,804 --> 01:12:25,262
Remember all the things she said to me?

1086
01:12:27,387 --> 01:12:28,887
She said that love is a compromise.

1087
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,595
That love is a sacrifice.

1088
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:32,304
And there is divinity in love.

1089
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:37,887
I want to show her what I wrote.

1090
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:46,470
Gautham, what the hell is this man?!
What have you done to the house?

1091
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:47,679
You are married as well, right?

1092
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:51,095
Don’t you spouses ever fight?

1093
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:54,429
Yeah, we do but
we don’t break our things.

1094
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:56,470
This...
What is this on your hand?

1095
01:12:56,679 --> 01:12:57,762
Why did you come?

1096
01:12:59,012 --> 01:13:00,595
What do you want with me?
I am going out.

1097
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:07,054
You asked me to arrange for an
advance of one lakh from a publisher, right?

1098
01:13:07,512 --> 01:13:09,262
Here. Not one...
But two lakhs.

1099
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:11,054
This is double the encouragement.

1100
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,720
My father treats you like his own son.

1101
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,554
He’s agreed to publish your book.

1102
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:18,054
I trust you, man.

1103
01:13:18,387 --> 01:13:19,554
You can write really well.

1104
01:13:20,887 --> 01:13:22,595
Please don’t let me down in front of my father.

1105
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,470
It’s ok, buddy.

1106
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:33,054
I started writing.

1107
01:13:34,095 --> 01:13:37,387
My laptop is on the dining table.
Start reading.

1108
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:40,179
I will go meet Yamini and be back.

1109
01:13:43,845 --> 01:13:45,262
Hi Gautham.
-Hi.

1110
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:47,429
Is Yamini there?
-Yeah, she is there.

1111
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:51,637
Hi Yamini.

1112
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,470
Hey Pradeep. How are you?
-I am fine.

1113
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:57,679
Yamini, I must tell you something.

1114
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,970
Srinu is a labourer in Yellandu.

1115
01:14:02,929 --> 01:14:04,054
Means...

1116
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:07,262
He got a good education...

1117
01:14:07,304 --> 01:14:08,679
a big fancy job and...

1118
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:10,804
wanted to marry a beautiful girl.

1119
01:14:10,804 --> 01:14:13,345
But, because of his father,
he became a labourer.

1120
01:14:13,804 --> 01:14:15,845
And they got himself married to a dimwit.

1121
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:40,929
Gautham, who is that Srinu?

1122
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:43,554
Who is Smitha? Who is Suvarna?
What are you talking?

1123
01:14:43,637 --> 01:14:45,429
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1124
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:47,679
I started writing.

1125
01:14:48,637 --> 01:14:50,012
I want to celebrate with you.

1126
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:52,429
Could you take the rest of the day off?

1127
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:53,720
Did you eat?

1128
01:14:55,345 --> 01:14:57,095
You usually have a headache if you don’t eat.

1129
01:14:57,429 --> 01:14:59,304
Come.
Let’s go out and eat.

1130
01:14:59,512 --> 01:15:01,845
Let’s go to Nanking.

1131
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:07,220
Yamini, don’t leave the house so suddenly.

1132
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:08,429
Where were you last night?

1133
01:15:08,929 --> 01:15:10,262
At your father’s?
-Yamini ma’am.

1134
01:15:10,762 --> 01:15:11,804
Do you have five minutes to spare?

1135
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,512
Ma’am is going out for lunch.
Deal with it later.

1136
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:15,345
Okay, sir.

1137
01:15:19,262 --> 01:15:20,554
Hi, sir.
-Hi.

1138
01:15:22,887 --> 01:15:23,720
Greetings, sir.

1139
01:15:23,929 --> 01:15:25,095
Hello, madam.

1140
01:15:25,095 --> 01:15:28,470
I told you not to let any Tom, Dick and Harry
in without my permission. Didn’t I?

1141
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:31,304
If anyone enters without my permission,
you are out of your job.

1142
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:36,304
Who was that Tom, Dick and Harry
she was referring to?

1143
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:37,929
Not you, sir.

1144
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:39,929
Yamini!

1145
01:15:40,304 --> 01:15:43,304
Who were you referring to when
you said any Tom, Dick and Harry?

1146
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:44,679
Open. Open.
Open the door.

1147
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:46,137
Open it.

1148
01:15:46,137 --> 01:15:46,804
Open the door.

1149
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:47,679
I will lose my job.

1150
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,470
Please go, Sir.

1151
01:16:03,637 --> 01:16:05,929
She treats me as a nobody.
And just kept running her mouth mercilessly.

1152
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:11,512
But she will never know in her entire life,
how she came about this job.

1153
01:16:14,054 --> 01:16:14,845
What is this, sir?

1154
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,179
It’s recession right now.

1155
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:18,220
Layoffs are happening.

1156
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,429
Sir...

1157
01:16:23,637 --> 01:16:25,470
I see Yamini’s name here.

1158
01:16:25,637 --> 01:16:27,220
I know that you both are a couple.

1159
01:16:27,345 --> 01:16:30,262
But then, family is family.
Business is business.

1160
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:31,887
I have an idea, sir.

1161
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,887
I’ve been contemplating on quitting the job for a while now.

1162
01:16:36,512 --> 01:16:38,095
But I am not able to.

1163
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:40,554
I think it’s time we talk about it.

1164
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:44,887
Well, if you want,
we can retain Yamini.

1165
01:16:44,887 --> 01:16:47,720
No, sir.
That is not what I meant.

1166
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:50,387
I worked for the sake of financial security.

1167
01:16:50,387 --> 01:16:53,429
But, writing’s been always my passion.

1168
01:16:54,137 --> 01:16:56,429
Yamini passed out from a very good college.

1169
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:57,595
She is a very intelligent girl.

1170
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,512
If you give her an opportunity,
she would definitely take my position within a year.

1171
01:17:02,137 --> 01:17:03,429
I can understand.

1172
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:08,595
But, I wanted to send you to Paris with
a better package and a better future.

1173
01:17:08,845 --> 01:17:09,804
I am sorry, sir.

1174
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,387
I’ve made up my mind.

1175
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,387
I can’t take up your Paris offer.

1176
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:17,679
But, I do have a request.

1177
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,054
Please retain Yamini.

1178
01:17:19,887 --> 01:17:20,470
Okay.

1179
01:17:26,762 --> 01:17:27,887
Yamini, I want to...

1180
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:29,470
I just can’t believe it.
You are stalking me now...

1181
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:30,387
Yamini...

1182
01:17:32,137 --> 01:17:35,262
What do you mean by a nobody? And stalking?
What nonsense are you spilling?

1183
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:37,179
Speak to me for five minutes.

1184
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,220
Yamini, can’t you speak to me for five minutes?
What is this?

1185
01:17:41,137 --> 01:17:42,970
I wanted to spend my entire life with you.

1186
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:44,179
And you completely ruined it.

1187
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:45,679
Now you ask me for five minutes.

1188
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,220
I don’t have fu**ing five minutes for you.

1189
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:47,970
Yamini!

1190
01:18:06,054 --> 01:18:07,054
Yamini!

1191
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:19,762
Yamini!

1192
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:21,804
Yamini! stop

1193
01:18:26,387 --> 01:18:27,929
Yamini!

1194
01:18:37,387 --> 01:18:39,054
Yamini!

1195
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:43,095
Fu**ing wait for me!

1196
01:18:50,107 --> 01:18:50,815
Yamini!

1197
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,607
Mr. Gautham... Mr. Gautham...
Yamini isn’t here.

1198
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,357
Didn’t she just return from the office?

1199
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,107
Where did she go?

1200
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:00,315
She and her father went out.

1201
01:19:13,857 --> 01:19:14,565
They will come back, right?

1202
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:17,690
Maybe in an hour or two,
maybe today or tomorrow.

1203
01:19:18,065 --> 01:19:19,315
I will wait until they come back.

1204
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:22,273
I need to speak to Yamini and her father.

1205
01:19:22,773 --> 01:19:26,398
Here... I didn’t eat anything since morning.
Is there anything to eat?

1206
01:19:26,898 --> 01:19:27,565
Are there eggs?

1207
01:19:27,898 --> 01:19:28,607
Yes.

1208
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,523
Make me an omelette.
-Alright, sir.

1209
01:19:39,482 --> 01:19:41,023
Hey!
Giri...Vamsi!

1210
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,857
There is a really hot chick in the first year batch.
Come on, let’s go.

1211
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,482
We've been studying together since childhood

1212
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,523
Coincidentally, we got enrolled in the same college.

1213
01:19:53,023 --> 01:19:54,773
Excuse me...
-And all of us like the same girl.

1214
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:55,732
Do you have a lighter?

1215
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:57,440
Lighter?

1216
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:00,732
Sabya...

1217
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,982
Buddy, things pertaining to girls usually end up in fights.

1218
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:05,982
Brother.
-That’s true.

1219
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:07,690
That’s how friendships are ruined.

1220
01:20:07,815 --> 01:20:09,523
There’s just one thing I want to say.

1221
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:11,982
If the girl likes anyone amongst us,
she is his girlfriend.

1222
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:14,357
And for the rest of us, she becomes the sister-in-law.
-Okay... Ok.

1223
01:20:14,357 --> 01:20:16,023
It’s a really funny class.

1224
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:18,232
Who is going to approach her first?

1225
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:19,773
Let’s toss a coin.

1226
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,648
Yes. Let’s toss.

1227
01:20:21,857 --> 01:20:22,815
Yes. Let’s toss a coin.

1228
01:20:25,357 --> 01:20:27,523
Who the hell are you?
-Sorry, boys.

1229
01:20:29,232 --> 01:20:31,982
Actually, I studied management in my degree as well.
I am so looking forward to it.

1230
01:20:32,023 --> 01:20:33,148
Hey, classical dancer.

1231
01:20:33,857 --> 01:20:34,482
Hey Gautham.

1232
01:20:34,857 --> 01:20:36,565
Hi.
-How are you?

1233
01:20:37,898 --> 01:20:40,023
We are late to class.
-Come, let’s go.

1234
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:41,190
Yamini, stop.

1235
01:20:42,482 --> 01:20:43,357
Give me a hug, please.

1236
01:20:44,648 --> 01:20:45,773
Ah! So sweet.

1237
01:20:46,023 --> 01:20:47,982
No. no. I don’t want this side hug.

1238
01:20:48,732 --> 01:20:52,148
I want a warm tight hug.

1239
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:01,398
Why did you need a hug so early in the morning?

1240
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,857
Is anyone watching us from behind?

1241
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:07,898
Yes, they are.

1242
01:21:09,315 --> 01:21:11,023
They are observing us.

1243
01:21:11,023 --> 01:21:12,273
Why?

1244
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:13,523
Give me one kiss

1245
01:21:15,273 --> 01:21:16,107
One small peck.

1246
01:21:16,315 --> 01:21:17,315
No! Are you mad?

1247
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:19,273
Yamini, just a small kiss.
Just a peck on the cheek.

1248
01:21:19,607 --> 01:21:22,523
Gautham... Yamini, please for me.
-Everybody is watching. No!

1249
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:24,107
Yamini...please.
-No. I won’t.

1250
01:21:24,107 --> 01:21:25,898
No.
-Yamini, I’m begging you.

1251
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:27,523
Alright.

1252
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:30,565
Turn your face.

1253
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,440
I am pursuing my M.B.A too.

1254
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,690
I cleared my CAT exam.

1255
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,440
Don’t act smart with me.

1256
01:21:45,648 --> 01:21:48,523
If you want a kiss,
turn your face.

1257
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:56,107
What's going on Dude...?

1258
01:21:56,773 --> 01:22:00,107
Boys, keep the change.

1259
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:03,857
What’s all this?

1260
01:22:05,273 --> 01:22:06,815
You asked of a hug and a kiss.

1261
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:08,565
and telling them to keep the change.

1262
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:10,107
What’s happening here?

1263
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,440
Yamini, I am very ambitious.

1264
01:22:13,857 --> 01:22:15,148
I want to reach great heights.

1265
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,232
For that, I need to focus on my studies, right?

1266
01:22:18,273 --> 01:22:20,398
This entire batch is trying to court you.

1267
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:26,523
And now, it will be so time-consuming to compete with them every day,

1268
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:30,023
If things don't workout, I might get deeply hurt...

1269
01:22:30,023 --> 01:22:32,065
and that might affect my studies.

1270
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:33,440
That’s why...

1271
01:22:34,857 --> 01:22:37,023
I asked you for a kiss to make it clear.

1272
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:39,232
They should also know...

1273
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:41,357
that we are in love.

1274
01:22:43,815 --> 01:22:45,065
What?

1275
01:22:45,232 --> 01:22:46,940
What makes you think I am in love with you?

1276
01:22:47,148 --> 01:22:47,607
I know.

1277
01:22:49,148 --> 01:22:50,482
You have to ask yourself.

1278
01:22:51,898 --> 01:22:52,857
Shall we go to the class?

1279
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:55,982
He is cute, no?

1280
01:22:56,398 --> 01:22:57,732
Damn it!

1281
01:22:57,982 --> 01:22:59,232
Hey, Gautham!
Wait for me.

1282
01:22:59,982 --> 01:23:03,565
Product knowledge and Time management.
-Excuse me, sir.

1283
01:23:03,982 --> 01:23:06,232
Nobody walks in late to my class, Gautham.

1284
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,232
Sir, there was lots of traffic.

1285
01:23:08,357 --> 01:23:11,232
It’s the same for whole Hyderabad too.
Please get out now.

1286
01:23:16,773 --> 01:23:18,523
I still see you here.
-I’m leaving, sir.

1287
01:23:18,898 --> 01:23:19,523
Good.

1288
01:23:21,773 --> 01:23:22,482
What are you doing?

1289
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:23,732
Come with me.
-What are you doing Gautham?

1290
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:25,607
What?

1291
01:23:25,857 --> 01:23:27,357
We will be on time tomorrow, sir.

1292
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:30,565
You said that there was a very big reason

1293
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:32,148
for this Dosa treat.
What is it?

1294
01:23:32,315 --> 01:23:33,398
I didn’t have my breakfast.

1295
01:23:33,482 --> 01:23:35,107
Oh really? Breakfast, huh?

1296
01:23:36,815 --> 01:23:37,357
Stupid.

1297
01:23:37,982 --> 01:23:38,565
You know what?

1298
01:23:38,898 --> 01:23:39,357
What?

1299
01:23:40,523 --> 01:23:42,065
You are born beautiful.

1300
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,565
And I grew up to be...

1301
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:48,398
And you grew up to be

1302
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,565
Hot...Sexy...

1303
01:23:51,773 --> 01:23:52,690
That’s it, huh?

1304
01:23:53,023 --> 01:23:54,565
Hey...
-Stop it!

1305
01:23:54,565 --> 01:23:55,190
You... silly.

1306
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:01,940
Why didn’t you come to the class?
What are you doing here?

1307
01:24:02,482 --> 01:24:03,190
Me?

1308
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:05,232
What are you writing?

1309
01:24:07,273 --> 01:24:10,815
I want to excel in the field of sales.

1310
01:24:11,523 --> 01:24:13,190
But I am a little scared of numbers.

1311
01:24:13,773 --> 01:24:15,273
There must be a lot of people like me, right?

1312
01:24:16,148 --> 01:24:19,232
So, for people like me,
I am replacing numbers with words

1313
01:24:19,232 --> 01:24:20,857
and in a way that’s easy to comprehend.

1314
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:24,148
I am trying to write a book called ‘Simple Economics’.

1315
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:26,273
Oh, you are a writer now?

1316
01:24:26,357 --> 01:24:27,315
No, nothing like that.

1317
01:24:27,315 --> 01:24:28,523
Okay, did you eat?

1318
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:30,607
Uh, no.

1319
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:32,190
Okay, let’s go eat.

1320
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:34,690
Come on. Let’s go.

1321
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:38,482
Sir...

1322
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,273
Why is Yamini behaving in such a manner?

1323
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:42,690
Put it there.

1324
01:24:56,232 --> 01:24:56,982
What are these?

1325
01:24:57,607 --> 01:25:00,023
They must be looking for matrimonial
alliances for Yamini.

1326
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:14,482
You arrogant prick!

1327
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:16,773
Look what you did to my car.

1328
01:25:17,065 --> 01:25:18,357
Sorry.
-Sorry?

1329
01:25:18,357 --> 01:25:19,523
Will everything be resolved if you just apologise?

1330
01:25:19,523 --> 01:25:20,398
Get out of your vehicle.

1331
01:25:20,398 --> 01:25:21,857
Get down and see.

1332
01:25:21,857 --> 01:25:23,148
Come and see what it is.

1333
01:25:23,148 --> 01:25:24,565
Just a minute.
-Get down. Get out and see.

1334
01:25:24,857 --> 01:25:25,732
You mad fellow!

1335
01:25:25,898 --> 01:25:27,190
I asked you to get out.
How dare you leave?!

1336
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:35,815
Have you lost it?

1337
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:37,440
You hit the my vehicle again.
Get down.

1338
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,607
If you see someone is disturbed,
just accept the apology and move on.

1339
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:41,648
See... what's now happened.

1340
01:25:42,815 --> 01:25:44,857
I won’t leave you.
Are you out of your mind?

1341
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:48,065
0143.
I will not leave you alone.

1342
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,648
When you are in love,
Don’t take stupid emotional decisions.

1343
01:26:04,815 --> 01:26:06,607
Look... in the end, they don’t even pick up your calls.

1344
01:26:07,732 --> 01:26:10,023
That day,
If only I had listened to my boss,

1345
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:13,815
I would have been in Paris earning in Euros
and living the life I wanted.

1346
01:26:15,982 --> 01:26:17,607
I would have been in bloody Paris.

1347
01:26:20,607 --> 01:26:24,190
♫ How are you, Paris? ♫
♫ How are you? ♫

1348
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:34,232

1362
01:27:50,607 --> 01:27:53,023
(crowd murmuring in French)

1363
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,190
Hello...

1364
01:27:56,607 --> 01:28:00,148
So, guys, in just two years,
our radio station has broken even.

1365
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,273
In just two years.

1366
01:28:02,857 --> 01:28:04,065
Hello, friends.

1367
01:28:04,357 --> 01:28:08,523
Our radio station in Paris
has turned profitable in just two years.

1368
01:28:08,648 --> 01:28:10,565
Well done, guys.
Well done.

1369
01:28:12,523 --> 01:28:14,148
And one more thing.

1370
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:16,607
Our headquarters in Bombay...

1371
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:20,857
has decided
to give you all a three months bonus.

1372
01:28:23,815 --> 01:28:26,482
Well, well, well.
Go get some drinks and enjoy

1373
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:28,607
But be back tomorrow, huh?
We are working tomorrow.

1374
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:29,315
Good evening.

1375
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,398
Mary?
-Yes.

1376
01:28:37,565 --> 01:28:40,148
Mary, I’d asked you to withdraw all my money.
Did you get it?

1377
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:40,690
Yes.

1378
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:43,315
It’s 350,000 euros.

1379
01:28:43,315 --> 01:28:44,982
Yes. Yes. Yes.
-It’s in the bag upstairs.

1380
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:45,857
Yeah, bring it.

1381
01:29:14,648 --> 01:29:15,940
So, how do we play?

1382
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,982
Sir, you have to choose a number

1383
01:29:17,982 --> 01:29:20,565
But you can bet around the table.

1384
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:22,773
So, it can be here,

1385
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:23,940
One time...

1386
01:29:24,357 --> 01:29:25,273
One time...

1387
01:29:25,648 --> 01:29:26,565
One time...

1388
01:29:27,482 --> 01:29:28,773
17 times

1389
01:29:29,607 --> 01:29:31,190
and 35 times.

1390
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:32,690
35 times?

1391
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,523
Yes. 35 times.

1392
01:29:35,607 --> 01:29:36,523
Okay, let’s go.

1393
01:29:37,023 --> 01:29:39,107
Okay.
How much do you want to bet?

1394
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:39,940
All in.

1395
01:29:40,065 --> 01:29:42,898
No.. no... please no.

1396
01:29:44,773 --> 01:29:45,690
Guys...

1397
01:29:47,857 --> 01:29:49,815
This bet is not about winning or losing.

1398
01:29:51,273 --> 01:29:53,690
You know when I put all my life savings in,

1399
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:57,648
it’s about experiencing in this moment of...

1400
01:29:58,690 --> 01:29:59,773
will I win it

1401
01:30:01,315 --> 01:30:02,607
or lose everything?

1402
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,690
And, that feeling is priceless.

1403
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,065
So, all in.

1404
01:30:08,273 --> 01:30:09,357
No, Gautham.

1405
01:30:11,148 --> 01:30:12,023
Mary. It’s ok.

1406
01:30:13,023 --> 01:30:13,690
All in.

1407
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:18,148
So now, you have to choose a number.

1408
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,023
Let’s go with the devil’s number.

1409
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:20,773
13.

1410
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:22,232
Okay.

1411
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:24,190
350,000 on 13

1412
01:30:28,232 --> 01:30:28,857
Place to bet.

1413
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,898
Place it, please.

1414
01:30:48,232 --> 01:30:49,523
Wow!

1415
01:30:51,898 --> 01:30:52,690
Thank you.

1416
01:30:54,648 --> 01:30:55,857
Mary, credit the money.

1417
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:58,232
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

1418
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,273
Excuse me, please.

1419
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:12,607
Thank you

1420
01:31:14,815 --> 01:31:15,273
No problem.

1421
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,440
The fourth floor please.

1422
01:31:45,607 --> 01:31:47,273
I hope you are not following me.

1423
01:31:47,565 --> 01:31:48,315
Sorry.

1424
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:51,065
Please speak in English.
I know very little French.

1425
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:53,732
Ok... by any chance, are you following me?

1426
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:56,482
Oh... no. no. I live right here.
That’s my flat.

1427
01:31:57,607 --> 01:31:58,315
Really?

1428
01:31:58,398 --> 01:32:00,273
How come we never met?
I live here.

1429
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:02,148
What?!
-Yes.

1430
01:32:02,857 --> 01:32:04,398
I am usually in bed by this time.

1431
01:32:04,398 --> 01:32:06,107
I work from 10 to 5.

1432
01:32:06,107 --> 01:32:07,315
So I get really tired.

1433
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:09,523
Tonight, I was out partying.

1434
01:32:09,648 --> 01:32:10,565
So...Got really late.

1435
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:11,898
Maybe that’s why we never met.

1436
01:32:11,898 --> 01:32:14,773
I usually go to work at 3:30 and come back around his time.

1437
01:32:14,773 --> 01:32:15,190
Ok.

1438
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:17,565
Are you from India?

1439
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:19,732
Yeah. How do you know?

1440
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:21,440
I don’t know...
Your face.

1441
01:32:22,148 --> 01:32:23,607
I used to fly a lot there.

1442
01:32:23,607 --> 01:32:25,398
I love India.
I love the culture there.

1443
01:32:25,482 --> 01:32:26,148
Oh!

1444
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:27,107
Do you speak Hindi?

1445
01:32:27,315 --> 01:32:30,857
No. I speak a language called ‘Telugu’.
We speak it down south.

1446
01:32:31,148 --> 01:32:33,232
I know a little bit of Telugu.

1447
01:32:33,398 --> 01:32:33,982
What?!

1448
01:32:36,023 --> 01:32:38,023
You speak...how?

1449
01:32:38,523 --> 01:32:42,398
I used to fly to Rajiv Gandhi International
Airport, Hyderabad.

1450
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:46,940
So, my company policy is to learn
the language of the destination.

1451
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,357
That’s why I took some classes.

1452
01:32:48,357 --> 01:32:52,482
But I don’t speak so good.
-No. No. You are speaking Telugu really well.

1453
01:32:52,482 --> 01:32:53,232
Yeah!

1454
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:54,273
I am Iza.

1455
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,523
Gautham.
-Nice to meet you

1456
01:32:56,523 --> 01:32:57,148
Pleasure.

1457
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,232
So, good night Gautham.

1458
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:00,732
Good night, Iza.

1459
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:01,857
Bye.

1460
01:33:05,607 --> 01:33:07,357
Good evening Iza.
-Good evening Gautham.

1461
01:33:08,065 --> 01:33:09,773
What happened?
Are you late today?

1462
01:33:15,982 --> 01:33:16,732
How was your day?

1463
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:17,815
Good.

1464
01:33:19,023 --> 01:33:19,898
Excuse me...

1465
01:33:20,023 --> 01:33:20,732
After you.

1466
01:33:27,398 --> 01:33:29,315
What’s with this small talk?

1467
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,607
Did I really need to go to France to have small talk?

1468
01:33:34,315 --> 01:33:35,940
I wasn’t this shy with Yamini.

1469
01:33:37,232 --> 01:33:40,357
Iza is a pilot. So, she would like things to move fast.
Like a Jet.

1470
01:33:41,398 --> 01:33:43,898
Get to the interesting part.
What an embarrassment you are!

1471
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:03,055
Good evening Gautham.

1472
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,347
Good evening, Iza.

1473
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,930
Are you going somewhere or just got back?

1474
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:07,597
No.

1475
01:34:09,389 --> 01:34:10,264
Let me get that.

1476
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,264
No, it’s ok

1477
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:13,514
I insist.

1478
01:34:14,472 --> 01:34:15,097
Okay.

1479
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,597
You look like you are going to work.

1480
01:34:18,847 --> 01:34:20,305
I don’t work on Sundays.

1481
01:34:22,764 --> 01:34:26,014
Actually, I don’t work on Saturdays as well.

1482
01:34:26,305 --> 01:34:30,597
Well, then... where did you
return from yesterday...

1483
01:34:30,597 --> 01:34:31,680
So late?

1484
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,180
I put an alarm, woke up,
got ready and came down.

1485
01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:37,555
I was waiting for you.

1486
01:34:38,347 --> 01:34:39,764
Why, Gautham?

1487
01:34:40,014 --> 01:34:41,889
I thought French women were smart.

1488
01:34:44,764 --> 01:34:46,930
Gautham, what are you doing tomorrow?

1489
01:34:47,805 --> 01:34:50,222
Just a normal day.
-It’s my day off.

1490
01:34:50,389 --> 01:34:52,305
Shall we go out?
-Yes.

1491
01:34:52,805 --> 01:34:53,555
Sure.

1492
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,014
Okay.

1493
01:34:56,222 --> 01:34:56,972
Good night.

1494
01:35:03,139 --> 01:35:04,847
Things that we plan in life don’t always work out.

1495
01:35:09,597 --> 01:35:10,972
But on paper,

1496
01:35:12,305 --> 01:35:14,097
everything goes according to my wishes.

1497
01:35:14,555 --> 01:35:16,097
I bloody decide.

1498
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,347
[Performing yoga]

1499
01:35:40,347 --> 01:35:42,055
Keep your eyes closed.

1500
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,764
And breath in naturally.

1501
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,805
What shall we do?
He slept off.

1502
01:36:04,805 --> 01:36:05,805
Ah, yes. Look.

1503
01:36:07,097 --> 01:36:08,305
He is asleep.

1504
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:09,305
Look. Look.

1505
01:36:12,055 --> 01:36:12,889
Gautham...

1506
01:36:13,014 --> 01:36:13,847
Gautham...

1507
01:36:14,055 --> 01:36:14,889
Gautham...

1508
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:19,597
It’s a pose.

1509
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:21,972
Not a pose. You were asleep.
Come.

1510
01:36:31,305 --> 01:36:33,055
Did you propose to me yesterday?

1511
01:36:34,514 --> 01:36:34,972
Yeah.

1512
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:37,472
But, have you given it a thought?

1513
01:36:38,014 --> 01:36:39,805
We don’t even know each other properly.

1514
01:36:40,055 --> 01:36:41,305
Did you think about it?

1515
01:36:41,389 --> 01:36:43,889
I fell for you, the very first time that I saw you.

1516
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:48,055
But still, I did think for three minutes.

1517
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:50,847
The feeling didn’t change.

1518
01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:53,264
I told you.

1519
01:36:56,097 --> 01:36:57,097
Did you give it a thought?

1520
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,805
You don’t like Yoga, right?

1521
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,514
My kind of Yoga is different.

1522
01:37:08,514 --> 01:37:09,514
Wanna see?

1523
01:37:23,139 --> 01:37:25,847
Gautham, what are you doing?
Are you trying to kill me or what?

1524
01:37:25,972 --> 01:37:27,305
You are a pilot, right?

1525
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:30,180
I fly a plane.
I don’t jump from it!

1526
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:33,555
Come here.

1527
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:39,805
Feel the wind.

1528
01:37:41,347 --> 01:37:42,055
Trust me.

1529
01:37:42,847 --> 01:37:44,097
It’ll be amazing.

1530
01:37:48,347 --> 01:37:50,597

Gautham, wait.

1564
01:41:32,889 --> 01:41:36,097
I always wanted my man to wear a black
suit and a bow tie.

1565
01:41:36,097 --> 01:41:37,514
Can you go get dressed?

1566
01:42:16,822 --> 01:42:17,780
Gautham...

1567
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:20,114
Gautham... Listen to me.

1568
01:42:20,114 --> 01:42:20,822
What?

1569
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:23,864
Listen to me...Listen.

1570
01:42:24,489 --> 01:42:26,155
It just crossed my mind.

1571
01:42:27,322 --> 01:42:29,739
Don’t you Indians have sex after
you get married?

1572
01:42:30,697 --> 01:42:32,614
Such a pure thing for you guys.

1573
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:34,905
Is it ok to be doing this?

1574
01:42:36,364 --> 01:42:37,697
I am not that regular Indian.

1575
01:42:38,072 --> 01:42:39,530
So, it’s ok.

1576
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,072
It’s ok.

1577
01:42:56,289 --> 01:42:57,664
Gautham...Listen to me!

1578
01:42:59,622 --> 01:43:01,872
Are you okay?
I am sorry.

1579
01:43:04,747 --> 01:43:07,705
We are so young. We have so much time.
And we are in love.

1580
01:43:08,497 --> 01:43:11,122
We can do whatever we want after marriage.

1581
01:43:11,747 --> 01:43:12,664
I’m sorry.

1582
01:43:18,789 --> 01:43:19,414
What?

1583
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:23,205
Why are you laughing?

1584
01:43:35,455 --> 01:43:36,872
Are you angry?

1585
01:43:44,455 --> 01:43:45,080
Stop it.

1586
01:43:49,455 --> 01:43:50,747
I am sorry, Gautham.

1587
01:43:50,914 --> 01:43:52,747
It’s my birthday. Don’t be angry.

1588
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:54,205
I am not angry.
Who said I’m angry?

1589
01:43:54,705 --> 01:43:56,622
Let’s make something memorable.

1590
01:43:57,289 --> 01:43:57,955
Okay.

1591
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:01,539
Let's make it memorable day.

1592
01:44:06,705 --> 01:44:07,914
Hey, man! Come on.

1593
01:44:09,705 --> 01:44:11,039
Hey, Gautham.

1594
01:44:11,205 --> 01:44:12,289
Hey!

1595
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:14,247
Hey! Man.
-What’s happening tonight?

1596
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:16,497
Nothing, man.
You tell me what you want to do.

1597
01:44:16,497 --> 01:44:17,455
Let’s drag.

1598
01:44:18,122 --> 01:44:19,705
Okay. Anyone up for dragging?

1599
01:44:19,997 --> 01:44:21,205
Yeah. I’m in.

1600
01:44:22,247 --> 01:44:23,830
So, let’s drag.
-Let’s go.

1601
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:31,372
Hello, Gautham.

1602
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:37,372
Hello, doctor.

1603
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:38,747
How are you today?

1604
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,539
I am good.

1605
01:45:40,705 --> 01:45:42,164
How is your hand?

1606
01:45:43,247 --> 01:45:44,039
There’s pain.

1607
01:45:44,955 --> 01:45:45,789
But I’m fine.

1608
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,580
I have good news.
You can go back home today.

1609
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:50,580
Doctor?
-Yes.

1610
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,330
There was a girl with me.

1611
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,372
Where is she?

1612
01:45:59,039 --> 01:45:59,914
Hey, Gautham.

1613
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:03,622
Don’t worry.
She is fine.

1614
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,830
What happened to her eyes doctor?

1615
01:46:15,872 --> 01:46:17,372
Because of the big impact,

1616
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:20,330
She lost her vision.

1617
01:46:20,997 --> 01:46:21,830
But doctor...

1618
01:46:23,372 --> 01:46:25,039
She was wearing her helmet.

1619
01:46:28,039 --> 01:46:29,289
It saved her life.

1620
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:31,747
Not her eyes.

1621
01:46:32,664 --> 01:46:36,664
We've asked for a donation from all European
Union banks and Red Cross.

1622
01:46:37,455 --> 01:46:39,289
She is now on top of the list.

1623
01:46:39,622 --> 01:46:40,789
Now we need to wait.

1624
01:46:48,664 --> 01:46:50,330
You asked me for one unforgettable memory...

1625
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:53,372
And I... I gave you a lifetime’s worth of darkness.

1626
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:54,830
I am sorry, Iza.

1627
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:57,914
I can no longer see you with such
guilt in my heart.

1628
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:14,497
Attention dear passengers
of Flight Air Lilly...

1629
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:34,164
Iza...

1630
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:36,205
Iza...

1631
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:38,539
It’s a night halt for us.

1632
01:47:38,789 --> 01:47:40,289
What are your plans for the evening?

1633
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:43,080
How about dinner tonight?

1634
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:53,039
It’s been 6 months since I regained my vision.

1635
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:56,539
I would like to walk along the beautiful
streets of this town.

1636
01:47:56,747 --> 01:47:57,997
Let’s meet in Paris?

1637
01:47:58,414 --> 01:47:59,289
No problem.

1638
01:48:46,872 --> 01:48:47,789
Excuse me, madam.

1639
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,247
Gautham.

1640
01:49:28,497 --> 01:49:29,372
Coffee, Iza?

1641
01:49:32,455 --> 01:49:33,997
What happened to your eyes?

1642
01:49:34,955 --> 01:49:35,705
Peter...

1643
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,497
One cappuccino please.

1644
01:49:41,789 --> 01:49:43,747
They live on in a face beautiful than mine.

1645
01:49:44,205 --> 01:49:47,664
They look at this world from up there.

1646
01:49:47,872 --> 01:49:48,497
Gautham.

1647
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,039
They are travelling the globe.

1648
01:49:51,914 --> 01:49:52,747
But Gautham...

1649
01:49:52,747 --> 01:49:55,705
How could you decide this by yourself?
And why did you not tell me?

1650
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,122
I wanted to tell you.

1651
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:01,289
But you were unconscious then.

1652
01:50:02,997 --> 01:50:04,622
I didn’t know when you would wake up.

1653
01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:08,705
Actually, I didn’t know if you would ever
wake up.

1654
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,664
Gautham, stop it.

1655
01:50:13,497 --> 01:50:14,164
Iza....

1656
01:50:16,205 --> 01:50:18,455
I don’t need my eyes to run a radio station.

1657
01:50:20,122 --> 01:50:22,747
You know one of the most beautiful
things about music?

1658
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:26,330
Even the blind can enjoy it.

1659
01:50:30,247 --> 01:50:31,622
But I guess Air Lilly

1660
01:50:32,539 --> 01:50:34,580
won’t accept blind pilots.

1661
01:50:36,872 --> 01:50:37,872
Iza don’t cry.

1662
01:50:40,622 --> 01:50:41,414
I am not crying.

1663
01:50:42,497 --> 01:50:45,789
One of the most beautiful memories
that I’ve seen with my eyes...

1664
01:50:48,664 --> 01:50:50,789
It also happened to be my last.

1665
01:50:54,539 --> 01:50:56,039
You telling me that you loved me.

1666
01:50:58,955 --> 01:51:00,372
remains a permanent memory.

1667
01:51:03,455 --> 01:51:09,789
So, this sympathy,empathy, pity...
I don’t like these things.

1668
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:10,414
I don’t want these things.

1669
01:51:11,247 --> 01:51:13,622
When those eyes have the same love for me as before...

1670
01:51:13,997 --> 01:51:15,289
Come and find me here.

1671
01:51:15,872 --> 01:51:16,497
Okay?

1672
01:51:18,914 --> 01:51:20,080
Bye, Iza.

1673
01:51:35,148 --> 01:51:35,815
Yamini...

1674
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:39,982
Why did you think I didn’t know the
value of Sacrifice?

1675
01:51:42,273 --> 01:51:45,315
I want to see the same love in your eyes again.

1676
01:51:47,107 --> 01:51:47,982
Please come back.

1677
01:52:04,232 --> 01:52:05,398
Why are you crying?

1678
01:52:07,107 --> 01:52:09,857
I am the one who is sad.
Why the hell are you crying?

1679
01:52:13,023 --> 01:52:14,482
I read the Yellandu Episode.

1680
01:52:15,898 --> 01:52:17,857
Since then, I am unable to control my tears.

1681
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,523
My father read it too.

1682
01:52:21,732 --> 01:52:22,982
Richa read it as well.

1683
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,232
They all got too emotional.

1684
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:27,482
I am really proud of you, man.

1685
01:52:28,732 --> 01:52:31,190
Here, dad asked me to give this to you.
-Why do I need this now?

1686
01:52:31,982 --> 01:52:36,232
Apparently, you writers internalize all the pain
from the world outside

1687
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:38,107
and put it into your words.

1688
01:52:38,773 --> 01:52:41,315
Drink, laugh, cry.

1689
01:52:41,982 --> 01:52:44,107
Just write.
Just go for it.

1690
01:52:44,107 --> 01:52:44,898
Just write.

1691
01:52:45,982 --> 01:52:47,398
This is your moment, man.

1692
01:52:48,023 --> 01:52:48,940
Go for it.

1693
01:52:49,523 --> 01:52:51,023
Buddy, take this.

1694
01:52:53,815 --> 01:52:55,440
What is this?
-This is my latest one.

1695
01:52:55,482 --> 01:52:56,107
Read it.

1696
01:52:57,148 --> 01:52:59,482
I have a small director’s meet.

1697
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:00,982
I will go home and read it.

1698
01:53:02,357 --> 01:53:02,940
Gautham,

1699
01:53:03,523 --> 01:53:05,065
Just call Yamini and tell her everything.

1700
01:53:05,273 --> 01:53:06,357
She will come back to you.

1701
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:07,357
Trust me.

1702
01:53:10,273 --> 01:53:11,148
Mr. Gautham.

1703
01:53:12,232 --> 01:53:13,440
Where is Gautham?

1704
01:53:13,898 --> 01:53:14,607
Didn’t he come?

1705
01:53:15,357 --> 01:53:15,982
No.

1706
01:53:18,273 --> 01:53:18,898
Yamini!

1707
01:53:23,523 --> 01:53:25,023
Gautham, what are you doing here?

1708
01:53:25,023 --> 01:53:27,023
Those placement companies are calling for you.

1709
01:53:27,107 --> 01:53:27,565
Come on

1710
01:53:29,523 --> 01:53:30,232
Yamini...

1711
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,648
my book got published.

1712
01:53:38,273 --> 01:53:39,440
My first copy is for you.

1713
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,648
Hey, congratulations.

1714
01:53:43,898 --> 01:53:45,273
Look who’s written the foreword.

1715
01:53:48,815 --> 01:53:51,690
Professor Srivastava. IIM, Bangalore.

1716
01:53:52,065 --> 01:53:53,232
This is amazing.

1717
01:53:53,523 --> 01:53:57,607
Yamini... Everyone has a hidden talent.

1718
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,898
I feel mine is writing.

1719
01:54:01,565 --> 01:54:05,232
I don’t want to be stuck in our jobs
and stop writing.

1720
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:08,648
That is the reason why I am not attending those placements.

1721
01:54:09,232 --> 01:54:10,857
Can I tell you something?

1722
01:54:12,482 --> 01:54:15,857
This book...
It’s about words and numbers, right?

1723
01:54:16,107 --> 01:54:16,648
Yes.

1724
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:21,440
24 seems to be God’s favourite number.

1725
01:54:21,898 --> 01:54:23,898
That is the reason why he gave us 24 hours in a day.

1726
01:54:24,815 --> 01:54:28,523
So, in those 24 hours, work for 8 hours.

1727
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:30,357
Sleep for 8 hours

1728
01:54:30,732 --> 01:54:31,690
And write for 8 hours.

1729
01:54:34,648 --> 01:54:37,982
Please don’t get offended by my suggestions.

1730
01:54:39,273 --> 01:54:43,357
If you had parents and told me that
you would write the whole day, I wouldn’t have stopped you.

1731
01:54:43,732 --> 01:54:47,482
But... an empty stomach will not let you write well, Gautham.

1732
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,440
If not for you...
For me?

1733
01:54:53,023 --> 01:54:54,607
Please attend the interview.

1734
01:54:54,898 --> 01:54:55,398
Alright.

1735
01:55:03,565 --> 01:55:05,273
Do you know why I’m attending the interview?

1736
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:06,982
Because I told you to?

1737
01:55:07,523 --> 01:55:08,023
No

1738
01:55:09,523 --> 01:55:11,023
Because you told me like my mother would.

1739
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:19,107
Father.

1740
01:55:20,190 --> 01:55:21,232
Hi, Yamini.

1741
01:55:22,065 --> 01:55:23,690
This is my friend, Gautham.

1742
01:55:24,232 --> 01:55:25,148
Hi, Gautham.

1743
01:55:25,273 --> 01:55:25,898
Hi,
Hi sir.

1744
01:55:32,148 --> 01:55:33,982
I am so proud of you.

1745
01:55:34,023 --> 01:55:34,732
Thanks dad

1746
01:55:35,107 --> 01:55:38,065
We have a big company of our own
and have so many properties.

1747
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:42,273
But, you opted to be a management trainee.

1748
01:55:42,815 --> 01:55:44,773
That is true professionalism.

1749
01:55:44,773 --> 01:55:47,148
Dad, Gautham got a good job as well.

1750
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:48,232
Congrats.

1751
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:51,148
What job?
-Assistant Vice president, Sales.

1752
01:55:51,648 --> 01:55:54,940
Which company?
-Global Turner Technologies.

1753
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:57,857
Actually, I worked in sales for two years.

1754
01:55:57,857 --> 01:56:00,232
So? Tell me, Yamini.

1755
01:56:00,398 --> 01:56:02,023
Where do you like to celebrate with your friends?

1756
01:56:02,398 --> 01:56:05,107
Five star? Seven star?
Destination Party?

1757
01:56:05,107 --> 01:56:06,482
No, dad. I don’t need all that.

1758
01:56:06,607 --> 01:56:10,357
I just brought Gautham with me to introduce him to you.

1759
01:56:10,523 --> 01:56:12,648
Yes. You did.

1760
01:56:12,773 --> 01:56:14,398
We already shook hands.

1761
01:56:14,398 --> 01:56:15,898
No, dad... like...

1762
01:56:16,648 --> 01:56:18,023
Introduce... Introduce?

1763
01:56:20,398 --> 01:56:23,107
Introduce... Introduce!

1764
01:56:25,565 --> 01:56:27,565
Do you know what I studied?

1765
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:28,898
No, sir.

1766
01:56:28,898 --> 01:56:29,732
But...

1767
01:56:32,065 --> 01:56:33,398
I am an ITI guy.

1768
01:56:34,107 --> 01:56:35,690
Do you know what ITI is?

1769
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:39,273
The kids of your generation might not know this.

1770
01:56:40,107 --> 01:56:41,232
It’s a Trade job.

1771
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:44,065
And my Trade was electrical.

1772
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:47,607
If someone’s bulb needed fixing

1773
01:56:47,648 --> 01:56:49,232
or the fan needed repairing,

1774
01:56:49,482 --> 01:56:51,273
or motor needed rewinding, I was the guy.

1775
01:56:52,773 --> 01:56:56,440
My passion for technology made me what I am today.

1776
01:56:57,732 --> 01:57:00,107
You are all very well educated.

1777
01:57:00,107 --> 01:57:01,357
You made it so big.

1778
01:57:01,482 --> 01:57:02,898
You are an MBA graduate.

1779
01:57:04,607 --> 01:57:07,857
If someone like me could do so much,

1780
01:57:08,398 --> 01:57:10,815
how much should people like you do?

1781
01:57:12,315 --> 01:57:14,065
You should search for a girl,

1782
01:57:14,523 --> 01:57:16,273
manage the girl,

1783
01:57:16,523 --> 01:57:18,148
get married to her

1784
01:57:18,148 --> 01:57:21,607
and take care of their wealth.

1785
01:57:21,607 --> 01:57:22,398
Right?

1786
01:57:22,815 --> 01:57:25,523
Dad, how can you talk this way?

1787
01:57:27,315 --> 01:57:29,482
You are not insulting Gautham.
You are insulting me.

1788
01:57:29,732 --> 01:57:30,648
You are hurting me.

1789
01:57:31,148 --> 01:57:33,565
No. No. I am not hurting. I am just talking.

1790
01:57:33,565 --> 01:57:34,607
Did I insult you?

1791
01:57:37,148 --> 01:57:38,773
I was speaking plainly.

1792
01:57:39,773 --> 01:57:43,898
What’s your opinion on our future?

1793
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:45,815
Future?

1794
01:57:46,398 --> 01:57:47,315
Whose future?

1795
01:57:48,023 --> 01:57:49,523
Mine and Gautham’s.

1796
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:50,648
Both of us.

1797
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,648
I don’t see any future.

1798
01:57:54,023 --> 01:57:55,232
It’s not happening.

1799
01:58:00,523 --> 01:58:01,398
Gautham...

1800
01:58:16,482 --> 01:58:18,232
I am so sorry, Gautham.

1801
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:23,440
I didn’t expect him to talk that way.

1802
01:58:24,065 --> 01:58:26,440
It’s ok.
What should we do now?

1803
01:58:31,273 --> 01:58:32,232
Two paths.

1804
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:36,440
One... Go and get married.

1805
01:58:39,482 --> 01:58:41,398
But... If we do that...

1806
01:58:42,148 --> 01:58:44,815
the media is going to write badly about my father.

1807
01:58:47,565 --> 01:58:51,315
I don’t want him to lose face because of me.

1808
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,773
I don’t want that as well.

1809
01:58:53,523 --> 01:58:54,523
Another way...

1810
01:58:57,648 --> 01:58:59,023
Live-in relationship.

1811
01:58:59,398 --> 01:59:00,690
Won’t the media have a field day with that?

1812
01:59:01,523 --> 01:59:04,148
Yes. They would but
it would be on page 3

1813
01:59:04,482 --> 01:59:07,690
And it would be about my dating life

1814
01:59:07,898 --> 01:59:09,690
and not so damaging to my father’s reputation.

1815
01:59:13,732 --> 01:59:14,898
Let’s live together, Gautham.

1816
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,482
Until dad agrees to get us married.

1817
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:19,857
What if he doesn’t?

1818
01:59:20,648 --> 01:59:22,857
Let’s just continue to be this way then.

1819
01:59:24,398 --> 01:59:25,982
If you are okay with this.
Then, so am I.

1820
02:00:22,148 --> 02:00:25,232
♫ Isn’t our story about love? ♫

1821
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:28,982
♫ Can’t you recall our story? ♫

1822
02:00:29,732 --> 02:00:32,898

02:00:48,065 --> 02:00:51,565

1837

1843
02:02:35,398 --> 02:02:36,648
Gautham?

1844
02:02:42,815 --> 02:02:44,565
I knew that you would come home.

1845
02:02:45,523 --> 02:02:49,232
Come.
Let’s not fight anymore.

1846
02:02:51,357 --> 02:02:53,273
Sit down. Come.

1847
02:02:55,357 --> 02:02:56,815
Yamini, I’ve changed.

1848
02:02:56,982 --> 02:02:59,273
You told me to put pen to paper.

1849
02:02:59,273 --> 02:03:01,107
I already began writing.

1850
02:03:01,482 --> 02:03:02,815
I love you, Yamini.

1851
02:03:03,148 --> 02:03:03,690
Gautham...

1852
02:03:04,148 --> 02:03:04,690
Gautham...

1853
02:03:05,315 --> 02:03:08,065
I will help you in cooking and all the housework too.

1854
02:03:08,065 --> 02:03:10,773
Yamini, you are the only family I have.

1855
02:03:11,148 --> 02:03:13,023
Please don't leave me alone

1856
02:03:14,107 --> 02:03:14,898
Gautham...

1857
02:03:15,565 --> 02:03:17,232
Gautham... I’m getting married.

1858
02:03:24,107 --> 02:03:25,732
I am getting married in three days.

1859
02:03:27,523 --> 02:03:30,398
I am giving you the auspicious first card
that’s offered to God.

1860
02:03:32,607 --> 02:03:35,398
And I don’t want you to think that I cheated on you.
Because I didn’t.

1861
02:03:37,398 --> 02:03:38,815
That’s the reason why I got it here myself.

1862
02:03:49,607 --> 02:03:51,023
I am so sorry, Gautham.

1863
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,440
You are not getting married to someone else.
This is not correct.

1864
02:03:58,565 --> 02:04:01,357
Go and ask your dad to cancel this wedding.
You are not getting married.

1865
02:04:02,315 --> 02:04:03,898
We tried Gautham.

1866
02:04:04,107 --> 02:04:07,482
But it didn’t work out.
Not all relationships work out.

1867
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:09,190
We’ve been in love for four years.

1868
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,273
We’ve been in this house for a year and a half.
How can you get married in three days?

1869
02:04:13,148 --> 02:04:14,107
Are you mad?

1870
02:04:15,648 --> 02:04:17,440
What is your problem now?
That I’m not writing?

1871
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,023
I am telling you that I am writing.

1872
02:04:19,107 --> 02:04:21,690
This is exactly what’s been happening
for a year and a half, Gautham.

1873
02:04:22,023 --> 02:04:23,190
I can’t take it anymore.

1874
02:04:23,190 --> 02:04:24,607
No, you are not getting married.

1875
02:04:25,648 --> 02:04:26,982
This wedding is not happening, Yamini.

1876
02:04:26,982 --> 02:04:27,940
I am getting married.

1877
02:04:28,482 --> 02:04:30,440
Yamini, please.
You are not getting married.

1878
02:04:30,732 --> 02:04:32,523
Yamini, please cancel this wedding.

1879
02:04:32,523 --> 02:04:33,482
Yamini please.

1880
02:04:33,482 --> 02:04:35,690
I’ll take care of you.
-Gautham, No!

1881
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:37,107
I’ve started writing.

1882
02:04:37,107 --> 02:04:40,773
Gautham, you have to understand it’s not working
and we have to move on.

1883
02:04:40,898 --> 02:04:43,107
Then GO!
GO!

1884
02:04:43,898 --> 02:04:45,148
Why did you come back here?

1885
02:04:46,065 --> 02:04:47,190
You left me, didn’t you?

1886
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:50,190
Why did you come here to tell me
that you are getting married?

1887
02:04:52,232 --> 02:04:54,107
You want me to be happy for you?

1888
02:04:55,398 --> 02:04:57,398
Do you want my blessings for your wedding?

1889
02:04:58,357 --> 02:05:00,398
Go and marry whoever you like.

1890
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,690
No.... No...

1891
02:05:09,357 --> 02:05:10,482
Yamini...

1892
02:05:11,815 --> 02:05:14,690
I did not just spread your legs, Yamini.

1893
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,898
I loved you.

1894
02:05:17,773 --> 02:05:19,773
I loved you, Yamini.

1895
02:05:34,982 --> 02:05:35,773
Yamini...

1896
02:05:38,398 --> 02:05:40,398
I am sorry Yamini.
I spoke nonsense in my anger.

1897
02:05:40,398 --> 02:05:41,023
Gautham...

1898
02:05:41,065 --> 02:05:41,982
I’ll join you.

1899
02:05:41,982 --> 02:05:42,732
Yamini...

1900
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:44,940
You want to talk to her, right?

1901
02:05:45,565 --> 02:05:46,857
Let’s behave like grownups.

1902
02:05:47,398 --> 02:05:48,898
Please, let’s go inside and talk.

1903
02:05:49,398 --> 02:05:49,857
Come.

1904
02:05:52,732 --> 02:05:55,523
When you guys were living together,
I never interfered.

1905
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:58,440
Yamini told me that she was done with you.

1906
02:05:58,732 --> 02:06:00,315
That is when I fixed her wedding.

1907
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:02,773
And you have no bloody right to barge in like this.

1908
02:06:04,107 --> 02:06:05,065
What is it now?

1909
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:07,982
You wish to speak to her, right?

1910
02:06:10,398 --> 02:06:10,857
Go.

1911
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:12,940
Talk.

1912
02:06:15,815 --> 02:06:16,440
Yamini...

1913
02:06:19,232 --> 02:06:21,523
I shouldn’t have behaved that way with you.

1914
02:06:24,107 --> 02:06:28,690
This morning, I spoke nonsense in my anger.
But I didn’t mean it Yamini.

1915
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:32,398
How can you marry a stranger?

1916
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,607
Alright, we fought.

1917
02:06:37,357 --> 02:06:41,065
But for all the good days, give me two hours.
I want to talk to you.

1918
02:06:43,023 --> 02:06:46,815
There will be fights after marriage as well.
Will you go and get a divorce then?

1919
02:06:48,107 --> 02:06:49,065
Yamini, please.

1920
02:06:49,482 --> 02:06:50,482
Talk to me.

1921
02:06:51,398 --> 02:06:53,023
I’ve started writing.

1922
02:06:53,732 --> 02:06:55,190
If you want, I’ll leave that as well.

1923
02:06:55,982 --> 02:06:57,357
I’ll do a 9 to 5 job.

1924
02:06:57,815 --> 02:06:59,690
I will be with you.
I will come with you to the office.

1925
02:07:00,148 --> 02:07:02,773
Yamini, we will sort this out.
Please, let’s go home.

1926
02:07:03,857 --> 02:07:04,690
I’m sorry, Gautham.

1927
02:07:05,232 --> 02:07:06,857
What do you mean sorry, Yamini?

1928
02:07:06,898 --> 02:07:07,690
Please leave me.

1929
02:07:07,690 --> 02:07:09,648
Yamini, come home.
We will sort it out.

1930
02:07:09,857 --> 02:07:11,232
No. No.
-Yamini...Yamini...

1931
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,607
We will sort it out.

1932
02:07:12,857 --> 02:07:13,440
Enough.

1933
02:07:14,648 --> 02:07:15,357
You are done.

1934
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:20,898
Uncle, you said something to me.
Do you remember...

1935
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:26,232
You told me that you are not that well educated
and yet you made an empire for yourself.

1936
02:07:28,523 --> 02:07:30,982
You know why?
Because you bloody loved money.

1937
02:07:31,523 --> 02:07:33,148
Not everybody loves money.

1938
02:07:33,565 --> 02:07:37,107
I loved you daughter.
I only... I only loved Yamini.

1939
02:07:38,398 --> 02:07:38,857
Is that so?

1940
02:07:40,232 --> 02:07:43,190
People should always get what they love.

1941
02:07:43,815 --> 02:07:44,815
Call your love.

1942
02:07:45,315 --> 02:07:46,440
If she comes to you, take her with you.

1943
02:07:48,273 --> 02:07:49,190
I won’t stop you guys.

1944
02:07:53,107 --> 02:07:54,023
Yamini!

1945
02:07:57,232 --> 02:07:58,065
Yamini!

1946
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,898
Yamini!

1947
02:08:26,565 --> 02:08:29,148
How unfortunate!
Did I damage your car?

1948
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,065
Let me fix that for you.

1949
02:10:03,690 --> 02:10:05,732
If the scar in my heart...

1950
02:10:07,523 --> 02:10:09,482
needs to forget the pain that it’s going through,

1951
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:13,190
physically, at the very least, I must bleed this much.

1952
02:10:16,398 --> 02:10:19,023
Now, I literally feel the pain.

1953
02:10:21,648 --> 02:10:22,523
So, what now?

1954
02:10:26,523 --> 02:10:27,773
Should we fight?

1955
02:10:30,773 --> 02:10:31,273
Come.

1956
02:11:20,523 --> 02:11:22,315
Brother... Stop it.
Leave him...

1957
02:11:23,023 --> 02:11:24,023
Leave me.

1958
02:11:26,482 --> 02:11:29,232
Hey, leave him... let him go.

1959
02:11:29,232 --> 02:11:31,773
Leave him... Leave him.

1960
02:11:32,648 --> 02:11:33,607
Leave him.

1961
02:11:34,898 --> 02:11:35,523
Leave him.

1962
02:11:38,523 --> 02:11:39,357
Leave him.

1963
02:11:40,482 --> 02:11:41,482
Leave him.

1964
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,648
Brother...
-Leave him.

1965
02:11:46,565 --> 02:11:47,648
Brother...
-Leave him alone.

1966
02:11:53,982 --> 02:11:54,773
Hit me.

1967
02:11:57,190 --> 02:11:58,190
Are they your friends?

1968
02:12:01,982 --> 02:12:03,523
At least you have them.

1969
02:12:06,857 --> 02:12:08,815
I don’t have anyone.

1970
02:12:23,523 --> 02:12:25,232
Do you think this is pain?

1971
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:31,273
I neither have a father nor a mother.

1972
02:12:36,232 --> 02:12:39,898
And the girl that I love...
is no longer with me.

1973
02:12:39,898 --> 02:12:40,565
No.

1974
02:12:42,857 --> 02:12:46,732
Even if I die now,
I have no one to cry for me.

1975
02:12:51,273 --> 02:12:53,690
How can you do this to me, Yamini?

1976
02:12:54,648 --> 02:12:57,565
I love you, Yamini.
I love you.

1977
02:12:59,898 --> 02:13:01,690
Come back to me, Yamini.

1978
02:13:05,225 --> 02:13:07,141
You are listening to Mirchi 98.3.
[Listening Radio]

1979
02:13:07,141 --> 02:13:08,183
It's hot...

1980
02:13:08,183 --> 02:13:09,433
And I am your host Bhargavi.

1981
02:13:09,808 --> 02:13:13,766
The author of the book ‘World Famous Lover’
is going to be released from prison today.

1982
02:13:14,016 --> 02:13:16,391
The unfinished story of Gautham and Yamini...

1983
02:13:16,391 --> 02:13:18,891
that was published, sold five million copies...

1984
02:13:18,975 --> 02:13:20,725
and created a sensation.

1985
02:13:20,808 --> 02:13:25,850
Gautham is going to discuss the ending of
his story amidst his fans and well-wishers.

1986
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:27,141
See you all in the evening.

1987
02:13:27,225 --> 02:13:29,308
Until then, listen to this beautiful song.

1988
02:13:29,308 --> 02:13:30,016
Stay tuned.

1989
02:13:30,016 --> 02:13:32,558
98.3 Mirchi.
It's hot

1990
02:13:46,933 --> 02:13:47,808
Gautham.

1991
02:13:48,850 --> 02:13:49,516
Let’s go.

1992
02:14:01,391 --> 02:14:01,891
Come.

1993
02:14:02,891 --> 02:14:05,141
Please, please hold on.

1994
02:14:06,016 --> 02:14:07,100
Please hold on.

1995
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:08,975
What are you doing?
Wave at them and smile.

1996
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,558
Excuse me. Please hold on.

1997
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:15,016
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1998
02:14:15,016 --> 02:14:16,183
Please move.

1999
02:14:16,516 --> 02:14:17,183
Please.

2000
02:14:17,308 --> 02:14:18,391
Get in... fast.

2001
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:22,183
We will send a press release. Hold on.
Please move.

2002
02:14:22,516 --> 02:14:23,141
Get in.

2003
02:14:30,683 --> 02:14:32,600
Welcome home, Gautham.

2004
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:35,016
Your books and laptop are there.

2005
02:14:35,016 --> 02:14:36,266
And your reviews...

2006
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:38,433
What are you doing there?
Come in.

2007
02:14:39,141 --> 02:14:40,350
Can we go to your house?

2008
02:14:40,891 --> 02:14:43,600
That is your house.
You can come and go whenever you please

2009
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:45,058
But that’s not the point.
I will tell you, come.

2010
02:14:45,516 --> 02:14:48,558
We have a press meet now.
And later, you have a signing event with your fans.

2011
02:14:48,558 --> 02:14:51,141
You will have to tell them the conclusion
of your book ‘World Famous Lover’.

2012
02:14:51,183 --> 02:14:52,725
There are a lot of things like that.
I will take care of them.

2013
02:14:52,725 --> 02:14:53,308
I’ll tell you.

2014
02:14:54,433 --> 02:14:55,058
Hello.

2015
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:00,308
Yamini... Are you among those days?

2016
02:15:01,475 --> 02:15:03,850
You stop noticing me, right?

2017
02:15:05,516 --> 02:15:10,225
If you don’t care of things
they fall into disrepair, Gautham.

2018
02:15:10,225 --> 02:15:11,433
I am a human.

2019
02:15:12,683 --> 02:15:15,433
Apart from having a life,
I have a heart too.

2020
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:19,016
I can’t take this pain anymore, Gautham.

2021
02:15:19,308 --> 02:15:21,766
Let's break up Gautham.

2022
02:15:22,558 --> 02:15:23,850
Gautham I am getting married.

2023
02:15:24,141 --> 02:15:25,600
Gautham I am getting married.

2024
02:15:25,641 --> 02:15:26,183
Gautham.

2025
02:15:27,766 --> 02:15:28,808
What are you thinking?

2026
02:15:31,475 --> 02:15:35,100
After I read that book,
I understood something.

2027
02:15:36,266 --> 02:15:37,725
Our elders always say...

2028
02:15:38,016 --> 02:15:41,016
"Everything that happens is for our greater good."

2029
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:43,141
Perhaps, this is the greater good.

2030
02:15:43,516 --> 02:15:46,808
If those things did not happen to you,
you wouldn’t have written this book.

2031
02:15:49,766 --> 02:15:51,266
Maybe you wouldn’t have been this successful.

2032
02:15:51,683 --> 02:15:53,683
Buddy, you don’t understand how lucky you are.

2033
02:15:54,058 --> 02:15:56,225
Even after you hit that person with a stone,
he survived.

2034
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:59,225
You got out of the prison in two years.

2035
02:16:00,516 --> 02:16:05,225
Tell me of any book in the world that has
sold 5 million copies without a conclusion?

2036
02:16:07,516 --> 02:16:08,975
Listen to me Gautham.

2037
02:16:10,183 --> 02:16:10,766
Please.

2038
02:16:11,808 --> 02:16:15,266
Give that book a climax
and begin a new chapter in your life.

2039
02:16:17,058 --> 02:16:19,516
The world is waiting for its world-famous lover.

2040
02:16:22,558 --> 02:16:23,183
Come on. Let’s go.

2041
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:33,641
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

2042
02:16:36,475 --> 02:16:38,975
I think, it’s the first time in India...

2043
02:16:38,975 --> 02:16:41,016
that an author and his work got such recognition.

2044
02:16:41,641 --> 02:16:42,933
Thank you so much.

2045
02:16:44,891 --> 02:16:45,683
I read somewhere that...

2046
02:16:47,183 --> 02:16:51,058
a life without meaning and a book without
ending are both useless.

2047
02:16:51,766 --> 02:16:53,016
But that’s not true in this case.

2048
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:54,558
Sorry, Gautham.

2049
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:59,641
We published this book without
your permission, through CC publishers.

2050
02:16:59,975 --> 02:17:03,183
I think it’s because of our friendship...

2051
02:17:03,558 --> 02:17:06,350
Or because of the motivation I felt
after reading this book,

2052
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:09,475
Is what made me publish this book.

2053
02:17:10,141 --> 02:17:13,391
Without any further delay,
I invite my brother

2054
02:17:14,308 --> 02:17:16,225
The 'world famous lover' himself...

2055
02:17:17,391 --> 02:17:18,141
Gautham!

2056
02:17:41,433 --> 02:17:43,183
With so much enthusiasm...

2057
02:17:46,683 --> 02:17:49,808
you’ve been eagerly waiting to listen to end of the story...

2058
02:17:49,808 --> 02:17:51,391
We love you, Gautham!

2059
02:17:54,766 --> 02:17:56,475
What happened to Yamini and Gautham?

2060
02:18:01,058 --> 02:18:02,766
After Gautham came out of the jail,

2061
02:18:05,308 --> 02:18:09,391
Yamini awaited Gautham
with all her heart and tears in her eyes.

2062
02:18:12,725 --> 02:18:14,350
Even after two years,
she didn’t get married.

2063
02:18:18,725 --> 02:18:21,475
This can be written as the climax of a story you read in book.

2064
02:18:23,516 --> 02:18:24,850
But this is not a book.

2065
02:18:26,391 --> 02:18:27,433
This is my life.

2066
02:18:29,391 --> 02:18:33,308
The story of Yamini and Gautham that you guys read
in the book ‘World Famous Lover’,

2067
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,516
is our story.

2068
02:18:38,975 --> 02:18:41,600
And In real life, no one waits.

2069
02:18:43,433 --> 02:18:45,683
We have to live with our mistakes.

2070
02:18:47,683 --> 02:18:50,475
In life, there is no backspace button like in computers.

2071
02:18:51,975 --> 02:18:54,891
You cannot delete the things you don’t like
and rewrite them.

2072
02:18:57,558 --> 02:18:59,516
Yamini is my only family.

2073
02:19:03,891 --> 02:19:08,766
I spent most time with her compared to my parents

2074
02:19:11,225 --> 02:19:12,891
When I wanted to be a writer,

2075
02:19:15,225 --> 02:19:16,225
she supported me.

2076
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:21,016
Can you support me for a year?

2077
02:19:28,766 --> 02:19:31,391
She was with me when I was struggling to write.

2078
02:19:32,516 --> 02:19:35,391
She was with me when I was writing this book.

2079
02:19:35,891 --> 02:19:37,641
But now, as I stand before you.

2080
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:41,433
she is not with me.

2081
02:19:42,016 --> 02:19:46,558
She is with her own family somewhere.

2082
02:19:49,141 --> 02:19:50,141
I miss her.

2083
02:20:01,808 --> 02:20:05,183
When I think about it, I don’t know about the book.
But in life, I am a failure.

2084
02:20:06,850 --> 02:20:12,266
I failed to understand the one person
who was with me every step of my way.

2085
02:20:13,891 --> 02:20:17,100
I thought I made a huge sacrifice
when I let go of my job.

2086
02:20:18,725 --> 02:20:22,391
I felt that she didn’t understand me
even though I compromised a lot.

2087
02:20:28,058 --> 02:20:30,308
When I wrote Srinu and Suvarna’s story...

2088
02:20:31,266 --> 02:20:34,433
remember Srinu left Smitha behind and returned to his wife.

2089
02:20:34,683 --> 02:20:37,016
I thought Srinu compromised a lot.

2090
02:20:40,225 --> 02:20:42,808
I thought that the compromise in that story
came from the writer in me.

2091
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,183
Srinu wasn’t the one who was compromising.

2092
02:20:50,391 --> 02:20:51,475
It was Suvarna.

2093
02:20:53,641 --> 02:20:55,766
I was not the one who compromised.

2094
02:20:56,141 --> 02:20:57,141
It was Yamini.

2095
02:21:00,058 --> 02:21:05,141
In the Paris story, when Gautham sacrificed his eyes for Iza,
I thought that, the sacrifice came from me.

2096
02:21:12,641 --> 02:21:15,516
The sacrifice that Gautham made
in Paris did not come from me.

2097
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,641
It came from Yamini.

2098
02:21:22,433 --> 02:21:24,975
Yamini left her home and family.

2099
02:21:26,016 --> 02:21:29,141
She left them behind because of her love for me.

2100
02:21:30,016 --> 02:21:33,808
I stopped loving her the way I used to,
when we first met.

2101
02:21:33,808 --> 02:21:35,475
She looked after me like a mother would.

2102
02:21:38,391 --> 02:21:39,600
And then one day,

2103
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:42,016
it became too late.

2104
02:21:44,766 --> 02:21:46,100
All the stories that I’ve written,

2105
02:21:47,516 --> 02:21:48,975
the characters in them,

2106
02:21:49,975 --> 02:21:53,600
All the compromise, sacrifice and the divinity in love,

2107
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,391
that the characters show, came from
the life that I spent with Yamini.

2108
02:21:58,183 --> 02:22:01,433
The title ‘World Famous Lover’ for this book,
isn’t for me.

2109
02:22:02,558 --> 02:22:03,516
It’s Yamini’s.

2110
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:06,183
My 'world famous lover' is...

2111
02:22:08,516 --> 02:22:09,350
Yamini.

2112
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:11,600
The only desire I have is that...

2113
02:22:13,641 --> 02:22:15,725
wherever she is, she stays happy.

2114
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:17,558
Thank you

2115
02:22:41,683 --> 02:22:42,850
Hi, Gautham.

2116
02:22:47,725 --> 02:22:49,058
You were right.

2117
02:22:50,641 --> 02:22:51,975
I loved money.

2118
02:22:52,433 --> 02:22:53,558
No regrets.

2119
02:22:55,891 --> 02:23:02,308
In my blind ambition to earn money,
I didn’t take care of my wife’s health.

2120
02:23:03,266 --> 02:23:04,225
She died.

2121
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:09,141
And I deserve that pain.

2122
02:23:10,558 --> 02:23:14,016
But, the pain that you guys give me,
Is not what I deserve.

2123
02:23:15,766 --> 02:23:20,266
I didn’t come here to tell you
that I’ve changed or that I understand your choices.

2124
02:23:20,641 --> 02:23:24,058
I came here to ask you
to distance me from this pain.

2125
02:23:26,391 --> 02:23:28,808
As soon as she found out that you were in Jail,

2126
02:23:30,183 --> 02:23:32,808
she called off her wedding.

2127
02:23:34,433 --> 02:23:38,683
She was sure she wouldn’t be happy
with you in jail.

2128
02:23:39,141 --> 02:23:42,266
And so, she confined herself at home
for two whole years.

2129
02:23:42,975 --> 02:23:45,475
She spent those two years
in desolation.

2130
02:23:47,391 --> 02:23:51,766
Even though she didn’t commit the crime,
she subjected herself to punishment along with you.

2131
02:23:53,516 --> 02:23:57,350
My daughter did not even have the
courage to meet you.

2132
02:23:57,933 --> 02:23:59,016
What did you say?

2133
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,725
You want her to be happy wherever she is?

2134
02:24:03,016 --> 02:24:04,558
How could you wish for something like that?

2135
02:24:05,433 --> 02:24:07,975
She can never be happy.

2136
02:24:09,808 --> 02:24:11,183
Leave me alone.

2137
02:24:11,933 --> 02:24:13,350
Just leave me alone.

2138
02:25:16,766 --> 02:25:17,891
Sorry Yamini.

2139
02:25:19,141 --> 02:25:26,350
I want to erase all the pain that I’ve given you
and rewrite it with love.

2140
02:25:32,183 --> 02:25:33,475
Do you know the way home?

2141
02:25:34,683 --> 02:25:35,391
Gautham

2142
02:25:39,516 --> 02:25:40,683
Let’s go home.
