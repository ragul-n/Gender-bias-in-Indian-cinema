32
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,639
We were just about to ask you that.

33
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:24,807
He didn't even come to school today.

00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:26,682

Okay fine. - I am coming.

38
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,698
I don't know where Pappu has gone.

39
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,002
Subhadra don't worry.

40
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,627
Pappu will come.

41
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,606
He has run off from home before as well.

42
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,438

will come and stand before you now.

43
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,943
He is very wise.

44
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,574
Pappu.

God knows what state
he is in now. Where is he?

47
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,351
I am unable to connect a call to Pratap.

48
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,293
He will come.

49
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,419
He will come.

50
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,524
Brother, tell herto eat something.

51
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,900
Pappu is not going to come
just because she has given up food.

52
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,009
Aunt?

53
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,310
Please don't cry.

54
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:09,616
Pappu will come.

55
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:20,696
I prayed last night to God.

56
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,965
Pappu shall come home soon.

57
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,958
Hey why are you crying?

58
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:57,628
Have you lost yourway?

59
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:01,466
Where are your parents?

60
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:05,941
Gawde, the child doesn't
look as if he is from Mumbai.

61
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,541
All the kids run and
come to Mumbai it seems.

62
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,249
What?

63
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,713
Now come to police station.

00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:16,580
Come.

66
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:17,748
Come. - Come.

67
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,586
Come. - Don't know from
where they come to Mumbai.

68
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,953
Again a new trouble.

69
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,257
Tell me your name.

70
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,456
Tell me your name or else..

71
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,893
What is it Gawde?

72
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,525
Why are you creating a ruckus?

73
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,693
Bring him here.

74
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,293
Come and stand in front of sir.

75
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,598
Sir he was roaming on the streets.

76
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,775
And he was crying.
So I brought him here.

00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:42,740
Rishabh Sharma.

82
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,040
Father's name?

83
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,581
Chotulal Sharma.

84
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,552
From where have you come? - Nainital.

85
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,086
Why have you come
from Nainital to Mumbai?

86
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,388
Uncle I have a friend. Kuhu.

87
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,586
I go to her house to watch T.V.

88
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,058
On the T.V I saw the city.

89
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:01,597
Big buildings, long cars and aeroplanes.

90
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,869
I like these very much.

91
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,734
That's why I ran and came here.

92
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,466
you saw an aeroplane and came to Mumbai?

93
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,740
your parents must be worried.

94
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,336
When I shall go home and
tell my friends about it they..

95
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,471
..shall be overjoyed.

96
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,778
Son running away from home is very bad.

97
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:19,509
I hope you won't do that again.

98
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,054
No sir. - Gawde? Give him your address.

99
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,314
Go.

100
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,520
What did you eat sir?

101
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:28,652
Air.

102
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,320
Air has that effect on me.

103
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:33,890
Hello?

104
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:35,900

105
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,766
My health is itself failing me here.

106
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,872
How shall I take
insurance? Pat me on the back.

107
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:44,937
Munni has become disreputable..

108
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,444

00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:48,605

Can you understand?

127
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,328
Acidity.

128
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,693
Make a drink for me.

129
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,969
What drink? - Give him sacred water.

130
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:46,301

136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,985
I have to repair it.

137
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,694
Now you stop this habit of sulking.

138
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,523
Make a habit of it.

139
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,394

148
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,631
What kind of joke is this? What is

149
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,896
Chotulal? - Chotulal?

..home on an impulse?

156

All the kids play together.

00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,383
And study together.

160
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,892
What if your son's
behaviour influences them?

161
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,360
Who will be responsible for it?

162
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:17,657

168
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:37,907
Pappu?

169
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:40,942
From where did you
get this? Throw this away.

170
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:42,814
Come here.

171
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,357
What are you doing? Leave
him. Leave him? will you run?

172
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,517
He is a child. -Achild?

173
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,818
He has ruined my name in this village.

174
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,553
He won't do so in
future. - Leave. Get away.

175
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,427
Don't hit Pappu uncle.

176
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:53,829
He is very nice.

177
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,367
Now he won't run away again.

178
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,967
you won't, will you Pappu?

179
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,563
No.

180
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:05,602
See uncle he won't run away.

181
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,742
He is very wise.

182
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,314
He tells us stories about big cities.

183
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,677
Right Pappu?

184
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,812
Go away.

185
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,815
All of you go away.

186
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,624
Come let's go Kuhu.

187
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,487
Come here. no.

188
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,087
you don't come in between. Move back.

189
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,863
I shall see you.

190
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,094
Go in. Go in.

191
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,031
Please don't do this.

192
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:34,334
Please don't do this.

193
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,067
And don't you dare open the door.

194
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,706
you have exhausted my patience.

195
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,917
This doll is so nice.

196
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,350
Isn't it?

197
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,023
yes it is.

198
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,718
Just like you.

199
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,718
Here.

200
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,553
This doll was given to me by Pappu.

201
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,857
He found it in a fair. - Really?

202
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:06,701
When Pappu is not here
this doll becomes my friend.

203
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,808
Then this time too Pappu
must have brought something for you.

204
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,504
Maybe.

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,442
What?

206
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:19,981
He is hungry since morning.

207
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,085
Let him have his dinner at least.

208
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,890
your love and affection has spoilt him.

209
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,755
Do you know how people
are snickering because of him?

210
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,325
Don't be bitter please.

211
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,024
He is our own child.

212
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,492
He is young now.

213
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,967
He will learn slowly.

214
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:39,464
I will come.

215
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,771
Pappu?

216
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,507
Pappu?

217
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,349
What happened?

218
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,647
What did you drop?

219
00:12:58,858 --> 00:12:59,950
What happened?

220
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:01,951
Pappu..

221
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:03,654
Again..

222
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,727
He is my best friend.

223
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,531
When he isn't here I don't feel nice.

224
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,435
How is Parimal?

225
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,371
Father is fine uncle.

226
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,773
See children.

227
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:28,410
Those kids are good
who obey their parents.

228
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:31,049
Like you obey your parents.

229
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,858
But Pappu?

230
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:36,957
Pappu is a very bad child.

231
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:39,889
He doesn't obey his parents at all.

232
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,625
Truly.

233
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,333
you know what I think?

234
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,802
Kuhu and you should not play with him.

235
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:51,569
No father. you don't know.

236
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,802
Pappu is a very nice boy.

237
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,743
He is wiserthan any other kid.

238
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,613
He helps everyone.

239
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,012
Who is there at this time in the night?

240
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:05,489
you wait. I will see.

241
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,384
Coming.

242
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,555
Will you break the door orwhat?

243
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,527
you? At this time?

244
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,525
What do you want son?

245
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,536
Uncle I want to meet Kuhu.

246
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,798
It's too late now.

247
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,475
It's nine in the night.

248
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,907
Go now. - She is waiting for me.

249
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,503
I will tell her
some stories about Mumbai.

250
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,883
Can't you understand what I said?

251
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,751
I told you once that
it's too late, didn't I?

252
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,385
Now get lost.

253
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,315
And as it is you have caused
enough trouble for your parents.

254
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:41,684
Understood?

255
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,290
A minute please.

Pappu it's very late now.

257
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,592
your parents must be worried.

258
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,297
Go now.

259
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,835
Don't think him a naive child.

260
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,031
He is very clever.

261
00:14:58,678 --> 00:14:59,770
Pappu?

262
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,841
Pappu?

263
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,311
Please stop the car.

This is Chotulal's son.

265
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,077

266
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,020

00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,241
yourfather is right.

410
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:05,442
you can't be reformed.

411
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:08,884
yesterday I told you so many
times to be punctual, didn't I?

412
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:10,380
Didn't I?

413
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:13,354
Now go and kneel outside. Go.

414
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,294
Rajiv.

415
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,374
Correct.

416
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,871
note this down.

417
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:35,710
Come children let's make our boats.

418
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,579
okay?

419
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,345
yeah!

420
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,854
Get up.

421
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:53,523
And listen.

422
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,561
Come to school on time tomorrow.

423
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:56,692
Understood?

424
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,929
Otherwise I shall make
you kneel the entire day.

425
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:01,405
Master? Master?

426
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:02,665
Come here.

427
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:03,867
Why are you saying
master again and again?

428
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,277
I wanted to ask you something. -Ask.

429
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,413
Where is the biggest
railway line in this world?

430
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,046
Is that what you were
thinking off while kneeling down?

431
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:17,917
Transylvania railway.

432
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,316
How much time does it take
to reach from the first station..

433
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:23,827
..to the last station?

434
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,621
12 days.

435
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:26,959
12 days?

436
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,457
Then what do they eat in the train?

437
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,434
you wouldn't get
bread and vegetables there.

438
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:32,697
Do one thing.

439
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,031
Go to Siberia.

440
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:35,638
Sit in the train for 12 days.

441
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,766
And note down everything.
And then come and tell me also.

442
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:39,003
Don't chew my brains now.

443
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,306
Questions. Questions. Questions.

444
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,677
Always asking questions.

445
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:44,545
Never comes on time.

446
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:45,808
Master? - Hey!

447
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:49,653
Pick up your bags and leave from here.

448
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,017
Go. Go children.

449
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,382
Hey first bags.

450
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:57,692
All of you have become mischievous.

451
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:01,626
From where do these kids come?

452
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:03,862
I hope no one saw..

453
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,332
I will see to you now..

454
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:12,410
you didn't tell us about the city.

455
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,374
Do tell us what you saw.

456
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:15,970
yes Pappu tell us.

457
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:18,340
yes Pappu tell us.

458
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,915
The city was wonderful.

459
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,583
Tall buildings.

460
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:26,982
As master says huge.

461
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,452
Even the Qutub Minar
is nothing in front of it.

462
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:30,756
What are you saying?

463
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,662
I thought that
buildings look huge only in movies.

464
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,060
It's nothing like in movies.

465
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,893
And how do they climb up in them?

466
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,062
Not by stairs.

467
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:40,703
They have glass houses to do so.

468
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,000
Lifts. That's it.

469
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:45,510
It takes them up easily.

470
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:47,076
On its own.

471
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:49,010
Like a swing.

472
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:52,312
yes. An air conditioned swing.

473
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:53,948
Wow!

474
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,651
And did you see India gate?

475
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:56,945
India gate?

476
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,819
India gate is in Delhi.

477
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,222
Gateway of India is in Mumbai.

478
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:05,862
If you stand there
you can see the vast oceans.

479
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,728
Oceans? yes.

480
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,427
But only in map it is shown as blue.

481
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:14,704
The ocean water
looks like water in ponds.

482
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,775
And in them you can
see big and small boats.

483
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,308
Some so big.

484
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,903
And some so small.

485
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:25,281
In the cities trains run.

486
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,714
Lot off them.

487
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,811
you do not need to sleep there in night.

488
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:34,753
There at night time
colourful lights shimmer.

489
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,919
It must be very beautiful.

490
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:40,259
yes. - I feel as if
I should fly there now.

491
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:41,890
It's not so easy.

492
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,435
you require a lot of courage forthat.

493
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:45,995
Come let's go home.

494
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,561
Let's go.come Kuhu. [chanting]

495

00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,343
Munni has become disreputable.. - Hello.

500
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:30,608
..for you my darling.

501
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,047
Hello.

502
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,577

503
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,617
I am trapped.

504
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,624
I am just coming.

505
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:46,961
I can't find my stick.

506
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,591
I am just coming. you go.

507
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,269

Where are you going? yes?

509
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:57,534
And this hand? this hand?

510
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:58,701
What is this hand doing here?

511
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,968
What are you doing?

512
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:02,311
I am looking for something.

513
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,540
What?

514
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,742
What are you looking for? A needle?

515
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:07,580
My stick.

516
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:08,878
Stick.

517
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,054
you are looking for a stick?

518
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,382
What will a stick be
underthe sofa for? Stupid?

519
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,652
Then where will it be?

520
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,392
Where will it be?

521
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,723
Monu was playing with
your stick in the morning.

522
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:20,890
Monu?

523
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,634
Start marching.

524
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,533
Left right left.

525
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,401
Left right left.

526
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:29,465
That dog? Come here.

527
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,732

528
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,835

00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:36,380
No I am.. - He has
gone to play with his friends.

530
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:37,608
Go and search for him there.

531
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,347
Sleep. Sleep.

532
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,611
If you let me do so then I shall.

533
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,653

What are you doing on the tree monu?

553
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:23,893
Have you gone mad?

554
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,395
The kids nowadays..

555
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,760
you should be at home..

556
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:28,090
What are you doing here?

557
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,493
Where is Monu?

558
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:30,762
Monu?

559
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:33,466
What are you doing here?

560
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:34,899
We have taken the house on rent.

561
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,099
And you are hanging on the trees.

562
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:38,036
Are you a monkey? What
sort of behaviour is this?

563
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,906
you took away a
pressure cookerfrom the house.

564
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,344
you should have took away
your mother and put her up there.

565
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:45,414
Instead you take my cap and stick.

566
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,314
What else have you taken?

567
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,683

573
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,825

No we won't. We won't.

581
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:19,644
Hello? Monu is my son..

582
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,016
Whether I hit him or
not it depends on me.. Okay?

583
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,487
Monu you come down. Right now.

584
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:26,547

Just imagine that
your circus has started.

589
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,759
Hello?

590
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,531

593
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,835
Of course.

594
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:47,675
Sorry. Sorry.

595
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:50,943
Monu just because of you
I scolded my boss in English.

596
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:52,677
Come down. Please. Please.

597
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,579
Uncle we have one last demand?

598
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,118
Last one? Say.

599
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,387
That you won't take anyone's parade.

600
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:03,416
Look son I nevertake anyone's parade.

601
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,256
If a thief comes, or a criminal..

602
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:08,856
..or Qasab himself I
won't take his parade..

603
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:12,391
But instead spread out the
red carpet and ask him for a drink.

604
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,767
Or something to eat. Samosa?

605
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,465
Samosa should be hot.

606
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,632
Sure.

607
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:17,899
Go.

608
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,308
Bring my stick fast.

609
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,676
Fast. - Here father. Here.

610
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:33,548
[singing]

611
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,884
The weather is so colourful
that anybody can become cheerful.

612
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:39,987
For keeping the weather clean
you have to keep your stomach clean.

613
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,327
Sir? I love you.

614
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:42,491
Greetings. - Greetings.

615
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:45,595
Greetings. I love you. Very nice.

616
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,938
This salute should
have been made two hours back.

617
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,940
Where were you? - Sir
it's raining in the mountains..

618
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,100
..and the rocky path..

619
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:52,867
..and the traffic.. - ..and tension..

620
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:54,468
Are you new here?

621
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,005
What is your name?

622
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,606
Sir my name is P. Singh.

623
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,279
Are you a police or a thief?

624
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:04,585
Pratap Singh.

625
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:05,748
Do you have a terrace at your home?

626
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,348
yes. My wife dries the pickles there.

627
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,985
Along with the
pickles dry the scarf as well.

628
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,856
Looking at you it doesn't
seem as if you respect your body.

629
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:15,732
At least respect your uniform.

630
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,557
Close the buttons.

631
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:20,069
And tuck this shirt in else I
will have to do it. Friend do it.

632
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,397
yes sir.

633
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:22,531
And this moustache?

634
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,034
Why don't you dye it black?

635
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,936
Sir if I dye my
moustache my face gets blackened.

636
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,773
A policeman roaming with
blackened face in the city ..

637
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:28,904
.. doesn't seem good.

638
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,641
Looking at you it feels
as if you are blackening..

639
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,807
.. the name of the police force.

640
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,509
Come.

641
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,318
What was he saying?

642
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:37,446
Let's go.

643
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,717

At that time it was called Soviet Union.

647
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,328
What was it called?

648
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,766

All of them have adorted the
teachings of that great Leader.

653
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:02,939
Because these teachings
are the essence of humanity.

00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:05,949
What is it? - Essence of humanity.

655
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:07,848
And who is that
great leader? Do you know?

656

00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:34,943
Master. Master. -yes say.

668
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,574
Barrack Hussain Obama.

669
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:39,640
That's correct. He is the
most brilliant child of our class.

00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,684
No.

675
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,658
Okay so you want to know about Jalwahi?

676
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,826
No. There the women are
scantily dressed that's why.

677
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,431
From where do you learn all this?

678
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:03,906
Now the time is over.

679
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,743
Tomorrow I shall
show you where it's hot..

680
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,841
..and when it's cold in America.

681
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:15,644
you have become mischievous.

682
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:17,648
Concentrate on your home work.

683
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,488
Hey Ram. - How did

688
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,423
Oh God!

689
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:57,322
Where is Pappu?

690
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,358
He was here a moment back.

691
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,497
He must have finished
his studies and gone out.

692
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:03,865
you check out the garden.

693
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:05,560

697
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,544

How shall I show them to you Kuhu?

700
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:32,660
One day you shall be
able to see the stars for sure.

When you study then you
shall grow up to be a successful man.

711
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,827
Or you shall become
an ordinary vendor like me.

Go.

721
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:52,464
Sir you could have asked me to sit.

722
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,831

00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:14,951
..feeding them cold juices.

732
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,324
It's all the
blessings of goddess. - Goddess?

733
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:18,794
Do give a thought to us poor people.

734
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:22,856

756
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,070

you are a poor man
and you make us drink urine.

760
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:17,817
When you become rich you
shall serve latrine on platter.

761
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,754
No sahib -you think it's a joke?

762
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:23,453
Sahib?

764
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:27,626
See he has earned
this much from selling urine.

765
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,632
Who will take this one out?

766
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,997

767
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,536
Keep this. - Sir I am a poor man.

768
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:34,798
I have a small son.

769
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:35,998
Shut up.

770
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:39,533
How is it?

771
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,872
Good.

772
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:42,340
Come.

773
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:50,952
Mummy? - What is this?

774
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,782
What happened? you step in home
and start hitting the child. - Mummy!

775
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:54,983
What happened?

776
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,050
He has ruined my trade Sumitra.

777
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:58,621
Ruined my trade.

778
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,323
I would have been
smashed blue and black today.

779
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,558
What? God shouldn't curse
any one with such a scoundrel son.

780
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:03,929
Don't speak like that.

781
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,062
What did you do?

782
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:07,464
Nothing.

783
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,071
See? He has done nothing.

784
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:10,774
you are.. - Nothing?

785
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,971
If he has done nothing then
ask him who peed in the bottle.

786
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,570
I did pee.

787
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,978
But it's not what you think.

788
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,840
This bottle was kert in a corner.

789
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:21,474
So how did it come on my cart?

790
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:26,080
I..

791
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:27,916
Kert that bottle..

792
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,359
you?

793
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,558
Means you can't understand the
difference between a drink and urine?

794
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,865
Oh my God!

795
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,574
I don't know what I
served the people the entire day.

796
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:47,408
If they fall ill then I shall be jailed.

797
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,036
I can't continue with my trade.

798
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,980
Nothing will happen father.

799
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:52,507
Really?

800
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:54,442
How come?

801
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:58,010
On the T.V I have seen that
people use urine for medicines.

802
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,118
Oh my son! See.

803
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,451

00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:08,528
He is a small child

Stay in.

808
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:12,359
Kneel.

809
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:14,000
And stay like this the entire day.

810
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:15,863
you go in. Get inside.

811
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,066
It's so hot.

Monu let's take Pappu and leave. Come.

813
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,810

814
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,610
Come fast. - Fast.

816
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,315
What is going on here? - Come.

817
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:29,778
Down. Kneel.

818
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:31,646
Hold your ears.

819
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:37,794
Uncle caste away your anger
and let Pappu play Kabaddi with us.

820
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,894
yes. Please. - Why are you smiling?

821
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:42,090
yes please forgive Pappu.

822
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:47,096
Uncle if you don't forgive
Pappu then we shall also kneel down.

823
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:48,669
yes.

824
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:51,068
Oh Lord!

825
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:53,936
What? Get up.

826
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:55,511
Get up.

827
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,581
Now you won't do any mischief? - No.

828
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:01,243
If you make any mischief then
I shall spank yourfriends as well.

829
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:02,377
Now go.

830
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,351
Uncle you also come.

831
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:05,855

832
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,685
No. you also come.

Okay.

834
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,420
Ready.

835
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:16,596
From that side.

836
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:20,597
Out.

837
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:26,701
Hey look here.

838
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:30,873
This boy is cross eyed. He looks
in one direction and moves in other.

839
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:32,674
Hey look Here.

840
00:44:34,585 --> 00:44:35,779
Out.

841
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:44,789
Out.

842
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,591
Kabaddi.

843
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,692
Kabaddi.

844
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:55,667
Kabaddi.

845
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:59,701
Wait.

846
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,434
Come.

847
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,675
That's cheating.

848
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,684
Out.

849
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:19,989

850
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,037
Pappu!

851
00:45:57,468 --> 00:45:58,901

852
00:45:59,437 --> 00:46:00,597
We won!

853
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:58,520
What is wrong Kuhu?

854
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,962
Why are you sitting here so morosely?

855
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,363
Nothing. Just like that.

856
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:05,702
Please tell me. I
know something is wrong.

857
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:07,361
Please tell me Kuhu.

858
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:09,939
All this is so beautiful, isn't it?

859
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:11,440
What is?

860
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,877
All this which you play.

861
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:15,878
you can do all that you want.

862
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,937
All that you wish.

863
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,676
But I..

864
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:22,910
Kuhu why do you think so?

865
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,953
I am yourfriend, aren't I?

866
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:27,616
I tell you everything, don't I?

867
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,324
yes Pappu.

868
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:31,452
you are my best friend.

869
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,287
And us?

870
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:34,831
yes you all also.

871
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:36,366
Then come we all shall go to play.

872
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:37,730
Ok. - Come.

873
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:52,374
you know Kuhu?

874
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:56,647
4-5 people are
flying in the sky. Like birds.

875
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,482
With colourful parachutes.

876
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:01,952
What is this called?

877
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:05,692
''P'' ''A'' ''R'' ''A'' paragliding?

878
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:07,424
People are flying?

879
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,898
yes. Many of them.

880
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,265
It means that if you
have parachute then a man can..

881
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:13,667
..become a bird?

882
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:15,728
yes it seems so.

883
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:18,671
But what is a parachute?

884
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,742
A big umbrella.

885
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:24,303
With strong threads.

886
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:26,745
The people fly with their help.

887
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,978
It must be fun.

888
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:31,481
Can we fly as well?

889
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:33,284
yes. Let me show you.

890
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:37,416
If you have a
parachute then you can fly.

891
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:38,994
Like this.

892
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,254
Like this.

893
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:42,526
Enjoying this?

894
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:46,034
yes. But where do
you get parachutes from?

895
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,335
you find them in Mumbai.

896
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:05,749
What is wrong Kuhu?

897
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:08,417
Why are you sitting here so morosely?

898
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,687
Nothing. Just like that.

899
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:12,862
Please tell me. I
know something is wrong.

900
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,693
Please tell me Kuhu.

901
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,300
All this is so beautiful, isn't it?

902
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:18,699
What is?

903
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:21,701
All this which you play.

904
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:24,371
you can do all that you want.

905
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,369
All that you wish.

906
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:27,876
But I..

907
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:35,979
What is the matter
Pappu? Why are you so upset?

908
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,952
Friends we are so lucky.

909
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,982
That we can see.

910
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,054
yesterday you know what Kuhu said.

911
00:49:44,762 --> 00:49:48,254
yes Pappu. But what
can we do to make Kuhu happy?

912
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:50,766
Friends I wanted to tell you something.

913
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,664
She wants to fly.

914
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,333
Oh so Kuhu wants to fly?

915
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:57,801
Means she wants to become a bird?

916
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,435
Oh man can also fly.

917
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:01,910
I saw it on the T.V.

918
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:03,037
How?

919
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,574
Paragliding. -yes I know about it.

920
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:10,447
But how can Kuhu fly with it?

921
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:13,354
If we get a parachute then she can fly.

922
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,558
But where do we get a parachute from?

923
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,652
From Mumbai.

924
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,593
It's a very big city. - But.

925
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:21,392
But. - But what?

926
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:23,558
But I don't have enough money.

927
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,066
Pappu if we take money
from our piggy banks then..

928
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:31,070
..maybe we will have enough cash.

929
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:33,640
yes father has given me lot of money.

930
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,474
And I shall give it to you.

931
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:37,343

932
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:38,743
yes friend. Why not?

933
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,374
But what do we have to do?

934
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:42,385
We have to run. To Mumbai.

935
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,077
Run? -yes.

936
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,084
We want to fly, don't we? -yes.

937
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:47,585
Do you wwant to fly?

938
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:50,354
See we have to make
all the preparations tonight.

939
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:51,854
Done.

940
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:14,208
Ghasitaraam cooks very well.

941
00:51:14,843 --> 00:51:16,902
Right? And did you have dinner?

942
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:19,546
No first you both have
it. I shall have it later.

943
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:23,649
In the entire day you
do this for just 15 minutes.

944
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,286
And even then you
can't massage properly.

945
00:51:25,354 --> 00:51:26,651
Do it properly.

946
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:33,022
If I get hold of these
terrorists I will slap their behinds in the..

947
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:35,256
..mornings and evenings.

948
00:51:35,364 --> 00:51:36,592
And make them saints.

949
00:51:36,665 --> 00:51:37,757
But what do I do of this one?

950
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,562
Which one? -The terrorists.

951
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:42,765
This mountain is a burden on this earth.

952
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,897
Who is? -Terrorists.

953
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,933
What happened?

954
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,637
I think I saw a lizard.

955
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:51,906
Shoo it away.

956
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,812
Shoo it away. Please please. - Father?

957
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:55,213
Please please. - What?

958
00:51:55,284 --> 00:51:57,650

959
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:01,087
Who is scared?

960
00:52:01,857 --> 00:52:03,654
It's just that the sensations is..

961
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:07,319
What sensation?

962
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,190
Who admitted you to
the police department?

963
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,857
yourfather.

964
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:14,902
Do you rememberwhat
happened on 26th January?

965
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:16,570
Don't make me reveal it.

966
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:19,336
I am nothing now.

967
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:23,973
Father you are good for nothing. -yes!

968
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:26,241

00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:29,207
Me? - Of course you.

970
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:30,842
My funny dad.

971
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:40,551
Okay so first

00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:44,758
..in the clouds and I sit with them..

973
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:48,035
..with some statues..

974
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:50,367
Who is this statue?

975
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:54,304
Statue mother. Statue. - Statue.

976
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:56,144
Like an idol.

977
00:52:56,979 --> 00:52:59,812
Didn't I tell you
that you are a hypocrite?

978
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:02,242
Now I know what you wanted to become.

979
00:53:03,285 --> 00:53:05,344

Massage nicely.

986
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:23,001

What did you say? -
Nothing. - Mother just chill.

989
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:30,569
My son.

990
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:14,621
Monu? - Monu?

991
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,157

992
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:26,328
Come. - Come.

993
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:27,762
Wait. I am coming.

994
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:28,962
Let's go.

995
00:54:30,105 --> 00:54:31,163
He is coming.

996
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,071
Let's go. Let's go.

997
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:35,608
Come. Fast.

998
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:39,074
Let's go.

999
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:45,050
Let's go.

1000
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:51,885
Wait.

1001
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,052

1002
00:54:53,128 --> 00:54:55,790
Tullu hasn't come as yet. -yes.

1003
00:54:55,898 --> 00:54:57,263
Now what do we do?

1004
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,100
Go to Tullu's house to collect him?

1005
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:02,934
No. If we go to his
house we will miss our bus.

1006
00:55:03,372 --> 00:55:05,169
So we should leave him?

1007
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:08,935
If we leave him he will
tell about this to everyone.

1008
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:10,942
He won't.

1009
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:14,312
After all even he
wants Kuhu's happiness.

1010
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,742
Come let's go.

1011
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:17,183
Else we will miss our bus. -yes.

1012
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:18,583
Let's go. - Let's go.

1013
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,150
''We have embarked on a journey..''

1014
00:55:57,226 --> 00:55:59,023
''..but we don't know
where we shall end up.''

1015
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:04,265
''We know our destination
but we do not know the way.''

1016
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,130
''We are on a move now.''

1017
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:10,069
''We have this determination and dreams.''

1018
00:56:10,138 --> 00:56:14,837
''We move ahead. We move ahead.''

1019
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,670
''We have embarked on a journey..''

1020
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:20,806
''..but we don't know
where we shall end up.''

1021
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:26,953
''We know our destination
but we do not know the way.''

1022
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:05,155
''The path moves with us like
the twisting paths of our life.''

1023
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,960
''And we have some memories..''

1024
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,726
''..we look forward to
the happy moments in our path.''

1025
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:16,101
''The path moves with us like
the twisting paths of our life.''

1026
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:18,833
''And we have some memories..''

1027
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:21,603
''..we look forward to
the happy moments in our path.''

1028
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:24,111
''My heart wishes to..''

1029
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:26,980
''..fly in the sky.''

1030
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:29,609
''And touch the moon and the stars.''

1031
00:57:29,685 --> 00:57:32,313
''So many dreams..''

1032
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:34,749
''Where we have to stop..''

1033
00:57:34,823 --> 00:57:36,518
''..we do not know.''

1034
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:42,291
''We have this determination and dreams.''

1035
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:47,696
''We move ahead. We are
on a move now. We move ahead.''

1036
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:50,967
''We have embarked on a journey..''

1037
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:53,269
''..but we don't know
where we shall end up.''

1038
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:59,077
''We know our destination
but we do not know the way.''

1039
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:44,589
This time we shall not leave him.

1040
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:45,785
Call him.

1041
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:47,086
Call him.

1042
00:58:47,262 --> 00:58:48,752
Bring him out.

1043
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:51,193
Chotulal come out.

1044
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:53,894
Come out chotulal.

1045
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:55,726
Come out.

1046
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:56,964
Come out.

1047
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:58,131
Come out.

1048
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:02,768
Come out you jerk.

1049
00:59:03,812 --> 00:59:06,576
Coming. - Chotulal?

1050
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:09,014
Come out. - What is going on here?

1051
00:59:09,117 --> 00:59:11,642
Today your son has crossed the limits.

1052
00:59:11,953 --> 00:59:14,217
We warned you the last
time. Can't you understand?

1053
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:17,181
How will he
understand? His mind is full of shit.

1054
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:19,921
What? Sit here. - Sir?

1055
00:59:20,062 --> 00:59:22,030
Will you make tea? Go.

1056
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,222
Why are you quiet?

1057
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:24,595
Say something.

1058
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:25,928
I suspected him before.

1059
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,059
One minute.

1060
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:30,032
you have transformed a nice
village to Jawaharlal Nehru crossroads.

1061
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:31,504
Is a panchayat going on here?

1062
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:33,039
Even my son is lost.

1063
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:34,234
yes. He was crying so much.

1064
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,537
you stay in your limits.

1065
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,601
If you act smart I will shoot you.

1066
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,579
Take these men away.

1067
00:59:39,648 --> 00:59:41,513
And the women? -The women also.

1068
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:43,574
Get lost. Hey keep the bottle.

1069
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:45,279
Keep the bottle. Keep it.

1070
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,680
Only your son is missing?

1071
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:52,293
What son you have given birth to!

1072
00:59:56,765 --> 00:59:58,824
See didn't I tell
you about big buildings?

1073
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,595
Come let's go there.

1074
01:00:05,774 --> 01:00:07,036
Pappu?

1075
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:08,837
Where will we find a parachute?

1076
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:12,010
you don't take tension.

1077
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,174
We will find it. -
Forget about the parachute.

1078
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,777
I am hungry and rats
are running in my stomach.

1079
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:20,947
you are always hungry..

1080
01:00:21,022 --> 01:00:23,081
Listen. Let's feed him first.

1081
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:24,783
Then we shall look for a parachute.

1082
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,828
Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go.

1083
01:00:26,895 --> 01:00:28,089
you should be ashamed.

1084
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:31,293
The children went
missing from under your nose.

1085
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:39,071
you should be stripped
and paraded in the village.

1086
01:00:39,274 --> 01:00:41,037
And they should hit you.

1087
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:42,599
Sir, please don't scold him so much.

1088
01:00:42,677 --> 01:00:43,837
His wife has
already raged over him a lot.

1089
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:44,970
He deserves it.

1090
01:00:45,046 --> 01:00:47,139
Have you done
anything worthwhile till date?

1091
01:00:47,215 --> 01:00:48,546
yes. - What?

1092
01:00:48,617 --> 01:00:49,845
I have made a call. -To whom?

1093
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:51,112
JahanJi.

1094
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:53,552
8 times. Thrice he
didn't pick up the call.

1095
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:55,317
And remaining times he
cut my call after picking it up.

1096
01:00:55,557 --> 01:00:56,854
He insulted me.

1097
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:58,150
you must not have taken my name.

1098
01:00:58,226 --> 01:00:59,887
I did. Ask him.

1099
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:01,121
Let me talk to him. -Ask him.

1100
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:02,288
you keep quiet. you keep quiet.

1101
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:03,589
Let me talk.

1102
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:06,529
Come.

1103
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:08,259
see.

1104
01:01:08,336 --> 01:01:10,804
I am very hungry. See this.

1105
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:13,540
come.

1106
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:18,270
Brother?

1107
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:20,572
The samosa is very nice.

1108
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:21,943
Can I get one more?

1109
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:23,575
First learn to speak.

1110
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:25,210
Pappu we are very hungry.

1111
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,346
you sit. I will just give the order.

1112
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:32,151
After giving the orders I will
ask where we can find a parachute.

1113
01:01:33,128 --> 01:01:36,757
I feel as if I can eat all the jalebis.

1114
01:01:40,168 --> 01:01:41,658
Greetings.

1115
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,199
yes.

1116
01:01:43,972 --> 01:01:46,099
yes all is fine thanks to God.

1117
01:01:47,976 --> 01:01:49,238
yes.

1118
01:01:49,978 --> 01:01:51,206
yes I will see to it.

1119
01:01:52,747 --> 01:01:54,806
The children will be
dropped from the parachute.

1120
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,681
yes Sir. you don't worry.

1121
01:01:57,886 --> 01:01:59,183
We will take care of everything.

1122
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:01,250
yes.

1123
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:03,354
Listen.

1124
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:06,259
These men who are sitting there..

1125
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:10,858
yes? - One of them was
talking on phone outside.

1126
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:13,298
What? -That they
also want to buy a parachute.

1127
01:02:13,535 --> 01:02:16,663
Now see. So now we have to follow them.

1128
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:20,731
Then we shall get
to the parachutes. -yes.

1129
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:22,299
And that too without any troubles.

1130
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:24,774
Eat fast. Fast.

1131
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:29,139
I think they are leaving.

1132
01:02:29,217 --> 01:02:30,946
Come on fast. - Fast.

1133
01:02:32,988 --> 01:02:34,285
Let's go.

1134
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:35,755
Where are you going? Give me the money.

1135
01:02:40,161 --> 01:02:41,628
Come fast. Come.

1136
01:02:46,334 --> 01:02:47,699
Where did they go?

1137
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:50,167
There they are.

1138
01:03:06,988 --> 01:03:08,012
Sir?

1139
01:03:08,223 --> 01:03:09,281
Something important.

1140
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:12,291
I want it by
tomorrow morning. -yes sir.

1141
01:03:17,098 --> 01:03:18,895
Sirwe have just
received news from control room.

1142
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:21,525
Acall has been
traced from across the borders.

1143
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,297
They have spoken about blasts in Mumbai.

1144
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:26,170
Something about dropping
children from parachutes on 15th July.

1145
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,606
Children?

1146
01:03:28,877 --> 01:03:32,938
Now they will use kids as human bombs?

1147
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:36,114
Cowards!

1148
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:39,179
And dropping them
from parachutes means..

1149
01:03:39,254 --> 01:03:40,585
..that they are
planning an aerial attack.

1150
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:42,690
Might be sir. -you know what Kunal?

1151
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:46,193
I think they have
already entered the city.

1152
01:03:47,028 --> 01:03:48,290
Do one thing.

1153
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:51,257
Alert all the informers in our city.

1154
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:55,760
And alert the paragliding
and adventure sports units as well.

1155
01:03:55,837 --> 01:03:58,237
yes sir. - We have to
really move fast on this.

1156
01:03:58,773 --> 01:04:00,604
Okay? - Sure sir.

1157
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:13,120
Okay so he has run away.

1158
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:14,781
And I am being held responsible.

1159
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,925
Out there in the market the
entire day I sweat in the sun.

1160
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:22,620
What do you do at home the entire day?

1161
01:04:22,997 --> 01:04:24,259
Can't you take care of him?

1162
01:04:24,866 --> 01:04:26,766
In this entire
world only you go to work.

1163
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:28,759
No one else does work.

1164
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:32,298
There are things more
important than yourwork in life.

1165
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,130
But you won't understand.

1166
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:35,833
Then make me understand. Make me.

1167
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:38,936
you should have taken
him on one trip to the city.

1168
01:04:39,314 --> 01:04:41,874
Then he wouldn't
have run away like this.

1169
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:43,876
Where do I take him?

1170
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:45,751
Where?

1171
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:48,554
your child roams in
the entire world by himself.

1172
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:50,619
Let him come home now.

1173
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:52,825
This time I shall skin him.

1174
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:54,087
Enough.

1175
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:55,854
Sumitra?

1176
01:04:56,698 --> 01:04:58,359
There is no point in being a tyrant.

1177
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,259
you have been so harsh with him..

1178
01:05:02,303 --> 01:05:04,271
..that he has to run away
from the home time and again.

1179
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:07,033
you..

1180
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:11,008
Sumitra?

1181
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:18,751
I am his father.

1182
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,914
I do all this for his better.

1183
01:05:22,157 --> 01:05:24,022
For his better?

1184
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,124
Then where is he?

1185
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:27,991
Where is he?

1186
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:37,235
you said that this is a movie on birds.

1187
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:39,601
yes.

1188
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:42,174
Then are they
fighting amongst themselves?

1189
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:45,138
yes daughter.

1190
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:48,648
They must be big and ferocious.

1191
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,650
That's why they fight like this.

1192
01:05:51,252 --> 01:05:52,947
They are very big.

1193
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:55,620
How are theirwings, father?

1194
01:05:57,058 --> 01:05:58,286
Kuhu dear.

1195
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,160
Go and play for some time.

1196
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:02,856
And rest.

1197
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,957
Or go and study with mother.

1198
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:07,795
I have finished my studies.

1199
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,174
I come tired from working
in the office the entire day.

1200
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,677
But I can't watch T.V. in peace at home.

1201
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:19,871
you sit at home and
watch the T.V. entire day.

1202
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:22,214
Can't you take
care of herfor some time?

1203
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:27,046
Who takes care of Kuhu the entire day?

1204
01:06:27,288 --> 01:06:28,550
Say?

1205
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:31,886
Who is there to look after
her smallest needs? Her mother.

1206
01:06:33,027 --> 01:06:35,962
She comes and sits with you
for some time and you get irritated.

1207
01:06:37,332 --> 01:06:40,324
She can't see. Therefore
she is not important for you.

1208
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:43,769
But after all she is our child.

1209
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:46,264
Pappu is betterthan us.

1210
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,332
He takes care of herwholeheartedly.

1211
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:49,975
Manages her.

1212
01:07:03,591 --> 01:07:06,082
Kuhu now tell me who is this?

1213
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:08,287
This is Lord Ganesh Pappu.

1214
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,895
yes. I know.

1215
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:12,865
you know what he likes?

1216
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:14,128
Sweets.

1217
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:18,502
Okay tell me where
does Lord Ganesha live?

1218
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:24,871
Mother says that he lives in our hearts.

1219
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:26,937
And so our hearts beat.

1220
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,312
And we live.

1221
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,678
Do all our hearts beat Pappu? -yes.

1222
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:33,277
you can hear it as well.

1223
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:42,757
Similarly my heart
must be beating as well.

1224
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,060
Check and do tell me Pappu.

1225
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:10,649
''your laughter
brings a smile on my face.''

1226
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:18,125
''I love to hear you speak.''

1227
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:23,899
''It seems there is nothing without you.''

1228
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:25,633
''Nothing.''

1229
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,298
''It seems as if you are my prayer.''

1230
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:32,512
''My happiness.''

1231
01:08:57,205 --> 01:09:03,633
''I learnt how to
walk by holding your hands.''

1232
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:08,142
''To fall, and rise
and fall, and rise again..''

1233
01:09:08,216 --> 01:09:10,912
''.. I learnt from you.''

1234
01:09:11,486 --> 01:09:17,516
''The colours in my
dreams are because of you.''

1235
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:21,790
''you gave me wings..''

1236
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:25,023
''..and I learnt to fly.''

1237
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:31,200
''It seems there is nothing without you.''

1238
01:09:31,272 --> 01:09:32,933
''Nothing.''

1239
01:09:33,007 --> 01:09:36,773
''It seems as if you are my prayer.''

1240
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:40,139
''My happiness.''

1241
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:49,747
''your laughter
brings a smile on my face.''

1242
01:09:50,892 --> 01:09:58,264
''I love to hear you speak.''

1243
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:10,870
Greetings sir. As soon as I
get any news I shall let you know.

1244
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:13,741
Sir?

1245
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,724
Uncle.

1246
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,800
We wanted to ask you something.

1247
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:39,998
What?

1248
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:44,143
I heard this man talking
about the parachutes on phone.

1249
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:46,814
What did you hear? - Parachute.

1250
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:49,645
Actually we wish to buy a parachute.

1251
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:52,151
Can you tell me where
we can find the parachute?

1252
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:55,582
you want to buy a parachute? -yes.

1253
01:10:55,656 --> 01:10:57,749
you will find it in
the big market. Ask anyone.

1254
01:10:58,025 --> 01:11:00,858
Thank you uncle. -
Thank you uncle. -Thank you.

1255
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:02,856
Thank you Shimit.

1256
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,293
Where is the shop?

1257
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:10,868
There. -There.

1258
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:13,202
Come. Parachute?

1259
01:11:13,274 --> 01:11:14,969
It's looking so nice. - Come.

1260
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,532
Here.come this way.

1261
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:21,844
Uncle we want a parachute.

1262
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,247
Parachute? -yes.

1263
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:24,579
Okay.

1264
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:27,915
What type of parachute do you want?

1265
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:29,553
See. Choose from these.

1266
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,314
No. It's not good. - Select it.

1267
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:32,888
No not this one.

1268
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,758
This one. - No not that.

This one. -yes.

1271
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:39,691
This one is very
nice. - Give us this one.

1272
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:42,201
I will have to check
if this one is in stock.

1273
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,663
Do one thing. Sit
outside. Have cold drinks.

1274
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,036
Deva take them out.

Sir? We have
received a call from big market.

1281
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,120

been making enquiries..

1282
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:07,183

1292
01:12:41,662 --> 01:12:43,186

Kunal?

1296
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:10,048
They are very young.

1297
01:13:10,858 --> 01:13:12,086
These are the kids.

1298
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:14,624
Are you sure? -yes sir.

1299
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,323

Hello.

1302
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,021
Oh so uncle has scared you.

1303
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:43,181
What uncle?

1304
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:44,649
Why are you scaring the kids?

1305
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:47,259
Why are you showing them
the guns? Go. Go away. Leave.

1306
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:52,824
I scolded them.

1307
01:13:53,901 --> 01:13:56,836
Okay Uncle now your punishment is that..

1308
01:13:57,772 --> 01:13:59,137

And you are very stylish.

1310
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:08,248
Is this your spectacles or..

1311
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:09,715
Okay.

And tell me who is
the brightest amongst you?

1313
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,248
Who is your leader?

1314
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:22,890

1315
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:26,560
Hi. Hello.

1317
01:14:33,074 --> 01:14:34,336

1318
01:14:35,242 --> 01:14:36,709
Vikas? Kunal?

1319
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:39,101
Asif? lqbal? Something like that.

1320
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:40,741
Rishabh Sharma.

1321
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,746
Rishabh Sharma?

1322
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:44,242
Okay.

1323
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:48,280
Hello Rishabh.

1324
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,689
And friends.

1325
01:14:54,829 --> 01:15:00,233
Rishabh do you know
how to fly a parachute?

1326
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,066
It's because we have 5 parachutes.

1327
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:04,365
yes sir. - How many
parachutes do we have? - Five.

1328
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:05,731
we have five parachutes.

1329
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:07,967
So shall we go now.

1330
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,148
Okay fine they are not

01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:18,708
Cancel the samosa. - Oaky sir.

1332
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:21,583
Samosa cancel.

1333
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:29,326
you want a parachute?

1334
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:40,969
There is something wrong.

1335
01:15:41,308 --> 01:15:43,003
I don't think these
children are involved.

1336
01:15:43,944 --> 01:15:45,309
But we can't take the risk.

1337
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:50,684
We will keep them overnight here.

1338
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:52,147
Okay sir.Just make them comfortable.

1339
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,585
Okay. - Feed them.

1340
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:56,081
Okay.

1341
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:59,792
No using force.

1342
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,224
Sure sir. -That's an order.

1343
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:03,221
Okay sir.

1344
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:09,728
Rando called.

1345
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:11,863
I think he has got a lead.

1346
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,868
We have to go to Mumbai right now.

1347
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:15,667
Ali you come with me. - Sir.

1348
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:18,242
R.D. you stay back. - Sir.

1349
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:21,208
Okay? - Okay sir. - Start packing.

1350
01:16:21,282 --> 01:16:23,011
This is Mumbai police head quarters.

1351
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:24,979
And this is the secretariat.

1352
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,218
Farid and Karim.

1353
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:30,815
you shall take this way.

1354
01:16:31,826 --> 01:16:34,659
I and Saud shall attack from here.

1355
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:39,295
Brother. We have studied this area.

1356
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,800
It has lot of security.

1357
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,737
Like 26/11.. What 26/11?

1358
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:50,874
Be proud that Allah gave you the
chance to avenge those martyred souls.

1359
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,139
The people here.

1360
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:55,614
And the government.

1361
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:58,881
They need to know
that we are not silent.

1362
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:02,221
But brother let us discuss
this amongst ourselves first.

1363
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,716
Let's relax and..

1364
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,281
Martyrdom cannot
be achieved by relaxing.

1365
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:06,690
But by fighting.

1366
01:17:08,662 --> 01:17:11,290
This mission. This
opportunity is given to us by Allah.

1367
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:13,833
We shall surely succeed in it. Amen.

1368
01:17:20,574 --> 01:17:27,138
The one who was of no use to anyone.

1369
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:32,312
That's me. Pratap Singh Subhedara.

1370
01:17:33,154 --> 01:17:34,212
What happened brother?

1371
01:17:35,556 --> 01:17:36,716
What happened?

1372
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,656
Nothing.

1373
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:42,220
Life was gifted to
me in these mountains.

1374
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,822
Ajob in police.

1375
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:52,661
Everywhere, in all
directions weather is bad.

1376
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:58,136
My wife doesn't respect me at all.

1377
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:02,014
No love in people's hearts.

1378
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:05,077
The scooter is also not working.

1379
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:06,742
It doesn't start.

1380
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:12,149
My son. To him I sang lullabies.

1381
01:18:12,226 --> 01:18:14,660
He.. Monu..

1382
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,601
Even in his eyes I am a bad father.

1383
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:25,201
Then too I have no complaints.

1384
01:18:25,306 --> 01:18:26,705
Mother..

1385
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,047
My health fails me.

1386
01:18:38,686 --> 01:18:40,654
My breath is dependent on a support.

1387
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:44,719
And that too has been
taken away by my son. Monu..

1388
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:48,661
Come back once.

1389
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:50,060
Just once.

1390
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:20,516
''I miss your lullabies.''

1391
01:19:20,694 --> 01:19:24,926
''I can't sleep without you.''

1392
01:19:24,999 --> 01:19:29,197
''This darkness envelopes me.''

1393
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:33,734
''Look I am so scared.''

1394
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:38,104
''I get up and look
for you in all directions.''

1395
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:42,239
''But still I can't see you.''

1396
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:46,309
''I am so far away from you.''

1397
01:19:46,654 --> 01:19:50,556
''How do I come close to you?''

1398
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:53,058
''Mother..''

1399
01:19:58,699 --> 01:20:03,295
''you must be sitting
with food on a plate for me..''

1400
01:20:03,537 --> 01:20:07,598
''Tiny morsels decorating it.''

1401
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:11,668
''your eyes must be full of tears.''

1402
01:20:11,745 --> 01:20:16,273
''Waiting to see my face.''

1403
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,117
''you must be waking up
at the slightest sound..''

1404
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:32,291
''..to check if I am back in bed..''

1405
01:20:32,533 --> 01:20:36,594
''..and then you must
be running here and there..''

1406
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,766
''..and then you come to a
halt when you can't find me..''

1407
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:42,638
''Mother.''

1408
01:20:48,716 --> 01:20:52,846
''I miss your lullabies.''

1409
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:57,016
''I can't sleep without you.''

1410
01:20:57,224 --> 01:21:01,320
''This darkness envelopes me.''

1411
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:06,223
''Look I am so scared.''

1412
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:52,671
''The kites which hang on the walls..''

1413
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:56,273
''..await to fly in the sky..''

1414
01:21:56,350 --> 01:22:00,343
''..the dusts on the rolls..''

1415
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:05,923
''..rub against the threads..''

1416
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:14,967
''The lanes are emrty.''

1417
01:22:15,035 --> 01:22:17,333
''The streets are silent.''

1418
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:21,337
''The swings on the trees are sad.''

1419
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:27,605
''The piece of sky
which is mine must be crying.''

1420
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:31,708
''Mother.''

1421
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:42,719
''My tears are mixed with them.''

1422
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:52,737
''Tell me how do I hide them?''

1423
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,720
Why are you doing this?

1424
01:23:10,324 --> 01:23:12,087
you didn't eat anything last night.

1425
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:14,852
Sir I think we will
have to use force on them.

1426
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,127
Look if you tell me the
truth then I promise you won't..

1427
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:25,900
..come to any harm.

1428
01:23:27,908 --> 01:23:31,969
I will drop you till your home.

1429
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,807
Uncle we all have come from Nainital.

1430
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:39,344
Forthe parachute.

1431
01:23:40,554 --> 01:23:41,714
What parachute?

1432
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:43,620
Say.

1433
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:46,317
Look I have promised you..

1434
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:48,687
Sir.

1435
01:23:52,733 --> 01:23:54,724
They didn't tell
anything. - Nothing as yet.

1436
01:23:54,801 --> 01:23:56,996
Sir, all these kids are from Nainital.

1437
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:59,231
This is Pappu. And that's Monu.

1438
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:01,833
Pratap Singh's
son.We have met his father.

1439
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:03,974
Why were you looking forthe parachute?

1440
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:08,807
Uncle we want to fly in
the sky with the parachute.

1441
01:24:08,882 --> 01:24:10,713
That's why we are here.

1442
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:14,745
We heard one man
talking on the phone with someone.

1443
01:24:14,821 --> 01:24:16,118
About the parachute.

1444
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:18,987
If you see the man
again will you recognise him?

1445
01:24:19,192 --> 01:24:21,183
There were four of them

1446
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:23,855
All four had big bags with them.

1447
01:24:23,931 --> 01:24:26,263
All of them went into a building.

1448
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:28,797
Do you know where
the building is? -yes.

1449
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:32,571
Shall we? -yeah.

1450
01:26:50,844 --> 01:26:52,004
Karim.

1451
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,846
Run.

1452
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:03,349
Hurry.

1453
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,641
open it.

1454
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:34,018
Move in. That way.

1455
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:03,674
leave.

1456
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:06,048
leave.

1457
01:28:07,921 --> 01:28:09,479
Take him away.

1458
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:19,823
Without dreaming
forget about flying in the sky..

1459
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,925
..it's difficult to
even walk through life.

1460
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:26,296
Correct. -The way
these children supported us..

1461
01:28:26,706 --> 01:28:28,765
..and helped us in
catching the terrorists..

1462
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:31,303
..forthis act the
nation is proud of them.

1463
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:35,848
I agree that they ran away
from their homes and their village.

1464
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,844
It is wrong.

1465
01:28:38,218 --> 01:28:41,779
But this mistake helped to
snip of a bad disaster in its roots.

1466
01:28:42,088 --> 01:28:44,113
I have a request fortheir parents..

1467
01:28:44,624 --> 01:28:49,721
..and all other parents
that they understand their..

1468
01:28:50,096 --> 01:28:52,587
.children's small wishes.

1469
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,765
On behalf of the government I
fulfil their dream of flying in the sky.

1470
01:29:06,613 --> 01:29:07,637
Go children.

1471
01:29:07,881 --> 01:29:10,475
Fly in the sky. But
keep the ropes in your hand.

1472
01:29:10,917 --> 01:29:12,544
Go and fulfil your dreams.

1473
01:29:12,953 --> 01:29:15,148
Jai hind. Jai Maharashtra.

1474
01:29:17,757 --> 01:29:22,194
''Sometimes is feels as if
happiness has touched you and blown away.''

1475
01:29:22,796 --> 01:29:27,756
''Sometimes it feels as if these
wonderful nights shall not come back.''

1476
01:29:28,268 --> 01:29:30,862
''Let me touch. Let me feel.''

1477
01:29:30,937 --> 01:29:35,772
''Let me close my eyes and dream.

1478
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:38,533
''Let me walk. Let me search.''

1479
01:29:38,612 --> 01:29:42,912
''Let me keep the joy
of flying in my heart.''

1480
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:46,145
''Fly away.''

1481
01:29:46,219 --> 01:29:48,847
''Touch the sky.''

1482
01:29:49,089 --> 01:29:51,319
''Live.''

1483
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:53,889
''Live your dreams.''

1484
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,224
''Fly away.''

1485
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:11,271
''The life is small.''

1486
01:30:12,045 --> 01:30:14,513
''But dreams are thousand.''

1487
01:30:14,614 --> 01:30:17,139
''Light from the sun.''

1488
01:30:17,217 --> 01:30:19,617
''And love from the moon.''

1489
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:22,052
''Sometimes laugh.Cry sometimes.''

1490
01:30:22,122 --> 01:30:26,684
''And the win each moment.''

1491
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,754
''Win at times. At times lose.''

1492
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:34,232
''And bend the lines of fate''

1493
01:30:35,201 --> 01:30:37,294
''Fly away.''

1494
01:30:37,537 --> 01:30:39,869
''Touch the sky.''

1495
01:30:40,206 --> 01:30:42,504
''Live.''

1496
01:30:42,575 --> 01:30:45,009
''Live your dreams.''

1497
01:30:45,145 --> 01:30:48,911
''Fly away.''
