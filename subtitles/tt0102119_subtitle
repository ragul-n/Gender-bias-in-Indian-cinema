2
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,954
...the next name on the list,
is of that officer....

3
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,701
Who, with his bravery, loyalty,
and, honesty, ...

4
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,169
... has elevated our reputation.

5
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,169
By coincidence, he's
also retiring today.

6
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,043
That's why,
with the Gold Medal, ...

7
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,173
... he's also being
given a cash-prize.

8
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,951
You all must have guessed, ...

9
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,886
... that, the name of
that lucky-officer is...

10
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,379
Our Honourable Minister,...

11
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,183
... is longing
to say a few words, about him.

12
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,222
Dear officers...
lsn't there a microphone?

13
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,884
Then get it. Who'll yell?
lt'll give me a sore throat.

14
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,504
Officers, l wasn't
just ''yearning'' ...

15
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,837
... to say a few words
about him...

16
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,239
But just ''dying'' !
http://yallamazika.info/forum

17
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:37,047
You see, the rising atrocities,
and corruption in our country...

18
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,248
And all such vices...
of the nation...

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,288
Used to come to my thoughts,
l used to get perturbed...

20
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,221
About the future of this country.

21
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:56,092
But after seeing an officer
like him, l said to myself...

22
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,029
Nothing can happen to us!

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,975
So it's my earnest request to
all the officers here today,

24
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,111
That they walk in the
footsteps of this man.

25
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,442
That's all. Thank you.

26
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,309
My dear brothers and sisters...

27
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:47,587
To say a few words about our
Commissioner and the Minister,

28
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,114
l too, am not just
''longing,'' but, ''dying'' !

29
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,017
These 2 honourable men, are
two sides of the same coin.

30
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,965
The Commissioner does,
what the Minister wants.

31
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,492
And the minister wants
what the public doesn't!

32
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,765
l'm very thankful
to these two men.

33
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,766
For, if they hadn't been
around, ...

34
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,978
... l too wouldn't have
made the sacrifices

35
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,105
For which l'm being
awarded in return.

36
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,918
The cheque of Rs. 50,000/- which
the Minister has given me,

37
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,023
l donate it to the Police
Officers' Welfare Fund.

38
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,306
Are you really so shameless?
He spat on you in public today!

39
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,581
Not just me, sir. you too!

40
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,850
- Wasn't the cash award
your idea? - Yes, but...

41
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,021
You had given it a nod, and
signed the cheque too.

42
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,183
Even your death shall
have my signature on it!

43
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,031
No; One shouldn't come up
with such dangerous ideas, ...

44
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,692
... for one's loyalist!

45
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,365
Put that away and listen.

46
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,569
He is retiring from duty today.
He must retire from life too.

47
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,981
The promise l had made to give
you respect, l've fulfilled.

48
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,178
Today, this shackle of
30 years of responsibility,...

49
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,749
...was removed from my body.

50
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,706
l'm the Commissioner speaking.

51
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,305
Call the Minister.

52
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,905
Your phone.

53
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,051
This is the Minister speaking.

54
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,289
Sir, l've thrashed the goons
you had sent.

55
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,981
What are you talking about?

56
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,692
Tell your loyal Commissioner,...

57
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,490
To pick them from the litter-bin,
that is opposite my house.

58
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,698
Another thing...

59
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,293
lf you ever do it again,

60
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,105
You'll have it from me!

61
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,975
Who was it?

62
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,243
That lnderjeet!

63
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,754
He still has that rigidity
in his voice.

64
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,555
Teach him a lesson!

65
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,425
l think we should give up
this idea for a few days.

66
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,834
Yes, because today's paper,...

67
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,564
... carries your long statement
in his praise.

68
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,314
Vijay, listen.

69
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,118
Vijay, listen.

70
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,025
See this.

71
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,270
This paper. lt has such
a lovely photo of my father.

72
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,568
What praises they've sung
about him, it says...

73
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,038
There was never such a brave
officer in the force before.

74
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:44,779
See, it says, there never was
born a loyal officer like him.

75
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,947
Listen to me... You'll have
to see this newspaper.

76
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,385
You're not very hurt, are you?

77
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,425
No. Had you shown me
the photo a bit later on...

78
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,336
Would the sky have fallen,
or the earth disappeared?

79
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,243
Had you been as tough as my dad,
you'd not have been hurt at all!

80
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,639
l'll slap you, if you refer
to your father again!

81
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,850
Don't you have any other topic?
lt's him, all day...every day!

82
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,652
Build a temple, and,
enshrine him in that!

83
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,516
l don't need a temple to do that.
l've enshrined him in my heart.

84
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,159
But...l love, only you!

85
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,898
l've been hearing that
for 2 years now.

86
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,698
Without any proof too!

87
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,696
- What proof do you want?
- Will you give what l ask for?

88
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,304
Yes.

89
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,154
Who is it?

90
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,155
Hold on. l'm coming.

91
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,304
Who is it?

92
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,111
lnspector, l'm here to
search your house.

93
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,376
Hold on, lady. What for?

94
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:32,080
- Your daughter has run away.
- What! But where? And why?

95
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,459
That's what l'm asking.
Why did she run away?

96
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,963
What was troubling her?
Any complaint from her hostel.

97
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,959
The moment she heard about the
retirement she ran away.

98
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,462
Tell me, where have you
hidden her? Where is she?

99
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,582
What are you glaring at?
Tell us, where is she?

100
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,318
Right here.

101
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,919
Daddy's pet...ran away, eh?
Left college too?

102
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,694
Then? l want to stay with you.

103
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:16,134
You come and meet me very rarely,
and, l'm dying to stay with you.

104
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,567
Before you had your service
as an excuse, ...

105
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,472
.. but now we can stay together.

106
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,699
Silly girl. l was coming
to collect you, in fact.

107
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,708
l too am dying;... To see your
mischief; Hear you talk.

108
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,245
To whom does this belong to?

109
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,386
lt's mine, it's nice isn't it?
l had worn it in a college-play.

110
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,490
May l too join the l.P.S.?

111
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,621
Yes, why not?
But sit here please.

112
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,757
Look, for the l.P.S., ...

113
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,433
... one needs to have a firm
heart and strong body!

114
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,606
To become an inspector, ...

115
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,040
... l'm willing
to undergo any hardships, sir.

116
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,579
Okay, From tomorrow, at 6 A.M.
we start your training.

117
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:49,893
''As long as we're living
We shall remain young at heart.''

118
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:01,629
''As long as we're living
We shall remain young at heart.''

119
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:09,642
''From each morning that dawns,
we shall ask for new joys.''

120
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,676
''Yes, always new joys.''

121
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:23,561
''As long as we're living
We shall remain young at heart.''

122
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:35,505
''As long as we're living
We shall remain young at heart.''

123
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:43,513
''From each morning that dawns,
we shall ask for new joys.''

124
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,311
''Yes, always new joys.''

125
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,556
''Get me?''

126
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,505
''The one who doesn't
wake up early morning''

127
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:46,577
''ls an enemy to his own life.''

128
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,346
''The one who doesn't
wake up early morning''

129
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:58,180
''ls an enemy to his own life.''

130
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:05,961
''So says the coming youth
and the gone childhood.''

131
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:16,572
''lf the foundation is solid,
no house falls.''

132
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:24,341
''From each new morning that dawns
we shall ask for new joys.''

133
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,386
''Yes, always new joys.''

134
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,452
''As long as we're alive...''

135
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:35,048
''The cool gusts of wind,
will keep you fresh all day.''

136
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:46,696
''The cool gusts of wind,
will keep you fresh all day.''

137
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:54,565
''The colourful sights of today,
shall regale you till tomorrow.''

138
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,904
''With this self-confidence,...''

139
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,747
''...you'll have the world
at your feet''

140
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:12,746
''So from each new morning
that breaks, ask for new joys.''

141
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,623
''Yes, always new joys.''

142
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:26,600
''As long as we're alive
we shall remain young at heart.''

143
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:38,314
''As long as we're alive
let's remain young.''

144
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:46,355
''With every new day that dawns
let's expect new joys.''

145
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,156
''Yes, always new joys.''

146
00:18:53,932 --> 00:19:00,167
''As long as we're alive,
let's all be young at heart.''

147
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,995
You've been representing your
college in all these sports too?

148
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,163
You've got the admission.

149
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,178
You've come here too?

150
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,183
l reach wherever you are...

151
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,891
l know you left Mysore.
So l left it too.

152
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,894
You came to live here, so did l.

153
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,694
You took admission
in this college, ...

154
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,227
...l swear, l'll do the same.

155
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:09,508
My foot! People who pass in the
3rd class, that too, by threats.

156
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,237
Do not get an admission here.

157
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,703
You don't know me.

158
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,707
lf l do get the admission,
what will you give me?

159
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,250
- l don't argue with dogs!
- Then what do you do with them?

160
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,448
You've barked enough.
Now scoot!

161
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,157
Just wait here.
l'll come with my admission.

162
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,565
Then l'll bite you so hard, ...

163
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,033
...you'll need 1 4 injections,
in your stomach!

164
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,502
You expect an admission here,
on these marks?

165
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:49,980
Sir, don't see my marks,
see who is my father.

166
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,915
Why are you wasting time? You
won't get in here, at any cost.

167
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,251
Just see my father's name, first.

168
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,560
What for? Even if your father
comes personally, ...

169
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,494
... you'll still not get in.

170
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,491
Then your father will do it,
sir!

171
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,494
- By God...
- Get out!

172
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,235
What happened?
Did he kick you out!

173
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,982
Nobody kicks me out!

174
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,111
And he'll give me
admission alright.

175
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,779
That too by falling at my feet!

176
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,891
And by God! l'll see you yet.
You think too much of yourself.

177
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:46,164
lf such worms begin to think
themselves big, what next?

178
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,731
That's just what l mean...
With you in power...

179
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,077
What does he want?
An umbrella or a cap?

180
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,367
What?

181
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,917
An ''umbrella''
means the hospital, ...

182
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,784
... and a ''cap''
means hell itself!

183
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,820
l swear! l think an umbrella
will do for now.

184
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:12,891
Then why come to me?
Even my son can do this.

185
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,297
Because he has gained
bigger heights than even me.

186
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,366
Not in politics of course,
but only in feet!

187
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,642
So, he'll make the arrangements
for an ''umbrella'' ...

188
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:24,973
... for the principal.

189
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,846
l've to worry about cheating
this whole nation!

190
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:35,584
And if l don't worry about it,
where will this nation be?

191
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:32,441
What had this gentleman said?

192
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,304
''Even if your father comes here
personally, l won't admit you.''

193
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:40,242
But why? How dare he?

194
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,653
l didn't know he was your man.

195
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,487
Then you should've bothered
to find out. lt was your duty.

196
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,764
Had l allowed him, ...

197
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:58,361
... the other students
would've created a chaos.

198
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,035
So a student with 35% can't
get an admission, eh?

199
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,804
Then, what is the
required percentage?

200
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,906
At least 65%.

201
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,089
Don't be afraid.

202
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,966
lt's 85% now; write.

203
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,109
Go on, write.

204
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:49,513
Sir, my father didn't even come;
And you're admitting me in here?

205
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,516
What a nice man! l swear.
Carry on, carry on.

206
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,524
Take this. Come, let's get
that girl sorted out too.

207
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:21,249
ls she the tabby, who
called you a ''dog''?

208
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,449
Not just a dog,
but a '' Bull dog''.

209
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:30,227
And honestly, l liked it too.

210
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,290
She's a beauty.

211
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,769
Any abuse from her lips
will sound very sweet.

212
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:45,572
- Abuse me please.
- Show her the admission slip.

213
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,778
Then we'll hear the sweet words
from her lips.

214
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,584
See this, l've got it.

215
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,584
Now for the next 2 years, it'll
be you, l, and this college.

216
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,324
So what do you say?
What will you give?

217
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,159
Leave me!

218
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,022
What impertinence is this?
What's going on?

219
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,168
What do you want?

220
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,898
- That...
- Not that!

221
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:24,973
lf anybody is worthy of worship,
next to God, it is a teacher.

222
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,774
And you struck him?

223
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,048
You had rightly described her.

224
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,821
She's a sweet spit-fire.

225
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:43,425
Let her try it once with me,
she'll forget everything.

226
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,436
Very proud of your manliness,
aren't you?

227
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,916
Then come outside. lf l don't
make a hole in your pride...

228
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,850
l'm not my dad's daughter!

229
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,166
- Are they college-students?
- No.

230
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,442
One has seeked admission
forcibly.

231
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,102
And the other 3,
are all drop-outs.

232
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,109
They had come
to rough things up.

233
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,712
l feel like breaking
their bones!

234
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,377
l'll talk to your Principal too.

235
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,924
- l'll ask him to take action.
- What action can he take?

236
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,028
They're all the sons
of Big-shots, ...

237
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,757
... on whose donation
the college runs.

238
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,966
That's why there's no one,
to stop or punish them.

239
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,129
l'll stop them. l'll report
them to the police.

240
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,974
Okay, l've taken down
your complaint ...

241
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,498
... and will see to everything.

242
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,906
By sitting in that chair?
Take this baton,...

243
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,708
And these hand-cuffs,
and now get up.

244
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,906
Show them what the law can do.

245
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,315
Easy man. lt's not as it was,
when you were a police officer.

246
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,023
This city has changed ...

247
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,718
... and so have the police
and the criminals.

248
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,754
Even the punishments
have changed.

249
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,891
And so have you! But not me.

250
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:31,967
We're here.

251
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:42,978
Help!

252
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,693
- Who's this James Bond?
- Him?

253
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,837
- My father-in-law to be.
l swear. - Nilu's dad!

254
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,043
So this is
that butterfly's father!

255
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,842
And your father is the Minister.

256
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,447
So that makes me your grand-pa!

257
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,248
l've come to punish you for the
rumpus you made at the college.

258
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,782
Come to the Police-Station
with me.

259
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,089
Else, what will you do?

260
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,095
l'll dump you in that
car and take you there.

261
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,959
Welcome, lnspector.
Take care of your culprits.

262
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,159
Honestly, even after retiring
you haven't changed a bit!

263
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,700
What l should've done myself,
you did it for me.

264
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,762
l've done it up to here, but
you've to follow it up.

265
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,839
Let him rot in jail, for so many
days, that he grows roots there!

266
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,444
Welcome...my dear son; welcome.

267
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,555
Where are you coming from?

268
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,163
From the jail? Great!

269
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,961
Making a name for yourself
these days, aren't you?

270
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,703
You broke lnderjeet's
daughter's hand.

271
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,837
Bashed up a puny professor...

272
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,166
You are good for nothing!

273
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,773
You don't seem my son, but that
of the Police Commissioner!

274
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,349
lf you must commit crime,
then do it the way l do.

275
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,721
Do it as per my status.

276
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,692
l'll finish off that lnderjeet
and his kid today itself!

277
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,630
Wait!

278
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,239
Only fools resort
to such tactics!

279
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,242
lnderjit's life
is his daughter.

280
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,704
His reputation, is his daughter.

281
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,342
Attack his life and reputation.

282
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,780
Strike, when you get a chance,
And leave the rest to me.

283
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,957
l'm here;

284
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,733
What is she doing in here?

285
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:31,237
- What are you doing here?
- Some hot coffee for my Papa.

286
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,979
Silly girl, l've told you
not to do any work, ...

287
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,503
... till your hand's healed.

288
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,443
Not to touch anything, infact.
So, why did you leave your bed?

289
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,447
You get scared for nothing.
l'm okay.

290
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,850
See, l can pick up
every thing...

291
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,293
Keep your foot in this.

292
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,094
- lt's burning badly,...
- l'll get you some ice.

293
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:08,506
There now. A brave girl like
you, doesn't cry like this.

294
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,908
Bear it a little more.

295
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,748
l can bear pain... of any kind.

296
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,051
But l'm petrified of fire.
l just can't bear burning.

297
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,088
Just a little now...
And it'll be fine.

298
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,455
And never play with fire again.

299
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,637
Sit here and put your foot up.

300
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,643
Now relax. l'll make
some coffee for you.

301
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,318
One for me too!
l will get it, won't l?

302
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:53,621
Of course! Come on in.
But why the civil-dress?

303
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,117
l've come to invite you
for my daughter's wedding.

304
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,158
Really? Has she grown so much?

305
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,422
Girls hardly take time to grow.
They grow like vines.

306
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,494
Nilu is of her age too.

307
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,702
You'll have to give
her away soon too.

308
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,897
Find some suitable boy.

309
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,570
What say you, Nilu...

310
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,314
Your father will not find
a better son-in-law, than me.

311
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,312
Tell the old man, that you
and l,are made for each other.

312
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,314
He better not interfere,
else l'll chew him up!

313
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:31,327
Tell him that l've won the
All lndia Motor-cycle Race too.

314
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,761
Now, l've to win just you!

315
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,165
Take you away from him!

316
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,029
l'm coming on 17th Aug.

317
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,374
Our club is celebrating my win.

318
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,175
Come and join me in dancing,
singing and making merry.

319
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,679
And, openly declare our
love for each other.

320
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,962
''l'll declare it openly
that you're my sweetheart.''

321
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,607
''l'll declare it openly
that you're my sweetheart.''

322
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,103
''And life without you
is absolutely useless.''

323
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:06,187
''Since it's a happy moment,
let's hug each other.''

324
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:20,096
''l'll tell the whole world
that you're my sweetheart.''

325
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:24,600
''And that life without you
just isn't worth living.''

326
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:33,706
''So since it's a happy moment,
let's hug each other.''

327
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:52,299
''A coward who's afraid of the
world, dies a thousand deaths.''

328
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,001
''One shouldn't
be afraid to love''

329
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:01,440
''A coward who's afraid of the
world, dies a thousand deaths.''

330
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,938
''One shouldn't
be afraid to love''

331
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,453
''That which grows every moment,
is true love.''

332
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:15,021
''That which grows every moment,
is true love.''

333
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,655
''Thus life without you, love,
is unthinkable.''

334
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:28,767
''And so on this moment of joy,
give us a hug.''

335
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,986
''l've drunk love from your eyes,
that's my sole error.''

336
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,556
''Thus l'm a bit high' now.''

337
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,360
''l've drunk love from your eyes,
that's my sole error.''

338
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,163
''Thus l'm a bit high' now.''

339
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,228
''This l proclaim right now,
that you're my love.''

340
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:39,837
''This l proclaim right now,
that you're my love.''

341
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:44,374
''And that life without you
is impossible''

342
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:53,423
''And thus to celebrate this
moment,let's hug and rejoice.''

343
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:37,100
''This growing up has
brought a storm with it...''

344
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,362
''And you are my CO XSWAlN.''

345
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,300
''This growing up has
brought a storm with it...''

346
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,041
''And you are my CO XSWAlN.''

347
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:55,243
''lf you're with me, then
your heart's safe and sound.''

348
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,714
''lf you're with me, then
your heart's safe and sound.''

349
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:04,384
''For life without you in it
is just not worth living.''

350
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,861
''So let's enjoy this happy
moment and seal it with a hug.''

351
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,430
''So let's enjoy this happy
moment and seal it with a hug.''

352
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,511
''l'll declare it openly
that you're my sweetheart.''

353
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,217
''l'll declare it openly
that you're my sweetheart.''

354
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,721
''And life without you
is absolutely useless.''

355
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:36,257
''So let us seal this joyous
moment, with a hug.''

356
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:41,028
''So let us seal this joyous
moment, with a hug.''

357
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,037
''So let us seal this joyous
moment, with a hug.''

358
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:59,376
''So let us seal this joyous
moment, with a hug.''

359
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,774
- Where had you gone? - l had
gone to my boy... girlfriend.

360
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,253
l know very well,
where, why, ...

361
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,586
... and, where forever,
you're going to go!

362
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,194
Come with me.

363
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,181
Come out!

364
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,223
- You're Vijay? - Yes.

365
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:23,094
l'm a spoke in your wheel?
An old goat?

366
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,826
- You'll take my daughter.
- Listen, sir.

367
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,629
lf you raise your hand again,
then l too... No, sir...

368
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,832
- What will you do?
- l'll raise my hand too.

369
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,638
You'll hit me? Come on then...

370
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,441
What's this? You caught my hand?

371
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,251
You could do that,
but not catch his hand.

372
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,046
You want him to hit me,
and want me to keep quiet?

373
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,691
That's exactly what she wants.
Because she loves me.

374
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:55,091
- What nonsense! - Yes.
She loves me and l love her.

375
00:43:55,366 --> 00:44:00,030
You love her! How dare you
say that in my presence?

376
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,636
Love is related to heart,
not one's daring.

377
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,434
And do you know what's
beating related to? Hand!

378
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,446
Why not ask her?
You love me, or not?

379
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,583
Aren't you scared
of this hard- hearted, ...

380
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,050
... egoistic father of yours?

381
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,650
Come on, he is your father,
not an ogre.

382
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,354
You call him an ogre?

383
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,689
Look at me and say that.

384
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,487
My foot she'll say!
l'll do the talking.

385
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:33,895
Listen boy; she neither hates
you nor me, she's my daughter.

386
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:39,306
She'll die for me and
vice versa. But she loves...

387
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,503
You!

388
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,043
l think the boy's fine.
l like him.

389
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,919
l was just testing you, son.
Hope you're not hurt.

390
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,455
Come home with your parents.

391
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,514
We'll finalize things.
Come on, dear.

392
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,395
- l don't have parents.
- So you too are alone like me.

393
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,694
Never mind. Don't be scared.

394
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:09,166
l, on behalf of your parents,...

395
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:14,504
... betroth this girl
to you in marriage.

396
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,986
And l betroth her to you ...

397
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:27,923
... in marriage too.

398
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,697
Congratulations!

399
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,768
- l honestly didn't think
you'd come. - Why not?

400
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,236
For the last 15 years,
you have not attended one!

401
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,771
How long will l avoid it?
Nilu will also get married.

402
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,141
Very soon l'll be calling
you for her wedding too.

403
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,245
Yes! Found a very nice boy.
http://yallamazika.info/forum

404
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,382
My sincere congratulations.

405
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,717
l'll just meet the bride.

406
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,225
Congratulations!
And bless you both.

407
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,763
Look, she may be
my friend's kid.

408
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,561
But like my own, to me.
Take care of her.

409
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,370
Coming, or will you...

410
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,435
You're a liar,
a cheat and a goon!

411
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,834
l'll never meet you again,
and you also don't meet me!

412
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,634
Stop her, someone!

413
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,843
Stop her, l say.

414
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:02,781
Wait! Wait! Look, l can't
live without you.

415
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,422
You are a liar l don't believe
anything you say.

416
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:11,221
When did l lie? Didn't l say
l was going to Nasik?

417
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,488
Nasik, yes.
But Police-training, No!

418
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,293
But you agree about Nasik?
Please come here, Chandu.

419
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,103
Tell me, are horses
scrubbed at Nasik, ...

420
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:21,434
... or are police trained there?

421
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,541
- l think the latter.
- That's one charge seen to.

422
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,840
Tell me, what's more important;
a beauty or one's duty?

423
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,315
- Duty of course.
- Hear that? Duty above all!

424
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,852
Both your charges are false.
Now, spit the venom!

425
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,317
l'm telling you to cool down,
and you're walking away?

426
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,389
ln the presence of all these
people, l swear by you that l...

427
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,094
What do you say?

428
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,891
''- l don't lie.''
''- That's true.''

429
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,763
''- l don't break promises.''
''- That's true.''

430
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,717
''You're the queen of my heart,
the core of my love.''

431
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,794
''You're the queen of my heart,
the core of my love.''

432
00:48:53,230 --> 00:49:00,898
''l loved you with all my heart,
and no one else to oblige you,''

433
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:09,510
''l don't lie.''
''Nor do l break my promise.''

434
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,614
''For you l'm willing
to die even.''

435
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:22,123
''Cos you alone are my life.''

436
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,528
''Cos you alone are my life.''

437
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,973
''l've bloomed so beautifully,
Thanks to you.''

438
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:46,977
''l've bloomed so beautifully,
Thanks to you.''

439
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:55,555
''l've accepted you as my own,
and listened to your every whim.''

440
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:59,023
''l'm not lying...
nor am l breaking my vow.''

441
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:03,229
''l'm not lying...
nor am l breaking my vow.''

442
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,833
''For your love,
l'll stake my life.''

443
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:20,841
''Cos you're my life itself.''

444
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:08,730
''My decision is final and
you're loved by a simple man.''

445
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:12,969
''My decision is final and
you're loved by a simple man.''

446
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:17,099
''And l promise to give you
all the joys in the world.''

447
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:21,105
''And l promise to give you
all the joys in the world.''

448
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:28,910
''l'm not lying... nor am l
breaking my vow.''

449
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,720
''For your love,
l'll stake my life.''

450
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:46,767
''Cos you're my life itself.''

451
00:51:55,045 --> 00:52:02,918
''l don't know what you did
but you've stolen my heart.''

452
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:11,157
'' But you've given me
a reason to live.''

453
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:19,158
''And l'm not lying, nor am l
breaking my promise.''

454
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,032
''l'm even willing
to die for your love.''

455
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:36,853
''For you alone
are my life itself.''

456
00:52:54,905 --> 00:53:01,367
''There's noise in every street,
Din Dayal is a great cheat.''

457
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,645
Down with Din Dayal.

458
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,652
Give us our demands.

459
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,723
Their strike is getting
longer day by day.

460
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,224
We'll have to see
to their leader.

461
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,826
Has that D.S.P. came, or not?

462
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,235
Nowadays, you've always
at a high speed.

463
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,237
That's not good you know.

464
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,172
Whether it's good, or bad,
you carry on with your work.

465
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,039
- Go and meet Daddy.
- Of course, l will.

466
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:43,448
But how about sitting with me,
and sharing a biscuit?

467
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,712
Sorry, but l'm in a hurry.

468
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,450
Hurry always messes up things.

469
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,487
What are you doing in here?
You should stop all that noise.

470
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,829
l've got an idea how
to go about that.

471
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,832
But see this photograph.

472
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,504
- Who is he?
- He's that person...

473
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:06,601
...who's after your money,
and out to mar your reputation.

474
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:10,613
He's trying to hook
your daughter.

475
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:18,249
lf a dandy like you, could not
do it, where does he stand?

476
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:25,492
My thoughts exactly; if there's
anybody worthy of her, it's me!

477
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,494
So...you know everything.

478
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,902
l know he's a mere inspector;

479
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:45,504
And because you're a rich man's
daughter,he's trying to woo you.

480
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,313
No; The fact is...

481
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:54,224
l'm after him.
l told him many times...

482
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,954
...that a career in the
police is very dangerous.

483
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:02,095
We've our own factory,
and l can tell my dad,

484
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,659
And get you an executive post.

485
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,901
But do you know what he said?

486
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:14,009
- l don't want any obligations.
- But that's good.

487
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,705
That you have the tact,
to know the good from the bad.

488
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,914
So, when do l meet this virtuous
and brave young man?

489
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:31,628
You're so nice. l'll get him
to meet you very soon.

490
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,220
And not me?

491
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:38,364
l'll get him to meet you first.
Let's phone him.

492
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,901
Sir, weren't you going to
snip the young man's wings?

493
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,310
Before doing that, ...

494
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,768
... since he's the inspector
in charge of our area...

495
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:54,380
...let him stop
all the strikes, ...

496
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,920
... and if he comes
here after that...

497
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,118
...l'll put him in his proper
place in such a way...

498
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:06,027
That, let alone think, he won't
even dream about my daughter.

499
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,726
l was expecting to hear this,
because l knew it before.

500
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,562
But how did you know, that
daddy knows about it?

501
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,308
You know
our ''All lndia Radio''...

502
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:22,244
l mean our dear D.S.P....

503
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,374
Who's head over heels
in love with you.

504
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,651
When he returned after
having met your father...

505
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,085
... he was grinning
from ear to ear.

506
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,847
So l knew he must've
sung my praise!

507
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,959
Let's not talk about him!
Daddy has called you over.

508
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,893
He has agreed to make
you his son-in-law.

509
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:48,034
Really! l've won over both
father and daughter...

510
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,639
What can he do?
The D.S.P. rotter!

511
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:56,235
Bull to him! Come and
meet daddy, real soon.

512
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,910
- Why soon, l'll come now.
- And listen, Remember...

513
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,051
Today, it's not me, but
my dad, who's awaiting you.

514
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,585
Be right over.
http://yallamazika.info/forum

515
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,223
l'm going to meet my girl.

516
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,293
You manage this golliwog here.

517
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,089
Sir. The D.S.P.
wants to see you.

518
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,789
Go ahead. That's the 2nd time.

519
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,829
He'll give some fantastic idea,
and send you in a spin!

520
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:25,231
This damn man, is a thorn!
Pricks at any and every, angle!

521
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,146
- You've to go to D.D.
lndustries, right now. - Now?

522
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:35,444
There could be a riot there,
between 2 groups of labourers.

523
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,915
The root of all this evil,
is their leader, Chandu!

524
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:44,022
You've to go there and make him,
and his supporters see sense.

525
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:49,188
Do you know who owns
the factory? Mr. Din Dayal.

526
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,496
And he's Shanti's father.

527
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,031
And who's Shanti?
My mental-peace.

528
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:01,836
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir, Absolutely.

529
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,444
l also know,
whom to set straight.

530
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,718
The management is trying
its best ...

531
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,448
... to put a stop to our strike.

532
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:17,021
But we must keep our aims firm,
and our unity steadfast.

533
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,162
For the sake of our rights,...

534
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,859
... we'll continue
our battle peacefully.

535
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,700
We never bow before injustice.

536
00:59:56,292 --> 01:00:00,194
Lock them up in prison, and,
l want a strict vigilance here.

537
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:04,230
lf anybody makes trouble,
shoot them!

538
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,429
Your strike will not end,
as long as l'm here.

539
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,501
Here comes Calamity...
Save us Almighty!

540
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,559
When did you come?

541
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,373
l was so engrossed
in praising you...

542
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,307
... that l didn't
even hear you come.

543
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,707
And neither will you hear me go!
l've come to tell you just this.

544
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:55,315
Don't try to meet me ever again.
You're a liar,a cheat,a traitor!

545
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,117
- My sweetie-pie, where're
you going? - Let go of my hand.

546
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,348
Once l hold a hand,
l don't let it go.

547
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,157
- l'm not your prisoner!
- May be, but you can be one!

548
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,162
This is called
''Handcuffs of love'' ...

549
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,493
... and this,
''Love's handcuffs!''

550
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:19,301
Let me go! You know
nothing but handcuffs!

551
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:27,242
Forget about me; But you've
insulted my dad, too!

552
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:33,720
Your duty has become
a hurdle between us.

553
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,259
l feel like
destroying everything.

554
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,691
- You can't do that.
- Why not? l'll do it right now.

555
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,372
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let me go!

556
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,474
- How childish!
- l'll burn the damn thing!

557
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:21,629
l lifted my hand not at you, but
at your hatred for my uniform!

558
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,977
lt's means, a promise; to me.
An oath; A vow.

559
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,088
l had made this promise,
that day, ...

560
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,785
... when years ago,
my father was killed ...

561
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:47,222
... by people who don't believe
in honesty and integrity.

562
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:53,692
The day, a corrupt officer,
had taken a bribe,....

563
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,368
... and had suppressed
the whole case.

564
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,976
From that day, in the tears of
every poor, helpless person...

565
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,775
... l see my father's blood.

566
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,111
l see my mother.

567
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:15,254
l see my own unhappy childhood,
in their orphaned kids...

568
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,156
... who shout and call out
to me, to fight for justice!

569
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,251
To rebel against crime.

570
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,599
Do you want me to turn
a deaf ear ...

571
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,032
... to the voice
of my conscience?

572
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,831
And sacrifice my ideals in the
fire of crime and atrocities?

573
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,109
You want me to give up
the job, ...

574
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,839
... and die like a coward?

575
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,706
- Do you want ...
- l want nothing.

576
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:43,451
l just ... want you.

577
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,986
Share my life with you.

578
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:10,704
What is it?
Are the pains severe?

579
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,048
- Nothing like that.
- l won't go to work otherwise.

580
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,046
No, you go ahead.

581
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,894
l won't pull through this.

582
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:14,268
My wife has nobody...
except me.

583
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,704
lf you can, take care of her.

584
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,841
Yes, l'll take care of her.

585
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:26,915
But l won't spare the bastard,
who did this to you.

586
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,556
Tell me; Who was it?
What's his name?

587
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,978
Why did you kill Chandu?

588
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:09,183
l was given money to do it,
by Mr. Din Dayal.

589
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,896
You, and here?

590
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,309
Yes. Because it isn't strange
for me ...

591
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,244
... to search for a man
like your father.

592
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,580
What is it? Why this
impatience to see me?

593
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,912
l arrest you for having
murdered the Union Leader.

594
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,416
rossen123 and lapache.info

595
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,090
Better you keep silent and
concentrate on your work.

596
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,430
You insult her in my house
and in my presence?

597
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,098
You're a petty blackmailer.

598
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:57,697
So you're blackmailing me
in this way?

599
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,310
Your put-on love
for her is exposed, ...

600
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,744
... so you stoop
to such low deeds?

601
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,574
Control your tongue.

602
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:10,708
Be thankful l haven't had
you thrown out from here!

603
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,046
Get out!

604
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,922
Else you'll land up some place
where you won't even see water!

605
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,690
l don't want to take
law in my hands.

606
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,764
But the kind of crime
you've done, ...

607
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,561
... is worthy of you
being beaten in public!

608
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,102
Daddy can never do this!

609
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,708
Listen to me...

610
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,710
You're crying over
such a small thing?

611
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,851
Which minister doesn't know him?
lt just needs a phone-call.

612
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,648
Within 1/2 hour,
your father will come home.

613
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,460
Listen to me.
You're misunderstanding me.

614
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,764
l've understood perfectly.

615
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:09,574
This,... your last love letter.
l've got my transfer orders.

616
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:14,110
l've no hand in that. l've
not said anything to anybody.

617
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,648
Big guns don't boom;
They just give signals.

618
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,118
How do l make you see sense?
l just tried to save my father.

619
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,155
lsn't it my duty, as a daughter?

620
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,957
Duty!
Do you even know its meaning?

621
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:35,096
For duty, one has to sacrifice
one's emotions, and relations.

622
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,099
You didn't save your father,
but a criminal; A murderer.

623
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,772
- He's not a criminal!
- He is a criminal!

624
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:44,102
lf he was one, why did
the Court acquit him?

625
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:51,377
Really? Ask that to yourself.
Let your conscience tell you.

626
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:55,220
Ask those ''slaves'', who've sold
their integrity to your father.

627
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,517
How they made a mockery
of my sense of duty.

628
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:02,693
Today you've really shown me,
where l stand.

629
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,162
That you can just push me aside,
whenever you wish.

630
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,105
l really don't know, what
you're rattling on about.

631
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,032
What you've thought and planned.

632
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,707
- You and l are going
the same way. - Of course!

633
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,247
Like a couple of rails, we're
going in the same direction.

634
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,250
We can co-travel,
but never meet!

635
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,489
You're with the criminals,
and l'm with justice.

636
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,460
And for justice, l can
sacrifice both, love and wealth!

637
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,898
l too can sacrifice
everything for you.

638
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,656
Except your father.

639
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,764
Such hollow statements
have no effect on me.

640
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,237
Duty and Love,
just don't go together.

641
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:51,035
l promise l'll never come
in your way of duty.

642
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,312
Trust me.

643
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:56,917
Trust!

644
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,249
Trust is a very delicate mirror.

645
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,250
Once broken
can not be re-joined!

646
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:09,827
And l'm not used to looking
into broken mirrors;

647
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,302
That Chandu's wife just died.

648
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,635
Okay. l'll come right over.

649
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,516
Where are you going,
leaving me all alone?

650
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:34,917
We're like 2 banks of a river
who can never meet.

651
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:41,589
Where are you lost? You
didn't even speak to Shanti?

652
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,026
She always enquired about you;

653
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:49,628
And l always fibbed,
and avoided her.

654
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,103
Today when she came
to know that, ...

655
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,128
... you're back in town
after retiring.

656
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:02,772
She came just to meet you, and
you didn't even speak to her?

657
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,182
May be you're still
angry with her.

658
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,921
Just for my sake, say
''hello'' to her atleast.

659
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,373
You atleast recognised me.

660
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:41,646
How are you?

661
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,913
See for yourself.
l'm right in front of you.

662
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,689
l'm very happy to see you.

663
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:55,424
l used to ask your friend
about your welfare.

664
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:58,698
But...

665
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,629
You never bothered
to enquire about me.

666
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,900
l'll enquire now. How are you?

667
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:14,943
As l was.

668
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,843
And what about your father?
How is he?

669
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:27,488
Regretting. He has been
punished for all his crimes.

670
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,498
l hear, your daughter
is very sweet.

671
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:39,106
- Won't you introduce her?
- Of course l will.

672
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,210
How many kids do you have?

673
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:45,110
My children...

674
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,513
All the children in
the world are mine.

675
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:51,718
Meaning?

676
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:58,319
l ..... didn't marry.

677
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:04,197
But why?

678
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,499
Every ''why'' doesn't
have an answer.

679
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,154
You're drinking again today?
Very bad.

680
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:33,326
Now be a good boy, and sleep.
The class starts at 6 A.M.

681
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,424
Can't sleep.

682
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:40,565
That's what l want to know too.
Why can't you sleep?

683
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,438
Every ''why'' doesn't
have an answer.

684
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,767
Empty your heart of any cobwebs.
You'll get sleep then.

685
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,941
- What's on your mind?
- You won't give up, will you?

686
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,116
l'll tell you.

687
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:07,556
Up on a very high branch...

688
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,366
...ripened a very lovely mango.

689
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:20,103
From one side, came a parrot.

690
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,778
From the other, came a mynah.

691
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,185
The parrot tapped the
mango with his beak.

692
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:36,052
So did the mynah.

693
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,624
As both continued
to prod the fruit...

694
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:45,164
... they began to quarrel.

695
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,839
The parrot spoke the language
he knew since his childhood.

696
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:55,504
And mynah too, spoke
the language she knew.

697
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:06,185
But, the parrot couldn't
follow her language,

698
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,781
And mynah couldn't
understand the parrot.

699
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,831
So they both sat and sulked.

700
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,831
With both their beaks in
the opposite directions.

701
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,435
The parrot...

702
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,048
The son of a gun...

703
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,652
He just flew off.

704
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,056
And mynah, the poor thing...

705
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,235
Just sat as she was

706
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,449
l'm Nilu, lndrajeet's daughter.

707
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,371
Whatever l had heard
about you,...

708
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,068
... you're much more beautiful
and innocent than that.

709
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,705
Come and sit.

710
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,317
l've come to hear the answer
of that certain ''Why'' ....

711
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,115
... which you didn't
even give Papa.

712
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,427
Last night,
he told me a tale of how ...

713
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:55,954
... a parrot and a mynah
got separated.

714
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:02,094
l won't ask you
who was at fault.

715
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,705
Whether you left him,
or vice versa.

716
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,709
l've just come to tell you,
that he's very lonely.

717
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,711
l just wondered, can't the mynah
go back to the parrot again?

718
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,511
You're so naive, dear.

719
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:26,554
You don't know the worldly
and the social norms.

720
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:33,761
When fate separated us,
the world had laughed at us.

721
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,771
lf we come together at this age,
it'll guffaw even more.

722
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,771
lt will affect you badly.

723
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,311
You're getting married soon.

724
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:50,244
We have lived our lives.

725
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:58,583
We have no desire to begin
our lives all over again.

726
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:07,758
lt's better for us all... that,
we keep all our desires...

727
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,437
... locked up in
a cage as memories.

728
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:24,519
After a great thought,
l've come to this decision...

729
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,646
... that l can't marry you.

730
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:31,048
lnfact, l don't want
to marry ever in my life!

731
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,891
Why? Don't ask...

732
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:37,063
What's that you're writing...
Let me see it too...

733
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:43,438
After giving it a great thought,
l've came to this decision...

734
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:47,431
... that l cannot marry you.

735
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,910
Because, every ''why'' doesn't
have an answer.

736
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,120
What's wrong?

737
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:06,693
lf you cry like this
l'll cry too!

738
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:12,431
lf not Vijay, you can tell me,
what's wrong, can't you?

739
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:19,504
l'm really silly.

740
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:24,612
Till now, how didn't l sense,
how lonely my Papa is?

741
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,714
l'll never leave you and go.

742
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,107
l'm not so selfish.

743
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,913
You gave all your life to me...

744
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,586
ln fact you lived just for me.

745
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:40,493
- And l...
- That's why you refuse to wed.

746
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:43,564
l'll never leave you!

747
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,705
A father's house, is never
a daughter's house.

748
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:57,169
Her husband's house is her home.
This house is not yours, dear.

749
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:00,704
This is not my home?
l won't go from here!

750
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,576
Even if you throw me out,
l won't go even then!

751
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:27,433
Which father throws his
own daughter out?

752
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:34,773
Which father wishes to give
away the apple of his eye?

753
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,187
He may be a King or a pauper...

754
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,956
There comes a day when he has
to give away his daughter.

755
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:48,522
lt is not only his duty,
but his wish too.

756
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:58,238
Look; To see you married,
and settled in life.

757
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,765
To see you happy with
a loving husband like Vijay...

758
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,837
... is the success of my life.

759
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,180
My life's ambition
will be fulfilled ...

760
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,685
... and l'll be overjoyed.

761
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,558
Don't you want to give
this happiness to me?

762
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:25,894
l want you to get all the
happiness in the world.

763
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:34,835
''O Maker of this Universe''

764
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:42,648
''After all,''

765
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:53,650
''What kind of a norm
you have made...''

766
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:12,235
''that we have to follow ...''

767
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:22,255
''... this custom ...''

768
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:28,625
''... with a firm heart''

769
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,971
''You are my everything ...

770
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:52,919
''... my dear daughter.''

771
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:01,362
''What more ...''

772
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:05,560
''...can l give you now?''

773
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:15,303
''What more ...''

774
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:22,307
''...can l give you now?''

775
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:35,625
''l have showered you ...''

776
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:45,364
''... with
invaluable blessings...''

777
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:51,978
''... from my heart already.''

778
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:41,795
''Now we've to spend
our every moment together''

779
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:49,426
''Now we've to spend
our every moment together''

780
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:57,843
''l've to live with you,...''

781
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:04,179
''... and die with you too.''

782
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:13,225
''Now our each and every
moment will be together.''

783
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:21,426
''l've to live with you,...''

784
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:28,032
''... and die with you too.''

785
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:36,848
''Now our each and
every moment will be together.''

786
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:22,129
''This feeling will grow,
so will the purity of it.''

787
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:29,501
''Our love will get
younger and younger.''

788
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:38,171
''This feeling will grow,
so will the purity of it.''

789
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:45,516
''Our love will get
younger and younger.''

790
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:54,354
''We have to make this feeling
colourful with hues of love.''

791
01:28:56,030 --> 01:29:02,492
''l want to live ...''

792
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:09,134
''and die with you only now.''

01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:18,011
''Now we've to spend

794
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,625
''l want to stay

01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:02,629
''...on this new path of love.''

''And talk to you by looking
deeply into your eyes.''

01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,800
''l want to stay

798
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,838
''...on this new path of love.''

799
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:26,278
''And talk to you by looking
deeply into your eyes.''

800
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:34,854
''God knows what all will happen;
Even the season is beautiful.''

801
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:43,363
''l want to live with you,...''

802
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:49,867
''... and die with you too now''

803
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:58,512
''Now we've to spend our each
and every moment together.''

804
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:04,417
''Now we've to spend our each
and every moment together.''

805
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,295
We're here.

806
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:27,009
How are you...

807
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,162
Let me go!

808
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,032
Let me go!

809
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:25,569
No!

810
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:44,822
Let him go!

811
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,237
Let me go!

812
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:22,829
No!
Let me go!

813
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,832
No!

814
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:03,770
No!

815
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:14,474
No!

816
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:15,344
No!

817
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,375
Leave me.

818
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,942
What happened, dear?

819
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:54,681
Where's Vijay?

820
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,997
She's my ...

821
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:57,640
They... those people...

822
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:21,796
What?

823
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,646
Yes, sir, And the Minister's
son is involved in it, too.

824
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:39,014
What! My son murdered her,
and raped too?

825
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:42,815
That means he has
got better, eh?

826
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:47,186
But these are
very severe crimes.

827
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:50,354
He's just following
my footsteps!

828
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,398
Because he has to sit
on my chair one day!

829
01:37:53,534 --> 01:38:00,804
To come into politics,l too had
betrayed my mentor.

830
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:05,011
Because that's the
prime rule in disloyalty.

831
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:10,140
- So what do l do now? - Do l
have to tell you that too?

832
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:16,014
Listen. Bury my
son's mistakes, where ...

833
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:22,392
... you usually bury
political ones!

834
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:36,230
No! Get aside.

835
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:39,636
Don't touch her!

836
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:44,608
She's my darling kid.

837
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:48,203
My darling daughter.
Very delicate too.

838
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,510
Don't touch her.

839
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:59,191
The last rites are done,
to free the soul from the body.

840
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:03,786
Why are you becoming a wall
in Nilu's salvation?

841
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:06,957
Control yourself, lndrajeet.

842
01:41:56,410 --> 01:42:00,608
l can bear pain of any kind,

843
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:04,080
But l'm petrified of fire.
l just can't bear burning.

844
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:46,348
l'll throw your
ashes in the Ganges,...

845
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:47,152
... only after l
avenge your death.

846
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:57,167
Well then, have you
closed the case?

847
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,570
l gagged the witness,
nice and proper.

848
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,971
So, naturally, the
case was closed.

849
01:43:03,076 --> 01:43:06,136
- How much ''sweet'' did you get?
- 2 Kgs., sir.

850
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:08,847
1 Kg. has been kept
separately for you.

851
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:12,385
You'll rise well this way.

852
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,351
That man is here again.

853
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:26,195
lndrajeet! He has
made my life hell!

854
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:27,455
Get him out of here!

855
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:29,034
l'll do it right now. Let's go.

856
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:41,941
Sir is very busy.
Come after a few days.

857
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:46,518
No! Today itself.
l've been coming here for days.

858
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,418
- What can l do, if he's busy?
- No time?

859
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:56,659
l'll make time for him
from his own watch.

860
01:43:56,763 --> 01:43:59,231
You can't go in like this.

861
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:01,524
Today l will meet
the Commissioner.

862
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:04,136
- Stop, l say!
- Get aside.

863
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:06,705
Don't make trouble
here. Else...

864
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:08,069
l'm not doing it, you are!

865
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:10,006
l've come to see
him, and l will!

866
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:21,443
You lift your hand
at the Police?

867
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:26,459
What's going on?

868
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:29,187
See how your men
are treating me.

869
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,422
l'm seeing everything.

870
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:34,999
How dare you
hit the police in my office?

871
01:44:35,168 --> 01:44:38,501
You're still so arrogant,
you bastard.

872
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,664
Don't swear at me.

873
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:45,641
You're rid of the uniform, but
you haven't lost your blubber!

874
01:44:45,746 --> 01:44:49,477
Take him and beat
him so badly,

875
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:53,849
That the next time he looks at
a police, his bones will creak!

876
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,286
l'm used to pain for years now.

877
01:44:56,556 --> 01:45:00,014
You can kill my body with all
the atrocities you know.

878
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:03,491
But you cannot throttle my soul,
which calls for justice & law!

879
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:05,861
l'll re-open this case.

880
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:11,766
Call the special squad,
and shut him up for good!

881
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,525
- What are you saying?
- An officer known for his...

882
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,528
...sense of duty...

883
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,031
...cannot be kept in a dark-cell
in this way. lt's injustice.

884
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:19,696
lf you're also kept there,
then it'll be justice l suppose.

885
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:21,933
No, not really.

886
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,533
But, l'll be at least
happy of having ...

887
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:28,080
... lived, and
shared his sorrows.

888
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:35,210
Before retiring if you're
keen to go home, let me know.

889
01:46:35,322 --> 01:46:40,817
l'll send you home and see that
you get all the happiness.

890
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:47,365
You wish to bail him out,
that's fine with me.

891
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:54,197
But hear my idea too. Ask
him to keep his mouth shut!

892
01:46:54,307 --> 01:47:00,075
And if he values his life, ask
him not to refer to any file.

893
01:47:00,213 --> 01:47:03,148
Else, to build
his funeral-pyre,...

894
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:07,118
...would not be very
difficult for the minister.

895
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:33,028
Have some coffee.

896
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:12,561
- Why did you call?
- Re-open the case.

897
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:15,568
And arrest those 4 bastards.

898
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:18,605
You're still on that?

899
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:24,373
lt's burnt and in ashes!
The case is closed and buried.

900
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,178
Not the end, sir.

901
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:33,086
You began this gory story...
l'll end it for you now.

902
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:35,227
You don't even have
strength to walk,...

903
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:37,489
... and still you
talk too much, eh?

904
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:41,863
You'll be the one to repent.

905
01:50:42,002 --> 01:50:47,167
Listen to me.
Forget the past.

906
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:53,041
Those who should've been long
buried, are still alive.

907
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:57,139
l'll give you 7 days more.

908
01:50:57,283 --> 01:50:59,877
And have those 4 dogs punished.

909
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:05,321
Else l'll bury them alive!

910
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,045
''Look! Look everybody...''

911
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:39,057
''What a girl!
a packet of dynamite.''

912
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:43,060
''Have your fill
And live life fully...''

913
01:51:43,163 --> 01:51:46,690
''What a girl!
As intoxicating as the wine''

914
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,561
''Have your fill
and live life fully...''

915
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:54,970
''Put arms around her
and bar her way''

916
01:51:55,075 --> 01:51:57,635
''She mustn't escape
at any cost.''

917
01:51:57,744 --> 01:52:02,181
''She mustn't
escape at any cost''

918
01:52:08,955 --> 01:52:13,688
''Please let me go.''

919
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:10,977
''Silky hair, and limpid eyes
rosy lips and fair cheeks...''

920
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:15,747
''She's stacked beautifully
and just sweet-sixteen.''

921
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:19,389
''Never seen a beauty like you.''

922
01:53:19,526 --> 01:53:26,022
''Silken hair, limpid eyes...
rosy lips and fair cheeks.''

923
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:33,572
''Silky hair, limpid eyes...
rosy lips and fair cheeks''

924
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:56,624
''Silky hair, limpid eyes...
rosy lips and fair cheeks''

925
01:53:56,763 --> 01:54:00,164
''Don't touch me;
l'm very delicate.''

926
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:03,997
''for l'm just sixteen.''

927
01:54:46,145 --> 01:54:49,080
''lf l touch you,
you'll be purified.''

928
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:52,776
''And attract like a
sweet fragrance.''

929
01:54:57,156 --> 01:55:04,028
''lf l touch you...
... you'll be purified''

930
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:07,666
''And attract like
a sweet fragrance''

931
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:16,773
''Fragrant is my youth
and graceful is my gait.''

932
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:24,777
''Silky hair, and limpid eyes
Rosy lips and cheeks so fair.''

933
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:28,411
''Don't touch me
l'm so delicate''

934
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:32,821
''for l'm just sixteen.''

935
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:40,151
''Everyone here is
crazy about me.''

936
01:56:40,326 --> 01:56:43,818
''So whom shall l give
my love to?''

937
01:56:43,963 --> 01:56:51,392
''Everyone is crazy about me, so
whom should l give my love to?''

938
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:55,734
''Yet sweet...
Poisonous,''

939
01:56:55,842 --> 01:57:00,506
''Heartless one, don't you
try to sweet-talk us.''

940
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:07,849
''With silken hair, limpid eyes,
Rosy lips and fair cheeks...''

941
01:57:07,954 --> 01:57:11,651
''Don't you touch me,
for l'm so delicate''

942
01:57:11,758 --> 01:57:15,854
''for l'm just sixteen.''

943
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:03,672
''No... let me go.''

944
01:58:51,157 --> 01:58:53,318
How did you like the
1st scene of the Gory Story?

945
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:57,020
This will cost you dearly.

946
01:58:57,163 --> 01:58:59,393
You can't hide from the law!

947
01:58:59,499 --> 01:59:02,297
You're doing that, not me.

948
01:59:02,401 --> 01:59:05,598
l don't like to kill anyone.

949
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:11,608
l still respect law,
being outside it.

950
01:59:11,744 --> 01:59:16,272
But you ...
being its keeper,...

951
01:59:16,382 --> 01:59:18,407
... are trampling justice
under your feet!

952
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:21,452
l'm in a very delicate position.

953
01:59:21,554 --> 01:59:24,284
You don't understand.
l'm helpless.

954
01:59:24,423 --> 01:59:27,290
l'm between that
devil, the Minister ...

955
01:59:27,426 --> 01:59:30,486
... and the deep sea,
that's you!

956
01:59:30,696 --> 01:59:35,326
Now what do l do? lf you
have any idea tell me.

957
01:59:35,434 --> 01:59:37,459
l have but one for you.

958
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:41,130
Take confessions from the other
three, and have them jailed.

959
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:44,865
Oh no! That's a very bad idea.
This just cannot be.

960
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:47,104
lf that's so,
then be ready to get a...

961
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:50,114
... 2nd gift in form
of a corpse again.

962
02:00:00,259 --> 02:00:02,124
So, what have you for me?

963
02:00:02,461 --> 02:00:05,862
lnvestigations say it
was a bearded man.

964
02:00:05,998 --> 02:00:09,195
Bearded, eh? Bunk!

965
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:13,165
- lt was your friend, lndrajeet.
- That's impossible!

966
02:00:13,472 --> 02:00:16,703
His wounds haven't
even healed yet.

967
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:20,074
He can't even walk!
So how can he kill?

968
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:22,739
He just spoke to
me on the phone.

969
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,679
He confessed to the crime;

970
02:00:24,817 --> 02:00:29,083
Threatened to kill yet again!
And you ask me, how can he kill?

971
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:31,918
Then it's ''War'' now!

972
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,852
Arrest him immediately!

973
02:00:44,537 --> 02:00:46,732
lf l'm a fool,
you're no less!

974
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:51,502
What he's doing now, we
should have done that before.

975
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:54,273
l'll not touch him
at any cost!

976
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:58,643
You're siding with a criminal.
That too at my face?

977
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:06,424
When you can hush up
a genuine case like ...

978
02:01:06,559 --> 02:01:10,051
...that being the
keeper of the law.

979
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:13,597
Then l too can support a man
fighting for truth and justice!

980
02:01:13,733 --> 02:01:17,499
lf anybody's a bastard, sir,
it's not him, but you!

981
02:01:22,842 --> 02:01:25,276
By lifting your hand at me,
you forced me to do the same!

982
02:01:25,544 --> 02:01:28,274
- Know the consequences of this?
- What will you do?

983
02:01:28,547 --> 02:01:31,277
Get me shot, by
charging me falsely?

984
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:34,280
Or hang me in some
seedy hotel room?

985
02:01:34,553 --> 02:01:37,716
Or have me crushed under a
lorry? What will you do?

986
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:40,985
That's all for later.
First l'll dismiss you!

987
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:44,528
- My foot! l resign myself.
- Hurry up then!

988
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:48,031
Rather than work
under a cheapskate like you,...

989
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:50,193
... l'd die for a man like him!

990
02:01:56,609 --> 02:01:59,874
Take this, and please yourself.

991
02:02:07,186 --> 02:02:11,179
Arrest lndrajeet at any cost,
and in any condition!

992
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:13,884
Dead or Alive,
l want him at any cost!

993
02:02:14,026 --> 02:02:17,484
- You'll get him too.
- l will? How?

994
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:24,763
Hairless hound! You think
you'll get him on a platter?

995
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:28,806
Listen. Follow those
3 boys like a shadow.

996
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:31,700
He'll go after them to kill.

997
02:02:32,611 --> 02:02:34,772
l know that!

998
02:02:37,616 --> 02:02:40,176
He killed our friend
right before us...

999
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:42,277
How have we harmed him?

1000
02:02:42,388 --> 02:02:46,552
And tomorrow he'll kill me too!
What will you do then? Nothing!

1001
02:02:46,692 --> 02:02:50,150
My dear Hot-headed
boy, cool it.

1002
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:53,322
l'm with you,
and the police too.

1003
02:02:53,666 --> 02:02:54,792
How will he come?

1004
02:02:54,900 --> 02:03:00,167
That's your problem. l'm going
to the Motor-cycle Race.

1005
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:03,298
Look, don't go.
Are you so indispensable?

1006
02:03:03,609 --> 02:03:06,942
Yes l am. And today l'm certain
l'll win the race!

1007
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:36,445
To cool his heated body, he
doesn't use water, but blood.

1008
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:40,958
He's like a wounded
tiger at the moment.

1009
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:43,995
And it'll give me a great
pleasure to kill this tiger.

1010
02:06:44,096 --> 02:06:48,362
May be, but it's not so easy
to bag this tiger, Minister.

1011
02:06:48,467 --> 02:06:51,402
To kill him, we have to
make him fall in a pit.

1012
02:06:51,537 --> 02:06:55,803
But it's not that
easy to handle him.

1013
02:06:55,941 --> 02:07:02,312
Let's do one thing. Confess
to the crime. How's the idea?

1014
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:04,541
l think l'll have to
get rid of you too!

1015
02:07:04,817 --> 02:07:06,785
My son will go to
jail if he confesses.

1016
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:09,515
And if that happens,
what of this country?

1017
02:07:09,822 --> 02:07:13,189
You're senile;
You've become insane!

1018
02:07:13,325 --> 02:07:14,758
Power of thinking has lessened.

1019
02:07:14,927 --> 02:07:16,918
You praise my foe
at my face, eh?

1020
02:07:17,062 --> 02:07:19,895
Do l teach you the basics of
craftiness all over again?

1021
02:07:19,999 --> 02:07:25,232
Every man has a desire.

1022
02:07:25,337 --> 02:07:27,601
And that has a
thousand foundations.

1023
02:07:27,873 --> 02:07:31,036
Shake one, and the
whole thing trembles.

1024
02:07:31,176 --> 02:07:34,543
This bastard must have
his weak point too.

1025
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:37,548
- Find it.
- He had one, but she died.

1026
02:07:37,883 --> 02:07:40,113
l feel like burying
you right here!

1027
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:44,383
Forget about her? lsn't
there any one alive? Find her.

1028
02:07:44,556 --> 02:07:46,114
He has a friend.

1029
02:07:48,727 --> 02:07:52,823
lt isn't the who resigned...,

1030
02:07:52,965 --> 02:07:58,096
...and asked you to do as
you please with that paper?

1031
02:07:58,237 --> 02:07:59,670
The same rascal!

1032
02:07:59,938 --> 02:08:04,807
From where did l get this man?
lf we use that man,...

1033
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:09,040
...he'll not spare
any one of us.

1034
02:08:09,214 --> 02:08:12,547
- Then what should l do?
- That's not my problem.

1035
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:17,816
l just know, that before
that man kills my son...

1036
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:21,892
... he should be killed.

1037
02:08:22,027 --> 02:08:29,263
lf you're successful, you'll
get a reward, plus a promotion.

1038
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:33,862
But if you fail;
After tonight's rest,

1039
02:08:33,972 --> 02:08:36,236
...tomorrow morning,
you'll have it!

1040
02:08:44,283 --> 02:08:48,686
Who...is it?

1041
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:55,252
No!

1042
02:10:12,738 --> 02:10:15,571
Help! Save me, sister.
This man will kill me.

1043
02:10:28,086 --> 02:10:30,213
- You?
- Yes.

1044
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:34,483
- l'm here to kill your brother.
- But why?

1045
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:39,563
He along with his friends,
raped and murdered my daughter.

1046
02:10:39,665 --> 02:10:45,160
lf he has done such a thing,
why wasn't he arrested?

1047
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:49,570
Just as your daughter had
rummaged around to save you,

1048
02:10:49,675 --> 02:10:54,442
That Minister suppressed the
case, to save them!

1049
02:10:54,546 --> 02:10:57,845
Your daughter managed to get me
transferred at that time.

1050
02:10:58,150 --> 02:11:01,210
But now, no power on
earth can stop me!

1051
02:11:01,386 --> 02:11:04,014
No...no! Forgive him.

1052
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:06,681
l've raised him like a son.

1053
02:11:06,792 --> 02:11:11,456
l beseech you;
l'm living only for him.

1054
02:11:11,663 --> 02:11:13,358
And l'm living only
to kill him!

1055
02:11:13,465 --> 02:11:16,093
But,for you, l'll
give him 2 days more.

1056
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:21,104
Let him give himself up
and confess his crime.

1057
02:11:21,206 --> 02:11:23,265
Else, the 3rd day will be
the last day of his life.

1058
02:11:32,818 --> 02:11:34,376
Don't think me
totally handicapped.

1059
02:11:34,486 --> 02:11:36,886
l can still do a
lot for you both.

1060
02:11:37,155 --> 02:11:39,646
l'll save my son.
Get me the phone.

1061
02:11:39,825 --> 02:11:43,317
You're repeating your mistake,
by saving another criminal.

1062
02:11:43,495 --> 02:11:45,190
- What!
- Yes!

1063
02:11:45,330 --> 02:11:52,202
All these years l've been
living a miserable life.

1064
02:11:52,304 --> 02:11:58,140
Thinking you to
be a decent man,...

1065
02:11:58,243 --> 02:12:03,374
... l saved you, and
lost the man l loved.

1066
02:12:03,548 --> 02:12:08,884
But l realized my folly when
l came to know the truth.

1067
02:12:10,255 --> 02:12:16,888
That you're a greedy
businessman,and a selfish man.

1068
02:12:17,195 --> 02:12:19,686
You had Chandu murdered!

1069
02:12:19,865 --> 02:12:22,800
That's why God punished you!

1070
02:12:22,901 --> 02:12:25,563
He made you an invalid!

1071
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:30,608
What didn't l do for you both?
l looked after the business.

1072
02:12:30,742 --> 02:12:37,147
Sacrificed my own happiness,...
for you, and this wretch here.

1073
02:12:37,282 --> 02:12:38,840
Enough, child.

1074
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:45,322
Your charges, your taunts...
l just can't bear it.

1075
02:12:45,424 --> 02:12:48,951
l realise my ill-doings...

1076
02:12:55,267 --> 02:12:57,963
Sister; Please forgive me.

1077
02:12:58,270 --> 02:13:02,138
l know l've hurt you.

1078
02:13:02,274 --> 02:13:06,301
l'm very ashamed of my deeds.

1079
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:10,370
Please save me, sister.

1080
02:13:10,515 --> 02:13:15,214
l'm ready to
take my punishment.

1081
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:17,515
Since he hasn't
committed a murder,...

1082
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:19,556
... there's no question
of punishing him.

1083
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:23,355
There is, sir,
and an answer too!

1084
02:13:23,562 --> 02:13:26,963
To save a
Minister's reputation...

1085
02:13:27,265 --> 02:13:32,293
- You are suppressing the facts!
- Do you have any proof?

1086
02:13:32,404 --> 02:13:37,637
l'm confessing, that l did
murder! lsn't that enough?

1087
02:13:37,743 --> 02:13:42,578
Not at all. Who gave you
this bogus idea anyway?

1088
02:13:45,283 --> 02:13:48,343
The Law doesn't punish
just on a confession.

1089
02:13:48,487 --> 02:13:52,719
One needs proof and
witnesses for that.

1090
02:13:57,429 --> 02:14:02,196
We have no report on this case.

1091
02:14:02,334 --> 02:14:07,465
And l don't have the right
to arrest an innocent man.

1092
02:14:08,273 --> 02:14:12,004
But you have the right to burn
a file to cinders; Right?

1093
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:14,939
That is somebody
else's dialogue!

1094
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:20,980
l think the embers of your love
are still burning for him.

1095
02:14:21,286 --> 02:14:25,450
Shut up!
What the hell do you think?

1096
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:27,785
lf you burn the truth,
will it really die?

1097
02:14:28,326 --> 02:14:34,231
Truth rises like the Phoenix
from the fire, and frees itself!

1098
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:37,494
l'll take this
case up to the C.M.

1099
02:14:37,602 --> 02:14:41,003
My brother will be legally
punished for his crimes.

1100
02:14:41,139 --> 02:14:43,664
He'll not die at the
hands of lndrajeet!

1101
02:14:43,775 --> 02:14:46,938
Are you serious
about confessing?

1102
02:14:53,151 --> 02:14:55,449
Are you fooled too?

1103
02:14:55,554 --> 02:14:58,717
l was just acting,
to fool my sister.

1104
02:14:58,824 --> 02:15:01,224
You make fun of a sister,
who's like a mother to you?

1105
02:15:01,393 --> 02:15:02,724
You make a fool out of her?

1106
02:15:02,861 --> 02:15:05,557
From whom did you
inherit this callousness?

1107
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:08,824
From you of course. l swear!

1108
02:15:08,967 --> 02:15:12,300
Shameless being!
Ungrateful wretch.

1109
02:15:12,404 --> 02:15:16,272
She put her life at
stake to save you.

1110
02:15:16,374 --> 02:15:20,276
And you ridicule her?

1111
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:22,505
Why are you shouting so?

1112
02:15:22,647 --> 02:15:24,274
Ever since you've
become an invalid,...

1113
02:15:24,382 --> 02:15:25,872
...you've become batty too!

1114
02:15:25,984 --> 02:15:28,350
Do you really
think he'll kill us?

1115
02:15:28,453 --> 02:15:30,944
He'll die like a dog himself!

1116
02:15:31,056 --> 02:15:33,650
My brother's
willing to confess,...

1117
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:35,717
... but that Commissioner...

1118
02:15:35,861 --> 02:15:37,795
Enough!
l don't wish to hear more.

1119
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:41,592
You couldn't get him punished.
Now l'll punish him myself.

1120
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:46,067
Give me 2 days more...
l'll get him...

1121
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:49,106
No! l can't give you
even a moment more!

1122
02:15:49,407 --> 02:15:53,002
Don't add fuel to
the fire in my heart!

1123
02:15:53,111 --> 02:15:56,478
Don't fan the fire of
my daughter's funeral-pyre!

1124
02:16:03,355 --> 02:16:09,294
l can understand your feelings.

1125
02:16:09,427 --> 02:16:14,330
Because, l too have reared
my brother, as my own kid.

1126
02:16:14,466 --> 02:16:18,459
l beg you for his life.

1127
02:16:18,603 --> 02:16:21,970
Don't kill him.

1128
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:31,482
Tell me, whose door l should
knock on, to have him punished.

1129
02:16:31,616 --> 02:16:36,144
l'm prepared to stake
my life for it.

1130
02:16:39,724 --> 02:16:43,785
You are surrounded.

1131
02:16:43,929 --> 02:16:49,834
The game is up for you now.

1132
02:16:50,001 --> 02:16:55,200
lf you save him today,
tomorrow your brother may die.

1133
02:16:55,473 --> 02:16:59,409
And if he dies today,
your brother will be saved.

1134
02:16:59,544 --> 02:17:03,605
Now decide whom
you want to save.

1135
02:17:03,748 --> 02:17:05,716
This is my final warning.

1136
02:17:05,817 --> 02:17:09,947
lf you don't move away,
while l count upto 10...

1137
02:17:10,088 --> 02:17:13,353
You'll be riddled
with bullets too.

1138
02:17:13,458 --> 02:17:16,689
- One, two...
- l know who's behind this.

1139
02:17:16,861 --> 02:17:20,160
They can't shoot me.

1140
02:17:20,465 --> 02:17:24,196
Take these keys,
and escape in my car.

1141
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:29,202
For God's sake...

1142
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:21,459
He escaped!

1143
02:18:28,199 --> 02:18:30,827
Welcome!

1144
02:18:30,935 --> 02:18:34,268
Have you returned seeing
the death of your lover-boy?

1145
02:18:34,539 --> 02:18:41,672
l think she didn't get
any wood to cremate him.

1146
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:49,584
She's a very emotional woman.

1147
02:18:49,688 --> 02:18:52,919
- She's a misfit among us...
- Yes l am!

1148
02:18:53,024 --> 02:18:57,893
But, l am among you;
that too as your sister.

1149
02:18:57,996 --> 02:19:04,060
Whether she's a mother,
wife or a daughter,

1150
02:19:04,202 --> 02:19:07,467
A woman is destined to weep!

1151
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:10,804
Even if she's the
mother of God,

1152
02:19:10,909 --> 02:19:12,774
She's fated to
cry her heart out!

1153
02:19:12,877 --> 02:19:14,811
My heart really
bleeds for her,...

1154
02:19:14,946 --> 02:19:17,881
...after listening
to this woeful tale!

1155
02:19:18,016 --> 02:19:21,543
Rascal! lnstead of pitying me,

1156
02:19:21,653 --> 02:19:24,144
You better worry
about your life.

1157
02:19:24,255 --> 02:19:29,056
l'll tell him myself to
kill rascals like you!

1158
02:19:29,227 --> 02:19:32,822
That means he's still alive.

1159
02:19:32,997 --> 02:19:37,525
And she knows where
the joker's hiding!

1160
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:42,902
O sweet sister, please
tell me where your Romeo is!

1161
02:19:43,007 --> 02:19:48,343
ln your mind that is scared;
And in my heart, full of love!

1162
02:19:48,613 --> 02:19:51,207
He's hiding in my every breath!

1163
02:19:51,316 --> 02:19:54,547
To hell with all that!
Tell me his whereabouts.

1164
02:19:54,686 --> 02:19:56,620
Else, l'll throttle you!

1165
02:19:56,721 --> 02:20:01,852
Do what you like, but l won't
talk! What will you do?

1166
02:20:08,666 --> 02:20:12,158
Don't hit my child!
Hit me if you wish.

1167
02:20:12,303 --> 02:20:15,795
l'm the real culprit for having
sired a serpent like him!

1168
02:20:16,007 --> 02:20:18,601
My dear friend, l know
l couldn't get her to talk,...

1169
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:23,613
She's your sister
after all, thus,...

1170
02:20:23,715 --> 02:20:29,017
...l can't really
manhandle her.

1171
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:32,214
Let's hand her over
to our lnspector.

1172
02:20:32,357 --> 02:20:34,791
He'll know how to
handle her. Let's go...

1173
02:20:50,275 --> 02:20:53,403
How this flower-like
face, droops!

1174
02:20:53,511 --> 02:20:58,448
The rose has turned
into a marigold?

1175
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:03,755
Now tell us,
where your murdering,...

1176
02:21:03,755 --> 02:21:07,851
...coward, fugitive
lover is hiding.

1177
02:21:08,726 --> 02:21:11,251
Where have you
hidden him, l say!

1178
02:21:11,396 --> 02:21:17,028
Do what you like.
l won't tell you anything!

1179
02:21:17,135 --> 02:21:21,401
- The Minister's here.
- What? Here? Now?

1180
02:21:21,506 --> 02:21:24,202
These politicians never
let us do our duty properly!

1181
02:21:24,309 --> 02:21:27,676
This is your duty?

1182
02:21:27,779 --> 02:21:29,679
l had read about
Police atrocities,...

1183
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:31,749
...but l never believed it.

1184
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:36,344
But seeing is believing.
Such atrocity... on a woman?

1185
02:21:36,454 --> 02:21:39,981
lt's like torturing
one's Motherland!

1186
02:21:40,091 --> 02:21:43,993
Untie her...go on.

1187
02:21:44,128 --> 02:21:46,790
l'll have you dismissed.
Kicked out!

1188
02:21:46,931 --> 02:21:50,492
l apologise to you, dear.

1189
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:52,736
On behalf of the
Police Department.

1190
02:21:52,837 --> 02:21:54,737
The portfolio l hold,
and the whole country.

1191
02:21:54,873 --> 02:21:59,742
Come home with me, my dear.
There! Good girl.

1192
02:21:59,878 --> 02:22:04,474
lf you really think
l'm a sympathizer,...

1193
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:08,185
...just tell me his address.

1194
02:22:08,753 --> 02:22:10,721
l promise l'll
stand like a wall...

1195
02:22:10,822 --> 02:22:13,290
...and stop every
legal bullet fired.

1196
02:22:13,424 --> 02:22:16,689
l'll take care of him, and
have his sentence reduced.

1197
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:19,728
Since you're like
a daughter to me,...

1198
02:22:19,831 --> 02:22:21,264
...surely he means
something to me too.

1199
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:24,733
Come on, tell me.
Tell me where he is.

1200
02:22:24,869 --> 02:22:30,205
Okay.
l'll take you to him myself.

1201
02:22:30,341 --> 02:22:35,005
l'll just tidy
myself a bit, first.

1202
02:22:35,146 --> 02:22:37,546
Of course! Come with me.

1203
02:23:20,858 --> 02:23:23,793
For whose life l
had beseeched you,...

1204
02:23:23,895 --> 02:23:27,490
... they too are
after my blood.

1205
02:23:27,865 --> 02:23:32,199
Don't ever leave me.

1206
02:23:32,303 --> 02:23:36,364
l've nobody but
you in this world.

1207
02:23:45,583 --> 02:23:50,953
That was a queer turning in
life, when we separated.

1208
02:23:51,089 --> 02:23:56,527
That time we were free to meet,
yet didn't meet for years!

1209
02:23:56,628 --> 02:24:00,792
This too is another such turn,
where we've met again.

1210
02:24:00,898 --> 02:24:06,598
But without knowing how many
moments or minutes we have!

1211
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:10,204
No matter how little
time we have,...

1212
02:24:10,308 --> 02:24:14,608
...for me it'll be
like centuries!

1213
02:24:19,384 --> 02:24:20,817
You hoodwink,
the whole world;...

1214
02:24:20,918 --> 02:24:23,079
...she did the same
to you and escaped.

1215
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:25,951
l still haven't told
you the real thing.

1216
02:24:26,090 --> 02:24:30,390
l'll arrest both the boys, and
put them in the Central Jail.

1217
02:24:30,528 --> 02:24:34,362
l'll break your neck now.
You'll jail my son?

1218
02:24:34,465 --> 02:24:39,164
There's no safer place for
them than this jail, sir.

1219
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:43,604
lt's a million-dollar idea.
l gave it to you, free of cost.

1220
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:48,372
l'll have them put in there,
under some false charge.

1221
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,674
Let alone our foe,...

1222
02:24:50,948 --> 02:24:52,882
...even the Angel of Death
can't bat his wings there!

1223
02:24:53,017 --> 02:25:00,150
Good! People kill,
and go to a jail.

1224
02:25:00,258 --> 02:25:02,192
But they'll go
there for protection.

1225
02:25:08,733 --> 02:25:10,633
This is the Minister here.
Who's calling?

1226
02:25:10,935 --> 02:25:14,496
- lnderjit here.
- Yes?

1227
02:25:14,605 --> 02:25:17,472
The final scene of this play
will soon be staged.

1228
02:25:17,575 --> 02:25:22,205
The Death-scene of your son,
and also, Din-Dayal's son.

1229
02:25:22,346 --> 02:25:26,305
Even your thoughts can't
reach that far now!

1230
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:29,352
Where man's
thoughts don't reach,...

1231
02:25:29,487 --> 02:25:31,978
...Death always
reaches, sir.

1232
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:38,495
And we put Death to sleep too.
Just try and get in there.

1233
02:27:11,355 --> 02:27:12,982
Let sir go in.

1234
02:27:45,056 --> 02:27:48,685
Hello, sir.
The Minister has sent me.

1235
02:27:51,696 --> 02:27:53,493
Have a seat.

1236
02:27:53,631 --> 02:27:57,431
Which Operation did you say?

1237
02:28:01,038 --> 02:28:05,737
- Hasn't Death knocked as yet?
- What!

1238
02:28:06,043 --> 02:28:09,171
- That bearded guy.
- ls he expected here?

1239
02:28:09,380 --> 02:28:11,780
That's what he
told the Minister.

1240
02:28:12,049 --> 02:28:13,778
Get the Commissioner please.

1241
02:28:25,363 --> 02:28:27,297
l'm the Jailor here, sir.

1242
02:28:27,431 --> 02:28:31,231
Your special officer...
What's your name?

1243
02:28:31,402 --> 02:28:33,233
Give that to me.

1244
02:28:33,404 --> 02:28:37,841
- lt's me, Sir.
- Who?

1245
02:28:38,109 --> 02:28:40,669
You recognised my voice!

1246
02:28:40,778 --> 02:28:45,044
l've got inside the jail.

1247
02:28:45,182 --> 02:28:47,810
The hell you are!

1248
02:28:48,119 --> 02:28:52,351
Okay; you have your say first.
Then l'll have mine.

1249
02:28:52,456 --> 02:28:55,084
You're not in a jail,
but near your death!

1250
02:28:55,226 --> 02:28:59,094
You've no idea of the arms
and the ammunition there!

1251
02:28:59,196 --> 02:29:02,825
You'll not be spared.

1252
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:06,558
My turn now, l'll
tell both of them...

1253
02:29:06,671 --> 02:29:08,502
...that their troubles
will end soon.

1254
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:11,506
End of the case. ...All over.

1255
02:29:11,642 --> 02:29:16,807
- l'll come and finish you off!
- Yes, come if you wish.

1256
02:29:17,114 --> 02:29:20,550
And collect the corpses too.
And tell the Minister, that...

1257
02:29:20,651 --> 02:29:24,519
He won't need to hood-wink,
nor cover-up anymore!

1258
02:29:27,959 --> 02:29:31,861
l think he too will come here
within 15-20 minutes.

1259
02:29:32,163 --> 02:29:35,655
l'll get along with my work
then. l'll meet the prisoners.

1260
02:29:35,833 --> 02:29:38,358
Thank you for
your co-operation.

1261
02:29:38,502 --> 02:29:40,868
lt's like being jailed
in a 5-star Hotel!

1262
02:29:41,172 --> 02:29:43,106
We must have some change!

1263
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:47,108
My dear ''loose-top'', we'll have
that too. Here, drink this.

1264
02:29:47,244 --> 02:29:49,576
That Dracula isn't
here as yet;...

1265
02:29:49,714 --> 02:29:51,181
He comes just by
the smell of this.

1266
02:29:51,282 --> 02:29:52,909
Where will he go?

1267
02:29:53,184 --> 02:29:58,451
When he smells this, he'll
come here on his own.

1268
02:30:07,231 --> 02:30:10,894
Even if crime hides in
the depths of hell,...

1269
02:30:11,002 --> 02:30:14,665
Punishment follows it there.

1270
02:30:18,042 --> 02:30:19,669
You've committed such
an obnoxious crime,

1271
02:30:19,777 --> 02:30:23,577
...that even Death is
too lenient a punishment.

1272
02:30:23,681 --> 02:30:26,172
But don't forget,...

1273
02:30:26,283 --> 02:30:30,242
...every crime's final
punishment is Death alone!

1274
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:19,386
Didn't l tell you, this stupid
idea will not work here?

1275
02:32:19,563 --> 02:32:22,726
Now, l'm your death!

1276
02:34:32,496 --> 02:34:34,691
Break the lock!

1277
02:37:14,958 --> 02:37:18,189
Your end is destined
at my hands!

1278
02:37:18,328 --> 02:37:21,058
You killed my son;...

1279
02:37:21,165 --> 02:37:23,963
Now l won't let you immerse
your daughter's ashes.

1280
02:38:49,152 --> 02:38:52,747
Let me go.

1281
02:40:47,237 --> 02:40:52,504
O Lord! You saw their crime,
and my revenge too.

1282
02:40:52,609 --> 02:40:56,067
l don't know whether
l've sinned, or not.

1283
02:40:56,213 --> 02:40:59,376
But now l'm at peace.

1284
02:40:59,583 --> 02:41:05,385
The rest will be decided,
in your Court now.

1285
