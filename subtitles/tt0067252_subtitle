1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,200
'Mr. Ranjit Mallick, you said
you got your degree in... '

2
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,500
'Which year did you say? '

3
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,700
'Mr. Ranjit Mallick, what is the
biggest event of the day? '

4
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
'Yes, I mean today.'

5
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,300
'Mr. Ranjit Mallick, you
say you read novels.'

6
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,100
'Did you read 'Bibad'
by Samar S. Bose? '

7
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Mother, make it fast.
I am getting late.

8
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
You didn't take bath, did you?
- No, I just washed my face.

9
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
You said that you weren't
feeling well.

10
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,700
It's nothing. Just the
change in season.

11
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,300
Mother, give it to me fast.
- In a moment, dear.

12
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
I thought I will go early today,
but I am late today as well.

13
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,200
It's alright...
- Give it to me.

14
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
The way things are going
you will reach there...

15
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,200
...and find that the milk-van
hasn't reached yet.

16
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Mother, give me Ranju's tea.

17
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,000
Take some biscuits as well.
- He doesn't like to eat...

18
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,200
...anything in the morning.
- Bring it here once.

19
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,100
I forgot to add sugar.

20
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Mother, how many times did
you call your lord...

21
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
...since morning? Today Ranju is...

22
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
For him I am calling
Him all over again.

23
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's see what happens.

24
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Ranju. Ranju. Wake up. Wake up.

25
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
You are getting late.

26
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
What happened? I brought
tea for you. Get up.

27
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,300
Did you forget where
you are going today?

28
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
You are still sleeping?

29
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Wake up.
- I am awake.

30
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,400
You didn't wake up. Just get up.

31
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,300
The tea's getting cold.
- Keep it there.

32
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Just get up.
Fine. I am leaving.

33
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,200
Sister. - Not now. I will
listen to you later on.

34
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Mother, do you know
what the salary is?

35
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Do you know how many times
you told me that?

36
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,500
Don't say it again and again,
son. I feel scared.

37
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
If it doesn't work out at the end...

38
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,000
You know what uncle Shekhar says!

39
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
You know he didn't forget anything.

40
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,000
He said... Your father
did so much for me...

41
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,300
...when he was alive, so why
can't I do this much for you!

42
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,500
Uncle Shekhar arranged everything
so well that...

43
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,700
The interview is now just
a matter of formality.

44
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you know what the salary will be?

45
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
You will get the double of what
you are getting now. Happy?

46
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,200
Wrong. It's even more than that.

47
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Plus something, plus
commission. Huge.

48
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Come here. Come here, sir.

49
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,100
The prince of Babughat, Hilsa fish.

50
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
You won't get it anywhere else.

51
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
It's too high a price.

52
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,700
Uncle Shekhar.

53
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,600
Uncle Shekhar. Uncle Shekhar.

54
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
When did you come?
- Just now.

55
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
But you buy the fish at that
end the market, don't you?

56
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
But you are here?
- I had a fight with four fishermen.

57
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,700
I can't go there now. Ok, listen,
I am happy that I met you.

58
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Your hair... You should...

59
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
You should just do something about
this hair. Come with me.

60
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,200
And remember it. Remember that
it's a foreign company.

61
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,200
It's a sales-job. Smartness.

62
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Smartness is the real thing,
did you get me?

63
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
Will I...
- Yes, you can.

64
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,400
No, will I get the job? - I think so.

65
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,300
When you will wear suit
and boot and go to them...

66
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,500
Isn't anything else required?
Just smartness will do?

67
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,700
No, I mean...

68
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,200
Your hair must be a bit...
It should be a bit...

69
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Ok. I will trim it before going.
- Yes, you should do it.

70
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
You are a smart kid.

71
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,600
I am dealing with these foreigners
since 23 years.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,300
They are from Scotland.

73
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,100
I have good relation with them...
I already told you about it.

74
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,500
At what price did he give?
- I shall go then, uncle.

75
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Ok, go. You must come at 3 O' clock.

76
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,700
I will be there. You need not worry.

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Come at 2:30. At 2:30.

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh God! It seems to be a
festival of haircutting.

79
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
It's almost over. - No, mister.
My fish has started decaying.

80
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,000
What's the matter? Are
you unable to tie it?

81
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,600
No, sister. It's quite difficult.

82
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,600
This knot is giving
me a huge trouble.

83
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Turn it again.
- Here it is.

84
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Yes.
- Ok. - And do it one more time.

85
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh God!
- Just one more time.

86
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Sister, I can't do it. This
is not my cup of tea.

87
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,500
You just can't give up so
easily. Give it to me.

88
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,100
Take it.
- Let me see if I can tie it.

89
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh God! It's no wrinkled.

90
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,600
It's just a rehearsal.
I will manage it there.

91
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,800
Will you manage it?
- Yes.

92
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,800
I will tie it properly.
- Hold it.

93
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Wait. I will tie it on me.
- Ok. Tie it.

94
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
You are good at all these things.

95
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,800
And do not worry about the tie.
You know Dilip, don't you?

96
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,100
My friend Dilip. I will
get one from him.

97
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,700
He has a great collection.
Really a great collection.

98
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Is it done?
- Almost.

99
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Wait a minute.
- You are also just like me. - No.

100
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,000
Dilip's uncle also has
a great collection.

101
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
And here it is.

102
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Look here. So...

103
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,700
You will learn it soon. See this.

104
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Sister, you are genius.
- Now get up. Get up.

105
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Get up. Stand here.

106
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
It's a hot country. These
things are not needed here.

107
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Tie this. Tie that. Get a noose.

108
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,300
Button the shirt till the neck.
- Let me see.

109
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Turn around. This way.

110
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
What's this! You didn't
wear a shirt?

111
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
I will manage it then.
You just tie it.

112
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Just bend a bit.
- Ok. - Good boy.

113
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,700
You are so tall. - How long
will I have to stay this way?

114
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Just a moment.
- Just keep on watching.

115
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,600
In the coming days...
In the coming days...

116
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,000
...I will work day and night,
in my vests.

117
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,100
First-class.

118
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,600
Great.

119
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,500
Sister, the tie-problem is solved.

120
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
The hair isn't done yet.

121
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,400
It's not needed. Sister,
arrange my shoes.

122
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,200
Get it polished by the cobbler
across the road.

123
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,600
I will give you the shoes.

124
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,100
The sole. Will it be necessary?
- Ranju. - Coming.

125
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,600
Take it. You asked me for
a pair of socks. - Fine.

126
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
I too have a pair of socks.
It's just a stand-bye.

127
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,700
What's this! What have you done!

128
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
I am becoming a foreigner.

129
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,200
Mother, my black shoes.
- I'm taking it out.

130
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
What are you doing there?
- They are in this box.

131
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,600
In the box?
- Yes. You never wear them.

132
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,100
If we keep the shoes outside,
they would've gone ruined.

133
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,100
So you kept the shoes in the box?
- Yes.

134
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
Come here and help me out.
I am unable to open it.

135
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Can we open it here? Move
aside. Move aside.

136
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
What do you want to do?
- I will take it out.

137
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Ok, you hold it that way.
I will hold it this way.

138
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,100
Keep it down.

139
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Oh God! - So mother, you
kept the shoes inside it?

140
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes. - To protect them, so that
they shouldn't get ruined.

141
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
You are a master of sarcasm.

142
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But when you are in trouble
you don't go to anyone...

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,100
...except your mother.

144
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,400
It's surprising. What have you done!

145
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,300
No one can get anything useful here.

146
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
I didn't ask you to search
anything. I am doing it.

147
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Let me search it.

148
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
It was right here.
- You won't get it.

149
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,700
You won't get anything here.

150
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,300
It's my concern if I will
get it or not. You may go.

151
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
Do not trouble me. It's
sufficient for you...

152
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
...if you get the shoes, right?
- No, it's not enough.

153
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Leave this place.
- It's surprising.

154
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,500
You turned the entire house into
a dustbin with all this...

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,100
Move aside.
- What are you doing, Ranjit!

156
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Not even a single word. Move aside.
- What are you doing!

157
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,500
Ranjit, what are you doing!

158
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
What are you doing! Do you
want to break them or what!

159
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,500
I will sell them.
- I won't let you sell anything.

160
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,700
I will sell them... No, it's a
good plate. What are you doing!

161
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,800
Ranju! What are you doing, Ranju!

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,100
Can't you do all these
things later on?

163
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,500
I won't let you turn this
house into a dustbin.

164
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,200
What rubbish are you talking!

165
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
Mother, leave him. Let him
do whatever he wants to.

166
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,700
Bottle. Box. Box.

167
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,100
Tin. Here's my shoe.

168
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Mother, did you see
your son's attitude?

169
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Even before he got the job.

170
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,500
No, I think you can't
control your son now.

171
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,600
I need not. I need not
control him anymore.

172
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,600
If the girl who should control
him controls him well...

173
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Listen, does Bulbul know...

174
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,700
What! - What else? About today's
matter... Does she know that?

175
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,200
About what? About what?

176
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
I am talking about your job.

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,300
You want to hear it again
and again, right?

178
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Mother, take out my dye-cleaning
bill of Band Box.

179
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,700
I have to bring my clothes
after shaving.

180
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
What's the matter you
didn't say anything!

181
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,500
Does she know about it?

182
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sister, did you again cut
the pencil with my blade?

183
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,200
How would I know that it's your
blade? - You don't know that?

184
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
You are kidding me? Sister,
what's wrong with you!

185
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,000
I pay for these blades and you
waste them in this way...

186
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,000
Alright. Alright. I will
buy you another blade.

187
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,000
As if it's not some blade,
but it's gold or something.

188
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,400
Sister, don't talk rubbish.
Listen to me.

189
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
There's a shop across the road.
You'll get a blade there.

190
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
You can buy one from
there if you wish.

191
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,500
Just don't touch my blade.
That's all.

192
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Ranju, I'm not getting the bill.
- Oh God!

193
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
What happened? Did you get it?

194
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,500
It's a small slip. 'Band Box' is
written on it in bold letters.

195
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,500
A full suit and I guess there
was a shirt as well.

196
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes, I got it, but did you
really give me the bill?

197
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,200
Mother, I give all the laundry
bills to you, do I not?

198
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, you are right.
- Whenever I need them...

199
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,400
...I take the bill from you, do
I not? - That's true, but...

200
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,400
So you are saying that
you gave me the bill?

201
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,400
So you lost it? - Why would I
lose it? It must be somewhere.

202
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,200
But you are getting them.
- I keep all the slips here.

203
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,400
It's not here. That means you lost
it. - No. Why would I lose it?

204
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,800
You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

205
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,600
Then where has it gone?

206
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
O mother! Will you please
change your habit...

207
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,800
...of putting all the slips here!
- Ranju, behave yourself!

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
As if no one else does
a job. The bill's more than...

209
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,200
...three-month old. What's
the big deal if it's lost!

210
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,900
If we don't get that bill,
we won't get the clothes...

211
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,100
...from the laundry, did you get me!

212
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,900
And if I don't get them... God!
It's a foreign company.

213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We have to look smart. Smartness
is the real thing.

214
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,100
Here it is.

215
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
When were you supposed
to bring your clothes?

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,300
I was about to bring them
before three months.

217
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,500
This wouldn't have happened
if you brought them on time.

218
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,300
But where would I keep them?
Where's the place?

219
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
There are insects all over here.

220
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Here it is. Wasn't I checking
properly all this while?

221
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,100
Here it is.

222
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,400
What's going on!

223
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,600
What's going on! - Sir, it's
not her mistake, it's mine.

224
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,600
You might be a bit puzzled,
am I right?

225
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Look, I won't hide
anything from you.

226
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,000
The photo that are you are
Looking at in the magazine is mine.

227
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
Yes. But you were staring
at me in such a way...

228
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,500
...that I was feeling a bit...

229
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,000
Look, I am not an actor.

230
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,100
I am not a star. I am
really not a star.

231
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,600
My name is Ranjit Mallick. I
work in a weekly newspaper.

232
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,300
I live in Bhavanipur.
It's a small job.

233
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,000
Proof-reading. From proof-reading
to almost everything...

234
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,300
...that happens in the press,
even getting advertisements.

235
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,300
Mine is quite an uneventful life.

236
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
And Mr. Mrinal Sen... The
person who makes movies...

237
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,000
...he liked it a lot. He told
me that he will follow me...

238
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,200
...with his camera
from dawn to dusk...

239
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Tell me does it really
make any sense?

240
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
He said that I need not
do anything special.

241
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,100
I just need to do be myself.
Just imagine.

242
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
I told Mr. Mrinal Sen that I was
about to go to an interview...

243
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,300
...for a prestigious job.
Yes, today itself.

244
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
He heard it and said fine!
Lt'll be a good story.

245
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,100
You didn't understand it? Things
will get a bit interesting...

246
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
...with me in it. - Cut.

247
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,700
Did you see them? How
they are running!

248
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Anyway, they have left. Ok,
I shall tell you something.

249
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Whatever you saw till now
is not completely real.

250
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,700
I am real. I am going
on a tram. That's real.

251
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
You saw my photo. That's also real.

252
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,200
And the matter regarding my
interview is completely real.

253
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,000
And you saw my mother...
She's not my mother.

254
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,400
She's an actress.

255
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
You asked me to bring
Mother Lakshmi's photo.

256
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
See this. I got it framed.

257
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,000
And see this.
A sari for Durga. See this.

258
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
What's there to worry about!

259
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,000
In this condition what my
mother would've done...

260
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,700
...she is also doing the same.

261
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,100
But trust me
I am my mother's child.

262
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,700
I am just my natural self.

263
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,000
And she's my sister.
She got married an year ago...

264
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,700
...but her husband abandoned her.

265
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
He's a horrible person.
Just horrible.

266
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,000
And these days he's having
an affair with...

267
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,600
Anyway, leave it.
I am in a hurry.

268
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,800
I have to go to press. I haven't
given up my job yet.

269
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,400
I have some responsibilities.
Did you get me! Ok, goodbye.

270
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,100
What's this! Do you
call this cinema?

271
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,100
This is my story.
This is your story.

272
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Long live...
- Revolution!

273
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Long live...
- Revolution!

274
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,500
Long live...
- Revolution!

275
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Long live...
- Revolution!

276
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,700
Long live...
- Revolution!

277
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,600
Long live...
- Revolution!

278
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Long live...
- Revolution!

279
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:59,000
In the year 1961 when
the communist party...

280
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,000
...was divided in two parts...

281
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,700
...my father has died in that
particular year.

282
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Before his death, in
deep agony he said...

283
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,000
...that after whatever has happened...

284
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:28,000
...communism won't return...

285
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:35,200
...even after 25 years.

286
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Today is the last day.
Did you get me!

287
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,200
I am getting a great job.

288
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,000
You didn't say anything?
It's a great thing.

289
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,200
You will get a tip. Go. Go away.

290
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,400
...communism won't return
even after 25 years.

291
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,500
Things took a drastic turn
in just five years.

292
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,700
History will take its own course.

293
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,600
There will be revolution.

294
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Someone is fearful of
this revolution...

295
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,600
Mithu. See this. Read this news.

296
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,000
The president of the Calcutta
laundry union...

297
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
...is announcing it in deep regret...

298
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,000
...that in protest of
the terrible treatment meted out...

299
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,000
...to the employees from tomorrow
morning... - That means from today.

300
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,600
...we are calling for a strike
for indefinite time.

301
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,100
What will happen now?

302
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,500
Why are you laughing, Mithu!
Does anyone laugh like that!

303
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,500
It will do? It will do?

304
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,200
Mother, see this.

305
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,100
Father's... It's too big for him.

306
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Leave it. Get lost.

307
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,300
Great.

308
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,100
It's a bit loose, isn't it?
- Yes.

309
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,100
Shall I stitch it a bit?

310
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,100
You are impossible.
- Shall I?

311
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,700
Mother, father has a paunch here.

312
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,200
I am telling you. It's
too big for you.

313
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,200
Mother, why are you trying so
hard! It's too big for him.

314
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Leave me. Mother, father had
another trouser, didn't he?

315
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,100
It's a bit older.
- Yes, a grey-colored trouser.

316
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,300
At that time father didn't
have a big paunch.

317
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,200
Yes, I will bring it.
- Bring it.

318
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,300
Now try another one.

319
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,000
Look, dear. The trouser
that he is bringing...

320
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,400
...came here even before my birth.
- So what!

321
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm telling you, if you wear
that to the interview...

322
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,100
...you won't get the job. Trust me.

323
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,500
It's coming. Check it.

324
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
Ranju, see this.

325
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,400
The color's great, isn't it?

326
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Your father was also very
fond of this trouser.

327
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
You are just wasting time.

328
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,200
It's too big. No. It won't do.

329
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,600
You are the reason behind
all the trouble.

330
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,200
You are troubling him since
morning and spoiled his mood.

331
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,000
Mother, is there any use
in screaming like that?

332
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Can't we solve the problem
by thinking about it...

333
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,100
...with a cool head?

334
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,700
I think instead of going there
wearing father's dress...

335
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Instead of going there
wearing father's dress...

336
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,000
Yes, you have Dhoti-Punjabi.

337
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,500
You can wear that
to your interview.

338
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,100
And also he looks good in that.

339
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,100
Dhoti. Punjabi. He
has a cotton Dhoti.

340
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,400
Doesn't he, mother?
- Handloom Punjabi won't do.

341
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
No. No.

342
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,500
It's a foreign company.
Do you know that?

343
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
But you are a Bengali
person, aren't you?

344
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,400
Mother, forget all
that Bengali crap.

345
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
It's not a matter of Bengali.

346
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,400
And also it's not your son's
wedding. Did you get me?

347
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
And it's an office and I
am going to an interview.

348
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
These people are really strange.

349
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Didn't they get some
other time to strike!

350
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,600
You have a number of friends.

351
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,700
You aren't unable to arrange a
suit? - Yes, it's a good idea.

352
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,600
Try somewhere. There's Dilip.
There's Ashok.

353
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,300
See if they can...

354
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Just a second.

355
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Hello! 478899.

356
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,000
It's Anjana? When did you return?

357
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,200
And you didn't call me?

358
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Working? No. I have been taking
rest all this while.

359
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,400
And you went on tour. Did
you make any sketches?

360
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,400
So many of them? You are a genius.

361
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,500
But no matter whatever
you say, I hate seas.

362
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
I prefer still life.

363
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,500
She didn't tell us
anything about it...

364
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,100
...and suddenly one day she gave us
the shock of the lifetime.

365
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Anjana, can you believe that
a girl like Sudishtna...

366
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,300
...can fall in love with someone?

367
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,500
Yes, she married him. Just a second.

368
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,600
No, I didn't say that
to you. It's Ranjit.

369
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,200
What? Yes, but still it's too long.

370
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,400
You saw him once. I introduced
you to him once.

371
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,400
Just a second. Let me
tell him about you.

372
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,600
It's Anjana. She's studies
with me in Arts college.

373
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Tall. Transparent.
And her color is...

374
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
I wouldn't say fair, but
her eyes are very...

375
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,500
Soft-spoken.

376
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,200
You know, Anjana, Ranju is
getting a bit irritated.

377
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yes, I made him wait
for a long time.

378
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,400
Ok, then, we can talk
later on. Yes, right.

379
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,700
I prefer still life.

380
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
God! It was a long conversation.

381
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
What can I do? She doesn't leave me.

382
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,400
It could hear from only one side.

383
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,200
She called me after a long time.
- She wasn't here.

384
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,300
Yes, she went to Puri on a trip.
- So...

385
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
I am sorry.

386
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,500
How did I act?
- God! I got scared.

387
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
Can't I become a film-star?
- Absolutely Uttam Kumar.

388
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,600
So what were you saying...
- Yes, what was I saying?

389
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
You got a job. After that...

390
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Flat.
- Flat?

391
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Shouldn't I buy a new flat?

392
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,300
You will leave the old house?
- Immediately.

393
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,700
After that?
- Then we will shift to that house.

394
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,200
After that?
- I will decorate the flat.

395
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,600
After that?
- After that? No. Now you tell me.

396
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,800
Me?

397
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,600
I will plant some plants.
Flower plants.

398
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,900
After that? - And then I
will destroy everything...

399
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,600
...that you decorated.
- Oh God! Why?

400
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,600
I'll have to decorate them
from the beginning.

401
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,000
What!
- Everything will be latest.

402
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Latest? Money?
- We will get.

403
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,600
From where?
- Richardson & co.

404
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,400
Bogus. I can't wear that
traditional 'topor'. Never.

405
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,500
Hello! 478899.

406
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
Yes. What happened?

407
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,400
Yes. Yes.

408
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,400
What? Who? Kalyan?

409
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,600
The coat's torn? - It's not torn.
It's just a small cut.

410
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,700
I went there straight
from your place.

411
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Some insect bites at a
couple of places. Best. Prominent.

412
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,000
If it was for some other place it
wouldn't have been a problem...

413
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,400
...but I am going to such a place...

414
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
...where dress is of
primary importance.

415
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,400
Yes. Yes.

416
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,100
I completely forgot it.

417
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,500
It's quite possible.

418
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,100
He must have one.

419
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Can you give me his number?

420
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,200
Just a minute. I will give you
his number. Note it down.

421
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,200
Sanjay Sen. It was here.

422
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,600
Yes, it's here. Sanjay Sen.
It's a doctor's number.

423
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,300
Yes, there's one more number.

424
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Sanjay Sen! No. It's at
Ballygunge Circle road.

425
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,500
How would you get his name?

426
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,000
Telephone is in his
grandfather's name.

427
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,600
I don't know. I don't know
his grandfather's name.

428
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,200
There's another option. I can
go straight to his house.

429
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,700
No, there's no need for his number.

430
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I know where he lives.
I have to take the right turn...

431
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,100
On the second floor of
the white building.

432
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,100
It's gone.

433
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,500
I came to meet Sanjay. Sanjay Sen.

434
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,600
It seems that your electric
line is not working.

435
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,500
They are not here. They left
the house a week ago.

436
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,000
You can come at evening
and take their address...

437
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,200
...from my son.

438
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,000
Great. Great. Trust me,
it will be great.

439
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,000
We weren't getting
any idea till now.

440
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,000
We had a strong tea and that's it.

441
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,400
Tapan, do you really think that
the problem will be solved?

442
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,000
It's already solved. - But isn't
his waist bigger than mine?

443
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,100
No. It's not. I asked
you to bring water.

444
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,000
Firstly it's not true and secondly
if it doesn't fit you...

445
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,000
...then we will try his father's
or his father's uncle's.

446
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,600
Why are you talking like a fool!

447
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Why are you bring his father
and grandfather into this!

448
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,700
Because there is a reason.

449
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,700
Because his family is
a foreign family.

450
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,400
They don't wear anything
other than coat-pant.

451
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
And also there are a number
of gents in their family.

452
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,000
Among so many waists if one
waist doesn't fit you...

453
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,000
...then you have to understand
that you are not destined...

454
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,700
...to get this job.
Now get up. Get up.

455
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,200
Do you have money?
- Yes. - Fine. Taxi!

456
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,000
Look, Tapan, we are going
to Nilankar...

457
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But we didn't meet him
since a long time.

458
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,200
I am feeling a big awkward.
- What's there to be awkward!

459
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,300
You don't have a suit
and he has a suit.

460
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,500
That's why you are going
there. That's all.

461
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,500
We are going to him for just
an ordinary suit...

462
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,500
Ordinary? Ordinary suit?

463
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
Your future depends on this
suit. Did you get me!

464
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,000
And listen, if you can't
maintain friendships...

465
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
...at least you can touch
them once in a while.

466
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,400
Great. Hello, Mr. Mallick!
How do you do?

467
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,000
Really! It looks really great on
you. - It's not great. It's ok.

468
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,700
No, sir. It suits you better
than it suits anyone else.

469
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,400
Get up. Get up.

470
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,700
What's wrong with you! You
have completely changed.

471
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,600
But you didn't change at all.

472
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,300
It will be for your benefit
if you change yourself.

473
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,700
Listen, first you get this job,
then I'll take you to our tailor.

474
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I will get you some suits stitched.

475
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,500
They will look great on you.
They will look great on you.

476
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,100
Didn't I bring him
to the right place?

477
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,200
I know you well.

478
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,100
What are you doing! Leave
me. Stop kidding.

479
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,000
Tapan's just... Hey, I
want to make a call...

480
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,100
...from your telephone to Bulbul.

481
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,300
Hello! Hello!

482
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,600
Yes, I am Ranjit speaking,
from Nilankar's home.

483
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Yes, I got it. No, his
suit didn't fit me.

484
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,700
It's his brother's suit.
Yes, it's great.

485
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,600
Where? Museum? At the museum?

486
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,600
But why museum?

487
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
No. No.

488
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You will draw sketches there.

489
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,100
Oh God! You have to draw
sketches today itself?

490
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,600
The place is quite good.

491
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,700
Ok. Alright.

492
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,700
Ok. At 3 O' clock the
interview will be over.

493
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,000
Then at 4 O' clock...

494
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,300
Ok, I will reach there at
4 O' clock. At 4 O' clock.

495
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,100
At 4 O' clock? You said 4 O' clock?

496
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,400
Alright.
- What! You will also go there?

497
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,400
Ticket. - One ticket to Bhavanipur.
- Esplanade.

498
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,500
And one ticket to Esplanade.

499
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,600
Dude, you got the job.
Don't forget about me.

500
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,700
It's a foreign company. That's
why I am telling you.

501
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,000
Let me get the job first.
- What's this! You've started...

502
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,600
...singing the wrong tune
right from the beginning?

503
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,600
Let me get the job first.
- What's that!

504
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,400
You said that you got the job.
- Let me settle there first.

505
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,100
You can settle there
in just two days.

506
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,400
No matter whatever you say
the suit's just great.

507
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,000
And listen, he said that he
would take you to the tailor.

508
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,300
Get a suit stitched for
you. Did you get me?

509
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,000
Do you know, Ranju, seven
months have gone waste!

510
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,000
The union hasn't give up...

511
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,500
...but I don't think there will
a result any time soon.

512
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,200
That's why I was telling
you to keep me in mind.

513
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,600
My stop is here. Hold it.

514
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's ironed.

515
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,200
And yes, remember my qualification.

516
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,600
School final. And typing
speed is 45. Ok, goodbye.

517
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
Scoundrel.

518
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,500
Yes, tell me where...

519
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,200
Where were you standing?
- Inside the bus.

520
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,300
You were standing inside the bus?

521
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,200
And where was your purse?
- In my shirt-pocket.

522
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,800
It was in your shirt-pocket.
- Listen, I have an interview.

523
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,600
I have to go now.
- Just a minute.

524
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,400
Listen...
- Just a minute.

525
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Where did this incident
take place exactly?

526
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,700
Just after Elgin road. - After
Elgin road. After the bus-stop.

527
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,400
Sit there for a while.
Tell me what happened.

528
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,100
Were you in the bus?
- Yes, I'm the one who caught him.

529
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,500
Were you standing at the back-door?
- Yes.

What's your name?

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,200

00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,500
It's Mahesh Chaudhary lane.

- No, it's a rented house.

538
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,000
You live in the rented house.
- Can you tell me...

539
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,100
...the landlord's name?
- No, I don't know his name.

540
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Duty. It's very crowded here.
What are you all doing here!

541
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,000
Disperse the crowd.
- Go outside.

542
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,400
Please stand outside. It's quite
suffocating here. - Please go.

543
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Please go.
- What do you do for a living?

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,000

548
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400

00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,000
So you work here?
- Yes.

550
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,000
How do you know him?
- I don't know him...

551
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,300
We were just going in the
bus and his pocket...

552
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,600
...was being picked and I
caught the thief and...

553
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,500
Now if you let me go...
- Sit here just for a while.

554
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,300
Let me finish it.

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,300
If you please let me go...
- Just a minute. Just a minute.

556
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,300
I have an interview.
- Let me note everything down.

557
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,300
Let us observe our formalities,
or else the case will be...

558
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,100
You can see the purse
has been stolen...

559
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,500
Now since you came here
to help him out...

560
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,500
...please wait for some time more.

561
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,700
Why did you come back
to this area again!

562
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,000
I didn't pick his pocket.
- You didn't pick his pocket?

563
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,000
Then this person caught
you for no reason?

564
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,600
He has differences with me.
I was standing at the gate...

565
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,000
He has differences with you as
you were standing at gate...

566
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,200
...so he got you arrested.
- He got me arrested.

567
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,200
Stop talking rubbish and tell
me who else was with you.

568
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,700
Sir, I was...
- Who else was with you?

569
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,100
No one else.
- How much money was there in it?

570
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,200
I was standing at the gate and he...

571
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,000
What did you think of yourself!
What did you think!

572
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,200
Did you think you can do whatever
you feel like doing?

573
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,400
Constable, bring a stick.
Bring a stick.

574
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,500
Scoundrel! I will bash you up.

575
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,400
Sir, can I go now?
- Just a few more minutes.

576
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,000
Listen, I have an interview.
I have to leave now.

577
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,400
I have given you my address.

578
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,000
I will come back whenever
you need me.

579
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
Let me go now.

580
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,000
My suit.

581
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,400
Can I make a call from here?
- Yes.

582
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,400
Please give me the directory.

583
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,600
Where shall I call!
Whom shall I call!

584
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,300
Do you know I lost my
belongings in a bus...

585
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,100
State transport!

586
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,800
State transport.

587
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
State...

588
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,500
In you bus... Yes.

589
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,600
Near the Elgin road
I left a packet...

590
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,200
And inside the packet there's
a suit, a complete suit.

591
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,200
A packet wrapped in a white paper.
There's a suit in it.

592
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,000
Will you please stay aside?
I am talking about...

593
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,100
...an important matter. After
I finish it you can...

594
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,000
Yes, the bus was running
towards Jogul Rd. Bazaar...

595
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,300
It was going toward Jogul Rd. Bazaar.

596
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,600
What's wrong with you guys!
Leave me the line.

597
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,000
I am talking about an important
matter and you are...

598
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,600
You can talk after I am done.

599
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,300
Yes, I was saying
that it was going...

600
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
What's wrong with your guys!

601
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,100
You are talking like
an uncultured person.

602
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,500
It's an important matter.
Can't you hear me!

603
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,600
Taxi.

604
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,000
You couldn't hold the
packet in hands?

605
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,300
No.

606
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,300
I saw a monument here. Egyptian.

607
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,200
It's not here anymore, right?
- It's there. Come.

608
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,000
'You got a job. After that... '

609
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,700
'Flat.
- Flat? '

610
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,500
'Shouldn't I buy a new flat? '

611
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,200
'You will leave the old house?
- Immediately.'

612
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,400
'After that?
- Then we will shift to that house.'

613
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,200
'After that?
- I will decorate the flat.'

614
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,700
'After that?
- After that? Now you tell me.'

615
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,200
'I will plant some plants.
Flower plants.'

616
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,600
'I'll have to decorate everything
from the beginning.'

617
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,700
'Everything will be latest.
- Latest? Money? - We will get.'

618
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,100
'From where?
- Richardson & co.'

619
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,000
After whatever I did he
went there and made...

620
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,100
...a clown of himself?

621
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,300
He went to the interview
wearing Dhoti-Punjabi.

622
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,700
I can't believe it, sister-in-law.

623
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,400
If I knew that your son
would do such a thing...

624
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,200
...I would've never...
- I can understand it.

625
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,400
The tea's getting cold.

626
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,500
Ranju is also not here
to bring some sweets.

627
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
No, it's not needed. It's alright.

628
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,200
You came here straight
from the office, right?

629
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,100
You are not getting air?

630
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,000
No, don't bother, sister-in-law.
It's alright.

631
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,000
The kids of this generation
don't have...

632
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,700
...any sense of responsibility.

633
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,600
But you know... He tried his best...

634
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,200
I won't believe it.

635
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,400
If he had tried he wouldn't have
made a fool of himself today.

636
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,300
The laundry was closed today.
- I know that.

637
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,600
It wasn't closed. It's on strike.

638
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,600
He could've got it yesterday.
He could've got it...

639
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,700
...the day after yesterday.

640
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,400
He got another suit...
- But he lost it, right?

641
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,000
When he came home this afternoon...

642
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,400
...you should've seen him...

643
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,400
Sister-in-law, he is not
what you think he is.

644
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But trust me, if you had
seen him at that time...

645
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,000
...you would've felt sorry for him.
- No, I wouldn't have felt so.

646
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,500
I wouldn't have felt sorry for him.

647
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,100
He belongs to that incorrigible
set of...

648
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:23,400
What? What happened? What?

649
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,000
I had an interview, right?

650
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,700
I might've got the job.
I would've got it.

651
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,200
But the laundry went on strike
and I didn't get my clothes.

652
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,600
Somehow I got one, and I
lost that one as well.

653
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,400
Finally I had to attend the
interview in a Dhoti-Punjabi.

654
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,300
And I didn't get the job.

655
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,100
But still I have a job.
I have a job.

656
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,200
I have to look after a family,
a small family.

657
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,500
It's a small family, but still
I run the kitchen.

658
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,000
My family is dependent on me.

659
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,600
And many others look after
their families like I do.

660
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,100
They have to look after them.

661
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,800
Thanks, but you are...

662
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,400
'You don't know me.'

663
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,000
'I have been following you
since the beginning.'

664
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,400
'I am spying on you since morning.'

665
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,600
You are...
- 'I am the audience.'

666
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,300
'Listen. Listen.'

667
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,100
'You are saying that you are not
upset for losing that job.'

668
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,400
No.
- 'You are not saddened? ' - No.

669
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,000
'Brother, why are you lying? '
- What do you mean?

670
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,300
'You said that you are least
bothered about it.'

671
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,600
Yes, I am not bothered about it.

672
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,500
'Then why did you run
after it all day long? '

673
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,000
For the suit.
- 'Why did you need the suit? '

674
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,600
For the interview. - 'For the
interview. There you are.'

675
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,100
Yes, I wanted to go
to the interview.

676
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,300
'Didn't you want to get selected
in that interview? '

677
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,700
So what?
- 'You are getting grumpy.'

678
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,600
What else do you expect if you
ask such irritating questions?

679
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
'You are hiding.'
- No, I am not hiding.

680
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,700
I applied for a job. I was
called for the interview.

681
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,000
I lost the suit and I lost
the job. That's all.

682
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,100
So what's the big deal!
I have a job.

683
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,400
'Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Calm down. Calm down.'

684
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,000
'You have a job. That's
what I am saying.'

685
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,600
'But you wanted a better job.'
- Just that.

686
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,200
A better job.
- Yes.

687
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,600
'More money.'
- Yes. - 'Much, much more.'

688
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
'More than double of what
you are getting now.'

689
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:56,100
'Plus something, plus
commission. Huge! '

690
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,000
'I am sorry, but these
are not my words.'

691
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,900
'These are your words. You
said that to your mother... '

692
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,100
'... this morning.'
- No, I mean...

693
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,000
You mean you wanted to rise in life.

694
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No, I... - You wanted to
change your condition.

695
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,500
Exactly.
- Happiness. Joy.

696
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,600
Wealth. Material possessions.
Prosperity.

697
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,600
'Brother, so you were
lying till now? '

698
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,200
'That you didn't get the job, but
you are least bothered about it.'

699
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,200
'Lt's a case of sour grapes.
Right, brother.'

700
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,000
It's surprising. I am telling you
that I am not upset...

701
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,400
...for losing that job. I
am not upset about it.

702
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,400
'Great.'

703
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,500
'Great.'

704
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,300
'Lovely.'

705
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,600
'Tell me if you were able to go
to the interview in that suit... '

706
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,100
'... if you were able
to arrange your suit... '

707
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,600
'... which scoundrel would've
dared to take away your job? '

708
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,600
Do you know... Do you know
I might've got the job...

709
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,400
I would've got it.
I should've got it.

710
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,400
They said I am a clown.
They said I didn't dress properly.

711
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,600
I went there in Dhoti-Punjabi.

712
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,600
My Dhoti. My Punjabi.

713
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,300
What's this injustice!

714
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,300
They would've been happy
if I wore the suit.

715
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,500
They wanted me to wear a suit.

716
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,100
But what can I do if
I didn't get a suit?

717
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,000
I had everything else.
Intelligence. Talent.

718
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,400
Eligibility. Everything
that they wanted.

719
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,600
Except the clothes they wanted.

720
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,500
What if I had a lot of money?

721
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:41,000
If I had two, three or four suits.
If I had a wardrobe.

722
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,400
If I didn't have the fear of
insects ruining my clothes.

723
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,000
If I didn't have to worry
about which dress...

724
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,600
...I had to wear everyday.

725
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,000
If I had a big bank balance?

726
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,400
Then I would've got
this job so easily.

727
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,700
I would've got it if not for money.

728
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,100
And you know, that's the reason
I didn't get this job.

729
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,100
It's complete injustice.
It's bogus. It's a lie.

730
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,400
We are forced to live
in a dark society.

731
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,400
And we are forced
to accept these rules.

732
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,400
We should protest against
them, shouldn't we?

733
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
We should raise voice against
them, shouldn't we?

734
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,100
We must show them that this
is a lie, it's injustice.

735
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,600
What's this! Where did you all go?

736
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Can you hear me?

737
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,100
Can you hear me?

738
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,600
You were questioning me till
now. Where have you gone?

739
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,400
Can you hear me? Where
did you leave me alone!

740
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,200
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

741
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,100
Can you hear me?
