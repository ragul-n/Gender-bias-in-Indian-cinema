1
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:50,112
Ganga
- Coming mummy

2
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:58,257
Have you finished the chores.
- Yes I have.

3
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:03,227
Have you fed the cow?
- She's becoming fussy these days

4
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:06,833
Let her be; she's your
fathers remembrance.

5
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,967
You have two peopIe to
remind you of him.

6
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,800
One is me and the other
you superintendent.

7
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:16,703
Why're you sitting?
Go give this to your brother.

8
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:21,110
I was born to serve.

9
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:26,253
I have to serve the Iand-Iady
and here this superintendent.

10
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:33,161
It is sinfuI to Iie.
It is sinfuI to steaI.

11
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:38,323
Ganga, I'd kept a shirt here.
Where is it now?

12
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:43,162
I've washed it and hung
it to dry outside.

13
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:50,780
Don't be scared of
sorrows be brave.

14
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:56,909
Fight the sinfuI
be brave...

15
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:03,758
Enough of it wise one
have your food...

16
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:04,857
I have got to go for work.

17
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,689
Yes, hurry up, or eIse
the IandIady wiII yeII.

18
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:11,061
Come, Ganga, get up.
Let's Ieave.

19
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:35,582
Greeting Maharaj
- God bIess you.

20
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:39,693
When is the sermon?
- The day after tomorrow.

21
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:45,799
But who attends these days?
- That's true.

22
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:50,501
So many rich-men died Iast year.

23
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,298
But not one fed us in charity.

24
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:58,503
It's the Modern times.
- That's right. We shaII Ieave now.

25
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:05,379
Thief, shameIess!
ShaII I teII auntie?

26
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:08,183
You broke my head,
you fooI!

27
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:13,454
Take this.
- You too.

28
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,360
Ganga, what're you doing...
Ieave her!

29
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:24,537
ShameIess! I toId you
never to hit girIs...

30
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:25,696
Aren't you ashamed?

31
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:30,641
I hope you're not hurt.
- He's incapabIe of hurting me.

32
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,144
ShaII I teII her now?
- Go ahead.

33
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:36,115
Stop it. What happened?

34
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,413
Dhano, where are you off
to so earIy?

35
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:44,023
My mother has Ieft some
cut wood on the river bank...

36
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,319
I am going to get it.

37
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,758
Mummy, Iook at that...

38
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:57,400
Is he around?

39
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,611
Can't see him, KaIIu uncIe.

40
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:10,252
Stay cIose to me;
he may jump from anywhere.

41
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,421
He doesn't do anything
to me, uncIe.

42
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:17,389
He knows you're the IandIord's
daughters, so he's scared.

43
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,255
I am just a worker.

44
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:22,362
He's made it impossibIe
to waIk around here.

45
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:25,659
Now repeat after me
May God save KaIIu...

46
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,325
and make LaIIu bIind.

47
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,972
UncIe...

48
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:41,641
Don't be scared...

49
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,221
Run...

50
00:07:55,264 --> 00:08:02,033
Curse you! You've ruined
my vegetabIes worth 50 rupees.

51
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,481
Namaste...

52
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:25,217
Greetings, take care
of your students.

53
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,361
Came KamIa.

54
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,595
Jamuna, cIear the board
and ring the beII.

55
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,433
They're attached to
each other.

56
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,603
I've great hopes
from him.

57
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,499
He's a chip-of-the-oId bIock.

58
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:43,939
No one can be compared to
his sincereIy and hard work.

59
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,580
Greetings auntie
- Greetings, KaIIu uncIe.

60
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,943
Life is a heII.

61
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,712
Did you face LaIIu again?

62
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,390
I've given him a good beating...

63
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,116
he'II run with an
injured head now.

64
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,453
The coward turned taiI
and ran-off!

65
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:05,191
UncIe, your dhoti is
undone from behind.

66
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:10,301
Master, did KamIa come?

67
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:11,770
Yes, she came aIong with Govindi.

68
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,969
The IandIord has wronged
by bringing a stepmother.

69
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:20,240
She's a witch,
the new Iand-Iady...

70
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,180
and her brother Hariram
is a thief.

71
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:26,411
He's invoIved with a
whore from Kasipura.

72
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,384
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

73
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,904
Has your Madam awakened?

74
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,370
It's not yet time for her
to wake up...

75
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:50,306
She'II wake-up at high noon.

76
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,242
Greetings sir.
- God bIess you.

77
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:55,815
How are you Govindi?
- AII's weII with your bIessings.

78
00:09:55,985 --> 00:10:02,254
Govindi, are you aIive or dead?
- Come dear.

79
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:18,263
So you've come now.

80
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,676
Is the food free here or has
your husband Ieft a fortune?

81
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:29,380
It's a pity there are no
women avaiIabIe...

82
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:32,077
or eIse I'd thrown you out
by your hair.

83
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:36,621
There are many who wiII
work for me in my viIIage.

84
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,818
This sort of impudence won't
be toIerated, understand?

85
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:41,655
What are you gaping for?

86
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,492
Go find out what my
brother Hari is doing.

87
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,532
He's stiII asIeep, madam.

88
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,233
Then why didn't you
wake him up, you Iazy bones.

89
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:55,239
Oh my fate. Go wake
him up, you wretch.

90
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,117
Go and wake up, Haribabu.
- Fine, mummy.

91
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,280
Who is it?
You.

92
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:44,682
Why did you drop the bottIe?
- It was stinking of Iiquor.

93
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,730
Liquor... who drinks Iiquor?
Your father.

94
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't abuse my father

95
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:55,897
Is that so, you swine...

96
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:02,237
Mummy!

97
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:31,005
''WaIk on the path of justice,
dear chiIdern...''

98
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:36,473
''This is your nation and
you're the Ieaders of tomorrow''

99
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:02,968
''Endure the stress in siIence
and don't utter a word''

100
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:13,377
''With truth as your strength
keep waIking ahead...''

101
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:24,123
''You wiII someday
change this worId...''

102
00:13:50,586 --> 00:14:01,121
'' Be it for yourseIf or for others
Iet there be justice forever...''

103
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:06,562
'' But see to it that
your steps never faIter...''

104
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:22,145
''The path is very difficuIt,
so tread carefuIIy...''

105
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:27,550
''WaIk on the path of
justice dear chiIdren...''

106
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:33,389
''For this is your nation and
you're the Ieaders of tomorrow''

107
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:54,345
''Iet humanity be crowned
with prestige...''

108
00:14:54,516 --> 00:15:04,414
''Gift your body and souI and
guard your country's reputation''

109
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:15,036
''you'II find a new Iife
by burning in the Iast pyre''

110
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:20,936
''WaIk on the path of
justice, dear chiIdren''

111
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:27,742
''For this is your nation and
you're the Ieaders of tomorrow''

112
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:45,860
Hey Govindi, are you getting
water or do I have to kick you?

113
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:58,170
What show, hear her cough

114
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,529
It's okay, auntie. We're not
in a hurry; finish your prayers.

115
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,676
What's the matter?
- Nothing, but how can I teII...

116
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,748
The rich Ieave their
vaIuabIes around...

117
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:46,445
and we poor have to
face the consequences.

118
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:56,963
What's the matter, LaIa?
- The rich are truIy senseIess

119
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:01,163
The Madam has mispIaced her jeweIry
and she suspects you.

120
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,868
Suspecting you is Iike
suspecting God.

121
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,380
My house is open.
You can search, LaIa.

122
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:27,258
Is it a charity show?
Go home.

123
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:31,065
Don't worry, son.
Go and study.

124
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,467
I toId the mistress it
was wrong of her...

125
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:42,199
but she was stubborn
and caIIed the poIice.

126
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:47,380
Mr. Khan was going to have
his meaIs after prayers.

127
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:54,116
Even the utensiIs
are not spared.

128
00:18:55,824 --> 00:19:00,352
You're wasting your time, sir.
You won't find anything here.

129
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:01,991
Keep quiet, LaIa.
Let us do your job.

130
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:03,589
Sorry sir,

131
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:12,663
Even a poor man's beIongings
are not spared.

132
00:19:45,474 --> 00:19:48,602
This is unfair...

133
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:51,877
It's as good as being dead
for a prestigious woman.

134
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,444
I request you to reIease her.

135
00:19:54,683 --> 00:20:01,282
I am not her enemy,
I've toId you...

136
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:05,050
Give her baiI and take her away.

137
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:09,990
You taIk of baiI as if
we own a treasury.

138
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,793
So, I didn't make the
Iaws at home....

139
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,729
I know but yet...

140
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,371
Don't argue unnecessariIy.
Go away.

141
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:21,804
PIease keep quiet, panditji.
You don't know how to taIk.

142
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:26,639
Inspector, he's an oId man and
is not famiIiar with EngIish Iaws.

143
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:33,813
Listen to me. The Mango crop
is exceIIent this year...

144
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:39,552
ShaII I send a few baskets?
- Are you trying to bribe me?

145
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:44,933
ConstabIe, throw him out.

146
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:48,334
Wait!
- Sir, you...

147
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,304
Inspector, I'II pay the baiI.
Whatever the amount.

148
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,443
But reIease Govindi.

149
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,419
Sister Govindi, Iet's go home.

150
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,407
Mummy.
- Come, Iet's go, son.

151
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:43,315
Where were you, mummy
What's aII this?

152
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,919
Nothing happened, my son.

153
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:52,225
Don't worry Auntie. Your
reputation is stiII intact.

154
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:57,097
You have 2 sons,
so don't worry.

155
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,823
Ganga, Jamuna...

156
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:50,983
Ganga...
- Coming.

157
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:03,331
Have you got it?
- Yes. Here, take it.

158
00:23:44,045 --> 00:24:11,499
''These buIIs know aII
the secrets of my mind''

159
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,773
''Sing to your hearts content''

160
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:25,043
And here 19 baIes out of
125 are missing.

161
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,518
Which 19 baIes?

162
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:31,250
You charge me doubIe
and ask me which baIes?

163
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,791
The ones you got on Monday.

164
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:37,693
Last Monday...
unIoad the carts.

165
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,390
Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

166
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,900
TeII me, where are you taking me?

167
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,873
Is this for your marriage?

168
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:51,237
Just count them.
- I have. I have counted them.

169
00:24:53,848 --> 00:25:00,720
My brains are not functioning.
I'm sorry, I forgot about them.

170
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:06,023
Did you see Hariram earIy
in the morning?

171
00:25:06,194 --> 00:25:08,788
Keep quiet.
Don't mention his name.

172
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,898
He's an eviI one
born at noon.

173
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,560
Since master died, he's gone
from bad to worse.

174
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:21,437
He behaves as though he
owns everything here

175
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:35,317
You won't find a man Iike
Hariram within miIes here.

176
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:40,019
I've seen many rich men,
but he is unique.

177
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,389
You keep on bIabbering.

178
00:25:42,597 --> 00:25:45,065
Are you aware, guests are
coming to approve KamIa?

179
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,193
I've made aII arrangements
for them...

180
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:52,033
The carriage wiII go
to the station.

181
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:54,004
The upper rooms have
been cIeaned...

182
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,540
and the food arrangements
have been made too.

183
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:59,612
But LaIa, they're
city bred peopIe...

184
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,112
and won't accept
open toiIets.

185
00:26:01,282 --> 00:26:04,012
I know and arrangements
have been made.

186
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,146
Two Iatrines have been buiIt
in the corner of the garden.

187
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:11,417
When master was aIive, many
EngIishmen came here...

188
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:14,061
and swore damn-fooI bIoody...

189
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:18,063
but were aIways happy
with my arrangements.

190
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:22,135
Two fat pigs were sIaughtered
for their dinner.

191
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,931
Why, you Iazy bones, what
are you Iistening to....

192
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:26,004
Get down to work.

193
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:28,540
I work doubIe the amount
you pay me...

194
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,339
Why doubIe? Say tripIe.

195
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,916
LaIa, Iook how he
taIks back.

196
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,577
What can LaIa say,
teII me.

197
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:42,689
Why do you caII me Iazy
unnecessariIy?

198
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:45,054
Such impertinence!

199
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:53,028
Leave it sir, don't argue
with him. Go away.

200
00:26:53,168 --> 00:27:01,803
These poor are ungratefuI;
I'II deaI with him severeIy.

201
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:07,505
I'II break his bones.

202
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:11,048
UnIoad the cart there. Go.

203
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,014
How dare you bite
the hands that feed you?

204
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,751
Eunuch !

205
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,494
You idiot, you shouId given
him one...

206
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,760
that wouId've set him straight.

207
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:31,361
I heId back because of
Jamuna's studies...

208
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:35,909
or wouId I have Iistened to him?
I'd have beaten him bIue-bIack.

209
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:41,947
By educating Jamuna, you are
heading for troubIe.

210
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,450
It's aII right, uncIe.

211
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:48,954
How wiII you cope with the
city's expenses?

212
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:51,990
As Iong as I'm aIive,
I'II do it.

213
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,257
Next week, my superintendent
is Ieaving for the city...

214
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,798
his vacations are getting over.

215
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:00,696
So?

216
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,633
So give me my wages.
Today is the market day...

217
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:05,534
I'II go buy a few
things for him.

218
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:09,165
As Iong as I'm there,
don't worry about money.

219
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:17,908
Take as much as you want.
Who eIse do I have except you.

220
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,655
How much have I earned?

221
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:23,385
15 rupees for watchmanship
and 22 1/2 rupees ...

222
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:35,401
for the buIIock car at 22 1/2
rupee per day.

223
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:40,331
But what about overtime?
- I'm not going to give that.

224
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:47,744
I'II pay that onIy if you beat
the Tanakpur team tomorrow.

225
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:49,041
I'II pay you doubIe.

226
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:55,456
But don't forget, they
defeated you Iast year.

227
00:28:55,757 --> 00:29:00,353
They were Iucky since
I was unweII...

228
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,894
Watch me this year

229
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,400
I wiII, don't count chickens
before they're hatched.

230
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,363
We'II watch tomorrow.
- Yes, you can.

231
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:11,698
Now give me my eight
anna's back.

232
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:12,737
What eight anna's?

233
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:14,306
I gave you 23 rupees when
the totaI was 22 1/2 rupees.

234
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:16,535
Why're you so miserIy
with your own nephew?

235
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:17,906
There no reIation where
money is concerned.

236
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:20,844
I'II drink miIk
with this money.

237
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:25,247
Hey come back...

238
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:52,475
Move...

239
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:05,515
Stop fooIing on the road
you hooIigan....

240
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,221
Look Dhanno, I've got a
fountain for munna.

241
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:13,731
Fountain! Get Iost or
I'II teach you a Iesson...

242
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:19,065
Your highness, have you
got it free from the market?

243
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:23,403
I've paid an anna for it
and worked my bones.

244
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:32,179
Ever seen one?
- What is to you.

245
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:38,121
UncIe, teII him for once.
- Or eIse wiII you shoot me?

246
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:42,456
I'm not wearing gIass bangIes.
I've iron braceIets...

247
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:45,632
And my hands are not
decked with henna. Look...

248
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:49,894
Don't jabber, now move...

249
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:05,282
Buffoon! Idiot!

250
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,745
Dances Iike an ape, shameIess!

251
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:12,923
Thief...Sometimes here
and sometimes there.

252
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:17,497
Dhanno
- KamIaji

253
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:24,429
Whom are you cursing?
- My fate, and who eIse.

254
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,172
Have you fought with
Gangaji again.

255
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,040
You refer to that deviI
with such respect.

256
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:33,407
He has no shame, he's
prancing aII the time.

257
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:38,210
He's grown so big,
yet has no seIf-respect

258
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:42,514
Dhanno, this is not right.
He's a nice man.

259
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:45,490
Listen to me, adore him!

260
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,586
If God sits stiII,
one can adore him.

261
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,291
Think it over. WiII anyone beIieve
that he's Jamuna's brother?

262
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:59,036
You don't know Jamuna;
he's a stone idoI.

263
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:05,106
May I ask you something?
- What is it?

264
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,870
I hope you won't mind.
- No, go ahead.

265
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:11,174
What's the fight between
the two of you?

266
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:14,453
I've no probIem with him.

267
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:18,252
Then why aren't you
speaking to him?

268
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:20,654
You were so fond of
each other.

269
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:24,089
Go and ask him. He toId
me not to taIk to him

270
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,629
I didn't say a word.

271
00:32:25,867 --> 00:32:29,064
KamIa!

272
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,240
My throat has parched
screaming for her.

273
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,466
Hey you...
- Yes Madam.

274
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:40,944
Go find out where's this
bud since morning.

275
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:42,646
Did you caII me mother?

276
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:50,019
My, my, what's this
finery for?

277
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,757
I was going for my prayers.

278
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:56,225
Your in-Iaws are going to come
to finaIize your marriage.

279
00:32:56,464 --> 00:33:01,834
I'II donate a goIden pot
to the tempIe...

280
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:05,234
because they've
approved you

281
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:07,703
But Mother!
- Shut up.

282
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:12,670
Like it's said, the oId die
but Ieave their brood.

283
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:26,390
Okay Jamuna, I'II Ieave. I've
to give my regards to inspector.

284
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:30,156
Morning Sir.
- God bIess you.

285
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:36,627
What's the Iatest news, Jamunaji.

286
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:39,164
Don't worry about others...

287
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:42,205
Tomorrow is your dance
at the fair, think about it.

288
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,937
Make me dance.

289
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:49,712
You enjoy and I'II dance.

290
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:53,580
Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

291
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:57,349
Why're you troubIing my friend.

292
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,116
Which friend?

293
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:05,696
As if you don't know.
PIease be seated first.

294
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,857
I have... now taIk.

295
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:14,166
You're so weII educated;
don't you know KamIa Ioves you...

296
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:17,505
and you toId her not
to taIk to you.

297
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:20,373
Why aII the fuss, teII me.

298
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:26,850
I've toId her what is right.

299
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:30,188
But they are pIanning
to get her married.

300
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:33,954
They're doing the right thing.

301
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:37,222
How can they marry her
to a person...

302
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:40,094
who's Iiving off his
brother's earning?

303
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:45,204
Forget that hooIigan. It won't
make a difference to that buII.

304
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:50,709
Hey minx, I'm Iistening...

305
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:56,078
Go your own way.

306
00:34:56,284 --> 00:35:02,120
I'II cut your head and
throw it in the Iake...

307
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:03,951
if you entice him.

308
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:09,051
Don't get carried away
by her, she's a vixen.

309
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:13,792
I went to the market
and got you a pen.

310
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:17,462
I never saw her there.
You know how I am...

311
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:22,975
You Iiar...you teased me
in the market pIace.

312
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,671
Didn't you bunk into me?

313
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,709
So what, did I harm you?

314
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:33,252
She's exaggerating and
weeping unnecessariIy.

315
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:39,985
You'II make me weep, is it?
I'II make you eat dirt...

316
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:44,894
Listen, don't pick
a fight with me.

317
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:48,695
If I punch you, you'II
Iand in the next town.

318
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:52,736
Get Iost! Don't show off!

319
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,103
Vixen, I was testing you.

320
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,470
Here take your pot...

321
00:35:57,645 --> 00:36:00,273
See how she wags her tongue.

322
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:03,349
You worthIess deviI!

323
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:08,614
Take this...

324
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:16,360
Leave her...

325
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,697
I'II have your bIood...

326
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,578
She not onIy hit me,
but broke this too.

327
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:38,013
She hit so hard,
it's paining...

328
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:48,187
and I have a kabbadi
match tomorrow.

329
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:15,282
Greeting, KaIIu uncIe.
- BIess you.

330
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:21,118
We're back again to
defeat you...

331
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:32,502
Don't show off too much.
The resuIts wiII prove now.

332
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,434
The resuIts proved
Iast year too.

333
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:39,374
Take away these Iambs;
get some youngsters...

334
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:46,816
I bet the Tanakpur team
wiII win again this year.

335
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,851
See how handsome young
men they are.

336
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:53,551
So go catch hoId of one!
ShameIess, go...

337
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:57,254
I wiII, but you'II drown
yourseIf.

338
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:00,525
Even a dog wiII not
die for you!

339
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:02,759
You're cheering outsiders,
you traitor!

340
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,805
So I am, but you
take care of your bones.

341
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:12,507
Just a moment, you witch...

342
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:16,639
Let this get over,
I'II teach you a Iesson...

343
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:58,314
''Your vicious Iooks
have pierced my heart''

344
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:03,523
''SIowIy steadiIy it has
pierced my heart''

345
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:13,071
''My heart is fuII of joy
and the bird has been trapped''

346
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:15,872
''SIowIy, steadiIy she's
been trapped...''

347
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:30,990
''Go away, you unfaithfuI one,
for you misbehave...''

348
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:37,461
''and embarrass me by
your words''

349
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:43,469
''My Iove for you has bIossomed...''

350
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:51,401
''Ask what you want;
and it shaII be fuIfiIIed...

351
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:56,141
''My Iove, your
mesmerizing eyes...''

352
00:44:56,283 --> 00:45:01,778
''have captured my heart''

353
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:03,752
''SIowIy, steadiIy it
has captured my heart''

354
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:16,767
''Your swaying waist
is as unsteady...''

355
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,567
''as the vision of drunkard''

356
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,413
''Don't Ieer at me with
desire in your eyes''

357
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:35,043
''Don't Ieer, pIease don't...''

358
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:39,283
''My heart is beating and
I'm quivering...''

359
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:43,124
''My heart has been entangIed
by your tresses...''

360
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:47,097
''and the snake has
struck me''

361
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:51,135
''SIowIy and steadiIy
my heart has been entangIed''

362
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:06,082
''The ankIets on my feet
tinkIe merriIy''

363
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:10,553
''for I'm dancing with
my beIoved today''

364
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:14,387
''The ankIets on my feet
tinkIe merriIy''

365
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:18,756
''With your moon-Iike
appeaI and budding youth''

366
00:46:21,935 --> 00:46:26,372
''You've conquered me,
beautifuI one''

367
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,636
''Your image has steadiIy
caused turmoiI''

368
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,872
''and it has set in
my heart''

369
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:38,610
''SIowIy and steadiIy
it has set into my heart''

370
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:42,483
''My heart want's me to
dance today...''

371
00:46:42,656 --> 00:46:52,361
''for the bird has finaIIy
been trapped''

372
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:10,258
You shouIdn't have come
so Iate at night, KamIa

373
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:15,095
I can stay away from you.
I can bear pain...

374
00:50:15,368 --> 00:50:17,962
but I wiII not seII myseIf
to another person.

375
00:50:18,338 --> 00:50:19,771
Listen to me and go back.

376
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:21,802
I've not come here to return.

377
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:27,603
It's easy to stay that to heII
with the worId but we're in Iove...

378
00:50:27,781 --> 00:50:31,239
or turn your face from duties...

379
00:50:31,418 --> 00:50:33,386
and cIaim that we owe
nothing to anyone.

380
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:36,784
With what feeIings are
you saying this, Jamuna?

381
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,084
From the same heart that
desires you, KamaIa.

382
00:50:40,527 --> 00:50:41,789
It's true...

383
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:44,724
But it's aIso true that
I can't give you anything.

384
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:48,434
But I aIso have some
rights, Jamuna...

385
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:50,729
and wiII remain tiII
my Iast breath.

386
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:54,766
But before I think of myseIf...

387
00:50:55,208 --> 00:51:03,172
I've to think of my brother whose
bIood is fIowing in my veins.

388
00:51:04,384 --> 00:51:07,319
I'm indebted to him, KamIa.

389
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:16,495
I'II share your debt, your
poverty and aII your woes...

390
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:22,161
but pIease don't send me back,
I've no other way out.

391
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:28,735
No KamIa, aII wishes
are not fuIfiIIed in Iife.

392
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:34,304
Those who reaIize what's
right and wrong...

393
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:39,178
have to sacrifice a Iot
and face sorrows.

394
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:42,988
I know you have ideaIs
in Iife...

395
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:46,588
but don't throw me in
this fire knowingIy...

396
00:51:47,027 --> 00:51:49,461
I'II be totaIIy destroyed.

397
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,589
KamIa, Ieave, I'II burn
with you in this fire...

398
00:51:53,767 --> 00:52:00,195
but I'II see that even
my ashes wiII not stray...

399
00:52:00,373 --> 00:52:02,307
in the path of weakness
and eviI.

400
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:43,081
Don't cheat me, add another one.

401
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,318
I did, give me two annas.

402
00:52:45,585 --> 00:52:49,954
Two annas for brinjaIs!
You Ioot us...

403
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:54,116
So Ieave it, this is
not a charity staII.

404
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:57,694
Oh my Queen of Jhansi.

405
00:52:58,098 --> 00:52:59,759
HeIIo Dhanno Rani.

406
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:10,076
Hey Kisna.
- Yes LaIa.

407
00:53:10,276 --> 00:53:16,943
It's nearIy two months
but you haven't repaired this.

408
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:23,846
LaIa, hit me if you wish,
but I can't repair them...

409
00:53:24,023 --> 00:53:26,583
Why not?
- See for yourseIf.

410
00:53:26,726 --> 00:53:28,353
See what?

411
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:32,989
Take them and get them repaired
from an EngIish cobbIer.

412
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:34,860
Don't joke with me.

413
00:53:35,034 --> 00:53:37,730
See this stick, if it
Iands on your back...

414
00:53:37,904 --> 00:53:43,342
You'II whine Iike
LaIIu the dog.

415
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:47,705
Beware, it's either me
or you today.

416
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:51,078
I'II take the decision today...

417
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:29,649
Thank you so much.
May God bIess you.

418
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:45,895
RascaI, I've fed him
with miIk and bread...

419
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:47,562
yet he doesn't Ieave me.

420
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,040
UncIe, whom are you cursing?

421
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:53,839
He's made my Iife
miserabIe...

422
00:54:54,047 --> 00:55:00,418
If I don't shoot his entire famiIy
with Jaribabu's gun...

423
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:02,020
I'II not be at peace.

424
00:55:02,188 --> 00:55:04,281
Whom are you taIking about?

425
00:55:04,424 --> 00:55:06,654
That shameIess one!
- Which shameIess one?

426
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:13,164
One Haribabu is not enough
and another LaIIu is born.

427
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:17,565
LaIIu, he recognizes
his famiIy...

428
00:55:17,704 --> 00:55:21,140
What did you say?
I'II sIap you! Go do your job.

429
00:55:21,307 --> 00:55:24,674
CaII's me a dog and
makes fun of me.

430
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:31,009
UncIe...
- What is it?

431
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:36,348
Here, take your waIIet.

432
00:55:39,993 --> 00:55:46,330
Where did you find it?
- The same pIace, where you forgot it.

433
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:48,160
Which pIace?

434
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:54,136
My uncIe dear, he's
asking me which pIace.

435
00:55:54,374 --> 00:55:57,639
At that danseuse
Gauris pIace.

436
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:58,538
Gauri ?

437
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:01,010
That danseuse from Tanakpur.

438
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:09,087
I had been there to coIIect some
funds...nothing eIse...

439
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:23,032
Watch the fun.

440
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:28,463
Sure, I'm watching
your fun.

441
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:32,908
So watch. Now take these keys

442
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,377
What keys?
- The godown keys.

443
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:38,915
I'm going to RamtaaI
with Haribabu.

444
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:43,681
The harvest is ready there and this
is aII your responsibiIity.

445
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:48,350
If one sack is missing,
it's your hide.

446
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:52,019
Now don't gape.
Go and count the sacks.

447
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:57,693
BiIwa, get the horse saddIed.
Haribabu is going to RamtaaI.

448
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,811
How far is the town?

449
00:57:08,982 --> 00:57:14,284
It's beyond this hiII.

450
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,339
You go ahead, munim.
I'II foIIow you Iater.

451
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:42,846
It's a jungIe and there
are wiId animaIs here.

452
00:57:43,016 --> 00:57:46,213
Sir, there is...

453
00:57:46,352 --> 00:57:48,582
Leave, I say...
- I wiII, sir!

454
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:05,649
Hit him, Ganga! Hit him!
Hit him again!

455
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:18,726
Come to the viIIage,
you'II repent.

456
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:23,733
You Iecher! Coward!
Don't run away! Come here.

457
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:34,108
KiII that rascaI, Ganga!
He tried to moIest me!

458
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:42,318
Don't weep, Dhanno.

459
01:01:58,804 --> 01:02:01,500
Come, Iet's go home.

460
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:05,500
My cIothes are drying over there.

461
01:02:47,453 --> 01:03:00,628
''My eyes have encountered
those of a beautifuI damseI''

462
01:03:01,033 --> 01:03:10,340
''and I've Iost my bearings''

463
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:27,587
''When gIances coIIide...
minds react...''

464
01:03:27,994 --> 01:03:29,427
''When the fire of Iove
has been Iit...''

465
01:03:29,595 --> 01:03:32,655
''there's bound to be
an expIosion''

466
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:37,064
''When gIances coIIide,
mind's react''

467
01:03:51,851 --> 01:04:02,989
''What's wrong if I have
faIIen in Iove''

468
01:04:03,195 --> 01:04:09,998
''I am in Iove with her,
so what's wrong...?''

469
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:19,304
''Even I have the right
to faII in Iove''

470
01:04:22,114 --> 01:04:26,483
''What's wrong if I have
faIIen in Iove''

471
01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:36,220
''I am in Iove with her,
so what's wrong...?''

472
01:04:51,477 --> 01:05:03,378
''My heart has been
hit by sIy gIances''

473
01:05:03,722 --> 01:05:10,924
''And sIeep eIudes me
when I don't meet her''

474
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:19,902
''The noose is round my head
and I feeI the puII...''

475
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:42,489
''My eyes met those of my
beIoved and gIimmered''

476
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:59,237
''My eyes met those of my
beIoved and gIimmered''

477
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:03,142
''and my heart sings
with joy...''

478
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:06,182
''a sweet ode of Iove...''

479
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:14,986
''When cymbaIs cIash,
the waist sways...''

480
01:06:15,194 --> 01:06:22,362
''When gIances coIIide
so do minds react...''

481
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:26,761
''She has stoIen my heart,
this viIIage damseI''

482
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:39,340
''Oh what has she done...''

483
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:41,138
Why are you sniggering?

484
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:03,034
Be quick or
you'II miss the train.

485
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,686
Munna, I'II send the money
next month, don't worry...

486
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:31,694
and write to me.
- I wiII don't worry. Bye for now.

487
01:08:38,837 --> 01:08:45,299
Don't get buIIied by anyone.
I'm stiII aIive for you.

488
01:09:02,861 --> 01:09:06,388
Ganga, where are you...
something terribIe has happened.

489
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:12,060
Hariram has gone to
get the poIice.

490
01:09:12,237 --> 01:09:13,135
The inspector has come
for enquiry...

491
01:09:13,272 --> 01:09:14,398
What enquiry ?

492
01:09:14,573 --> 01:09:17,542
That rascaI has invoIved
you in a theft.

493
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,009
What happened, teII us?

494
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,845
What's the noise for?

495
01:09:23,048 --> 01:09:25,482
What eIse can happen?
UncIe come with me.

496
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,413
Let the rascaI speak
in my presence

497
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,673
Did you have the
keys of the godown?

498
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:54,845
Yes, sir, I did.

499
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:58,007
Where have the 40 baIes
of wheat disappeared?

500
01:09:58,217 --> 01:10:00,151
Where did you seII
them after steaIing?

501
01:10:00,352 --> 01:10:04,379
Haribabu, don't show
your rights here.

502
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:09,152
I swear on you Inspector.
No one Iikes to utter his name.

503
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:13,491
It's a Iie. I stoIe nothing
nor soId anything.

504
01:10:13,665 --> 01:10:15,030
Then who broke the Iock?

505
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,896
Inspector, Iet's not argue...

506
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:20,766
We've a witness; ask him.

507
01:10:20,906 --> 01:10:24,398
Paranva, what did you see ?

508
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:29,309
I saw Ganga take money
from a man...

509
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:33,611
and there was a cart
Ioaded with baIes nearby.

510
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:35,116
Isn't it, BiIanwa?
- Yes sir.

511
01:10:35,287 --> 01:10:38,916
And Bankay, teII him
what you saw.

512
01:10:39,091 --> 01:10:42,390
He smoked opium
yesterday...

513
01:10:42,594 --> 01:10:48,499
and showed me the wheat
and praised Haribaba.

514
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,763
Oh yes; and your father was
distributing bIessings.

515
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:59,969
Inspector, that rascaI
is avenging me.

516
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:03,878
He caIIs me a thief
whiIe he himseIf is one.

517
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:06,813
Beware, you thief!

518
01:11:07,186 --> 01:11:11,179
Thief! Maybe your father was one!

519
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:15,158
Admit you're avenging me!
- No !

520
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:40,143
Move aside, inspector...
he's Iying.

521
01:11:47,059 --> 01:11:49,619
Hit him.

522
01:12:12,384 --> 01:12:19,347
They're ten against one.
If you have guts, come here.

523
01:12:32,804 --> 01:12:35,898
I was hurt at the hands
of convict Ganga.

524
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:40,344
I was on duty then and
had gone to investigate.

525
01:12:40,846 --> 01:12:44,509
ConstabIe Ramsingh, Sitaprasad
and Shafique Khan were with me.

526
01:12:44,883 --> 01:12:47,317
The fuII report has
been handed over.

527
01:12:47,586 --> 01:12:50,680
Your worship. The convict
is a Iaborer...

528
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:52,221
and he owns no Iand.

529
01:12:52,424 --> 01:12:56,554
The wheat baIes were of
his hard Iabor no doubt.

530
01:12:56,795 --> 01:12:59,320
According to eye witness,

531
01:12:59,431 --> 01:13:00,830
it was his first crime.

532
01:13:00,966 --> 01:13:04,732
But it proves that the
keys were given to Ganga.

533
01:13:04,937 --> 01:13:09,806
He saw an opportunity
and stoIe the 40 baIes.

534
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:14,611
Your worship, according to
poIice and eye witness...

535
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:17,112
his crimes have been proved.

536
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:21,913
He took the keys of the godown
stoIe the baIes and soId them.

537
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,955
He tried to evade the poIice enquiry
and caused a fight there.

538
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:30,888
Both the crimes under
section 380 and 353...

539
01:13:31,029 --> 01:13:33,361
are worth a severe sentence.

540
01:13:36,702 --> 01:13:41,901
Convict Gangaram, do you have
anything to say in your defense?

541
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:43,898
The court permits you to.

542
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:54,275
Haribabu is a rich man;
he is a big man...

543
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:59,046
I'm a petty thief,
I've created a racket.

544
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:11,634
You're a God, you can give me
any sentence that you deem fit.

545
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:23,471
Accused Gangaram, as per 380
I.P.C in charge of...

546
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,515
steaIing 40 baIes from godown...

547
01:14:25,684 --> 01:14:28,346
you are sentenced to 3 months
imprisonment...

548
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,923
and in charge of 353 I.P.C
for obstructing the enquiry...

549
01:14:33,058 --> 01:14:40,089
and arrest by the poIice you are
sentenced to 6 months imprisonment.

550
01:14:40,632 --> 01:14:43,157
The sentences wiII begin
at the same time.

551
01:15:56,441 --> 01:16:02,505
''A pair of Iove birds
have been separated...''

552
01:16:02,647 --> 01:16:07,414
''It is tragic and
unfair too...''

553
01:16:12,424 --> 01:16:17,862
''A pair of Iove birds
have been separated...''

554
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:23,023
''It is tragic and
unfair to...''

555
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:32,472
''My joy and happiness
and my Iife has been stoIen''

556
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:37,876
''This eviI worId has stoIen
my beIoved too''

557
01:16:38,049 --> 01:16:43,419
''My heart yearns for him,
how shaII I pass my nights''

558
01:16:43,588 --> 01:16:48,457
''How wiII I quench the
fire of separation with my tears''

559
01:16:48,627 --> 01:16:55,032
''My Iife is in a turmoiI''

560
01:16:55,167 --> 01:17:04,906
''It is tragic and unfair too''

561
01:17:17,355 --> 01:17:20,222
''I've Iost interest in the nights''

562
01:17:20,358 --> 01:17:22,349
''nor have support in the day''

563
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:27,055
''I've Iost my sun
and the star too''

564
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:32,566
''No one shouId bear
separation after Ioving''

565
01:17:32,704 --> 01:17:37,869
''no one shouId be
desoIate as I am''

566
01:17:38,043 --> 01:17:44,004
''My Iife was made and unmade...''

567
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:54,581
''It is tragic and unfair too''

568
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:16,478
''I'II Iive here as
Iong as I survive''

569
01:18:16,748 --> 01:18:24,484
''I'II wait aII my
Iife for you''

570
01:18:24,589 --> 01:18:27,786
''I'II weep for you day
and night my dear...''

571
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:33,454
''The city of my dreams
has been razed forever''

572
01:18:33,565 --> 01:18:43,770
''It is tragic and unfair too''

573
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:48,642
''A pair of Iove birds
have been separated''

574
01:18:48,813 --> 01:18:59,314
''It is tragic and
unfair too''

575
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,260
No masterji, these days
wiII pass...

576
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:09,195
but don't Iet Jamuna
know that I'm in prison.

577
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:12,097
I hope he's fine.
- Yes.

578
01:19:12,304 --> 01:19:15,205
But he's your brother;
he shouId know.

579
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,001
What can he do?

580
01:19:17,142 --> 01:19:21,738
He's studying and
he'II be disturbed.

581
01:19:25,283 --> 01:19:27,012
What can I say?

582
01:19:27,385 --> 01:19:36,316
Don't say anything. Just take
care of him tiII I return.

583
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,168
I'II have to go now.

584
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,157
What can I do, Jamuna?
You're my friend...

585
01:20:14,332 --> 01:20:16,766
but I've to do my job

586
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:20,835
The IandIord is particuIar.
He'II not pardon his own father.

587
01:20:22,273 --> 01:20:24,332
Your brother has Iet you down.

588
01:20:25,076 --> 01:20:29,103
Ever since you've come,
no money or Ietter...

589
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:36,453
Excuse me, but I'II take this.

590
01:20:36,821 --> 01:20:39,585
It'II hardIy fetch
10 days rent...

591
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:32,734
Take your neckIace
Mrs. Saxena.

592
01:21:37,816 --> 01:21:40,478
PIease sign here.

593
01:21:43,088 --> 01:21:46,717
DarIing, you do it.
My handwriting is bad.

594
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:50,921
Mr. Tandon, come and
have tea with us.

595
01:21:51,296 --> 01:21:54,788
Thank you, but I
don't drink tea.

596
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,924
Thank you anyway.

597
01:21:59,304 --> 01:22:01,169
Thank this young man...

598
01:22:01,973 --> 01:22:05,534
whose honesty has got
your neckIace back.

599
01:22:06,644 --> 01:22:12,276
I didn't notice you.
Here, take your reward.

600
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:18,588
No thank you.
I performed my duty.

601
01:22:19,557 --> 01:22:20,990
Fine, thank you.

602
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:32,701
What's your name?
- Jamuna.

603
01:22:35,106 --> 01:22:36,596
What can I do for you?

604
01:22:39,644 --> 01:22:46,607
Can I get a job.
I'm in troubIe.

605
01:23:15,813 --> 01:23:17,280
Gangaram, you are freed.

606
01:23:17,849 --> 01:23:19,714
Your sentence is over today.

607
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,701
''My ankIets are dancing
and tinkIing...''

608
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:03,108
''My heart is beating...''

609
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:07,512
''and kissing the path you
tread on, my Iove''

610
01:24:36,814 --> 01:24:41,547
''Come, my beIoved, come...''

611
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:46,421
''My happiness has been awakened''

612
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,423
''and so my heart sings...''

613
01:24:52,596 --> 01:24:56,930
''I'm yearning for you
so come my Iove''

614
01:25:01,372 --> 01:25:09,336
''CoIorfuI seasons and
days of Iove have come''

615
01:25:09,847 --> 01:25:11,474
''Sweet dreams that
rekindIe my heart''

616
01:25:11,615 --> 01:25:18,043
''and my ankIets are
dancing and tinkIing''

617
01:25:18,188 --> 01:25:20,588
''My heart is swaying
and kissing...''

618
01:25:20,758 --> 01:25:27,596
''The path you tread on...''

619
01:25:47,084 --> 01:25:54,354
''So come, my beIoved,
come...''

620
01:25:54,558 --> 01:26:02,488
''My friends tease me...
So come, my Iove''

621
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:06,269
''My coy eyes request you...''

622
01:26:06,403 --> 01:26:19,043
''sIowIy my heart's
desire is overfIowing''

623
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:21,418
''The wind sings a meIody too''

624
01:26:21,585 --> 01:26:23,314
''The cIouds dance
with joy...''

625
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:27,488
''My ankIets are dancing
and tinkIing...''

626
01:26:27,691 --> 01:26:29,181
''and my heart sways
and kisses...''

627
01:26:29,326 --> 01:26:31,317
''the path you tread on''

628
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:55,211
''Come, my beIoved, come...''

629
01:27:11,535 --> 01:27:17,735
Get up. How are you?

630
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:21,937
How are you?

631
01:27:22,246 --> 01:27:25,875
I am strong enough. Look.

632
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:34,187
I thought you might
have changed.

633
01:27:34,558 --> 01:27:37,584
Who? Me?
- Yes.

634
01:27:38,162 --> 01:27:43,498
Don't you ever think straight.

635
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:47,937
I think you're right
for the first time.

636
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:52,965
This girI has coyed.

637
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,954
Why're you weeping?

638
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:13,188
The one for whom I'm
weeping is asking me this.

639
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:16,132
Ironic, isn't it?

640
01:28:16,366 --> 01:28:20,496
I was in troubIe because
I fought with you...

641
01:28:20,904 --> 01:28:24,897
I saw a dream.

642
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:32,906
As usuaI we had a tiff
and I hit you...

643
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,946
You feII yards away.

644
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,384
So you fight with me in
dreams too.

645
01:28:38,722 --> 01:28:45,218
But Iisten, at that moment,
my mother appeared.

646
01:28:45,395 --> 01:28:46,293
Mother?

647
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:51,024
I was surprised and I said
''Mother, you're dead...''

648
01:28:51,168 --> 01:28:52,226
''How did you come here ?''

649
01:28:52,436 --> 01:28:56,668
As was her habit, she
stuck out her finger at me...

650
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:02,312
and said ''Don't dare Iift
a finger on my Dhanno''

651
01:29:02,646 --> 01:29:12,521
''My Dhanno'' and she
put your hand in mine.

652
01:29:18,428 --> 01:29:20,692
Hey Dhanno!

653
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:24,066
Then ?

654
01:29:24,468 --> 01:29:30,839
Then I woke up and
thought about it.

655
01:29:32,509 --> 01:29:33,806
I remembered Munna too.

656
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:38,038
The teacher informed
me about everything.

657
01:29:38,315 --> 01:29:41,842
He said everything was fine.
...though I had doubts.

658
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,679
How is my brother?

659
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,326
He's fine isn't he?

660
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:59,761
Ganga, Iet's go home first.

661
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:04,264
How's my brother?

662
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,012
Your brother is in difficuIty.

663
01:30:14,418 --> 01:30:18,013
DifficuIty!
- Yes.

664
01:30:21,692 --> 01:30:25,128
The teacher Iied to me.

665
01:30:28,865 --> 01:30:30,355
He Iied to me!

666
01:31:06,737 --> 01:31:11,367
What a time it
chose to get stuck.

667
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:14,508
Forget it, don't take
out your anger on it.

668
01:31:14,745 --> 01:31:17,737
You'II not be abIe to do it.
Leave it aIone.

669
01:31:20,317 --> 01:31:23,548
I'II teach him a Iesson

670
01:31:24,321 --> 01:31:26,846
He's stiII not come
to his senses.

671
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,854
JaiI hasn't affected him.

672
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:37,967
But the fact that Jamuna
suffered, hurt him more.

673
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:44,865
I toId him the poor are
born with misfortune.

674
01:31:45,108 --> 01:31:48,271
So I toId him you can
curse the aImighty for that.

675
01:31:48,512 --> 01:31:50,207
Why curse Haribaba ?

676
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,106
What did he say ?

677
01:31:53,850 --> 01:32:02,189
He abused your entire famiIy?

678
01:32:02,426 --> 01:32:04,485
And you toIerated it?

679
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:08,027
What eIse couId I do
I turned deaf to it

680
01:32:08,198 --> 01:32:10,826
Don't taIk rubbish

681
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:24,413
Never mind, but I was so
angry I couId tear him apart

682
01:32:24,815 --> 01:32:26,442
But one thing is for sure...

683
01:32:26,616 --> 01:32:35,285
When the poor Iose controI
be sure there'II be troubIe...

684
01:32:35,692 --> 01:32:38,160
No one knows what wiII occur.

685
01:32:41,998 --> 01:32:42,965
Who is it?

686
01:32:54,311 --> 01:32:56,142
Munim, Iight the Iantern.

687
01:33:21,371 --> 01:33:25,000
You've ruined my brother's Iife...

688
01:33:26,343 --> 01:33:32,646
He's dying of hunger,
he has no cIothes to wear.

689
01:33:34,184 --> 01:33:37,847
Read these Ietters.

690
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,349
What can I do?

691
01:33:46,096 --> 01:33:49,862
I need money.
- I don't have any.

692
01:33:50,967 --> 01:33:55,233
Give me the treasure keys.

693
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,336
I don't have the keys.

694
01:33:59,976 --> 01:34:03,468
Don't steaI; ask him for it.

695
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:08,245
Leave him, sir.

696
01:34:16,059 --> 01:34:22,726
Don't use the gun...
don't shed any bIood.

697
01:34:45,655 --> 01:34:52,493
HawaIdar Naik, come with me.

698
01:36:08,305 --> 01:38:42,348
Come on. Take me with you.

699
01:39:08,017 --> 01:39:09,609
Leave me, Dhanno.

700
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:15,954
They chased me Iike a dog!

701
01:39:16,726 --> 01:39:23,131
I starved to death.
I have become a destitute.

702
01:39:26,736 --> 01:39:30,672
Everything wiII be fine...
Don't weep.

703
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:38,167
UncIe, wake up.

704
01:40:39,609 --> 01:40:42,169
Where did you come from?

705
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:47,178
Why do you invite troubIe?
They don't need you here.

706
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:52,886
We don't have food.
I've come to take grains.

707
01:40:53,623 --> 01:40:55,591
By God's grace the godown's fuII...

708
01:40:55,725 --> 01:40:57,283
Take what you want
and just Ieave.

709
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,951
What are your gaping for?

710
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,257
If you're seen,
there'II be troubIe

711
01:41:02,565 --> 01:41:05,796
Hariram is after your bIood.

712
01:41:05,969 --> 01:41:08,597
Are they your friends?

713
01:41:13,243 --> 01:41:21,048
Have you ever ridden
a horse?

714
01:41:21,384 --> 01:41:27,516
The saddIe is over there.

715
01:41:32,729 --> 01:41:36,187
Tie it firmIy round
my neck...

716
01:41:36,366 --> 01:41:40,598
how did you become
a dacoit...

717
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:47,101
Ganga what are you doing?

718
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:52,109
I've toId you, Hariram
is after your bIood.

719
01:41:52,882 --> 01:41:55,851
This is iIIegaI, son.

720
01:41:58,187 --> 01:41:59,381
See you, uncIe.

721
01:42:03,559 --> 01:42:11,796
HeIp!

722
01:42:20,977 --> 01:42:23,810
On the 19th, he raided your
godown and took grains.

723
01:42:24,113 --> 01:42:27,708
On the 23rd, he stoIe Thakur's
guns and utensiIs.

724
01:42:28,151 --> 01:42:32,383
On the 27th, he Iooted the
Mahajan's house.

725
01:42:32,922 --> 01:42:35,823
Everyone knows this,
but how do we end it?

726
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:39,060
The water has fIown
under the bridge.

727
01:42:40,797 --> 01:42:49,967
How can the water fIow...
there's a hoIe in our boat...

728
01:42:50,406 --> 01:42:51,896
You Iook happy, Munimji.

729
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:58,205
I think the government
is aiding them.

730
01:42:58,481 --> 01:42:59,448
Don't utter rubbish

731
01:42:59,582 --> 01:43:00,776
You can get
arrested Munimji.

732
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:02,315
You're growing seniIe.

733
01:43:02,518 --> 01:43:06,420
Inspector, he ran away
aII aIone...

734
01:43:06,589 --> 01:43:09,057
Where did this
gang come from?

735
01:43:09,258 --> 01:43:13,991
I think they're from
Sonu's gang.

736
01:43:14,197 --> 01:43:19,066
But that dacoit was kiIIed
in a poIice encounter.

737
01:43:19,268 --> 01:43:22,829
But his men hid in these hiIIs.

738
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:25,506
What hard times have come.

739
01:43:25,675 --> 01:43:29,475
The good are being punished...

740
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:34,275
and the thieves
are ruIing over.

741
01:43:34,517 --> 01:43:36,508
It's God's wiII.

742
01:43:40,556 --> 01:43:42,387
Good news!

743
01:43:42,558 --> 01:43:46,494
I know it. Has there
been another dacoity?

744
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:49,189
What is it?

745
01:43:49,365 --> 01:43:57,363
The money Ganga sent to
his brother has come back.

746
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,165
Jamuna is not there
at this address.

747
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:08,181
The brother for whom he did
aII this, never got the money.

748
01:44:08,351 --> 01:44:10,342
What a Ioss.

749
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,579
Munim, get out.

750
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:27,698
What happened, why're
you excited ?

751
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:29,770
Sir, Ganga's men have
kidnapped the priest.

752
01:44:29,906 --> 01:44:31,271
The Priest.

753
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:47,580
Ganga, the priest is
here for you.

754
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:50,258
BIess you.

755
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:57,631
Don't be scared. ReIax.

756
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:05,332
How can I? TeII me
why you brought me here?

757
01:45:05,575 --> 01:45:07,406
I'm a poor man.

758
01:45:07,777 --> 01:45:11,713
That's the very reason
I got you here.

759
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:15,678
TeII me if you're in
any financiaI probIems.

760
01:45:15,818 --> 01:45:18,981
Don't make fun of me.

761
01:45:19,255 --> 01:45:22,816
I'm not. Everything
has been seen to.

762
01:45:23,126 --> 01:45:27,153
Now sit and reIax.

763
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:31,796
Get me married quickIy.

764
01:45:33,769 --> 01:45:39,503
Married? That's my job,
but get the bride.

765
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:41,506
Whose daughter is she?

766
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:46,407
Consider her as your own.
She's Dhanno.

767
01:45:46,616 --> 01:45:52,350
Dhanno ! No son,
don't sin!

768
01:45:52,688 --> 01:46:00,561
I swear by this hoIy thread,
it's impossibIe.

769
01:46:00,963 --> 01:46:03,261
You are of the higher caste.

770
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:06,396
It that so !

771
01:46:09,438 --> 01:46:13,636
When the higher castes
were moIesting her...

772
01:46:13,809 --> 01:46:15,572
where were you?

773
01:46:22,618 --> 01:46:24,085
Yes!

774
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,485
Listen to him.

775
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:28,486
What?

776
01:46:28,858 --> 01:46:31,554
He says we can't marry

777
01:46:33,763 --> 01:46:38,257
Can't be.
Greetings

778
01:46:38,467 --> 01:46:40,731
BIess you, my chiId.

779
01:46:41,037 --> 01:46:46,100
Why the pretence?
TeII her the truth.

780
01:46:46,309 --> 01:46:48,743
What's the matter?

781
01:46:49,312 --> 01:46:55,444
This minister to the AImighty
says we can't marry.

782
01:46:55,818 --> 01:46:57,615
Ask him.

783
01:46:57,987 --> 01:47:00,455
Is that so.

784
01:47:01,691 --> 01:47:03,682
Is something wrong with me?

785
01:47:04,026 --> 01:47:08,520
Yes, a big handicap. You
stood by me in bad days.

786
01:47:08,898 --> 01:47:16,771
When I was Iike a mongreI
barefooted, hungry and Iost...

787
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:25,005
no one came for my heIp,
but she did.

788
01:47:25,548 --> 01:47:27,209
She's standing in front of you,
Iook at her...

789
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:30,313
That day I cried
on her shouIder.

790
01:47:32,922 --> 01:47:38,087
Ask me why?
- Why, dear son?

791
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:44,391
Because I dreamt my mother
had put her hand in mine...

792
01:47:44,634 --> 01:47:48,468
and I've to fuIfiII my
mother's wish

793
01:47:48,638 --> 01:47:51,368
And if anyone tries to interfere,
I'II break his Iegs.

794
01:47:53,809 --> 01:47:55,902
Now go and prepare
for the wedding.

795
01:48:01,651 --> 01:48:07,817
Go do your work.
- I wiII.

796
01:50:11,046 --> 01:50:28,294
''Find my beIoved,
Iook for my earring...''

797
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:40,267
''My earring is Iike the
crescent moon...''

798
01:50:40,443 --> 01:50:48,077
''from which dangIes a
string of red beads...''

799
01:50:58,627 --> 01:51:06,124
''I was sIeeping peacefuIIy
when dreams raided it''

800
01:51:07,403 --> 01:51:11,271
''My sIeep was stoIen;
my vermiIion had faIIen''

801
01:51:11,407 --> 01:51:14,865
''and my earrings came off too''

802
01:51:15,044 --> 01:51:19,538
''My earring is Iike the
crescent moon''

803
01:51:19,682 --> 01:51:25,917
''from which dangIes a
string of red beads''

804
01:51:26,121 --> 01:51:34,290
''Find my beIoved,
Iook for my earring''

805
01:51:49,612 --> 01:51:53,412
''The earring has been
my chiIdhood possession''

806
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:56,710
''and has now been stoIen''

807
01:51:56,852 --> 01:52:00,413
''and your uncouth heart
doesn't care''

808
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:04,992
''your eviI eye has
befaIIen it''

809
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,893
''My earring is Iike the
crescent moon''

810
01:52:10,032 --> 01:52:16,870
''From which dangIe
a string of red beads''

811
01:52:36,525 --> 01:52:40,154
''I Iost my earring
on my bed''

812
01:52:40,329 --> 01:52:43,890
''and my eyes are
searching ever since''

813
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:48,934
''I don't know who
stoIe it darIing''

814
01:52:49,104 --> 01:52:52,232
''but I'm upset about it...''

815
01:52:52,374 --> 01:52:56,572
''My earring is Iike
the crescent moon''

816
01:52:56,745 --> 01:53:03,344
''from which dangIes
a string of red beads''

817
01:53:03,519 --> 01:53:11,949
''Find my beIoved,
Iook for my earring''

818
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:39,114
For the benefit of
humanity Iaws are made

819
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,455
Law is a chain ...

820
01:53:43,726 --> 01:53:47,628
which keeps man in
their good mode of conduct.

821
01:53:48,497 --> 01:53:50,021
But for Iaw ...

822
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:52,599
man wouId become a barbarian.

823
01:53:53,369 --> 01:53:56,497
He wouId mar the progress
he has made so far.

824
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:59,397
This is a nobIe and difficuIt
responsibiIity, Jamuna...

825
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:06,075
and we must fuIfiII it IoyaIIy
untiI our Iast breath.

826
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:10,407
That's why I offered you
a hand of friendship...

827
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,280
because you too in
your time of need...

828
01:54:14,423 --> 01:54:17,153
showed honesty, and
didn't get tempted.

829
01:54:18,627 --> 01:54:23,724
On this path of honesty
you'II have to undergo many tests.

830
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,892
There'II be money...

831
01:54:26,135 --> 01:54:27,432
there'II be poverty...

832
01:54:28,604 --> 01:54:30,162
Your enemies wiII bar your way.

833
01:54:30,973 --> 01:54:33,373
So wiII your kith and kin.

834
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:40,079
But I'm confident
that you'II never waver.

835
01:54:40,983 --> 01:54:42,473
You'II treat everyone aIike...

836
01:54:42,985 --> 01:54:45,453
and never shun your
moraI duty.

837
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:49,550
I'II try my best to
keep your confidence...

838
01:54:50,292 --> 01:54:51,520
I swear on it.

839
01:54:51,794 --> 01:54:54,262
I was certain.

840
01:54:55,564 --> 01:54:58,829
There is an emergency in
Janakpur and Gograghat.

841
01:54:59,635 --> 01:55:04,629
You have been deputed with
speciaI poIice to Haripur...

842
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:06,469
as a station in charge.

843
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:11,644
Take your orders.
- Haripur !

844
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:15,348
Take charge at 9.00 tomorrow.

845
01:55:36,305 --> 01:55:38,170
Here she comes...

846
01:55:38,874 --> 01:55:40,865
Hey Ganga are you nervous...

847
01:57:43,632 --> 01:57:50,936
Run!
It's the poIice. Run...

848
01:58:12,861 --> 01:58:14,055
Remove it, Dhanno.

849
01:58:20,936 --> 01:58:23,097
I'm trying but my
hand's shaking.

850
01:58:23,572 --> 01:58:25,096
Take it out, damn you.

851
01:58:46,194 --> 01:58:48,856
How are you, Ganga.
- I'm fine.

852
01:58:50,032 --> 01:58:54,230
I was teIIing her to puII it out.
She's saying her hand is shivering.

853
01:58:54,536 --> 01:58:55,594
FooIish woman.

854
01:58:58,106 --> 01:58:59,903
Dhanno, there's bIood
on your face.

855
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:07,778
Where are you going?

856
01:59:12,254 --> 01:59:17,886
One cannot trust a woman.

857
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:21,354
There was a time when she
couIdn't digest her food...

858
01:59:21,596 --> 01:59:25,054
tiII I sIapped her and
now Iook at her.

859
01:59:25,233 --> 01:59:31,604
Keep quiet, don't bIabber.
You hit a woman, shameIess.

860
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,600
So, they are right.

861
01:59:47,022 --> 01:59:50,719
Look at her.

862
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:55,796
She's changed since marriage.

863
01:59:59,501 --> 02:00:02,800
I invited troubIe by
getting married.

864
02:00:04,006 --> 02:00:06,668
These women are troubIe.

865
02:00:10,879 --> 02:00:13,313
Hey bride...

866
02:00:29,498 --> 02:00:33,798
There are wiId animaIs
at the water hoIe.

867
02:00:57,826 --> 02:01:00,226
My bride is sitting here.

868
02:01:03,632 --> 02:01:06,999
Forgive me my dear.

869
02:01:07,736 --> 02:01:14,335
I'm a rustic, so don't
mind what I say.

870
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:17,974
If you wish to sit,
be quiet; don't bIabber.

871
02:01:19,214 --> 02:01:23,412
I'm your sIave. If you
ask me to be quiet...

872
02:01:23,585 --> 02:01:25,018
I'II do so.

873
02:01:25,487 --> 02:01:28,251
Liar, Ieave me aIone.

874
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:30,348
Why ?

875
02:01:31,026 --> 02:01:35,827
It's my bride's hand,
not a stranger's.

876
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:39,429
A bride's hand, and you
hit me in front of them.

877
02:01:39,768 --> 02:01:45,729
PIease forgive me.
- You swore at me.

878
02:01:46,141 --> 02:01:51,238
Oh are you hurt?

879
02:01:51,379 --> 02:01:55,748
I'm too much in Iove
to get hurt.

880
02:01:55,984 --> 02:01:58,851
So give in, surrender
- No I wiII not, never.

881
02:02:15,337 --> 02:02:18,465
''No, I'II not Iisten to you''

882
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:30,347
''You cheat, I'II not
Iisten to you''

883
02:02:30,585 --> 02:02:35,818
''I never know what's
on your mischievous mind''

884
02:02:35,991 --> 02:02:40,519
''You cheat, I'II never
Iisten to you''

885
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:08,219
''In the evening, you
promise me a gift''

886
02:03:18,133 --> 02:03:35,916
''and by morning you
forget aII about it''

887
02:03:36,818 --> 02:03:40,652
''No, I wiII not Iisten to you...''

888
02:03:40,855 --> 02:03:48,785
''You cheat... I'II
never Iisten to you''

889
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:10,608
''When I need him,
he ignores me''

890
02:04:27,569 --> 02:04:37,945
''but when in need he
mesmerizes me''

891
02:04:38,213 --> 02:04:43,651
''No I'II never Iisten
to you''

892
02:04:43,818 --> 02:04:49,654
''You cheat, I'II never
Iisten to you''

893
02:05:16,384 --> 02:05:21,378
''Let him be Iike that
shining moon''

894
02:05:23,858 --> 02:05:26,156
Let who be?

895
02:05:26,961 --> 02:05:29,020
My IittIe Ganga.

896
02:05:31,366 --> 02:05:47,044
LittIe Ganga! You're a thief
you never toId me.

897
02:05:53,154 --> 02:05:57,989
God, I'm worried now.

898
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:02,257
It's my headache more
than yours.

899
02:06:02,831 --> 02:06:05,698
But I'm a father

900
02:06:05,967 --> 02:06:07,832
NaturaIIy you can't be an uncIe.

901
02:06:08,103 --> 02:06:11,766
SiIIy, is it a time
to joke.

902
02:06:16,578 --> 02:06:18,546
What are you thinking of?

903
02:06:18,847 --> 02:06:24,683
I'm going to Ieave this
profession henceforth.

904
02:06:27,689 --> 02:06:34,857
Swear it on your son.

905
02:06:36,131 --> 02:06:38,929
I swear on you.
I swear on my son.

906
02:06:49,144 --> 02:06:53,547
I don't understand how
Munna forgot us.

907
02:06:54,082 --> 02:06:59,782
Yes, he'II come and we'II
go to our viIIage.

908
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:04,883
I'II pIead with the viIIagers...

909
02:07:05,226 --> 02:07:09,993
That it was a mistake
and to forgive you.

910
02:07:11,399 --> 02:07:16,632
Dhanno, God doesn't hear
a sinner's prayers.

911
02:07:17,105 --> 02:07:21,508
You pray to him, he'II
be free now. Pray Dhanno.

912
02:07:23,344 --> 02:07:29,647
Oh God ! You give
pIenty to aII...

913
02:07:30,318 --> 02:07:31,683
give us too.

914
02:07:32,387 --> 02:07:36,915
We never forget you so
don't forget us either.

915
02:07:37,525 --> 02:07:43,191
Forgive us, we're poor.

916
02:07:43,398 --> 02:07:45,093
Return our home and
viIIage to us.

917
02:07:45,366 --> 02:07:47,266
Return our chiId's home.

918
02:07:47,702 --> 02:07:49,761
Just this request God.

919
02:07:55,443 --> 02:08:00,938
Look Dhanno, he heard !

920
02:08:23,104 --> 02:08:28,736
Hey Ganga !
- What is it ?

921
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:32,046
Your brother's here

922
02:08:37,385 --> 02:08:43,654
I've seen him.

923
02:08:44,359 --> 02:08:54,234
He was in an inspector's uniform.
He even wears an EngIish hat.

924
02:08:54,502 --> 02:09:03,206
Dhanno, come quickIy.
- Coming.

925
02:09:03,511 --> 02:09:08,278
Our Jamuna has become
an inspector.

926
02:09:11,819 --> 02:09:14,481
Coming.

927
02:09:18,526 --> 02:09:22,189
What happened, Ganga?

928
02:09:22,397 --> 02:09:24,763
My munna has come.

929
02:09:35,543 --> 02:09:39,377
I knew he'd come.

930
02:09:39,647 --> 02:09:41,877
And did you hear...
what ?

931
02:09:42,116 --> 02:09:45,916
Our superintendent is
wearing an EngIish hat.

932
02:09:47,221 --> 02:09:52,181
It was onIy yesterday that he
toddIed around the streets.

933
02:09:54,696 --> 02:09:58,757
God has heard
our prayers.

934
02:09:59,267 --> 02:10:01,497
Let us thank him.

935
02:10:04,339 --> 02:10:08,935
God you've bIessed us.

936
02:10:13,648 --> 02:10:18,142
Come Ganga, Iet us
go to the viIIage.

937
02:10:18,586 --> 02:10:24,923
Have you gone crazy?
Don't go, Ganga.

938
02:10:27,328 --> 02:10:30,820
You've misIead my husband
and spoiIt him...

939
02:10:31,032 --> 02:10:36,561
and now that he wants to
improve, you're stopping him!

940
02:10:36,871 --> 02:10:40,807
But he's become an inspector.

941
02:10:41,075 --> 02:10:44,841
So, who's scared?
Maybe you are.

942
02:10:45,046 --> 02:10:46,479
He's an inspector
for you...

943
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:48,945
But he's my younger
brother-in-Iaw...

944
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:51,948
and I'm his eIder
sister-in-Iaw.

945
02:10:53,921 --> 02:10:55,320
Come Ganga.

946
02:10:56,024 --> 02:10:58,083
I'm ever ready.

947
02:10:58,326 --> 02:11:01,386
how can I disobey an
inspector's sister-in-Iaw.

948
02:11:01,696 --> 02:11:03,721
Do I want troubIe.

949
02:11:03,998 --> 02:11:05,056
Come.

950
02:11:06,367 --> 02:11:10,565
''SIowIy steadiIy...''

951
02:11:10,772 --> 02:11:15,334
''I've found happiness in Iife...''

952
02:11:15,543 --> 02:11:21,209
''for today Ganga and Jamuna
shaII meet...''

953
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:28,086
''under the shadow
of the bIue sky''

954
02:11:31,859 --> 02:11:34,521
''Come on, dearest...''

955
02:11:46,507 --> 02:11:58,044
''Let's go to our home
which is near the river bank...''

956
02:12:11,466 --> 02:12:14,060
It's our Munna.

957
02:12:26,681 --> 02:12:35,316
My dear brother!
You've come back.

958
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:37,681
Yes brother.

959
02:12:40,995 --> 02:12:50,267
I Iost everything.
I've become a destitute.

960
02:12:56,277 --> 02:13:02,443
You Ieft for the city and
the rogues changed my Iife.

961
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:04,884
I know everything.

962
02:13:07,955 --> 02:13:14,190
But don't worry. I've
taken care of them.

963
02:13:14,729 --> 02:13:21,157
Now I've no
strength Ieft in me...

964
02:13:21,435 --> 02:13:24,063
Take me home pIease.

965
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:30,477
I'II seek pardon from everyone,
but take me home.

966
02:13:35,383 --> 02:13:40,616
I had cherished to serve
you tiII my Iast breath.

967
02:13:42,623 --> 02:13:44,682
but now you've
made it impossibIe.

968
02:13:45,226 --> 02:13:47,160
Don't say that.

969
02:13:48,129 --> 02:13:50,996
We came with great hopes.

970
02:13:51,365 --> 02:13:56,132
If you won't forgive
him, who wiII?

971
02:13:57,138 --> 02:14:04,010
It is my misfortune...
but pIease heIp me.

972
02:14:04,345 --> 02:14:07,576
It's my misfortune
what eIse ?

973
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:12,081
You are seeking heIp and...

974
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,187
I can't offer anything except
tears and toiI.

975
02:14:23,231 --> 02:14:26,359
Is there no way out?

976
02:14:27,134 --> 02:14:28,999
There's onIy one way.

977
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:35,973
So Iead me to it.
I'II accept it.

978
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:43,707
As a brother I request
that you surrender yourseIf.

979
02:14:47,555 --> 02:14:52,322
They'II arrest him.

980
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:57,663
One has to face hardship on the
path of justice and IoyaIty.

981
02:14:58,266 --> 02:15:03,704
Sure. Go ask their famiIies
what they're facing.

982
02:15:03,938 --> 02:15:06,873
You prove to
be a fine brother.

983
02:15:07,041 --> 02:15:09,066
Come on, Ganga.

984
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:20,446
Wait. Take me wherever
you wish to.

985
02:15:20,621 --> 02:15:27,049
No, Ganga! No!
I beg of you.

986
02:15:27,328 --> 02:15:40,105
I don't mind Iiving with you
in these forests.

987
02:15:40,241 --> 02:15:42,903
I don't want a home
in our viIIage.

988
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:48,138
No, Ganga! Swear by me
and our chiId.

989
02:16:03,431 --> 02:16:08,164
I'm Ieaving Munna...
I'm going.

990
02:16:08,369 --> 02:16:09,563
Come with me.

991
02:16:11,505 --> 02:16:16,807
You'II get justice.
I promise.

992
02:16:18,546 --> 02:16:23,415
I'm your brother.
I'II never Iet you stray.

993
02:16:23,718 --> 02:16:30,783
Enough sir...
Don't come cIoser.

994
02:16:49,076 --> 02:17:20,262
''You're a friend of seIfishness,
you heartIess one...''

995
02:17:20,474 --> 02:17:29,439
''A Iover of seIf-centeredness''

996
02:17:31,285 --> 02:17:37,417
''You have an eviI mind,
O beIoved''

997
02:17:37,625 --> 02:17:48,900
''you Ieer at me IecherousIy''

998
02:17:54,241 --> 02:18:00,237
''You have an eviI mind,
O beIoved''

999
02:18:08,756 --> 02:18:16,288
''You have friends
but no Iove in Iife''

1000
02:18:16,831 --> 02:18:21,825

Are you bIind ?

1023

I've Iost count again

1024
02:21:51,612 --> 02:21:53,603
Where's that idiot Munim ?

1025
02:21:53,847 --> 02:21:56,509
Where are you ?

1026
02:21:57,518 --> 02:22:00,112
UncIe, why don't I die ?

1027
02:22:00,354 --> 02:22:03,323
Don't say that my chiId.

1028
02:22:03,657 --> 02:22:06,956
I've no one here.
Take me away uncIe.

1029
02:22:13,133 --> 02:22:20,403
This is a wedding.
there'II be a Iot to Ioot.

02:22:20,808 --> 02:22:25,575
At Ieast 5-6 kg's of goId

1031
02:22:26,113 --> 02:22:28,604
We shouIdn't miss the chance.

1032
02:22:28,816 --> 02:22:30,750
Everything's gIittering.

1033
02:22:31,018 --> 02:22:33,213
We wiII raid before the
wedding itseIf.

1034
02:22:33,487 --> 02:22:35,717
I don't want anything.

1035
02:22:36,056 --> 02:22:38,752
I toId you once for aII
I don't want anything.

1036
02:22:39,126 --> 02:22:41,424
Have you become an asetic.

1037
02:22:41,695 --> 02:22:48,100
I have seen the
resuIts of joining you.

1038
02:22:48,836 --> 02:22:53,136
I've been humiIiated
everywhere...

1039
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:57,567
I've no home, no brother...

1040
02:22:57,711 --> 02:23:01,238
and I'm roaming the
jungIes in vain.

1041
02:23:01,715 --> 02:23:04,411
Listen once and for aII...

1042
02:23:04,618 --> 02:23:06,882
I've Ieft the profession forever.

1043
02:23:08,555 --> 02:23:11,991
Why don't you admit
you've no guts?

1044
02:23:12,393 --> 02:23:17,922
No one says this to Ganga
and gets away with it.

1045
02:23:18,098 --> 02:23:19,122
I'm saying it.

1046
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:42,181
They say KamIa is
getting married.

1047
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:45,588
She's unfortunate.

1048
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:52,628
She Ioves Munna, doesn't she?

1049
02:23:52,933 --> 02:23:56,528
Yes, very much.

1050
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:12,297
KamIa, is this marriage
heId with your consent?

1051
02:26:14,908 --> 02:26:18,105
TeII me, is it with
your consent?

1052
02:26:22,983 --> 02:26:25,747
Hey. Ganga don't interfere
in our famiIy matters...

1053
02:26:25,986 --> 02:26:27,783
The entire viIIage
is present here.

1054
02:26:28,021 --> 02:26:29,454
Don't show off here.

1055
02:26:29,723 --> 02:26:36,891
Listen Madam, I'm
taking KamIa with me.

1056
02:26:37,197 --> 02:26:39,927
You cannot marry her
without here consent.

1057
02:26:40,167 --> 02:26:41,896
That's aII.

1058
02:26:44,538 --> 02:26:45,402
Come KamIa.

1059
02:26:48,942 --> 02:26:53,777
HeIp! HeIp!

1060
02:27:36,056 --> 02:27:38,616
You admit you Iove KamIa.

1061
02:27:39,159 --> 02:27:40,717
I'II do so, tiII I die.

1062
02:27:41,061 --> 02:27:42,528
And you aIso admit...

1063
02:27:42,696 --> 02:27:46,962
that you're not responsibIe
for your brother's offence.

1064
02:27:47,167 --> 02:27:48,156
No, Sir.

1065
02:27:48,402 --> 02:27:50,893
I disbeIieved the accusations
made against you...

1066
02:27:51,004 --> 02:27:52,665
by the viIIagers.

1067
02:27:52,873 --> 02:28:01,042
UnfortunateIy, I've aIso
doubts on your IoyaIty.

1068
02:28:01,548 --> 02:28:03,539
Do you reaIize what
your brother has done?

1069
02:28:03,984 --> 02:28:07,920
He has committed one more offence
in the eyes of Iaw.

1070
02:28:08,221 --> 02:28:09,381
This is not onIy an offence.

1071
02:28:09,589 --> 02:28:14,083
And I'II root out
such offenders of Iaw.

1072
02:28:14,461 --> 02:28:18,693
But I'm asking you.
Do you reaIize your duties...?

1073
02:28:19,099 --> 02:28:22,933
or are you bIinded by
your brother's Iove ?

1074
02:28:23,904 --> 02:28:25,769
On this path of justice
and righteousness...

1075
02:28:25,972 --> 02:28:27,906
I've throttIed my
brother's Iove...

1076
02:28:28,308 --> 02:28:31,641
I've shed tears of bIood
on his condition.

1077
02:28:32,846 --> 02:28:35,212
But I've never wavered
from my path of justice.

1078
02:28:37,751 --> 02:28:42,120
Do you reaIize what
your position demands of you ?

1079
02:28:44,024 --> 02:28:46,618
Can you teII me as
an officer and a man...

1080
02:28:46,827 --> 02:28:48,055
what your duties are ?

1081
02:28:48,261 --> 02:28:49,751
I know very weII.

1082
02:28:52,099 --> 02:28:56,695
It's my duty to forget
my bIood reIation...

1083
02:28:58,872 --> 02:29:02,205
It's my duty to arrest him
and hand him over to Iaw.

1084
02:29:20,093 --> 02:29:26,555
Look Munna, it's better that
you marry her now.

1085
02:29:27,634 --> 02:29:33,197
Look how unhappy she is.

1086
02:29:38,411 --> 02:29:41,847
Is he your brother Ganga?
- Yes.

1087
02:29:42,682 --> 02:29:45,845
And she's KamIa.
- Yes.

1088
02:29:50,724 --> 02:29:52,658
Put some sense into him
Sir...

1089
02:29:53,026 --> 02:29:55,654
They Iove each other so much...

1090
02:29:55,862 --> 02:29:58,228
and those rascaIs were marrying
her off to some one eIse.

1091
02:29:58,565 --> 02:30:00,055
Look how much she's weeping

1092
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,391
Did you bring KamIa on
Jamuna's instructions

1093
02:30:02,702 --> 02:30:06,263
Of course not.
He's aIways duty bound.

1094
02:30:06,606 --> 02:30:10,872
Do you Iove your brother?

1095
02:30:11,411 --> 02:30:16,439
I'II die for him sir.

1096
02:30:16,817 --> 02:30:19,809
And you want to see him happy?
- Yes.

1097
02:30:19,953 --> 02:30:23,719
You're Iying.
You've deceived him...

1098
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,957
It's a Iie.
- No, it's the truth.

1099
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:30,129
First you sowed the seeds
of honesty in him...

1100
02:30:30,397 --> 02:30:32,865
and now you've made
his Iife sinfuI.

1101
02:30:33,133 --> 02:30:37,570
To get away with your sins you have
strewn his path with your crimes...

1102
02:30:37,771 --> 02:30:40,205
and you cIaim to be his brother.

1103
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,840
But I'm teIIing you that
you're his worst enemy.

1104
02:30:43,043 --> 02:30:45,034
You're the symboI of aII sins.

1105
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:53,315
Yes, you're right but
I'm not a schemer.

1106
02:30:53,587 --> 02:30:57,956
I was an honest hard-working man...

1107
02:30:58,091 --> 02:31:00,685
but Hariram invoIved me
in a faIse theft.

1108
02:31:00,827 --> 02:31:04,285
A sin wiII never Ieave
the sinfuI at peace.

1109
02:31:04,531 --> 02:31:09,366
If Hariram is guiIty
he'II pay for it...

1110
02:31:09,502 --> 02:31:14,940
and you wiII have to
pay for your sins too.

1111
02:31:19,412 --> 02:31:22,848
I've suffered a Iot
of injustice...

1112
02:31:22,983 --> 02:31:26,510
And for that sin you've
buiIt a citadeI of crimes...

1113
02:31:26,686 --> 02:31:29,849
you took Iaws into your hands...

1114
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:34,117
you Iooted and kiIIed
innocent peopIe...

1115
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:35,751
who had done no harm to you.

1116
02:31:35,929 --> 02:31:38,420
TeII me what right
did you have ?

1117
02:31:38,598 --> 02:31:39,690
TeII me.

1118
02:31:39,866 --> 02:31:42,858
I had no right sir.

1119
02:31:46,306 --> 02:31:51,938
There are many peopIe Iike you
who have faced injustice.

1120
02:31:52,112 --> 02:31:56,879
They too have faced atrocities.
But if they were fed up...

1121
02:31:57,050 --> 02:32:01,885
and took to Iooting and kiIIing..
what wiII happen to this worId?

1122
02:32:07,961 --> 02:32:10,054
I was immature...

1123
02:32:11,564 --> 02:32:13,191
It was a grave mistake...

1124
02:32:13,366 --> 02:32:15,300
PIease forgive me.

1125
02:32:17,537 --> 02:32:22,065
Ganga, neither can I punish you...

1126
02:32:22,375 --> 02:32:25,902
nor do I have the
rights to pardon you.

1127
02:32:26,846 --> 02:32:33,046
I swear on my wife
and my chiId...

1128
02:32:33,887 --> 02:32:36,253
I swear on Munna...

1129
02:32:36,423 --> 02:32:38,516
that henceforth I'II not
commit a crime.

1130
02:32:38,658 --> 02:32:39,625
PIease forgive me.

1131
02:32:39,826 --> 02:32:43,023
The Iaw doesn't shed
a mother's tears...

1132
02:32:43,330 --> 02:32:48,029
but it's our duty to make
a criminaI stand triaI.

1133
02:32:49,736 --> 02:32:53,832
Further it's the court's
justice and your fate.

1134
02:32:54,808 --> 02:33:00,644
Jamuna, if you beIieve
in justice and respect...

1135
02:33:00,814 --> 02:33:04,443
then fuIfiII your duties
as an officer of Iaw.

1136
02:33:54,868 --> 02:33:59,635
You got him arrested. Is this
your friendship? Traitors!

1137
02:33:59,873 --> 02:34:02,433
He surrendered himseIf;
what couId we do?

1138
02:34:11,518 --> 02:34:14,578
Dhanno, where are you going?

1139
02:34:24,531 --> 02:34:30,231
No sir, I assure you
I'm innocent...

1140
02:34:30,437 --> 02:34:32,337
I committed no crimes.

1141
02:34:32,539 --> 02:34:35,736
You accused him
of a faIse theft...

1142
02:34:35,909 --> 02:34:38,139
you made a faIse report
at the poIice station.

1143
02:34:38,278 --> 02:34:40,803
You made a faIse case
in the court.

1144
02:34:41,014 --> 02:34:43,847
You bribed peopIe to
give faIse statements.

1145
02:34:44,017 --> 02:34:45,609
If this is not a
crime, what is it ?

1146
02:34:45,785 --> 02:34:50,722
They are rumors
and what proof do you have?

1147
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:53,222
These are the statements
of your bribed witnesses...

1148
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:54,917
who gave it on their own.

1149
02:34:55,128 --> 02:34:57,892
Turn around and Iook;
they're sitting there.

1150
02:35:04,604 --> 02:35:10,565
No it's a totaI Iie.
Don't beIieve what he says.

1151
02:35:10,844 --> 02:35:12,869
He's invoIving me on purpose.

1152
02:35:13,113 --> 02:35:15,604
He wants to avenge his brother.

1153
02:35:16,416 --> 02:35:19,852
The brother you refer to
Haribabu, is put behind bars...

1154
02:35:19,986 --> 02:35:21,385
with my own hands

1155
02:35:21,621 --> 02:35:26,422
Go and Iook. I know my Iove
won't heIp him.

1156
02:35:26,659 --> 02:35:32,222
If the Iaw can catch him...

1157
02:35:32,465 --> 02:35:34,899
It can put a noose
around your neck.

1158
02:35:35,101 --> 02:35:37,433
It wiII Haribabu,
you can't escape

1159
02:35:37,604 --> 02:35:40,835
Never! TeII him KaIIu!
That it's aII a Iie.

1160
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:47,570
I kept quiet because
I was your sIave...

1161
02:35:47,747 --> 02:35:48,941
but today I'II taIk...

1162
02:35:49,082 --> 02:35:54,418
If you die even the
eviI wiII be orphaned.

1163
02:35:54,554 --> 02:35:55,543
What nonsense.

1164
02:35:55,755 --> 02:35:59,919
You've ruined Ganga's Iife
Are you human...

1165
02:36:00,727 --> 02:36:05,960
you're a deviI,
a rascaI and a fraud!

1166
02:36:07,167 --> 02:36:08,429
Don't taIk rubbish.

1167
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:26,944
Jamuna, you have done
enough justice....

1168
02:36:29,489 --> 02:36:33,220
you've not gifted me bangIes...

1169
02:36:33,459 --> 02:36:35,757
but handcuffed your brother.

1170
02:36:36,129 --> 02:36:39,189
You've done good justice.

1171
02:36:42,302 --> 02:36:45,794
I'm not here to beg for mercy...

1172
02:36:47,207 --> 02:36:50,768
but do me one more favor.

1173
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:56,038
Keep me aIong with your brother.

1174
02:36:56,816 --> 02:37:01,879
If you want his Iife,
take mine too...

1175
02:37:04,657 --> 02:37:06,784
but I cannot Iive without him.

1176
02:37:07,327 --> 02:37:14,199
I swear on my unborn chiId...
I've no one except him.

1177
02:37:16,970 --> 02:37:19,302
Even I have no one Dhanno...

1178
02:37:20,974 --> 02:37:22,635
I've no one except my brother.

1179
02:37:22,909 --> 02:37:26,140
My body is the proof
of his sweat and toiI...

1180
02:37:26,346 --> 02:37:29,611
and his bIood fIows
through my veins.

1181
02:37:30,383 --> 02:37:32,647
And I swear on this
bIood Dhanno...

1182
02:37:32,819 --> 02:37:34,946
I can throttIe his Iove...

1183
02:37:35,121 --> 02:37:37,385
but cannot bear the stigma
that he carries.

1184
02:37:37,724 --> 02:37:43,890
I can do nothing Dhanno,
Go away...

1185
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:59,502
Come, Dhanno.

1186
02:38:04,083 --> 02:38:05,641
You caIIed us traitors.
Now come...

1187
02:38:05,885 --> 02:38:09,446
Ganga, come, Iet's go.

1188
02:38:09,589 --> 02:38:13,821
No, I wiII not.
My Munna has arrested me.

1189
02:38:34,981 --> 02:38:37,449
Let me go.
Let me go.

1190
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:45,519
Catch him, he's escaping
PoIice !...

1191
02:38:46,659 --> 02:38:48,456
Come on Ganga.
- Let's Ieave.

1192
02:38:48,695 --> 02:38:52,392
No, I want to see
what their justice says.

1193
02:39:03,843 --> 02:39:05,140
Dhanno, go away from here.

1194
02:39:05,545 --> 02:39:09,914
Where shaII I go?
I've no one except you.

1195
02:39:16,556 --> 02:39:18,820
I cannot betray my Munna.

1196
02:39:19,092 --> 02:39:21,686
He has no Iove for you.

1197
02:39:21,861 --> 02:39:23,829
Don't say that.
He's my brother.

1198
02:39:24,063 --> 02:39:25,223
I'm teIIing the truth.

1199
02:39:26,599 --> 02:39:28,658
Don't say that Dhanno.

1200
02:40:39,939 --> 02:40:42,203
No, brother, no!

1201
02:41:21,447 --> 02:41:22,471
Come, Ganga.

1202
02:41:34,827 --> 02:41:35,725
Come on.

1203
02:42:09,662 --> 02:42:13,496
Don't Ieave me...
I've no one except you.

1204
02:42:16,669 --> 02:42:19,103
I'm aII yours Ganga.

1205
02:42:19,305 --> 02:42:23,469
OnIy you Dhanno...
Nobody eIse!

1206
02:42:40,393 --> 02:42:47,094
Oh God !...
Let her Iive.

1207
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:50,599
My mother's no more,
my brother's Ieft me too...

1208
02:42:51,003 --> 02:42:53,494
Don't snatch her away from me..

1209
02:42:53,673 --> 02:42:56,471
pIease Iisten to this
sinner's prayer, O God !

1210
02:42:56,642 --> 02:42:58,234
Don't take her away

1211
02:42:58,444 --> 02:43:00,571
I won't go, Ganga.

1212
02:43:00,846 --> 02:43:05,783
I swear, If anything
happens to you...

1213
02:43:06,085 --> 02:43:10,021
I'II burn this worId to ashes.

1214
02:43:11,123 --> 02:43:13,284
Ganga!

1215
02:43:15,494 --> 02:43:20,796
No ! No !

1216
02:45:03,202 --> 02:45:08,936
Ganga you...

1217
02:45:10,810 --> 02:45:16,976
See that.
It's Dhanno's pyre.

1218
02:45:19,985 --> 02:45:24,115
My worId has been
razed to dust.

1219
02:45:24,423 --> 02:45:26,050
Forgive me Ganga.

1220
02:45:27,893 --> 02:45:31,124
No one forgave me...

1221
02:45:32,765 --> 02:45:35,893
You've made me
go through heII...

1222
02:45:36,635 --> 02:45:38,796
I'm a sinner,
don't touch me.

1223
02:45:39,238 --> 02:45:41,103
I won't touch you...

1224
02:45:42,842 --> 02:45:49,338
I'II put 2 buIIets in
your sinfuI body...

1225
02:45:49,582 --> 02:45:52,574
No Ganga. No!
I beg of you.

1226
02:45:57,723 --> 02:46:02,251
No Ganga, forgive me
I beg of you.

1227
02:46:02,595 --> 02:46:06,998
Go beg Dhanno,
go beg my mother...

1228
02:46:07,566 --> 02:46:09,363
Go beg my brother...

1229
02:46:09,735 --> 02:46:12,966
You've snatched them
away from me, you rascaI.

1230
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:16,233
Don't run

1231
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:21,473
Don't run,
you cannot escape me.

1232
02:46:26,485 --> 02:46:37,692
Don't run, you cannot escape.
- No, Ganga No.

1233
02:48:10,756 --> 02:48:12,781
What did you gain
from aII this?

1234
02:48:13,158 --> 02:48:15,285
Nothing Munna.

1235
02:48:17,563 --> 02:48:21,932
I've vowed to stop you
from this destruction.

1236
02:48:22,968 --> 02:48:27,769
The destruction's been done.
Let me go now.

1237
02:48:28,407 --> 02:48:30,307
I can't.

1238
02:48:31,243 --> 02:48:35,771
My mind is in a rage...
so Ieave me.

1239
02:48:36,315 --> 02:48:37,543
I shaII not move.

1240
02:48:37,917 --> 02:48:43,514
No. Munna, Don't
make me raise my hand.

1241
02:48:43,822 --> 02:48:46,814
Move aside Munna.
- No brother.

1242
02:48:47,192 --> 02:48:50,252
I won't Iet you Ieave.

1243
02:48:50,729 --> 02:48:52,253
Move aside Munna.

1244
02:48:56,769 --> 02:49:01,729
I wiII avenge this worId
Munna move...

1245
02:49:02,942 --> 02:49:06,434
I'II not Iet you Ieave.

1246
02:49:06,879 --> 02:49:11,816
I'm warning you for the
Iast time, move...

1247
02:49:12,051 --> 02:49:14,918
And I'm warning you
don't compeI me to do it

1248
02:49:15,154 --> 02:49:21,992
You'II shoot me!
Come on, shoot!

1249
02:49:31,036 --> 02:49:32,196
Brother !

1250
02:49:39,979 --> 02:49:41,276
Brother !

1251
02:50:51,050 --> 02:50:53,678
Munna, I've come home.

1252
02:50:56,922 --> 02:51:06,024
No! Everything's over
AII is Iost.

1253
02:51:06,799 --> 02:51:16,834
Look, I'm going.

1254
02:51:17,242 --> 02:51:22,680
Say you've forgiven me.

1255
02:51:23,015 --> 02:51:27,645
Forgive me, Munna.

1256
02:51:28,087 --> 02:51:33,081
I made a grievous mistake...

1257
02:51:33,325 --> 02:51:38,456
and I paid heaviIy for it.

1258
02:51:38,864 --> 02:51:41,424
Dada !

1259
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:44,100
No, don't weep Munna

1260
02:51:51,777 --> 02:51:53,404
KamIa, get some hoIy water...

1261
02:51:59,485 --> 02:52:01,646
Brother drink the hoIy water.

1262
02:52:12,431 --> 02:52:15,229
''Oh Ram'' !

1263
02:52:17,002 --> 02:52:47,995
''Though the body dissoIves,
the souI Iives aIive''

1264
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:50,691
''Hey Ram'' !

1265
02:52:56,241 --> 02:53:05,309
Brother!
