2
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,264
A quiet evening.
The birds have flown home.

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,601
A courtyard bathed in light.
A tired football game.

4
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,170
An old song on the radio.

5
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,603
A silent dog.

6
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,011
Suddenly the clang of cymbals.

7
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,748
And Goddess Durga appears
in the sky.

8
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,242
All eyes follow her.

9
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,546
Manohar uncle stunned,
so are Karma and Vimla.

10
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,555
Her shadow looms
over the neighbourhood...

11
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,989
tearing through the sky.
as "She" advances.

12
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,201
But no one knew...

13
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,576
on a roof in that same lane...

14
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,811
a man stood between
life and death.

15
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,917
They say your life flashes in front of
your eyes before you die.

16
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,323
But the only thing he could see...

17
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,557
Was the face of that girl.

18
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,593
Many teach you how to love...

19
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,598
..alas no one teaches you
how to forget that love.

20
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,508
"My Sweet Bindu."

21
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,921
Love is not an easy thing.

22
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,125
This much I know.

23
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,420
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

24
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,858
You do not know how to drown.

25
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,902
Miss Chawla......

26
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,609
You seem very opposed to
Abhimanyu Roy's novels.

27
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,912
His stories are exploitative.

28
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,405
His worlds. dark and bitter.

29
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,582
All his characters are like him.
negative. angry and horny.

30
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,453
And he portrays all his women
as heartless witches.

31
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,724
None of his characters are real.
I tell you.

32
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,431
Mr.Roy?

33
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,430
Obviously my characters
aren't real.

34
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,301
I would hardly want
a scary ghost...

35
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,070
wearing a saree sitting
next to me.

36
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,108
I much prefer a Miss India.

37
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,312
<i>Sea?</i>

38
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,742
That's the problem.

39
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,544
He never discusses
anything real...

40
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,946
just hides behind cheap humor.

41
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,213
Sir. take this.

42
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,856
Love is not an easy thing.

43
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,393
This much I know.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,496
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

45
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,627
You could write poetry or crime
thrillers. Why horror stories?

46
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,906
When today's youth prefer
love stories.

47
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,238
So? Boy meets girl, they
live happily ever after. The End.

48
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,807
Everybody writes love stories.

49
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,141
Bankers, insurance agents.
housewives.

50
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,676
Horror is really interesting
as a genre.

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,546
The more you scare people.
the more they want to be scared.

52
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:12,822
All the best, sir.

53
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,250
"The Witch's Blouse."

54
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,422
I cannot tell you how many
copies it has sold!

55
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,561
It's broken the 10-year record
of the English-Hindi dictionary.

56
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,099
- Can I take a selfie?
- Sure.

57
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,510
Three years have gone by...

58
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,342
when is your next book?

59
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,616
Love is not an easy thing.

60
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,853
This much I know.

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,659
You are a river of fire.
I do not know how to swim.

62
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,602
Of course. It's the paper's
fault, Abhi.

63
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,602
How much longer?

64
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,140
We need a <i>book</i> You need a <i>book.</i>

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,811
Your goldfish needs a book.

66
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,945
Stop eating ketchup
and bread all day!

67
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,841
You smoke non-stop.
You don't answer any calls.

68
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,780
I'm fed up of calling.
God answers but not you.

69
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,987
Quiet!

70
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,292
The publisher paid you
two years ago.

71
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,395
- He's chasing me.
- I don't care.

72
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,729
His kid used to dirty my lap with
his goo. Now he googles all day.

73
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,963
Tell you what...

74
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,633
- Give me a date.
- Give me space.

75
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,076
It's a love story.

76
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,641
I knew you'd make me proud.

77
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,551
Don't do that!

78
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,554
A normal love story. right?
Girl-meets-boy?

79
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,822
Girl-girl?

80
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,023
Boy-meets-boy?

81
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,395
- Girl-meets-horse?
- Are you mad?

82
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,431
People write strange stuff.
Take Black Beauty.

83
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,801
You're the limit.

84
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,540
You won't get any ideas...

85
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,112
locked indoors. At least
open the window!

86
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,908
Let the air in. Ideas will
float into the room.

87
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,485
- Don't you have a copy?
- No!

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,821
Why don't you use a laptop
like normal writers?

89
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,325
Everything is online.
Even railway bookings.

90
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,631
I'll kill you.

91
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,533
Ma, I'm busy, Call you back.

92
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,243
You're always busy, Bubla.
That's why this has happened.

93
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,844
What's happened?

94
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,309
Better you hear it from me
than someone else.

95
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,119
Your father and I are getting
divorced.

96
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,581
- You're cracking up.
- I'm cracked?

97
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,585
Your voice is cracking up.
I'll call you back.

98
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,618
Your baba and I...

99
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,691
<i>Baba is on hold.</i>

100
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,190
Baba, What's up?

101
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,259
- Cutting me out of your will?
- We're getting divorced.

102
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,595
Bubla?

103
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,914
Have you heard?
Bubla is coming to Kolkata.

104
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,244
Really?

105
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,013
He's coming?

106
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,487
When do We see him?

107
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,917
My son is coming home.
The best pieces, please.

108
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,462
Hope he'll stay long?

109
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,757
Bubla's coming? Wow!

110
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,462
Lemon tea for everyone!

111
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,101
Nephew landing.

112
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,683
How are you?

113
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,162
<i>Who is he?</i>

114
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,538
Come inside. I'll tell you.

115
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,270
Is he here?

116
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,845
Mind your backs!

117
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,076
Surprise!

118
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,223
Ma...

119
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,758
Nephew, listen to me.

120
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,566
- You write so well.
- Come here.

121
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,373
- We're first in line.
- Let me go.

122
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,636
Give me a good hug.

123
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,408
What happened to that girl?

124
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,542
Left him, right?

125
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,610
You're so thin. Eat!

126
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,874
Nephew, hear me out.

127
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,153
You've written a terrific book.

128
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,978
Keep on scaring us.

129
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,952
How about some whiskey? Neat?

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,722
That's Vodka.

131
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,661
<i>Same difference.
Do you remember me?</i>

132
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,461
- Bhooby aunty.
- Bhooby aunty?

133
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,326
Bhooby aunty from Salt Lake.

134
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,799
Bhooby aunty. How could I forget?

135
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,039
Naughty!

136
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,374
Why are you so stressed?

137
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,946
What is all this?

138
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,075
It was her idea.

139
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,011
It was my idea?

140
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,953
You always say I never
give you any credit.

141
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,747
- Meaning?
- The divorce yarn.

142
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,459
How could you imagine I'd ask
your mother for anything...

143
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,389
Let alone a divorce.

144
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,895
If l committed suicide at my age,
what would people say?

145
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,261
Baba, you...

146
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,894
You haven't come home for ages.

147
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,734
Unbelievable, Ma. I have to finish
my book and...

148
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,807
You make me come all the way
to drink Vodka with Aunt Bhooby.

149
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,840
We were missing you.

150
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,507
No more surprises, I hope?

151
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,180
Next Wednesday...
it's your father's birthday.

152
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,479
Now that you're here...

153
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,752
I thought we'd have a small party
for selected guests.

154
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,494
Only close family and friends.
Speak up!

155
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,462
That's good. Quiet now!

156
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,996
- Couldn't you tell me on the phone?
- Would you have come?

157
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,629
Come. Come. The family photo.

158
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,467
You can't manage anything.
You prefer Vodka to your son.

159
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,177
- It helps me acting.
- Don't overdo it.

160
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,378
I can't overact as naturally as you.

161
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,420
What happens when he finds out
about your other plan?

162
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,121
Why shouldn't I?

163
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,818
He's just wasting his life...

164
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,159
because of that girl.

165
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,169
My boy, Devdas! How are you?
I missed that face.

166
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,170
Give me a hug!

167
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,545
Please have some.

168
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,621
Come with me.

169
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,354
Hurry up!

170
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,434
My daughter is an avid reader.

171
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,426
Rabindranath Tagore
is her favourite.

172
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,235
<i>Then Satyajit Ray.
Then "Edin" Blyton.</i>

173
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,937
You come a close fourth.

174
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,072
I love Das Cabin.

175
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,105
What a concept. Gripping!

176
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,616
Read us something.

177
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,878
Wow.

178
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,948
lf you're feeling shy.
give it to me, I'll read.

179
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,890
Give it to me.

180
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,521
I did a lot of theater in college.

181
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:45,664
"Maya's body was now Wrapped
around Ravi."

182
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,638
"Nice trousers," she says.

183
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,130
"She puts her hand into his pocket.

184
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,835
"He attacks her like a hungry
Bengali businessman...

185
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,438
"attacks a mate of hot samosas...

186
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,545
"after a hard day at work.

187
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,375
"As Maya starts moaning...

188
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,685
<i>- "Yes."
- No.</i>

189
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,515
That's enough.

190
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,215
Enough.

191
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,560
Sometimes, it's about
publisher demands...

192
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,501
All right. We better be going.

193
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,371
Let's go.

194
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,064
Das Cabin? Gripping!

195
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,071
Baba, no ghost came?

196
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,907
No, someone else did.

197
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,580
<i>Baba.</i>

198
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,077
She's sweet.

199
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,320
Ma, are you serious?

200
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,215
OK, You tell me what kind
of girl you want?

201
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,305
Her hair was like the inky night.

202
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,573
Her eyes were like traffic lights.
Red, Green, Red, Green.

203
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,401
Her fragrance ran through
my veins like molten lava...

204
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,452
Looking for something?

205
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,997
You, I didn't know
you were here.

206
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,194
- I am here.
- I can see that.

207
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,669
I heard you committed suicide.

208
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,070
So that wasn't you?

209
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,139
Obviously not.

210
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,614
She isn't here.

211
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,270
- Are you recording?
- Yes.

212
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,882
These are Bindu and Abhi's
top ten favourite songs.

213
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,416
Not favourite songs. But songs
that are part of our lives.

214
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,418
So this is the soundtrack to
the lives of Abhi and Bindu.

215
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:32,291
Don't go away, don't leave me now...

216
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:41,135
my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

217
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,669
Some songs become part
of your life.

218
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,043
Wrapped in their tunes are stories,
big and small.

219
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,081
Many memories.

220
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,920
Bindu and I had filled a cassette
with our memories.

221
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,391
Our mixed tape.

222
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,866
Our 4x2.5" dirty secret.

223
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,996
A tape filled with Lata, Kishore,
Asha, Rafi, RD, Bappi-da.

224
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,937
And Bindu,

225
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,472
Don't go away, don't leave me now...

226
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,779
my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

227
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,617
"My Sweet Bindu."

228
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,467
In one Word - she was "trouble."

229
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,902
She was unusual, a little crazy.

230
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,269
Forever changing her mind.

231
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,139
She was madly in love with life...

232
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,868
but she loved herself
a little more.

233
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,735
At age 6...

234
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,642
she played a bee in a school play.

235
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,676
She adored her costume so much.
she kept it on for a week.

236
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,614
A Week later...

237
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,914
she threw it out like
an old toy.

238
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,018
Never wore it again.

239
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,523
What will you be
when you grow up?

240
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,432
Her answer changed every day.

241
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,937
A Prime Minister.
a washer-woman, a nurse.

242
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,072
Then one day she saw the film
"Guide" on TV.

243
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,810
She thought Waheeda
was singing herself...

244
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,344
so every singer was
as beautiful as Waheeda.

245
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,149
Was it Waheeda's magic
or Lata Mangeshkar's...

246
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,750
she had to be a singer.

247
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,958
I'll have an army of fans.
Wait and see!

248
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,587
She adored her mother.

249
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,229
She taught her that
life was like melting ice-cream.

250
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,035
Gobble it up or it'll get wasted.

251
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,438
She was scared of her father.

252
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,072
Her father, the Major, stumbled home
drunk every night.

253
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,478
If he was in a bad mood,
he'd look Bindu in the bathroom.

254
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,041
But who could tie her down?

255
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,317
She had wheels under her feet.

256
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,747
She never settled for a place
or a thing...

257
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,615
one object or even one person.

258
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,785
She left everything half-way.
A film, A book, A hobby.

259
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,724
Before she turned 25...

260
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,230
she broke two engagements.

261
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,694
- Let me kiss you.
- Please go for it.

262
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,071
Be serious!

263
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,399
God had given me so many signs.

264
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,267
But I was too obsessed by Bindu
to ever notice.

265
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,248
Bindu was like that melody...

266
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,315
that you hear once...

267
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,487
and can't get out of your head.

268
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,888
1983.

269
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,626
That year Kapil Dev won
the World Cup at Lords.

270
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,598
Kishore-da sang "Taaki o taaki."

271
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,296
And We learned about thunderstorms
In our geography class.

272
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,633
My little thunderstorm came quietly...

273
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,111
on a boring Tuesday in an old
green Ambassador car.

274
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,387
To welcome our new neighbours,
Ma made mince-meat samosas.

275
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,890
Like all great Indian love stories,
mine too started...

276
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,427
with samosas and green chutney.

277
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,512
There she was' sitting on
those trunks in the attic.

278
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,480
Fiercely guarding the secrets
they contained.

279
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:36,161
She had her headphones on,
looking at me with suspicion.

280
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,994
That look!

281
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,537
Oh God, that look.

282
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,870
Finally she said...

283
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,312
Listen to this, This will change
your life.

284
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,108
This will change my life?
What did she mean?

285
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,350
The song? The headphones?
Or she herself?

286
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,921
Even today I feel she had eyes
only for the green chutney.

287
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,097
We won't be able to Watch
the show?

288
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,494
This TV has become a pain.

289
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,865
Cricket and film songs always
brought India closer together.

290
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,942
Every Wednesday evening, I had
to battle with the antenna.

291
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,578
- Is it on?
- Yes, Don't move.

292
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,715
Before the 4.10 secs of
"Aaiye Meherbaan" were over...

293
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,946
Madhubala had Ashok Kumar
swooning over her.

294
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,885
And I had found my best friend.

295
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,445
Come to me, my kind friend.

296
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,846
Take a seat, sweetheart.

297
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,386
I invite you...

298
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,617
to take the test of love.

299
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,869
Let the song finish.

300
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,190
It's my name, Bindu.

301
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,264
What kind of name is that?

302
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,398
Bindu Shankarnaraynan, Is that
a name for a rock star?

303
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,404
- Wow! Are you really stripping?
- Eyes on the road.

304
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,638
Do you know why my father
named me "Bindu”.

305
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,637
- You think I care?
- Go on, guess.

306
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,878
After his favourite actress,
Saira Banu.

307
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,738
"My sweet Bindu."

308
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,706
Who names their only daughter...

309
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,944
after a comic character
in a 70s film?

310
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,482
Why don't he name me "Saira?”

311
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:14,947
Such an attractive name.

312
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,194
- My pet name is Bubla.
- Eyes on the road, Bubla.

313
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,430
It sounds like a Bengali version
of "Bubble Wrap."

314
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,759
- I don't even have my own song.
- Bubla really stinks.

315
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,766
But your parents called you
Abhimanyu too.

316
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,906
I'm stuck with this one name.

317
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,933
All my life I will stay a Bindu.

318
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,734
Uncool, unmarried. For life.

319
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,207
<i>Don't worry.
I will marry you.</i>

320
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,709
But you need to improve
your figure first.

321
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,946
You unfit Bengali!

322
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,585
With a name like Bubla.
dreaming about hot girls?

323
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,852
<i>Sorry.</i>

324
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,422
Ok. Bubla is a great name.
I'll marry you.

325
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,594
Are you sure?

326
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,959
But l can't walk. I'm wearing heels.

327
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,566
It's 11.30pm. I promised to give
Rahul my car.

328
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,896
So how are we going
to the party?

329
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,607
It's an emergency.

330
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,878
'That' kind of emergency?

331
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,375
Where is he?

332
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,382
- What are you doing?
- Look away.

333
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:24,691
What's up, bro?

334
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,589
Hi, Rahul.

335
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,427
<i>How are you? Good?
Very good.</i>

336
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,524
Thanks.

337
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,472
- Have fun.
- Bye.

338
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,706
I need a cab.

339
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,847
- Let's go.
- Where?

340
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,782
Hurry up... follow that car.

341
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,164
I left my keys behind.

342
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,457
You want them now?

343
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,130
It'll take a second.

344
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,796
Where are they? Where?

345
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,336
Oh! Hi, Pinky.

346
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,905
Glowing!

347
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,303
No keys here.

348
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,044
Found them, Thank God.

349
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,117
Follow me.

350
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,686
I can't believe you seriously
did that.

351
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,857
Rahul's face turned bright red.

352
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,629
And what about Miss Pinky Rastogi?

353
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,461
- Now they'll know.
- We'll find a taxi further on.

354
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,032
Bubla...

355
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,699
Don't sulk. Bubble Wrap.

356
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,343
<i>Come.</i>

357
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,512
- why are you so heavy?
- Know what l like about you?

358
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,486
What?

359
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,323
I am thinking.

360
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,658
I like the way you scrunch up
your nose when you're angry.

361
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,129
I also like those old-fashioned
sweaters you wear in the summer.

362
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,960
- I'll drop you here.
- But, but... I love.

363
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,201
That you're a real gentleman.

364
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,477
You'd never drop a helpless girl
on a cold road.

365
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,408
Never!

366
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,739
You!

367
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,203
The girl from Kolkata.

368
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,974
A Bengali qawali.

369
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,205
Let me sing!

370
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,018
Let it go to hell...

371
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,649
the material world.

372
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,783
Let me drop by your home
some day.

373
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,455
Leave your window open...

374
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,830
and let me fly away.

375
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,067
Let me play...

376
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,527
let joy overcome me.

377
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,932
O lovely girl,
let me get close to you.

378
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,535
Your youth...

379
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,767
my youth...

380
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,049
won't let go of me.

381
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,991
I roam streets and lanes...

382
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,196
come to me, sweetheart.

383
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,092
Fly to me in these pebbled lanes.

384
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,995
Come to me. Let the rumors
spread.

385
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,999
Everyone at home will have
a problem with us.

386
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,607
Let me...

387
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,607
Let you, get ourselves
a bad name.

388
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,616
What is youth Worth?

389
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,650
If it isn't full of wicked fun.

390
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,385
We are buddies who meet
at midnight.

391
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,585
Your youth...

392
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,986
my youth...

393
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,201
won't let go of me.

394
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,738
Page seven.

395
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,938
Don't.

396
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,483
Who Wants page seven?

397
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,824
zzzzzzzzzzzz20 bucks?

398
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,395
Page 3.

399
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,144
Please.

400
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,484
Must we attach the question paper
with the answer sheet?

401
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,947
I'm done.

402
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,025
Me and my crazy neighbour.

403
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,623
Our homes were next to each other,
So were our lives...

404
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,535
like Gabbar and Sambha, Munna
and Circuit, Guruji and Bhola.

405
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,568
Here. No more renting your car.
No more emergencies.

406
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,769
- Come on.
- You're nuts.

407
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,877
She always managed to make
me do wild and crazy things.

408
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,829
This 'two-phone rings' girl will
trap him one day.

409
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,491
As long as it's a girl.

410
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,933
I have to get some notes
from Prakash.

411
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,137
Where to?

412
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,999
I'll be back.

413
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,939
Bubla!

414
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,008
Just look at him!

415
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,022
Two rings means an emergency.
You know, right?

416
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,621
Everybody in North Kolkata knows.

417
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,590
OK.

418
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,523
Listen...

419
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,358
Bindu, whatever it is,
It's a no.

420
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,595
You know I don't like dogs.

421
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,240
<i>Someone ran over his mother.</i>

422
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,773
This little guy was crying
on the road.

423
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,806
Pa won't let me keep him.

424
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,614
How can We abandon
him on the streets?

425
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,421
- Know what we must call him?
- Someone else's problem?

426
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,250
We'll call him Devdas.

427
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,124
Can We keep Devdas?

428
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,192
What do I tell Ma?

429
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,956
Instead of notes.
I came back with a dog?

430
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,258
Not a dog, It's Devdas.

431
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,900
No chance. End of discussion.

432
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,540
Then came the big day in the
college calendar.

433
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,471
The Xavier's Annual football match.
Science vs. Commerce.

434
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,483
I'll deal with you later.

435
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,751
These games added new words
to my vocabulary.

436
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,356
Crushes, Rebounds.
Boyfriend, girlfriend...

437
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,259
good friend, just friend.
It's complicated. Etc, etc.

438
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,472
And I discovered why goalkeepers
hate center-forwards.

439
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,652
We lost the match badly.

440
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,250
But it felt as though I had
lost something more.

441
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,194
Very helpless, very helpless.

442
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,135
Final score. Life: 2.
Abhimanyu Roy: 0.

443
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,805
Run' run'

444
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,270
Who asked you to End the car?

445
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,673
Damn! He banged the car.

446
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,849
Who is the idiot driving my car?

447
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,215
Dhruv!

448
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,617
Released the handbrake
by mistake.

449
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,280
Centre-forward.

450
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,924
He's already scored.

451
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,220
It's Bindu.

452
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,395
Cool it, you'll get your money.

453
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,095
You better.

454
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,067
My sweet Bindu.

455
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,167
My innocent Bindu.

456
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,908
Why make out oh the front seat?
The back seat...

457
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,779
<i>has more room.</i>

458
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,613
It's tried and tested.

459
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,780
I could've given you
a crash course.

460
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,215
Your hero is going to pay
for the car.

461
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,835
Abhi?

462
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,187
One word, Hindi.

463
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,052
One Word!

464
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,034
Terrific.

465
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,165
Titanic?

466
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,341
Saajan Chale Sasural.

467
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,243
- Swabhimaan.
- It's Na...

468
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,877
Keep quiet.

469
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,039
Yes Boss.

470
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,249
Rangeela.

471
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,214
QSQT.

472
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,481
O Darling. this is India.

473
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,024
Jo Jeeta Wohi Slkander.

474
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,354
Apu Trilogy.

475
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,465
- I'll hit you.
- She was doing well.

476
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,099
You.

477
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,429
One word? Hindi title.

478
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,166
Nagin.

479
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,039
<i>So?</i>

480
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,409
Candles... Candles... Candles...

481
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,480
One second. I'm looking for one.

482
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,480
Stop it, guys.

483
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,356
My melody has blended
with your night.

484
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,698
I have a friend who rents his car
for such emergencies.

485
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:47,934
You want it?

486
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,669
What just happened...

487
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,770
Like the Christmas lights
on Park Street...

488
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:01,175
some strange new feelings
were stirring inside us.

489
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,718
We were still neighbours...

490
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,551
but our paths were separating.

491
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,397
You guys are a mad lot.

492
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,931
I am trying to write.

493
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,999
You shoot like a sissy!

494
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,148
The referee can't hear you.
Shout louder.

495
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,388
Don't get angry, Bubla.

496
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,356
I am not angry.

497
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,788
They love you so much.

498
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,862
Love is over rated.
I need peace.

499
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,567
Going back to Mumbai?

500
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,230
It's your baba's birthday
in three days.

501
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,971
I'm not going anywhere. I'll come
back, Staying in a hotel.

502
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,506
I'll be back, I need time away from
this madhouse. I'm going nuts.

503
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,211
You'll stay in a hotel?

504
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:08,142
What will people think? You're
in Kolkata, but not staying at home.

505
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,608
Do what is right.
The book is more important.

506
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,817
- What will you eat?
- It's a hotel. Ma. They'll have food.

507
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,886
Why don't you ever say something?

508
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,456
What can I say? He's grown up
now. He'll do as he pleases.

509
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,582
Two eyes...

510
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,864
and one story.

511
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,636
This... was my mother's
favourite song.

512
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,107
She used to sing it at night
to put me to sleep.

513
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,277
I never did anything
for my mother.

514
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,950
I thought...

515
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,452
I Would someday...

516
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,055
I'd have enough time.

517
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,225
Enough chances.

518
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,329
I never thought I'd run out of time.

519
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,101
Two eyes...

520
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,378
and one story.

521
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:05,087
A few scattered clouds,
a few drops of rain.

522
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,928
One story.

523
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:29,011
After that night, the light never
came on in the attic.

524
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,855
Her father wasn't charged
for drunk driving.

525
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,918
But Bindu never forgave him.

526
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,822
His face kept reminding her
of the accident.

527
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,059
She ran away from home.

528
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,699
To Australia.

529
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,369
To her aunt.

530
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,510
Like most things in her life...

531
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,139
she left her studies half-way.

532
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,616
Bubla.

533
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,199
My sweet Bindu.

534
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,934
Your father gave me
your address.

535
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,072
Hope this letter reaches you
on time.

536
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,867
Your father is a changed man.

537
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,699
He has stopped drinking.

538
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,581
I don't get the time to go to Kolkata.
but Ma fills me in by phone.

539
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,908
I am in Bangalore, studying
management at IMS.

540
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,379
It's very different out here.

541
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,317
No one shares headphones. They
discuss grades and starting salaries.

542
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,352
I miss you, Send me your number.

543
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,458
I am pretty broke. But I can manage
a long distance call.

544
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:49,797
Abhimanyu!

545
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,133
Hello, stranger, Yes.

546
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:56,302
This is me. Life is crazy.
Australia is crazy.

547
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,136
Sending you a postcard, so I don't
have to write a lot.

548
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,940
<i>Who told you to do an MBA?</i>

549
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,538
You write well, You should've
become a writer.

550
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,277
You'd be happier and nap
in the afternoons.

551
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,340
Love and kisses to Devdas.
I miss you too.

552
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,356
In Australia, they call me
Bindaloo!

553
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,490
My name continues to ruin my life.
How are the chicks?

554
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,420
Chicks? You mean girls?

555
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,495
There are two girls in our batch.
They have moustaches.

556
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,027
There's a senior called Manjari.

557
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,860
She wears baggy trousers
and keeps saying s...!

558
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,833
Everyone at IMS is crazy about her.

559
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,269
Before I get interested in boys,
please come back.

560
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,772
My email id: muqqaddarkasikandar1977@hotmail.com.

561
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,203
Love Abhi.

562
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,514
PS. What happened to
front seat Dhruv?

563
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:43,812
Dhruv? Who?

564
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,486
You know the thing about boys, some
have great eyes, or great noses...

565
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,925
some have great lips.

566
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,891
A Shah Rukh Khan dialogue.
But the thought is mine.

567
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,251
<i>Hi, Abhi!</i>

568
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,096
In Cal for a week.

569
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,562
My heartless father has found
a suitable boy for me.

570
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,196
What do you say? Should I get
married?

571
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,134
You're getting married?
When? Where?

572
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,339
Congratulations my love!

573
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:12,010
Would have loved to come.
But it's placement week.

574
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,076
Devdas must be singing a sad
song for you.

575
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,818
He's heartbroken.

576
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,417
<i>It's Holi!</i>

577
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,649
My sweet Bindu...

578
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,948
Ma said you ran away
from your engagement.

579
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,289
Slow clap.

580
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,756
Ma also said how much money
your father lost.

581
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,260
Taking music seriously?
Amazing news.

582
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,796
I'm moving to Mumbai, Analytic
Division at a bank.

583
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,193
Write more often.

584
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,974
Hello, hi. Bonjour! I am in Paris
with my hopeless band.

585
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,167
I don't get a word of what
the boys say here.

586
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,412
Maybe that's Why I find them
so hot.

587
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,308
My sweet Bindu, I hope all is well.
Happy Diwali.

588
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,775
Happy birthday, Abhi.
Love, B.

589
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,720
My sweet Bindu.
I hope all is good with you.

590
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,285
<i>I've started working. My job
has taken Ma's place.</i>

591
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,251
Never leaves me alone for a minute.

592
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,687
I have to Work real hard.
And zero money.

593
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,088
I'll write on Saturday.

594
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,563
That Saturday I did not write to her.

595
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,931
Nor on the following Saturday.

596
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,765
Days and years disappeared
in a blink of an eye.

597
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:17,143
I was lost in the embrace
of Mumbai, this crazy city.

598
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,070
Can you fix this, Alok-da?

599
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,533
Oh goodness me! It's Abhimanyu.

600
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,071
You vanished after college.

601
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,806
Days of the cassette are over.

602
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,351
They're dinosaurs now.

603
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,454
What about some popular MP3's?

604
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,350
Nothing can match the songs
on this cassette.

605
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,020
Full emotion?

606
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,004
What a song!

607
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,732
RD Burman and Gulzar.

608
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,306
OP Nayyar and Asha.

609
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,878
Kishore Kumar and Rajesh Khanna.

610
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,309
There are some combinations...

611
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,314
that work so well together.

612
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,950
Wonderful on their own,
but miraculous together.

613
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,224
Pure magic!

614
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,093
Keep this carefully.

615
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,829
Combinations like these are rare.

616
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,742
Goa, Candolim, Four years later.

617
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,705
As usual, without warning...

618
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,751
accompanied by
a Burman Saab tune....

619
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,620
she exploded into my life
once again.

620
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,725
I bet 500 rupees, you're breaking up
with Maulshree.

621
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,286
Shut up!

622
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,519
Where are Vinay and Maulshree?

623
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,857
Maybe at the Chemist's.

624
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,192
Chemist? You are getting
lucky tonight, man.

625
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,133
But after that, you're going
to break up. I'm just saying.

626
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,309
Hold this.

627
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,950
Bindu! Stop the bus!

628
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,054
Stop the bus.

629
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,072
Drive fast.

630
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,473
Bindu!

631
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,610
O princess of my dreams,
when will you come to me?

632
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,780
The season of love is here,
when will you come to me?

633
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,785
Our lives will pass us by,
when will you come to me?

634
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,052
You could've hopped onto that bus.

635
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,692
It was so crowded.
We couldn't talk.

636
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,698
I'm seeing you like what...
after four years?

637
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,932
Remember my 500 rupees.
And a full tank.

638
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,137
Mind your own business.
I'll fill your tank.

639
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,405
Where are you nowadays?

640
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,003
Near you.

641
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,973
Mumbai!

642
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,676
- What are you saying?
- Yeah, it's been two months.

643
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,984
I'm still trying my luck
at singing.

644
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:47,550
And you must be researching
something boring at your bank.

645
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,257
Research is a useful thing,
sweetheart.

646
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,187
Research says 82% of people who
randomly meet in Goa fall in love.

647
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,129
Is that so?

648
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,228
Listen...

649
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:02,164
I know that your dream was to
have a beach wedding in Goa.

650
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,165
Let's stop right here
and get married.

651
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,874
Terrific idea but I am engaged.

652
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,704
Still don't lose hope.

653
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,540
I've run away from two engagements
before, One veg, one non veg.

654
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,350
You must be considered a goddess
by the catering industry.

655
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,782
Not running this time?

656
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,190
My family and friends
have placed bets.

657
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,090
But not this time.

658
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,717
I really like him.

659
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,963
- What caste is he?
- How does it matter, uncle?

660
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,756
Caste, race, colour, religion.
Mind your own business.

661
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,526
He's a South Indian Christian.
Anil Matthew.

662
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,401
- Star sign?
- Cancerian.

663
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,402
- I am Cancer too.
- You're blood cancer.

664
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,477
You've lost out, my boy.

665
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,848
- Thank you for the bike ride, uncle.
- You can ride it now.

666
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,422
It was crazy meeting you like this.

667
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,591
I know.

668
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:02,295
Look after yourself, And come
to my wedding if you can.

669
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,164
You too, uncle.

670
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,227
I'll be in Mumbai. Take
my number. Call me.

671
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,832
Give me a pen.

672
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,404
Girls like Bindu Shankarnaraynan
are trouble.

673
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,937
You never know when they will
go to your head like a Tequila shot.

674
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,515
We gotta go Bye, uncle.

675
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,513
Friends warned me...

676
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,318
Ioving a girl like her
is free falling.

677
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,624
No one knows
Where you will land...

678
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,794
and in how many pieces.

679
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,531
- Here's your pen.
- At least hand onto that.

680
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,509
God bless you!

681
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,547
But no one had Warned me...

682
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,914
despite all the suffering
in love...

683
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,886
you're ready to do it again.

684
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,957
To give love another shot.

685
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,368
Many teach you how to love...

686
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:22,804
alas, no one teaches you
how to forget that love.

687
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:56,838
2005.

688
00:53:57,897 --> 00:54:00,343
That year the floods nearly
drowned Mumbai.

689
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:05,146
Gulzar Saab Wrote a song about
Aishwarya's dark eyes.

690
00:54:05,738 --> 00:54:08,742
and Bindu and I landed up
In the same city.

691
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:14,055
Call it life or Newton's Law of
Gravity....

692
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:17,191
Things were on a collision course.

693
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:19,155
I'm starving!

694
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:26,765
Hello.

695
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,438
Abhi! Where were you?
Have been trying to reach you.

696
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:33,570
It's an emergency.
Can you come to the bar?

697
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:36,505
- Now?
- Yes! Now!

698
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:39,346
Hurry! Don't waste time.

699
00:54:49,382 --> 00:54:50,452
Abhi!

700
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:02,431
Are we checking out
your competition?

701
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:06,201
Disco 82.

702
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:08,912
My tummy's growling.

703
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:11,344
That wicked scoundrel.

704
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,114
It wasn't me.

705
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,150
Two kebabs and two beers.

706
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:18,645
Give me that.

707
00:55:20,546 --> 00:55:22,492
- He's run off, That rascal.
- who?

708
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:25,287
That South Indian guy?
Mr Matthew?

709
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,189
This time he dumped you.

710
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,235
<i>Sorry.</i>

711
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,500
He called Pa. And sent me
a stupid SMS.

712
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:39,305
I really liked this one. The idiot
dumped me.

713
00:55:39,899 --> 00:55:42,743
Why do these guys agree
to marry you?

714
00:55:42,969 --> 00:55:45,745
They should know your track record
You're the runner.

715
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,679
<i>- But aren't i hot?
- Sure.</i>

716
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,115
- I sing well?
- True.

717
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,311
What else do you want?

718
00:55:51,577 --> 00:55:53,454
Sure. I'm a little insensitive.

719
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:55,420
A little impatient, insecure.

720
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,992
Sometimes I'm out of control.
only sometimes.

721
00:55:58,217 --> 00:55:59,821
But everyone makes mistakes.

722
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:01,924
Correct. Nobody's perfect.

723
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:03,724
You eat first.

724
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:12,842
Girlfriend?

725
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:14,505
You want to go, go.

726
00:56:15,735 --> 00:56:19,808
Everyone marries. So why not
I play housewife too?

727
00:56:20,406 --> 00:56:22,716
But when the day comes near...

728
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:26,147
I start feeling claustrophobic...

729
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,395
This one was a terrific guy.

730
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:35,898
S...! Why did he run?
The damn Cancerian.

731
00:56:54,073 --> 00:56:57,384
We watched Big Boss together.
Then she fell asleep.

732
00:56:57,744 --> 00:56:59,485
She didn't even eat.

733
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,487
- Something came up.
- Of course!

734
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:04,091
My sweet... Your sweet Bindu.

735
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,895
This won't end well. You won't
have either her or Bindu.

736
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,931
The last time you spoke to a girl
Indira Gandhi was PM.

737
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:17,968
- What do you know about girls?
- Of course.

738
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:21,038
I'll make it upto her. Long drive,
foot massage.

739
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:23,811
- Big Boss, episode no. 27.
- What?

740
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:27,641
Tomorrow night I'll be watching
Ep. 27 with her.

741
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,075
Want a bet?

742
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:32,355
- Get the cash from an ATM.
- It's on!

743
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:34,588
Take her away, Where will I sleep?

744
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:39,953
He doesn't love you.

745
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:44,701
My? I'll get married.
Any problem?

746
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:49,201
Of course renting to a single girl
in Mumbai is an offense.

747
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:50,597
Didn't you know that?

748
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,810
What kind of estate agent
are you, Sameer bhai?

749
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,338
Forget the flat. Find me a husband.

750
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:57,078
Ok, Bye.

751
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,906
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

752
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,143
- You lost the Juhu flat too?
- That's right.

753
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:06,387
It's not the end of the world...

754
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:09,126
<i>stay with your Mr.Mattew
for a few days more.</i>

755
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:11,189
I don't know how to swim.

756
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:12,952
I'll fall.

757
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:14,990
Phone... Boss is calling.

758
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:18,033
Hello, sir. Of course, sir.

759
00:58:18,758 --> 00:58:20,897
My aunt is feeling much better, sir.

760
00:58:21,694 --> 00:58:23,571
She's even smiling a bit.

761
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:26,240
I'll see you at the office.
By three?

762
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,747
Four, sir. Sure, sir.
Ok, sir.

763
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:34,181
What a crazy city!

764
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,577
I should go back to Kolkata.

765
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,686
If I didn't want to be a singer
I would be gone by now.

766
00:58:41,314 --> 00:58:43,692
So when will you be the next
Indian idol?

767
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:45,553
To hell With that!

768
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:49,265
Film composers tell me my voice
needs "special training."

769
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:50,633
<i>"Come home some time."</i>

770
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:57,401
If your time-pass girlfriend wasn't
staying with you, I would.

771
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,237
Earlier we were neighbours, now
you'll sneak into my home?

772
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:05,311
When postal codes change, then
friends become like family.

773
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:07,877
- Thought of the day! Thank you.
- Wow.

774
00:59:09,942 --> 00:59:11,285
Why not try "dubbing"?

775
00:59:11,811 --> 00:59:14,758
Till you make it as a singer,
try dubbing.

776
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:16,649
Never know.

777
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:18,756
Good option, no?

778
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:21,898
Hi, Sameer bhai?

779
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:26,269
I have seen the face
of the moon.

780
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:29,900
I have seen a sky full of stars.

781
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,441
But I have seen
no one quite like you.

782
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:38,343
Husband? Or a flat?

783
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:41,307
In your lovely eyes...

784
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:45,154
that's where I want to drown.

785
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:51,892
No one can stop me
from falling in love.

786
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:55,358
My heart is to me.

787
00:59:58,658 --> 00:59:59,636
You lost!

788
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:06,842
You have Won my heart.

789
01:00:17,343 --> 01:00:19,482
A recipe for aubergine "bharta."

790
01:00:20,413 --> 01:00:22,484
Read it in your own style.

791
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,792
First take the aubergine...

792
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:31,632
and roast it.

793
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:35,937
Then for five minutes...

794
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:38,071
stir it.

795
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:43,005
Then play With it for a bit.

796
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:45,780
And then...

797
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:47,841
roast it again.

798
01:00:48,574 --> 01:00:51,555
Opened-eyes <i>I</i> saw you...

799
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:54,152
you're a beautiful dream.

800
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:56,120
Ram Sawant is out of the house!

801
01:00:56,415 --> 01:00:59,453
You are the sweetness....

802
01:01:00,086 --> 01:01:02,225
filling my heart.

803
01:01:18,504 --> 01:01:21,314
Your lovely name...

804
01:01:22,408 --> 01:01:25,617
So I found a way to bribe life...

805
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:29,525
and stumbled from friendship
into love.

806
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:33,088
But first it was time for
the elimination round.

807
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:37,133
It's the finale.

808
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:51,912
I'm leaving you.

809
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:54,847
Why?

810
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,322
Please. Let her go.
It's the finale.

811
01:02:03,816 --> 01:02:05,022
I really am leaving.

812
01:02:06,118 --> 01:02:06,926
Listen...

813
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,960
please, Let her go.

814
01:02:15,995 --> 01:02:16,939
Oh yes!

815
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:20,275
He won!

816
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:30,215
You were dumped too.

817
01:02:32,144 --> 01:02:34,624
How come, Bubla Roy?

818
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:40,158
Isn't it strange?

819
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:43,061
We Went our separate Ways...

820
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:46,068
lived in different cities,
had different careers.

821
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,763
Today we're together again.

822
01:02:49,428 --> 01:02:53,240
11.30pm. Sitting on Mumbai's
Marine Drive, we're chilling out.

823
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:57,107
The only thing missing is our dog.

824
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:01,712
You, me and our dog Devdas.

825
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,714
I like the sound of it.

826
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:09,458
So you'll exploit me
on the rebound?

827
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:12,057
Unbelievable.

828
01:03:14,386 --> 01:03:16,161
<i>Do you remember my house attic?</i>

829
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:17,895
<i>Of course I remember.</i>

830
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:21,633
Whenever <i>I</i> was very sad
or very happy.

831
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,836
I would go and hide there.

832
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:29,370
You'll always be my attic.

833
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:36,445
Please start paying the rent.

834
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:42,150
This song is dedicated to...

835
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:45,021
Abhimanyu Roy and Bindu
Shankarnarayanan.

836
01:03:45,317 --> 01:03:49,094
And to all those lonely boys
and girls in this mad city...

837
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:51,866
Whose hearts have been broken.

838
01:03:53,459 --> 01:03:56,235
<i>I can remember...</i>

839
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:03,514
your love.

840
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:21,524
Where am I? Where are you?
Where have you gone?

841
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:23,833
Come to me now.

842
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:41,346
"Is it the night, or your black
flowing hair...

843
01:04:41,907 --> 01:04:43,443
Beautiful!

844
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,818
Stop your midnight poetry!

845
01:04:46,045 --> 01:04:48,150
Nobody's talking to you.
You fool!

846
01:04:50,115 --> 01:04:51,992
"Or is it the moonlight...?"

847
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:55,097
Give Javed Akhtar a break!

848
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:57,467
You know my Hindi is shaky.

849
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,363
It's not Hindi anyway it's Urdu.

850
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:02,673
"Is this the moon...?"
Something, something.

851
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:04,564
What did Mr.Bachchan sing?

852
01:05:05,397 --> 01:05:10,142
"Where have We reached...

853
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:16,585
- walking side by side?"
- Shut up!

854
01:05:18,077 --> 01:05:20,455
I must tell her what I feel
about her.

855
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,681
She already knows.

856
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:25,991
Everybody knows, even people
who don't know you, know.

857
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,060
I must tell her.
I love her so much.

858
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:31,762
You just want to have fun.

859
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:33,800
Are you mad?

860
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:38,041
It's true love. I've loved her since
I was a kid. My first crush.

861
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:42,311
It's only attraction. That's ok.

862
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:45,473
How do you spell love?

863
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,348
Attraction.

864
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:50,677
You threw my shoe.

865
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:51,988
We'll get it later.

866
01:05:55,814 --> 01:05:57,259
Tomorrow morning...

867
01:05:57,616 --> 01:06:00,153
give her some flowers.
and propose to her.

868
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:04,499
From the time I couldn't spell
"love." let alone understand it...

869
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:10,303
I loved her. when that girl says
yes, I could feel my heart bursting.

870
01:06:11,397 --> 01:06:15,504
I rewound that moment and played
it again and again in my head.

871
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:19,708
Magical. Dim lighting.
Beautiful dresses.

872
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,947
With violins playing like they do
in romantic films.

873
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,750
But this was my love story.

874
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,818
Ok, tell me...

875
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:32,288
What's 3 Down...

876
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:40,193
Arabic preparation for grilled meat.
8 letters, one word.

877
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:43,103
8 letters? Shawarma.

878
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:45,534
"In the shower." in Gujarati.

879
01:06:46,565 --> 01:06:48,408
- Oh God!
- Last one.

880
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:50,244
5 Down, 7 Across.

881
01:06:50,536 --> 01:06:53,574
English phrase to explain an
irrational fondness for someone...

882
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,785
without any rhyme, reason
or context...

883
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:59,545
often used as a pretext
to make out.

884
01:07:00,446 --> 01:07:02,687
Three Words starts With 'I.'

885
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:05,351

894
01:07:28,574 --> 01:07:30,451

<i>Your Mom looks hot in red.</i>

908

Why are we talking about Mom?

909
01:08:15,354 --> 01:08:16,424
Bubla!

910
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,300

Give me two minutes.

915
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,469
Careful.

Dubbing.

929
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:23,331
Are you singing?

930
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:26,803
No. aunty. I'm doing voice-overs
in Tamil films.

931
01:09:30,429 --> 01:09:34,172
It's very comfortable.
Gives you maximum pleasure!

932
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,178
Go, go, go. Grab it now!

933

Do they pay you?

934
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:43,945
Not much. But you know
Pa is rich.

935
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:46,152
He sends me money every month.

936
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:48,558
Atonement. For killing my mother.

937
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:54,564
So. you've been in touch with Abhi
all these years?

938
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,696
- That's quite sweet, Bindu.
- That's very sweet.

939
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,536
The room is messy.

940
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:16,146
They work with me at the bank.
Credit card department.

941
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:25,527
Bro.

01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,465
I better go.

944
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,401
Bye, uncle.

945
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:41,510
Aunt.

Credit card Dept.

I'll be right back.

948

I love teasing your mother.

949
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:56,157
Forget Ma What about us?

950
01:10:56,782 --> 01:10:58,921
- What?
- Give me your answer.

951
01:10:59,284 --> 01:11:03,061
Or else millions of Bengali boys
like me won't forgive you.

952
01:11:03,355 --> 01:11:04,857
They'll curse you.

953
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:08,134
Just those three words
that I'm dying to hear.

954
01:11:08,794 --> 01:11:09,864
"Do, Fight, Win."

955
01:11:10,095 --> 01:11:11,438
- Shut up!
- 5 Down, 7 Across.

956
01:11:11,763 --> 01:11:12,764
I'll kill you.

957
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:26,854
Abhimanyu Bubla Roy.

958
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:29,581
I love you.

959
01:11:36,521 --> 01:11:39,195
- Say it without the "Bubla."
- Yeah, right.

960
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:05,587
Tiny little drops of love.

961
01:12:06,184 --> 01:12:08,255
Like a sweet drink.

962
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,697
Slowly love grows and grows.

963
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:16,528
A little naive.

964
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:19,302
A little naughty.

965
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:22,606
Softly a habit grows and grows.

966
01:12:23,168 --> 01:12:25,978
When We are face to face.

967
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:29,310
What can I do?

968
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:33,082
I just can't believe it.

969
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:37,393
From dawn to dusk...

970
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,130
<i>I</i> seek you.

971
01:12:40,886 --> 01:12:43,924
I cannot stop myself.

972
01:12:46,358 --> 01:12:50,738
This love is intoxicating.

973
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:55,070
Our love is intoxicating.

974
01:12:57,202 --> 01:13:01,651
This love is intoxicating.

975
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:06,084
Our love is intoxicating.

976
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,488
Now you see.,
what I do to you.

977
01:13:13,885 --> 01:13:15,159
- I've got an idea.
- No.

978
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:17,129
- Let's make a tape.
- No.

979
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:19,896
Listen! Let's make a mixed tape.

980
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,402
The best of our lives. Our story
told through film songs.

981
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,843
The soundtrack of our lives.

982
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:28,436
Like our favourite songs?

983
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:31,647
Not necessarily. But they must
be linked to our lives.

984
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,074
There are so many beautiful songs.

985
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:36,319
Sad songs, rubbish songs.
Our songs.

986
01:13:36,908 --> 01:13:38,546
- Like our dirty secret?
- Exactly.

987
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:41,848
- Just tape them back to back.
- Ten for me. ten for you.

988
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,718
Side B should have
5 mins blank at the end.

989
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:46,996
We keep a space for the last song.

990
01:13:47,252 --> 01:13:49,823
I love the idea! Let's do this.

991
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:51,866
I'll eat you up.

992
01:13:52,758 --> 01:13:54,396
I melt a little.

993
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,830
I slip a little.

994
01:13:58,029 --> 01:14:00,009
I stumble a little...

995
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:02,743
and fall into your arms.

996
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:05,173
I slide a little.

997
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:07,649
I slip a little.

998
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:12,477
Sometimes I change my mind
for no reason.

999
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:17,424
Distance between us from now.

1000
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:23,522
I feel spring become
one with my breath.

1001
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:28,062
We meet on every path.

1002
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:34,375
We exchange glances.

1003
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,210
This love is intoxicating.

1004
01:14:41,006 --> 01:14:44,317
Our love is intoxicating.

1005
01:14:48,346 --> 01:14:49,950
- Get out of here.
- Abhi!

1006
01:14:57,222 --> 01:15:02,001
This intoxication may give me
a hangover.

1007
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:05,998
Our love is intoxicating.

1008
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:46,315
You are a devil!

1009
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,984
You'll go to hell.

1010
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:27,553
So you like this fellow?

1011
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:36,195
Does he live With you?

1012
01:16:37,923 --> 01:16:39,231
He wishes.

1013
01:16:49,134 --> 01:16:51,273
What would you say
to Ma if she were alive?

1014
01:16:55,273 --> 01:16:56,251
<i>To your mother?</i>

1015
01:16:59,778 --> 01:17:01,451
"Sorry." I guess.

1016
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:08,456
I am sorry I couldn't
make her happy.

1017
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,932
I am sorry I was drunk that night.

1018
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:18,171
The car, I didn't even see it turn.

1019
01:17:20,365 --> 01:17:23,744
If there was one thing I could
change in life...

1020
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,341
it would be to make her happy.

1021
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:30,646
My child...

1022
01:17:36,881 --> 01:17:38,155
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1023
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,479
Hey Banker!

1024
01:18:05,944 --> 01:18:07,582
Why are you crying?

1025
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:15,160
The valiant hero finally persuaded
the heroine's cruel father.

1026
01:18:16,921 --> 01:18:21,370
And they all lived happily ever after.

1027
01:18:23,094 --> 01:18:28,237
But nobody said there's so much
more beyond 'happily ever after.'

1028
01:18:33,104 --> 01:18:37,416
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1029
01:18:38,376 --> 01:18:42,415
Come spread your wings.

1030
01:18:43,948 --> 01:18:47,623
Life is whispering in your ears.

1031
01:18:48,586 --> 01:18:52,693
Come spread your wings.

1032
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:56,034
Open your arms wide.

1033
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:58,331
With your arms wide open...

1034
01:18:58,963 --> 01:19:03,309
Slowly now. teach yourself
how to love.

1035
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:08,712
Breathe freely, breathe deeply.

1036
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:13,656
Slowly now, teach yourself
how to smile.

1037
01:19:14,345 --> 01:19:16,689
Sometimes float with the clouds...

1038
01:19:17,015 --> 01:19:19,188
in the open sky.

1039
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:23,793
What are you scared of?

1040
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:44,585
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1041
01:19:51,483 --> 01:19:54,589
Listen sometime,
your heart says things.

1042
01:20:00,725 --> 01:20:05,140
Can't you hear the sky
is calling you.

1043
01:20:05,864 --> 01:20:08,401
All the things you want to forget
that cause pain.

1044
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:11,136
Let them fly away too.

1045
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:20,279
Listen sometime.
your heart says things.

1046
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:25,586
Come spread your wings.

1047
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:29,458
Open your arms wide.

1048
01:20:30,188 --> 01:20:32,293
With your arms wide open...

1049
01:20:32,957 --> 01:20:37,872
Slowly now, teach yourself
how to love.

1050
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:05,329
Sorry, I got late. Come let's go.

1051
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,465
Om Shanti Om. Two tickets
10.30 show.

1052
01:21:07,759 --> 01:21:08,737
Not in the mood.

1053
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,097
Drink up. Your mood will change.
Come.

1054
01:21:11,429 --> 01:21:12,407
Here.

1055
01:21:14,132 --> 01:21:15,270
<i>Come on!</i>

1056
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:19,375
what's wrong?

1057
01:21:20,104 --> 01:21:21,606
Do I need your permission
to go to the loo?

1058
01:21:21,906 --> 01:21:22,941
What's come over you?

1059
01:21:23,474 --> 01:21:25,420
Can I go first?
It's an emergency.

1060
01:21:25,643 --> 01:21:27,281
This is an emergency too!

1061
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:32,025
Are you nuts?

1062
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:37,027
We can't keep Om and Shanti waiting.
We're getting late.

1063
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:39,399
Not everything is a joke, Abhi.

1064
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:42,296
Ok. Tell me what's happened?

1065
01:21:43,494 --> 01:21:44,632
Don't you know?

1066
01:21:45,763 --> 01:21:47,299
Oh God! Not again.

1067
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:50,575
Try and forget about
your album, please.

1068
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:53,880
Abhi, you don't get it.

1069
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,344
Just go. Abhi, stop it!

1070
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:58,245
There's more to life than music.

1071
01:22:01,913 --> 01:22:03,256
Listen to me.

1072
01:22:05,617 --> 01:22:06,618
Excuse me.

1073
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:08,925
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1074
01:22:09,454 --> 01:22:12,094
Bindu, I love you.
The rest doesn't matter.

1075
01:22:12,523 --> 01:22:13,866
I love you, to, Abhi.

1076
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:17,101
I see a whole lifetime
ahead of me.

1077
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:19,274
Nothing excites me.

1078
01:22:19,631 --> 01:22:22,942
I myself don't know what I want.
That's scary.

1079
01:22:26,304 --> 01:22:29,080
- What are you doing?
- Ok. Time out.

1080
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:31,709
Now tell me.

1081
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,056
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

1082
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:38,191
Fine. I'll go first.

1083
01:22:38,783 --> 01:22:40,126
Married. Devdas.

1084
01:22:40,551 --> 01:22:41,962
2 bed flat in Matunga.

1085
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:46,061
Two kids. We'll take them for
football practice every Saturday.

1086
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:47,529
Your turn.

1087
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:50,065
I saw myself somewhere, Abhi.

1088
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:52,165
On TV, on album covers.

1089
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:55,677
On a stage somewhere in Argentina,
or BKC or Mussoorie.

1090
01:22:56,034 --> 01:22:58,139
Singing in front of thousands.

1091
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:00,780
I don't know about the rest.

1092
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:05,214
Bindu, listen!

1093
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,617
Jeet, Vinay let it be.

1094
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:12,187
Baba, stop!

1095
01:23:13,084 --> 01:23:14,290
Forget it guys.

1096
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:17,022
This will change your life.

1097
01:23:34,005 --> 01:23:35,541
My sweet Bindu.

1098
01:23:36,607 --> 01:23:38,109
My innocent Bindu.

1099
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:40,786
My Bindu on my brow.

1100
01:23:41,245 --> 01:23:43,521
My love boat is in a whirlpool...

1101
01:23:43,915 --> 01:23:46,725
help it reach the shore.

1102
01:23:56,761 --> 01:23:58,604
Put your arms around my neck...

1103
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,776
like a garland of flowers.

1104
01:24:01,065 --> 01:24:02,669
Let's swing on a love swing.

1105
01:24:12,176 --> 01:24:14,417
Hurry and come to me...

1106
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:17,716
and brighten this dark life
of mine.

1107
01:24:18,349 --> 01:24:19,419
Brighten my life.

1108
01:24:27,525 --> 01:24:28,833
My Bindu.

1109
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:34,542
So sweet.

1110
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,423
Congrats Abhi.

1111
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,343
What a day! This is not
how it played out in my head.

1112
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:15,750
Never mind.

1113
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:18,519
All that choreography,
six months' planning.

1114
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,715
<i>Your Dad, my Mom.</i>

1115
01:25:21,379 --> 01:25:24,189
You should've seen the rehearsal
videos. They were hilarious.

1116
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:26,392
Look at their faces.

1117
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:28,860
Baba is sleeping with his mouth open.

1118
01:25:33,825 --> 01:25:34,826
Bindu.

1119
01:25:36,561 --> 01:25:37,733
Still mad, are you?

1120
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:40,307
No.

1121
01:25:41,265 --> 01:25:44,405
Your Mom made me wear it.
What does she have against me?

1122
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:48,646
It's 200 years old. It belonged
to my great-grandmother.

1123
01:25:49,073 --> 01:25:50,313
Since I was 12...

1124
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:53,382
Ma has been looking for
someone who'll wear it.

1125
01:25:58,749 --> 01:26:00,023
I don't know, Abhi.

1126
01:26:00,518 --> 01:26:05,160
For a while I thought I could go
along with your plans for us.

1127
01:26:07,425 --> 01:26:08,403
I'll sing...

1128
01:26:09,026 --> 01:26:12,599
you'll do your 9 to 5 job,
We'll be happy.

1129
01:26:13,664 --> 01:26:14,665
But..

1130
01:26:17,168 --> 01:26:18,112
But, What?

1131
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:21,715
But...

1132
01:26:23,107 --> 01:26:24,085
speak up.

1133
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:27,350
It doesn't make me happy.

1134
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:30,190
I don't know how to explain it.

1135
01:26:31,182 --> 01:26:33,423
No, my parents are here...

1136
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:35,096
your Dad is here.

1137
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:38,667
What was the point of all this?

1138
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,403
<i>I am sorry.</i>

1139
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:48,370
Sorry for What?

1140
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:50,612
You could've discussed it
with me.

1141
01:26:51,035 --> 01:26:54,016
How do you expect
an honest answer...

1142
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:56,013
when there is so much
expectation...

1143
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,777
Stop thinking about what I want.

1144
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,850
What your Dad wants.
What my parents want.

1145
01:27:02,513 --> 01:27:05,016
We never mattered before.
Why think of us now?

1146
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:06,826
The question is...
what do you want?

1147
01:27:07,051 --> 01:27:10,055
- It's not that simple.
- Goddammit. What do you want?

1148
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,875
I can't do this, Abhi.

1149
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:25,712
It's too much.

1150
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:28,083
I can't deal with this.

1151
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:32,584
How can I explain it?

1152
01:27:33,377 --> 01:27:36,017
This is too heavy. I feel suffocated.

1153
01:28:17,555 --> 01:28:19,626
Bindu left for Bangalore.

1154
01:28:20,925 --> 01:28:23,804
She needed some quiet
time to think.

1155
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,801
She called that night...

1156
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:30,571
I didn't pick up.

1157
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:35,146
For months she emailed.
messaged and called.

1158
01:28:36,874 --> 01:28:39,684
"I am sorry. Talk to me.

1159
01:28:40,177 --> 01:28:42,054
"Everything happened so fast.
The time was wrong.

1160
01:28:42,246 --> 01:28:44,522
"I am trying to find myself.
I am really sorry.

1161
01:28:45,349 --> 01:28:48,523
"Won't you forgive me, Bubble Wrap?"
Etc, etc.

1162
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:54,095
I remember every comma,
every full stop.

1163
01:28:54,992 --> 01:28:57,836
I felt every emotion hidden
behind her words.

1164
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,641
Call it anger, ego or something
else...

1165
01:29:04,035 --> 01:29:05,810
I didn't answer her.

1166
01:29:07,538 --> 01:29:10,280
Perhaps there was nothing
left to say.

1167
01:29:13,511 --> 01:29:16,549
She stopped writing after
203 emails.

1168
01:29:18,516 --> 01:29:20,120
Chapter closed.

1169
01:29:27,191 --> 01:29:29,831
Then one day I decided
to move on.

1170
01:29:30,761 --> 01:29:32,001
Quit my job...

1171
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:36,142
and landed up in the world
of Hindi pulp publishers.

1172
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:40,975
Mr Roy, you're trying too hard.

1173
01:29:41,572 --> 01:29:43,916
Don't copy Gulzar.
It's beyond you.

1174
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:47,417
Don't try to be deep.

1175
01:29:48,713 --> 01:29:49,851
What I liked...

1176
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:52,887
was the horror section
in the middle. Path breaking!

1177
01:29:53,184 --> 01:29:55,164
Bravo! You had me.

1178
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,996
"The Witch's Slipper." Bravo!

1179
01:29:58,923 --> 01:30:02,029
Sir. just change the title
from "Slipper" to "Blouse."

1180
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,030
Add some heat.

1181
01:30:06,931 --> 01:30:09,343
Sir. that's the answer
to all problems.

1182
01:30:09,633 --> 01:30:10,873
Life's solution, sir.

1183
01:30:11,135 --> 01:30:13,081
The one time you don't have
to ask...

1184
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:16,183
whether you're dressed right
for the occasion. Right?

1185
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,085
Just this tag line...

1186
01:30:20,478 --> 01:30:23,516
"Who is behind the blouse?"

1187
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:26,058
Get it?

1188
01:30:26,684 --> 01:30:28,994
No, no. This is it.

1189
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,957
Crack it open, sir!

1190
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:34,701
Enter the dark side.

1191
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:37,464
<i>Come...</i>

1192
01:30:38,195 --> 01:30:40,141
to the dark side.

1193
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:45,010
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

1194
01:30:47,972 --> 01:30:50,111
17 December 2009.

1195
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,386
My first book "The Witch's Blouse"
was published.

1196
01:30:53,711 --> 01:30:56,351
Many called congratulating me.

1197
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:01,623
Coincidentally that day
I got another call.

1198
01:31:05,356 --> 01:31:06,266
Hello?

1199
01:31:12,062 --> 01:31:13,598
Abhimanyu Roy?

1200
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:20,815
Bindu Shankarnaraynan.

1201
01:31:24,742 --> 01:31:26,415
From an unknown number.

1202
01:31:27,445 --> 01:31:29,049
At least you answered.

1203
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,150
Two years later.

1204
01:31:32,316 --> 01:31:33,294
Finally.

1205
01:31:34,151 --> 01:31:36,256
112 long distance calls.

1206
01:31:36,854 --> 01:31:39,960
Eight local calls.
Twenty-three letters.

1207
01:31:41,926 --> 01:31:44,532
I met your mother in Kolkata
twice.

1208
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:48,838
I felt terrible when you
didn't reply.

1209
01:31:50,468 --> 01:31:52,345
But I felt Worse....

1210
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:56,145
when I realised you were
right not to.

1211
01:32:02,546 --> 01:32:04,048
I felt...

1212
01:32:10,788 --> 01:32:11,823
How are you?

1213
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:15,361
<i>I'm good.</i>

1214
01:32:20,798 --> 01:32:24,712
Abhi, I really had to talk to you.

1215
01:32:26,871 --> 01:32:27,815
Why?

1216
01:32:30,274 --> 01:32:31,378
You see...

1217
01:32:38,582 --> 01:32:40,118
I'm getting married.

1218
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:43,596
At the end of the month.
In Bangalore.

1219
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:55,336
Abhi?

1220
01:32:57,735 --> 01:32:58,770
Yes?

1221
01:33:02,273 --> 01:33:03,479
Nothing.

1222
01:33:05,976 --> 01:33:07,887
I know you won't come...

1223
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,753
but I figured I should do
one thing right.

1224
01:33:12,716 --> 01:33:14,320
I know I'm being selfish.

1225
01:33:14,919 --> 01:33:16,956
But how could I marry
without telling you?

1226
01:33:22,026 --> 01:33:23,437
I'm happy for you.

1227
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:33,173
Ok. I'm hanging up.

1228
01:34:05,436 --> 01:34:09,816
I know that you are now
a stranger to me...

1229
01:34:10,374 --> 01:34:12,445
but Still...

1230
01:34:13,577 --> 01:34:16,888
sometimes this thought
crosses my mind...

1231
01:34:20,317 --> 01:34:22,228
Carrom is beyond you.

1232
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:25,829
Must I always open the door?

1233
01:34:31,495 --> 01:34:32,405
Mitra!

1234
01:34:32,896 --> 01:34:33,840
Bubla?

1235
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:39,979
The hotel was too costly.
100rs for mineral water.

1236
01:34:40,204 --> 01:34:41,649
Yes! We were also missing you.

1237
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,647
But you're too late...

1238
01:34:45,309 --> 01:34:47,516
I've polished off
all the sweets.

1239
01:34:47,778 --> 01:34:49,758
Come, play Carrom With us.

1240
01:34:54,518 --> 01:34:56,361
Move over! The champion is here.

1241
01:34:56,687 --> 01:34:59,031
New starts the Carrom board
horror show.

1242
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:18,485
Thank you.

1243
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:24,054
Looks like these walls
might collapse anytime.

1244
01:35:24,415 --> 01:35:25,951
You must have lunch with us.

1245
01:35:34,658 --> 01:35:35,796
You shifting?

1246
01:35:36,326 --> 01:35:37,168
No!

1247
01:35:37,428 --> 01:35:39,601
Just taking the furniture
for a picnic.

1248
01:35:39,997 --> 01:35:42,170
They got bored swung at home

1249
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,743
I'm finally selling the house.

1250
01:35:45,202 --> 01:35:47,079
No strength to look after it
any more.

1251
01:35:47,404 --> 01:35:50,044
They'll soon build
a high-rise here.

1252
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:52,184
I'll stay with Anita.

1253
01:35:52,543 --> 01:35:53,544
Aunt Anita?

1254
01:35:54,178 --> 01:35:55,156
Why not stay With Bindu?

1255
01:35:58,082 --> 01:35:59,493
We never understood you two.

1256
01:36:00,517 --> 01:36:01,962
Nor have I understood you two.

1257
01:36:05,322 --> 01:36:06,733
Bindu's bicycle.

1258
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:09,631
You know I got it for her
when she was 5 years old.

1259
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:13,234
And the dent. I crashed it
against the lamp post.

1260
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,145
I got hurt. She didn't.

1261
01:36:20,104 --> 01:36:23,210
One of you had to get hurt
some day.

1262
01:36:28,879 --> 01:36:30,187
Abhi!

1263
01:36:32,983 --> 01:36:34,155
Stop!

1264
01:36:38,522 --> 01:36:39,694
Abhi, wait!

1265
01:36:41,358 --> 01:36:43,133
I'll complain to your mother.

1266
01:36:45,062 --> 01:36:47,542
My pants will split.
Stop there!

1267
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,942
Chat later. Get on With the Work.

1268
01:37:04,248 --> 01:37:06,285
Pack all the furniture.

1269
01:37:29,773 --> 01:37:30,979
Electrician!

1270
01:37:31,408 --> 01:37:33,149
Where's that madman gone?

1271
01:37:34,578 --> 01:37:36,057
Where are you going, Bubla?

1272
01:38:22,459 --> 01:38:23,437
Hi.

1273
01:38:26,663 --> 01:38:27,835
What's your name?

1274
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,407
I'm very hungry.

1275
01:38:32,469 --> 01:38:33,504
Shall I eat your finger?

1276
01:38:35,405 --> 01:38:36,713
You have five.

1277
01:38:38,508 --> 01:38:39,486
Please.

1278
01:38:39,843 --> 01:38:42,323
Just the little one, It's yummy.

1279
01:38:42,746 --> 01:38:44,225
- No!
- Kaanchi.

1280
01:39:12,509 --> 01:39:13,579
Made friends?

1281
01:39:14,912 --> 01:39:17,654
Give us time. I tend to
grow on people.

1282
01:39:26,323 --> 01:39:29,099
I forgot. What was our
emergency code?

1283
01:39:29,893 --> 01:39:31,566
Two, or three rings?

1284
01:39:35,098 --> 01:39:37,169
Everything was an emergency
to you.

1285
01:39:37,834 --> 01:39:39,313
There was no other code.

1286
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:47,417
Pa told me you were here.

1287
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:50,421
So finally Major will live with you?

1288
01:39:51,114 --> 01:39:52,149
I know.

1289
01:39:52,749 --> 01:39:55,127
We'll soon be at each other's throats.

1290
01:39:59,456 --> 01:40:01,868
I Wanted Kaanchi to see
our old house.

1291
01:40:02,893 --> 01:40:05,567
Kaanchi? Like in the song?

1292
01:40:06,496 --> 01:40:07,440
So?

1293
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:10,074
Actually she's called
Kanchan in the song.

1294
01:40:32,856 --> 01:40:35,234
Know how long I have
waited for this moment?

1295
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:38,571
A revenge song plays...

1296
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:42,506
trembling you say:
"Forgive me, master.

1297
01:40:42,766 --> 01:40:44,245
"I made a mistake."

1298
01:40:48,572 --> 01:40:51,143
So you became a best-selling
writer after all?

1299
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,447
I should've waited a bit longer.

1300
01:40:58,048 --> 01:41:00,460
- Have you read my books?
- Are you nuts?

1301
01:41:01,218 --> 01:41:03,994
Can't even read 4 pages of
the "Bangalore Times."

1302
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,331
But...

1303
01:41:11,428 --> 01:41:13,305
on the book cover I read...

1304
01:41:13,697 --> 01:41:16,906
"The Wild Washerwoman"
will wash you away.

1305
01:41:17,434 --> 01:41:19,607
So how could I resist?

1306
01:41:21,204 --> 01:41:23,411
- What was the other one?
- I won't tell you.

1307
01:41:24,307 --> 01:41:26,810
"Tricycle." It'll puncture
your life.

1308
01:41:29,546 --> 01:41:30,547
Yuck!

1309
01:41:34,584 --> 01:41:36,564
Abhi, where are you?

1310
01:41:37,154 --> 01:41:38,292
When are we cutting the cake?

1311
01:41:38,722 --> 01:41:39,962
Rohit Ved Prakash, sir.

1312
01:41:40,857 --> 01:41:42,632
I've come to collect
Abhi's manuscript.

1313
01:41:42,859 --> 01:41:44,395
Abhi? Who knows Where he is.

1314
01:41:46,563 --> 01:41:47,735
But I have to tell you...

1315
01:41:47,998 --> 01:41:49,909
your novels are
super entertaining.

1316
01:41:50,267 --> 01:41:53,248
No matter what. You had to
become a writer.

1317
01:41:55,405 --> 01:41:56,941
<i>Horror is easy.</i>

1318
01:41:58,809 --> 01:42:01,653
I've been trying to finish
a love story for 3 years.

1319
01:42:08,585 --> 01:42:10,360
I am sure it's difficult.

1320
01:42:12,089 --> 01:42:14,467
What new is there to say
about love?

1321
01:42:17,127 --> 01:42:20,540
You'll find a new angle for sure.
Bubla Roy.

1322
01:42:21,098 --> 01:42:23,100
I know you that much.

1323
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:28,445
You must finish it.

1324
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:33,277
You'll have a hundred hits.
like Sachin.

1325
01:42:35,946 --> 01:42:39,155
Made a century.
But lost the match.

1326
01:42:45,255 --> 01:42:46,734
You advising me now?

1327
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:50,094
You have never completed
anything in life.

1328
01:42:53,263 --> 01:42:55,300
You should see me as a Mom.

1329
01:42:55,966 --> 01:42:58,037
I surprise myself sometimes.

1330
01:42:58,602 --> 01:42:59,910
I love it.

1331
01:43:01,104 --> 01:43:04,551
Bubla, this is the one thing
I'm not a disaster at.

1332
01:43:11,348 --> 01:43:12,292
Wait here.

1333
01:43:22,592 --> 01:43:23,798
Hello, hello.

1334
01:43:24,528 --> 01:43:26,599
Have you something
against my staircase?

1335
01:43:29,933 --> 01:43:31,344
It's such romantic weather.

1336
01:43:33,803 --> 01:43:35,612
Look at him gobble the cake.

1337
01:43:40,577 --> 01:43:43,148
Abhi! The manuscript will get
drenched. And I'll drown.

1338
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,191
Ruined my cake too.

1339
01:43:56,126 --> 01:43:57,002
Just read.

1340
01:43:57,394 --> 01:44:00,341
So many pages? It must
be pretty sentimental.

1341
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:03,041
Not another word. Read it.

1342
01:44:04,234 --> 01:44:07,681
Taking your revenge? Why not
play the revenge song too?

1343
01:44:15,779 --> 01:44:17,258
Where did you find that?

1344
01:44:19,749 --> 01:44:23,094
Don't go away. Don't leave me now...

1345
01:44:25,956 --> 01:44:29,802
my heart hasn't
had its fill of you.

1346
01:44:45,375 --> 01:44:48,618
You have only just arrived.

1347
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:52,786
As beautiful as the Spring.

1348
01:44:53,984 --> 01:44:55,827
Enjoy the fragrant air...

1349
01:45:11,568 --> 01:45:13,775
Bindu. In one Word...

1350
01:45:14,137 --> 01:45:16,174
My neighbour, my best friend.

1351
01:45:16,506 --> 01:45:19,612
You and me. music playing
in the background.

1352
01:45:21,044 --> 01:45:23,115
Many teach you how to love...

1353
01:45:23,813 --> 01:45:25,588
alas no one teaches you...

1354
01:45:26,816 --> 01:45:28,762
how to forget that love.

1355
01:45:51,608 --> 01:45:52,609
Bindu.

1356
01:45:53,677 --> 01:45:56,385
Without her, I could never
be complete.

1357
01:45:57,781 --> 01:45:59,419
She was better than
a half-smoked cigarette.

1358
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,059
Better than hot tea
in the cold rain.

1359
01:46:02,352 --> 01:46:05,993
More heartbreaking than the
last 10 minutes of the film "Anand."

1360
01:46:07,023 --> 01:46:09,196
Better than Zakir Hussain's tabla...

1361
01:46:09,626 --> 01:46:11,128
Sachin Tendulkar's
straight drive.

1362
01:46:11,461 --> 01:46:14,704
Hotter than Madhuri or Raveena
dancing in the rain.

1363
01:46:15,432 --> 01:46:16,911
Geeta Dutt's voice.

1364
01:46:17,367 --> 01:46:19,643
The Words of a sad Gulzar song.

1365
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:23,512
I loved Bindu more than
all these things.

1366
01:46:24,574 --> 01:46:27,384
And I Wanted her back.

1367
01:46:28,378 --> 01:46:30,756
- Why are you out of breath?
- I was running.

1368
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:33,087
From Mumbai?

1369
01:46:33,983 --> 01:46:35,860
Take of those headphones!

1370
01:46:36,353 --> 01:46:37,457
Abhi, I know...

1371
01:46:42,425 --> 01:46:43,426
In this moment...

1372
01:46:44,494 --> 01:46:45,905
no song was playing...

1373
01:46:46,563 --> 01:46:48,474
nor sound in the background.

1374
01:46:49,366 --> 01:46:51,175
No sixteen-piece orchestra.

1375
01:46:54,204 --> 01:46:55,148
Only Abhi...

1376
01:46:56,106 --> 01:46:57,278
and Bindu...

1377
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:00,719
and their fast beating hearts.

1378
01:47:03,947 --> 01:47:04,925
The End.

1379
01:47:42,585 --> 01:47:44,360
Happy endings sell better.

1380
01:47:51,127 --> 01:47:52,970
This is your story, Abhi.

1381
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:55,537
My version would be different.

1382
01:47:59,135 --> 01:48:00,170
Really?

1383
01:48:01,237 --> 01:48:02,682
What would be your version?

1384
01:48:03,673 --> 01:48:07,086
What difference does it make?
I like this one better.

1385
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:11,080
At least....

1386
01:48:11,981 --> 01:48:13,983
you found your nappy ending.

1387
01:48:14,684 --> 01:48:15,856
Your Mr Right.

1388
01:48:17,554 --> 01:48:18,624
I guess...

1389
01:48:19,389 --> 01:48:20,891
Mr Right place, right time.

1390
01:48:21,558 --> 01:48:24,164
Does he look like me?
Hot and handsome.

1391
01:48:29,966 --> 01:48:32,810
Actually, he's really handsome.

1392
01:48:33,303 --> 01:48:34,782
Not like you at all.

1393
01:48:53,323 --> 01:48:54,927
I don't want anyone else to read it.

1394
01:48:56,259 --> 01:48:58,500
My mother, your husband.

1395
01:49:01,598 --> 01:49:02,906
This is ours.

1396
01:49:05,668 --> 01:49:06,738
Yeah.

1397
01:49:16,246 --> 01:49:17,224
Listen.

1398
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:21,125
Tell me if you still want to
run away with me.

1399
01:49:21,784 --> 01:49:23,354
I'll carry you on my shudders...

1400
01:49:24,053 --> 01:49:25,293
and Whoosh!

1401
01:49:35,598 --> 01:49:37,839
I'll be too heavy for you now.

1402
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:05,166
I admit we are not friends.

1403
01:50:06,329 --> 01:50:10,106
I admit we are not lovers.

1404
01:50:22,612 --> 01:50:27,061
But do not turn to look at me...

1405
01:50:27,784 --> 01:50:31,664
my heart cannot be trusted.

1406
01:50:32,689 --> 01:50:36,899
I admit we are not friends.

1407
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:05,690
If we meet somewhere
by chance...

1408
01:51:06,522 --> 01:51:10,197
stop and shake my hand.

1409
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:26,548
If someone is walking
by your side...

1410
01:51:27,677 --> 01:51:31,284
then smile at me from afar.

1411
01:51:33,349 --> 01:51:37,764
But in that smile...

1412
01:51:38,788 --> 01:51:42,361
show not a trace of familiarity.

1413
01:51:54,737 --> 01:51:59,311
Do not let your eyes express...

1414
01:51:59,842 --> 01:52:03,756
what I can't deny.

1415
01:52:05,081 --> 01:52:08,858
I admit we are not friends.

1416
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,730
Life keeps turning from Side A
to Side B.

1417
01:52:16,759 --> 01:52:20,297
Sometimes you like a song
so much you fear it will end.

1418
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:25,507
Sometimes a song never leaves
your lips.

1419
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:30,910
Sometimes it's only
the tune that lingers.

1420
01:52:33,676 --> 01:52:38,147
Those memories in the folds
of the pages...

1421
01:52:38,948 --> 01:52:42,088
Let them turn to dust.

1422
01:52:54,664 --> 01:52:59,044
<i>If my name comes to your lips...</i>

1423
01:52:59,969 --> 01:53:03,712
just say it was a mistake.

1424
01:53:05,742 --> 01:53:10,282
But even that mistake
should be one...

1425
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,618
that you never tire of.

1426
01:53:16,519 --> 01:53:18,965
Today she is Mrs Nair.

1427
01:53:19,922 --> 01:53:22,198
A mother, a daughter-in-law.

1428
01:53:23,426 --> 01:53:26,100
But to me, she's still my Bindu.

1429
01:53:26,562 --> 01:53:30,806
She still comes into my dark life
and brightens it.

1430
01:53:37,607 --> 01:53:38,779
My Bindu.

1431
01:53:41,444 --> 01:53:43,947
My sweet Bindu.
