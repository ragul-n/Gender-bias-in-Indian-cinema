1
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,407
<i>Sometimes I admit to
myself that it's possible</i>

2
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,343
<i>I will never be able
to finish my life's work.</i>

3
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,383
<i>My one and only book.</i>

4
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,755
<i>And that in the end,
without her...</i>

5
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,031
<i>...there will be nothing.</i>

6
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,766
<i>And I will die alone.</i>

7
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,451
<i>What are you doing here,
Coane Dominic?</i>

8
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,290
I have a migraine.

9
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,925
I thought a walk might help.

10
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,695
But in your pajamas
on Christmas Eve?

11
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,263
Don't catch cold. Look.

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,435
At the first opportunity,
I'll...

13
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,440
What do you do
at the first opportunity?

14
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,945
At the first
opportunity, I have to-- I have--

15
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,780
It's in the drawer.

16
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,817
I-- I have saved--
I saved it for--

17
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:08,721
At the first opportunity,
I will open the blue envelope.

18
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,393
Not here in Piatra Neamt
where everyone knows me,

19
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,561
but somewhere far away.

20
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,401
Bucharest perhaps.

21
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,469
At Easter.

22
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,656
<i>Universul.</i>

23
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>Universul.</i>

24
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:07,673
<i>Special Easter
edition. Universul.</i>

25
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,309
War clouds over Romania.

26
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,811
Oh, it's pouring.

27
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,992
<i>Universul.</i>

28
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,707
He was struck by lightning.

29
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,775
Call an ambulance.

30
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,446
Call for some help.

31
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,982
Look, who knows
what sins he has committed

32
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,684
that God would strike him
on Easter.

33
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:57,122
They say whoever dies during
Easter goes straight to heaven.

34
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,631
<i>Dominic.</i>

35
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,173
Oh...

36
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,609
<i>I will wish you.
You know what I mean. I mean...</i>

37
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,614
<i>I will love you
until the day I die.</i>

38
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,863
The eye seems intact,

39
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:42,134
but I don't know
if he is blind or not.

40
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,837
I don't even know
if he's conscious,

41
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:50,976
if he hears or
if he understands what he hears.

42
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:56,415
If you understand what I say,
squeeze my finger.

43
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm Dr. Roman Stanciulescu.

44
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,866
I'm here to help you.

45
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,570
Good.

46
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,006
We wish to find out
your age.

47
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:25,277
For every 10 years,
squeeze my finger once.

48
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:30,683
Ten.

49
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,587
Twenty.
Twenty.

50
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,357
Thirty.

51
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,661
Forty.
Forty.

52
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,431
Fifty.
Fifty.

53
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,168
Sixty.
Sixty.

54
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,173
Seventy.
- Seventy.

55
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,242
Seventy years old.

56
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,948
Seventy. I would
have thought less.

57
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,720
Well, in this larval state,

58
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,521
it's hard to estimate.

59
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,706
<i>I've never
met anyone like you.</i>

60
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,143
<i>You want to know
absolutely everything.</i>

61
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,645
Laura, try to imagine

62
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,448
conceiving a passion
for something,

63
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,917
having one desire,
dedicating your life to it

64
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,586
and then failing.

65
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,754
I am 26.

66
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,489
I have no accomplishments,

67
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,791
I've made no discoveries.

68
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,393
I'm a failure.

69
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,328
Do you have a wife?

70
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,331
No.
- No.

71
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,866
Nephew?

72
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,871
Yes.
- Nephew.

73
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,272
Nephew.
- Do you want us

74
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,242
to inform your nephew
about your condition?

75
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,344
No.

76
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,515
Let us know the first letter
of your name. Continue.

77
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,850
I am going to say
the alphabet.

78
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:18,424
A, B, C, D...

79
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,192
D.
- D.

80
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:24,129
He doesn't live
in Bucharest.

81
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,300
He has only one relative,
a distant one,

82
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,070
and he has no wife.

83
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,237
Thank you.

84
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,445
He'll accept any test,

85
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,581
no matter how dangerous
or painful,

86
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,251
to verify whether
the optic nerve was damaged.

87
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,756
That's interesting.

88
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,271
How old did you say he was?

89
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,673
Seventy.

90
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,441
He's hiding his age.

91
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,411
He's a young man
in the prime of his life.

92
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,885
I didn't come here...

93
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,554
I came here for an education.
- Come.

94
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,757
What did you think
about the lecture?

95
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,625
Professor Matei
is getting senile.

96
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,395
He told us the same thing
three or four times.

97
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,797
I didn't
notice. I was asleep.

98
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,599
Let's go get
something to eat.

99
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,270
<i>Is it true?</i>

100
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,376
<i>Failure, success.</i>

101
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,378
<i>Such extremes, Dominic.</i>

102
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,814
You yourself taught me
about Chandrakirti.

103
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,284
The concept of tetralemma logic,
the four possibilities.

104
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,587
What you say is so,
or it is not so,

105
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,190
it's also so
and not so combined, heh,

106
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,959
or it's neither so
nor not so combined.

107
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,428
<i>You know,</i>

108
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,729
<i>I've never told you this,</i>

109
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,031
<i>but Dr. Chavannes' lecture
in Paris...</i>

110
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,199
I waited to see him.

111
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,337
I was hoping that he would
accept me as a student.

112
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,507
And he told me that if I didn't
master Chinese, Sanskrit,

113
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,278
Tibetan and Japanese,

114
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,181
I would never become
a great Orientalist.

115
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,415
But didn't you tell him

116
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,451
you wanted to study
only the Chinese language?

117
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,785
I did.

118
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,154
<i>I told him that
I'd been studying Chinese</i>

119
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,622
<i>for six months,
six hours a day.</i>

120
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,424
<i>He stepped up
to the blackboard.</i>

121
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,060
<i>He wrote
some 20 characters on it,</i>

122
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,462
<i>and he asked me
to pronounce them</i>

123
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,565
<i>one by one
and then translate the passage.</i>

124
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,434
<i>In order to master Chinese,</i>

125
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,571
<i>one must have
the memory of Mandarin.</i>

126
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,675
<i>Photographic memory.</i>

127
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,643
<i>A memory of a Mandarin.</i>

128
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,649
I remember hearing
about another case,

129
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,818
a priest hit by lightning.

130
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,754
Burned over his whole body

131
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,223
and would survive
many years afterwards.

132
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,458
True, he was left
blind and mute,

133
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,360
as our man is also probably.

134
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,031
Don't talk so loud.
Maybe he can hear you.

135
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,033
I want him to hear me.

136
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,469
Let's see how he'll react.
Maybe he isn't mute at all.

137
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,171
No!

138
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:24,476
Not mute! Not mute!

139
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,046
Try to pronounce any word,
anything.

140
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:35,320
Blue envelope.

141
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,556
Blue envelope.

142
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,757
Envelope...

143
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,562
The teeth,
they're barely holding.

144
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,231
Call the dentist right now
and see if the x-rays are ready.

145
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,908
What's next?

146
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,644
"Romania may be forced
to negotiate with Hitler."

147
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,480
France is abandoning us
to the Nazis.

148
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,782
He is right.

149
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,351
His x-rays have come in.

150
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,319
You really should
take a look at them.

151
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,791
The roots are healthy, but they
are being pushed up by new ones.

152
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,264
So we feel you're out
of danger.

153
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,570
Only now do you begin
to become an interesting case.

154
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,972
You understand why,
don't you?

155
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,807
The way the lightning
struck you,

156
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,143
you had to have been killed
on the spot,

157
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,147
or else to have died
of asphyxiation.

158
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,684
At best you'd
be left paralyzed,

159
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,522
mute or blind.

160
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,296
You are lucky,
I'll give you that.

161
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,634
Yes.

162
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,971
We had ordered a set of dentures
to allow you to eat

163
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,574
and above all,
to speak normally.

164
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,844
But the x-rays show
that, uh,

165
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:11,216
a new set of teeth
are ready to appear.

166
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,318
It's impossible.

167
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,388
Yes. It's simply impossible.

168
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,893
And yet the x-rays are clear.

169
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,596
You are getting new teeth.

170
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,102
This is no longer a case
of a living dead man,

171
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,904
but of something else.

172
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,274
What, exactly,

173
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,109
we still don't know.

174
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,546
Your recovery is amazing.

175
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,186
I don't want to tire you out.

176
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,588
Get some rest.
I'll be back tomorrow.

177
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,031
News stories
and feature articles

178
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,067
are starting to appear
in different papers,

179
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,237
the majority of them absurd,
ridiculous.

180
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,209
What are you doing?

181
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,420
New teeth!

182
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:28,093
But you must help us
understand this.

183
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,296
We have to know more about you,
who you are,

184
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,598
what your profession is.

185
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,334
What's your real age?

186
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,037
Please cooperate
a little more.

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,908
Were you so stubborn
when you were young?

188
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,646
Always.

189
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,416
<i>What is this you
insist on writing, young man?</i>

190
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:55,387
Well, I've almost finished
with antiquity, the Middle Ages.

191
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,725
But the most exciting part,
the origins.

192
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,694
The origins of language, of--

193
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,595
But when will
you finish it, Dominic?

194
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,098
He needs 10 lifetimes
to do it all.

195
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,934
The origins of
language, human consciousness,

196
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,803
even the idea
of time itself.

197
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,605
This would call for years
of research.

198
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,175
And what with the inexperience
of our provincial...

199
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,310
...librarians.

200
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,779
I'm terribly sorry,
professor.

201
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,685
I have an appointment.
I really must run.

202
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:32,658
He's brilliant. Brilliant. But--

203
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:38,864
Laura, I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

204
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,566
We have to talk,
Dominic.

205
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,201
It's very important
for both of us,

206
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,403
and I can't hide it
any longer.

207
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,105
Of course.

208
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,607
It's snowing. Should we go
to the Café Select?

209
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:53,045
No. And please don't interrupt.
It's not what you think.

210
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,392
I feel that you aren't mine,

211
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,627
that you are never here with me.

212
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,864
That you--
That you live in another time.

213
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,201
I'm not thinking
of your research,

214
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,071
which in spite of what
you believe, does interest me.

215
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,240
I wanted to help you
with that.

216
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,510
But you keep yourself shut away
in an alien world,

217
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,944
one I can't enter.

218
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,083
So for my sake and for yours,

219
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,019
we should break
our engagement and separate.

220
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,587
No.

221
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,655
Laura, no.

222
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,425
We are still young.

223
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,593
We both love life.

224
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,399
You will have more time
for your research.

225
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,703
You'll see later.

226
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,806
Tell the professor
what he wants to know.

227
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,277
Tell him you need
a new identity.

228
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,988
All right, you can go.
I'll be here all afternoon.

229
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,533
I understand
that you are willing

230
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,468
to speak to me candidly.

231
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,507
You don't have to make
a great effort.

232
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,877
The words you cannot pronounce,
you can write.

233
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,851
My name...

234
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,855
is Dominic Matei.

235
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,761
On January the 8th...

236
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,364
I reached the age of 70.

237
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,599
I am a teacher
in Piatra Neamt.

238
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,204
I live on Strada Episcopiei
at Number 18.

239
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,039
It is my house.

240
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,044
It contains a library of...

241
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:44,049
some 8,000 volumes...

242
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,022
which I have willed
to the lycée.

243
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,063
You're 70 years old?

244
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,837
Extraordinary.

245
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,374
If...

246
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,377
If you require further proof,
I can tell you the...

247
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:15,180
titles of the books
on my desk or any other...

248
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:19,151
There's an album
of photographs somewhere?

249
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,489
More precisely, with pictures
of you when you were young?

250
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,026
And some, uh, clothing?

251
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:30,396
I implore you
to be very, very discreet.

252
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,264
Agents from the Secret Service,

253
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,500
they'll never believe
I'm past 70

254
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:39,104
and therefore they'll never
believe I am who I say I am.

255
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,141
Of course.
We'll be very careful.

256
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,310
Anything can happen
if you're interrogated by them.

257
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,112
I won't let that happen.

258
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,148
It's true, though,

259
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,550
these are difficult times
in Romania.

260
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:55,821
In truth...

261
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,227
I came here with the intention
of committing suicide.

262
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,800
I had saved an envelope
with enough strychnine in it

263
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,702
to end my empty life.

264
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,739
Please...

265
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,941
could you find me
a fictitious identity?

266
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,112
That's not a problem.

267
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:24,817
When your beard comes off,
you'll look like a man of 35,

268
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,420
or, um, 40, at most.

269
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:38,831
Don't worry.

270
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:50,843
You're handsome
without the beard, you know?

271
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,315
I have your jacket.

272
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,893
If you like, you can take me
to the movies sometime.

273
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,669
The sleeves are
too short.

274
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,936
And the tie is no good.

275
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,005
They look like
an old man's clothes.

276
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,856
Go with him.

277
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,199
I've seen that car before.

278
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,935
Last night in my dream.

279
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,740
Some people might say
that's a bad omen.

280
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,442
I'm not superstitious.

281
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,445
They're waiting for us.

282
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,450
Professor.

283
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,859
Welcome. Thank you, doctor.

284
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,933
There's wild roses
somewhere.

285
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,978
I want you to note down
all that passes through your mind.

286
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,451
All the books you've read,
all the languages you know,

287
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:16,488
everything, all the memories,
no matter how insignificant.

288
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,323
If you aren't in the mood
to write,

289
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,392
or if you have
too much to say,

290
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:21,493
use this device.

291
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,402
German, I'm sorry to say.

292
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:32,805
A wire recorder.

293
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,412
How do I operate this?

294
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,721
<i>DOMINIC
How do I operate this?</i>

295
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,427
My memory...

296
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,766
My memory is unbelievable.

297
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,040
I have a surprise for you.

298
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,942
Soon you'll receive
all the things

299
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,945
from your home
in Piatra Neamt:

300
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,614
your reference books,
dictionaries,

301
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,216
personal belongings.

302
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,723
Ah.

303
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,227
The watch she gave me.

304
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:39,031
I've brought
your family album.

305
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:42,768
The one with your pictures
from lycée and the university.

306
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,142
What are you thinking?

307
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,147
What kind of memories?

308
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,788
What kind of associations?

309
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,707
When I look
at that photograph,

310
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,680
I sense the heat

311
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,715
of that morning.

312
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:42,027
The fragrance of the oleander.

313
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,534
Laura's scent.

314
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,136
Soap...

315
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,573
on her skin.

316
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:56,608
It's unforgettable.

317
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,325
She married someone else,
you know.

318
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:18,364
And a year later
she died in childbirth.

319
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,740
It was awful.

320
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:32,511
It's a kind of hypermnesia
with lateral effects.

321
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,081
It's...

322
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,850
too much,

323
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:39,718
and it's useless.

324
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,955
It seems useless

325
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:47,159
because we don't know yet
what to do with it,

326
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,396
with this fantastic

327
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,865
recovery of memory.

328
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,367
It's useless.

329
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:56,802
Soon it will be learned

330
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,170
that someone,

331
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,807
an old man of unknown origin,
was struck by lightning

332
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:02,975
and after 10 weeks

333
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:06,311
appeared perfectly healthy
and young again.

334
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,620
Let's hope the rest
will not be found out.

335
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,249
The anterior-posterior
diameter, 19 centimeters.

336
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,790
The height of the face,
12 centimeters.

337
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,035
And the length of
the nose, 6 centimeters.

338
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:08,207
The sexual
organs look like those of a man of 40.

339
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,309
They are fully functional.

340
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,612
My opinion: the patient
is clinically youthful.

341
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,818
I warned you there would be

342
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,721
a sort of international
consultation.

343
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:23,889
They had to see firsthand.

344
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,391
They couldn't believe
the reports

345
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>I published
in La Presse Médicale.</i>

346
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,430
Well, I wasn't expecting
such questions.

347
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:34,133
Especially since I was still
in the hospital and had no way

348
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:38,637
of confirming or ruling out
sexual possibilities.

349
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:40,806
Excuse me.

350
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:45,144
In your notebooks,
you speak of erotic dreams.

351
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,413
Are you sure they were dreams?

352
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,517
I don't know.

353
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:55,087
But if I've confused erotic
dreams with real experiences,

354
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,256
my life is far more interesting
than I'd imagined.

355
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,257
Good,

356
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:01,026
we value this information.

357
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,261
Thank you.

358
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:08,133
But in the case
of the young lady in Room 6,

359
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,869
my friend,

360
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,107
that woman was imposed on us
by the Secret Service.

361
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,648
What young lady in Room 6?

362
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,216
Have we met
somewhere before?

363
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,787
Of course we've met before.

364
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,791
Several times, in fact.

365
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,297
I am impressed.
You are very discreet.

366
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,267
Where?

367
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,270
And when?

368
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,775
Most recently,
last night in Room 6.

369
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,280
Your room is next door.

370
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,262
Open up!

371
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,732
Second floor is clear.

372
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,345
Sir...
- Over here.

373
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,714
Over here or there?
- Hey, get out of the car.

374
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,116
Hey, you, stop
the car. Stop the car.

375
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,674
Don't worry.

376
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:44,143
It had to happen
like this,

377
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,679
for you to be confused
with others,

378
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,949
for people to think you can't
distinguish dream from reality.

379
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,152
Who is taking care of me?

380
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,622
Did you think all you've gone
through is due to chance?

381
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:58,490
Who is watching over me?

382
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,727
It doesn't matter now.
You'll find out later.

383
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:04,396
Besides, you've guessed
some of it already.

384
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:07,166
Otherwise, why haven't you
told the professor

385
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:11,136
about...
certain dreams like this?

386
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,471
Stop.

387
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:16,642
If you know
someone else exists,

388
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,878
why have you never
referred to it?

389
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,347
I must not think,
I must not think,

390
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,248
I must not think
of anything.

391
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,085
I must not think,
I must not think of anything.

392
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:29,054
<i>I must not think,
I must not think of anything.</i>

393
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,989
<i>I must not think,
I must not think...</i>

394
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,475
<i>Yes.</i>

395
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:55,147
You learn more quickly,
more profoundly, in sleep.

396
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:57,583
You told the professor
that in sleep

397
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:00,219
you continued your studies
of the daytime.

398
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,124
Little by little, you discovered
you'd mastered Chinese,

399
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:09,461
just as later, you discovered
you'd mastered other languages.

400
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,034
I'm beginning to understand
what's happening to me.

401
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,368
Yes.

402
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:18,537
Good.

403
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,742
The enormous concentration

404
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:28,380
of electricity that exploded
directly above me

405
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:32,384
regenerated me and...

406
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,756
amplified fabulously
all my mental faculties.

407
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:42,161
But this electrical discharge
also made possible

408
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:45,898
the emergence of a new
personality, a sort of...

409
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,267
double.

410
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,235
Yes.

411
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:53,672
The formula of the double

412
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:57,376
is...correct and useful.

413
00:37:57,377 --> 00:38:00,212
But don't be in a hurry
to tell the professor.

414
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:37,750
So, what I can say?

415
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:38,917
A man was about to

416
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:41,253
cross the street.

417
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:44,256
He was 70 or 80 years old.

418
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:55,467
The young lady
in Room 6

419
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:58,437
disappeared
two days ago.

420
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:11,684
Your companion of a night,
or several.

421
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:14,853
I'm afraid it was several.

422
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,256
WOMAN
Do you love me?

423
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:23,162
Yes, more than I could
have imagined.

424
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:28,534
Tell me how you desire me,
how you long for me.

425
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:32,905
You are my dream
and my goddess.

426
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,507
ROMAN
She recorded all your conversations

427
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:37,943
and transmitted them
to the Gestapo.

428
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:40,045
And when she asked you
questions

429
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,848
<i>in Russian, Polish
or German,</i>

430
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:46,552
<i>you replied without difficulty
in all those languages.</i>

431
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:53,859
It's probable that after
listening to the recordings,

432
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,031
someone high up in the Reich
decided to kidnap you.

433
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,634
Kidnap me?

434
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:03,702
You have become

435
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:06,572
the most valuable human specimen

436
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:10,476
existing today
on the face of the earth.

437
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,911
Come, have your chicken.

438
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:17,483
All the medical schools
in the world

439
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:19,818
would like to study you.

440
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,821
As a sort of guinea pig.
- Professor.

441
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,724
We are doing all we can
to prevent that.

442
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:27,659
Professor, ahem,

443
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,261
in your office,
you must come.

444
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,363
Please, professor,
immediately.

445
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:44,443
We are disturbed over your level
of cooperation, Herr Professor.

446
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,446
As you see, your government
has instructed you

447
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,081
to relinquish
the patient

448
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:52,117
and all relevant files
to our custody.

449
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:02,695
I'm sorry, I cannot
comply with this one.

450
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:05,197
"Cannot comply"?

451
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:07,866
I will not turn over
the patient himself.

452
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:09,401
As his doctor,

453
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:13,639
his condition won't allow
transfer at this time.

454
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:22,915
I'll return
with a German doctor.

455
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,097
Good.

456
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,532
You're behaving as you should

457
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,969
in order to create
the necessary confusion.

458
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,374
The double.

459
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,910
He always answers the questions
I'm ready to ask.

460
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:53,712
Like a true
guardian angel.

461
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:58,050
Now that's a correct
and useful formula.

462
00:41:58,051 --> 00:41:59,718
Are there others?

463
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,320
Many.

464
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,255
For example?

465
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:08,360
Along with angels and guardian
angels, there are powers:

466
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,429
Archangels,

467
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,399
seraphim, cherubim.

468
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,269
Intermediary beings
par excellence.

469
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,071
Intermediary
between consciousness

470
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:22,007
and unconsciousness?

471
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:23,475
Well, of course.

472
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:27,646
But also between
nature and man,

473
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,549
man and the divine,

474
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,620
reason and Eros.

475
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:37,256
Feminine and masculine,

476
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:39,425
darkness and light,

477
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,293
matter and spirit.

478
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:47,366
So it's come back
to my old passion again:

479
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:52,171
philosophy of religion.

480
00:42:52,172 --> 00:42:54,773
Yes,

481
00:42:54,774 --> 00:42:57,209
for you it will always
come back to that.

482
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:02,314
But I can't believe
in the objective reality

483
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:05,250
of the person
with whom I'm conversing. I--

484
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,456
I can only think of him
as my double.

485
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:13,158
Well, in a sense,

486
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,427
that's what he is, but...

487
00:43:17,163 --> 00:43:21,033
that doesn't mean
he doesn't exist

488
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:23,736
in an objective way
independently.

489
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:25,771
Oh, I'd like to be convinced,
but--

490
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:30,709
In metaphysical controversies,
empirical proofs

491
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,245
lose their value, but...

492
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:41,120
wouldn't you enjoy receiving

493
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:44,289
a few fresh roses

494
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,091
picked from the garden?

495
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:48,394
I've always liked roses.

496
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:50,729
Well, where would you like me
to put them?

497
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,701
Not in the vase,
at any rate.

498
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:01,240
One right here

499
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:02,775
in my hand...

500
00:44:05,011 --> 00:44:08,514
as I'm holding it now, open.

501
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:20,159
And another on my knee?

502
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,667
The third rose.

503
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:31,370
Where do you want me
to put the third rose?

504
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:34,707
Let's see.

505
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:41,347
Things are more serious
than we thought.

506
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:45,851
We know now why the Gestapo
will try anything,

507
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:48,220
anything, in order to get
their hands on you.

508
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:51,490
Why?

509
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:54,893
Among the intimates
of Goebbels,

510
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,930
there is an enigmatic
and ambiguous person,

511
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,933
a certain Dr. Josef Rudolf.

512
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,807
<i>Dr. Rudolf believes that
electrocution by a current</i>

513
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:10,809
<i>of at least a million volts</i>

514
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,145
<i>could produce
a radical mutation</i>

515
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:15,114
<i>of the human species.</i>

516
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:19,651
<i>Word of these experiments</i>

517
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:22,654
<i>has reached the ear
of Adolf Hitler,</i>

518
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:26,325
<i>who has become personally
interested in your case.</i>

519
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:34,600
Attention!
The experiment begins!

520
00:45:57,824 --> 00:46:02,327
They want
us to lend you to them

521
00:46:02,328 --> 00:46:04,897
for a period of time.

522
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:07,366
God help me.

523
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,267
Time, Dominic,

524
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:12,905
we are running out of time.

525
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:25,651
MAN Austrian-Swiss
border. Passport control.

526
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:29,621
Please disembark
with all luggage.

527
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:16,301
An order has just come in
from Vienna

528
00:47:16,302 --> 00:47:20,806
that certain nationals
will be detained.

529
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:24,209
But why? I have
a valid passport and visa.

530
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,678
Please take a step back.

531
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:54,873
Go on!

532
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:58,811
My cooperation with the Nazis
is only symbolic.

533
00:47:58,812 --> 00:47:59,478
Go ahead.

534
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:02,948
Thank you.

535
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:37,549
<i>DOMINIC

536
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,853
<i>1941, May the 7th.</i>

537
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:43,655
<i>Dominic Matei, dictation.</i>

538
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,766

safety-deposit box

539
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:57,069
summarize my life,
which was profoundly changed

540
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,138
in the spring of 1938,

541
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,407
in front of the Gara de Nord
railway station

542
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:02,741
in Bucharest.

543
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:04,243
My first experiences

544
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:08,147
were described and analyzed
by Professor Roman Stanciulescu,

545
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:11,950
in reports which were
confiscated by the Nazis.

546
00:49:16,856 --> 00:49:19,391
<i>The war rages around me.</i>

547
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:22,194
<i>I am a fugitive
in neutral Switzerland,</i>

548
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:23,662
<i>encircled by the Axis powers.</i>

549
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:32,971
<i>My Romanian homeland has
made a pact with the devil,</i>

550
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,807
<i>Adolf Hitler,</i>

551
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:37,276
<i>and may soon be under siege.</i>

552
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:43,082
<i>I've lost contact
with my dear friend,</i>

553
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,717
<i>Professor Stanciulescu,</i>

554
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:45,951
<i>which could mean
that he's been killed.</i>

555
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:57,629
<i>I live in fear,</i>

556
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,165
<i>dreading what awaits
in the alleyways.</i>

557
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,401
<i>Eluding capture by my wits,</i>

558
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,937
<i>moving from hotel
to rooming house,</i>

559
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,872
<i>always working on my book.</i>

560
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:12,177
<i>November the 30th, 1941.</i>

561
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:16,915
<i>Zurich. Dominic Matei.</i>

562
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,484
<i>I have explained
in portfolio B</i>

563
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,452
<i>how I instinctually
found the talent</i>

564
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:23,155
<i>to preserve myself.</i>

565
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:25,124
<i>Living like a secret agent,</i>

566
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:28,560
<i>I discovered abilities
to forge documents,</i>

567
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:31,363
<i>change addresses
and prepare disguises.</i>

568
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:41,440
<i>Shortly before he disappeared,
Professor Stanciulescu</i>

569
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:44,209
<i>arranged a bank account
for me in Geneva</i>

570
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,145
<i>under the name
of William Pedersen.</i>

571
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:50,416
<i>Now, without him,
these funds will be depleted.</i>

572
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,685
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Pedersen.

573
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:55,387
<i>And I will have
to find other means.</i>

574
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:01,226
<i>February the 20th, 1942.</i>

575
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:03,062
<i>Bern.</i>

576
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:06,999
<i>I must face the undeniable
and chilling truth,</i>

577
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,534
<i>that I am a mutant.</i>

578
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:11,970
<i>Like a character
in a science-fiction novel,</i>

579
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:15,274
<i>I am a strange superman
of the future.</i>

580
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,880
<i>I have access to knowledge
unavailable to mankind.</i>

581
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:24,850
<i>Powers I don't fully
understand.</i>

582
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:34,093
<i>Despite this, I try to behave
as an ordinary intellectual,</i>

583
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:36,295
<i>working to complete my book,</i>

584
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,497
<i>documenting the origin
of language</i>

585
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,666
<i>and human consciousness.</i>

586
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:44,703
<i>I began to realize that
with any text I had before me,</i>

587
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:46,872
<i>if I wanted to know
the content,</i>

588
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:50,376
<i>I simply...knew it.</i>

589
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:58,951
<i>Lake Campione.
October the 23rd, 1942.</i>

590
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:06,291
<i>I found I could augment
my income.</i>

591
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:09,828
<i>Winning just enough
not to arouse suspicion.</i>

592
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:12,498
No more bets.

593
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:16,068
<i>Nothing is as it seems,
I am the proof of that.</i>

594
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:17,603
We've got a winner.

595
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:19,138
Dominic Matei?

596
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,507
Dominic Matei.

597
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,942
<i>I trust no one.</i>

598
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:26,979
Look at these.

599
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,248
See? These were taken
at the clinic

600
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:32,117
of Dr. Stanciulescu...

601
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:35,421
in 1938.

602
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:39,491
And to think, 10 months ago,
on January 8th,

603
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:40,859
you turned 74 years old.

604
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,096
Eleven again.

605
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:45,497
You're trying
to look older too.

606
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:47,466
Those glasses aren't
even prescription.

607
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:54,006
I still don't-- Thank you.
I still don't know

608
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,908
with whom I have the pleasure
to be speaking.

609
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:58,043
Ted Jones, Jr.

610
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:01,113
<i>I'm a correspondent
for LIFE magazine.</i>

611
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:03,349
Listen.

612
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,385
Switzerland is entirely
surrounded by the Axis powers.

613
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:09,455
I'm cashing out.
Thank you.

614
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,890
I'm on special assignment
for the United States.

615
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:14,893
I really think you're
confusing me with someone else.

616
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:17,629
We can protect your identity,
completely.

617
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,432
I have a very powerful
organization behind me.

618
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:23,602
I know I can be
of some service to you.

619
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:25,771
We can pay you, or we can make

620
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:28,040
some arrangements for you,
anything that might help you.

621
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:37,383
You know,
your English is perfect,

622
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,651
but you're not saying anything.

623
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:46,091
I'm afraid I must remain
neutral in all of this.

624
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:47,459
Now, if you'll excuse me.

625
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:51,930
<i>If someone were to tell me
that there exist among us</i>

626
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:56,769
<i>authentic magicians, saints,
bodhisattvas,</i>

627
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,972
<i>or anyone endowed
with miraculous powers,</i>

628
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,440
<i>I would believe them.</i>

629
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:05,310
In a certain sense,
what you say is true.

630
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,379
But you've attained
the freedom to accept

631
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,847
or reject
these new conditions

632
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:13,686
to use them to finish
your life's work, or not.

633
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:15,821
Have you decided?

634
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,726
To use them for good

635
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:22,294
or for evil.

636
00:54:22,295 --> 00:54:24,763
<i>Have you decided?</i>

637
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:46,618
<i>Despite my precautions,</i>

638
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,420
<i>I was afraid
I would inadvertently</i>

639
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:51,256
<i>give myself away
conversing with professors</i>

640
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:53,425
<i>and colleagues
at the university.</i>

641
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:56,729
<i>I knew more than any of them
and understood things</i>

642
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,897
<i>they never even
suspected existed.</i>

643
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,548
I know you're
a good friend

644
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:18,484
of the Romanian
Professor Stanciulescu.

645
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:23,122
I'm very sorry. I heard he died
in a plane crash, an accident.

646
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:27,059
But we can talk about this
when my friend gets here.

647
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,028
I told him to come at 9:00.

648
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:30,963
Your friend?

649
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:33,399
Dr. Monroe.

650
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,535
The director of an important
gerontology foundation.

651
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:42,041
He's Swiss, like me.

652
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,512
Like you.

653
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,987
You know,
I do have a name.

654
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:58,557
Would you like to know it?

655
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:10,736
Be careful.

656
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,208
He knows who you are.

657
00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:19,845
Hello, I'm Dr. Monroe.

658
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:21,513
Head of the foundation
investigating

659
00:56:21,514 --> 00:56:23,015
the materials
of Professor Stanciulescu.

660
00:56:26,686 --> 00:56:29,388
I'm afraid I have no idea
to what you're referring.

661
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,757
The belief that youth and life

662
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:33,926
can be prolonged in any way
other than by the purely

663
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,260
biochemical ones.

664
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:36,228
You do know
what I'm referring to?

665
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:39,598
No, I'm sorry.

666
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,634
Methods proposed
by that Nazi, Dr. Rudolf.

667
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:48,007
Electrocution by means
of a million or more volts.

668
00:56:48,008 --> 00:56:49,541
Insane.

669
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,778
Fortunately, I believe
that method was never tried.

670
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:55,681
But our informants said
that Professor Stanciulescu

671
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:59,018
had worked with a somewhat
analogous case of rejuvenation

672
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,919
induced by a bolt
of lightning.

673
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:07,092
We know who you are,
Mr. Dominic Matei.

674
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:11,797
Now, I have a prior engagement,
I really must run.

675
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:13,932
I'm terribly sorry.
- I know.

676
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:16,935
Perhaps we could have dinner.
Later tonight?

677
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:40,726
Mr. Matei?

678
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:42,795
What do we do with time?

679
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:49,335
That question,
"what do we do with time"

680
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:55,007
expresses the supreme ambiguity
of the human condition.

681
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:57,843
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

682
00:57:57,844 --> 00:58:00,813
An opportunity has been
given to us.

683
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,717
We, the human race.

684
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:07,653
"We"?

685
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:10,522
No.

686
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:24,470
You and I both know
what is coming:

687
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:27,206
atomic warfare,
cataclysmic destruction.

688
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,408
But unlike the others,

689
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:33,879
I'm trying to find a meaning
to this impending catastrophe.

690
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,081
Think of me as the last
European optimist.

691
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:38,684
This can be our life's work.

692
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:40,185
Please.

693
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:47,693
There are a few of us who since
1938 have known that you exist.

694
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,897
The fact that you appeared
all of a sudden

695
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:54,099
means that you have
a special mission

696
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,403
and that you possess means
of knowledge much superior

697
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,304
to those available to us.

698
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:00,673
You are gravely mistaken.

699
00:59:03,643 --> 00:59:07,780
What is indispensable
to a truly human existence?

700
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:09,682
For instance,

701
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:15,421
the Occidental artistic
treasury, music and poetry,

702
00:59:15,422 --> 00:59:18,691
but also a part
of classic philosophy,

703
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:23,562
and above all, science.

704
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:25,564
Post-historic man
will be allergic to science

705
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,166
for at least
one or two centuries.

706
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:31,403
No, always science.

707
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:34,106
Science above all.
- Dominic.

708
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:35,641
I'm surprised at you.

709
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:38,043
Dominic, don't believe
anything he says.

710
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:39,044
Shut up!

711
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:41,180
I will tell him the truth.

712
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:43,515
Come, Dominic,
join me in this work.

713
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:45,317
He is Dr. Josef Rudolf,

714
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:47,286
Hitler's most
dedicated scientist.

715
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,223
Adolf Hitler?

716
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:57,196
If you actually knew him...

717
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:01,734
If you had ever been with him,
in his presence...

718
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,204
If I could describe it to you...

719
01:00:07,173 --> 01:00:09,475
Well, uh,

720
01:00:09,476 --> 01:00:10,809
you will meet him soon enough.

721
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:19,284
No! The Gestapo
had Stanciulescu killed

722
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:20,552
and Rudolf was the one--
Traitor!

723
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:27,726
You have no choice
in the matter.

724
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:29,261
Dominic.

725
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:34,566
You were
the honey in my dreams.

726
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:37,202
WOMAN
Forgive me. Please, forgive me.

727
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:43,709
It's true what he says.

728
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:47,146
You really have no choice
in the matter.

729
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:06,392
Geneva 1955, 20th of August,

730
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,894
about 10:31 a.m.
Dominic Matei.

731
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:12,798
<i>I've decided to stop
making notes in English</i>

732
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,933
<i>and instead to use
an artificial language</i>

733
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,669
<i>of my own invention.</i>

734
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:21,306
Now I can
describe paradoxical situations

735
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:25,010
impossible to express
in any existing language.

736
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:27,279
This will permit me
to reveal facts

737
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,716
I have not dared
to confess in writing.

738
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:33,218
This language will
only be deciphered

739
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:36,522
by means
of a perfected computer.

740
01:02:36,523 --> 01:02:39,925
So my testimony is addressed
to the future,

741
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:42,928
let us say in the year 2010.

742
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,730
But to whom?

743
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:47,299
The coming nuclear wars

744
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,002
will destroy many civilizations.

745
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:53,238
Undoubtedly, this will unleash

746
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:59,078
a wave of deep pessimism,
historically unprecedented.

747
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,880
A general despondency.

748
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:05,217
My testimony,
deciphered in the future,

749
01:03:05,218 --> 01:03:08,020
could counter the despair

750
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:10,856
because it shows
the potential of humanity:

751
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:12,791
<i>a species superior
to Homo sapiens,</i>

752
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:16,428
<i>born in a far-off future.</i>

753
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:19,198
<i>This depends
on the preservation</i>

754
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,634
<i>of the material
in the safe-deposit box.</i>

755
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:26,372
<i>I don't know how
this will be assured.</i>

756
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:33,612
<i>But I do not
doubt that the material</i>

757
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:36,982
<i>will be preserved.</i>

758
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:42,388
<i>Otherwise,</i>

759
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,989
<i>my life would have
no meaning.</i>

760
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:56,402
WOMAN
Hello!

761
01:03:58,571 --> 01:04:00,205
Excuse me,

762
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:02,274
what's the best way
up to the top?

763
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,351
Is it Laura?

764
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:14,987
She's afraid of curvy roads.

765
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:17,156
I really don't think
you should go on.

766
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,791
There's a storm coming in.

767
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:23,862
We're used to mountain storms.
And anyway, we can't wait.

768
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:25,264
It is.

769
01:04:29,736 --> 01:04:32,171
Our vacation will
be over in a few days.

770
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,172
Maybe I can help.

771
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:38,510
That's it.

772
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,014
That's it.

773
01:04:43,483 --> 01:04:47,152
I'm Veronica.
What's your name?

774
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:48,253
Dominic.

775
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:50,556
With her,
you use your real name.

776
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:54,727
Thank you.

777
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,802
Be careful.

778
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:05,270
Goodbye, Dominic.

779
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:10,476
<i>I can only guess what happened.</i>

780
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:12,411
<i>When the big storm broke out,</i>

781
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,712
they were probably
on the road

782
01:05:13,713 --> 01:05:15,347
that runs under
the mountain wall,

783
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:17,549
where most
of the lightning struck.

784
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,985
I'm afraid they could have
been buried in a rockslide

785
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:23,055
or a close strike of lightning
can cause a heart attack.

786
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:27,026
Your name?

787
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:29,261
Martin Audricourt.

788
01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:32,965
Passport, please.

789
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:43,709
You know, I can always
go in a taxi by myself.

790
01:05:45,578 --> 01:05:48,147
If I need help, I'll call
from the first service station.

791
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:02,561
I don't think they could
have had time to reach the shelter.

792
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,697
They could have taken refuge

793
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:07,032
in one of the crevices
in the wall.

794
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:11,003
Oh, there's their car.

795
01:06:14,374 --> 01:06:15,941
There's a woman
over here.

796
01:06:30,423 --> 01:06:31,824
She's dead.

797
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:45,304
<i>Om, shanti</i>

798
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,573
<i>Shanti</i>

799
01:06:48,908 --> 01:06:50,275
Veronica?

800
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:54,179
What happened?
Are you all right?

801
01:06:59,119 --> 01:06:59,685
Sanskrit.

802
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:03,956
How can it be?

803
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,662
She's had a shock.
She's suffering from amnesia.

804
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:46,098
What language is that?
What is she speaking?

805
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,835
It's an Indian language,
I think.

806
01:07:49,836 --> 01:07:55,841
Her papers identify her
as Veronica Buehler, age 25.

807
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,409
Occupation: school teacher.

808
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:00,145
Living in Liestal,
Canton Bâle-Campagne.

809
01:08:00,146 --> 01:08:02,014
Excuse me.
- Please.

810
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:04,516
You're the only one
who can calm her

811
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:07,386
and speak her language,
Mr...?

812
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:08,754
Audricourt.

813
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,255
I'm a student of linguistics.

814
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,876
Greetings.

815
01:08:30,877 --> 01:08:33,345
Greetings.

816
01:08:34,514 --> 01:08:36,815
What is your name?

817
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:45,758
It is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

818
01:08:48,928 --> 01:08:51,597
My name is Rupini.

819
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:55,934
Thank you.

820
01:09:01,775 --> 01:09:03,242
Good morning.

821
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:08,747
What can you tell us,
Mr. Audricourt?

822
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,562
The young woman believes

823
01:09:23,563 --> 01:09:25,898
she is living
in northeastern India

824
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:26,865
14 centuries ago.

825
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:30,502
She feels
that she has spent

826
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:34,873
several months
in a cave meditating.

827
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:39,445
Now, this is where she was
when a big storm broke out

828
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:43,349
and she saw lightning strike
above her on the mountain.

829
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:48,420
Many large rocks were dislodged,
blocking the mouth of the cave.

830
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:52,458
Is that all?

831
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,394
She asserts her name
is Rupini,

832
01:09:57,263 --> 01:09:59,965
daughter of Nagabhatta,

833
01:09:59,966 --> 01:10:03,902
descended from one of the first
families to convert to Buddhism.

834
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:12,044
She became a disciple
of the philosopher Chandrakirti,

835
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:17,049
which is why she was in the cave
copying down his works.

836
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,584
I see.

837
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:23,689
Would you mind if I discuss this
a moment with my colleagues?

838
01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:26,191
Not at all.

839
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:47,946
We will invite
some doctors from, uh,

840
01:10:47,947 --> 01:10:50,916
Zurich, Basel and Geneva
to come to see her.

841
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:53,852
I...

842
01:10:53,853 --> 01:10:56,188
If I might make a suggestion?

843
01:10:56,189 --> 01:10:57,856
Yes.

844
01:10:57,857 --> 01:11:00,859
Perhaps some experts from
the Oriental Institute in Rome

845
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,361
might be necessary.

846
01:11:02,362 --> 01:11:05,731
Necessary for what?

847
01:11:05,732 --> 01:11:09,535
Well, to confirm
if what she's saying is fact.

848
01:11:10,704 --> 01:11:12,304
Fact?

849
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:13,405
Exactly.

850
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:24,883
I present to
you Professor Giuseppe Tucci

851
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:26,485
from the Oriental Institute
in Rome.

852
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:28,320
I am Blasi, his assistant.

853
01:11:31,191 --> 01:11:33,659
Professor
Tucci, it's an honor.

854
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:45,738
Before we begin,
who wrote the telegram

855
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:47,573
that included
some of the particulars?

856
01:11:47,574 --> 01:11:49,708
I did, professor.

857
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:51,243
You're a Sanskritist?

858
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:53,879
Not exactly. Excuse me.

859
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,215
Uh, but I have an interest
in Oriental studies.

860
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:59,018
I came only because
of your report.

861
01:11:59,019 --> 01:12:00,386
Thank you.

862
01:12:00,387 --> 01:12:02,821
You did well.

863
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:12,297
Well-being, your ladyship.

864
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,465
Well-being, your ladyship.

865
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:18,170
Welcome to both of you.

866
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,208
Where am I?

867
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:27,179
Why doesn't anybody
understand me?

868
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:37,489
As in dreams, the mind presents
the appearance of duality.

869
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,492
We've had some of her
remarks translated into English.

870
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:46,799
The young woman's knowledge
of Madhyamika philosophy

871
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,235
and her master, Chandrakirti,
is convincing.

872
01:12:51,738 --> 01:12:54,206
The discussion only became
delicate whenever Rupini

873
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:59,778
asked what had happened to her,
where she was

874
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:01,847
and why no one understood her.

875
01:13:01,848 --> 01:13:03,782
What did you tell her,
professor?

876
01:13:03,783 --> 01:13:05,951
I always
begin by reminding of maya.

877
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:08,153
The cosmic illusion.

878
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,656
The great witch.

879
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:12,858
Actually it's
not a dream, I told her,

880
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:14,026
but it takes part

881
01:13:14,027 --> 01:13:16,595
in the illusory nature
of dreaming,

882
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:21,867
because it is the future,
therefore, of time.

883
01:13:21,868 --> 01:13:25,838
Now, time is
par excellence unreal.

884
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:28,040
I don't believe
I convinced her.

885
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,241
But fortunately, she's, uh,

886
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:31,176
enthusiastic about logic
and dialectics,

887
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:33,145
and that's mainly
what we discussed.

888
01:13:33,146 --> 01:13:34,613
MAN
Uh, professor,

889
01:13:34,614 --> 01:13:38,417
could all this possibly be...?

890
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:40,986
How shall I say?

891
01:13:40,987 --> 01:13:42,488
Fact?

892
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:44,590
"Fact"?

893
01:13:46,826 --> 01:13:48,360
Mmm.

894
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:50,229
I would suggest
a journey to India,

895
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:52,965
more precisely to the province
of Uttar Pradesh,

896
01:13:52,966 --> 01:13:57,136
to the caves where Rupini
claims to have meditated.

897
01:13:57,137 --> 01:14:00,472
I should think
the Oriental Institute of Rome,

898
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:04,309
of which I am president,
would sponsor the expedition.

899
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,411
And, young man,

900
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:08,213
I think you should
accompany us to India.

901
01:14:08,214 --> 01:14:09,948
I'd be delighted,
professor.

902
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:14,153
It's been understood she will
be put into a deep sleep

903
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:15,454
before leaving the clinic

904
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,056
and will continue
to sleep

905
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:19,958
until we reach the vicinity
of the caves.

906
01:15:04,604 --> 01:15:06,171
Start rolling. Rolling!

907
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:07,473
Tucci! Tucci, look here!

908
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,013
We are very close
to the frontier of Nepal.

909
01:15:48,014 --> 01:15:50,282
According to Rupini's account,

910
01:15:50,283 --> 01:15:52,751
this is where we'll find the
cave where she would meditate.

911
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:20,245
We are very fortunate in having
a pandit from Gorakhpur

912
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:22,614
familiar with
the Madhyamika philosophy.

913
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:24,483
He'll be at her side
when she awakens.

914
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:38,097
Everyone,
hide themselves.

915
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,316
No form,

916
01:16:57,317 --> 01:16:59,952
no feeling,

917
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:01,186
no thought,

918
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:03,789
no choice,

919
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:07,292
no consciousness.

920
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:14,733
Gone, gone,

921
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:17,436
gone beyond,
completely gone.

922
01:17:18,705 --> 01:17:20,773
Enlightenment.

923
01:17:20,774 --> 01:17:22,107
So be it.

924
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:24,176
Welcome.

925
01:17:35,488 --> 01:17:39,258
Why did it take you so long?

926
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:41,727
I was already here.

927
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:12,424
I know this place.

928
01:18:33,146 --> 01:18:35,114
Stay back. Hide yourself.

929
01:18:42,722 --> 01:18:44,189
Over here!

930
01:19:04,277 --> 01:19:05,611
Ah!

931
01:19:07,714 --> 01:19:09,248
Oh, God.

932
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:10,282
Are you all right?

933
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,294
Just be still. Lay still.

934
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,030
Just rest.

935
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:26,331
Veronica.

936
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:29,902
TUCCI
She recognized it.

937
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:32,338
This is the cave!

938
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:33,872
But the entrance is blocked.

939
01:20:52,752 --> 01:20:56,755
I don't think
you'll be needing me for a while.

940
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:22,915
She is awake,

941
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:25,150
but she has not
opened her eyes.

942
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:34,560
Greetings.

943
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:42,568
How are you feeling, Rupini?

944
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:53,479
Didn't we--? Didn't
we ask directions of you today?

945
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,350
<i>My name is Veronica Buehler,</i>

946
01:21:58,351 --> 01:22:01,020
<i>and I speak three languages:</i>

947
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:03,589
<i>German, French and English.</i>

948
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,759
<i>Have you ever tried to
learn any Oriental language?</i>

949
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,926
<i>Never.</i>

950
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:10,396
<i>Or have you ever read anything</i>

951
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:12,364
<i>about India
or Indian culture?</i>

952
01:22:12,365 --> 01:22:14,166
<i>Some popular books.</i>

953
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:15,334
<i>Like?</i>

954
01:22:15,335 --> 01:22:18,270
<i>Heh. Rudyard Kipling,
I think?</i>

955
01:22:18,271 --> 01:22:19,571
The Jungle Book.

956
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:21,140
<i>Have you ever heard</i>

957
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:23,475
<i>the name Rupini?</i>

958
01:22:23,476 --> 01:22:25,177
<i>No.</i>

959
01:22:25,178 --> 01:22:27,246
<i>In an earlier existence,</i>

960
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:29,915
<i>Veronica Buehler
had been Rupini.</i>

961
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:34,219
<i>I would say, for the vast
majority of the Orientalists,</i>

962
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:39,525
<i>a clear example of
the transmigration of the soul.</i>

963
01:22:39,526 --> 01:22:41,694
<i>And, young man, your opinion?</i>

964
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:43,996
<i>As a neophyte Orientalist,</i>

965
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:46,365
<i>I can only cite some classical
Indian conceptions,</i>

966
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:49,668
<i>from Upanishads
to Gautama Buddha.</i>

967
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:52,671
<i>Excuse me. It is
precisely in the Upanishads</i>

968
01:22:52,672 --> 01:22:55,808
<i>in the Brhadaranyaka
and Chandogya Upanishads</i>

969
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:59,144
<i>that one can find this belief
for the first time.</i>

970
01:22:59,145 --> 01:23:01,013
<i>This is karma, isn't it?</i>

971
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:02,981
But it's hard for me to believe

972
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:04,616
that I ever existed before.

973
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:06,552
How did you say?

974
01:23:06,553 --> 01:23:08,187
Metempsychosis.

975
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:10,656
Metempsychosis.
- Mm-hm.

976
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:12,624
That absolutely
doesn't make sense to me.

977
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:16,428
Maybe...

978
01:23:16,429 --> 01:23:17,996
What?

979
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:20,933
Maybe I was possessed
by an evil spirit.

980
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:22,935
Well...

981
01:23:22,936 --> 01:23:24,536
They never leave us alone.

982
01:23:24,537 --> 01:23:27,473
It's all so confusing.

983
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:29,575
I'm afraid
I'm going crazy.

984
01:23:40,053 --> 01:23:42,888
Hello, Miss Veronica,
just an interview.

985
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:45,257
That's enough. Let's go.

986
01:23:45,258 --> 01:23:46,558
Taxi!

987
01:23:51,364 --> 01:23:53,132
Just drive, drive anywhere.

988
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:33,105
I-- I think
we should get away. I...

989
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:37,743
I think we should go somewhere.
We should be alone.

990
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,545
We should go to, uh,
somewhere beautiful,

991
01:24:39,546 --> 01:24:40,412
a Mediterranean island.

992
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:45,651
Dominic, that would make me
very, very happy.

993
01:25:36,336 --> 01:25:39,004
Look, that bird.

994
01:25:39,005 --> 01:25:41,440
What kind of birds
do they have in Malta?

995
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,042
That's a Maltese falcon.

996
01:26:02,762 --> 01:26:04,463
Welcome.

997
01:26:04,464 --> 01:26:06,699
Thank you.

998
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:14,540
No, that's fine.
Thank you.

999
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:15,908
Thank you.

1000
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:23,515
Thanks very much.

1001
01:26:27,487 --> 01:26:29,254
Finally alone.

1002
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:37,863
Dominic,
it's beautiful here.

1003
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:39,264
Yes, it is.

1004
01:26:49,509 --> 01:26:52,411
When I first opened my eyes
and saw you...

1005
01:26:55,915 --> 01:26:59,151
I confess I was thinking,

1006
01:26:59,152 --> 01:27:03,789
if I were three
or four years older and...

1007
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,794
if he were
to ask me to marry him...

1008
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:14,800
I would say yes.

1009
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:27,880
Veronica.

1010
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:45,397
My love.

1011
01:27:45,398 --> 01:27:47,499
Is it true?

1012
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:57,976
Yes.

1013
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:09,355
I've always loved you.

1014
01:28:38,284 --> 01:28:38,951
Veronica?

1015
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:27,700
Do you understand it?

1016
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:32,004
I don't know this language.

1017
01:29:34,074 --> 01:29:37,876
Ancient... Beyond...

1018
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:39,378
Why else did you have
to know her?

1019
01:30:38,505 --> 01:30:39,738
Veronica?

1020
01:30:44,744 --> 01:30:45,744
Veronica...

1021
01:31:01,995 --> 01:31:03,128
It's all right.

1022
01:31:03,129 --> 01:31:05,197
That's all right.
It's all right.

1023
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:07,900
I've got you.
I've got you.

1024
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:10,169
I've got you, darling.

1025
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:12,938
I've got you, Laura.

1026
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:15,874
It's all right.

1027
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:17,776
I've got you.

1028
01:31:17,777 --> 01:31:20,779
I've got you, darling.
I've got you, Laura.

1029
01:31:24,284 --> 01:31:26,685
I love you, darling.

1030
01:31:26,686 --> 01:31:28,287
I love you.

1031
01:32:33,186 --> 01:32:34,953
Was that Rupini's voice?

1032
01:32:34,954 --> 01:32:37,322
Mm-hm. Yes.

1033
01:32:37,323 --> 01:32:39,491
She's moving back in time

1034
01:32:39,492 --> 01:32:43,195
from Sanskrit
to earlier languages.

1035
01:32:43,196 --> 01:32:44,596
That was Egyptian.

1036
01:32:50,837 --> 01:32:53,539
Perhaps you'll take us back
to a time before history.

1037
01:32:55,742 --> 01:32:57,876
The origins of language,

1038
01:32:57,877 --> 01:33:01,580
which is where I've always
wanted to go, but I never could.

1039
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:04,149
But it's helping me
finish my work.

1040
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,084
Good.

1041
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:09,054
Good. I want to help you.

1042
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:09,822
You know, I'm...

1043
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:15,961
I'm 88 years old, really.

1044
01:33:21,434 --> 01:33:24,403
If I added up all the years
Rupini lived,

1045
01:33:24,404 --> 01:33:25,270
I'd be older than you.

1046
01:33:27,307 --> 01:33:28,073
Well, then let's go dancing.

1047
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,140
Thank you.

1048
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:22,094
I don't think
we'll be recognized,

1049
01:34:22,095 --> 01:34:24,596
even with our pictures
in all those magazines.

1050
01:34:24,597 --> 01:34:28,667
Well, our pictures
are still appearing.

1051
01:34:28,668 --> 01:34:29,802
Let me see.

1052
01:34:48,888 --> 01:34:49,855
What's the matter?

1053
01:34:57,764 --> 01:35:00,699
I feel tired all the time,

1054
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:03,836
and I don't understand why.

1055
01:35:03,837 --> 01:35:08,574
Something is happening
inside me. I can feel it.

1056
01:35:08,575 --> 01:35:10,109
And she's right.

1057
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:13,078
The paramediumistic ecstasies
have exhausted her.

1058
01:35:19,252 --> 01:35:20,753
Champagne?

1059
01:36:58,485 --> 01:36:59,818
Veronica?

1060
01:37:08,128 --> 01:37:09,762
Veronica!

1061
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:33,419
No! Veronica, don't!

1062
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:36,889
Veronica!

1063
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:38,824
I was so worried!

1064
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:42,327
What is it?

1065
01:37:42,328 --> 01:37:44,196
It was a dream.

1066
01:37:44,197 --> 01:37:47,299
A bad dream.

1067
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,735
What was--? What was it?

1068
01:37:52,305 --> 01:37:55,574
I was somewhere beside a river,
and someone,

1069
01:37:55,575 --> 01:37:57,876
a stranger with a head
like a dog,

1070
01:37:57,877 --> 01:37:59,545
was coming toward me.

1071
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:02,281
And in his hand, he--
He had...

1072
01:38:04,818 --> 01:38:06,518
Explain it to me!

1073
01:38:06,519 --> 01:38:09,288
I want to know
what Rupini knows.

1074
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:12,958
She knows things
that we don't understand yet.

1075
01:38:12,959 --> 01:38:14,927
No. Let me--

1076
01:38:14,928 --> 01:38:17,162
No, no!

1077
01:38:17,163 --> 01:38:18,530
Don't ever leave me.

1078
01:38:18,531 --> 01:38:19,832
I'll never leave you.

1079
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:21,934
Don't ever leave me.
I'll never leave you.

1080
01:38:21,935 --> 01:38:24,403
Don't ever leave me.

1081
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:25,471
I'll never leave you.

1082
01:39:11,518 --> 01:39:13,285
Veronica.

1083
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:25,297
The stranger in your dream
was probably Shiva.

1084
01:39:28,234 --> 01:39:30,769
And in his hand, a skull.

1085
01:39:32,906 --> 01:39:37,609
For Shiva is both creator
and destroyer combined.

1086
01:40:32,499 --> 01:40:33,499
Dominic?

1087
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,000
There's someone
who looks like you

1088
01:40:35,001 --> 01:40:37,102
spying on us.

1089
01:40:37,103 --> 01:40:38,404
I didn't notice anyone.

1090
01:40:38,405 --> 01:40:40,139
By the gate.

1091
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,173
Come and look.

1092
01:40:51,518 --> 01:40:52,384
There's no one there.

1093
01:41:01,661 --> 01:41:03,595
Maybe I was mistaken.

1094
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:09,068
You've been in the sun too long.
Let's go inside.

1095
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:35,828
<i>I'm 88 years old, really.</i>

1096
01:42:22,175 --> 01:42:24,810
She's in a
hyper-suggestive state.

1097
01:42:26,613 --> 01:42:27,813
Tell her you love her.

1098
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:31,617
Tell her that you've
always loved her.

1099
01:42:35,121 --> 01:42:36,522
I love you.

1100
01:42:39,159 --> 01:42:41,093
I've always loved you.

1101
01:42:53,373 --> 01:42:54,573
That's Sumerian.

1102
01:43:04,517 --> 01:43:06,018
No, it's Babylonian.

1103
01:43:21,835 --> 01:43:24,436
<i>After Egyptian and Babylonian,</i>

1104
01:43:24,437 --> 01:43:27,239
there followed probably
a sample of proto-Elamite

1105
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,575
and one of Sumerian.

1106
01:43:29,576 --> 01:43:32,945
She is descending
deeper and deeper

1107
01:43:32,946 --> 01:43:34,279
into the past.

1108
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,582
But how far back will she go?

1109
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:39,818
Your life's work will
finally have what was missing.

1110
01:43:42,255 --> 01:43:44,289
<i>Every night for two weeks,</i>

1111
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:47,860
<i>Veronica went
further back in time.</i>

1112
01:43:47,861 --> 01:43:49,661
<i>Through unknown languages...</i>

1113
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,235
<i>unwritten history.</i>

1114
01:44:07,347 --> 01:44:09,715
<i>Getting closer...</i>

1115
01:44:09,716 --> 01:44:11,250
<i>and closer...</i>

1116
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:15,587
to the inarticulate moment...

1117
01:44:15,588 --> 01:44:17,289
of the beginning.

1118
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,935
<i>But at what cost?</i>

1119
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:33,505
<i>Madam is not suffering</i>

1120
01:44:33,506 --> 01:44:35,607
from anything,
anything at all.

1121
01:44:35,608 --> 01:44:36,909
Are you sure, doctor?

1122
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:39,845
Yes. I've prescribed
a series of shots

1123
01:44:39,846 --> 01:44:42,514
with vitamins and minerals.

1124
01:44:42,515 --> 01:44:44,550
Perhaps it's...

1125
01:44:44,551 --> 01:44:47,186
the nervous condition

1126
01:44:47,187 --> 01:44:49,722
that precedes menopause

1127
01:44:49,723 --> 01:44:52,091
in certain women.

1128
01:44:52,092 --> 01:44:55,694
Well, just how old do you
take her to be, doctor?

1129
01:44:55,695 --> 01:44:57,996
Late 40s, more or less.

1130
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:00,766
She's 25.

1131
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:22,388
Where have all
the mirrors gone?

1132
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:32,698
Bring one to me.

1133
01:45:34,367 --> 01:45:36,669
Veronica, you're not well.

1134
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:40,639
Bring a mirror to me,
Dominic, please.

1135
01:45:44,144 --> 01:45:44,943
Maybe that one.

1136
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:09,528
I should have understood this
from the beginning.

1137
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:11,030
One more regression,

1138
01:47:11,031 --> 01:47:13,198
she'll reach
the protolanguage.

1139
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,434
Your life's work
will be complete.

1140
01:47:17,971 --> 01:47:19,438
You know I'm right.

1141
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:39,525
Dominic?

1142
01:47:42,462 --> 01:47:43,762
Dominic?

1143
01:47:50,904 --> 01:47:52,171
Look.

1144
01:47:58,378 --> 01:47:59,978
Come sit with me.

1145
01:48:03,116 --> 01:48:03,816
Come sit with me.

1146
01:48:10,256 --> 01:48:11,523
Veronica.

1147
01:48:11,524 --> 01:48:13,492
Veronica, I'm to blame for this.
No, it's me.

1148
01:48:13,493 --> 01:48:15,494
Listen to me. Listen to me
and don't interrupt.

1149
01:48:15,495 --> 01:48:18,097
Please, listen.

1150
01:48:18,098 --> 01:48:19,198
Listen to me.

1151
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,934
If I continue to live with you,

1152
01:48:21,935 --> 01:48:23,602
by autumn
you will have perished.

1153
01:48:23,603 --> 01:48:25,137
I can't tell you more.

1154
01:48:25,138 --> 01:48:27,539
But I assure you,

1155
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,509
in reality, you haven't aged.

1156
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:32,177
The moment I disappear
from your life,

1157
01:48:32,178 --> 01:48:34,013
your youth and your beauty
will return.

1158
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:38,083
Don't leave me, Dominic.
Please, don't leave me.

1159
01:48:38,084 --> 01:48:40,252
I was doomed to lose everything
that I love.

1160
01:48:40,253 --> 01:48:42,855
But I'd rather lose you young
and beautiful, the way you were,

1161
01:48:42,856 --> 01:48:46,992
the way you will be again
without me,

1162
01:48:46,993 --> 01:48:48,660
than to watch you perish
in my arms.

1163
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:52,631
You promised me
you would never leave me.

1164
01:48:52,632 --> 01:48:57,002
I am going to leave you.

1165
01:48:57,003 --> 01:49:01,006
If you leave me,
I will die without you.

1166
01:49:01,007 --> 01:49:02,474
If in a few months,

1167
01:49:02,475 --> 01:49:05,444
you don't find yourself
as you were last autumn,

1168
01:49:05,445 --> 01:49:06,712
I'll come back.

1169
01:49:06,713 --> 01:49:09,381
The minute I receive
your telegram, I'll come back.

1170
01:49:09,382 --> 01:49:11,884
Three or four months,
just wait--

1171
01:49:17,457 --> 01:49:18,390
Somewhere...

1172
01:49:21,127 --> 01:49:22,895
far away from me.

1173
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,202
Don't leave me.
Please. Please.

1174
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:05,537
Dominic.

1175
01:50:05,538 --> 01:50:06,438
Dominic.

1176
01:50:29,095 --> 01:50:30,496
<i>WOMAN
The 3:10 train</i>

1177
01:50:30,497 --> 01:50:33,565
<i>from Bucuresti to Iasi
will depart in five minutes.</i>

1178
01:50:36,369 --> 01:50:38,237
<i>The 3:10 train
from Bucuresti to Iasi</i>

1179
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:39,872
<i>will depart in five minutes.</i>

1180
01:50:57,557 --> 01:50:58,590
Good evening.

1181
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:01,894
Audricourt.

1182
01:51:01,895 --> 01:51:03,595
Sign here, please.

1183
01:51:03,596 --> 01:51:04,897
Thank you.

1184
01:51:08,568 --> 01:51:10,636
On the second floor, Room 19.

1185
01:51:10,637 --> 01:51:11,637
Thank you.

1186
01:51:11,638 --> 01:51:13,005
By the way,

1187
01:51:13,006 --> 01:51:14,973
do you know if the Café Select
still exists?

1188
01:51:14,974 --> 01:51:17,409
How could it not exist?
It's an historic monument.

1189
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:19,011
Of course.

1190
01:51:19,012 --> 01:51:22,648
Have you heard
of Professor Dominic Matei?

1191
01:51:22,649 --> 01:51:24,249
You know,
I was born here.

1192
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:27,052
Then you know that
he frequented Café Select

1193
01:51:27,053 --> 01:51:30,656
the whole time he was
professor here in Piatra Neamt.

1194
01:51:30,657 --> 01:51:31,657
That's right.

1195
01:51:31,658 --> 01:51:33,726
Here's your key.

1196
01:51:34,728 --> 01:51:36,428
Nineteen?

1197
01:51:36,429 --> 01:51:37,529
The second floor.

1198
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:38,664
All right.

1199
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:42,134
Welcome home.

1200
01:51:49,342 --> 01:51:50,976
Café Select.

1201
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:31,350
<i>Maman.</i>

1202
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:34,687
<i>Maman.</i>

1203
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:36,422
<i>Maman.</i>

1204
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:40,225
<i>Maman.</i>

1205
01:53:06,086 --> 01:53:08,520
"Good and
evil lose their meaning,

1206
01:53:08,521 --> 01:53:10,289
"and in the absolute

1207
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:14,126
being coincides
with nonbeing."

1208
01:53:14,127 --> 01:53:15,494
Yes, but what no one dares
to say

1209
01:53:15,495 --> 01:53:17,596
is that in the horizon
of these philosophies,

1210
01:53:17,597 --> 01:53:18,697
atomic wars must be,

1211
01:53:18,698 --> 01:53:20,199
if not justified,
at least accepted.

1212
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,900
No, I reject that.

1213
01:53:21,901 --> 01:53:24,403
True meaning of nuclear
catastrophe can only be this:

1214
01:53:24,404 --> 01:53:26,572
The mutation
of the human species,

1215
01:53:26,573 --> 01:53:28,040
and the arrival
of the new man.

1216
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:29,174
Yes, but atomic wars

1217
01:53:29,175 --> 01:53:32,511
will destroy populations,
civilizations.

1218
01:53:32,512 --> 01:53:35,114
That is the price to be paid.

1219
01:53:35,115 --> 01:53:37,249
How can you even say that?

1220
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,918
The resulting electromagnetic
pulse will create

1221
01:53:39,919 --> 01:53:42,154
an unlimited potential
for post-historic man.

1222
01:53:42,155 --> 01:53:43,922
Yes, but it could go
the other way

1223
01:53:43,923 --> 01:53:45,791
and provoke a regression
in the species.

1224
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:48,027
All that matters is knowledge

1225
01:53:48,028 --> 01:53:49,962
and the perfection
of the human being.

1226
01:53:49,963 --> 01:53:53,532
So you're saying that the end
justifies the means?

1227
01:53:53,533 --> 01:53:56,235
There is no other way.

1228
01:53:56,236 --> 01:53:58,537
Just as there was no other way
for Veronica, just aging

1229
01:53:58,538 --> 01:54:00,072
and suffering and then death.

1230
01:54:00,073 --> 01:54:02,107
There was no other way.

1231
01:54:02,108 --> 01:54:04,209
That's why you've never
finished your book,

1232
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:06,211
why you'll always be a failure.

1233
01:54:06,212 --> 01:54:07,079
No.

1234
01:54:10,483 --> 01:54:12,518
Dominic, what have you done?

1235
01:54:14,054 --> 01:54:15,154
Oh, Dominic.

1236
01:54:15,155 --> 01:54:18,157
Save me.
Save me, Dominic.

1237
01:54:20,527 --> 01:54:22,261
Dominic, what have you done?

1238
01:54:22,262 --> 01:54:23,595
What have you done?

1239
01:55:57,891 --> 01:55:59,925
And the third rose?

1240
01:56:05,765 --> 01:56:08,367
Where shall
I put the third rose?

1241
01:56:11,905 --> 01:56:13,972
Oh, where shall I put it?

1242
01:57:39,793 --> 01:57:41,393
Dominic?

1243
01:57:44,597 --> 01:57:45,898
Dominic Matei?

1244
01:57:48,735 --> 01:57:52,371
<i>Cuconul Dominic Matei?</i>

1245
01:57:55,375 --> 01:57:57,376
Is it you?

1246
01:58:02,315 --> 01:58:04,149
Praise God,

1247
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:06,518
you've returned.

1248
01:58:06,519 --> 01:58:09,621
Dr. Neculache, look.
He's back.

1249
01:58:11,825 --> 01:58:15,394
<i>Cuconul Dominic is here.</i>

1250
01:58:15,395 --> 01:58:16,628
<i>In other words,</i>

1251
01:58:16,629 --> 01:58:18,897
<i>the story begins
all over again.</i>

1252
01:58:18,898 --> 01:58:20,799
Old friend.

1253
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,167
Dominic?

1254
01:58:22,168 --> 01:58:23,902
Look, it's you.
- I'm dreaming.

1255
01:58:23,903 --> 01:58:25,604
I am dreaming.

1256
01:58:25,605 --> 01:58:26,905
When I wake up,

1257
01:58:26,906 --> 01:58:30,809
it will seem like
I've just begun to dream indeed.

1258
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:32,344
It's like, uh,

1259
01:58:32,345 --> 01:58:36,515
the story of Chuang-tzu
and the butterfly.

1260
01:58:36,516 --> 01:58:39,018
The story of Chuang-tzu
and the butterfly?

1261
01:58:39,019 --> 01:58:39,818
Yes.

1262
01:58:42,088 --> 01:58:46,125
A king who was dreaming
that he was a butterfly

1263
01:58:46,126 --> 01:58:48,360
that dreamed he was a king,

1264
01:58:48,361 --> 01:58:50,229
who was dreaming
he was a butterfly.

1265
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:52,998
I know very well
that I'm--

1266
01:58:52,999 --> 01:58:54,266
I'm dreaming,

1267
01:58:54,267 --> 01:58:57,336
and in a minute or two
I will wake up.

1268
01:58:57,337 --> 01:59:00,005
<i>You are awake, Cucoane Dominic,</i>

1269
01:59:00,006 --> 01:59:01,540
but you are tired.

1270
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:04,410
In fact, you look very tired.

1271
01:59:04,411 --> 01:59:05,411
All right.

1272
01:59:05,412 --> 01:59:09,148
Between December the 20th, 1938,

1273
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:11,250
and this evening,
many things have happened.

1274
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:14,153
<i>That is when it is happening,
Cucoane Dominic.</i>

1275
01:59:14,154 --> 01:59:16,822
This is December 20th, 1938.

1276
01:59:16,823 --> 01:59:19,058
I don't dare tell you

1277
01:59:19,059 --> 01:59:21,060
what year we are
really living in,

1278
01:59:21,061 --> 01:59:24,196
we who are outside this dream.

1279
01:59:24,197 --> 01:59:27,499
I know that if I were to make
the effort, I would wake up.

1280
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,868
<i>You are not dreaming,
Coane Dominic.</i>

1281
01:59:29,869 --> 01:59:32,171
You're here with us,
your friends.

1282
01:59:32,172 --> 01:59:34,340
You're at the Café Select.

1283
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:37,009
This is what we imagined
would happen.

1284
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:39,678
<i>When Conul Dominic
comes to his senses,</i>

1285
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:43,415
when he recovers,
you'll see.

1286
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:45,851
He'll go straight
to the Café Select.

1287
01:59:47,354 --> 01:59:48,721
But if I'm not dreaming,

1288
01:59:48,722 --> 01:59:51,757
then you'd know about...

1289
01:59:51,758 --> 01:59:53,959
Hiroshima.

1290
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,261
Of the hydrogen bomb,

1291
01:59:56,262 --> 01:59:57,563
of Neil Armstrong,

1292
01:59:57,564 --> 02:00:01,333
the astronaut who landed

1293
02:00:01,334 --> 02:00:02,835
and walked on the moon...

1294
02:00:03,903 --> 02:00:05,037
...last summer in July.

1295
02:00:06,873 --> 02:00:08,374
Dominic!

1296
02:00:09,843 --> 02:00:12,011
Dominic, it's true.

1297
02:00:12,012 --> 02:00:15,214
You've come back.

1298
02:00:15,215 --> 02:00:17,282
Welcome.

1299
02:00:27,427 --> 02:00:29,028
You look good.

1300
02:00:29,029 --> 02:00:32,231
Welcome, old friend.

1301
02:00:32,232 --> 02:00:36,301
It's like that story of, uh,
the Chinese philosopher,

1302
02:00:36,302 --> 02:00:38,604
you know, the one
I've told you about many times.

1303
02:00:38,605 --> 02:00:40,205
Which Chinese philosopher?

1304
02:00:40,206 --> 02:00:43,776
The name escapes me now.

1305
02:00:43,777 --> 02:00:45,511
The one with the butterfly.

1306
02:00:49,115 --> 02:00:51,050
Well, it's too long to repeat.

1307
02:00:51,051 --> 02:00:53,786
I'll call for a sleigh
to take you home.

1308
02:00:53,787 --> 02:00:55,387
I don't need a sleigh.

1309
02:00:57,357 --> 02:00:58,891
I'm going on foot.

1310
02:01:02,529 --> 02:01:06,231
The next time
the problem arises,

1311
02:01:06,232 --> 02:01:07,266
I shall know how to answer.

1312
02:01:10,136 --> 02:01:12,438
What problem, dear Dominic?

1313
02:01:18,311 --> 02:01:21,413
The problem which worries
all of us.

1314
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:27,720
Dominic?

1315
02:01:27,721 --> 02:01:29,521
Is it your teeth?

1316
02:01:29,522 --> 02:01:31,490
Is it your teeth? Dominic?

1317
02:01:48,742 --> 02:01:50,943
Should I lock up
the door?

1318
02:01:50,944 --> 02:01:53,412
The guest in Room 19
hasn't come back yet.

1319
02:01:53,413 --> 02:01:55,047
He went to the Café Select.

1320
02:01:55,048 --> 02:01:56,315
I'll call.

1321
02:01:59,386 --> 02:02:01,820
Yes, he came here.

1322
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:03,822
He went into the backroom.

1323
02:02:03,823 --> 02:02:05,524
Uh, no one was there,

1324
02:02:05,525 --> 02:02:07,292
so he stayed only
a few minutes

1325
02:02:07,293 --> 02:02:09,661
and left without
saying good night.

1326
02:02:09,662 --> 02:02:12,297
He was, uh, holding
his hand to his mouth.

1327
02:03:26,506 --> 02:03:28,140
<i>And the third?</i>

1328
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:32,177
<i>Where do you want me to put</i>

1329
02:03:32,178 --> 02:03:34,813
<i>the third rose?</i>

1330
02:04:34,814 --> 02:04:35,814
