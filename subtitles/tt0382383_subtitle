1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Listen to me carefully,
never bend so much...

2
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,300
...for a woman that she
tramples all over you.

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,800
Someone's with him.

4
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
What was that big commotion
at your house, today?

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Were you scolding your
uncle or was he...?

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,800
We had a fight.
- Why?

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,100
He wants me to get married.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Which one am I? Am I your
42nd or 42 and a half?

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Pack your bags and move in with me.

10
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
Where will I stay?

11
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
In Tara and Joe's room
or aunt Leela's room?

12
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
In my room.
- Before marriage?

13
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
He stopped.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,700
Meera, please, listen to me.

15
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Let's go.

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Stop!

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I need a lift, please
follow that taXi.

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Please, boss, hurry up!

19
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Sleep with them, screw them...

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,100
...but never live with them.

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,100
For shots, why try to own the bar?

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Quickly, please, my
love story may end.

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
RelaX. I'll get you there.

24
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Hey, wait! Meera!

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
What is he doing?

26
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Come on follow him.

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Can't live with them. Can't
live without them.

28
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
I can't understand a
word you are saying.

29
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Aren't you scared?

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,100
I Want to hold your hand
and see the Niagra Falls

31
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,200
We'll have two daughters,
Just like you.

32
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Tonsure their heads in Pittsburg
BalaJi Temple.

33
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Tell me one thing, should
I overtake or follow?

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Overtake them!

35
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Since, how many days do you know?

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,400
We've hardly met, and you
talk of kids already?

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I love you...
- So what can I do?

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Tell me should I keep
her or dump her.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Bastard is making us run.

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Think about it.

41
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Stop!
- Want to get us killed? - Stop!

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Finished.

43
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Your bail order has arrived.
Come, sir is calling you.

44
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
This way!

45
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,300
Your clothes, ring and
chain. Check it.

46
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,100
And this is your Rs. 40.75.
- 25 paise is less.

47
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
What Jailor!

48
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Living with thieves like us you have
lost your sense of humour?

49
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes! And this Rs. 180/-
for the chair frame you made.

50
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,700
Keep it!

51
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Get a new bucket for ward B.

52
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Arse gets dry before the
bucket gets filled.

53
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll leave...?
- Sign here, take this.

54
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Free air. Take a deep breath. EnJoy!

55
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,300
Same air inside only it was
miXed with prisoners' farts.

56
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,900
How's everything? - Fine!
C'mon sit! Let's go!

57
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Bastard! Stop fooling around.

58
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,900
Bengal chicks are like
spicy mutton...

59
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Lallan, you know
Gopal bailed you out?

60
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,300
There's something in
the Hoogly water.

61
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,800
He has called you at his home.
- First I need to settle something.

62
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
You're making the same mistake
again and again...

63
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
How long are you going to suffer?

64
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,300
She wont come.

65
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Are you listening?

66
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,900
Stop this or I call the police...

67
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,700
Can't follow Hindi?
Shall I use Bengali?

68
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,600
You dumb green shirt, shut up!
This is my family matter...

69
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,200
...or I'll miX some red in your
green and it'll turn yellow

70
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Try to understand.

71
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Do you understand this pain?
Or shall I break your arm?

72
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,300
Your father will never look at
you again if you go with him.

73
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
Spare me! - Shut up!

74
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,700
Come out, Sashi...

75
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,300
She'll not come.

76
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Leave her! Shashi, get in! Go!

77
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll never see your face...

78
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
Stop it. Goddess Durga is going
outside... - She knows everything...

79
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
You know nothing...

80
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Stop cutting your teeth in me.
- Teeth can't be cut.

81
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
I Want to tell you something.
- Tell me...

82
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,600
Listen Dad has arranged a Job
for you. Will you do it?

83
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,800
I will.
- First promise me.

84
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,700
Leave my hand. - Promise?
- I swear on you.

85
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
You're NilanJan's son-in-law?

86
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
He's my father-in-law.

87
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
But that makes you
his son in law no?

88
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,700
Hey check that.

89
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
What's my Job?
- To stand at the gate...

90
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Reams of paper come
from the docks...

91
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Papers must come in
with a gate pass.

92
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
You mean authorization?

93
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Without a gate pass nothing
moves in or out.

94
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,900
My salary?
- Rs.2000/ - per month.

95
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,300
Rs.10/-per hour overtime.

96
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
After siX months, Salary
may increase.

97
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
What is the total value
of these machines?

98
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
What?

99
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,200
I need to protect them no?
I must know their value.

100
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,600
Your Job is at the door. I'll
take care of the rest.

101
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,700
Not asking for your Job.

102
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,600
That machine alone costs 2 crores.

103
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Rest, you can estimate.

104
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
If something gets stolen
when I am off duty...

105
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,700
What is this nonsense?

106
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,100
Not nonsense. Just imagine that
your press catches fire...

107
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Who will try to burn this place?
- Whoever, say the fire god...

108
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,600
Why him, even I could do it?

109
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Sir, it's me, Sheshadri!

110
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,800
NilanJan's man is
not a straight guy.

111
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,100
He talks too much...

112
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
I'll tell him...

113
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Take this.

114
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,000
Hello! Yes, sir...

115
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,700
No, you listen to
me first. You'll pay me Rs. 2000/...

116
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,000
...to take care of machines
worth crores. Is that fair?

117
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Listen! We are already doing a
favor by giving you this Job.

118
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
And now you are teaching us.

119
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100
You are right! If something happens
tomorrow, don't blame me.

120
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Threatening me?
- I'm not threatening you.

121
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,000
Just saying I can guarantee
their safety.

122
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,100
Take care of me. I'll take
care of your press.

123
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,000
If not it's O.K. May evil eyes
be warded off your press.

124
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Call him to my office.

125
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Meenakshi, you're wanted inside.

126
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
Come, come.

127
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You promised.

128
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,800
What?
- That you'll take up a Job.

129
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,700
He was giving you a Job only
because you're my son-in-law.

130
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
And you tried to eXtort from him?

131
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Seen that property?

132
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,800
EXpects me to guard property
worth 2 crores for Rs.2000/-

133
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,200
No way! Lallan Singh doesn't
come so cheap.

134
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,300
Whose turn is it? - Then
you'll eXtort money.

135
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Tell him, Ravi! - I...

136
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
You lied. Said you will
give up rowdism.

137
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
This is not rowdism, darling.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Gopal is here.

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,100
You're not going. - How can
I if she doesn't want me to?

140
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,600
Stop Joking. He's waiting
for you. He's very angry.

141
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Hoodibaaba!

142
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Tell him, Lallan. Won't come.

143
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
He doesn't want to become
a thug like Gopal.

144
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,600
What's the Job?
- You're not going.

145
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,700
Important work.
- What's in it for me? - Lots.

146
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm saying no.
- So don't say it for a while...

147
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
You're not going anywhere.
I won't let you.

148
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,000
Go away Ghoshal. Lallan's
not coming.

149
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Who bailed you out?

150
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,700
I'll go now...
- Sit.

151
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Know the trouble I went
to to bail you out?

152
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,800
You didn't do it because
of any affection for me.

153
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,000
Someone must have got you by the
balls you remembered me.

154
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Why? Isn't it.

155
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Is this the way to talk
to your elder brother.

156
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Is he is my brother? While running
away to Kolkatta, this brother of

157
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,600
...mine abandoned me with a
piece of bread in my hand.

158
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,700
It took me ten years to find him.
He calls himself my big brother.

159
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Sit big brother...
- I'm not here to sit...

160
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
You want to lie down?
Shall I put a cot?

161
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Do you wish to become something
in life or keep playing cards?

162
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
But I'm playing...

163
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Panchayat Elections are approaching.

164
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
Ten days left to file
the nominations.

165
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
So? Want me to reduce four days?

166
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
We won't let anyone contest.

167
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,300
But some college kids are
instigating the villagers.

168
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
You need to get crowds
for the rallies.

169
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,700
Take them in lorries
give them 50 rupees...

170
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,700
...and a packet of Biryani.

171
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
Ascertain there is no problem.

172
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,800
Their leader Michael,
BarthwaJ, Trilok.

173
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,900
And many more boys are there.

174
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Want to hit them or kill them?

175
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Lallan is not going
to do any of these.

176
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Lallan tell them to leave.

177
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
A woman is wearing the
'langot' in this house.

178
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Get out. Lallan won't go.

179
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Don't interrupt.

180
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Lallan, do one thing, wear a sari.
I'll gift you the petticoat.

181
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,000
You'll not indulge in rowdyism.

182
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I told you not to butt in.

183
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I won't allow you to go.

184
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,200
I'll die before I let you go.

185
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,700
Shut up!

186
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Are you threatening me?

187
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm pleading with you.

188
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Just a minute! I can't
bear such scenes.

189
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
See me after you're done with her.

190
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm going. Let's go, Vishal.

191
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,600
Don't go to him.

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,100
She's telling you for your good.

193
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,600
This is why I obJected.
He's a beast.

194
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I shouldn't have come.

195
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm leaving.
- So go.

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Go and never return back to me.

197
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,300
I won't die without you.

198
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,600
Because I had the balls I'm
alive and kicking today.

199
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,900
Screw your dream world.

200
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
All that I own I've
snatched or stolen.

201
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Got beaten, gone to Jail.

202
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,100
I don't need anyone.

203
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
A tenth class pass and thinks
she's a great lady.

204
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Come to change me.

205
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,700
You'll die a dog's death.
Crows will feast on you.

206
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Come... get up.

207
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
What is it? Where's Sashi? - Why...?

208
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,700
Where's Sashi...?
- Leave him alone...

209
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,000
He's such a scoundrel.

210
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,900
Beats his pregnant wife in
the middle of the street.

211
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Leave it. This is common
with married couples.

212
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't interfere. Shut up.
How can a husband beat

213
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,200
...his wife so brutally?

214
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,500
Today he beats her, Tomorrow you'll
beat me. That's why you support him.

215
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,800
Why are you saying so?
- All men are the same.

216
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Women are no less.

217
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,500
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
Which month?
- Third.

219
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,600
Who's the father? Just Joking.
C'mon, smile.

220
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:01,100
I want a daughter like you.
Cat eyes, teeth.

221
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
'Bitter at times or sweet as honey.'

222
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
'Soft at times or rugged.'

223
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,100
...'is my lovable man! '

224
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,900
'His love lorn looks
pierce my heart.'

225
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
'My heart blushes with coy.'

226
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:20,600
'Your recluse heart is
imprisoned within me.'

227
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,300
'Oh! God may my husband's name
and fame live forever.'

228
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:39,300
'Lf his honour is at stake'...

229
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
...'I'll die in shame.'

230
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,000
'Coyish blush makes the
pink face glossy.'

231
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
IntoXicates me.'

232
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,800
'Curls of hair bloom in the air.'

233
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,100
'Celestial Gods witness our love.'

234
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,100
'I will die in shame.'

235
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Come, come. Pining away for us?

236
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
My hands are itching

237
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Come... come.

238
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Is everything ready? - Ready.

239
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,800
Cold drinks, mineral water And
biscuits. - Put it in our account.

240
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,300
No more credit. - Who are you?

241
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,200
His grandpa!
- What's this hooliganism?

242
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Hello sir? There's a riot here.

243
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Kids from Presidency College.

244
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Come quickly.

245
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,200
Tell me! Why ignore your studies
and enter gutters of politics?

246
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Gopal dada is pissed off with you.

247
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Study. Give eXams. Become a big man.

248
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Why politics?

249
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Which hand do you write with?

250
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,500
Tell me! Move it.

251
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Brothers have arrived.

252
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Why us? What have we done?

253
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Lallan speaking. Hear me?

254
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,900
Stalwarts like Tagore, RaJaram
Mohan Roy, Subhash Chandra Bose...

255
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
...attained enlightenment in Bengal.

256
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
From all over India, people
came to Kolkatta.

257
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,100
From Sharad Chandra
to SatyaJit Ray...

258
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,500
...from Saurav Ganguly
to Sushmita Sen...

259
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,400
...all have done Bengal proud.

260
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,800
But even then Bengal is ignored
by the rest of the states.

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,800
Only because we're not
ruling at the Centre...

262
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,100
Bengalis are unique.

263
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
This is great!

264
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,800
Hail Bangla!

265
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Long live, SanJeet Babu!

266
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
C'mon clap!

267
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Who is Lallan?

268
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,200
Hey, Lallan, come here!
He's my brother!

269
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,200
He did all these arrangements.
- Bring him with you.

270
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Do you dislike me or my party?
Tell me honestly.

271
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,800
What happened? Did he do something
wrong? What did you do?

272
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,800
Let me brief you, what does
he do out side the college.

273
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,900
See? How did he react?

274
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,200
He bashed up students
outside that college.

275
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You didn't spare even the girls.

276
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
Am I right? - Yes!

277
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,700
Who told you to beat them?
Are you mad?

278
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,700
Not only this, there's more.
He met the Inspector,

279
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,100
...used my name got
the boys arrested.

280
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,100
All sons of V.I. Ps.

281
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You are out of your mind.
Are you crazy?

282
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,100
All this is my fault. Shouldn't
have bailed out the beast.

283
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,200
Finished? Now let me talk.
- Shut up.

284
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,900
Didn't your rally happen smoothly?
- Shut up.

285
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Didn't the students cock up in fear?

286
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,900
Didn't see a single damn black flag.

287
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,000
What did I tell you? - What? - To
take care if there's any trouble.

288
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Did anything happen? - Then what
was the need to bash them?

289
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
It is because I bashed
them they kept mum.

290
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,700
If I hadn't then there would
have been a commotion...

291
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
...and you would've
been left holding it.

292
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Who will answer the opposition
at the assembly? You?

293
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,000
Sure. Tomorrow when I get
to the assembly like you, I will.

294
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Let's see if anyone has the
balls to question after that.

295
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:48,100
You'll survive. I like him.
Take care of him.

296
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,000
Does Gopal take good care of you?

297
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Give him a share in your
neXt L.P. G Licence.

298
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,900
When I was his age, I
was eXactly like this.

299
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,300
No more hooliganism. I'll
become a businessman now.

300
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,700
I'll be a well-dressed business man.

301
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
What business? Bashing people?

302
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Why are you giggling?
- It is a laughing matter...

303
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
You wait!

304
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
He's lost it.

305
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,600
What happened? Snake
got your tongues?

306
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,600
Where's Gopal? What happened?

307
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,500
What happened?

308
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes, brother! No. Lallan speaking.

309
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
No physical inJuries
a little shaken up.

310
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Can't tell if his brain's working.

311
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
He'll be on holiday for a while.

312
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,600
He's not capable of much right
now. I'll take care.

313
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,700
Who? Michael? I know. Done.

314
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,700
Ok... I'll keep the phone.

315
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Thought of a name for the baby?
- What a time to ask.

316
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,500
Think hard and give it
a good one. Understood?

317
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
How does Dumbo sound?
- I'll break your teeth.

318
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,000
My son will not be like me.
- But you wanted a girl.

319
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,700
Whatever. It's your duty
to bring it up well.

320
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
He shouldn't roam the streets
like a dog like me.

321
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,800
He'll be born a prince
and live like a king.

322
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Never scold him.

323
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Not even if he cries
the whole night...

324
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,100
...keeps you awake wets the bed
- No!

325
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
If he shits on you, then?

326
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Where are you going?
- Delhi. To meet the Prime Minister

327
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,900
Coming?

328
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:53,600
Dumbo! Dumbo Ram!

329
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Dumbo Singh, sounds good.

330
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What is this?
- What?

331
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,800
Where did you get this?

332
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Who gave it to you?

333
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,000
Give it. It doesn't look
good in your hands.

334
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,600
Big, big eyes, Sari, a gun,
you look scary.

335
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,100
What is it doing in the flour can?

336
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,500
Stop fooling around. It will go off.

337
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,900
Is this your gas agency business?

338
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You won't understand. Give it to me.

339
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,800
Why did you bring this here?

340
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,100
What'll you do by knowing this?
- I want to know.

341
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,500
Don't play bandit queen (Phoolan).
- Did Gopal give it to you?

342
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,900
Now he wants you to murder. This
was the only thing left to do

343
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
Are you giving it to me or shall
I slap you and take it?

344
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
I won't. I'll die before
I give it to you.

345
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,100
I'll not allow you to kill anyone.

346
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Another scene, like this
and I'll bury you alive.

347
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,000
I'll do whatever I want.
No one can stop me.

348
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Listen to me carefully.

349
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Never bend so much for a woman
that she tramples all over you.

350
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
There's someone with him.

351
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Are you sure he's our guy?

352
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,700
Useless females. They are bad news...

353
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
...especially the educated ones.

354
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Neither are they happy nor
do they let us be happy.

355
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He's stopping.

356
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
What' is he doing?

357
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Follow him, stay right.

358
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,500
Sleep with them, screw them
but never live with them.

359
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,100
For shots, why try to own the bar?

360
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The bugger is turning around.

361
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,900
Tell me. Should I live with
Sashi or leave her?

362
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,500
Keep an eye outside. There's
a Police van behind.

363
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
But they are an addiction.

364
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Can't live with them. Can't
live without them.

365
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
What are you blabbering? I
can't understand a word.

366
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,600
Are you scared.

367
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,800
Yeah, if I think about
it. So I don't.

368
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,800
Tell me one thing, should
I overtake or follow him?

369
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Overtake.

370
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
You didn't answer. Should
I keep her or leave her.

371
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,900
Bastard. He is getting away.
- Alright. Think and tell me.

372
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
The man in the white shirt in
the middle, who's eating Pizza.

373
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Close all eXits.

374
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,500
I am scared.
- Don't panic. Just guard my back.

375
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
I should have gone to the eXit.

376
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,600
Badal... Aren't you PrasanJeet's
nephew?

377
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
So you think you can come to the
hostel and beat up the students?

378
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,500
Uncle said that College students are
not wanted in a Panchayat election.

379
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Tell your uncle that for
so many years he has...

380
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
...brought his politics
into the college

381
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Now students will enter politics...

382
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
...and we'll also break
hands and legs.

383
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,900
You hit one of us, we will
hit, five of yours.

384
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,500
Happy? You could have
lost your eyesight.

385
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It is unlucky to see
in a mirror at night.

386
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,100
A shot of A.T. S and Penicillin
and I'll be totally ok.

387
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,900
Let him eat. He hasn't
eaten in two days.

388
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Glve me that curry. Did you make it?

389
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,500
I've waited everyday for
your father for years.

390
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,100
Didn't know if he would come
home alive, hurt or dead.

391
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I thought all that had ended.

392
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:46,000
Don't talk ill of dad, mom.
He worked for the society.

393
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
But he did nothing for his home.

394
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,400
It's your cooking, that's
made us all this way.

395
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
How many more sleepless nights
do I have to spend...

396
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
...worrying whether I have to go to
a police station or a hospital?

397
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,900
How many more times are you
going to ask me the same question?

398
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
But it has had no effect on you.

399
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You won't let me rest in
peace even in my old age.

400
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,100
Don't blackmail me. Nothing's
wrong with you.

401
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,900
A shot of insulin, a
sugar free diet...

402
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,100
...and you'll live for years.

403
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,900
You should be proud of him.
Five more people like him...

404
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
...and Kolkatta would've
been perfect.

405
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't want a hero. I want
a normal son like the others.

406
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,700
Social service, patriotism have
all ended with your father.

407
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,500
Not ended, Just started.

408
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Hey! What are you doing here?

409
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,900
Came to receive a Physics Professor.

410
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
How's your mom? Giving
her insulin regularly?

411
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,700
Yes. Just gave her a shot
of units of human miXture.

412
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,000
She should avoid chocolates.
That's her only problem.

413
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,100
He keeps advising the world,
but hogs Sandesh and boozes.

414
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
The other day I found cigarettes
under his pillow.

415
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,900
Why talk about all that here?

416
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Aunty! - My child, come here!

417
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Mike, come here.

418
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,800
Remember Radhika?

419
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
She's back after completing her M.A.

420
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Last time I met you,
you had braces...

421
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,900
Now they're gone.
- I can see that. Bye.

422
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,100
Why were you so rude to him?

423
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,900
I wasn't. Are you still
stitching him up?

424
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,900
Atleast twice a month.

425
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,600
You keep quiet! Do you know
what he puts Leela through?

426
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,100
Where am I denying that? Can
I ever argue with you?

427
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,800
Your aunt rules at home.
I've no value there.

428
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,200
You are number one, T.V. Comes
second, dog is third and I...

429
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,900
I've forgotten my watch.
I'll be right back.

430
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Come soon.

431
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Did you miss me?

432
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,900
I missed you a lot.
I must go. Shall I?

433
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,500
Go.

434
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Tomorrow. 4 P.M.

435
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,800
I knew this would happen.

436
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,900
Good. We needn't take
the Physics eXam.

437
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,200
Continue this way and
you'll be rusticated.

438
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Instead of studying you'll
are into politics?

439
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,000
Idealism will get you nowhere.
You'll lose terribly.

440
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,700
Your parents struggle to educate
you. And you'll...

441
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,700
Study. Become somebody. The world
will take care of itself.

442
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,100
When you were in college, you
must've studied very hard.

443
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
Has the world become any better

444
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,300
I'm being frank.

445
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
We wouldn't say anything bad to
you. You are Madhumita's mom.

446
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
How's she?

447
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,800
You've been suspended and
you think it's funny.

448
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,300
What are you going to do now?

449
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,000
All the things you've
suspended us for.

450
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
There could be more in the car.

451
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
There's no one.

452
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,500
He's the one, take him.

453
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
What is it?

454
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
Go back.

455
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,900
Can't you see how many
people are here.

456
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,100
Go quietly and they two?

457
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,800
We searched the entire home.
But no one is here.

458
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,900
Where they gone.

459
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,500
I don't understand.

460
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,100
Why is V.O.U.S. Pronounced Voo.

461
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,100
I'm the Professor, not
you...

462
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,700
Pronounce as I tell you...

463
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
Where are you taking me? - Come!

464
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,900
Where are we going?
- To Parganas.

465
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,600
Where?
- A small village.

466
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,600
You've studied economics
and political theory.

467
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,400
Now learn to apply it.

468
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
This is what I like about you...

469
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,600
...you barge into my class,
drag me away...

470
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,700
...and instead of taking me to
a cinema hall or Victoria...

471
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
...you take me to some village.

472
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,100
Give me your hand.

473
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
You teach French right?

474
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,100
Why don't you show me
what a French kiss is?

475
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
They want to scare you.

476
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,700
Every election, they win more than
seats without even contesting.

477
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,800
If you want to save yourselves
you have to fight against them.

478
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,500
You all are there with us.
We are not worried.

479
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Today we're there. Who
knows about tomorrow

480
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,900
We will finish studying and
go to Dubai or London...

481
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,000
...or America to work.
Then what'll you do?

482
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Tell us what to do.

483
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
You have to stay here not me.

484
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,600
This is your village,
your land, your fields.

485
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,500
So you tell me, what you'll do.
- You go wherever you want.

486
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
We'll work out something.

487
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
What is that something?

488
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,700
He says we should put
up a new person.

489
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,900
...in Boloida's place in
the councillor election.

490
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,100
Why not?

491
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,700
There are so many of you. Who
has the guts to contest?

492
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,700
Talk practically.

493
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,800
We can't do all this.
- Why?

494
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,900
We put up a person to
contest the election.

495
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,500
He disappeared overnight.
Never returned.

496
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
How many can disappear?

497
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,800
If two disappear then bring
then third, then the fourth.

498
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,900
All of you stand together.
Then what can they do?

499
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,100
Demand your rightful share of
water, electricity and food.

500
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Heard that?
- Talks a lot.

501
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
If someone gets pissed off,
they'll cut his tongue.

502
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,900
I've read his palm. He
has a long lifeline.

503
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Who is ready to contest
the election?

504
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You've slogged and educated me.

505
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Take up one more challenge.

506
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,700
Just as you've lived proudly
make this village stand proud.

507
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You can do it. You can
stand in election.

508
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,100
How is it possible?

509
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,900
If anyone can do this, it's you.

510
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Say yes, you can do it.

511
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,500
My sister will contest.

512
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
Do you realise. What he's saying?

513
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,800
You don't need all this.

514
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You shut up. You are spineless.

515
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,600
Won't all of you support her?
We will make her win.

516
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,400
Why these formalities?

517
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,600
This is my college and
they're my students.

518
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Professor Wienberg from America
has invited Michael...

519
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,000
...to do research there.

520
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,500
He is a Nobel Laureate.

521
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,900
Being invited by him is a big thing.

522
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
What's his name?

523
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,800
I'm PrasanJeet Bhattacharya.

524
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,000
I know.

525
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,800
The Principal tells me
that you're the first...

526
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,900
Many have got it earlier too.
- But I didn't know that.

527
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I'm very proud of you.

528
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Tell me, what do you want?

529
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,000
Should I talk directly with
the Chief Minister?

530
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,600
I will help in every way.
Don't hesitate to ask me.

531
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,600
Treat me as your elder brother.

532
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,000
Can I address you as my brother?

533
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Sure. Why not?

534
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,900
I don't want this American
Scholarship.

535
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,100
Why?
- I wish to stay here.

536
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,800
What will you do staying here?

537
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
So, you're not going?

538
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,900
Look, this is a lifetime
opportunity.

539
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,900
You should grab it.
Leave politics to us.

540
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,400
We fight, then make up.
We survive by hook or crook.

541
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,100
You're the strength of West

542
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,800
Bengal, precious to us.
- That's why I want to stay here.

543
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
But why politics, my brother?

544
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
You've toiled so hard...

545
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,800
...and taken the country
from where to where.

546
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,400
Don't you think I should share
that responsibility?

547
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
After all, I'm your younger brother.

548
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,000
But if everyone starts
thinking like you...

549
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,000
...no one will need me.

550
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,100
Look, there are very few
good men in politics.

551
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,600
I know.

552
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,800
Alright, take care of yourself.

553
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,100
You're there, my elder
brother. Isn't it?

554
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
That's right, where will I go?

555
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Let's go.

556
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
PrasenJit is not only a Minister...

557
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,100
...he's the correspondent
of our College.

558
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,900
What happened? He was talking
happily, smiling.

559
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,900
Only thing missing was a hug.

560
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,800
Call Trilok?

561
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,900
He's in Room No. 42.
- No he's in Vishnu's room.

562
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,900
Tell him his uncle has come.
- Alright, I'll go.

563
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,700
Want to fight elections?
C'mon tell me!

564
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:19,400
Who did this?
- I'll be alright.

565
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,900
They were Gopal's men.

566
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Who is it?

567
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
Who are you?
- Let me see them.

568
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:05,100
How dare you barge in?
Get out all of you.

569
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,400
Look, I'm asking you all to get out.

570
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,400
I'm asking you to stop.

571
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,400
We can come to a compromise.

572
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
We will sit and talk.

573
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,700
Things can be set right.

574
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,800
Why don't you understand?

575
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,700
I have a wife and a
four year old child.

576
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,900
It's not fair to barge
in like this.

577
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:43,900
What's my mistake? Please tell me.

578
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,700
This is the last warning.

579
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,900
Is the Inspector inside?

580
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,800
Want to file an F.I.R.

581
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,300
Want to file an
F.I.R. Give me a pen.

582
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Gopal Singh's house
has been attacked.

583
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,800
Do you know who did it?
- Yes.

584
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,400
We did it.
- You all?

585
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yes... write down the names.

586
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,500
You are not writing?
Is the list too long?

587
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,800
Isn't the lock-up room
too small? No problem.

588
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's okay!

589
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
I can't understand a word.

590
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,400
I could never understand.

591
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,700
Remember how you cleared
your Science paper?

592
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,800
Agreed, this is blackmail.

593
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
A doctor shouldn't be doing this.

594
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But this is Just a small favour.

595
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,500
I've known these boys
since childhood.

596
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
They are from educated families.

597
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,600
They have been in Jail
since two days.

598
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Yes ok allright.

599
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,000
It's over.
- Can we go? - Yes... go!

600
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,000
Hey! What is this?
- Aero Physics. Goes over our heads

601
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Can I get a cigarette?

602
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:51,400
I'll take it...
- Get going...

603
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,700
There's only one and I'm taking it...

604
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,100
What have you done? Now,
how can I go out?

605
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,500
You look seXy. - Will you
keep quiet if I tear yours?

606
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,000
Please wait.

607
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,100
It's not what you are thinking.

608
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,700
How do you know, what I am thinking?

609
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,800
Whatever you're thinking
it's not that.

610
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,900
Tell me, what was I thinking
about? Is this what your uncle...

611
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,300
...and aunty taught you?

612
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,700
Why do women always think
ill of other women?

613
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,800
Would you believe me if I said that
your wild son tore my blouse?

614
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Straighten it and leave.
Don't come back.

615
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,900
You think I will ever come back?
Even if you fall at my feet, I wont.

616
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,100
I pity your daughter-in-law.

617
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,700
Get out. Arguing with
me in my house?

618
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,600
Are both of you aware of all this?
- No! - No, mother!

619
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Lies. Full of lies.

620
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,700
Kanta Devi has won.

621
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,000
For the first time a lady
has won in our village.

622
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
I've won only because of you.

623
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
Otherwise the election would
have never been fair.

624
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,100
Give me your hand.

625
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,700
What was that big commotion?

626
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Were you scolding your
uncle or was he?

627
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,900
We had a fight.
- Why?

628
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,800
He wanted me to marry some
idiot whom I don't want to.

629
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,800
And the idiot I want to marry
doesn't want to marry at all.

630
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Pack your bags and move
in with me. In my room.

631
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,400
Where will I stay?

632
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,800
In Tara and Joe's room
or aunt Leela's room?

633
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
In my room.

634
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,000
Before marriage?
- Why not?

635
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
It's a sin.

636
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,000
If it's a sin to live together, then
it's also a sin to fall in love.

637
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,000
Love is divine.
- There is no such thing as love.

638
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,400
We are all born, we meaning,
you, me, the red shirt...

639
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,700
...yellow dress, everyone
to procreate.

640
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Flirting, roaming on beaches...

641
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,600
...laughing and crying
come to an end...

642
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
...in a park or in a hotel bed.

643
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,800
Love is nothing but hormones.

644
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,800
It's pure organic chemistry.

645
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,800
That's it!

646
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,500
Understand?
- Not a thing.

647
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,500
It's very simple. I love you.

648
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,600
Come live with me if you
can put up with my ways.

649
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,600
I'll think about it.

650
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,700
'The clouds came. They
build up the heat.'

651
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,400
'They showered rain.'
'By their will.'

652
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,700
'The path that comes, it also goes.'

653
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,900
'Lt may turn somewhere.'
'By their will.'

654
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,700
'Listen! Listen to this story.'

655
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,100
'Think about it, my friend.'

656
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
'The stones that break way.'

657
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
'You'll find them in these paths.'

658
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
'This is not a thread.'

659
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,400
'Which can't be tied up.'

660
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:25,700
'The world is like a dream,
think this as a sign.'

661
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:37,000
'These are the sounds of the hearts
which can only be heard here.'

662
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,500
Today's our 113th day.
- For what?

663
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,700
When we met at the Sky Lounge
for the first time.

664
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,400
You've forgotten already?

665
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,500
How can I, eXcept on public
holidays? - Liar, you will forget.

666
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
May be.
- Will you?

667
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Maybe!
- What do you mean, maybe?

668
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,600
Maybe. So give me an
unforgettable kiss.

669
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
Dog!

670
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,800
The signal is down. -
It's 2 minutes earlier.

671
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,000
If you're done come Pack,
We're in Howrah.

672
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,700
Absolutely. How can I forget?

673
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,800
You're marrying her?
- Are you mad?

674
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,400
College romance ends with College.
It Just limited in the train.

675
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Girls of Kolkatta
are waiting for me.

676
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Come here. How are you?

677
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,400
What is this ArJun? Call me 'Anna'.

678
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,700
How are you?

679
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,300
Will you pass?
- Of course.

680
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
Don't forget me, will you?
- No, never.

681
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Won't you say it?

682
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,700
Will you call me?
- Yes.

683
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,400
Class-mate. Had a doubt
in Electronics.

684
