1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,538
23.976

2
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:00,753
Sir, congratulations on the district!

3
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,960
Though, I've heard Tejpur
is a rough district

4
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:06,289
But you won't have any problems.
DIG Verma is there

5
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,703
Thanks. Now you all go.

6
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:14,699
It's time for the train.
I have to make a call

7
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,641
How are you son?

8
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:33,637
Why didn't you call yesterday?
Anuradha was so worried

9
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:37,841
Here, talk to him.
I don't want to talk

10
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:41,173
Yes, what is it?
I just didn't get time yesterday

11
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,585
It was twelve by the time I wrapped up
work at the office

12
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:47,372
Yes, yes. I know everything.
You're smoking a cigarette, no?

13
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:50,954
You women have telescopes on your noses.
Hey, I don't even touch cigarettes

14
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,242
One should learn
the art of lying from you

15
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,615
Okay, tell me, why did you call up?
I've got a district posting

16
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,694
Really! Where?
Tejpur

17
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,859
Tejpur? Have you gone mad?
I'm not going to that wild district

18
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,937
Okay, then you stay
with my mother...

19
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,684
and I'll eat the guest house chappatis
all my life

20
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:13,848
Madam, for a district, something other
than a gold medal is required

21
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:17,551
I've got Tejpur because
nobody wants to go there

22
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:20,381
Naturally. Who wants to go
to such a violent place?

23
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,420
Nowadays which place
isn't violent, Anu?

24
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,542
You don't worry needlessly.
Make a programme to come quickly

25
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:30,372
Impossible! Amit, you know how scared
I am of violence...

26
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:33,995
how I opposed the IPS...
and now Tejpur

27
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,656
Anu, it's not what you think.
It's just a job

28
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,359
There are no hassles for those who
work within rules and regulations

29
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,855
You know, I also
don't like violence

30
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,642
Listen, if I don't do this now,
I don't now when I'll get a district

31
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,722
And now I can't stay without you

32
00:03:55,723 --> 00:04:00,758
There is a bungalow,
a very big garden...

33
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,006
When are you leaving?
Right now

34
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,087
The train is leaving
in five minutes

35
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,084
At 7 in the morning, I'll reach
the Motipur Division headquarters

36
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:11,497
I'll take charge from DIG Anurag Verma
and go straight to Tejpur

37
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,744
You get your reservations done
for next week

38
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:15,743
Okay

39
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,448
Okay, come on... cheer up Anu

40
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,778
Say bye to me properly or I'll
keep sitting here and smoking

41
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,357
And I'll miss the train.
What! So you were smoking. I knew it

42
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:32,436
Let me just come...
then I'll show you...!

43
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,794
Fixed one for you also, sir.

44
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:51,832
Just one, small peg

45
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,121
As far as we know, this is
your first district posting?

46
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,449
Yes. You all do business?

47
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,738
Yes. This is Nandkumar and I am
Satyasheel. We own sugar mills

48
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,816
Well, can we ask you
a question in private?

49
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:10,064
What is the going rate
for the district SP?

50
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,394
I didn't understand

51
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,726
Tejpur is a district
for earning, brother

52
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:19,388
Strong mafia groups there the
minister must have taken a fat packet

53
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,675
Listen, you are under
a misconception

54
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,840
You also, Mr SP...

55
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:32,084
Only last year, we financed the
transfer of Lakhisarai SP, N B Prasad

56
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:38,037
We have a factory there...
lots of labour problems

57
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,742
That time, from the local MLA
to the Home Minister Dwarka Rai...

58
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,862
it cost us 5 million

59
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:50,607
Forgive me, but I don't
need any finance

60
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:20,827
Tejpur is the biggest of the six
districts in the Motipur division

61
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:26,821
It's a little disturbed. The earlier
SP Gupta had a bad time

62
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,650
He was a nervous type...
new IPS...

63
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,355
he clashed with the local mafia. Lost
his dignity and district as well

64
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,560
But you don't worry.
DSP Bhurelal is my man there

65
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:42,346
Very efficient.
Keeps everyone together

66
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:44,594
You just relax

67
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:48,091
If there is any problem, just ring me up
and I'll settle everything from here

68
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,335
You can benefit fully
from my experience

69
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,583
I have seventy years experience.
Seventy years

70
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:02,244
My father joined the British Police
as head constable...

71
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:06,114
and after 40 years retired as DSP

72
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:09,153
I was directly recruited
as the DSP 30 years ago

73
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:13,273
And now I've been promoted to DIG

74
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:16,187
From the bottom to the top,
I'm in touch with everyone

75
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:20,850
You are very lucky that an officer
like me is your DIG

76
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:40,579
What happened?

77
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,950
Sir, looks like the fuel pump
has given up

78
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,765
Looks like the fuel pump
has given up

79
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,971
Is there a garage around here?

80
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:08,427
Shikarpur Police Station is close by.
We'll get it fixed there, sir

81
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:13,923
We can make it there...
slowly, sir

82
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,409
We have reached

83
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,819
Is this Shikarpur Police Station
Yes, sir

84
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,025
It's a huge area from
Bholapur to Kosu Ghat

85
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:37,315
In around 20-25 miles, this is
the only police station

86
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,853
Okay. You get the car repaired quickly
Yes, Sir

87
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:46,431
Hey! That seems to be SP's car.

88
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:57,754
Where is the station in-charge?

89
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:08,658
Sir... the Sub-Inspector is getting
a massage. His back was aching

90
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,530
Yesterday, he was out patrolling.
The road never the river is really bad

91
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:19,148
He was on the motorcycle

92
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,971
Sir... big boss

93
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:38,421
Sir S.I. Bhola Chowdhary.
Station Incharge Shikarpur, sir

94
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,999
You are lying here like this...

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,831
suppose there was some dacoit
instead of me?

96
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:47,161
Sir, what will a dacoit find
in this police station?

97
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:50,784
Why... they can take
away your weapons

98
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,363
Guns and rifles, they have their own.
The best ones

99
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:59,108
Our 303 in any case gets jammed

100
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:02,146
Meet me in office.
Yes sir

101
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:06,393
Hey, run to the market. Get some
first class tea and snacks for sir

102
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,132
Is this your FIR register?

103
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,214
Sir, the stationary has been over
for three months

104
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:23,085
But there are no entries here
after the twelfth of last month

105
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,080
But we note everything, sir.
It's not faired out...

106
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:33,324
You lodge F.I.R. In this?

107
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,487
Just some minor incidents, sir...
otherwise it's quite peaceful sir

108
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,067
What do you know about this area?
You hardly step out

109
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,146
Our jeep is out of action, sir.
For a whole month...

110
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:47,226
there has been no money
in the diesel fund

111
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:51,140
Then how do you manage?
Sir, we use Pappu Thekedar's car

112
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,886
In case of emergency the car from
Kajriwal's petrol pump also arrives

113
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:57,591
We've developed good relations
with everyone, sir

114
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:02,961
In case of an emergency, there is
never any problem with vehicles, sir

115
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:06,248
Sir, breakfast is served

116
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,995
Let's proceed, Sir

117
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,320
Please accept greetings
from Pappu Thekedar, sir

118
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:21,443
You were just saying that there is
no money for the fuel fund...

119
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:24,980
then how has this food feast
been laid out?

120
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:28,226
Shikarpur is not that backward, sir

121
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:31,891
And till we are here, don't worry
about Shikarpur Police Station

122
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:35,553
There will be no complaints
from here

123
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,676
Where is this bus going?
It will go to Tejpur depot, sir

124
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:43,920
Stop the bus...
you get this car fixed and come

125
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:50,206
Please take my car

126
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:57,157
Take one piece, it's totally fresh.
It's been made specially for you

127
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,234
If you stop over for the night...

128
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:08,646
we'll get a chance to offer
some special services to you

129
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,255
One ticket for Tejpur

130
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:27,168
I'm a family man. I have children
to feed, sir. If I take...

131
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,248
And if you don't take it,
I'm going to get off

132
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,578
Beat me up, sir. But don't
make me commit this sin

133
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:39,156
Looks like checking is on, sir.
What checking?

134
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:42,277
The usual, sir. Must be the police
team from the station...

135
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,066
I'll just fix the situation

136
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:48,980
I've also become half-mad. When
the boss is sitting here...

137
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,184
then who is going to stop the bus?

138
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:57,430
You will not open your mouth.
You will not reveal my identity

139
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:05,296
Get down

140
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:10,500
To the officer

141
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:15,204
Pick up your bags and briefcases.
There is going to be a checking

142
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,284
What sort of checking, brother?

143
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:20,323
Don't ask so many questions.
Please take your seats

144
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:23,445
But it's a straight question.
He has a right to know

145
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:26,942
Don't teach me the law. You've worn a
suit-pant and blasting off in English

146
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,313
The police has the power to
conduct any checking

147
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:34,309
Where is your officer?
Why? He sitting there.

148
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,054
Whose baggage is this?

149
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,578
Excuse me... Mr Sub Inspector...?
What's the purpose of this checking?

150
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,405
I was talking to you only, sir

151
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:06,445
Hey Chatturbhuj Singh...
what's this gentleman's problem?

152
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,857
He asks too many questions, sir

153
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:12,021
Where are you coming from?
From close by

154
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:15,144
Where will you go?
Listen Sub-Inspector, I'm only...

155
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:18,640
Shut up! I'll ask you the questions!
You just answer

156
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,387
Sub Inspector Manganiram is my name
In a few minutes...

157
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,593
I'll teach you law and order.
You get that, or don't you?

158
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,382
You don't know the power
of a Sub-Inspector

159
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:29,713
You'll be behind bars within a minute.
You'll rot without any charge...

160
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,374
you'll wet your suit-pant
standing here only

161
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,371
I was only asking you the
purpose of this checking

162
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,411
It's an inconvenience
to the passengers

163
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,657
Hey Chatturbhuj, take him...
we'll teach him a lesson

164
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,860
He thinks he knows it all

165
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,649
Are you arresting me?
What else? Should I welcome you?

166
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,980
Hey... what are you doing?
Don't you recognise him?

167
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:58,642
He's the new S.P. Of Tejpur.
What?!

168
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:04,802
It was a serious mistake, sir.
A major blunder

169
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:09,340
Bloody half-mind...
you don't even recognise him!

170
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:18,331
Sir, it was a mistake! You are God!
Please forgive us!

171
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,118
Pick up these people
We'll be ruined, sir. We apologise...

172
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:26,489
One minute first stop this drama

173
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,859
Give them a clean sheet of paper

174
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,769
Sub-Inspector Manganiram,
please write your statement...

175
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,516
justifying why you should not be
suspended from your post

176
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:45,388
The more you cry, the more you
will have to write, Manganiram

177
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:04,950
Our police stations are being
run by contractors...

178
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:08,489
our vehicles run at the mercy
of petrol pump owners...

179
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,152
we take bribes and indulge
in corruption openly

180
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,400
Our style of functioning is worse than
that of criminals

181
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,396
Can anyone tell me why we are working
in the police? Who are we serving?

182
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,849
Why should the public trust us?

183
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,055
I know these lectures
will fall on deaf ears

184
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,049
But please understand that all this
will not work with me

185
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:35,253
Everyone should clearly understand
the rules and regulations...

186
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:40,748
the police manual and their duties.
I will not tolerate illegal ways

187
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:46,035
You will all work with honesty
and integrity...

188
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,738
and this should be clear not to me,
but to the public

189
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:56,192
Sir, I heard your entire speech.
Our eyes have open, sir

190
00:16:56,857 --> 00:17:00,228
Now we'll never take
the wrong path, sir

191
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,558
Good thing.
Thank you, sir

192
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,098
You forgave me. Now I'll
become honest and show you

193
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,635
I'm going to win the best
Sub-Inspector medal sir

194
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,549
One minute... one minute. You are
under a misconception

195
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,589
I didn't talk about forgiveness

196
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,212
Rather I had asked you
for a written statement

197
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:19,541
You still haven't given it.
How can I write it, sir?

198
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:23,537
My hands will be chopped off!
Sir, give me a last chance

199
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:26,617
The kids will bless you, sir...
You are just wasting your time

200
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,948
If you don't write the statement,
I'll have to write it myself

201
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,486
Then write it, sir! Write my death
warrant with your own hands

202
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:37,523
I'm from the backward caste,
that's why this situation has come

203
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:42,146
I took a loan of 300,000 to bribe a
minister of my own caste to be recruited

204
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,142
I'm still paying it off, sir
Here my colleagues...

205
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,846
have done their graduation and
post graduation in corruption

206
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:51,843
Sub-Inspector R.K. Singh
has built himself...

207
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:55,258
a double-storied house with black money.
And because I'm backward...

208
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:59,584
Manganiram is talking
without proof!

209
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:01,916
Sit down, R.K. Singh.
He's talking such crap!

210
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,662
Manganiram, let's go from here

211
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:09,449
if there is something wrong
in what I'm saying, sir

212
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,946
Just because people of your caste
support you, you act smart

213
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:15,610
Mangani, please don't talk rubbish.
Rubbish?

214
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,775
Just because I'm a scheduled caste...
Talking to him is pointless

215
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:22,436
Stop arguing before the boss

216
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:28,016
I will not bear this indiscipline

217
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:48,828
Looking like a complete goon

218
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,447
Well, that I am!

219
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,779
Let me go!
What'll you do?

220
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,651
Call the police -
slam an FIR

221
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:02,232
Really! I'm the superintendent here,
you'll be the one jailed

222
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:07,642
Without charge.
Let go

223
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:10,889
Sir, this is yours.
It's looking lighter, R.K.

224
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,012
The collection was lower this time.
It's reduced?

225
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,425
Nonua was telling us something else.
Then why don't you take it from him?

226
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,924
What do you mean?
Why're you raising hell?

227
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,047
I'm hardly raising hell, Mr DSP

228
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,668
First I'm suspended.
Then a cut in my share

229
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,750
Just get it for free no...

230
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:28,580
Hey, R.K., the confusion is about
Nonua presenting the wrong picture

231
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,243
Meet him and sort out accounts.
All the accounts are clear, sir

232
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:48,103
Looks like he's getting restless

233
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,847
Good evening, Mr Singh.
Why did you bother?

234
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:55,719
You should have sent a slave...
I would have come

235
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,049
Stop delivering these dialogues.
I've had enough of your hypocrisy

236
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,046
Oh master, sit down.
Why are you getting angry?

237
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,710
How did the DSP discover
the accounts?

238
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,833
What are you saying, sub-inspector?
I'll cut-off my head...

239
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:10,247
and sacrifice it to the holy Ganga
if anyone can prove my betrayal

240
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:15,283
Don't fuck with me

241
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:34,306
This had to bloody happen

242
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:46,669
Our business has also some ethics,
R.K. Singh. You're in the wrong

243
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,949
He's dead

244
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,653
Get out of here and lie low
for sometime now

245
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,648
The new SP will create
havoc, Mr DSP

246
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:10,062
I am there, no?
Leave him here only

247
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:19,511
Hail Lord Shiva...!

248
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:23,715
Mass-Maha Shivratri Prayer
Organiser: Sadhu Yadav

249
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,203
Every year we have come for Sadhu
Yadav's Mahashivratri celebration

250
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,117
You see my wife is a devotee
of Lord Shiva

251
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:39,490
Sadhu Yadav organises
the fest so well

252
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:42,820
Have you met him?
No sir, I'm busy with the Nonua case

253
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:46,025
Any developments in the Nonua case?
Home Minister Dwarka Rai had rung me up

254
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:48,231
He was saying, a dacoit
murders a sub-inspector...

255
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:50,354
how will I show my face in the
Legislative Assembly?

256
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:54,768
Amit, make a few arrests.
One or two... got it?

257
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,498
Hail Brother Sundar!
For all time to come

258
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,828
Yadav, your name will shine

259
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:22,240
Hail brother Sundar!

260
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:09,568
Please take blessings, Mr SP. This is
the first time you have come...

261
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,938
to Lord Bhola's temple and today
is Mahashivratri

262
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,935
Your sincere prayers
will be answered

263
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,682
At least try.
Lord Shiva is very generous

264
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:24,802
I know the one thing that you
need the most just ask for it

265
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,298
What's the harm?

266
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,630
Come on, Amit ask for it.
Maybe you are able to nab Nonua

267
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,916
Of course, I will

268
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:38,830
Because, no matter how much Nonua
and other criminals like him...

269
00:23:39,246 --> 00:23:43,242
think that they are in safe hands,
the Lord won't protect them

270
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:04,428
Nonua had come here
the night before the murder

271
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,842
This is Chandi Sahu,
a sugarcane trader

272
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:09,007
He had many dealings with Nonua, sir

273
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:12,962
Said anything?
No, sir. He's not saying anything

274
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:18,165
You take the rest of them and go
to the station. Leave him here

275
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:26,365
Take me also to the station.
I can't stay here alone

276
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:34,065
Look, sir, this is not right

277
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,518
Take me to the police station!
It's not my fault, sir

278
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,972
Had Nonua come here?

279
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:47,635
Where did he go from here?
Didn't say anything, sir

280
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:50,049
Slipped out at night itself

281
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,713
I swear on my child, sir.
I have no relationship with him

282
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:58,665
On the contrary,
he took all my cash

283
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:04,369
Come to the station
and give your statement

284
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:10,528
Who are they?

285
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,026
Some people who are associated
with his gang

286
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:16,023
Said anything yet?
No. Haven't yet asked them properly

287
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:19,020
Note down their names, addresses

288
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:23,433
Your name

289
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:32,008
We are not connected to him, sir.
I run a general store in a big market

290
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:36,628
His daughter is young, sir.
She used to hang around with him

291
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:42,955
Come on, Mr Tiwari. It's a year since
my daughter got married and...

292
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:49,241
went away to her house in Sultanganj.
There is no socialising with Nonua

293
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:54,026
Arrested them on suspicion, sir.
The DIG had rung up

294
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:56,691
The minister has called
a press conference tomorrow

295
00:25:56,692 --> 00:26:02,269
I swear on my child, sir

296
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:17,796
What to do with these people?

297
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:23,290
Release them.
Let them all go

298
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:49,514
Bless you. How are you?
How is your son?

299
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:54,133
Everything is okay, baba

300
00:26:54,134 --> 00:27:00,753
Summoned you so late at night because
I have to send a gift to your SP

301
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:06,121
He's here...?
With you, baba?

302
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:10,117
After murdering the inspector R.K. Singh
he came here only, to my place

303
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:15,072
For 12 days, I've been feeding
the bugger. Now his time is up

304
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:21,066
You're my child,
so I'm giving you an opportunity

305
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:29,599
Utilize it well for everybody's benefit.
The SP's benefit, your benefit and mine

306
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:36,592
If I take him alive, the boss will
make him spill all the beans

307
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:41,128
The department will be ruined.
So bump off the bastard

308
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:44,500
It'll also be easy to take him

309
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:49,828
What are you thinking?

310
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:59,403
Look, this bugger
has started peeing!

311
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:24,209
Have your tea, Bachha.
It'll get cold

312
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,541
Bachha Yadav here

313
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:30,455
Nonua and four-five of his henchmen
attacked us near the Suraiya bridge

314
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:35,158
Twelve rounds were fired from our side.
Two criminals were killed...

315
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,697
and the rest fled. I'm bringing
the dead bodies with me

316
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:59,341
Nonua has been killed?
What?

317
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:04,253
People are saying.
Nonua has been killed

318
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:09,665
Nonua has been killed

319
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:55,536
Yes, yes, but you had said
that Nonua has fled to the border

320
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,949
That's the information
we had received, sir

321
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:03,362
Find out how Bachha Yadav
got hold of him

322
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:11,478
Was ambushed, as soon as he
crossed the bridge

323
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,974
It must have been around?
2:30-3:00

324
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:32,541
Move back

325
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:38,242
They're in the police station, sir

326
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:44,154
I got news of the encounter
last night itself

327
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:10,710
Wow! It's amazing, Mr SP

328
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:13,040
Even the Mumbai police doesn't
deliver such quick results

329
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:16,371
Actually!

330
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:22,823
Amit Kumar Long live

331
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:33,313
SP Saheb Amit Kumar
Long live! Long Live!

332
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:08,153
Well done. This is what you
call results. See Mr DIG...

333
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:13,065
this is our man. You arrested
the wrong people on suspicion...

334
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,101
and then informed us. Our officer has
finished off the real dacoit

335
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:21,473
That's there, sir

336
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:25,469
Amir Kumar has become an encounter
specialist as soon as he has arrived

337
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,839
I am ecstatic. When I had sent him here
then, I had assigned him only one task

338
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:36,749
That he should relieve our Tejpur of the
twin diseases of crime and corruption

339
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,702
And today, he has totally lived up
to my expectations

340
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:47,447
Today, on this occasion,
I announce that Amit Kumar...

341
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:53,400
will receive the President's Gold Medal
on the forthcoming Republic Day

342
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:08,591
Got any leads?
Sir, we really are trying

343
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:12,671
You just keep trying while
this upstart has become a hero

344
00:33:13,504 --> 00:33:16,501
No, sir. We'll find out quickly

345
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:22,745
Actually, the credit for this success
rightfully belongs to Bachha Yadav

346
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,449
Oh yes, of course.
Soldiers obviously fight...

347
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,734
but the medal of victory
goes to the General only

348
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:46,097
Pipri dacoity incident. You were
assigned this case on April 7

349
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:49,759
By May 13, you arrested five
criminals and solved the case

350
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:56,461
Raniganj double murder. You arrested
the two family members...

351
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:00,622
involved in the murder
within 72 hours

352
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:04,494
Sarai Tola rape case.
Nathopur murder incident...

353
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:09,489
Naingarh conspiracy case...
and these remaining 18 cases

354
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,150
Whatever was assigned to you, you
displayed success beyond expectations

355
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:22,559
Most of the cases were solved
with your insight and dedication

356
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,266
There was progress in the
investigation and enquiries

357
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:29,012
And as far as I know,
there was no dishonesty

358
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:34,257
Looking at these,
one cannot doubt...

359
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,961
that you are an honest
and courageous officer

360
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:41,874
But the moment I see these files,
I am baffled. It defies logic

361
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,576
What I can't understand is how,
for the last seven years...

362
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:49,573
you have not been transferred
out of this district

363
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:53,280
How all of Sadhu and Sundar's cases
are assigned to you...

364
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:57,817
and how there has been almost no
progress in any of these cases

365
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:03,519
I can't figure out what happens to your
honesty and courage in these matters

366
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,719
Sadhu Yadav handed over Nonua
to you, no?

367
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,549
Sir... sir I can't quite understand
what you are saying

368
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:19,213
People like you, perhaps,
don't even understand...

369
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,125
that today because of you,
I'm being applauded as a hero...

370
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:25,039
for something I never wanted to do

371
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,534
And if you think that I'm going
to be weighed down by this medal...

372
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:33,281
that I've won through your minor bravery
and ignore your misdeeds...

373
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,903
then you are mistaken,
Bachha Yadav

374
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:37,069
Sir... yes

375
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,356
Why do you work for Sadhu Yadav?
How is he related to you?

376
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:46,101
No sir. It's nothing
of the sort

377
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,430
What have you given him
for giving you Nonua?

378
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:52,845
Your integrity? Or have you
tried to sell me?

379
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:56,841
Sir, I... really can't understand...

380
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:01,295
But I can understand perfectly well
that you earn your livelihood...

381
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:05,373
from the police, but the person
you work for is Sadhu Yadav

382
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,828
Sir, how can you... I haven't done
anything of that kind

383
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:14,323
Bachha Yadav, I respect
honesty and bravery

384
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:20,276
But I am not blind. What you did
in the Nonua case was cowardice

385
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:25,062
I will never tolerate
this kind of character

386
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:30,057
I want the truth and you
will tell me the truth

387
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:34,179
And what do you think? Since he's from
your caste, he will protect you?

388
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:39,590
Bachha Yadav, these people care
neither about caste nor blood

389
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:43,710
When Nonua took shelter with him...

390
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,124
so what guarantee is there that
the day you have served his purpose...

391
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,705
he won't sell you?

392
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,951
You can go now

393
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,921
First give me some.
I'm suspended

394
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:28,790
Of course Manganiram.
Take two packets

395
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,326
What on earth is happening here?

396
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:37,657
Our Lord Shiva has blessed your true
devotion and answered your prayers

397
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:45,691
Your winning a medal is a matter
of pride for Tejpur

398
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:49,811
Stop this right now!

399
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:55,597
And who gave you the permission for
this theatrical performance?

400
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:01,799
We are the uncrowned emperors
of Tejpur

401
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,088
Here we don't take permission.
We grant it

402
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:09,791
Learn the new rules as soon
as possible, Sadhu Yadav

403
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,830
It'll be good for you

404
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,992
I thought you were
a sensible man, SP

405
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:19,614
I went to great lengths to
assure your advancement...

406
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:25,233
even sent you a huge token...

407
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:27,814
but I was wrong

408
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:31,102
You are not worthy of my friendship

409
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:36,223
Let's go

410
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:44,715
Even earlier I suspected
Sadhu Yadav is behind this

411
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,628
What is the SP doing now?

412
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:51,083
He's called Bachha Yadav to the room.
Find out what's going on

413
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:11,730
I had told you that these people
have no loyalties

414
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,511
Inspector Bachha Yadav, I want the
complete report of your statement

415
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:26,131
And until you give those to me,
you will not do any other work here

416
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:38,327
Sir, the DIG is on the line

417
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:45,820
You've done well, Amit. Yadav deserves
this kind of treatment. Bloody rogue!

418
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:47,859
Sir, you...

419
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,856
I've just heard about
Sadhu Yadav being insulted

420
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:53,645
These incidents can't be
kept under wraps in the department

421
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:57,642
Anyway, what are you doing
with Bachha Yadav?

422
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,927
Sir, it's hard to say anything
right now. I'm making an enquiry

423
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:08,506
Yes, but proceed cautiously.
The minister himself has praised you

424
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:11,918
His standing with the department
may be affected...

425
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:15,664
if the truth about
the Nonua case is revealed

426
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,037
After you take a confession
from Bachha Yadav...

427
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:20,659
I'll tell you how to proceed

428
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,071
I'll definitely speak to you
when the need arises, sir

429
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:31,274
Should we give Bachha Yadav a memo
on behalf of the department?

430
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,146
You want to give it?

431
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,686
Sir, you are the one who told him
not to come to work

432
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:38,850
DSP Bhurelal, I'm doing whatever
has to be done regarding him

433
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:44,720
If your help is required, I'll ask

434
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:51,295
One more thing

435
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,960
Informing the DIG about what is
happening here and entering my room...

436
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:57,956
without permission, are not the
attributes of a good police officer

437
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:02,910
In future, keep that in mind

438
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:10,861
You may go

439
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:23,305
Of course, there's money
in the Bhatti business...

440
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:26,093
but brother Sundar, this is beyond me.
So who's telling you to do it?

441
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:29,965
Just finance it

442
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:33,254
Your SP will have to be straightened
out. That bastard makes too much noise

443
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:37,041
I need to speak to you.
Yeah... yeah tell me

444
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,705
The boss has become suspicious.
If Baba says something...

445
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:43,826
my job will be under threat

446
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:48,821
What will happen then? After all
it was Baba who got you recruited

447
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:52,693
Don't get stressed out unnecessarily.
This SP won't stay long

448
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,356
What is Dadua saying?
He is right

449
00:41:56,731 --> 00:42:02,433
Your money and my labour fifty-fifty

450
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:22,038
He's been drinking since morning

451
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:29,448
Now, why are you standing outside?
Come in

452
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:41,018
Why has he come here?

453
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:47,263
He came with us.
I need to talk to you

454
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:56,837
Hell, I don't know whether
I have a job or not

455
00:42:56,838 --> 00:42:59,958
I'm stuck in the middle with neither
a chargesheet nor any duty

456
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:03,954
What do you say?

457
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:07,826
Please stop now.
How much will you pour?

458
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,572
Don't give me lectures.
Pass me three glasses

459
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:15,277
Actually take the glass away.
And Bhabhi, make some steaming hot tea

460
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:21,812
What's the matter?

461
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:25,226
The SP is not willing to agree.
I'll lose my job

462
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:30,804
Bachha, only you can do something.
Cut the crap and get to the point

463
00:43:31,302 --> 00:43:33,883
Buddy, we have to arrange
for Manganiram's transfer

464
00:43:33,883 --> 00:43:36,130
Bhurelal had taken the matter
to the DIG

465
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:38,961
Verma has made a demand of two lakhs.
So?

466
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:41,750
Heard that you're also
getting a transfer

467
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:44,122
If you can tell Sadhu Baba,
then mine also...

468
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:51,033
That's why I don't associate with you.
What do you think I am, a broker?

469
00:43:52,823 --> 00:43:57,069
I don a Khakhi uniform.
I'm a policeman

470
00:43:57,943 --> 00:44:01,147
If you are a policeman, then
why do you work under constant fear?

471
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:04,728
Not a moment of peace.
Sometimes there's the fear of goons...

472
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:08,306
sometimes it's the boss, sometimes
you're afraid of losing respect

473
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:11,679
Danger in everything.
Why do you do this job?

474
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:39,692
Where is Baba?
Sitting in the garden

475
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:43,897
Do something fast. If this new SP
sticks on there'll be trouble

476
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:49,475
He's creating havoc for our men.
Are you talking about Bachha?

477
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:55,552
Yeah, he'd come to me.
He's very hassled

478
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,880
Let the bastard die. He's our pet dog.
After all when will he come in handy?

479
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:06,874
You worry about your business.
What happened to the PWD tender?

480
00:45:12,118 --> 00:45:15,699
How are you Bachha Yadav? Heard
the SP stripped off your uniform

481
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:22,608
Bachha has come.
Come Bachha. How are you?

482
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:40,674
Everything is fine.
Why are you so tense?

483
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:44,545
Hey, nothing will happen to you,
I'm there

484
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:50,995
Take this. Tell me if you need more

485
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:57,156
No Baba. You've given me everything.
Now I don't want anything more

486
00:46:08,354 --> 00:46:11,975
Good morning, brother Sundar. I'd kept
it ready the moment I heard the siren

487
00:46:14,306 --> 00:46:17,803
Well Kesari, what's the tension at the
Market Association Building tender?

488
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:21,298
Nothing brother. The same old story.
These vendor types...

489
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:25,545
have formed a union and filled the
tender. They'll construct a building

490
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:30,873
How much chuna have you put, Bansi?
It'll cut my mouth, you bastard

491
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:37,284
Spit out boss,
I'll prepare another one

492
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:46,150
Go ahead, Kesari. It's time for the
tender at the PWD Engineer's office

493
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:58,303
Open the tender

494
00:46:58,304 --> 00:47:01,008
What's the matter, Munna Thakur?
Why are you screaming?

495
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:03,340
This bastard Chief Engineer,
talking a lot of law

496
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:07,711
The Union's tender is 2,756,500

497
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:20,947
And Sundar Construction...
3,035,000

498
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:30,854
And this building's contract
is given to Sundar Construction

499
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,055
Stamp this now

500
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:40,344
This is not legal

501
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:44,632
Do as you have been told, Engineer.
Otherwise, we'll totally cripple you

502
00:47:45,048 --> 00:47:50,252
Look, I can't do this

503
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:01,615
Now can you do it, eh?

504
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,812
Since the time you've joined Tejpur,
I've been witnessing your drama

505
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,264
Enough of your legal mumbo-jumbo

506
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:22,303
Motherfucker, you just don't
get things straight?

507
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:28,464
This bloody had to happen

508
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,999
Remember! Sundar Construction

509
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:43,116
Rabidas. I publish a newspaper here.
Tejpur Express. I had called you up

510
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:52,647
We've taken the X-Ray.
There is more injury in the left arm

511
00:48:54,604 --> 00:49:00,307
Why did you refuse to
give a statement to the police?

512
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:09,090
If you yourself don't help
the police then...

513
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:21,660
It's no big deal, Sir.
I just fell down the stairs

514
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:27,654
Khan, please arrange for their
security. And try to speak to them

515
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:37,727
Whenever you want to talk or file a
statement, don't hesitate to come to me

516
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:47,967
This is not an accident injury.
I want the correct report

517
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,541
Hey Mr Editor, why are you
working overtime?

518
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:59,580
Let him be. He's not
even settled in as yet

519
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:05,409
He doesn't look the type
who will calm down, Bhurelal

520
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,236
I want a report on all the cases
against Sundar Yadav

521
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,683
I'm Amit Kumar. The district SP

522
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,514
Yes
Came to talk to you...

523
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:25,263
about your daughter.
She is not here

524
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:28,676
Where is she?
She is at our relative's place

525
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:32,755
Our brothers stay in Gujarat
and Rajasthan. She has gone there

526
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:38,250
Do you know Sundar Yadav?

527
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:42,829
No, I don't know any Sundar Yadav.
I have not made any complaint

528
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:45,533
Why are you misleading sir?

529
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:50,446
I'm not misleading him. I said,
I don't want to make any statement

530
00:50:50,863 --> 00:50:52,651
Just go away

531
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:56,357
Khan, don't force her

532
00:50:56,358 --> 00:50:58,729
Mother is lying.
Ravi

533
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,974
My mother is lying

534
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:17,502
I know that, Ravi. But your mom
is lying for you, not for herself

535
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:23,371
she is scared that
alongwith your sister...

536
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:28,783
Sundar Yadav may also kidnap you

537
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:33,486
She is a mother. She is afraid

538
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:39,273
I had come to remove that fear
but she doesn't trust me

539
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:47,638
You'll catch hold of the crooks
and bring my sister back?

540
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:51,551
If your mother wants that,
then definitely

541
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:56,546
What should I do?
I'm alone and helpless

542
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:03,041
They've abducted my daughter and
now my son... they threaten to kill us

543
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:10,366
The police can't be trusted. No one
from the community takes a stand

544
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:17,359
You just lodge your report,
I'll handle the rest

545
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,855
All right

546
00:52:26,683 --> 00:52:31,096
Close all gates.
Nobody should be able to enter

547
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,334
They are going to create trouble

548
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:45,706
I'll inform the boss.
You call up for back up

549
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:51,407
Open the gate, Munna Thakur,
don't raise hell

550
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:53,405
We don't have orders
from Sadhu Baba

551
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:55,820
Why is there so much confusion
at the gate?

552
00:52:55,821 --> 00:53:01,233
There's a new play in town

553
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,428
Sir, they are not opening the gate

554
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:17,549
So what are you doing?

555
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:26,457
Arrest all of them

556
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:33,699
Surround them from all sides

557
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:39,486
Search for Sundar Yadav
and bring him out

558
00:53:46,729 --> 00:53:49,725
Seems to be in a big hurry

559
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,806
Do sit down

560
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:55,885
Where is Sundar Yadav?
You're acting all innocent

561
00:53:55,886 --> 00:53:58,841
Is he going to sit here
and wait for you?

562
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:03,295
There you ordered his arrest and here
I got a call from your headquarters

563
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,831
Sir, he has left

564
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:12,494
Sorry, your work wasn't done

565
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:16,739
But you're visiting my humble abode
for the first time...

566
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,153
so have some tea.
My wife makes it well

567
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:24,773
Who told you that
we are leaving from here?

568
00:54:24,774 --> 00:54:27,770
Our men will stay here 24 hours
of the day

569
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:31,474
Without their permission
you can't even move

570
00:54:31,475 --> 00:54:33,806
So you are placing me
under house arrest?

571
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:37,802
Now just keep watching
what I do to you

572
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:40,590
You won't be able to do a thing, SP

573
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:45,045
Many like you have come and gone.
They couldn't touch me

574
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:49,790
Don't live under this misconception,
Sadhu Yadav

575
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:54,701
Whenever the need arises, you'll be
dragged to the police station

576
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:59,114
And remember,
our tea is very bitter

577
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:13,599
We shall overcome...

578
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,888
We shall overcome one day

579
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:21,216
We have the faith...

580
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,547
implicit faith...

581
00:55:23,548 --> 00:55:26,712
We shall overcome one day

582
00:56:00,053 --> 00:56:04,674
Duck!

583
00:56:08,587 --> 00:56:14,040
Catch him!
He has run into that lane

584
00:56:16,537 --> 00:56:21,782
I'm okay, Anu

585
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:40,929
Dangerous attack on Tejpur SP

586
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:47,921
Now what will happen, father?
I don't know

587
00:56:47,922 --> 00:56:51,043
Sir, please let me take action.
My report is confirmed

588
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,665
The man was called from
outside the district

589
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:56,162
You are off duty, Bachha Yadav,
give your report to Tiwari

590
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,827
Duties can be figured later. This is
a matter of attack on our boss

591
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,152
There's no need to get so excited,
so many capable officers are at it

592
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:10,857
This department is not
running on because of you, okay?

593
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:15,561
Sir, then why don't you
just suspend me?

594
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:21,180
That is not in my power.
Don't try and sort out things

595
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:27,674
You are not on duty.
You can go now

596
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:53,106
Came to meet sir.
He's sleeping right now

597
00:57:57,977 --> 00:58:02,389
Fine

598
00:58:50,883 --> 00:58:55,294
Come in

599
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:04,492
What's the matter?
Can't bear it any longer, sir

600
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:09,197
I can't live like this, sir. Either
court marshal me or give me a chance

601
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:13,734
Everywhere I go, all eyes
are full of questions

602
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:16,439
and I have no answers

603
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,562
I have made mistakes
but I am not a bad person, sir

604
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:24,056
I've performed my duties
with utmost bravery

605
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:29,051
No one worth his salt can accuse me
of taking a single bribe

606
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:32,632
Give me on chance, sir. If there is
any shortcoming in my duty...

607
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:38,501
then take my resignation
immediately, sir

608
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:06,515
Pick up those files

609
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:28,035
If you know that he has made
a mistake, why don't you take action?

610
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:32,697
I'm taking a risk. Bachha Yadav is
inherently not a bad person, I think

611
01:00:33,404 --> 01:00:35,943
Can you trust him?

612
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:42,229
I don't know.
But this is his last chance

613
01:00:49,305 --> 01:00:53,009
What's the matter, Bachha?
Is everything okay?

614
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:56,381
The police have found out.
Sundar will have to flee immediately

615
01:01:00,128 --> 01:01:06,747
Listen, you yourself go to Bhawanipur.
Make him cross the border

616
01:01:17,902 --> 01:01:23,313
Hey Dadua? Everything okay?
Blessings

617
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:29,264
How long will you sit like this?
Wear these clothes

618
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:32,762
and do up your face,
else Sundar will hack you to pieces

619
01:01:58,028 --> 01:02:03,939
Goodness! Electric

620
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:41,234
I'm carefree, my intoxicating beauty
is beyond compare

621
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:44,272
Everywhere...

622
01:02:44,273 --> 01:02:48,353
in and around the town,
the word is that I'm amazing

623
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:00,881
Go and fetch her

624
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:05,044
Tied to the corner of my veil,
hang millions of hearts

625
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:07,791
How many do I take care of?

626
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:13,203
I told you no, I won't go

627
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:17,406
She is refusing

628
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:20,320
She is refusing?

629
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:25,399
I'll make that bitch agree

630
01:03:31,185 --> 01:03:35,556
Merrily the gazelle sways,
evoking a desire in many

631
01:03:38,053 --> 01:03:42,382
Oh, it's so tough on her, how long
can she suppress her desires?

632
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:52,039
Her heart too
is endlessly amorous

633
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:01,238
What's the matter? Again you
are pissed off and heated up

634
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:07,608
Look, Dadua has arranged
this entire festivity only for you

635
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:12,394
And if you don't go,
they will feel so insulted

636
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:19,052
Come for a little while, come

637
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:23,507
I'm not going

638
01:04:23,508 --> 01:04:26,670
Why won't you?

639
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:30,709
Fair, moon-like face,
dark eyes

640
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,413
You are fair, you got
a moon-like face, dark are your eyes

641
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:39,741
Bachelors all over India
are after me

642
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:44,777
Be my queen...
I'm dazed!

643
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:48,149
Says everyone

644
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,689
Amazing!

645
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:54,394
Some ask me out for the evening show,
some ask the night show

646
01:04:56,517 --> 01:05:00,554
Who do I go out with, Lord?

647
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:05,425
Who do I go out with, Lord?
I'm in a dilemma

648
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,821
Bloody bitch!
You're making me violent

649
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:28,527
How often have I told you
that I love you?

650
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:46,757
Goodness

651
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,113
Merrily the gazelle sways
as she walks ignorant

652
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:12,606
Her chiming anklets
make the Moon's heart skip a beat

653
01:06:17,518 --> 01:06:22,389
My heart is endlessly
amorous for you, my love

654
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:31,380
I'm a lassie from Delhi,
lethal is my charm

655
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:36,208
Spare me, please

656
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:39,913
Give me your heart,
says the Merchant of Love

657
01:06:40,536 --> 01:06:45,282
Oh, how can I...

658
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:49,818
just trade my heart?

659
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:54,107
I'm waiting for someone
who is one in a million

660
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,430
He shall make me his bride, and
happily I shall go away in a palanquin

661
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:32,525
Inspector Bachha Yadav is here.
Who else is with him?

662
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:37,147
He's alone

663
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:45,055
Bachha Yadav is here

664
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:49,344
I'll be there

665
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,494
You've come at the wrong time, Bachha

666
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:06,284
I know. The police has found out

667
01:08:06,285 --> 01:08:09,738
The police can't do anything here
Don't talk crap, fucker

668
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:11,820
The SP has been attacked

669
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,317
He himself is coming here
with a special force

670
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:16,606
You'll be slaughtered like a pig

671
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:19,770
We can't risk Sundar's life. Let's go.
What route, sir?

672
01:08:19,771 --> 01:08:22,600
Pipra road, via Bhairavganj.
I'll help you cross the border

673
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:25,514
You've really gone mad.
No car can go on that road

674
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:29,262
There's no need. I'll take him
on the motorcycle... hurry up

675
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:34,881
Don't worry. Bachha is my brother.
Just take care of my stuff

676
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:12,383
What's this? You'd said
we'll take the Pipra route

677
01:09:12,384 --> 01:09:16,547
Dadua has come to know about that
route, are you going to trust him?

678
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:23,041
Bugger is a pimp,
anyone can buy him off

679
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:30,657
Any bloody person can sell himself.
Do keep it...

680
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:33,821
today I'm truly paying my debt
of gratitude...

681
01:09:33,822 --> 01:09:39,234
even if I die in the process

682
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:52,427
Where are we?
I've fixed up with the mill

683
01:09:52,428 --> 01:09:55,925
Our guy will make you
cross the border in his truck

684
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:40,131
Motherfucker!

685
01:11:19,758 --> 01:11:23,462
If you arrest me, I'll be released
in 24 hours, SP

686
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:29,580
Check the records.
Understand?

687
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:35,533
No... take him away

688
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:45,273
You gave me a chance, sir.
You believed in me

689
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:50,061
You risked your life.
I'm proud of you

690
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:56,221
You've praised me enough, sir.
My heart is swelling with pride

691
01:11:59,801 --> 01:12:01,049
Where's the girl?

692
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,588
She's in Bhavanipur right now

693
01:12:03,589 --> 01:12:06,876
Get her sent for tonight itself.
Fine

694
01:12:06,877 --> 01:12:09,831
But my son should not be harmed

695
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:12,828
Cool down, Sadhu...
and let's get on with business

696
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:19,032
Quote your price and
get out son sent, acquitted

697
01:12:24,526 --> 01:12:27,855
Good evening. I'm DIG Verma

698
01:12:27,856 --> 01:12:30,519
Just dropped in to find out
if you're facing any problems?

699
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,892
No, everything's fine.
Just haven't heard about my daughter

700
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,012
She'll be found. You'll just
have to cooperate with us

701
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:39,427
Sir, me...

702
01:12:39,428 --> 01:12:42,716
These are bad people.
Sadhu and Sundar Yadav

703
01:12:42,717 --> 01:12:45,920
Withdraw your complaint, and
your daughter will come back to you

704
01:12:45,921 --> 01:12:49,834
Mr DIG, I've been through such hell
in these past three months...

705
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:58,324
what kind of future do you
foresee for her?

706
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:00,573
I'm never going to forgive that devil

707
01:13:00,574 --> 01:13:04,319
So what will you do? You are relying
on the support of SP Amit Kumar...

708
01:13:04,653 --> 01:13:07,982
who will be transferred soon
and Sundar Yadav ...

709
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,020
he has to get bail sooner or later.
Then?

710
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:14,142
Your daughter has already gone,
your son will follow too

711
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:17,305
Why are you screaming at my mother?
Don't say that, son

712
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:19,886
Tell them to go, mother

713
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:24,632
If you care about your son's safety,
change your statement

714
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:29,794
Keep an eye on her son

715
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:34,623
Till the end of time
Sadhu, your name will shine!

716
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:41,074
Long live Sundar!

717
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:48,650
Is the remand application ready?
It is

718
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,716
Your honour, there are already
some cases filed...

719
01:14:04,717 --> 01:14:06,923
against the accused Sundar Yadav

720
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:11,336
In Bhairavganj police station
C. R No 37-98...

721
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:15,540
under sections 307, 147, 148 and 149

722
01:14:15,915 --> 01:14:18,911
Your honour,
all the charges are baseless

723
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:22,907
No chargesheet has been filed as yet

724
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:25,695
The police is investigating
all the cases

725
01:14:25,696 --> 01:14:27,944
Your honour, there are 12 cases filed
against Sundar Yadav...

726
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:29,942
and are under investigation

727
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:32,939
If investigation has not been completed
for the past four-five years...

728
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,310
then what can you do now?
Today's hearing is for which case?

729
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:41,680
Your honour, C. R 63/2002 lodged
in the Tejpur police station...

730
01:14:42,055 --> 01:14:47,549
under section 363 and 376, sir. He has
been charged with the kidnapping...

731
01:14:47,966 --> 01:14:51,670
and rape of a minor girl
called Apoorva Kumari, your honour

732
01:14:52,045 --> 01:14:55,000
This is a lie, your honour

733
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,996
There's no mention of this incident
in the police records

734
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:04,366
Apoorva Kumari, who's been mentioned
here, lives in Gujarat...

735
01:15:04,824 --> 01:15:08,196
with her relatives.
And her mother endorses that

736
01:15:16,021 --> 01:15:19,558
Don't worry, lady... your daughter
has been returned, no?

737
01:15:19,559 --> 01:15:25,136
Your son is in my safe custody

738
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,003
This accusation is
totally false, your honour

739
01:15:33,004 --> 01:15:35,376
The police has neither
any evidence nor any witness

740
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:39,747
And the date being cited
is around 3 months ago

741
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:41,953
When was the FIR lodged?

742
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:43,909
The girl's mother is here

743
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:47,740
FIR was registered on 23th March.
The girl's mother is present in court

744
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:54,023
Sir, that girl has reached here.
Who?

745
01:15:54,024 --> 01:15:59,976
Apoorva, sir... her daughter.
She's sitting here

746
01:16:06,554 --> 01:16:11,758
You got this FIR written?

747
01:16:13,963 --> 01:16:17,084
Please ask her where her daughter is

748
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:21,954
Where is your daughter?

749
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:24,994
Please tell the judge where
your daughter is. Where has she gone?

750
01:16:26,784 --> 01:16:30,655
She has not gone anywhere, Mr Judge
...she's right here

751
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:37,064
So then this complaint... this FIR?

752
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:43,184
Please don't waste
the court's time

753
01:16:48,886 --> 01:16:52,383
Don't be scared. Even if
your daughter has come back...

754
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:59,084
tell the court the truth.
After bearing such insults...

755
01:16:59,085 --> 01:17:01,956
if you are still not going
to help the police...

756
01:17:01,957 --> 01:17:05,703
then the police is also going to
lose faith in the public. Look...

757
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:10,365
I have nothing to say, Mr SP.
My daughter didn't go anywhere

758
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:15,194
I didn't make any complaint.
Please just let me go

759
01:17:16,692 --> 01:17:19,938
SP Amit Kumar must be restrained
He is provoking her to lie

760
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:24,142
He has no right to misuse
his position and power

761
01:17:24,143 --> 01:17:26,723
I'm not doing any such thing,
your honour

762
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:30,803
If she changes her stance,
we cannot punish the criminals

763
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:34,465
I'm only asking her to tell the truth.
The truth, Mr SP is that...

764
01:17:34,466 --> 01:17:36,838
ever since you came to Tejpur...

765
01:17:36,838 --> 01:17:40,710
for some personal reasons you have
been after my client Sundar Yadav

766
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:44,122
You have been harassing him
because of some personal vendetta

767
01:17:44,123 --> 01:17:46,952
This is completely wrong your honour,
the police is just doing its job

768
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:50,157
Distinguishing between right and wrong,
Mr Amit Kumar is what I'm doing

769
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,363
If you try to disturb
the court proceedings...

770
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:59,233
I shall charge you
with contempt of court

771
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:08,181
I'm warning the police...

772
01:18:08,182 --> 01:18:10,512
against arresting people
based on false accusations...

773
01:18:10,513 --> 01:18:15,924
and wasting the court's
precious time like this

774
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:23,292
The defendant is declared not guilty
and is hereby released

775
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,137
Don't let this traitor Yadav go

776
01:18:52,138 --> 01:18:54,926
I'll give him a dog's death

777
01:18:54,927 --> 01:18:58,340
Just give me the orders, Sundar.
I'll hack him to pieces right here

778
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:26,728
Greetings, mother-in-law.
You've already started crying?

779
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:30,432
Your daughter has not
even been sent off

780
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:35,761
Take care of my sweetheart.
I'll come soon

781
01:19:40,423 --> 01:19:44,085
The job of the police
is to maintain peace and security

782
01:19:44,086 --> 01:19:46,250
If you are going to get excited...

783
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:51,078
like a bunch of school kids
and create scenes, we're done for

784
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:54,990
What was the need for this,
may I ask? What did you gain?

785
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:59,070
The police was discredited
in open court

786
01:19:59,071 --> 01:20:01,401
I'm sitting at
the Division Headquarters...

787
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:05,896
ask me who has to be arrested,
what action has to be taken

788
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:09,644
Just because the minister praised you
in public, it's gone to your head

789
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:12,432
How does it concern him?
He'll praise you and go

790
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:17,885
We have to suffer the consequences

791
01:20:36,576 --> 01:20:42,569
Listen, now stop it

792
01:20:46,191 --> 01:20:49,520
The food has been
heated thrice, Amit...

793
01:20:49,521 --> 01:20:54,432
You eat, I'm not hungry

794
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:58,345
What's happening to you, Amit?
Why this enmity with food?

795
01:21:00,676 --> 01:21:04,338
Enmity? What do you mean?

796
01:21:04,339 --> 01:21:08,127
Who am I dead against?
You?

797
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:13,204
This house? This society?

798
01:21:13,205 --> 01:21:17,118
That mother and daughter?
Or am I against my own department?

799
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:24,111
Whom?

800
01:21:28,315 --> 01:21:32,310
I'm only doing my duty...

801
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:35,099
and I have become everyone's
sworn enemy

802
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:39,637
Criminals bloody all of them.
All impotent cowards

803
01:21:43,217 --> 01:21:48,129
That DIG Verma he says
be nice and affectionate

804
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:54,164
Nice and affectionate, my foot!

805
01:21:57,702 --> 01:22:00,324
The DIG drops in at her place
at midnight and threatens the widow

806
01:22:00,325 --> 01:22:04,112
Sadhu's dog!

807
01:22:04,113 --> 01:22:07,234
He wants me to be practical

808
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:12,645
What enmity are you talking about?

809
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:30,420
Go and have dinner. I'm not hungry

810
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,978
There is a message
for the night patrol

811
01:22:53,979 --> 01:22:57,724
Reach lal Chowk immediately.
Some disturbance

812
01:22:57,725 --> 01:23:00,514
Insp. Pandey on the line.
Received the Control Room message

813
01:23:00,514 --> 01:23:05,509
We are reaching Lal Chowk

814
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:19,246
Pull out the bastard.
He barks too much. Motherfucker

815
01:23:21,328 --> 01:23:27,779
I've had enough of his wise-cracks
about Sadhu Baba

816
01:25:11,342 --> 01:25:13,297
Sir, shall we make an entry?

817
01:25:13,298 --> 01:25:17,377
No, let the bastards rot here...
we'll see tomorrow

818
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:45,640
What were you saying
in court, motherfucker?

819
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,055
Exactly what you heard, you traitor

820
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:56,545
Bachha Yadav, watch out!

821
01:25:56,546 --> 01:26:00,417
Shut up, motherfucker

822
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,623
Hey... don't you dare abuse me

823
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:07,410
Who are you glaring at, you bastard?
Prajapati, open the lock-up

824
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:49,534
Bachha Yadav

825
01:26:49,535 --> 01:26:54,072
Showing me his eyes, motherfucker
Yeah... so you'll pull them out?

826
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:17,465
Showing me his eyes, motherfucker.
I'll smash them

827
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:24,834
Open bastard, bloody open!
I'll burn the bastard with acid!

828
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:39,818
What is this?

829
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:45,854
Gangaajal.
We'll bloody purify Tejpur today

830
01:28:39,425 --> 01:28:41,631
They are in such pain
they are not able to speak

831
01:28:41,632 --> 01:28:47,043
They won't be able to testify

832
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:54,036
Their eyes have been smashed with
a pointed weapon, then burnt with acid

833
01:29:04,858 --> 01:29:07,688
Who has done this?
Nobody is speaking up, sir

834
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:10,935
I want names, not your
unhelpful silence

835
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:17,678
Whoever has done this...

836
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:23,506
I'm not going to spare him

837
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,832
Which police officers
are responsible for this act?

838
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:35,702
Sir, you can't just leave like this
without giving any replies

839
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:42,154
It's your responsibility sir,
you will have to reply

840
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:46,691
What reply do you want?

841
01:29:46,692 --> 01:29:48,730
Sir, last night at Lal Chowk...

842
01:29:48,731 --> 01:29:52,477
the way you behaved with Munna Thakur
and Kesari Dalal... we can guess...

843
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:55,390
Don't make guesses.
Whatever transpired last night...

844
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:58,638
is being investigated and you
will get the correct reply

845
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:07,670
This incident happened in your
station, Tiwari. It wasn't right

846
01:30:08,752 --> 01:30:11,748
I had gone off duty, Sundar

847
01:30:11,749 --> 01:30:15,329
Just tell me who all
were involved in this?

848
01:30:17,743 --> 01:30:19,740
We were not there Sadhu Baba

849
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:22,321
There were twelve more inmates
in the lock-up

850
01:30:22,322 --> 01:30:24,735
They had a fight among themselves
at night...

851
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:27,732
the electricity went off at that time
...God knows how it happened

852
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:35,642
Don't fuck with me.
Look, my blood is boiling

853
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:41,095
Just tell me straight whether
Bachha Yadav was there or not

854
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:45,840
Why are you scared Tiwari.
I'm there, no?

855
01:30:49,087 --> 01:30:52,749
None of us was here

856
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,121
Till when will the sacrificial
lamb's mother rejoice, Tiwari?

857
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:57,245
The day Munna and Kesari come back
to their senses...

858
01:30:57,246 --> 01:30:59,409
and give their statements
...till that day

859
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,573
If anyone opens his mouth,
he'll be killed

860
01:31:01,574 --> 01:31:04,779
Won't breathe a word.
Did you see anything?

861
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:07,776
Didn't see anything, sir

862
01:31:07,777 --> 01:31:11,232
And you? Not a word!
You dig?

863
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:15,227
Why don't you speak, motherfucker?
Cat's caught your tongue or what?

864
01:31:15,228 --> 01:31:17,807
Won't talk, sir. Will die
but won't open my mouth

865
01:31:17,808 --> 01:31:21,388
Let him go, Tiwari.
Kali Pahalwan keeps his word

866
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:24,800
Hey, he won't speak,
some other bastard will

867
01:31:24,801 --> 01:31:31,711
No one will talk, if our jobs
come under threat we'll create havoc

868
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:33,875
You all better remember

869
01:31:33,876 --> 01:31:36,830
Did you all notice one thing?
Not even one FIR has been lodged...

870
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:39,994
in Tejpur Police Station today

871
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:43,032
Bloody no incidents.
How can anything happen, sir?

872
01:31:43,033 --> 01:31:45,322
Every bloody person is shitting bricks
because of the fear of Gangaajal

873
01:31:45,323 --> 01:31:47,861
Just that...
don't open your mouth... remember

874
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:52,106
Will do. Kali will not disclose last
night's incident till the day he dies

875
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:55,562
Agreed, crime is on decline,
but what kind of law is this...

876
01:31:55,854 --> 01:31:58,850
that people's eyes are smashed
in police custody?

877
01:31:58,851 --> 01:32:02,181
Why? Isn't chopping of a thief's hand
legal punishment in many countries?

878
01:32:02,555 --> 01:32:06,759
Brother, the right thing is happening
in Tejpur and now it will continue

879
01:32:13,878 --> 01:32:17,081
Blind law of Tejpur

880
01:32:17,082 --> 01:32:19,871
Looks like Rabidas has totally
made up his mind to be a martyr

881
01:32:19,872 --> 01:32:24,659
Come on...

882
01:32:29,653 --> 01:32:32,775
I'm going to interview the priest
at the mosque in Shahpura

883
01:32:34,357 --> 01:32:40,309
Come out... Tejpur Express

884
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:49,717
You wait here,
I'll just see...

885
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:06,282
What are these rumours that you are
spreading? It'll cost you dearly

886
01:33:06,283 --> 01:33:08,946
Rumours? Where...

887
01:33:08,947 --> 01:33:11,943
So then what epic are you writing?
Hey, the first time the police...

888
01:33:11,944 --> 01:33:14,940
has done the right thing
and you still have a problem

889
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:18,146
I publish a newspaper
for all of you only

890
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:24,889
If you have any contradictory news,
I'll print that too

891
01:33:25,722 --> 01:33:29,884
But publishing the correct news
is my duty, also my right

892
01:33:30,925 --> 01:33:32,922
How can you suppress that?

893
01:33:32,923 --> 01:33:34,629
Will definitely
suppress it, Mr Editor

894
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,918
If you write anything
against Amit Kumar ever again...

895
01:33:36,919 --> 01:33:39,749
neither you nor your paper
will survive

896
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,246
This is completely unfair, brother

897
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:46,867
And publishing this is incorrect news,
blaming the police, isn't that unfair?

898
01:33:47,492 --> 01:33:49,947
You think you can print
any damn thing?

899
01:33:49,948 --> 01:33:51,945
Do you see what is happening?

900
01:33:51,946 --> 01:33:57,732
Why don't you tell your father
to keep silent?

901
01:34:16,837 --> 01:34:19,876
We are not going to tolerate
this drama anymore. Remember that!

902
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:23,872
If you don't come back to your senses
then from Rabidas you'll become Surdas

903
01:34:30,823 --> 01:34:34,152
Those two deserved the acid
Mr Chowdhary

904
01:34:34,153 --> 01:34:37,567
Thefts! Dacoity! Murders!
They have ruined this town!

905
01:34:38,025 --> 01:34:41,479
You are worrying for no reasons.
Those two are bloody criminals!

906
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,810
The police and the law
is not going to do any good

907
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,016
Decide this matter here itself

908
01:34:46,017 --> 01:34:49,597
Why don't you people understand?
Sir will fire me

909
01:34:50,013 --> 01:34:53,259
How will he find out? Haven't you
heard what happened in Tejpur?

910
01:34:55,716 --> 01:34:59,003
Now don't waste time.
Bring both of them out

911
01:34:59,004 --> 01:35:04,789
Why bring them out?
Do it inside if you want to

912
01:35:51,493 --> 01:35:54,531
Hey Neta, leave the girl's hands

913
01:35:54,532 --> 01:35:59,942
Anyone say something?

914
01:36:05,187 --> 01:36:09,265
No one will move forward

915
01:36:09,266 --> 01:36:14,636
Catch the bastards and smash them all

916
01:38:13,309 --> 01:38:16,432
I apologise, sir. By mistake
your wife had an accident

917
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,966
You do whatever you want to do, sir

918
01:38:21,967 --> 01:38:26,171
Kill me if you want but this is
what will happen in Tejpur

919
01:38:27,254 --> 01:38:32,165
Now if anyone eyes my sister then he
will get only one response Gangaajal

920
01:38:52,769 --> 01:38:55,266
Why have you brought the car here?
It's the Shikarpur Police Station

921
01:38:55,267 --> 01:39:00,096
Carry on

922
01:39:00,262 --> 01:39:02,758
Mr Inspector,
sir's car just passed by

923
01:39:02,759 --> 01:39:04,756
What are you saying?
Why didn't they stop here?

924
01:39:04,757 --> 01:39:07,255
God knows!
But sir himself was sitting

925
01:39:07,256 --> 01:39:09,378
Seems like there's some
fresh trouble brewing. Get my cap

926
01:39:09,379 --> 01:39:14,206
Get the car

927
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:33,437
Find out where their houses are

928
01:39:33,438 --> 01:39:35,808
Where does he stay?

929
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:42,053
Come on... there...
shoo away these bastards

930
01:39:48,755 --> 01:39:54,333
Sir, it's his wife.
We haven't done anything

931
01:39:54,334 --> 01:39:57,621
Tell her to stop this crying business.
Ask her where those people are

932
01:40:12,357 --> 01:40:15,270
Go quickly, catch hold
of both of them

933
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:21,764
If you guys squeal,
I'll bury your families alive. Dig?

934
01:40:26,925 --> 01:40:30,256
Sir, what's the matter?

935
01:40:30,838 --> 01:40:33,960
You all are not required here.
And Chowdhary, go to the station

936
01:40:34,377 --> 01:40:39,579
I'll talk to you later

937
01:40:43,658 --> 01:40:47,029
Ask him only, sir.
She is his wife

938
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:50,901
Hey, what will she say, Mr SP? Ask me
about the games these devils play

939
01:40:51,817 --> 01:40:55,855
Can you see her?
She is Bansuriya, my daughter

940
01:40:56,147 --> 01:41:00,975
Hey, who's that? What is she saying?
Keep shut, bloody bastard!

941
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:03,470
Hey, speak courteously
in front of the SP

942
01:41:03,471 --> 01:41:05,719
Today you are teaching me manner,
Mr Policeman

943
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,174
What happened that day when
I was getting her married?

944
01:41:09,175 --> 01:41:13,295
Not a soul from the police station
even came to take a glimpse

945
01:41:13,296 --> 01:41:19,290
Somehow I just got her married.
I sent off a corpse

946
01:41:20,413 --> 01:41:26,117
God knows how he knew... stopped
the car in the middle of the road...

947
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:28,821
and stabbed seven of the groom's men

948
01:41:28,822 --> 01:41:33,650
Our son-in-law was knifed in the middle
of the road. His hands and legs tied

949
01:41:34,482 --> 01:41:40,685
He ruined my flower-like daughter
in front of everyone

950
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:45,888
Then he took the same car and ran over
my son-in-law's body... this sinner!

951
01:41:48,593 --> 01:41:53,672
He has been meted out justice.
He won't even find place in hell

952
01:41:55,711 --> 01:41:58,666
Who did this to you?

953
01:41:58,667 --> 01:42:00,497
Why don't you talk?

954
01:42:00,498 --> 01:42:04,037
Nothing has happened over here, sir.
He was already blind

955
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:09,446
Put them into the jeep.
Take them to Tejpur. We'll talk there

956
01:42:09,447 --> 01:42:13,318
We have done nothing

957
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:16,481
Why are you worrying, Mr Chowdhary?

958
01:42:16,482 --> 01:42:22,518
Each and every child
of Shikarpur is with you

959
01:42:30,551 --> 01:42:35,879
You found out?

960
01:42:36,462 --> 01:42:39,751
Amit, did you find out?
Find out what?

961
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:43,747
Who were the ones who smashed them
and then burnt their eyes with acid?

962
01:42:47,576 --> 01:42:49,573
I'm... investigating the incident

963
01:42:49,574 --> 01:42:52,945
Investigating the incident!
But how can they do this?

964
01:42:52,946 --> 01:42:56,400
Your police can do whatever it wants,
even animals don't behave like this

965
01:42:58,857 --> 01:43:01,312
Anuradha, please try to understand

966
01:43:01,312 --> 01:43:03,517
Their people who have suffered
in this incident were criminals

967
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:05,515
Murder, rape and dacoity
was their profession

968
01:43:05,516 --> 01:43:08,930
Oh! So they have the right to smash
the eyes of the accused... wow!

969
01:43:10,928 --> 01:43:13,340
I'm not saying that
this action is right

970
01:43:13,341 --> 01:43:15,630
Whatever they have done is wrong
and they will be duly punished

971
01:43:15,631 --> 01:43:17,503
What action are you taking?

972
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,126
Please! I know what has to be done.
I'm aware of my responsibilities

973
01:43:22,499 --> 01:43:25,621
You don't need to worry.
The truth will out on its own

974
01:43:30,533 --> 01:43:33,529
Munna Thakur and Kesari Dalal
have given their statements

975
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:37,525
All of you have been accused
of being involved in the incident

976
01:43:37,526 --> 01:43:43,436
I'm going to take action,
do you have anything to say?

977
01:43:43,437 --> 01:43:46,183
Why don't you all speak?

978
01:43:46,184 --> 01:43:51,553
No sir, we have nothing to say

979
01:43:51,554 --> 01:43:54,717
And Chowdhary? The Shikarpur Station
incident happened in your presence

980
01:43:54,718 --> 01:43:59,254
No sir, check the FIR book,
there is no entry of these

981
01:43:59,254 --> 01:44:02,835
You can do a full enquiry yourself.
There is no accusation against me

982
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:08,495
You are lying.
No sir, you can ask anyone

983
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,615
And you have also written
in your statement...

984
01:44:12,616 --> 01:44:17,610
that these two were not there
in the police station that night

985
01:44:17,611 --> 01:44:21,066
Sir, you had only told us
not to make an entry in the diary

986
01:44:21,607 --> 01:44:26,976
And that's why you all did this

987
01:44:26,977 --> 01:44:30,639
Do you all possess
something called humanity?

988
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:34,011
You all have committed a crime
and now you're lying like cowards

989
01:44:34,803 --> 01:44:37,548
I myself am going to do an enquiry
and based on that...

990
01:44:37,549 --> 01:44:43,585
I'll file a case against you

991
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:47,082
It's a dog's life!
Shameful and humiliating!

992
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:51,618
Keep quiet, and the public yells.
Do something, and the boss yells

993
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,699
The criminals command more respect.
They are not answerable to anyone

994
01:44:55,115 --> 01:44:58,195
I don't get it either. An incident
occurred inside our police station...

995
01:44:58,612 --> 01:45:01,900
So what? Why are you nervous, Tiwari?

996
01:45:03,107 --> 01:45:06,187
You guys stay out of this.
I'll take the entire responsibility

997
01:45:06,604 --> 01:45:09,642
What will the SP do?
Suspend me, right? I'd be better off

998
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:14,428
Can't live any longer like an eunuch.
Wonderful

999
01:45:14,429 --> 01:45:18,550
Great. We'll make a memorial
for you right inside the premises

1000
01:45:19,549 --> 01:45:21,755
Martyr Bholanath Pandey

1001
01:45:21,756 --> 01:45:25,542
Stop racking your brains

1002
01:45:25,543 --> 01:45:28,873
I have decided on it.
My statement is ready

1003
01:45:29,664 --> 01:45:33,993
I'm going to keep it in the SP's table.
Hey! You alone? Why must you?

1004
01:45:34,409 --> 01:45:37,989
Tiwari, I'm doing this because
I was the one who smashed their eyes

1005
01:45:38,697 --> 01:45:41,859
Besides, I don't regret one bit
what I did

1006
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:45,024
I have written, for everyone's sake.
Bachha, don't act in haste

1007
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,685
Khan, I've resolved

1008
01:45:49,686 --> 01:45:54,680
Let's see what happens

1009
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:59,884
He's out of his mind

1010
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:40,635
What's the matter?
Why weren't you picking up the phone?

1011
01:46:44,172 --> 01:46:49,584
Where is Babua?

1012
01:46:53,788 --> 01:46:59,157
Look there, daddy has come

1013
01:47:25,589 --> 01:47:28,836
Why did you betray me?
Motherfucker! Talk!

1014
01:47:36,578 --> 01:47:41,365
Somebody help!

1015
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:06,715
Treated you like my brother. But you?
I had to you, motherfucker...

1016
01:48:07,131 --> 01:48:12,876
I'll slaughter you like a pig

1017
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:18,660
An eye for an eye

1018
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:22,823
Daddy

1019
01:48:22,824 --> 01:48:26,070
Daddy... daddy

1020
01:48:41,722 --> 01:48:44,760
Just let me see him once

1021
01:48:56,874 --> 01:49:02,117
Just let me see him once

1022
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:33,462
Send it for postmortem

1023
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:43,225
Use all our resources.
This time he shouldn't get away

1024
01:51:08,991 --> 01:51:12,029
Tell me, motherfucker!
Where is Sundar?

1025
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:14,068
I don't know.
Tell me, bastards

1026
01:51:14,069 --> 01:51:18,023
I don't know

1027
01:51:18,024 --> 01:51:22,977
Tell me

1028
01:51:23,019 --> 01:51:27,431
Get him.

1029
01:51:54,778 --> 01:51:57,692
Sir, I've searched everywhere.
He didn't come here

1030
01:51:57,693 --> 01:52:02,271
Where'll he go? Get hold
of every single man of his

1031
01:52:02,812 --> 01:52:05,142
Yes sir

1032
01:52:05,143 --> 01:52:07,015
Sorry... not right now

1033
01:52:07,016 --> 01:52:12,801
I want the bastard
and his four accomplices

1034
01:52:16,382 --> 01:52:18,837
Cut the crap, Bhurelal!
What've you guys been doing?

1035
01:52:18,838 --> 01:52:22,792
We've been raiding the places, sir.
We are trying. I mean...

1036
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:25,414
What do you mean? You still
haven't got any information...

1037
01:52:25,415 --> 01:52:28,077
about Sundar
and his four accomplices?

1038
01:52:28,078 --> 01:52:32,990
Go right now and bring Sadhu Yadav
here, now he'll tell us

1039
01:52:37,069 --> 01:52:43,480
Didn't you hear? I want him now
in the headquarter

1040
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:49,474
Don't come inside,
there's too much smoke

1041
01:52:55,926 --> 01:52:59,421
What is happening, Amit?

1042
01:52:59,422 --> 01:53:04,833
You can carry on,
I'll just come

1043
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:07,080
Are you a woman or what?

1044
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:10,826
Keep drilling the bastards until
they open their mouths. Whack them!

1045
01:53:10,827 --> 01:53:13,241
I want the whereabouts
of Bachha Yadav's murderers

1046
01:53:13,242 --> 01:53:18,570
Whack them again
when they come around!

1047
01:53:35,595 --> 01:53:38,798
You are just not worthy
of this light!

1048
01:53:38,799 --> 01:53:44,044
Bring them inside

1049
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:58,363
Where is Sundar?

1050
01:53:58,654 --> 01:54:04,024
Where is Sundar?

1051
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:10,227
And where have you
hidden these four?

1052
01:54:10,602 --> 01:54:14,221
You all play this game
of hide and seek, SP

1053
01:54:14,222 --> 01:54:17,177
I do everything proudly,
on the open

1054
01:54:17,178 --> 01:54:20,757
If you have the guts, arrest me.
Sadhu doesn't get scared

1055
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:29,331
You haven't seen fear yet, Sadhu

1056
01:54:29,332 --> 01:54:32,786
If Sundar doesn't show up
in 24 hours...

1057
01:54:33,619 --> 01:54:36,823
I'll whack you so hard that you will
fear to look at your own reflection

1058
01:54:36,824 --> 01:54:41,154
What'll you do? Smash my eyes?
You'll kill me?

1059
01:54:44,192 --> 01:54:48,271
You will not be let off
so easily, Sadhu Yadav

1060
01:54:48,272 --> 01:54:51,436
Don't forget Sadhu
...twenty four hours

1061
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:37,348
If anyone lays even a finger on my son,
it will be disastrous, Mr DIG

1062
01:55:37,763 --> 01:55:39,677
Don't be immature, Sadhu

1063
01:55:39,678 --> 01:55:43,549
If Amit Kumar gets hold of Sundar,
then I won't be able to do anything

1064
01:55:43,549 --> 01:55:47,338
Do as I say. Let him surrender himself
in court and get bail

1065
01:55:48,254 --> 01:55:50,251
Send fifty lakhs to
the district judge

1066
01:55:50,252 --> 01:55:52,747
Fifty lakhs!

1067
01:55:52,748 --> 01:55:56,869
He was asking for a crore. Got it
halved with a lot of difficulty

1068
01:55:57,535 --> 01:56:02,365
50 percent should be delivered before
eight o'clock. Send the rest to me

1069
01:56:03,197 --> 01:56:08,899
DIG, I will send the money,
of course.

1070
01:56:11,022 --> 01:56:17,016
Once Sundar gets bail, DIG, then
watch how we deal with this crazy

1071
01:56:17,556 --> 01:56:21,429
You just arrange the money,
then give me a call

1072
01:56:25,965 --> 01:56:27,962
What was the time fixed?

1073
01:56:27,963 --> 01:56:31,750
He's left from there,
must be reaching

1074
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:37,413
Motherfucker, acting pricey...

1075
01:56:45,405 --> 01:56:47,692
What's the matter, Mr Yadav?
Everything okay...?

1076
01:56:47,693 --> 01:56:50,689
Forget about that,
there's no time

1077
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:54,395
You immediately go and deliver
the 25 lakhs to the district judge

1078
01:56:54,396 --> 01:56:57,641
25 lakhs, Mr Sadhu now,
at this time...

1079
01:56:58,392 --> 01:57:02,595
Before seven in the morning,
it should be on his breakfast table

1080
01:57:03,429 --> 01:57:06,049
I'm going to make arrangement
for the rest

1081
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:11,336
It's difficult, Sadhu Baba.
I can't do this at such short notice

1082
01:57:11,337 --> 01:57:16,123
What?

1083
01:57:17,872 --> 01:57:22,368
It's a question of my son.
I'll tear you to pieces

1084
01:57:24,489 --> 01:57:29,943
25 lakhs! District judge...
before seven in the morning

1085
01:59:00,228 --> 01:59:02,641
Our turn is about to come.
Where is Mr Sundar?

1086
01:59:02,642 --> 01:59:07,720
He'll be here any moment now

1087
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:30,322
Don't call out now

1088
02:00:31,553 --> 02:00:35,965
Catch him

1089
02:00:41,918 --> 02:00:46,954
Pick him up

1090
02:01:20,587 --> 02:01:21,918
Stop them!

1091
02:01:21,919 --> 02:01:25,540
They've taken him!
Stop them!

1092
02:01:26,082 --> 02:01:29,203
Now, nothing can be done, until
the police produce him over here

1093
02:01:29,495 --> 02:01:32,950
But this SP will eat him alive,
why don't you understand?

1094
02:01:33,241 --> 02:01:34,905
They'll smash his eye

1095
02:01:34,906 --> 02:01:37,986
The court can only do something if the
matter is presented in court, Mr Yadav

1096
02:01:38,402 --> 02:01:44,022
Bastard! You want to sleep, eh?

1097
02:01:44,605 --> 02:01:51,057
Motherfucker,
I'll make you yearn for sleep!

1098
02:02:24,856 --> 02:02:27,478
The police has continuously kept
Sundar Yadav in custody...

1099
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:29,850
three times for a period
of twelve days. Your honour...

1100
02:02:29,851 --> 02:02:32,681
what kind of investigation is going on
if it's still not complete?

1101
02:02:32,682 --> 02:02:36,595
There is no charge sheet till now,
no witness, no evidence

1102
02:02:36,844 --> 02:02:40,923
The police hasn't submitted any list of
the items found on the scene of crime

1103
02:02:41,423 --> 02:02:43,836
Please notice my client's
state, your honour

1104
02:02:43,837 --> 02:02:46,500
The police has taken his statement
seven times

1105
02:02:46,501 --> 02:02:48,831
Now he has nothing left to say
...nothing at all

1106
02:02:48,832 --> 02:02:51,953
Your honour, our investigation
is carrying on right now

1107
02:02:51,954 --> 02:02:56,616
Your honour, in the police custody
our client is in danger... with him...

1108
02:02:56,824 --> 02:02:58,697
There can be no bail
in these charges...

1109
02:02:58,698 --> 02:03:02,110
but the accused is to be sent
to judicial custody

1110
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:07,521
And, you all please
fill the charge sheets quickly

1111
02:03:24,213 --> 02:03:25,794
How are you all?

1112
02:03:25,795 --> 02:03:30,747
Forgive us! Right inside the court
I proved you a liar

1113
02:03:30,748 --> 02:03:34,328
Everyday I used to tell mother,
let's go to the SP

1114
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:39,073
Hey, what are you saying? Don't you
think I understand your compulsions?

1115
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:45,858
Have you seen a guy for her or no?
Get her married

1116
02:03:48,523 --> 02:03:53,975
Don't spare Sundar Yadav, sir

1117
02:03:53,976 --> 02:03:56,763
SP Amit Kumar!
Long live! Long live!

1118
02:03:56,764 --> 02:04:02,633
Tejpur Police
Long live! Long live!

1119
02:04:23,946 --> 02:04:26,067
Has sir come?
Yes, ma'am

1120
02:04:26,068 --> 02:04:27,774
Gave him tea?
Asked him...

1121
02:04:27,775 --> 02:04:33,019
he said he'd wait for you

1122
02:04:56,829 --> 02:05:02,532
You've come early today?

1123
02:05:12,105 --> 02:05:16,059
What is this twice a day affair
with God these days?

1124
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:23,968
I go so that some prayers
get answered

1125
02:05:35,874 --> 02:05:40,285
Please... I'm sorry

1126
02:05:40,286 --> 02:05:45,863
What is my fault?
Why have you become like this?

1127
02:05:45,864 --> 02:05:48,818
How can I live like this?

1128
02:05:48,819 --> 02:05:52,856
You've cut me off and discarded me.
I am nothing to you

1129
02:05:52,857 --> 02:05:58,601
Tell me, how do I live
with this fear?

1130
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:06,301
I can't live like this

1131
02:06:17,914 --> 02:06:23,659
Hey Manasi, he has come

1132
02:06:26,989 --> 02:06:31,735
Jai Hind

1133
02:06:38,935 --> 02:06:41,931
Do have some paan, sir.
It's the special peppermint

1134
02:06:41,932 --> 02:06:43,929
I don't eat paan

1135
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:47,510
This is not paan, sir, it's a
refreshment. It'll refresh your mind

1136
02:06:50,174 --> 02:06:55,752
Hey, hurry up, sir is leaving

1137
02:06:57,916 --> 02:06:59,913
Hot tea!

1138
02:06:59,914 --> 02:07:05,367
Manganiram's son

1139
02:07:18,853 --> 02:07:23,224
Honest Tea Vendor. Please take it.
It's made with pure milk

1140
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:27,968
And I'm selling it
at the cheapest rate in the market

1141
02:07:27,969 --> 02:07:31,049
He's our number two, sir.
Number one comes here for good night

1142
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:34,961
Number two for good morning

1143
02:07:34,962 --> 02:07:38,626
An honest effort, sir
When do they go to school?

1144
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:41,871
What'll they do in school, sir?
If they study...

1145
02:07:41,872 --> 02:07:45,285
then they won't even do manual work.
Sir, taste the tea please

1146
02:07:47,991 --> 02:07:51,613
On one condition. Send both
your children back to school

1147
02:07:54,693 --> 02:08:00,728
And come for duty tomorrow onwards

1148
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:07,472
It's good

1149
02:08:42,145 --> 02:08:45,975
The matter is out of my hands.
Do something quickly...

1150
02:08:46,141 --> 02:08:49,596
otherwise it will be difficult
to last out the remand period

1151
02:08:50,303 --> 02:08:56,131
I've heard, Gangaajal...

1152
02:09:04,747 --> 02:09:09,326
You amaze me Mr DIG. You compiled such
a huge file and didn't even inform me

1153
02:09:12,407 --> 02:09:14,612
But you yourself had
congratulated him, sir

1154
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:17,109
That's what I have come to regret

1155
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:20,524
SP Amit Kumar, what do you think
of yourself?

1156
02:09:20,773 --> 02:09:23,103
I gave you a district for free,
recommending you...

1157
02:09:23,104 --> 02:09:26,809
for the President's medal.
And what do you do...

1158
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:29,597
go ahead and ensure that my position
itself is threatened

1159
02:09:29,598 --> 02:09:33,093
I'm sorry about whatever
happened in Tejpur, sir

1160
02:09:33,094 --> 02:09:35,923
But I'm investigating each and every
incident myself and soon enough I'II...

1161
02:09:35,924 --> 02:09:39,087
That's what I'm not being able
to understand...

1162
02:09:39,088 --> 02:09:41,751
why are you doing
this double mistake?

1163
02:09:41,752 --> 02:09:44,831
First of all your formula
to decrease crime...

1164
02:09:44,832 --> 02:09:47,079
and then on top of that
this enquiry

1165
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:51,409
Why are you throwing stones into mud,
who'll get dirty with the splashes?

1166
02:09:57,111 --> 02:09:59,982
Okay Mr Minister, stop this politics
of yours and get on with my work

1167
02:09:59,983 --> 02:10:02,105
That's exactly
what I'm doing, brother

1168
02:10:02,106 --> 02:10:05,686
Listen, stop this
investigation immediately

1169
02:10:05,686 --> 02:10:10,057
When the public is not complaining
then there is no need to

1170
02:10:10,474 --> 02:10:13,470
You just get bail for Sundar Yadav

1171
02:10:13,471 --> 02:10:17,132
What!
Yes, he's in great danger

1172
02:10:17,133 --> 02:10:19,214
Everyday these people
threaten to smash his eyes

1173
02:10:19,215 --> 02:10:23,376
Why are you interrupting?
I'm speaking to him, no?

1174
02:10:23,377 --> 02:10:27,373
Listen, get him bail
and give me the report

1175
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:32,743
Didn't you hear? Tomorrow is
Sundar's date, he has to get bail

1176
02:10:36,821 --> 02:10:40,859
Sir, he can't get bail.
Why, what's the problem?

1177
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:44,439
Sir, he's the one who murdered
Sub-Insp. Bachha Yadav

1178
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:48,185
Then tell me the cost.
What do you want?

1179
02:10:48,186 --> 02:10:52,098
Sadhu Yadav, you don't have the stature
to pay the price of Bachha Yadav

1180
02:10:53,181 --> 02:10:59,174
Anyway, what have you paid
the minister?

1181
02:10:59,175 --> 02:11:01,505
Whatever you want to do, do it

1182
02:11:01,506 --> 02:11:07,583
While I'm there, Sundar Yadav
will not get bail

1183
02:11:13,202 --> 02:11:18,655
You won't survive, SP

1184
02:11:32,434 --> 02:11:35,929
I know the public of Tejpur
has suffered great injustice

1185
02:11:36,513 --> 02:11:38,883
But Amit Kumar
was your favoured officer

1186
02:11:38,884 --> 02:11:41,340
You had sent his name
for the President's medal

1187
02:11:41,341 --> 02:11:44,795
Listen, we want peace and security
but not at this cost

1188
02:11:45,295 --> 02:11:48,250
But what action
is the government taking?

1189
02:11:48,251 --> 02:11:53,162
I will initiate an independent
enquiry by a former high court judge

1190
02:11:54,245 --> 02:11:59,156
During this period all the six suspected
police officers have been suspended...

1191
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:03,235
and the SP of Tejpur, Amit Kumar,
has been given orders...

1192
02:12:03,236 --> 02:12:05,940
to go on leave immediately.
The commission's report will be...

1193
02:12:05,941 --> 02:12:08,438
submitted to the government
within one month

1194
02:12:08,439 --> 02:12:13,932
What does this forced leave mean?

1195
02:12:13,933 --> 02:12:17,678
It means I can't go to office,
can't work...

1196
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:21,258
assume I'm not on my post at all

1197
02:12:21,259 --> 02:12:24,256
Now what'll happen Amit?

1198
02:12:24,257 --> 02:12:27,835
Nothing... the commission's
enquiry will begin...

1199
02:12:28,543 --> 02:12:32,207
Once I've given my statement
we'll go from here

1200
02:12:35,079 --> 02:12:38,242
You'll stay with the police only?

1201
02:12:38,243 --> 02:12:42,279
Why? Are you afraid?

1202
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:47,858
No, not now

1203
02:13:00,304 --> 02:13:03,549
The SP has gone now.
Lets see who saves you all

1204
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:10,710
Break it down. Bomb it

1205
02:13:20,326 --> 02:13:25,695
What's going on there?
Let see

1206
02:13:27,859 --> 02:13:32,979
Who are they, sister?

1207
02:13:36,351 --> 02:13:40,678
Hey hurry up.
You don't create any disturbance

1208
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:43,842
Till when will you keep
your daughter caged?

1209
02:13:43,843 --> 02:13:49,255
Listen to me carefully old woman.
If you betray Sundar, you'll be ruined

1210
02:13:59,785 --> 02:14:05,239
This was bound to happen

1211
02:14:06,653 --> 02:14:09,858
Writing this letter in blood,
don't mistake it for ink

1212
02:14:09,859 --> 02:14:12,022
And I swear on this blood that...

1213
02:14:12,023 --> 02:14:14,146
if you try to get Apoorva
married off to anyone then...

1214
02:14:14,147 --> 02:14:16,352
I'll wipe off your entire family

1215
02:14:16,353 --> 02:14:19,598
That oldie from Ghaziabad will not...
from Tejpur platform alive

1216
02:14:20,015 --> 02:14:22,720
Remember Apoorva is mine

1217
02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:25,926
Not one jail but I'll break several
forts and take her away

1218
02:14:26,384 --> 02:14:29,879
My name you must remember,
Sundar Yadav

1219
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:33,294
Must have committed some sin that
this problem has been born

1220
02:14:33,668 --> 02:14:35,623
If she died I'd be content

1221
02:14:35,624 --> 02:14:38,413
Does anyone curse their
daughter like this?

1222
02:14:38,413 --> 02:14:39,577
Sit

1223
02:14:39,578 --> 02:14:41,410
What should I do Mr. SP?

1224
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:44,323
This marriage was fixed
with great difficulty

1225
02:14:44,324 --> 02:14:47,861
My daughter has lost her dignity,
there's no one to help us

1226
02:14:47,862 --> 02:14:51,067
Somehow we found this guy.
So what if he's father of two...

1227
02:14:51,068 --> 02:14:56,604
has a shop in Ghaziabad...
Now this is her fatewhat shall I do?

1228
02:14:56,728 --> 02:14:59,432
You went to the police station?

1229
02:14:59,433 --> 02:15:02,429
Who'll listen to me when
you are not there?

1230
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:08,883
N0, its not like that.
The police will do its work

1231
02:15:10,422 --> 02:15:13,418
Police Station, Tejpur.
Who is the duty officer?

1232
02:15:13,419 --> 02:15:16,084
It's Insp. Mangani Ram sir.
How are you Mangani?

1233
02:15:16,085 --> 02:15:18,747
Sir, without you how'll I be...

1234
02:15:18,748 --> 02:15:21,245
Hey Mangani, its not like that.
Good I called up...

1235
02:15:21,246 --> 02:15:24,159
Roopmati's daughter Apoorva -
its her wedding

1236
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,906
I know sir.
This marriage shouldn't break

1237
02:15:26,907 --> 02:15:32,441
It won't break sir. Goodnight

1238
02:15:32,442 --> 02:15:34,773
Don't get involved in
this chaos, Tiwari

1239
02:15:34,774 --> 02:15:37,561
The enquiry commission's decision
will prove very harsh

1240
02:15:37,562 --> 02:15:41,101
That's why we've come to you. Somehow
get my name struck off the report

1241
02:15:41,516 --> 02:15:46,386
Let go to the DIG with some donation,
only he can do the needful

1242
02:16:03,828 --> 02:16:06,200
We won't let you go sir.
There'll be a revolt

1243
02:16:06,201 --> 02:16:08,864
We'll do a chakka jam

1244
02:16:08,865 --> 02:16:12,818
The government's decision is wrong.
We'll change it

1245
02:16:12,819 --> 02:16:16,148
Now, the public has awakened sir.
You'll get total support

1246
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:21,935
You also just support us blindly

1247
02:17:27,036 --> 02:17:32,448
Everything will be fine, Anu

1248
02:19:30,705 --> 02:19:34,992
Insp. Shahid Khan, do you accept
the charges levied against you?

1249
02:19:38,697 --> 02:19:43,650
I am innocent

1250
02:20:02,007 --> 02:20:07,749
Do you accept the charges
levied against you?

1251
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:12,744
Yes your honour,
I accept the charges

1252
02:20:12,745 --> 02:20:16,740
Do you find yourself guilty?

1253
02:20:16,741 --> 02:20:20,654
Yes, your honour, since I am the
Police Superintendent of Tejpur...

1254
02:20:20,988 --> 02:20:24,317
I take full responsibility for
whatsoever has happened here

1255
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:29,312
Mr. Amit Kumar, how would you like to
defend yourself? Some lawyer...

1256
02:20:29,604 --> 02:20:32,642
No your honour, I don't need any lawyer

1257
02:20:33,017 --> 02:20:36,430
Please file your replies in two days.
The hearing will continue

1258
02:20:40,759 --> 02:20:47,210
Sir we want to speak to you

1259
02:20:49,084 --> 02:20:53,745
Sir, its a question of our lives

1260
02:20:53,746 --> 02:20:57,368
There is no point Pandey.
You all do what you think is right ...

1261
02:20:57,742 --> 02:21:03,194
my stance will not change

1262
02:21:09,772 --> 02:21:13,226
We'll be ruined.
Why are you so worried?

1263
02:21:13,227 --> 02:21:16,223
His sole admitting won't matter.
They won't find any witness

1264
02:21:16,224 --> 02:21:21,552
and nothing will be proved

1265
02:21:27,795 --> 02:21:31,374
Today I'll definitely
take you with me son

1266
02:21:31,375 --> 02:21:34,913
What's the matter? You're not happy?

1267
02:21:34,914 --> 02:21:41,781
Today is her wedding if I don't get
bail today I'll break out of jail

1268
02:21:42,406 --> 02:21:48,483
Hey son, today no one is
going to stop your bail

1269
02:22:21,616 --> 02:22:25,862
As long as I am here
you cannot enter

1270
02:22:25,863 --> 02:22:31,815
Get out of my way!
I'll get you suspended

1271
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:40,930
I'll slaughter anyone
who dares to move

1272
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:44,884
Let her go

1273
02:22:44,885 --> 02:22:48,257
Why? You couldn't wait to get her
married? In too much of a hurry...

1274
02:22:49,547 --> 02:22:52,043
Someone please help

1275
02:22:52,044 --> 02:22:57,706
Let go of my sister

1276
02:22:59,911 --> 02:23:06,322
You're not doing the right thing...
Let go of my wife

1277
02:23:08,944 --> 02:23:12,065
Mangani Ram on the line sir.
Sundar Yadav has landed up here

1278
02:23:12,066 --> 02:23:17,478
Sir, please come here fast

1279
02:23:21,015 --> 02:23:23,928
Hey, what are you doing here, Mangani?

1280
02:23:23,929 --> 02:23:26,300
Sir, grave injustice has happened.
Sundar Yadav is kidnapping the girl

1281
02:23:26,301 --> 02:23:28,674
Come on.
So, why are you getting hassled?

1282
02:23:28,675 --> 02:23:30,588
And hadn't I sent you
to Lal Chowk for duty!

1283
02:23:30,589 --> 02:23:32,087
Save her, Mr DSP

1284
02:23:32,088 --> 02:23:38,373
You leave from here -
you'll get your share

1285
02:23:41,911 --> 02:23:44,075
No one will move forward

1286
02:23:44,076 --> 02:23:46,031
Stop being juvenile, Mangani-
don't be mad

1287
02:23:46,032 --> 02:23:50,527
That's enough Mr. DSP... even
the devil has some limits, but you...

1288
02:24:02,557 --> 02:24:04,096
Come on

1289
02:24:04,097 --> 02:24:06,719
Leave my daughter alone, devil.
Leave her!

1290
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:10,964
Hey, old women

1291
02:24:10,965 --> 02:24:16,377
Mother

1292
02:24:23,994 --> 02:24:27,656
Are you gone mad?

1293
02:24:27,657 --> 02:24:29,571
You'll injure your hand!
What are you doing?

1294
02:24:29,572 --> 02:24:32,359
What I should've done much earlier

1295
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:35,690
Don't come any further

1296
02:24:35,691 --> 02:24:38,937
All of you seem to be
enjoying this show.

1297
02:24:39,437 --> 02:24:42,141
Quietly, keep watching my disaster

1298
02:24:42,142 --> 02:24:45,346
Nor am I anyone's sister,
neither anyone's daughter?!

1299
02:24:45,347 --> 02:24:47,595
I am just filth, a dirty patch

1300
02:24:47,596 --> 02:24:53,006
Stop this theatrical show,
you'll cut your hand

1301
02:25:00,999 --> 02:25:04,287
It's all over

1302
02:25:05,494 --> 02:25:09,114
You ruined everything

1303
02:25:09,115 --> 02:25:14,277
Move

1304
02:25:29,137 --> 02:25:32,967
Don't be stubborn.
Let's go from here now

1305
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:14,072
Take them away

1306
02:27:14,073 --> 02:27:19,943
There's no need to take them anywhere.
We'll decide here itself

1307
02:27:20,858 --> 02:27:22,980
You leave them to us, sir...

1308
02:27:22,981 --> 02:27:25,769
Yes-yes. Leave them

1309
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:30,474
Today their saga will end here itself

1310
02:27:30,475 --> 02:27:36,177
We'll smash both the bastards

1311
02:27:43,170 --> 02:27:48,830
Back off

1312
02:28:06,188 --> 02:28:11,933
Hey, bring out the Gangaajal

1313
02:28:13,223 --> 02:28:19,258
Stop them

1314
02:28:26,584 --> 02:28:31,079
Hit them

1315
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:36,991
Praise to the Goddess Ganga

1316
02:28:41,445 --> 02:28:44,233
What is this that you are doing?
Have you gone mad?

1317
02:28:44,234 --> 02:28:46,231
Yes sir, we have all gone mad

1318
02:28:46,232 --> 02:28:48,521
And with this Gangaajal
we will purify our Tejpur

1319
02:28:48,522 --> 02:28:52,142
You are all diseased. That you attribute
this alkaline to Gangaajal and...

1320
02:28:52,434 --> 02:28:54,431
desecrate the Gangaajal

1321
02:28:54,432 --> 02:28:57,428
You have set afire the limitations of
a civilised society...

1322
02:28:57,429 --> 02:29:00,258
and your humanity in
the clasps of this acid.

1323
02:29:00,259 --> 02:29:03,214
Do you think this will
give you renunciation?

1324
02:29:03,215 --> 02:29:04,962
It will purify the land of Tejpur?

1325
02:29:04,963 --> 02:29:11,040
Whatever happens today
we will not spare them

1326
02:29:11,664 --> 02:29:15,576
Come to your senses! Don't forget,
with criminals in our custody...

1327
02:29:15,868 --> 02:29:19,114
delivering them to the halls of
justice healthy and alive is our duty

1328
02:29:19,115 --> 02:29:21,238
Sir. Whose well-being are you
talking about?

1329
02:29:21,239 --> 02:29:23,277
He is the one who
murdered Bachha Yadav

1330
02:29:23,278 --> 02:29:25,275
They are devils. You'll save them?

1331
02:29:25,276 --> 02:29:29,022
Khan, I'm not saving them but saving
society from becoming devilish

1332
02:29:29,562 --> 02:29:32,892
There's no custom of smashing eyes and
burning them with acid in our society

1333
02:29:32,893 --> 02:29:35,515
But there is no power
in our rules and laws, sir

1334
02:29:35,515 --> 02:29:37,887
They'll escape through courts
and legal proceedings

1335
02:29:37,888 --> 02:29:41,219
We are frail and not the law, Bansi

1336
02:29:41,634 --> 02:29:44,298
Our selfish motives have
deteriorated the law.

1337
02:29:44,299 --> 02:29:47,170
Else we would not have given
our mandate to such...

1338
02:29:47,171 --> 02:29:48,959
corrupt and blackmarketers...

1339
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:53,039
as our leaders who keep on insulting
the law and the society time and again

1340
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:57,534
And remember society gets its own kind
of Police, as the person appointed...

1341
02:29:58,202 --> 02:30:03,238
is one amongst the society,
selfish and weak

1342
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:06,193
That is the weakness we
have to uproot, Mr. SP

1343
02:30:06,194 --> 02:30:08,149
Today when the people of Tejpur
have made a decision about...

1344
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:10,022
the father and son why
are you interfering?

1345
02:30:10,023 --> 02:30:12,187
Because you have taken
the wrong decision

1346
02:30:12,188 --> 02:30:15,350
If you are going to take decision with
the help of terror, keeping humanity...

1347
02:30:15,351 --> 02:30:18,512
and law at stake,
that's dictatorship

1348
02:30:18,513 --> 02:30:21,552
It will not end at blinding
the criminals, as punishment

1349
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:25,590
In future even your genuine voice
of rebellion will be silenced

1350
02:30:26,007 --> 02:30:28,420
It will be all over

1351
02:30:28,421 --> 02:30:33,749
I have arrested these criminals.
And I shall treat them as per law

1352
02:30:34,374 --> 02:30:37,078
And if anyone stops me from
doing my duty...

1353
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:42,490
I will be very strict with him

1354
02:30:46,527 --> 02:30:50,981
Move!

1355
02:30:54,477 --> 02:30:59,765
Take them away

1356
02:32:05,949 --> 02:32:10,694
Stop it

1357
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:23,722
Don't come forward or
I'll cut off her head

1358
02:33:29,531 --> 02:33:32,861
The commission enquiry at length and
testimonies by hundreds of witnesses...

1359
02:33:32,862 --> 02:33:36,232
resulted in no outcome

1360
02:33:36,233 --> 02:33:39,438
Finally, all the accused policemen were
acquitted, and their duties restored

1361
02:33:40,311 --> 02:33:43,516
Whatever be the truth
according to Tejpur folks...

1362
02:33:43,517 --> 02:33:47,930
but Amit Kumar knew his facts,
which he held on to the last
