1
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,958
Someone is knocking the door.

2
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,646
Go away.

3
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:34,319
What's the matter?

4
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,323
She's 13 or 1 4 years old
and she's in labour.

5
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,317
Whatever it's she needs help.

6
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,320
She's not married.
l won't attend to her.

7
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,263
l can't help it.
l've no other choice.

8
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:08,268
Someone will take care of you.
You'll have a good life.

9
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:20,281
l'll cry for you everyday.

10
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,273
Hold the bag.

11
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,271
Quick! Quick!

12
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,228
A child!

13
00:07:53,598 --> 00:08:00,231
-Who's that?
-Run! Run!

14
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:07,233
Stop there!

15
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,252
-Look there!
-What is that?

16
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:24,251
Something is floating.

17
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:37,263
Hey, boys!
What's going on there?

18
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:43,277
What are you all up to?
Go away.

19
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:51,277
lt came in the goods train.
We took it out from there.

20
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,329
Surya!

21
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,334
Surya!

22
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,837
Why did my mother discard me?

23
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:52,271
Usually people only dump rubbish.
But my mother dumped me.

24
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:50,392
You made a mistake by
stopping at one.

25
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:55,265
lf you'd given birth to one more
son, 10 more villages would have<i>..</i>

26
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,265
prospered.

27
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,618
lt was not your fault.

28
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:16,123
l wonder how and
where that boy is!

29
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:29,292
Surya, don't.

30
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,590
-He beat up that Ramana.
-A real beating.

31
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,270
Get lost.

32
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:25,264
Do you know who's Ramana?

33
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:28,271
l don't care who he is.
You know what he did?

34
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:32,104
Come here.
Tell them.

35
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:38,482
He'd borrowed money from Ramana.
He couldn't pay his due this month.

36
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,483
Say why you couldn't pay.

37
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:47,696
My child had chicken pox. l'd spent
all my money for his treatment.

38
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,832
What did Ramanan tell you?
Say it!

39
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:55,198
He said, ''lt's alright if you don't
pay. Take good care of your child.''

40
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:56,900
''That's very important.''

41
00:16:57,108 --> 00:17:04,742
''But till you repay me the money,
let your wife stay with me.''

42
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:05,381
This is what he told me.

43
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:10,611
Then he held her by the hair and
dragged her right before my eyes.

44
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,913
Don't cry.

45
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:16,321
Everyone just stood by and watched.

46
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:19,018
Why? Because he's Devaraj's man.

47
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,097
Everyone is so scared
of that Devaraj.

48
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,860
What will that Devaraj do?

49
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,867
What will that Devaraj do?

50
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:47,655
This is not visiting hours.

51
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:55,064
Devaraj, why bother yourself?

52
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:03,802
Ramana<i>..</i> Ramana...

53
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:13,242
Dr Sir<i>..</i> -Will Ramana survive?

54
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:17,584
-Will he survive or not?
-l can't say.

55
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:25,894
-How did this happen?
-Deva, please be calm

56
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,861
Look at him first and
then talk to me.

57
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,298
How many of them got together
and did this?

58
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:33,936
One man

59
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,269
Who?

60
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:38,601
Banthalu!

61
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,777
Surya<i>......</i>

62
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,283
Go and bring him.

63
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:07,417
Devaraj wants to see you.
He told us to bring you

64
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:19,765
-Take off your hand.
-What'll you do if l don't?

65
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:30,435
What will you do?

66
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:09,413
Ask your Devaraj to come
here if he wants to see me.

67
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:20,788
My mother has been admitted to the
hospital. Dad has no money.

68
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,801
How much money do you have?
How about you?

69
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:29,564
That's all?
This is not enough.

70
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:41,374
Do you have any money?

71
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:44,380
-Don't lie.
-l really don't have any.

72
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:48,055
-Pass me that.
-That's my mother's

73
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,557
Come here!

74
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:55,357
This girl's mother is in hospital.
Her life is in danger. Give me.

75
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:58,830
You'll get your bangle back.
Give me.

76
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:31,066
Why are you crying?
This is just money.

77
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:16,941
Ramana is in hospital.

78
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,483
lf anything happens to him,
you won't be alive.

79
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,815
Devarajan!

80
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:34,828
What will you do? You'll
get your men to kill me?

81
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:38,900
Ask them to come. Before l die,
atleast ten of them will die

82
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,299
There must be justice.
Find out what your Ramana did.

83
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:46,237
What did he do?

84
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:48,344
-Banthalu!
-Er<i>.....</i>

85
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,676
Don't threaten the poor.

86
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:13,395
l don't know what Ramana did. But
he has been with me for ten years.

87
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:17,739
lf he doesn't return from the
hospital, you won't be alive.

88
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:55,165
l don't want this.
l can't take it back home.

89
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:57,899
l lied to my dad
that l'd lost it.

90
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,905
Why don't you give it to
that girl's mother?

91
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:05,914
-What's your name?
-Subbu.

92
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,243
Subbulaksmi.

93
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,910
lf you want to do a good deed,
do it yourself.

94
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:14,081
Understand?

95
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:58,619
lt seems Ramana has died.
The police have come for you.

96
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,834
-What's your name?
-Surya.

97
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:13,406
What's your father's name?

98
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:23,053
Can't you hear?
What's your father's name?

99
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:26,614
-Don't know.

100
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,216
What's your mother's name?

101
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:33,021
Don't know.

102
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,695
You don't know your father's
name or mother's name.

103
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:50,302
l don't know.

104
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:10,157
Has Arjun come back?

105
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:13,853
No. He has gone to settle a clash
between two villages.

106
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,163
Will my son be alright?

107
00:36:50,366 --> 00:37:06,476
Sign on this.
Check your belongings.

108
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,019
You can go.

109
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:19,687
Ramathurai has given a statement
saying that it was he who killed<i>..</i>

110
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:35,805
-Why?
-Deva.

111
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:06,609
Why?
Why did you bring me out?

112
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:13,071
Devarajan is not a man of virtue.
But l know what's justice.

113
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:17,414
What Ramana did was wrong.
What you did was right.

114
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:23,490
You've suffered a lot
because of me. l'm sorry.

115
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:29,462
l'm an orphan. l'd have spent my
whole life in jail and died there.

116
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,568
You've sent your man
in to bring me out.

117
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:36,036
l don't know how to thank you.

118
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:40,166
What can l offer you?

119
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:44,746
-l don't want anything.
-l've only one thing.

120
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,610
That's my life.

121
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,207
-This is Surya.
-Vanakkam!

122
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:17,143
My friend.

123
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,149
My brother.
My Thalapathi. (Chief of Staff)

124
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:07,924
l've given the bangle.

125
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,728
What is this?

126
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,633
My family lives well
because of you.

127
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,330
lt's nothing!

128
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:21,967
No, it's because of you
May God bless you!

129
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:24,544
OK. Take your grandma back.

130
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:26,945
May God bless you!

131
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:33,089
One minute!
What's your name?

132
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:35,250
Thalapathi.

133
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:28,806
-Surya, is this necessary?
-OK. Leave it then.

134
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,207
lt's not that.

135
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:34,646
l mean, joining a man
like Devaraj<i>......</i>

136
00:41:35,017 --> 00:41:40,649
-Do you have faith in me?
-l have.

137
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:42,484
l have faith in Devaraj.

138
00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:48,119
lf your mother turns up one of
these days and ticks me off for...

139
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:52,927
bringing up her son like this,
what would l tell her?

140
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:54,900
What?

141
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:57,028
Are you trying to say that my
beloved mother will search...

142
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,609
all over the world, find you and
ask you about bringing up her son<i>..</i>

143
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,269
like this?

144
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,109
Oh, yes. She will ask.

145
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:14,847
lf you want, shall l call her now?
Hold on for a while.

146
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,428
Oh, my mother!

147
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:23,360
Where are you?

148
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,397
Come!

149
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:35,176
-What's the child's name?
-Meenatchi.

150
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:55,561
Come back after six months.
Otherwise we'll go to your place.

151
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,633
We really admire your love
and concern for children.

152
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:01,904
l believe that, if l look after
other's children, someone will...

153
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:05,567
look after mine.

154
00:43:05,808 --> 00:43:09,835
Why worry about your son?
He's great.

155
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,971
-See you.
-OK.

156
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,141
lt's Ok.

157
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:22,590
A girl? l'm glad.

158
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:33,694
Does she resemble her dad or mum?

159
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,154
Surya!

160
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:07,327
How's the baby?

161
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:12,536
What name shall we give her?

162
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,912
Azhahi! Tamil Azhahi!

163
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,981
This is Surya. He'll give you
anything you ask him.

164
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:28,481
Are you Surya?
Do you know who l am?

165
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:33,884
Yes. You're Kalivardhan, Ex-MLA.

166
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:39,117
l've heard about you.
My boys told me.

167
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:44,031
l heard you're with Devaraj. Why?

168
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:49,502
-Devaraj is my friend.
-He's a hooligan. He's a loafer.

169
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,306
l put him in the
Taxi Drivers' Union.

170
00:45:57,446 --> 00:46:04,784
l supported him for ten years
and he went against me.

171
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,649
He's ungrateful.

172
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:10,316
These things are alright.

173
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:14,259
l had an elder son.

174
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:22,268
He killed him brutally.

175
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:26,466
l know it. l also know that your
son tried to kill Devaraj.

176
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:30,943
Devaraj won't do anything
without a reason.

177
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:34,605
No, Surya. You don't
know about Deva.

178
00:46:34,817 --> 00:46:36,307
You come to me.

179
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:40,683
l'll make you a bigger
man than Devaraj.

180
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:45,760
After me, you'll be the
strong man in this town.

181
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:52,232
Not only money. You'll have
power, status and a position.

182
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:55,201
-What do you say?
-Devaraj is my friend.

183
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:03,439
Devaraj is not keeping you with him
out of friendship or affection...

184
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:09,518
You are fearless. You'll
stand against any one.

185
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:13,554
lf you are with him
he will be safe.

186
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:17,090
That's why. lt's not
affection or friendship.

187
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,865
Come with me.

188
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:30,561
lf you stay with him you'll perish.

189
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:35,573
l'd rather die with him
than live with you.

190
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:44,745
Be blessed.

191
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:25,719
Deva...

192
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:33,827
What have l done to get
a friend like you?

193
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:42,508
lf someone had offered me such

194
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:45,774
-l may left.
But you<i>.....</i>

195
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:48,415
You're exaggerating it.

196
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:53,318
No, Surya. You have changed
Devaraj. You've made me a human.

197
00:48:53,455 --> 00:48:56,686
People used to be scared of me.
They kept away from me.

198
00:48:56,825 --> 00:49:01,353
But after you'd joined me, apart
from fear, they also respect me.

199
00:49:01,497 --> 00:49:04,694
They show their respect
affectionately.

200
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,926
They wish me well whole-heartedly.

201
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:13,130
Come. You shouldn't
stay here anymore.

202
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:15,641
You should stay with
me in my house.

203
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:21,807
No, Deva.
l have a lot of ties here.

204
00:49:24,653 --> 00:49:28,851
They fed me when l was hungry
and took care of me.

205
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:33,290
-How can l leave them?
-Won't you come when l call you?

206
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:38,298
There are so many people here.

207
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,959
You have so many.
But l have you only.

208
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:34,878
Deva!

209
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:46,688
Deva!
Look at my daughter!

210
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:48,786
When she was born,
you named her.

211
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:51,956
You treated her like your own
daughter and conducted her<i>..</i>

212
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:55,035
ear-piercing ceremony.

213
00:51:55,137 --> 00:52:01,201
You sent her to school yourself
saying that girls should study.

214
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:06,041
When she attained puberty you
invited everyone and gave a feast.

215
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:09,673
Now my daughter is dead.

216
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:11,911
She hanged herself.

217
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:17,082
Come. Come and do the
last rites yourself.

218
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:23,060
-How did this happen?
-Sub-lnspector Palanivelu.

219
00:53:28,764 --> 00:53:35,431
l saw you sitting in the bus. l
know that you don't like all this.

220
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:39,098
You're a Brahmin girl.
You sing the hymns.

221
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:44,178
You don't like violence.
But this Surya is like this.

222
00:53:44,313 --> 00:53:47,976
That girl was two years
younger than you.

223
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,141
They kept her in the lock-up
the whole night.

224
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,280
One Sub-lnspector and
four constables.

225
00:53:53,455 --> 00:53:57,255
They released her
only the next day.

226
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:00,987
When she went back home
she hanged herself.

227
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:05,825
Her father carried her in
his arms and came to us.

228
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,526
A fifteen year old girl!
What do you want us to do?

229
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,272
You won't like all this.
Surya is like that.

230
00:54:25,787 --> 00:54:30,656
What happened?
Why are you crying?

231
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:34,791
l am asking you.
Why are you crying?

232
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,559
You don't like me? You don't
like a violent man like me?

233
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:48,174
-Then what's it?
-l like you.

234
00:54:48,343 --> 00:54:55,875
-Then why are you crying?
-l don't know.

235
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:16,680
See you.

236
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,820
See you, sir.

237
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:44,182
You're transferred as a Collector.
We're very proud.

238
01:03:21,456 --> 01:03:27,088
Devaraj, we haven't met for years.

239
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:29,059
How are you?

240
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:34,099
There is God. There are good men
around me. l'm alright.

241
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:34,860
How about you?

242
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:43,069
Times are not like before. l've to
wait patiently for everything.

243
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:46,543
l'm getting old.
l'm waiting for death.

244
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:52,843
Devaraj, you've not changed at all.

245
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:58,358
Do you remember? l hope you've
not forgotten the past.

246
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:02,690
l've not forgotten anything.

247
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,288
Be blessed!

248
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,265
-May you live a hundred years.
-With your blessings.

249
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:48,903
Deva!

250
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:50,762
Please take the prasad.

251
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:06,071
Deva, don't die!

252
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:12,810
Devaraj, open your eyes!

253
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:16,181
Breathe Devaraj, breathe!

254
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:24,196
Breathe, Devaraj! l'm around.
l'm with you.

255
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:26,731
Nothing is wrong with you.
You are alright.

256
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:29,129
Hold it.

257
01:07:30,805 --> 01:07:33,433
You can't<i>.....</i>

258
01:07:34,909 --> 01:07:39,437
Call the duty doctor.

259
01:08:05,606 --> 01:08:07,733
Will Devaraj survive?

260
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:12,903
Difficult. He has 1 4 stab wounds.
lt's very difficult.

261
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:20,383
He must survive.

262
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:48,006
Devaraj will survive.
He won't die.

263
01:08:48,216 --> 01:08:53,586
-Did the doctor say so?
-Devaraj told me.

264
01:08:53,788 --> 01:08:57,315
He has decided.
He won't die.

265
01:08:57,492 --> 01:08:59,517
Really?

266
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,172
Sir, Devaraj didn't die.
He has survived.

267
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,739
What shall we do now?

268
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:28,552
-l'm around Shanmugam.
-Sir, they<i>.....</i>

269
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:34,252
Don't fear.
l'll take care.

270
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:44,700
-What did you say his name was?
-Manoharan.

271
01:09:46,174 --> 01:09:51,840
Look after Manoharan carefully
until all this is over.

272
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:56,742
Send him outstation for a while.

273
01:10:02,623 --> 01:10:07,253
-Shanmugam?
-Forget about him.

274
01:10:07,895 --> 01:10:09,453
They won't spare his life.

275
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:13,532
That's his fate.

276
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,084
l know.

277
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:12,359
Everyone should know what'll happen
if they lay their hands on Deva.

278
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,494
l'll show them.

279
01:13:32,967 --> 01:13:35,527
-His name?
-Shanmugam.

280
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:40,605
-Have you informed his family?
-Yes.

281
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:44,802
-Has the investigation commenced?
-No, sir.

282
01:13:44,945 --> 01:13:46,970
-Why?
-No witnesses.

283
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:51,813
How is that? lt happened
in broad light in public.

284
01:13:51,952 --> 01:13:53,749
ls there not even one who saw it?

285
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:57,289
-They saw. But they won't say it.
-Why?

286
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,983
Fear.

287
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:02,357
-Afraid of whom?
-Devaraj, Surya.

288
01:14:02,463 --> 01:14:08,766
This has happened here many times.
And it will happen again and again.

289
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:14,498
A thousand people would see it. But
not even one will give evidence.

290
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:19,602
He was alive a while ago.
Now he is no more.

291
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:23,215
They have burnt him alive.

292
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,545
Are we not going to
do anything about it?

293
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:30,590
We know who'd have done it. But
we've no evidence to convict them.

294
01:14:30,725 --> 01:14:32,420
Not even one will come forward?

295
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,754
All l need is one witness.
That will do.

296
01:14:34,862 --> 01:14:40,494
l saw the atrocity here. l can
identify the person who did it.

297
01:14:40,634 --> 01:14:42,693
l can give evidence in court.

298
01:14:42,837 --> 01:14:45,601
-Definitely?
-Yes.

299
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:48,903
Here's the witness you wanted.
Enough?

300
01:14:49,009 --> 01:14:50,601
-Your name?
-Kumar.

301
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:52,542
-Age?
-36

302
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:53,704
Parents?

303
01:14:53,814 --> 01:14:56,647
Father's name is Manickam and
mother's is Parvathy.

304
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:59,117
-Your name?
-Loganathan.

305
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,485
Age 42. Father is Sellathurai and
mother is Gandimathi.

306
01:15:03,657 --> 01:15:07,821
-Name : Elango.
Age : 27.

307
01:15:07,928 --> 01:15:11,159
-Parents?
-Karikalan and Thangam.

308
01:15:11,265 --> 01:15:20,105
Name : Surya.
Age : 32.

309
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:25,144
What's your father's name?

310
01:15:25,246 --> 01:15:26,406
Mother?

311
01:15:26,514 --> 01:15:29,108
-What's your mother's name?
-l don't know.

312
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:33,687
Haven't l told you a hundred times?
l don't know, l don't know.

313
01:15:33,788 --> 01:15:39,522
She dumped me. She dumped
me as soon as l was born.

314
01:15:39,627 --> 01:15:43,222
Everyone was celebrating
Bogi festival.

315
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:47,733
People discarded old things.
My mother discarded me.

316
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:51,828
She dumped me in a goods train.
l don't know who she is.

317
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:10,880
Now you can identify them.

318
01:16:15,896 --> 01:16:18,763
lsn't he the one who did it?

319
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,699
Tell me, sir.

320
01:16:22,903 --> 01:16:26,270
Don't know.

321
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:34,513
Look at him and tell us.

322
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:38,881
No. l don't remember it well.

323
01:16:38,986 --> 01:16:44,618
-Sir!
l can't say for sure.

324
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:10,611
No fear, no fear.
There's no such thing as fear.

325
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:15,551
Even if the whole world turns
against me l have no fear.

326
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:20,453
Even if they despise us and run
us down there's no fear.

327
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:30,696
You taught me this poem.

328
01:17:31,639 --> 01:17:33,038
What happened now?

329
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:40,703
Are you afraid that Devaraj and
Surya will harm me and my mother?

330
01:17:47,755 --> 01:17:50,781
ls my father afraid?

331
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:56,864
Some people have come to see
you with a petition.

332
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:09,303
How old were you then?

333
01:18:13,447 --> 01:18:19,249
l was 13 or 1 4 years old then.

334
01:18:19,453 --> 01:18:22,581
Was there a festival on that day?

335
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:35,432
Bogi.

336
01:18:35,602 --> 01:18:42,804
Everyone was dumping old
and unwanted items.

337
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:56,584
l dumped my newborn child.
ln a goods train.

338
01:19:08,502 --> 01:19:12,939
Why are you asking me this now?

339
01:19:13,073 --> 01:19:17,237
Nothing... Nothing.

340
01:19:24,151 --> 01:19:31,489
lt seems you never refuse if
someone asks you for something.

341
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,861
ls it true irrespective of
who asks you? -Why?

342
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:38,295
-lf l ask you?
-What do you want?

343
01:19:42,202 --> 01:19:46,002
-What do you want?
-Get up and come with me.

344
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:48,003
l've made a vow that l'll
bring you to the temple.

345
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:51,874
Come. lt's for our marriage.

346
01:21:19,623 --> 01:21:23,753
Who's that Devaraj?

347
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:42,167
-What happened?
-Surya.

348
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:39,662
Why is this town so bad?
Why so much crime?

349
01:22:39,803 --> 01:22:43,106
-Two fellows.
-Do something, Arjun.

350
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:45,006
Do something.

351
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:52,947
Surya, who's that Subbulaksmi?

352
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:56,712
-Who's that?
-Yes, who's that?

353
01:22:56,853 --> 01:22:59,151
No, l heard something.
That's why l asked.

354
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:00,823
What did you hear?

355
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:08,157
Oh, you mean that Subbulaksmi?
She's Pandi's grandmother.

356
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:13,994
-She's pretty.
-She sings well.

357
01:23:14,104 --> 01:23:17,039
She loves Surya.

358
01:23:17,173 --> 01:23:20,734
-You like her?
-You just eat.

359
01:23:20,844 --> 01:23:26,146
-You like her or not?
-Can't you see from his face?

360
01:23:26,283 --> 01:23:32,916
Her father works in the Collector's
Office. She's a Brahmin.

361
01:23:33,056 --> 01:23:36,423
Why bother about that?
l'll take care of it.

362
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:52,032
Mr Srinivasan, this is Devaraj.

363
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:58,638
-l know. What's it?
-We've come to discuss a marriage.

364
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,408
We don't know about your custom.

365
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:05,317
We've brought a ring
according to ours.

366
01:24:05,422 --> 01:24:10,826
We'll make all the arrangements and
take care of the wedding expenses.

367
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:14,829
You just fix an auspicious
date for the wedding.

368
01:24:15,031 --> 01:24:17,829
-Who's the groom?
-Surya.

369
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:19,629
He's like a brother to me.

370
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:21,862
Who's the bride?

371
01:24:22,038 --> 01:24:27,305
You must be kidding. We've come
to your house with a proposal...

372
01:24:27,444 --> 01:24:29,776
for your daughter.

373
01:24:34,651 --> 01:24:41,614
Do you like Surya?

374
01:24:41,725 --> 01:24:44,387
-Say it.
-Yes.

375
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:47,052
Do you wish to marry him?

376
01:24:47,163 --> 01:24:53,363
-When shall we hold the wedding?
-After my death.

377
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,735
What does Surya lack?

378
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,503
Who is Surya?
Who are his parents?

379
01:25:00,644 --> 01:25:03,078
What is his caste?

380
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:11,450
Surya is not of your caste. He
doesn't wear a sacred thread.

381
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:18,327
-What else do you want.
-Must be worthy.

382
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:19,485
What worthiness are you talking
about? Are you worthy?

383
01:25:19,663 --> 01:25:25,898
Will you help those in need?
He will. He gives whatever he has.

384
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:29,935
Your daughter will never
get a man like him.

385
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,508
l don't want such
a man in my family.

386
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:34,236
Don't you still understand?

387
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:39,611
She loves him. Why not let her
marry him and be happy?

388
01:25:39,783 --> 01:25:45,551
l'd rather kill my daughter than
marry her to a rogue like him.

389
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:51,457
Let him go.
Please let him go.

390
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:59,127
He is my father, mother, Guru and
God. He's everything to me.

391
01:25:59,335 --> 01:26:04,602
l beg you.
Please leave.

392
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:28,524
lt seems you'd gone there to
discuss about marriage.

393
01:26:28,665 --> 01:26:31,691
-Yes.
-Who asked him to go there?

394
01:26:31,868 --> 01:26:34,735
l suggested it to him.

395
01:26:34,871 --> 01:26:39,968
Why? Did l ask you to
arrange my marriage.

396
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,907
Why should we go and be
told off by people?

397
01:26:42,011 --> 01:26:46,380
l heard she told you all to leave.
ls she a celestial beauty?

398
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:50,476
Are there no other girls?
Who's she to ask you to leave?

399
01:26:50,587 --> 01:26:58,221
l was just saying why should we go
there and get insulted.

400
01:27:05,235 --> 01:27:09,797
Who are there? After all they
are people who fear us.

401
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:11,372
Why should we go to them?

402
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:13,601
Have l made a mistake?

403
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:16,176
l shouldn't have gone
there in such a haste.

404
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:19,544
No, Deva. She's nothing.

405
01:27:19,649 --> 01:27:24,643
May be if l'd not gone there,
things would have worked out well.

406
01:27:24,754 --> 01:27:27,120
So what? Forget about her.

407
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:41,770
No, Deva. She's not important to
me. lt's you who is important.

408
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:44,066
Deva is more important.

409
01:28:44,801 --> 01:28:52,139
Father has fixed my marriage. l
couldn't say anything against him.

410
01:28:52,308 --> 01:28:55,277
Next Wednesday.

411
01:28:55,478 --> 01:28:58,709
Won't you say anything?

412
01:28:58,815 --> 01:29:02,114
Won't you even ask
who l'm marrying?

413
01:29:02,318 --> 01:29:06,778
-Who?
-The Collector.

414
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:13,020
Go. Go and marry him.

415
01:29:13,162 --> 01:29:17,622
Who's stopping it?
Go ahead. Marry him.

416
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:25,266
What do you want? Fair complexion
and ability to speak English.

417
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:27,940
Go marry him.

418
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:36,143
Was it l who went after you?
Was it l who said l love you?

419
01:29:36,286 --> 01:29:40,017
Was it l who cried on your
shoulders? Get lost.

420
01:29:40,123 --> 01:29:43,388
Don't talk.
You've talked enough.

421
01:29:43,493 --> 01:29:49,193
Don't cry. Go marry
him and be happy.

422
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:53,497
Go away.

423
01:30:22,665 --> 01:30:30,197
A total of 64 cases
against the two of you.

424
01:30:30,306 --> 01:30:37,405
You've your own court, own police
and own government here.

425
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:42,546
lf you call for someone, whoever it
is, he must appear before you

426
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:45,150
Otherwise he gets beaten up.

427
01:30:45,288 --> 01:30:47,449
You pass judgement.

428
01:30:48,591 --> 01:30:50,991
Whatever the court may say,
your word is law here.

429
01:30:51,127 --> 01:30:57,464
You act as the judge for every
dispute that is brought before you.

430
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,589
Your house is the court.

431
01:30:58,701 --> 01:31:02,228
People come to us for help
and we help them.

432
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:06,607
We've the courts, the police and a
government. Let them help.

433
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:09,504
They come to us because
you couldn't.

434
01:31:09,612 --> 01:31:13,639
ls it because of that
or out of fear?

435
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,775
You don't like them coming to us?

436
01:31:15,918 --> 01:31:19,820
We're talking about what's right
and what's wrong, not my likes<i>..</i>

437
01:31:19,989 --> 01:31:26,292
Have you ever been poor?
Have you ever gone hungry?

438
01:31:26,396 --> 01:31:29,388
Have you wondered around without
a cent in your pocket?

439
01:31:29,565 --> 01:31:34,400
When your stomach is empty one
can't afford the legal expenses.

440
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,765
You can't spend your
time in the courts.

441
01:31:41,444 --> 01:31:43,105
ls beating people in
public justice?

442
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:45,510
Then is police brutality justice?

443
01:31:45,648 --> 01:31:51,314
There are laws to determine what's
justice and we are around to...

444
01:31:51,487 --> 01:31:53,614
enforce it.

445
01:31:53,723 --> 01:31:57,386
lt's wrong of you to take over the
job of the courts and government<i>..</i>

446
01:31:57,493 --> 01:31:59,484
with 100 henchmen under you.
This is absurd.

447
01:31:59,595 --> 01:32:04,726
lf someone comes to you with a
petition, you read it and...

448
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:09,703
give instructions as to
what's to be done.

449
01:32:09,839 --> 01:32:11,932
But when we do it, it's wrong.

450
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,807
Only the Collector has the
authority to do it. Others can't.

451
01:32:15,912 --> 01:32:22,408
You people have powers as an
lAS officer and a SP.

452
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:27,512
But we've the trust
of the people.

453
01:32:27,623 --> 01:32:31,525
They believe that we can do
for them what you can't do.

454
01:32:31,627 --> 01:32:35,927
Have you finished?
Finished shouting?

455
01:32:36,032 --> 01:32:40,492
The people here may be afraid
when you shout. l'm not.

456
01:32:48,044 --> 01:32:53,141
You don't like us.

457
01:32:53,249 --> 01:32:57,686
You're educated and you're
from a well to do family.

458
01:32:57,787 --> 01:33:00,950
You won't like ordinary people like
us even if we do good.

459
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:06,255
Yes, l don't like. Especially l
don't like gangsters like you.

460
01:33:06,362 --> 01:33:11,095
This is Surya, sir.
Don't clash with me.

461
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:13,931
-l'll bash you.
-Try and touch me.

462
01:33:14,003 --> 01:33:23,002
What do you want now?
What should we do?

463
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:26,845
You must stop everything
you're doing.

464
01:33:26,983 --> 01:33:29,417
We can't.

465
01:34:26,075 --> 01:34:29,408
Hello! Who are you?
Whom do you want to see?

466
01:34:34,717 --> 01:34:38,278
-Come here.
-Go.

467
01:34:40,556 --> 01:34:44,822
Hello, Pathma!
How are you?

468
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:47,555
Tamilazhgi!

469
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:51,999
You send us money every month.
l don't want it anymore.

470
01:34:52,068 --> 01:34:52,625
Why?

471
01:34:52,702 --> 01:34:55,728
l don't want it.
We're leaving this town.

472
01:34:55,805 --> 01:34:57,830
What's the problem?

473
01:34:57,940 --> 01:35:01,842
She's schooling here. We're also
around. Why should you go?

474
01:35:01,944 --> 01:35:08,907
Now she has no father. l don't want
her to lose her mother also.

475
01:35:08,985 --> 01:35:10,384
What happened?

476
01:35:10,453 --> 01:35:20,988
When a woman lives alone
everyone here gets ideas.

477
01:35:23,065 --> 01:35:24,396
Who misbehaved with you?

478
01:35:24,467 --> 01:35:29,530
They say my husband has gone after
others' wives. So what's wrong?

479
01:35:29,639 --> 01:35:34,133
My husband may have been a bad man.
He may have done a lot of wrong.

480
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:39,341
-But he took care of me
-Who? Who was it?

481
01:35:39,415 --> 01:35:44,148
A lot of people including your men.

482
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:49,180
They bring the money you'd sent.
They hold my hand and give it.

483
01:35:49,258 --> 01:35:54,958
They return after four days.
They chat and smile.

484
01:35:55,031 --> 01:35:59,434
Then they put their hands on me.

485
01:35:59,502 --> 01:36:01,902
What wrong have l done?

486
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:05,998
Who's it? Who's it?

487
01:36:06,075 --> 01:36:12,139
Who put his hands on you. Tell me
l'll sever his hand.

488
01:36:12,214 --> 01:36:16,947
No. l don't want anybody's hand.

489
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:21,957
There are lot of men in this town.

490
01:36:21,957 --> 01:36:23,686
We are Leaving

491
01:36:23,893 --> 01:36:27,329
Pathma!

492
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:29,162
Hold on for a while.

493
01:36:30,232 --> 01:36:37,104
-Are you my friend?
-What's this Deva?

494
01:36:37,173 --> 01:36:41,109
-Answer me. Are you my friend?
-As long as l'm alive.

495
01:36:41,177 --> 01:36:42,974
-Will you do anything for me?
-Yes.

496
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:44,171
Come.

497
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,073
Selvi, come here.

498
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:56,750
You must marry Pathma and
support her till the end.

499
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,061
Today is an auspicious day

500
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:08,465
Everything will be alright.
l'm telling you.

501
01:37:13,342 --> 01:37:18,473
You're one of my family.
l can't let you suffer.

502
01:37:19,115 --> 01:37:20,480
He'll take care of you
till the end.

503
01:37:21,117 --> 01:37:24,314
He'll take care of
your child as well.

504
01:37:24,453 --> 01:37:26,717
He's my brother.

505
01:37:27,456 --> 01:37:29,390
Put the pottu.

506
01:39:05,154 --> 01:39:08,214
You don't like me.
l know that.

507
01:39:08,324 --> 01:39:15,093
Your daughter lost her
father because of me.

508
01:39:15,831 --> 01:39:20,291
l killed him.
l beat him to death.

509
01:39:20,369 --> 01:39:26,001
l killed him with this hand.
He did wrong and l hit him.

510
01:39:26,075 --> 01:39:27,940
And he died.

511
01:39:28,077 --> 01:39:32,980
l didn't realize that
he'd have a family...

512
01:39:33,082 --> 01:39:36,347
or he'd have a child like an angel.

513
01:39:36,418 --> 01:39:38,682
This sinner didn't know.

514
01:39:38,754 --> 01:39:43,691
When she was born, Deva
gave her to me to carry.

515
01:39:43,959 --> 01:39:45,950
Do you know how l felt?

516
01:39:46,028 --> 01:39:51,762
Do you know how l felt
when she smiles at me?

517
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:58,898
Do you know how l felt when l put
the pottu on your forehead today?

518
01:39:58,974 --> 01:40:02,205
l am a sinner.

519
01:40:02,278 --> 01:40:07,944
l have sinned. There's no
forgiveness for me.

520
01:40:10,286 --> 01:40:12,948
Don't worry.

521
01:40:13,022 --> 01:40:17,015
l'm just a protector of this house.

522
01:40:17,092 --> 01:40:22,086
l'll protect you and your daughter.
That's all.

523
01:40:33,609 --> 01:40:39,639
-What's it, Deva?
-Come.

524
01:40:41,617 --> 01:40:44,814
Look at me.
Do you find anything?

525
01:40:44,887 --> 01:40:49,256
Look carefully.
Selvi, come here.

526
01:40:49,325 --> 01:40:53,785
-Tell me now.
-Child?

527
01:40:53,862 --> 01:40:57,093
-Girl or boy?
-Boy.

528
01:41:00,636 --> 01:41:05,596
Tomorrow is Bogi.

529
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:10,441
lt's already 32 years.

530
01:41:11,146 --> 01:41:14,445
l can't<i>.....</i>

531
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:19,143
-Kalyani, how am l to<i>.....</i>
-l can't forget it.

532
01:46:52,287 --> 01:46:55,882
Do you know that l'd a father?

533
01:46:57,926 --> 01:47:02,488
He died before l was born.

534
01:47:02,664 --> 01:47:06,498
Where's your father?

535
01:47:07,936 --> 01:47:11,030
Don't know.

536
01:47:11,239 --> 01:47:13,605
Mother?

537
01:47:13,709 --> 01:47:16,177
Don't know.

538
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:19,372
-How?
-Azhahi!

539
01:47:20,916 --> 01:47:22,577
How?

540
01:47:24,953 --> 01:47:37,423
When l was born, my mother
carried me and looked at me.

541
01:47:37,499 --> 01:47:44,029
l was dark. So my mother
didn't like me.

542
01:47:44,139 --> 01:47:51,341
See that yellow cloth there.

543
01:47:51,413 --> 01:47:56,077
She rolled me in that cloth and
dumped me in a goods train.

544
01:47:56,151 --> 01:48:01,111
From there l landed
in a rubbish dump.

545
01:48:01,189 --> 01:48:08,425
Then from there l came here
floating in that canal there.

546
01:48:08,497 --> 01:48:12,957
-That canal?
-Yes.

547
01:48:13,068 --> 01:48:19,871
One blessed woman took me from
there and brought me up.

548
01:48:19,941 --> 01:48:21,932
And l grew up.

549
01:48:22,044 --> 01:48:25,912
Now l'm talking to
this blessed girl.

550
01:49:03,952 --> 01:49:06,785
Beat them and drag them away.
Get hold of all of them.

551
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:11,782
Why do this at the temple?

552
01:49:37,319 --> 01:49:39,116
Selvi!

553
01:49:56,071 --> 01:49:59,131
Selvi!

554
01:51:47,182 --> 01:51:51,619
ls the Collector in?

555
01:51:51,686 --> 01:51:53,916
Mr Collector!

556
01:51:55,023 --> 01:51:57,321
Mr Collector!

557
01:51:57,459 --> 01:52:01,691
Come out.

558
01:52:11,473 --> 01:52:17,708
He's not in town.
He'll return tomorrow.

559
01:52:18,647 --> 01:52:20,740
ls the Collector your son?

560
01:52:20,815 --> 01:52:22,942
Only son?

561
01:52:24,486 --> 01:52:28,820
Ask him to be careful before
we do something to him.

562
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:52,173
l need something from you.

563
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:56,307
They say you'd give if one asks
you. Can l ask?

564
01:52:56,384 --> 01:52:59,182
-What do you want?
-You won't refuse?

565
01:52:59,254 --> 01:53:03,020
-What do you want?
-You should leave Devaraj.

566
01:53:03,091 --> 01:53:07,118
You're a good man. You'll do
anything to help others.

567
01:53:07,195 --> 01:53:11,689
But you stand on the side of
Devaraj and commit crimes.

568
01:53:11,766 --> 01:53:14,860
What atrocity is this?

569
01:53:14,936 --> 01:53:18,633
Who are you to question me? Did the
Collector send you to intercede?

570
01:53:18,707 --> 01:53:22,473
He wants to separate me from Deva?
Tell him he can't.

571
01:53:22,544 --> 01:53:26,241
-Why are you with Deva?
-He's my friend.

572
01:53:26,314 --> 01:53:30,910
lf l die tomorrow, l only have
Deva to do my last rites.

573
01:53:30,985 --> 01:53:35,115
He may be a good man or bad man.
But he's my friend.

574
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:37,215
l won't leave him
for anyone's sake.

575
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:42,093
-Even if God comes l won't.
-lf your mother comes.

576
01:53:42,163 --> 01:53:46,429
-lf your mother comes?
-What are you saying?

577
01:53:46,501 --> 01:53:51,302
-My mother?
-Yes.

578
01:53:51,373 --> 01:53:54,604
-l don't have a mother.
-You have.

579
01:53:56,878 --> 01:54:00,109
-How do you know?
-l know.

580
01:54:00,181 --> 01:54:02,240
l know it for some time.

581
01:54:02,317 --> 01:54:05,920
No. l won't believe it.

582
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:10,789
Yes. ln fact she's in
this town itself.

583
01:54:14,963 --> 01:54:22,927
ln this town? Who?
Who is she?

584
01:54:23,037 --> 01:54:26,404
Arjun's mother is your mother also

585
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:37,679
The Collector is<i>.....</i> my<i>.....</i>

586
01:54:41,189 --> 01:54:44,886
-How do you know?
-l know for sure.

587
01:54:44,959 --> 01:54:45,721
How?

588
01:54:45,794 --> 01:54:49,628
After you were born, she rolled you
in a yellow cloth and left you in<i>..</i>

589
01:54:49,697 --> 01:54:51,460
a train.

590
01:54:51,533 --> 01:54:54,661
And she cries for you even today.
She<i>....</i>

591
01:55:11,085 --> 01:55:13,053
l saw she is in temple

592
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:22,620
Will she talk to me?

593
01:55:28,036 --> 01:55:30,266
No.

594
01:55:34,309 --> 01:55:38,609
You have a family.
You've a mother.

595
01:55:38,947 --> 01:55:41,916
You have a brother.
l'm in your father's position.

596
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:44,908
No... No<i>..</i>No<i>..</i>

597
01:55:44,986 --> 01:55:46,886
She's not my mother.

598
01:55:47,989 --> 01:55:50,321
She dumped me.

599
01:55:50,992 --> 01:55:55,452
l was a disgrace to her.
So she dumped me.

600
01:55:58,566 --> 01:56:02,662
Did l ask her to
give birth to me?

601
01:56:03,938 --> 01:56:05,633
She's not my mother.

602
01:56:05,773 --> 01:56:10,176
The one who picked me up from the
canal is my mother.

603
01:56:10,245 --> 01:56:14,579
Those who fed me when l was hungry,
are all my mothers.

604
01:56:14,649 --> 01:56:19,416
She's not my mother.
She's the Collector's mother.

605
01:56:19,487 --> 01:56:22,923
l have nothing to do with her.

606
01:56:22,991 --> 01:56:28,657
-l don't even wish to see her.
-What happened was not her fault.

607
01:56:28,730 --> 01:56:31,358
lt's someone's sin.

608
01:56:31,432 --> 01:56:35,835
She was only about 1 4 then.

609
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:38,871
She didn't know what to do.

610
01:56:38,973 --> 01:56:43,637
She could neither keep
you nor abort you.

611
01:56:43,745 --> 01:56:47,943
She left you in the train hoping
someone will look after you.

612
01:56:48,049 --> 01:56:54,113
But since then, there was not a
single day when she didn't cry.

613
01:56:54,222 --> 01:56:58,716
She's longing for you.

614
01:57:35,296 --> 01:57:39,926
-Does she know?
-No.

615
01:57:40,068 --> 01:57:40,966
She need not know.

616
01:57:41,069 --> 01:57:46,371
She shouldn't know that
she has a son like this.

617
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:53,243
My hands are bloodstained.
She need not know.

618
01:57:54,482 --> 01:57:56,712
Promise me.

619
01:58:45,466 --> 01:58:51,598
What happened?
Why are you crying?

620
01:58:51,706 --> 01:58:57,804
l too feel like crying.

621
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:02,313
Mother, tell him not to cry.

622
01:59:05,286 --> 01:59:12,715
My mother is around.
She's in this town itself.

623
01:59:13,327 --> 01:59:18,731
The Collector's mother
is my mother also.

624
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:25,966
-But l can't call her mother.
-Why?

625
01:59:26,107 --> 01:59:30,908
She's in a high position.
What if she tells me off?

626
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:33,577
She won't.

627
02:03:00,454 --> 02:03:01,956
We've to do something.

628
02:03:01,956 --> 02:03:05,414
We get beaten when we mention
the name Deva or Surya.

629
02:03:06,961 --> 02:03:11,421
We've to stop it at once.
Otherwise they'll destroy us.

630
02:03:13,467 --> 02:03:15,435
Why don't we stop?

631
02:03:17,972 --> 02:03:20,440
Why not put an end to everything?
lt's enough.

632
02:03:21,976 --> 02:03:24,376
You've everything.
You've a name.

633
02:03:24,745 --> 02:03:28,374
You've fame. You've influence.
ls it not enough?

634
02:03:30,418 --> 02:03:32,386
No. lt's not enough for me.

635
02:03:32,586 --> 02:03:37,216
lf a man says what he has is
enough, it's shameful.

636
02:03:38,926 --> 02:03:43,056
Why should we stop? Should we stop
because some Collector asks us to?

637
02:03:44,432 --> 02:03:48,732
They'll beat up and lock-up anyone
they wish. Should we keep quiet?

638
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:51,397
There should have been
a child here.

639
02:03:51,772 --> 02:03:55,731
No, l won't stop just because they
want us to. Let them stop.

640
02:03:57,945 --> 02:04:00,413
Either that Arjun must die.

641
02:04:01,115 --> 02:04:03,083
Or Devaraj and Surya must die.

642
02:04:03,784 --> 02:04:05,581
Till then this war won't end.

643
02:04:47,928 --> 02:04:50,396
-ls the Collector in?
-Yes.

644
02:04:50,765 --> 02:04:52,733
l want to see him.

645
02:04:54,435 --> 02:04:55,732
l want to see him.

646
02:04:58,439 --> 02:05:02,569
-How are you?
-l'm fine.

647
02:05:02,777 --> 02:05:04,244
Does he take good care of you?

648
02:05:07,782 --> 02:05:09,750
He's a very good man.

649
02:05:12,453 --> 02:05:18,414
l don't know how. But in
character he is like you.

650
02:05:30,404 --> 02:05:32,702
l want to talk to you alone.

651
02:05:48,422 --> 02:05:51,391
You don't like me.
l know it well.

652
02:05:52,426 --> 02:05:56,385
Still, l've come with a request.
Get a transfer out of this place.

653
02:05:56,764 --> 02:06:00,393
You're a good man. You do
good to a lot of people.

654
02:06:00,768 --> 02:06:04,067
l'm telling you this as l don't
want anything to happen to you.

655
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:08,408
Please leave this town.

656
02:06:09,777 --> 02:06:12,905
You'll beat up people in public.
Burn them alive.

657
02:06:13,447 --> 02:06:18,407
You'll batter an lnspector. You
won't fear the court or the law.

658
02:06:18,786 --> 02:06:22,085
But l must fear you and leave
this place. ls it?

659
02:06:22,957 --> 02:06:25,687
l'll go. But before that
l'll destroy all of you.

660
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:27,527
You're a good man.

661
02:06:30,731 --> 02:06:34,690
You're a very good man.
We're bad people.

662
02:06:35,903 --> 02:06:36,870
l wish you well.

663
02:06:37,738 --> 02:06:40,707
You've a father.
You've a mother.

664
02:06:40,908 --> 02:06:43,536
-You have a family.
-Threatening me?

665
02:06:44,745 --> 02:06:47,373
No. l am begging you.

666
02:06:47,915 --> 02:06:50,042
l am older than you.

667
02:06:52,753 --> 02:06:54,880
l'm like your elder brother.

668
02:06:55,422 --> 02:06:59,722
lf l'd a brother like you, my mum
would have dumped you long ago.

669
02:07:11,438 --> 02:07:14,407
l wish you well.

670
02:07:31,792 --> 02:07:33,760
This is Surya's.

671
02:07:38,799 --> 02:07:41,427
What's your name?

672
02:07:44,305 --> 02:07:44,771
Come.

673
02:07:48,809 --> 02:07:52,438
Shall we remove this?

674
02:07:52,646 --> 02:07:54,773
Good girl.

675
02:07:58,819 --> 02:08:01,117
Do you like chocolates?

676
02:08:02,823 --> 02:08:04,950
How much do you like?
A lot?

677
02:08:05,492 --> 02:08:07,619
They'll give you chocolates.

678
02:08:10,831 --> 02:08:13,129
You shouldn't cry.

679
02:08:15,502 --> 02:08:16,799
This is nothing.
You shouldn't cry now.

680
02:08:17,171 --> 02:08:32,576
-You forgot this.
-This is Surya's.

681
02:08:42,062 --> 02:08:49,764
When Surya was born,
his mother looked at him.

682
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:54,404
He was very dark.
His mother didn't like him.

683
02:08:54,508 --> 02:09:01,141
She rolled him in a yellow
cloth and dumped him.

684
02:09:04,485 --> 02:09:08,546
Give me.

685
02:09:20,134 --> 02:09:26,095
Kalyani!
What's the matter?

686
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:27,264
What happened?

687
02:09:27,408 --> 02:09:30,866
Tell me what happened.

688
02:09:31,045 --> 02:09:36,813
My son<i>......</i>
He's alive.

689
02:09:38,052 --> 02:09:44,287
Surya!
l know<i>..</i>

690
02:09:46,794 --> 02:09:50,491
He's good man.
You don't know that.

691
02:09:50,631 --> 02:09:59,232
Your son is a very good man.
l know it very well.

692
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:01,240
Believe me.

693
02:10:35,442 --> 02:10:40,072
Tell him.

694
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:44,514
l'm Manoharan. l've been with
Devaraj for ten years.

695
02:10:44,618 --> 02:10:47,314
l've been with him
in all his activities.

696
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:50,948
Now l wish to become an approver.

697
02:11:20,921 --> 02:11:27,724
Arrest Warent!

698
02:11:28,095 --> 02:11:31,997
They have arrested Devaraj.

699
02:11:32,099 --> 02:11:35,227
They're dragging him on
the road with handcuffs.

700
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:51,418
Down with the Collector!
Down with the Collector!

701
02:11:51,518 --> 02:11:52,416
Down with the SP.
Down with the SP.

702
02:11:52,519 --> 02:11:54,419
Release Devaraj!
Release Devaraj!

703
02:12:19,379 --> 02:12:23,543
l heard they've arrested Devaraj.

704
02:15:14,888 --> 02:15:19,518
ls this Surya's mother?

705
02:15:22,829 --> 02:15:29,257
Why's she crying?
Let's go in.

706
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:03,302
Mum, why did you dump me?

707
02:16:03,503 --> 02:16:07,462
Mum, why did you put me
in the goods train?

708
02:16:08,341 --> 02:16:12,141
What wrong did l do?

709
02:16:13,113 --> 02:16:15,308
Why did you do this?

710
02:16:16,683 --> 02:16:20,551
Do you know how angry
l was with you?

711
02:16:20,687 --> 02:16:24,919
l was very angry with the
mother l'd never seen.

712
02:16:25,125 --> 02:16:31,121
l wanted to ask you a thousand
questions when l meet you.

713
02:16:31,498 --> 02:16:36,993
But now when l see you, all
my anger has disappeared.

714
02:16:37,304 --> 02:16:40,899
l want to keep calling you mum.

715
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:57,556
Look at me once.

716
02:17:00,327 --> 02:17:05,287
You suffered all these
years was because of me.

717
02:17:05,665 --> 02:17:12,036
l dumped you even before you
could open your eyes.

718
02:17:12,172 --> 02:17:19,044
l didn't name you.
l never carried you.

719
02:17:19,179 --> 02:17:23,548
l've never fed you even once.

720
02:17:26,686 --> 02:17:28,745
Why did you get such a mother?

721
02:17:29,022 --> 02:17:33,322
You should have been born
to a virtuous woman.

722
02:17:36,029 --> 02:17:42,935
But l know that one day
l'll find my son back.

723
02:17:43,003 --> 02:17:47,997
l know that l'll
see him again.

724
02:17:48,208 --> 02:17:55,341
l wanted to fall at
his feet and cry.

725
02:17:55,448 --> 02:18:01,353
Don't cry, mum.

726
02:18:02,455 --> 02:18:10,362
Come with me Surya.

727
02:18:10,463 --> 02:18:16,368
Let's all go somewhere else.

728
02:18:17,404 --> 02:18:22,899
Renounce all this.
Let's all stay together.

729
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:29,171
When l'd no one else,
only Deva was with me.

730
02:18:29,316 --> 02:18:32,114
How can l leave him now?

731
02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:38,019
You must stay with Arjun and l must
stay with Deva. That's justise.

732
02:18:38,124 --> 02:18:40,854
l hear them talk about
shooting orders.

733
02:18:41,027 --> 02:18:44,724
l've found you after
so many years.

734
02:18:44,865 --> 02:18:54,331
lf anything happens to you
or Arjun l can't bear it.

735
02:18:54,541 --> 02:18:58,136
l should have died as
soon as l was born.

736
02:18:58,345 --> 02:19:00,836
l don't fear death now.

737
02:19:01,047 --> 02:19:04,380
Don't worry about Arjun.

738
02:19:04,551 --> 02:19:09,682
l won't harm Arjun.
l swear on you.

739
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:12,051
l swear on my mother.

740
02:19:58,371 --> 02:20:04,037
he chief secretary wants to
speak with you urgently.

741
02:20:14,888 --> 02:20:17,755
Sir, l can explain.

742
02:20:21,328 --> 02:20:27,096
Sir, please give some time.

743
02:20:28,335 --> 02:20:31,862
Fellows like Devaraj<i>......</i>

744
02:20:49,356 --> 02:20:54,089
They've transferred me to Madras.

745
02:20:58,365 --> 02:21:02,859
The transfer orders will
come next Monday.

746
02:21:04,371 --> 02:21:07,863
We've time only till then.

747
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:35,825
Devaraj released.

748
02:21:37,337 --> 02:21:43,298
The Collector must die.
The SP must die.

749
02:21:43,443 --> 02:21:45,707
That's your responsibility.

750
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:52,315
Let's not do things rashly.

751
02:21:52,452 --> 02:21:57,754
So far we've only hit and punished
those who have done wrong.

752
02:21:58,024 --> 02:21:59,048
Look at this!

753
02:21:59,192 --> 02:22:01,820
Every Tom, Dick and Harry at the
police station hit me and...

754
02:22:01,928 --> 02:22:03,259
kicked me.

755
02:22:07,367 --> 02:22:10,825
We'll hit them back.
We'll get them transferred.

756
02:22:16,376 --> 02:22:22,281
Why do say we shouldn't do
anything to the Collector?

757
02:22:22,482 --> 02:22:25,508
ls it because your ex sweetheart
is married to him?

758
02:22:25,652 --> 02:22:28,553
You don't want her
to become a widow?

759
02:22:28,655 --> 02:22:31,954
What did you say?
Look at me and say that.

760
02:22:32,058 --> 02:22:35,824
Don't deny. The Collector's father
comes looking for you.

761
02:22:35,929 --> 02:22:37,954
Things are happening without
my knowledge.

762
02:22:43,336 --> 02:22:48,273
You suspect me?

763
02:22:48,508 --> 02:22:51,568
Do you know what's friendship?

764
02:22:51,678 --> 02:22:54,670
Do you know what's a friend?

765
02:22:55,014 --> 02:22:57,482
Do you know who's Surya?

766
02:22:57,684 --> 02:23:02,587
l've told you once before that l'll
even give my life for you.

767
02:23:02,689 --> 02:23:05,089
Take it! Take it!

768
02:23:05,191 --> 02:23:10,458
My life is for you.
Why don't you understand that?

769
02:23:10,697 --> 02:23:15,657
No one is important to me.
Even my mother is not.

770
02:23:15,869 --> 02:23:18,770
lt's you who's important to me.
Understand?

771
02:23:27,981 --> 02:23:30,779
Then kill him.

772
02:23:34,654 --> 02:23:41,116
-l can't do that.
-Why?

773
02:23:41,294 --> 02:23:44,855
-l can't.
-Why not?

774
02:23:44,998 --> 02:23:48,058
-l can't Deva.
-Why?

775
02:23:48,168 --> 02:23:50,136
Because Arjun is my brother.

776
02:23:54,007 --> 02:23:56,976
My mother is Arjun's mother too.

777
02:23:57,343 --> 02:24:01,803
l've sworn to my mother that
l'll not harm Arjun.

778
02:24:13,159 --> 02:24:19,530
Deva and Surya won't be around when
you leave this place.

779
02:24:19,632 --> 02:24:21,600
What do you mean?

780
02:24:21,801 --> 02:24:25,601
Certain just action can't be
carried out through legal means.

781
02:24:25,805 --> 02:24:30,208
-Kalivardhan?
-Yes.

782
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:32,039
We're not going to do anything.

783
02:24:32,278 --> 02:24:35,406
They'll clash between themselves
and kill each other.

784
02:24:35,548 --> 02:24:36,845
We just close our eyes.

785
02:24:36,983 --> 02:24:39,713
They'll be no difference
between them and us.

786
02:24:39,819 --> 02:24:40,945
There will be.

787
02:24:41,154 --> 02:24:46,854
We'll be alive tomorrow. But
Devaraj or Surya won't be alive.

788
02:24:55,335 --> 02:24:58,964
What's this Arjun?
Please stop it.

789
02:24:59,172 --> 02:25:03,939
l beg you.
l'll fall at your feet.

790
02:25:06,312 --> 02:25:08,177
Don't do it.

791
02:25:11,351 --> 02:25:16,721
Surya is my son.

792
02:25:16,856 --> 02:25:21,520
l gave birth to him.

793
02:25:22,629 --> 02:25:27,123
Don't harm him.
Please spare him.

794
02:25:27,267 --> 02:25:33,900
Despite knowing all this,
you remained with me?

795
02:25:33,973 --> 02:25:37,602
Knowing they are your
family you left them?

796
02:25:37,777 --> 02:25:41,008
Knowing they're your
own flesh and blood<i>......</i>

797
02:25:41,147 --> 02:25:45,083
Why?

798
02:25:45,652 --> 02:25:47,313
Because you're my friend.

799
02:25:57,664 --> 02:26:01,623
Look at him!
Look at my Surya!

800
02:26:01,834 --> 02:26:05,497
He has even left his
family to be with me.

801
02:26:05,838 --> 02:26:08,136
Did you see my lieutenant?

802
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:19,250
ls Surya your son?

803
02:26:21,621 --> 02:26:24,590
My elder brother?

804
02:26:24,957 --> 02:26:29,690
l clashed with my own brother.

805
02:26:29,796 --> 02:26:35,962
l tried to get rid of your son.

806
02:26:41,307 --> 02:26:48,076
l don't have any siblings.
You're the only one for me.

807
02:26:49,215 --> 02:26:54,016
lf Arjun is your brother,
he's also my brother.

808
02:26:54,287 --> 02:26:59,782
lf you've a family,
it's mine also.

809
02:26:59,926 --> 02:27:02,793
Don't try to separate me.

810
02:27:02,995 --> 02:27:05,327
l won't allow it.

811
02:27:05,998 --> 02:27:12,369
l won't let anything
happen to your son.

812
02:27:12,672 --> 02:27:16,164
l won't let anything
happen to my brother.

813
02:27:24,684 --> 02:27:27,676
Deva, where to?

814
02:27:27,854 --> 02:27:31,221
We're going to see the Collector.
We're going to surrender to him.

815
02:27:48,374 --> 02:27:49,602
Yes, sir.

816
02:27:51,377 --> 02:27:53,675
One minute.

817
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:58,843
-Dad, SP wants to talk to you.
-What's it about?

818
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:01,417
He tells us not to do anything
to Deva and Surya.

819
02:28:03,890 --> 02:28:06,358
Tell him l'm not in.

820
02:28:16,402 --> 02:28:22,170
Mr Collector! Mr Collector!

821
02:28:42,795 --> 02:28:52,067
l've come to surrender.

822
02:28:54,807 --> 02:29:00,404
My Surya's family is mine also.
l've come to surrender.

823
02:29:23,169 --> 02:29:27,936
l'm alright, Deva.

824
02:29:28,074 --> 02:29:32,602
l'm alright, Deva.

825
02:30:41,547 --> 02:30:45,608
Surya, don't go.
Wait, Surya.

826
02:30:49,555 --> 02:30:52,649
Kalivardhan!

827
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,348
Kalivardhan!

828
02:31:44,844 --> 02:31:49,838
Kalivardhan!

829
02:32:06,866 --> 02:32:10,768
You killed my friend.

830
02:32:27,319 --> 02:32:30,254
You killed my Deva.

831
02:33:03,322 --> 02:33:05,085
You killed my comrade.

832
02:33:19,271 --> 02:33:25,232
You killed him right
before my eyes.

833
02:34:51,964 --> 02:34:58,369
We don't have any evidence or
witness against Surya.

834
02:34:58,504 --> 02:35:02,702
We can't do anything.

835
02:35:09,515 --> 02:35:13,815
Brother!

836
02:35:27,199 --> 02:35:29,861
Mum, let's go.

837
02:35:34,073 --> 02:35:36,871
Mum, come. lt's time.

838
02:35:39,478 --> 02:35:45,178
You carry on.
We'll stay with Surya.
