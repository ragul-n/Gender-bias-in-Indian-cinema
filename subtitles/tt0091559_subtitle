1
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,376
Where's father?

2
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,302
Is that Divya?

3
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:17,547
Good morning father.

4
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,599
Have you showered?

5
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,819
- Yes I have!
- Shut up!

6
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:29,476
Lying on Friday morning?
Scolding me on Friday morning?

7
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:35,244
Watch your father scold!
Don't yell! You'll get me into trouble!

8
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:42,686
I don't know what to do!
Let me tell you - make me a cup of strong coffee!

9
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:52,227
Just half a cup? A quarter?
Just a little bit?

10
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,336
Wash your face and come.
My dearest mother!

11
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:02,305
Just one kiss!
Don't touch me yet! Go and wash up!

12
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,960
You still haven't bathed?!

13
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,450
Scream! And I will kill you! Understood?

14
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,513
I'll take off my hand and you
mustn't say a word!

15
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,748
Daddy! Divya still hasn't
showered!

16
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:35,872
Someone might see us!
Why did you slip away in the morning?

17
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,676
Your sister might see!
I have every right to hug my dearest wife!

18
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,763
Why are you so wet?
That's... water!

19
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:45,311
I am asking you why?
That is... outside...

20
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,903
Rain, isn't it?
Yes. No... no!

21
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,074
Get moving!

22
00:05:55,422 --> 00:06:05,058
You're blushing!
"I have every right to hug my dearest wife!"

23
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:15,471
You still haven't bathed?
Don't worry; I have avoided father.

24
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:38,763
I have no responsibility; I lie,
am lazy and talk back to elders.

25
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:46,931
I set a bad example. I will only
prosper when I listen to elders.

26
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,474
Is that all for today or is there
more?

27
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,008
Go and take your shower and
get ready.

28
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,589
What happened to him?

29
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,057
Why are you quiet?
Waiting for you to get to the topic.

30
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:15,430
What do you want to tell?
How do you know?

31
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:23,499
Everyone has been nice to me
the whole morning. Something is up!

32
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,107
We have a prospective groom
coming over this evening.

33
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:39,882
The groom is Chandra Kumar,
a personnel manager.

34
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:49,663
He's a great match for you! I
will be lucky if this works.

35
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,534
You must be home at 2 p..m.
Exactly.

36
00:07:56,109 --> 00:08:02,844
Why be so upset? Agree if you
like him or reject him otherwise!

37
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,130
I'd be in a good mood if it
were me!

38
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:13,287
Now it's this spectacle. Next
thing, they will make me marry him!

39
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,524
- Marry him he's fine.
- I can't marry one whom I barely know!

40
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,501
- I'd rather be alone.
- What are you going to do?

41
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:29,507
I don't know.

42
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,784
You're not in my plight!

43
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,397
- What if there isn't a bride?
- What are you saying?

44
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,062
- What if I don't go home?
- Are you kidding?

45
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,168
- I am not going to go!
- You sound like a kid!

46
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,506
I am not going to go!

47
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:05,504
- Has the groom left?
- I've spoilt you too much!

48
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:16,180
Is your husband yelling? I'll
calm him down. Have they eaten all of it?

49
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,347
Speak softly!
I am...

50
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,568
I've spoilt you too much!

51
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:39,540
Do you know they waited since 5 p..m.?

52
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,956
She has played like a kid and returned!

53
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:48,547
Take this off; it looks mad!

54
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:57,694
They're nice so they waited for
so long!

55
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:06,535
Should have been strict
before! He wanted to talk to you alone!

56
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:20,683
Talk to him nicely for what
you did.

57
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,714
Sit down.

58
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:57,650
You wanted to talk to me but I
have to talk to you first.

59
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:07,062
I won't apologise for being late
as I don't feel it was wrong.

60
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,537
I don't like this ceremony; it's
like buying cattle in the market.

61
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:27,810
Father didn't understand this.
I didn't mean to insult you.

62
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:39,961
They would have sung you my
praises but I am not like that.

63
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:48,196
I have many flaws. Anger,
stubbornness, arrogance, ego. All of it.

64
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:59,308
I'm not responsible and I
don't care. I want you to know this.

65
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:15,133
I don't think I'll make a good
wife. Do you have anything to say?

66
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,342
I like you a lot.

67
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,285
He's agreed!
He likes you a lot!

68
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,967
- I am so very happy!
- Didn't I tell you so?

69
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,887
- Hows the groom?
- I like him a lot.

70
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:53,567
I like him too!
He's well educated!

71
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:58,006
He's submitted a thesis!
I've started calling him brother-in-law!

72
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:04,413
He was so patient.
So were his relatives.

73
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,988
He's ideal for her.
That's why I've given my consent!

74
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:16,361
Hold the wedding during
school days; then I can skip school!

75
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:23,898
We need to fix a date soon.
Looks like they're in a rush!

76
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:28,133
He would have taken her with
him if he could!

77
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:34,405
You should have seen the joy
on mother's face!

78
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,447
We have yet to ask Divya her
consent.

79
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,111
Do you like him?
I don't.

80
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:46,282
Disregard her!
What fault did you find with him?

81
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:50,886
He's so intelligent.
He said he liked you!

82
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,329
You don't like good things!
He's a manager at such a young age!

83
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,426
- Say you like him!
- Why don't you like him?

84
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,040
- I just don't like it.
- I think he's great choice.

85
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,372
Then you can marry him!
Why do you say no?

86
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,741
- I don't want marriage now.
- Don't talk like a kid!

87
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:13,943
Then treat me like an adult
and respect my wishes. I don't want this now.

88
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,247
When will you marry then?
When I feel like it!

89
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,687
You will want it at 55.
I want to study.

90
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,794
Marry and study!
I'll study and then marry!

91
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,191
We can't get such a good place
then.

92
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:39,473
I will retire soon and you still
have 2 sisters. I can't do as you wish for.

93
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:51,513
The groom is good and they
didn't ask for any dowry. It's the best.

94
00:19:52,759 --> 00:20:00,325
Are you selling me off? One
says he doesn't want dowry and you...

95
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:28,752
Can you please send it?
What happened here?

96
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:35,655
Father had a heart attack.

97
00:21:45,738 --> 00:22:00,244
His pressure is high. Just give
him the medication. We'll see tomorrow.

98
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,730
Aren't you happy now?

99
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:51,035
I've never asked anyone for
anything. I am asking you now.

100
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:09,347
Let my husband live. Your
father has his heart set on this marriage.

101
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,982
I beg of you!

102
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:35,439
You're up so early.

103
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,619
I will marry him.
Really? Look at me and say it.

104
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:51,197
Come here.

105
00:23:51,335 --> 00:24:00,141
Did you agree for my sake?
I know everything you do is for my good.

106
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:05,832
What are you doing here? The
groom is waiting for you.

107
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:12,906
- What do you mean?
- I don't like this.

108
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,044
- Don't talk nonsense.
- I don't even know him. How do I...

109
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:27,062
He's married you.
So? Would you have sent me to him earlier?

110
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:32,464
Wipe you tears and come.
I don't want this. Please.

111
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:42,604
Listen to me.
Auntie, let me bring her in.

112
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:20,046
Come here.

113
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:21,608
What happened?

114
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:29,919
I need to sleep.
Why cry for that? You could have told me.

115
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:39,189
- I'm telling you now.
- Go ahead and sleep.

116
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:17,785
He's Sanjit Singh. A very nice
man.

117
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,068
I don't understand a word
you're saying!

118
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:51,659
If my mom was here the
reception will be different.

119
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:56,164
I am everything around here.

120
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:04,729
The only thing lacking was a
mistress for the house. That's solved.

121
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:16,083
This is where the provisions
are. There's a shop around here.

122
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:24,187
These are the house keys.
Take them.

123
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:49,680
My loves before marriage
were books and music.

124
00:30:54,925 --> 00:31:00,386
This is your room. Do you like
it?

125
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:10,037
It's up to you to make this
house a home.

126
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:14,435
I only need a house.

127
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:08,255
Do you treat this as an office
or a playground?

128
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:14,233
Keep your apologies!
I told them not to do this!

129
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:20,071
I am asking about why you're
back so early?

130
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,238
Is this why you called?
Answer my question!

131
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:35,018
- Working.
- Nonsense. Have you heard of "honeymoon"?

132
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:42,360
There's union negotiations.
We should blame the girl's father!

133
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:56,668
You should take care of your
wife if you want things to be good!

134
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:09,756
Go out with her and praise her
to the skies! Then watch!

135
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:17,190
Can I go to my work now?
Who's the MD here?

136
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:20,861
It's you.
Sit down.

137
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:35,880
Get her a gift that she wants
willingly and things will be good.

138
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:42,788
My wife does everything I tell
her to!

139
00:33:55,605 --> 00:34:01,271
Why so long to answer?
"My wife does everything I tell her to!"

140
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:06,040
Go and do your work!
Are you talking to your secretary?!

141
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:11,984
What did you say?
Shut your mouth!

142
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:16,923
Telling me to keep quiet?
No not you! Shut your mouth!

143
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:23,659
Telling me aren't you?!
No, not you! Someone else!

144
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,568
You devil! Get lost!
Calling me a devil?! I'll deal with you later!

145
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:40,310
Look at my time.
I wonder what she's going to do later.

146
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:57,285
Can I ask you something?
Why did you marry me?

147
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:06,190
I said so much the other day
and yet you married me.

148
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:12,092
I liked you a lot.

149
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:25,507
I was forced to come and
wanted to tell you that I was not interested.

150
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:44,263
But after I heard you talk, I
liked you and agreed.

151
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:53,136
- Are you happy with this?
- No.

152
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:14,821
A newborn kid cries because
the environment is alien to them.

153
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:29,310
Your situation is similar and
I will wait till things change for you.

154
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,303
Why have you stopped?
Touch one of my fingers.

155
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:02,536
I can't decide between a saree
and jewelry for you.

156
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:09,083
I don't want anything.
I want to get you something.

157
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:12,085
I don't want anything.
Ask for anything you want.

158
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:16,585
Will you get me anything?
If it is within my capacity, yes.

159
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,064
I want a divorce. Can you buy
it in this shop?

160
00:42:06,782 --> 00:42:13,017
Deal with this later. Tell me
what happened yesterday.

161
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:22,355
Did you ask what she likes?
Yes.

162
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,399
What did she say?
She wanted a divorce.

163
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:31,237
Shall I get it for her?

164
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:37,841
Drink it!

165
00:42:44,753 --> 00:42:47,813
One minute.
Please leave my hand.

166
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,551
I need to talk to you.
Leave my hand and talk.

167
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:58,530
Are you scared?
It's not fear; I don't like it. I beg of you.

168
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:01,135
Why not?
I just don't like it.

169
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:06,707
You don't like my touch?
No! It feels like bugs are crawling on me!

170
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:37,982
What's this?
A small gift.

171
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,556
I told you I didn't want it!
I felt it was necessary!

172
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:48,994
Aren't you opening it?
No!

173
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:55,393
If I force you?
I'm not required to obey you!

174
00:43:55,536 --> 00:44:02,704
- I tied your thali!
- This is just a string in my opinion!

175
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:10,514
- The world begs to differ.
- But in my opinion, I am still not your wife!

176
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:13,586
Why?
I can't accept you as my husband!

177
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:24,689
- Why?
- My heart is not with me!

178
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:11,452
Who's the MP's son?

179
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:21,633
Is it you?

180
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:10,901
What's the trouble here? Who
are they?

181
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:21,045
Tell me what you saw!
I just came and I don't know anything.

182
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:30,957
Not one person has the guts to
talk! Can anyone identify them?

183
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:35,195
I can identify them!

184
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:04,830
It was him.

185
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:29,682
Stealing from the MP's son?
Where's the money? Tell me!

186
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:44,569
- Are you happy now?
- He stole in broad daylight!

187
00:48:44,706 --> 00:48:50,338
- Don't curse him like that,
- Come with me.

188
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:10,497
The MP's son hit my child and
just left from the spot.

189
00:49:10,632 --> 00:49:19,370
My kid is alive because of
Manohar and you got him into custody!

190
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:38,785
The money was for her
operation. Take this and bail him out!

191
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:46,293
Use this for the operation. I
will bail him out.

192
00:49:48,436 --> 00:49:53,135
She's the one who got him into
trouble and she's here now.

193
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:09,253
Can you pawn this and get me
money to bail him?

194
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:14,158
You identified him and now
you want to bail him.

195
00:50:14,296 --> 00:50:22,601
Where do I sign?
Here. I will bring him in again!

196
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:29,306
Drag him out!

197
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:17,112
Divya's father is not well. Can
I take her with me?

198
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:30,196
What happened to my father?

199
00:52:30,331 --> 00:52:33,164
When?
This morning. The auto hit him.

200
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:38,637
Where?
Vanimahal!

201
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:41,742
- Bad hit!
- Were you there?

202
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:45,277
- I sent him to hospital.
- Which hospital?

203
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,847
- General Hospital.
- Here or out of town.

204
00:52:47,982 --> 00:52:57,118
- Here. Why?
- My dad's in Koimbature and not back!

205
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:03,394
He's in Koiambature? Then,
could it be your grandfather?

206
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:06,763
My grandfather died before I
was born.

207
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:20,408
Our score was settled when I
had brought you out on bail.

208
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:32,116
Tomorrow you'll tell me I'm
pretty and then that you like me!

209
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,262
I don't like this!

210
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:54,378
I came to return this. But after
you talked, I understand.

211
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:01,950
What?
That you're pretty and I like you!

212
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:48,262
Looking for me?
Don't lie. Tell me the truth.

213
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,337
No.
Promise me.

214
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:53,304
I won't.
Then you were looking for me.

215
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:58,378
No!
I won't leave till you admit it!

216
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:04,042
The bus will leave.
No! My bike is blocking its path.

217
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:13,488
Go and take your bike!
I won't till you admit it!

218
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:19,794
There's a traffic jam!
Please take your bike!

219
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:24,428
Admit it.

220
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:35,107
Yes. I was looking for you.
One minute. Come here. Repeat it.

221
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:39,686
What to say?
Say it. Or I won't leave.

222
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:49,121
Yes. I was looking for you.
Fine! Meet me at 4 p.m. Tomorrow.

223
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:53,299
No!
At four o' clock.

224
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:12,552
You said you won't come but
you waited an hour.

225
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:16,748
I wanted to tell you to stop
harassing me.

226
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:21,453
Want some nuts?

227
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:32,798
You're scared of me. Scared
that you might fall for me.

228
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,273
Prove it otherwise.
How?

229
00:56:57,131 --> 00:57:00,760
What is this?
What does that mean?

230
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:05,734
This has nothing to do with
hooliganism.

231
00:57:05,873 --> 00:57:14,247
I don't fight now. I just steal.
Big thefts.

232
00:57:16,284 --> 00:57:19,776
Ask me what I stole.
What did you steal?

233
00:57:19,921 --> 00:57:23,982
Your heart.

234
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,560
"In the heat of blushing, she
says thanks."

235
00:57:30,631 --> 00:57:32,155
Thanks. For the coffee.

236
00:57:39,006 --> 00:57:41,236
What happened?
My father.

237
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:44,003
Where?
Next to the counter.

238
00:57:44,178 --> 00:57:48,842
The bald one?
Yes!

239
00:57:49,016 --> 00:57:51,951
What's his name?
Chandramouli.

240
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:59,788
Mr Chandramouli! Please
come over!

241
00:57:59,927 --> 00:58:04,159
Good evening.
Good evening. You are?

242
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:10,464
Come join us.
No, I've eaten.

243
00:58:10,605 --> 00:58:13,836
Just a little coffee?
No I've had.

244
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:19,845
Wait! Come over!
I have to leave.

245
00:58:21,215 --> 00:58:27,211
The next time, you must join
us.

246
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:12,274
What are you doing here?

247
00:59:12,274 --> 00:59:16,895
Security will chase you out!
No! I've bribed him!

248
00:59:16,895 --> 00:59:22,296
What do you want?
I need to talk to you.

249
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:24,879
Can't you do it elsewhere?
No.

250
00:59:24,879 --> 00:59:27,020
What if someone sees?
I've told them all to read!

251
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,282
Fine! Tell me!

252
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:36,061
What do you say?

253
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:42,260
Gather everyone and say it on
the mike! Then I'll answer!

254
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:48,507
Is this your answer?
Yes!

255
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:38,684
You told me to do this and I
can't reject your request.

256
01:00:38,825 --> 01:00:47,164
So, I am in the principal's
room speaking over the intercom.

257
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:44,574
The police have blockades.
Then that's a fight for sure!

258
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:50,376
- Where do we meet? When?
- At nine.

259
01:01:50,515 --> 01:01:54,349
I'll be there at nine.

260
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:09,060
- Can you do something?
- I know what you want.

261
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:16,299
You don't want me to go? I
can't give up my principles for you!

262
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:22,971
There's no harm changing.
I like you but can't conform to you!

263
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:28,017
I'm asking you to consider.
I have and I can't.

264
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:34,524
Your Love is pointless then.
These are 2 different things.

265
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:41,498
Why not?! I can't spend my
Life wondering where you will be!

266
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:48,368
I will go tonight!
Then, leave me!

267
01:02:50,676 --> 01:02:58,549
You have to choose between
this and me.

268
01:03:47,399 --> 01:03:50,596
Didn't go?
Because of me?

269
01:03:50,736 --> 01:03:56,606
Not that. I just didn't want a
young kid to have heartbreak.

270
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:01,972
Is that enough?
What else?

271
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:07,244
- It was such a big deal!
- Do you want me to marry you for it?

272
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:10,617
- That sounds more fair.
- Are you kidding?

273
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:14,054
- No.
- It'll be the end if my father finds out.

274
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:18,060
Don't Let him know then.
You're always joking.

275
01:04:18,196 --> 01:04:25,864
- No. I really wish to marry you.
- I want to spend my Life with you.

276
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:34,843
- But my parents...
- We like each other. What more do we need?

277
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:48,117
- But without their consent...
- Fine. Let's ask them!

278
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:52,856
- Marry me tomorrow at 10.
- Tomorrow?!

279
01:04:52,998 --> 01:04:58,868
- I can't.
- Then, I'll ask him!

280
01:04:59,004 --> 01:05:05,409
Then agree! Tomorrow
morning at 10 at the Registrar's office.

281
01:05:05,544 --> 01:05:12,950
What do you mean?

282
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:17,145
If you don't come, it means
you don't Love me.

283
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,013
If you don't come?
Then, I don't Love you!

284
01:05:20,013 --> 01:05:23,347
But tomorrow morning I will be there. Ok? Bye.

285
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:43,622
Can you come to the police station with me?
Why?

286
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:51,032
Yesterday's acts Landed 4
officers in hospital and a lot of Losses.

287
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:56,240
I was not involved.
Come to the station and say it.

288
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:02,780
You can ask anyone! I wasn't
there yesterday!

289
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:07,375
Can we go now?
I said I am not involved!

290
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:14,653
You'd better come!
I will!

291
01:06:18,964 --> 01:06:25,267
I will but tomorrow.
Go tell a fool that!

292
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:31,968
Just for today!
Not possible! Just come!

293
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:20,342
One minute!

294
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:27,448
Aren't you going to open this?

295
01:09:29,955 --> 01:09:37,953
I've said so much but this is
still important! I need to open it right?!

296
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,280
Divorce papers.

297
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:07,290
One's what you wanted; the
other's what I chose.

298
01:10:11,802 --> 01:10:22,337
After Listening to you today, I
see the justification.

299
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:32,115
I have no concerns about your
past. I wish to share your future.

300
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:44,759
If you think there's a chance,
take my gift. Or, sign the papers.

301
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:47,157


302
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:53,216
I will accept whatever you
decide.

303
01:11:56,317 --> 01:12:00,413
Which of you wants this?
Both of us.

304
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:06,559
What's the difference?
Nothing, just no similarities.

305
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:12,792
Must you get a divorce?
We thought we should.

306
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:17,461
You may change Later.
Don't you want this case?

307
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:21,666
How many years together?
Seven days.

308
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:32,919
Decided to part so soon?
It's not a matter of time.

309
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:43,654
You must be married for at
Least one year before Legally separating.

310
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:55,633
The Law has faith in your
marriage though you may not.

311
01:13:01,682 --> 01:13:09,817
You have to tolerate each
other for another year.

312
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:22,534
Do you still want it?
Yes, please do it for us. We've decided.

313
01:13:26,074 --> 01:13:29,305
Can I talk to her alone?

314
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:45,059
I don't have the heart to get
this divorce for you.

315
01:13:47,028 --> 01:13:58,303
Don't be hasty. A woman has
it difficult without her husband.

316
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:06,575
I'm suffering that now and
don't want that for you.

317
01:14:06,715 --> 01:14:10,276
I will file this for you
tomorrow.

318
01:18:55,370 --> 01:19:06,178
I shouldn't have done that.
I wanted to come back but...

319
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:19,216
I am sorry.
It's my fault to have forgotten about them.

320
01:19:19,394 --> 01:19:30,669
I can tell that this must be
terrible after applying for a divorce.

321
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:39,304
What will they all think about
me? They're your colleagues too.

322
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:46,382
I won't do this again. I will
change myself.

323
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:53,825
Don't change yourself for me.
You'll only be here for a year.

324
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:27,491
This is your room. Here's the
key.

325
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:38,972
You can be as you choose. I
won't interfere in your Life.

326
01:20:56,925 --> 01:21:01,259
Aren't you angry with me at
all?

327
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:29,419
I want to divorce my wife as
she keeps changing my secretaries.

328
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:33,459
Ask me if you need to know
about it.

329
01:21:33,595 --> 01:21:38,430
As if you're experienced.
We just filed for it yesterday.

330
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:42,297
Are you joking?

331
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:54,713
We will spend the next year
together but Live separate Lives.

332
01:21:54,849 --> 01:22:06,158
You want to Live separately
after marriage. I don't understand this.

333
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:19,031
Don't you like Leaving Tamil
alone?

334
01:22:34,856 --> 01:22:43,127
You just want to Learn? I will
teach you!

335
01:22:46,567 --> 01:22:54,201
I will teach only four words to
amaze him!

336
01:23:10,058 --> 01:23:15,621
"Come over you fool!"

337
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:33,079
You tell him "Sit down, you
Lazy bum!"

338
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,559
"Shut up fellow!"

339
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:08,737
"Get Lost!"

340
01:25:04,172 --> 01:25:10,441
You could have at Least tasted
my coffee right?

341
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:24,783
I took so much effort to do it
but you didn't try it at all.

342
01:25:24,926 --> 01:25:37,930
If I get used to this now, I will
suffer when you leave next year.

343
01:28:52,233 --> 01:28:59,639
Come over you fool!
Fool? This is a bad start!

344
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:08,273
Sit down, you Lazy bum!
Lazy bum? My respect is decreasing!

345
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:14,753
If anyone hears this, it is the
end of me.

346
01:29:14,889 --> 01:29:24,628
I treasure this more than my
wife so be careful.

347
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:36,870
Shut up fellow!
Don't yell! My driver can hear you!

348
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:46,547
Just take the key and do your
job! Spare me.

349
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:56,787
Get Lost! Get Lost!
I've never been so insulted!

350
01:30:07,308 --> 01:30:11,870
Can you come early today?
Why?

351
01:30:12,012 --> 01:30:21,250
You've tolerated me for 30
days and I wanted to cook you a good meal.

352
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:35,102
Yesterday it's Little Late
Fault is mine

353
01:35:35,413 --> 01:35:38,871
You never drink coffee made by me
The same to food also

354
01:35:39,084 --> 01:35:45,023
There is an unexpected problem in the office
I have to suspend an operator

355
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:54,690
Yes, there is a Lot of work for you
No time to spare for your wife or make a call

356
01:36:03,108 --> 01:36:07,204
You make it yourselves

357
01:36:07,412 --> 01:36:12,782
No need to compromise
You do it yourselves

358
01:36:15,345 --> 01:36:24,175
One min it's a black coffee
I will drink it in the afternoon

359
01:36:24,175 --> 01:36:26,954
So there is no sugar

360
01:36:34,428 --> 01:36:35,934
Is it OK

361
01:36:38,068 --> 01:36:44,598
Have you seen all the places here
Oh railway station, this house

362
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:50,302
Want a sight seeing now
No need to console me

363
01:36:50,547 --> 01:36:56,349
- No really I want to take you out
- When? Today! Your office

364
01:36:56,553 --> 01:36:59,954
I'll take a leave
Is it true

365
01:37:00,223 --> 01:37:06,924
Then make a call
Fast! Fast! - OK

366
01:37:59,616 --> 01:38:08,251
Hey there are singing Tamil song

367
01:38:15,131 --> 01:38:17,827

- Emergency admission.

370
01:45:56,627 --> 01:45:59,698
My husband is bleeding. He's in the car. Please admit him.

371
01:45:59,698 --> 01:46:00,357
Accident?

372
01:46:00,357 --> 01:46:02,587
No, not accident.

373
01:46:02,587 --> 01:46:04,710
I mean four men beat him up.

374
01:46:05,713 --> 01:46:07,639
Police case over there.

375
01:46:09,824 --> 01:46:13,269

Please fill this form.
He's dying Please.

378
01:46:19,304 --> 01:46:20,887
Have you informed the police?

379
01:46:20,887 --> 01:46:24,674
- If you are his relative, we can admit him.
- Oh I don't understand

380
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:28,819
- What are you saying?
- Are you his relative?

381
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:37,454
My husband
Please save him

382
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:11,946
I know you don't understand
but never mind. Thank you.

383
01:49:13,404 --> 01:49:15,739
Get lost!

384
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:19,048
I'm coming. Open the door.

385
01:54:55,891 --> 01:55:00,225
The food is ready.

386
01:55:03,932 --> 01:55:11,168
I've cooked such that you need
guts or hunger to eat it.

387
01:55:12,874 --> 01:55:18,471
Aren't you eating?
I'll eat if nothing happens to you first.

388
01:55:25,754 --> 01:55:31,967
Let me feed you.
You won't burn if I touch you.

389
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,212
But you'd feel as if bugs are
crawling on you.

390
01:56:20,909 --> 01:56:26,006
Where are you going?

391
01:56:29,284 --> 01:56:31,878
To the office?

392
01:56:32,887 --> 01:56:40,191
The doctor told you to rest for
a fortnight. Are you Listening to me?

393
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:48,559
You can't even wear your
shoes. Don't just ignore me!

394
01:56:48,703 --> 01:56:55,027
I won't give that. Even if you don't listen to the doctor

395
01:56:55,027 --> 01:56:57,029
Atleast listen to me.

396
01:57:03,518 --> 01:57:06,112
You tied my thali! At Least
Listen for that!

397
01:57:06,254 --> 01:57:12,386
To us, it's just a yellow string!

398
01:57:18,266 --> 01:57:24,262
Go ahead and get your bones
broken! Why do I care?

399
01:57:40,321 --> 01:57:47,887
Do you know what it means?
The one born to a donkey!

400
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:10,084
That means mad dog! I Learnt
a few words just to scold you!

401
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:19,724
That means mad man!

402
01:58:30,605 --> 01:58:32,845
Shut your mouth! Get moving!

403
01:58:32,845 --> 01:58:35,186
You haven't paid me.

404
01:58:37,836 --> 01:58:39,528
Wrongful person.

405
01:58:50,492 --> 01:58:54,292
How are you both?
Why the sudden visit?

406
01:58:54,429 --> 01:58:58,991
I had some work here and she
wanted to see you too.

407
01:58:59,134 --> 01:59:06,267
Come in. Sit down. I will go
and get him.

408
01:59:09,811 --> 01:59:17,308
Come down! My parents are
here!

409
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:21,614
Come and welcome them.

410
01:59:21,614 --> 01:59:24,500
Aren't they here already? How am I suppose to welcome them?

411
01:59:26,572 --> 01:59:28,813
I'm going to the office after coffee. with them

412
01:59:28,813 --> 01:59:32,897
Take leave for a day please.

413
01:59:33,034 --> 01:59:39,769
They come here to bug!
Don't yell. They might hear you.

414
01:59:39,908 --> 01:59:42,843
Let them hear! At Least then
they might understand!

415
01:59:51,386 --> 02:00:01,921
He'll be here shortly.
Hows everyone at home?

416
02:00:02,063 --> 02:00:08,525
I think of you all at Least a
hundred times each day!

417
02:00:08,703 --> 02:00:17,407
Probably father can't find
anyone to scold everyday!

418
02:00:17,579 --> 02:00:22,516
Are you happy?

419
02:00:22,684 --> 02:00:30,386
Let me make you coffee.
It's okay. Let me do it.

420
02:00:30,525 --> 02:00:37,089
You mustn't cook while you're
here! Leave it to me!

421
02:00:38,333 --> 02:00:40,699
How are you?
I'll be Late for work.

422
02:00:40,835 --> 02:00:42,735
Not having breakfast?
I don't want it.

423
02:00:42,871 --> 02:00:44,702
There's a lot.
I said I don't want it.

424
02:00:45,773 --> 02:00:52,440
You wanted go somewhere.
I'll go on my own.

425
02:00:58,395 --> 02:01:07,929
He was moody because of a
headache. Otherwise he's very nice to me.

426
02:01:08,072 --> 02:01:15,672
He treats me like a queen!
Believe me!

427
02:01:15,813 --> 02:01:20,773
Then, why are the beds
separate?

428
02:01:24,655 --> 02:01:34,121
It's normal to fight but not to
have separate beds.

429
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:45,438
I don't know what the
problem but you should give in a bit.

430
02:01:53,183 --> 02:01:55,651
Your father's here. Wipe you
tears.

431
02:01:56,954 --> 02:01:59,149
Is your work over?
Yes. Here!

432
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:03,226
What's this?
Train tickets for this evening.

433
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:04,520
Evening?

434
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:25,446
My job's over so I am Leaving.
I take leave.

435
02:02:31,555 --> 02:02:37,460
Forgive me if I had done
something wrong at your wedding.

436
02:02:37,594 --> 02:02:47,799
I will rectify it but don't make
my daughter cry.

437
02:03:17,935 --> 02:03:22,531
You had not right to vent your
anger on them!

438
02:03:22,673 --> 02:03:31,547
You could have at Least
respected their age!

439
02:03:31,682 --> 02:03:42,650
If I am nice, they might blame
you for everything at the year end.

440
02:03:45,729 --> 02:03:55,468
Now, they don't think much of
me and will accept you happily.

441
02:05:46,216 --> 02:05:51,677
- I've got something to show.
- I'm busy. Don't disturb me.

442
02:05:51,822 --> 02:05:55,258
I am just asking for one
minute.

443
02:05:55,392 --> 02:06:10,331
You behave so childishly!
Don't you understand?! Leave this place!

444
02:06:14,011 --> 02:06:17,503
Do you want me to leave this
place or the house?

445
02:06:17,648 --> 02:06:23,052
Both!
Then send me to Madras!

446
02:06:23,187 --> 02:06:28,887
Go ahead!
Then arrange for my ticket!

447
02:07:57,614 --> 02:07:59,707
Did Divya come here?

448
02:10:49,152 --> 02:10:52,883
Give it to me. I'll put it on.

449
02:12:02,192 --> 02:12:03,829
Your train ticket.

450
02:12:12,267 --> 02:12:14,159
What should I do?

451
02:12:16,206 --> 02:12:21,803
"Tell me not to leave once and
I will never leave you."

452
02:12:21,945 --> 02:12:27,144
"Tell me you won't leave once
and I will never let go of you."

453
02:12:27,284 --> 02:12:33,621
Should I leave or not?
Your choice. Do what feels right.

454
02:12:33,757 --> 02:12:35,854
I want your opinion.

455
02:12:37,113 --> 02:12:44,730
Your decision has nothing to do with me.

456
02:12:44,730 --> 02:12:48,003
Do we something together?

457
02:12:48,184 --> 02:12:53,696
I don't know. You asked if a thali was all.

458
02:13:28,912 --> 02:13:34,976
This is all the house accounts.

459
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:41,717
This is the store room key.
There's enough provision for 2 months.

460
02:13:43,059 --> 02:13:53,333
This is from the allowance.
Your passbook, cheque book and key.

461
02:13:57,173 --> 02:14:05,672
I've said everything. Do you
have anything to add?

462
02:14:05,815 --> 02:14:08,750
I'll pick you up at 2 for the
train.

463
02:14:09,919 --> 02:14:18,258
You don't have to come for
me. I'll go on my own.

464
02:15:56,138 --> 02:16:06,514
Here's the first thing you
asked for. I wanted to give it to you.

465
02:16:11,319 --> 02:16:15,255
Divorce.

466
02:16:19,494 --> 02:16:26,923
It came this morning. The law
has decided we have nothing together.

467
02:16:29,004 --> 02:16:38,936
Does your heart say so? This
paper can't change our hearts!

468
02:16:42,384 --> 02:16:50,484
I can bear you not liking me
but you like me; you won't admit it!

469
02:16:52,427 --> 02:16:59,094
I will admit it. I love you
wholeheartedly!

470
02:17:02,938 --> 02:17:09,537
If you feel the same way about
me, I'll be waiting for you.

471
02:17:11,146 --> 02:17:13,637
Till then, keep this in my
memory!

472
02:17:24,659 --> 02:17:31,121
"I will admit it. I love you
wholeheartedly!"
