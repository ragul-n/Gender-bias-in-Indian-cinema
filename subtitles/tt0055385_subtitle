2
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,829
Right. I'm on my way.

3
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,215
Diana is on her way.

4
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,138
How'd you get here so fast?

5
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,891
There's not much traffic
at 6:00 a. m. in the morning.

6
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,727
Why has every crisis since World War II...

7
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,354
happened in the middle of
my beauty sleep?

8
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,940
You're not getting too old for this,
are you, Joe?

9
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,235
I was too old for this
before either one of you were born.

10
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,155
Thank you all for responding so promptly.

11
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,491
This secret tape
was made yesterday at Miami.

12
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:25,455
An hour ago, I.D. Analysis
identified this man as Evan Robley.

13
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,623
It's Robley all right, sir.

14
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,586
I remember him from the time he stole
the nuclear plans from the French Navy.

15
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,089
Evan Robley has stolen
just about everything from everybody.

16
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:39,802
If there were a thieves Hall of Fame,
Evan Robley would be a charter member.

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,470
Well said, Steve.

18
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:47,143
This tape was sent by Interpol
after Robley robbed the Bangkok Mint.

19
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,897
You can see it shows him
enjoying his ill-gotten gains.

20
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,109
Apparently free of any fear
of apprehension.

21
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,654
I'd like you to study his disguise.

22
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,992
As far as I'm concerned,
he is the grand master.

23
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:08,247
Not only of disguises,
but international thieves as well.

24
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:17,631
This was the I.D. he used
to steal the rocket fuel formula...

25
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,050
from the top secret Turkish Air base.

26
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,802
We got him that time, sir.

27
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,347
Yes. For about 10 minutes.
He escaped on the way to jail.

28
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,766
He's in Palm Beach now.

29
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,521
The millionaire's sandbox
and I want you to know he plays up to it.

30
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:35,816
But I want to know
exactly what he's up to.

31
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,693
Thank you, and good morning.

32
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,069
Good early morning.

33
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,238
Good morning, sir.

34
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,949
You think Robley is after something
here in Washington?

35
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:45,826
Why would he go to Florida?

36
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,620
I've got an idea. Come on.

37
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,509
All of my mornings spent poring over
newspapers has finally paid off.

38
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:06,972
Queen Kathryn of Malakar happens to be
in Palm Beach, Florida at this moment.

39
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,936
- Brilliant deduction, my dear Watson.
- Thank you, Holmes.

40
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,856
Would one of you mind telling me
what's going on here?

41
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,775
Queen Kathryn
is this generation's Cinderella.

42
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,487
She met the Prince of Malakar
on a Mediterranean cruise.

43
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,823
They fell in love and were married.

44
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,742
Last year her husband died
and she became queen.

45
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,247
Not bad for little old Kathy O'Reilly
from Boston, Massachusetts.

46
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,833
Of course, now I remember.
But who doesn't?

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,586
But what has this got to do
with Evan Robley?

48
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,839
She brought with her
what amounts to the Malakar heritage.

49
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:43,341
A priceless diamond crown and necklace.

50
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,094
Then she'll need protection.

51
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:50,765
Wait a minute.
She's staying at the Malakar Consulate.

52
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,977
We have absolutely
no jurisdiction there whatsoever.

53
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,062
We'll have to go undercover.

54
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,481
Once inside, you'll be strictly on your own.

55
00:05:58,565 --> 00:05:59,607
Of course.

56
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,111
This is the Malakar ambassador
to the U.S. greeting her, isn't it?

57
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:06,614
Yes, it's the same Gregory Orrick
that was so critical of Kathryn...

58
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,283
when she took the throne.

59
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,078
You can't blame the man for being
chauvinistic about his country, Diana.

60
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:15,206
Kathryn O'Reilly was a bit
of a wild shamrock.

61
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,126
I would label this whole thing,
"Handle with care. "

62
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,544
And "Dispatch. "

63
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,713
- Shall we, Steve?
- Indeed, we shall.

64
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,965
I'll make the reservations.
You two get packed.

65
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,383
We stay packed, Joe.

66
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,884
How's the weather in Palm Beach?

67
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:28,886
About the same it is in Malakar.

68
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,179
Only more so.

69
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,557
- Good trip.
- So long, Joe.

70
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,857
Ready Jet Star Number 2
for Trevor and Prince immediately.

71
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,050
Come in.

72
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,852
Any problems?

73
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:20,938
Not at all.
My credentials worked perfectly.

74
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,816
You are serving tea, which I didn't order...

75
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,526
to the honorable Stephen Ludwig...

76
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:28,654
President of The American-Malakar
Cultural Association.

77
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:32,324
I can see that male chauvinism
is still alive and well.

78
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:36,620
You're the Honorable Stephen Ludwig,
while I'm the honorable new domestic...

79
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,123
hired to serve at the reception tomorrow.

80
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,582
That's the breaks.

81
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,044
- The tea isn't for you. It's for Count Diaz.
- Who's he?

82
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,171
Some distant cousin of the late king.

83
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:47,798
- Kitchen talk.
- I'll get it.

84
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,175
They say anything else about him
in the kitchen?

85
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,510
Not much more.

86
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:53,887
Watch the butler.

87
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,473
I'm worried about the way
he's watching me.

88
00:07:56,557 --> 00:08:00,435
By the way, the local IADC put a tail
on Robley after Atkinson's cable.

89
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,562
They lost him.

90
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,022
- He'll turn up.
- Just a second.

91
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,859
- All clear.
- Thank you, Mr. Ludwig.

92
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,667
Your tea, Count Diaz.

93
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,549
You cannot be a maid.

94
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,137
You must be a princess.

95
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,391
No one as lovely as you
should be serving tea.

96
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:42,644
- It's my privilege, sir. Will that be all?
- Certainly not.

97
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,814
I intend to order everything
in Cousin Kathryn's royal kitchen.

98
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:48,441
Is there a name to go along with
such a pretty face?

99
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:50,151
Yes, sir. Diana.

100
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,613
Diana, the goddess of hunt.

101
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,782
Are you a huntress like your namesake?

102
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,451
If you are, I'm your willing prey.

103
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:02,163
I really must return to my duties,
Count Diaz.

104
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,542
If I request that your duty
is to join me for tea?

105
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,837
I would be flattered,
and fired, in that order.

106
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,298
I would throw myself at my cousin's feet,
and beg her to rehire you.

107
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:15,760
Count Diaz,
I trust your rooms are comfortable.

108
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:19,430
My accommodations have brightened
considerably. Thanks, Mr. Ambassador.

109
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:20,640
What may I do for you?

110
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:23,643
Queen Kathryn has granted
your request for a private audience.

111
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,852
Before tea?

112
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,271
- Immediately.
- How thoughtful.

113
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,857
I'm afraid, lovely Diana, you'll have to
take this back to the kitchen.

114
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,277
- Yes, sir.
- But keep it warm. I'll be in touch.

115
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,822
Wonderful country, America.

116
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:39,283
Its servants are more beautiful
than some of my royal cousins.

117
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,747
Suppose we stop playing games,
Count Diaz?

118
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,791
You can start by telling me who you are.

119
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,209
Why, Kathryn...

120
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:33,629
I'm your dear departed husband's
second cousin once removed.

121
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,382
In that case, you may remove yourself.

122
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,425
Because there is no such person.

123
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,096
I had to tell the ambassador
something to acquire an invitation.

124
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:48,560
In actual fact, Your Majesty,
I'm Agent Clark Scott...

125
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:50,521
Inter Agency Defense Command.

126
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,496
I'd begun to wonder if my homeland
had forsaken me.

127
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,039
Far from it, Your Majesty.

128
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:13,210
The orders to protect you
come from very rarified territory.

129
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:17,714
I'm so surrounded
with enemies in Malakar...

130
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,009
it's hard to believe I could have a friend.

131
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:24,388
But you have.
And not just in the top drawer.

132
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:28,392
I pulled every string I could
to obtain this assignment.

133
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,770
It's an honor to serve you, Your Majesty.

134
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:36,691
How gallant. Thank you, Mr. Scott.

135
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:40,529
Count Diaz, your cousin.

136
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:42,864
Of course. Once removed.

137
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:45,867
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

138
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,746
Now, to get back to business...

139
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:54,501
the United States is quite concerned
about the safety of the royal jewels.

140
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,044
May I ask...

141
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,672
why you brought them
on such a risky journey?

142
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:01,925
Ambassador Orrick insisted...

143
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:06,179
that it would be the best possible way
to silence my many critics in Malakar.

144
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:10,767
You see, they believe
that I'm nothing but a fortune hunter.

145
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,937
But if I can bring the crown jewels here...

146
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,607
to my native country,
and return them safely to Malakar...

147
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,068
my critics will be out of ammunition.

148
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,695
I find his advice questionable.

149
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,449
Now that the jewels are here,
we must do our best to protect them.

150
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,787
I've taken a few precautionary
measures of my own.

151
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,206
The Consulate's security system
is excellent.

152
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,542
I understand that
the vault here is near impregnable.

153
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:41,631
I agree. But that would be the first place
that the thief would look for the jewels.

154
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,425
Then they're not in the vault?

155
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:49,806
The crown and the diamond necklace
are in a hidden safe.

156
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,566
Then, may I suggest, Your Majesty...

157
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,985
it remain your secret?

158
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:06,364
Thank you. Then I need only trust myself.

159
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:09,533
An excellent idea.
Now I need only protect you.

160
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,036
I've long believed, you know...

161
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:14,580
that the most valuable jewel of Malakar...

162
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,375
was her queen.

163
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:21,379
Thank you.

164
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,091
You've made me feel
very welcome, Mr. Scott.

165
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,470
Won't you join me for refreshments?
Perhaps some tea?

166
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,931
Thank you. Allow me.

167
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,731
This is Count Diaz.

168
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:44,860
Would you tell my maid, Diana,
that she can serve my tea in here?

169
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,321
Yes, immediately. Thank you.

170
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:08,258
Since you feel threatened
by some of your countrymen...

171
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,720
have you checked
your chambers for listening devices?

172
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:14,681
- You mean bugs.
- Yes, bugs.

173
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:19,228
Let's begin by looking
at the more obvious places, shall we?

174
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:26,485
Electronic surveillance
has become a fine art, Your Majesty.

175
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,112
To the point where it is now possible...

176
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:31,823
to conceal a transistorized transmitter...

177
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,117
in the olive of a dry martini.

178
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:37,245
These tiny objects, no larger than a dime...

179
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,873
can be placed anywhere. Behind curtains...

180
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,419
the telephone, bookcases.

181
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,463
Literally anywhere.

182
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:55,013
One cannot be too careful, Your Majesty.

183
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,809
Our tea. I'll just make sure.

184
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:11,529
Diana, I knew by asking for you,
we'd receive amazing service.

185
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,741
Thank you, my dear.
You've been such a help. You may go.

186
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,292
Come in.

187
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,965
- Steve, you're not going to believe this.
- What?

188
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,302
- I left with tea for Count Diaz, right?
- Right.

189
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,889
I served it to Evan Robley
in the Queen's chambers.

190
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,851
- He certainly doesn't lack nerve.
- Or charm.

191
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,895
Kathryn's eating out of his hand.

192
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,480
What's he doing with the queen...

193
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,982
when the subterranean vault
is under the consulate?

194
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:50,568
Is it possible the jewels
are not in the vault?

195
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,820
Anything's possible with Evan Robley.

196
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,116
- We better get rid of him.
- Easier said.

197
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,327
Do you think we should warn her?

198
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:02,914
From what you've told me,
she just might blow our cover.

199
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:04,874
What should we do?

200
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,085
Joe arranged for a warrant.

201
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,088
If we can get him off
the consulate grounds...

202
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,257
we can legally take him into custody.

203
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,595
He's a very clever man, Steve.
It won't be easy.

204
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,056
I got a plan that just might do it.

205
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,808
Meet me by the front gate after dark.
Can you make it?

206
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,602
The question is can you?

207
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,729
Don't worry about that.

208
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,647
Be careful, Steve.

209
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,656
Good evening.

210
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:46,373
Lose your way?

211
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:49,293
As a matter of fact,
I've found it, Mr. Robley.

212
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:53,547
You seem to have the social advantage
of knowing my name.

213
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:57,384
Am I committing some unforgivable
faux pas by not remembering yours?

214
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,554
My name isn't important,
but my business is.

215
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,389
So I'll get right down to it.

216
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:05,726
I'd like to buy the royal jewels of Malakar.

217
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,145
Unfortunately, they are not mine to sell.

218
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,731
I see. Well, before you fence them...

219
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,192
I suggest you listen to my offer.

220
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,195
This is all purely hypothetical, of course.

221
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:21,033
But do you have any specific numbers,
or types of currency in mind?

222
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:25,579
I'm talking about a very realistic amount
of untraceable cash...

223
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:26,955
in the millions.

224
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,210
- How can I be certain you'll deliver?
- You come with me and I'll show you.

225
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:34,588
Are you suggesting I leave the grounds?

226
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:39,426
The amount of money we're talking about
cannot be carried by one man.

227
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,096
If you can't take the mountain of money
to Mohammed...

228
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,057
Then Mohammed must move
to the money.

229
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:49,102
Right. It's a short drive. 15 minutes.

230
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,608
I must say
it's a very interesting proposition.

231
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,612
The sight of neatly stacked treasury notes
is my favorite scenery.

232
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:00,906
Shall we?

233
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,784
This little trip will set you up
for the rest of your life.

234
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:07,704
I better call the queen.

235
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,080
Why?

236
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,917
After all, she does have custody
of the baubles in question...

237
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,377
however temporary.

238
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:18,131
What was her private extension?

239
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:21,468
I have it here somewhere I'm sure.

240
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,061
Sorry, old boy.

241
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,941
Nice try.

242
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,736
Let's see if we can find out
who you really are.

243
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,677
Count Diaz?

244
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,895
Steve.

245
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:28,743
- Diana, get out. Fast.
- Let me untie you.

246
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:31,328
There's no time.
Robley sent for the security guards.

247
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,664
If they find you here,
we're both out of action.

248
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:34,832
I can't leave you here.

249
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:38,043
You've got to. He knows who I am.
He found the warrant.

250
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,503
Only you can stop him now.

251
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,006
Put this gag back, and get out of here.

252
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:43,466
Come on. Do it!

253
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,944
Let's put him in a basement cell.

254
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:18,041
Fortunately, Mr. Scott here
discovered that Mr. Ludwig...

255
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:22,671
was not the president of The
American-Malakar Cultural Association...

256
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,632
but a rather infamous jewel thief,
Evan Robley.

257
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,095
We are greatly indebted to you, Mr. Scott.

258
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,766
There are times when duty
becomes a pleasure, Your Majesty.

259
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,352
We'll hold him
in our basement detention cell...

260
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,771
until after you've left the country,
Your Majesty.

261
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,190
The publicity might prove
most unfavorable.

262
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,527
I don't believe we need have
any further fear for the jewels.

263
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,321
Not as long as Mr. Scott
has my interest at heart.

264
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,243
Please, Your Majesty,
you really must get some rest.

265
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:56,371
- You've a big day tomorrow.
- Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

266
00:20:56,746 --> 00:21:00,292
And thanks to you, Mr. Scott,
my rest will be untroubled.

267
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,252
Good night, Your Majesty.

268
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,462
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night.

269
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:27,610
I hope that's the last time
I bow to that American upstart.

270
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:30,155
Providing, of course,
you're as good as they say.

271
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,282
With that undercover agent
out of the way...

272
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,075
the robbery will be child's play.

273
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,287
My friends and I are paying you
too much for mere child's play.

274
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,248
If you want to quibble about price,
let's forget it.

275
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,334
No. Steal the jewels. Now.

276
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:46,754
It will be worth your fee
just to see Kathryn's disgrace.

277
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:50,758
When she appears at tomorrow's
reception and I start the rumor...

278
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,760
that her jewels are missing...

279
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:56,472
Queen Kathryn of Malakar
will again be common Kate of Boston.

280
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,600
Please spare the details.
I find politics a bore.

281
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:05,106
The Queen's order. Please open the door.

282
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:10,570
If she complains the food's cold,
shall I tell her who's to blame?

283
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:13,656
Thank you.

284
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,167
- What is it?
- Late supper, Your Majesty.

285
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,878
At this time of night? I ordered no supper.

286
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:31,132
- What do you want?
- I had to see you, Your Majesty.

287
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:32,758
You're being tricked.

288
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:35,553
The royal jewels are in great danger
and so are you.

289
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:38,097
How does a maid acquire this information?

290
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,306
I'm not a maid.

291
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,435
My name's Diana Prince.
I work with the IADC.

292
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:44,437
You're working with Agent Scott?

293
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:48,482
He is not an agent. He is a jewel thief.
Evan Robley.

294
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,402
But Robley's been captured.

295
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,571
That wasn't Robley.
That was Steve Trevor.

296
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:54,697
We're both agents.

297
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,741
We were sent to protect you
and stop the real Evan Robley...

298
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,618
from stealing the royal jewels.

299
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:03,414
Agent Scott's credentials were
thoroughly checked by my ambassador.

300
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:05,791
- You're obviously lying.
- No.

301
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,544
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

302
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:10,671
You've got to believe me.

303
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,549
Call this number.

304
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:17,803
It's in Washington.
They'll verify everything I've told you.

305
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,556
Excuse me for disturbing you so late,
Your Majesty.

306
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,099
Telegram from Washington.

307
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:23,892
Eyes only.

308
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,316
This is not your handwriting, my Queen.

309
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,487
Someone wishes you to spend your time...

310
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:38,490
chatting with a White House
telephone operator?

311
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:40,659
In the middle of the night.

312
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,578
This maid...

313
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:47,582
she's been telling me the most
incredible story about Agent Scott.

314
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,043
She claims he's an imposter.

315
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:57,509
- Guards!
- You've got to believe me.

316
00:23:57,592 --> 00:24:00,428
She's an accomplice
of that jewel thief we captured.

317
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,389
Place this woman under arrest!

318
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:09,479
After her!

319
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,245
Follow me.

320
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:28,998
Gentlemen!

321
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,254
You're in no danger.

322
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:47,469
- Wonder Woman?
- Yes.

323
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:53,016
I must still be asleep.

324
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,603
I thought you were a dream, a legend.

325
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,897
I'm real. As real as you.

326
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:03,318
If you want physical proof,
I suggest you examine your window.

327
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,195
Let me help.

328
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,405
- Majesty.
- Thank you.

329
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,624
- You did that?
- Yes.

330
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:26,925
Even seeing it with my own eyes,
I can't believe it.

331
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,803
- So you're not a fable?
- No.

332
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,389
Tell me, why did you come?

333
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:35,183
Because there's no one else
that can help you.

334
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,685
Before tonight, I would have believed you.

335
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:42,690
Since my husband died, I've been alone...

336
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:44,609
among many enemies.

337
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:48,404
But now, I have help
from my native government.

338
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,532
Agent Scott of the IADC.

339
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:55,203
Your Highness, I'm afraid
that you've been badly deceived.

340
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:59,624
The man you think is Agent Scott
is really Evan Robley.

341
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,337
He tricked you into giving away
your secret about the jewels...

342
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,257
and he tricked you into imprisoning
the real agent sent to protect you.

343
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:12,887
Some maid told me the same thing earlier.
But I refused to listen.

344
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:15,765
That poor man. We must release him.

345
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,350
We can't now.

346
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:18,851
If we do...

347
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:22,480
they'll know someone else on the inside
of the consulate is on your side.

348
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,524
You'd really be in danger then.

349
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,485
Steve Trevor is safe where he is.

350
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:30,696
He's an agent.
He'll understand what we're doing.

351
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:37,078
Robley seemed such a pleasing man.

352
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:44,001
I think that he was just
taking advantage of your vulnerability.

353
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:49,590
Now we have to protect your jewels.

354
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:52,426
- How?
- Robley knows where you've hidden them.

355
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,762
How can he? I've told no one.

356
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:56,013
You didn't have to.

357
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:58,390
When he came to see you earlier
as Count Diaz...

358
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,559
he watched you very closely.

359
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:04,980
In your distress, you gave away
their location without even knowing it.

360
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:08,692
Men like that train themselves
to notice every indication.

361
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:13,906
They're hidden in the safe behind
the coat of arms in your sitting room.

362
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:15,783
How did you know that?

363
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,452
I thought I'd been so clever.

364
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,579
There are no clever victims.

365
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,584
Don't worry about that.
I'll keep them safe for you.

366
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:29,797
- I'm glad you're on my side.
- Me, too. Let's go and get your jewels.

367
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:44,019
They're gone. Stolen.

368
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,813
We're too late.

369
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:49,775
My enemies have won.

370
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:55,364
One battle doesn't win a war.

371
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:11,713
I must remember to put up a sign:

372
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:14,090
"Please knock before trespassing. "

373
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:28,313
What do I do? Salute?

374
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:30,857
Do thieves salute?

375
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,029
If there is something worse than
a trespasser, it must be a name-caller.

376
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,573
To liberty and to beauty.

377
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,287
How about some champagne?

378
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,039
Then you can toast me.

379
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,458
How long have you been
in this room, Robley?

380
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:52,378
About 32 hours. I checked in
yesterday at 2:30 a. m., Paris time.

381
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,464
I'm only interested in tonight.

382
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:58,468
- Am I suspected of something?
- Of stealing the Queen's jewels.

383
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:02,263
I really don't have to answer
such a discourteous insinuation.

384
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:03,723
Excuse me.

385
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:07,435
I did not steal the royal jewels.

386
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:09,937
You're playing games with me.

387
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,105
Games?

388
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:20,198
Repeat that, please, if you can.

389
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,743
I did not steal the royal jewels.

390
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:33,878
My apologies, Mr. Robley.

391
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:35,796
It's quite all right.

392
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,133
As a matter of fact,
you're welcome to search my rooms.

393
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,512
Maybe I didn't ask you the right question.

394
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,389
It's a distinct possibility.

395
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:46,766
Must I?

396
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:49,435
I hate the idea of being forced
into doing anything.

397
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:51,645
It's my criminal nature, I suppose.

398
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,440
May I have some more champagne?

399
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:57,401
- Please?
- Please.

400
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:10,414
I should have asked you if you knew
where they were hidden.

401
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:12,750
I would have told you
they were most probably...

402
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,293
in the Consulate security room.

403
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:15,419
Go on.

404
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:17,796
As you undoubtedly know...

405
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:20,549
stealing is the only work I'm trained to do.

406
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:24,219
May I say that none of
my other professional endeavors...

407
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,433
have introduced me
to such a charming investigator.

408
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:35,481
What a pity. It was all for nothing.

409
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:38,358
- You call these nothing?
- A slight exaggeration.

410
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,236
Actually, they're worth,
in these inflationary times...

411
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,155
about $83.

412
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:49,369
I asked you if you'd stolen
the royal jewels.

413
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:52,706
- You're saying these are fakes?
- Or phonies, if you prefer.

414
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,000
Cheap imitations.

415
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,293
Why did you bother?

416
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,503
I was tricked. So were you.

417
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:04,092
It's Queen Kathryn who's been tricked.

418
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:06,094
She's the one who's gonna suffer.

419
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:09,306
Whoever stole the real jewels
has stolen her throne as well.

420
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,974
She'll be forced to abdicate.

421
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,642
- Really?
- Yes.

422
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,352
She won't give up without a fight.

423
00:33:14,436 --> 00:33:17,230
They don't call her
the wild shamrock for nothing.

424
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:21,610
We have to devise a plan to get
those jewels back before the reception.

425
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:23,695
- Do you know where they are?
- I'm not sure.

426
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,781
The real jewels were stolen
long before I stole the fakes.

427
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:28,241
Who do you suspect?

428
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:30,952
I think I can prove who took them,
on two conditions.

429
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:34,414
First, you must keep yourself
hidden for about five minutes.

430
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:35,915
- And...
- Second?

431
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,793
A bothersome detail, actually.

432
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:39,961
Amnesty.

433
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:41,546
Amnesty?

434
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:44,549
Why should you be given amnesty?

435
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:47,594
Because if I'm not,
I'll only have to escape.

436
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:52,432
I'm growing very weary of wearing
disguise after ridiculous disguise.

437
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,979
I have a few friends at the IADC
I might be able to arrange it for you.

438
00:33:58,062 --> 00:33:59,397
I'm sure you can.

439
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:02,192
Meanwhile, to show my good faith...

440
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:04,819
I'll just invite my suspect in here.

441
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:19,083
You're supposed to be
on your way to the airport.

442
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,794
I ran into a slight problem,
Mr. Ambassador.

443
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:24,839
The jewels that you hired me to steal
are fakes.

444
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:28,885
What does it matter? You weren't stealing
on a commission basis.

445
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:32,013
Somehow, I feel short-changed.

446
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,849
I imagine your co-conspirators
will feel the same way...

447
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:38,186
if they knew you had appropriated
the jewels for yourself.

448
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,981
Then I would suggest
that you don't inform them.

449
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:45,526
You did your job
and were generously paid for it.

450
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,903
I suggest you forget the rest.

451
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:51,240
That is, if you value your life.

452
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:54,493
Of course, Mr. Ambassador.

453
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:57,038
If you put it that way, I'm sorry I asked.

454
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:01,917
Good. I'd hate to see you neutralized,
Mr. Robley.

455
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:04,795
We may find other occasions
to do business together.

456
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,005
Hopefully.

457
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:10,134
I imagine you're keeping the jewels
in the security room.

458
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:13,929
I thought your dangerous attack
of curiosity had been cured.

459
00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:18,767
A momentary relapse. My apologies.
It's none of my concern.

460
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,813
Now you're getting the picture.
Goodbye, Mr. Robley.

461
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:24,273
Look after your health.

462
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,941
How very thoughtful. Thank you.

463
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:30,446
An immediate change of climate
is a prescription that should do wonders...

464
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:32,031
for your longevity.

465
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:33,991
Color me vanished.

466
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:45,377
Mr. Robley, you make
an excellent detective.

467
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:47,212
Please, there's no need to be cruel.

468
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:49,631
At least I know who's behind this now.
Thank you.

469
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:53,844
You're welcome. He undoubtedly,
has the jewels in the security room.

470
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:56,013
It's the only logical place.

471
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:59,266
He wouldn't risk moving them
from the consulate.

472
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:02,269
The security room
provides maximum protection.

473
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,229
Maximum is an understatement.

474
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:07,107
That vault makes Fort Knox
look like a piggy bank.

475
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,401
The entire floor is an electronic alarm.

476
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:13,155
The slightest pressure on it
will fill the room with deadly gas.

477
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,825
How could you have possibly
expected to get in there?

478
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,786
- Did you have a plan-
- Of course I have a plan.

479
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,164
Good. I will help you carry it off.

480
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:26,376
Better still, we release Steve Trevor
and there'll be three of us.

481
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:29,045
All for one and all that.
The three musketeers.

482
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:32,173
My fellow musketeer,
there is a slight detail.

483
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:36,261
The floor of the vault could blow
all three of us to kingdom come.

484
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:45,103
See for yourself. They're gone.

485
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,565
I am devastated, Your Majesty.

486
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,027
How may I help?

487
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,738
There's nothing you can do now.

488
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,491
Soon the world will witness my shame.

489
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:03,621
If only there were some way
to spare you this ordeal.

490
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,959
Perhaps if I announced your abdication.

491
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,921
I have more courage than you think,
Ambassador.

492
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:15,466
I'm not a blue-blood in the purest sense.

493
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,929
True, my grandfather came
to this country in steerage.

494
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,181
He left my mother in London.

495
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,517
My father always had to work hard.

496
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:29,731
He began life with what was known
as "an Irish teaspoon. " A shovel.

497
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,652
Since I never expected to have a throne...

498
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,072
the thought of abdication is...

499
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:40,950
less of a trauma than you might think.

500
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,745
- I, Your Majesty? What-
- Not necessarily you, Ambassador.

501
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,831
I merely meant to point out that...

502
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:50,293
though I haven't
experienced poverty personally...

503
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,170
it is certainly no stranger to me.

504
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:56,173
I don't fear it for myself.

505
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:01,595
I do, however, fear it for my people.

506
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,307
The Americans, Your Majesty?

507
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:10,729
My people are the Malakans.

508
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:14,733
Yes, of course.

509
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,945
Please, if you... Leave me now.

510
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:22,491
I must think what my husband
would have wanted me to do.

511
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,873
Resigning now would save you much grief.

512
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:32,793
We both know that you are innocent...

513
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,963
but the facts do appear otherwise.

514
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,798
Why torture yourself?

515
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,175
And why torture those of us...

516
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,970
who love and admire you?

517
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:45,931
Thank you.

518
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,479
Ambassador Orrick.

519
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:57,317
I realize my enemies
would stop at nothing to dethrone me.

520
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,237
When they get my head...

521
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,031
they will be getting the head of a queen.

522
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,549
Well, musketeers, this is it.

523
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:22,384
One of us has to stand guard.

524
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,762
And needless to say,
an interruption could be fatal.

525
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:29,307
You know the area.
She's got the power. I'll cover for you.

526
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:30,892
Thanks, Steve.

527
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:10,348
You say the slightest pressure
on this floor would release a lethal gas?

528
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:15,270
If we drop a hair on this floor,
it will kill us both in half a second.

529
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:17,897
Then this trip will have to be by air.

530
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:36,165
Tie this off.

531
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,501
- And hold on to it, tight.
- Right.

532
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,981
Now lower me.

533
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:04,151
No, wait! Stop. Not that much.

534
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,654
Sorry.

535
00:41:07,738 --> 00:41:09,782
Don't be sorry, just pull.

536
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:14,912
Slowly.

537
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:20,417
Stop. That's it. Now tie it off.

538
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:29,760
I know the combination.

539
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:31,095
So do I.

540
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:37,393
I'm gonna throw it to you. Catch.

541
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,001
Over there.

542
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:05,921
What sort of circus performance is this?

543
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,341
You should have left
when you could, Robley.

544
00:42:09,424 --> 00:42:12,261
I warned you about your curiosity.

545
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:14,680
You're not the only one
who knew the area, Robley.

546
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,348
Orrick knew it, too.

547
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:18,350
Get down there, Robley.

548
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,018
Come, now, Mr. Ambassador.

549
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:23,563
I'm sure you don't want
my messy footprints on your shiny floor.

550
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:25,774
You wanted to see the safe, Robley.

551
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,610
There it is. Down!

552
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:34,783
Mr. Trevor, you can join the act, too.

553
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,511
Was I right about the jewels?

554
00:42:55,095 --> 00:42:56,471
Yes, you were.

555
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,643
You know, if you play your cards right...

556
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:05,021
I think you can talk me into
a permanent partnership.

557
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:07,107
Right, Robley.

558
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,165
Where did you... How did you...

559
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,458
Not now.

560
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:28,002
No one is more deserving of this...

561
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:30,797
than you, Your Majesty.

562
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:34,634
This is a very private coronation.

563
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:38,262
Each one of you
in your own way is responsible for it.

564
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:41,516
And my apologies to you, Mr. Trevor.

565
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:44,352
It comes with the territory, Your Majesty.

566
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:50,024
I must tell you...

567
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:52,693
it was long my husband's dream...

568
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:55,363
that our two countries
be united in friendship.

569
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:58,699
You have helped
make that dream come true.

570
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,285
Thank you.

571
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:21,472
Come on, Steve. Get me out of this.

572
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,849
We'll blow our cover.

573
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:27,686
My favorite maid.
Diana, I thought you had forsaken me.

574
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,647
I think I'll have some champagne-

575
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,066
Since you'll no longer be working
as a thief...

576
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:33,776
why not try your hand as a waiter?

577
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:36,237
Diana is an agent for the IADC.

578
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:15,651
Your Majesty.

579
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:20,989
How did you get in here?

580
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:24,826
They've been asking that question
ever since I can remember.

581
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:28,246
I feel neglected, Your Majesty.

582
00:45:28,497 --> 00:45:31,875
I needed some way
to attract your royal attention.

583
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:36,963
I should've thought anonymity was
a part of your stock in trade, Mr. Robley.

584
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,925
The unfortunate truth is
I no longer have a trade.

585
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:42,385
Frankly, I hold you responsible.

586
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:45,138
Must I drink alone, Your Majesty?

587
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:03,031
I hope you won't feel neglected
if I don't offer you a knighthood?

588
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:06,576
A simple "thank you" would do nicely,
Your Majesty.

589
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,579
Exactly what am I supposed
to be grateful to you for?

590
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:13,249
There's Gregory Orrick, whose downfall
I most certainly hastened.

591
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:17,128
Wonder Woman and the IADC
had something to do with that.

592
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:18,254
Of course.

593
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:22,342
Would they have appeared at all
if I had not provided the impetus?

594
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:24,844
Your logic amazes me.

595
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:26,971
Then consider this.

596
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:30,391
Where are they now
when you're in real danger?

597
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:33,645
Danger?

598
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:36,147
Of being kissed.

599
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,819
I'd rather give you a knighthood,
Mr. Robley.

600
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:43,571
That's what you say now.

601
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:46,908
As we become better acquainted,
you may change your mind.

602
00:46:47,116 --> 00:46:49,327
Will that be all, Mr. Robley?

603
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,038
Don't you mean Sir Evan?

604
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:56,834
You truly are everything
they say about you.

605
00:46:57,168 --> 00:46:59,253
And willing to be more.

606
00:47:01,172 --> 00:47:03,007
I could use an ambassador.

607
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:13,809
Wonder Woman would have loved this.

608
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:16,520
Steve, she's...

609
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:20,483
She's probably seen it all before
with the original cast.

610
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:05,611
