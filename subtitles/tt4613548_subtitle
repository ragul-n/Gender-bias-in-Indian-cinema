00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,960
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,900
Mother Hayme, why do you take
this ominous girl into your tent?

5
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,430
Everything that happened is her fault, isn’t it?

6
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,300
How can she have the face
to stay in our tribe?

7
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,830
What are they doing in our tribe?

8
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,560
How dare you question my decisions?

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,230
Get out of here now! I said now!

10
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,130
Beys, come on, let us talk inside.

11
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,930
Everyone in the tribe is informed.

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
What is happening?

13
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,100
How dare you enter your Bey’s
tent like this?

14
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,300
They wanted to talk with their Bey,
Mother Hayme.

15
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,000
And I accepted their request.

16
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,960
State comes first or
else you get eaten by crows.

17
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,400
Move! I said move!

18
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,030
Whatever happens do not show yourselves.

19
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,460
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

20
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,530
Move!

21
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,900
Send the Shahzadas, Ertugrul.

22
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,030
And you send my father!

23
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
Move!

24
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,260
Kill them all!

25
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,100
Kill them all!

26
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,560
What if Suleyman Shah never comes back,
my Bey?

27
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,100
My Bey, what if Kara Toygar doesn’t calm down
and attacks us?

28
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,030
We see that the tribe has
so many endless problems.

29
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,830
We did not know...

30
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,330
...that the beys who have
many jobs to do are anxious to...

31
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,430
...gather the headquarter meetings
every chance they get.

32
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,530
For you to show your courage, you had been waiting
for your Bey to sacrifice himself.

33
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,940
We were not aware of this, until now.

34
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,460
Suleyman Shah, who returned from
a number of battles sweating blood...

35
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,300
...would have been proud of you
if he had seen you like this.

36
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,000
Kill them all!

37
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,220
Why aren’t you attacking?

38
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,860
Why?

39
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,860
Take them away.

40
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,100
I told you to kill them all!

41
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,560
Kill them all!

42
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,830
This is treachery! Treachery!

43
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,960
You cowards! You will pay for all this!

44
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,230
Attack!

45
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,430
Your brother is still in my hand,
Ertugrul!

46
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,460
If something happens to me...

47
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,500
Save your breath, Kara Toygar.

48
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
No one will come to your help.

49
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,160
I want to talk with you alone,
Ertugrul Bey.

50
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
Leave us alone, Alps.

51
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,900
I was a commander in the Seljuk army
for years.

52
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,400
For the Great Seljuk state
I fought inside and outside the country.

53
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,430
I have shed blood and fate threw me
to my Shahzada.

54
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,200
From now on, my only wish, my only duty
is to protect my Shahzada and his family.

55
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,900
That is why I contacted with the soldiers
I know within Kara Toygar’s legion.

56
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
That is the situation, Ertugrul Bey.

57
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,500
This is what I want as well, Afsin Bey.

58
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,430
To protect my tribe, my family, Halime...

59
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,260
...and Halime’s family.

60
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,830
As our wish and desire are the same...

61
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
...we should stand as strong as mountains
against this dog called Kara Toygar.

62
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,260
You are a valiant man, Ertugrul Bey...

63
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,060
...to fight side by side with you
is a pride, an honor for me.

64
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,160
Then tell me, Afsin Bey.
Those soldiers you are in contact with.

65
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,160
How effective are they?

66
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,600
Let me put it this way, Ertugrul Bey.

67
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,700
They are so influential that even when
Kara Toygar will beg for mercy...

68
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,760
...no one will hear it.

69
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,560
Let’s make him beg for mercy then.

70
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,080
So, it’s our duty to be the sword
and your duty to be the shield...

71
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,320
...in the battle on the Falcon Hill, Afsin Bey.

72
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,680
We will attack and you will keep the Seljuk soldiers...

73
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,540
...on the side where they need to be.

74
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,900
Of course, Ertugrul Bey.
We will be there for sure.

75
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,860
Today, we will take stand with the innocents
but against the cruel.

76
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,300
Creator of the innocents sees that.

77
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,160
May God be on our side and help us.

78
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,830
Sari Boru.

79
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,030
Sari Boru!

80
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,530
You will pay for this.

81
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,260
You lowlife scum!

82
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,930
May you burn in hell, Kara Toygar.

83
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,060
You will all die along with the Shahzadas.
I shall exterminate your progeny!

84
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,360
Those days are over, Mother Hayme.

85
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,300
It is time to think about
how we will pass the cliff in front of us.

86
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,160
Alpargu! Know your place!

87
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,100
Of course, we will discuss the future of our tribe...

88
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,030
but this is also Suleyman Shah’s home.

89
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,130
It is not suitable to bother Mother Hayme.

90
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,360
She is in enough pain as it is.

91
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,260
We were inconsiderate.

92
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,830
Let us carry on in my tent.

93
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,530
Carry the Bey symbols to my tent.

94
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,960
We are all sorry for our losses, brother.

95
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,460
The ambush on the caravan, the Alps
getting killed were not your fault.

96
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,930
Did you know beforehand?

97
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,260
Did you know that Numan was
a Shahzada beforehand?

98
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,130
No, I just learned it.

99
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,360
But it is obvious that
they had a good reason to hide it.

100
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,160
He played you just like he played us...

101
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
...but you still defend them!

102
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,600
Let me go, you goat herders!

103
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,560
Who do you think you are?

104
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,000
Let me go!

105
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,660
Your savagery won’t help you anymore,
Kara Toygar.

106
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,480
Your tranny has come to an end.

107
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,340
Savagery, huh?

108
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,060
The Turkmen tribe who ambushed
and captured a Seljuk commander.

109
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,430
Who do you think Sultan Aladdin will call
savage when he finds out all about.

110
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,930
Do not waste your breath, Kara Toygar.

111
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,900
We will set a court and your verdict
will be given according to our customs.

112
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,430
When custom speaks, Beys stop talking,
as well as the sultan.

113
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
-Father?
-Are you alright, my Bey?

114
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,330
Would you like to rest a bit?

115
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,360
I am fine, Deli Demir. I am fine.

116
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,100
Are we returning to the tribe, father?

117
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,000
No. First we will take back the goods
this lowlife looted from our caravan.

118
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,530
Afsin Bey,
you know that I would die for you...

119
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,230
...but what if this court ruling goes bad?

120
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,260
Do not worry, Sari. Trust me.

121
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,400
It’s clear that Kurdoglu was waiting
for the opportunity.

122
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,560
How else could he act so quickly
to take over the post?

123
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,000
Shameless man.
He even took the Bey symbols with him.

124
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,000
And we are sitting here
with our hands tied.

125
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,960
Enough, Aykiz. Enough.

126
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,230
You make a fuss without
knowing how the state is run.

127
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,300
-Do I have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Come, my girl. Come.

128
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,960
What happened?

129
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,580
You all have been waiting in pain.

130
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,960
You can’t even think of eating something.

131
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,200
I wanted to bring you something to eat.

132
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,930
Thank you, my girl. Put it on
the table and sit with us.

133
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,330
We all wait with anxiety.

134
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,830
While Suleyman Shah is leading them,
they will all come back safe and sound.

135
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,130
But my sister is worrying a lot
about my uncle Gundogdu.

136
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,460
You all wait for your fathers...

137
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,060
...and I pray for Ertugrul Bey.

138
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,560
You are correct.

139
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,030
I know the sorrow your sister
is going through.

140
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,430
But tell her not to worry...

141
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,230
...we shall leave the tribe soon.

142
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,960
If God permits, they will all
return safe and sound.

143
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,060
We can only pray for them.

144
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,400
You bloodless dogs. Lowlifes!

145
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,200
I will kill you all! Kill you all.

146
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,930
You will pay for all of these!
I will destroy you all!

147
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,260
No one in this world will remember
neither your tribe nor the name Kayi.

148
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,030
I will kill you all!

149
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:18,100
You shall leave immediately.
You will catch that dog called Gundogdu...

150
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,400
...before he reaches his tribe...

151
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,960
...and you'll bring him to Falcon Hill.

152
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,060
-Falcon Hill?
-Falcon Hill, yes.

153
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,300
Those Kayi goat herders are
setting us a trap there.

154
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,160
Did you hear, Sari?
They think they can finish Kara Toygar off.

155
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,530
My Bey, if you like we can go beforehand
to take precautions.

156
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,530
Yes, Sari Boru...

157
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:56,300
...place your most trusted
archers among the rocks of Falcon Hill.

158
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,300
When I give the signal...

159
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,230
...I want to turn that place
into hell for Kayis.

160
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,360
As you wish!

161
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,930
Sari Boru.

162
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,060
We checked the warehouse where
the goods are, they are all there, my Bey.

163
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,930
Are you alright, father?

164
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,560
Yes, I am.

165
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,130
My Bey, you are tired...

166
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,100
...I arranged a room for you to stay here
and rest for the night.

167
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,830
We can go there if you wish.

168
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,300
Thank you, commander.

169
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,620
Ertugrul you stay here.

170
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,140
I will go with Gundogdu.

171
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,400
Ertugrul Bey...

172
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,230
...there are matters we need to discuss.

173
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,560
As if what she caused were not enough...

174
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,860
...she is now hiding behind mother Hayme.

175
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
Wolf in a sheep’s hide.

176
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,120
But I swear I will make you pay for this, Halime.

177
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,430
Sister.

178
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,900
Gokce, where the hell are you?
Which corner did you hide in?

179
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,060
Sister.

180
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
Some degenerate is hiding behind mother Hayme...

181
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,580
and my sister is hiding in a hole alone!

182
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,940
Sister! You are mistaken!

183
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,240
I am not hiding anywhere.

184
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,260
I am coming from the tent,
I was with them.

185
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
Look at my sister.

186
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,860
I approached them with
an excuse of bringing food.

187
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,200
I said what I had to say and
I heard what I wanted to hear.

188
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,930
What did you hear?

189
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,160
Kurdoglu took the Bey symbols
and carried them to his tent.

190
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,930
It is obvious that they lost hope of
Suleyman Shah’s return.

191
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,960
-Did he take the Bey symbols to his tent?
-Yes.

192
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,330
Kurdoglu.

193
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,100
What is your intention?

194
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,530
You wait here.

195
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,140
Sister!

196
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,640
Stop, Gundogdu.

197
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,860
Today, I saw how you looked at Ertugrul.

198
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,160
You are his brother.

199
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,200
A brother should not look
at his brother with hatred.

200
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,200
Moreover, he risked his life to save you.

201
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,360
Father, what are you saying?

202
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,600
He risked his life, is that so?

203
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,820
I do not know whether he risked his life
for us or for his valuable guests.

204
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,840
I know one thing.

205
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,660
It’s Ertugrul’s fault that we are in this.

206
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,040
You have hate in your eyes
after the ambush on the caravan.

207
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,300
You look for a scapegoat to blame.

208
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,960
Are you comfortable, Kurdoglu?

209
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,960
Are you satisfied with sitting on Suleyman
Shah’s throne instead of saving Gundogdu?

210
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,400
I do not reply as I know
you worry about your husband’s life...

211
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,720
...but know your place, Selcan Hatun.

212
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,860
I know my place,
that is why I am questioning you!

213
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,820
Why don’t you do anything
to save Gundogdu?

214
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,160
Do you see what is going on in this tribe?
Do you hear them?

215
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,120
We have had all kinds of trouble.

216
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,980
Our tribe would have fallen apart
if I had not stepped in.

217
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,840
Who was to blame for those many troubles?
Wasn’t it you who stirred up the trouble?

218
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,080
I told you the things Suleyman Shah was
keeping secret, I committed crime...

219
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,100
...but what did you do? Nothing!
-What did you expect me to do?

220
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,940
Do you see me as a traitor? Did you think
that I would share the secret plans...

221
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,840
...of my tribe with the enemy?

222
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,120
What will happen to them?

223
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,160
If that dog called Kara Toygar
kills my husband...

224
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,060
We will pray for them to be spared.

225
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,280
This is all we can do.

226
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,440
We need to get out of the Seljuk territory
before all hell breaks loose again.

227
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,000
Not for myself but for my son who is in deep sleep unaware of anything.

228
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,140
I understand you, my Shahzada.

229
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,620
I guess that is the best course of action
for everyone’s sake.

230
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,620
But we might need horses and weapons to leave.

231
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,500
I have another plan in my mind.

232
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,460
After the funerals, I shall request
permission from my father to go to Aleppo.

233
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,400
I can take you there
safe and sound with my Alps.

234
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,920
-After that...
-Thank you, Ertugrul Bey. Thank you.

235
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,200
I shall always be thankful to you
and your family.

236
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,600
Tomorrow we shall talk with Suleyman Shah
and set off as soon as possible.

237
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,180
Ertugrul?

238
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
You are not asleep.

239
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,800
You are not asleep either.

240
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,030
We managed to win this time as well...

241
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,930
...but there is something
eating me inside, Deli Demir.

242
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,160
How did Kara Toygar know that we were here?

243
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,560
The thing that is eating your heart inside
is eating my heart as well.

244
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,840
Look...

245
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,240
...I will tell you something but...

246
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,140
Tell me, Deli Demir.

247
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,580
That night those dogs raided Halime’s tent...

248
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,460
...the person who drove me away
from the tent...

249
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,000
...was Kurdoglu.

250
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,600
I don’t want to blame anyone
without proof, even Kurdoglu but...

251
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,260
...this is a problem of the tribe.
I wanted you to know that.

252
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,330
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

253
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,830
-You have a message from Titus, sir.
-What did he write?

254
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,960
Fools.
They could not do one thing properly.

255
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,860
Check...

256
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,280
...and mate.

257
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,000
Do not forget, when the game ends...

258
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,200
...the king and pawns
are put in the same box at the end.

259
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:53,200
Only the one who is removing them
from the table knows the winner.

260
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Be careful and don’t make me angry
before you go in the box.

261
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,230
Send a message to Titus, immediately.

262
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,800
He should not sacrifice
Kara Toygar for anyone.

263
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,330
Can Titus still prevent
Kayis from coming to Aleppo?

264
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I do not know whether he can succeed or not.

265
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,900
I cannot predict what is going to happen
and that is grievous!

266
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,520
Tell them to get prepared, Marcus.

267
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,040
You are coming with me to Aleppo.

268
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,060
We have some business to attend
with Nasir.

269
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,200
Do you have any other
orders for Titus, sir?

270
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Tell him to make Kara Toygar
a fire of wrath for Kayis.

271
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,060
He can either do this himself
or use Kurdoglu.

272
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,130
This shall be his decision,
as he will be responsible for the outcome.

273
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,260
Where is Suleyman Shah?
They say that our caravan was ambushed.

274
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,330
Where are the bodies, my Bey?

275
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,400
He is right. Where is the Bey, where are
the bodies? What is happening, Kurdoglu?

276
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,460
Beys of Kayi.
Today is not the day for complaints.

277
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,460
We still have no news from our tribe’s
pillar Suleyman Shah and our Alps.

278
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,530
God forbid, we need to be prepared
for all possibilities.

279
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,560
The unity and future of
our tribe is under threat.

280
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,030
And this Aleppo issue
in the middle of all these troubles.

281
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,960
The decision our Bey took in good times...

282
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,360
...should be reconsidered under
these harsh conditions.

283
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
What else can we do, Kurdoglu?
What is on your mind?

284
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,600
Before I state the thing on my mind,
I would like to remind you that...

285
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,360
...Suleyman Shah left me in charge
before setting off.

286
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,600
-My words are our Bey’s words.
-Of course.

287
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,960
My heart is not in peace with setting foot
on the unknown path of Aleppo.

288
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
To migrate, we need to find...

289
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,600
-Suleyman Shah has returned!
-Suleyman Shah is back!

290
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Stop!

291
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,830
Stop! Stop!

292
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,060
Don’t do things that would not suit us!

293
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,900
We shall talk about
the trial in the headquarters.

294
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,500
Our customs will judge him.

295
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,930
Tie him up to the log.

296
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,530
Let go of me!

297
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,060
I will kill you all!

298
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,960
-Kill him!
-Don’t make him live!

299
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,960
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

300
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,400
Thank God, you are back safe and sound.
God has accepted my prayers.

301
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,230
Suleyman. Suleyman.

302
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,260
Suleyman.

303
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,860
Dear God.
