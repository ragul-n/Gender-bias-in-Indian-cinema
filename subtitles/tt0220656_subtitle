1
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,124
Where is he?
Director is calling him

2
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,625
He is smoking.

3
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,296
Hey, Come quickly

4
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,464
What are you hobbies?

5
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,628
I watch a lot of movies

6
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,630
Who is your favourite
Actress?

7
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,302
I like Actress Simran

8
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,304
Excuse me,My name is not Pugil
My name is Pugal,Pugalenthi

9
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,480
You can never learn
Tamil pronounciation

10
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,982
Ay,Why are you making
fun of me?

11
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,651
I am a Senior
Programme Executive

12
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,820
And you are just an
ordinary V.C; Video Camera Man

13
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,660
Don't try to tease me in
front of others

14
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,330
Today,where are we going?

15
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,699
Is to the Parthasarthy
raft?

16
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,326
No,we are going for
shooting a Pop Album

17
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:15,830
Quickly,Get ready

18
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,161
What! You are asking me
to get ready fast...

19
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,166
First, You go change your
dress

20
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,839
Oh! This is only my dress

21
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,671
Where is your
Assistant Palavesham

22
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,836
Excuse me,I have to
place the mike

23
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,009
Sir, I haven't come here
for singing

24
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:27,838
Then,What is this mike for?

25
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,182
Even for dancing,a
mike has to be set up

26
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,680
That is the usual
practise

27
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,021
Have you seen the place where mike
has been placed?

28
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,355
Madam,Speak something or
the other

29
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,360
What should I talk?

30
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,691
Tell ''I Love you''

31
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,355
Hey! Palvesham

32
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,364
Why are you suddenly talking
in a male voice?

33
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,264
It's me

34
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,270
Oh! Uncle,is it you?

35
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,164
You have also come here

36
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,896
He is not a
camera man

37
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,233
He is a light man

38
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,042
You rogue

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,839
Hey! Baldy are you telling
about me?

40
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,109
See,What I am
going to do?

41
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,479
Why you have come today?

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,684
I have cajoled a
beautiful girl!!

43
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,813
You spoiled everything

44
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,314
Hey,today,you tell me surely

45
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,920
Are you going to marry
my daughter or not?

46
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:10,712
I have to fix a date

47
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,024
You are like noodles

48
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,058
How can I marry a
noodle's daughter?

49
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,593
Oh! You won't marry my
daughter Anjugam -

50
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,528
I won't marry anybody.
Go Go,Go away

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,794
Then,I'll reveal your
weak point -

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,732
Hey,Go

53
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,404
What?

54
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,335
Sir,ask him
what's happening?

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,867
What? Sir

56
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,740
You swine

57
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,599
What did you say?

58
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,878
You swine

59
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,539
I asked the reason & you are
calling me a swine

60
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,205
I am sparing you
because of this old man

61
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,748
Otherwise,I'll cut you
in pieces

62
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,749
Are you laughing?

63
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,020
Everyone will laugh,if someone
tickles in the waist

64
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,626
But,God has given me
this weakness

65
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,020
Because of that,You are
getting me beaten

66
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,829
I swear! I won't marry
your daughter

67
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,761
I swear on my mother
Peechaatha

68
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,096
Don't show your hand,Otherwise
I'll throw you down,Go away

69
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:00,830
Call for you

70
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,638
Did you call the client
''You Swine''?

71
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,116
When somebody tickles me
I will abuse

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,309
What nonsense?
Gone crazy?

73
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,647
If you don't give
proper explanation

74
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,116
I'll dismiss you from
the job

75
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,247
''You Swine''

76
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,450
Keep quiet

77
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,652
You bald head!!

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,722
Put your phone down

79
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,122
Come & take your balance salary
in the evening

80
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,133
Now tell me,Will you marry my daughter
Anjugam or not?

81
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,465
Hey! Fly away & fall into
the sea

82
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,801
Oh! I have lost my job

83
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,478
What?

84
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,681
I was fed up
of my uncle

85
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,275
Only you've to tell about my
weakness to the M.D

86
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:48,349
What weakness?

87
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,345
If someone tickles me
in my waist

88
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,751
You swine

89
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:55,750
Stop the vehicle

90
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,756
I don't want to sit inside
I would rather sit on the top

91
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,229
Pugal! Come inside

92
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,232
Father,What's special
for today?

93
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,631
This is the special

94
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,638
What father? You made
me a Politician

95
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,711
Just like that,I sketched
you as a C.M

96
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,048
What? Why suddenly?

97
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,442
Regarding your marriage -

98
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,641
I have shown your horoscope
to the Astrologer

99
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:53,977
He was surprised

100
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,815
Your horoscope depicts
very good fortune

101
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,320
Like this,There will be only 2
Horoscopes once in 100 years

102
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,052
Before this,Statesmen Rajaji
had a horoscope like this

103
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,192
Aey! You are going to become a
big Politician

104
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,855
Father,lf I get the Executive
Producer Post in B.B.C or C.N.N -

105
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,934
Or If I get a
Gold Medal in Olympics

106
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,591
I would feel more happy

107
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,061
Politics!!

108
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,263
Father,lt's like a drainage

109
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,998
Come fast,Come fast

110
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,801
It's running,running -

111
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,868
Where? What happened?

112
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:21,745
Look,Look

113
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,006
Titles are going on

114
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,616
Our son's title is going
to come

115
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,282
Look,Look

116
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,680
Make a call to the
bride's house

117
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,223
Rascals,These people won't hold
the titles even for a minute

118
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,416
Fools,lt has gone

119
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,753
You were shouting after looking
at your Son's title for 10 seconds

120
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,759
I got frightened that you have
seen a snake or a scorpion

121
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,571
Hey you should give
35 paise to me

122
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,297
Yes

123
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,705
Mother why are you staining my
hand with henna I am not a child

124
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,844
You are my only son

125
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,979
Whatver your age may be,
You will be a child to us

126
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,043
See the girl's photo

127
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,848
Look at this,She looks
like Pepsi Uma,

128
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:00,575
Yes

129
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,051
Look at that,doesn't she
look like Renuka?

130
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,588
I had shown your photo
to them

131
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,383
They said,You look
like a Superman

132
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,727
The T.V has become
your obsession

133
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,588
Did you like the girl?

134
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,325
She is nice,but something is
missing in her

135
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,467
What's missing?

136
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,271
Mother!When you see a girl,she
should create ripples in the heart

137
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,806
If you look at a heroine
will she create ripples?

138
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,267
Hey! You are watching
the T.V too much

139
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,002
The T.V devil won't
leave you

140
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,076
Keep quiet

141
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,612
Don't trouble us in
between like a joker

142
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,010
Show your face

143
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,616
Tell me,How should your girl
look like?I'll search

144
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,621
Her hair should be
like Clouds

145
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:38,949
Eyes should be like a fish

146
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:42,890
Nose should be like
a Parrot's beak

147
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,228
Lips should be like
a rosy fruit

148
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,755
Neck should be like Conch

149
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,766
Legs should be like
a Plantain stem

150
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,098
She should have a poetic
appearance like this

151
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,229
Look,does she look
like her?

152
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,508
Don't ask your father to
search a bride for you

153
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,509
Then,He will choose like her

154
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,048
He has drawn a picture
of a she devil

155
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,843
At the time of marriage,
you also looked like this

156
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:06,914
Then,What was
your appearance?

157
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,387
He looked like his
cartoon

158
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,952

Have you passed I.A.S
Just to blame others?

Hey,doll! What's this
new habit of clapping?

252

255
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,415

00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,158
After seeing you for
the first time -

263
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,554

I want to know
your name urgently

275
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,319
I will not tell my
name to a doll

276
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,653
Then,tell it to me

277
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,336

Did you take my photo?
Yes

280
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,280
Why are you asking?

281
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,077
I asked just like that

282
00:20:59,291 --> 00:20:59,518
Hold this note book

283
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:00,990
Hey,Stop it

00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,432
Do you have sense?
Are you not educated?

285
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,131
You are getting in
at the signal. Get down

286
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,129
Do you have sense?

287
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,661
Why didn't you stop
at the bus stop?

288
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,995
I will stop
or I'll not stop -

289
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:14,934
Is it your father's bus?

290
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,272
Hey! Get down

00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,336
Our exam starts at 9.00 A.M

292
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,999
If we miss this bus,we will not be
able to write the exam

293
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,074
That's why,we rushed
into the bus

294
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,473
You didn't stop, & you are
talking like a fool

295
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,473
Now,are you going to
get down or not?

296
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,340

00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,144
Hey! Get down

00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,094
Stop the bus,

299
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,362
Students attacked me

300
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,170
Stop the bus
Stop the bus

301
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,839

Who is the bus driver
Start the bus

305
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,327
Because of you,
there is a traffic jam

306
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,326
Do you know who am I?

307
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:16,990
Driver

308
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,132
I am ruling
party's driver

309
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,061
Go & bring the camera

310
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,271
I'll start the bus only
when you arrest these students

311
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,534
Hey,Keep quiet

312
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,134
This driver only
attacked our student -

313
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,335
We'll move only when he
asks pardon from us

314
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,069
First,Park your bus
on that side

315
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,680
In the peak hour,You are parking the
bus in the middle of the road

316
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,645
Let the traffic be cleared
then we'll argue..

317
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,546
First you start the bus

318
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,547
The bus will not move

319
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,550
Near Teynampet signal a bus
has been made to stop

320
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,722
There,whether the students have
hit the driver -

321
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,053
Or the driver has hit the students

322
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:43,727
It's a big question

323
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,730
Upto 1 Km,there is a traffic jam
because of that bus

324
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,726
Inform the Commissioner to
visit the spot immediately

325
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,227
We'll find a solution

326
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,570

All are in tension

342
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,292
Cruel people! Why are
you creating problems?

The bride & the auspicious
thread is here

00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,464
And groom's people will
be waiting for us

347
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,135
The auspicious time
is going to pass away -

348
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,634
In such a situation,you
are stopping the buses -

349
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,804
Who will be responsible if my
daughter's life gets ruined

350
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:04,801

00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,005
Sir,The driver is not prepared
for the negotiations -

360
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,177
Even the students
are adamant

361
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,679
Move,Move

362
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,514
Ay,the problem is between a student
and the driver of that bus

363
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,015
Why is the whole city
traffic has been blocked?

364
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,016
Who is the driver of
this bus?

365
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:49,846
Start the bus

366
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:50,680
I'll not

367
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,516
Ay,come here even you
are a driver,isn't it?

368
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,192
First,start the bus,and
clear the way

369
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,360
Ay,all of you go,
move

370
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,029
Start,let me also
see

371
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,360
You carry on,he'll himself
get up

372
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,236
Will you go across me? -

373
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,644
If you kill me,will my
caste people leave you?

374
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,378
The whole State of Tamilnadu
will be in flames

375
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,036
Let me also see,
go across me

376
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,904
Come on,do it,
let me also see

377
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,380
Ay,Where has this caste
come in between?

378
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,180
Can you urgently connect
me to the C.M?

379
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,055
Hello leader,I am
Palasami speaking

380
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,128
They have run over a bus on the
driver who belongs to our caste

381
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,263
My blood is
boiling -

382
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,795
Are we of no
importance?

383
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,192
We have to show them,
who we are?

384
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,527
lmmediately call for
a strike

385
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,531
There should not be any movement
throughout the city

386
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,531
Sir,the Commissioner is
on the line

387
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:42,471
Tell me

388
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,401
Sir,the condition over here
has worsened

389
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,543
On one side,they say its
the Ruling party -

390
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,938
And on the other,its
caste problem -

391
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:47,942
It has become like
a battle field

392
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,413
You are the
Home Minister

393
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,812
If you permit us,we can
stop everything within 10 minutes

394
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,946
Hello,Don't take any
hasty decision -

395
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,214
In this,One driver is
from my party -

396
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,626
And another driver is from the
Caste which made me to win

397
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,622
The students support is also
important for me

398
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,359
That's why if you do any
harm to anybody -

399
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,828
I'll be in problem,
It will harm me

400
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,728
Only because of the fear of
losing such supports -

401
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,427
Such small,letter pad parties
such Caste leaders -

402
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,765
Have started threatening
the Government -

403
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,498
If we don't take any
action -

404
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,733
They'll convert the city
into a graveyard

405
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,173
Atleast give order to use tear gas
and disperse the crowd

406
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,772
Ay,if I listen to you
and issue Tear gas order -

407
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:23,972
The public will not
disperse

408
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,639
My power will get
dispersed

409
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,176
That's because,the four leged
chair on which I am sitting -

410
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,513
All the four legs
of it are not mine

411
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,713
One leg is of the
Alliance Party

412
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,050
Second leg is of the
Caste leader

413
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,759
Third leg is of the Financer
Who finances the whole show

414
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,922
And the fourth one is of
the Party Members

415
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,063
Even if we lose any one
leg out of the four -

416
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,458
We'll be made to bite
the dust

417
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,390
We should not
end these problems

418
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,795
We have to play Politics
by these

419
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,471
They'll shout for sometime and
cool down themselves

420
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,694
You girls are
playing Chess!!

421
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,038
Ay,What's this two T.V's

422
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,572
One for my 1st wife & the
other for my 2nd wife

423
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,836
Bloody,one you are
robbing -

424
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:27,444
And you also want for
your 2nd wife

425
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,197
The exam would have
started -

426
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,069
My studies have
all gone

427
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,836
Sir,the situation has gone
beyond the control -

428
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,944
Everywhere the shops are
being broken,stoned,damaging buses -

429
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,272
The public property is getting
damaged to a large extent

430
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,806
We can't control,unless you
give the shooting orders

431
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,744
Ay,if I had to give
the shooting orders -

432
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:06,679
I would have done that
long back

433
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,353
You know,how big a problem can
be created because of it

434
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,153
Instead of it,let 1-2
glasses break

435
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,619
I'll send that Caste Leader
and Educational Minister

436
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,826
Be patient,till then

437
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,624
He is fit for nothing,He can't take
an immediate decision

438
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,705
Hey,look at this -

439
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,765
If he is left here like this
he might die

440
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:31,976
Is there any
hospital near by?

441
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,703
There is one S.M Hospital,
which is 1 Km away from here

442
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,245
But the present scenario is showing that
the traffic will not get cleared

443
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,047
Alright,hold this

444
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:26,822
Hello,What's your
name?

445
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,698

446
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,232

447
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,435
I am calling you only

448
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,431

Alright! Kunthravali!!

452
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,708
Hey! Don't tease
me like this

453
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,847
You are not telling your name -

454
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:43,911
Then,How can I call you?

455
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,313
You don't have to
call me by name

456
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,040
Hey! Kunjaee!!

457
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,779
Oh! God! It's horrible

458
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,118
Your name will be Kunjaee
till you tell your name

459
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,586
Go,Go Thopala!

460
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,321
What!,Thopala!!

461
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,260
If I am Kunjaee
then you are Thopala

462
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,122
All are telling lies

463
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:01,791
Who is she?

464
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,005
Infront of you
all are telling lies

465
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,210
Oh!! It's me!!

466
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,146
This is my present
for telling the truth

467
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,615
There is no current for
light,isn't it?

468
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,562
Did you like this?

469
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,228
It's not good

470
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,023
Why?

471
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,697
You've clicked
when I was crying

472
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,101
It's horrible

473
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,635

Thenmoli!!

478
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,260
The joke is

00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,788
That the student,Who is
the cause of the strike

480
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,659
You all will be surprised
to know about that student

481
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,033
Student,who was struggling
for his life

482
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,862
Our Q T.V cameraman -

Admitted the student in the hospital
with great difficulty

484

I am fine

486
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,877
If you were late by 5
more minutes -

487
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,346
You would have lost
more blood -

488
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,745
And then we wouldn't have been
able to save you

489
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,082
Don't thank me

490
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,347

From today,you are

You are a Senior Reporter

506
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:06,987

You are taking photos when
I am bathing-

Wait.I'll show you

00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,680
You thought that I am a fool

520
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,409

Why are you taking my photo's?

525
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,260
That day,you didn't like
your crying photo's

526
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,087
That's why

527
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,263
I want to show you,

528
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,262
For that,I am taking Photo's

529
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,363
I thought,the whole day
of taking your photo's

530
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,103
In between,something
has hit my leg

531
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,036
And I shouted -

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,634
You also shouted all the
program got collapsed

533
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:14,777
What's this?

00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,308
Thorn

535
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,572
Not thorn
It's a snake bite

536
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,441
Snake bite,where!!

537
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,313
Oh! Snake has bitten you

538
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,455
Oh! Snake!!

539
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,521
What will I do?

540
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,988
For Snake bite,in your village
won't you suck it out

541
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,858
Don't be silly

542
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,865
You are clicking photo's without knowing
the snake has bitten you

543
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,872
Your life is saved because
that is not a Poisonous snake

544
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,132
If it was Poisonous snake -

545
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,343
For your happiness

546
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,536
I can do anything

547
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,413
Will you do anything
for me?

548
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:50,876
No

549
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,546
You will ask me,will you do
anything for me?-

550
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,481
I'll say ''Yes''

551
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,813
Then,you ask me
to die

552
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,950
But,I will not die

553
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,355
I want to live with
you for ever

554
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,359
In front of
all the people

555
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,229
Without bothering about
the Chief Minsiter -

556
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,565
You told the truth

557
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:16,562
Like that

558
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,501
Now,you tell me
the truth

559
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,793
I'll always
be with you

560
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,330
You should not cry

561
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,269
My Thenmoli should always
be happy

562
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,009
Smile

563
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,940
Then,I'll click photo
when you are crying

564
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,744
Then,smile

565
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,352
Give a broad smile

566
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,688
Oh! Your crying is better
than this

567
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,276
Why your face has become
like this?

568
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,140
Thenmoli,What happened?

569
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,350
Please tell me,what's
happening here?

570
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,482
Will you tell me,who are
you to ask me?

571
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,757
I am the father of
that girl

572
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,157
Oh! Father-in-law!!

573
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,419
Not father-in-law
Father

574
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,690
You've given birth to a
beautiful girl

575
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,166
For that,I've
to congratulate you

576
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,232
I am not in congress

577
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:03,364
Hey,all of you come

578
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,507

580
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:11,847
Yes

581
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,243
He is roaming with Themoli
and teasing her -

582
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,047
You just order,I'll
break their limbs

583
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,987
How dare you are roaming around
with our girl?

584
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:27,993
Mr.Pasunaki

585
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,928
I am not Pasunaki
I am Pasumaki

586
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,067
Let it be anything

587
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,136
I don't want cool drinks

588
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,202
You Swine!!

589
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,834
This is my weakness

590
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,602
I am telling the truth
why are you in tension?

591
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:43,745
Look Father-in-law

592
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,949
Don't call me father-in-law

593
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,479
I am in love with
your daughter

594
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:48,683
I want to marry her

595
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:49,608
What's your opinion?

596
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,820
Just see,What's lacking
in me?

597
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,083
I am not that bad looking
I am good

598
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,559
I can sing,dance

599
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,688
We'll sing a rap song

600
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,527
I know Karate also

601
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,073
Now he will break the coconut
with his hands

602
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,740
Everyone clap loudly

603
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,271
Why have you committed?

604
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,282
Since you've come here
you have to impress them

605
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,613
I'll deal with
you in the house

606
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,952
He is going to break,
He is going to break

607
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:04,560
Brave!

608
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,427
Now,he is going to break
iron-rod

609
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:06,892
You!!

610
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,164
Not today,some other day

611
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,626
Now,tell me
How am I

612
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,498
Hey! Old lady! Did you like it?

613
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,168
You are an multifaceted
son-in-law

614
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,364
You have impressed them

615
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,366
Who are you?

616
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,366
Don't you watch T.V?

617
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:21,837
I am looking after
the fields

618
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,508
I've impressed the entire state
by my report -

619
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,649
What is your profession?

620
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,317
I am a reporterf
in Q T.V

621
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,053
Is it a Goverment job?

622
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,586
No,it's a Private job

623
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,588
I want a Government job

624
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,859
They won't give
you in this age

625
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,451
Don't be silly

626
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,992
My son-in-law should be a
government servant

627
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,397
Sir,ln my private job I
am earning Rs.7000/- p.m

628
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,604
I am getting all the benefits
like a government servant

629
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,675
Not like Government I want
only a government servant

630
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,540
How many private channels
have started

631
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,939
And how many of them
have closed down.Do you know?

632
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,412
Even if you earn a pie it should
be from the government job -

633
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,078
Only in that house my daughter
will be comfortable

634
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,747
Don't waste our time
Go away

635
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,890
Come with the government job
then,we'll discuss -

636
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,177
You are not in town on
Saturday & Sunday?

637
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,241
How many times
I had phoned you?

638
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,005
Where had you gone?

639
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,011
We went to meet Kunjaee

640
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:32,910
Hey! Keep quiet

641
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,048
He is joking

642
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,512
It's Monday today,isn't it?

643
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,118
Why are you late?

644
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,321
I went to register my name for
marriage in the Employment exchange

645
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,853
For marriage,you went to
employment exchange

646
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,053
For a husband's job

00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,528
Shall we talk
some business

648
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:48,926
Go ahead

649
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,401

652
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,195
C.M!!

653
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,610
Normally,Janardhanan is the one who
interviews political persons

654
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,402
He has resigned &
joined U T.V

655
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:04,814
Cheat

656
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,147
I didn't know

657
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,945
This is a big opportunity
for you

658
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:12,086
lmmediately after promotion
nobody will get such a chance

659
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,187
Why are your hands
trembling?

660
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,063
I am interviewing
C.M for the first time

661
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,231
That's why I
am nervous

662
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,701
Don't be scared
of C.M

663
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,634
You talk with him
like a neighbour

664
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:31,702
It will look natural

665
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:40,381

A special guest that I am
going to interview today -

679
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,520
Not only our country -

680
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,386
But the entire world -

681
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,524
Doesn't need any introduction
to him

682
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:58,858
Greetings,sir

683
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,053
Greetings

684
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,790
In every election,
Public votes -

685
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,800
With a faith that elected C.M
will do some good for them -

686
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,530
In the end they are cheated
and disappointed

687
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,875
This is happening in our
Government also

688
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,344
Sir,What is the reason
for that?

689
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,173
What are you saying?

690
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,872
In every house,there is
a Colour T.V -

691
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,413
In every village,there is
Dish antena -

692
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,751
In every street,there is
an S.T.D Booth - & Internet

693
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,618
All are going
on Two wheelers

694
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,285
In jewellery shops &
Garment stores

695
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,889
There is a big
queue of buyers

696
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,351
They are going to amusement parks
& expensive restaurants

697
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:34,189
Not only that,they are wearing
slippers & watches

698
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,298
The standard of living
of people has increased

699
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,625
For the last 15 years -

700
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,634
Is there any news of people dying
out of hunger & poverty

701
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,904
As you say,no farmer is going
to a jewellery shop

702
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,634
No labourer is going
to the restaurant

703
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,371
People who are earning illegally
& taking bribes -

704
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,640
Are only leading such
luxurious lives

705
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,982
Rich are becoming richer
& the Poor are becoming poorer

706
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,448
They are still being squeezed
in buses and trains

707
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,715
The people are still standing in
queues for Kerosene & Rice for hours

708
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,257
They are sending the children to
school only for the nutritious noon meals

709
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,731
Sir,our children are still
begging on the streets

710
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,797
Some people always complain!

711
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:19,003
Brother! After I came to power the
literacy rate his gone up to 62.5./.

712
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,871
But sir,State of Kerala
has achieved 100./.

713
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:25,406
As for industries is concerned from
7th place it has come up to 5th

714
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,682
Sir,don't we have more respect for a
Gold medal winner than a Bronze

715
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,890
People below the poverty line has
come down from 39./. to 32./.

716
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:41,224
But,still in our villages,the average
income of a man is still Rs.3/- only

717
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:44,764
Brother,You have to talk only when
you are well aware of the statistics

718
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:46,963
Sir,Just a minute!

719
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,506
Sir,This is a report from
World Economic Forum!

720
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,901
This is a IMF report! -

721
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,510
This is from Amnesty
International

722
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,773
This is World Bank's report!

723
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,378
The Credit from World Bank has not
reached the people properly -

724
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,780
And that your ministers have
gobbled up all the funds -

725
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,319
Saying this they have cancelled
the next instalment also

726
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,448
Brother! You don't know?

727
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,184
The World Bank people have almost asked
for the mortgage of our state -

728
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,328
Putting 1008 conditions

729
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,529
What are those conditions?
Would you specify it?

730
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:16,993
That's not for you!!

731
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,258
I'll tell it to the people!

732
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,268
The people are watching!
Please tell me!

733
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,805
Why did the World Bank stop the fund
which we should have got?

734
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,132
Brother! It's a 1000 page
report!

735
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,741
There are 18 annexures

736
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,807
Pay Rs.15 and get a copy from
Secretariate!

737
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,143
And then read it leisurely and
explain it to the people

738
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,140
Next question!

739
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,086
Sir,Are you from an affluent family
before entering Politics?

740
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,218
No,I am from an ordinary
farmer's family!

741
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,087
Oh! What is your salary?

742
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:45,626
What?!

743
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,090
What is your salary?

744
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,366
After all deductions,I get
about Rs.18,000

745
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,432
Say that's! About Rs.2 Lakhs per
year

746
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,973
After addition and deductions
your total earning till now -

747
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,166
May not exceed 25 lakhs!

748
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,907
But,today you own properties
worth 800 crores!

749
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,903
How did you earn those properties?

750
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:07,847
Cat on a Hot tin!!

751
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,778
This is false accusation!

752
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,187
If you want to,you can file a
case against me in the court!

753
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,415
I'll come to the court and prove
myself to be innocent

754
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:14,957
Case?!

755
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,893
In the past 10-15 yrs,Pending cases
awaiting prosecution are 14 lakhs

756
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:26,232
This delay has emboldened the
Criminals to do more crime -

757
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,570
I am not saying this...

758
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,736
This Human Rights Commission
report is saying

759
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,577
Do you remember this?

760
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,745
I remember having seen it!

761
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,915
Your election manifesto!
Don't your remember it?

762
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,752
How can I forget it? I was the
one who wrote it

763
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,087
Every promise,I can remember
it by heart

764
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,252
To form a castless
society..

765
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,251
To maintain peace in law and order -

766
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,086
To protect women

767
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,091
To distribute the basic commodities
at a reasonable price

768
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,093
Free education to all -

769
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,597
There was a spelling error there
I know it by heart

770
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,099
Do you think all these have
been achieved?

771
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,429
Are you saying that we
haven't achieved it?

772
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,435
You are saying that you'll maintain
peace in law & order -

773
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,098
But,you are the man behind
the chaos in Law & order

774
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,606
You said you'll form a
casteless society -

775
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,612
But,you are the one who instigates
those caste conflicts!

776
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,109
Brother!

777
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,287
Are you questioning me!with an
intention only to to anger me?

778
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,116
That's not my intention! People
should know the truth!

779
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,189
Please have a look!

780
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,588
Stop all the buses running
in Tamilnadu

781
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,596
Will you go across me?

782
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,528
If you run over and kill me,Will my
caste's people leave you?

783
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,064
The whole of Tamilnadu
will burn

784
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,201
A driver stops his bus on the road
and creates a traffic jam

785
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,870
If asked,he says he is from
the ruling party!

786
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,478
The traffic police are unable
to take any action on him

787
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,875
Another driver falls at the tyres and
threatens in the name of caste

788
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,479
A Police Commissioner is unable
to do his duty!

789
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,017
And,When you were asked to
take the action -

790
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,088
Fear of losing that caste's
support -

791
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,885
You remained silent without
taking any action

792
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,622
The Whole of Tamilnadu
was burning!

793
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,222
You were not bothered
about that!

794
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,232
A lot of people were affected,but
you were not bothered about it

795
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,828
Loses were a staggering 300 crores
but that's not important for you

796
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,974
The only aim you have is not to
lose your seat of power.Isn't it?

797
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,184
To make this interview a sensation
and make a name out of this -

798
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,786
You shoudldn't ask without any
evidential support

799
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,186
I have the evidence

800
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,125
In this one driver
belongs to my party -

801
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,588
Another belongs to a Caste which was
instrumental in my election wins

802
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,386
I need student's support also!

803
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,258
Whomsoever you lay your hands on
will lead into more trouble

804
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,465
That will affect me!

805
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,994
They'll shout for sometime
and disperse!

806
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,732
Hey! If I wanted,I would have given
the shooting orders long back -

807
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,075
Do you know how much more trouble
it would have created?

808
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,812
Don't bother about breaking up of
a few glass windows?

809
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,343
You just keep quiet!

810
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,077
Now tell me

811
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,883
Aren't you more concerned about your
seat than the welfare of the people?

812
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,493
Come on & speak!

813
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:17,236
What's going on?

814
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,166
Aranganar,has been rendered
speechless!

815
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,368
Hey! You come on reply him!

816
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,376
He's blushing!

817
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,175
Very nicely cornered him!

818
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:26,377
Switch off!

819
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:30,175
I'll kill you!

820
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:33,849
Tell him,to switch off!

821
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,450
Hey!ls it way to Interview!

822
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,719
Stop the camera!

823
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,187
Stop the camera!

824
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,336
Hey! Baldie! I'll hit you
with my slippers!

825
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,264
Stop the programme! I am warning
you to stop it!

826
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,607
Are you interviewing?
I'll kill you!

827
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,934
Hey! Palavesham! Turn the camera
to the control room -

828
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,135
A person here is showing
his slippers

829
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,869
I'll burn down the T.V station!

830
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,277
Oh! God they are picturising
even this!

831
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:02,607
Hey! Brainless!

832
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:03,750
If this had been a legislature

833
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,409
We could have expunged the remarks
from the house records

834
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,283
This is a live telecast,the whole of
Tamilnadu will be watching this

835
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:07,946
Throw down the slippers!

836
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,086
Will I also be seen?

837
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,758
What you? You,the slippers
in your hand -

838
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,757
The dung in your slippers,
everything will be seen

839
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,021
You imbecile! Throw it down!
Unable to bear the stench!

840
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,226
Sir,He wants to become
an M.P

841
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,355
Brother! Will you please
make way?

842
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,364
Sir,Will you take the light?

843
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,967
Leader! Discontinue the interview
and get up!

844
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,037
That's all the interview
is over,isn't it?

845
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:24,901
Greetings!

846
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,442
Sir! The interview is
not yet over -

847
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,242
It's a live relay and the people
are watching!

848
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,510
You have not yet answered
my question!

849
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,580
So Please sit down!

850
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,517
You have dubbed it
very nicely!

851
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,389
You have dubbed my voice with
someone who has the same tone -

852
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:49,725
And trying to mar my reputation
in public -

853
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,194
I don't have to reply
for all this!

854
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,470
I had only photographed
that strike

855
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,334
How much bribe did you take from
the opposition party?

856
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,812
How much you would've paid had you
been in the opposition?

857
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,850
With a mike in a hand and
a T.V station to boot -

858
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,347
Wearing a coat,you'll
ask anything -

859
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,680
For that,do I have to
answer them?

860
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,354
Answering them is
your duty!

861
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,020
For that only,6 Crore people
have elected you!

862
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,285
Do you know what does a
C.M's position mean?

863
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,962
Did you ever step the threshold
of the C.M's office?

864
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:22,890
Come and see!

865
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,826
How many people come to
meet me on a day

866
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,968
How many fulls and empties?
How many tears?

867
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,230
How many thanks giving?
How many critical times?

868
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,566
How many garlands?
How many riots?

869
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:33,706
How many problems?

870
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,311
How much of tension,only he knows
who is sitting there?

871
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,713
Nothing can be decided on
a spurr of a moment

872
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,041
If a disturbance out breaks -

873
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:42,843
We'll have to foresee -

874
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,113
And take a decision,which will not
affect anyone in future

875
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,050
I have done that only!

876
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,654
The problem that could have been
solved easily -

877
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,319
You wantonly made it to grow bigger
for your personal gains

878
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,327
Now,don't give silly reasons!

879
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,260
I am saying that,if you put your
finger in the fire,lt'll burn you

880
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,595
You are not able to
understand it

881
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,471
You put your finger and see only
then you'll understand

882
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:09,873
One day...For one day you become
a C.M

883
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:11,541
Then you'll understand!

884
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,008
This is not the correct answer!

885
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,212
How can I sit in
your seat?

886
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,875
It may be good for
an argument!

887
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,151
But,is it possible?

888
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,087
It is possible!

889
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,016
There is a provision for it
in the Constitutional law

890
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,091
I can issue an ordinance
to that effect -

891
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:23,884
You see it for yourself
for one day!

892
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,822
Me?! You are joking!

893
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,029
I am saying it seriously!

894
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,096
For one day you sit
on my seat -

895
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,428
My seat is a bed of thorns and
a crown of thorns

896
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,159
You'll understand

897
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,562
What can be done? What
cannot be done?

898
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,705
You'll understand it clearly!

899
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,306
After that how difficult
is the C.M's position -

900
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,734
Go and explain it to the
people of this country!

901
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,326
Say ''Yes'',say ''Yes''
Say ''Yes'' say ''Yes''

902
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,520
What's this? They are playing a one
day match with the C.M's seat

903
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,333
Our C.M is talking silly since his
visit to the State of Bihar

904
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,936
No sir,That's not my job!

905
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,800
Look,you are backing off
from the Challenge!

906
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:14,600
That's it!

907
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,476
Never play silly with a
National leader

908
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,814
When given an responsibility you'll
back off but always question

909
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:23,684
That's it!

910
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:28,391
When a person like you is given a
responsibility and challenged directly

911
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,619
You are backing off!

912
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,694
What? Will you try it
for a day?

913
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,106
It's a live relay,People are
watching -

914
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,300
Come on reply!

915
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,714
Shall we stop this
interview?

916
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:59,278
Yes sir,if it is possible
then I am ready

917
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,783
One day,I'll be in your
position and see

918
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,734
He's got stucked up as he challenges
the general body meeting

919
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,062
Okay,let it be

920
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,604
Let me atleast in my life work with
an educated C.M for a day

921
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,066
Okay,brother!

922
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,670
Victory to India!

923
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:43,896
Hey,move,move

924
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,867
Excellent!!

925
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,767
Pugal! My dear friend!!

926
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,170
Excellent job!!

927
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,257
Silence,Silence

928
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:15,192
He has simply asked him to
become C.M for one day

929
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,932
Please tell us,whether it is
admissable in law or not?

930
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:18,726
It is

931
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,192
There is a precedence

932
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:21,666
When the assembly is
not in session -

933
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,271
We can do it
by an ordinance

934
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:23,803
Otherwise

935
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,472
Say it

936
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:29,467
Sometimes ago,ln Bihar wasn't
a C.M appointed temporarily?

937
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,939
In Delhi,After the death
of a leader

938
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,945
Wasn't the son appointed
as Prime Minsiter?

939
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,806
After the death of
the leaders-

940
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,008
It's usually done like this

941
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,487
When a C.M went for a bye-pass
It has happened like this

942
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,881
Once it has happened
in this State also

943
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,223
To appoint a person as
a C.M for one day -

944
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,224
Does he have the authority
or not?

945
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,129
Hey! Don't talk in English

946
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,099
Tell me,ls it possible
or not?

947
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:55,971
It is possible

948
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,371
By using your
discretionary powers

949
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,508
And notifying in the gazette
it can be done

950
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:01,967
Leader,What's this?

951
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:02,837
Because it is possible

952
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,138
Should anybody be appointed
as the C.M for one day

953
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,680
Poison can be drunk
but should it be drunk?

954
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,317
Why to take this risk?

955
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:15,654
You don't know

956
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,085
This is a game of politics

957
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,654
That day,when so many people
were watching the T.V

958
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,227
He said,I was giving
importance to caste vote

959
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,829
That's why during the strike -

960
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,159
He cornered by saying that I
didn't take action on anyone

961
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,164
What will you reply?

962
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:27,063
Can I accept the truth?

963
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,203
They will hit
with slippers

964
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,566
Tomorrow I can't face the
Public for votes -

965
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,706
That's why I
challenged him

966
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,536
Suppose if he does
something on that day

967
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,274
He can't do anything

968
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,913
Before he comes to
know the duties of C.M

969
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,013
That one day will
be over

970
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,748
You see,he will go mad
& run away

971
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,510
Two birds in one shot

972
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,018
Because one person
has blamed

973
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,521
This Araganathan has
given up his post

974
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:50,749
And this will enhance
my image

975
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,518
It is easy to
blame others

976
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,026
But doing something is difficult
public will understand this fact

977
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,323
Leader,Whatever you are saying
it may be true,agreed

978
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,902
This is my
resignation letter

979
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,837
For appointing Mr.Pugalenthi as the
C.M for one day

980
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,572
This is a letter from
145 M.L.A's supporting him

981
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,514
I,N.Pugalenthi

982
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,715
In the name of the Government

983
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,786
I accept the post
of C.M of the state

984
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,658
Under the law of Indian
Secrets Act -

985
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,666
I abide to protect all Government
Secrets that come to my knowledge

986
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,801
I give my assurance -

987
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,543
Greetings! Viewers

988
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,147
C.M of one day is taking
his charge

989
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,288
In the history of Indian
Politics -

990
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,319
This is the first time that such a
live telecast is being taken -

991
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,359
To telecast this

992
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,591
The State has crowded with
all the National Channels

993
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,096
Counsellor himself is coming
in a contessa -

994
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,498
And the C.M is coming in a
Public transport

995
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,371
I think,the Country has
definitely progressed

996
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:11,896
Please come

997
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,768
Why are you disturbing him,
he has just arrived

998
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,862
Till yesterday you yourself were
an ordinary T.V reporter -

999
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,337
Even without your expectation
suddenly out of the blue,one day

1000
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,977
You are sitting on the C.M's seat
how are you feeling about it?

1001
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:48,944
You'll have to excuse
me -

1002
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,806
I am not sitting here for
giving an interview

1003
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,244
I am thinking of doing something
creative and constructive

1004
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,116
Thank you so much for
your love

1005
01:05:58,988 --> 01:05:59,215
Listen to what
is said

1006
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,552
I want to immediately see all the officials
from I.A.S & I.P.S Departments-

1007
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:04,021
Make the arrangement

1008
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,620
Greetings to one
and all

1009
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,363
Sir,he is Anand Krishnan
I.A.S

1010
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,166
I have no time for
the introductions

1011
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,301
There are 3 people responsible in
tarnishing the growth of this country

1012
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:20,971
One

1013
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,235
Those who are not abiding by
their assigned duties

1014
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:24,169
Two

1015
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,712
Those who become a hindrance,while
others performing their duties

1016
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:26,380
Three

1017
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,182
Those who are misusing their
authorities

1018
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,442
The criminal to get rid of
his crime -

1019
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,177
By threatening,by apple polishing,
by luring -

1020
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,915
Or by giving the other a
share of his bribe -

1021
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,188
Are washing away their
sins

1022
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,120
This starts from an ordinary
peon -

1023
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,858
And reaches till the level of I.A.S,I.P.S
Officers and also till the Ministers

1024
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,055
There is no one who punishes
them -

1025
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,460
Nor there is any fear among them
of getting punished

1026
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,461
On such people,the complaints
that have been registered -

1027
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:50,935
And the action for it,Which has
still not been taken -

1028
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:55,168
All those files,within 1 hours time
should be brought to my notice

1029
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,076
Make a phone call,deliver a fax,
Telex,go in a taxi,or a helicopter

1030
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,481
Within 1 hour,I need to get
the list of such people

1031
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:08,419
And if I don't get it,I'll even have to
add your names in that list

1032
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,817
What are we going to do with
that list?

1033
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,220
I am going to suspend all
those people

1034
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,226
Okay,the meeting is over,you
may all go

1035
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,030
Great! He hit a sixer in the
very first ball itself

1036
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,992
Sir,What's this even you have
come to the slums

1037
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:58,538
Like others are you also going to give
rice,tooth powder,sarees etc

1038
01:07:58,707 --> 01:07:59,139
Not that -

1039
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,237
I believe that there shouldn't be
any slums in our country

1040
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,675
Even our Politician's think
in the same way -

1041
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,675
And they burn slums

1042
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,138
Come here

1043
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,941
Government has allotted a separate
place for you

1044
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,476
And it has also built houses
for you -

1045
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:10,949
Even after that,Why do you people
stay here?

1046
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,088
Sir,What's this totally there are
350 huts -

1047
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,879
Among them,only if 2 are
allotted the houses -

1048
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:16,149
Where would rest of the
people go?

1049
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,226
Who is the director responsible
for allocating these?

1050
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,420
Here he is,
come fast

1051
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,490
How many houses are allotted
for this slum?

1052
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:23,290
The thing is...

1053
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,427
Hello,Reply promptly

1054
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,898
212 houses

1055
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,702
This man says only 2 houses
have been allotted

1056
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:29,633
What about
the rest

1057
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:30,499
Gone with the wind

1058
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,575
Sir,half of the place allotted to them
is been taken away by the Politicians

1059
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,338
And in the rest of the place
the houses are built

1060
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,036
Even in that,most of it are taken
by the members of ruling party -

1061
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,841
And persons holding such authorities
like him

1062
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,438
This man must be
having atleast 20 flats

1063
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,777
Apart from that if they
allot the houses -

1064
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,647
They let it out on rent and
stay here

1065
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,243
Here he is,Yalaimalai,even he
has been allotted a house -

1066
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,050
But he has let it out on
rent to a boss for Rs.1000

1067
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:48,623
Ay,shut up

1068
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:51,626
Inspite of knowing all these,Why
haven't you still taken any action?

1069
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,955
Sir,There is a pressure from
the Ministerial level

1070
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,860
Sir,They are the one who cast
their votes

1071
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,089
Which educated person is
casting his vote?

1072
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,360
They give 1000 lame excuses,sit in
the house and watch T.V

1073
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,367
If they are driven away,will they
not lose their votes? -

1074
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,698
That's why they are totally
ignored

1075
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,829
Sir,Where is the typewriter
which I had asked for?

1076
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,531
You'll get it,Ay
come fast

1077
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:06,999
What's your name?

1078
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,537
Make his suspension order
ready

1079
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,209
Sir,What are you
saying?

1080
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:16,140
Sir,Don't do it,ask him
to stop

1081
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:20,885
Yallaimallai,come here

1082
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,014
In which area,you were allotted
the house?

1083
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:24,416
You come with me

1084
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,355
In this slum,to all those people
who have been allotted the house -

1085
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,691
Vacant all those huts and come
with everybody to Velachery

1086
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,118
Yallaimalai,which is your
house?

1087
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:58,988
The first house in the
Ground floor

1088
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,595
Who's it?

1089
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:12,272
Oh I see,come in,do you
want tea?

1090
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,408
Ay,We don't want anything,
whose house is this?

1091
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:15,268
It's my house

1092
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,200
What's your name?

1093
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,070
My name is
Yallaimallai

1094
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,207
If you are Yallaimallai,then
am I Bill Clinton?

1095
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,780
lmmediately,vacate this house and
hand it over to him

1096
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,714
Sir,Why should I vacate,I have
given money

1097
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:24,684
Why should I vacate
the house?

1098
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,187
Look,This house has been
allotted to him

1099
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,018
According to the law,your staying
here is a crime

1100
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,149
We'll have to take an action on you,
If you at once don't vacate the house -

1101
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,021
You'll have to count
the bars

1102
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:32,821
Alright sir

1103
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,824
Sushma,Take out everything we'll
go to Sowcarpet

1104
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:37,893
lmmediately,he remembers
his place

1105
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,635
In the same way,check all the
other flats

1106
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,044
Sir,I have brought
everybody

1107
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,572
Ask those people to vacate,who are
illegally staying over here -

1108
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,116
And make these people stay in their
respective houses allotted to them -

1109
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,578
From now,They'll only stay
over here

1110
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,789
When we go that side

1111
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,191
If you let it out on rent
& if you stay in hut

1112
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,331
I'll rip you apart

1113
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,767
Are we really interested in
staying in those huts?

1114
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,792
Many of our family members
are jobless -

1115
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,403
We survive only because of the rent,
that we get from the house

1116
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:19,802
Sir,to eke our livelihood,if you
make any arrangements for a job

1117
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,465
Sir,the god will definitely
bless you

1118
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,341
A request to the natives
of the State

1119
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,950
My holding the post of a C.M
for 1 day -

1120
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,279
Is known to
everybody

1121
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,216
If I have to do something
good

1122
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,685
For that,definitely,I
need your co-operation

1123
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,487
What you all have
to do is -

1124
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:40,825
For this one day

1125
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,628
Whatever commodity
you buy

1126
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:44,027
Whether a match box or
a car -

1127
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,430
Whether Gold or
a Diamond -

1128
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,092
A hair pin or
an aeroplane

1129
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,629
Anything you buy,buy only
after paying the tax

1130
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:50,972
If the shop-keeper doesn't make
the bill -

1131
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:51,968
Definitely ask him to
make it -

1132
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,499
The tax is one,which is accounted
to the Govt.

1133
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,645
In one day,What is the total
sum collected -

1134
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,779
Even you should be
knowing it

1135
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,516
You're not asking for bill if you get
goods Rs.2 less than its actual price

1136
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,515
The money which has to rotate
in the market -

1137
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,654
It reaches the owners as
black money

1138
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,779
That's why I request everybody
to pay the tax -

1139
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,115
If anybody is refusing to give
the bill -

1140
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,849
Lodge a complaint in the
nearby Police Station

1141
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,386
Rs.350/-

1142
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,186
Ay,make the bill
and give

1143
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,663
This is in regard to the
business men

1144
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,058
If anyone of you do business,without
making a bill -

1145
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,064
Your licence will be
cancelled

1146
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,802
Make sure,such a situation
doesn't arise

1147
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:26,268
And above that,if you pay your
earlier dues today itself

1148
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:30,539
I'll cancel all the charges against
you in the sales tax commission

1149
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,477
Ay,in one day what is the sales tax amount
that we are supposed to pay legally?

1150
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:35,411
40 Lakhs

1151
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,208
How much are we
paying?

1152
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:37,283
Only 4 Lakhs

1153
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:38,348
That is what,he is
asking

1154
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,751
Pay it,otherwise,he'll snatch
the licence

1155
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:42,351
Alright sir

1156
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,022
Ay,What is he
up to?

1157
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,023
What idea has
he got?

1158
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:48,891
He is totally
raw

1159
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,357
If he collects the Sales Tax
is that enough?

1160
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:52,759
He is building castles in
the air

1161
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:54,899
Ay,Finance Minister -

1162
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,899
What is the income of 1 days
Sales Tax?

1163
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,437
For the party or for
the nation?

1164
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,309
For the nation

1165
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,444
I don't know

1166
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,572
Shit,you are a bloody
Minister

1167
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,108
Stop eating, get up and
get lost

1168
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:24,397
Sir, did you see it

1169
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,192
Catch him, catch him,

1170
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,732
Ay,What's all this?

1171
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:35,270
Sir, the lesson he learnt in his school
about the magnet power-

1172
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,672
How well he is
using it?

1173
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,204
These people brains have
no match at all

1174
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:39,344
What will be its
weight?

1175
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,140
It should be around 200 gms

1176
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,682
Hey! man,if you are underweighing
200 gms for 2 kg!

1177
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,410
With this weight how much you would
be stealing in a day?

1178
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:46,144
Is it right? You
blood sucker!

1179
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,555
Hey! What's this?
What's all this?

Whichever side you measure,it will
measure only 21/2 litres!

1181
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,961
By taking a commission in
measuring kerosene -

1182
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,499
He has won a world cup!

1183
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:00,964
Catch it!

1184
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:06,231
Sir,after calculations he's swindling
about Rs.1500 per day!

01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,905
He is earning more than the
C.M for a month!

1186
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,969
Hey! Whose money do you
think it is?

1187
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,045
It's all these peoples!

1188
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:16,110
Look,by paper picking,plastic picking
from all the streets -

1189

Working as servant maids,labouring,
supplying Milk sachets

1190
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,321
It's all their hard earned
poor people's money

1191
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,191
Sir,What can be done to
this man? Tell me!

Sir,the people are very
enthusiastic!

1195
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,064
If we hand over him to them,they'll
measure him with his weights & measures!

1196
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,133
No No we'll have to dismiss
him from his job!

1197
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:33,529

Take that and give it to
your doctor! -

1223
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:11,255
And tell him that he is suspended and
can stay back at this clinic -

01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:12,763
As instructed by the
Chief Minsiter!

Like a sparrow,saved money
and brought a TVS 50!

1228
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:24,271
For my husband to go

We have reported it to the police,but
no action has been taken for a week

1231
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,282
Even if they don't take
any action its okay!

1232
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:34,614
But,they are illtreating,sir
Please enquire about it?

Did you find out the
lost vehicle?

01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:53,467
People have lost Honda cars and

01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,473
Do you think I'll take action for a

1245
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,974
What will you do? Are you such a big shot
to complaint to the DSP?

1246
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,482
You'll not get your
TVS 50!

1247
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,158
Take it for granted that your vehicle
has been sold in parts!

1248
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,329
Mr.Kattamuthu! Please cut off the
phone and switch on the fax!

1249
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,154

01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,344
Someone wants to give a
kiss to you!

1256
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:30,840

Yes!

1262
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,524
But the shirt you are wearing
is not nice!

1263
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,527
Had it been blue colour shirt

01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,389
Eve teasing here has reached
beyond our tolerance!

1270
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:23,720
Boys from the neighbourhood slums
are teasing the girls

1271
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,058
It's been happening everyday!

1272
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,734
Which is the nearest
Police station?

1273
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,403
Police? We have reported to
them many times! -

1274
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,071
They are afraid to take any
kind of action on them!

1275
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,240
I am coming over there
right now!

1276
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,568
Instruct that area inspector
to be in the spot!

1277
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,240
Driver! Take immediately to
the nearest hospital!

that girl?

A rogue trying to hold her hand
has injured her -

1283
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,431
And they are taking her to
a hospital!

1284
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,259
Mr.Krishnan! Follow it up
immediately!

You have been receiving so many
complaints about eve teasing!

1286
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,095
What were you doing?

1287
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,771
It's a small accident,these girls
are making it big!

1288
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,269
No sir,they are lying!

1289
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,106
Please be quiet!

1290
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,434
Hey! you keep shut! Come on
you carry on!

1291
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:10,941
In the nearby Kasi slum,there
are 10 to 15 rogues! -

1292
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,773
Their whole time job to is
to tease girls!

1293
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:17,111
Their boss is Alan,a big rowdy!
Who's involved in political murders

1294
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,785
They never take any action against him
because of the ruling party's support

1295
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,781
On that strength,those scoundrel's
are falling on us!

1296
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,460
Every time they are patting on
our backs!

1297
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,288
It's really disgusting!

1298
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,463
Don't you feel ashamed of
listening to this?

1299
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,134
Aren't you being paid
only for catching them?

1300
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,633
Sir,the police cannot enter
into that area!

1301
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,305
Those who had gone like,Head constable,
Constable,lnspector

1302
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:39,132
They have all killed them!

1303
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,309
Why? Haven't you been given a uniform?
Haven't you been issued a weapon?

1304
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,981
Sir,the commissioner has
restricted my power!

1305
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,823
Sir,the minister has
restricted my power

1306
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,657
Mr.Mayakrishnan,without missing
anyone place everyone in the list

1307
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:04,991
Without leaving anyone!

1308
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:17,845
Which one here is
Alan's house?

1309
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,010
If you go straight the first house
on the left!

1310
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,183
Hey! Look on the T.V! Seems
to be a familiar place!

1311
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,689
It's our area!

1312
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:30,520
Our area!?

1313
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,352

1314
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:33,690
See here and play uncle!

1315
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:35,362
He's entering into some house
in our area!

01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,189
To your house only!!

1317
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,534
What man!? Have you come
to interview me?

1318
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:41,360
To release your sprain!

1319

Come on,now say!! Say it

01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:05,509
Women are like our eyes!

1323
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:07,014
Chanting this,get into the van!

1324
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:13,017
Women are like our eyes!
Women are like our eyes!

1325
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,361
Mr.Mayakrishnan! What about
the sales tax collections?

1326
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:25,362
Sir,Very high collections

1327
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:29,025
All the treasury's of Tamilnadu have
exceeded till now 260 Crores

1328
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,208
Use up all the collected money
for the poor slum dewellers -

1329
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,708
To create job opportunities according
to their education and skills

1330
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:38,708
Okay sir,lt's a very
good idea!

1331
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:49,386
Sir,What happened to the list that I had
asked for today morning?

1332
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,216
Sir,lt's ready!

1333
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,720
It's divided separately,district wise
in the order of its seniority

1334
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,729
These are those who didn't do
their duties properly

1335
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,397
These are those who interfere
in others doing their duty

1336
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,226
That are those who misuse
their authority

1337
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,232
Sir,Totally there are
46,518 people!

1338
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,238
Suspend everyone
indiscriminately!

1339
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,407
lt'll be night 12 before we can
sign these papers!

1340
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:15,909
We have a very
short time!

1341
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,917
Issue an omni bus order!
Send through internet!

1342
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,256
Like an examination result,paste
it on a notice board

1343
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:23,591
They all should be suspended!

1344
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,923
I'll issue orders empowering all the
collectors for suspending them

1345
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,925
Sir,but there are some Collectors
also in the list

1346
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:30,764
Then for them you sign
the orders!

1347
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,432
If your name is in the list
then I'll sign your order!

1348
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,261
Oh! No sir,I am clean!

1349
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:36,604
I am just a little talkative
other than that

1350
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,773
I don't even use
a pencil of the office

1351
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,941
Sir,Even the cell phone bills I am
paying it from my salary

1352
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:44,111
On what strength so many people
have committed there mistakes?

1353
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,447
Only on the strength of Ministers of
all those departments -

1354
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:47,615
Because even they get
their share

1355
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,283
Which are the Ministers involved
in this?

1356
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,282
Revenue Department,Housing Board
Food and Public Works Depts.

1357
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,784
Totally 12 department's
Ministers are involved

1358
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,449
Sir,What shall we do
with them?

1359
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:57,955
Actually,they should be
arrested!

1360
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:58,625
Then do it!

1361
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,800
Pugalenthi Down Down!!
Pugalenthi Down Down!

1362
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:19,808
Pugalenthi Down Down!
Pugalenthi Down Down!

1363
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:30,988
Look leader! He has
come here also!

1364
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,329
12 of your Ministers have
indulged on corruption

1365
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:36,990
We have evidences for that!

1366
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,166
Excuse me!

1367
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,328
I have no other option other than
to arrest them!

1368
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:44,163
If you lay your hands on anyone
I'll kill you!

1369
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,506
Ask them to come in!

1370
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:03,357
Hey! Do you want your corpse to float
in Cooum river by tomorrow?

1371
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,192
That isn't so easy!

1372
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,020
All the Press people are
watching!

1373
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:08,688
Please advice them to extend
their Co-operation!

1374
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:46,992
Constable,break open the
door

1375
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,540
Sir,I just came to
the loo

1376
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:16,860
Leader,What's this?

1377
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,802
In just one day,I haven't made any
social reform or achievement -

1378
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,595
I have just abided by the duty
of this position

1379
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,765
If you would have done this for
the last 5 years

1380
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,373
Our country would have become
a celestial ground

1381
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,276
Thank you so much for
your advice

1382
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:31,771
Your one day
is over -

1383
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:33,212
You can go

1384
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:35,774
Still there are five minutes
to go -

1385
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,518
There is one final work,which
I have to accomplish

1386
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:44,390
You are the root cause for so many
people to commit mistakes

1387
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,454
You are highly responsible to those people
in having committed those corruptions

1388
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:49,622
That's why -

1389
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,423
I am arresting you also!!

1390
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,131
Don't talk like a
kid

1391
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:01,569
You don't know the
law

1392
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,744
It's not a joke in arresting
a Chief Minister

1393
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,675
For it,There is need of governor's signature,
Supreme Court's permission -

1394
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,543
And 1008 other formalities
are required

1395
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,275
Don't talk without
knowing the details,Go

1396
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,284
Excuse me,Today I am the
Chief Minister -

1397
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:15,951
And you are just an
ordinary man

1398
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,423
I have all the rights in
arresting you

1399
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,159
Arrest him

1400
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:30,165
Oh my god,This was not at all
in our list

1401
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,986

1406
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,598
Leader got trapped us
by his strangle talk

1407
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:03,703
Once again,lf he comes back,
I am dead

1408
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,699
Thinking,What will he do in a day he has
put the whole lot behind the bars

1409
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,209
Release our leader!

01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:13,537

Advocates move to the front,you are

1416
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,426
Sir,Lawyers have come!

1417

When will you get
me released?

1419
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,200
He'll put me in a Central Jail
before dawn

1420
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,704
So do something
immediately!

1421
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,934
We have done all the work,all you
have to do is sign these papers

1422
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:19,575
We'll go to the Magistrate's residence
and come back with the bail

1423
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:20,042
Take that!

1424
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:27,076
You,importantly!

All important orders taken as
a one day C.M -

Get a stay order to make
it ineffective!

1427
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:30,153
Yes sir!

1428
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,952
I'll issue an ordinance and render
all his decisions null and void

1429
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,421
Shall I leave now sir?

1430
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:35,960
Go and get the bail
immediately!Go man!

1431
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:37,796
Hey!You,Maya Krishnan!

1432
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:38,789
Got struck!

1433
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,659
Where are you
sneaking out?

1434
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:46,133
Sir,lt was very paining for me
to see you in this position

1435
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,466
So,I was avoiding you

1436
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,074
Don't cry and deceive me!

1437
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,211
I know,that you were with him and
adviced him in everything!isn't it?

1438
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,140
I swear on you sir,I did
nothing like that

1439
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:54,712
I was going with him around
just like that!

1440
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:57,883
Blind man! Had he been illiterate he
wouldn't have understood anything -

1441
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:01,019
He was educated enough to understand
everything in one day

1442
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:02,246
He was clever!

1443
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,424
Don't play double game
with me!

1444
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,489
By dawn,I'll be the Chief Minister!
Do you remember?

1445
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:08,821
Oh! My god! I am a family man
don't take revenge on me

1446
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,094
Shall I arrange someone to throw acid
on his face?

1447
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,290
Say yes,I'll arrange it!

1448
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,567
We'll forgive him and
leave him!

1449
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:16,996
No sir! We'll have to do
something!

1450
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:23,002
What's this sir? For a small scratch,
you broke a man's hand -

1451
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:24,439
That guy has hurt
your heart -

1452
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,078
And you want to forgive and
leave him

1453
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:29,107
Left him...but
didn't forgive him

1454
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:30,913
A small boy...

1455
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:36,282
Has defaced my 30 years
of political life

1456
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,518
For all his one day's achievements
he should be consecreted -

1457
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:47,359
With Milk,Honey and BLOOD!!

1458
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:26,005
Screwing up means this is
the best screwing up!

1459
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:29,040
Screwed up all the 46 people at a
time that's called the real screw up

1460
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,470
Even after requesting you'll never
turn up for work!

1461
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:32,507
But yesterday's screwing seems to
have worked out -

1462
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:33,543
Coming for work so early

1463
01:37:33,747 --> 01:37:34,611
What?! Beedi?!

1464
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:35,707
No,Soda water!!

1465
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:40,117
If that man becomes the
Prime Minister of India -

1466
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,345
He'll wash everything clean

1467
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:47,224
Hey! He's our one day
Chief Minsiter!

1468
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:52,725
Why are you standing sir?
Sit down sir!!!

1469
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:53,624
What happened sir?!

1470
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,062
I fell into a
sewage slush!

1471
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:57,833
If you pour Soda like this
When will you clean him up?

1472
01:37:58,038 --> 01:37:58,561
No Water,Man!

1473
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:01,138
He cleansed Tamil Nadu in one day,
We have to clean him in one minute

1474
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,441
Hey! Our one day Chief Minister
has arrived!

1475
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:40,808

01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:31,761
Safely! Safely,

01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,866
You may throw him down!
Bring him down! Go Go

1480
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:35,000
All of you move out!

1481
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:39,002
Let all the evil eyes casted
on you be warded off

1482
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:40,833
You have done a
wonderful job!

1483
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,442
Now,I am no more
Sensational Shubha!

1484
01:39:49,683 --> 01:39:51,241
You are the
Sensational Pugal!

1485
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,513
Son! Arrest of Mr.Aranganar was
your master stroke

1486
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,201
Greetings Leader!
Greetings Sir!

1487
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,034
Hey! Keep quiet!

1488
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:17,704
Brother! Spread and hold
your shirt?

1489
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:18,707
What? Hold my shirt?

1490
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:20,106
Spread your shirt
and hold!

1491
01:40:21,248 --> 01:40:21,873
Why?

1492
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:22,707
To measure Paddy!

1493
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:27,250
With your one order,without any
broker in between -

1494
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:31,390
You have made the government to
buy all the stocks directly from us

1495
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,922
After deducting all the costs and
labour,for a hectare -

1496
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:37,220
We are getting a nett profit of
5 thousand rupees

1497
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:40,990
After harvest the first measure is
offered to the god

1498
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:43,694
But,now you are our god!

1499
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:49,340
Please don't flatter me!

1500
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:53,336
Our hearts are overwhelmingly
filled.Take this brother!

1501
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:56,082
Take it brother!!!
Take it brother!

1502
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:12,690
What will I do with this paddy?
Offer them to god!

1503
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:13,925
Brother!

1504
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:14,723
Hold it! Brother!

1505
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,263
Even then,for the respect you have
bestowed on me...

1506
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:23,101
Are you happy?!

1507
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,553
What will my Thenmoli
will give me? -

1508
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:34,482
With great expectation I had
come running -

1509
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,453
Why are you hiding your face
and leaving from here?

1510
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:41,986
Hey! What happened?
Why are you crying?

1511
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:47,797
They gave you paddy and raised
your position to god -

1512
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:50,264
What can I give you?

1513
01:41:52,339 --> 01:41:54,307
They say that,life is priceless!

1514
01:41:55,676 --> 01:41:56,973
But,I will not give
my life!

1515
01:41:58,445 --> 01:41:59,969
I want to live with you!

1516
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:02,638
Modesty is more than the life

1517
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:06,478
Take it!

1518
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:09,212
Thenmoli! Whats's all this?

1519
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:12,991
I don't have anything more precious
with me to give you

1520
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:25,902
The paddy they gave is not important
but the honour is

1521
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:28,834
The way you gave yourself to
me is not important -

1522
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:33,010
But,trust you have on me
is more important -

1523
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:36,278
That is enough for me!

1524
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:34,701
The corruptions of Aranganar's rule -

1525
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:37,706
When exposed by the one day
Chief Minister has lead -

1526
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:39,879
The alliance front's party leader
Mr.Thirupathi Samy -

1527
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,570
To withdraw his support
to the Government

1528
01:48:41,882 --> 01:48:44,544
Following this Mr.Aranganar's
Government has fallen

1529
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:46,710
Again,Elections have been
announced!

1530
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,912
Hey! Look a rat pulling
an elephant!

1531
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,385
Coming Polls,who do you think
will form the Govt.?

1532
01:48:53,827 --> 01:48:56,227
We voted to him because the previous
Govt.Iooted 300 crores

1533
01:48:56,596 --> 01:48:58,530
But this man looted
500 crores!

1534
01:48:58,932 --> 01:49:01,332
The rulings front's partner party as
if he is very honest -

1535
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:02,900
Has pulled the strings at
the right time

1536
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:03,965
A real oppurtunist!

1537
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:08,163
Again if we vote and bring them
back! They'll squeeze us!

1538
01:49:08,575 --> 01:49:09,906
We don't want any
of these!!

1539
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:11,405
If any new person comes
lt'll be very good!

1540
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:14,409
If you ask me,that one day
Chief Minister Pugalenthi!

1541
01:49:14,614 --> 01:49:15,308
He should come back

1542
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:18,150
Pugalenthi is the right person!

1543
01:49:18,618 --> 01:49:20,916
For Pizza its Italy! For
Noodles its China!

1544
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:23,316
For Chocolates its Swiss! For
Rule its PUGALENTHI

1545
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:24,455
Only Pugalenthi!

1546
01:49:24,658 --> 01:49:25,818
Only Pugalenthi!

1547
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:26,753
lt'll be Rama's rule!

1548
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,018
It's A,R.Rehman!

1549
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:28,989
It's M.G.R!!!

1550
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:37,127
We want Pugalenthi's rule!

1551
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:39,366

01:49:51,985 --> 01:49:53,009

1555
01:50:06,032 --> 01:50:06,657
I'll look after him!

1556
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:08,562
Greetings sir!

1557
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:10,568
Why sir?!

1558
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:12,431
Pugal,I least expected
this

1559
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:14,902
The whole state is agog with your
name! Come on get down quickly!

1560
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:17,042
Sir! I am not interested in
politics

1561
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,143
I'll always stand by you,
Don't be scared!

1562
01:50:19,346 --> 01:50:20,677
Look! This is a rare
opportunity!

1563
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:24,782
I am an ordinary man!
With ordinary wishes

1564
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:27,980
All I need is 8 hrs
of sleep!

1565
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:29,983
4 flower like rice cakes and
mint sauce

1566
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:32,990
A game of cards with my
loving parents!

1567
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,388
A contentful job!

1568
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:37,387
On Sunday watch Titanic,
Breakfast at Saravanas

1569
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:39,832
And a beautiful ogre in
Pooncholai Village!

1570
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,192
That's more than enough
for me sir!

1571
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:45,003
Sir,now my only aim is to
secure a Govt. job

1572
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:47,730
For that only,I am studying for
Public Service Commission

1573
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:50,407
Hey! Man,The Govt. itself wants
to be yours -

1574
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,507
And you are trying for
a Govt. job!

1575
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:55,112
Is it the same man speaking,Who
achieved so much in one day?

1576
01:50:55,882 --> 01:50:58,544
Sir,We'll always find fault with
cooking in the house!

1577
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,242
One day,they'll challenge
us to cook!

1578
01:51:00,553 --> 01:51:02,851
We'll accept it on a Sunday
and achieve it

1579
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:03,518
But,Can we cook daily?
We can't!

1580
01:51:03,723 --> 01:51:04,690
And it may turn
out good!

1581
01:51:05,058 --> 01:51:06,355
But,can we cook daily?we can't

1582
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,188
Because,cooking is not
our work!

1583
01:51:08,395 --> 01:51:11,064
Then with a pad and pencil do you
know only to ask questions?

1584
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:12,463
Sir! That's my duty!

1585
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:14,457
I am asking the questions,which
the people want to ask-

1586
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:15,532
As their representative

1587
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:16,360
Is it the end of it?

1588
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:18,537
Don't you want to come and stand
by the nation in good or bad times?

1589
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:20,735
I'll stand by the nation,
as a follower -

1590
01:51:20,974 --> 01:51:21,872
Not as a leader!

1591
01:51:22,242 --> 01:51:25,268
I'll fight as a citizen,but not
as a Chief Minister

1592
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:27,139
Hey! You,What do you think
of yourself?

1593
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:29,372
You'll do something good and spoil
the mood of the public -

1594
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,551
And then,make people to look forward
for your entry into politics -

1595
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:34,049
With one throat
if we call you -

1596
01:51:34,254 --> 01:51:35,653
You'll say,I'll go to see Titanic,
I'll have tiffin...

1597
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:38,380
Hey you! Who has barred you not to
have tiffin after you become C.M

1598
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:39,387
Oh! My god!

1599
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:48,660
Hey! Where are you backing and
running off? They have come

1600
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:51,701
On every T.V they said your name
now,no T.V will be left here

1601
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:52,530
Go and hide somewhere!

1602
01:51:58,445 --> 01:51:58,911
Hey! Look!!

1603
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:01,141
Hey! Are you the next C.M?

1604
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:02,506
Listen to me!

1605
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,182
What do you think
of yourself?

1606
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:05,414
Are you the next C.M?

1607
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:12,987
Are you the Sensational Prabha?
Come I'll Sensationalize you

1608
01:52:13,793 --> 01:52:14,589
Help me! Please!!

1609
01:52:17,464 --> 01:52:18,761
What? What?

1610
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:20,091
Give me a good pose
I'll shoot!

1611
01:52:20,366 --> 01:52:24,302
Come,Shoot it,Shoot it in 70 MM
Come shoot...

1612
01:52:24,504 --> 01:52:26,028
Mike is broken,take that light
into your hands

1613
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,538
You want me to take the light,
You,son of a Cockroach!

1614
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,790
Oh! My god! What a beating?

1615
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:57,402
Hey! You swine!

1616
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:33,868
Come,Let's go!
Let him die!

1617
01:53:43,783 --> 01:53:45,842
Kalyani! Is water coming
in your tap?

1618
01:53:46,052 --> 01:53:46,677
Yes its coming!

1619
01:53:46,886 --> 01:53:48,353
Then,Why isn't it coming in
our house?

1620
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:52,752
What's this? Even current
is also off?

1621
01:53:53,293 --> 01:53:54,920
What's this everyone's house is
having current?!

1622
01:53:56,963 --> 01:53:58,521
Damn it! Even the
telephone is dead!

1623
01:53:59,132 --> 01:54:00,497
I'll go and lodge
a complaint!

1624
01:54:00,733 --> 01:54:02,894
How many offices will you go
to lodge complaints?

1625
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:05,902
Sir,Who are you?

1626
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:08,304
We are coming from
Corporation Office! - What's it?

1627
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:10,138
You have transgressed the rules and
regulations of the Corporation -

1628
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:10,866
To construct this house!

1629
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:11,873
What are you saying?

1630
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:13,537
Look here!

1631
01:54:13,947 --> 01:54:16,040
You have encroached upon Govt.land
by 1 feet and 8 inches

1632
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:18,341
We have been ordered to demolish it
by the Commissioner

1633
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:22,051
It has been like this for 17 years!
What has happened now?

1634
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:23,220
Did you ever serve
us a notice?

1635
01:54:23,423 --> 01:54:24,651
We have served a notice
last month,itself

1636
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,223
What can I do if you
don't receive it?

1637
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:27,154
Sir...Sir...Sir...

1638
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,850
Look,don't disturb us!

1639
01:54:29,062 --> 01:54:30,654
Stay away and co-operate
with us

1640
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:31,387
Come on, you start
your work!

1641
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:32,462
Ask them to stop! Please...

1642
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:35,725
Oh! God they are demolishing
You can-

1643
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:36,827
Stop it,if you wish to

1644
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:47,743
I curse them to
be ruined!

1645
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,908
Oh! God,its gone!
It's gone!!

1646
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:17,269
You,sinners
my chicken!!

1647
01:55:36,062 --> 01:55:38,121
Safely,Safely get down
Safely!

1648
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:40,128
What's this? Why is he getting
down from an ambulance?

1649
01:55:41,834 --> 01:55:42,698
What happened to him?

1650
01:55:42,902 --> 01:55:44,699
Why is his head extensively
bandaged? What happened?

1651
01:55:44,904 --> 01:55:46,371
Nothing! There was a small
problem in Q T.V?

1652
01:55:46,572 --> 01:55:48,870
The wounds are small,only the
bandage is heavy

1653
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:52,802
Why? Why is this happening
only to our family?

1654
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:57,412
They have stopped water,
current,phone...

1655
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,415
Not only that,those murderous sinners
have demolished even our house

1656
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:02,781
For your one day's
Chief Minister ship -

1657
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:04,217
They are beating us with
our hands tied

1658
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,158
Mother,don't worry!

1659
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:09,350
Father! Take mother inside!

1660
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,496
I am not going to
leave it simply!

1661
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:21,604
They barged into Q T.V and beat me
at the behest of Aranganar

1662
01:56:22,608 --> 01:56:24,337
All are his hench men,I have seen
them with my eyes

1663
01:56:25,178 --> 01:56:27,612
Palvesham! You go and call
lawyer Sundarajan

1664
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:28,542
Hey! you stop!

1665
01:56:29,015 --> 01:56:30,710
What are you going to do? Are you
going to file a case

1666
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:31,675
Great Idea!

1667
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:33,843
That there are 14 lakh pending cases
in Delhi-

1668
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:35,020
Which you only said
in that interview

1669
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:37,189
lt'll take atleast 25 years for your
case to come to an end

1670
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:39,358
Before that your lawyer Sundarajan
will get beaten twice

1671
01:56:41,394 --> 01:56:46,195
From 1947 till now,how many cases
have been filed on politicians -

1672
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:48,697
Had any politician ever been
prosecuted and sentenced? -

1673
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:51,096
Before the case ends he'll rule and
enjoy the power and die -

1674
01:56:51,304 --> 01:56:52,828
Only bedbugs will generate
on that files!

1675
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:54,434
For that,do you want me
to leave him?

1676
01:56:56,309 --> 01:56:57,367
I am a media man!

1677
01:56:58,077 --> 01:57:02,275
I'll call all the T.V's and Magazines
and tear apart that Aranganar

1678
01:57:02,482 --> 01:57:04,006
They tore apart Q T.V,
haven't you seen it?

1679
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:07,482
Sir,What was the mistake
I committed?

1680
01:57:07,754 --> 01:57:09,483
Doing good itself is a crime
in our country!

1681
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:12,390
I had taken a interview
is it my mistake?

1682
01:57:13,126 --> 01:57:13,854
It was my job!

1683
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:18,160
It was an accident,that I was a
Chief Minister for a day

1684
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:21,058
Truthfully,What was to be done
by the people in that position -

1685
01:57:21,267 --> 01:57:21,926
I did just that
on that day!

1686
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:23,568
Everything was over!

1687
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:25,962
I have returned back to my
ordinary daily life -

1688
01:57:26,606 --> 01:57:27,903
I am just an ordinary man!

1689
01:57:28,574 --> 01:57:30,906
Sir,why are they still chasing
and hurting me?

1690
01:57:31,377 --> 01:57:32,810
Who said that you are
an ordinary man?

1691
01:57:33,112 --> 01:57:34,636
When you sat on that seat
for a day -

1692
01:57:35,214 --> 01:57:36,078
That day itself,you had
become a politician

1693
01:57:36,282 --> 01:57:38,580
Politics is like drugs! Once
you are hooked you are gone

1694
01:57:38,785 --> 01:57:40,582
Tomorrow,if he wins he'll use
police to beat you -

1695
01:57:40,787 --> 01:57:41,913
If he loses he'll use his
hench men to beat you

1696
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:43,088
You can never escape
from him

1697
01:57:45,191 --> 01:57:47,751
Then,Then sir where is the
end to it?

1698
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:50,258
One,settle down with your family
somewhere near Burma -

1699
01:57:50,463 --> 01:57:51,521
Otherwise join Politics!

1700
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:52,857
No,I don't want Politics!

1701
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,328
I don't want Politics!

1702
01:57:55,802 --> 01:57:57,167
This is the Victory of
Politicians!

1703
01:57:57,370 --> 01:58:00,066
Those,Who should question them
never do,but keep quiet -

1704
01:58:00,273 --> 01:58:01,740
That's why,these Politicians are
creating so much of chaos

1705
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:03,431
This is a curse on
this country!

1706
01:58:03,643 --> 01:58:05,770
The famed bad man of movies
P.S.Veerappa said it rightly -

1707
01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:08,606
''LET THIS COUNTRY AND ITS
PEOPLE BE RUINED''

1708
01:58:10,249 --> 01:58:11,341
Hey! Auto stop!

1709
01:58:32,038 --> 01:58:34,233
Oh! The leader has got up!
Come on get up! Get up!

1710
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,901
Hey!Don't photograph me?
New's may reach higher levels

1711
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:38,475
Sir,lts just a photograph!

1712
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:39,645
Mam! I may lose my job!

1713
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:41,473
Don't I have to be in this job,
atleast till this man comes

1714
01:58:43,683 --> 01:58:44,707
What are you doing here?

1715
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:46,646
I couldn't stay away!
So,I had to come back

1716
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:47,544
What have you decided?

1717
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:50,955
To get up and brush his teeth!

1718
01:58:51,157 --> 01:58:54,593
Move,leader has to go to toilet
move...move...

1719
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,921
Stay away from my waist
You swine

1720
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,324
Go,Go

1721
01:58:58,531 --> 01:59:03,434
Move...Move...Make way
...Go...Go

1722
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:04,500
Hey! Stop...Stop...

1723
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:07,765
Greetings brother!

1724
01:59:08,141 --> 01:59:11,167
I am the opposition leader
Vaduganathan! I think you know me!

1725
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:13,545
I know anyhow you'll come
to the bathroom

1726
01:59:13,746 --> 01:59:15,338
So,I was waiting for you
from morning!

1727
01:59:16,215 --> 01:59:18,945
Brother! Our party has
40 MLA'S

1728
01:59:19,385 --> 01:59:20,943
They'll sign wherever I tell
them to sign

1729
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:22,678
Today you join our party!

1730
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:24,584
Who will be the next Chief Minister
Will it be you or me ? -

1731
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:25,688
We can decide after discussion
in the general body meeting

1732
01:59:25,892 --> 01:59:26,358
Brother!...

1733
01:59:26,559 --> 01:59:30,188
I have cash in a van!
Totally 100'C'

1734
01:59:30,396 --> 01:59:31,294
100'C' means?!

1735
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:32,429
100'C' means 100 Crores!

1736
01:59:32,632 --> 01:59:34,190
Yuck! What sort of men
are you?

1737
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,368
Not allowing a person to go
to toilet and fixing rates!

1738
01:59:36,569 --> 01:59:38,833
You go...Stop...Why this
garland to go to toilet?

1739
01:59:39,071 --> 01:59:41,039
Is he going to foreign?
He is just going to toilet -

1740
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,036
Why do you bother him
so much?

1741
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:42,764
You go

1742
01:59:43,442 --> 01:59:44,409
Greetings! Pugalji!!

1743
01:59:44,744 --> 01:59:47,304
What Pugalji?! Why are you
changing his father's name

1744
01:59:47,813 --> 01:59:48,438
Give it to me!

1745
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:50,548
We are coming from a
National party

1746
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:53,651
Join our party,you will be
the next Chief Minister

1747
01:59:54,253 --> 01:59:57,780
From Delhi,500'C' has come
as your growth fund

1748
01:59:57,990 --> 02:00:00,424
You intimate our leader about
your acceptance on phone itself

1749
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:03,728
What? 500 Crores?! Pugal!
Give me that income tax number...

1750
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:04,655
Palveshji...

1751
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:05,556
Formality for me too!

1752
02:00:05,765 --> 02:00:07,562
If you talk to Pugal and get our
work done -

1753
02:00:07,767 --> 02:00:08,927
We'll pay you a 2C

1754
02:00:09,402 --> 02:00:10,130
You! Swine!!!

1755
02:00:12,772 --> 02:00:16,606
Long Live Leader Thirupathisamy!
Long Live Leader Thirupathisamy

1756
02:00:17,276 --> 02:00:19,836
I am Alliance Front Party
Leader,Thirupathisamy!

1757
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,809
You need not enter Politics

1758
02:00:22,014 --> 02:00:24,448
All you have to do is just issue a
statement in support of us -

1759
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:26,743
We'll accept you as our
spiritual leader!

1760
02:00:26,953 --> 02:00:30,582
The rule which you did for a day,
We'll continue to do it

1761
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:33,083
Brother!

1762
02:00:33,292 --> 02:00:34,418
Who's that? Who is calling our
leader as younger brother?

1763
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:35,252
Who is that?

1764
02:00:35,461 --> 02:00:35,927
Brother!

1765
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:38,089
Oh! Agricultural Party!

1766
02:00:39,465 --> 02:00:40,124
Come!

1767
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:44,030
Greetings! Come..

1768
02:00:46,305 --> 02:00:48,034
Brother! Saw on T.V that you
were beaten up -

1769
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:50,506
Seeing it,Thenmoli has
been distressed

1770
02:00:50,743 --> 02:00:53,644
I couldn't see her distressed so I
brought her here to meet you

1771
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:03,645
Are you fine? Nothing
has happened to you,isn't it?

1772
02:01:04,357 --> 02:01:05,289
I am okay,Thenmoli!

1773
02:01:05,491 --> 02:01:07,959
Come, with me,I have to talk to
you alone

1774
02:01:09,495 --> 02:01:12,623
They are discussing important family
matter. Please don't disturb..

1775
02:01:12,832 --> 02:01:15,960
I was distressed listening to your
name from everyone on T.V

1776
02:01:16,168 --> 02:01:19,604
I was afraid that all of them
may push you into Politics

1777
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:21,297
Don't enter into Politics

1778
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:24,977
Once if you enter,you can never
extricate yourself from it till death -

1779
02:01:25,177 --> 02:01:27,042
Or lead a peaceful life

1780
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:30,808
I am not saying this with any
self motives

1781
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:33,076
But as a parent I am
advicing you

1782
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:36,319
Before you decide

1783
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:41,685
Think once about Thenmoli,who always
thinks about you only

1784
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:48,494
Pugal! I like this
girl very much!

1785
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:50,325
Without anymore talk
marry her!

1786
02:01:50,536 --> 02:01:53,437
We'll settle very far away beyond
the reach of these Politicians

1787
02:01:57,376 --> 02:01:58,502
Ay,Palvesham move

1788
02:01:58,711 --> 02:01:59,837
I can't,now everything is under
my control

1789
02:02:00,212 --> 02:02:01,008
You Swine

1790
02:02:03,049 --> 02:02:04,016
You have become an
eminent person

1791
02:02:04,884 --> 02:02:07,352
Do you know,how many people
are waiting for you -

1792
02:02:07,553 --> 02:02:08,679
Just for your
one ''YES''

1793
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,856
By dumping crores of rupees
in a van

1794
02:02:11,223 --> 02:02:12,349
They have come to bargain your
rate

1795
02:02:12,558 --> 02:02:14,025
The Opposition party on
one side -

1796
02:02:15,895 --> 02:02:17,021
The Nationalist Party on
the other -

1797
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:18,860
And since you badly
got hurt -

1798
02:02:19,065 --> 02:02:20,032
By not being able to
bear it -

1799
02:02:20,232 --> 02:02:23,360
The common people are ready to bet
their lives,gathered on one side

1800
02:02:23,736 --> 02:02:25,203
And on every channel
of the T.V -

1801
02:02:25,404 --> 02:02:28,703
By chanting your name Pugalenthi,
the Public is on another side

1802
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:32,373
And above all,this is the latest turn on
the platform of Indian politics -

1803
02:02:32,912 --> 02:02:37,042
Why alone India,the CNN,BBC etc
The whole world is waiting for your reply

1804
02:02:37,249 --> 02:02:38,216
What have you
decided?

1805
02:02:46,258 --> 02:02:47,384
I beg all
of you -

1806
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,057
Right now,I am not interested in
speaking anything

1807
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,897
Look,I am just an
ordinary man

1808
02:02:52,098 --> 02:02:55,556
I am already fed up after getting
beaten up

1809
02:02:56,435 --> 02:02:58,232
Just leave me
alone

1810
02:02:58,437 --> 02:02:58,903
Ay,move

1811
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:00,738
Come

1812
02:03:03,776 --> 02:03:05,573
Come here and look at
the crowd

1813
02:03:22,294 --> 02:03:24,421
Pugal,ls this the crowd gathered
by giving them money -

1814
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:27,933
Is it because of giving them the
liquor or fish chips

1815
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,426
This is the crowd gathered
on its own

1816
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:31,436
Look at the curiosity on
everybody's face -

1817
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:33,133
Will a good leader
not come!

1818
02:03:33,305 --> 02:03:34,602
Will a good government
not formed!

1819
02:03:34,974 --> 02:03:35,941
Will a good future
not arise!-

1820
02:03:36,142 --> 02:03:36,938
Look at their
desperation

1821
02:03:38,477 --> 02:03:39,774
Today,Whomever
if asked -

1822
02:03:40,146 --> 02:03:42,273
Wants to become a Doctor,Engineer
or a Lawyer

1823
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:45,109
Is anyone ready to become
a Politician?

1824
02:03:46,152 --> 02:03:47,619
If asked,they say Politics
is a sewage -

1825
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,617
If its a sewage,they should
have cleaned it,isn't it?

1826
02:03:49,989 --> 02:03:51,957
Leaving that,by handing over the
country into the hands of dirty politicians -

1827
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:53,785
They have got used
to the dirt

1828
02:03:54,827 --> 02:03:56,294
What do youngsters like
you think?

1829
02:03:56,495 --> 02:04:00,124
A good work and a beautiful
girl to marry

1830
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:03,297
And till 45 years,by saving the
money in instalments -

1831
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:05,129
And buy a small land away
from the city -

1832
02:04:05,337 --> 02:04:07,805
Build a house in 800sq.ft and
paint it in yellow colour -

1833
02:04:08,174 --> 02:04:10,802
And then reading papers like
Indian Express or Hindu -

1834
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:12,978
And then die only by thinking
about my family,my life & my children

1835
02:04:13,179 --> 02:04:13,645
Get lost

1836
02:04:14,013 --> 02:04:16,982
If Mr.Mahatma Gandhi also would have
thought in the same way -

1837
02:04:17,183 --> 02:04:18,480
Would the country had ever got its
independence -

1838
02:04:20,019 --> 02:04:22,317
If Thomas Alva Edison would have thought,
like this would the country had ever got current

1839
02:04:23,189 --> 02:04:24,816
If Graham Bell would have thought
like this

1840
02:04:25,024 --> 02:04:26,992
Then nobody would have ever spoken
on a telephone or a cellular

1841
02:04:28,527 --> 02:04:33,988
Even a small insect like silk worm,
gives something and then dies

1842
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:35,458
We are after all
human beings

1843
02:04:37,369 --> 02:04:37,994
Who is he?

1844
02:04:38,537 --> 02:04:39,504
What is the relation between
him and you?

1845
02:04:39,872 --> 02:04:42,170
Why should he wait for you from
5'0'clock in the morning?

1846
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:44,009
Son,Why have you
come?

1847
02:05:00,226 --> 02:05:02,023
Our country is also
crippled like me -

1848
02:05:02,561 --> 02:05:03,960
Leader,Make it stand up and
walk tall

1849
02:06:54,506 --> 02:06:54,972
Greetings!

1850
02:06:55,174 --> 02:06:58,302
In the polls,people's party
leader Pugalenthi!

1851
02:06:58,677 --> 02:07:01,145
Has won with history creating
vote difference

1852
02:07:01,347 --> 02:07:03,975
Candidates belonging to his party
have won all their constituencies

1853
02:07:04,183 --> 02:07:07,641
With an absolute majority,
creating new records

1854
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:17,492
All the candidates of all the parties,
who opposed him in the elections...

1855
02:07:18,864 --> 02:07:24,496
First time in the History of world
Politics 97./. voting has been recorded

1856
02:07:25,704 --> 02:07:30,505
For the first time a 28 year old has
become a C.M of a state

1857
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,177
Candidates of all the parties who
contested against him -

1858
02:07:33,379 --> 02:07:34,346
Have lost their deposit

1859
02:07:35,047 --> 02:07:36,674
In the History of
world politics...

1860
02:08:44,116 --> 02:08:44,912
Greetings to everyone!

1861
02:08:47,619 --> 02:08:49,246
What,I expect from you
people is that -

1862
02:08:49,955 --> 02:08:53,254
What I did in one day,we should all
do it permanently

1863
02:08:53,959 --> 02:08:55,085
And to do that excellently -

1864
02:08:55,294 --> 02:08:57,592
I have appointed 2 Ministers
for each department

1865
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:01,428
An intelligent Veteran!!
A Zealous young man!!

1866
02:09:07,973 --> 02:09:11,431
We have Laws for everything,but they
are all ineffective

1867
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:13,607
lt'll leak,till there
are holes

1868
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:14,779
Till the mistakes are
being committed -

1869
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:17,278
However good administration we
give its a total waste

1870
02:09:17,816 --> 02:09:21,274
First,We should know any mistake
committed in any corner of this State -

1871
02:09:22,154 --> 02:09:23,280
We have to rectify that
mistake immediately -

1872
02:09:23,822 --> 02:09:25,619
We have to punish the
wrong doer -

1873
02:09:25,824 --> 02:09:28,292
For that,I am going to introduce
a new scheme

1874
02:09:28,994 --> 02:09:29,619
Complaint Box!!

1875
02:09:30,162 --> 02:09:33,461
But,We have a complaint register
in all the departments

1876
02:09:33,832 --> 02:09:35,299
Then,Why are the mistakes
being committed?

1877
02:09:36,168 --> 02:09:37,965
Because,its beyond reach!

1878
02:09:38,337 --> 02:09:40,464
Not only that complaints
registered there -

1879
02:09:40,672 --> 02:09:42,469
Go to the same concerned
authorities -

1880
02:09:42,841 --> 02:09:45,309
Who never take action on it and
close the file

1881
02:09:45,677 --> 02:09:47,804
It has become an ineffective
customary symbol -

1882
02:09:48,013 --> 02:09:51,312
But,this Complaint box will be
there in every street of Tamilnadu

1883
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,647
If water doesn't come in taps,
or if electricity fails -

1884
02:09:53,852 --> 02:09:56,821
If roads are in bad shape
Adulteration,bribes...

1885
02:09:57,189 --> 02:10:00,317
I.A.S,I.P.S or Ministers not only them
even if I commit a mistake -

1886
02:10:00,526 --> 02:10:02,323
People can write a complaint
without being scared -

1887
02:10:02,861 --> 02:10:04,988
Action will be taken
within 24 hours -

1888
02:10:05,197 --> 02:10:08,826
Maximum 1 week to rectify any
difficult problem

1889
02:10:09,034 --> 02:10:11,002
For this,I am going to start
a new department -

1890
02:10:11,203 --> 02:10:12,670
That'll be ''COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT''

1891
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:14,839
lt'll be under my
direct supervision

1892
02:10:15,207 --> 02:10:17,334
The day,when these complaints
slowly thin -

1893
02:10:17,709 --> 02:10:19,176
And this complaint box becomes
empty

1894
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:21,005
Only then,We can say that a
administration is ruling

1895
02:10:21,547 --> 02:10:23,515
And to achieve this we are going
to dedicate ourselves

1896
02:10:57,416 --> 02:11:04,720
A green horn,in one election has
screwed up all our political lives

1897
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:11,559
Till,he runs the govt. we have to
keep off from Politics -

1898
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:14,899
We'll have to go back to our villages
to start afresh

1899
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:16,393
That,isn't very easy -

1900
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:20,568
On his instructions enforcement
Directorate is on our black money

1901
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:23,567
He might have been a bandicoot
in his previous birth

1902
02:11:23,942 --> 02:11:25,239
He's dug up all the
old files and -

1903
02:11:25,444 --> 02:11:27,071
Has registered 800 odd cases!

1904
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:29,747
He'll not rest till he puts all of
us behind bars at the earliest

1905
02:11:32,117 --> 02:11:33,584
We'll have to precede him..

1906
02:11:33,952 --> 02:11:35,749
There is no other way than to
assasinate him

1907
02:11:38,457 --> 02:11:38,923
Sir,what?

1908
02:11:39,124 --> 02:11:40,751
Didn't you say there is a
party in Bombay?

1909
02:11:40,959 --> 02:11:42,256
Not one sir,there are many -

1910
02:11:42,461 --> 02:11:45,919
Like acid thrower,strangler,Ak 47
poisoning specialist -

1911
02:11:46,131 --> 02:11:47,428
Injecting needles,Bomb specialist...

1912
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:48,600
Get the Bomb making specialist!

1913
02:11:49,468 --> 02:11:51,436
That's the best suited for
our terrain -

1914
02:11:51,637 --> 02:11:53,264
And also its very easy to throw
the blame on others

1915
02:12:12,157 --> 02:12:13,784
Pugalenthi has sent me to give
you this present

1916
02:12:16,662 --> 02:12:19,631
Oops! Cell phone to a country
village girl!

1917
02:12:19,831 --> 02:12:22,299
C.M is on the line,press ok button
and speak

1918
02:12:25,003 --> 02:12:26,470
I'll go,you carry on

1919
02:12:27,673 --> 02:12:28,469
Thenmoli,How are you?

1920
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:30,141
Do you still remember me?

1921
02:12:30,842 --> 02:12:31,809
Don't kill me! Thenmoli!

1922
02:12:33,011 --> 02:12:36,310
On assuming the duty,I had received
many bouquets from P.M,President...

1923
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:38,475
But the one sent by you,
a country bouquet -

1924
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:41,148
You don't know,how much happiness
it had given me?

1925
02:12:42,187 --> 02:12:44,485
How much I was fretting and
fuming to meet you?

1926
02:12:44,856 --> 02:12:45,982
Nobody is there to stop me!

1927
02:12:46,358 --> 02:12:47,985
But,I couldn't get rid of myself
from my responsibility

1928
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,987
I had telephoned many times to
chettiyar's house -

1929
02:12:50,362 --> 02:12:53,661
Your father hanged the phone saying
you were out of station

1930
02:12:54,032 --> 02:12:55,329
That's why,I have sent you
this cell phone

1931
02:12:55,867 --> 02:12:59,496
You can talk to me,Whenever you
wish to,from this cell phone

1932
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:01,998
Will you never ever come and see
me again?

1933
02:13:02,207 --> 02:13:03,174
I'll come on Sunday!

1934
02:13:03,875 --> 02:13:05,502
I'll be waiting for
this Sunday!

1935
02:13:06,044 --> 02:13:10,174
There are 6 nights and 5 days,I fear
something might happen

1936
02:13:11,717 --> 02:13:15,847
My father is seriously searching a
Govt. employed groom in the vicinity

1937
02:13:16,388 --> 02:13:19,687
Like a Post man,Line man
Health Worker,Mill Inspector -

1938
02:13:20,225 --> 02:13:21,351
I am at constant
fear!

1939
02:13:21,727 --> 02:13:22,523
Don't worry!

1940
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:24,195
Software Technologist are
waiting for you

1941
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:25,291
Okay! I'll speak to you later!

1942
02:13:39,077 --> 02:13:40,203
I have to speak to him

1943
02:13:40,412 --> 02:13:41,379
To him,means who is it?

1944
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:44,549
There are 36 ''Him's'' here. Why even
I am also a ''Him'' only

1945
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:45,375
Which,''Him'' do you want
to speak to?

1946
02:13:45,584 --> 02:13:47,211
I am Thenmoli speaking!

1947
02:13:47,419 --> 02:13:49,216
Thenmoli,Why didn't you say it earlier
that it was you?

1948
02:13:51,923 --> 02:13:52,719
I have arranged all that

1949
02:13:53,925 --> 02:13:54,391
Who is it?

1950
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:55,226
Ogre!

1951
02:13:55,927 --> 02:13:56,894
Tell her that I'll
speak later

1952
02:13:59,598 --> 02:14:01,395
He's busy,he said he'll speak
to you later

1953
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:13,278
I am Thenmoli speaking!

1954
02:14:13,278 --> 02:14:15,576
Thenmoli,I am Palavesham speaking!
Are you fine?

1955
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:18,249
Damn with your enquiries!
Call him first!

1956
02:14:18,617 --> 02:14:19,914
He is in a very important
meeting

1957
02:14:20,285 --> 02:14:21,912
After the meeting,I'll inform him
that you had called him

1958
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:25,920
Go to hell! You never inform him!
He has never called me back

1959
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:27,751
I am in distress for him!

1960
02:14:28,126 --> 02:14:29,423
A C.M's job is like that

1961
02:14:29,795 --> 02:14:32,263
His time no more belongs to
him.Try to understand

1962
02:20:45,837 --> 02:20:46,462
What's that sound?

1963
02:20:47,338 --> 02:20:47,804
Father nothing!

1964
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,136
Take it out!

1965
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:56,138
Who gave it?

1966
02:20:57,682 --> 02:20:58,148
He gave it

1967
02:20:58,349 --> 02:20:58,644
Who?

1968
02:20:59,684 --> 02:21:00,651
He...

1969
02:21:00,852 --> 02:21:03,821
He has left you for politics,why
are you still cribbing for him

1970
02:21:46,564 --> 02:21:47,030
Who's that?

1971
02:21:50,068 --> 02:21:51,365
Oh! That bugger
from Madras!

1972
02:21:51,903 --> 02:21:53,530
Oh! Chinnasamy come come

1973
02:22:18,263 --> 02:22:24,224
Accusing the former C.M Arangnar
to be behind those caste conflicts -

1974
02:22:24,435 --> 02:22:26,403
You had dethrowned him
from the post

1975
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:29,236
What are you planning to
do away with this castes?

1976
02:22:30,608 --> 02:22:32,576
In Tamilnadu,there are
totally 350 castes!

1977
02:22:33,111 --> 02:22:35,079
But,in my administration,there
won't be so many..

1978
02:22:35,613 --> 02:22:37,581
I am going to make these 350
into four

1979
02:22:40,118 --> 02:22:40,743
I didn't get it!

1980
02:22:41,452 --> 02:22:44,751
In future there won't be any column
for caste in the application forms

1981
02:22:44,956 --> 02:22:46,253
There will be just 4 parts!

1982
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:52,019
All you have to do is to mention
which part you belong

1983
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,256
By this the reservation and job
opportunities of the oppressed class -

1984
02:22:55,466 --> 02:22:56,091
Are being snatched away
from them

1985
02:22:56,467 --> 02:22:59,925
All the castes of Tamilnadu will
come under any part,isn't it?

1986
02:23:00,138 --> 02:23:00,433
Yes!

1987
02:23:00,638 --> 02:23:01,263
What more do you
want?

1988
02:23:01,472 --> 02:23:04,930
There won't be any changes in
their customary benefits

1989
02:23:05,143 --> 02:23:07,270
By this you may lose support of
many caste associations

1990
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:08,445
I am not bothered
about it!

1991
02:23:08,813 --> 02:23:11,281
Everyone is afraid of losing the
support of caste associations -

1992
02:23:11,482 --> 02:23:14,280
Today,Any good work couldn't be
taken up with courage

1993
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:18,118
Now,there caste associations have
sprung up like petty shops-

1994
02:23:18,323 --> 02:23:19,290
Every street are scaring the
people at large

1995
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:20,787
I am not a person to be afraid
of all these

1996
02:23:20,992 --> 02:23:23,460
Whatever is good for this nation
I will do it!

1997
02:23:23,828 --> 02:23:26,626
What is the aim of this
drastic action?

1998
02:23:27,165 --> 02:23:30,965
After 25 yrs,the future generation will not
themselves know which caste they belong to!

1999
02:23:31,336 --> 02:23:34,635
The generation coming after me will
make the 4 into 2 and 2 into 1

2000
02:23:35,173 --> 02:23:36,640
Atlast there'll only be one
caste left

2001
02:23:37,008 --> 02:23:37,804
That'll be ''HUMAN''

2002
02:24:19,484 --> 02:24:21,782
Mr.Manohar,I am going to the village
on a personal work

2003
02:24:21,986 --> 02:24:22,782
Why so many cars?

2004
02:24:23,121 --> 02:24:24,383
You could have arranged
a P.T car?

2005
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:28,757
Sir,Whenever you go all these cars
have to follow you

2006
02:24:30,028 --> 02:24:32,792
It's wrong to spend so much on
the security only for me

2007
02:24:33,297 --> 02:24:36,027
The mistakes and the unnecessary
expenses committed by former C.M -

2008
02:24:36,234 --> 02:24:39,670
I am very strong in not
committing same mistakes

2009
02:24:41,506 --> 02:24:42,871
In W.Bengal,the C.M has
travelled by bus!

2010
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:43,800
You know,isn't it?!

2011
02:24:44,342 --> 02:24:46,037
Sir,Don't misunderstand me!

2012
02:24:46,244 --> 02:24:48,712
You have life threat
others don't have!

2013
02:24:48,913 --> 02:24:51,108
So,we have to provide you
with ''Z'' Category security!

2014
02:24:51,315 --> 02:24:52,213
That is our duty!

2015
02:24:52,784 --> 02:24:54,046
You belong to
the State -

2016
02:24:54,318 --> 02:24:56,809
Your life is more important to us
than your privacy

2017
02:24:57,021 --> 02:24:58,488
Today,you are travelling by
the third car!

2018
02:25:01,192 --> 02:25:02,181
Okay! I am not going
anywhere!

2019
02:25:21,112 --> 02:25:22,010
How's that Thenmoli?!

2020
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:33,754
Nobody is observing

2021
02:25:40,965 --> 02:25:44,594
Hey! Standardly one ft blue metal and
1/2 ft of minute blue metal -

2022
02:25:44,802 --> 02:25:47,794
2 inches of Tar and should be
road rolled 5 times -

2023
02:25:48,005 --> 02:25:50,405
The road laid by you should
withstand for 5 years -

2024
02:25:50,608 --> 02:25:55,341
If they open up in one rain
we'll open up your heads

2025
02:25:55,546 --> 02:25:58,447
This is our brother Pugal's
administration! Keep it in mind!

2026
02:25:58,649 --> 02:25:59,240
Yes Mr.Public!!!

2027
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:04,413
Did you look at our position?
Everyone is coming and threatening us!

2028
02:26:15,233 --> 02:26:16,200
Excuse me lady!

2029
02:26:17,735 --> 02:26:21,364
Give me five feet of ''Caste'' Jasmine
flower garland!

2030
02:26:21,672 --> 02:26:24,641
After our brother Pugal's rule
castes have vanished!

2031
02:26:24,842 --> 02:26:26,571
Ask for just Jasmine,I'll give!

2032
02:26:28,012 --> 02:26:28,979
Okay,give me!

2033
02:26:31,783 --> 02:26:34,843
Oh! God! I forget to
bring money!

2034
02:26:35,052 --> 02:26:36,952
Can I give it,on my next visit
is it okay for you?

2035
02:26:37,188 --> 02:26:41,318
Even knownfaces are deceiving,
I don't know your face

2036
02:26:47,698 --> 02:26:48,790
I am a known face!!

2037
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,058
Oh! My god! It's
Chief Minister!!!

2038
02:26:56,474 --> 02:26:59,341
Don't shout! I have come on a
personal work

2039
02:26:59,544 --> 02:27:00,602
Please,don't reveal it
to anyone!

2040
02:27:01,679 --> 02:27:03,704
Sir,he has come to
Pooncholai village! -

2041
02:27:03,915 --> 02:27:07,942
In a disguise with blue turban
and yellow shirt and silk dhothi

2042
02:27:08,452 --> 02:27:11,353
You keep watching him,I will
come immediately

2043
02:27:11,722 --> 02:27:12,347
Take this!

2044
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:15,019
Damn it! There's no photographer
in the vicinity!

2045
02:27:15,226 --> 02:27:18,195
Brother,autograph this!

2046
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:41,513
If you have promised to come on
Sunday then you must come

2047
02:27:41,719 --> 02:27:43,983
You keep up all the promises
given to the people -

2048
02:27:44,188 --> 02:27:46,122
But,when it comes to wife
you'll deceive!

2049
02:27:46,424 --> 02:27:47,550
What sort of a man are you?!

2050
02:27:48,893 --> 02:27:50,121
Anybody at home?!

2051
02:27:50,428 --> 02:27:51,053
Nobody!

2052
02:27:51,429 --> 02:27:53,226
Then,Who's talking?Ghost?!

2053
02:27:56,534 --> 02:28:00,129
Stop there,Who are you,
barging in?!

2054
02:28:00,438 --> 02:28:01,063
What do you want?

2055
02:28:01,505 --> 02:28:03,735
Not barging in Madam,I have
come for some sweet nothings!

2056
02:28:03,941 --> 02:28:05,238
Why are you talking with
some motives?

2057
02:28:05,443 --> 02:28:07,809
I have come here to do
with some ''intentions''

2058
02:28:08,112 --> 02:28:09,079
What will you do?

2059
02:28:09,513 --> 02:28:12,073
A peel off your lips,a bite below
the neck -

2060
02:28:12,283 --> 02:28:14,911
To seize your waist with mouth,
and a small rape!!

2061
02:28:15,119 --> 02:28:16,347
Okay! Go ahead!!

2062
02:28:17,755 --> 02:28:19,586
Oh! You sinner!
You deceiver!!

2063
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:24,022
Hey! Thopla! Can't I recognize you
if you wear a turban?

2064
02:28:24,228 --> 02:28:25,991
Take it off man!!

2065
02:28:34,572 --> 02:28:35,834
What's all this disguise?!

2066
02:28:36,073 --> 02:28:38,541
Thenmoli! Now I am not a
Chief Minister

2067
02:28:39,143 --> 02:28:44,638
No files,No Police around,No siren
I am just an ordinary man

2068
02:28:44,849 --> 02:28:47,943
I am your lover! This day
belongs only to you

2069
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:51,677
Order me to do anything?
I'll bear for you

2070
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:53,955
Thenmoli! Now I am
feeling very hungry!

2071
02:28:56,093 --> 02:29:00,621
Hey! You sinner when didn't turn up.
I have refused the chicken also!

2072
02:29:00,998 --> 02:29:01,930
Only left over rice
is there!

2073
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:02,832
That's enough!

2074
02:29:04,268 --> 02:29:05,667
There are no side dishes!

2075
02:29:06,637 --> 02:29:10,300
When you are here,why do I need
side dishes for rice?

2076
02:34:51,015 --> 02:34:52,642
Thenmoli! I am very happy today!

2077
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:55,648
How nice it will be if we have
2 Sundays in a week!

2078
02:34:56,587 --> 02:34:58,077
You are the C.M isn't it? - Yes

2079
02:34:58,789 --> 02:35:00,222
You can grant yourself any
number of holidays for you

2080
02:35:00,424 --> 02:35:02,187
You don't have any authority
over and above you

2081
02:35:02,526 --> 02:35:05,984
That isn't it! The people are
my Superior Authority!

2082
02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:07,360
I am just a worker for them!

2083
02:35:11,702 --> 02:35:15,160
You have managed even your adamant
father for our marriage

2084
02:35:15,272 --> 02:35:18,537
What next? Marriage at the next
auspicious time!

2085
02:35:46,737 --> 02:35:55,611
Even without your permission! It's my
duty to save your life!

2086
02:37:24,802 --> 02:37:25,393
Clear that stretcher!

2087
02:37:33,010 --> 02:37:33,704
Clear it!

2088
02:37:42,686 --> 02:37:44,449
I never expected this!

2089
02:37:45,189 --> 02:37:47,817
You may have selected this life
of playing with death

2090
02:37:48,358 --> 02:37:49,655
But I and my daughter don't
need such a life!

2091
02:37:50,594 --> 02:37:51,458
Father! he...

2092
02:37:52,362 --> 02:37:54,330
Even after all this,if you still
wish to marry him only

2093
02:37:55,332 --> 02:37:57,391
Let him throw all this away and come
as an ordinary man -

2094
02:37:58,101 --> 02:38:01,070
I can tolerate you as a sphinster
all your life -

2095
02:38:01,538 --> 02:38:03,665
But I don't have a heart to
see as a widow!

2096
02:38:34,605 --> 02:38:36,971
What's this father? Reversal of roles!?
I should press your legs!

2097
02:38:37,074 --> 02:38:39,770
You have come back from death! Let me
atleast touch you and feel

2098
02:38:40,077 --> 02:38:41,203
For that,Why do you want to
touch the legs?

2099
02:38:41,612 --> 02:38:43,102
Didn't I do this when you
were very young -

2100
02:38:43,313 --> 02:38:47,374
Now,You have a lot of tensions!
Let me massage your legs! -

2101
02:38:47,584 --> 02:38:48,551
So that you can have a
peaceful sleep!

2102
02:38:53,423 --> 02:38:54,082
Go to sleep!

2103
02:39:03,901 --> 02:39:06,369
Henna! Shall I apply henna
on your palms?!

2104
02:39:11,041 --> 02:39:12,804
Mother,lt's been long since I
slept on your lap!

2105
02:39:17,447 --> 02:39:19,005
How nice it'll be,if all my life
passes off like this!

2106
02:39:21,818 --> 02:39:26,255
How nice it'll be if we have a rewind
button in life like a VCR

2107
02:39:34,865 --> 02:39:35,354
Mother,Why are you crying?

2108
02:39:35,566 --> 02:39:38,296
It's been long since we had
a talk

2109
02:39:39,469 --> 02:39:41,437
I feel you have gone far away
from us

2110
02:39:45,309 --> 02:39:45,968
Mother,you talk...

2111
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:55,983
What will I talk about?
Except your marriage!

2112
02:39:56,653 --> 02:39:57,745
What did,Thenmoli's
father say?

2113
02:40:02,459 --> 02:40:03,517
Father,cut that phone call!

2114
02:40:04,428 --> 02:40:06,726
You and father come,we can talk it over
and finalize it

2115
02:40:06,964 --> 02:40:08,329
Mayakrishna is on the line!

2116
02:40:08,765 --> 02:40:09,959
May be something very
important matter

2117
02:40:15,339 --> 02:40:16,533
I am Mayakrishnan speaking!...

2118
02:40:18,008 --> 02:40:19,270
Hello! Not able to get the
signals inside the house! -

2119
02:40:19,476 --> 02:40:20,067
I'll move outside and
talk to you

2120
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:24,647
Sir! I am able to listen
properly now!

2121
02:40:24,848 --> 02:40:26,645
Pugal! Just now we have received
an intelligence report -

2122
02:40:26,850 --> 02:40:27,646
That a bomb has been placed
in your house -

2123
02:40:27,851 --> 02:40:28,647
Ask everyone in the house to
move out immediately

2124
02:40:41,031 --> 02:40:41,656
Mother!

2125
02:40:42,866 --> 02:40:43,332
Father!

2126
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:44,996
Mother!

2127
02:40:47,204 --> 02:40:49,832
What's this? What's all this?!!

2128
02:41:03,053 --> 02:41:05,021
Mother! Mother!

2129
02:41:06,390 --> 02:41:12,022
Mother,the henna which you have kept
on my hand has not yet dried

2130
02:41:12,529 --> 02:41:15,555
Before that...Mother! Mother!!

2131
02:41:22,739 --> 02:41:28,200
Father! Father! Please come back

2132
02:41:28,745 --> 02:41:32,545
If we also had a rewind button
like a VCR in our life

2133
02:41:32,749 --> 02:41:33,875
How nice it would
had been

2134
02:41:38,422 --> 02:41:39,389
You are a happy man!

2135
02:42:05,615 --> 02:42:06,741
What's this?

2136
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:09,578
Don't do it,brother!

2137
02:42:09,853 --> 02:42:22,960
Leave him Brother,leave him,leave him
please I beg of you,please leave him...

2138
02:42:24,301 --> 02:42:30,934
Brother,leave him,Don't harm
him leave him

2139
02:42:31,141 --> 02:42:33,769
On being appointed as Chief Minister
I,N.Pugalenthi -

2140
02:42:34,144 --> 02:42:36,612
To safeguard this nation and
its people -

2141
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:41,280
I promise to be beyond
the personal prejudices!

2142
02:42:47,657 --> 02:42:53,459
You,You,What did my
parents do to you?

2143
02:42:53,997 --> 02:42:55,624
You have torn them
into pieces!

2144
02:42:57,167 --> 02:42:59,135
I want my father's hands
which took me to school

2145
02:43:00,003 --> 02:43:01,971
Where is my mother's breast
which fed milk to me?

2146
02:43:02,839 --> 02:43:04,966
Where is it? You
Where?

2147
02:43:06,510 --> 02:43:07,135
Mother!?

2148
02:43:08,178 --> 02:43:11,306
Everybody bury's the dead! or
cremates!

2149
02:43:12,182 --> 02:43:16,312
But,I have come here after
washing away my parents

2150
02:43:17,187 --> 02:43:20,486
And the reason for that is...
your husband

2151
02:43:21,024 --> 02:43:23,492
Is it that early to hold
a CM's post?

2152
02:43:24,194 --> 02:43:25,991
Didn't you do something very
drastically?

2153
02:43:26,696 --> 02:43:27,993
There are people who may
not like it

2154
02:43:28,198 --> 02:43:29,995
Like caste associations,Extremists
Foreign hands-

2155
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:32,168
There will be 1008 enemies
like this

2156
02:43:32,536 --> 02:43:34,333
Tomorrow if anything happens
you may accuse me..

2157
02:43:34,538 --> 02:43:37,166
Hey! Don't act smart!

2158
02:43:37,707 --> 02:43:40,505
I know perfectly that its you!
Stop all this!

2159
02:43:42,212 --> 02:43:43,839
The law will come to
get you!

2160
02:43:55,559 --> 02:44:00,360
Maragatham! He's spoiled my hairs!
Give me a comb!

2161
02:44:05,735 --> 02:44:10,195
Chinnasamy! Before he arrests me
his govt. should fall!

2162
02:44:11,241 --> 02:44:14,210
Wherever they see there must be Strikes
Riots,Communal Clashes -

2163
02:44:15,245 --> 02:44:17,372
Here and there bombs should go off
and people should die

2164
02:44:18,081 --> 02:44:19,548
Law and order should
be disturbed

2165
02:44:40,937 --> 02:44:41,733
You sinners!!

2166
02:44:51,781 --> 02:44:53,578
To the respected Chief Minister!

2167
02:44:53,783 --> 02:44:54,909
For the past few
days

2168
02:44:55,118 --> 02:44:59,748
Some suspicious people had threatened
us and stayed in our house

2169
02:45:00,123 --> 02:45:01,590
I have gathered from
their talks -

2170
02:45:01,958 --> 02:45:06,088
That they may be involved in big
crimes like bomb blasts

2171
02:45:07,297 --> 02:45:10,095
Before they commit any
dangerous crimes -

2172
02:45:10,634 --> 02:45:13,933
I request you humbly to
take necessary action

2173
02:45:15,071 --> 02:45:15,765
From a person

2174
02:45:15,972 --> 02:45:19,533
Always your good rule and uninterested
to reveal the name -

2175
02:45:19,743 --> 02:45:20,266
A citizen!

2176
02:45:24,981 --> 02:45:26,778
Hey! You,Where did this
letter come from?

2177
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,276
We don't have time
for that!

2178
02:45:28,485 --> 02:45:29,611
First arrest that Chinnasamy!

2179
02:45:42,666 --> 02:45:43,291
What,Mr.Mayakrishnan?

2180
02:45:43,833 --> 02:45:45,300
I have told you to arrest Chinnasamy
and interrogate him

2181
02:45:45,502 --> 02:45:46,127
Why did you call me here?

2182
02:45:46,336 --> 02:45:47,633
As soon as he sensed that we'll
be arresting him

2183
02:45:47,837 --> 02:45:49,805
The fatso intelligently complained
of Diabetes and B.P -

2184
02:45:50,006 --> 02:45:50,631
Admitted himself into
this hospital

2185
02:45:51,007 --> 02:45:52,634
They have made a style of getting
admitted into a hospital

2186
02:45:53,343 --> 02:45:55,470
Look at him,sleeping like a
corpse in a well

2187
02:45:57,514 --> 02:45:59,141
We have to enquire an
important matter

2188
02:45:59,516 --> 02:46:00,483
Please,Can you co-operate
with us

2189
02:46:03,853 --> 02:46:06,151
He's acting as if he has just passed
out of Poona Institute

2190
02:46:08,191 --> 02:46:11,490
He has got high B.P,High Sugar,
and also Chest pain

2191
02:46:11,695 --> 02:46:13,162
That's why,its not possible for
him to speak

2192
02:46:13,363 --> 02:46:15,831
Oh I see,along with the lawyers
profession,you've also become a doctor

2193
02:46:16,032 --> 02:46:17,499
No,I have the medical
certificates

2194
02:46:21,204 --> 02:46:22,330
Right now,he is under
what treatment?

2195
02:46:22,872 --> 02:46:24,339
There was a small wound
on his leg -

2196
02:46:24,708 --> 02:46:26,505
Because of the Sugar increase,there
was gangrene formation -

2197
02:46:26,710 --> 02:46:28,177
They gave him an injection
on the spinal cord -

2198
02:46:28,378 --> 02:46:29,504
They have cut one of
his legs

2199
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:34,680
Oh my god,where is my leg
Oh my god,where is my leg?

2200
02:46:35,552 --> 02:46:37,179
Sir,the sugar has again
increased

2201
02:46:37,387 --> 02:46:38,012
Now,what will
they do?

2202
02:46:38,388 --> 02:46:41,687
Nothing much,they'll cut the second
leg and keep it in the Delhi Museum

2203
02:46:43,226 --> 02:46:46,195
Sir,Please don't disturb the patient
Kindly leave him alone

2204
02:46:46,396 --> 02:46:47,693
Ay,Lawyer,shut your gob and
get out from here

2205
02:46:48,231 --> 02:46:50,199
Sir don't believe it I am
very healthy

2206
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:52,698
Before dying,people will be
bright & shiny like you

2207
02:46:52,902 --> 02:46:55,871
You have sugar,B.P and all the
ailments that are in the medical records

2208
02:46:56,406 --> 02:46:57,873
Sir,all those are false
certificates

2209
02:46:58,074 --> 02:46:58,870
Don't believe it

2210
02:47:03,913 --> 02:47:06,381
Now,Decently tell me,Where all
have they planted the bombs

2211
02:47:07,584 --> 02:47:09,381
Tiger Balm,or
Zandu Balm..

2212
02:47:09,586 --> 02:47:11,884
Joke! And you expect us
to laugh at this

2213
02:47:12,255 --> 02:47:14,052
Bloody,we'll tear you apart
tell us

2214
02:47:14,424 --> 02:47:16,392
I swear,I don't know

2215
02:47:16,760 --> 02:47:18,728
Chinnasamy look,You are caught
red handed

2216
02:47:19,095 --> 02:47:21,563
You yourself have given a false certificate
that you have high sugar

2217
02:47:22,098 --> 02:47:24,726
Even if we cut your leg or hand
there is no one to ask for you,tell

2218
02:47:29,272 --> 02:47:29,567
Brother

2219
02:47:29,773 --> 02:47:30,569
Touch,any of these
3 fingers

2220
02:47:31,107 --> 02:47:31,732
This is for what?

2221
02:47:31,941 --> 02:47:32,566
To cut your hand

2222
02:47:33,276 --> 02:47:33,571
This

2223
02:47:33,777 --> 02:47:34,744
To cut your leg

2224
02:47:34,944 --> 02:47:35,410
Then this

2225
02:47:35,612 --> 02:47:36,237
For that...

2226
02:47:36,446 --> 02:47:38,243
Oh my god,Don't cut any of
them I'll tell you

2227
02:47:38,448 --> 02:47:38,914
Fast

2228
02:47:39,115 --> 02:47:39,410
I'll tell you

2229
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:41,974
We have planted it in
4 places

2230
02:47:42,285 --> 02:47:48,087
A bank on mount road,railway station,
in a marriage hall, and one in a cop's bike

2231
02:47:51,961 --> 02:47:54,088
Can we do business by keeping your leg,
you yourself keep it

2232
02:47:55,465 --> 02:47:56,591
So,then can I take
rest?

2233
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:57,767
Yes of course,but in
the lock up

2234
02:47:58,134 --> 02:48:00,261
At once,contact the bomb squads and
ask them to go to the spot

2235
02:48:00,970 --> 02:48:02,096
Call up the Police
control room -

2236
02:48:02,305 --> 02:48:06,264
And ask them to park all the cop's bikes
in a no man area

2237
02:48:16,486 --> 02:48:17,453
Sir,Did you find
anything?

2238
02:48:17,654 --> 02:48:18,450
Nothing,as of now

2239
02:48:19,489 --> 02:48:20,615
Sir,You go,We'll
do it

2240
02:48:40,510 --> 02:48:41,977
Son,Don't move

2241
02:48:42,345 --> 02:48:42,811
Wait...

2242
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,146
Hold him

2243
02:49:40,069 --> 02:49:43,038
There is a bomb inside the hall
everybody move out

2244
02:50:59,983 --> 02:51:01,610
Sir,To ruin the Govt. of
Pugalenthi -

2245
02:51:01,818 --> 02:51:03,445
It seems,you have planted the
Bombs in 4 places

2246
02:51:03,653 --> 02:51:06,622
He'll himself plant the bomb,and
he'll himself defuse it

2247
02:51:06,823 --> 02:51:08,120
And he'll put the blame
on us

2248
02:51:12,161 --> 02:51:12,786
How is it
possible? -

2249
02:51:12,996 --> 02:51:14,463
Not a single planted bomb
would blast

2250
02:51:14,831 --> 02:51:17,459
He'll defuse the bomb correctly before
it gets blasted

2251
02:51:19,836 --> 02:51:21,963
The opposition party which is
fully united -

2252
02:51:22,171 --> 02:51:23,968
The only scare that it would again
come into power -

2253
02:51:24,173 --> 02:51:26,300
This is the conspiracy hatched
by him

2254
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:27,806
But,the one which was planted in
his house

2255
02:51:28,011 --> 02:51:28,807
But he didn't
die

2256
02:51:31,514 --> 02:51:32,481
Don't you learn
from this -

2257
02:51:33,016 --> 02:51:38,147
That to protect up his political image,he is
even prepared to kill his own parents

2258
02:51:42,859 --> 02:51:43,484
Sir,Your reply

2259
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:45,486
Look,there will be an
enquiry made

2260
02:51:46,195 --> 02:51:48,163
You yourself planted the bomb to
kill your own parents...

2261
02:52:40,917 --> 02:52:42,009
Why did you ask me
to come?

2262
02:52:42,085 --> 02:52:44,645
Hey look,I myself did not wish
to sit on this chair

2263
02:52:44,754 --> 02:52:46,312
Neither,did I snatch it
from you

2264
02:52:46,422 --> 02:52:48,219
Lakhs of people came searching
for me in my house -

2265
02:52:48,257 --> 02:52:49,690
Only in the good faith,that I'll
do something good for them -

2266
02:52:49,759 --> 02:52:51,351
And they have casted their votes to me
and made me to sit here

2267
02:52:51,427 --> 02:52:52,985
I am thinking of doing some thing
good for them -

2268
02:52:53,096 --> 02:52:55,064
But you,...You are not
allowing it to happen

2269
02:52:55,264 --> 02:52:58,893
Do it,fearlessly do it, I am not
stopping you

2270
02:52:59,435 --> 02:53:01,062
You are not stopping,but
you are spoiling it

2271
02:53:01,771 --> 02:53:04,399
Even thought of using your brain which you
use it to dethrown ruling party -

2272
02:53:04,607 --> 02:53:07,735
Even 1./. of had you spent
it on the public welfare -

2273
02:53:07,944 --> 02:53:09,241
Our country would have developed
long back

2274
02:53:11,948 --> 02:53:15,907
You'll always create problems like Strike
Caste conflicts,Bomb blasts..

2275
02:53:16,119 --> 02:53:17,245
Will I think about the
welfare of the people?

2276
02:53:17,453 --> 02:53:19,250
Or will I follow the trail of
the bombs placed by you?

2277
02:53:19,622 --> 02:53:21,749
From the very begining itself you have
been accusing me!

2278
02:53:22,125 --> 02:53:24,093
The Police is under your control
File a case against me

2279
02:53:24,293 --> 02:53:25,419
Order an enquiry commission -

2280
02:53:25,628 --> 02:53:26,925
If you are able to establish
the truth hang me!

2281
02:53:27,130 --> 02:53:28,097
Am I stopping you?

2282
02:53:29,465 --> 02:53:31,933
I know how a spineless politician
will try to escape from the law

2283
02:53:32,301 --> 02:53:33,598
You cannot escape from me!

2284
02:53:37,473 --> 02:53:38,269
I am going to kill you!

2285
02:53:43,980 --> 02:53:45,948
You are not able to handle
me,isn't it?

2286
02:53:46,649 --> 02:53:48,617
You don't have to show compassion
towards a mosquito's life

2287
02:53:49,819 --> 02:53:52,788
30 yrs of my political life I have spent
eating flesh and leaving shells behind

2288
02:53:53,990 --> 02:53:55,617
Now,I have came to your place-

2289
02:53:56,325 --> 02:53:57,451
Everyone outside knows
about it

2290
02:53:59,662 --> 02:54:01,459
Only we both are here!

2291
02:54:02,498 --> 02:54:04,796
You cannot escape that easily
after killing me

2292
02:54:05,334 --> 02:54:06,631
If you have 30 yrs
experience

2293
02:54:07,003 --> 02:54:08,971
Adding this 1 years of your
acquittance with me -

2294
02:54:09,172 --> 02:54:10,969
I have became a 31 yrs experienced
politician

2295
02:54:12,675 --> 02:54:13,642
Now,I am going to shoot..

2296
02:54:14,510 --> 02:54:17,809
Not you but myself!

2297
02:54:33,196 --> 02:54:35,664
You have made me a fool!
Now you die!

2298
02:54:56,385 --> 02:54:57,852
How can I sit in your seat?

2299
02:54:58,221 --> 02:55:00,519
It may be good for an argument
but is it practically possible?

2300
02:55:00,723 --> 02:55:01,519
It's possible!

2301
02:55:01,724 --> 02:55:03,453
Why don't you be there for a day
and see it by yourself?

2302
02:55:19,909 --> 02:55:25,370
Mr.Krishnan! Atlast they have even turned
me into a Politician

2303
02:55:26,749 --> 02:55:29,547
Sir,leave it. He had been playing politics
always for bad

2304
02:55:30,086 --> 02:55:32,384
You have played it only for once
for a good deed!

2305
02:55:32,588 --> 02:55:33,384
You keep quiet!

2306
02:55:33,923 --> 02:55:36,391
You didn't tell me anything and
I didn't listen to anything

2307
02:55:38,761 --> 02:55:40,558
You Sinner! How injusticely
you have shot him?

2308
02:55:41,764 --> 02:55:42,230
How's that?

2309
02:56:00,116 --> 02:56:04,075
Son! I am ignorant about other
things except agriculture!

2310
02:56:04,620 --> 02:56:08,579
I was concerned only about the welfare
of my daughter!

2311
02:56:09,292 --> 02:56:12,750
But,you have sacrificed your own
parents for the sake of others welfare -

2312
02:56:13,629 --> 02:56:16,097
And there is no one besides you
to take care of you

2313
02:56:22,471 --> 02:56:23,096
I bless you!
