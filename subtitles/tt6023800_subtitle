1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,042
FF

2
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,333
May I help you, sir?

3
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,417
Hello? What's your name?

4
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,125
Sir, your name please?

5
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,500
Kabir.

6
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,375
Good morning.

7
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,042
Very good morning!

8
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
Your tea is ready.

9
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,333
Kabir...

10
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,375
Can't believe I've been
drinking your tea for a year...

11
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,333
So what are you getting me?

12
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,250
It's a surprise.
Maybe you'll like it.

13
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,417
Really! Even I have
a surprise for you.

14
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,333
Something very special!

15
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:49,917
Just come home and see...

16
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,125
I'm coming...

17
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,792
Just a couple of
more things to buy.

18
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,125
After all I need to make
lunch for her majesty.

19
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,042
It is a husband's duty.

20
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,333
Ok. So bye for now-
- One minute!

21
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,250
You haven't charged
your phone again-

22
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,000
No, no. It's fully charged!

23
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,125
And in any case, I
am coming home.

24
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,542
In a year, you haven't
learned to lie one bit.

25
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,333
If I learnt I'd miss
your scoldings.

26
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,000
Come home and I'll only
scold you. No food!

27
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:33,542
Stop giggling and come home.
Let's eat breakfast together!

28
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,667
I'm coming...

29
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,125
Bye...

30
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:01,833
Whoa!

31
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,708
One sec...

32
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:11,625
Here!

33
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,792
Pass the ball...

34
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,333
Stop giggling and come home.
Let's eat breakfast together!

35
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Even I have a surprise for you.

36
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,125
Something very special!

37
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,167
Just come home and see...

38
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,458
Hello?

39
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,542
Quick! Quick! Quick!

40
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,333
He's bleeding a lot!

41
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,667
What do you whisper
every morning?

42
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,042
Just one wish...

43
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,292
That I should die before you...

44
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,333
and gift you my aura-

45
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,292
My aura is yours...

46
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,333
Quickly!
Get the OT ready!

47
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,625
Scissor please...

48
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,042
Scalpel...

49
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,167
Kabeer has been
shot several times.

50
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,875
This...

51
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,750
This is what you wanted!
- Ruhi!

52
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,083
No! I wanted to
shoot him myself!

53
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,042
I've dreamt about
it for 10 years.

54
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,042
From the day I chose
to walk this path...

55
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,583
I had forgotten to fear death.

56
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,167
Just one word...

57
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,500
Target!

58
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,750
Hit it and you live.

59
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,875
Miss it and you die.

60
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:35,083
I heard that your
brother's a junkie...

61
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,708
Serving his drug
peddling sentence, aren't you?

62
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,583
Good, good.

63
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,542
These cases keep you in
prison for at least 5 months.

64
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,708
You'll have to eat this
rotten bread till then...

65
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,750
But will your brother
survive that long?

66
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,917
Tell me...

67
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:55,000
I can get you out
of here in 8 days.

68
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
8 days...

69
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,750
Will give you some money too...

70
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,000
One small job...

71
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,750
Your cell partner, Ajay...

72
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,333
Need to hold it to his neck...

73
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,250
One small slit...

74
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,417
That's all.

75
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,583
Game over.

76
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,958
Or else the game takes a twist...

77
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,083
Look at this Kabeer.

78
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,167
Our enemy!

79
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
He was bugging us for days.

80
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,000
You see Kabeer...

81
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,208
When there is no need to kill...

82
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,125
Then why kill at all?

83
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,167
Where were you?

84
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,958
What's this?

85
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,792
What happened to you?

86
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,792
Kabeer?

87
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,375
Jamwal sir...

88
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,625
What's your name?

89
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:40,875
Kabeer (Magnificent).

90
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,792
What an unapt name...

91
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,042
He's crazy. He killed
him in one go.

92
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,500
Boss! Make him your lackey.

93
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,667
Chotu, you have to be
crazy to make history.

94
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,833
Just you see, this
boy will be king...

95
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,125
He will make history...

96
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,417
He won't be a lackey...

97
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,583
He'll be a Master (Guru)

98
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,250
Not Kabeer...

99
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,292
Your name is now Guru.

100
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,792
From today you are my son.

101
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,000
My son...

102
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,833
So...

103
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,042
Will you be my son?

104
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,917
Will you?

105
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,500
From then on Kabeer
started becoming Guru...

106
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,333
I became Jamwal's son.

107
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,958
I would do exactly what
my Father told me to.

108
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,333
Baba (Father) has
cancelled the deal.

109
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,750
Baba has cancelled the deal.

110
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,583
Sit!

111
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,125
Fear can turn even a dog into a
lion, so don't get scared.

112
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,917
What's your number?

113
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,167
32!

114
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,958
Phone number!

115
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,458
Give me your phone!

116
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,375
My phone?

117
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,208
Ya!

118
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,458
Where are you going?

119
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,875
Finish the conversation!

120
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,208
Bye!

121
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,208
Is your party over?

122
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,500
Hey! He asked you something!

123
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,375
I think he's deaf.

124
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,292
Hey! Guru talks less and pops more.

125
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,667
Guti likes a few things
and what he likes most is...

126
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,500
Sunny Leone!
- Yes!

127
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,792
When is her show?

128
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,500
You have to finish in
one and a half minutes.

129
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,458
Now that Guti has said
it, it must be done.

130
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:24,375
In this 1.30 minutes you may not grow
brains but you'll definitely grow lumps!

131
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,417
Hey!

132
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,333
I had not planned
on killing you today.

133
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,167
But plans can be changed.

134
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,125
What about these two?

135
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:00,083
They were making
fun of you too...

136
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,500
Finish them off!

137
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,667
When there is no need
to kill, why kill at all?

138
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,875
Someone had told me this...

139
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,875
Get the parcel ready.

140
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,417
Salami is good, isn't it?

141
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,042
Zakir Bhai, please eat.

142
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,542
These are local fruits...

143
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,708
Guru shouldn't have
killed Tommy's men.

144
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,833
There's no profit in
making enemies with Tommy.

145
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,125
Only loss...

146
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,250
What is the fun of
business without loss?

147
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,958
My son is here!
Come sit.

148
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,583
We promised not to
enter each others territory.

149
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,958
If you didn't like the deal,
you could have said no.

150
00:18:57,042 --> 00:19:00,083
This violence is unnecessary.

151
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,750
If everyone goes around
showing off their power...

152
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,792
There'll only be war...

153
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,583
and no business.

154
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,500
Sit down.

155
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,333
So who was talking
about business?

156
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,250
My father used to say...

157
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,917
When you eat, eat in peace.

158
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,833
What's wrong, son?

159
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,500
Guru did the job I
assigned to you?

160
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,167
I murdered someone
to save my brother.

161
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,083
And you...

162
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,208
couldn't wait a day more?

163
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,250
You killed my brother...

164
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,417
Look at my hands...

165
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,417
Look...

166
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,500
My hands are stained with blood.

167
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,583
Look!

168
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,708
This is what you
wanted me to do?

169
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:07,125
This is what you
wanted to make me...

170
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,875
A murderer!

171
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,875
Very well!

172
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,375
Then this is what I will be.

173
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,917
Because it's what you want?

174
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,500
This is the path
you've shown me.

175
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,417
From today...

176
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,083
you will profit too!

177
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,333
You will get a share.

178
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,542
From today you are my partner.

179
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,500
My partner in crime.

180
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,125
Profit or loss...

181
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,833
we'll share it equally.

182
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,208
The partnership is doing well.

183
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,208
You increase my business and...

184
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,625
I increase your share.

185
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,250
Don't worry...

186
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,042
these hands have seen
much blood since Ajay.

187
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:23,292
Leaving without Sajda(Prayer)?

188
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,583
Kabeer?

189
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:32,208
One day God will send
you a Farishta(Angel).

190
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,500
That will be the day
you perform Sajda.

191
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,125
There you go...

192
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:46,083
A phone call from my Farishta.

193
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes, Baba...

194
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,500
Beta(Son)...

195
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,208
My own kitten is
biting me today.

196
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,542
Kill Vishnu!

197
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,583
Just keep it there...

198
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,250
Going against Baba?

199
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,208
I have not gone against anyone.

200
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,917
I'm walking a straight path.

201
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,125
Does leaving crime imply
that I'm going against him?

202
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,125
Want to shoot me?

203
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,375
Then do it.

204
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,042
Vishnu is not afraid of dying.

205
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:27,792
Atleast I will die a
gentlemans' death.

206
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,250
Just leave.

207
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,000
Go somewhere far away.

208
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,958
Next time I won't be
able to stop myself.

209
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:02,875
Last night gangster Vishnu
was mysteriously murdered.

210
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,000
The police have begun
their investigation.

211
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,542
I knew you wouldn't do it.

212
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,708
It was a small job thus
Chotu(The tiny one).

213
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,458
But why kill Vishnu?

214
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,125
He just wanted to
live a regular life-

215
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:21,875
Beta!

216
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,458
In our business a
regular life...

217
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,875
is impossible to maintain.

218
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,375
Always remember...

219
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:33,917
A man who shoots with you today
may shoot at you tomorrow.

220
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,708
And Chotu didn't kill him.

221
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,208
He was dead the day...

222
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,750
he decided to
surrender his life.

223
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,333
What do you think son?

224
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,208
Think our life is here?

225
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,708
No! Our life is here!

226
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,042
And Vishnu...

227
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,458
He gave up his life.

228
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,667
Don't make the
same mistake twice.

229
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,750
Move!

230
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,625
Three of my men had gone
to talk business with Jamwal.

231
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,417
How many returned?

232
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,875
Two!

233
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,667
I couldn't even find
the others' body.

234
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,917
I want a body!

235
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,333
Guru's body.

236
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,167
Can you get it?

237
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,000
No problem, Tommy sir.

238
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,792
We meet here.

239
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,542
Your physique
doesn't suit a gun...

240
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,750
it suits a chillum(smoking pipe)

241
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,542
Will you ever fight your
own battles, tommy?

242
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,458
You should stop sending
these useless rentals.

243
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,083
Your parents did a good job...

244
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,125
naming you Tommy.

245
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:16,583
Both your name and behaviour...

246
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:20,167
resembles that of a dog.

247
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:27,833
If you step on a dogs tail,
it will bite.

248
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,958
If I pull the
trigger you're dead.

249
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,375
But what's the point?

250
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,875
You're worth more to me alive.

251
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,417
A lesson!

252
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:48,833
Many will learn a
lesson by seeing you.

253
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,125
So...

254
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:56,542
from today 70% of
your business is Baba's.

255
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,250
Do I look like an idiot
who will give 70%?

256
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,792
You will look like an idiot...

257
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,208
if you don't comply.

258
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:10,458
Think about it carefully.

259
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,792
What is bigger-life or business?

260
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,833
Remember the saying...

261
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:19,583
There is always a need
for calculation in emotion.

262
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,000
Cheers!

263
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:32,792
Profit!

264
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,542
Profit!

265
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,583
Mr.Tommy has made a profit.

266
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:43,292
He has got his life in
exchange for 70% of his business.

267
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:48,083
Guarantee of life is a big
thing in our business.

268
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,000
Hello, Mr.Jason.

269
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,250
Cheers!

270
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,500
Do you like this deal or not?

271
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,167
Let me explain.

272
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:16,708
Say you are asked for 70%
of your business at gun point.

273
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,292
Wouldn't you take the deal?

274
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,042
Why so serious?

275
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,292
I'm joking!

276
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,625
I'm joking!

277
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:34,333
Joking...

278
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,417
My son...

279
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,542
Chotu!

280
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:50,833
I have a gift for you.

281
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,875
This is for the 70%

282
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,625
You have given me great joy!

283
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,125
Wear it...

284
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,917
Hello Mr.Jamwal!

285
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,083
Cheers!

286
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,333
Hey!

287
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:46,417
Hey!

288
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,458
Hey Guru! Are you ok?

289
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,542
I'm ok. Give me some water.

290
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,208
It was right here...

291
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,417
Wait a minute...

292
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,667
Where is it?

293
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,792
There we go!

294
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,125
Here.

295
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,167
Guti wait!

296
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,042
Hey! Hello!

297
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,042
Hello!

298
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,875
Could you please help me?

299
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,458
Hello!

300
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:44,583
Hello!

301
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:49,250
One day God will send
you a Farishta(Angel).

302
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,833
That will be the day
you perform Sajda.

303
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,625
Oh my! You are
badly hurt!

304
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,500
Oh my!

305
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,417
Even you are hurt!

306
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,208
Let me see...

307
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,750
Give me one minute.

308
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,875
It hurts, doesn't it?

309
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,042
What's your name?

310
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,125
How did this happen?

311
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,542
Who the Hell...

312
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:40,542
You've lost your
memory, haven't you?

313
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,042
Guru!

314
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,833
Hey Guru!

315
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:54,583
Oh my! Please help me...

316
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,917
Please help me!

317
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,833
I can't pick him up. Please!

318
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,375
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

319
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,458
Are you ok?
Let me see.

320
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,000
What the-
I think he is very ill.

321
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,000
Is it hurting?

322
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,458
I am so sorry.
Let me see.

323
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,292
How did this accident happen?

324
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,208
Guru!

325
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,625
I am talking to the two of you!

326
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,000
You don't understand
Bengali, do you?

327
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,292
Does no one understand?

328
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,333
You get to the hospital.
I will take him.

329
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,458
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

330
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:22,333
Sir! This is Guru's
friend's car.

331
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,625
Sir!

332
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,375
Call an ambulance.
- Ok, sir.

333
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:13,333
We all have to do our part...

334
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:17,458
Hey! Hello! Hi!

335
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,458
1 minute.

336
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,833
You are exactly like me.

337
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,750
You treat and you come to meet.

338
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,083
Hey you! Thank him for
helping you yesterday.

339
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,458
Say thank you!

340
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,958
Although you look like a pauper...

341
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,000
Do you have some money?

342
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,208
Excuse me! Why
are you still here?

343
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,750
This is a private hospital,
not a charity house.

344
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,333
These kids will do
drugs and fight and we-

345
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,958
Hello! Uncle!
- Uncle?

346
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,417
Just do your job. How
much money do you need?

347
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,292
I'll give it wait!

348
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,917
1 minute.

349
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,667
Never judge a book
by it's cover...

350
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:18,750
I take back my pauper comment.

351
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,417
And hello uncle!

352
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,958
Now go treat him!

353
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,083
Oh! You're here!
Come, come...

354
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:30,167
How are you?
You can't do drugs anymore...

355
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,792
Go to sleep.

356
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,667
Howcome you aren't studying?

357
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,667
Dada(Big brother), let me sleep!

358
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:47,125
Oh! You studied all night...

359
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,375
Ok. Get some rest.

360
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,875
Hello! Don't go anywhere!

361
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,750
I need to return your money.

362
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:14,958
Hey!

363
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,000
Why was your car there?
- Sir, please wait...

364
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,625
Sir calm down...
- Tell me!

365
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:22,125
Susu! I want to pee.
I didn't do anything sir...

366
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,833
Give me a minute.
- Who were they?

367
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,792
My shirt will tear and
the car will break.

368
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,125
One minute sir...

369
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,542
Shouldn't be so brutal!

370
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,500
Hey!
- Yes, sir?

371
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,583
Who killed them?

372
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,833
Not us, sir.

373
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,417
Not you?
- Not us.

374
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,708
Who killed them?
- Don't hit my head.

375
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,458
You or Guru?
- My head...

376
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,375
Your car was found there.

377
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
One minute...
- Tell me?

378
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:46,458
It was an accident.
Many cars pass at great speed-

379
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:49,500
You're teaching me the difference
between an accident and murder?

380
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,542
Sir, highway...

381
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,917
Tell me!
- Highway sir. Please avoid the head.

382
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,542
Sir, look at the highway.
That is a highway.

383
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,750
Sir, don't you know
what a highway is?

384
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,833
Hey!

385
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,625
Sir?

386
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,833
No evidence, no witnesses
and no warrant.

387
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,375
And yet you forcefully
picked up my friend?

388
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,500
Take him back if you want.

389
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,375
Get up if your alive.

390
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,250
Hi!

391
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,375
He's a real box of tricks.

392
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,250
That's why he's still alive.

393
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,833
Else his wings would
have been chopped long back.

394
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,625
You're very proud of your
friendship, aren't you?

395
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,333
This doesn't work in your business.

396
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:52,000
One day your best friend-
- Will chop my wings?

397
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:59,333
There may be various
points of view.

398
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,167
There's a saying...

399
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,000
You can fix the eyes
but not the view.

400
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,917
Remember how many
you killed that day?

401
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,708
This time you have left evidence.

402
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,708
What are you saying, Shiv Babu?

403
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,292
Are you saying I'm a murderer?

404
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,750
Who did I kill?

405
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,292
I just visited one of
them at the hospital?

406
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,583
You can check if you'd like.

407
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,042
You're a slick
worker and talker.

408
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:39,792
The day I get any evidence,
I will shut all of it for good.

409
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,292
Just look at this!

410
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:49,500
You've known me for so long
and yet you never asked how I am.

411
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,417
Not the slightest enquiry
about my injuries.

412
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,042
One more thing, Shiv Babu...

413
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:09,250
you are a pretty slick
worker and talker yourself.

414
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,167
God speed!

415
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,708
Why were you so late?

416
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,375
I wasn't late.
My timing was perfect.

417
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:48,417
Hi!

418
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:50,792
Let's go.

419
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:02,167
Hi!

420
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:03,583
Hi!

421
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,333
We are truly fated
to meet each other.

422
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,958
I am not one of those debtors
who run the other way.

423
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:14,500
Why is it that someone is
always injured when I meet you?

424
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,625
Ow! Easy!

425
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,375
Turn this way!

426
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,625
Do something...
Keep this.

427
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,333
Keep applying it regularly
to avoid infection.

428
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,125
What happened?
What are you thinking?

429
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:40,833
You think I'm paying my 20,000 debt
by giving you an antiseptic?

430
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:41,667
No...

431
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:45,875
No! What you are thinking
is wrong! One minute.

432
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,333
Give me your phone number,
address and name.

433
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,667
I will deliver the money
at your doorstep.

434
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,625
No... There's no need for that.

435
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,917
No need...
No need!

436
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,000
Think you can buy me for 20000?

437
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:06,708
The name's Ruhi. I will return every penny!
What's your name?

438
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,208
Ruhi...

439
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:08,875
What's your name?

440
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,417
Kabir!
- Guru!

441
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:15,292
Your name's Guru?

442
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,667
Ya... That's what they call me.

443
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,750
Yes! The name carries weight!

444
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,833
Guru! Mahaguru(Grand Teacher)!
Guru is your name!

445
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,542
Khoka(Little boy), can
I say something?

446
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,458
I shouldn't say it but...

447
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:33,292
the name Guru
sounds very nefarious.

448
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,208
I'll call you Kabeer.

449
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,250
Kabeer...

450
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,542
Give me your number?

451
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:44,625
All lines to this
route are unavailable.

452
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,875
I'll give it to you.

453
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,042
+44
- +44

454
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,417
391239!

455
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,667
I'll call you once I
get the money.

456
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,958
Bye! Take care!

457
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:15,125
In the sunshine of your name,

458
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,042
I have drowned in the sea,

459
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:23,167
And I know not
how far I will go...

460
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:39,125
In the sunshine of your name,

461
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,125
I have drowned in the sea,

462
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:47,167
And I know not
how far I will go...

463
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,125
In my cursed life,

464
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,042
In my nights and days,

465
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:59,667
You have come and
I know not why...

466
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:05,917
My heart plans to run away...

467
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:11,542
But it is trapped with you...

468
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:17,417
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

469
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:23,125
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

470
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:29,417
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

471
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:35,125
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

472
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,208
In just a week,

473
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,125
We have started
playing games all day...

474
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,250
And I am unable to stop it...

475
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:06,042
In temples and mosques
of your name...

476
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,458
I have made many a promise...

477
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:17,542
Let the drops make an ocean,

478
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:23,792
But you please paint
me the way you wish...

479
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,417
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

480
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:35,125
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

481
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:41,375
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

482
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:47,083
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

483
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,417
In the depths of my heart,

484
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,458
And with a sleepless mind,

485
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:24,208
I will drown with you...

486
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:30,417
I now have many reasons,

487
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:36,000
To discover myself...

488
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:41,792
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

489
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:47,500
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

490
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:53,417
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

491
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:59,125
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

492
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:16,792
You know I was never
in to the drug business...

493
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,375
And I never will be.

494
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,708
But this is our
first order, Beta.

495
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,250
Just do it the first time.

496
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:28,917
The same way I slit a man's
throat for the first time?

497
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,458
How absurd!

498
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,708
No means no!

499
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:39,542
I can do the job instead of him!

500
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,542
A smart man knows when to speak!

501
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,667
Do you think I can't do it?

502
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:47,333
Will you let go of such a deal?

503
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:49,875
The job will be done.

504
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:51,833
Only the methods will change.

505
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,625
Oh my Baby Doll!

506
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,000
Sometimes I feel like...

507
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,875
leaving all of it.

508
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,500
This dirty work,
this business...

509
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,583
I just want to set my life.

510
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,375
Can't set your own hair-

511
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,583
But I'm trying to set my life.

512
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,667
I know.

513
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:22,083
Remember what
happened to Vishnu?

514
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:24,167
I'm not Vishnu.

515
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,250
Let's not get into this!

516
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,583
Hey bro...

517
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,875
Why does boudi(Your
wife) call you Kabeer?

518
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:34,000
Where did you dig up this name?

519
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,042
Kabeer is a part of me that...

520
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,417
even I had forgotten.

521
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:49,917
Hello?

522
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,375
Open!

523
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,750
Open!

524
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,625
It's A-Grade stuff, boss!

525
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,042
We're going to be rich!

526
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:16,583
I know.

527
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,917
It's what I had predicted.

528
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,333
Now just see how
much more will come.

529
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:23,667
This is just the beginning.

530
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:26,625
It's not the beginning...

531
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,542
it's the end!

532
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,583
This is where it all ends!

533
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,208
Hey!

534
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:44,333
You're making a mistake, Beta.

535
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,875
A big mistake!

536
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:52,875
What you have done is
an even greater mistake.

537
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,750
You know...

538
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,167
that Guru's heart does not
forgive or forget mistakes.

539
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,625
Ruhi!

540
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:17,750
One minute.

541
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,625
Hey! What are you
doing here now?

542
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,708
Actually I...

543
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:26,333
What's wrong?

544
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,208
Ruhi will you marry me?

545
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,000
Just look at this, Amma!

546
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:40,083
I said a few nice things and
now this boy wants to marry me.

547
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:44,167
What do you say?
Should I marry him?

548
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,917
Is the groom ok?

549
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,667
He's like a diamond!

550
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:55,042
God has sent him for you and us.

551
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:57,333
Come on! Stand
next to each other.

552
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,250
You look so good together!

553
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:06,250
Oh God! Do bless them!

554
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,958
Amma...

555
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:11,042
I'm not a good person.

556
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,542
I am not wothy of your praise.

557
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,875
I'm actually a...

558
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,250
bad person.

559
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,333
A very bad person!

560
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:20,917
Ruhi, you know nothing about me.

561
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Everything you know is a lie.

562
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:28,708
The truth is that I'm a killer.

563
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm a gangster!

564
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:36,375
Ruhi?

565
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,250
Ruhi!
- Ruhi...

566
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:39,958
Ruhi...

567
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,792
Hold her...

568
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,500
Hey! Inside!

569
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,083
Get inside!

570
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,625
Gangster...

571
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:57,833
Gangster...

572
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,000
Ruhi...

573
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:04,000
This is not an
addiction or a pleasure.

574
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,875
It's not something
that I can't stop.

575
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,333
I joined this work
because I was helpless.

576
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,875
But I always wanted to leave.
I just needed a reason.

577
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,792
But now I have found a reason.

578
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,708
You...

579
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,208
What if I leave all of this?

580
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,917
And never do it again?

581
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,792
Then will you marry me?

582
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,000
Baba!

583
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:52,792
You call me your son.

584
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,208
Well, I have brought my wife.

585
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,208
Won't you give us
your blessings?

586
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:03,208
Tell me, you've got your wife
here for the first time.

587
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,042
Tell me what you want.

588
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:12,000
Freedom.

589
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,542
That's all I want.

590
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:18,000
From now on I will only do
what my heart desires.

591
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:22,583
And I want to live
as Kabeer not Guru.

592
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,542
How can I say no as a father?

593
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,125
But remember one thing...

594
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:36,208
the weapon you give up today,
will be taken up by another tomorrow.

595
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,042
And it may be aimed at you.

596
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,208
I've told you this before.

597
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:45,875
Think about what you are doing.

598
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:50,750
If I dwell on tomorrow,
I will never enjoy today.

599
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:55,167
I will do what I have decided.

600
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,083
See you.

601
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:32,208
In the world that
I have left behind...

602
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:38,333
stories start after
someone has been killed.

603
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:43,208
The stains of blood
are not easy to forget.

604
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:47,375
And my only fear is...

605
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:50,417
Will I be able to protect you?

606
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,333
I know that...

607
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:59,583
my Kabeer will
give his life for me.

608
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:04,500
Without any question.

609
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:14,833
Just like this...

610
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:20,333
Become a habit to me...

611
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:25,875
I know there is no danger...

612
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:30,458
And without you
there is no life...

613
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,083
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

614
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:41,250
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

615
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:46,667
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

616
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:51,833
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

617
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:18,542
Someone like you...

618
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:24,542
Makes promises and
then disappears.

619
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:29,083
A wave like you...

620
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:34,375
Takes me far away...

621
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:39,625
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

622
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:44,792
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

623
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:50,208
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

624
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:55,375
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

625
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:34,000
Why were you
fighting for 5 bucks?

626
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:37,917
It's not about the 5 bucks.
It's about honesty!

627
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,292
The guy was cheating us.

628
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:43,750
Ok, relax. I'll be
back in 5 minutes.

629
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,958
Get him...
- Catch him!

630
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,958
No one hits him.

631
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,000
He hit my brother!

632
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:13,208
No one will lay a finger on him!

633
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,750
Uncle! Go!

634
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,250
Or I shoot you! Go!

635
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:41,917
Go!

636
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,375
I thought Guru had resurfaced.

637
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,000
Guru?

638
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:56,375
Who is that?

639
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:59,458
I am Kabeer.

640
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:00,750
Ruhi's Kabeer...

641
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:05,042
I want to keep you with me,

642
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:10,542
In the morn and in the eve...

643
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,583
If you do not call out,
I will stay mum,

644
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:21,708
In every day and every noon...

645
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:26,083
Just like this...

646
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:31,583
Become a habit to me...

647
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:37,125
I know there is no danger...

648
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:41,708
And without you
there is no life...

649
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,333
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

650
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:52,500
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

651
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:57,958
Touch my finger, flowers will bloom
and bodies will bathe.

652
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:03,125
And let us promise to
never stay out of sight.

653
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:45,208
It's a miracle he's
regained consciousness.

654
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,958
We need to make arrangements.

655
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,708
Here comes the
twist in the tale!

656
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,125
Welcome back!

657
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:07,458
What should I call you?
Kabeer or Guru?

658
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,917
Ruhi...

659
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:06,000
The real pain was felt here...

660
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,417
How did I survive?

661
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,833
Ruhi I want-
- No Kabeer!

662
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,958
First I want to say something.

663
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,208
Your father was right.

664
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:23,833
If you drop your weapons, others
will take them up against you.

665
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:28,125
You may have left this world but
this world hasn't left you.

666
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,500
I took you out of that world.

667
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,625
And today I'm telling you...

668
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,667
Go!

669
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,417
Go back!

670
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,833
Take revenge on those who
have done this to you.

671
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,958
What's the need Ruhi? You-
- Kabeer!

672
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,125
You had promised...

673
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:55,583
that you would
never question me.

674
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,750
Fine.

675
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,667
I won't say a word.

676
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,625
But do you realise that you
are sending me to war?

677
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:07,625
Kab-

678
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,792
War?

679
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,542
The war has already begun.

680
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:19,292
They started it.

681
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:23,292
And guess who will finish it?

682
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,417
My brother!

683
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:19,875
The first thing I saw as
I got shot was your face.

684
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:23,417
And then I remembered the
things you used to say.

685
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:27,042
I really felt like
talking to you.

686
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,667
I tried aswell.

687
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,083
But I had lied about my
phone being charged...

688
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:39,000
And lies do not hold
for very long.

689
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,875
Isn't that true, Ruhi?

690
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,875
You'll take red so I
shall take blue.

691
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:07,833
Here. It's your turn.

692
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:16,375
You gave them a
chance to attack you.

693
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,500
Who were they?

694
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,000
I don't know, Baba.

695
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,500
They were all wearing masks.

696
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:31,250
When you fire 1 bullet
you create a 1000 enemies.

697
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:40,042
I'm sure you don't have count of the
number of people you have killed.

698
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:45,125
Don't worry. I'll try and
find out who they were.

699
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:48,375
Distance is created by this...

700
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:53,125
And the heart
bridges that distance.

701
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:59,292
No matter how much you try to
push me away, you are always here.

702
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,083
You are my son.

703
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:21,000
I'll throw you off!
Trying to kill Guru?

704
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:24,417
Guru...

705
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,250
Guti, where are you?

706
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:30,417
I have found out who they are!

707
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,667
I have one of their guys with me.

708
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:38,250
He supplied the guns.
The guns!

709
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:41,958
Guti don't hit him.
- Supplied guns!

710
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,000
Know who they were...

711
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,333
Jason!

712
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,958
Tommy!

713
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,917
Chotu!

714
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,583
And...

715
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,958
your father.
- Cheers!

716
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:59,000
Jamwal Saheb.

717
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,542
From today you are my son.

718
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,625
You know why?

719
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,625
I know.

720
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,833
Because a lack of support
implicates opposition.

721
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,833
Freedom!

722
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:20,667
From today I will do
what my heart desires.

723
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:25,250
How can I say no as a father?

724
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,833
But remember one thing...

725
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:32,917
the weapon you give up today,
will be taken up by another tomorrow.

726
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:35,750
And it may be aimed at you.

727
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:43,042
Rubbing salt on your own wounds?

728
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,708
Feels bad, doesn't it?

729
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:55,500
When those closest
to you disappoint?

730
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:59,083
I felt bad too.

731
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,833
I felt terrible.

732
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:32,000
Why have you started
smoking again?

733
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:39,542
Kabeer, I'm talking to you.

734
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:12,167
You are still here?

735
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,208
Haven't you slept all night?

736
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,667
I have found out about all
those who had shot me.

737
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,292
I was slaughtered by
my nearest and dearest...

738
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,542
Nearest and dearest...

739
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,708
Who do you mean?

740
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:08,792
I'm not sad because...

741
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,375
my nearest and
dearest tried to kill me.

742
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:17,542
But I feel disgusted
at the fact that...

743
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,667
they are still...

744
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,958
pretending to care about me.

745
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,708
So...

746
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,208
What...

747
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:30,417
now?

748
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,750
Guru!

749
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,125
Hi!

750
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,292
So, are we going to
the hospital?

751
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:52,667
Let's move!

752
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,333
Whose wife is this?

753
01:13:57,417 --> 01:13:59,250
Hey!

754
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:03,292
Ok! See, this is my wife Iram.

755
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:05,292
This is Ruhi!

756
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,167
And this is my son Melih!

757
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,958
Hello!
- Melih say hi!

758
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:11,375
Guru uncle!

759
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:13,167
So, you girls stay here.

760
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,000
And you come with
me to the hospital.

761
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,167
I will go too.

762
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:17,792
It's fine you don't need to-

763
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:20,542
No, I want to go.
Let me get my bag.

764
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:21,625
Ok.

765
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:29,917
Ruhi sit here.
I'll be right back.

766
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,583
I'm going with him.

767
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,750
Kabeer!

768
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:28,667
Ruhi!

769
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:29,917
Guru!

770
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:39,083
Our baby!

771
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:45,042
Our child Kabeer!

772
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:21,875
I thought I'd tell you
everything last night...

773
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,917
You were right Ruhi.
They haven't spared me.

774
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,708
Not even my child...

775
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:43,000
Then why should I spare them?

776
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,625
Let it be Kabeer. You don't
want to return to that world.

777
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,833
You don't want to fight.
So let it be Kabeer!

778
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:53,792
Call me Guru!

779
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,958
Gangster Guru!

780
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:58,917
No one can stop this fight.

781
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:02,125
Now they will face my wrath!

782
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,917
I promise.

783
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:08,833
Kabeer!

784
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,708
Get out Guti!
This is my fight.

785
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:27,042
And I have lost
everything already.

786
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:30,125
But you have a family.
So go...

787
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,750
You've gone mad!

788
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:32,708
You haven't lost everything!

789
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:36,458
Your child is gone.
But what about your wife?

790
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:39,500
She's still there!
Isn't she?

791
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:44,125
How can you tell me to leave?

792
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:47,417
Friendship is greater than
all your love and marriage.

793
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,500
You think things have
changed in a year?

794
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,125
Listen carefully, I am
going with you!

795
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,500
Guti leave!
- No I won't!

796
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:58,417
Saying the same
thing over and over...

797
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,083
See you.

798
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,125
Then do one thing...

799
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,583
Take care of Ruhi.

800
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,208
And yourself too.

801
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,875
My brother!

802
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,958
Where are you going?

803
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,250
To war!

804
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,958
And I have a lack
of time and patience!

805
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:31,625
Where is Guru?
- I don't know.

806
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,542
Why are you sending
him to a certain death!

807
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,500
You know that he
will not return alive!

808
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,583
My baby was right here.

809
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,833
Kabeer's child!

810
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:53,167
My child is not here anymore.

811
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:56,583
My baby has been
murdered by them!

812
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:59,542
Now I can't stop him.

813
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,875
No one can!

814
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,708
You know who tried to kill Guru!

815
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,083
Guru knows it too.

816
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,708
Who tried to kill Guru?

817
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:08,708
Jamwal?

818
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:09,667
Tommy?

819
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,750
Who was it Ruhi?
Tell me!

820
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:13,125
Please!

821
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:15,750
Please!

822
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:12,083
We should have
been celebrating now.

823
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,500
At this time Ruhi and
I would have been...

824
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:18,583
She would have liked
something sour at this time...

825
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:22,750
And I would have made it for her...

826
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:25,417
I would have made her something...

827
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,333
Here. Eat this.

828
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,208
I cook pretty well now.

829
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:34,833
Ruhi loves my cooking.

830
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:40,708
Does she really like it or
maybe she...

831
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:51,042
Ruhi is the only one...

832
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:54,083
who has ever seen
any good in me.

833
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:58,875
My sins grow deeper
than the ocean.

834
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:04,042
Maybe that's why
I've lost everything.

835
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:08,000
See that chair?

836
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,625
It should not be empty.

837
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,625
He is making me pay for my sins.

838
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,458
Don't be scared. It's
my nearest and dearest.

839
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:35,167
Guti I had told you
not to get her here!

840
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,500
She's not safe here!
There's a great risk!

841
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:39,375
I tried to stop her but...

842
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,250
I insisted!

843
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:45,333
I can't live without you Kabeer!

844
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,500
Let there be fear and risk!

845
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,167
Who knows...

846
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,667
how much time...

847
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,667
you have.

848
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,125
Or I have.

849
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:02,000
But no matter what...

850
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,375
I want to be with you!

851
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:09,167
I can't live without you!

852
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,958
I won't go anywhere!

853
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:23,083
Sometimes to get closer
we need to go far away!

854
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:25,250
I won't listen to a word!

855
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,417
You will listen to me!

856
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:30,167
I want to be with you!

857
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:35,583
What will you do
when I am no more?

858
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:39,750
You should get used
to living without me...

859
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,750
Will you be able to
live without me?

860
01:22:55,792 --> 01:22:58,625
So much love is not good Ruhi.

861
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,167
Coz love makes mistakes.

862
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:08,417
Hey Guti! Go home.

863
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,167
Your wife and child
must be missing you.

864
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,583
No! It's ok.

865
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,667
Just go!

866
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:16,750
Go.

867
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,917
Leave if you want,

868
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:49,500
Forget me if you wish,

869
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,750
Promise me if you please,

870
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,625
That you shall never let me go...

871
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:06,750
Leave if you want,

872
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:09,333
Forget me if you wish,

873
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,583
Promise me if you please,

874
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,458
That you shall never let me go...

875
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,375
The sunrise with
you next to me...

876
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,167
Is all I want.

877
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:29,667
It was the scent of your hair
that brought me back from the dead.

878
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:34,042
I am alive because of your love.

879
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,625
Don't you ever think...

880
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:22,833
that it would have been
better if you had never met me.

881
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:30,625
Your entry in my life was
a huge turning point.

882
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:36,292
I hope you know that.

883
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:43,375
Meeting a gangster can be a
turning point in anyone's life.

884
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:48,500
You know what your mistake was?

885
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:51,583
You decided to start
a family with him.

886
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:59,333
I will tell you everything...

887
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,250
Come become...

888
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,083
my beginning...

889
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:09,958
and my end.

890
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:14,583
The sunrise with
you next to me...

891
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:19,375
Is all I want.

892
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:24,500
To sleep beside you...

893
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:29,292
Is all I want.

894
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:43,750
Kabeer!

895
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:35,333
Your name brings peace...

896
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,417
To my heart.

897
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:45,125
With you I want to spend...

898
01:27:45,417 --> 01:27:48,792
All my days.

899
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:57,375
A red rose in your hand...

900
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:08,917
Heals my every wound.

901
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:13,333
The sunrise with
you next to me...

902
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:18,125
Is all I want.

903
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:23,167
To sleep beside you...

904
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:27,958
Is all I want.

905
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,000
Leave if you want,

906
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,583
Forget me if you wish,

907
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:14,833
Promise me if you please,

908
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,708
That you shall never let me go...

909
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:22,625
The sunrise with
you next to me...

910
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,417
Is all I want.

911
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:32,500
To sleep beside you...

912
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:37,292
Is all I want.

913
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,958
Guru I haven't done anything!

914
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,125
Why my child?

915
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,292
You are making a mistake...

916
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,417
You could have killed me,
but why my child?

917
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:39,625
Child?

918
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,875
Guru listen to me...

919
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,708
Why did you kill my child?

920
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,250
Guru!

921
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,375
Guru listen to me...

922
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,167
Why the child?

923
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:10,583
Why did you do it? Why?

924
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:32,708
Guru, he's dead.

925
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:33,875
Guru let him go...

926
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:36,500
Guru...

927
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:05,042
I have lived with
regret all my life...

928
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:05,958
Yes, my son...

929
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:09,500
I wish you had never
turned me in to Guru.

930
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:12,917
But now it is your
turn to regret.

931
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:18,042
You will regret transforming
me from Kabeer to Guru.

932
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:20,458
With the time that you have...

933
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,292
The time you have left to live...

934
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:27,083
you should figure out if there
is anything you haven't taught me.

935
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:31,208
Something that can
save you from me.

936
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,625
You made a mistake, Baba.

937
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:36,958
You made a big mistake.

938
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,375
Why isn't the AC working?
- It is boss.

939
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,375
Then why am I sweating?

940
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,125
You got this idiot? What
will he do alone?

941
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:57,125
He's useful boss. Him and
his partner will get the job done.

942
01:32:57,292 --> 01:33:00,667
Then tell him to do something.

943
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:06,875
Or else, who knows what
Guru will do with me.

944
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,875
Hurry it up a bit.
- Hmm.

945
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,333
I'm done.

946
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:36,833
Let's go.

947
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:47,833
Sorry...

948
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,792
Ruhi leave.

949
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,083
I can't leave you.

950
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:57,208
I am ordering you to go!

951
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:00,208
I won't go!
- Go! Please go!

952
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:03,458
Guru?

953
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:07,417
Have you ever seen
Salman Khan up close?

954
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:08,792
You haven't.

955
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,375
Ever seen Amitabh
Bachchan from afar?

956
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:14,625
Haven't seen him either.

957
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,875
So how can you think that a
man like Guru will show himself to you?

958
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:31,458
Kabeer! Guti!

959
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:03,167
Guti...

960
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,250
Get up if you're alive.

961
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,417
Guti, my brother...

962
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:11,292
Get up if you're alive!

963
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,250
Don't fool around!

964
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,708
Guti... Hey Guti...

965
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,917
Guti!

966
01:36:01,167 --> 01:36:02,958
Tommy!

967
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:04,917
Tommy!

968
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:15,667
Where is Tommy?
Tell me!

969
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,125
You'll be killed like your friend!

970
01:36:19,917 --> 01:36:20,958
Guru!

971
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:50,458
Where is Tommy?
Tell me!

972
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:52,708
With your wife...

973
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:07,750
Guru?

974
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:12,750
Bhabi Ji (Sister-in-law)!

975
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:17,375
You are shutting the door
on me like I'm a stranger.

976
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:20,167
Let me remind you of who I am.

977
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:25,875
About a month back Guru
was shot at by 5 people.

978
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:29,917
Jason, Chotu, Jamwal and me.

979
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:33,958
You must be wondering
why I'm telling you this.

980
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:38,542
Because Guru doesn't know...

981
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:42,125
that the fifth person was...

982
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,000
his wife!

983
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,333
Business is all
about give and take.

984
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,833
So I will give Guru information...

985
01:38:53,917 --> 01:38:56,500
and in exchange he
will give me my life.

986
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,208
That's Guru's style.

987
01:38:59,417 --> 01:39:03,917
To play with his heart one
must really use their brains.

988
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:06,542
Ofcourse you know it best.

989
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:10,292
That's how you've come this far.

990
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:14,750
What do you think?

991
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:17,083
Think I'll let you go?

992
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:18,000
You think?

993
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:22,208
I shot my own husband.
You think I'll spare you?

994
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:27,250
Just kill Guru and
we can all live.

995
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:29,208
You want me to kill Guru?

996
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:30,792
Why should I kill him?

997
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:34,875
Guru is doing exactly
what I want him to do.

998
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:39,250
He's killing everyone
I want to kill.

999
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:45,375
And you think I'll let
you spoil the game now?

1000
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,750
You think I'll let you ruin it?

1001
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:26,208
Ruhi open the door!

1002
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,875
Kabeer...

1003
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:56,292
He came to kill me Kabeer...

1004
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,542
My heart! Where
do you want to go?

1005
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:15,458
Where shall you find peace?

1006
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:31,875
My heart! Where
do you want to go?

1007
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:37,083
Where shall you find peace?

1008
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:41,625
My heart! Where
do you want to go?

1009
01:42:41,708 --> 01:42:44,292
Where shall you find peace?

1010
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:47,000
My heart! Where
do you want to go?

1011
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:49,667
Where shall you find peace?

1012
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,750
In the end when you stare...

1013
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:55,417
You'll see the tree
of life is bare.

1014
01:42:57,208 --> 01:43:00,792
The tree of life is bare.

1015
01:43:02,542 --> 01:43:06,125
The tree of life is bare.

1016
01:43:07,792 --> 01:43:11,375
The tree of life is bare.

1017
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:18,583
Stop it now.

1018
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:21,750
You have lost a
friend and a child.

1019
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,375
Now let me stand by you.

1020
01:43:24,667 --> 01:43:26,208
Very well!

1021
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:31,250
Then arrest them
before I kill them.

1022
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,708
Can you do that?

1023
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:51,417
Kabeer?

1024
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:10,500
Where are you going?

1025
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:14,833
Kabeer, I'm talking to you!
Where are you going?

1026
01:44:15,042 --> 01:44:17,542
Kabeer!

1027
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:30,875
The lake of the heart
has been soiled,

1028
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:37,167
And this crazy heart
took the dirt for gold.

1029
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:44,583
You were getting
irritated, weren't you?

1030
01:44:45,167 --> 01:44:50,250
You were anxious for your
profit and your partner.

1031
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:56,250
So here, after a year, your
partner has returned.

1032
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:57,542
Guru is back!

1033
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:03,542
I have got all the money
made from my sins.

1034
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:05,792
Keep it all!

1035
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:10,833
Even if there is no partnership,
you will get your share.

1036
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,208
The lake of the heart
has been soiled,

1037
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:21,167
And this crazy heart
took the dirt for gold.

1038
01:45:21,292 --> 01:45:24,583
He doesn't appreciate my Sajda.

1039
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,000
Kabeer?

1040
01:45:27,042 --> 01:45:30,417
What is this poisoned game?

1041
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:35,750
Immortality masked in pain.

1042
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:40,250
What is this poisoned game?

1043
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:42,917
Immortality masked in pain.

1044
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,583
What is this poisoned game?

1045
01:45:45,667 --> 01:45:48,250
Immortality masked in pain.

1046
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:50,417
If you stop and stare...

1047
01:45:50,458 --> 01:45:53,583
You'll see the tree of life is bare.

1048
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:58,875
You'll see the tree of life is bare.

1049
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:04,333
You'll see the tree of life is bare.

1050
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:09,583
You'll see the tree of life is bare.

1051
01:46:36,292 --> 01:46:41,500
You have caught a
snail with your bait,

1052
01:46:41,667 --> 01:46:47,292
It is not a snail but
a snake you have kept,

1053
01:46:52,375 --> 01:46:57,583
You have caught a
snail with your bait,

1054
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:03,375
It is not a snail but
a snake you have kept,

1055
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:12,292
My heart, tell me the truth...

1056
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:17,542
What shall you live for?

1057
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:21,625
My heart, tell me the truth...

1058
01:47:21,708 --> 01:47:24,208
What shall you live for?

1059
01:47:24,292 --> 01:47:26,958
My heart, tell me the truth...

1060
01:47:27,042 --> 01:47:29,542
What shall you live for?

1061
01:47:29,667 --> 01:47:31,708
If you stop and stare,

1062
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:35,250
You'll see the tree
of life is bare.

1063
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:40,542
You'll see the tree
of life is bare.

1064
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:45,875
You'll see the tree
of life is bare.

1065
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:51,250
You'll see the tree
of life is bare.

1066
01:48:02,042 --> 01:48:04,167
What are you doing here?

1067
01:48:05,667 --> 01:48:07,833
I had come to dump a body.

1068
01:48:12,583 --> 01:48:16,250
You made a fool of me
by leaving your car here.

1069
01:48:25,167 --> 01:48:29,958
Take your phone on your way out.
I think the battery is dead.

1070
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:31,583
Who is next?

1071
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,083
If you see that one
of them is missing...

1072
01:48:34,292 --> 01:48:36,292
Use your powers of assumption.

1073
01:48:36,417 --> 01:48:38,792
God speed.

1074
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:56,333
Do you want to kill me?

1075
01:48:57,167 --> 01:48:59,958
No...

1076
01:49:01,542 --> 01:49:04,792
I thought it was someone else.

1077
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,625
No one else will come.

1078
01:49:11,292 --> 01:49:14,042
Today is the last
day of this game.

1079
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:20,625
Are you hurt, Kabeer?

1080
01:49:20,792 --> 01:49:23,708
I'm ok.

1081
01:49:37,125 --> 01:49:40,333
Jason is dead.
Now just one more.

1082
01:49:40,917 --> 01:49:43,375
Just one more...

1083
01:49:47,792 --> 01:49:49,542
What's wrong Ruhi?

1084
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:52,708
Why are you getting scared?

1085
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:55,125
Don't worry.

1086
01:49:55,208 --> 01:49:57,500
Nothing will happen to me.

1087
01:49:57,667 --> 01:50:00,292
I won't go away without
meeting you first.

1088
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:02,500
I promised you, didn't I?

1089
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:06,625
I will take revenge, just
like I had promised.

1090
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:12,167
I'll finish them all and then...

1091
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:22,750
I never thought...

1092
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:28,542
I'd see a day like this after
you came in to my life.

1093
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:33,208
You made me Kabeer again.

1094
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:37,500
Where has this life taken us?

1095
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:40,583
See you.

1096
01:50:41,208 --> 01:50:43,250
Stay safe.

1097
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:08,542
Baba!

1098
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:12,458
Baba!

1099
01:51:16,625 --> 01:51:17,958
Baba!

1100
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:20,750
Jamwal! Shit!

1101
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:34,875
You had lied to me.

1102
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:41,583
You said that you didn't know
who attacked Guru. That's a lie.

1103
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:47,208
You also know who Guru
is going to kill and when.

1104
01:51:47,375 --> 01:51:51,708
You were with Guti when
he was murdered, right?

1105
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:57,042
When I said Guru knows who shot him,
you weren't amazed because...

1106
01:51:57,125 --> 01:52:00,375
you knew who had shot him.

1107
01:52:00,417 --> 01:52:05,167
No, no. I don't have
time for your games.

1108
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:08,292
One by one, people are disappearing.

1109
01:52:08,458 --> 01:52:09,375
Chotu!

1110
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:10,458
Tommy!

1111
01:52:10,542 --> 01:52:12,417
Jason! Whose next?

1112
01:52:33,917 --> 01:52:35,417
You know it all. Tell me!

1113
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:37,750
You know who tried
to kill Guru. Tell me!

1114
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:41,250
I don't know who those
5 people were! I don't!

1115
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:49,625
I never said that
there were 5 people.

1116
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,667
Baba!

1117
01:53:31,417 --> 01:53:32,917
Hold!

1118
01:53:45,917 --> 01:53:48,042
What did you think?

1119
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:50,917
Only you feel pain?

1120
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,583
What about me?

1121
01:53:54,083 --> 01:53:57,708
I thought of you as
my son. I spent my entire life...

1122
01:53:58,208 --> 01:54:00,750
in transforming you
from Kabeer to Guru.

1123
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,542
It was a mistake!
A big mistake!

1124
01:54:03,708 --> 01:54:05,833
The other day you were asking...

1125
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:10,708
if there was anything
that could save me from you.

1126
01:54:11,542 --> 01:54:13,083
Emotion!

1127
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:14,417
Emotion!

1128
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:17,125
I have killed my emotions.

1129
01:54:17,375 --> 01:54:20,000
But you haven't
killed yours yet.

1130
01:54:22,458 --> 01:54:23,833
My dear boys...

1131
01:54:24,083 --> 01:54:25,250
Listen...

1132
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:31,458
Beat my son until he's dead.

1133
01:54:34,375 --> 01:54:35,625
Go!

1134
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:56,125
Tap Ruhi's phone immediately.

1135
01:54:56,417 --> 01:54:57,833
I need some information.

1136
01:55:12,417 --> 01:55:13,875
That's Jamwal's number?

1137
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,750
Ruhi and Jamwal?

1138
01:55:19,208 --> 01:55:20,833
Shit!

1139
01:55:21,167 --> 01:55:23,917
My dear boys,
remember one thing...

1140
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:28,167
He never left a trace
of his victims.

1141
01:55:28,333 --> 01:55:32,542
Make sure the same
is done with him.

1142
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:01,458
Kabeer?

1143
01:56:02,542 --> 01:56:04,917
You know what your mistake was?

1144
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,167
You measured your
relationships with your heart.

1145
01:56:08,417 --> 01:56:10,583
And they used their brains.

1146
01:56:10,708 --> 01:56:14,000
These relationships, this life...

1147
01:56:14,917 --> 01:56:17,708
were all supposed
to end one day.

1148
01:56:18,375 --> 01:56:19,958
Let it be...

1149
01:56:21,083 --> 01:56:23,208
We shall meet again...

1150
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:25,042
Somewhere else.

1151
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:27,667
In another place.

1152
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:46,042
This bag was left near
the donation box.

1153
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:55,792
Allah!

1154
01:56:57,875 --> 01:57:00,125
Help him!

1155
01:57:07,375 --> 01:57:11,250
Don't worry. Nothing
will happen to me.

1156
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:17,042
I won't go away without
meeting you first.

1157
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,417
It's a bad time for you, Baba.

1158
01:58:33,333 --> 01:58:37,250
You are shocked to
see me alive, aren't you?

1159
01:58:37,667 --> 01:58:40,292
You were right.

1160
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:42,500
I couldn't kill my emotions.

1161
01:58:42,542 --> 01:58:45,167
That's why you are still alive.

1162
01:58:46,542 --> 01:58:47,833
Even now.

1163
01:58:48,917 --> 01:58:51,917
So today let's murder emotion...

1164
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,583
and finish you.

1165
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:10,208
Why Baba?

1166
01:59:10,958 --> 01:59:13,083
Why did you do it?

1167
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:15,542
Why did my nearest and dearest-

1168
01:59:20,458 --> 01:59:22,042
You didn't learn a thing.

1169
01:59:22,083 --> 01:59:23,750
Not one thing!

1170
01:59:23,875 --> 01:59:28,583
You couldn't kill your emotions in 12
years how will you do it in 12 seconds?

1171
01:59:28,958 --> 01:59:31,792
Your hands were still shaking.

1172
01:59:31,958 --> 01:59:34,958
It's a very bad time for you Guru.

1173
01:59:35,542 --> 01:59:38,333
You're right Baba.
I learnt nothing.

1174
01:59:38,417 --> 01:59:41,458
I can't kill my emotions.

1175
01:59:41,708 --> 01:59:46,125
But the things you have
taught me in these 12 years...

1176
01:59:46,292 --> 01:59:49,375
are impossible to forget.

1177
01:59:57,833 --> 01:59:59,875
This is what you taught me.

1178
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:01,500
A small slit.
- A small slit.

1179
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,208
My son!

1180
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:07,917
And game over.

1181
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:30,375
Will Kabeer finish Jamwal...

1182
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:32,042
Or will Jamwal...

1183
02:00:43,042 --> 02:00:44,833
Guru was here.

1184
02:00:45,042 --> 02:00:46,875
For sure.

1185
02:00:46,917 --> 02:00:49,917
That means he will
now go to Ruhi.

1186
02:00:49,958 --> 02:00:53,792
But he won't believe
that Ruhi has done this.

1187
02:00:53,917 --> 02:00:58,167
But why will she
want to kill Guru?

1188
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:04,083
What are you
thinking about Ruhi?

1189
02:01:04,958 --> 02:01:06,458
Kabeer?

1190
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,917
Yes, you are
thinking about Kabeer.

1191
02:01:10,917 --> 02:01:14,375
Who else can she be
thinking about, Amma?

1192
02:01:14,417 --> 02:01:17,042
Kabeer...

1193
02:01:18,083 --> 02:01:19,583
How did this happen?

1194
02:01:19,667 --> 02:01:21,667
I knew you'd be here.

1195
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:24,750
All this blood...
How did this happen?

1196
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:35,542
Come with me.

1197
02:01:35,917 --> 02:01:36,958
Where?

1198
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,125
Today, please don't
ask any questions.

1199
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,958
Do you remember this place?

1200
02:02:40,833 --> 02:02:43,250
This is where we first met.

1201
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:47,500
This is where our story began.

1202
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:50,833
Guru...

1203
02:02:52,208 --> 02:02:54,583
and Ruhi's story.

1204
02:02:56,958 --> 02:02:58,708
What a strange coincidence...

1205
02:02:58,958 --> 02:03:01,333
I was injured on that day...

1206
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:03,625
and I'm injured today aswell.

1207
02:03:04,167 --> 02:03:07,750
You were with me then,
and you are with me now.

1208
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:12,958
It all seems like the same.

1209
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:20,292
No, there's a difference.

1210
02:03:21,292 --> 02:03:27,125
The difference is that you
don't have hiccups anymore.

1211
02:03:27,417 --> 02:03:32,083
My love has quelled it.

1212
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:36,792
There's one more difference.

1213
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:40,667
My injury today...

1214
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:43,167
grows very deep.

1215
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:48,875
Your antiseptic can't cure it.

1216
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:13,792
Ruhi, I am very lucky
to have you in my life.

1217
02:04:14,375 --> 02:04:19,750
You have loved me,
and I have loved you.

1218
02:04:20,417 --> 02:04:27,208
You have transformed me
in to Kabeer, a name I had forgotten.

1219
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:34,125
You have turned a gangster's
crime story in to a love story.

1220
02:04:34,542 --> 02:04:38,583
You made me dream
like a common man.

1221
02:04:38,708 --> 02:04:42,792
I dreamt of a family, a wife...

1222
02:04:43,083 --> 02:04:46,417
and a beautiful child.

1223
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:52,458
But that didn't happen.

1224
02:04:52,542 --> 02:04:56,000
Everything was perfect and
it would have been perfect if...

1225
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:59,375
our story had begun from here.

1226
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:03,500
And not from the point
where I had been shot.

1227
02:05:09,833 --> 02:05:12,042
You made a mistake, Ruhi.

1228
02:05:12,125 --> 02:05:16,792
It would have been good if I
could have forgotten this scar.

1229
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:19,917
This one...

1230
02:05:20,417 --> 02:05:22,833
The one so close to my heart.

1231
02:05:22,958 --> 02:05:25,500
The one that you have given me.

1232
02:05:25,667 --> 02:05:31,292
You could have killed a gangster
but you killed my love instead.

1233
02:05:33,167 --> 02:05:35,542
You made a mistake, Ruhi.

1234
02:05:35,583 --> 02:05:40,333
The scent of your hair
brought me back to life.

1235
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:51,083
I wish you had not
sent me to war.

1236
02:05:51,125 --> 02:05:58,292
But you made me do exactly
what you please without a question.

1237
02:05:58,833 --> 02:06:01,833
You made a mistake, Ruhi.

1238
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:08,625
It would have been perfect
if my love had won.

1239
02:06:09,292 --> 02:06:15,083
The love which never allowed
me to question you.

1240
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:18,625
The love that forced me to
keep my promise to you.

1241
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:24,750
It made me believe that you
would tell me the truth.

1242
02:06:26,417 --> 02:06:33,000
It made me believe that you
would stop me but no...

1243
02:06:33,792 --> 02:06:42,167
I kept waiting for the truth but
it never came. It was a mistake, Ruhi.

1244
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:48,875
I wish you had taken out
your anger on me alone...

1245
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,208
Atleast Guti and my child
would have survived.

1246
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:55,042
But no...

1247
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:59,750
Now they're both gone.
You made a mistake, Ruhi!

1248
02:06:59,917 --> 02:07:04,583
I never saw my child but
my best friend is gone.

1249
02:07:04,875 --> 02:07:09,333
He held friendship
above all else.

1250
02:07:10,667 --> 02:07:17,458
So I should hold friendship
above all else. Shouldn't I?

1251
02:07:17,708 --> 02:07:20,958
So let me pay the
debt of friendship.

1252
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:24,458
Let me quash my love.

1253
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:27,875
Let me take revenge.

1254
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:38,833
Your revenge?

1255
02:07:39,125 --> 02:07:41,458
It is my turn to take revenge.

1256
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:43,167
Are you pained?

1257
02:07:43,625 --> 02:07:48,417
Feeling terrible that I
said nothing before?

1258
02:07:48,458 --> 02:07:52,042
So be it! Today I will
tell you all!

1259
02:07:52,083 --> 02:07:55,333
You took too long...

1260
02:07:55,667 --> 02:07:58,333
to show your real self.

1261
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:06,375
I wanted to see if you
could point a gun at me.

1262
02:08:06,958 --> 02:08:09,958
And you could.

1263
02:08:10,208 --> 02:08:11,875
So be it!

1264
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:15,958
You want to kill me?

1265
02:08:19,917 --> 02:08:22,208
Then finish this story.

1266
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:24,292
Kill me!

1267
02:08:24,458 --> 02:08:27,167
Come on shoot!

1268
02:08:27,292 --> 02:08:31,000
And don't tell me the reason.

1269
02:08:31,083 --> 02:08:34,875
Because you have no right to
say it and I have none to hear it!

1270
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:39,417
None of the dead will come back
and I will never change. So shoot!

1271
02:08:39,458 --> 02:08:43,167
I will! I will shoot!

1272
02:08:43,333 --> 02:08:45,500
I will kill you.

1273
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:51,375
And I do feel bad
about your friend.

1274
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:56,750
I didn't want Guti to die.

1275
02:08:57,250 --> 02:09:02,042
But, your child?

1276
02:09:03,083 --> 02:09:06,750
It has to exist in order to die.

1277
02:09:06,875 --> 02:09:13,417
I made the plan on the day
Guti had got his child to our house.

1278
02:09:14,125 --> 02:09:19,333
The goons, the incident,
it was all a part of my plan.

1279
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:27,167
It was a plan and there
was no child!

1280
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:29,792
How could you stoop so low-

1281
02:09:29,833 --> 02:09:31,625
Feeling bad are you?

1282
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:33,375
Feeling pained?

1283
02:09:33,583 --> 02:09:35,167
Very pained?

1284
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:38,417
This is the pain I
wanted you to feel.

1285
02:09:38,542 --> 02:09:43,708
Jamwal had forced
me to shoot at Kabeer.

1286
02:09:43,958 --> 02:09:48,167
I had always wanted
to see you as Guru.

1287
02:09:48,208 --> 02:09:49,792
From Guru to Kabeer,
Kabeer to Guru.

1288
02:09:49,833 --> 02:09:52,542
I want you to feel pain.

1289
02:09:52,625 --> 02:09:58,167
Because I have felt this
pain for one entire year!

1290
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:02,208
I had died on the very day...

1291
02:10:02,542 --> 02:10:05,125
that you murdered my Vishnu.

1292
02:10:05,792 --> 02:10:07,125
Vishnu?

1293
02:10:08,542 --> 02:10:09,917
Let me remind you.

1294
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,708
Just keep it there.
- Ok!

1295
02:10:22,167 --> 02:10:24,542
Vishnu just take a look...

1296
02:10:30,583 --> 02:10:32,500
Hello, police-

1297
02:10:33,917 --> 02:10:35,542
Vishnu!

1298
02:10:35,667 --> 02:10:38,250
Vishnu!

1299
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:46,792
Don't be sad. Your Vishnu
has died an honorable death.

1300
02:10:47,667 --> 02:10:51,833
He died an honest man...

1301
02:10:56,667 --> 02:11:00,250
Vishnu wake up...

1302
02:11:00,292 --> 02:11:03,667
Get up!

1303
02:11:05,875 --> 02:11:09,833
The scent of blood lingers...

1304
02:11:11,125 --> 02:11:12,583
These are your words.

1305
02:11:12,750 --> 02:11:14,458
Vishnu!

1306
02:11:14,583 --> 02:11:20,542
So how could you believe
that Vishnu's blood will be forgotten?

1307
02:11:22,667 --> 02:11:25,792
My Vishnu was a gangster...

1308
02:11:27,958 --> 02:11:29,958
like you.

1309
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:35,542
My Vishnu had changed for me...

1310
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,250
Just like you.

1311
02:11:41,417 --> 02:11:45,875
My Vishnu loved me...

1312
02:11:47,375 --> 02:11:50,917
The way you do.

1313
02:11:52,042 --> 02:11:56,000
But how did he die?

1314
02:11:56,792 --> 02:12:00,375
He died like a criminal.

1315
02:12:03,875 --> 02:12:07,083
And you will too.

1316
02:12:07,167 --> 02:12:09,500
Oh Ruhi...

1317
02:12:10,333 --> 02:12:15,042
I expected you to
know more about me...

1318
02:12:15,792 --> 02:12:20,042
When Guru kills someone
he never leaves a trace.

1319
02:12:21,333 --> 02:12:25,625
You had Vishnu's body
to cry over, didn't you?

1320
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:37,125
I thought that I alone
was blinded by love but...

1321
02:12:37,333 --> 02:12:40,292
you are worse.

1322
02:12:42,292 --> 02:12:45,458
You befriended those
who killed Vishnu.

1323
02:12:45,667 --> 02:12:48,208
Go away! Go somewhere far away!

1324
02:13:06,375 --> 02:13:07,208
Kabeer...

1325
02:13:07,292 --> 02:13:10,667
But now it's too late.

1326
02:13:10,917 --> 02:13:14,083
It's of no use.

1327
02:13:14,458 --> 02:13:22,000
I did everything for your love and
you say that you don't love me?

1328
02:13:23,542 --> 02:13:27,750
Do you really think
that you don't love me?

1329
02:13:28,458 --> 02:13:32,542
My love is a lie,
if you don't love me.

1330
02:13:32,875 --> 02:13:35,875
My love has lost,
if you don't love me.

1331
02:13:36,042 --> 02:13:37,500
Kabeer.

1332
02:13:38,625 --> 02:13:42,375
If you don't cry,
then you don't love me.

1333
02:13:43,292 --> 02:13:48,167
If you don't feel alone without me,
then you don't love me.

1334
02:13:49,417 --> 02:13:53,625
If you have no hiccups,
then you don't love me.

1335
02:13:55,583 --> 02:13:58,458
But if you love
me even a little...

1336
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:02,833
then your love
will bring me back.

1337
02:14:05,792 --> 02:14:07,958
Kabeer!

1338
02:14:18,083 --> 02:14:20,250
Kabeer!

1339
02:15:05,125 --> 02:15:07,917
In the depths of my heart,

1340
02:15:08,167 --> 02:15:10,958
And with a sleepless mind,

1341
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:16,708
I will drown with you...

1342
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,792
I now have many reasons,

1343
02:15:24,167 --> 02:15:29,375
To discover myself...

1344
02:15:30,542 --> 02:15:36,167
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

1345
02:15:37,125 --> 02:15:42,042
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

1346
02:15:43,583 --> 02:15:49,208
If you want to know the truth,
I want you...

1347
02:15:50,167 --> 02:15:55,083
If you want to believe a lie,
I want you...

1348
02:15:57,083 --> 02:15:59,875
My heart wants to
look back at you...

1349
02:16:01,083 --> 02:16:03,167
And forget everything...

1350
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:06,167
and start afresh.

1351
02:16:06,708 --> 02:16:12,542
But now you will feel pain
when you look in to my eyes.

1352
02:16:13,708 --> 02:16:16,208
That's why I had said...

1353
02:16:16,333 --> 02:16:24,500
When you travel with someone on the
road of life, it is tough to return alone.

1354
02:16:25,125 --> 02:16:27,583
But you have to keep walking.

1355
02:16:27,625 --> 02:16:33,708
Sometimes to come closer,
we need to go far away.
