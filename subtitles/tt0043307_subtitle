00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
HlGH STAKES

2
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,560
ls he here?

3
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,630
He's a good boy.
Why are you after him?

4
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,150
My boss told me to get him.
What can l do?

5
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,600
Don't!

6
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't play or...

7
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,050
you'll be cleaned out.

8
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,240
Your turn.

9
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,079
What a throw!

10
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,070
lt's only luck.

11
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,090
The little kitten, over there,
brings him his luck.

12
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,399
Come here, kitten.

13
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,470
l must take him with me.

14
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,270
Or else the boss
won't forgive me.

15
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,419
How much do we bet?
Five rupees!

16
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,950
- Boss, you're unlucky today.
- Shut up!

17
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,080
Out with the rest.

18
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,700
- Four more rupees.
- l'll pay later.

19
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,480
With me, no credit.

20
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,360
No credit, eh?
You're just a cheat.

21
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,890
Me? A cheat?

22
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,630
Cigarette?

23
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,859
You showed him.

24
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,550
He's always picking a fight.

25
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,020
Why stare? Don't you know me?
l'm your friend, Pedro.

26
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,010
- Move it.
- Weren't you a taxi driver?

27
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,040
Why do you waste time in a
third rate place like this?

28
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,030
There are endless raids here.
Let's go to a swank joint.

29
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,930
l'll knock your teeth out.

30
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,450
Don't you want to work?
l'll get you a job.

31
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,570
- What job?
- l'll introduce you to my boss.

32
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,469
Scared? Do you think
l'll kidnap you or something?

33
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,800
Swear on God,
l'll get you a job.

34
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,969
Where's that little fellow
who calls himself Pedro?

35
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,880
- The guy with a moustache.
- Why make a racket?

36
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,840
- l'm not, you are.
- Pedro's over here.

37
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,770
Boss, your man's here.

38
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,750
Why be shy?

39
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,800
Why be shy? Why turn away?
My beloved, heed me today

40
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,100
Why think of tomorrow?

41
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,250
Let your heart be your guide

42
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,859
Why fret over
the world's sorrow?

43
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,729
Why fear with me
by your side?

44
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,500
Let my eyes cast
a spell on you

45
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,390
Let my arms enfold you

46
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,360
A moment once past
has little worth

47
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,410
Come, let me offer you
paradise on Earth

48
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,720
The net was for me.
You got in the way.

49
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,849
Get me out of here.

50
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,980
She was only teasing. Why are
you so angry? Taxi drivers!

51
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,599
Go with him.
l'll wait for you outside.

52
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,150
ls there an opening?

53
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,960
Be patient.
You'll know soon enough.

54
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,520
Be patient!
l can't be patient!

55
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,160
No alcohol... it's cold coffee.

56
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,410
You look innocent.

57
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,650
Fool.

58
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,939
Pretty boy.

59
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,790
- You look like trouble.
- Thanks very much.

60
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,750
l like you.

61
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,280
l don't like you at all.

62
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,490
- Why not?
- Must l tell you?

63
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,280
You don't like me.
But you're drawn here.

64
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,280
- Who said so?
- Then why are you here?

65
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,790
You won't understand.

66
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,170
Play!

67
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,830
- No cash.
- l'll pay.

68
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,540
- Lose or win, we split.
- l only win.

69
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,530
A winner plays a lone game.

70
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,180
Madan.

71
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,050
So he's the young man?

72
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes sir, he's clean.

73
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,710
How can one trust anyone
completely? Only time will tell.

74
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,459
- Give him a job.
- What's the job?

75
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,560
Make friends with the rich
at the races, at 5-star hotels.

76
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,770
You want to trap them
into gambling.

77
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,590
No one is trapped. Everyone
enjoys gambling. Don't you?

78
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,550
Let me go.

79
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,550
ln fact, business is just...

80
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,540
another name for gambling.

81
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,030
Crooks!
My money! Or l call the police.

82
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,140
l run a clean game.

83
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,630
There's no business
without dishonesty.

84
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,800
The law of nature is that
the big fish eat the small fish.

85
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,339
The strong destroy the weak.

86
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,939
l won't do it.

87
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,950
- Your sister's unwell.
- lt's none of your business

88
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,190
l'll pay you handsomely.

89
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,510
- ls it very painful?
- No.

90
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,470
You're pretending.
Where's aunt?

91
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,120
Out buying medicine.

92
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,240
The cough's been bad.

93
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,220
- Have you found a job?
- No, l haven't.

94
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,270
Aunt says there's a
new doctor, who treats...

95
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,040
poor people for free.

96
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,030
Why go there?
We're not beggars.

97
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,840
Doctor says you're improving.
Why be obliged to anyone?

98
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,520
- Where do you go everyday?
- Looking for work, of course.

99
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,360
Money doesn't fall from the sky.

100
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:51,050
- They say you gamble.
- To hell with what they say.

101
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,080
Don't worry, Manju.
You're very precious to me.

102
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,950
Everybody sees bad times.
We'll face it together.

103
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,410
No one will sympathize with us.

104
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,120
- Liar! Ask anyone.
- Why? l was here first.

105
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,670
l will smack you so hard...

106
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,660
- Why do you quarrel?
- Look at his guts.

107
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,020
Who do you think you are?

108
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,660
What's going on?

109
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,500
Look, he's picking a fight.

110
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,560
- Why?
- My tummy's hurting.

111
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,010
- Liar!
- Shut up!

112
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,629
Madan, look at my ankle,
it's sprained.

113
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,030
Don't crowd this place.
Don't worry, Madam.

114
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,889
Be very careful. These people
are thugs. They carry knives.

115
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,770
lf you have any trouble, call.

116
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,000
The name is Madan and l live...

117
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,840
l can take care of myself.

118
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,450
- Who's the doctor?
- l am.

119
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,090
- Any objection?
- Aren't you a nurse?

120
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,750
You're pretty.
Nurses usually are, but doctors...

121
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,830
Have you anything to add?
Then, please go.

122
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,970
Let me show you something.

123
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,160
Don't be scared. Come on.

124
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,949
Madam, your patients.

125
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,040
- Her tonsils are inflamed.
- What?

126
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,650
He throat is inflamed.

127
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,080
So you'll operate
just because she has a cough?

128
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,980
l didn't say that.

129
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,629
You seem to think
you know everything.

130
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,070
Let's go. She wanted to come
to the new doctor.

131
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,220
Son, she wants to cut
my girl's throat.

132
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,459
No one dares do that
while l am around.

133
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,120
Madam, what kind
of treatment is this?

134
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,550
lf a part of the body is sick,
do you cut it out?

135
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,760
l don't find it very funny.

136
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,580
Neither do we,
someone may lose a life.

137
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
We mend our shoes
if they tear.

138
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,620
lf clothes tear, they're patched.

139
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,149
We don't throw things out
because they're bad.

140
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,890
lmagine cutting
the poor child's throat.

141
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,290
- Aren't l right?
- Of course, you are.

142
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,960
Let her try.

143
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,820
What strange times we live in.

144
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,520
Get him out of here.

145
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,900
What can you expect from people
who need a car to go upstairs?

146
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,060
How can they treat the poor?

147
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,190
How would they know
what poor folk we are?

148
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,670
Our Madam is fine.

149
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,179
Her clothes are simple.
She hasn't eaten all day, l'm sure.

150
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,760
Even if she were to cut the
child's throat, why object?

151
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,600
What's going on?
This is a dispensary.

152
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,630
Does she cure hearts as well?

153
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,150
Sometimes my heart throbs
quite painfully.

154
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,110
Manju has fainted. Hurry!

155
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,430
Poor man, no work for 3 months
and his sister's ill.

156
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,240
Madan and his sister
are so close.

157
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,070
He's a jolly person.

158
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,129
He's a fine man.

159
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,160
You're here.
She's in a terrible state.

160
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,830
The medicine.
Fetch the healer.

161
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,140
He's out, son.
Go and call the new doctor.

162
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,500
What can she do?
She looks a simpleton.

163
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,919
Boil water, at once.

164
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,480
- Why are they standing here?
- They are our people.

165
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,640
Go away.

166
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,590
Open the window.

167
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,750
Don't keep standing there.
Do as l say.

168
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,070
She's in a bad way.

169
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,389
- Boil some water
- Thank God she's here.

170
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,930
Fetch the injection.
Get it from wherever you can.

171
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,920
l need it at once.

172
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,950
Out of stock, try the chemist.

173
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,629
That'll be 25 rupees.
Pay up or leave it.

174
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,470
Can l pay the balance later?

175
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,429
No charity here.

176
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,080
My sister may die.

177
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,870
What can l do? Pay up first.

178
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,520
l need 20 rupees to buy
medicine or she will die.

179
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,080
- Who?
- My sister.

180
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,200
l have no money.

181
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,330
Why waste time, Madan?

182
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,860
Come and play.

183
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,970
Lend me 20 rupees, for God's sake.
l'll always remember it.

184
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,280
Come and play one round...

185
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,040
and make 20 rupees, if you're lucky.

186
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,790
Not now. Please loan me the
money. l'll return 50, even 100.

187
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,420
l don't lend money.

188
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,950
lf you win, you'll get it.

189
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,750
Shuffle the cards.

190
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,660
l'll bet two rupees.

191
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,160
lf you win once,
l'll win a hundred times.

192
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,320
Play.

193
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,560
Stake your scarf?

194
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,830
Deal.

195
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,600
lt's gold.

196
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,670
Wait!

197
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,970
Twenty!

198
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,959
Here's the injection.

199
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,330
l'll go now.
She's out of danger.

200
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:37,070
Aunt, l'll see her home.
Look after Manju.

201
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,610
l'll never forget
what you've done for us.

202
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,280
What would've happened
if you weren't here?

203
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,010
Why feel obliged?
l'm a doctor, it's my duty.

204
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,730
Who understands duty nowadays?

205
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,550
l behaved badly.
l'm sorry l misbehaved.

206
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,399
Never mind.

207
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,070
Believe me,
l'm not a bad person.

208
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,030
- You live very far.
- Maybe we can catch a bus.

209
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,670
How are you?

210
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,380
- Where to?
- l'm going home.

211
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,740
Get out, l want to borrow
your taxi. l'll return it.

212
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,930
- What's up?
- Do me a favor, chum.

213
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,670
Who else would l help?

214
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,170
Get the car back
to the garage by midnight.

215
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,649
- Do you drive a taxi?
- l used to.

216
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,780
- Yes, my patients said...
- What did they say?

217
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,310
You're out of work.

218
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,590
Did l offend you?

219
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:12,089
No, l just remembered
that you once sat in my taxi.

220
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,430
There was a man
in uniform with you.

221
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,780
He gave you a watch.

222
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,830
That's right. Ramesh gave me
a wristwatch for my birthday.

223
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,500
Good memory.

224
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,510
Cabbies keep an eye on the road,
and an ear to the back seat.

225
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,570
l've been wondering where l've
seen you. l remember your voice.

226
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,650
- Strange!
- There are stranger people yet.

227
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,650
- Who's Mr. Ramesh, may l ask?
- A childhood friend.

228
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,070
- He's a police inspector.
- Good God! Double trouble.

229
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,319
l forgot, there's a party tonight.
Father will be angry.

230
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,970
- l'm sorry, it's my fault.
- Never mind.

231
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:24,620
l don't like parties anyway.
l don't feel like going in.

232
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,210
l'm very happy,
l've saved a life today.

233
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,030
Mustn't l be happy?

234
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,500
Can l ask you something?
Will you answer?

235
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,860
l'm sure you and your sister
have seen better days, right?

236
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,620
You'll be late for the party.

237
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,240
You haven't answered me.

238
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,140
Will it make a difference?

239
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,080
So l was right?

240
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,230
Maybe.

241
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,810
Just a minute.
You forgot your bag.

242
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,900
- Why don't you come in?
- That's impossible.

243
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,780
Why look so worried, Ramesh?
Rajni must be on her way.

244
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,560
Yes, yes... what's that
in your hand?

245
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,899
Delicious!

246
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,830
When's your party?
You promised.

247
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,680
Rajni must've had to tend
to a patient. She'll be back.

248
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,100
She's just like you.

249
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,270
So concerned with the poor.

250
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,170
l was surprised when she
opened a free dispensary.

251
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,720
l thought she'd open
a practice abroad.

252
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:09,779
- May l fetch Rajni?
- Why? She'll be back.

253
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,089
l don't understand why you let
her work in that terrible place.

254
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,830
She doesn't listen.
Try telling her.

255
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,860
Who is the one...

256
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,320
whose presence has brought
Spring to my life?

257
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:30,500
All of a sudden l feel
as though l belong to someone

258
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:39,650
l know not if he belongs
to me or to another

259
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:50,170
His presence makes
my heart tremble with joy

260
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:12,460
The desires of youth come alive
and soar with such joy

261
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:21,410
Whose presence makes
my eyes sparkle and smile?

262
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:32,169
Whose embrace enfolds
my flowing hair?

263
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,100
- Why don't you lie down?
- l don't need to, l'm fine.

264
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,240
She's cured you so quickly.
And she visits you every day.

265
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,810
Why not?
She's Madan's friend after all.

266
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,020
You'll see, she'll be my
sister-in-law one day.

267
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,479
You're both mad.
l'm off to the market.

268
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,779
Why don't you rest?

269
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,730
- Of course l do.
- Liar!

270
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,000
- What is this?
- Something to eat.

271
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,950
Why did you do that?
Madan gets very angry.

272
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,670
Why should he?

273
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,299
l have fever only at nights.

274
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,390
Anyway, let's see.

275
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,950
l beg your pardon.

276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,080
Here are your clothes.
l'll turn the other way.

277
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,360
Madan, may l say something?

278
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,710
Nothing.

279
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,529
Where's Manju?

280
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,819
She's making tea.

281
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,160
So, she's started doing chores?

282
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,530
Chores? Making tea?

283
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,279
- Follow my advice.
- She's all right.

284
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,800
You don't understand.

285
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,490
- She has T.B.
- T.B.?

286
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:10,950
l didn't want to scare you,
but you should know the truth.

287
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,260
ls that the truth?

288
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,370
But she's not in danger
for the moment.

289
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,200
Send her away from the city
to a sanatorium.

290
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,100
How?
l have no money to do that.

291
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,870
lf you permit,
l can arrange everything.

292
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,600
- Why should you?
- Because it's easy for me.

293
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,640
You say that because you
have money, you're rich.

294
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,190
No, because l like Manju
and l want to save her.

295
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,980
She's my responsibility,
not your's.

296
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,390
Don't misunderstand me.

297
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,230
l can't accept all you say.
Because l'm down and out...

298
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,380
l won't accept charity.
l have some self respect.

299
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,549
Have your tea.
What happened?

300
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,980
Nothing. l'll drink the tea.

301
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:38,759
l swear!

302
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,160
What luck!

303
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,580
lt's as if fortune
is playing with the player.

304
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,460
Transform your misfortune
into good fortune

305
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,400
Trust in yourself
and throw the dice

306
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,030
Why worry about
what the world might say?

307
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,450
Justice is on your side.
Take up the challenge today

308
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,420
Trust in yourself
and throw the dice

309
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,610
Life is worth little
if you live in isolation

310
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,910
Surrender yourself to love.
Save another from rejection

311
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,820
Trust in yourself
and throw the dice

312
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:24,609
lt matters little if
the oars of the boat be broken

313
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,180
Use your strength to row
the boat to its destination

314
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:40,160
Trust in yourself
and throw the dice

315
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,440
Take me to the boss.
l'm ready to work for him.

316
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:23,080
The Star Club, You've been
on the case for 2 months.

317
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,910
You've been raiding the place.
What's the result? Nothing.

318
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:33,330
- lnspector, we'll raid again.
- Why?

319
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,560
You've raided it twice.
Did you find anything? No!

320
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:44,509
l want some evidence. Proof!
Without that, it's useless.

321
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,040
- Number 5's report, sir.
- Get him.

322
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,810
A new man, Madan, has been
employed at the club.

323
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:17,940
So a new man has been hired?
So what? How does that matter?

324
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,410
Does knowing that help us?

325
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,680
We've got to find out
who runs the place.

326
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,900
ls that so hard? Nonsense!

327
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,910
Why are you dressed like that?

328
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,640
l've followed your advice
and sent Manju to a sanatorium.

329
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:56,090
Do you like the suit?
What do you think of it?

330
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,680
- lt's nice.
- l agree.

331
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,660
Young college girls have been...

332
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,879
staring at me in admiration.

333
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,750
lt's a strange age.

334
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:17,440
lf you wear fine clothes,
you command respect at once.

335
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,290
Where did you find the money?

336
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:27,820
l was sitting on a bench
in the park when suddenly...

337
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:35,060
there was a downpour of notes.
So l gathered a few.

338
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,810
You're angry with me
and you've done something rash.

339
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,600
You've put yourself in danger.

340
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,900
lt's not too late.
Tell me everything.

341
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,040
You don't believe me?

342
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,500
l see you're upset because
l look like your equal now.

343
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,890
You like to see me in ragged clothes
so you can pity me.

344
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,670
So you can help me.

345
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,770
Get out!

346
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,779
Sorry, l wasted your time.

347
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:52,049
You're right Ramesh, l had no right
to interfere in his life.

348
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,610
lt was foolish of me.

349
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,500
You're foolish to get
so upset over nothing.

350
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,550
lf you get so upset over
each patient, it won't do.

351
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:14,520
You don't understand Ramesh.
This is my first defeat.

352
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,500
Defeat's not for you.

353
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:21,620
Because you are
a millionaire's child. Anyway...

354
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,790
you'll be okay if we go out.

355
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,000
l don't feel like it.

356
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,100
Don't be so naive. People like
him will do anything for money.

357
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,730
- He may be a thief.
- Ramesh!

358
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,560
For God's sake,
don't talk like that.

359
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,970
You're done for.

360
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,350
Why are you puffing away
like a steam engine?

361
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,450
Are you in love?

362
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,060
Love, passion, amour, liebe...

363
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,060
Maybe you're right.
l don't understand women.

364
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,780
What's your opinion?

365
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,250
- You're pulling my leg.
- l'm not.

366
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,990
Saints, philosophers,
no one understands women.

367
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,330
Women don't understand either.

368
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,120
And you ask me! Some joke!

369
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,890
l'll tell you something,
be firm with women.

370
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,590
lf you fall in love,
be like me. Firm.

371
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,730
Pedro, Sher Singh wants you.

372
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,130
Always at the wrong moment.

373
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,279
Where are you going?
No one called you.

374
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,270
Why avoid me? Are you scared?

375
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,180
l won't eat you up.

376
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,460
- What is it?
- Nothing.

377
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:14,200
l have no attachment to any of you.
l'm here for the money.

378
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,270
That's all.

379
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,240
When l've got what l want,
l'll be off.

380
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,350
That's what l used
to think as well.

381
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,430
Have you made enough?

382
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,650
- Yes.
- How much?

383
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,120
- Plenty.
- Why don't you leave then?

384
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,950
That's what l mean. lt's easy
to come in but hard to leave.

385
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,550
Nice place, eh?

386
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,649
- Pardon?
- Answer my question.

387
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,310
Which one?

388
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,690
- The one l asked.
- What did you ask?

389
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,770
What's the matter with you?
l wonder where your mind is.

390
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,410
Stop teasing.

391
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:25,090
Don't tease! That's all
l've been hearing for years.

392
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,509
- Can't you say anything else?
- l couldn't ever.

393
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,790
You never say the words
l want to hear.

394
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,210
'l love you', say it once.

395
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,360
Who's he?

396
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,210
Who's she?

397
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,480
- Who's he?
- He's the one.

398
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,069
l've seen that girl before.
She looks like a tramp.

399
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,160
What are you up to? Rajni?

400
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:48,190
l want to talk to you.
lt's very important.

401
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Where are we going, may l ask?

402
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,049
Get in.

403
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,090
Even if you don't
value your life, l do.

404
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,830
That's why you're ruining it.

405
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,300
lmagine being seen
with a tramp.

406
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,580
l thought you decent.

407
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,810
Tramp? Who? Nina?

408
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,870
l don't know that hussy's name.

409
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,800
Not a word against her.

410
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:57,520
l respected you a lot. l never
thought you'd fall so low.

411
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:04,770
You're good at lectures.
Starve a little, then we'll see.

412
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:17,670
That's an old story.

413
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,080
l was hungry, l sinned.
l was forced to do it.

414
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:29,590
- What about one's character?
- l don't have one.

415
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:35,400
Do you know what l do?
l turn people into gamblers.

416
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:41,430
l take them to our club
where they are doomed to lose.

417
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:47,520
Bravo! You think you're making
a great sacrifice for Manju.

418
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:53,160
lt's all a pretense. Do you
have the guts to tell her...

419
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,020
you don't like honest work?

420
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,760
You want to have a good time,
never mind how.

421
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,150
Forgive me.

422
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,480
You don't understand.

423
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,620
Oh beloved, just for tonight...

424
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:43,140
Heed me my love,
don't break my heart

425
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:47,299
l've come to you to reveal
the secrets in my heart

426
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:22,650
My eyes are filled
with sweet dreams

427
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,000
l've come to make you my own

428
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,640
Don't leave me,
don't turn away

429
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,350
The moon and stars...

430
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,830
shine above you

431
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,040
They bear witness
as you grieve me

432
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,270
With your sweet looks
you break my heart

433
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:02,930
Once you've held my hand,
don't let it go

434
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:33,180
- Ramesh, where's Rajni?
- Still out.

435
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,160
Was she with you?

436
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,600
Yes, but she met a friend
and she left with him.

437
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:46,780
- A friend?
- Her patient's brother.

438
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:53,880
She'll be back soon.
l'll go now.

439
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,270
l'm going.

440
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,750
l'm going to see
Manju tomorrow. Coming?

441
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,870
Tomorrow?

442
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,140
- You look happy.
- lt's a special day.

443
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,730
- Where did you disappear to?
- Don't ask.

444
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:38,339
- lnstead, let my heart ask.
- What are you saying?

445
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:10,819
- Who is he?
- Probably a new victim.

446
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,630
Let's not change the subject.
Who did you meet?

447
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,860
Time for the show.

448
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:57,390
Why so many presents?
Manju has everything she needs.

449
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,060
l told you to hire
a porter from the station.

450
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,460
- l don't like porters.
- Arguing again.

451
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,250
l still have one free hand.

452
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:47,819
The arrangements are good.

453
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,990
Thank you, sir.
This is the girl.

454
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,880
What's your name?

455
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:05,190
- Rajni comes here, doesn't she?
- Not for some time.

456
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,170
Madan said he'd bring her over.

457
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,490
- Father!
- ls that your father?

458
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:25,290
- Why are you here?
- Oh, some business.

459
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,780
- This is Manju's brother.
- l see.

460
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,360
Glad to meet you.
May we visit the grounds?

461
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,110
Rajni, you came by train?
Travel back with me.

462
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,180
You too.

463
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:48,800
- Why haven't you visited?
- Ask him.

464
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,870
Sit down.
Do you still fight?

465
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:57,400
Look what we've brought.

466
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:12,660
Are you self employed
or working for a firm?

467
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,060
How beautiful this place is.

468
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:22,860
Yes, it is indeed.

469
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,349
Don't you live near
Rajni's dispensary?

470
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,519
Father, l want to change
places with you. May l?

471
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,000
Do you remember me?

472
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,459
l'm trying.

473
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:05,330
Anyone else
would be thoroughly ashamed.

474
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,720
l'm aware of that.

475
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:18,040
- Come to the point.
- Stop meeting Rajni.

476
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,640
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

477
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,410
Your father says
l shouldn't see you again.

478
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,350
l'm aiming too high.

479
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,390
Driver, stop the car.

480
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,000
Be quiet.
lt's for your own good.

481
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,650
Mr. Madan,
kindly get out of the car.

482
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,770
With pleasure.

483
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:34,190
What is this thing called love?

484
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:43,510
What are the secrets
that lie in my heart?

485
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:52,370
Your love brings me
such suffering

486
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:58,250
But do you care?

487
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,650
Yet l swear by you

488
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,580
l treasure
every wound you inflict

489
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:13,970
And even now
a song is on my lips

490
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,990
Fortunate are those...

491
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:06,040
who enjoy a life of ease

492
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,610
Though l reach the shore...

493
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:16,550
the storm rages on

494
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,620
Familiar is this pain and sorrow

495
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,500
A cold drink, please.

496
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,780
- You've been slumming!
- No, l've been drinking.

497
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,950
- l've taken an oath.
- What oath?

498
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:00,090
Don't ask.

499
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:05,370
- Were you with her?
- No, with her father.

500
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:12,929
He gave me such a thrashing,
such a thrashing.

501
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,660
- At least, l'm safe.
- And the food's home.

502
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:27,170
l had to walk 12 miles.
My feet ache.

503
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:38,160
- The boss wants you.
- So early?

504
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:42,360
- Maybe something special.
- lt's a day for the special.

505
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:53,440
- How's your sister?
- She's better.

506
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,000
Look at you now. What you were
and what you are today.

507
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,440
Do you realize?

508
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,620
l have some good news for you.

509
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,760
You'll get a 1000 as bonus.

510
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:14,320
That's all?
lt should be at least 10,000.

511
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,860
How dare you!

512
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,910
Cabbies keep an eye
on the road...

513
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,880
and an ear to the back seat.

514
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:26,270
We can recognize
a man by his voice.

515
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,040
Cut out the drama.

516
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:39,580
A man who doesn't value his
life isn't scared of death.

517
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,000
Let's talk business instead.

518
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,549
ls it a deal?

519
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:56,400
Let's come to an agreement
which is acceptable to us both.

520
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,970
A fine man.

521
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:28,480
A well known man of fortune
whose name makes thousands bow.

522
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:34,590
He's generous with everyone.
No one leaves empty-handed.

523
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,330
The very portrait of decency.

524
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,610
- Count!
- There's no need. l trust you.

525
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:47,590
Do l take it
that you'll keep quiet?

526
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,980
For now, yes.

527
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,330
- You won't meet Rajni?
- Not for the moment.

528
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:00,000
You're a clever fellow.
l like clever people.

529
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:01,750
l'm a mere disciple.

530
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:08,020
But remember,
l still hold the trump card.

531
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:11,019
You won't have to use it.

532
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:16,190
Because no matter how low you are,
l'm indebted to you both.

533
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:21,480
l won't cause you any harm.

534
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,790
Donate the money
to a charity...

535
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,750
so that your name shines.

536
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:43,470
lt's a pity my child
loves a scoundrel.

537
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,240
He's not a scoundrel.

538
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,950
- l've seen his true colors.
- l know him better.

539
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:52,220
l know he's on the wrong path.

540
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:59,320
There are many like him who
are forced to turn to crime.

541
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:04,560
They could have been saved
with a little kindness, not cruelty.

542
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:09,820
Don't argue. Stop seeing him
or l'll close your dispensary.

543
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,480
What's happened?

544
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:31,200
- You set father against Madan.
- What?

545
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:38,220
How did he know we were going
to see Manju? He insulted Madan.

546
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:46,770
l said nothing. Your father
asked me who you were with.

547
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:51,230
l told him you were with
a patient's brother.

548
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,490
Besides, your father is right.

549
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:59,260
Ramesh, l love Madan.

550
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,420
Nothing in the world
will make me give him up.

551
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,620
You think father's
blessings will suffice.

552
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:15,230
l've never loved you
nor do l love you now.

553
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,520
l never had any rights anyway.

554
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,080
You're here?
l've been looking for you.

555
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,640
Look at this photo.

556
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:14,259
A prince that
you'll meet at the races.

557
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,880
We'll get him.

558
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,640
Beware! She's a snake.
You've had it if she bites.

559
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,220
Bite me!

560
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,760
There's our man.

561
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,070
- Don't you know me?
- No.

562
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,530
l'm lbrahim,
the prince's dearest friend.

563
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:01,810
- Your name?
- Ali Baba.

564
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,580
Leena, Star Club's famous dancer.

565
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,080
Your wallet.

566
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,630
Can l help, Your Majesty?

567
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:28,400
l've left
my kingdom far behind me.

568
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,040
Since l've arrived,
l've had no fun at all.

569
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,950
Then join us!

570
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,519
- Where?
- Here's the address.

571
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,429
l'll be there in a hour.

572
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,260
Can l talk to you?

573
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:10,150
Go ahead.

574
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:13,220
Not here, at the police station.

575
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:17,179
- When?
- ln half an hour.

576
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:47,140
Finding me alone,
the rain plays with me

577
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,710
lt brushes my face as
it splashes to the ground

578
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:31,150
l slip, l slide
as l walk down the street

579
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,070
My hair is wet,
my clothes are drenched

580
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:15,160
The rain has washed away
the kohl from my eyes

581
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:19,240
lt has left me dishevelled
for the world to see

582
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,910
My step falters
and l stumble

583
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:02,950
The man who helps me,
will win my love

584
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,340
Come on.

585
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,150
What a dancer!

586
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,690
Where's Ali Baba?

587
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,980
He's on his way.

588
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:46,650
Sit down.

589
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,570
Do you know where the path
you're on will lead?

590
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,820
lt'll lead right here.

591
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:08,820
Such wit!

592
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:17,760
- Anything else?
- Who do you think you are?

593
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,959
Most people are humbled here.
Speak politely.

594
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:30,200
So you'll throw me in jail?
All right, l'm ready.

595
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:46,060
l have nothing against you.
l don't misuse my power.

596
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,230
Nor do l seek revenge.

597
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,679
Others do.
Why don't you join in?

598
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,810
- Who are you referring to?
- No one.

599
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,230
l advise you, you'd
better change your ways.

600
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,310
lt isn't too late.
l'll find you a job.

601
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:21,650
Why such compassion?
Oh... l get it.

602
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,280
l feel no compassion.

603
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:31,490
l'm only concerned about the
girl who is fretting for you.

604
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,790
Don't you care at all?

605
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,460
You know she loves you.

606
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:52,680
My hands are tied. Even if
l want to, l can't do a thing.

607
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:59,019
l can't say any more.
Each man to his fate.

608
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,240
Where's my friend, Ali Baba?

609
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:36,230
He has showed me the
way to this treasure.

610
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,950
l'll appoint him
my prime minister.

611
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:48,080
Will l have a state left?

612
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:54,890
Why are you so amused?
Let's play another round.

613
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:08,620
Where were you? The boss
has been asking for you.

614
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,930
He's winning.

615
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:15,160
He knows how to play.
l'll fix him.

616
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:17,610
- Where were you?
- At the police station.

617
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,410
- What did you talk about?
- Love.

618
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:24,100
- Give me a straight answer.
- Or else?

619
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:52,260
l've cleaned them all out.

620
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:54,860
Play a round with me.

621
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:01,410
That's no fun.
Let's have a race.

622
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,910
- Which race?
- A horse race.

623
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:11,080
- Where are the horses?
- ln my pocket.

624
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:18,269
- That makes no sense.
- Of course.

625
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:22,740
You are quite familiar
with the horse race.

626
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,450
You know every horse
has a number.

627
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:36,070
Horse number one... two...

628
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,460
Pick your horse.

629
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:51,150
Your Highness, you've broken its leg.
Don't touch it.

630
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,760
Ali Baba, you're some player.

631
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:16,630
l've had a terrific time.
We'll play again some day.

632
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:30,679
Shall we have a special tea?

633
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:34,740
The boss will pay you a bonus.

634
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:38,780
We'll all end up in jail,
but he won't.

635
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,099
What are you saying?

636
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:09,629
Throughout time,
the world has thwarted love

637
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:15,830
Do not forget this,
my sweet love, nor shall l

638
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:56,140
Love me as you will
and do not fear

639
01:36:56,410 --> 01:37:02,340
Whether we live or die,
our love will transcend time

640
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:25,350
Let the past be as it may,
the world shall not defeat us

641
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:30,810
Do not forget this,
my sweet love, nor shall l

642
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:58,420
All that you suffer
is precious to me

643
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:04,250
My life and my heart
belong only to you

644
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:24,170
May our love be eternal

645
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,380
May this bond not be broken

646
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:34,000
Do not forget this,
my sweet love, nor shall l

647
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,960
Are you well?

648
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:30,520
- Did Madan visit you?
- No.

649
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,820
- Any letters?
- l've written often.

650
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,710
He wrote to say that he was
busy and couldn't visit.

651
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:41,610
His address?

652
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,379
- Another fight?
- No.

653
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,770
Why upset me, Madan?

654
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:49,170
The dream's over.
You'd better wake up.

655
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:54,470
What are you saying?
Love isn't a dream.

656
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,180
l'm ready to defy the world.

657
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:03,790
Love isn't an isolated thing.
What use is love to me?

658
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,700
lt's all my fault,
l'm to be blamed.

659
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,300
l should've told
father from the start.

660
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:16,390
You don't know him, Madan.
He's really a kind hearted man.

661
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:18,530
l'm sure of it.

662
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:22,650
You're angry. Forgive me.

663
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:28,210
l'm not angry with you
or with anyone else.

664
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:32,360
What you're doing is bad.
Change your ways.

665
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:34,780
For my sake.

666
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:38,650
l can't believe in anything,
in you, myself, or love.

667
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,320
ln good or in evil.

668
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,870
What's happened to you?

669
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:49,820
Don't ask me.

670
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:57,510
l've gone away from you.
l can't return easily.

671
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,850
- Did Madan see you?
- No, he didn't.

672
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:09,900
- Was she with him?
- She arrived before him.

673
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,259
Hear that?

674
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,260
He promised not to meet Rajni.

675
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:28,550
l've always said he's dangerous.
He might inform the police.

676
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,710
And he might even...

677
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:36,040
lt's time to get rid of him.

678
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:40,130
l've made the arrangements.
Just say the word.

679
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:48,080
Be on your guard.

680
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,160
Why so quiet?

681
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:05,200
As though life is all work.

682
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,679
There's nothing else.

683
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:13,250
- And the sacrificial goats?
- They're upstairs.

684
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:15,339
What are you doing?

685
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:22,860
- Looking at you.
- Well, don't.

686
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:28,990
Madan, l'll be back.

687
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,610
Take him to the hotel.

688
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,639
No, l can't do it.

689
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:17,250
Leena, the consequences...

690
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:22,070
- l know.
- Yet you refuse?

691
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:29,740
Let me go!

692
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:49,150
lf you try to be clever,
you'll suffer the same fate.

693
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:55,790
Leena, you're on next.

694
01:46:57,230 --> 01:47:02,389
Heed the cry of the bird.
Life is brief

695
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:07,990
Oh innocent dreamer,
be on your guard

696
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:48,840
Life is but
a fleeting moment

697
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:53,540
Live now,
it's the season of love

698
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,710
Beauty and passion
are just illusions

699
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,590
Spring is but a season,
so enjoy it while it lasts

700
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:56,340
Time passed
can never be recaptured

701
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:00,940
Heed my words.
You won't regret it

702
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:29,620
Let's go to the
Grand Hotel, Madan.

703
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,820
Wait outside while l change.

704
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,070
Madan, l have to tell you something.

705
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:25,740
- l'll put on the light.
- No, wait.

706
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,860
l don't like this.

707
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:44,640
What do you understand?
You are always lost in yourself.

708
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,349
That's normal. Everyone
is lost in himself.

709
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,870
Do you know the boss said that?

710
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:59,960
l'm paid by him.

711
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,700
Quiet. This is urgent.

712
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:05,930
What? That you love me?

713
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:11,220
The boss commands you
to love and you love.

714
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:18,550
Before you met him,
you were a useless creature.

715
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,410
Now, look at yourself.
You're pretty...

716
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,230
attractive.

717
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,900
You don't know Madan,
how much l hate myself.

718
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,259
Let's go away.

719
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,630
Let's leave this empty life.

720
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:50,500
We'll go somewhere where
we can live as human beings.

721
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:55,350
What are you talking about?
What's happened?

722
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:01,500
There's no time to explain.
They're going to kill you.

723
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:09,120
So that's why you
brought me here?

724
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:11,650
You're in with them.

725
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,230
l won't let you go.

726
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,210
lf you go, take me with you.
They'll kill us both.

727
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:20,760
Get out of my way!

728
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:43,490
l'm not that bad a person.

729
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:49,510
Just tell me once
that l'm not all bad.

730
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:23,650
There's been a mistake.
Leena has been shot.

731
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,830
Return to the club.

732
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:30,590
ldiots!

733
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,520
This is exactly what l feared.

734
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:43,500
- Make a statement.
- l've nothing to say for now.

735
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,630
- l must see Rajni.
- You're a murderer.

736
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,400
She won't see you.

737
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,610
- l'm innocent.
- Make a statement.

738
01:56:54,410 --> 01:56:57,840
Let me see her just once.
Then l'll tell you everything.

739
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,670
l must see her. Believe me,
l won't hide a thing.

740
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:06,930
Your word?

741
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:15,340
- Let's close the club.
- No, we won't.

742
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:22,130
- He must be silenced.
- How, sir?

743
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:30,019
Send him a message.
lf he utters a word, his sister...

744
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,860
will get it.

745
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,510
Terrific!

746
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:45,120
We've found some footprints.

747
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:53,900
- Send a photographer over.
- All right.

748
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:02,960
What is it, father?

749
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,259
You seem worried.

750
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:14,380
A father can tolerate
many things.

751
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:23,200
lf a daughter is in love with
a man who gambles...

752
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,170
and whose family is unknown...

753
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:28,929
that, too, can be accepted.

754
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:34,250
But if he's a murderer?
That, can never be accepted.

755
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:37,950
- What do you mean?
- Ramesh just called.

756
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:41,360
Madan is charged with murder.

757
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:45,280
- Ramesh is lying.
- He's an officer.

758
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,150
- lt can't be.
- lt's the truth.

759
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:54,620
- l'll ask Madan.
- You won't see him.

760
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,930
- l must see him.
- No.

761
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:02,630
lf you step out of the door,
it will be closed to you forever.

762
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:18,190
They know me around here.

763
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:23,360
ls the food made here
or does it come from outside?

764
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:25,570
- You'll soon know.
- l'll soon know.

765
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:34,780
Hurry up. Open the door!
You look cross. Not much of a crowd.

766
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:47,410
lt's empty.
Brother, who are you?

767
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:53,920
Ah, so it's you.

768
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:57,050
Want a smoke?

769
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:29,230
lf you utter a word,
your sister will be killed.

770
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:50,660
How did it happen?
Did Madan really kill her?

771
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:54,350
We're investigating.

772
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:57,120
Ramesh, l know he's innocent.

773
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:05,750
lt's difficult to say.
The evidence is against him.

774
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:09,230
How did you hear?

775
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:11,589
- Because you phoned.
- Me?

776
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:15,060
Just take me to Madan.

777
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:36,630
Madan, tell me how
this happened. Please.

778
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,300
You didn't do it.

779
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:55,140
l'm sorry. l did kill her.

780
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:57,910
You're not evil.

781
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:02,380
Father will help.

782
02:02:02,490 --> 02:02:04,090
He's a good man.

783
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:10,429
Who can save a murderer
even if he tries?

784
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:16,040
Your hands can't harm anyone.

785
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:20,340
You have been deceived
by me, Rajni.

786
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,990
Leave me.

787
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:38,800
Fate has delivered Manju into
your care. You are fond of her.

788
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:41,519
Help her.

789
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,410
What did Madan say?

790
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:04,830
What's happened?
What is it?

791
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:17,320
Bring Madan here.

792
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:38,309
Your statement.

793
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:44,580
- How long have you known Leena?
- Three months.

794
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:48,490
- What was your relationship?
- We were colleagues.

795
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,570
- Did you visit her?
- Yes.

796
02:03:51,810 --> 02:03:53,260
- Loved her?
- No.

797
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,990
Why did you visit her?

798
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:00,970
- Who else worked with you?
- No one.

799
02:04:01,170 --> 02:04:05,470
You're lying. We found
another set of footprints.

800
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:07,009
l said l was alone.

801
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:10,190
When Leena was shot,
where were you?

802
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:14,530
Near the door, in front of her.

803
02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:19,299
Liar! Nina was shot in the back
and you were in front?

804
02:04:22,510 --> 02:04:26,960
l've told you
l murdered her. l confess.

805
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:29,059
You told me you're innocent.

806
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,760
l'm guilty.

807
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:44,330
Recognise this?

808
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:50,650
- lt's my pistol.
- You used this?

809
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:55,320
- Yes, l did.
- You're lying. lt's mine.

810
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:08,540
Father, why are you
being so cruel?

811
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,170
l know he's innocent.

812
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:16,839
You can save him
from hanging.

813
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:23,849
- He didn't kill her.
- He did!

814
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:30,460
There's much proof.

815
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:35,860
The evidence is fabricated.
You must defend him in court.

816
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,790
- Defend him?
- l implore you.

817
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,030
Enough of this drama.

818
02:05:57,430 --> 02:06:01,210
lt is clear from the police
report that Madan shot Leena.

819
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:05,390
On the basis of the
evidence presented and...

820
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:10,190
according to Article 302,
the accused is charged with murder.

821
02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:14,190
Have you heard the accusation?

822
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:19,680
- Do you have a defense lawyer?
- No.

823
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:22,780
Do you confess to killing her?

824
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:29,540
Yes.

825
02:06:51,610 --> 02:06:57,450
Sir, may l discuss the case?

826
02:06:58,550 --> 02:07:00,320
- ls this the file?
- Yes.

827
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:09,360
Madan is innocent. He's hiding
the identity of the murderer.

828
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:13,100
How can you be so sure?
He has confessed to the crime.

829
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:17,300
What proof have you
of his innocence?

830
02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:19,230
l can prove his innocence.

831
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:22,710
The court's decision is final.

832
02:07:23,650 --> 02:07:27,139
Someone's life is at stake.
l'm sure of his innocence.

833
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:31,920
l cannot help you.

834
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:40,330
After examining the evidence,
the jury has come to a decision.

835
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:43,110
According to penal code No. 302...

836
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:48,960
you have been sentenced to hang.

837
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:57,860
What have you done?

838
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:04,680
Don't cry, Manju. l feel worse.

839
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:08,170
Walk with your head held high...

840
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:13,690
and face them all proudly.

841
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:26,360
l've made arrangements.
Manju will stay at the sanatorium.

842
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,210
Don't close the dispensary.

843
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:34,559
Let it be a symbol
of our love.

844
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:39,760
- l confess.
- Make your statement.

845
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:41,920
Let me see Rajni.

846
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:43,980
- You phoned.
- Me?

847
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:49,410
- He is innocent.
- l confess.

848
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:54,920
l know you're innocent.

849
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:02,260
l've tried to save you.

850
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:09,340
How can l without your help?

851
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:14,570
Why are you hiding the facts?

852
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:18,580
Trying to save Rajni's father?

853
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:25,480
- He's not worth saving.
- l killed Leena.

854
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:30,900
You're lying.
When you were in lock-up...

855
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:34,660
you told me you were innocent.

856
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:37,759
You've been silenced.

857
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:43,160
You're keeping quiet
but you're not guilty.

858
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:49,969
We're all guilty of crime.
l did it for my sister's sake.

859
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,690
Someone else possibly
for a daughter.

860
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:18,070
You shall be hanged at 6 in
the morning. Any last request?

861
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:20,330
A cup of tea, special.

862
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:31,820
lt's all due to me.

863
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:45,090
Heed the cry of the bird.
Life is brief

864
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:05,090
lf you talk,
your sister will be killed.

865
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:15,820
You're asleep?
ls this a time to sleep?

866
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:22,000
- l came to congratulate you.
- What about?

867
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:25,030
Look.

868
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:33,610
lt's 5 minutes past 6.

869
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:38,510
Now, it's between you and me.

870
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:42,070
What do you mean?

871
02:13:43,450 --> 02:13:45,250
You were hiding something.

872
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:51,060
l concede you are very clever.

873
02:13:52,730 --> 02:13:54,070
What?

874
02:13:55,170 --> 02:14:01,090
Don't pretend. You killed Leena
and Madan has been hanged.

875
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:06,200
You're free. l won't talk.
l've held my tongue until now.

876
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:14,050
You've saved Rajni,
your family name...

877
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:17,240
and my life, as well.

878
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:23,290
l can't survive without her.
l'm grateful to you.

879
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:33,570
l'm delighted to see
that you're on my side.

880
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,559
l expected that.

881
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:39,349
He was a fool,
standing up to me.

882
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:42,190
What if he had
talked in court?

883
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:47,980
He knew nothing.
He didn't know who fired.

884
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,080
Otherwise, l'd have
implicated Sher Singh.

885
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:59,300
l play with the law,
though l know it's a crime.

886
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:05,090
Still, l'm respected in society.
l might have let him go...

887
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,429
but he didn't deserve Rajni.

888
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:13,920
You're under arrest.

889
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:20,820
l put the clock back an hour.

890
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:24,610
Madan is still alive
and will stay alive.

891
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:26,690
lt's empty.

892
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:32,620
No use running.

893
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:51,809
The real murderer has been
caught and you are cleared.

894
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:56,810
Because of aiding and abetting...

895
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:59,640
in unlawful activities...

896
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:02,330
according to Article 409...

897
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:07,860
you are sentenced
to 3 months imprisonment.
