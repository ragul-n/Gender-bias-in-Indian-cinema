Fought with Sumangala?

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,400
How do you know?

19
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:00,956
Your long face says it all

20
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,236

Entire college is aware

22
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:05,196
As if I won't know

23
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:07,956
I've been working day and night
on my project, Miru

24
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,556
No time to breathe

25
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:12,556
But stayed over with the boys, no?
I couldn't write her a letter

26
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,836
I've written 350 letters in 360 days, Miru

27
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:20,956
Except those 2-3 days when she came here
from Madras and these past 5 days

28
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,196
She got miffed about it

29
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,156
Padhu added fuel to her anger

30
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:28,276
He squealed something about you to her

31
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,476
What?

32
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,476
You and I are inseparable it seems

33
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,716
She asked me about it
I was so bugged, I bit her head off

34
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:38,876
She's really mad now

35
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,876
You must have asked her
your usual question, right?

36
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,756
Why can't a boy and a girl spend
time together and still be just friends?

37
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:52,196
Am I right?

38
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:58,916
You've been saying this to anyone who asks
 like a broken record, from the roof top

39
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,396
Yes, Miru

40
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:03,676
I swear no one has
a decent point of view at all

41
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:18,796
I'll blame only you

42
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,396
Make it alright with her, idiot

43
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,756
Hmmm...I did

44
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,036
I swallowed my pride and
called her last night, we made up

45
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:35,756
She'll be okay

46
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,556
Just 1 month and
our college life will be over

47
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:40,796
We'll be done with exams

48
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:44,196
You can be with her after that, right?

49
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:45,716
She knows that too, no?

50
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:49,036
She wants to go to Bombay and
 do a business management course

51
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,236
I need to change her mind again, Miru

52
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,716
Aadhi, you are the problem

53
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:55,036
I told you, right?

54
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:08,636
Must be 12'o clock now
Sure you can make it in 1 hour?

55
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,196
You really want me to come?

56
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,476
Don't start this again

57
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,075
I'm very sure
You have to come

58
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,476
I have to cook up some excuse
That's why I'm hesitating, da

59
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:22,276
I'll get everything ready
Come soon, hmm?

60
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:23,876

Wow! Lunch is ready

73
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,396
Thanks for coming

74
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:43,916
What is the occasion today?

75
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:48,556
Have I...forgotten anything?
Did I miss some special date?

76
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:51,156
It's not your birthday or mine

77
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,836
YOU are the occasion!

78
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,316
I'll tell you
Shall we eat?

79
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:55,786
Did you order from Aristo?

80
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:00,036
Whaaat?!

81
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,676
You cooked all this yourself?

82
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,210
Then what?

83
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,250
Oh! So you know to cook

84
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,650
I learnt as a silent spectator
watching my amma cook at home

85
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,810
I stay alone here, so on Sundays
I made myself the guinea pig and learnt

86
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,130
The boys have tasted
 my culinary skill quite often

87
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,169
Sit

88
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,770
Aadhi, can I trust you
in being the guinea pig?

89
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,290

99
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:13,774
Little bit
Kindly adjust

00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,854
Gawd! I'm stuffed to my throat

101
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,334
You are a damn good cook

102
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,537
For sure your wife is
one helluva lucky woman

103
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:27,897
I mean

104
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,377
Your Sumangala

105
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,377
This is for you, Miru

106
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,257
My way of thanking you

107
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,057
You've always been there for me

108
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,257
As my friend

109
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,377
Much more than the boys
who are my friends

110
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:43,177
These 3 years, we have
shared heart to heart chats

111
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,577
You've taught me Maths

112
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,177
Whenever I needed

113
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,177
...you've lent me money
even without me asking you

114
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,377
You've bought me food

115
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,897
Danced with me
and sang with me

116
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:01,137
Every single day of our final year
you have shared the bus-ride with me

117
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,657
I've attended college many days
just not to miss this journey

118
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:07,657
So I could talk to you

119
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:13,417
You've been my friend

120
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:17,337
So I just wanted to cook for you
and watch you enjoy the meal

121
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:19,177
- That's all
- 'That's what I told her'

122
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,537
Hey! Wait...wait!

123
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:24,417
'You've always been there for me
much more than my guy friends'

124
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,697
He's saying this for the first time

125
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,697
But I've heard this story
countless times

126
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,670
But I've never heard
this dialog from him till now

127
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:35,217
He told her that
and blabbed to us now

128
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,497
- Bingo, da
- Son of a gun

129
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:40,177
- I said that because he's a singer!
- 'Why drag me into this?'

130
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:41,657
Look at me
Tell me the truth

131
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:45,457
She will take better care
 of you than us, huh?

132
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,857
- We'll help ourselves
- You just keep the whole box there

133
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,337
Shut up, will you?

134
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:52,857
- Listen to me mimicking him
- 'I will be back in 2 minutes'

135
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:54,857
Will she take better care of you than us?

136
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,177
She took care of you?

137
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:57,937
Look at him laughing

138
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,657
Tell me this
I'm just curious

139
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,577
You painted Trichy red
with my shirts I lent you

140
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:03,777
Did she ever 'grant' her shirt to you?

141
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,457
You would've wanted her to

142
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,617
Because you take me for 'granted'!

143
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:11,577
You wrote pages of love letter to your girl
with my pen, till the ink ran dry

144
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,817
Did you tell her that?

145
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:15,497
You won't believe this, machan

146
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,897
With a shoe, he was literally
shooed out of our hostel

147
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:21,577
He made a beeline to my lap
yelling to be saved, didn't you?

148
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,177
Was her lap rented out then?

149
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:25,497
Listen to this, machan

150
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,497
Whenever you wanted
I gave you my wallet-

151
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:30,537
Brag all you like, but don't you say
you gave money, you scrooge of a fellow!

152
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,097
He hasn't lent 10 paisa to me

153
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,857
I would've given him my check book!

154
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,697
- Wait...waitees
- Son of Scrooge!

155
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:37,777
You garnish more spice
every time you tell us this story

156
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:40,337
What happened in your aunt's house
that day with Mrinalini?

157
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,097
Tell us the whole truth
No salt no spice

158
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:43,697
Why are you staring at him?

159
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,937
Confess and your wife won't get mad at you

160
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:48,057
In any case she wasn't
your girlfriend then, right?

161
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,377
Truth with a capital T

162
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,435
- You won't mind, will you, Priya?
- Why should I?

163
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,017
Your face says it all

164
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:54,977
He and I were practically strangers

165
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,217
She said 'Sumangala is
one helluva lucky woman'

166
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,657
Sumangala should get mad

167
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,777
She was the love of his life in Madras

168
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,697
While he was having fun
with Mrinalini in Trichy

169
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:05,417
Wonder what else he was up to
with Mrinalini over there

170
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,377
- Disgusting!
- Guys...guys, listen

171
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,497
Priya

172
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,777
Mrinalini and I

173
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:11,657
We were in a platonic relationship

174
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:13,817
- Oh gawd!
- Same old dialog

175
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,097
My ear drums have gone phut, hearing this

176
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,136
I know 'plate' and 'tonic'
What is his 'platonic'?

177
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,136
Priya, till date I have no clue
what that word means!

178
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:23,817
Look what an innocent adult he is

179
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,577
- Shut up, da
- Sorry, dude

180
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,817
Tell us exactly
what happened that day

181
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,057
What I've told you exactly
a million times before

182
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,057
Okay

183
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,257
When he attended Miru's wedding
one year after college

184
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,737
He sneaked in and out
His behavior was so weird

185
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,537
He didn't talk to a single soul there

186
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:41,136
He never got introduced to her family

187
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:42,657
Something really fishy

188
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,897
Narrate your story of your day
 with Miru in your aunt's place

189
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,136
Just for the heck of it

190
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,897
You'll get a new Aadhi flavor!

191
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,857
- Go on, tell us
- Come clean now

192
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:53,257
You guys are such a disgrace!

193
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,817
Then cough up the truth

194
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:56,777
Okay, I'll tell you

195
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:01,537
Shall I tell you something
you haven't heard all these years?

196
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,617
- Confession time
- All ears

197
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,457
Thank you

198
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,537
Come on

199
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,177
No, Miru

200
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:15,857
I have to thank you

201
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,297
Multiple times

202
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:19,057
I swear

203
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,057
I can feel the tears
stinging my eyes

204
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:23,537
You already thanked me

205
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,617
With all this food

206
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:28,657
Thank you accepted

207
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,417
'We sat on the floor
Next to each other'

208
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:32,377
We shared a friendship line

209
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,257
That invisible line
Only both of us can see it

210
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:36,257
You don't know it

211
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:37,617
In that beautiful moment

212
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,417
I don't know what
I had no such plan

213
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,377
'A thought flashed out of the blue'

214
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:42,817
Close your eyes

215
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:44,977
Why?

216
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,537
'Action replay'

217
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,977
Close your eyes please

218
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,097
Why?

219
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:53,977
Miru, just trust me

220
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,337
Close your eyes

221
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,257
No, Aadhi, no

222
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,737
Not your hand
With your dupatta

223
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,497
Smooth operator!

224
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:12,777
My blood pressure is shooting up!

225
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,817
Whaat?

226
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:16,257
Please

227
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,097
Is it a gift?

228
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:21,377
Didn't we have a deal?

229
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:23,017
We decided no gifts

230
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:24,817
Please close your eyes

231
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,377
- Aad-
- Please

232
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:40,737
What?

233
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:53,537
Why are you looking at him?

234
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,657
'Why is he bursting with tension?'

235
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,657
"Not love however"

236
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:03,497
"No lust whatsoever"

237
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:07,857
"On your cheeks my lips
An imprint of friendship"

238
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,977
"The unexpected kiss"

239
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,697
"My dear friend, mortified and scared"

240
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,857
"Listen to the truth, why I dared"

241
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:23,057
"Not your mistake, my thank you gift"

242
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,897
"The unexpected kiss'

243
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,897
Miru...I'm sorry

244
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:34,537
I am-

245
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,777
I'm leaving

246
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,417
I'm so sorry, Miru

247
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,057
It isn't what you think-

248
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:44,217
You have a girlfriend in Madras

249
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,457
You love each other
Going steady for 6 years

250
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:53,097
You have even told me once
she is your future wife

251
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,617
Then how could you kiss me?

252
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:00,737
Why did you kiss me?

253
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,017
Bang on!

254
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,977
You think that was a right question?

255
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:07,137
Miru, I wanted to thank you

256
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,537
My intention was
only a 'thank you' kiss

257
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:11,857
No other agenda

258
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,097
Just a kiss and whisper
a 'thank you' in your ear

259
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,737
I would have myself
told you to go home

260
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,577
It's getting late, right?

261
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,177
Nothing else would've happened, Miru

262
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,817
I have no ulterior motive

263
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,417
I swear on my mother

264
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,137
And it's not a plan

265
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,177
Just a split second brainwave

266
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:31,217
That's all

267
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:34,217
"Not your fault, it was my slip"

268
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:37,497
"The unexpected kiss"

269
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,897
"Boundaries of our friendship"

270
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:45,136
"Not crossed; nothing amiss"

271
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:52,217
"Though no way
Thank you I could say"

272
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:54,577
I enjoyed the lunch

273
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:58,937
"Love's lava precious"

274
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,617
You don't have to thank me

275
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,136
No need 'sorry' either

276
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,136
"Like Mount Vesuvius"

277
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:10,817
This friendship with you was beautiful

278
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,497
It IS

279
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:19,337
"The unexpected kiss"

280
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,657
"Aadhi son of a gun, smooth operator
He lies glibly, fibber of the first order"

281
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:35,577
"Liar liar, his pants on fire
Our very own master story teller"

282
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:36,617
It's the whole truth

283
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:39,177
'He shakes his head happily
after having fun heartily"

284
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:42,177
Priya, he swore on his mother
Go down and check on her

285
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,177
Hey! This happened 2 decades ago

286
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,057
He swore on his mother decades ago

287
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:47,137
That's true, right?

288
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:49,297
Hey! I didn't censor anything
because my wife is here

289
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:50,308
I didn't play the field

290
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,956
That's what I'm asking
Which base? 3rd or 4th?

291
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,737
Machan, not our man
She took it to the next level

292
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:56,417
Eff you! Don't you dare malign her

293
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,577
- Shut up
- Hey!

294
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,040
You started the ball rolling, not us!

295
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:03,897
Covered her eyes with her dupatta
and Prince Charming kissed her!

296
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,857
What B.S!
Taking us for a ride?

297
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,745
It was a 'play-tonic' kiss it seems

298
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,993
We are all born yesterday, just a baby
But this is the Oracle of Aadhi!

299
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,017
Shit!

300
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,177
This son of a gun is making me
fire bad words, I'm blushing pink now!

301
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,337
Priya, please go inside

302
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,953
Basically I'm a very
orthodox family you know

303
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,706
Only if you go in,
sugar and spice will surface out

304
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,858
We'll get to the base of it!

305
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:28,497
But I swear I must tell you this, machan

306
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,937
You missed your calling in life
to become a super script writer!

307
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:34,193
I swear the very next day
 knowing it was a blunder on my part

308
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,937
I wrote a letter to Miru

309
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:37,497
- Letter to her too?
- My god!

310
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,497
How many girls will he write to?

311
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,617
When we call him he hangs up on us
with colorful cuss words and a short OK!

312
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:43,817
Not even OK
Just 'K'!

313
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:44,897
Listen, I wrote

314
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:49,177
I apologized for the kiss and
all that jazz of wanting only to thank her

315
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:50,937
I clarified and posted the letter

316
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,857
My letter landed in Miru's dad's hands
the next day and he threw a fit

317
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,377
- Terrific twist!
- He grabbed a stick to hit you

318
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:58,777
He asked her
'Who is this Aadhi?'

319
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:01,136
Hey! Cut the crap, rascal
He wouldn't have asked so decently

320
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,257
Mach-aan, he asked her
'Who is this Aadhi?'

321
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:04,697
Swear on your mother again

322
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:07,337
I swear he may swear again!
Okay, out with it

323
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:12,136
He gave her a shelling and accompanied her
to college for the next 10 days

324
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,657
He found out your true colors!

325
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,697
I couldn't talk to her properly after that

326
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,057
Then our final exams
and last day of college

327
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,617
I came back here to Madras

328
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,817
After 3 months I broke up with Sumangala

329
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:22,897
'Tell us that story again'

330
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,777
Let's not rake that up now

331
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:25,977
After that

332
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:29,457
Priya and I were into
this platonic relationship

333
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:31,937
Platonic here also, huh?

334
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,817
How many girls did you 'play-tonic' with?

335
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:35,937
He had a field day with
4 kids through her, machan

336
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:37,217
It started with a platonic-

337
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,937
Platonic is an excuse
for a pregnant-spree!

338
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:40,857
1st platonic and only after that 4 kids

339
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,137
Okay, then...continue

340
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,457
Garnish it with more spice

341
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:45,737
So that's the story

342
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:47,817
We attended Miru's wedding, right?

343
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:50,777
I didn't get introduced to her family
because of this letter issue

344
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,937
You know this
I didn't hide it from you

345
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,017
The 'kiss' letter was the reason
you know only now

346
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:56,657
Son of a gun!
Zipped our lips now

347
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,217
Climax is a damp squib!

348
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,897
You had some feelings for her
That's why you kissed her

349
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,217
Crucify him

350
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,297
If you were just friends
why this need to kiss her?

351
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,417
You crossed your invisible line that day

352
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,697
Sorry, Priya
A big NO

353
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,577
It was a very innocent moment
I made no prior plan

354
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:15,737
May be I was overwhelmed
and felt a tad too emotional

355
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:16,977
May be but-

356
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,097
Love and all those feelings...no

357
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,577
Then it was a friendship kiss?

358
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,217
- 'Yes, pure friendship
- I won't buy this'

359
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,377
'This is something else'

360
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:26,337
Like I said, not my problem

361
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,017
I wasn't in his life then

362
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,297
Anyway you guys continue

363
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,057
I'll go check on the kids

364
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,377
Machan, your wife is mad at you
Anyway you have to sleep solo tonight

365
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,257
You can sleep in our room if you like
but no more platonic tales

366
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,177
She isn't mad at me
No chance of that I know

367
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:48,697
Forget this, how many times
did you meet Miru after that?

368
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,257
Thrice, dude

369
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:51,977
You know she attended
our reunion in Trichy

370
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,937
- Yes
- Then met her twice in U.S

371
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:55,337
- No sparks?
- What?

372
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,457
Sparks?

373
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,737
He doesn't get this concept?

374
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,057
You and I are friends, right?

375
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,486
Do sparks fly between us?
No? It's the same, machan

376
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:04,257
- Of course we share sparks
- What sparks?

377
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,057
Because my life 24 years
taking in your hand

378
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:08,417
Because of sparks, machan

379
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,497
He's such a buffoon!
So that's it, machan

380
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:12,377
Like the rapport we share
Just friends

381
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,617
Just that she and I are
damn man and woman!

382
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:15,817
Impossible

383
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:19,097
No chance of 'just for friendship' concept
between man and woman, machan

384
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:22,817
Priya and you validate my theory
Proof staring in my face

385
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,457
Then what?
You are both friends?

386
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,617
- Platonic?
- Yes

387
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,777
- What is the climax?
- What?

388
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,457
4 kids running around

389
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,897
I rest my case
Leave me alone, everybody

390
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,136
'What did you say?'

391
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,497
He wants to rest his-

392
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,657
Anyway reason I went
down memory lane

393
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,737
Miru is coming here in 3 weeks

394
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,097
En route to Bangalore

395
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,856
She wanted to meet me and
of course I said 'yes'

396
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:44,537
- Why didn't you tell Priya?
- I will, machan

397
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,537
- Eff you, call her then
- I'll tell her tomorrow

398
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:48,577
I tell her everything
She knows everything about me

399
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,217
Take me with you
I want to meet Miru too

400
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:52,937
In that area alone
I swear you're forbidden

401
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:56,257
My route got cut when it was
all fine thanks to this bum here

402
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,897
- 'I praised you sky high'
- Shut up!

403
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:00,577
Even if I call her nowadays
she spews shit on the phone

404
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,177
Hey! Give him a drink, dude

405
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,777
'It's not good for health
Please go out now'

406
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:06,737
I've ordered green tea for you too

407
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:09,657
- You want anything else?
- Yeah...yeah, green tea is good

408
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,257
I'll...I'll order something if I want later

409
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:17,537
So good to see you

410
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,457
Thanks for making time to meet me

411
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:22,137
Now shall I just leave, Miru?

412
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,737
- Why are you so formal?
- No

413
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:27,857
- I...I mean it
- Okay

414
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,377
How long are you here?

415
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,177
I mean are you here
on work or something?

416
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,817
Less than 2 hours, Aadhi

417
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,057
My flight to Bangalore is at 7

418
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,417
I'm going to a Yoga retreat there

419
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:39,417
Yoga retreat?

420
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:42,177
So that's the secret of
how you're looking

421
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:45,937
But I've come here
only to meet you

422
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:47,617
That's sweet

423
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,297
It's so good to see you too, Miru

424
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:53,297
Nothing

425
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,897
No agenda at all

426
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,017
Just-

427
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,217
Just felt like talking
to you for a good 2 hours

428
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:01,217
So I'll be talking non stop

429
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:02,217
Put up with me

430
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,017
I've been your ears always!

431
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:06,177
That's easy actually

432
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:08,817
Yeah

433
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,097
All good?

434
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,457
Yeah, all good

435
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,977
In fact one of the best phases of my life

436
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:21,177
How's your wife Priya and the kids?

437
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,577
All of them

438
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:25,337
Busy

439
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,937
Days just flying
Time's just flying

440
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:33,937
I was just thinking this morning
I need a stop or a standstill moment

441
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:37,497
You know a family time together
That bonding has to get priority

442
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:39,857
It will happen

443
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:41,777
Not for me, Aadhi

444
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,857
Actually I had too much of it

445
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,657
I want my own space

446
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:48,857
I needed the 'me' time

447
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,457
That's why I just took off

448
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,537
Kids are fine

449
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:52,977
They are with their dad now

450
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:56,257
When I get back
 I'll bring them to my place

451
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,737
Yeah

452
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,497
We have separated, Aadhi

453
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:03,857
I mean my husband and me

454
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,497
Don't ask me why
Even I don't have an answer

455
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:12,617
Out of the blue one day we both felt
this bond wasn't working out

456
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:14,777
We discussed, decided

457
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:15,937
And he left

458
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:19,097
I think it must be
about 8 months now

459
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,537
He comes now and then to visit the kids

460
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:23,657
He's a good father

461
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,055
So that side is being taken care of

462
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:27,857
That's all

463
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:30,657
I'm...

464
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,297
I'm so sorry to hear that, Miru

465
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,817
No...no
Don't be

466
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:35,697
It's fine
I'm good

467
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:39,217
It was good while it lasted
But it just faded into oblivion

468
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,297
I didn't give it much thought back then

469
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,417
I mean when I agreed to get married

470
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:47,337
Surprising really

471
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,897
Considering the kind of woman
 I was and still am

472
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:52,857
Yeah

473
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,617
I won't brand him as 'wrong choice'

474
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:57,657
In which case I am
the wrong choice for him as well

475
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,497
When they said
'she is your fiancée'

476
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:03,977
He didn't think much either

477
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:08,817
We just weren't
made for each other

478
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,377
But-

479
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:15,057
I won't call all the years
 we've been married as waste of time

480
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:17,297
My children mean the world to me

481
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:19,297
I can't think of a life without them

482
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:22,457
So it's all good

483
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,857
When I look back and connect the dots

484
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:26,297
Any which way you look at it

485
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:29,297
I'm...I'll serve you some tea

486
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:30,577
Sure

487
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:34,497
That's good

488
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,057
Thanks

489
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,617
I'm sorry, I want to talk to you about you

490
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:46,777
Can I?

491
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,177
Yeah

492
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:56,817
When we were in college, you were
 in love only with Sumangala, right?

493
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:01,017
You had this one-track mind
of marrying her and settling down

494
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,410
When you came here to Madras
you broke up with Sumangala

495
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,449
You fell in love with Priya
and married her

496
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:13,337
Have you ever thought the 6 years you spent
 with Sumangala was a waste of your time?

497
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:18,086
No

498
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,206
But it was a waste of
precious time for me

499
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,566
The time frame you were both in love

500
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,846
The 6 year phase
you were in love with her

501
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:30,686
Or the 3 years you were in love with her
when I was your best friend

502
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:32,886
Time waste, Aadhi

503
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,806
For me

504
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:41,726
Knowing you are head over heels in love
with her, you'll marry her, I didn't prof-

505
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:11,646
Aadhi

506
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:15,006
This has been whirling
in my mind for a long time

507
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,126
I zipped my lips about it

508
00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,486
I feel I was wrong
not telling you

509
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:24,606
Especially in the present situation
I feel it is the right time to tell you

510
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:30,046
I feel this heart to heart will free
 my bottled up feelings into a new world

511
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:33,206
It will open up fresh avenues for me

512
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:34,966
For me

513
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,566
Issues concerning only me

514
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:38,326
I think I'll be free then

515
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,646
That's the main reason for my visit

516
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,486
I lied when I said
I had no other agenda

517
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:47,806
Sorry

518
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:53,806
I don't know how clearly
I can express what I feel

519
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,086
When it comes to you

520
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:58,526
My words somehow get jumbled up

521
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:02,046
So this is the letter
I've penned my thoughts into

522
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,846
Aren't you the Letter King?

523
00:28:08,526 --> 00:28:09,726
Aadhi

524
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:12,126
This is what I wanted to tell you

525
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:15,126
I want you to read it in front of me

526
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,846
After you read it, don't say a word
You don't have to do anything

527
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:22,086
That day in your aunt's house
you told me you had no ulterior motive

528
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,286
This is ditto

529
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,085
If that was true

530
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:28,126
So is this

531
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:32,686
Read it right here
and tear it in front of me

532
00:28:33,006 --> 00:28:34,766
I'll leave without saying another word

533
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,406
'I remember the 1st day
I met you, 1st year of college'

534
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,046
'I thought you were a hooligan'

535
00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:02,166
'3 weeks later when I heard you speak'

536
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:05,806
'I wondered how a rowdy like you could
have such a refined velvet soft voice'

537
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,086
'But even my 1st impression
of you as a hooligan'

538
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:10,526
'...didn't deter me from
falling in love with you'

539
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:15,286
'Pure and simple love
I knew it, 100 %'

540
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:19,286
'Grapevine said you had a steady
girlfriend back in Madras'

541
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:22,126
'I assumed it was the usual
bragging macho image'

542
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:24,046
'Charming Madras boy already hooked'

543
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:26,406
'But the confirmation poured in
from multiple sources'

544
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:29,126
'All our friends told me
you loved her to the moon and back'

545
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:30,766
'So I resisted the attraction'

546
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:32,286
'I should delete you from my thoughts'

547
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,566
'I shouldn't even talk to you
and 1 year whizzed by'

548
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,046
'But in our II year
I couldn't resist talking to you'

549
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,206
'Or befriending you'

550
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:39,486
'I heard you sing too'

551
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:42,326
'I decided I had to be your friend
and my dream came true'

552
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:45,006
'Love...I trashed that feeling'

553
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:46,846
'I tried and became your friend'

554
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,126
'Like your best friend'

555
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,846
'And you became my best friend'

556
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:53,126
'You made a huge difference to my life
much more than all my girl friends'

557
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,646
'I basked in the warmth of
the time we spent together'

558
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,286
'Life was a bed of roses'

559
00:29:58,326 --> 00:30:00,566
'One day you invited me over
to your aunt's house'

560
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,926
'You kissed me'

561
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:03,686
'Towards the very end'

562
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:05,886
'Tail end of a blissful college life'

563
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,006
'My heart shattered into smithereens
in that moment in time'

564
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:12,926
'Every inch of me yearned for your touch
wanted more of your kisses'

565
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,406
'And screamed out to be
nestled in your arms most willingly'

566
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,806
'But you didn't hear me
You were blissfully ignorant'

567
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:20,126
'I even brought up Sumangala's name then'

568
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,166
'To clarify-'

569
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:22,926
'Insisting it was a kiss of gratitude'

570
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,366
'...you swore on your mom
denying any other intention'

571
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:29,846
'I cursed myself for jumping
to wrong conclusions'

572
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:32,766
'When my dad broached the subject of
finding a groom for me that night'

573
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:33,886
'I relented, I said yes'

574
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:36,206
'I saw you a year later
on my wedding day'

575
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:37,366
'I couldn't talk to you'

576
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,886
'Then after a long time I heard
you got married too'

577
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:42,286
'I heard your wife was
not Sumangala but Priya'

578
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:44,686
'The cussword 'wretched fellow'
flared in my mind'

579
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:45,686
'That's all'

580
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:48,406
'Please tear my life story-letter
without saying a single word'

581
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,206
'Serious, let's not dissect this'

582
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:51,286
'Let me leave now'

583
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,486
'We'll meet again in this lifetime'

584
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,206
'Still be this same precious bond'

585
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,006
'If there's really another birth'

586
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,966
'Come to me as my friend
in that life as well'

587
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:00,686
'We'll go with the flow'

588
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:12,246
I still have a lot of time before my flight
I'll leave only after a while

589
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:16,686
If you are busy
you can leave

590
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:18,046
No worries

591
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:20,166
This is Prabhakar's 24x7 dialog

592
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:23,406
'A man and a woman can
never be friends, machan'

593
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:25,726
'He said this to me
even 3 weeks ago'

594
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:29,846
Hereafter I can't argue with him
or din my point into his head

595
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:34,086
He claims the proof to his theory
is the bond Priya and I share

596
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,046
Now you and me

597
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,526
No

598
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,046
He is the one who is wrong

599
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,566
We've been friends, Aadhi

600
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:45,726
Only friends

601
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,046
Always forever
we'll be only friends

602
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:52,286
In a weird kind of way
that is the whole truth

603
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:56,006
But I...I can't tear this letter

604
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,126
Give it to me
I'll do it for you

605
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:01,366
You've written this to me
Your 1st letter to me

606
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:03,046
It will be safe with me

607
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,006
I'll cherish even the paper

608
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,606
I can't tear this, sorry

609
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,246
No, Aadhi

610
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:12,686
Not because I'm scared someone will
get the wrong idea reading it

611
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,126
No shared confidences

612
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:17,326
You don't have this letter

613
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:18,326
That's all

614
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:23,184
This conversation,
this meeting, this letter

615
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:24,446
Doesn't exist

616
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,686
Just you and me is real

617
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:27,926
And our friendship

618
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,326
It was beautiful

619
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:32,526
It IS!

620
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:35,921
For once I'm tongue-tied, Miru

621
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,361
I told you so?

622
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:40,321
You don't have to utter a single word
That's the crux of the matter

623
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:44,511
Seriously, whatever I say
will be like I am belittling you

624
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:46,745
I won't ask you why you never told me this

625
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,770
Even if you had-

626
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:51,812
'I know you wouldn't have guessed, Aadhi'

627
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:08,452
'Him and Me'

628
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,961
'Chennai'

629
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:15,262
"…forget it
...when're you coming"

630
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:17,222
Stop kidding, Sis?
Its just a week...

631
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:19,422
How can I visit again
Shouldn't I attend College

632
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,902
Home feels vacant,
...without you

633
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:22,902
We're on video-call, daily

634
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:24,742
Could 'meeting' & 'this' be the same

635
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:26,662
Preeti, where are your Pads

636
00:33:26,662 --> 00:33:28,302
Take it from my desk's drawer

637
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:31,822
Has your Husband, called

638
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:34,902
Haven't I told you:
It's over

639
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:36,462
Dont talk about it

640
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:37,382
But...

641
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:39,142
Mom-Dad can't accept it

642
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:40,662
They're very disturbed

643
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,102
It'll be fine, soon

644
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:43,302
You go to sleep

645
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:44,102
I'll handle it

646
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:48,662
Preeti…

647
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:49,662
What now

648
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,222
What happened…

649
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:52,422
As in...?

650
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,382
You haven't been using, Pads

651
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:55,862
For a couple of months...

652
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:58,982
When did you use, last

653
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:03,382
Why should you think, even?

654
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,342
You were getting close with Vikram

655
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:11,502
Did you guys...

656
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,582
Vikram, why're you stopping?

657
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:33,062
Dress is fully wet,
...lets keep going

658
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:34,542
Can't spot any bumps or pits...

659
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,262
Once it stops raining, we'll go

660
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:37,822
Rain doesn't seem like stopping

661
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:41,022
There' a Hotel here,
one-second

662
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:44,822
- We'll have Coffee & go?
- No Vikram... lets leave

663
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:46,382
Come-on...
Its just Coffee

664
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,302
Is there any Restaurant, here

665
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:04,582
...coffee-shop?

666
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:08,942
Is anything here, Open?

667
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:11,542
Say a 'yes' or 'no', Sir

668
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:14,462
Rooms are Open,

669
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:16,622
...with a Bed,

670
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,342
& Service too!

671
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,102
- Can we…?
- "Sure"

672
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,782
Room? We're not taking any room Vikram.
Come, let's leave

673
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,102
Rain hasn't stopped &
...can't wait here, yeah?

674
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:31,102
Come. Let's get to the room,
& call for Coffee.

675
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:43,902
Come

676
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,342
Preeti, just a power-cut
...come-on

677
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,582
In this area, its quite common

678
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,942
...should switch-on the generator,
Come

679
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,582
What are you doing, Vikram
Why're you locking the door?

680
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,342
What are you asking

681
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:19,222
Can't leave the door open, yeah?

682
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:24,222
It's all wet, from the rain

683
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,382
Dry your clothes...

684
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:29,902
Dry your clothes-Dry your clothes...
- No Vikram

685
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:30,502
Just listen to-

686
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,902
What are you talking...
Lets go, Lets go from here!

687
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:36,742
Yeah, upstairs...

688
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:38,582
Hurry-Hurry,
...Come-up

689
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:40,022
Who was it on-phone now

690
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,022
From downstairs, the Reception

691
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:43,142
Reception?

692
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:45,542
You never gave your number
How'd they call…

693
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,462
Preeti, listen to me…

694
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:52,062
- Just relax for a second...
- Who's coming up?

695
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,382
- Just relax...
- No something's fishy...

696
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:53,982
Just hold-on

697
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:54,622
We'll go, We'll go

698
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,622
- No, I just wanna go...
- Only one second...

699
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:00,062
If you co-operate,
...it'll all be over soon

700
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:06,902
- Once again, Vikram no-no-no...
- Just listen to me...

701
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,102
I need to open the door...

702
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:10,462
Oh My... A knife!

703
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:11,502
Its a murder…

704
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:13,502
Please help...
Vikram, No Vikram

705
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,022
Somebody help....
Vikram no!

706
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:49,462
Happy Birthday Preethi!

707
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:57,142
So...this was all your Plan

708
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:00,902
…messed-it, yeah

709
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:36,662
...this is why,
you got me here?

710
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:41,702
Come, let's go

711
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:49,422
Uh Preeti…

712
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,142
Come, Let's leave

713
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,291
You! When did you get here

714
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:21,075
Was it Me,
...who got here

715
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:23,662
Just, get out

716
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,142
Come-on, get going...

717
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:28,062
-...this wasn't part of the Plan!
-We got plenty of Plans. Now go

718
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,125
Just get out…

719
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:30,613
First-up, you leave.
Go...

720
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,862
Why so dull..?

721
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:06,942
Past 2 months,
I've skipped...

722
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:07,742
What've you skipped?

723
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:11,302
Who hasn't come, Preeti?

724
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:12,702
Its nothing, Aunty

725
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,502
A friend went away,
& skipped to return…

726
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:15,302
...meant that

727
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:16,182
Is it?

728
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:17,182
...you alone?

729
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,422
Alright.
You guys continue

730
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:32,334
What happened?

731
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:34,454
My Periods've skipped,
...2 months

732
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:38,094
"Shruthy" wants me to get Tested

733
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:39,454
I don't know what to do now

734
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,334
Has she lost her mind?
Just once we-

735
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,534
It'd be nothing...

736
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,414
I said the same too,
& not take any Test

737
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:49,614
It can't be, yeah

738
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:50,974
Not a chance

739
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,374
Or you could Test &
...check too

740
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:09,534
What do you want, dear

741
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,494
…Pregnancy-Test-Kit, bro

742
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,494
'Bought?
You Tested?'

743
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:15,814
'Want me to Test here?'

744
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:16,574
How much

745
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:20,414
130 bucks

746
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,854
- Which college?
- Venkateshwara Engineering College

747
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:25,294
...for my Sister, bro

748
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:53,734
'Wat happened?'

749
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:55,054
'What happened?
You Tested?'

750
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:50,334
What is it

751
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:54,853
What is it

752
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:17,214
What is this

753
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:19,454
I can't believe this

754
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:20,974
Told him, yet

755
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:23,454
I've sent him...

756
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,694
Did he reply

757
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:35,654
'Number you're calling is,
...currently switched off'

758
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:37,814
Phone is switched off

759
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,454
I'd warned you,
…not to trust anyone

760
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:43,534
No-one's a Saint here

761
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:45,174
What've you done

762
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:58,414
My Sister's a Gynaecologist,
...in Velan Hospital

763
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:00,294
First, let's confirm this

764
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,574
First thing tomorrow,
We'll meet her

765
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,774
You assured us,
...this time, Dr.

766
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:52,574
- "IVF isn't in our hands, Sir"
- Come, let's go

767
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:54,774
We aren't blessed, uh?

768
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,334
I've convinced my Sister...

769
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:29,854
This, is actually illegal

770
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:33,214
If this goes-out her Medical Counsel License,
would be cancelled

771
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:38,654
Here, fill this up

772
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:44,814
Hmmm, go on...

773
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:13,694
'Number you're calling is,
...currently switched off'

774
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:16,094
'Please try again, later'

775
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:58,054
Preeti...

776
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:06,134
Last-night, he dropped his phone,
...from Terrace & it broke

777
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:10,094
Immediately he hurried-off,
...on bike to meet a friend

778
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:12,974
A little while later,
...we got a call!

779
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:15,774
-some Lorry'd rammed him &
...right-there-

780
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:27,894
Sorry Shruthy,
I cannot abort the child…

781
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:30,894
This child is the symbol,
...of our Love

782
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:35,854
Speak to Mom & Dad...

783
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:38,014
Explain what has happened-

784
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:41,654
No way...

785
00:49:42,894 --> 00:49:45,214
If they know,
...what's happened to me:

786
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:48,214
They'd die of shame.

787
00:49:53,054 --> 00:49:54,534
What do we do, Preeti?

788
00:49:58,174 --> 00:49:59,134
No idea, Shruthy...

789
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:08,614
'Few Months Later..'

790
00:50:51,574 --> 00:50:52,534
It's a Boy, dear

791
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:26,294
Where's the Baby?

792
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,374
Where's my Baby, Shruthy?

793
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:03,094
This child,

794
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:07,054
This child,
...cannot be aborted!

795
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:09,374
When you said that,

796
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:11,374
When you said that,
…it made sense

797
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:14,694
But wanting to,

798
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:17,254
But wanting to,
...raise this child, Yourself

799
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:19,974
Doesn't make sense, Preeti

800
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:27,254
With this child, Could you,

801
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:29,494
...go to your Mom & Dad,

802
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,334
& admit, this is your Child?

803
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:35,374
Could you...?

804
00:52:39,814 --> 00:52:41,094
For the past 4 months,

805
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:43,734
For the past 4 months,
...your Mom & Dad

806
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:46,494
...couldn't video-call,
& speak to you

807
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,934
Didn't go to College,

808
00:52:53,054 --> 00:52:54,894
Didn't go to College,
…as everyone'd know

809
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:56,374
So you stayed with a friend

810
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,574
How many more days,

811
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,894
Are you going to continue living in fear

812
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:07,054
Don't know

813
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:11,334
You haven't Graduated,

814
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:13,654
You haven't Graduated,
...nor Settled

815
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:18,614
How'd you raise this baby,

816
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,454
How'd you raise this baby,
...& take care of it

817
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:21,534
Tell me Preeti...

818
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:28,094
Think practically now...

819
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:36,894
So, I've given it,
...to an Orphanage

820
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:41,454
...should not have done this

821
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:43,614
I want my child back

822
00:53:45,814 --> 00:53:47,054
I did this for you, girl...

823
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:50,734
You'll understand...

824
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:53,174
You also have a life

825
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:55,774
...you still have

826
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:03,179
'Few Weeks Later..'

827
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:09,494
'Trichirapalli'

828
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:23,774
Preethi...?
...never informed about coming!

829
00:54:23,814 --> 00:54:24,614
Come, Come...

830
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,014
Came by Train, dear?

831
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:27,614
Haven't seen you,
...in so long!

832
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:29,454
You stopped video-calls too…

833
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:31,934
Anyways... go have a shower,
...have lots to talk with you

834
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:33,574
What is it, Mom?

835
00:54:34,014 --> 00:54:36,494
We decided something,
...without consulting you

836
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:37,814
It is wrong, but...

837
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:40,054
...what decision?

838
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:29,894
Is it 'my child',
...only if I deliver?

839
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,334
You see...

840
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:34,254
I've become a Mom too!

841
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,094
We'd informed many ashram's

842
00:55:36,174 --> 00:55:38,094
...to inform if there was a baby

843
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:39,814
They sent a photo...

844
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:41,853
Looked like a kid,
...from our Family

845
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:44,614
So... I brought him home

846
00:56:05,014 --> 00:56:06,934
I'm sure you're okay,
...with this decision

847
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,870
Thank you...thank you...thank you

Wow!

How many games
and what rave reviews!

858
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,550
From Minecraft to Logam

859
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,310
Throughout this journey
you guys were with me

860
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,350
I won't let down that faith

861
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,830
Thank you so much

862
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,670
So we will talk about
this Logam game today

863
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,550
We have a special guest here with us-

864
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,750
In our 'live' show

865
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:41,390
We can even call him
a legend in Logan game

866
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,830
What? Are you guessing?

867
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:47,110
He's one of the top 5 players of Logam

868
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,230
And he is the only person
who managed to reach

869
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,750
Level 28!

870
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,070
Yes, of course
It's none other than

871
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,550
Adam Vice of Logam

872
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,230
Let's welcome him to our show

873
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,950
Hi brother

874
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,630
You went overboard praising me

875
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,069
Yeah, thanks for inviting me for the show

876
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,830
And I'm a big fan

877
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,830
Thanks, Adam

878
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,670
Those of you unaware of this game

879
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,310
I'll just give you a quick brief

880
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,070
This is a virtual sandbox game
with 48 incredible levels

881
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,270
This game was developed and
 launched by Black Ticket Company

882
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,230
And it has superseded in leaps and bounds
Minecraft, Civilization, GTA12

883
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,750
I can't even believe
 the scope of this game

884
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,069
'It's immense, man'

885
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,150
So, okay, anyways
let's get down to business

886
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,350
What is the story of Adam Vice?

887
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,150
'How did you get into this game?'

888
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,110
How did you reach Level 28?

889
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:43,350
I've been a gamer
 since...what...12?

890
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:46,470
Like everyone else I was hooked on
 to games from when I was a kid

891
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,270
And I have played Minecraft multiple times

892
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:54,630
I think it was 1 or 2 months
after Logam was launched

893
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,310
And avatars can be used by 'live' voice

894
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:02,590
Tasks are interesting and levels
are challenging, my friend told me

895
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:07,590
Wondering what can be so new
and challenging to rave about

896
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,270
I entered that game

897
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:18,430
'The Universe'

898
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,670
Wowww!

899
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,030
What a freaking start!

900
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,990
'What should I do now?'

901
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,990
Why is everything in zero?

902
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,550
Oh! Obviously!

903
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,470
Nice stone

904
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,069
Any players here?

905
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,310
Hello...?

906
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:33,630
Is anyone there?

907
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:38,310
Okay, let me attend to my work

908
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,590
So much effort for
a few miserly points!

909
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,430
What is that sound?

910
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:00,550
Dai!

911
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,110
Hey!

912
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,630
Who is that?

913
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,470
Show your face
if you have the guts

914
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,950
Oh! Not men, huh?

915
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,030
What is it?

916
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,230
What a beautiful-

917
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,310
Aiyaiyo!

918
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,510
Don't come near me
Make a detour

919
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,069
Aiyaiyo! Charging towards me

920
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:21,910
I tried warding it off

921
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,430
It seems hell bent
on attacking me!

922
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,670
Come...come headlong

923
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,910
Game over, huh?

924
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,390
Who are you, da?
Madcap!

925
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,030
You're asking me in the same modulation
as in Baahubali, 'Warrior, who are you'?

926
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,390
Okay, fine
Who are you?

927
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,910
- I'm Adam
- Fine, so what?

928
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,070
Common courtesy is you must
introduce yourself in return

929
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,270
I'm Eve

930
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,870
Eve-Adam

931
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,510
Adam-Eve

932
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,750
What a pair!

933
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,630
Okay, it's getting dark

934
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,510
Blood Raiders are expected
any moment now

935
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,710
They will try to loot
only the new players

936
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,470
But I don't have anything

937
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,470
Then murder is confirmed

938
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:18,790
Whaaat?

939
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,270
Aiyaiyo! What wrong did I do?

940
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,590
- I'm only in Level 1
- Level 1 player, that's all?

941
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:23,990
Then have you built a house?

942
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,946
I'm an expert at building houses

943
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,350
- Sorry, did I spittle?
- I didn't mean that house?

944
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,430
Have you built a house in the game?

945
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,030
Oh! You mean 'house'?

946
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:35,350
I had a 'cutting' and I was
cutting wood at home

947
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,030
A wild boar came
and attacked me

948
01:03:37,069 --> 01:03:39,030
It was an intense fight
I hit it with a fierce blow

949
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,710
I don't know if you saw, ma'am
but that's when you came to save me

950
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,310
Agreed...agreed, I lied

951
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,190
If you hadn't entered and saved me
it would have made mincemeat of me

952
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,070
Thank you so much
Now you don't kill me please

953
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,550
Then what I said was 100% right

954
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,350
- What did you say?
- Madcap!

955
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,390
Oh! Like that?
Thank you...thank you

956
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,710
I just don't mind, ma'am
You can call me whatever

957
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,950
Hmmm...be focused

958
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:01,510
I won't skip any task hereafter, okay?

959
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:03,870
You tell me what I should do

960
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,310
You don't have to do anything

961
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,150
If you want to be safe tonight

962
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,430
- Come home with me
- Whaat?

963
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,710
To your place?

964
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,590
Welcome to my home

965
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,110
Wow! Awesome!

966
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,350
Soooper!

967
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,270
All these belong to you, ma'am?

968
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,750
Hello, listen

969
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,430
You should mind your own business
Come, stay and just leave

970
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,750
Instead if you dare touch my treasure

971
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,990
Before the Blood Raiders come and kill you

972
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,990
I swear I'll pre-empt them!

973
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:35,230
- Aiyo!
- Understood?

974
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,550
Why this murderous rage?

975
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,310
I don't need any of these gems, ma'am

976
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,430
Your house, your rules, ma'am

977
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:42,750
Basically I'm a good boy

978
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,790
You can come and ask
 in my area if you like, ma'am

979
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,550
Please don't 'ma'am' me

980
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,550
Call me 'Eve'!

981
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,630
Oh! Okay

982
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,270
- Eve
- What?

983
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,830
I just tried calling your name

984
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:52,790
- Eve
- Whaat?

985
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,430
I let your name
roll on my tongue for fun

986
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,670
'Eve...Eve'

987
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,190
- 'Modulation correct?'
- Silly fellow!

988
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,190
Eve

989
01:04:58,670 --> 01:04:59,750
Eve

990
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,190
What to do if the Blood Raiders
find this house or me?

991
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,430
'Come on, relax'

992
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:13,230
'This house is highly protected
 from Blood Raiders'

993
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:15,510
'No way can they find my place'

994
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,030
Thank God!

995
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:18,390
That means we are safe

996
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:20,430
You have literally a treasure trove here!

997
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,230
What will you do with all these?

998
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:25,350
What a silly question!
To enter the Emerald world

999
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,510
If I take the Philosopher stone over there

1000
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,910
I go straight to
the climax level

1001
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,070
That's my goal

1002
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,670
Ideal goal indeed!
Simply awesome

1003
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,030
You are something else!

1004
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,950
Wish I could join you

1005
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,750
Your bed

1006
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:37,990
...is over there!

1007
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,230
Come on, go

1008
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,950
But aren't we already friends?

1009
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,211
Adam-Eve

1010
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,990
Should we sleep alone
even in the game?

1011
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:46,870
I won't put my leg
on you and hassle you

1012
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,030
- Can I also crash here?
- Dai! Get lost!

1013
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,430
I was just kidding
Took it seriously or what?

1014
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,790
Actually I want to ask you something

1015
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,310
Why did you save me?

1016
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,830
Oh! You want to know why?

1017
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,270
My blessed fate!

1018
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,270
No, I am asking you seriously

1019
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,630
Why did you rescue me?

1020
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:04,590
I got a notification in the game

1021
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,550
It was pointing towards your direction
I came thinking this was a task

1022
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,190
I came and searched for you

1023
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,470
When I looked around

1024
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:14,030
Out of the blue I saw a pig over there

1025
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,910
Hitting you black and blue

1026
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,190
Excuse me, that isn't a pig, boar

1027
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,390
- Wild boar
- Whatever, let it be

1028
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,070
In Tamil it is referred to as 'pig', right?

1029
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,350
I mean, wild boar?

1030
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,390
Look at that

1031
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,310
Your face turned a fierce red
when I said 'pig'!

1032
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,510
Okay, let me come to the point

1033
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,150
Having come here, I thought
might as well kill the boar

1034
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,710
Will get tasty pork to eat

1035
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,950
And enough gold to add to my treasure

1036
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,990
But saving you was a pure accident

1037
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:44,310
Oh! Like that

1038
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,270
But so magnanimous of you

1039
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:50,430
If I had been in your shoes I would have
happily whistled and walked away

1040
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,110
Are you good as gold?

1041
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:54,830
Yeah, basically-

1042
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,110
Sweat dreams!

1043
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,950
Soooper game!

1044
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,230
Deadly fight!!

1045
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,230
The way she flew down
and stood in front of me

1046
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,310
- Wow!
- Aiyo!!

1047
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,070
Then you just drooled
Didn't play at all?

1048
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,670
She flew gracefully
 and stood, machi

1049
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,110
So breathtakingly beautiful

1050
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,830
Hey! Are you thinking
a mere 'avatar' is a real girl?

1051
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,190
Is she a real chick?

1052
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,110
Do you remember
6 months ago our bro-

1053
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,310
He was chatting in FB 24x7

1054
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,790
In the end what happened?
'She' turned out to be an uncle?!

1055
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,390
That's a heady feel, da

1056
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,190
Are you taking a dig at me?

1057
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,190
I heard her voice
Chic chick! Confirmed

1058
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,390
You can mock at me for all I care

1059
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,070
I'm in love

1060
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,910
'Let's close shop
Wrap it all up'

1061
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,310
You'll get it from me!

1062
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,910
'Hey! Madcap'

1063
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,750
'Don't you have any sense of time?'

1064
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,270
Hey, waiteees!

1065
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,790
Patience please

1066
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,790
'Check where I am in the map
and better land there'

1067
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,030
I'm coming...1 second

1068
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,790
Hey! Where are you?

1069
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,069
Why be so tense?
It's just a game

1070
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:09,470
We can play in a relaxed manner

1071
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:11,064
You won't understand if I explain

1072
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,590
You are the one with less points

1073
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,630
Focus and try to collect your coins

1074
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,990
Why do you keep bullying me?
If you just tell me I'll get it

1075
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:19,230
I'm 25 years young!
By the way how old are you?

1076
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,070
1 year older than last year

1077
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,310
Next year I will be
1 year older than this year!

1078
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,270
Asking a girl her age?

1079
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,670
Do you have an iota of
decency or manners?

1080
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,870
Tell me, you madcap?

1081
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,750
Madam, forgive me
The words just tumbled out!

1082
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,230
Okay, let me ask you directly

1083
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,230
Will you give me
your WhatsApp # or not?

1084
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,270
- She looks up when I ask for her #!
- We have to leave now, let's go

1085
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,590
I asked for your # and
you're changing the topic happily

1086
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,670
Why are you running?
At least tell me and then run

1087
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,710
You...goddamn!
Blood Raiders, da

1088
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,350
Eve

1089
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,790
Why are they chasing us now?

1090
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,710
Did you see the gold coins in our hands?

1091
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,230
Now you know the reason

1092
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,790
The game is testing us

1093
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,430
Will you sprint faster?

1094
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,310
If it's so dangerous just let go, Eve

1095
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,830
Why take this kind of risk?

1096
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,110
Eve, what is happening?

1097
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:13,310
I'm asking you

1098
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,510
We are in trouble

1099
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,230
That's all I can say now

1100
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,030
You said your home is highly protected

1101
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:21,590
Now you're saying
'we are in trouble'

1102
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:24,510
I don't know how long
 this protection will last, Adam

1103
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:27,790
I haven't encountered Blood Raiders
at such close quarters till now

1104
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,110
What joy do they get killing us?

1105
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:34,590
Not 'us', Adam

1106
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:35,750
Just you!

1107
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,830
Me...? I'm an useless piece anyway

1108
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:39,630
Oh! They don't know that, right?

1109
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,630
With the click of your finger
tell me how I should upgrade

1110
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,069
Sorry, you can't

1111
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,310
Whaaat? I can't-

1112
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,870
We have to fight Adam

1113
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,030
No other option

1114
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,150
Oh my God!
What happened?

1115
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,990
Wait, I'm coming

1116
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,830
Adam?

1117
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,595
Hello, my dear precious princess!

1118
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,830
How is your upgraded 'madcap 2.O'?

1119
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:40,950
This is why the game
must have brought me to you

1120
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:43,630
Saving myself by saving you!

1121
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,950
Shouldn't say it like that

1122
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,710
You saved me while I saved you

1123
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,150
That sounds good

1124
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:50,230
High 5!

1125
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,430
Hello, Eve

1126
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:17,830
Are you online?

1127
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,150
Hello, you there?

1128
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,270
Eve

1129
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,590
I want to speak with you in private

1130
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,750
Heart to heart
Personal chat

1131
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:52,590
Actually I miss playing with you

1132
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,830
To be honest

1133
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,790
I miss you, di

1134
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,510
Why beat around the bush?

1135
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,470
Let me say it
straight from my heart

1136
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,870
I'm in love with you

1137
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:07,550
'Pyaar, Prema, Kaadhal'

1138
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,070
Whichever...whatever

1139
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:11,630
I'm unable to pinpoint
what I love most about you

1140
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:14,750
Your entry, attitude?
Stubborn streak?

1141
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,390
Or your temper tantrums?

1142
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,790
Aiyoooo!

1143
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:20,230
I love all these and more

1144
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,310
Why are you torturing me like this, dear?

1145
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,070
Pccht!

1146
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,990
You don't have to profess
your love immediately?

1147
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,270
But don't feel shy and hold back

1148
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,310
Whether you think about this
lying on your back or stomach

1149
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,830
Whatever the position

1150
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:41,470
Those 3 words I want to hear
Will you tell me in 10 seconds?

1151
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,270
10 is too short, no?

1152
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,430
20...?

1153
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,630
Hey! Go to bed, madcap

1154
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,510
Eve...?

1155
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,750
'Are you online?'

1156
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,910
Hello...Eve?

1157
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,150
Hello...?

1158
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,350
Eve?

1159
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,110
You heard what I said?

1160
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,790
Oh! Shaa!

1161
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:31,430
"You are a riddle, my dear"

1162
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:37,630
"First tell me your name here"

1163
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:43,910
"You are my faithful shadow"

1164
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:50,430
"Who am I here if you move away now?"

1165
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:56,430
"O' girl who chats with me
in virtual reality daily"

1166
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:02,630
"I fell in love with you
in real life too"

1167
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:08,750
"In the blink of my eye I knew"

1168
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:15,750
"I realized my feelings for you"

1169
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:21,270
"Isn't this love crystal clear?
Why be stubborn, my dear?"

1170
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,430
"Come out of the shadows, face to face
We can share love and laughter always"

1171
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:30,070
"O' girl, I am you, you are me"

1172
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:33,350
"Mind is like the clouds truly
waiting to burst duly"

1173
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,950
"Change as rain and shower on me
Lass, let's unite till eternity"

1174
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:42,150
"Together, you and me"

1175
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:57,950
"Girl, you threaten or bully me
Knowing I love you madly"

1176
01:15:57,990 --> 01:16:04,910
"I will hug you close to me
for a lifetime in reality"

1177
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:10,270
"Isn't this love so sincere?
Why be stubborn, my dear?"

1178
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:15,670
"Come out of the shadows, to our real life
We will live happily as man and wife"

1179
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:19,390
"O' girl, I am you, you are me"

1180
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,630
"Mind is like the laden clouds, dearie"

1181
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:28,030
"Change as rain and shower on me
Princess, let's unite till eternity"

1182
01:16:28,069 --> 01:16:33,110
"Let's be, me & you, you & me"

1183
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,830
What are you doing, Eve?

1184
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:38,150
I'm taking the Philosopher stone

1185
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:40,230
How?

1186
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,630
By returning all that we collected so far?

1187
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:45,950
We finished all the challenges just now
Why this tearing hurry so soon?

1188
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,870
True but we haven't stepped
into the Emerald world, right?

1189
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:51,030
My goal

1190
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,950
- I need that Philosopher stone
- Aiyo! Don't I know this, Eve?

1191
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,270
All I'm asking is why be in such a rush?

1192
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:59,110
As we go to a higher level
challenges will become tougher

1193
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,230
The time we spend together will lessen, Eve

1194
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:02,230
Don't you know this?

1195
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,390
You know about this game
much more than I do

1196
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,070
Knowing all that
should you do this?

1197
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,750
That too right now?

1198
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,710
Why can't we be the 1st winners
of this game, Adam?

1199
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,070
Aiyo! By all means, I agree

1200
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:13,950
But why rush into this like a hurricane?

1201
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:16,150
If we enter the Emerald world
and one of us dies

1202
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,750
...we can't use that account

1203
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:19,670
We have to start fresh
Don't you know that?

1204
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,750
What is so difficult to understand here?

1205
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:25,190
I've been telling you that stone is
my dream come true from day #1

1206
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,630
You even said, 'Soooper!
Awesome! Wish I could join you'

1207
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:31,430
Why are you suddenly firing
questions piled up at me?

1208
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,070
Oh gawd! Eve

1209
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:36,230
The moments we spend together
seem more important than that stone

1210
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:38,430
We can't take a risk
for a mere stone, Eve

1211
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:41,030
Madcap! Is this what's bothering you?

1212
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,910
Once we get that stone

1213
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,630
I'll share my WhatsApp # with you, simple

1214
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,350
Then we will chit-chat daily

1215
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,630
This is just a game

1216
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,470
Why are you getting so senty?

1217
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,590
Fine then

1218
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,590
You'll give me your WhatsApp #

1219
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,390
Then we can happily take
any kind of risk for this stone

1220
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,070
If I had known this I wouldn't have
spoken for so long breathlessly!

1221
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,710
You know for me, taking a risk is
as enjoyable as munching a rusk!

1222
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,670
'Madcap!'

1223
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,910
You forgot the suffix '2.O'!

1224
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:15,390
Woah! So this is Emerald world, huh?

1225
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,870
Semma! Truly awesome

1226
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:22,550
Eve, doesn't this level alone
 seem different from the others?

1227
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:25,230
Looks like a horror set
for a Disney film!

1228
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:27,510
We've come all this way
Let's go and take the stone

1229
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,470
Why am I talking to myself?

1230
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,670
We are making such a huge effort
Will we get any bonus?

1231
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,750
'Aadi' discount sale is in mid-July

1232
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:38,110
I'll find out if Vasanth& Co
will give you a special offer?

1233
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:39,910
Joke, huh?

1234
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,070
Eve, did you notice something?

1235
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,510
We have been walking
on this bridge for so long

1236
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,750
But that castle is still so far away

1237
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,830
Adam, I sense something wrong here

1238
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,470
What are you saying?

1239
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,230
- Adam?
- What, Eve?

1240
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,110
- Tell me
- I think we are stuck in a loop

1241
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:00,790
- We must scoot
- What loop?

1242
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:01,990
We have to go, come

1243
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,630
Where are you going?
Don't run, di

1244
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,150
Eve, don't run, please

1245
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,470
Stop...stop

1246
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:07,990
Please stay right there

1247
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,270
Listen to me
Don't jump, Eve

1248
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,910
Hey! Eve

1249
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,071
EVE...!

1250
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,630
I told you
Shit, man

1251
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:08,790
Eve!

1252
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:12,110
What the-

1253
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,070
Hello...?

1254
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,670
Eve...?

1255
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,910
Please talk to me

1256
01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:23,551
'Bro?'

1257
01:20:27,693 --> 01:20:28,533
Bro...?

1258
01:20:29,373 --> 01:20:30,333
Bro

1259
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:35,293
Bro, you told me a story
 like 'Kadhal Koattai'

1260
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,613
And stopped suddenly

1261
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:38,733
Read all the comments

1262
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:40,013
Touching the sky!!

1263
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,693
Then what happened, bro?

1264
01:20:42,853 --> 01:20:45,493
Only later I found out, bro

1265
01:20:45,973 --> 01:20:48,093
The game won't be easy after this point

1266
01:20:48,213 --> 01:20:51,013
What we had collected
in all those levels

1267
01:20:52,453 --> 01:20:54,053
All gone!

1268
01:20:54,973 --> 01:20:56,413
On top of it all

1269
01:20:56,453 --> 01:20:57,533
Eve

1270
01:20:58,893 --> 01:21:01,253
Will she come or not?
I know she won't come

1271
01:21:01,293 --> 01:21:03,573
But...I didn't want to give up

1272
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:08,373
I got to know her in the first few weeks
we got to play the game together

1273
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:10,053
Stubborn female!

1274
01:21:10,653 --> 01:21:12,493
She has to perform a task by herself

1275
01:21:12,812 --> 01:21:14,812
Highly independent
Won't let anyone help her

1276
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:19,173
'If she changes her mind
some day and she returns-'

1277
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:31,013
I decided even if I'm not around
I should do something specially for her

1278
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,773
I think a million times
before I take a risk in the game

1279
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,533
I hunted high and low for her sake,
taking many risks in life

1280
01:21:43,693 --> 01:21:45,573
In Logam game
for her sake

1281
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:48,693
I built a sky castle for her
choosing every single brick and stone

1282
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:53,133
Singlehanded I went and got
 the Philosopher stone

1283
01:21:53,853 --> 01:21:56,453
'Everything was only for her'

1284
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:06,053
She is the reason for everything

1285
01:22:06,773 --> 01:22:10,293
That's why I'm right here
in front of you as Top 5 player

1286
01:22:11,813 --> 01:22:13,893
It's all because of her

1287
01:22:15,613 --> 01:22:17,333
All because of you, Eve

1288
01:22:20,693 --> 01:22:21,973
Eve sister

1289
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:26,093
If you are watching this video
please shower your mercy on our Adam

1290
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:28,812
I went with the flow
and said 'Kaadhal Koattai'

1291
01:22:28,853 --> 01:22:32,213
But our brother has really built
 a castle of love for you

1292
01:22:32,253 --> 01:22:34,013
He is waiting for you

1293
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:35,693
So please, just 1 day

1294
01:22:35,733 --> 01:22:36,893
Go and log in

1295
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:38,613
And see it for yourself

1296
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,533
'How long did it take to
build this castle, bro?'

1297
01:22:40,573 --> 01:22:42,453
- Vijay?
- Madam

1298
01:22:42,493 --> 01:22:43,853
Manage here
I'll be back

1299
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,293
'6 months?!
No way, bro'

1300
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:49,213
'Viewers, developers have give
 free access to all of you too'

1301
01:22:49,253 --> 01:22:51,333
'Don't miss seeing this castle of love'

1302
01:22:51,373 --> 01:22:53,053
'And also one more important thing'

1303
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:55,453
'Viewers, we need your help
even more now'

1304
01:22:55,493 --> 01:22:59,613
'Share this video to the maximum
extent possible, till it reaches Eve'

1305
01:22:59,653 --> 01:23:01,413
'And I have a soooper
piece of news for you'

1306
01:23:01,453 --> 01:23:05,413
'To enable Eve to view the castle built
by Adam Vice, Logam's creators have'

1307
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:07,573
'...reactivated Eve's account'

1308
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:10,493
'So Eve, please...please'

1309
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,933
'Go and see the castle of love
Adam has built for you'

1310
01:23:12,973 --> 01:23:15,173
'Just only once'

1311
01:23:15,213 --> 01:23:18,093
'Go and see what this young man
has created for you, Eve'

1312
01:24:02,213 --> 01:24:03,173
Akka...?

1313
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,733
Isn't he your gaming partner?

1314
01:24:17,453 --> 01:24:20,453
Akka, how happy you were
during that period

1315
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:22,253
Even I was feeling jealous

1316
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:24,253
Instead of spending time with me

1317
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:27,293
...you were with this Adam
full time in this game, sis

1318
01:24:28,653 --> 01:24:30,693
You have any idea
how mad I was at you?

1319
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,373
You know, don't you, Maya?

1320
01:24:32,413 --> 01:24:35,613
How all of us were shattered
when I was diagnosed with cancer?

1321
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:38,653
When my faith in surviving
gradually ebbed away from me

1322
01:24:38,853 --> 01:24:41,013
Just for a deviation

1323
01:24:41,213 --> 01:24:42,893
I entered this game world

1324
01:24:43,653 --> 01:24:46,933
Only in that make-believe world
I met this Adam

1325
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:50,573
He started changing me completely, Maya

1326
01:24:51,173 --> 01:24:54,333
I fell for his endearing innocence

1327
01:24:56,173 --> 01:24:57,973
Slowly, I fell in love with him too

1328
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:01,773
I wondered how I could be so happy
in an imaginary world?

1329
01:25:02,893 --> 01:25:05,253
Life, life bars

1330
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,173
Karma points

1331
01:25:07,213 --> 01:25:08,693
Death inside the game

1332
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:12,533
Here I'm going through stage 4 cancer

1333
01:25:14,533 --> 01:25:16,413
I don't want to cheat him, Maya

1334
01:25:16,893 --> 01:25:18,973
And I don't want to cheat myself

1335
01:25:19,812 --> 01:25:21,653
Why are you being so negative, akka?

1336
01:25:21,733 --> 01:25:23,973
You've always been
full of positivity

1337
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:27,413
You'll only see the positive side
in everything and everyone

1338
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:29,693
Even after regarding this game
as a positive diversion...

1339
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:32,453
...you flung aside Adam
the positive factor in your life

1340
01:25:32,813 --> 01:25:34,333
He loves me, Maya

1341
01:25:34,373 --> 01:25:36,013
Beyond it being a mere game

1342
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:37,333
SO MUCH love

1343
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:39,773
Poor thing, Maya

1344
01:25:40,493 --> 01:25:42,413
I don't want to
give him my negativity

1345
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,133
Let him have a peaceful life

1346
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:48,493
Without knowing me
or anything about me

1347
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:51,373
Just see this, akka
What he has done for you

1348
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:52,413
Please take a look

1349
01:26:22,773 --> 01:26:24,053
- Maya
- For my sake

1350
01:26:24,093 --> 01:26:26,453
Just once, take a tour inside

1351
01:26:26,533 --> 01:26:27,693
No, Maya, stop it

1352
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:30,613
- Just see once what he has done for you
- Won't you listen to me?

1353
01:27:01,213 --> 01:27:03,213
Hey! Adam is calling you

1354
01:27:03,373 --> 01:27:04,933
- Don't...don't answer
- Wait, akka

1355
01:27:04,973 --> 01:27:05,933
Hello...?

1356
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:07,933
Is that Eve?

1357
01:27:08,653 --> 01:27:11,213
- Yeah...yeah
- 'Got a message you logged in'

1358
01:27:11,253 --> 01:27:13,093
- 1 second...1 second
- Hey! No

1359
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:15,093
- No...no
- Akka, please

1360
01:27:15,373 --> 01:27:16,333
'Talk to him'

1361
01:27:16,373 --> 01:27:17,493
'Why can't you listen to me?'

1362
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:18,973
'You listen to me for a change'

1363
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:20,053
First take the phone

1364
01:27:23,053 --> 01:27:24,893
Hello...Eve?

1365
01:27:26,093 --> 01:27:27,653
'Can you hear me?'

1366
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:33,253
Hello...?

1367
01:27:33,813 --> 01:27:34,973
Eve?

1368
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:39,013
Eve?

1369
01:27:41,533 --> 01:27:43,733
Hey! Madcap, tell me

1370
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:48,853
English subtitles by rekhs

1371
01:27:53,453 --> 01:27:58,453
'Song & Dance'

1372
01:27:58,844 --> 01:28:03,004
"You kick me in your sleep
and ruin my nights"

1373
01:28:04,004 --> 01:28:08,404

and I hate the way you dress!"

1374

and also drag me in"

1375

yet you never wanna meet my friends!"

1376
01:28:18,848 --> 01:28:20,128
"Hey, show-off!"

1377
01:28:20,168 --> 01:28:25,288
"No one can tolerate your games"

1378
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:28,088
"Putting up with you is my job"

1379
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,328
"Who else have you got but me?"

1380
01:28:30,368 --> 01:28:32,688
"I can't take it! I can't sleep"

1381
01:28:32,728 --> 01:28:35,048
"But I am stuck with you..."

1382
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:38,488
"The way you look, talk, seduce, ask..."

1383
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,968

"You talkless, rockless,
tasteless, shameless..."

1387

useless, clueless..."

"Listen dude, I hate your mess!"

1390
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:33,008
Hello?

1391
01:29:37,568 --> 01:29:38,488
Hello?

1392
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,088
Unbelievable!

1393
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,088
Hello!

1394
01:29:54,648 --> 01:29:55,448
Dude...

1395
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:02,448
Hello!

1396
01:30:04,968 --> 01:30:05,648
Dude?

1397
01:30:06,927 --> 01:30:07,648
Hello?

1398
01:30:09,408 --> 01:30:10,968
Where the hell were you?

1399
01:30:11,888 --> 01:30:12,888
Right here...

1400
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,168
You were stretching, right?

1401
01:30:23,448 --> 01:30:24,848
How did you know?

1402
01:30:25,088 --> 01:30:27,208
What's wrong with you, man?

1403
01:30:27,448 --> 01:30:29,927
Can't that wait?

1404
01:30:30,688 --> 01:30:33,088
Remember, health is wealth!

1405
01:30:33,288 --> 01:30:34,328
There he goes again!

1406
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,208
What's the hurry?

1407
01:30:38,328 --> 01:30:39,888
You're jobless anyway!

1408
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,368
C'mon, man!

1409
01:30:41,968 --> 01:30:44,288
Who else can I talk to?

1410
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,808
Don't insult me.

1411
01:30:47,488 --> 01:30:49,448
Don't you usually whine to...

1412
01:30:50,328 --> 01:30:51,888
- Who?
- Wait... what's his name?

1413
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,488
Krishnakumar?

1414
01:30:54,968 --> 01:30:57,328
He's in bad shape, man.

1415
01:30:57,488 --> 01:30:58,808
No more sharing with him.

1416
01:30:59,168 --> 01:31:00,208
"Sharing?"

1417
01:31:02,048 --> 01:31:03,688
Stop talking like a girl, dude.

1418
01:31:04,048 --> 01:31:04,728
What?

1419
01:31:04,768 --> 01:31:06,048
Behave like men do.

1420
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:07,008
Oh!

1421
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:10,928
Riding all those girly scooters
has messed you guys up.

1422
01:31:11,128 --> 01:31:13,608
Dude, tell me if you
want me to stop...

1423
01:31:13,888 --> 01:31:15,808
...but don't bring in
gender politics here.

1424
01:31:16,728 --> 01:31:18,008
It's not politics.

1425
01:31:18,168 --> 01:31:19,168
It's pure sense.

1426
01:31:20,968 --> 01:31:21,648
Yes...

1427
01:31:22,248 --> 01:31:23,728
- My boss...
- Play with me!

1428
01:31:30,048 --> 01:31:32,008
...and then my wife
starts nagging me!

1429
01:31:32,048 --> 01:31:34,408
'There's no water!'
'Did you fix the bulb?'

1430
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:36,248
'Did you pay the bills?'

1431
01:31:36,528 --> 01:31:37,888
'Did you book tickets?'

1432
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,208
Things are so crazy that...

1433
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:42,208
...I sometimes
forget to eat lunch.

1434
01:31:42,848 --> 01:31:44,888
Now that Corona is wiping us out...

1435
01:31:44,927 --> 01:31:46,288
I thought they'd
give me a break...

1436
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:47,728
...but no! Nothing has changed!

1437
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:48,888
Dude, one sec...

1438
01:31:50,568 --> 01:31:53,088
Wondering how I forgot lunch
when working from home?

1439
01:31:54,648 --> 01:31:55,328
No...

1440
01:31:55,848 --> 01:31:58,248
Did you really hear me
stretching over the phone?

1441
01:31:59,168 --> 01:31:59,928
Get lost, jerk!

1442
01:32:00,368 --> 01:32:01,368
I'm not telling you!

1443
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:03,927
- Honey!
- Okay, don't.

1444
01:32:04,088 --> 01:32:04,927
Honey!

1445
01:32:05,008 --> 01:32:05,648
Peace!

1446
01:32:05,688 --> 01:32:07,008
Come, help me with this.

1447
01:32:07,408 --> 01:32:08,448
I am coming

1448
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:40,728
I'll call you back.

1449
01:33:08,528 --> 01:33:09,848
Where did it go?

1450
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:14,648
Uncle...

1451
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,088
I thought I saw a hawk.

1452
01:33:18,288 --> 01:33:20,408
I'm waiting to see
if it comes again.

1453
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:22,968
Is it a good luck thing?

1454
01:33:24,248 --> 01:33:25,368
Yes it is.

1455
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,248
- It was right here.
- Okay, uncle.

1456
01:33:27,288 --> 01:33:29,368
I had to make a call...

1457
01:33:29,408 --> 01:33:30,528
Please go ahead.

1458
01:33:30,848 --> 01:33:33,128
It's okay, uncle.
Stay if you want.

1459
01:33:33,168 --> 01:33:35,128
No problem. I was
leaving anyway.

1460
01:33:35,168 --> 01:33:36,168
Okay, uncle.

1461
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:18,528
Hello

1462
01:34:24,008 --> 01:34:24,808
Madhu

1463
01:34:26,248 --> 01:34:27,128
Hello

1464
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:35,568
Babe...

1465
01:34:36,888 --> 01:34:37,728
Babe?

1466
01:34:38,968 --> 01:34:39,928
You there?

1467
01:34:42,848 --> 01:34:44,008
Were you silent?

1468
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,328
So...

1469
01:34:48,048 --> 01:34:50,288
...I've been waiting for
your call all these days.

1470
01:34:54,888 --> 01:34:55,528
If...

1471
01:34:56,688 --> 01:34:58,968
...we were together, you
don't even have to say a word.

1472
01:34:59,168 --> 01:35:00,368
I'd have kept admiring you.

1473
01:35:05,008 --> 01:35:05,768
Hello?!

1474
01:35:06,448 --> 01:35:07,208
Babe!

1475
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:09,208
Say something.

1476
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:11,928
Do you remember…

1477
01:35:12,648 --> 01:35:13,848
...the last time we met?

1478
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,848
You were wearing that red dress.

1479
01:35:21,728 --> 01:35:24,008
You were, what everyone would
call, 'The Great Beauty'!

1480
01:35:24,528 --> 01:35:26,248
A sight to behold!

1481
01:35:28,648 --> 01:35:29,528
Yes...

1482
01:35:31,248 --> 01:35:32,328
...that's how you looked!

1483
01:35:33,288 --> 01:35:34,168
Enough...

1484
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,568
Why?

1485
01:35:39,048 --> 01:35:40,728
Why are you stopping me?

1486
01:35:41,768 --> 01:35:43,008
Is that why you called me?

1487
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,488
Enough, now.

1488
01:35:44,848 --> 01:35:46,088
Where's your wife?

1489
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,488
Why so concerned about my wife?

1490
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:54,890
Planning to join my family?

1491
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:57,730
Who do you love more:
your wife or me?

1492
01:35:58,570 --> 01:35:59,650
You, of course!

1493
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:03,130
That was quick.

1494
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,810
What's wrong with your voice?

1495
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:10,130
What happened?

1496
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:11,290
I'm sick.

1497
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,410
Take care.

1498
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:15,930
Take care of yourself.

1499
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,050
There's a pandemic
going on.

1500
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:21,610
It's the ice cream I ate
last night. I'll be fine.

1501
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:24,250
I hope you're wearing a
mask when going out.

1502
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:33,250
Where are you?

1503
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,610
At home.

1504
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,330
Where exactly?

1505
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:41,050
In my bedroom.

1506
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:42,370
Wonderful!

1507
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:44,450
Perfect!

1508
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,490
What you wearing?

1509
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:54,250
Hello?

1510
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:55,930
Where's your daughter?

1511
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:02,010
My daughter is downstairs.

1512
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,810
Don't change the topic!

1513
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:07,890
What are you wearing?

1514
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,130
Leggings...?

1515
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:12,850
Saree...?

1516
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:14,930
Or...?

1517
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:16,930
Or...?

1518
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:20,170
Say something. Please!

1519
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:23,050
Only then can I start fantasizing.

1520
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:24,650
Hello?

1521
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,090
Hello?

1522
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,850
Hello?

1523
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:32,690
Hello!

1524
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:37,730
I'll probably grow old before I
find out what you're wearing.

1525
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,210
Hang on. I'll video-call you.

1526
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:44,130
I'm not wearing a skimpy costume
So, no need for a video call.

1527
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:49,490
Hey, getting you
undressed is the whole idea.

1528
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:50,850
Then why?

1529
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:53,730
My daughter is home,
and so is my father.

1530
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:55,890
I can't strut around
half-naked, can I?

1531
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:01,210
Huh?

1532
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,370
F... father?

1533
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,770
Father? Daughter?

1534
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,570
Where exactly are you?

1535
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:34,170
It was me you were
talking to, not her.

1536
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:58,890
You want to know
how I did this, right?

1537
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,330
I had my doubts...

1538
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:03,530
...so I saved my number
under that contact.

1539
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:07,170
As for the voice...

1540
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:08,650
I used a software.

1541
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,210
I called her, pretending
to be a saleswoman.

1542
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:13,810
I recorded her voice...

1543
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:16,170
...and then the
software did the rest.

1544
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:31,570
In order to contain the
spread of Coronavirus...

1545
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:35,810
these are the best practices
everyone should be aware of.

1546
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:38,250
So please listen carefully...

1547
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:42,330
and strictly follow
these best practices.

1548
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:45,610
The best precaution...

1549
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:46,890
Would you like some water?

1550
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,210
This is painful.

1551
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:40,090
Please...

1552
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,130
Please...

1553
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,250
I screwed up.

1554
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,890
I'll even fall at your feet...

1555
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:04,130
Forgive me. Please!

1556
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:09,690
What's stopping you then?

1557
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,890
It's not serious.

1558
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:18,370
It wasn't emotional.

1559
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,330
It was just fun.

1560
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,050
Fun?!

1561
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:29,330
Wait...

1562
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:31,170
- Let go!
- Okay...Okay...

1563
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:36,690
Kuchu...

1564
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:41,610
Kuchu, we have a child.

1565
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,170
You're the mother of my child.

1566
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,010
You, me...

1567
01:41:52,370 --> 01:41:53,410
and our baby...

1568
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:55,690
...we are one.

1569
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,330
But don't you love her more?

1570
01:42:02,970 --> 01:42:03,970
No... no...

1571
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:08,850
Well...

1572
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:10,170
Wait...

1573
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,530
Wait...Wait...

1574
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:21,970
It's a mid-life crisis.

1575
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:24,650
Please understand.

1576
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,250
Babe...

1577
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:27,370
...please!

1578
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:28,810
Babe?!

1579
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:33,050
Kuchu!

1580
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:40,370
Crap!

1581
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:20,570
Shall we eat?

1582
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,090
Please inform us if any
of you have symptoms.

1583
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,370
Why do you keep
saying the same thing?!

1584
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:26,730
You'll never change!

1585
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:28,770
He's having lunch.

1586
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:36,370
"They say you have
a thousand eyes"

1587
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:44,410
"But how come you
still can't see me?"

1588
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:48,650
"My heart is melting"

1589
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:52,930
"To hold you in the
palm of my hands"

1590
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:59,770
"My words are slurring
without your presence"

1591
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:08,330
"They say you have
a thousand eyes"

1592
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:18,530
"But how come you
still can't see me?"

1593
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:06,130
Hello?

1594
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:08,850
I'm at the terrace.

1595
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:10,730
Freshen up and come here.

1596
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,810
We need to talk.

1597
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:22,810
Where are you going, daddy?

1598
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:24,770
To the terrace, baby.

1599
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:25,810
Okay!

1600
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,290
Have some tea.

1601
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,050
Could you sit over there?

1602
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,410
Please forgive me.

1603
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:56,250
It... it was my fault.

1604
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,570
Please forgive me.

1605
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:02,770
I am the one who screwed up.

1606
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,930
I'm an-

1607
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:07,170
I'm sorry.

1608
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:11,210
Well... just after we got engaged...

1609
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:13,530
I cheated on you once,
with my ex-boyfriend.

1610
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:16,450
I'll consider this as
punishment for what I did.

1611
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:19,450
But I screwed up first,
so please forgive me...

1612
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:21,810
The guilt killed me…

1613
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:24,730
I even wanted to confess
before we got married...

1614
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:26,210
...but I just couldn't.

1615
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:29,250
But only after you cheated
did I realize how painful it feels.

1616
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:14,530
How?

1617
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:17,410
Who was it?

1618
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:19,410
Kamatchi.

1619
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:20,650
Kamatchi?

1620
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:22,370
Kamatchi?!

1621
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:24,050
Kamatchi Sundaram.

1622
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:48,490
Where?

1623
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:50,330
How did it happen?

1624
01:48:51,009 --> 01:48:51,930
Well...

1625
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:53,450
I... I...

1626
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:54,410
No! No!

1627
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:56,810
Don't tell me.

1628
01:48:59,050 --> 01:48:59,810
Don't...

1629
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:04,810
You...

1630
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:40,130
"All the truths you
were too shy to tell me..."

1631
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:45,930
"Here I am on stage,
singing them aloud..."

1632
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:51,090
"All the lies you
lovingly hid from me..."

1633
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:56,810
"I stole them while
you were asleep..."

1634
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:03,890
"Speaking the truth
hurts but..."

1635
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:08,290
"Time will heal that pain..."

1636
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:15,010
"Lies sound sweeter but..."

1637
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:19,050
"Time will ruin the
relationship..."

1638
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:24,450
"All the truths you were
too shy to tell me..."

1639
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:30,330
"Here I am on stage,
singing them aloud..."

1640
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:35,610
Wow, your mask is so cool!

1641
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:37,370
It's new, grandpa!

1642
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,530
Your husband, ma'am?

1643
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:42,050
He was working late.

1644
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:43,450
Can you come back tomorrow?

1645
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:45,210
Sure, ma'am.

1646
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:46,490
Thanks.

1647
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:14,530
8-Bit...

1648
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:15,130
Yes, bro?

1649
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:16,730
I need to hack a profile.

1650
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:18,770
Individual or a company?

1651
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:20,410
Individual...

1652
01:51:21,009 --> 01:51:21,930
Who is it, bro?

1653
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:23,050
Dude!

1654
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:25,490
They have to know...

1655
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,090
My wife...

1656
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:29,770
Oh... okay.

1657
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:32,650
Do you want us to skim
the surface or dig deep?

1658
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:37,090
Dig as deep as you can. I
need every single detail.

1659
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:40,690
Okay, bro. Give me seven hours.

1660
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:59,050
What was that noise?

1661
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:00,010
Nothing, uncle.

1662
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:07,410
The hackers have
completed the report.

1663
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:08,770
The package has been delivered.

1664
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:10,810
We've sent you an email ID
and password.

1665
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:11,810
Take a look, bro.

1666
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:07,650
Come. Sit down.

1667
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:22,930
- What...?
- Here.

1668
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:02,050
What kind of game is this?

1669
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,890
How can you lie
about such things?

1670
01:54:07,810 --> 01:54:08,970
I know you're mad at me…

1671
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:10,770
...but this is too much.

1672
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:19,090
I checked with all your
friends and relatives.

1673
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:21,770
I'm not proud of it...

1674
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,290
...but there is no harm.

1675
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:28,050
You've never had a
boyfriend called Kamatchi.

1676
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:32,530
The only Kamatchi was three
years your senior in college...

1677
01:54:33,009 --> 01:54:34,650
...and he doesn't
even know your name.

1678
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,850
Punish me all you want...

1679
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:42,730
...but this is just too much.

1680
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:48,410
Please forgive me.

1681
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:52,450
I promise I'll never
betray you again.

1682
01:54:53,610 --> 01:54:54,650
Please forgive me.

1683
01:54:58,730 --> 01:54:59,570
Okay...

1684
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:04,810
What do you mean, 'okay'?

1685
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:08,570
Let's forgive each other.

1686
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:11,650
To hell with your forgiveness!

1687
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:24,770
Why lie about such things
just to get back at me?

1688
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:29,370
It's a lie, isn't it?

1689
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:31,410
Tell me.

1690
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:37,490
Fine... let's just forget
this and move on.

1691
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:43,490
Hey!

1692
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,290
Forget?

1693
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:50,650
What do you want me to forget?

1694
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:54,450
I just told you that I checked
thoroughly and found nothing.

1695
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:57,370
Why can't you agree with me?

1696
01:55:58,250 --> 01:55:59,450
Say 'Yes' before you go.

1697
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:02,290
Yes.

1698
01:56:08,009 --> 01:56:09,450
Where do you think you're going?

1699
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,050
Okay...

1700
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:19,090
What's your problem?

1701
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:21,130
Want me to go crazy?

1702
01:56:22,570 --> 01:56:23,810
Look at me!

1703
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:25,450
I haven't slept for two days!

1704
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:29,210
I've been losing my
mind, trying to find this guy!

1705
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:34,090
I even called up my friend
and told him about this.

1706
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,730
Such things can't even
be shared with friends.

1707
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:38,930
With his help, I got the best hackers.

1708
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:41,130
I searched for all the
KamatchiSundarams...

1709
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:42,730
...in your school, college
and neighbourhood.

1710
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,730
I searched everywhere
and finally found one guy!

1711
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:46,530
Turns out he was
your college senior.

1712
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:49,490
I then called him and asked if he
really was in a relationship with you.

1713
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:52,250
Despite all my threats,
he kept denying it...

1714
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:53,250
...and yet I'm not at peace!

1715
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:55,930
Was it really Kamatchi
Sundaram or someone else...

1716
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:07,290
If I'm supposed to live with you
after knowing you cheated on me...

1717
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:09,810
...can't you live without knowing
if I've cheated on you or not?

1718
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:40,730
Kuchu...

1719
01:58:41,010 --> 01:58:41,770
Kuchu...

1720
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:47,490
Kuchu, wait. I want to talk
 to you. Please!

1721
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:48,490
I want to talk.

1722
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:50,850
- I want to talk to you.
- What do you want to talk about?

1723
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,090
I don't know.

1724
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:57,650
You want to know
the truth, right?

1725
01:58:57,690 --> 01:59:00,770
No! No! The lesson you taught me in
the past two days is more than enough.

1726
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:02,050
Forgive me. Please!

1727
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:44,130
Kuchu dear!

1728
01:59:46,845 --> 01:59:48,027
Kuchu dear!
