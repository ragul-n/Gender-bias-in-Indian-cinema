1
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,666
1965. 
Thrissur.

2
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,458
Porinju!

3
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,666
Porinju!

4
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,250
Porinju! Hey!

5
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,416
I am here, Jose!

6
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,041
Maria is coming!

7
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,666
What happened?

8
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,958
Did you tell Maria? 
- No.

9
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,708
Shucks! 
- I came back.

10
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,666
She is on the way, 
with her friends.

11
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,125
Here she comes.

12
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,166
You say it yourself.

13
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,375
No way!

14
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,958
Porinju, Maria is coming.

15
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,958
She is alone. 
This is the best time to say it.

16
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,791
Dude, you say it.

17
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,375
No! That won't work. 
You say it yourself.

18
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,583
Haven't you seen PremNazir saying 
this to Sheela in the movies?

19
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,833
Say it like that.

20
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,916
If she doesn't like it, 
it will be a shame, right?

21
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,708
That's true. 
Then we can't face her.

22
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,416
Not just you. 
Me too!

23
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,375
She feeds us in plenty if we go to 
her house when her dad isn't there.

24
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,916
Don't put an end to that!

25
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,708
Isn't she from a rich house? 
And me?

26
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,750
Then you become rich and say it!

27
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,083
I was happily sitting at home, 
listening to my dad playing the band!

28
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,125
Get lost!

29
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,125
Hey Maria!

30
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
What are you both doing here?

31
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,875
Are you smoking?

32
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,958
No!

33
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,833
How's your choir singing going? 
- It's going on.

34
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,416
If it's bad, I'll boo, okay?

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,125
Yeah right! 
Try booing!

36
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,375
I'll show you!

37
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,333
What's that fishy look, Porinju?

38
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,875
It's your dad who 
has a fishy look!

39
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,083
Hey! Look there!

40
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
It's Velankanni 
Mother Mary's idol.

41
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,791
It's for the Chapel at our market.

42
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,541
It's from my dad.

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,416
Hey! Say it if you want to.

44
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,875
What is it? 
- Nothing.

45
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,041
Say it!

46
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,083
Get lost!

47
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,291
Ah! Now you mess with me!

48
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,083
What is it, Jose? 
- He will say it himself.

49
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,583
Wait. 
I'm also coming.

50
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,875
Porinju!

51
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,791
Maria!

52
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,375
It's time.

53
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,791
Where is she?

54
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,250
She's not coming!

55
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,208
Maria, are you coming?

56
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,125
Hey Maria!

57
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,791
What is it, dad? 
- Wait!

58
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,125
Just a minute. 
I'll come now.

59
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Her dad!

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,291
What is it, dad?

61
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,708
Wait. I'll drop you to 
the school in my car.

62
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,750
It's already late. The bell will ring. 
I'm going. - Stop there!

63
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,958
Are you going to school 
with these scoundrels?

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,333
Why are you talking 
like this, dad?

65
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,916
I will talk!

66
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
Dad, they will hear you. 
Say it softly!

67
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,333
I'm saying this so 
that they can hear it.

68
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,791
When did you come after going to sing 
Choir in the Church last Sunday?

69
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,791
Well...

70
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,541
Your friends told me...

71
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,833
... that you were 
talking to these guys.

72
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,916
Dad!

73
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:06,083
His forefathers are the kind who used to step 
away when they see people from Alappatt.

74
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,291
Do you know that?

75
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,291
What are you staring at? 
Run away!

76
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,250
Come!

77
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,291
Get into the car!

78
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,708
Ouseph, open the gate!

79
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,083
Jose, would Maria have reached?

80
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,750
She left in the car, right?

81
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,125
She would have 
reached long back!

82
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll be giving big trouble to 
that Alappatt Varghese soon!

83
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,000
No, dude! 
He is our Maria's father, right?

84
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,416
You and your father-in-law!

85
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,291
Where are these earrings from? 
They are really pretty.

86
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,666
I bought this from the town.

87
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,041
From the town? 
Is it from Sait's shop?

88
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,166
Yes. Near the Church...

89
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,375
What are you doing, boy? 
Give it to me.

90
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,458
You look really beautiful 
even if you don't wear this.

91
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,625
Give it back to me! 
- If you want it so badly,

92
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,916
I'll put it on you. 
- Hit him, Porinju!

93
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,958
You...!!

94
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,250
Leave me. 
- You'll take flowers from girls' heads?

95
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,791
I will. 
What will you do?

96
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,041
I will show you! 
- Kick him, Porinju!

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,041
What are your legs for?

98
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,250
Hit him on his head, Porinju!

99
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,250
What are you looking at? 
Punch him on his face!

100
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,583
Did you see that, Maria?

101
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,375
Porinju is hitting him for you...

102
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,958
Hey! Stop it!

103
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,083
I won't allow such 
hooliganism in my school!

104
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,541
Come here, both of you!

105
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,916
I will sort you both today!

106
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,041
Sit down!

107
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,708
Sit!

108
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,291
What is your name?

109
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,708
Paul.

110
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,333
Father's name? 
- Joseph.

111
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,750
Which Joseph? 
- Malakkaran Joseph.

112
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,416
So you are Joseph's son? 
- Yes.

113
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,250
What about you?

114
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,708
Porinju. 
- Father's name?

115
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,375
Joy. 
- Which Joy?

116
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,166
Master, 'Beedi' Joy.

117
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
You are 'Beedi' Joy's son?

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,666
I will handle you later. 
- No wonder!

119
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,208
Are you coming to the school 
to study or to be a goon?

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
Move away!

121
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,208
Master, he started it.

122
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Sit down!

123
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,833
This guy...

124
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,333
... should be beaten to pulp!

125
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,541
You..!! 
- Why are you hitting me alone?

126
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,625
I'll decide that!

127
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:40,958
Leave my hand!

128
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,041
You...!!

129
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,000
You will enter my class again 
only when I let you!

130
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,458
Go and sit!

131
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
He has come to study, it seems!

132
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,875
To spoil the rest of the kids as well.

133
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,208
Where are you going? 
- Get lost!

134
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,666
Silence!

135
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,375
Porinju! Wait. 
I'm also coming.

136
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,916
Headmaster, it seems!

137
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,375
He doesn't like us!

138
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,958
We're not rich, right?

139
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,875
Come, dude. 
- You go and sit.

140
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,833
Where did we stop during 
last week's special class?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,416
The 8th Chapter, Master.

142
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,583
Master!

143
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,375
What have you done?

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,625
What? - Porinju is the best 
student of this class.

145
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,625
So?

146
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,250
Do you find the culprits looking at the 
family name? - Do you also want a beating?

147
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,041
Master, Maria is from Alappatt house.

148
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Sit down.

149
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,666
Those who are interested in studying, 
pay attention here.

150
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,375
Or you can plough fields 
and ride buffalo carts!

151
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,791
For your entire life!

152
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,666
What is it?

153
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,041
Master!

154
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,083
No! Don't do it. 
Master is going for a wedding!

155
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,125
Don't do it.

156
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,666
Don't do it, son.

157
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,083
No! 
Don't do it.

158
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,416
Yuck!

159
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,416
You ruined my clothes!

160
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,208
Damn kids!

161
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,541
Let me see how you're going to 
write the 10th grade exams!

162
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,458
Bloody beggars!

163
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,750
Throw him into the marsh, Porinju!

164
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,041
Oh no!

165
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,208
Oh my God!

166
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,583
I'll put an end to your studies!

167
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,958
I'll show you how I'm 
going to ruin your lives!

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,458
Get lost!

169
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,541
Come, Porinju!

170
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,083
Let him lie there in 
the marsh for a while!

171
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,208
Porinju!

172
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,916
What happened, Porinju?

173
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,125
Are you sad that you 
can't go to school?

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,333
I've quit studies, Maria.

175
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,541
I've been saying this 
to you for a long time!

176
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,041
What all do we study?

177
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,083
Love, peace... 
Do we get any of this?

178
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,958
Don't worry, Porinju.

179
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,083

00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,125
Among them, the 
bamboo fight in '79.

355
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,416
That was historic!

356
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,416
Bamboo fight?

357
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
What's that?

358
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,833
Around 10-11 people 
came from Nedupuzha.

359
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,791
They surrounded Iype's car.

360
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,000
At the Church ground.

361
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,833
It was about some money deal.

362
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,583
People were all waiting for the 
'Arrow' festival to start.

363
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,666
Then? 
- And what did Iype do?

364
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,708
He just stood there, 
leaning on his car.

365
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,375
The people knew where the 
fight would start from!

366
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,125
They stopped all the celebrations, 
and gathered to watch.

367
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,208
Iype ettan...

368
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,458
What should we do now?

369
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,083
Are you coming with us?

370
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,791
Or should we tie up your hands & legs, 
and carry you away?

371
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,375
You won't be able to 
lift this Iype, kids!

372
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Hey Porinju!

373
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,833
Send them away!

374
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,708
Shouldn't we have a blast after that?

375
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:32,958
On one side,

376
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,041
11 mighty goons.

377
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,708
On the other side, 
Porinju.

378
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,750
Who will win?

379
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,958
If it's Bruce Lee, 
he would win.

380
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,708
Hey kiddo! 
This is not a movie!

381
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,083
It's Porinju's fight!

382
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,208
Bamboo fight!

383
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,375
Hey Thomas!

384
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,250
Play the band!

385
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,833
Hey Porinju!

386
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,083
What did you say?

387
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,750
That you'll carry 
Iype ettan away?

388
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:26,875
Iype ettan!

389
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,541
What should I do with him?

390
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,458
Let him go, Porinju!

391
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
Get lost!

392
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,916
Come here!

393
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,125
Shouldn't we have a blast? 
- Of course!

394
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,958
Iype Etta!

395
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,416
Porinju's fight on Iype's command.

396
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,916
That's the routine.

397
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,208
What do I say!

398
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,625
Iype grew really big!

399
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,666
Porinju will die for Iype and his family!

400
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,458
And Iype also holds Porinju 
in such high regard.

401
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,333
In between this, 
what I was about to say...

402
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:18,333
... was about the incident that happened 
during the last Church festival.

403
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,083
Do you know what happened then?

404
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,583
Some more?

405
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,208
Sit down, Chechi.

406
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,375
Alice, you serve it.

407
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,416
You sit there. I will serve.

408
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,875
I come here only once 
in a while, right?

409
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,291
This makes me happy!

410
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,291
Tresya!

411
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,958
Tresya! 
- Yes!

412
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,083
Get some beef curry.

413
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Susanna!

414
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:40,583
What is it, dad?

415
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,083
Where is Prince?

416
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,666
I don't know. I saw him leaving 
with his camera on his neck.

417
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,625
Dad...

418
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:50,750
His daddy took him to Dubai thinking that 
he would be of help in our business.

419
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,791
Now he only has time to solve the 
problems created by this fellow!

420
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,750
What do we do if this 
boy goes on like this?

421
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,625
His age is such, right?

422
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,208
Shall we get him married?

423
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,000
This hotheadedness 
might cool down.

424
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,041
And should I see the tears 
of that girl as well?

425
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,625
Is he so bad?

426
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,708
Then let him stay with 
me here for a few days.

427
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,875
I will sort him out. 
- No way!

428
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,666
He has to go back to Dubai, dad. 
- Chechi...

429
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,875
Didn't you yourself say that 
he's creating trouble there?

430
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,583
Now it's like he wants to 
sit on his father's lap,

431
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,666
and drink milk from 
his mother's breasts!

432
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,583
Where is my Porinju?

433
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,208
Has he eaten anything?

434
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,166
Hey Porinju!

435
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,416
He is there under the 
Christmas tree, grandpa.

436
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,041
Why are you calling 
him here now, dad?

437
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,083
To make him sit here?

438
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,458
Hey Susanna...

439
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,458

curry in a plate.

00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,250
So Yesudas is doing a concert 
all alone over here?

443

Iype Etta...

444
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,083
Look!

445
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,666
That's my Maria.

446
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,000
True. 
- Right?

447
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,666
It's quite fair, 
like her.

448
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,000
It's been such a long wait!

449
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,750
Is it going to happen?

450
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,458
Iype Etta, there's a 
tree between me and her.

451
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:44,333
Her dad, Alappatt Varghese, 
is hanging on its branch.

452
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,625
Until she forgets that sight, 
she won't come.

453
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,375
Hey! Let her come 
when she wants to.

454
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,041
You come with me.

455
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,708
My tongue could feel 
something only now!

456
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,916
Hey! Once dad's time is over, we shouldn't 
let that scoundrel into these premises.

457

Here comes sir!

460

He is our Susanna's son. 
Prince.

461
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,250
I've carried him around!

462
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,750
He has become really 
handsome now.

463
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,875
He's totally unruly!

464
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,708
That will be all 
right with maturity.

465
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:49,166
He went to see the festival, and he's 
coming back as if his bottom is on fire!

I'm feeling tired. Let me sit for 
some time. You continue dancing!

00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,500
Come... 
- This rascal...

534
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,041
Wasn't he leaving? 
Then why did you kick him?

535
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,833
Porinju! 
- Wasn't he leaving?

536
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,625
Then why did you kick him? 
- Porinju, no!

537
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,208
Wasn't he leaving?

538
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,750
Then why did you kick him?

539
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:00,833
Leave him!

540
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,083
Porinju!

541
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Jose, don't go!

542
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,750
Stop it, boys!

543
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,916
Run! Go hide in your kitchen!

544
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,208
Hey! Hey! 
Iype ettan!

545
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,000
Alice, stop. 
- Rafael Etta...

546
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,041
Dad will handle it.

547
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,666
Grandpa, call the police.

548
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:49,791
Police?

549
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,125
What police?

550
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,958
If you're born to a single father, 
come out!

551
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,625
Don't say that. 
Isn't it insulting to our Iype ettan?

552
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,375
What else do I say? 
I should say something, right?

553
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,416
Hey Porinju!

554
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,750
Wait & watch!

555
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,333
We'll see during the next festival!

556
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,833
Come on, Prince.

557
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,625
Come.

558
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,083
Hey Porinju!

559
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,000
Have a drink and go!

560
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,208
See! That's my Iype ettan!

561
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,333
I'll be right back.

562
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,666
Iype Etta!

563
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,250
No grudge between us, okay?

564
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,750
Shall I go?

565
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,708
Shall we go? 
- Okay.

566
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,125
Even if you say that the 
world is coming to an end,

567
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,625
everyone else in this world will 
come only after Jose, for Porinju.

568
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,166
So that's why those coffins 
were given to them!

569
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,208
So, there will be a battle for 
this festival, definitely.

570
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,458
Iype used to love Porinju more 
than his own children, apparently.

571
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,500
What Porinju did was nasty!

572
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,375
Iype must have felt really sad.

573
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,916
He was so fond of Porinju!

574
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,375
You will only take sides 
with the rich always!

575
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,666
Should Porinju just watch while 
his friend is being beaten up?

576
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,375
That Prince is the reason for all this.

577
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,666
He won't step into Thrissur again. 
He got beaten up that badly!

578
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,500
No! 
He will come.

579
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:22,833
Wait and watch!

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,500
No! He won't come for this festival.

581
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,916
I have told him.

582
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,166
Blood boils at his age, right? 
- Phew!

583
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,375
I am relieved!

584
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:34,500
Hey! The news of the coffins being 
sent, is the talk of the town now.

585
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,500
What are Stephen and 
Rafael planning?

586
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,833
Go and ask them!

587
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:40,666
Iype Etta, I've lost my sleep.

588
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:44,541
I just want this festival to get 
over somehow. My Mother Mary!

589
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,958
Long Live the Revolution!

590
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,791
Revolution is about to arrive.

591
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,583
Capitalist powers are waiting 
for the right opportunity.

592
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,625
They are vengeful.

593
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,833
Isn't that our Bolshevik Paily? 
- Yes.

594
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,416
I haven't seen him in a while.

595
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,708
Saying that American spies 
are coming to kill him,

596
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,500
he was hiding somewhere.

597
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,208
Like Bolsheviks to the 
Russian Empire...

598
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,875
Comrade Porinju & Comrade Jose 
jostled into Iype's bungalow.

599
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,000
They wouldn't have forgotten that.

600
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,833
What to do!

601
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,208
He was a good guy!

602
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:17,416
He became like this reading 
so many unnecessary books.

603
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Sad!

604
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,375
Xavi...

605
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,375
Give these 1.5 kgs to Johnson. 
- Okay.

606
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,083
Hey Porinju!

607
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:37,416
Iype ettan!

608
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,208
I got the coffin!

609
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,666
Porinju, how's your 
business going?

610
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,458
Did you buy the buffalo 
for the festival?

611
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,000
A great item is coming, Iype Etta.

612
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,916
How many kilos? 
- 700.

613
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,875
Oh my God! 
Is it an elephant or what?

614
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,833
Yes. Watch while I bring 
it for the procession!

615
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,333
Here. 
Eat it.

616
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,333
He'll eat food only 
from our house.

617
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,708
Pedigree!

618
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,791
Shall I leave, Porinju?

619
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,208
I brought him out for a walk.

620
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,541
Come.

621
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,375
Come. 
You eat it.

622
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,583
Vegetables are so 
costly now, right?

623
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,500
I pick up the ones that 
fall from the sack...

624
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:31,541
Iype Etta...

625
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,625
Iype Etta.. 
- No, man.

626
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:33,958
I'm not about to die yet.

627
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,166
I'll let you know when I am.

628
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,291
It's not that, Iype Etta.

629
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,750
You could have bought 
the coffins from me.

630
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,458
My kids also have to be fed, right?

631
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,541
Who will make the coffin for him?

632
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,375
Porinju Etta...

633
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,750
Porinju Etta...

634
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,375
What is it, Anto?

635
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,250
You ran out with your 
bride after the wedding?

636
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,833
We ran out, Porinju Etta.

637
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,208
But the wedding 
didn't happen yet.

638
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,750
By then, her dad and his people came there, 
and created a ruckus.

639
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,625
They are saying that they 
will leave only with her.

640
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,666
I won't go.

641
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,041
I want my Anto Chettan!

642
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:03,875
Then what's the problem?

643
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,333
You go back!

644
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,791
Did you recognize them, Xavi? 
- No.

645
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:11,333
It's the daughter of 
Devassy from West Fort.

646
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,333
That guy stole her from there.

647
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,166
The girl is nice!

648
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,291
It's a lottery for the guy!

649
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:19,125
They've locked up Father 
Irumban inside the Church.

650
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,125
We're coming after giving a 
complaint at the station.

651
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:22,708
Then there's no problem.

652
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,708
S.I. Avaran will come 
and bring Father out.

653
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,750
You go back. 
- Come with us, Porinju Etta.

654
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,500
Will your dad give the 
meat for them then?

655
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,166
Wedding is more important 
than meat, right?

656
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,125
Wedding is for meat only, right?

657
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,125
You rascal!

658
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,416
If you say such jokes, 
I'll chop you up!

659
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,458
Get lost!

660
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,000
There's meat to feed an 
entire district in your body!

661
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Porinju Etta...

662
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:45,833
You go, Anto.

663
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,791
Come, Chetta. 
Let's go.

664
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,583
The police would have 
reached there now.

665
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,583
Xavi! 
- Yes.

666
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,083
Did Johnettan bring the 
money for the meat?

667
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,416
Don't give him even a piece of meat, 
until he pays!

668
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,833
Let's go.

669
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,916
He's messing with this 
Devassy's family!

670
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,041
Bloody scoundrels!

671
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,083
Vareeth, don't let anyone 
inside the Church.

672
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,083
Who are these guys?

673
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:10,083
That scoundrel's people, 
from the colony.

674
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:13,791
Police is here. None of your games 
will work with Avaran sir, Devassy!

675
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Sir...

676
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,041
Avaran sir...

677
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,083
Arrest them, sir.

678
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,375
What?

679
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,791
Well sir, we'll get lunch only after 
the wedding, right? That's why.

680
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,833
Get lost!

681
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,791
Namaste. - What is this, Devassy Etta? 
Hooliganism in front of the Church?

682
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,458
Look, sir.

683
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,250
Here they are!

684
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
The police is here.

685
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,833
She is my daughter.

686
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,208
She likes beggars now. 
She doesn't want us now.

687
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,625
Sir, they have locked up Father 
Irumban inside the Church.

688
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,666
Ask them to open the door, sir.

689
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,291
I told him decently...

690
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,250
Then he's acting 
holier than Christ!

691
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,958
Be it a Father or a Saint, 
they will learn only when they are hurt!

692
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,083
Let him sit there in the 
confession box for a while.

693
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,416
Do you feel like 
making a confession?

694
00:43:58,958 --> 00:43:59,958
No!

695
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,291
We have our own Church and 
our own Father for that.

696
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,625
Whichever be the Parish,

697
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,458
a sin is a sin!

698
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,041
So be it.

699
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,041
Didn't he threaten you 
& take you away, dear?

700
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,708
No. I'm in love 
with Anto Chettan.

701
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,750
Anto Chettan!

702
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:13,791
One slap I'll give you!

703
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,208
I should be blamed for 
sending you to study!

704
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,875
Son, aren't you God-fearing?

705
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,458
No, Father.

706
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,958
May the angels guide 
you to the light.

707
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,416
Porinju!

708
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,750
You'll grow tired of picking 
stones from ration rice.

709
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,625
You better go back 
with your dad.

710
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,375
Sir, don't be so sadistic!

711
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:51,458
Shut up!

712
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
I'll punch you...

713
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,125
Why are you taking me?

714
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,166
What wrong did I do? 
- Come here.

715
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,458
Come here. 
- Leave me.

716
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,208
Tell him not to 
take her away, sir.

717
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,416
Leave me.

718
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:04,625
Sir, please.

719
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:07,333
If he takes her away now, I'll never 
be able to see her in my life again.

720
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,666
Aren't you being greedy?

721
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,125
Can't you marry a girl 
of your own stature?

722
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,541
Sir.. .Sir... 
Lily!

723
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:15,458
Police should stop the injustice!

724
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,333
Get lost! 
- Don't you dare come forward!

725
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,958
Move away!

726
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,958
Please, dad! Please! 
- Walk!

727
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Hey!

728
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,083
Anto Chetta!

729
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:24,833
Leave her!

730
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,750
Porinju, no!

731
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,458
You have nothing to do with this. 
- Leave her hand.

732
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,083
Leave her hand!

733
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,083
Anto!

734
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,708
Hey Devassy!

735
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,750
Haven't I told you several times 
not to make your children cry?

736
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,750
Those who love each other, 
are God's children.

737
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,250
Don't try to separate them.

738
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,833
Why have you come for 
such a shameful job?

739
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,666
We didn't know that this was 
your fort, Porinju Etta.

740
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:01,708
Now you know, right?

741
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,750
Get going then!

742
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,875
Hey Porinju! 
- You shut up!

743
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,500
I'll come to your 
house & kick you!

744
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:07,666
Who took you into the police?

745
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,541
A policeman's job is not to 
lick the feet of the rich!

746
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:11,833
See you!

747
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,708
Fathers like him 
always create trouble!

748
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:14,833
Go sit at the back!

749
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,750
Hey! Ruin your life, and then 
come back calling ' Dad'!

750
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,750
I won't come, dad. 
- Let's see. - That was awesome.

751
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,375
Hey Anto! Take good care of her. 
- Of course!

752
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,750
Sir, I'll give it back to you 
in the night for hitting me!

753
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,291
Move away! 
- You go now!

754
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,916
Thank you, Porinju!

755
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,083
What you did was a noble deed.

756
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,708
I don't need any 
blessings, Father.

757
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,583
I can understand their grief.

758
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,166
Love...

759
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,291
If we don't get that, 
we won't be ourselves.

760
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,041
Everything goes for a toss then!

761
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,500
Ouseph, Maria is here.

762
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,125
She reached?

763
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:23,250
Don't hurry, Ouseph Etta. 
You can reach here even if you walk.

764
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:25,958
Are the collections over?

765
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,500
Yes, Maria chechi.

766
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,083
Only 2 people are dilly-dallying  
when I ask them.

767
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:33,000
Who? - That 'Bier' Vincent 
and 'Hill products' Yohannan.

768
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,125
'Hill Produce Sales'

769
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:38,791
Oh no!

770
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,916
I'll pay today's sum tomorrow 
along with tomorrow's, Maria.

771
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,333
Yohannan!

772
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:48,250
What's the guarantee that you 
and I would be around tomorrow?

773
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,958
So isn't it better to do what has 
to be done today, today itself?

774
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,958
You have money to buy 
cake for your kid, is it?

775
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,208
Eat it, dear.

776
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,458
Yohannan!

777
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,208
I'll come again tomorrow.

778
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,375
I'll give it tomorrow.

779
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,000
We'll come again tomorrow.

780
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,125
Stop fooling around & pay up! 
- Ouseph Etta, come!

781
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,375
Coming!

782
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:19,875
Hey 'Bier'!

783
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,791
I'll pay after the festival, Maria.

784
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,250
I'm not talking about the 
prime fund, you cheat!

785
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,666
I'm asking you for the interest!

786
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,583
The sales is quite bad, Maria.

787
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,125
If I change this board and 
write 'Coffins for sale',

788
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,791
I'll reap profits. That's 
what an astrologer told me.

789
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,250
Do you even know 
what you're saying?

790
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,916
Reap profits? 
People dying is profit for you?

791
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,083
It's not that! 
What else can I do?

792
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,666
I don't know any other job!

793
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,708
Look over there!

794
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,541
Jose, where are you 
going with the coffin?

795
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,875
For the matinee show at Bindu theatre. 
Coming?

796
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,500
Why are you keeping it here?

797
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,375
Hey! I've sold this to you.

798
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,416
I'm wondering how to sell the 
ones that are already here!

799
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,083
Vincent, my friend,

800
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,416
it's a first class coffin!

801
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,750
Just give me half the money!

802
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,250
Is that enough? 
Are you sure?

803
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,583
I'm seeing someone selling his own 
coffin for money, for the first time!

804
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:27,666
Hey Maria!

805
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,125
So you saw me?

806
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,541
Of course! Shouldn't we have a 
blast for this year's festival?

807
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,333
I've learned some new steps. 
Check them out.

808
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:37,125
[Singing 'I am a Disco Dancer']

809
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,708
Your younger brother 
Babu needn't see this!

810
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,833
He is jealous!

811
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,416
Can he do 4 steps of disco 
like this, ever in his life?

812
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,791
What are you saying? 
- What is this? Ghost dance?

813
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,541
If I slap you on both your ears, 
you'll hear a siren!

814
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,333
Do you want brandy, Jose?

815
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:05,666
What? 
What did you say?

816
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,375
Brandy! 
Brandy!

817
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,583
Vincent, my friend...

818
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,666
I'll get the money from you later. 
Keep it ready. Come on!

819
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,583
Come on! 
The sun is about to set!

820
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:14,666
Give it.

821
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,208
This thing is not like our arrack.

822
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:35,583
However much I drink, 
I'm not getting high!

823
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,416
I think it's all evaporating!

824
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,333
You drink as much as 
you want to, Jose.

825
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,375
But don't pass out on the road.

826
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,666
Maria...

827
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,500
Passing out on the road 
after getting drunk...

828
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:49,083
Jose doesn't do that. 
Neither does my father Anthony!

829
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,083
Keep that in mind!

830
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,375
Okay then!

831
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:55,833
Well, Jose!

832
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,458
What about the coffin 
that Porinju got?

833
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:58,583
What did he do with it?

834
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:03,833
Porinju...

835
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,583
Hey! Stop laughing and tell 
me the matter, you moron!

836
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,000
The coffin that Porinju got? 
- Yes.

837
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,541
Dad!

838
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,750
Dad!

839
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,291
Why the hell are you lying in this?

840
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,333
Get up! 
Get up, I say!

841
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,125
I need this coffin, Porinju!

842
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,875
I won't give it to you!

843
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,041
Maria...

844
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,625
Hey Maria...

845
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,541
You know how much Porinju 
loves this smile of yours?

846
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,083
Well, is he irresponsible for your 
dad hanging himself to death?

847
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,625
I mean, responsible...

848
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,708
Damn it...

849
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,583
Why are you crucifying him like this?

850
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:13,625
Maria!

851
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:16,375
If you spoil the honour 
of Alappatt house,

852
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,250
I swear, I'll jump!

853
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,708
My word is final!

854
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,333
You know me, right?

855
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:26,791
Maria!

856
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,625
If you spoil the honour 
of Alappatt house,

857
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,458
I swear I'll jump!

858
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,583
Definitely!

859
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:34,166
This is Alappatt Varghese's word.

860
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,958
Why is he going on saying 'Alappatt'?

861
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:40,666
Dear, I raised you with so much love!

862
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,541
Don't leave your father & 
go with these beggars!

863
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:50,000
No, Maria. 
I will jump, I swear!

864
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,125
Come here, Maria. 
He's just scaring you in vain!

865
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,041
Maria, if you take a step further,

866
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:03,541
I will jump! 
I will definitely jump!

867
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,291
Porinju...

868
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,375
Will that moron jump for real? 
- No way!

869
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:09,958
Are you coming? 
- Maria!

870
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,666
Go inside, dear.

871
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,166
Your dear father is saying this! 
- Dear father?

872
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,250
Go back inside!

873
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,041
Damn it...

874
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,208
These ants are biting 
all over my body.

875
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,916
Oh no! 
- Oh no!

876
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,208
Dad!

877
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,500
Dad!

878
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,333
Dad!

879
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,666
Your dad didn't jump!

880
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,583
He fell down because ants bit him! 
I saw it!

881
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,750
I swear, Maria.

882
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:01,916
If I see someone crying, 
I will feel sad.

883
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:02,958
I'm leaving.

884
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,333
Dad!

885
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,333
Jose is leaving!

886
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,458
Bloody mango tree!

887
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,291
You are the reason for all this!

888
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,166
Let the wedding happen.

889
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,875
I'll uproot you!

890
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,583
Mom!

891
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,375
Here comes the chariot!

892
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:43,458
Chariot?

893
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:46,666
He's measuring the length & 
breadth of the road, mom!

894
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:49,416
Will the chariot go down the drain? 
- Get lost!

895
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,375
He has reached!

896
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,333
Oops! Mithun Chakraborty! 
- Yes.

897
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,500
Daddy! 
- Yes, my dear Minimol...

898
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,541
Daddy's sweet-heart! 
- Daddy!

899
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,416
Did you buy the new 
comic book?

900
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,875
Oh no! Comic book...?

901
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,708
Comic book... 
I bought it!

902
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,750
Hey Babu!

903
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:10,958
A new bicycle?

904
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,875
Let me go for a round. 
- Don't touch it.

905
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:14,333
I saved up to buy it.

906
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,708
'The city of Hippies, 
the city of liquor bottles'

907
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:22,375
Hey! Hey! Mom, ask this moron 
not to ruin my bicycle!

908
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:25,041
Jose, come here. 
Don't make the boy cry!

909
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,250
My bicycle! 
- Mom!

910
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,583
Come here! 
- Get lost!

911
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,166
Tell me the rest of the 
story of that movie!

912
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,583
Which one was it, mom?

913
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:34,416
I forgot it.

914
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,083
That Master finding a girl.

915
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,166
Girl who lost her memory!

916
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,208
Oh! 'Moondram Pirai'  
[Tamil movie]

917
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:45,500
You told me till the part where she 
boards the train to go back home.

918
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,791
I told you till then, right? 
- Yes.

919
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:48,833
After that?

920
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,791
Then, Kamal Haasan comes 
to the railway station.

921
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:55,083
And his clothes are all dirty after falling 
and rolling in the mud and marsh.

922
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,250
After coming there,

923
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:59,625
he calls out 'Viji..!! Viji...!'...

924
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,000
Sridevi looks at him.

925
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:02,083
But she doesn't recognize him.

926
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:05,625
After getting her memory back, 
she forgot the whole story, mom!

927
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,666
And then?

928
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:10,375
Then, like he did earlier, Kamal 
Haasan does this...

929
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,916
and imitates a monkey.

930
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,500
Yeah! It's very nice!

931
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,375
Awesome. 
Really!

932
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,041
You look exactly like a monkey!

933
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:20,708
Mom! 
- You say it, Jose!

934
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:26,333
Even after trying everything he can, 
Sridevi doesn't recognize Kamal Haasan.

935
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,000
Then, the train starts.

936
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,625
When Kamal Haasan runs 
fast behind the train,

937
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,250
thinking that he's a mad man,

938
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,916
Sridevi gives him something 
like rice or Idly, in a cover.

939
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:37,375
We'll feel really sad, mom!

940
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:41,166
Then, he dances around 
carrying a pot on his head.

941
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,416
For her to remember.

942
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,166
But what's the point?

943
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,291
The train goes away!

944
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:49,875
Kamal Haasan falls down at the 
station, crying 'Viji...! Viji...!'

945
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,500
The movie ends there. 
That's it!

946
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
You were here?

947
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,541
What is it, Lisy? 
Why do you look pale?

948
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,291
Should I take you to the doctor? 
Mom, look at her.

949
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,250
There's something wrong, right? 
- Get lost.

950
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,250
Whom were you with?

951
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:04,958
I was at the market.

952
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,833
There are people who saw you leaving 
in Maria's car from the market.

953
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,708
Hey Lisy! 
Hey!

954
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:13,416
Why are you talking like this, 
in this beautiful evening?

955
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,833
Mom, I'm going for the night show. 
- Hey Babu!

956
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,708
Won't she recognize that Master, ever?

957
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,583
Isn't it a movie, mom?

958
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:27,375
Lisy!

959
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,666
Lisy!

960
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,583
I've told you several times 
that Maria is my friend!

961
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,000
Don't talk too much!

962
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,833
Everyone knows her true nature!

963
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,375
What's wrong with her?

964
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,375
She's eating, drinking and 
enjoying life, right?

965
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:42,375
And many men like you to go wagging 
your tails, when she snaps her fingers!

966
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,875
Isn't that why she's living alone?

967
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,250
Hey! You whitey!

968
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,083
You think all those who 
live alone are dubious?

969
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:49,125
That's not true!

970
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,666
Maria is a first class girl.

971
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,041
Then? Am I the shady one?

972
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:53,875
Of course!

973
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,458
If I'm not good enough, 
send me back to my house.

974
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:00,666
Mom, give me those betel leaves. 
I'll kill her today.

975
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,125
Kill me, and then go live with her!

976
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,666
I had said long back, that I'll 
marry her uncle's daughter.

977
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:06,916
Daddy! 
- Yes.

978
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,625
Can all monkeys extend their tails 
like Kapish (comic character)?

979
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,750
I don't know that, dear.

980
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:15,791
But there are some female monkeys 
who expand their tongues like that.

981
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,375
Where? 
- Inside.

982
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,125
Who? 
Mom?

983
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,458
Yes. Haven't you seen your 
mom's face at certain times?

984
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,458
Hey Jose!

985
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:29,333
Does Porinju still loiter around 
in front of Mariam's house?

986
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,125
What are you saying, mom?

987
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:32,916
If he doesn't see her for one day, 
he'll go mad!

988
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,250
And she knows that too!

989
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,416
[Singing a popular 
Malayalam romantic song]

990
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:14,541
Awesome!

991
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:17,875
You smell so good!

992
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:19,375
How did you come inside?

993
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,000
Jumping over your dad's damn wall!

994
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,958
What's your intention?

995
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,791
I came to see you!

996
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,958
Didn't you see me when I 
came to lock the gate?

997
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,333
Move away.

998
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:33,791
Leave me!

999
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,083
Move!

1000
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:54,833
Maria!

1001
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:05,833
What fish is it?

1002
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,916
Open that door. 
I'm starving!

1003
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,458
Give me something to eat. 
Open it.

1004
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,375
I'll show you now!

1005
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,750
When will we...?

1006
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:23,958
After I die?

1007
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:25,666
Get lost!

1008
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:45,291
Maria...

1009
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Can you give me a kiss?

1010
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:51,333
I'll give you!

1011
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:52,416
Stop there!

1012
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,250
Hey! I will kill you! 
- No!

1013
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,416
Go back! 
- Hey!

1014
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:56,958
Get lost!

1015
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:00,166
Don't get wet in the rain. 
Go back. I will leave!

1016
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,875
Go back! 
- Get lost!

1017
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:06,625
Go back inside!

1018
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,291
Dad!

1019
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,583
What you did was really cruel!

1020
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,000
I'll never forget it!

1021
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,166
Iype Etta...

1022
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:42,541
Isn't Rafael home?

1023
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:44,541
Rafael.. 
- Yes.

1024
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,250
Come.

1025
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:51,666
Rafael...

1026
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,000
Didn't you say that there was 
some programme for the festival?

1027
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,041
Yes, I'll tell you.

1028
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,083
Hey!

1029
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,583
Isn't this George from Kuriyachira? 
- Yes.

1030
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:03,666
Stephen...

1031
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,500
Bring that money.

1032
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:10,083
What for? - We shouldn't let 
these guys stand here for long.

1033
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:11,375
They are troublesome.

1034
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:12,958
Bring the money quickly.

1035
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:19,125
Iype Etta, Namaste.

1036
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,333
What is it? 
Are you just sitting around nowadays?

1037
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,541
Well, even while sitting or lying down, 
a tiger is always a tiger!

1038
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,916
George! 
- Yes.

1039
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:33,375
Are you coming in? 
- No.

1040
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:35,625
I don't have time. 
I have a case.

1041
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,083
Which one? 
That Ollur stabbing case?

1042
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,166
No. 
That was compromised.

1043
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,458
This is the case of pushing the 
Circle Inspector into the well.

1044
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:46,875
Don't show any mercy.

1045
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,291
Let them die if they have to.

1046
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:51,083
I've sent Mahogany coffins 
for their funeral.

1047
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,083
Don't worry about the case.

1048
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,125
The Inspector is our guy!

1049
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,458
You didn't tell me who it is.

1050
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Puthenpally Jose.

1051
01:04:58,375 --> 01:04:59,375
Then...

1052
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,625
'Wild-man' Porinju.

1053
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:08,291
Just a minute. 
Let me discuss with my boys.

1054
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,750
Hey!

1055
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,666
I think they are making a plan.

1059
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,583
Must be to ask for more money.

What is it?

1061
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,125
Hey!

1062
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,916
If it was just Jose, 
we could have tried.

1063
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,083
But Porinju...

1064
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,958
We won't be able to do it, brother.

1065
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,583
Come!

1066
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,625

Is it about a new sale? 
What?

1070
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,500
Did you know? 
- What?

1071
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,250
Mariam has bought a 
brand new grave.

1072
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,583
A posh grave made of marble.

1073
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:34,416
That's the best grave 
in our cemetery now.

1074
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,458
But she has another 
family grave, right?

1075
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,958
She would have that. 
She has lots of money, right?

1076
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:41,125
She must have thought that the old 
grave wasn't fashionable enough.

1077
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:46,125
Anyway, I see all chances of one 
of your coffins being sold!

I sold one? Where's my board?

01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,916
I'll bring it tomorrow. 
- I've been hearing this for long!

Where is it?

1083
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,375
When I write 'coffin', 
my hands are shivering!

1084
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,291
I'll get it written 
from another place.

1085
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,291

01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:12,875
He has come. 
Prince.

1226
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,333
He has brought goons too.

1227
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,250
Father, we need to 
talk and make peace.

1228
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:20,833
I'm getting really scared.

1229
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:24,583
Tito, those who want to fight & kill, 
don't care about God or the Bible!

1230
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,583
What's a priest for them?

1231
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,208
Finally, when the festival is ruined.

1232
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,458
put all the blame on me, okay?

1233
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,916
Cheers! 
Are you going to drink, brother?

1234
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:44,916
So cheers again!

1235
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:45,958
Cheers!

1236
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,708
Pour it!

1237
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,250
Hey Prince!

1238
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,166
Fix a drink & give it to him.

1239
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,000
Prince bro, shall 
we get you a drink?

1240
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:19,458
Shut up & drink. 
If he wants, he will come and drink.

1241
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:24,083
I'm not liking these guys at all.

1242
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,750
They are innocent guys, grandpa.

1243
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,583
They have come to see our festival.

1244
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:32,750
Prince, your grandpa has 
created so many fights!

1245
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,833
Don't frown!

1246
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,500
I know that you 
don't like advice.

1247
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,583
Wage a war where 
a war is needed.

1248
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:42,833
And make peace where 
peace is necessary.

1249
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:45,125
That's the sign of 
an intelligent man.

1250
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:47,125
Prince...

1251
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:49,000
Porinju will come, 
if I call him.

1252
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,833
All of us can sit together.

1253
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,083
We'll arrive at a compromise.

1254
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:55,666
He beat up Iype's grandson like a 
dog, in front of all the townsmen.

1255
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,750
And what did you do, grandpa?

1256
01:19:58,166 --> 01:19:59,500
And now you want a compromise?

1257
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,625
Hey!

1258
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:03,708
If you were beaten up, fight 
him one one one, like a man!

1259
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,125
That's the tradition 
in Thrissur.

1260
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:07,708
And not bringing goons 
by paying for them!

1261
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:10,541
You don't know about Porinju.. 
- Porinju!

1262
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:12,583
Do you care for that 
scoundrel more than me?

1263
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,708
He's a righteous guy.

1264
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,666
There's no one like him.

1265
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:18,375
You are scared, grandpa!

1266
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:22,166
This compromise is only meant for cowards!

1267
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,833
This is not what I had 
heard about you, grandpa.

1268
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,750
I've grown old, right?

1269
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,875
As time passes, 
people change.

1270
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:31,541
Do you want it, grandpa?

1271
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,250
Grandpa was an old tiger!

1272
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,500
He had a famous trick with 
the Malappuram knife.

1273
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:52,041
The opponent will realize only after he 
has been stabbed. His speed was such!

1274
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,791
When they grow old, 
people are good for nothing!

1275
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,500
Fix a drink for me!

1276
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,083
Dad!

1277
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:07,791
Dad!

1278
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,041
Get up!

1279
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,208
This is Kunjoos' brew.

1280
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,333
It's awesome!

1281
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,750
Porinju...

1282
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,083
Shall we go to Velankanni?

1283
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,250
Now?

1284
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,375
Between this festival? 
What is this, dad?

1285
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:23,708
We should go.

1286
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,666
We need to see Mother Mary.

1287
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,791
Only 3-4 days are remaining.

1288
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:29,916
We'll go after that.

1289
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,166
Have this!

1290
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:34,916
I'll get some pork meat.

1291
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:01,583
Get down.

1292
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,416
What is it, Anto?

1293
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:06,875
Nothing, Maria chechi.

1294
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,208
People don't come here for nothing.

1295
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:14,583
You heard that we got married, right?

1296
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:15,833
Yes.

1297
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,541
We're planning to host a 
small reception tonight.

1298
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:21,166
Have you come to invite me? 
- I will invite you. Of course!

1299
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:23,250
But now, I need some money.

1300
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,333
On interest.

1301
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,541
Didn't you take anything 
while leaving your house?

1302
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:28,250
I told her not to.

1303
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:30,125
I also have some 
self-esteem, Maria chechi.

1304
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:31,833
How much do you want? 
- Well...

1305
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:33,541
I'm short of 1000 Rupees.

1306
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,416
She will give it.

1307
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:40,416
It will be great if you could give 
it to me as change. - Let me see.

1308
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,500
Such a nice mango tree!

1309
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,958
So much shade, right? 
- Yeah, right!

1310
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
There's so much shade!

1311
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,333
Why? 
- Did you see that branch?

1312
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,375
Yes.

1313
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:52,041
Maria chechi's dad hung 
himself on that branch.

1314
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,916
Oh no! 
- What?

1315
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,583
Did you get scared? 
- Then what?

1316
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:04,250
Count it & see.

1317
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,291
No, Maria chechi.

1318
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,166
You needn't pay interest for this.

1319
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,250
You both are at a good age.

1320
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,625
Live happily.

1321
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,625
Won't you come for 
the reception?

1322
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:18,666
Yes.

1323
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:19,916
Bye, Chechi. 
- Bye.

1324
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:08,416
'The one who knows your heart... 
She is your wife'

1325
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:13,708
'The one who knows your heart... 
She is your wife'

1326
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:19,250
'The one who came in your dreams... 
The one who came as your sweet-heart'

1327
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:24,291
'The one who came in your dreams... 
The one who came as your sweet-heart'

1328
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:30,125
'The one who gave you her heart, 
in this romantic night'

1329
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:35,416
'The one who stole your heart, 
like the brass band of Denaha festival'

1330
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:40,416
'The one who frolics around 
you like a music box'

1331
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:43,291
'The day you were waiting for is here'

1332
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:48,958
'Their hearts come together, the story 
continues, and this is their wedding'

1333
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,625
'Every day is a festival for her, 
hereafter'

1334
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:58,833
'She needs your blessings, O' Saint'

1335
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,208
'Maria'

1336
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,458
'My Maria'

1337
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:02,791
'If you smile'

1338
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:06,750
'With that smile, 
I'm full happy'

1339
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,750
'If you don't smile, 
I'm totally sad'

1340
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:14,875
'She came before me, 
with the beauty of the festival'

1341
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:20,208
'Ever since then, 
this girl has captured my heart'

1342
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,916
'When there's no one around'

1343
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:28,208
'Here eyes exude love'

1344
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:36,083
'She's the one who's going to rule my 
land, with a house full of children'

1345
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:41,291
'The one who closes the 
door of midnight daily'

1346
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:46,625
'The one who's clings on 
to me as my better half'

1347
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:50,500
'Every day is a festival for her, 
hereafter'

1348
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:56,791
'She needs your blessings, O' Saint'

1349
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:02,083
'Every day is a festival for her, 
hereafter'

1350
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:07,375
'She needs your blessings, O' Saint'

1351
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:28,791
'While I go to sleep at night, 
my heart is full of memories'

1352
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,125
'She's the one to sit 
beside me and cuddle up'

1353
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:39,291
'The one who gave me my first kiss, 
while no one was watching'

1354
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:44,916
'The one whose care I need, 
when I won't have anyone else with me'

1355
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,166
'The one whose heart is 
really large and pure'

1356
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:55,291
'The one who lives within me forever, 
more precious than my life'

1357
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:57,375
Come on, man!

1358
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:05,291
'She needs your blessings, O' Saint'

1359
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:11,083
'Every day is a festival for her, 
hereafter'

1360
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:16,750
'She needs your blessings, O' Saint'

1361
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,083
Jose's dance...

1362
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,125
Porinju...

1363
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:53,541
No one in Thrissur has played 
the kind of games we've played!

1364
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:57,333
Though I'm much older 
to you in age,

1365
01:27:57,541 --> 01:27:59,416
aren't we friends?

1366
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,041
Isn't that always like that, Iype Etta?

1367
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:02,458
Porinju...

1368
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:08,250
I have escaped many difficult situations, 
with your courage alone!

1369
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:11,583
Now I'm in a difficult situation.

1370
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,500
You should help me.

1371
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,708
What's your problem, Iype ettan? 
Tell me.

1372
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:16,916
Porinju...

1373
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,708
Until this festival gets over, 
you should stay away from here.

1374
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:23,708
I have an estate at Malakkappara.

1375
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,750
I know!

1376
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,666
I can pay you as much 
money as you want!

1377
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,750
Money?

1378
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,541
What are you saying, Iype ettan?

1379
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:31,208
It's not that! 
- Then?

1380
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:34,208
None of those idiots in my family 
can understand what I'm saying.

1381
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,375
That's why.

1382
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:39,708
Aren't we all living here to attend 
these festivals & celebrations?

1383
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,416
Understand my situation, man!

1384
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,000
Then take a decision.

1385
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,250
Iype Etta...

1386
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,291
What's this meeting here?

1387
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:50,750
Hey Jose! 
Get going.

1388
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:52,333
I don't have anything 
to say to you.

1389
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,708
I heard that the boy has come.

1390
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,708
Ask him not to show 
his head outside.

1391
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,375
Why are you grinning?

1392
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,458
Jose!

1393
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,083
Haven't you exploited 
Porinju so much?

1394
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:05,708
You're a fox!

1395
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:06,916
Who called you here?

1396
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,375
No! He's drunk and 
blabbering nonsense.

1397
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:12,041
Leave him, Porinju. What are you doing? 
This is not good.

1398
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:13,125
Take him away!

1399
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:16,625
Come, Jose. 
Or I'll get what's meant for you!

1400
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:17,791
Come!

1401
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:18,958
Come on, walk.

1402
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:20,833
Listen to me. 
- Porinju!

1403
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,958
Don't create trouble. 
Come on!

1404
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:24,291
He's angry now.

1405
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,041
Let's talk tomorrow. 
Okay?

1406
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:27,166
Come. 
- Move!

1407
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,125
What's the point in 
getting angry at me?

1408
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:30,166
Come on!

1409
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:35,125
Porinju...

1410
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:37,083
We were so good together!

1411
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,041
Don't forget all that.

1412
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,083
Maria chechi.. 
It's me.

1413
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,083
Prince!

1414
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,833
Well, where are you coming from?

1415
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,291
Maria chechi... 
I...

1416
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:43,541
I love you!

1417
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,458
Love!

1418
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,541
It's love!

1419
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:49,958
Well...

1420
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,500
Aren't you scared to roam around 
all alone like this, Maria chechi?

1421
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,791
After all,

1422
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,500
you're a woman, right?

1423
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,791
Get lost, you schmuck!

1424
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,125
Come on!

1425
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:43,291
Come!

1426
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:47,541
Look at her, man!

1427
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:51,083
This is a real woman!

1428
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:53,125
Maria doesn't care whether 
it's day or night!

1429
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,458
Bloody b******d!

1430
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:57,375
Bro, shall we take her?

1431
01:31:57,708 --> 01:32:00,041
Look! She's really fuming hot!

1432
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,041
No.

1433
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:03,583
You've come for a different job.

1434
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,416
This job can wait until 
that one is over.

1435
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,291
Hey!

1436
01:32:59,916 --> 01:33:02,083
Alappatt Varghese's daughter is here.

1437
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,208
Get up and show some respect.

1438
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:21,083
She's praying to see my end!

1439
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,083
For every festival, I wish...

1440
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:34,750
... that she would be with 
me for the next festival.

1441
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:39,083
And that we both will walk through 
the Church grounds, holding hands.

1442
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It's in vain!

1443
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,375
She's not my old Maria.

1444
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,500
She has changed.

1445
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:53,625
I'm no one to her.

1446
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,041
I don't love him, it seems!

1447
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,333
I'll kill him!

1448
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:48,625
O' Mother Mary!

1449
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,750
Awesome!

1450
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,750
Awesome!

1451
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:53,708
Porinju!

1452
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:55,083
Has revolution begun?

1453
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:57,291
The revolution will begin, Paily Etta.

1454
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:59,125
This town will shiver & quiver!

1455
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:00,875
Porinju will marry Mariam.

1456
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:22,833
Hey Vincent!

1457
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:23,958
Yes, Porinju!

1458
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,541
Come and see my item!

1459
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:28,875
Josetta!

1460
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,125
Josetta!

1461
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:33,708
Phew!

1462
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:35,666
Look at your lil' boy coming!

1463
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,333
Josetta! 
Josetta!

1464
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:39,083
What is it? 
- Josetta.

1465
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,083
What do you want?

1466
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,750
Will you show us your disco dance?

1467
01:35:42,166 --> 01:35:43,833
Are you my fans? 
- Yes.

1468
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:45,875
I'll show you now. 
Why not?

1469
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,750
Watch!

1470
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,875
'I am a Disco Dancer' 
- You moron!

1471
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:53,208
Stop your disco! Bringing shame to me! 
- Go! Go! That's my dad!

1472
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:54,625
You and your buffoonery!

1473
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,541
Dad has been looking 
for you for a while.

1474
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:57,916
What is it, dad?

1475
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:01,291
Jose...

1476
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,291
I have to tell you something.

1477
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:04,416
What?

1478
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:07,416
You can celebrate this year's festival, 
sitting at home.

1479
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:11,125
I'll buy as many bottles 
of booze you need.

1480
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,041
Hey! What the hell 
is dad saying?

1481
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,083
Our Thrissur...

1482
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:17,083
Our festival. 
How can I celebrate it at home?

1483
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,625
You loser brother!

1484
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,333
Other than jumping around 
saying that it's the festival,

1485
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,916
have you bought even a piece 
of cloth for your wife & kid?

1486
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:25,833
What a waste of a life!

1487
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,041
Jose...

1488
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,541
Come.  
Let's go home.

1489
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,583
What is this, dad?

1490
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:37,375
Did you buy clothes for Lisy & Mini?

1491
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,083
Dad, that's my shirt.

1492
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:44,125
Babu, give this to me. 
I'll wear this for the festival.

1493
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:45,541
Dad, I haven't even tried it on.

1494
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:48,333
So nice! Dad, look. 
Doesn't it suit me more than him?

1495
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:49,833
Give it to me. 
- Leave it.

1496
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,750
I'll give it back to you. 
- Don't fight.

1497
01:36:51,791 --> 01:36:53,000
Move, boys!

1498
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,791
Don't run! 
- I will kill him today, dad!

1499
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,583
Stop there! 
I'll give it back to you!

1500
01:36:58,583 --> 01:37:00,916
Oh God! These guys are so crazy!

1501
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,458
This is the latest fashion.

1502
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,500
Show me that.

1503
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:08,083
Not good enough. 
Show me another one.

1504
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:10,958
How is this?

1505
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:13,416
How much is it?

1506
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:15,583
65.  
- What about this? - 110.

1507
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:17,375
Then this is fine.

1508
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,375
So, this one...

1509
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,000
and this one, right? 
- Yes. Both of them.

1510
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,083
What's the total?

1511
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:26,208
155. 
- 155, right? Okay.

1512
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,833
Hey Varkey! 
Stop!

1513
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:37,791
Where are you going? 
- For a movie.

1514
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:39,958
Which one? 
- 'Oru Kaithiyin Diary' [Tamil movie]

1515
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Oh my God! 
Kamal Haasan in a double role?

1516
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:44,500
I'm also coming. 
- I have money only for my ticket.

1517
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,750
How many tickets you want? 
I'll buy it.

1518
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:47,583
Hold this. 
I'll ride it.

1519
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:50,208
What's in this bag?

1520
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:52,791
I bought some clothes for Lisy and Mini. 
It's the festival, right?

1521
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:54,833
Wow! That's a new habit!

1522
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,041
I thought about it only 
when Babu told me.

1523
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,916
He's wiser than me, man.

1524
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,041
And Mini & Lisy would be happy 
when I give this to them, right?

1525
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:03,458
Let's go. 
The movie will start now.

1526
01:38:06,041 --> 01:38:07,208
There's a huge crowd.

1527
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:10,000
Will we get tickets? 
- It's quite crowded!

1528
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:12,166
I'll stand in the queue.

1529
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,250
Come here. 
- Hey Varkey!

1530
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,458
Not here. 
Let's buy balcony tickets.

1531
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:24,541
I have money only for a 
second class ticket.

1532
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:27,125
I have money, man! It's the festival, right? 
Let's celebrate. Come!

1533
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:28,166
Go, stand in the queue.

1534
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:30,208
Shall I stand here? 
- Yes.

1535
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:33,916
You stand here.

1536
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:34,958
Let me go see.

1537
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:46,750
Chechi...

1538
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:48,208
Can you buy 2 tickets for me?

1539
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:49,500
Can't you stand in the queue?

1540
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:51,833
The doctor has told me not to 
stand in a queue. That's why.

1541
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:53,583
Buy it if you can. 
That's all!

1542
01:38:57,166 --> 01:38:58,708
Hey Varkey! 
Come here.

1543
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,083
Did you get it? 
- I gave it.

1544
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:01,916
Buddy!

1545
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,250
You are too much! 
- Hey Jose!

1546
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:05,708
Kochappu, you were here?

1547
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,625
How's the movie? 
- I heard it's awesome.

1548
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:08,958
Kamal Haasan is 
in a double role.

1549
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,958
Double role? 
That too, to me?

1550
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:13,750
I think Chechi got the tickets. 
Come on.

1551
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:15,750
Hey! Stand in the queue.

1552
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,791
Who'll stand in queue for balcony? 
Get lost!

1553
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,625
How come you've come 
to the balcony, Jose?

1554
01:39:19,625 --> 01:39:21,625
Why? Are we forbidden here? 
- I was just asking.

1555
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:23,291
He thinks that we don't have money!

1556
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:27,041
Move your legs, Chechi. 
Move your legs, Chetta.

1557
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,750
Let's sit here.

1558
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:29,916
Sit down.

1559
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:33,458
Give me that bag.

1560
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:40,958
Look at that, Jose. 
If we sat there, we could have danced!

1561
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:45,958
Look at that!

1562
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:49,583
'Don't put your feet on the seats'

1563
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:50,791
Your dad's the donkey!

1564
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:51,833
Then what!

1565
01:39:54,041 --> 01:39:55,791
'No smoking' 
- Nothing is allowed.

1566
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:57,416
Give me a 'Beedi'.

1567
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,458
I thought you would have it.

1568
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:02,458
How can we watch the movie without Beedi? 
Hold this.

1569
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:03,791
Be careful.

1570
01:40:04,166 --> 01:40:05,916
Come back fast. 
- I'll be right back.

1571
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:25,958
Hey! Thomasetta!

1572
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
A small packet of Beedis.

1573
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,125
Jose, just a minute.

1574
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:29,333
Let me give this.

1575
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:35,708
Here's your lime juice.

1576
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:38,125
Beedi, right? 
- Yes.

1577
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,125
Jose, run!

1578
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:24,833
Varkey! 
Varkey!

1579
01:41:24,916 --> 01:41:26,208
Varkey, go and call Porinju!

1580
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,208
What happened? 
- Go and call Porinju!

1581
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,291
Go!

1582
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:30,791
Go and call Porinju!

1583
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:35,500
Jose, run! 
- Go, man!

1584
01:41:35,583 --> 01:41:36,708
Go and call Porinju!

1585
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,958
Jose, run! 
Run!

1586
01:41:39,416 --> 01:41:40,541
Oh my God!

1587
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:43,250
Jose, come out. 
Fast!

1588
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,500
Jose, run!

1589
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:45,541
Varkey, go!

1590
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:47,666
Go, I say! 
Go, Varkey!

1591
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:52,083
Run!

1592
01:41:54,291 --> 01:41:55,833
Jose!

1593
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:57,333
Jose!

1594
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:09,916
Hey! Go and slash him!

1595
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,125
Hey kid!

1596
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:37,791
We might have many 
problems between us.

1597
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:40,375
But to bring goons from 
outside with swords & stuff...

1598
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:42,208
That's really shady business.

1599
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:46,708
There won't be Puthenpally Jose's dance, 
for any festival hereafter.

1600
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:49,333
Hearing the sound of the brass band,

1601
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:52,000
you'll be lying at one 
corner of your house.

1602
01:42:54,083 --> 01:42:56,291
Without being able to move at all!

1603
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,375
Slash him!

1604
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:32,541
Enough. 
Come!

1605
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:41,458
You...!!

1606
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,375
Kill me and go, 
you b******!!

1607
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:08,000
Move! 
Move!

1608
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:09,958
Jose!

1609
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,291
Jose, get up!

1610
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:15,666
Get up!

1611
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,916
Let's go to the hospital. 
Get up!

1612
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:19,041
No, dude.

1613
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:20,125
Get up!

1614
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:21,416
I'll die before we reach there.

1615
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:22,625
No!

1616
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:24,375
Get a vehicle! 
- Come! Come!

1617
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,500
Move! Move!

1618
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:26,625
Come on!

1619
01:44:26,958 --> 01:44:27,958
Lift him!

1620
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:39,916
Porinju!

1621
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,333
Give me a Beedi.

1622
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:46,958
Porinju...

1623
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:49,125
Don't come with me!

1624
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:54,000
You should have fun in our 
Thrissur for a long time!

1625
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:56,875
Did you hear me, Porinju?

1626
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:14,833
You...

1627
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:17,833
You should marry Maria.

1628
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:21,500
You should walk with your head held high, 
through the Church grounds, holding her hand.

1629
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:23,875
Did you hear me, Porinju?

1630
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,250
Porinju!

1631
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:28,291
Jose!

1632
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:29,666
Jose!

1633
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:33,250
Jose! 
Jose!

1634
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,750
Jose!

1635
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,125
Jose has left us, Porinju!

1636
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:41,541
Jose has left us!

1637
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:44,208
Jose!

1638
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:49,625
I have fought the good fight,  
I have finished the race.

1639
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:52,000
I have kept the faith.

1640
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:59,083
May God give you the eternal joy that 
was promised to his faithful servants.

1641
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:03,000
My brothers, I am bidding 
farewell to you all now.

1642
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:05,958
Please pray for me.

1643
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:14,125
My son...

1644
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,291
Lisy chechi...

1645
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:42,375
Daddy!

1646
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:51,958
Daddy!

1647
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:53,875
Open your eyes!

1648
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:58,875
Josetta, can't you hear 
our daughter calling you?

1649
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:01,208
Open your eyes!

1650
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:10,375
Remember, you are dust...

1651
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:13,250
... and to dust, you shall return.

1652
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,000
Those who want to kiss him, 
go ahead.

1653
01:49:25,958 --> 01:49:27,458
Josetta...

1654
01:49:29,125 --> 01:49:30,125
Josetta...

1655
01:49:30,916 --> 01:49:32,416
Here's the shirt, Josetta...

1656
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,166
Shouldn't we have a blast 
for the festival, Josetta?

1657
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,083
Babu...

1658
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:21,958
Dad!

1659
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:24,166
Porinju is all alone now, dad.

1660
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,625
Who's there for him now?

1661
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,250
You should agree, dad.

1662
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:37,166
I want to live the rest 
of my life with him.

1663
01:51:38,875 --> 01:51:40,083
I have to go, dad.

1664
01:51:42,083 --> 01:51:43,083
I have to go!

1665
01:51:57,541 --> 01:51:58,541
Porinju!

1666
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:02,000
I don't need this coffin!

1667
01:52:09,291 --> 01:52:11,000
O' Mother Mary of Velankanni!

1668
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:13,791
We are coming to your Holy Abode.

1669
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,958
Protect us, Mother.

1670
01:53:06,666 --> 01:53:07,666
Lisy...

1671
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:28,708
None of us knew that such a 
treachery would happen, Lisy.

1672
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,958
Jose was not just a friend to me.

1673
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:40,666
He was my brother as well!

1674
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:56,625
But Maria...

1675
01:53:57,083 --> 01:54:01,125
Those outsiders killed my Josettan...

1676
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:05,750
Alas, if my Josettan had 
a knife with him...

1677
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,500
Where are you going? 
No, son.

1678
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:13,083
Leave my hand, mom. 
- Don't go.

1679
01:54:13,125 --> 01:54:14,500
No, son.

1680
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,166
I want to kill them. 
- Those devils will kill you too.

1681
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:19,666
Don't go, son. 
- I'll slash them!

1682
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:21,500
Son! Don't go!

1683
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:22,541
Babu!

1684
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:24,333
Babu!

1685
01:54:24,375 --> 01:54:25,958
We have only you! 
- Leave it.

1686
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:27,041
Leave it.

1687
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,000
Babu!

1688
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:31,416
No!

1689
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:34,583
We are here for that, right?

1690
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:39,041
Son...

1691
01:54:39,333 --> 01:54:40,708
My son...

1692
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:23,208
[Puthenpally Jose]

1693
01:55:43,583 --> 01:55:44,583
Don't get killed.

1694
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:21,083
Here.

1695
01:56:21,125 --> 01:56:22,791
Peter, come here.

1696
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:27,708
What is it? 
- Don't let them stay out like this.

1697
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:31,458
Until they go back 
shift them to our attic.

1698
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,375
Whatever they need, 
serve it to them there.

1699
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:34,833
Okay. 
Go!

1700
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:41,833
Give them to us and go, Prince.

1701
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:43,750
We'll take real good care of them!

1702
01:56:43,791 --> 01:56:45,791
A friend of mine from Dubai 
arranged them for me.

1703
01:56:45,833 --> 01:56:48,500
They won't stay at a single 
place for too long, uncle.

1704
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:50,458
Rafael...

1705
01:56:50,583 --> 01:56:51,583
What is it, dad?

1706
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:54,833
What are you planning to do to Porinju? 
- The same thing we did to Jose.

1707
01:56:55,125 --> 01:56:56,833
We should regain our lost honour, dad!

1708
01:56:57,583 --> 01:56:58,583
Rafael...

1709
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:00,375
You know very well, right?

1710
01:57:00,625 --> 01:57:03,250
Even if an army comes to attack me,

1711
01:57:03,291 --> 01:57:04,958
Porinju will stand in 
front of me and say,

1712
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:07,500
'You will touch Iype ettan 
only after killing me'

1713
01:57:07,666 --> 01:57:10,625
What Porinju did for us... 
- What are you saying, dad?

1714
01:57:10,916 --> 01:57:12,416
We need a boat to cross a river.

1715
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:15,333
But does anyone carry the boat on his head, 
after crossing the river?

1716
01:57:17,083 --> 01:57:18,083
Grandpa!

1717
01:57:18,166 --> 01:57:19,791
We will finish Porinju!

1718
01:57:38,916 --> 01:57:41,750
SI Avaran has called for a peace meeting.

1719
01:57:42,041 --> 01:57:43,041
Tomorrow.

1720
01:57:47,583 --> 01:57:51,000
Trying to compromise the case by taking 
money from the killers, bloody Avaran?

1721
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,666
Calling a meeting and having 
tea, after killing our Jose?

1722
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:55,708
We want to go inside!

1723
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,291
All of you be quiet and 
pay attention here.

1724
01:57:58,333 --> 01:57:59,916
Don't listen to them. 
Over here.

1725
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:01,250
Ask Iype, you scoundrels!

1726
01:58:01,333 --> 01:58:02,875
Bring him inside. 
- Sir.

1727
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:06,541
He was in the arrack shop. He was not 
ready to come, sir. - Make him sit there.

1728
01:58:06,583 --> 01:58:07,583
Please move.

1729
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,750
Even if you arrange meetings,

1730
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,791
will our Jose come back?

1731
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:17,958
Let us go inside.

1732
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,458
Stop there.

1733
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:21,791
Maria is here.

1734
01:58:22,416 --> 01:58:23,583
Leave us. 
- Maria.

1735
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:27,000
Maria, they are not letting us go inside. 
- Don't shout.

1736
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
We'll find a solution.

1737
01:58:28,083 --> 01:58:29,333
The meeting begins now.

1738
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:31,208
First of all,

1739
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:34,833
the compensation money for the deceased 
Jose's family will be handed over.

1740
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:38,208
To do that, I invite our 
honourable Father Irumban.

1741
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:41,208
Give it yourself!

1742
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,500
Anthony!

1743
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:46,708
I don't want that money!

1744
01:58:47,375 --> 01:58:48,541
Anthony, come here.

1745
01:58:50,166 --> 01:58:51,458
I don't want that money!

1746
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:53,333
Bloody money!

1747
01:58:57,208 --> 01:58:58,666
If he doesn't want the money, 
so be it.

1748
01:58:58,708 --> 01:59:00,083
Proceed to the main agenda.

1749
01:59:01,416 --> 01:59:02,416
My dear people,

1750
01:59:02,666 --> 01:59:05,791
we have gathered here today 
to discuss about peace.

1751
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:06,916
What peace?

1752
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:08,416
Maria, sit here.

1753
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:11,208
Is this how you create peace, 
you cheat?

1754
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,416
You...!! 
- What?

1755
01:59:12,958 --> 01:59:14,458
Do you want to see 
who this Maria is?

1756
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,500
Do you?

1757
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,416
Iype is not the only 
one with money here.

1758
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:19,958
Porinju has left.

1759
01:59:25,166 --> 01:59:26,166
Where?

1760
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,125
Porinju has left to 
Velankanni with his father.

1761
01:59:28,166 --> 01:59:31,250
I saw them. He told me that he'll 
come back only after a month.

1762
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:34,208
Porinju told me to tell Iype ettan that...

1763
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:36,291
... he won't cause any trouble here.

1764
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:03,333
[Children cheering]

1765
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:18,000

1766
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:39,333
Iype, festival greetings!

1767
02:00:39,375 --> 02:00:40,375

'The house is full of guests. 
An amazing feast is being prepared'

1773
02:00:58,833 --> 02:01:02,125
'Who's going to light up 
the fireworks here?'

1774
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:16,750
'O Saint Sebastianos, 
pray for us'

1775
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:20,000

'Love is flowing everywhere'

1784
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,708
I heard that the celebrations 
at Chittilappally are grand!

1785
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:57,416
They are planning to ask the 
band set to play non-stop.

1786
02:01:57,666 --> 02:01:59,666
Rosy chechi had called.

1787
02:02:00,041 --> 02:02:03,041
She asked to hide the brandy 
bottles from Pranchiyettan.

1788
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:06,375
How? He drinks like a fish, right?

1789
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:09,708
Everything is ready, right?

1790
02:02:09,708 --> 02:02:11,500
Hold the lamps & the umbrellas properly.

1791
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:17,208
St. Thomas Arrow community's arrow procession 
for this year is about to commence.

1792
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,458
All of you participate with devotion.

1793
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,500
Shall we start then?

1794
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:27,791

Anthony Etta...

1798
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:36,416
We'll handle this.

1799
02:02:36,541 --> 02:02:38,625
The rituals of Jose's death 
aren't over yet, right?

1800
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:39,916
Go back home, Anthony ettan.

1801
02:02:39,958 --> 02:02:41,125
This is my job!

1802
02:02:41,416 --> 02:02:44,083
Just because he ended up at 
the edge of someone's knife,

1803
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:46,375
why should I sit idle at home?

1804
02:02:46,833 --> 02:02:48,500
Ready, 1... 2...

1805
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:51,291

1811
02:04:55,541 --> 02:04:57,166
Are you angry with me, Maria chechi?

1812
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:58,750
Why?

1813
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:00,666
Well... For that night...

1814
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:02,875
I forgot it then itself.

1815
02:05:05,625 --> 02:05:07,791
Do you want to come to Dubai, 
Maria chechi?

1816
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:10,208
I have an apartment there.

1817
02:05:10,958 --> 02:05:12,375
Are you going back to Dubai?

1818
02:05:12,833 --> 02:05:14,333
Why do you ask so, Maria chechi?

1819
02:05:15,666 --> 02:05:17,000
I am really sad, kid.

1820
02:05:17,708 --> 02:05:19,125
You're at such a young age, right?

1821
02:05:19,916 --> 02:05:21,708
There's such a long life ahead.

1822
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:23,875
I didn't get you.

1823
02:05:28,541 --> 02:05:31,625
If it was a small mischief, 
I would have let it go.

1824
02:05:32,666 --> 02:05:34,958
But you did what you 
shouldn't have done!

1825
02:05:35,958 --> 02:05:37,208
Look there, you schmuck!

1826
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:16,000
Before coming to Thrissur with goons, 
couldn't you ask your mom?

1827
02:06:22,375 --> 02:06:24,083
Move! 
Move!

1828
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:21,333
How long is your leave, Prince?

1829
02:08:22,083 --> 02:08:23,083
Next...

1830
02:08:23,125 --> 02:08:24,416
I have to go back next week.

1831
02:08:24,666 --> 02:08:26,041
What do you do there?

1832
02:08:26,291 --> 02:08:27,625
I work with daddy.

1833
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:29,375
Leather business.

1834
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,041
So it will go on, 
even if you aren't there.

1835
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:34,500
Right?

1836
02:08:39,875 --> 02:08:41,083
You're shivering!

1837
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:42,833
Porinju Etta...

1838
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:44,250
Don't kill me!

1839
02:08:45,625 --> 02:08:47,541
You plucked out my heart!

1840
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:49,500
And you're asking 
me not to kill you?

1841
02:09:42,833 --> 02:09:43,833
Play it, dad!

1842
02:09:43,916 --> 02:09:45,250

[Playing 'I am a Disco Dancer']

1844
02:10:34,583 --> 02:10:36,500
Why have you come here at night, Mariam?

1845
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
There's a case.

1846
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:39,208
For whom?

1847
02:10:39,375 --> 02:10:40,916
Porinju. 
- Who?

1848
02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:42,333
'Wild-man' Porinju?

1849
02:10:42,458 --> 02:10:43,458
Yes.

1850
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:45,916
Come. 
Let's sit in my office.

1851
02:10:54,416 --> 02:10:55,416
Chechi...

1852
02:11:24,833 --> 02:11:25,833
Iype Etta...

1853
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,333
We've shifted Prince's 
body to the mortuary.

1854
02:11:29,166 --> 02:11:30,583
Rafael & Stephen are there.

1855
02:11:32,458 --> 02:11:35,083
Which is the place where Porinju 
might be hiding, Iype Etta?

1856
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I don't know.

1857
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:38,041
Who else would know?

1858
02:11:39,250 --> 02:11:40,250
Tell me, Iype ettan.

1859
02:11:40,833 --> 02:11:41,875
Shouldn't we catch him?

1860
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:43,750
I said I don't know, right?

1861
02:11:44,875 --> 02:11:45,875
Get going, Avaran!

1862
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:51,500
Start the vehicle!

1863
02:12:04,416 --> 02:12:05,541
It's a murder, right?

1864
02:12:05,833 --> 02:12:06,833
Yes.

1865
02:12:07,416 --> 02:12:10,041
You're aware of my fees, right?

1866
02:12:10,166 --> 02:12:11,958
I'll give you two times what you ask for!

1867
02:12:12,958 --> 02:12:13,958
But Porinju...

1868
02:12:14,125 --> 02:12:16,041
... shouldn't be behind 
bars even for a day!

1869
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:18,291
Not a scratch 
should fall on him!

1870
02:12:27,625 --> 02:12:28,625
Tito!

1871
02:12:28,666 --> 02:12:29,666
Hey!

1872
02:12:30,791 --> 02:12:31,958
I can't hear anything.

1873
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:34,000
Father Irumban sent me. 
Come.

1874
02:12:34,166 --> 02:12:35,166
What's the matter?

1875
02:12:35,208 --> 02:12:37,541
Come. 
- I had met Father on the way.

1876
02:12:37,625 --> 02:12:39,208
What's there to say now?

1877
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:40,250
There is something.

1878
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:41,833
Peter, tell me what it is.

1879
02:12:41,875 --> 02:12:43,000
They will tell you!

1880
02:12:43,541 --> 02:12:46,541
Rafael, what the hell are you going? 
I have to go with the procession.

1881
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:48,875
Didn't you say that Porinju 
went to Velankanni?

1882
02:12:48,875 --> 02:12:50,166
He made me say it.

1883
02:12:50,541 --> 02:12:52,083
If I'm threatened, I'll say anything.

1884
02:12:52,125 --> 02:12:53,125
My dad was also like that.

1885
02:12:53,166 --> 02:12:55,500
Where is Porinju? 
- He has gone to the market now.

1886
02:13:00,541 --> 02:13:02,000
Go fast!

1887
02:13:08,416 --> 02:13:10,375
Babu, those were Iype's sons.

1888
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:13,958
They are going there with the goons 
from Kochi, looking for Porinju.

1889
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,291
Let them go there, right?

1890
02:13:17,291 --> 02:13:19,583
The tickets of Porinju & his 
dad's trip to Velankanni.

1891
02:13:20,416 --> 02:13:21,958
The bill of the lodge 
they stayed at.

1892
02:13:22,958 --> 02:13:24,416
Aren't these enough for evidence?

1893
02:13:26,166 --> 02:13:27,500
How many did he kill?

1894
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:28,958
One or two?

1895
02:13:29,041 --> 02:13:30,208
Six.

1896
02:13:30,375 --> 02:13:31,375
One is over.

1897
02:13:31,666 --> 02:13:33,083
Rest 5 will be done now.

1898
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,875
Go, bring me his head!

1899
02:13:37,958 --> 02:13:38,958
Go!

1900
02:14:18,916 --> 02:14:19,916
Hey!

1901
02:14:19,916 --> 02:14:20,916
He is here.

1902
02:14:21,166 --> 02:14:22,166
Come!

1903
02:16:53,583 --> 02:16:54,583
Porinju...

1904
02:16:54,666 --> 02:16:55,666
Porinju...

1905
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:56,750
Don't do anything!

1906
02:16:57,083 --> 02:16:58,083
Porinju...

1907
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,291
For Iype ettan...

1908
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:04,041
I have only love & affection.

1909
02:17:04,666 --> 02:17:05,666
Go!

1910
02:17:07,458 --> 02:17:08,458
Get lost!

1911
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:10,833
Start the car! 
Start the car!

1912
02:18:11,208 --> 02:18:12,208
Chechi...

1913
02:19:18,333 --> 02:19:19,333
Iype...

1914
02:19:19,958 --> 02:19:23,458
You could have avoided all this, 
if you wanted to.

1915
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:27,500
Now...

1916
02:19:27,666 --> 02:19:29,166
what's the point in 
talking about it?

1917
02:20:11,875 --> 02:20:12,875
