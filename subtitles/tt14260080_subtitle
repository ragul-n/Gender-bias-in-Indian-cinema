1
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,110
Jai Shri Krishna, how do you do?

2
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,900
This is Mumbai, the city of the rich.

3
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,820
Bilions are made in business here everyday.

4
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,740
And in business, there are two kinds of people.

5
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,610
On one hand, colourful playboy
business tycoon MD Makwana.

6
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,450
After defaulting on loans worth billions,
he is running away from Mumbai.

7
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,570
And then there is this fellow,
with the red bag.

8
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,400
He has come to Mumbai to pay off his loan.

9
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,150
Straight from Indore, Chirag Rastogi.

10
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,150
In short, Charlie.

11
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,030
Charlie is no less colourful, but he has a problem.

12
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,490
Wherever he goes, big problems follow.

13
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,700
And that's me, Karsan Patel.
Charlie's uncle.

14
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,110
I had a lovely life, until now.

15
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,490
Hey... Charlie... what a surprise.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,900
So how many days are you staying?

17
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,990
Days? It might take months,
or even years.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,070
I will stay here until I pay back
father's debt.

19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,320
Ok.

20
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,950
But I will find some work,
don't you worry.

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,700
I won't be a burden on you.

22
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,780
No no, I was wondering, we only
have a single bed in the house.

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,950
So how are we going to manage?

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,990
You can sleep comfortably outside,
I'll make do with the bed.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,950
And don't stress about the food.
You cook well.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,700
Whatever you cook,
I'll eat without a fuss.

27
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,990
Ok, since you've decided everything...

28
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,950
Learn some important rules about this city.

29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,280
I know, I know, I've done my homework.

30
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,030
Good morning sir, please come.

31
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,780
- The bike keys.
- What do you mean, sir?

32
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,200
I mean, pack your stuff and get out,
Mr. Latecomer.

33
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,200
But sir, I don't know how
I always get late!

34
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,240
I follow all your rules.

35
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,570
I drive on the wrong side,
never give way to anybody.

36
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I jump every other signal.

37
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,400
The other day I told you go to deliver
Shastri's order in Gandhinagar.

38
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,530
You went to Gandhi's house
in Shastrinagar!

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,860
Sir, this kind of thing happens.

40
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,280
Gandhi and Shastri were both
freedom fighters, after all.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
Pinto's cafe! Pinto's cafe...

42
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes, of course!
4 large double cheese peppy paneer.

43
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,070
Where? Tardeo fire brigade.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,950
It will reach in 30 minutes, or it's free.

45
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,490
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,530
Pinto sir, give me one last chance, please.

47
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,240
Last.

48
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,900
Thank you, sir. Love you.

49
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,150
- 4 large double cheese peppy paneer!
- Coming up.

50
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,450
Charlie, switch off oven no. 2!

51
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,360
Breaking now! After he defrauded the banks
of 40 billion rupees...

52
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,900
A look-out notice has been issued against
playboy industrialist Makwana.

53
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,610
This thug of Hindustan has been missing
for the last 10 days.

54
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,950
Final call for Hong Kong!

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,400
- Ya ya, yes.
- Please proceed to gate number 36B, ma'am.

56
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,240
Anybody else for Hong Kong?

57
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,610
Banana?

58
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,200
You don't like banana, Mr. Makwana?

59
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,030
What are you doing?
Watch where you go.

60
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,450
Guys, the pizza is here!

61
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,320
Shit man, shit!

62
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,860
Let's go, Let's go, come on.

63
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,650
Get my hat.

64
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,150
- Hey, hurry up.
- Where's the damn helmet?

65
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,740
Excuse me, who do I give these pizzas to?

66
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,950
The pizza guys are gone,
didn't you hear the bell?

67
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,030
Bell? What bell, sir?

68
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,610
Sir, sir stop, please don't do this.

69
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,780
Please take these pizzas
or I'll lose my job.

70
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,490
People might lose their lives,
you only care about your job?

71
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,530
Can't you see it's an emergency?

72
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,990
Sir I've got an idea, give these to
the people you save!

73
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,450
They must be hungry.

74
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,530
Let's go.

75
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,650
Won't they be hungry?

76
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,070
And if they don't like it cold,
there's a fire there to heat it up!

77
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,700
Excuse me sir,
would you like these pizzas?

78
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,950
You're fired.

79
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,360
Mr fireman! Please take these pizzas,
they are still hot.

80
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,200
Why are you following us?
We don't want pizza!

81
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,030
Today is my last chance.
I want to keep my job!

82
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,650
- I beg you, go away.
- Sir, please!

83
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,110
Sir, please stop.

84
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,650
Pinto sir!

85
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,110
Pinto sir!

86
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,240
You mean everything burned down?
Nothing is left?

87
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,110
But sir, if I may say so, you should
have called the fire brigade.

88
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,240
I did call them, but nobody came.

89
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,530
They didn't come?

90
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,900
You should sue the fire department.

91
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,070
Even they should have
a 30-minute rule.

92
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,990
I just wish I knew how that damn
fire started...

93
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,530
Charlie, you idiot! You ruined everything.

94
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,950
I told you to switch off the oven,
didn't you hear me?

95
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,490
And now the latest from Mumbai!

96
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,700
A pizza boy caused a collision between
a fire engine and a police van.

97
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,740
Wanted industrialist Makwana escaped
in the commotion.

98
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,150
A 30 minute delivery
proves costly for the whole nation.

99
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,900
Sorry, sir.

100
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,610
Bloody fool!

101
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,400
Mona? 18 calls, Mona.

102
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,240
I told you baby, they'll get you.

103
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,530
Are you with me or not?

104
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,450
Say please.

105
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,610
Oh come on.

106
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,070
Say it, or I'll cut the call.

107
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,360
Ok, ok, please.

108
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,450
Not like that. Say it like you mean it,
from your heart.

109
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,570
Please... darling.

110
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,280
Let it be, looks like you aren't serious.

111
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,740
Excuse me? Are you eating a banana
while talking to me?

112
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,990
How did you know?

113
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,150
Only bananas make this sticky-slurpy sound.

114
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,200
It is disgusting... for god's sake.

115
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,990
Makwana, what do you have against bananas?

116
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,320
Come on darling, you know
I don't like bananas.

117
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,700
I hate bananas.

118
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,530
Don't shout. Where are you right now?

119
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,150
The same place I brought you the first time.

120
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,650
Alright, I'm coming.

121
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,570
Bring some clothes and a chess board.

122
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,530
And spit that banana out and
wash your mouth and come. Dirty... dirty...

123
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,650
Chess board?

124
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,860
Give me cash, cheque, or change.

125
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,400
He'll have to return the loans.

126
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,990
The money is gone, the man is gone...

127
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,610
And what did the people get,
a fisherman's calendar?

128
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,860
You're yelling as if Makwana
stole your own money.

129
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,030
This is an insult, it is the citizens' money.

130
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,780
Remove the mic.

131
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,200
- Get out from my show.
- How can you talk to me like that?

132
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,150
This is my show.
Yes, I can talk like this.

133
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,070
Did you get the chess board?

134
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,780
The cops are everywhere.

135
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,450
I've barely managed to reach here.

136
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,200
And you're worried about chess?

137
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,530
Seriously?

138
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
He wants a Chess board.

139
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,320
You could've brought a small one.
You know chess makes me think better.

140
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,280
I don't understand,
why do I even give in to you?

141
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,530
My love, you know girls can't resist me.

142
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,990
Really? Then why didn't you call those girls?

143
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,820
I didn't call those girls
because you are special.

144
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
- I am not sure.
- About what?

145
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,070
- I am scared.
- What are you scared of, my love?

146
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,650
We're all going to die one day.
Why have fear, my dear?

147
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,990
Shut up, Makwana.

148
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,030
Darling...

149
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,990
You are going to get a teak wood coffin
made for me.

150
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,070
- Will you get lost already?
- I want to get lost.

151
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,240
If you get me a teak wood coffin,
I'll get lost from India.

152
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,740
I am listening.

153
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,150
Sit down.

154
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,610
Spell it out.

155
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,070
If you put me in a coffin and
take me to the Diu coast...

156
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,990
I'll take a boat straight to Dubai.

157
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,780
Come on, come on.

158
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,820
No.

159
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,860
A coffin won't work.

160
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,570
Why?

161
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,240
There's a dog squad at every checkpoint.

162
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,780
They are checking everything Makwana.

163
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,780
The Hollywood film Monster Monkey
has smashed box office records...

164
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,700
Well, think of something, my love.

165
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,280
In it's very first week, the high budget film...

166
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,150
Gorilla!

167
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,740
Gorilla?

168
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,070
If we put you in a gorilla suit...

169
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,610
And act like that this gorilla is going to
perform at the Diu Dussehra Fair.

170
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,200
Nobody will doubt a thing.

171
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,700
You mean I'll be on the streets
in a gorilla suit and...

172
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,900
Makwana.

173
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,450
The time for jokes is over.

174
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,320
The police has already
reached your Alibaug house.

175
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,650
Sooner or later, they'll be here as well.

176
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
Your choice.

177
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,990
12 hours in a gorilla suit...

178
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,200
or a lifetime in jail.

179
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,860
Uncle, what are you cooking?
It smells great.

180
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,150
There's abuses, punches, kicks .
What would you like?

181
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,360
Uncle you have every right to be angry,
but it was not my mistake.

182
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,070
Not your mistake?

183
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,570
People can mistakes with an order,
but you burned down the whole restaurant!

184
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,900
Helped that fugutive Makwana escape.

185
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,240
What next, riots in the city?

186
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,610
I have booked your ticket back home.

187
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,070
Get going next week.

188
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,780
You want me to go back?

189
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,740
Yes!

190
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,450
Ok, I'll go. I'll leave the moment
I have 15 lac rupees.

191
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,820
- How much have you saved so far?
- 15, 560 rupees!

192
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,950
Wow...

193
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,360
I've got nothing left to burn down, anyway.

194
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,150
Hear me out, uncle...

195
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,650
We have our truck, Girnar Express.

196
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Hey!

197
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Don't you dare talk about that truck.

198
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,110
Uncle, you have just bought the truck.

199
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,820
You don't even have a cleaner.

200
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,700
- So?
- So, here I am!

201
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,820
When there's a well in the backyard,
why go around with a begging bowl?

202
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,280
- Here, keep an eye on the vegetables.
- Yes.

203
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,110
Oh, Laakha and Waghela!

204
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,150
- Hello, Karsanbhai.
- What brings you here?

205
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,070
- We have come to fetch you.
- Why?

206
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,150
Please come in, have some water.

207
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,860
Laakha and Waghela,
my childhood friends.

208
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,070
They've come to take me to the village.

209
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,150
What do you mean?

210
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,990
Every November, there's a tri-motorcycle race
in our village.

211
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,650
But this time our champion
is out with a fracture.

212
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,900
It's a matter of the village's honour.

213
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,780
Don't worry uncle, go ahead.

214
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,900
If necessary, I will drive Girnar Express.

215
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,110
Don't even touch Girnar!

216
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,110
Just wash it.

217
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,360
And like this... from a distance.

218
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,400
- With a pipe, got it?
- But why? Don't you trust me?

219
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,490
It took me two years' hard work to
get the loan approved.

220
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,780
I am still waiting for
the national permit.

221
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,400
Uncle, you are getting emotional needlessly.

222
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,570
Look at me, even I have to repay my dad's loan
but I'm not worried!

223
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,780
You just listen.

224
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,490
I'll be back in two-three days.

225
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,570
If there's a booking in the meantime,
note it in the diary.

226
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,570
But do not touch Girnar.

227
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,490
Please avoid your usual antics.

228
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,110
Come on uncle, I am your nephew.

229
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,900
One day I'll make you proud.

230
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,150
You'll say, 'Well done, Charlie!'

231
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,320
Yeah, right.

232
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,070
Hail the divine mother!

233
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,990
Seems like a smart boy.

234
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,110
Not smart, oversmart.

235
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,950
Please help, it's very urgent.

236
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,450
I hear you ma'am...

237
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,950
but we only do local jobs.

238
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,490
Okay, thank you.

239
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,610
Madam, where do you want to go?

240
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,400
Diu, but he said that you guys
only do local jobs.

241
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,610
Don't listen to him,
he never travels far.

242
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,860
He's actually got piles, that's why.

243
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,490
Make your booking with me!

244
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,150
My uncle will be here in two days,
and will complete your delivery.

245
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,820
I don't have that long, you'll have to leave
tomorrow morning.

246
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,450
What is your delivery?

247
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,280
- Fridge, sofa, almirah, TV?
- A gorilla.

248
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,490
Gorilla... you mean, a monkey?

249
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,740
A big monkey.

250
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,240
He is performing at the Dussehra Fair.

251
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,820
Nice.

252
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,950
Can you take him?

253
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,150
I'll give you fifty thousand.

254
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,950
Fifty?

255
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,950
Okay, seventy five.

256
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,280
Seventy five!

257
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,320
3 months' EMIs in one trip!
Well done, Charlie!

258
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
I'll do it, madam! Absolutely!

259
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,650
But you'll have to pay extra
for the toll.

260
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,530
Okay, that's fine.

261
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,450
But one thing ma'am, I hope
your monkey isn't wild.

262
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,610
Oh no, he's very sweet. You'll see.

263
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,780
Very funny, I can't do this.
I'm not going to do this.

264
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,030
You look cute.

265
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't be shy.

266
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm the CEO of 250 companies and
an empire of 15 thousand crores.

267
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,070
MD Makwana in a monkey suit.

268
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,240
And you're telling to not be shy, wow!

269
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,900
Come on, it's all set in Diu,
JD is waiting for you.

270
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,740
The fabric is so tight.

271
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,860
I am sweating from all the wrong places,
and this itch... it's killing me.

272
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,900
- Just scratch me.
- But where?

273
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,400
Anywhere... but scratch!

274
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,570
The truck is here.
Stop behaving like a child.

275
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,570
Get ready, wear everything,
meet me in the garage.

276
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,990
- Everything is ready for you.
- Yeah yeah... thanks.

277
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,400
Don't be afraid, he is harmless.

278
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,150
Shake hands with Charlie, Toto baby.

279
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,030
Toto?

280
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,950
Nice name!

281
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,450
Hi Toto.

282
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,860
I told you, he's very sweet.

283
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,240
Take it easy.

284
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,820
Toto baby, stand up!

285
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,740
Madam, he understands everything!

286
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,530
Toto, stand on one leg.

287
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,200
Madam, this is superb!

288
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,950
Jiggy jiggy!

289
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,030
Wonderful, madam.

290
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,610
- Do the boobsy boobsy!
- Boobsy boobsy?

291
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,900
Toto, shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy
together.

292
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,990
Fantastic!

293
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,400
Faster now, shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy,
shaky-shaky boobsy-boobsy...

294
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,490
Okay, enough. You've understand now, right?

295
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,950
I have seen monkeys before,
but I've never seen such a well-trained gorilla.

296
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
Incredible.

297
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,360
- Let's get going?
- Yes.

298
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,990
But madam, you didn't tell me
it's such a heavy parcel.

299
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,950
How will we put him in the truck?

300
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,740
- Madam push! Careful!
- Push!

301
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,110
Harder, harder ma'am.

302
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,780
One minute.

303
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,610
Who's this joker, baby?

304
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,700
Got it, got it.

305
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,900
Madam give me hand, please.

306
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,530
We did it.

307
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,240
Here's the address and
the gorilla's papers.

308
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,950
I'll meet you at the Dussehra Fair.

309
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,610
Okay, madam.

310
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,200
Hey, what's that?

311
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,490
- What's inside?
- See for yourself, sir.

312
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,240
It's amazing. You wouldn't have
ever seen anything like it.

313
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,740
- Okay fine.
- No, please check properly sir.

314
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,280
Just leave, man. Don't be cheeky.

315
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,240
- Look at the traffic jam behind you.
- You haven't even checked!

316
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,110
He's crazy sir, he says I haven't checked
the truck properly.

317
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,740
- What's in the truck?
- A gorilla sir.

318
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,200
- Gorilla?
- He's an artist!

319
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,610
He's going to dance at the Diu Dussehra Fair.
Take a look!

320
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,860
We are looking for a fugitive,
not a monkey.

321
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
- Get moving.
- But what if...

322
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,490
The fugitive is escaping
in a gorilla suit?

323
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
What's he saying?

324
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,990
Sir, odd things happen nowadays.

325
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,280
You get air in chip packets.

326
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,030
Soap in mobile phone boxes.

327
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,900
A man in a woman's dress.

328
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,400
Well, what if you're an idiot
dressed as a man?

329
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,200
Quiet.

330
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,400
Do I look like I'm joking?
Get lost!

331
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,990
Get going or I'll fine you.

332
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,900
Sir, think about it...
You aren't doing your duty properly.

333
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,900
Bloody idiot... what an idiot.

334
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,820
A checkpost at every corner...

335
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,900
Always asking for passport, PAN card,
Aadhar card...

336
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,950
That's why I had to do that drama.

337
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,570
Otherwise he would've asked
for my permit.

338
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,740
And our truck doesn't have
a permit yet.

339
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,360
Shit.

340
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,070
Did you just say... 'shit'?

341
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,650
Maybe I'm hearing things.

342
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,400
What are you looking at, Toto?

343
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,360
Do you know who that is?
MD Makwana!

344
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,860
Champion of fugitives.

345
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,360
He just vanished with billions.

346
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,030
I have learned one thing.

347
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
Those who take a loan in billions,
leave the country.

348
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,490
And those who take a loan in millions,
leave the world.

349
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,610
Like my father.

350
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,240
Let it be. What do you know
about loans?

351
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,400
We've hit the highway now, sir.

352
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,610
Say Ta-ta to Mumbai, Toto!

353
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,030
What happened, Toto?

354
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,530
You're very moody.
You were sad, now you're happy.

355
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,780
But I don't get why your facial expression
is always the same.

356
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,950
I'm getting hungry.

357
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,570
You know Indore's food
is the best in the world.

358
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,740
My favourite is the bitter samosa.

359
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Let's stop at a nice eatery.

360
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,070
You can also eat some fruit.

361
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,570
What's your favourite? Bananas, right?

362
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,950
Don't worry, we'll get some.

363
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,200
You really like bananas that much?
We'll get really good ones up ahead.

364
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,740
Don't worry, I'll even get you
a banana milkshake.

365
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,950
A banana split ice-cream!

366
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,360
What are you doing?
Control, Toto... sit!

367
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,240
Damn it... it's a puncture.

368
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,860
I can't do this.
We'll have to wait for help.

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,650
Why are you making so much noise?

370
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,150
What?

371
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,700
What?

372
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,200
Football?

373
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,860
Toto, is this a time to play football?

374
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,610
You know how to change the tyre?

375
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,360
What? Open the lock?

376
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,610
You won't run away, right?

377
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,400
Too good.

378
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,950
Mona madam said you're a circus monkey,
but you should work in a garage.

379
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,110
My respect for your whole species
has gone up today.

380
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,450
I feel there's a human inside you,
who's dying to come out.

381
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,240
If you could talk, it would
really be amazing.

382
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,240
Try once! Like A for Apple...
B for Banana.

383
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,200
Really, you are too good.
What a monkey!

384
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,990
Sir, a cargo plane's engine failed
near Sasan village.

385
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,780
Ram Singh, I am a ranger,
not an engineer.

386
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Can't you see my knight is trapped?

387
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,650
Sir, the plane has crashed.

388
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,200
It was carrying the Ugandan gorilla
for the Junagarh Zoo.

389
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,110
- Remember that circular, sir?
- What are you talking about?

390
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,490
Hello? Alpha, come in.

391
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,360
- Sir this is Beta.
- Speak better.

392
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,860
Sir, not better! I mean, the alpha-beta Beta!

393
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,400
Got it Beta, what's the information?

394
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,650
Sir, both pilots have regained consciousness,
but the gorilla for the zoo is missing!

395
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,650
What's the location?

396
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,990
- The small hill in Zone 6.
- Wait, I am coming there.

397
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,150
Come on, Ram Singh.

398
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,150
I still don't know why they
fired me from the call center.

399
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,280
One evening, a lady customer
called and asked, 'what's the plan'?

400
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,030
I told her, there's no plan.

401
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,400
I'll finish my shift, go home,
eat dinner and sleep!

402
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,030
She got mad at me!

403
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,280
How would I know she was
asking about the mobile SIM plan?

404
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,530
Oh no Toto, looks like we are
out of luck again.

405
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,030
No more diesel.

406
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,570
It's not my fault!

407
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,360
Anyone can run out of diesel.

408
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,240
Wait here.

409
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,450
I'm stuck with such an idiot!

410
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,110
I have scratched myself red!

411
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,780
Get me out of this! I'm itching all over.

412
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,110
We're okay! There's a petrol pump
on the other side of the bridge.

413
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,700
I just need a little help from you.

414
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,200
Come out and push the truck!

415
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,900
- You bloody...
- What did you say?

416
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,150
Ah... B for Banana!

417
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,070
Superb! Keep trying...

418
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,860
You'll learn before we reach Diu.

419
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,650
Now come, push.

420
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,320
Push hard and jump in quickly!

421
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,700
Come on, get going.

422
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,860
Give it all you've got! Come on, tiger.

423
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,780
What are you doing? Give it some strength!
Can't even give a little push?

424
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,240
What happened?

425
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,610
Lost your breath?

426
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,860
Come on, give it all...

427
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,450
Toto... Toto...

428
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,740
Oh... sorry... I forgot...

429
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,360
Where has this guy come from?!

430
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,150
If you weren't there today,
who would push the truck?

431
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,200
That's why it is said...

432
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,400
Two is better than one.

433
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,490
Full tank.

434
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,740
Ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls,
from China or Japan...

435
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,990
- This is an old story!
- Well, tell us a new story then!

436
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,650
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

437
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,740
- Three and half thousand rupees.
- What?

438
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,530
- Three thousand five hundred rupees.
- Yes...

439
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,360
Oh no!

440
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,280
I forgot to take an advance
from Mona madam.

441
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,650
- Do you have a pipe?
- What?

442
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,110
I'll get a bucket.

443
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,450
I'm stuck here, and you want a bath?

444
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,530
Not for a bath dummy,
to take the diesel out.

445
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,200
Uncle, don't do this, please.
I have to take this gorilla to Diu...

446
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,530
But I promise I'll pay you
on the way back.

447
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,200
Is he saying something?

448
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,280
He's saying I'm honest!
He guarantees it.

449
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,820
The gorilla guarantees it?!

450
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,820
He's no ordinary gorilla.
He's the superstar of the Diu Fair!

451
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,150
He's fully trained!

452
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,150
He even talks! Want to hear it?
Toto, talk!

453
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,700
- B for Banana....
- Hold on... no going bananas.

454
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,610
Get the money and take your truck.

455
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,360
B for Banana...

456
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,860
Shit.

457
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,990
Thank you, thank you.

458
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,650
Go on, collect the money.

459
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,450
Thank you. Thank you.

460
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,530
Toto... Toto! Looks like it's time
for you to take the stage.

461
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,360
Looks like it's time for you
to take the stage. Look!

462
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,490

Toto, want to eat something?

490
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,450
I have fresh bananas,
shall I feed him?

491
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,320
He'll love it.

492
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,490
He likes bananas?

493
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,200
Say the word 'banana',
he goes nuts.

494
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,070
Banana.

495
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,400
Toto, you want bananas, boy?

496
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,070
"One two one two dance."

497
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,990
"One two one two dance."

498
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,820
Hello.

499
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,320
You work for the Diamond circus?

500
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,740
No you silly boy, I am the owner!

501
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,110
Singing, dancing, juggling,
dual performance... everything.

502
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,740
Diamond circus.

503
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,360
I saw your show.
Your monkey is a real performer!

504
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,150
He is the Hrithik Roshan of monkeys!

505
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,820
- That's true.
- Very good.

506
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,450
How much did you get him for?

507
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,610
I mean... If we were to do a deal...
then how much would I have to pay?

508
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,360
Toto is not for sale.

509
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,490
Here, Toto my boy!
Farm fresh bananas.

510
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,360
Here...

511
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,990
Go on... eat.

512
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,360
Oh my God... save me.

513
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,280
If we put him to work together,
we can split the profits fifty-fifty.

514
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,150
No, he's not mine.

515
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,450
Great! Just tell them you got off to pee...

516
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,740
he opened the cage
and escaped.

517
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,570
Listen...

518
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,200
I am giving you three lac rupees
as advance.

519
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,400
Three lac, and this is just an advance.

520
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,110
I can stretch it up to 15 lacs.

521
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,070
- Praise the Lord.
- Please let me eat in peace.

522
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,280
Of course, go ahead.

523
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,030
That's my card.

524
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,610
If you change your mind, just in case...
praise the lord.

525
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,030
Once I make up my mind,
it doesn't change.

526
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,490
Praise the Lord.

527
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,320
Praise the Lord.

528
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,780
"One two one two dance."

529
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,110
Toto... Toto baby...

530
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,820
You dance so well!

531
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,990
Top class, top class, baby.

532
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,030
Want to have a banana?

533
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,610
Toto!

534
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,900
If you're fasting, just say that!
I thought you were hungry.

535
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,860
It's okay... never mind.

536
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,900
Toto...

537
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,700
Toto!

538
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,820
"One two one two dance."

539
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,950
Praise the Lord!

540
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,110
Hey... where are you taking my truck?

541
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,200
Where are you going? Please stop!

542
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,200
Tonight, you'll dance to my tunes.

543
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,700
Hey please stop.

544
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,280
Please stop!

545
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:41,610
Come one, come all,
for the first time in your town!

546
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,320
Diamond Circus, an extraordinary experience.

547
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,780
Incredible sights, jokers, cycling,
flying trapeze acts...

548
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:55,150
Four shows a day, and of course,
special dances by Padma.

549
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,110
Toto! Toto!

550
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,610
Toto! Are you alright?

00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,490
Your favourite Padma!

573
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,570
Exit from the left side,
the next show starts in half an hour.

574
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,320
Hey, Paddu.

575
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,820
Paddu baby, what happened?

576
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,570
What's this new episode?

577
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,780
Patel, this was my last show.

578
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,950
I miss my family a lot.

579
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,820
That's it. No more.

580
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,360
What do you mean, no more?
Hey baby!

581
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,570
I've got an amazing item for you!
Toto!

582
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,490
It's going to be a smash hit.

583
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,650
Diamond Circus will shine again with
Padma and Toto!

584
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,150
High-five!

585
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,030
Patel, it has been 4 years.

586
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:55,990
I've cleared all my debts,
now please let me go.

587
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,780
And settle my dues... please.

588
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,700
Settle what exactly?
You've only paid the interest so far.

589
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,240
What about the principal?

590
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,070
Baby, don't worry.

591
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,200
Paddu baby, listen carefully...

592
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,320
I've got a scheme for you.

593
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,360
It will even everything out.

594
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,610
You...

595
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,650
Should...

596
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,450
Marry me.

597
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,820
Praise to the Lord!

598
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,400
- Have you lost it?
- There's no hurry.

599
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:39,030
Take your time, think about it.

600
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,070
Ask your mother if you like.

601
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,490
"One two... one two dance"

602
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,360
Hello... Hello... Madam...

603
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,400
- Who is it?
- Myself Charlie.

604
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,860
Charlie who?
The show is over, come tomorrow.

605
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,200
No, I need your help.

606
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,900
That Patel has stolen my truck
and my Toto.

607
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,990
Patel is a slimy scoundrel.

608
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,490
Why have you come here?
Go to the police.

609
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,650
The police ask too many questions.

610
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,490
He has the keys to my truck.
Please get it for me and I'll be sorted.

611
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,320
I promise I can help you too.

612
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,700
I know where he keeps his money.

613
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,860
You were eavesdropping on us?

614
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,950
- I was just...
- Who are you mister?

615
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,450
We have a transport business.

616
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,610
I need to get that monkey
to Diu by evening.

617
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,320
I'll be in big trouble if I don't.

618
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,700
I can drop you somewhere too,
if you like.

619
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,740
So you're going to
steal from Patel's office?

620
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,610
Of course.

621
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,030
Just get my keys. Please...

622
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:15,240
Don't think so much. Whenever I think a lot,
all hell breaks loose.

623
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,860
Pattu...

624
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,070
The weather changed so soon.

625
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,320
What brings you here, Padma baby?

626
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,570
Gramflour sweets.

627
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,240
- From my mother.
- Really?

628
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,900
Your mother is smarter than you.

629
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,570
Come near me.

630
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,240
Let's sit and eat together.

631
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,240
Care for a head massage?

632
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,700
You mean it? A head massage!

633
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,280
Who's there?

634
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,860
Hey kid... what happened?

635
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,200
That thief got into your office.

636
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,200
Hey... shut the main gate.

637
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,110
Charlie!

638
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,740
Catch them!

639
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,860
Sir, what's the big deal if the gorilla
stays in the wild for a few days?

640
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,490
He's not a wild gorilla, he's a zoo animal.
He won't survive.

641
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,240
Listen to the bird calls, for any movement.

642
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,780
Sir, you must have come across
many wild animals?

643
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,530
Don't ask Ram Singh, I've lost count.

644
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,990
One fine evening in the
Bandhavgarh forest...

645
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,900
Beta calling Alpha!

646
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,110
Yes, speak beta.

647
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,860
The boss called from the head office.

648
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,740
He wants an update on the gorilla,
come back soon.

649
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,320
Be alert.

650
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:21,780
Sir, what do we do if we suddenly
see the gorilla?

651
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,490
What can we do, whatever has to be done,
the gorilla will do!

652
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,530
That's how life is. It can fail anytime,
like a mobile phone network.

653
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,530
Why are you driving so badly?
Are you new to this?

654
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,900
What can I do?
The road is full of holes.

655
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,400
That's why I am telling
you to keep your eyes on the road.

656
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,570
But where are we going?

657
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,280
Adri village is up ahead.
I'll take a bus from there to Rajkot.

658
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,030
Rajkot?

659
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,070
- Hey...
- What's he upto?

660
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,860
I think he wants to meet you.
Padma meet Toto.

661
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,030
Maybe he's shy of you.

662
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,320
What kind of driving is that?

663
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,280
A black cat just crossed our path,
so I had to stop.

664
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,610
What do you mean?

665
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,320
A black cat brings bad luck.
Don't you know?

666
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,490
What say, Toto?

667
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,490
Toto?

668
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,280
Toto!

669
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,110
Toto!

670
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,650
Toto...

671
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,900
What happened, Toto?
Say something.

672
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,570
What happened?

673
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,030
Is there a hospital for animals nearby,
any veterinarian?

674
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,900
Let's go to Gadu. There's a zoo there.
I've heard there's an old doctor too.

675
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:15,030
Unless you take the full medicine,
I am helpless.

676
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,070
Do you see, it's a very deep wound.

677
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,650
And your haemoglobin has
reduced drastically.

678
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,900
See the colour of your blood,
it's all white.

679
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,570
This really looks like it's
from the British era.

680
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:49,450
- Hello?
- What do you mean, hello?

681
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,530
Anybody here?
We need to get this gorilla treated.

682
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,240
Just one second.

683
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,070
- You want to get him treated?
- Yes.

684
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,070
You really want to get him treated?

685
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:04,990
Yes.

686
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:10,570
One minute, I'll come from there...
Please don't go anywhere.

687
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,990
Just watch your step,
the path is a bit uneven.

688
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,650
Hello... you can't come inside.

689
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,700
Why?

690
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,860
Because he's a 'he', and you're a 'she'.

691
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,240
Gender matters... sorry.

692
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,900
Come... Carefully...

693
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,740
Careful, always be patient with patient.

694
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:46,570
- Doctor... will he be alright?
- Let me check, don't worry.

695
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,860
My God.

696
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,950
Please call his relatives.
He is no more, boss.

697
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:04,820
What?

698
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,820
Toto!

699
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,200
He's back, he's back!

700
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,280
Mr. Gorilla, can you tell me
where you are hurt?

701
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,400
Doctor, I think he can hear us a bit.

702
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,650
Yeah...

703
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,780
He can hear in small doses.

704
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:25,530
Yes!

705
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,110
Charging... Move back...

706
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,280
One...

707
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,900
Two...

708
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,950
Three!

709
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,070
Tell me! Where did you get hurt?

710
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,780
He fainted again!

711
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,450
- Don't worry.
- Doctor... he'll recover, right?

712
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,990
Of course... Of course.

713
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,110
He just needs a small booster shot.

714
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,150
Come Padma,
I'll drop you to the bus stop.

715
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,530
And your Toto, is he okay?

716
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,530
Yes, but the doctor said he'll take some time
to regain consciousness.

717
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,530
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

718
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,570
Isn't the doctor a bit strange?

719
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,530
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

720
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,530
He's piss drunk.

721
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,320
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

722
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,530
Don't mention it.

723
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,860
Of all the people I have met,
only you helped me.

724
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,700
In fact, you should run away with me.

725
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,990
Patel is a dangerous man.

726
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,110
I'll have to go back to Gadu, for Toto.

727
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,700
Have some bread, Toto...

728
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:42,240
Or an apple Toto?

729
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:45,900
Banana!

730
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,030
Oh God!

731
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,780
Spare me, for God's sake...

732
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,740
You want to play chess?

733
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:29,360
Why didn't you say so earlier?
You wreaked havoc.

734
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,820
Good boy.

735
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,490
Here we are, Adri bus depot.

736
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,200
So shall I leave?

737
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:45,740
Yes.

738
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:47,360
Sure?

739
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,950
Yeah.

740
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,280
Won't you give me your mobile number?

741
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,650
Well, I don't have a mobile.
You know, it causes cancer.

742
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,990
Don't laugh, I've read it.

743
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,610
Always stay the way you are.

744
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,900
Intelligent, right?

745
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,650
No, mad. Completely crazy.

746
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,240
Bye.

747
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,240
Check and mate!

748
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,320
You're a genius, you ape.

749
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:37,780
You're a champion,
you defeated Dr. Ganatra.

750
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:38,990
Dr. Ganatra!

751
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:45,400
Let me call Batook Lal, he doesn't know.

752
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,990
Hello, Ranger Soli Topi speaking.

753
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Hey Topi, you think you're some
Vishwanathan, right?

754
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,280
You've lost to me 9 times
in the last 3 weeks, Dr. Nobody.

755
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:07,450
Just stay there,
I am getting a champion to defeat you.

756
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,820
So you want to shoot from
someone else's shoulder.

757
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,990
By God, Ganatra...
Put the phone down, drunkard.

758
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,860
One for the road man. Cheers!

759
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:34,900
Speak.

760
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,030
Paddu darling!

761
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,570
This bird has flown the nest, Pattu.

762
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:47,950
GSRTC Bus no. 1825 from Adri to Rajkot,
has left the bus depot.

763
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:52,150
Do whatever you want,
you won't catch me again.

764
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:56,360
Okay, but I'll catch your
video game hero.

765
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,700
Hey!

766
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:04,450
Paddu, you know that
if you snooze, you lose!

767
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:05,990
Praise to the Lord!

768
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,740
Hello? Hello?

769
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,900
Where is the bus for Rajkot?

770
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,820
- Gone to Rajkot.
- You mean, it left?

771
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,320
Yes my friend, it has.

772
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,700
Yes, where do you want to go?

773
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,650
Surprise!

774
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,740
Where are you off to after
stealing my girl, boy?

775
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,240
Take this!

776
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,450
Give me my bag.

777
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,490
Take him away.

778
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,280
Mona madam, it's you!

779
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,990
Who are these people?
Where were they taking you?

780
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,360
Where's Toto?

781
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,320
He's at Dr. Ganatra's.

782
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,740
What doctor?

783
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,900
Nothing to worry about,
just a small injury on his head.

784
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,490
- What happened to his head?
- Don't worry, the doctor is with him.

785
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,740
Take me to him, right now.

786
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:45,240
Come on!

787
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,450
Madam, just a moment...

788
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,110
Hey you...

789
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,990
My bag...

790
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:05,740
This way... come on.

791
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,280
Thank you.

792
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,200
What happened here?

793
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,490
Paddu.

794
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,740
Where's Charlie?

795
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,490
What did you do to him?

796
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:42,900
He went to some Dr. Ganatra
with that madam.

797
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,950
Madam?

798
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:48,740
She is very dangerous!
She has an imported gun.

799
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,280
She even fired it!

800
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,070
Oh, stop!

801
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,820
Arvind, what's going on?

802
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,950
Why's there a bear in place of a monkey?

803
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,400
- He's the bear?
- Of course.

804
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,610
I don't know what's happening.
Please keep the show going.

805
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,740
- What do you mean, keep going?
- Just look at the crowd!

806
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,700
If they get angry, they'll beat us up.

807
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,200
What's your problem, man?

808
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,860
If you're afraid of fire,
why did you agree to the role?

809
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,950
You ruined the show!

810
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,860
At first, he was running scared...

811
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,700
Then suddenly, something happened.

812
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,110
As if his inner gorilla suddenly woke up.

813
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,650
I managed to save myself luckily.
It was dangerous.

814
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,070
And Toto?

815
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:37,530
If I didn't have my bike, I would be
resting in pieces.

816
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,700
Where's Toto right now?

817
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,490
I told you, Sasan village.

818
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,650
Come.

819
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,110
Toto!

820
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:06,860
Toto!

821
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,320
The whole village is deserted.
Maybe there's a cricket match today.

822
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,030
What?

823
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,990
There's nobody outside!

824
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:19,400
Go ask somebody where Toto is.

825
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:23,400
Whom do I ask?
All I can see is chicken.

826
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,780
Walk ahead.

827
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,110
You'll find somebody!

828
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,400
Toto!

829
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,740
Toto!

830
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,530
Toto!

831
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,280
Come inside!

832
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,860
There's a mad monkey in the village.

833
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,200
Yes! Where is he?

834
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:45,820
In the snack shop on the next street.

835
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,780
Come!

836
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,700
But why are we going to Sasan village?

837
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,990
That lady is already there,
and so is Charlie.

838
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:57,030
That's exactly why.
Something fishy is going on.

839
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,150
That lady has a gun. Hurry up.

840
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,490
What are you saying?
That lady has a gorilla...

841
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,610
And a gun too! She's dangerous.

842
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,070
Actually...

843
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,610
- I think we should...
- One second...

844
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,700
We should go to the ranger.

845
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,990
Please drive fast.

846
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,320
O all powerful monkey god! Throw away
my bad deeds and give me good sense.

847
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:22,110
I'm in real trouble...

848
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:28,110
Eat whatever you want,
but please let me go!

849
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,110
Help me mummy!

850
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,950
You stay here, I'll fetch him.

851
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,700
Makwana.

852
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:03,030
Baby, what has happened to you?

853
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,070
Are you okay, baby?

854
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,780
Wow!

855
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,740
I'm very impressed.

856
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,110
Just like a real gorilla.

857
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:21,030
Nice. Very good.
Shall we go now?

858
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,280
Okay... that's a bit much, Makwana.

859
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,400
You don't have to act so much
in front of me.

860
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,650
Come. Come on, let's go.

861
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,150
Come on... come on!

862
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,400
You're growling at me!

863
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,200
What's all this?

864
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:58,450
You are getting on my nerves now.

865
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,650
Come out when you are done
with your mood swings.

866
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,490
I am waiting.

867
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,610
Just can't believe it.

868
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,320
Why isn't he coming out?

869
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:26,150
He must be angry, he's a bit moody.
He's an animal, what can we do?

870
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,780
Let me try once.

871
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:35,200
Come on. Come on.

872
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,200
- Show some strength.
- I am trying.

873
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:43,320
Thank you Ganatra.
You have won this round.

874
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,030
I've been looking for your chess champion
for the last 6 hours.

875
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,240
Let's toast to that!

876
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,450
Come on.

877
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,530
- Let's party yaar.
- Just sit.

878
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,990
Just a minute, something's not right.

879
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,610
If this is the zoo's gorilla...

880
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,780
Why was Charlie taking him to the Diu Fair?

881
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,530
We'll find out in Diu. But first, we need
to get his medical done.

882
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:05,820
Drop me off at the big police station
in Diu.

883
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,780
No problem. Come on!

884
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,450
Okay let's go.

885
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:15,280
You guys be careful, the gorilla inside him
can wake up at any time.

886
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,780
I'm telling you, that woman is trouble sir.

887
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:26,530
She fired a gun at the bus depot,
and she has also stolen the zoo's gorilla.

888
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:27,610
Which gorilla?

889
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,070
The one that our government
ordered from Uganda.

890
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,150
Can you believe they are
making him dance in a fair?

891
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,280
Thank god the ranger caught him
and he's now at the right place.

892
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:39,490
Which ranger? What are you
talking about?

893
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:40,780
Ranger Soli Topi.

894
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,360
He has taken him to the hospital
for a medical.

895
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:47,780
Sir, I am really scared.
That woman is with Charlie.

896
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,490
Sir, please come with me.

897
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,990
Hurry up!

898
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,360
The Diu Dussehra Fair!

899
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,530
- Dr. Ganatra!
- Yeah, you've come, come let's go.

900
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,950
Where's the gorilla?

901
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,650
Where's he?

902
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,450
Looks like he escaped.

903
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,030
Escaped?

904
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,320
Sir, maybe the dose was inadequate.

905
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,780
So he woke up and got away.

906
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,610
I warned you guys.

907
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,200
His inner gorilla can wake up
at any time.

908
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,820
Sit. "Woke up, ran away"!

909
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:43,110
The Diu Dussehra Fair.

910
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,780
Mona madam, thank you very much.

911
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,740
This is the first job I have completed.

912
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,320
I am very sorry for all the
stress I caused you.

913
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,990
Just let me know if you ever need me.

914
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:57,240
Yes okay. Let's go.

915
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,280
Please settle my account.

916
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,530
I'll just relieve myself.

917
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,110
Hold on...

918
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,700
Take Toto with you,
he'll need to relieve himself too.

919
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,360
Come.

920
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,360
Take this urinal, I'll take that one.

921
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:33,360
Toto, I am really going to miss you.
Give it your all in your performance!

922
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,570
You're the best.

923
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,360
What happened, is it not coming out?

924
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,400
Stop, stop. Stay away.

925
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,400
Stay away please.

926
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,570
There are other gorillas here!

927
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,070
Who are you?

928
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,400
Toto?

929
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:18,490
Toto! You scared me.
Who's the other one?

930
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,780
He must be around here somewhere.

931
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,570
- Come on!
- Why would he go to the fair?

932
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,950
Girl?

933
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,400
Boobsy boobsy, shaky shaky?

934
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,700
Mona madam!

935
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,610
Mona madam clearly told me
to take you only till Diu.

936
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,400
How do I explain it to him?

937
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,990
Namaste? What are you doing?

938
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:54,110
Live long Toto!
My blessings are always with you.

939
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,820
Let me go, I've got other work.
I have to go back home.

940
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,570
Toto... Look!

941
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,900
The other one has also come.

942
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:10,650
- Mona madam, you have put me in a jam.
- What's happening, where's Toto?

943
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,900
- His family has come to take him back.
- What?

944
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,360
Topi...

945
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:25,320
Finish the job!
Two gorillas with one shot.

946
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,650
Not two, just one gorilla with one shot.

947
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,110
That's why I say,
don't drink on duty Ganatra!

948
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,070
Sir, put your gun down and see.

949
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:43,900
No, no, no.

950
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:47,070
You said there's only one, there are two.

951
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,650
In my opinion, we shouldn't meddle
in their family affair.

952
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,280
Have you completely lost it?

953
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,070
- If you value your life, run!
- But where's Toto?

954
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,610
Come on, you want to fight?

955
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,400
He seems to be getting horny.

956
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,030
Don't come ahead.

957
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,860
You've hit the bull's eye again.

958
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,110
Bull's eye.

959
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,110
How many gorillas came for
the Junagarh zoo from Uganda?

960
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,360
Sir, one gorilla.

961
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:38,360
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.

962
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:43,070
That second gorilla belongs to
that guy with the truck.

963
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:46,070
Don't stress about him,
that's his personal gorilla.

964
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,650
How many times do I need to tell you?

965
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:16,030
Mona! I hate bananas!

966
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:17,610
Makwana, thank God.

967
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:20,110
- I had almost forgotten your face.
- Oh really?

968
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,740
You couldn't find a bigger idiot
to get the job done?

969
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,240
Do you know what he put me through?

970
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,320
- Do you even know?
- I am sorry.

971
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,200
But there's no time for all this.

972
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,780
We need to head to the jetty.

973
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:31,860
Makwana!

974
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,530
I thought there's some
humanity in this gorilla.

975
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,900
But it was the devil instead!

976
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,070
I am sorry Charlie, but we can't
leave a witness behind.

977
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,030
No madam, please don't kill me.
I won't tell anyone!

978
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:48,740
Turn.

979
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,280
Makwana sir, what did I do to you?

980
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:55,280
I took you to the doctor.
Gave you medicine, fed you bananas.

981
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,070
Fed me bananas?
Let me feed you some bullets.

982
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,570
Please don't do this.

983
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,610
Please... please... Makwana sir.

984
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,200
Mr. Makwana?

985
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,490
Hello? Sir?

986
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:14,280
Padma, thank God you're here.

987
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,400
Everything is going wrong here.

988
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,610
But why did you get the cops?

989
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,450
I was going to return your bag.

990
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:23,610
- I have come for you.
- Really?

991
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,240
You know, the ranger took your gorilla
away safely.

992
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,030
No Padma, he is not a gorilla.

993
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,400
What do you mean?

994
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:32,240
Sir, he was gorilla earlier,
but not anymore.

995
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,740
- If not a gorilla, then what is he?
- He's a human!

996
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,110
Look, I had a man with me
who was dressed as a gorilla.

997
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,240
So there's no gorilla?

998
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,280
There is a gorilla,
but the other one.

999
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,360
What's this nonsense?

1000
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,450
Sir, it was Makwana inside the costume.

1001
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,950
Now who is this Makwana?

1002
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,530
The man who swindled billions of rupees!

1003
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:52,490
And the government has put a price
of 15 lacs on his head.

1004
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:56,360
Sir please arrest him.
He didn't even pay my money.

1005
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:58,400
Did you see him?

1006
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,570
Yes sir, with my own eyes!

1007
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,990
He has taken my truck and
gone towards the jetty.

1008
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,360
The very special event of Junagarh,
celebrated in November,

1009
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,950
A grand welcome to you
at the annual tri-motorbike race.

1010
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,740
We'll see who is the fastest!

1011
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:28,070
All the racers have started.
All are trying to be ahead.

1012
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:35,110
Ramji bhai is ahead...
but Chhagan bhai is close...

1013
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,950
and Karsan bhai is
trying to snatch the lead.

1014
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,740
Karsan bhai has maintained the lead.
He is running away with it!

1015
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,110
Oh my God!

1016
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,320
Oh, you're looking lovely.

1017
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:58,950
But I have one request, darling.

1018
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,320
Don't ever bring me stupid
ideas about gorillas or monkeys.

1019
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,780
Looks you are in shock.

1020
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,610
Come on Makwana.
You're done with the gorilla suit.

1021
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,900
Now don't hold on to its tail.

1022
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:12,320
My darling, gorillas don't have tails.

1023
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:15,530
But you are absolutely right,
past is past and future is future.

1024
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:17,490
But tell me, where are we...

1025
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,400
Police! Mona?

1026
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,280
Sir, there's Makwana... arrest him.

1027
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:28,150
Not this boy again, God,
not him again!

1028
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:34,780
Peace bro... world peace.

1029
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,780
Maki... that's JD, my brother.

1030
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,070
JD.... Maki.

1031
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,110
JD, the grand organiser!

1032
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,780
Why have you brought them here?

1033
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:53,900
The boy has recognised you,
we can't take any chances.

1034
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:57,900
You guys get going,
I'll take care of them, all the best.

1035
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,320
- Good.
- Attention!

1036
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,240
Who are these guys?

1037
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,030
Who are you?

1038
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,030
Myself Soli Topi.
Sasan-Gir, forest department.

1039
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,700
We followed this truck here.

1040
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:19,650
There was a gorilla sighted
in the Diu city area.

1041
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:22,700
And I suspect this is a
case of poaching.

1042
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:26,030
Because the skin is here,
but where is the body?

1043
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,280
Topi...

1044
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,700
I told you this was a bad idea.

1045
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:35,530
Dr. Ganatra, behave yourself.

1046
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:39,570
Not her, next to her... MD Makwana.

1047
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,200
MD Makwana!

1048
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:48,740
Wow! The criminal who everyone from
Dubai to Delhi was looking for...

1049
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:51,320
You caught him in Diu, well done!

1050
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:55,900
Tomorrow's headlines are going to be...
'Loan fraudster's escape failed....

1051
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:57,360
'The fugitive got jailed.'

1052
01:29:57,650 --> 01:30:00,530
And inspector, your promotion is guaranteed.

1053
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:04,030
Topi!

1054
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:09,530
That's the boy with the truck
who brought the gorilla to my clinic.

1055
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:12,280
What did you do to the gorilla?

1056
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,950
- Nothing.
- Topi sir, that was not a gorilla.

1057
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,150
What rubbish!
How can he not be the gorilla?

1058
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,740
I saw him with my own eyes.

1059
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:21,700
You are absolutely right sir,
there was a gorilla but the other one.

1060
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,320
That's what I am asking,
where is the other gorilla?

1061
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:26,700
- But that was a different one.
- One minute...

1062
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,900
Let's start from childhood.

1063
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:32,990
The gorilla that you
brought to my clinic...

1064
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,240
- Where is that one?
- Right here.

1065
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,780
He's no gorilla,
he is a pigeon...

1066
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:40,280
And these two scoundrels
are helping him fly away.

1067
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,570
This policeman here is helping
this fugitive Makwana.

1068
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,820
Absolutely right!

1069
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,570
That's it my boy,
that's the way it should be.

1070
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,070
Leave quickly, the boat is ready.
I'll stop them here.

1071
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,360
No mistakes this time, kill him.

1072
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,360
Inspector!

1073
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:57,570
Not now, after I leave.

1074
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:00,820
You know I hate violence.
Come on, baby.

1075
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,650
Hail the divine goddess!

1076
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:05,780
Hail the divine goddess!

1077
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:08,740
- Uncle is here too?
- What's this group?

1078
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:21,360
What games are you up to,
you two bit boy?

1079
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,400
I clearly told you to wash Girnar,
that too from a distance.

1080
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,280
And you are driving
it all over the place!

1081
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:30,030
What are you doing with this fugitive?

1082
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:32,820
No Uncle, you've got it all wrong.
These people have trapped me!

1083
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:36,320
This madam said,
drop him to Diu, I'll pay a lot.

1084
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:39,280
I didn't know that this man is getting
away with the entire country's money.

1085
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,030
- Did we get our money?
- No, not at all.

1086
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:45,280
Then I can't let him go.

1087
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,320
Gather around him,
hail the mother goddess!

1088
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,490
Mona, where are you?

1089
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,240
Mona! Mona!

1090
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,900
Somebody get me out of here! JD!

1091
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,280
Stop spinning him!

1092
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,450
Let go.

1093
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,860
Uncle, what are you doing?

1094
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,860
I will give you a lot of money, let me go.

1095
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:09,990
You stay there, that's where you belong.

1096
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,320
I will give you guys a lot of money,
somebody just get me out of here.

1097
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:26,740
Charlie!

1098
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,150
Charlie!

1099
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:31,700
Charlie...

1100
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:46,400
Charlie... Charlie!

1101
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,990
Mona darling... up here.

1102
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,950
Mona, come on Mona.

1103
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,820
Get me out from here.

1104
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:17,150
- Hurry up! Mona, please hurry up!
- Hold on, one sec.

1105
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,280
Put me down.

1106
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:22,360
Charlie... Makwana!

1107
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:25,110
Come on, Mona, come on!

1108
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,200
Hurry, hurry!

1109
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:32,610
- Stop, Makwana!
- Hey stop, or I'll shoot.

1110
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,150
Come on!

1111
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,950
- Come on, baby.
- Careful!

1112
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:54,900
I love you India but sorry!
Come on go... let's go.

1113
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:59,150
Bananas? Who brought bananas?
You know I hate bananas.

1114
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,450
Hurry up.

1115
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,820
This cursed boy won't go!

1116
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,240
Bloody hell.

1117
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,240
Drop the rope.

1118
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,950
- Drop the rope!
- No, no.

1119
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:46,150
- Please don't shoot.
- This is the last warning.

1120
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,200
Oh Mona darling...

1121
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:26,240
And that's how Makwana's story ends.

1122
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,570
Charlie got his reward of
15 lac rupees.

1123
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:34,200
And he paid off his father's debt.

1124
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,320
Well done, Charlie!

1125
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,490
Perhaps that's why they say...

1126
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:43,200
Those who don't do anything,
do great things.
