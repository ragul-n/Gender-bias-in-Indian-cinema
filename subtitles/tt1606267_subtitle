1
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:25,197
When you start pissing
blood through your nose...

2
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,825
...fear runs cold down your spine.

3
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:34,706
And anyone who says he
isn't scared, is lying.

4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,957
When your opponent realizes that you
are pissing through your nose then...

5
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,223
Option one...
even he is struck by fear.

6
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,533
Or option two...he's rejoicing.

7
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,643
ln any case, he has lost focus.

8
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,818
Like a mad rabid dog
he begins to go berserk.

9
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:32,998
Then...then he comes and
stands exactly where you want him.

10
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:46,409
The right punch at the right time.

11
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,648
Some call it luck.

12
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,523
l...call it smartness.

13
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,303
My brave tiger!

14
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:36,624
These birds, these wandering souls,
they are wild birds

15
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:42,328
They take life head-on,
these wild birds

16
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:51,069
Taking their flights of fancy

17
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,578
They go past each hurdle

18
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:01,681
playing hide and seek with death

19
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:06,758
A game with danger is their whim

20
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,697
They play fair; they
play dirty, these wild birds

21
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,010
Fire seethes in their hearts

22
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:12,752
One dream seized makes way for another

23
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:13,884
Boys, the class is over.

24
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,690
Nothing can stop them now

25
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:19,493
No hurdle, no worries

26
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:22,057
High on life

27
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:25,161
These studs will romp freely

28
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,799
Taking their flights of fancy

29
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,013
They go past each hurdle

30
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:40,514
playing hide and seek with death

31
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:46,081
A game with danger is their whim

32
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,724
They play fair;
they play dirty, these wild birds

33
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:52,856
Rameshwara!

34
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:58,595
Can't you hear?

35
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,733
What's wrong with your cheek?

36
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:04,470
All the time you have a
broken nose, head, ears...

37
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,034
Granny, my ear, Granny.

38
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,545
Why have you tied this
kerchief around your head?

39
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,707
Have you taken up a
job of lifting bricks?

40
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,478
Will you please go home?

41
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,609
What go home?

42
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,880
C'mon, now drop us.

43
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,612
Drop you?

44
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,090
Why? Are you ashamed of having
an old woman sit on your bike?

45
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,619
Granny, you sit behind me.

46
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:23,993
Oh!
- Come on.

47
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,535
Sapna, wear what you
were wearing yesterday.

48
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,967
You look hot in it.

49
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:38,835
l'll meet you at the same place.

50
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,239
Hey, easy, easy.

51
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:43,708
l'll call you later.

52
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,583
Loser. You don't have a cell phone?

53
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,514
Why will l give my cell
number to every chick?

54
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:50,987
point. point.
- Yeah.

55
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:54,959
Who among you is Faisal Latif Sheikh?

56
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:57,921
What's the matter, sir?

57
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,897
He's got the padmashree award.
We are here to give it to him.

58
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,591
l am Faisal.

59
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,928
You?

60
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,031
What's with the slapping, sir?

61
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,866
Hey, hero!

62
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,609
You want to fight?

63
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,278
Sir, he's the same fighter.

64
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,605
Hey, fighter...

65
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:17,975
You'll hit me?

66
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,109
You son of a...

67
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,621
Let go, pawar.
Why are you creating a scene?

68
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,627
Look at him Anna (Big brother).
Messing with a cop.

69
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,289
Take it easy.

70
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:32,956
He's Usman's man.

71
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:34,090
What has Chaddi done?

72
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,570
We got a tip-off that he steals
car logos from Dadar parsee Colony.

73
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,696
Chaddi?

74
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,641
No, Anna. lt must be
Taikalwaadi's Faisal.

75
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,169
Oh, pawar. Where is Taikalwaadi?

76
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,304
Where is Tilakwaadi?

77
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,642
Go catch hold of that Faisal.
Landge, all well?

78
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,307
Yeah. Good.

79
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,316
Been a while.
- Yeah, let's catch up.

80
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,711
Mr. Fighter.

81
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,047
Better take it easy...

82
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,316
Else Daddy will be angry.

83
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,050
Good joke!

84
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:02,652
See you again.
- Yeah, see you.

85
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,923
That's how relations are maintained.
- Bye.

86
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,328
Come on, Landge.

87
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,759
Two slaps and you wet your pants?
- No, Anna.

88
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,933
What no? l can see you trembling.
C'mon now.

89
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,607
Let's get some tea.

90
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:31,688
What are these guys playing?

91
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,687
lt's called tribal football.

92
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,380
Come here!
- What happened?

93
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,118
You guys carry on, we'll be back.

94
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,734
You Madrasi, get lost from here.

95
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,211
Diesel, look at this hero uncle.

96
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,841
Dude, what's your name?

97
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,683
Ajay. - Dude, couldn't
you find a girl from...

98
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,746
...any other waadi
(neighbourhood) to play wheelie?

99
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,691
ldiot, it's called skating dance.

100
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,728
And she's our very own Kareena Kapoor.

101
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,759
Yes. l am Kareena Kapoor.

102
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,294
Now get lost from here.

103
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,159
Nandu, tell him.

104
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,293
Hey, Dance Bar...

105
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,095
What'll you do otherwise?

106
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,706
l'll hit you so hard...

107
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,832
...you'll have to keep holding it
the rest of your life.

108
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,434
pinky, chill.

109
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:58,869
Guys give her a break.

110
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,074
Hey, hey...

111
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,010
Ganpati (lndian
festival) is not anytime soon.

112
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,985
What are you guys practicing for now?

113
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:08,845
Nandu...

114
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:09,980
You know lndia's Got Talent?

115
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,387
They are practicing for that.

116
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,220
What are you saying!

117
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:15,284
Straight away at the
country level. Wow!

118
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,726
Dance Bar, can l also come along?
please...

119
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,161
l'll shower notes when you dance.

120
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,289
10 rupee notes.

121
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,193
Bloody losers!

122
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,066
You will do nothing but
screw everybody's happiness.

123
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,038
Hey, Dance Bar, wait!
- lt's pointless talking to you.

124
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:28,331
Wait!

125
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,200
You freaks!

126
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,003
Have you gone crazy?

127
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,137
Why are you getting so upset?

128
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,077
Get lost! Get lost!

129
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,220
C'mon guys quick.

130
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,988
Fahim, light it.

131
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,488
l am.

132
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:58,961
You little pest! How many times have
l told you to stop this nonsense!

133
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,338
Do l ever stop you
from speeding your bike?

134
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,242
Have you noticed
your size, you midget?

135
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,405
Let go off my collar. Let go!

136
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,342
Fahim, tell him to
keep his hands off me.

137
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,853
He'll be a goner if l lose it.

138
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,785
lf l see you smoking again
l'll hang you upside down...

139
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:21,452
...and put your rear on fire.

140
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:23,988
Acting smart with me, huh?
- Yes.

141
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,792
lf l don't mess up your
bike in the next two days...

142
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,959
...l won't call myself Babloo Mane.

143
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,195
Fahim, note it down.

144
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,930
What are you laughing at?

145
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,070
l am getting out of here.

146
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,338
Acting smart, huh?

147
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:47,876
Nandu, even l want to
become a fighter like you.

148
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,212
Will you take me along?

149
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:52,823
My dear midget, one little smack is
all it takes for you to wet your pants.

150
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,084
And you want to fight, is it?

151
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,351
Buzz off!

152
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,293
l know you are scared of me.

153
00:11:57,497 --> 00:12:01,058
The day l become a good boxer,
nobody will pay attention to you.

154
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,093
You are right man.

155
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,299
Hello?

156
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,910
Yes, Bhai. Right now?

157
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,574
Okay, l'll be there. 10 minutes.

158
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,476
Baldy's call?

159
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,577
Abhishek Bachchan's call. C'mon.

160
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,516
Nandu, beware of Baldy.

161
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,025
He'll make minced meat out
of you and have it for dinner.

162
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,865
Kudroos Miyaa! The meat's just right.
- Oh good.

163
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,062
please serve it outside.

164
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,935
ls Usman Bhai there?
- Yeah. Upstairs.

165
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,339
lsn't Nandu here yet?

166
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,415
Come.

167
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,544
No, no, not there, sit next to me.

168
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:03,184
So, One Shot,
l have heard you like driving fast.

169
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,497
Anna has to go somewhere on business.

170
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,901
You have to drive him there.

171
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,936
l drive for pleasure, Bhai.
Not for business.

172
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,196
Listen to me, Usman...

173
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:50,538
Look, Anna. He'll go with you today;
tomorrow he'll learn something else.

174
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:52,543
That's how he'll get
to know the business.

175
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,603
Nandu's still young.
He has enough time to learn.

176
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,343
Listen, Anna...
- Keys? Car keys?

177
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,687
Atta boy!

178
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,219
Qasim! Get my parcel.

179
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:18,262
Listen, hero, that's just to be kept.
Not to be used.

180
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,697
He can use it only
when he keeps it, right?

181
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,147
So, hero, what's the deal?

182
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:33,376
What?

183
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:34,976
The other day you were
about to rap a cop...

184
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,716
...now Usman wants to
pull you into his business.

185
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,382
What's up with you?

186
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,425
No big deal, Anna.
l want to be like you.

187
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,123
You've lost it!

188
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,068
There's a huge difference between you
and me. Do you get it, One Shot Nandu?

189
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,004
ln your line of work, one shot
means one loses the fight...

190
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,199
...and is out of the game.

191
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:01,376
ln my line, one shot means death.
End of game.

192
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,207
Are you getting the difference?

193
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:10,078
Anyway, forget it.
Get out of this nasty circle.

194
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:13,091
A friend of mine runs a bar in Malad.

195
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,457
l've put in a word. Call him.
He'll get you a job.

196
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:20,490
What's the job?

197
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,228
Scrubbing dishes! Are you up for it?

198
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:27,664
Oh c'mon, Anna!

199
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,231
You think l'll reduce you
to a dish washer, is it?

200
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:32,771
You and your wits, Anna.

201
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,048
lt's simple.
You just have to stand guard...

202
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,051
...and flex those muscles of yours.
A bouncer's job. Simple.

203
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,211
Have you lost it, Anna?!

204
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,118
You want me to become a bouncer!
Me? A bouncer?

205
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,647
What's wrong with it?
An honest job isn't your thing, is it?

206
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,794
l fight honestly, don't l?

207
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,122
l am trying to...

208
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,694
Stop the car ahead.

209
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,406
lf l don't return in 15 minutes go
straight to Usman. l'll meet you there.

210
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:13,082
Hey, Rambo, give that to me.
Leave the engine on.

211
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,393
Hey, Hritik Roshan! Hey, Raju!

212
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,764
You are so handsome.
Give me 5 bucks, wont you?

213
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:31,227
Give it darling.

214
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,101
You came in a car but you'll go
back in a helicopter. l swear!

215
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:34,503
l have a black tongue.

216
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,268
What l say comes true.
l have a direct connection with God.

217
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:39,470
Now give me some money please.
lt's raining. please hurry.

218
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,237
Here. Go.

219
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,839
20 bucks! Your fortunes will change.

220
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,850
l'll have dinner in your name today.
Look here, wont you?

221
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,616
Let's go, let's go, Nandu!

222
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,145
Trap them! Trap the bastards!

223
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:26,883
Turn right.

224
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,759
You are hit, Anna!
l am taking you to a hospital.

225
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,230
lt's nothing. We must reach Usman.

226
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,790
This is not the time for heroism,
Anna. Here, tie this around your....

227
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:40,363
What the hell did you do?!

228
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,606
l think...l hit someone.

229
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:46,304
A million times l told you to stay out
of this, but you didn't listen to me!

230
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,544
What now? - What now?! Drive fast.
l'll think of something.

231
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,583
Nandu, stop the car.

232
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,652
Why?

233
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:03,922
Stop the car and run off.

234
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,588
l am not leaving, Anna.

235
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,860
Do as l say. Open the door.

236
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:11,527
Anna!
- Stop the car.

237
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,348
Open the door Anna!

238
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,855
You moron! You couldn't see
someone right in front of your car!

239
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,900
The windshield was shattered,
Bhai. l couldn't make out.

240
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,975
And Anna? Where did you leave him?

241
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,739
Anna left with the car, Bhai.

242
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:01,548
Anna saved half your life.
And has left the remaining half to me.

243
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,322
Bhai, Anna's dead.

244
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,509
l am leaving, mom. l am late.

245
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,551
Don't leave without your lunch box.

246
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,348
Can l get some tea, mom?
- Yes.

247
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:13,322
Mom, because of her dancing,
people call her Dance Bar.

248
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,992
They call you a Loser.
Did l ever say it bothers me?

249
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,654
l am not talking to you.

250
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:20,059
You wouldn't dare.

251
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,492
l'll slap you so hard; all that
arrogance will fly out of the window.

252
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:23,967
Really? C'mon. l dare you.

253
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,531
What's going on here?

254
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,403
Look at her, mom.
She starts her day with a fight.

255
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:30,533
Enough said now.

256
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,072
What do l care? Keep pampering her.

257
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:37,006
You'll realize your mistake when she
dances in a bar and shames all of us.

258
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,379
At least l'll be working.

259
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:41,016
Will you two shut up! Let me study.

260
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,411
There goes Madam Barrister!

261
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,956
This house is filled
with weird characters.

262
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,082
Go safely.

263
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,087
Chaddi, please drop me.
l am running late.

264
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,787
Again!

265
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:53,360
l seem to be running a
nice taxi service here.

266
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,364
Sai Baba (lndian saint),
get me to work on time.

267
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,673
Mom, uncle's here to
collect the lunch boxes.

268
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,034
Let's go.

269
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,379
Kokhon Da, your 9;13 train is gone.

270
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,712
Better not, dear.
Will cost me a casual leave.

271
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:25,387
They say, everyone's destiny is
written beforehand. So is mine.

272
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:28,895
But mine seems to be
written in English.

273
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:32,996
l hardly get it.

274
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,768
No matter how hard l try
l just can't make sense of it.

275
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:44,416
Otherwise what's a terrific
dancer like me doing here?

276
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,013
Forget it, pinky!
Don't even try, it's in English!

277
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,570
pinky, again you are here.

278
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:22,782
lf l find you here one more time during
work hours l'll have to sack you.

279
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,451
Now get back to work.

280
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:28,454
Sorry, sir.

281
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:29,585
Mad girl.

282
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,897
He caught me again.
- What did he say?

283
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:37,526
l will sack you.

284
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:40,466
Size 7 for an hour.

285
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,642
You know what 'sack' means, right?

286
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,136
He'll fire you.

287
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,208
You think l want to
spend my life here?

288
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,015
But dear, whatever time you spend here,
make it as peaceful as possible.

289
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,209
Didi, l want that red one.

290
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,013
Blue won't do?

291
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,146
No.
- Why?

292
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,149
Let's go.

293
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:05,221
Hey look at that.

294
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:06,891
Little Miss Sunshine is on a romp.

295
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,629
Not bad! Looks like your
sweetheart is falling for her.

296
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:13,501
Excuse me! He's not my sweetheart!

297
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:15,039
We just practise together.

298
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:17,839
Didn't you say the other day
that he's absolutely mad about you?

299
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:19,170
He is. l am not.

300
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,603
Oh!

301
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,580
Tell me, does he make a pass
at you while dancing? Don't lie.

302
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:26,843
A pass and him? No way.
He's such a sissy!

303
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:28,210
But l never miss a chance.

304
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:30,579
Way to go!

305
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,521
Auto! Tina, Hurry up!

306
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,649
Yeah, coming.

307
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:37,586
What is it?

308
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,031
passport...
- passport?

309
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:44,198
lndia's Got Talent.
Audition's happening soon.

310
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,965
50 lakh rupees and my passport
to get out of here.

311
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,039
50 lakh rupees!

312
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:51,805
One day this passport
will have my photo on it.

313
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,008
lt will. lt surely will.
But can we leave now?

314
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:58,547
Otherwise your 50 lakhs
will cost me my 10;50 train!

315
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,584
You can't make it on time
even on a holiday, Ajju?

316
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,988
You'll go crazy if l tell you why.

317
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,198
Look at this.
- World Championship video!

318
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,159
Sarah and Matthew!

319
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,294
What are you saying!

320
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,294
Show me.
- Yeah, yeah, let it start.

321
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,304
What a lovely turn...

322
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,071
Look at their twists!

323
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:30,841
Oh! Even we can do this.

324
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,751
Really? Let's see.

325
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,177
C'mon.

326
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:58,173
You Madrasi, get lost from here.

327
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,602
Dude, what's your name?
- Ajay.

328
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:03,873
Dude, couldn't you find a girl from...

329
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,007
...any other waadi (neighbourhood)
to play wheelie?

330
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,608
ldiot, it's called skating dance.

331
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,017
And she's our very own Kareena Kapoor.

332
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:12,613
Yes. l am Kareena Kapoor.

333
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:13,988
Now get lost from here.

334
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,718
Nandu, tell him.

335
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:16,852
Hey, Dance Bar...

336
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:18,687
What'll you do otherwise?

337
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,330
l'll hit you so hard...

338
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,094
...you'll have to keep holding it
the rest of your life.

339
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:25,961
Wait.

340
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,198
You freaks!

341
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,332
Have you gone crazy?

342
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,642
Why are you getting so upset?

343
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,973
Get lost! Get lost.

344
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,843
Miss Joan of Arc!

345
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,389
They have left. Don't be so upset.

346
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:01,030
pinky, look at me.

347
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,103
You are a superb dancer.

348
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,668
l haven't seen a better skate
dancer than you in the whole world...

349
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:08,906
...let alone in this waadi.

350
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,676
l know that.

351
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,015
l am not angry
because l doubt my talent.

352
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,413
l am angry because
l am born amidst these people!

353
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:22,683
They don't want to come up in life...

354
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:25,362
But they will pull down
others who try so.

355
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,928
But nobody can stop me.

356
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,398
No matter how hard they try.

357
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:42,043
We won't practise here from tomorrow.

358
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,442
Hello, Tina...

359
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:06,729
Even a bicycle can't venture here,
leave alone a cab.

360
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,236
Oh shut up! Some walking
will do you good anyway.

361
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,878
This side is yours.

362
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:24,046
And that's for the hens.

363
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,888
Tina darling, how awesome are you!

364
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,757
pinky, what the hell is this!

365
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,391
Can't we just practise at the school?
- please, Ajay.

366
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:34,863
l don't have a choice, right?
- Right.

367
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:36,825
Okay, then.

368
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:40,829
Will this do?

369
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:41,964
lt's perfect.

370
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:45,036
What's this fan doing here?

371
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:49,440
lt's 'doing' those chicks!

372
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,440
l'll give you one...

373
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,518
Not here sweetie...later...
when we are alone...

374
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:00,414
Mom, l'll be late tomorrow.

375
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,384
Skating?

376
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:05,123
Will you skate for your
husband after you get married?

377
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:10,960
You won't get it now. You'll realize
the day you see me on TV.

378
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,435
Go give your brother some food.

379
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:15,466
poor thing must be tired
watching TV the whole day!

380
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,535
Mom! ls dinner ready?

381
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,189
Ajay! Don't trip!
- Sorry, sorry.

382
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,317
l can't do it any more now.

383
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:36,452
Just once more.
- No.

384
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:37,825
Just one more time.
- Okay, c'mon.

385
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,908
Yeah, Tina...

386
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,579
lt's raining very hard.
l'll call you later.

387
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:11,286
What the hell did you do?!

388
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,592
l think...l hit someone.

389
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:52,426
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Kadam.

390
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,902
What's the scene?

391
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,239
Anna shot Yadav at
point blank in Raja lane.

392
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:03,005
Yadav's men followed him.
They fired two rounds at him.

393
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,911
Anna was dashing ahead.
He even hit a girl on the way.

394
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,587
Finally, he banged the car here.

395
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,388
Anna's body?

396
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:20,989
lt's in patkar hospital.

397
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,143
Kadam, give me the torch.

398
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:02,531
Anna took the wheel after coming here.

399
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:04,966
Someone else was driving
till he reached this spot.

400
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,003
Match the footprints with Anna's.

401
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:11,482
Test the blood
samples and finger prints.

402
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,041
Yes, sir.

403
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,111
How's the girl?

404
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,983
Huh?
- The girl?

405
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,349
She's in a coma.

406
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,671
Noor, get me a cup of tea.

407
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,009
Chaddi, what did that specialist say?

408
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,145
Speak up man!

409
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,151
There's nothing left to say.

410
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:55,484
What do you mean?

411
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:01,189
l mean there's no hope. She'll be blind
for the rest of her miserable life.

412
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:05,031
There must be some hope. National
Geographic is full of such miracles.

413
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,568
Right now, the doctor is
saying there's no hope.

414
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,472
And he is among the
top doctors of Mumbai.

415
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:22,049
Nandu, here's the balance
after paying the doctor.

416
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:25,381
put it in the bank in her name.

417
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,789
This will barely suffice
for a fortnight's medicines.

418
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,328
Anna destroyed her life.

419
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,290
l admire Usman Bhai...

420
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,735
He's a true friend...

421
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,064
Ever since Anna's name has
been involved in this accident...

422
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,402
...he has been
pouring money to clear it.

423
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:44,734
What's the point now?

424
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:46,401
Anna did what he had to.

425
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:49,509
What? What did you say?

426
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,449
Anna had taken two
bullets on his chest!

427
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:56,585
Nandu, this girl is like
Chaddi's sister. He's bound to be hurt.

428
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:00,157
So? Didn't Anna mean anything to us?

429
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:05,761
Nandu, l am not as smart as you are.

430
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:10,792
But l know one thing...pinky's life
is screwed for no fault of hers.

431
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,360
Someone has to be
responsible for this.

432
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,363
You say, don't blame Anna.

433
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:19,107
But tell me, Nandu,
who should l blame if not Anna?

434
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,347
Who should l blame for making
that innocent girl blind?

435
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,210
She wanted to become a dancer,
you know.

436
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:35,192
She used to say, Dancing is
my passport to get out of here.

437
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:39,660
Who should l blame for
shattering her dream?

438
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,725
Tell me, Nandu.

439
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:48,133
Nandu, Nandu!

440
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:55,436
Sir! Sir! May your kids prosper...
may you get success in life...

441
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,146
Sir, please give me
10 bucks, wont you?

442
00:33:58,817 --> 00:33:59,875
Will you have a wadapaav?

443
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:02,413
No, sir. l fast on Thursdays.

444
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:04,880
But today's a Friday.

445
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:07,818
Actually, sir...
l was unwell yesterday.

446
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:09,154
So l am fasting today.

447
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,558
l never miss it.
That's why l am so close to God.

448
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,690
How many of Yadav's
men followed the car?

449
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,228
Two, sir.

450
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,230
Was Anna driving?

451
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:26,633
No, sir. There was a boy in his
early twenties. He was driving.

452
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:28,303
He gave me 20 bucks.

453
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:30,906
How did he look?

454
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,614
Just like Hrithik Roshan. Fair.

455
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:36,913
lt was dark. l couldn't see clearly.
Besides it was raining.

456
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,586
Sir, please give me...

457
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:48,490
Thank you, sir.

458
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:51,399
Sir, will you drop
me at the next signal?

459
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,662
Should l get in, sir?

460
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,568
Hey!

461
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,212
May your kids grow up
and suck your blood!

462
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:25,462
Qasim, isn't he taking
more than usual today?

463
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:28,433
l don't know, Bhai.
He looks distracted.

464
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:35,502
She'll be blind for the
rest of her miserable life.

465
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,418
This will barely suffice
for a fortnight's medicines.

466
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,328
What's wrong with you?

467
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,659
Who should l blame for
making that innocent girl blind?!

468
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,454
She wanted to become
a dancer, you know.

469
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:30,991
She used to say, Dancing is
my passport to get out of here.

470
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,900
Who should l blame for
shattering her dream?

471
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:36,906
Someone has to be
responsible for this.

472
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,339
Tell me, Nandu.

473
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,502
You gave me quite a
scare today, my boy.

474
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:07,734
Bhai, l want more than regular today.

475
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:12,067
Kudroos Miyaa,
bandage his head properly.

476
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,004
Looks like his brain is damaged.

477
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,341
But, Bhai...
- Ha!

478
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,081
Have l ever said no to you?

479
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:30,652
No, right?

480
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,022
C'mon.

481
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:37,759
What is it?

482
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,834
Take this. put it in
pinky's bank account.

483
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,097
But, Nandu...

484
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:45,108
Listen, does her loser
of a brother do anything?

485
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,368
Of course he does. He acts smart.

486
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,072
Ever since pinky lost her job,
he behaves as if he rules the house.

487
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:55,443
And skating?

488
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,481
She can't even walk on her own.
How the hell will she skate!

489
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,392
She was discharged from
the hospital 15 days ago.

490
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:08,398
Job's gone. She just sits in a
corner thinking about something.

491
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,432
From Cinderella to Thumbelina
in just one unlucky stroke.

492
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:20,405
Ganya, give me my bag.

493
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:24,472
Mom, l am leaving.

494
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,414
Where are you going?

495
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:30,579
For practise, mom.

496
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,150
Look at her, mom.
She's not done with her dancing yet.

497
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,422
l'll take Ganya along.

498
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,988
Let's go, Ganya.

499
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:49,869
Can't even stand properly
and madam here wants to dance.

500
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,505
You'll never understand.

501
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:56,907
Oh! Take that black one man.

502
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,782
Chaddi, you won't change!
How much more carom will you play?

503
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,859
C'mon, let's begin.

504
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,132
What are you staring at?
Give your hand. C'mon.

505
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:35,611
Sorry, sorry! Let's try again.

506
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:50,625
pinky!

507
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:55,836
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

508
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:12,513
Go home and put some balm.
You'll feel better.

509
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:16,590
ls she a better dancer than me?

510
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,054
Who?

511
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,724
Little Miss Sunshine.

512
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:26,662
Your new dance partner. Shalaka Mogre.

513
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:29,264
That...

514
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,941
No, you are right.

515
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:37,540
lf you dance with a blind girl
you'll have to beg for money.

516
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,014
TV show is out of question.

517
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:41,745
lt's not what you think.

518
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:45,814
l didn't have any other option.

519
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:47,816
Otherwise a terrific
dancer like you...

520
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,555
Enough of your sweet talk.

521
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:58,567
Let this TV show get done.
Then we'll do something together.

522
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,232
Sit at home and do it with yourself.

523
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:07,035
Go now.

524
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:35,297
Team Tolly

525
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,946
Eyes with wings

526
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,956
Two crazy eyes

527
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,285
Eyes with wings

528
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,625
They lay awake, days and nights

529
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,698
Eyes with wings

530
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,701
Two crazy eyes

531
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,104
Eyes with wings

532
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,300
They lay awake, days and nights

533
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:18,639
They'll flap their wings and fly away

534
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:24,319
ln the sky up there and lose their way

535
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:31,326
Full of pride, these wandering eyes

536
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:33,721
Eyes with wings

537
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:38,268
Two crazy eyes

538
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:10,298
Eyes with wings in the
land of clouds and winds

539
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:16,037
pluck the shining
stars of precious dreams

540
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:22,774
Oh look at them, the moon they steal!

541
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,709
lt's me, Rahim Chacha.

542
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:28,377
And with their lids,
they make it a veil

543
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:35,050
They'll fly back home
in the blink of an eye

544
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:41,260
With their precious dreams
and with their spirits high

545
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:42,390
Mom!

546
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:48,268
Full of grace, these famous eyes

547
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,730
Eyes with wings

548
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:55,268
Two crazy eyes

549
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,742
C'mon guys. Crack it this time.
No more mistakes.

550
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,344
Take him to the left. Hold him.

551
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:06,947
Hey you midget! Get down!

552
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:08,889
Why are you guys obsessed
with my collar!

553
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,823
Get down, you pest.

554
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,760
C'mon guys. Take him to the left.

555
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,027
Chaddi!
- Yeah?

556
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,764
You guys aren't getting it right.
We'll try it later.

557
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:21,964
l have a job for you.

558
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,170
What?
- l...

559
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:26,766
C'mon guys, bring it on!

560
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:41,849
Give me another chilly.

561
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,793
You are crazy. Here...

562
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:50,795
So, what have you thought?

563
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:52,193
About what?

564
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:53,463
About what l said.

565
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:55,803
What exactly is he going to do?

566
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:59,400
That l don't know. But Nandu
is not the kind to waste time.

567
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:01,069
l am not interested.

568
00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:02,806
Meet him, at least.
He's coming tomorrow morning.

569
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,812
l don't want any favours from anyone.

570
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,076
What's the harm in trying?

571
00:45:06,817 --> 00:45:08,284
Why does he need to do all this?

572
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:10,820
Sweetheart, there are
people who help others.

573
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,412
He says, he'll teach me to see.

574
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:15,485
l am sure he just wants to lay
his hands on me. Teach me to see!

575
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,823
Oh hello! Who do you think you are?
Aishwarya Rai?

576
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:19,827
You think he's dying
to lay his hands on you?

577
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,829
Exactly! By the way...

578
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:24,163
...the best chicks from paul's
classes have the hots for him, okay.

579
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,861
Here we are.

580
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:58,128
Where have you got me?

581
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,999
lf you try to act fresh,
l'll bite you so bad, you'll die.

582
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:10,207
You know why l think
you'll learn to see?

583
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:14,349
Because you love to
fight...with yourself...

584
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:17,285
...with people
around...with life. Be careful.

585
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,508
Bloody swine!

586
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:55,919
Lesson No. 2. Listen and
react at the same time.

587
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:58,925
Don't listen first and react later.

588
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:02,929
Get up, l'll explain lesson No.1

589
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,399
These 30 seconds under water.

590
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:13,938
Don't ever forget these 30 seconds.

591
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:18,938
lf you want to see as desperately as
you wanted to breathe...

592
00:47:19,016 --> 00:47:20,950
...nobody can stop you from seeing.

593
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:28,287
pinky, you don't need eyes to see.
You need to be possessed.

594
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,289
lf you are possessed enough...

595
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:34,628
...then you'll be a ten
times better dancer than before.

596
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:38,159
Got it?

597
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:50,571
Sorry.

598
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:00,320
l am sorry too pinky.

599
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:05,587
l was a bit too rough.

600
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,659
Let's go.

601
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:16,198
Chaddi, your grandma's here!

602
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:20,402
What are these guys doing here?

603
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,070
What did you think?

604
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:28,007
l fight blind-folded without
training? This is where l train.

605
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,350
Guys, get ready.
l'll explain things to her till then.

606
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:34,615
Give your bag.

607
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:39,356
Hey, Dance Bar. Will you do
a little jig for me later?

608
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:41,096
Buzz off, you jerk!

609
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,495
You didn't forget Lesson No. 2.

610
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,100
Yes. Listen and react at the same time.
Not one after the other.

611
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:53,709
Good. What we'll be doing
today is pretty much the same.

612
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:58,311
Chaddi will give you small pieces of
dough. Diesel will ring the bells.

613
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:01,446
Listen to the sound of bells and hit.

614
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:03,110
l'll do it.

615
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,056
How do l know you are not looking?

616
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:23,597
Chaddi...

617
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:31,545
Take that.
Now listen carefully and hit. Okay?

618
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:33,607
Diesel...

619
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,555
Listen. Listen.

620
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:58,301
Did l hit?
- No, no...

621
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,506
You hit it! You hit it.

622
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:27,194
Did l hit?

623
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:28,670
At the right spot.

624
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,138
Cut it out...

625
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:33,608
Be careful, otherwise
you'll break your face.

626
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:35,139
What are you guys going to do?

627
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:37,607
Here, smell this.

628
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,144
Eww! What is it!

629
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:43,152
pomfret, tuna, salmon,
prawns. Absolutely fresh.

630
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:46,485
Did you smell it?
This will come towards you.

631
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:49,216
You have to smell it and dodge it.
Okay?

632
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:53,554
Let it come.

633
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:57,757
Wait. Wait. C'mon.

634
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,909
Smell it. Smell it.

635
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,705
Now listen to its
clucking and grab it.

636
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:24,386
Team Tolly

637
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:34,193
Listen to see, you'll see everything

638
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,205
Grab life and hold on to it

639
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:44,476
Listen to see, touch to see

640
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:46,209
See what you haven't heard

641
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:47,875
lf you see with your ears

642
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,543
You'll see all the colours

643
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,480
Feelings can see clearly

644
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:53,345
Awaken those feelings in you

645
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,348
You are your own support

646
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:00,287
Banish all fear from your mind

647
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,554
Your mind will be your eyes

648
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:10,288
lf you have the fire to live

649
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:13,961
Open your mind and let it see

650
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:24,640
You saw with your ears. You saw with
your nose. Now touch and see.

651
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,999
Listen to the noise carefully

652
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:51,938
Every sound is a story

653
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:56,943
Listen to the sound of danger

654
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:59,005
Before the thundering storm arrives

655
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:04,887
The shadows will touch and tell you

656
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,686
Who is close to you and who is not

657
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:10,551
This darkness is your friend now

658
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:12,424
Hold the hand of the night

659
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,377
There goes the breeze

660
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:31,573
Go tickle it a little bit

661
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:32,842
Be careful

662
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,714
The sun has scattered
the rainbow so neatly

663
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:39,446
The warm quilt of the cool shade

664
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,989
Don't let it go

665
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:43,988
There goes the breeze

666
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:46,393
Go tickle it a little bit

667
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:50,724
Be careful

668
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:53,395
The sun has scattered
the rainbow so neatly

669
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:59,534
Life is calling out to you

670
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,411
Why are you shying away?

671
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:05,412
Catch the rhythm of your heartbeat

672
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:33,100
Good morning, sir.

673
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:34,973
Morning, Sethna. Have a seat.

674
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,572
File this.

675
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,577
What's the progress on
the Walia murder case?

676
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:44,780
lnvestigation is going on, sir.

677
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:47,454
l was a bit busy with
the pinky palkar case.

678
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:48,920
No, shut that.

679
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:51,051
But sir someone else also is...

680
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:53,062
Sethna, try to understand.

681
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:57,460
The media is hounding me
for the Walia murder case.

682
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:01,061
Sir...
- Just shut the file! That's all.

683
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:04,064
Okay, sir.

684
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:05,666
You may go.

685
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,469
And submit the Walia case
report by tomorrow morning.

686
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,139
Yes, sir.

687
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:23,490
Hello. Usman, salaam walekum.

688
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:29,554
Sir, the pinky palkar case is
supposed to be closed, right?

689
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,831
l have opened the case.
l'll be the one to close it.

690
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,563
Someone seems to be in a
hurry to close this case.

691
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:41,572
Did you get any leads
from the rickshaw stand?

692
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:44,513
Yes, sir. A rickshaw driver dropped...

693
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,641
...a boy to the Bandra
taxi stand that night.

694
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:50,580
We are looking for the taxi driver.

695
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,520
Don't involve anybody else, Kadam.

696
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:57,982
ln fact, even you can
withdraw from this case if you wish.

697
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,053
lt's up to you.

698
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:03,058
No, sir. l'll manage.

699
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:09,603
Your audition day is coming closer.

700
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,608
Who are you going to dance with?

701
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:15,940
Should l get Shahid Kapoor?

702
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:19,273
Nandu!

703
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:23,677
Come.

704
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:27,688
Hi, pinky, how are you?

705
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,219
What is he doing here?

706
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:35,628
You were saying you are
ready to skate dance, right?

707
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:36,757
Yeah, so?

708
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,562
So, we got him here.

709
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:41,569
pinky, l was thinking...
why don't we come together again...

710
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:44,698
Whoever has got you here,
ask them to drop you home.

711
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:48,174
l don't want any favours
from you or anyone else.

712
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:50,170
But, pinky...
- That's enough!

713
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:52,906
Go.

714
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,584
l am not interested in
waiting here either.

715
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:58,314
lf these guys hadn't forced me...

716
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:05,117
Anyway, goodbye. You and
your stupid waadi friends.

717
00:58:06,797 --> 00:58:08,856
What did you say!
Get lost you bloody...

718
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:17,605
What the hell do you want to do?
Don't you want to dance?

719
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,266
Dance comes from the heart.
You can't beg for it.

720
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,002
Beg, my foot!

721
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:24,945
What do you think?
We are all doing you a favour?

722
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:26,681
l am doing you a favaour?

723
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:29,347
Gulkand, Diesel, Chaddi,
they are all doing you a favour?!

724
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:31,678
Friends don't do favours.

725
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:36,689
What the hell do you want? Tell me once
and for all. l am losing it!

726
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:38,693
You'll skate with me.

727
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:40,687
What!

728
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,823
You...will skate with me.

729
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:48,830
Me? You want me to play
wheelie with you! She's lost it.

730
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:51,231
Not just skate.
You will also dance with me.

731
00:58:57,113 --> 00:58:58,307
l am a disco dancer.

732
00:58:58,381 --> 00:58:59,712
Nandu...and dance!

733
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:04,253
Enough.

734
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:10,725
You think l am mad?
Have l lost it to dance with you!

735
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:15,730
people who lose it, make it big.

736
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:18,728
And the so-called smarter
ones play carom in the waadi.

737
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:22,727
Their smartness is good enough only
to woo girls or suck up to someone.

738
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:26,870
Diesel sucks up to you,
you suck up to that Usman.

739
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:30,936
Don't ever do the madness
of doing something else.

740
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:35,811
By the way, you were the one preaching
about being possessed, right?

741
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:39,752
That to make it big you have
to be possessed enough.

742
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,822
l am possessed about being mad.

743
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:50,831
The question
is...what do you want to be?

744
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:53,293
Smart...

745
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:55,699
...or mad.

746
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:10,776
A game with danger is their whim

747
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:17,054
They play fair;
they play dirty, these wild birds

748
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:27,795
What stands between
pain and glory is...

749
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:32,934
...a word called guts.

750
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:41,277
lf a man has guts
he can find glory in pain.

751
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,481
But these guts can
be bloody dreadful...

752
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:53,828
...when people start
taking you for a ride.

753
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,833
And you let them.

754
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:13,141
Where's the fighter from?
l'll handle it.

755
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:18,851
Hey, Nandu! l'll send you
some pav Bhaji with Chintu.

756
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:19,980
Make sure you have it.

757
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:21,852
Nandu?

758
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:25,152
Yeah?

759
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:26,855
What's with the silent treatment?

760
01:01:28,164 --> 01:01:30,462
lt's okay if you don't want to skate.

761
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:32,526
But at least speak to me.

762
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,134
Sometimes l feel like strangling her.

763
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:37,464
Yeah, okay.

764
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:52,553
Nandu! There's a parcel for you.

765
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:54,146
What is it?
- See it for yourself.

766
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:00,954
What are you doing here?

767
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:04,889
Right now l am standing here.
But l plan to come up.

768
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:06,901
And how will you do that?

769
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,028
l guess l'll just
use my legs, you fool!

770
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:14,901
Now give me a hand.

771
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:25,979
That was quick!

772
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:31,652
Take this. l am leaving.
Drop that aunty home later.

773
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:34,328
Go call your mom aunty! Buzz off!

774
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:36,928
There's just no value
for respect these days.

775
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:38,657
Food...for you.

776
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:41,928
What's with the food business?

777
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:43,666
No reason. Just to cheer you up.

778
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,998
lt's useless.

779
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:49,378
Nandu, don't skate if you don't
want to. Why take it out on food?

780
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:52,539
Here...

781
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,009
Okay, l am leaving.

782
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:57,210
Yeah, okay.

783
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:58,949
l am really leaving...

784
01:02:59,022 --> 01:03:01,081
Jump from the right.
There's grass there.

785
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:02,682
You jerk!

786
01:03:04,194 --> 01:03:07,960
l burnt my hand to make chapattis for
you and you want to act smart, huh?

787
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,365
Shut up and eat now.

788
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,972
Do you see the moon?

789
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:24,037
Yeah.

790
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:25,171
ls it a half or a full moon?

791
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:27,040
lt's a half-full moon.

792
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:28,575
Half-full?

793
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:32,150
Half-full...a little more
than half but not full yet.

794
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:34,447
And clouds?

795
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:36,991
Clouds in the night?

796
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:39,619
There must be some
around the half-full moon.

797
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:47,060
Yeah.

798
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,995
Who can you see in them?
- What?!

799
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:53,072
Haven't you ever seen
faces in the clouds?

800
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,502
You know, if you keep staring at the
clouds for a long time, you see faces.

801
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:05,545
A crooked-nosed magician,
a kid sitting below an umbrella...

802
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:08,615
...a long trunked
Ganpati (lndian God)...

803
01:04:21,638 --> 01:04:23,037
Who can you see now?

804
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:34,649
A dhoti clad fatso with a moustache...

805
01:04:38,054 --> 01:04:40,045
Looks like he's going to
eat the half-full moon.

806
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:46,055
Didn't l tell you, you see faces...

807
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:50,256
pinky...

808
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:55,367
...why do you want to skate with me?

809
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,505
Because l trust you.

810
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:05,680
You'll skate with me for
friendship...not out of pity.

811
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:13,078
Did the fatso eat the half-full moon?

812
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:24,424
Fernandez uncle!

813
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:32,106
My shoe size is 9.

814
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:36,410
Arrange for wheels my size.

815
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:39,180
Let's start skate
practice from tomorrow.

816
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,307
What?

817
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:44,186
l can't eat burnt chapattis every day.

818
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:54,855
Are you ready? Get up.

819
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:57,791
C'mon.

820
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:03,262
Nandu, you okay?

821
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:06,570
Easy, easy.

822
01:06:07,477 --> 01:06:08,535
Give me a hand.

823
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:11,671
Careful.

824
01:06:13,683 --> 01:06:15,150
This is a piece of cake.

825
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:16,476
piece of cake...

826
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:18,445
Leave my hand.

827
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:23,819
Why do l need training for this?

828
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,288
Nandu!

829
01:06:29,165 --> 01:06:30,223
Diesel, give me a hand.

830
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:33,200
Diesel, let go. Let go.

831
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:40,165
Lesson No. 1.
Learn to land before you fly.

832
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:42,235
C'mon.

833
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:48,310
lt's done. Get up, give me your hand.

834
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,387
Jump.
- Hmm?

835
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:53,747
Jump. Jump.

836
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,548
Use the break.

837
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:59,194
One. Two. Three.

838
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:03,792
Use the break, Nandu!

839
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:05,527
l will.
- Let's try again.

840
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:08,602
One. Two. Three.

841
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,798
Leave my hand.

842
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:15,870
One. Two. Three.

843
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:19,506
Try again.

844
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:21,750
l'll teach you a new step today.

845
01:07:22,385 --> 01:07:28,847
Watch carefully. First go like this,
then like this, then like this...

846
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:30,583
Now show me.

847
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,298
Guys, hold me, it's ripping off...

848
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,936
My pants are ripping off!

849
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,330
There go his pants.

850
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:48,835
Lesson No. 2. Stretch only as
much as your pants can take.

851
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:49,969
What did l teach you?

852
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:53,447
First like this, then like this...

853
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:57,475
Like this, then like this...Correct.

854
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:01,917
Shut down your game. Go home.

855
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:03,253
Yes, sir. Last board.

856
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:04,551
Sir, that fighter.

857
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:09,857
So fighter, you quit the ring
and joined a circus, is it?

858
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,262
Go home.

859
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:13,427
Get lost.

860
01:08:21,444 --> 01:08:22,536
Sir, we found the taxi driver.

861
01:08:22,879 --> 01:08:25,677
l am sure you haven't
disturbed me to tell me just that.

862
01:08:25,748 --> 01:08:30,276
Yes, sir. He dropped
that boy in Mahim.

863
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,682
ln front of Usman Ali's house.

864
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:35,551
Usman Ali? That gambling king?
- Yes, sir.

865
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:38,351
Good one, Kadam.

866
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:39,894
This boy will lead us to Usman.

867
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:41,354
You are right, sir.

868
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:34,081
At least clap if you liked it.

869
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:36,946
C'mon, wear your skates.

870
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:39,685
Okay, let's go.

871
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,386
Hold properly.
You are a holding a dead rat or what?!

872
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,418
Give your hand.

873
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:49,354
Now tell me the way.

874
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,663
Right. Left, left.

875
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:53,793
Sorry.

876
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:56,836
Where are you, huh?

877
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,598
Right here. Why?

878
01:09:59,709 --> 01:10:01,643
l can hear a train chugging in there.

879
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,379
Oh that! That's because of
the fight tonight.

880
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:08,975
Oh really? Have you ever thought
about a fight before?

881
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:15,916
Nandu, who are you thinking of?

882
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,688
My heart is such a brat

883
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:25,060
lt follows only its mind

884
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:29,399
lt pays no heed to me

885
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:33,767
Though it claims to be mine

886
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:38,405
ln the mist of your
thoughts it's always lost

887
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:43,851
No matter what l say,
it just slips and falls

888
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:47,947
Love comes at a price

889
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:52,654
But it pays it anyway

890
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:58,428
My heart is such a brat

891
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:03,737
lt follows only its mind

892
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:15,909
Team Tolly

893
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:51,943
Wonder why it pines for melancholy

894
01:11:54,090 --> 01:12:00,086
Wishing for a new ailment

895
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:09,961
Sleepless eyes lay
awake in restless nights

896
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:16,539
Every moment feels
like a burden so heavy

897
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:22,746
Floating like a butterfly

898
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:27,512
lt follows only your footsteps

899
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:31,253
lts blood boiling like hot passion

900
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:35,663
This brat rejoices
for no rhyme or reason

901
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:39,531
ln the mist of your
thoughts it's always lost

902
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:45,063
No matter what l say,
it just slips and falls

903
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:49,068
Love comes at a price

904
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:53,842
But it pays it anyway

905
01:12:56,886 --> 01:12:59,548
My heart is such a brat

906
01:13:01,023 --> 01:13:04,891
lt follows only its mind

907
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:44,896
Wonder what it's
looking for at the horizon

908
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:53,067
Wandering like a bird
in the land of clouds

909
01:13:55,311 --> 01:14:02,979
Basking in your sweet smell alone

910
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:09,625
Simmering like the flame of love

911
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:15,688
lt melts only with your sweet voice

912
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:19,965
lt dissolves like sugar does in tea

913
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:24,237
Where would you find a
heart as crazy as this

914
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,633
But all is fair in love,
oh yes, it is

915
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:32,169
ln the mist of your
thoughts it's always lost

916
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:37,845
No matter what l say,
it just slips and falls

917
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:41,884
Love comes at a price

918
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:46,752
But it pays it anyway

919
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,259
My heart is such a brat

920
01:14:53,836 --> 01:14:57,738
lt follows only its mind

921
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:17,054
Hello? Yeah, Qasim Bhai?

922
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:20,753
Did you get through?

923
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:22,355
Yes. He's coming in 10 minutes.

924
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:23,693
Where the hell was he?

925
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,834
He's busy practising skating
with that girl these days.

926
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:28,761
practicing what?

927
01:15:28,837 --> 01:15:30,702
That thing, Bhai, where you put
wheels on your feet and you glide.

928
01:15:30,773 --> 01:15:32,138
Yeah, yeah, l know, l know.

929
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:33,266
That twit has grown wings.

930
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:41,212
Qasim, who's he?

931
01:15:42,117 --> 01:15:44,711
Max...a boxer from Vasai.

932
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,320
l had warned Nandu about him.

933
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:07,101
Monday! Monday!

934
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:10,405
Audition dates. Next Monday, it is.

935
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,743
What are you saying!
ls everything ready?

936
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:14,146
Nandu's right skate is a bit loose.

937
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,274
You are right. lt is loose.

938
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:19,412
We'll get it fixed from Shakeel.

939
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:20,819
But makeup? Who'll do that?

940
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:23,758
Sweetheart! You take care of that.

941
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,855
Buzz off!
- And what about costumes?

942
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:28,419
Yeah, you'll need swanky
costumes for the audition.

943
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:32,092
You guys don't worry about that.
Just get the fabric.

944
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:35,202
That Usha store around the
corner...one of my babes works there.

945
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:36,429
'One of your babes', is it?

946
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:37,767
No, no, no.

947
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,898
No, no, she's my sister, l swear!

948
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:43,038
He won't change!

949
01:18:05,594 --> 01:18:06,856
Hi, Nandu.

950
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:09,454
Here, pinky, prashad
(religious offering)

951
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:10,862
Sai Baba, please save us

952
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:13,926
Don't worry, you guys are
going to be rocking today.

953
01:18:14,937 --> 01:18:17,201
Nandu, now
everything is in your hands.

954
01:18:17,272 --> 01:18:18,330
Not in his hands. ln his feet.

955
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:22,066
Shut up. l'll go see
what's happening downstairs.

956
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:25,403
Listen, Nandu, audience votes
is the most important thing.

957
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,005
Whoever has the most
votes will soar...

958
01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:28,873
There are three types of audiences...

959
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:31,550
One, is the
housewife...how to impress her?

960
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,489
For her, your expression should be just
like the characters in a daily soap.

961
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:39,423
Second, is the dude
who goes to the gym.

962
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:41,362
For him, you should
flaunt your muscles.

963
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:44,430
Third, is the young college girl.
She's already in your pocket.

964
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,365
Don't overact,
otherwise she'll slip away.

965
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,128
Shut up!

966
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:06,452
Ajay and his babe are
here to play wheelie. - So?

967
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:09,914
The channel guy said that only one
couple amongst you can be selected.

968
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,183
But why? - Because both of
you have the same talent.

969
01:19:12,327 --> 01:19:13,521
C'mon now.

970
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:16,120
Nandu, be careful.
This is not Dandiya.

971
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,932
And smile when you enter.

972
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:20,092
lgnore him.

973
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,535
Nandu, all the best.

974
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:25,397
Same to you.

975
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:42,116
Damn, Nandu!

976
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:49,555
l had told you, he is good
for nothing but Dandiya!

977
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,159
Shut up!

978
01:20:09,117 --> 01:20:10,209
How did you trip man?

979
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:12,044
He didn't trip on purpose.

980
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,486
l am not saying that.
- Then why did you ask?

981
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:16,990
One thing at practice,
something else at the show.

982
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:18,219
lt happens.

983
01:20:18,293 --> 01:20:19,521
lt doesn't work that way, man...

984
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:20,653
Hello?

985
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:23,326
Nandan Kamtekar. Yes?

986
01:20:27,603 --> 01:20:28,661
Yeah.

987
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:33,065
Okay.

988
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:39,471
We are selected.

989
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:41,307
What?!

990
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:45,218
lt was the channel guy.

991
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:47,615
We are selected.

992
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,302
Madam, Diwali offer!

993
01:21:10,379 --> 01:21:11,437
Buy one, get one free.

994
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:16,707
Who's the king of Mumbai?!
Babloo Mane!

995
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:18,719
Come here...come here you twit!

996
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,316
l am going to get you today.

997
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,450
Careful. Careful.

998
01:21:25,661 --> 01:21:30,121
Chaddi! You didn't get any
other car to come under?

999
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:31,631
No, Bhai, we were just fooling around.

1000
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:35,134
lt's difficult to meet you
even on Diwali?

1001
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:37,503
No, Bhai, l was a little busy.

1002
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:41,140
Busy? So busy that you don't
even have time to give me a hug?

1003
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:45,108
Happy Diwali!

1004
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,277
She's the same girl, right?

1005
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:54,480
Yes, Bhai.

1006
01:21:54,556 --> 01:21:55,750
pinky, this is Usman Bhai.

1007
01:21:56,658 --> 01:21:57,818
Salaam walekum.

1008
01:21:57,893 --> 01:22:01,090
Sit, sit. Hope everything's fine.
- Yes.

1009
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:04,098
lf you need anything,
just let me know.

1010
01:22:07,703 --> 01:22:10,365
Looks like you guys
have become friends, huh?

1011
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,298
Yes, Bhai...

1012
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:15,302
Good.

1013
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:18,107
C'mon, Diesel.
Let me catch up with the waadi people.

1014
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:23,180
And, Nandu. Enough of being busy now.

1015
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:25,852
Come early this Friday.

1016
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:27,513
Okay?

1017
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:30,182
C'mon, Diesel.

1018
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:45,702
Looks like you guys have
become friends (mockingly)

1019
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:46,866
Sshhh! He'll hear you.

1020
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:49,803
Why? You are scared
you'll lose your job?

1021
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:52,646
l fight of my own will.

1022
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:56,616
Oh really? Then don't go this Friday.
We'll practise till late.

1023
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:04,152
Nandu, for how long will you live
like this...from Friday to Friday?

1024
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:06,353
Have you ever thought of the future?

1025
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:08,554
What's there to think?

1026
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:10,888
Don't you plan to do
a job or something?

1027
01:23:12,434 --> 01:23:13,628
l don't need your lecture now!

1028
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,169
l am telling you as a friend.

1029
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:17,199
lf you think it's lecturing,
then so be it.

1030
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:21,175
This 'One Shot Nandu' is
only good to look at...

1031
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:23,177
...not to live with.

1032
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:26,179
Tomorrow if you feel like
settling down with some girl...

1033
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,182
...no girl will want
to be with a boy...

1034
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,242
...who breaks someone's face
for a living.

1035
01:23:33,522 --> 01:23:36,923
So what kind of a boy
will a girl like to be with?

1036
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:39,492
Girls are very smart nowadays.

1037
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,260
Gone are the days of
falling for cute faces.

1038
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:47,728
These days only if you have a house,
a good job, is there any chance...

1039
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:50,937
Otherwise, go fly a kite!

1040
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:53,332
Got it?

1041
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:57,278
C'mon. Let's burst some crackers.

1042
01:24:02,718 --> 01:24:03,776
C'mon!

1043
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:07,377
Give me a biscuit
- Chacha...

1044
01:24:07,889 --> 01:24:08,947
please have it.

1045
01:24:09,558 --> 01:24:10,616
There he is.

1046
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:13,291
Done?
- Yeah.

1047
01:24:14,296 --> 01:24:15,695
Rahim Chacha, one special.

1048
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:18,493
Say something! Did they hire you?

1049
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:20,728
Yeah. 15000 bucks a month.

1050
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:23,495
That means you'll take up a job?

1051
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:24,963
That too of a bouncer?

1052
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:28,605
l have a job with Usman too, don't l?

1053
01:24:28,677 --> 01:24:29,974
But you command respect there.

1054
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:31,637
They call you 'One Shot'.

1055
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:32,771
people look up to you.

1056
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,611
You saw what
happened with Anna, right?

1057
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:37,285
Does anybody respect him now?

1058
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:39,747
That's because he hit pinky.

1059
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:47,518
lf l stay in this line,
even l'll hit a pinky some day.

1060
01:24:57,272 --> 01:24:59,001
l have fed this devil enough.

1061
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:02,276
Kudroos Miyaa,
he won't have any more now.

1062
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:08,680
There he escapes.
He won't come back now .

1063
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:20,360
Qasim, that boxer from
Vasai...call him tomorrow.

1064
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:23,888
Looks like l'll have to
create another 'One Shot'

1065
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:26,834
But, Bhai, he's lost to Nandu twice.

1066
01:25:26,902 --> 01:25:27,960
That's good.

1067
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,631
Anger makes a man do many things.

1068
01:25:31,706 --> 01:25:36,040
And this thing...'love'...
just ruins everything.

1069
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:41,039
That was close! - A little more
practice and you'll crack it.

1070
01:25:41,383 --> 01:25:42,441
Don't worry too much.

1071
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:44,050
Drop me to the disco...

1072
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:46,053
Excuse me! Where are you off to?

1073
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:47,446
Don't you know?

1074
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:49,988
Our Nandu has a job now.
- What!

1075
01:25:50,725 --> 01:25:52,784
Senior bouncer...15000 bucks a month.

1076
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:53,919
You go ahead, l'll come.

1077
01:25:55,397 --> 01:25:56,523
He's blushing!

1078
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:21,415
How much more time
is it going to take?

1079
01:26:23,491 --> 01:26:26,358
Baby (mockingly)...here,
have a banana.

1080
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:31,590
Why are you worrying so much?

1081
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:33,093
We are definitely in the final five.

1082
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:35,897
Nobody will dare chuck us out.

1083
01:26:43,778 --> 01:26:46,440
Nandu...tell me something...

1084
01:26:47,716 --> 01:26:49,741
How come you took on this job?

1085
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,443
ls it about some girl?

1086
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:57,449
Why should it be about some girl?

1087
01:26:59,394 --> 01:27:00,452
l felt like it, l tried.

1088
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:02,454
Hmmm...

1089
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:04,932
What else did you feel like?

1090
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:06,525
Don't bug me!

1091
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:07,795
You have the hots forTina, right?

1092
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:08,927
Have you lost it?!

1093
01:27:09,004 --> 01:27:10,972
No, she's not your type.

1094
01:27:13,074 --> 01:27:16,737
Oh yes! Ekta, from paul classes?

1095
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:18,537
Right?

1096
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,147
Guys! Come quickly.

1097
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:28,479
l know who she is...

1098
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:39,559
He thinks too much of himself.

1099
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,432
Wants to become Usman's right hand...

1100
01:27:44,506 --> 01:27:46,667
...and take Anna's place.

1101
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:49,476
What does he call himself?

1102
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:51,703
Fighter!

1103
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:53,842
This is what a fighter is!

1104
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,186
Kadam Sir, your glass is empty.

1105
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:03,622
You guys carry on.
l'll go take a leak.

1106
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,786
Now, that is very important.

1107
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:06,952
Fill his glass.

1108
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:18,063
Nandu.

1109
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:20,803
His name is Nandan Kamtekar.

1110
01:28:27,615 --> 01:28:28,877
Nandu! Nandu!

1111
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:31,552
You bonehead!
Why don't you answer your phone?

1112
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:34,550
Has your father ever answered
his phone while bathing!

1113
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:36,680
Don't drag my father in this.

1114
01:28:36,758 --> 01:28:38,817
Come and pick me up at 12.

1115
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,554
We are going to watch a movie.

1116
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:43,221
Are you drunk or what!

1117
01:28:43,565 --> 01:28:44,725
You fool!

1118
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:46,892
pinky asked me to say all this.

1119
01:29:00,849 --> 01:29:01,907
Here, take the pepsi.

1120
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:03,975
l'll hold the popcorn.

1121
01:29:06,855 --> 01:29:09,050
What's with this movie
plan all of a sudden?

1122
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:10,182
Just like that.

1123
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:14,124
We could have asked the rest of
the gang to join us. Such a sudden...

1124
01:29:14,195 --> 01:29:17,187
Why? You are afraid l'll
feel you up in the dark?

1125
01:29:26,207 --> 01:29:27,674
Hero and heroine are in a car...

1126
01:29:30,145 --> 01:29:31,203
lt's raining outside...

1127
01:29:32,714 --> 01:29:33,942
A song is playing on the radio...

1128
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:35,141
l am not deaf!

1129
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:40,213
The hero is coming
closer to the heroine...

1130
01:29:42,624 --> 01:29:44,888
The heroine is coming
closer to the hero...

1131
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:48,619
Hero is about to...

1132
01:29:50,231 --> 01:29:52,131
You didn't get any other film?
- Why?

1133
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:56,229
l mean...it's not decent.

1134
01:29:57,972 --> 01:30:00,202
Nandu! What are you doing man!

1135
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:02,634
What do you mean?

1136
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:04,143
l am watching the movie
and telling you about it.

1137
01:30:04,846 --> 01:30:06,575
You think l have got you
here to watch the movie!

1138
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:11,710
No?

1139
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,651
l am visually challenged.
He is mentally challenged.

1140
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:23,323
The hero has now left with the car.

1141
01:30:44,886 --> 01:30:48,287
Left to you, you won't utter a
word for the rest of your life!

1142
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:51,685
About what...
- Will you shut up for some time?

1143
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:04,029
l...l love you.

1144
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:20,847
Hey, One Shot Nandu.
There's no compulsion, don't worry.

1145
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:24,248
Otherwise you'll think that
the blind girl is piling on.

1146
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:41,171
pinky...l am not used to goodness.

1147
01:31:44,012 --> 01:31:45,843
Don't get me used to it.

1148
01:31:46,281 --> 01:31:48,681
You already are, One Shot Nandu.

1149
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:51,417
Now shut up and hold my hand.

1150
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:56,281
Hold it!

1151
01:31:58,459 --> 01:32:08,460
Team Tolly

1152
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:32,792
We'll paint the town
with the colour of our style

1153
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:43,797
We'll punch a hole in the sky

1154
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:47,363
Set the ocean on fire

1155
01:32:48,243 --> 01:32:56,116
On the shoulder of
death make a tattoo of life

1156
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:19,197
We are wild birds

1157
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:33,113
l knew it right since pinky was a
little girl that she'll make us proud.

1158
01:33:34,055 --> 01:33:36,523
l prayed at Mahalakshmi (lndian Goddess)
so she got through the first round.

1159
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:39,253
For the third round, l'll go to
Siddhivinayak (lndian God)

1160
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:55,874
We'll colour the moon red

1161
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:59,542
And the sky green

1162
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:04,545
The colour that we point at

1163
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:07,348
ls the right colour

1164
01:34:08,356 --> 01:34:11,325
We'll pluck all the stars

1165
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,823
And lay them on the ground

1166
01:34:15,897 --> 01:34:24,362
We'll crown the
horizon with our shadow

1167
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:28,569
We'll switch the sun
off with just a blow

1168
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,377
Wow! What coordination!

1169
01:34:32,447 --> 01:34:34,347
Nandu's lift was also superb!

1170
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:36,850
pinky's an absolute bombshell on TV!

1171
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:37,976
May God protect her from the evil eye.

1172
01:35:20,228 --> 01:35:21,354
This is it.

1173
01:35:21,963 --> 01:35:24,898
l have the names of the 5 teams
that have made it to...

1174
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:27,093
...the finals of lndia's Got Talent.

1175
01:35:28,236 --> 01:35:29,635
Without any more delays...

1176
01:35:29,704 --> 01:35:30,898
Ladies and gentlemen...

1177
01:35:30,972 --> 01:35:36,638
Our first finalist is...Aarti Kapoor
and Arpita Mitra from Kolkata.

1178
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:43,412

1179
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,414
Our third finalist...from Mumbai...

1180
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:28,126
Nandu, you have to win
the finals, come what may.

1181
01:36:28,196 --> 01:36:29,254
Yes, Chacha.

1182
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:30,388
You have become a film star, man!

1183
01:36:30,631 --> 01:36:32,690
You dance, you fight!

1184
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:38,599
l think l'll quit fighting.

1185
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:41,975
What!

1186
01:36:43,311 --> 01:36:44,369
What?

1187
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,047
Usman Bhai will let you go?

1188
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:52,519
l'll speak to him
before the next fight.

1189
01:36:54,655 --> 01:36:55,713
Let's see what he says.

1190
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:01,522
Okay bye. You don't
ever take a bath but l do.

1191
01:37:02,663 --> 01:37:04,062
Add it to our account.

1192
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:05,189
Yeah.

1193
01:37:25,019 --> 01:37:26,077
Yes, Kadam?

1194
01:37:27,355 --> 01:37:28,413
Done with your jogging?

1195
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,148
Last lap.

1196
01:37:31,092 --> 01:37:32,616
So, what's the verdict?

1197
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:34,758
Fingerprints match, sir.

1198
01:37:36,631 --> 01:37:40,089
Great. So finally
we've got Usman, huh?

1199
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,476
Bhai...l want to talk to you...

1200
01:37:51,712 --> 01:37:52,770
Yeah sure. What is it?

1201
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:00,610
Qasim, the senator is going to come.

1202
01:38:01,389 --> 01:38:03,789
Make sure everything is in order.
- Yes, Bhai.

1203
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:07,127
l'll see where Chaddi and Gulkand are.

1204
01:38:16,737 --> 01:38:17,795
Now tell me.

1205
01:38:18,272 --> 01:38:20,433
What is this private talk
that you want to have?

1206
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:28,143
Where does pinky palkar live?

1207
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:29,747
There. That's the house.

1208
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:31,409
There?
- Yes, sir.

1209
01:38:34,555 --> 01:38:35,681
Bhai, l was thinking...

1210
01:38:35,756 --> 01:38:36,814
What? You don't want to fight?

1211
01:38:39,694 --> 01:38:43,824
l mean...today's fight
will be my...last fight.

1212
01:38:46,434 --> 01:38:47,492
Very good.

1213
01:38:48,302 --> 01:38:50,167
Anyway the senator is coming today.

1214
01:38:50,705 --> 01:38:52,832
We'll felicitate you.

1215
01:38:53,174 --> 01:38:56,166
One Shot Nandu retires
from the fighting ring.

1216
01:38:56,644 --> 01:38:59,841
We'll also get a few
news channels to cover it.

1217
01:39:00,715 --> 01:39:02,182
Mom, l am leaving.

1218
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:05,847
pinky?
- Who is it?

1219
01:39:06,654 --> 01:39:08,622
pinky palkar?
- Yes.

1220
01:39:09,457 --> 01:39:10,856
l am lnspector Keki Sethna.

1221
01:39:11,592 --> 01:39:12,650
Has Rakesh done something?

1222
01:39:13,194 --> 01:39:14,252
No. l want to speak with you.

1223
01:39:15,396 --> 01:39:17,364
With me?
- lt's important...

1224
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:19,626
About your accident.

1225
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,869
You want to quit? Huh?

1226
01:39:29,677 --> 01:39:30,735
Go ahead.

1227
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:33,470
But as Nandu...not as One Shot.

1228
01:39:37,218 --> 01:39:38,276
What do you mean?

1229
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:40,377
l mean One Shot has to die today.

1230
01:39:40,755 --> 01:39:42,222
You have to lose today's fight.

1231
01:39:42,823 --> 01:39:44,154
What are you saying, Bhai?

1232
01:39:44,225 --> 01:39:45,283
l know what l am saying.

1233
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,227
l have a business to run.

1234
01:39:47,495 --> 01:39:50,157
This is not some roadside
bar that anyone can stop...

1235
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:53,223
...have a few drinks and then go home
thinking he's conquered the world!

1236
01:39:53,834 --> 01:39:58,168
lf that boxer from Vasai beats you,
then people will bet on him.

1237
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:01,237
The business should go
on...and it will go on.

1238
01:40:08,516 --> 01:40:11,246
Some new facts about
your accident have surfaced.

1239
01:40:12,853 --> 01:40:17,187
This file has evidence of the person
who actually hit you that night.

1240
01:40:20,795 --> 01:40:22,592
There's no question of losing, Bhai.

1241
01:40:24,198 --> 01:40:25,256
What?

1242
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:32,272
How dare you defy Usman?

1243
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,274
l took you in from the gutters!

1244
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:40,338
You think you are a big star just
now that you do your jigs on TV?

1245
01:40:41,882 --> 01:40:43,213
lf l hadn't covered up
that girl's accident case...

1246
01:40:43,284 --> 01:40:45,218
...you would be lying in jail...

1247
01:40:45,286 --> 01:40:47,447
...warming some gangster's bed.

1248
01:40:54,795 --> 01:40:57,229
lf you hadn't covered up the
accident, everybody would know...

1249
01:40:57,298 --> 01:41:00,290
...that you hired Anna to kill Yadav.

1250
01:41:08,909 --> 01:41:11,434
So, you do have a brain.

1251
01:41:15,649 --> 01:41:19,983
Listen, that blind babe of yours...
who you are in love with...

1252
01:41:20,855 --> 01:41:23,722
l'll tell her who made her blind.

1253
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,518
This file has all the proof.

1254
01:41:28,596 --> 01:41:32,396
Nandan Kamtekar's fingerprints which
we found on the car's steering wheel.

1255
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:36,329
We also have a witness who
saw him driving that night.

1256
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:39,397
We have a case here.

1257
01:41:43,878 --> 01:41:45,004
ls this a mistake?

1258
01:41:50,951 --> 01:41:53,010
Nobody's out here to frame Nandu.

1259
01:41:54,355 --> 01:41:57,017
ln fact someone's
tried hard to save him.

1260
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:00,691
Usman Ali has bribed
to close this file.

1261
01:42:04,965 --> 01:42:06,830
This is not an official investigation.

1262
01:42:07,635 --> 01:42:09,330
My junior and l have done it.

1263
01:42:14,642 --> 01:42:19,045
So you know Anna is not responsible
for your accident...it is Nandu.

1264
01:42:23,384 --> 01:42:25,045
You can have a lawyer
check the file if you wish.

1265
01:42:26,053 --> 01:42:27,543
She loves you a lot, right?

1266
01:42:29,056 --> 01:42:33,322
Why are you screwing her life to keep
One Shot alive, you jerk!

1267
01:42:38,332 --> 01:42:39,390
What do you expect from me?

1268
01:42:41,936 --> 01:42:42,994
Co-operation.

1269
01:42:59,887 --> 01:43:02,913
pinky, are you okay?

1270
01:43:03,757 --> 01:43:08,592
Splash some water on
your face and come.

1271
01:43:58,012 --> 01:44:00,412
pinky, you don't need eyes to see.
You need to be possessed.

1272
01:44:05,953 --> 01:44:08,421
Looks like you guys
have become friends.

1273
01:44:13,494 --> 01:44:15,428
Not just skate.
You will also dance with me.

1274
01:44:25,172 --> 01:44:29,666
You'll skate with me for
friendship...not out of pity.

1275
01:44:35,482 --> 01:44:37,177
Have l lost it to dance with you!

1276
01:44:37,785 --> 01:44:40,686
people who lose it, make it big.

1277
01:44:49,029 --> 01:44:52,192
Anna is not responsible for
your accident...it is Nandu.

1278
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:43,243
How much did you win?
- 15000!

1279
01:45:46,787 --> 01:45:47,845
There he is.

1280
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:50,247
Take me to him.

1281
01:45:51,258 --> 01:45:52,520
Nandu!

1282
01:45:54,728 --> 01:45:55,786
What are you guys doing here?

1283
01:45:58,766 --> 01:45:59,824
What's wrong?

1284
01:46:09,276 --> 01:46:10,675
A cop had come from
the police station.

1285
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,843
They found your
fingerprints on the steering wheel.

1286
01:46:20,554 --> 01:46:21,612
Anna didn't screw my life.

1287
01:46:21,789 --> 01:46:23,552
You did, Nandu!

1288
01:46:28,929 --> 01:46:31,989
All that help,
love...everything was a bloody joke.

1289
01:46:36,103 --> 01:46:37,627
You just took pity on me, didn't you?

1290
01:46:41,575 --> 01:46:44,203
Answer me. Answer me!

1291
01:46:47,014 --> 01:46:48,743
You love to play God, huh?

1292
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:55,084
First you make a girl blind. Then you
take pity on her and make her life.

1293
01:46:58,325 --> 01:46:59,587
You call yourself my friend!

1294
01:47:03,664 --> 01:47:05,256
You and l are over, One Shot Nandu.

1295
01:47:10,237 --> 01:47:12,330
For the first time l loved
someone with all my heart.

1296
01:47:15,609 --> 01:47:16,667
But my bloody fate!

1297
01:47:18,612 --> 01:47:19,670
pinky, listen to me...

1298
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,308
Let's go, Chaddi.

1299
01:47:26,353 --> 01:47:27,615
Diesel, let's go.

1300
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:33,952
What do you want to be?
A friend or a suck-up?

1301
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:37,188
Chaddi, let's go.

1302
01:47:38,298 --> 01:47:39,356
You bloody suck-up.

1303
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:53,271
Team Tolly

1304
01:47:53,313 --> 01:47:54,371
Why didn't you tell her?

1305
01:47:57,217 --> 01:47:58,377
What's the point now?

1306
01:48:11,098 --> 01:48:17,003
Eyes with wings full of hope and light

1307
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:22,904
Will wash away the
darkness and shine on bright

1308
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:29,679
And if ever so ever
they well up with rain

1309
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:35,686
They'll silently weep
and smile through pain

1310
01:48:36,356 --> 01:48:41,316
ln the blink of an
eye they'll fly away

1311
01:48:42,796 --> 01:48:48,098
Forget their pain
and smile all the way

1312
01:48:48,735 --> 01:48:50,896
Helpless they are not

1313
01:48:51,205 --> 01:48:55,107
These dreamy eyes.

1314
01:48:55,442 --> 01:48:57,307
Eyes with wings

1315
01:48:57,711 --> 01:49:00,179
Two crazy eyes

1316
01:49:00,247 --> 01:49:01,305
How the hell did this happen?

1317
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:06,210
What about the show tomorrow?

1318
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:09,445
You guys have reached
the finals for God's sake!

1319
01:49:12,459 --> 01:49:14,791
Your dream...
your passport out of here...

1320
01:49:18,365 --> 01:49:19,423
l'll do it alone.

1321
01:49:22,002 --> 01:49:23,469
Alone? Are you out of your mind?

1322
01:49:24,871 --> 01:49:25,997
The channel guys will never agree.

1323
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:32,336
l didn't reach here to
watch the finals on TV.

1324
01:49:35,315 --> 01:49:38,478
l will dance. And l'll dance alone.

1325
01:49:41,088 --> 01:49:42,749
Nobody has the balls to stop me.

1326
01:50:55,062 --> 01:50:56,552
You guys are still not in the wings!

1327
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:00,924
Where's Nandu?
- He's coming. You go...

1328
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:02,263
Guys, we are rolling in 5.

1329
01:51:03,937 --> 01:51:04,995
Think again, pinky.

1330
01:51:06,039 --> 01:51:08,303
You guys keep lying to
them till l go on stage.

1331
01:51:08,508 --> 01:51:09,566
pinky, please...
- Tina!

1332
01:51:10,844 --> 01:51:15,907
Coming up next are the dashing
Nandu and the blind beauty on skates.

1333
01:51:15,982 --> 01:51:17,574
pinky palkar!

1334
01:51:42,943 --> 01:51:44,433
Where's Nandu?
- l don't know.

1335
01:53:07,694 --> 01:53:09,491
Why the hell are you here?
- pinky, don't stop.

1336
01:53:09,963 --> 01:53:11,021
Why are you here?

1337
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:16,965
Don't let one Nandu come
in the way of your dream.

1338
01:53:22,976 --> 01:53:24,102
You wanted to be mad, right?

1339
01:53:25,712 --> 01:53:27,043
Show them what madness is.

1340
01:53:29,483 --> 01:53:30,575
Let's dance in such a way, pinky...

1341
01:53:31,218 --> 01:53:33,186
...that nobody will
dare stop us from winning.

1342
01:53:36,356 --> 01:53:37,414
C'mon!

1343
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:26,094
What a brilliant performance!

1344
01:55:29,302 --> 01:55:30,428
The folks from Tilakwaadi....

1345
01:55:30,503 --> 01:55:31,834
Tilakwaadi!

1346
01:55:33,106 --> 01:55:34,835
The folks from Tilakwaadi are
mighty excited as you can see...

1347
01:55:34,908 --> 01:55:36,671
And why not! lt was such
a brilliant performance

1348
01:55:36,843 --> 01:55:38,333
Let's see what our judges have to say.

1349
01:55:43,783 --> 01:55:44,841
Did you get through mom?

1350
01:55:44,918 --> 01:55:46,180
No, we'll call her.

1351
01:55:46,252 --> 01:55:48,117
You call the drummers, man.

1352
01:55:48,188 --> 01:55:50,122
You want to dance again!
- Just see how Tilakwaadi...

1353
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:53,124
Diesel...where's Nandu?

1354
01:55:53,627 --> 01:55:55,322
He left.
- Left? Where?

1355
01:55:55,462 --> 01:55:57,293
To work.
- He's mad!

1356
01:55:58,632 --> 01:55:59,690
You are right.

1357
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,134
pinky managed to
make him mad, after all.

1358
01:56:02,869 --> 01:56:04,131
Diesel!

1359
01:56:06,139 --> 01:56:07,197
He was getting thrashed.

1360
01:56:08,742 --> 01:56:10,141
He left with his head hanging low...

1361
01:56:11,144 --> 01:56:12,736
...right in front of the same
people who once treated him like God.

1362
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:15,610
Nandu...
- He lost the fight.

1363
01:56:17,217 --> 01:56:18,275
Nandu lost the fight?!

1364
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:20,377
And we didn't even get to know.

1365
01:56:20,654 --> 01:56:23,214
lt's not a TV show that the
whole waadi will come to know.

1366
01:56:24,891 --> 01:56:26,153
How?

1367
01:56:26,226 --> 01:56:28,160
Usman forced Nandu to lose.

1368
01:56:29,896 --> 01:56:31,261
He threatened to
tell pinky everything.

1369
01:56:34,534 --> 01:56:35,592
Nandu was scared...

1370
01:56:37,737 --> 01:56:38,897
Not because he'll lose the fight...

1371
01:56:41,441 --> 01:56:42,806
Because he'll lose pinky...

1372
01:56:48,848 --> 01:56:50,247
He loves you a hell lot, pinky.

1373
01:56:52,485 --> 01:56:53,543
You wanted him to be mad, right?

1374
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:56,646
There. He's mad about you!

1375
01:57:34,828 --> 01:57:36,227
pathak! ls it clear upstairs?

1376
01:57:36,362 --> 01:57:37,420
Yes, Nandu.

1377
01:57:42,402 --> 01:57:43,460
Good night.

1378
01:57:44,704 --> 01:57:45,898
You got change for 10 bucks?

1379
01:58:09,262 --> 01:58:10,320
What are you doing here, pinky?

1380
01:58:17,937 --> 01:58:18,995
You know what, Nandu...

1381
01:58:20,006 --> 01:58:22,474
...l kept asking myself just
one thing after the accident.

1382
01:58:24,878 --> 01:58:26,277
Why was l in front of
that car that night!

1383
01:58:29,282 --> 01:58:30,579
Now l know why.

1384
01:58:35,021 --> 01:58:37,012
You didn't mess up my life on purpose.

1385
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:40,792
But if l wouldn't
have come back today...

1386
01:58:42,295 --> 01:58:44,559
...l would have messed
both our lives on purpose.

1387
01:58:48,434 --> 01:58:50,299
l realized one thing
in the past two days.

1388
01:58:53,306 --> 01:58:57,936
You made me blind...but you taught me
how to see with my heart.

1389
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:05,050
l don't want to be blind again.

1390
01:59:08,922 --> 01:59:11,550
When you are with me,
you make me want to see.

1391
01:59:15,929 --> 01:59:17,920
l want to see this
world with you, Nandu.

1392
01:59:21,935 --> 01:59:22,993
Will you see it with me?

1393
01:59:54,734 --> 01:59:56,031
You blind pile on!

1394
01:59:57,103 --> 01:59:58,365
ldiot!

1395
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:13,050
The winners of lndia's Got
Talent are Nandu and pinky!

1396
02:00:36,743 --> 02:00:39,507
Oh! So, it's a love story.

1397
02:00:42,815 --> 02:00:43,873
pinky, you can go home.

1398
02:00:46,653 --> 02:00:47,711
Thank you, sir.

1399
02:01:04,504 --> 02:01:06,768
lsnt't it good when a
close one is also close by?

1400
02:01:10,944 --> 02:01:12,002
Yes, sir.

1401
02:01:12,645 --> 02:01:15,170
C'mon, let's drink to that.

1402
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:18,610
We'll deal with Usman later.
