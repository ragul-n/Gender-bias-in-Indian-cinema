1
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,646
Mr. Tripathi.

2
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,173
No comments.

3
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,268
Handle them.

4
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,277
Hello, Mr. Khwaja.

5
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,472
Sorry for answering
your call so late.

6
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,835
You see...l was in the shower.

7
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,610
You're taking a bath
and I am getting stripped.

8
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,940
Is this what you
call media-management?

9
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,975
I've been humiliated on television.

10
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,005
Of course, Mr. Khwaja, this is...

11
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,372
This is ridiculous.

12
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,875
Why will you kill Avinash Tripathi?

13
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,573
Because...his death was necessary.

14
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,368
What?

15
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,137
That means you...

16
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,075
Even after I bribed him...
I still didn't trust him.

17
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:19,205
He had to die by a simple
road accident, but... - Yes.

18
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,270
That's what the news report states.

19
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,913
But...the post-mortem
report won't state that.

20
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,946
He was run-over by a car, but...

21
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,175
...someone shot him before that.

22
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,776
Its Killol's conspiracy to trap me.

23
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,511
Entire plan's been foiled.

24
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,538
There may be a way out, Mr. Khwaja.

25
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,612
There's one way.

26
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,874
CBI inspector Mr. Tripathi...

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,142
...was conducting an inquiry on the
Asian Olympic Games, Bilal Khwaja.

28
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,540
Last night,
he died in a motor accident.

29
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,341
What's this?

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,801
Motor accident?

31
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,608
Didn't I tell you? - Yes, sir.

32
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,813
Avinash Tripathi worked for Khwaja.

33
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,740
Nothing would been
proven in the CBI inquiry.

34
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,334
So?

35
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,441
I did shoot Tripathi to trap Khwaja.

36
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,171
You bloody nincompoop.

37
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,946
What's this motor accident?

38
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,875
Don't be disheartened, sir.

39
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,744
I did shoot him.

40
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,869
But he ran off to the road.

41
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,869
It's all his fault.

42
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,577
He was breaking traffic rules.

43
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:32,143
You...

44
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,408
He was crossing the road
without looking left-right.

45
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,671
You rascal...

46
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,279
You should have learnt the law
after learning to shoot.

47
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,737
Bloody a*****e... Me.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,174
"There's you, there's me."

49
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,776
"Together...the embassy of love."

50
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,239
"There's you...there's me."

51
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,477
"The embassy of love."

52
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,512
"Your expensive bangle,
your glittering sandal."

53
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,010
"Your expensive bangle,
your glittering sandal."

54
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:22,708
"O girl...what do I do?"

55
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:25,914
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

56
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,412
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

57
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,014
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

58
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,978
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

59
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,570
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

60
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,113
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,609
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

62
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,840
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

63
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,647
"Your eyes are killer,
they are after my life."

64
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,304
"Take my life, that's all
I keep saying all day."

65
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,871
"Your eyes are killer,
they are after my life."

66
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,344
"Take my life,
that's all I keep saying all day."

67
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,937
"Don't show attitude,
listen to what I've to say."

68
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,514
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,047
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

70
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:42,137
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio"

71
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,147
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio."

72
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,770
"Your dangling earrings,
your shaking butt."

73
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,404
"Your dangling earrings,
your shaking butt."

74
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,846
"O girl...l am floored."

75
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,147
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio."

76
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,942
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio."

77
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,179
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio."

78
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,179
"You got me going crazy
with your lath-patio."

79
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:42,814
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

80
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:46,280
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

81
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,842
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

82
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:53,881
"Round-n-round your
bum is going round."

83
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,671
Aids! Aids!

84
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:00,943
You...

85
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,208
Aids! - What the...

86
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,134
What?

87
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,941
I've been banging
on the door for so long.

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,412
You're so unlucky.

89
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,738
All you get is a door for banging...

90
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,676
So what do I do?

91
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:21,079
And the name is
Anand lshwaram Devdutt Subramanium.

92
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,009
Okay?

93
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,570
That's A I D S.

94
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,404
AIDS!

95
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:26,912
Turak... - Hey.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,001
Aids.

97
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,138
Aids, you promised. No more abusing.

98
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,610
Not even in Russian!

99
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,178
Otherwise no marriage.
- I am trying, baby.

100
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,344
But you know... -I know.

101
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,140
There's a lot of stress
in your line of work.

102
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,371
So dangerous.

103
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,171
Investigative journalism.

104
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,143
Undercover Sting Operation.

105
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,712
Personal advisor
to the Prime Minister.

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,741
You're my super hero.

107
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,306
I love you.

108
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,743
I love you too.

109
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,972
She speaks so fluent Hindi now.

110
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,979
Kiss me. - No, Tina.

111
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,773
That line's just for me.

112
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,305
Tina, my goodbye kiss.

113
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,901
Love you.

114
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,168
Bye, sweetheart.

115
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,211
I'll wait for you.

116
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:21,937
See! See!

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,305
Oh my! New watch!

118
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,904
$800 plus.

119
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,468
Gift from Tina.

120
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,501
Wow.

121
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,978
Is that what you
charge for one night?

122
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,545
At least I charge.

123
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,146
I don't do free service like you.

124
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,268
Catch.

125
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,341
Monsoon!

126
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,368
Monsoon!

127
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,140
At least I don't lie like you do.

128
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,937
"Danger! Adventure!"

129
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,410
Liar.

130
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,578
And remember, today's
the review of our news story.

131
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,137
Yes, I remember.

132
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,540
Why do I always have to push?

133
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,076
We're sitting in this super-car...

134
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,510
...because of this
superhero's superstition.

135
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,611
This car belongs to
an award-winning journalist.

136
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,735
"Take it. Take it."

137
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,278
It's okay. - Now push.

138
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:21,243
Mom's calling.

139
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,041
Hello.

140
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,081
Hello, mom.
- You're not worried at all.

141
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,468
Oh no, cop!

142
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,774
Stop...stop, park that car. - Oh no.

143
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:29,934
Park the car.

144
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,534
Hello!

145
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,245
Press. - Press what?

146
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,539
You've no clue about home...

147
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,271
...how are you going
to keep a tab on the world?

148
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,779
Stop it! - What happened?

149
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,072
It hasn't yet, it will happen now.

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,909
You'll be fined,
show me your license.

151
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,668
Let us go.

152
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,269
We're already in a fix.

153
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,073
Your sister's still unmarried.

154
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,703
And what more, she's pregnant.

155
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,542
How? - How else.

156
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,102
With the neighbor's bull.

157
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,840
She ran away with him.

158
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,404
Chutki's pregnant
with the bull's child.

159
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,408
See, mister.

160
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,208
Chutki's pregnant
with the bull's child.

161
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,138
What?

162
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,874
Have you lost your mind?

163
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,843
I was talking about Sheila,
not Chutki.

164
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,208
My buffalo. Move aside.

165
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Not Chutki.

166
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,279
Sheila's pregnant
with the bull's child.

167
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,834
Not Chutki.

168
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,944
Sheila's pregnant
with the bull's child.

169
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,138
Here's 100 Rs. And go celebrate.

170
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,541
And let us go.

171
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,079
But...there must be a way.

172
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,771
1000 chants.

173
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,379
But it will be expensive.

174
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,277
Sheila's not a buffalo,
she's my child.

175
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,573
If anything happens to Sheila...

176
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,976
...I swear I will give up my life.

177
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,341
Fine. Fine, mom.

178
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,878
It's not about money.

179
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,576
It's about finding
a trustworthy priest.

180
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,374
I know a priest here.

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,136
I'll make a CD and send it to you.

182
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,771
You can keep playing
it as long as you want.

183
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,006
Okay. - Don't forget.

184
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,605
It's coming.
The CD's coming.

185
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,411
Another link connecting
to the cruelty on women...

186
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,910
...in the office over the phone.

187
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,634
Hey...

188
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:34,544
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

189
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,877
"Going like we're going on."

190
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,042
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

191
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,740
"Going like we're going on."

192
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,971
"You dwell in my eyes."

193
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:50,004
"You're my passion, baby."

194
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,573
"You dwell in my eyes."

195
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,639
"You're my passion, baby."

196
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,307
"I wonder where you come from."

197
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,837
"You steal my sleep."

198
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,473
"You're my serenity."

199
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,306
"But I don't know why."

200
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,874
"But I know that
I've lost my heart."

201
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,436
"Someone's prayers
have been answered."

202
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,510
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

203
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,173
"Going like we're going on."

204
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:27,042
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

205
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,511
"Going like we're going on."

206
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,671
"My heart is getting naughty."

207
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,475
"Come flirt with me."

208
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,944
"I want to be naughty."

209
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,637
"I won't stop you."

210
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,304
"My heart is getting naughty."

211
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,937
"Come flirt with me."

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,479
"I want to be naughty."

213
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,035
"I won't stop you."

214
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:56,173
"My heart is spoiled."

215
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,338
"What do I do with it now?"

216
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:03,074
"Come closer, don't torment me."

217
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,645
"Let's things happen."

218
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,008
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

219
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,102
"Going like we're going on."

220
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,506
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

221
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,874
"Going like we're going on."

222
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,774
"In your eyes..."

223
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,775
"In your eyes..."

224
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,111
"In your eyes..."

225
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,309
"In your eyes..."

226
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,446
"Let's make a mistake."

227
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,171
"What's the hurry?"

228
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,803
"I can't control myself."

229
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,437
"Do what you want."

230
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,069
"Let's make a mistake."

231
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,669
"What's the hurry?"

232
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,370
"I can't control myself."

233
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,775
"Do what you want."

234
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:52,007
"Somethings happening to me."

235
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,908
"it's the intoxication of time."

236
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,975
"Let's lose consciousness,
erase these distances."

237
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,512
"Let things happen."

238
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,908
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

239
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,311
"Going like we're going on."

240
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:15,576
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

241
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,909
"Going like we're going on."

242
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,177
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

243
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,144
"Going like we're going on."

244
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,744
"I can see it in your eyes,
moving inside it."

245
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,041
"Going like we're going on."

246
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,434
I know...l know.

247
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,973
I know this is a big story.

248
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,047
But why is Killol after
the Post Monem.

249
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,368
Hello.

250
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,468
Yes, hello.

251
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,168
Hello.

252
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,034
Network.

253
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,434
May I?

254
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,611
Hail Lord Ganesha!

255
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,510
Hail Lord Ganesha!

256
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,544
The queue you see behind me...

257
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09,205
...is not outside a temple,
but the market.

258
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,574
Yes, the vegetable market.

259
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,846
And they're all here
to behold a piece of Ginger.

260
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,846
Yes, Ginger...which
has taken the form...

261
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,040
...of Lord Ganesha Himself.

262
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,842
For the first time,
our channel is bringing you...

263
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:26,105
...the unique picture of Ginger
Ganesh on your television screen!

264
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:32,368
Incredible!

265
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:33,634
Isn't it? - Thanks.

266
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,841
No, you idiots.

267
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,470
Who's going to watch this?

268
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,771
<i>It's bidvkkt</i>

269
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,710
But, ma'am...watch further.

270
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,471
The ginger Ganesh drinks milk.

271
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,670
Ginger Ganesh!

272
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,210
Ginger Ganesh! - Turn it off!

273
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,905
Ginger Ganesh! - Turn it off now.

274
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,838
Thanks to such useless
stories and exposes...

275
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,307
...the TRP of your show is lower...

276
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,370
...than the chewing
gum stuck under my shoe.

277
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,608
What are you doing?

278
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:59,976
What do people want?

279
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,808
People want scandals.

280
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,937
They want scams.

281
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,512
Rape, dacoity, bribery, kidnapping.

282
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,239
You can bump into a story
even with your eyes closed.

283
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,740
This...Avinash Tripathi story.

284
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,411
And what did you two cover?

285
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,634
Ginger?

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,503
Madam, your ginger tea.
- I don't want it, Ganesh.

287
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,701
<i>Okay'</i>

288
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,210
And you two. Last chance.

289
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,140
Get me a solid story.

290
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,577
Otherwise this show
is going off air...

291
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,443
...and your job's...gone.

292
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,068
Shall we?

293
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,640
You invited me for lunch, so...

294
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,335
...it must be something important.

295
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,043
So, what can I do for you?

296
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,305
There's...news for you.

297
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,844
About Avinash Tripathi?

298
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,734
What?

299
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,607
Khwaja sir is resigning?

300
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,078
On the contrary...

301
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,178
...the post-modem report
clearly states it was an accident.

302
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,703
Avinash Tripathi
was run-over by a car.

303
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:17,343
In fact, the police have
also arrested the car driver.

304
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,534
Wow.

305
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,475
You're fast.

306
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,509
Fast news has a price.

307
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,647
You're...a newspaper editor.

308
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,913
Who else would know
it better than you?

309
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,909
This news should be published
in your newspaper first.

310
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,374
Would you excuse me a moment,
please? - Sure.

311
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:48,268
Hello.

312
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,644
Yes, Mr. Editor. Hello.

313
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,944
The post monem
report has arrived.

314
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,780
Avinash Tripathi died
due to being run-over by car.

315
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,546
What? Have you lost your mind?

316
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,578
We shot him first.

317
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:10,810
Later Khwaja had
him run-over by a car.

318
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:11,934
Yes.

319
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,341
And corpses don't lie, idiot!

320
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,444
But post monem reports can.

321
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,935
Khwaja has made
all the arrangements.

322
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,139
I guess he's going to play
a long innings as the chairman.

323
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:28,143
Hey fool.
The game isn't over yet, Mr. Editor.

324
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,211
I'll talk to you later.

325
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,369
What the...

326
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,005
What happened, Mr. Killol?

327
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,803
What happened? - B***s happened.

328
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,238
They dissected the entire body...

329
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,777
...but didn't find the bullet.

330
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,534
What?

331
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,039
What is this, Mr. Killol?

332
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,776
You said after this
Khwaja is sure to go.

333
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,136
Chairmanship will be yours and...

334
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,011
...the contract for the interiors
at the Game will be mine.

335
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,406
Right, Mr. Killol.

336
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,538
Isn't that what you said?

337
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,540
You think this is a child's play...

338
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,212
...where I just wave my hands...

339
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,803
...and give you the contract?

340
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,280
They made the bullet
disappear...from the corpse.

341
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,576
So...you make the corpse disappear?

342
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,102
And we'll find the bullet.

343
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,004
What the...

344
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,206
I'll jump in the water.

345
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,507
What an idea. Jump.

346
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,138
That Monsoon always
wants a big scam.

347
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,906
And where will I get a scam that big?

348
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,878
Do you know what scam means?

349
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,746
It's much bigger than theft,
dacoity, rape.

350
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,701
What do you mean?

351
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,801
I mean...

352
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:51,384
When a poor steals...it's a theft.

353
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,079
And when someone
important does it...

354
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,974
...that's a scam. - Okay.

355
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,069
Only someone important can scam.

356
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,473
Bravo.

357
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,240
All okay.

358
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,345
Oh no.

359
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,146
You knocked it.

360
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,902
Who rams it down like this?

361
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,903
The place is Janata (Public).

362
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,011
So it's obvious.

363
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,535
They're used to it.

364
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,668
Fine.

365
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:24,848
Chhada sir. - What Chhada?

366
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,139
Chhada's getting squeezed.

367
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,707
Tea. - Bravo, boy.

368
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,901
Oh no.

369
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,412
'Dabbang Tempered Lentil.'

370
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:35,878
'Wanted Stuffed bread.'

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,971
Hey, pack me Judwaa Double Omelet.

372
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,810
You see, Chhada.
I run a small stall.

373
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,645
Not the LIC office,
"With you, always".

374
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,476
Do one thing,
settle your old account...

375
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,604
...and start a new one.

376
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,576
You never think big.

377
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,210
When I park my BMW
in front of your stall...

378
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,244
...think about your stature then.

379
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,437
Think?

380
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,208
Put it in my account.

381
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,104
I'll pay back every penny,
with interest.

382
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:09,934
Like always...

383
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,840
Don't laugh...

384
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,543
You don't know...I've
pulled the right strings.

385
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,403
I'm about to get a big contract.

386
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,434
For what?

387
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,307
Asian Olympics.

388
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,807
Chhada sir, here you go.

389
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,444
PP. Scam!

390
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:27,442
Chhada, please tell us
in detail about this contract.

391
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,704
Interview, me? - Yes, on camera.

392
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,145
No Chhada sir, you know he's joking.

393
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,437
Come here.

394
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,308
I'm saying this off-record.

395
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,509
Entire Delhi has to be decorated.
- I see.

396
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,601
Like a bride.

397
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,972
The streets,
alleys, crossroads, flyovers.

398
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,340
...are to be decorated with pots.

399
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,902
Whose? - Chhada's?

400
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,311
I just bribed an important officer.

401
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,944
He's an honest man.

402
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,445
Once he takes the money
consider your job done.

403
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,310
What are you saying?

404
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,538
Hey...

405
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:04,182
It started in one kick,
congratulations.

406
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,371
That's a big scam.

407
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,501
Chhada sir.

408
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:08,705
Bye, Chhada sir.

409
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,434
What do we do?

410
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,443
Stop the car. - Forget it, Aids.

411
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:22,637
How long are you going to?

412
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:23,905
If you don't stop the car...

413
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,070
...then yourjalopy
will definitely rust.

414
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,501
Actually, you know what...

415
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,672
...I should turn this
jalopy into a toilet.

416
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,034
I'll do it here.

417
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,976
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop! Stop!

418
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,641
You're just...

419
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,511
Run! Run! Run!

420
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,001
Look, car.

421
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,239
Let's dump it in this.

422
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,110
Come out...

423
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:49,973
Hurry.

424
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:06,675
What are you doing?

425
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,343
Keep listening to
Radio City 91.1 with me.

426
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,404
And the next song is
dedicated to Delhi.

427
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:36,479
"Delhi..."

428
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:37,905
Hey, who's that?

429
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:42,311
"Delhi..."

430
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,911
Hey, who are you?

431
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:47,675
Hey... Avinash... Tripathi.

432
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,001
You know him.

433
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:52,307
ACP Avinash Tripathi.

434
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,878
He's Avinash...- No.

435
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,674
Now he's a corpse.

436
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,769
Hello sir. - Hello sir.

437
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,944
Hello. Hello. Hello.

438
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,168
All okay?

439
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,539
Move aside

440
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:12,934
Sir.

441
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:15,978
Did you get the corpse? - Yes.

442
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:17,405
Where is it? - In the car.

443
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:19,113
Where's the car? - It's gone.

444
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,608
What?

445
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,408
We got the corpse from the morgue.

446
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,743
They gave him a complete makeover...

447
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,176
...with makeup and everything.

448
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,677
As if they're going to a party.

449
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,473
Later the police started chasing us.

450
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,234
Stop the car.

451
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,211
The police is after us,
don't stop the car.

452
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,539
Idiots, it's a red light.

453
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,442
Stop the car.
It's illegal to jump a red light.

454
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,568
Stop the car.

455
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,177
They jumped the signal.

456
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,246
They're breaking the law.

457
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,312
It's green, take a U-turn.

458
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,368
Hurry UP-

459
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,602
You didn't go back
to get the corpse.

460
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,974
What are you saying, sir?

461
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,445
Like I said...the car's gone.

462
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,638
You know, it was ajunk. Junk.

463
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,276
But someone was still dragging it.

464
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,005
Tell him.

465
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,273
What...- Shut up.

466
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,402
It's illegal to drive
a car older than 15 years.

467
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,468
It's spreading sickness.

468
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,772
Making it difficult to breathe.

469
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,080
So much pollution...- Rascal.

470
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,676
I'm going to spread you.
- Don't worry.

471
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,179
I'll get you the corpse.
Don't worry about that corpse.

472
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,268
We're getting to it right now.

473
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,506
I'm going to file a
case against those guys...

474
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,476
...who drive such an old car...
- Rascal...

475
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,504
You nincompoop, rascal, a****e.

476
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,240
What do I do with you?

477
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,976
Stop abusing, that's all.

478
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:49,008
Why don't we...
- Let's not do anything.

479
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,569
Let's not do anything.

480
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,840
This is a huge scam.
Don't you get it?

481
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,641
We can't get involved in this.

482
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,838
So are we taking this
corpse for sightseeing?

483
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,310
What if someone sees him?

484
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,314
No. No one will see him.

485
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:01,978
Car's the safest place.

486
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,105
Haven't you seen...

487
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,340
...so many rapes
are committed in a car.

488
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,810
You've lost your mind.

489
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,140
We can't carry this
corpse around forever.

490
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:11,807
I suggest that we dump
this corpse and leave.

491
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,139
We'll be caught.
We'll definitely be caught.

492
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,379
We're bad luck.

493
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,371
I know...let's go to the
police and tell them everything.

494
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,839
Yes, what will we say to them?

495
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,378
Sir, this corpse landed
in our car itself.

496
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,104
And died. -Yes!

497
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,373
You will kill me.

498
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,037
And anyway,
women are never spared alive.

499
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,374
PP, you? - Aunty, you?

500
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,203
Sorry aunty, you suddenly
appeared in front of the car...

501
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,404
Yeah, it's always we who
are at fault. - I was just...

502
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,613
I was out buying vegetables for you.

503
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,338
I didn't know that
you'll run-over me.

504
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,535
Where are you going?

505
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,738
Aunty, I'm heading for the Shani market
then the Buddh market and then...

506
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,970
Aunty, we're going home.

507
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,840
Yes, so that's where I am going.
- Aunty.

508
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,938
Cancer, how are you? - Not Cancer.

509
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,837
Aids. - It's the same thing.

510
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,401
<i>No, aunty.</i>

511
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:03,372
Sit in the front.

512
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,035
What are you doing?

513
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,636
Get out.

514
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,877
Let it be, let him sit there.

515
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,846
Aunty. - Let him sit there,
I'll sit at the back.

516
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:12,845
<i>No, aunty.</i>

517
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,312
I don't take up too much space.

518
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,434
<i>No aunty.</i>

519
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:19,841
Hurry UP-

520
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,046
Myself Preeto. And you?

521
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,112
He's a friend, aunty.
- Avinash Tripathi.

522
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,078
Yes, yes...

523
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,942
<i>Yes Aunty.</i>

524
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,969
He's a colleague.

525
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,044
I knew it...this face
should be on television.

526
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,708
Where's your family?

527
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,071
He's single.

528
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:53,337
Me too.

529
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,280
Relax. What's the hurry?

530
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,345
We'll meet later.

531
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,779
PP, drive carefully. - Yes.

532
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,113
Keep eyes on the road while driving.

533
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,407
Faster! Faster! Faster!

534
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,947
Killol's pricking me
like a nail in a broken chair.

535
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,335
What happened now, Nahata sir?

536
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,640
Something that's beyond imagination.

537
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,777
Killol abducted the corpse.

538
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,469
Kidnapping, of a dead body.

539
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,979
What else can a cheap
minister like him do?

540
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,040
But my name's Khwaja.

541
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,669
It's not easy to
snatch my chairmanship.

542
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,102
Sir, not that again.

543
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,746
Killol will prove that
you had the CBI inspector shot.

544
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,637
You'll lose your chairmanship.

545
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,146
And all the contracts that you...

546
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,078
...gave Nahata Constructions
will be cancelled.

547
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,737
Isn't that total loss?

548
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,737
We'll be at total loss when...

549
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,140
...I'll be spinning
the wheel in jail...

550
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,505
...and you'll be selling 'Khadi'.

551
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,705
Khwaja sir, our house is on fire...

552
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,642
...and you're warming your hands.

553
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,137
Nahata sir.

554
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,908
Yes.

555
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:58,177
This is politics,
if you can't tie your string...

556
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,703
...then don't wear pyjamas.

557
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,471
Get that?
- You're right, Mr. Khwaja.

558
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,880
Now you'll have to do something.

559
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,801
Please.

560
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,779
Sherry. In our
country...the law's blind.

561
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,108
The people are dumb.

562
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,179
Administration is deaf.

563
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,477
And anything's possible...

564
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,679
...amidst these three
monkeys of Gandhiji.

565
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,105
Khwaja sir, what do we need to do?

566
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,276
We need a corpse? - Another corpse.

567
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:40,372
Avinash Tripathi's final rites...

568
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,711
...will be performed
with national honor.

569
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,270
The pyre has to burn.

570
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:47,741
The corpse can be anyone.

571
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,807
You could've stopped
a little more further...

572
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:56,904
...it wouldn't have hurt your car.

573
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Listen, come home.

574
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,738
Bring this Cancer too.

575
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:06,638
And yes...and your friend too.

576
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:10,476
Bye.

577
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,537
Please explain to me, PP.

578
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,112
What's happening?

579
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,068
We cannot keep him here.

580
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,304
We'll have to take him up.

581
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,141
Phone is ringing.

582
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,134
Phone is ringing.

583
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,534
Hi, love.

584
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,242
He)' You stupid!

585
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,869
I'll call you later.

586
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,001
It's okay.

587
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,235
Pick him up.

588
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:32,505
Pick him up.

589
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,603
He's stuck.

590
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,201
Oh no.

591
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,540
Lift him carefully, and with force.

592
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,213
What's going on, Mr. Prantab Pratap.

593
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,904
This is murder.

594
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,637
It can't be done in broad daylight.

595
00:32:56,034 --> 00:33:00,039
Mr... Chatterjee... this corpse...

596
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,976
Exactly, the corpse.

597
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,641
This is the nation's corpse.

598
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,147
You must do something about this.

599
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,235
Correct.

600
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,535
Right.

601
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:11,405
Mister.

602
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,376
You look familiar.

603
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,071
See all you want.

604
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,847
Soon you won't see anyone here.

605
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,275
How can they serve
an eviction notice?

606
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:24,968
Eviction notice?

607
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,001
Who...

608
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,146
Who are they evicting?
- They're evicting me.

609
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:29,372
Him.

610
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,504
You.

611
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,171
They're evicting the entire society.

612
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:36,140
Mister...do you
own a shop at Sadar?

613
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,340
How can anyone evict us?

614
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,208
We have few principles.

615
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,277
Why are you quiet?

616
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:46,268
Say something.

617
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,806
He...doesn't speak much. - Yes.

618
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,813
You should expose Mr. Anand.

619
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,139
How can we...

620
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,209
Your friend's... too friendly.

621
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:00,668
Sometimes...

622
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,906
What are you doing?

623
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:07,909
Mr. Chatterjee, actually I was
reading the Residents of FSTTHS...

624
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,545
We can't do this story, sir.

625
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:12,871
Why not?

626
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,373
Because...

627
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,940
We're already burdened...
with a huge responsibility.

628
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:17,570
Yes.

629
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,170
Look. Look. Look.

630
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:23,407
The illegitimate children of...
corruption and consumerism.

631
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,043
I will tell Didi.

632
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,702
I'll strive, I'll fight, I'll win.

633
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,471
Come on.

634
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,605
I'll strive, I'll fight, I'll win.

635
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:35,604
Hello.

636
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,079
Monsoon, we've a body. - What?

637
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:41,843
I mean we've a dead body,
of Avinash Tripathi. - What?

638
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,135
Are you drunk, PP?

639
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:45,076
His body was cremated today.

640
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,577
With full state honors.

641
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,676
And they're even
showing repeat telecast.

642
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:49,575
Check your TV.

643
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,704
No, Monsoon.

644
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,548
Right here in my house,
in front of my eyes...

645
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,771
...his dead body's
lying right here.

646
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:58,578
I'll believe it when I see it.

647
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,203
Bring the dead body to
the channel office immediately.

648
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,075
Okay, Monsoon.

649
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,343
We're deeply sad about
Avinash Tripathi's death.

650
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,604
Sorry, Avi.

651
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,045
What are you doing?

652
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,671
That's my Tina's blanket.

653
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,138
Are you going to fly in it?

654
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,740
Tina's Superman.

655
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,612
Oh no. No network. - Now?

656
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:40,238
You two stay here,
I'll go get Monsoon?

657
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,641
Who?

658
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,046
No, brother. I am younger.

659
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,242
You stay here, I'll go get him.

660
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:50,972
No...l am elder, I'll go get him.
- No chance.

661
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,545
Don't leave me here
with this deadly body.

662
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,374
I see...- Don't go.

663
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,705
What happened to the respect now?

664
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:58,007
Rascal...
Come on.

665
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,142
<i>Okay'</i>

666
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,544
Come on.
All okay.

667
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,680
Sorry...we'll knock again.

668
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:21,635
What?

669
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,546
What happened? - Did you get hurt?

670
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,245
Idiots. Come back.

671
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,534
Have you brought the body?

672
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,704
Not body... Story!

673
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,904
Tremendous... story!

674
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:40,244
When you go up to receive
the journalist of the year award...

675
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,238
...don't mention us
in your 'Thank you' speech.

676
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:47,145
Shall we? - Come on.

677
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:50,068
Fools!

678
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,774
Where is it? - Here.

679
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:01,835
Oh no!

680
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,268
Where's the body?

681
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:06,368
Found it?

682
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,104
It's not here.

683
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,469
PP, I am stuck. - Madam...

684
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,474
Pull me out.

685
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,173
My shirfs stuck. Pull me out.

686
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:25,308
I told you...stay here with the body.

687
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,971
I didn't know...
it's a mobile corpse.

688
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,105
Runs away from the pyre, the car.

689
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,976
I told you to sit in the car.

690
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,876
I told you I'll go get Monsoon...
- It's your fault.

691
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,001
Shut up!

692
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,073
You think I'm a fool.

693
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,072
You two never had that corpse.

694
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,235
Liars!

695
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,914
Monsoon. We really had that corpse...
- Prantab Pratap.

696
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:52,412
You're not just a bad journalist...

697
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:53,970
...but a cheap human being as well.

698
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,944
I had warned you two.

699
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,072
You two are finished.

700
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,372
Give me your I-cards right now.

701
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,713
Right now! Give it to me.

702
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:06,613
But... - No! Give it to me.

703
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,238
Yours too. - It's not my fault...

704
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,177
No. Give it to me.

705
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,541
Ridiculous.

706
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,640
No need to come to
the office tomorrow.

707
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,701
Get that.

708
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,675
Ma'am... - I don't
want to see... your faces.

709
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,541
But...where did the corpse go?

710
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:45,082
We searched for it high and low...

711
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:49,537
...but the corpse was in a car.

712
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:52,335
Very nice.

713
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,038
We run a free media.

714
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,345
Whether we highlight
the news or hide it...

715
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,568
...that depends on us.

716
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,237
Media is the religion
of this new age.

717
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,205
People believe what you show them.

718
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:08,237
Monsoon, I've decided
to start my own channel.

719
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:08,743
Great.

720
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,179
I've also decided on a name.
- Great idea.

721
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,074
And it's a fantastic investment,
Khwaja sir.

722
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,268
Rascal...

723
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,839
By the way,
what about those two boys?

724
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:21,143
They know too much.

725
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:22,668
What else?

726
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,040
Let's bury them along with the body.
The end!

727
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,168
Right?

728
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:27,735
No need for that.

729
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,479
They don't want to get
involved in this anyway?

730
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,102
Why would they open their mouth?

731
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,141
Well said, Monsoon.

732
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,678
Why be scared of those
who are already scared.

733
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,404
When we tie a firecracker
on the dog's tail...

734
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,842
...it runs, not bark.

735
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,638
They're the youth of today.

736
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:49,441
When they are s****d,
all they can do is light candles...

737
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:52,540
...at India Gate.

738
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:58,708
So Mr. Unemployed Superman.

739
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:01,111
How are you feeling?

740
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,574
But it's really sad
what happened with you.

741
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:13,145
Monsoon contracted to winter.

742
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:14,571
So cold.

743
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,077
Hey... - What?

744
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:22,480
Without a job...
you will also lose that... - Tina.

745
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,070
You'll lose Tina.

746
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:29,980
Something big is going
to happen in our life.

747
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:32,046
Him...

748
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:33,535
Him.

749
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:38,676
When He gives...
he breaks all limits.

750
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,440
Shall I tell you one thing.

751
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,046
We've lost everything.

752
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,041
Only thing we have is this roof.

753
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:07,474
"Sweetheart,
your eyes duel with mine."

754
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,915
"Your gait invites me."

755
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:20,514
"Stop showing attitude, look at me."

756
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:24,008
"The one you're looking
for is close to you."

757
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:27,240
"My heart on my fire, douse my fire."

758
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,938
"Hot body, red lips."

759
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,171
"When I shake my body,
your hearts sway."

760
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,344
"I'll rip your hearts out."

761
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:13,105
"I am trouble, don't tease me."

762
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,811
"Don't break my heart."

763
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,571
"Don't leave me."

764
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,681
"Don't make my mood sad."

765
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,644
"All night we'll do..."

766
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,013
"All night we'll do..."

767
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:03,940
"Sweetheart,
your eyes duel with mine."

768
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:10,638
"It ignites my heartbeat."

769
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:17,180
"I've a thousand attitudes to show."

770
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,538
"We won't get this
chance to love again."

771
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,771
"Our hearts are open for love."

772
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,974
Sir, bread-fritters.

773
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,772
What the...

774
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:52,510
Asian Olympic Interior's contract
goes to Nahata Constructions.

775
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,976
See...there's a scam under
the bread-fritters as well.

776
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,512
Aids, didn't I tell
you about scams?

777
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,304
Even dead bodies aren't safe.

778
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:01,839
There's too much risk.

779
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:05,673
PP... if you were so
concerned about safety...

780
00:44:05,734 --> 00:44:08,180
...then why did you
become ajournalist?

781
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,706
You could've opened a condom stall.

782
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:10,868
Aids.

783
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,440
Rammed it again.

784
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,112
Are you blind?

785
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,201
You knocked it down again!

786
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,302
Come out!

787
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,368
Oh my...

788
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,610
What...

789
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:26,637
You knocked it down again.
- Sorry. Sorry.

790
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,142
You see, I am still L.
- I got s***d.

791
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,372
Don't worry. Put it on my tab.

792
00:44:34,534 --> 00:44:36,411
You keep breaking and I'll
keep adding. - Hey, India shining.

793
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,846
What happened? - Make me a
cup of tea, Bodyguard special.

794
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,307
Wow, Chhada sir. Maruti 800.

795
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:46,176
What? - Maruti 800.

796
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,974
Call it Maruti 900.

797
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,679
I've made it super-stylish.

798
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,178
Lights, top-class music system.

799
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,904
500 watt speaker.

800
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,204
Can you turn them off? - What?

801
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,638
Speakers?

802
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,804
Can they be turned off?
- What are you saying?

803
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,901
Why not?

804
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:03,135
Hold on.

805
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,178
500 watts are a lot.

806
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,836
Wow, Mr. Chhada.

807
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,177
You see, PP a man has
to act according to his status.

808
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,677
Doesn't look nice if
the Asian Games contractor...

809
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,304
...rides a cheap scooter.

810
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,871
You mean you got the contract
for delivering pots in the games?

811
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,374
Got it?

812
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,338
I've already supplied the pots.

813
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,342
2000 per pot.

814
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,107
2000 per pot?

815
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,406
Didn't I tell you he's
a very honest officer?

816
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,371
Once he gets the
money the job's yours.

817
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,813
Now I want to get a bigger contract.
So I've to pay commission for that.

818
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:41,572
So I've applied for
a loan in the bank.

819
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:42,768
What?

820
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,404
Banks give loan for paying bribe.

821
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:48,006
If we bribe the bank...

822
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:50,173
...then why won't they give
us a loan for paying bribe?

823
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,404
Of course they will.

824
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,107
Come on, let's have tea.

825
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:56,307
PP. scam. -What?

826
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,443
So, Mr. Chhada, what were you saying?

827
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,939
PP, what's he doing?
There he goes again.

828
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,943
Chhada sir, he's only joking.

829
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,638
Oh no, I am late.

830
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:07,735
I am leaving.

831
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:10,280
<i>Hey L“. pay my money-</i>

832
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,079
Money! Money! Money!

833
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:14,042
Will you take it
with you when you die?

834
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,136
You don't have change.

835
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:18,302
That's the problem.

836
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:21,415
PP, please pay him.
I'll settle the accounts later.

837
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:29,335
Am
=1

838
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:30,741
You don't have b***s!

839
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,510
PP, my money.

840
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:40,935
Aids!

841
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:42,935
Aids!

842
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,477
Aids! Listen.

843
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,268
Aids!

844
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,501
Aids! Listen.

845
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,168
Aids!

846
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:54,068
Aids!

847
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:56,111
We'll find other scams.

848
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,271
Forget it, PP.

849
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,102
It's not about scams!

850
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:01,311
We can get a thousand scams...

851
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,004
...from any officer or politician.

852
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:06,243
The dead body was in our car.

853
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,609
But this safe scam
you're looking for...

854
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:10,439
...we'll never find it.

855
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,006
Why are you saying that, Aids?

856
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:14,480
We're not that unlucky. - Luck?

857
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,172
Our luck's already deserted us.

858
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:20,871
I've lost my job because of you.

859
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,006
Soon I'll lose Tina.

860
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:25,138
That's enough, Aids.

861
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,004
You're no Tipu Sultan.

862
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,237
And what do you think...
I am not worried?

863
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:30,468
Didn't I lose my job?

864
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,877
Don't I love Monsoon?

865
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,970
But we're not shooting
some Ginger Ganesh story here.

866
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,769
We're looking for scams.

867
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,875
No, PP. we're not looking for scams.

868
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,341
Scams find us.

869
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,808
And we're playing hide-n-seek.

870
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:48,411
If this goes on,
I'll have to do something...

871
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,568
Alone.

872
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:52,471
What will you do?

873
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:53,443
What will you do?

874
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:55,037
Un-friend me on Facebook.

875
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:56,644
Thinking about leaving your friend.

876
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:58,341
Who do you think you are?

877
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,708
Vacate my uncle's house today.

878
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,747
And then you can sleep with
Tina on the pavement all night.

879
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:04,739
Get lost.

880
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,508
PP! PP!
You're furious!

881
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,714
Don't involve Tina in this.

882
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,801
Don't throw me out of the house.

883
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:11,778
It's all because of my horoscope.

884
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,905
It stated...
my world might tear apart.

885
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,171
PP.

886
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,872
Careful, PP.

887
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,601
Aids!

888
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:28,535
Aids!

889
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,101
Aids!

890
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,944
Run

891
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:29,105
Sherry, you should
mix sand in cement.

892
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,039
Not cement in sand.

893
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,911
I told you nothing should go wrong.

894
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,303
But you hit me with
an entire footbridge.

895
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,574
Relax, Mr. Khwaja.
It's just a footbridge.

896
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,270
And there were no casualties either.

897
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:43,936
Remember Avinash Tripathi.

898
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,181
When we handled a
CBI officer's murder...

899
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,371
...then why are you worrying
about a footbridge?

900
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:51,809
It's not about a footbridge.

901
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,202
It's about my party losing power.

902
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:59,274
Consider that sports complex
interior contract cancelled.

903
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,378
Mr. Khwaja,
that interiors contract...

904
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:06,707
...was worth 200 crores.

905
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:09,379
And your share was 20 crores.

906
00:50:10,434 --> 00:50:12,914
But it can go up to...25.

907
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:16,469
Make it 30 and I'll think about it.

908
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:18,839
3 is my lucky number.

909
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,809
But I won't tolerate
any more carelessness.

910
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,474
After all it's the question
of our country's image.

911
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:25,835
<i>Okay'</i>

912
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:32,573
Ganesh, stop. Come here. -Aids.

913
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,402
Have you seen Monsoon madam?
- Right now I am watching you two.

914
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:35,911
Who are you?
And how did you get in?

915
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,445
Security... - Wait!

916
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:38,170
I am Anand.

917
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,838
Anand lshwaram...
- Aids, what are you doing?

918
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,104
I don't want to hear anything.

919
00:50:41,134 --> 00:50:42,340
I want my job back.

920
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:43,811
I want Tina back. - Sir.

921
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:46,607
First tell me whether
you want Monsoon or Tina?

922
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,202
Shut up, we'll decide that.

923
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:49,438
Just tell us where's Monsoon madam.

924
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,444
She's in the conference room.
- Okay.

925
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:53,369
Excuse me, sir. -Aids.

926
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,137
Security!

927
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,840
Aids, listen to me.

928
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:59,141
Let's check the CD first.
- Chill...buddy.

929
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,873
A blacksmith and his hammer...

930
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:07,540
...and a man on his horse,
should have undoubted faith.

931
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,209
Aids!

932
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:13,372
Monsoon!

933
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,945
Ma'am, we've got it.

934
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,876
Aids? PP? What are you doing here?

935
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,740
L...

936
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:22,304
The footbridge collapsed.
- I know. So?

937
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,173
We shot it...falling down. - Really?

938
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,438
Another scoop?

939
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,910
Just like that body.
- Monsoon, we weren't lying.

940
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,412
We really had that body.
- Just stop it, PP.

941
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:34,535
You're a liar.

942
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,248
Calm down,
we've got another CD. - Okay.

943
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:40,935
Show it.

944
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,939
What are you doing? - Chill, bro.

945
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:50,335
May I?

946
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,568
Thank you.

947
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,268
Enough!

948
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,072
Unbelievable!

949
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:11,135
You guys, enough.

950
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,307
Even... Ganesh can do
a better story than you two.

951
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,601
Thank you, madam.

952
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,147
You two...should run a momo stall.

953
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,410
Get out.

954
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,243
What was the reason for
the footbridge collapse?

955
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,411
According to the reports...

956
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:35,936
...three
reasons are being stated.

957
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,237
First, sonic boom.

958
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,879
A high-frequency sound
and it's vibration...

959
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,411
...made the bridge collapse.

960
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,341
These vibrations are going to make
that rascal's government collapse.

961
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,078
And to discuss this incident...

962
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:51,876
...we have with us an expert
in this field, Mr. Duggal.

963
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,643
So Mr. Duggal, what is your view?

964
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:56,541
Sonic boom.

965
00:52:57,434 --> 00:53:00,938
Sonic boom...works in
a particular radius...

966
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,438
...which is area.

967
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,705
If this footbridge collapsed
due to a sonic boom...

968
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,707
...then the buildings around
would've been affected too.

969
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,609
The boy knows his stuff.

970
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,939
So that means there's a different
reason for the footbridge collapse.

971
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,305
We even have baba
Chutkianand with us today.

972
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:20,476
He's the supreme
disciple of Taali Baba.

973
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,514
It's said that...that
Taali Baba's gravestone...

974
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:25,208
...was displaced in order
to make this footbridge.

975
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:27,012
So Chutkiji, we want to know...

976
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:30,513
...is it Taali baba's curse
that made the footbridge collapse?

977
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:36,277
My Guru never wished anyone ill.

978
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,874
In fact even before he clapped...

979
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:41,804
...he would always see whether...

980
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:45,281
...there are any flies
or mosquitoes in the way?

981
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,109
So Chutkiji, according to you...

982
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:49,577
...Baba has nothing
to do with this incident.

983
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:53,305
But what does she want to prove?

984
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,509
Now there's just one reason left.

985
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:56,635
Design fault.

986
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,711
Was it Nahata Constructions fault?

987
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,437
Let's speak with
well-known engineer...

988
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,012
...Dr. Muljibhai Desai.

989
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:04,803
So Dr. Desai, according to you...

990
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:06,211
...why did the bridge collapse?

991
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:09,676
That footbridge collapsed
because of this screw.

992
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:14,846
One important screw...which
was not fastened properly.

993
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,177
And due to that the
entire bridge collapsed.

994
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,271
You mean it's not the
construction company's fault.

995
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,910
It's human error.
- Absolutely right.

996
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:24,035
<i>Screw?</i>

997
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,945
What the... he's making a fool of us!

998
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:29,435
<i>Screw?</i>

999
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,311
But what evidence do they have?

1000
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,170
We just received news that...

1001
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,540
...Putti Lal from Laltenganj,
Bihar...

1002
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,841
...has been taken in
custody for questioning.

1003
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:40,306
Putti Lal?

1004
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:42,608
Let me go. It's not my fault.

1005
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,340
What the... Putti Lal.

1006
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:47,513
Let me go.
- He looks like a screw himself...

1007
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,343
...and they're blaming
him for that huge...

1008
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:52,377
It's believed that the footbridge
collapsed because of Putti Lal.

1009
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:54,378
She's brilliant.

1010
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,710
She gets to the root of every issue.

1011
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:05,183
Wow, PP. You're such a big loser.

1012
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:09,875
She fired us from our jobs and
you're still twitting about her?

1013
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:13,771
How tweet? - No.

1014
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,876
This is just a misunderstanding.

1015
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,746
And anyway,
this time it's your footage's fault.

1016
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:23,304
Gallop-gallop!

1017
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,178
W
e!
Ci !

1018
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,646
No, PP. - Horse, hammer.

1019
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,774
How can the entire
footage be messed up?

1020
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:34,307
I'll check once again.

1021
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,571
Wow, Sherry.

1022
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,578
You shut everyone up with one screw.

1023
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,179
It should've been Nahata behind
bars for the footbridge mishap...

1024
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:48,642
...but Putti Lal
was arrested instead.

1025
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,477
That's call media management.

1026
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,677
Thank you, Mr. Khwaja.

1027
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,337
That was my job.

1028
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:56,537
I was doing my job.

1029
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,234
I'll see you at the party.

1030
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,745
What happened, Mr. Superman?

1031
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,808
Find anything? - Nothing.

1032
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,374
Hey, stop.

1033
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:11,968
Go back.

1034
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,168
Forward that.

1035
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:15,671
Little more.

1036
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,901
Zoom in.

1037
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:20,134
That's it.

1038
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:23,242
That's Tina's blanket.

1039
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,107
That means someone buried
the corpse in the bridge.

1040
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,543
PP, stop. Stop. Stop.

1041
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:32,280
Hurry up. - I am doing.

1042
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,678
Lift him up.

1043
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:34,735
Hurry UP-

1044
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:39,577
Lift him up.

1045
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,401
Hurry UP-

1046
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,035
Hello. Hello.

1047
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,501
How are you?

1048
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,701
Khwaja sir. - How are you?

1049
00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:53,735
Hello.

1050
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,276
Congratulations, Nahata sir. - Yes.

1051
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:57,368
Hello Khwaja sir.

1052
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:58,605
Putti Lal was arrested.

1053
00:56:58,834 --> 00:57:01,280
Putti Lal was arrested,
but there's a slight problem.

1054
00:57:01,534 --> 00:57:04,674
Avinash Tripathi's
corpse disappeared again.

1055
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,004
What? - Yes.

1056
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,305
Can't you do a single thing right?

1057
00:57:09,734 --> 00:57:11,077
What are you saying, Khwaja sir?

1058
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,612
That corpse was unlucky.

1059
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:13,902
Entire footbridge collapsed.

1060
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:15,606
Don't worry about the corpse.

1061
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:17,269
It's a corpse, how far can it go?

1062
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:17,936
Right?

1063
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,275
We're looking for it.
We'll find it.

1064
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,068
Find it?

1065
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:36,235
This is the right place.

1066
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:40,481
Welcome to Good Time Motel, sir.

1067
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,843
We need a room to freshen up.

1068
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:48,880
These days is it
called freshening up?

1069
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,240
Can we get a double room?
- You'll get everything, sir.

1070
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:02,611
You've your luggage too.

1071
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,041
Why did you have
to bring a blanket?

1072
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,046
It's ourjob to change blankets.

1073
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:20,074
Give it...one double room. - Relax.

1074
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:24,146
I am giving you our best room.

1075
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:27,038
Room no...69.

1076
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,635
What are you doing?

1077
00:58:38,234 --> 00:58:39,611
That manager really thought that...

1078
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,247
...we and this rotting corpse are...

1079
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:46,847
Let go of my Tina's blanket.

1080
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:50,606
Our best room.

1081
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:54,045
Room no. 69.

1082
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:58,642
Did you order anything
from room service? - No.

1083
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:07,839
Careful!

1084
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,011
Aids!

1085
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:20,247
At least tell me now...why
are you so happy today?

1086
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,969
I'll tell you, sweetheart.

1087
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:24,612
He's...

1088
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,943
When Khwaja's party gets over...

1089
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,241
...my feelings get a little hot.
- Ouch!

1090
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:36,137
This is...

1091
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,443
Sorry. - What are you doing, Aids?

1092
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:43,970
Not me, he's doing it.

1093
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:46,475
Now you can give your Monsoon...

1094
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:49,738
...a scam with a sex scandal, free.

1095
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,068
Free.

1096
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:52,535
Free!

1097
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,636
Beautiful.

1098
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,544
We didn't come here to sleep.

1099
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,676
Naughty!

1100
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:03,735
Naughty!

1101
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,035
Come.

1102
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:09,612
Your face tells me that...

1103
01:00:09,634 --> 01:00:11,409
...you've some good news for me.

1104
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,240
Say it.

1105
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:13,371
Mr. Khwaja...

1106
01:00:14,734 --> 01:00:16,873
The tenders have been
leaked from your Ministry.

1107
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,675
For the stadium interiors.

1108
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,176
What?

1109
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,679
Killol has the papers.

1110
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,871
Motwani quoted 10% lower
than Mr. Nahata...

1111
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,540
...yet, Mr. Nahata got the contract.

1112
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,611
Killol wants to propagate
this in a public rally.

1113
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:38,912
There are two things very difficult
to control in this country.

1114
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:42,414
Population and Opposition.

1115
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:46,211
But Khwaja sir,
who can leak the documents?

1116
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,670
Only one man.

1117
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,376
The. . . Sports Secretary.

1118
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,307
Mu rl I Manohar Mahapat ra.

1119
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,913
Aids, stop it now.

1120
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:04,904
What the...

1121
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:06,971
Lift him up.

1122
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:12,805
What are you doing? - Sorry.

1123
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:14,379
I was just getting the CD.

1124
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,801
Slowly.

1125
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,873
What the... - What?

1126
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,376
Where are you going?

1127
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,906
I'll just be back from the toilet,
beautiful.

1128
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,204
Naughty-

1129
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:39,137
Everything okay.

1130
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,579
Mr. Mahapatra.
- Oh, hello. Good evening, sir.

1131
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,179
How much did Killol pay
you to leak Motwani's tender?

1132
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:47,535
What do you mean, sir?

1133
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,113
I know cheap government
officers like you really well.

1134
01:01:51,434 --> 01:01:53,778
Anyone can make you
strip for a few pennies.

1135
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,901
I know that.

1136
01:01:56,467 --> 01:01:58,310
Right, Mr. Khwaja, right.

1137
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,571
Corruption is like a plague!

1138
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:06,010
And often ministers pass
it down to the government officers.

1139
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,472
Oh my god!

1140
01:02:10,234 --> 01:02:12,407
I slapped him because he abused me.

1141
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,110
You can publish that
in your papers tomorrow.

1142
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,201
Now move.

1143
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,801
Oh no!

1144
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:28,407
Stop the car. - Right away.

1145
01:02:28,534 --> 01:02:29,740
Is it election day today?

1146
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:32,002
Everyone's drunk.

1147
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,745
Get down you two.

1148
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,937
We'll have to keep
them away from the car.

1149
01:02:38,234 --> 01:02:39,577
Get out. - Okay.

1150
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,507
Walk slowly, or they'll suspect us.

1151
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:49,845
What happened, sir?
You made us stop the car.

1152
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,109
You stopped it yourself.

1153
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:57,407
Drinking and driving.
- We're drunk?

1154
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:03,174
You think sir's drunk?
- No, sir, we aren't drunk.

1155
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,903
Stop shaking. - We're shaking?

1156
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,068
You think sir's shaking?

1157
01:03:08,134 --> 01:03:09,909
You're speaking too much.

1158
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,712
I told you...
- But I didn't do anything.

1159
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:17,112
Sir, they're on this side. - Where?

1160
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:18,677
They're shaking.

1161
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,401
Move aside.

1162
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:31,738
Who is in the car?

1163
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:35,604
Hey you!

1164
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,647
Did you hear what sir said?

1165
01:03:38,934 --> 01:03:41,005
Sir, he's deaf.

1166
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:44,546
He's deaf, but is he blind too?
- He's blind too.

1167
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:49,480
He can't hear, he can't see.

1168
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:52,074
Is he the government?

1169
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,701
Checking.

1170
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:56,672
We'll check him, son.

1171
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,211
Rakesh. - Sir.

1172
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,906
Let's check. - Yes, sir.

1173
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,741
Sir, wait. - Come out.

1174
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:04,471
Sir, let him go. - Sir!

1175
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,911
Sir, he's stinking.

1176
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,343
He's too drunk.

1177
01:04:12,534 --> 01:04:13,604
Arrest him.

1178
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:14,835
Arrest him.

1179
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,813
He must be drinking and driving.

1180
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:19,709
Sir, how can he drive
from the backseat?

1181
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:20,938
Don't speak too much.

1182
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:23,907
That's not sir's job to think,

1183
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,408
Rakesh. - Right sir.

1184
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,276
Take Lord Hanuman's name
and lift him up. -Yes, sir.

1185
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,601
Get up.

1186
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:32,077
Hail Hanuman, come on.

1187
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:33,971
Drink at home you...

1188
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:36,546
Sir, why do you drink
if you can't digest it?

1189
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:38,340
Sir, he won't do it the next time.

1190
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:40,374
Sir...sir...

1191
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:42,144
Careful. - Sir...

1192
01:04:42,367 --> 01:04:44,813
He can't even stand straight.

1193
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:46,742
Sir, he can't walk either.

1194
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:49,668
Sir...

1195
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:53,477
If it wasn't for the
law-protectors like us...

1196
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,477
...patrolling the streets of Delhi...

1197
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:57,408
...you'll turn the
entire zone unsafe.

1198
01:04:57,534 --> 01:04:58,740
You're right.

1199
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,644
Monsoon will think I am a liar.

1200
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:15,835
Hold on!

1201
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,441
You still have the Killol
and Motwani CD, don't you?

1202
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:20,137
Yes, I do. - Where is it?

1203
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:22,577
In the corpse's pocket.

1204
01:05:27,067 --> 01:05:29,547
Humans make mistake.

1205
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:32,043
So did I. -You did.

1206
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,804
Sir, these are the two...

1207
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,075
...who made the Police proud.

1208
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,338
PP...there's no mention
of a corpse in this.

1209
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:02,342
Those police officers
did take it, but...

1210
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:05,174
lam sure the police
made it disappear.

1211
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,637
They must have received
orders from their superiors and...

1212
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,505
This is a huge scam.

1213
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:17,080
Hello, Mr. Khwaja. - Hello, Sherry.

1214
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:19,005
There's good news.

1215
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:21,807
Avinash Tripathi's
body has been found.

1216
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,680
You've found Avinsh Tripathi's body?

1217
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,806
But how?
- That's classified information.

1218
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:30,575
But yourjob's been done.

1219
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:34,010
My job? - The interiors contract.

1220
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,646
Killol was after us.

1221
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,542
But what connection does
this have for your country?

1222
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:42,473
We've also found
a CD with the corpse.

1223
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,209
And it has deep
connection with Bilal.

1224
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:50,371
You will believe it when you see it.

1225
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,346
And the corpse?
- Don't worry about that.

1226
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,408
This time I've made arrangements...

1227
01:06:57,134 --> 01:06:59,080
...and no one will know
where the corpse disappeared to.

1228
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:07,935
Hello. - Hello.

1229
01:07:08,034 --> 01:07:10,207
Hello.

1230
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:14,544
Brothers and...what the f"'**

1231
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,334
What happened?

1232
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,368
Current.

1233
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,107
The youth today are like current.

1234
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:25,746
If the earthing not
proper then they shock you.

1235
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:29,311
The youth today know
nothing about Ganga...

1236
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:32,738
...but they all know how
to do the Gangnam!

1237
01:07:33,233 --> 01:07:35,645
Everywhere you see...they are
singing and dancing.

1238
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:39,471
Hey. . . rascals,
didn't you hear what sir said?

1239
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:42,571
Stan playing. - Listen...

1240
01:07:56,367 --> 01:08:00,838
"Everyone's become so westernized,
everyone's on Facebook or twitter."

1241
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:03,039
"See the craze of zero figure."

1242
01:08:03,134 --> 01:08:05,307
"I just follow."

1243
01:08:05,534 --> 01:08:07,707
"I just follow."

1244
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,305
"Why don't you jump in the well?"

1245
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:14,540
"I just follow."

1246
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:16,839
"I just follow."

1247
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,070
"I just..."

1248
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,403
"I just..."

1249
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,702
"I just..."

1250
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:31,474
"Wow! Amazing."

1251
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:45,280
"Sons sold their father's land
and bought an Audi."

1252
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:49,838
"From Gurgoan he came to Delhi."

1253
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,407
"What are you saying? Really?" - Yes.

1254
01:08:52,434 --> 01:08:56,814
"Sons sold their father's land
and bought an Audi."

1255
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:01,007
"From Gurgoan he came to Delhi."

1256
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:03,204
"Everyone visits the shopping mall."

1257
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,573
"And buy jockeys in sale."

1258
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,976
"Flat 50%, buy get 1."

1259
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,013
"Everything sells in our country."

1260
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:11,744
"storm"

1261
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,246
"Sing it in English as well."

1262
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:14,846
P!-P!

1263
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,908
H!-H!

1264
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,980
O!-O!

1265
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:52,870
"I just..."

1266
01:10:12,567 --> 01:10:14,444
Hey, PP bro.

1267
01:10:14,834 --> 01:10:16,541
Did you see my new girlfriend?

1268
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,907
She's dark, but she's hot.

1269
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:23,006
5 series LBW. - BMW!

1270
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:25,114
Whether its B or L...

1271
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,770
Oh no...

1272
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:29,344
Rammed it again!

1273
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:30,844
Chhada.

1274
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:33,174
That's the limit.

1275
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:36,248
Even the hockey team doesn't
get knocked down so many times.

1276
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,741
I am sorry. Try to understand.

1277
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,273
Now I am a bigger L.

1278
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:42,505
Great, Chhada.

1279
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:45,707
I know, put it in my account.
- I see.

1280
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:47,973
Hey India Shining,
two Wanted Stuffed breads...

1281
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,340
...with extra butter, parcel.

1282
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:50,912
Okay. - Why are you always smiling?

1283
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,904
Wow, Ch had a.

1284
01:10:53,534 --> 01:10:55,639
People change clothes
and you change cars.

1285
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:57,574
Look, I had predicted earlier...

1286
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,873
...that this Games
will change my life.

1287
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,876
And it did.

1288
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:03,505
And a man should look
according to his status.

1289
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:06,242
Style. - Chhada sir,
here's your Wanted Stuffed bread.

1290
01:11:06,334 --> 01:11:07,335
With extra butter.

1291
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:10,005
That's Rs. 32. - Keep 50.

1292
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,771
I guess you don't have change.

1293
01:11:13,234 --> 01:11:14,372
That's the problem.

1294
01:11:14,467 --> 01:11:16,208
These days I carry big notes.

1295
01:11:16,434 --> 01:11:19,244
PP bro, just pay this fellow.

1296
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:20,438
<i>Okay'</i>

1297
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:21,537
See you, bye.

1298
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:37,437
Are you tired of life? - Yes.

1299
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:42,008
Are you only facing
disappointment? - A lot.

1300
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:46,781
Do you always lose
what you get? - Yes.

1301
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,508
Then come meet Ma Poly.

1302
01:11:55,534 --> 01:11:56,535
Ma Poly?

1303
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,507
Welcome. Sit.

1304
01:12:14,534 --> 01:12:15,535
Bow-wow!

1305
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,912
Ma Poly's...a dog.

1306
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,443
Divine dog!

1307
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:47,982
Aids, will we let a
dog predict our future?

1308
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:52,215
Ma Poly answers only in Yes or No.

1309
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:55,741
So ask your questions accordingly.

1310
01:12:56,234 --> 01:12:58,510
Rs. 500 for each question.

1311
01:13:00,267 --> 01:13:01,712
We'll paY-

1312
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:06,039
Doggy bro,
can we use the camera? - Yes.

1313
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:08,877
2000 extra for that. - Yes.

1314
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:10,002
We'll paY-

1315
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:12,980
You want to record
us getting fooled.

1316
01:13:13,134 --> 01:13:15,307
Ask your question. - Yes.

1317
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:21,175
Ma Poly...will Tina marry me.

1318
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:31,902
Stupid.

1319
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,078
Aids. You're so educated, yet...

1320
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:36,842
Fine, you ask something.
- Forget it.

1321
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:38,035
Come on. Ask...

1322
01:14:38,134 --> 01:14:39,511
What... - Ask.

1323
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:41,240
You always do this
when it's my turn.

1324
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,701
Fine.

1325
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:53,914
Ma Poly, will Bilal Khwaja
kill Avinash Tripathi?

1326
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,678
See?

1327
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:02,112
We were right? - What?

1328
01:15:02,234 --> 01:15:03,872
She says 'Yes' for everything.

1329
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,510
Because you're asking
such questions.

1330
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:09,140
She'll say 'No' only if
you ask that son of a question.

1331
01:15:09,334 --> 01:15:12,110
Test her. - Aids, are you crazy?

1332
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:15,635
Fine.

1333
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:23,047
Ma Poly, the body that
was cremated with honors...

1334
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:24,646
...belonged to Avinash Tripathi?

1335
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:30,874
No!

1336
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,973
Ma Poly, will we expose
the biggest scam...

1337
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,204
...and create a sensation
in the country?

1338
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:44,540
Hail Ma Poly!

1339
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:45,702
Aids!

1340
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:50,980
Send your man and get this CD.

1341
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:54,673
I just want to see Khwaja ruined.

1342
01:15:56,967 --> 01:15:59,880
"My beloved's gone to Rangoon."

1343
01:16:01,334 --> 01:16:04,008
"And called on the telephone."

1344
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:06,840
"That he misses me."

1345
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:09,676
"It makes him restless."

1346
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,680
Khwaja, we'll burn
your Lanka to the ground.

1347
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:18,179
I've the Hanuman's tail.

1348
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:20,910
Mr. Killol, what happened?

1349
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:22,241
What happened?

1350
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:24,777
Not yet, but it will happen now.

1351
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,601
Tap.

1352
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,837
It was being tapped. - Tap?

1353
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,674
Sherry's phone was being tapped.

1354
01:16:32,567 --> 01:16:33,910
Avinash Tripathi was doing it...

1355
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,538
...in order to inquire
about the Games.

1356
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,376
So...Nahata,
Sherry, Khwaja have been exposed.

1357
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:45,104
The buffalo's in the water.

1358
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:47,772
Now it's my turn.

1359
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:49,908
We'll call Nahata's 3G.

1360
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:54,640
Handover my CD,
and we'll handover yours.

1361
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:56,735
Yeah!

1362
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,511
I guess they won't spare us.

1363
01:17:01,634 --> 01:17:03,341
Emails are hacked.

1364
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:04,641
Phones are tapped.

1365
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:07,739
What can a person do? What are we
supposed to do, Khwaja sir?

1366
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,811
There's one thing that we can do.

1367
01:17:09,934 --> 01:17:11,413
We can start sending
pigeons from tomorrow.

1368
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:14,239
Look, Nahata. -Yes.

1369
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,805
You can fly all
the pigeons you like.

1370
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:20,676
But I want that CD at any cost...
- Khwaja sir...

1371
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:22,772
You understand. - Mr. Khwaja.

1372
01:17:23,434 --> 01:17:24,674
You will get it. - But...

1373
01:17:24,734 --> 01:17:25,974
I'll make sure of it.

1374
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:30,272
You come again.

1375
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:34,613
Astrology and fortune
lines can reveal everything.

1376
01:17:34,634 --> 01:17:35,738
Pandit!

1377
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:39,277
I'll be right back.
- But sir, sign?

1378
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:40,439
I am coming.

1379
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:44,673
Hi, PP. Why are you here?

1380
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:48,210
I mean...you're here
for the chant CD. - Yes.

1381
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:50,942
You could've called.

1382
01:17:58,434 --> 01:18:00,038
Stupid fool,
look where you're going.

1383
01:18:00,401 --> 01:18:01,402
Sorry.

1384
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,401
Here.

1385
01:18:07,734 --> 01:18:08,735
Is this the one?

1386
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:11,202
Let's go, Sabu.

1387
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,303
Sir, I've inserted the CD.
- Very good.

1388
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:23,872
Now let's hear...behind
the scenes from our enemies.

1389
01:18:48,601 --> 01:18:50,046
Is this the CD?

1390
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,413
This is an auspicious chant.

1391
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:56,810
You nincompoop!
What have you brought?

1392
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,147
Sir, they gave me this CD.

1393
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:00,972
Tell him.

1394
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:03,845
Rascal...are you lying?

1395
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:06,738
Oh my, God!

1396
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:14,181
I swear, that man gave me this CD.

1397
01:19:14,534 --> 01:19:16,377
These guys are too much.

1398
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:17,877
Keep it inside.

1399
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,038
Keep the gun inside.

1400
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:25,835
Give me some space.

1401
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:47,105
One simple job.

1402
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,771
You can't do one thing right.
- Yes, sir.

1403
01:25:50,134 --> 01:25:51,135
What "yes sir".

1404
01:25:51,201 --> 01:25:52,475
No, sir. -What "no, sir".

1405
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:56,737
You gave the wrong CD.
- No, sir, I checked.

1406
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:59,003
You must have checked
your horoscope.

1407
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:03,007
The CD has some
auspicious...chant playing.

1408
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:09,905
No, sir.

1409
01:26:11,034 --> 01:26:12,809
I never bring my personal
work to the office.

1410
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,811
You... - Don't apologize, sir.

1411
01:26:15,267 --> 01:26:16,337
It won't look nice.

1412
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,706
Due to the planetary positions
lam under the false accusation.

1413
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:21,635
What?

1414
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:23,277
False accusation, sir.

1415
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:24,968
Just get out.

1416
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:31,468
Hello.

1417
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:32,536
I double-checked.

1418
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,180
We gave your men the right CD.
- You mean I am lying.

1419
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,876
If not you then maybe your men.

1420
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:43,075
Look, my men don't lie.

1421
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:46,008
I don't want to argue with you.

1422
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,846
But I took a great
risk to get the CD.

1423
01:26:49,901 --> 01:26:51,812
If it falls in wrong hands...

1424
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:54,606
...then many people
will get in trouble.

1425
01:26:57,867 --> 01:26:59,403
Rascal...

1426
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:03,205
Mr. Killol...what...what happened?

1427
01:27:04,534 --> 01:27:07,845
How many times have I told you
don't eat bananas publicly.

1428
01:27:08,767 --> 01:27:10,007
Rascal...

1429
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:14,613
Listen, if you want
to live then go get the CD.

1430
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:17,811
Otherwise, you'll disappear
just like the CD did.

1431
01:27:30,467 --> 01:27:32,242
Mr. Tiwari. - Fine.

1432
01:27:38,534 --> 01:27:39,069
Hello

1433
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,636
Hello PP.

1434
01:27:40,734 --> 01:27:41,735
Yes, Pandit.

1435
01:27:42,034 --> 01:27:45,538
The CD that you have... -
The one with the auspicious chant?

1436
01:27:45,634 --> 01:27:46,942
No, not that.

1437
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:49,345
Which CD? - What is it?

1438
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:51,168
Where is it?

1439
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:53,768
What?

1440
01:27:53,834 --> 01:27:56,838
Where's the CD? - Where are
you taking me? - Hello.

1441
01:27:57,334 --> 01:27:59,541
Leave me.
- Why did you switch on the TV?

1442
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:01,446
Hello. - Mister,
what are you doing?

1443
01:28:02,634 --> 01:28:04,705
Where's the CD? - Which one?

1444
01:28:04,867 --> 01:28:06,540
Where's the CD?

1445
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:07,941
Hello, Pandit.

1446
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:09,377
Where's the CD?

1447
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,379
P...P... - You want to pee?

1448
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,344
No...PP... -What PP?

1449
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:16,345
Who's PP?

1450
01:28:16,367 --> 01:28:18,506
Give me his address
or I'll kill you.

1451
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:19,511
No, no, Pandit.

1452
01:28:19,534 --> 01:28:20,535
Prantab Pratap.

1453
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:22,739
Prantab Pratap.

1454
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,938
Pandit, don't say anything.

1455
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,013
The planets and stars
are not in his favor.

1456
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,836
He's going through a bad phase.

1457
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:31,848
Hey. We're not here
to fix his marriage.

1458
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,736
We want to break his legs.
Give us the address.

1459
01:28:33,834 --> 01:28:35,905
Let me down and I'll tell you.

1460
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,946
Here, stand up him.

1461
01:28:38,734 --> 01:28:40,372
Freedom Fighter Society.

1462
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:49,668
Hello.

1463
01:28:49,734 --> 01:28:51,270
Sir. - Yes.

1464
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:53,344
We've found the CD.
- You found the CD?

1465
01:28:53,467 --> 01:28:54,275
They found the CD?

1466
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,108
They found the CD?

1467
01:28:55,134 --> 01:28:56,135
They found the CD?

1468
01:28:57,134 --> 01:28:57,771
Who has it?

1469
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:59,040
What happened?

1470
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:01,944
Someone's coming to kill me.

1471
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:04,340
What? Why?

1472
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:07,473
They want the CD. - CD?

1473
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,944
Yes. What CD? - Maha...

1474
01:29:11,434 --> 01:29:12,742
<i>Mahamrityunjay Jaap CD'?</i>

1475
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:15,836
I don't get it.

1476
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:23,247
PP...my brother.
We have arrived, PP.

1477
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,641
Journalists are killed
only for one reason.

1478
01:29:26,834 --> 01:29:29,144
To conceal a big scam.

1479
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,471
Scam?

1480
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:35,945
But we don't have any scam.

1481
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:39,378
PP...we've Ma.

1482
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:42,375
Ma Poly and her CD.

1483
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,401
Monsoon!

1484
01:29:48,067 --> 01:29:49,603
Put it on speaker.

1485
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:52,004
Hello.

1486
01:29:52,034 --> 01:29:54,105
PP...your life's in danger.

1487
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:55,668
What?

1488
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:58,980
Do you have the CD? - Which CD?

1489
01:29:59,767 --> 01:30:01,576
You know which CD
I am talking about?

1490
01:30:01,767 --> 01:30:03,075
The one about the scam.

1491
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:05,513
But how do you know about the CD?

1492
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,180
Stop asking foolish questions
I run a news channel.

1493
01:30:08,267 --> 01:30:09,769
And this is a bloody big story.

1494
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:12,940
Didn't I tell you?

1495
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:14,701
Aids.

1496
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,004
Look, I am ready to
give you two anything...

1497
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:18,809
Yes, ma'am, we want our jobs back.

1498
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,707
We finally found a big scam for you.

1499
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:23,407
Now we get our jobs back, right?
- Yes, of course.

1500
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,814
But listen, Aids, PP.

1501
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:28,269
Your lives are in danger.

1502
01:30:28,434 --> 01:30:31,005
Get to the office right now.
- Yes, ma'am, we're coming.

1503
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:32,169
Okay Monsoon.

1504
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:35,272
And PP...you're not a liar.

1505
01:30:36,334 --> 01:30:37,870
I should've believed you.

1506
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,438
I'll see you in the office.

1507
01:30:44,134 --> 01:30:45,340
Its okay, Monsoon.

1508
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,272
It's normal amongst couples.

1509
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,873
We'll be famous.
Hail Ma Poly.

1510
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:52,968
Stop.

1511
01:30:53,301 --> 01:30:54,336
Do you stay here? - Yes.

1512
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:55,675
Do you know PP? - No, we don't.

1513
01:30:55,767 --> 01:30:58,077
PP...listen.

1514
01:30:58,167 --> 01:30:58,668
Listen.

1515
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,111
The scam that happened
in this society...

1516
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,201
He's PP...

1517
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:03,003
That rascal's playing a game.

1518
01:31:03,134 --> 01:31:04,670
He's with us.

1519
01:31:05,067 --> 01:31:06,478
Don't let him die.

1520
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:10,771
How did you get in the middle?

1521
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:11,843
Where are the boys?

1522
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:13,608
Let's go. Let's go.

1523
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:14,768
Oh, God!

1524
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,338
I'll vacate the house.

1525
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:27,175
Sorry. - It's okay.

1526
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:28,668
Follow me.

1527
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:32,838
PP... lower your hands.

1528
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:35,002
Have you brought the CD?

1529
01:31:35,567 --> 01:31:36,773
CD? - Yes.

1530
01:31:41,667 --> 01:31:43,613
Here's the sensational CD...

1531
01:31:43,734 --> 01:31:46,476
...which is going
to expose everyone.

1532
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,548
And this was possible
only because of you, Monsoon.

1533
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:50,544
What do you mean?

1534
01:31:50,567 --> 01:31:52,604
I mean you motivated us.

1535
01:31:52,767 --> 01:31:54,178
Goals...

1536
01:31:55,934 --> 01:31:57,208
You set goals for us.

1537
01:31:58,467 --> 01:31:59,468
Oh no!

1538
01:32:00,067 --> 01:32:01,546
They are very dangerous.

1539
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:03,569
It's not safe for us.
- Tell me where they are.

1540
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:06,142
Don't worry, Monsoon.

1541
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:09,271
No one can touch you
as long as I am here.

1542
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,275
Madam's left.

1543
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:13,142
Do you still want
to deal with them?

1544
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:14,103
What?

1545
01:32:14,134 --> 01:32:15,135
Yes.

1546
01:32:17,267 --> 01:32:18,507
Are you crazy?

1547
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,280
Who is it? - Hurry up.

1548
01:32:22,934 --> 01:32:24,709
Run. Run. -Aids. Come on.

1549
01:32:24,867 --> 01:32:26,505
Let's go. - Wait.

1550
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,371
Come on, get in the car.

1551
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:31,205
Get in the car. - Hurry up, get in.

1552
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,801
Sit.

1553
01:32:36,934 --> 01:32:38,743
Why's mom calling?

1554
01:32:38,834 --> 01:32:40,677
Forget the phone, drive now.

1555
01:32:41,667 --> 01:32:42,611
Hello, mom.

1556
01:32:42,634 --> 01:32:46,411
I'll call you later...
- Everything will be over later.

1557
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:50,938
Sheila... is breathing her last.

1558
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:56,039
Why didn't you send the Chant CD?

1559
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,511
Mom, I've the CD but...
- What did you say?

1560
01:32:58,634 --> 01:32:59,237
You have it.

1561
01:32:59,267 --> 01:33:02,043
Then play it now. - Hurry up.

1562
01:33:02,134 --> 01:33:05,809
But, mom, my life...
- For the sake of my life...

1563
01:33:05,934 --> 01:33:07,845
...play the CD. - Mother...

1564
01:33:07,867 --> 01:33:10,404
Save Sheila...
- Fine, I am playing it.

1565
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:13,375
Yes, sir. We found the CD.

1566
01:33:14,034 --> 01:33:15,104
We're checking it.

1567
01:33:15,767 --> 01:33:16,768
Yes.

1568
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,643
Sabu. Play the CD. - Yes.

1569
01:33:23,934 --> 01:33:27,882
Monsoon, we'll have to manage
the footbridge collapse story.

1570
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:31,514
It's a big story, Sherry.
Won't be easy.

1571
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,171
Come on, Monsoon.

1572
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,241
You managed the story
of a CBI officer's murder.

1573
01:33:37,834 --> 01:33:39,006
That was different.

1574
01:33:39,234 --> 01:33:40,770
Those idiots brought
the corpse to me...

1575
01:33:40,867 --> 01:33:42,244
...and it was easy
to take care of it.

1576
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:44,044
They came back again today.

1577
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:46,205
She stood up.

1578
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:48,574
It's a miracle.

1579
01:33:48,767 --> 01:33:50,678
Mom, this isn't...

1580
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:53,771
This is the wrong CD, mom.

1581
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:57,370
But Pantu, there was
something on this CD...

1582
01:33:57,567 --> 01:34:00,446
...that Sheila stood up.

1583
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,444
Bless your CD.

1584
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:03,841
Bless you, son.

1585
01:34:04,534 --> 01:34:05,535
Bye, mom.

1586
01:34:08,667 --> 01:34:11,546
What nonsense is this? - Yes.

1587
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:15,042
The rascals are playing "Who
will be a millionaire" with a dog.

1588
01:34:15,134 --> 01:34:16,272
Is this the CD?

1589
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,877
Rascal...

1590
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,244
They haven't gone too far.
I'll catch them.

1591
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,638
Get some cold water.

1592
01:34:21,667 --> 01:34:23,669
If PP escapes... then I...

1593
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,675
I'll catch him if you hang up.

1594
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,208
Rascal...

1595
01:34:35,434 --> 01:34:37,778
This idiot has cost
me so many phones.

1596
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,679
Hurry up, PP. hurry up.

1597
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:43,804
Come on,
they wouldn't have gone far.

1598
01:34:44,734 --> 01:34:45,906
Hurry UP-

1599
01:34:46,067 --> 01:34:47,546
There they are.

1600
01:34:49,567 --> 01:34:51,808
Run PP. - They're shooting at us.

1601
01:34:54,934 --> 01:34:55,935
Stop.

1602
01:34:56,367 --> 01:34:57,368
Stop.

1603
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:01,368
There they are.

1604
01:35:04,067 --> 01:35:05,068
Hurry up!

1605
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:21,173
MY Pizza.

1606
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:25,671
What are you doing?

1607
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,901
Oh no.

1608
01:35:32,667 --> 01:35:33,805
Stop.

1609
01:35:40,934 --> 01:35:41,935
Hurry UP-

1610
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,143
I'm
just coming down.

1611
01:35:46,434 --> 01:35:47,811
What the hell.

1612
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,001
Hey fatso!

1613
01:36:09,067 --> 01:36:10,068
Come on.

1614
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:23,637
PP, careful with the bag.
It has the CD.

1615
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:25,612
The CD isn't in the bag,
it's with you.

1616
01:36:25,767 --> 01:36:28,611
You put it in the player. - I did.

1617
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:30,335
But I didn't take it out.

1618
01:36:30,401 --> 01:36:31,402
What?

1619
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,635
What now?

1620
01:36:35,067 --> 01:36:36,705
No one will believe us
that we don't have the CD.

1621
01:36:36,767 --> 01:36:39,338
I guess some terrorist
is writing our fate.

1622
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:43,037
Look there.

1623
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:44,168
Look there.

1624
01:36:56,434 --> 01:36:58,311
Find them, they must
be hiding somewhere around.

1625
01:36:59,601 --> 01:37:00,602
Come.

1626
01:37:48,467 --> 01:37:49,775
Aids!

1627
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:54,269
Get up, PP.

1628
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:00,668
Catch them.

1629
01:38:12,534 --> 01:38:13,535
PP, run!

1630
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,401
Enough, Aids!

1631
01:38:17,467 --> 01:38:18,502
That's enough.

1632
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:20,244
We're done with running.

1633
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:22,608
Now we'll take them down.

1634
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,907
I have an idea.

1635
01:38:28,434 --> 01:38:29,640
But I need some time.

1636
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,145
I'll divert their
attention towards me.

1637
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:32,475
But what will you do?

1638
01:38:33,267 --> 01:38:36,612
When I get mad I get very bad.

1639
01:38:36,967 --> 01:38:38,446
What are you doing?

1640
01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:51,102
Look.

1641
01:39:42,567 --> 01:39:47,277
PP, if you want to save
your friend, then come out.

1642
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,271
Shoot him. -Yes.

1643
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,334
Wait!

1644
01:39:56,634 --> 01:39:58,079
See... - There.

1645
01:40:11,034 --> 01:40:12,570
Where's the CD, PP?

1646
01:40:12,734 --> 01:40:15,806
Monsoon, you're one deadly virus.
- Oh god.

1647
01:40:16,534 --> 01:40:17,638
You corrupted the entire system.

1648
01:40:17,767 --> 01:40:18,802
Oh just shut up.

1649
01:40:18,934 --> 01:40:20,345
You're a bunch of
idiots like my viewers.

1650
01:40:20,367 --> 01:40:21,778
You believe everything I say.

1651
01:40:21,934 --> 01:40:24,210
They aren't idiots,
in fact you're a liar.

1652
01:40:24,467 --> 01:40:25,673
You're a bloody liar.

1653
01:40:25,834 --> 01:40:28,007
And they believe the media,
not you.

1654
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,339
They believe that when
everyone else deceives them...

1655
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:31,869
...then the media
will support them.

1656
01:40:32,034 --> 01:40:32,944
Tell them the truth.

1657
01:40:32,967 --> 01:40:35,379
Enough discussion, hand over the CD.

1658
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,343
We don't have the CD.

1659
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,239
He won't give it so easily.
Give me the gun. - Here.

1660
01:40:43,734 --> 01:40:44,735
Do you have it or not?

1661
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:48,174
Rascal...

1662
01:40:49,534 --> 01:40:52,310
If you kill the boy
how will you get the CD?

1663
01:40:54,367 --> 01:40:56,404
Son, don't anyone fire.

1664
01:40:56,767 --> 01:40:58,974
Or I'll flatten him in a minute.

1665
01:40:59,301 --> 01:41:01,303
Hello, Sherry. - Lower your gun.

1666
01:41:01,367 --> 01:41:02,368
Come on.

1667
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,537
Killol, this isn't the
time to fight amongst ourselves.

1668
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:06,007
I am fighting.

1669
01:41:06,467 --> 01:41:07,775
I've been always saying.

1670
01:41:08,067 --> 01:41:10,570
You keep my CD and I'll keep yours.

1671
01:41:10,934 --> 01:41:11,935
Fine?

1672
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:14,735
Fine.

1673
01:41:15,167 --> 01:41:16,703
Lower your gun.

1674
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:18,339
We've compromised.

1675
01:41:20,267 --> 01:41:21,473
Lower your guns.

1676
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,502
Look PP, don't be scared.

1677
01:41:27,001 --> 01:41:28,378
Give me the CD.

1678
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,376
We don't have the CD.

1679
01:41:31,934 --> 01:41:33,538
You want to shoot us, don't you?
Go ahead.

1680
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,446
At least the country
will know your truth.

1681
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,711
Will you tell them our truth?

1682
01:41:43,867 --> 01:41:45,039
But who will listen?

1683
01:41:45,867 --> 01:41:48,211
In this country,
until someone doesn't lose a kin...

1684
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:50,681
...people don't even
care about the Tsunami.

1685
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:53,871
We killed the CBI inspector.

1686
01:41:55,934 --> 01:41:57,072
You're nothing.

1687
01:41:57,967 --> 01:41:58,968
Yes.

1688
01:42:00,534 --> 01:42:01,638
You're right, sir.

1689
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:05,177
We're nothing.

1690
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:09,077
Scams, frauds, loot.

1691
01:42:10,534 --> 01:42:12,172
You did everything you wanted.

1692
01:42:12,567 --> 01:42:15,571
And we kept quiet because
we believed we're nothing.

1693
01:42:18,534 --> 01:42:20,138
What have you done to the country?

1694
01:42:21,367 --> 01:42:23,472
If someday there's no news
about a scam in the papers...

1695
01:42:23,601 --> 01:42:25,740
...it feels like
we're missing a page.

1696
01:42:28,334 --> 01:42:31,247
These days you inaugurate
scams... by cutting a ribbon.

1697
01:42:35,334 --> 01:42:36,404
Calm down, let me hear.

1698
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:37,872
Non-violence.

1699
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,140
Gandhiji tried to teach us a lot.

1700
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,341
But if he had seen you people...

1701
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:45,109
...then I swear he
would've raised his stick.

1702
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,802
They should be killed.

1703
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,610
You guys scam with fodders.

1704
01:42:50,734 --> 01:42:53,044
Take a share in the
coffins of soldiers.

1705
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,040
Shame on you.

1706
01:42:55,667 --> 01:43:00,013
Your motto is...
Sell a farmer, kill a soldier.

1707
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:01,704
They left nothing.

1708
01:43:02,067 --> 01:43:03,603
They even finished our hopes.

1709
01:43:03,701 --> 01:43:05,305
People go to vote
after every 5 years...

1710
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:07,176
...but they know
nothing's going to change.

1711
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,104
Sir, the flag of our
country still stands tall.

1712
01:43:12,234 --> 01:43:14,407
But we've lost hope
in those who wield it.

1713
01:43:15,867 --> 01:43:16,902
But enough.

1714
01:43:17,234 --> 01:43:19,009
Enough keeping quiet,
enough running.

1715
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,676
Not anymore.
Now it's time to speak.

1716
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,402
To take our country back.

1717
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:27,044
From politicians,
greedy industrialist and media.

1718
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:32,840
Enough fixing,
but we won't lose this match.

1719
01:43:33,534 --> 01:43:34,808
But we aren't alone.

1720
01:43:35,067 --> 01:43:37,946
100 crore Indians
are with us today.

1721
01:43:38,167 --> 01:43:39,771
We'll pee you away.

1722
01:43:39,934 --> 01:43:41,174
Wow, clap everyone.

1723
01:43:41,267 --> 01:43:43,645
You two speak so well.

1724
01:43:44,867 --> 01:43:46,676
You could've been successful
politicians, but...

1725
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:48,872
...unfortunately you
won't live for very long.

1726
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:51,041
Wow, K hwaj a.

1727
01:43:52,001 --> 01:43:54,607
For the first time you've
said something right.

1728
01:43:55,234 --> 01:43:57,339
I'll make my coalition
government with you, deal.

1729
01:43:57,434 --> 01:43:58,640
Wow.

1730
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,638
Let's first kill them. - Of course.

1731
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:02,171
Stan counting, boys.

1732
01:44:11,867 --> 01:44:13,471
What the... Who's that?

1733
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,601
Police?

1734
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,874
Come on hurry up.

1735
01:44:18,034 --> 01:44:19,672
Maybe they saw
television broadcast.

1736
01:44:19,934 --> 01:44:21,880
This is being telecasted
live for a long time.

1737
01:44:21,934 --> 01:44:22,844
What rubbish?

1738
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,777
Not rubbish, Monsoon, it's true.

1739
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:26,139
Mobile streaming.

1740
01:44:26,667 --> 01:44:29,341
Connected with the
OB van parked outside.

1741
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,775
Thanks for your help, Chhada sir.

1742
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,837
Anytime for you, PP.

1743
01:44:42,334 --> 01:44:43,904
Hey sit!

1744
01:44:45,267 --> 01:44:47,008
We've been exposed, Nahata sir.

1745
01:44:47,267 --> 01:44:48,507
We're stripped.

1746
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,741
Yeah.

1747
01:44:54,867 --> 01:44:56,471
You've been exposed...

1748
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,601
Tell us...

1749
01:44:57,801 --> 01:44:58,802
Sir...

1750
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:01,177
Well done, boys. Well done.

1751
01:45:02,467 --> 01:45:05,277
I swear... illegal
money never prospers.

1752
01:45:05,767 --> 01:45:07,804
Rascal, keep away.

1753
01:45:14,734 --> 01:45:16,304
Sir, what do you have to say?

1754
01:45:35,534 --> 01:45:37,036
Salute to you.

1755
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:42,411
We're famous!

1756
01:45:42,867 --> 01:45:45,677
And we can take the credit as well.

1757
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,610
"Wear your fun glasses."

1758
01:46:19,734 --> 01:46:22,112
"Spit the chewing gum of sorrow."

1759
01:46:22,134 --> 01:46:24,341
"Sell all your tensions away."

1760
01:46:24,467 --> 01:46:26,640
"Blow up the balloons
of celebrations."

1761
01:46:26,734 --> 01:46:29,146
"We'll drive all the worries away."

1762
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,373
"Get in the mood of having some fun."

1763
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,676
"Your style's number one."

1764
01:46:33,734 --> 01:46:36,078
"Let people be jealous."

1765
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:38,477
"Open your eyes wide
and watch the fun, say."

1766
01:46:38,567 --> 01:46:43,209
"Oh no!"

1767
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:45,507
"Oh no!"

1768
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:47,738
"Open your eyes wide
and watch the fun, say."

1769
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:52,416
"Oh no!"

1770
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:54,941
"Oh no!"

1771
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:57,412
"Open your eyes wide
and watch the fun, say."

1772
01:46:57,501 --> 01:46:59,538
"Oh no!"

1773
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:02,011
"Oh no!"

1774
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,205
"Oh no!"

1775
01:47:04,401 --> 01:47:06,745
"Open your eyes wide
and watch the fun, say."

1776
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,780
"Oh no!"

1777
01:47:09,134 --> 01:47:11,114
"Oh no!"

1778
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:13,544
"Oh no!"

1779
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:15,836
"Open your eyes wide
and watch the fun, say."

1780
01:47:30,334 --> 01:47:32,575
"Let's sc**** everyone."

1781
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,907
"Let's solve this matter
in any way we can."

1782
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,173
Hey! You know I gotta
tell you something...

1783
01:47:37,301 --> 01:47:39,872
"You can do what you like,
I am your boss."

1784
01:47:39,967 --> 01:47:42,277
"Breaking news."

1785
01:47:42,334 --> 01:47:44,280
"Breaking news."

1786
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:48,740
"Two crazy boys have gone restless."

1787
01:47:49,367 --> 01:47:51,643
"They've opened the
window of mischief."

1788
01:47:51,734 --> 01:47:53,680
