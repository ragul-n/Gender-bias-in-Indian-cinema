{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,800
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,766
Turgut!

5
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,233
The boy is dead.

6
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,233
Yigit Alp!

7
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,733
Let them go or I will kill you all.

8
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,233
Do you think we are stupid?
Get out of our way.

9
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,766
I thought I made myself clear. You either
let them go or I will kill you all.

10
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,266
I won’t. Get out of the way or
I will kill the girl.

11
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,500
This is my last warning! Let them go!

12
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,866
Yigit Alp. Yigit Alp!

13
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,766
Who are you?

14
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,033
Afsin.

15
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,233
And I am Deli.

16
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,166
Look at the scholar.

17
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,500
He fights well.

18
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,100
He may be a scholar but he is on fire!

19
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,400
My brother...

20
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,433
...how is your wound?

21
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,933
The tip is broken inside.
We should take it out immediately.

22
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,866
We cannot do it here. We should leave.
Others might come as well.

23
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The arrow stops the blood.
We will cut it somewhere else.

24
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is all Karatoygar’s doing.

25
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:48,933
Let’s go.

26
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,100
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN.

27
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,766
You messed it all up!

28
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:00,366
First your knights...

29
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,400
...then my soldiers.

30
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,233
He killed them all like mosquitoes.

31
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,900
You and I made a very big mistake
by underestimating Ertugrul.

32
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,233
From now on never...

33
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,133
...never try to command me.
I will settle this issue my own way.

34
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,866
Not on my territory, Titus.

35
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:27,733
If Sultan Aladdin hears about it,
our plan would be ruined.

36
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:33,466
You said that you would settle this issue
and I obliged. But you messed up.

37
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:38,100
You let Ertugrul escape!
I will settle it my own way!

38
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,900
My door is always open for you, Titus.
But...

39
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:51,133
...I am saying it again,
if you go on a headhunt in my territory...

40
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,833
...you will lose your own heads.

41
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,833
What about in Aleppo?

42
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:07,133
What did you think? We have more skillful
servants than you in all the Muslim world.

43
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:09,900
And know this, Karatoygar...

44
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:14,766
...if you were not Ustad-i Azam’s dog,
I would have killed you long ago.

45
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,366
Look at the great Gundogdu.

46
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,766
Yes, you see, Selcan Hatun...

47
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,166
...they tame Gundogdu like this,
so you know.

48
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,466
You don’t get angry, you don’t build up
a rage, what is wrong with you, Gundogdu?

49
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,733
I am only waiting for
the right time, Hatun.

50
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,766
Thank God. Thank you as well.

51
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,300
May it be healthy.

52
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,433
What is on your mind?
Will you refrain from tell me as well?

53
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,833
Hatun, I was wronged when I was right.

54
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,933
Look, I also got punished for it as well.

55
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,333
I cannot digest this, Hatun.
When the time comes...

56
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,966
...the whole tribe will see
who Gundogdu is.

57
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,233
Don’t let your fury cloud
your judgment, please.

58
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:11,500
Selcan, winter is around the corner.
It is knocking on our door.

59
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:14,033
Karatoygar made his first move.

60
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,066
Won’t they say that Kayi could not even
protect their guests?

61
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,733
Won’t they? If it wasn’t for the trader’s
man, the guests would have been kidnapped.

62
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,000
-Do you know what this means?
-What does it mean, Gundogdu?

63
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,366
It means this tribe is not led.
It does not have a Bey, it has no one.

64
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,000
What will happen then?

65
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,866
If I am keeping quiet, if I am not tearing
everything apart, there is a reason.

66
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,333
Now I have to be patient.

67
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,866
Now let me work.

68
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,200
I told you to increase the security.
What did you do? Nothing.

69
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:04,433
Because of your incompetence,
the men of that dog infiltrated our camp.

70
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,966
My honor and the tribe’s honor
was violated.

71
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,933
-I took all measures for maximum security.
-Then how could they get in?

72
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,333
How?

73
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,866
They could not have done it
without help from inside, Bey.

74
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,066
What does this mean?

75
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,400
Is something like this possible, Kurdoglu?

76
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,733
There is no one in our tribe
who would stoop so low, Bey.

77
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:28,700
Your head of guard
is struggling to save himself.

78
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,133
He is so belittled that
he can’t even hear his own words.

79
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,299
You are not my head of guard anymore.
Gather all the guards on duty yesterday...

80
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,299
...and wait for my decision
on your punishment.

81
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,233
As you wish, Bey.

82
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:54,733
If Karatoygar has the nerve to raid
my tribe to kidnap our guests...

83
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:58,100
...I don’t know
what he would dare tomorrow.

84
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:04,400
Bey, give me permission to go
and talk with him once again.

85
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,833
What did you achieve last time?
He made a fool of you.

86
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,433
You still ask to go and talk with him.

87
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,133
He learned his lesson, Bey.
All the men he sent was killed.

88
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,233
Now, I can talk in a language
he can understand.

89
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:23,033
I know the language he would understand.

90
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:27,033
Load the bodies to horses
and send back to him.

91
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,100
From now on, we will talk the way
he would understand.

92
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,833
Bey, what can we do against
the great Seljuk army?

93
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,700
Don’t talk like the army is here,
Kurdoglu. It would take days for...

94
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,066
...Karatoygar to mobilize the army
in Erzincan and bring it here.

95
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:47,900
Anyhow, if Karatoygar didn’t have a hidden
agenda, he would have acted long ago.

96
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,066
He is violating the agreement I did
with the Sultan and acting on his own.

97
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:55,866
Actually, as a commander he has enough
experience to know that I would crush...

98
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,466
...his few hundred soldiers.

99
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,133
Then what?

100
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,300
The rest is up to Ertugrul’s success.

101
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,200
One way or another,
whatever our customs say shall prevail.

102
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,266
What will happen now, Akcakoca?

103
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,933
This will take away the pus of the wound.

104
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,000
It will enable him to recover quickly.

105
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,433
-Take this.
-If God permits. How is he?

106
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,900
This was not welcome before
he recovered fully but...

107
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,233
...there is no need to be afraid.
Do not worry.

108
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,433
The healing process will be delayed
for a few days, that’s all.

109
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:39,066
When you feel better, you should get up,
walk around a bit outside...

110
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,066
...it would do you good, alright?

111
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,700
Do not neglect to smear this ointment
on the wound three times a day.

112
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:54,166
-Thank you very much, Akcakoca.
-Alright, may God be on your side.

113
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,900
Thank you, Akcakoca.

114
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,066
Please do not try to get up.
I just came to wish you a speedy recovery.

115
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:13,300
Take these and feed your father well
so that he can get well quickly.

116
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:17,433
-I owe you not one, but three lives.
-There is no debt.

117
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,900
If you could grant me your name,
I would know the man I am thankful to.

118
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,866
Come close, young boy.

119
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:41,300
-What is this?
-This necklace belongs to your family.

120
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,800
To the Seljuk dynasty.

121
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,500
-Dogan, Bamsi, help him down.
-At once, Bey.

122
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,966
Come on, let us go.

123
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,800
My arm.

124
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:44,866
My arm is bleeding.

125
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,133
Dogan, Bamsi, fetch some wood.

126
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,866
Drink this.

127
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,800
He lost a lot of blood.

128
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:07,233
-Come on, brother, raise your head.
-Raise your head.

129
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,066
Ertugrul.

130
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,900
-What happened, son?
-We were attacked.

131
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:48,866
Didn’t I warn you to be careful and
say that the air is hazy around here.

132
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,166
Dervish, bring the saddlebag.

133
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,800
We need to stop the bleeding immediately.

134
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Part of the arrow is inside,
we need to take it out first.

135
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:05,466
We can manage, with God’s help.

136
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Who are they?

137
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,800
Be strong, my friend.

138
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,000
In the name of God. Come on.

139
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:59,900
-Hopefully he will live.
-Bamsi, don’t open your foreboding mouth.

140
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,366
Do not worry.
Fate protects a person from death.

141
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,233
I served under your little brother
Melik Rukneddin.

142
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,233
And my name is Semseddin Afsin Bey.

143
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,166
Your brother died in my arms.
The necklace belonged to him.

144
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,766
-You are Afsin Bey.
-That is correct, Shahzade.

145
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:32,133
I heard your name before.
You were a good commander.

146
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:36,700
-Thank you.
-But, how do I know that you are him?

147
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,400
That this is not a play
staged by Sultan Aladdin?

148
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,033
Afsin Bey,
why did you risk your life for us?

149
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,366
Your brother was my Shahzade.
But more importantly...

150
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,033
...your attitude toward Sultan Aladdin.

151
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,266
You did not engage in a power struggle.
You stayed loyal to the state.

152
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,100
You refrained from making moves
that would overshadow his successes.

153
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:05,100
You didn’t cast a shadow over Seljuk’s
bright days with an ambition of power.

154
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,700
That is why you deserve
the utmost respect, sir.

155
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:13,466
With your permission, I would like to
help you escape from Karatoygar.

156
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:17,433
How? It is obvious that someone
helped Karatoygar to get in.

157
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,966
Otherwise, they could not have
entered the camp so easily.

158
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:25,500
I don’t know who but
I know what he will do next.

159
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,033
Halime?

160
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,466
Than God. My God give you inner peace.

161
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,200
-Thank you, my girl.
-Please, sit.

162
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:41,200
I should not bother you, sir.
You should rest.

163
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:45,000
With your permission,
I will take Halime from you for a while.

164
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,733
Mother Hayme is worried about you,
she would like to ask her how you are.

165
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:51,400
Of course. The permission is yours.

166
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,266
Why did Mother Hayme
want to see me, Aykiz?

167
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:15,800
I really don’t know either.
But you don’t need to be cautious, Halime.

168
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:22,833
They are being punished
because of us, right?

169
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,800
They deserved the punishment they get.

170
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,766
Bey’s honor is our honor as well.

171
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,700
Come on now.

172
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,066
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS.
TEMPLARS CASTLE.

173
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,100
The Muslims we killed
stirred up emotions as expected.

174
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,333
The whole Muslim world is in rage.

175
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:52,066
They will start attacking
the Christians soon.

176
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,200
Europe cannot sit back then.

177
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:58,200
Ustad-i Azam,
what will we do when they attack us?

178
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:00,966
We have limited number of
knights and soldiers.

179
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,300
We will attack them as well.

180
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:08,800
I forged up such an army, which no army
will be able to stand against.

181
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,233
From Palestine to Basra,
from Baghdad to Aleppo...

182
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:17,366
...everywhere will be covered
by the stench of burnt bodies.

183
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,266
The visitors you had been expecting
have arrived, sir.

184
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:33,266
Good.

185
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:37,466
Come now.
Let me show you my invincible army.

186
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,466
Son of a Bey should be like this.

187
00:31:58,866 --> 00:31:59,933
Hamza.

188
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:05,000
I am paying the price of
being presumptuous, uncle. That is all.

189
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,133
-Good for you, my nephew.
-The ambush last night...

190
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,133
It was obvious that Karatoygar
would not back down.

191
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:23,333
Did you know about
the ambush beforehand, uncle?

192
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:32,700
Thank God we have a Bey’s son whom,
for his father, even suspects his uncle.

193
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:37,000
Moreover, he questions him while
looking into his eyes.

194
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,933
Our Bey has the same suspicions.

195
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:46,033
Our guests must be more precious
than we thought.

196
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,333
Come to my tent in the evening,
we will talk there.

197
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,866
We need to get rid of this problem before
trouble surrounds us from all sides.

198
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:20,833
May it be easy on you, Mother Hayme.
Do we have permission?

199
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,900
You do, my girl, you do. Come in.

200
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,333
Come and sit, my beautiful girls.

201
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:40,966
I am sorry for what happened.
Thank God no one was killed.

202
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:45,333
Thank God, Mother Hayme.
My father’s wound was uncalled for...

203
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,400
...while he was recovering
but thank God he was spared.

204
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:53,833
But why are these devil mongers
imposing you?

205
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:59,266
My father is a trader, when he was
transporting goods in the Mediterranean...

206
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,700
...we fell captive to the Crusaders.
They wanted to sell us to Karatoygar.

207
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,700
When you are dwelled in so much trouble,
don’t you have anyone to turn to?

208
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,833
Which tribe do you belong to?

209
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:22,200
-We are from Kinik tribe.
-So you are from Kinik tribe?

210
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,500
You carry the blood of the Bey
who founded the Seljuk state, is that so?

211
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,966
Well, which clan from the
Kinik tribe do you belong to?

212
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:42,166
-Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Yes, you do. Come, my girl.

213
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:45,333
-Did you bring the drapes?
-I did, Mother.

214
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,166
The colors are faded.

215
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,333
What did you lack in material?

216
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,400
There is not enough grass due to famine.
We had to water down the dye.

217
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:14,133
We are doing all we can,
but this is the best we could do.

218
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,966
Did you try the leaves and
roots of dyer’s woad?

219
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,233
Our trader girl knows so much.

220
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,133
She learned so many things
as she traveled the seas and mountains...

221
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,366
...but she forgets that grass
don’t grow during famine.

222
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,033
If there was some, we would have used it.

223
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,966
Selcan is right, my girl.
We need to find another solution.

224
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:46,833
We don’t have much time left. We have
to go and sell these in the market...

225
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,433
...before we migrate but we don’t have
a single proper drape to sell.

226
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,800
Selcan, do your best.

227
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,200
You may leave.

228
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,700
Do not meddle in things
that does not concern you.

229
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:32,100
You are the dearest subjects
who will be going to God’s heaven.

230
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,266
You will find peace
in the compassionate embrace of Jesus.

231
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,766
You tasted death while alive...

232
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:43,766
...and now you will taste the peace of
redemption from all sins while you die.

233
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
Mario!

234
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,300
Rachel, my dear girl, you will find
the peace you seek in God’s heaven.

235
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,366
You know how much I trust your
intelligence and thus I gave you...

236
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,266
...the most difficult task.
Your task will be the Kayi Tribe.

237
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,333
Two knights of mine will accompany you.

238
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:11,166
My whole life was in unbearable pain, sir.
But my death will be...

239
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,133
...with the love of Jesus and honor.

240
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:18,933
My innocent lambs,
may you have a clear journey.

241
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,900
We did not understand your plan, sir.

242
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,433
Black death, my dear knight.

243
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:36,800
This small but powerful army
will spread the damnation of devil...

244
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
...all over the Muslim world.

245
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,766
Wait, stop there.

246
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,866
Do not worry. There is a way.

247
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,033
Come and sit here.

248
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,766
Look, my girl. Years ago one old woman
in the palace did something...

249
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:06,733
...to make the colors more vibrant.

250
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,433
The whole palace was surprised.

251
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:16,966
Even my late grandfather who was
the Sultan at the time was intrigued.

252
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:25,433
Everyone was against the poor woman. But
the colors on the drape were magnificent.

253
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:27,933
What did she do, father, tell me.

254
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,866
That is all. We set on the road from
Andalusia years ago and never looked back.

255
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,233
What made you leave your home, dervish?

256
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:41,966
A dream.

257
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:48,966
I am pursuing the divine call that made me
travel everywhere in the world for years.

258
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,333
-Is there a clan called Andalusia?
-Didn’t you ever hear of Andalusia?

259
00:39:56,966 --> 00:39:58,933
-Never, brother.
-Really?

260
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,000
-Am I lying to you?
-Sometimes I wonder why you carry a head.

261
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,833
-Doesn’t it get too heavy?
-Leave me alone.

262
00:40:09,766 --> 00:40:12,400
What about you, son?
Why are you going to Aleppo?

263
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,400
I was sent to Ameer El Aziz
as an ambassador.

264
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:21,400
-But we still couldn’t reach.
-You will, if God permits.

265
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,233
While his highness the Prophet and
his highness Abu Bakr was migrating...

266
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:33,033
...they took refuge in a cave.
The heretics were after them.

267
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:36,266
They found the tracks
that go inside the cave.

268
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:42,800
The companion of our Prophet, Abu Bakr
was anxious. Our Prophet said to him:

269
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,866
“Don’t you worry, Abu Bakr,
God is with us.”

270
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,733
There, a small spider weaved them
the most protective armor of all time.

271
00:40:54,466 --> 00:41:00,400
So the real question is whether we made
God a companion to our road or not.

272
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:05,700
If we did, all doors would open,
all roads would finish.

273
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,833
If we did not,
our companion would be the devil.

274
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,066
-Peace be upon you.
-The devil!

275
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,400
-Shut your mouth.
-And peace be upon you!

276
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,966
And peace be upon you

277
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,900
We saw the fire and came.
Do we have permission?

278
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,466
Please join us at our humble dinner.

279
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,300
If Karatoygar attacked our camp so easily,
he must have a spy inside.

280
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:04,933
No one in Kayi Tribe would dare
to be a spy for Karatoygar.

281
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,733
What did you talk with Karatoygar?

282
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,300
I asked for some time,
to convince Suleyman Shah.

283
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,233
He attacked before the time was up.

284
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,333
We cannot even protect the people
who take refuge in us.

285
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,200
Old age made Suleyman Shah very weak.

286
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:30,400
The unity and solidarity
of the tribe is at risk, Gundogdu.

287
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:34,100
If we don’t act,
the great Kayi tribe will fall apart.

288
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,066
He is my father but the future
of the tribe is more important.

289
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,866
What do you have in mind?

290
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,866
I will wait for Ertugrul
to return from Aleppo.

291
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:49,400
If he comes back empty handed,
I will act immediately.

292
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,233
What about your father?

293
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:58,133
My father is my life and blood but
I would act accordingly to Oguz customs.

294
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:10,766
Oguz customs tell so much to those
who know how to listen.

295
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:22,133
We are on the road for days without food.
We were devastated.

296
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:28,300
But I thank God that
he put you on our way.

297
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:32,933
We can never know from where
the fortune would smile at us.

298
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:39,066
True. We can never know from where
the trouble will come either.

299
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,933
What is the matter?
Did something bad happen?

300
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:46,866
While our caravan was on the road,
the crusaders, those Templars attacked us.

301
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:51,033
They seize every opportunity
and attack everywhere.

302
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:55,100
Last time we met a regiment of crusaders.
We killed them all!

303
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:00,333
You did well.

304
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:08,233
Those crusaders, where did they get the
courage to wander in the Muslim territory?

305
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,866
I heard that those heretics
are preparing for a new crusade.

306
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:18,700
They mobilized the whole Christian world
to invade Jerusalem.

307
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:25,233
I heard that they killed all the important
rulers in the Muslim states one by one...

308
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:30,400
...and left their bodies in town squares.

309
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,733
So we will have a festival.
We will need to prepare a warm welcome.

310
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,100
You jest, Bey. How will this be?
Muslims only draw swords at each other.

311
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,100
-They kill each other.
-Don’t you worry.

312
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,266
God would bear a big warrior and
unite the whole world under his flag.

313
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:04,233
And his progeny would conquer
Constantinople, take Jerusalem...

314
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,700
...and serve Mecca and Medina.

315
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,966
If God permits, we shall fight under
the flag of that warrior.

316
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,133
If God permits.
I hope you are right, if God permits.

317
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,133
I hope He sends that warrior soon
so that we can find peace, if God permits.

318
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,900
I would like to know these valuable God
followers who shared their food with us.

319
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:39,700
I am...

320
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:42,366
...Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

321
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,800
Ertugrul from Kayi Tribe.

322
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,600
I brought you molasses, father.

323
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:57,400
-Thank you, my girl.
-May it be health.

324
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,700
Well? Tell us now, Gundogdu.

325
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,300
What do you want to do and
require Oguz customs?

326
00:46:12,266 --> 00:46:16,566
If I was a Bey and someone
attacked my tribe...

327
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:22,133
...I would think about the punishment
I would give to the soldiers on guard.

328
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,066
What would you have done, Kurdoglu?

329
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:35,566
I say, Bey, the punishment given by
Suleyman Shah is well deserved.

330
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,400
Son, one day you may be Bey.
Look for the answer to this question then.

331
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,066
Now, do not busy your mind
on unnecessary business.

332
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:55,166
Just think about how you can do
your own task the best you can.

333
00:46:55,966 --> 00:46:58,900
-What task is this?
-Starting from tomorrow...

334
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,633
...you shall be collecting
the goods to be sold in the caravan.

335
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:06,000
The caravan shall set on
the road in three days.

336
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:09,500
Bey, why doesn’t the trader
take the goods?

337
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:13,299
Karatoygar has bad intensions.
He might raid the caravan.

338
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:16,566
That is why we can’t give
the goods to the trader.

339
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:20,300
Gundogdu will do this task with his Alps.

340
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:21,966
As you wish, father.

341
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,266
You invited me to your table,
shared your food...

342
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:32,933
...I shall never forget this kindness.
-May it be health.

343
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:37,300
I would like permission to leave.
I need to be on my way.

344
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,666
The roads would be dangerous at night.

345
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:41,600
We can go together at sunrise.

346
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,533
Thank you but I have not seen
my family for months.

347
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:47,166
I would not want to make
them worry anymore.

348
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,666
I have a carpet shop in the Aleppo market.
I would like to host you there.

349
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:53,666
If we have time, we may visit.

350
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,466
Please be aware, son.
The crusaders may attack any moment.

351
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,933
-They will not be seen around here today.
-You should still be careful.

352
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,100
They can masquerade and pose as anything.

353
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:12,366
Thank you.

354
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,066
-How are you, Turgut?
-I am better. Much better.

355
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,166
I regained consciousness.

356
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,366
Where are we?

357
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,033
When we had the chance,
why didn’t we slain them here?

358
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,900
We have warriors who killed
15 soldiers of ours.

359
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:55,333
God accepted my prayers in the end.

360
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,000
He made me meet my enemy.

361
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:03,400
We will prepare a nice welcome ceremony
for them in Aleppo.

362
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,966
Hear ye, hear ye,
please let it be known...

363
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,533
...the caravan will set on the road
in two days!

364
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,166
Orders from Suleyman Shah!

365
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,566
Dear Akcakoca, do you know what
I thought when this crier shouted caravan?

366
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:31,133
If you had listened to what I said,
your caravan would be...

367
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,333
...from here to China.
-Don’t start again, Wild Demir, don’t.

368
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:38,466
Look, Akcakoca, you don’t need to
get upset. All I said was that...

369
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:44,200
...instead of dealing with these ointments
for wounds, pains, poisons and such...

370
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:49,366
...you should have done an ointment for
women, put them in fancy bottles...

371
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:54,200
...with bright colors, women would smear
them on their faces and when they...

372
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:58,033
...found themselves beautiful,
you would have been bathing in coins.

373
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,666
Go back to your work! Dear God!

374
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,500
What is happening, my girl? The cows
cannot make dung fast enough for you.

375
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:11,366
For the love of God, father!
We are all stressed out as it is.

376
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:16,466
I understand, no one likes to joke around.

377
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:24,600
Alright?

378
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:45,933
Put a bit more.

379
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,066
Is this much dung enough, Halime?

380
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,600
Yes, I hope it is enough.

381
00:50:56,166 --> 00:51:01,033
Everyone is very tense. They say no good
will come out of drapes bathed in dung.

382
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,100
They think all their efforts
will go down in vain.

383
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:09,333
Look, Aykiz. Why do you think the drapes
they brought to Mother Hayme were faded?

384
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,366
Because the drapes were gray.

385
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,666
First of all, we need to whiten
the drapes we will dye later.

386
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:22,033
These pieces of dung will make
our drapes as white as snow.

387
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,966
Then you can dye any pattern you like.

388
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,633
Believe me, Aykiz, they will be very nice.

389
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:30,066
As long as it solves the problem.

390
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,266
But if we mess up, we will be in trouble.
We will be the talk of the tribe.

391
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,100
This one is done, Aykiz.
Dry them in the sun for some time.

392
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:47,466
May it be easy, Hatuns.

393
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:52,933
What is happening?
What are you working on?

394
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:55,233
We bathe the drapes in dung.

395
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,666
You bathe the drapes in dung?
I was not expecting this.

396
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,000
Where did this come from, Aykiz?

397
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:08,000
Halime Baci got permission
from Mother Hayme.

398
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,933
What punishment is this? The drapes were
the only place where dirt was not smeared.

399
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:28,433
What are you doing, Gokce? She invaded the
weavery as well, why didn’t you stop her?

400
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,566
What could I do, sister? Do I have a say
after Mother Hayme accepted?

401
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,666
Don’t you worry about it. When they mess
up this job, they will pay its price.

402
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,233
Why would an outsider whore pay the price?

403
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,600
If these goods don’t make it
to the caravan in time, we pay the price.

404
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,933
Sister, why are you making
a big deal out of her?

405
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,400
As you overrate this girl,
she starts to get more confident.

406
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:04,066
Do you know why I am making
a big deal out of her, Gokce?

407
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:07,300
Because I have a very naive sister,
that is why.

408
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,600
The man my sister loves,
is tangled in her web.

409
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,200
My sister may not see, but I do.
My sister may not hear, but I do.

410
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,033
The way Ertugrul looks
at this girl is not normal.

411
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,566
Remember my words when
you start crying after him.

412
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>I have one rose in three branches</i>

413
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:52,200
<i>I have sweet made of milk, my dervish</i>

414
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,933
<i>Help me, Abdul Qadir</i>

415
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:04,333
<i>I have a problem</i>

416
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:09,900
Master.

417
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,600
I can smell your grandfather,
our Master Gilani on you, Halabi.

418
00:55:20,966 --> 00:55:23,166
Thank you. Welcome, master.

419
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:26,666
We came from a long way with our guests.

420
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:31,466
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul
from Kayi tribe.

421
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:34,533
They have a mission,
they will go to the palace.

422
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:38,233
Then they are in luck, master.
Today is the visiting day of the palace.

423
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:42,633
If they can see the Emir, today is the day
otherwise they have to wait one month.

424
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,233
The One Who Blesses, son.

425
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,266
Dear God, I never thought that I would use
dung to bleach the cloths one day, Halime.

426
00:55:57,133 --> 00:56:01,300
You should see them after they get
snowy white. It will be worth the effort.

427
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:06,300
Then we will see the faces of those
who talk from our backs.

428
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,400
Well?

429
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:14,200
We can also bath your dowry drapes
in dung as well.

430
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:18,433
Of course we can.
As long as they return safe and sound.

431
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,066
-Is your dowry ready?
-Of course it is.

432
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:25,500
They have been laying inside
the chest for a long time.

433
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,400
Turgut Alp couldn’t get down
from his horse yet.

434
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,900
Why Turgut Alp, why?

435
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,933
Yes, Aykiz, it is not easy to be
the wife of an Alp.

436
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:39,100
I have been waiting for
Ertugrul Bey for years.

437
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,466
If it weren’t for the trader’s man
and Wild  Demir...

438
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,466
...my reputation would have been ruined.

439
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,266
Do you think Karatoygar
will continue with these violations?

440
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:07,600
We now know Numan’s worth
in the eye of Karatoygar.

441
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,133
He is more precious than we thought.

442
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,900
Karatoygar would do anything
to get him back.

443
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:15,433
What will you do?

444
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,066
Until Ertugrul comes with good news,
we will stay here and be ready for war.

445
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:26,533
You know the guest’s daughter, Halime?

446
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,033
You should see her. She works endlessly
to make the dye brighter on the drapes.

447
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,600
Do you think she would succeed?
They make the best money in the market.

448
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:38,266
If God permits, Bey, if God permits.

449
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,100
If God permits, we will migrate to Aleppo,
we can think Ertugrul’s wedding and...

450
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:53,600
Anyhow, may God let him return from Aleppo
with good news first, then we will see.

451
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,600
Who do you have in mind?

452
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,433
Gokce.

453
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,900
I am surprised that you find her suitable
while knowing her sister.

454
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,500
Gokce is different. She is a good girl.

455
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:13,100
Maybe this way, she can control
her sister’s endless ambitions.

456
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,933
You would not talk like this
if Gokce did not want to wed.

457
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,566
Well? What about Ertugrul?
Does he have the heart?

458
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,100
If God permits, we will see about that.

459
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,666
Sister, you made a fool out of me! A fool!

460
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,966
What are you saying, Gokce?

461
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:44,166
Because of you, I faced off with Halime
and told her that I waited for Ertugrul.

462
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,133
What more do you want?
You were too late to act anyway.

463
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:55,633
Sister, I guess you didn’t understand.
I said everyone heard me. Aykiz as well.

464
00:58:57,266 --> 00:59:01,366
Now everyone will tease me. They will say
that I am dreaming standing up.

465
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:03,533
-This is your fault.
-Gokce!

466
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,400
Look at me. Do not care
even if the whole world hears it.

467
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:14,166
You will win over Ertugrul
just like I did with Gundogdu.

468
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:18,066
And you will fight with
nails, teeth and all.

469
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,033
With your sweet talk and your beauty,
you will win over that son of a bastard.

470
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,400
You will crush anyone on your path.

471
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:31,600
Just like I became Gundogdu’s wife,
you will become Ertugrul’s wife.

472
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:36,366
We have not settled the score with
Suleyman Shah yet.

473
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,566
Each day the killer of our father sits
in the marquee, is a shame on us...

474
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,200
...a wound in our heart.
I don’t have any blood left in my veins.

475
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:48,600
Do you understand? Sitting in the marquee
is our well deserved right and...

476
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:50,433
...we will get our right.

477
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,566
What is it you want?

478
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:20,200
Did you swallow your tongue, talk!

479
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:24,066
A man’s word is said directly
to a man’s face, Bey.

480
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,166
Alright.

481
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:42,700
My eyes and ears are with you. Talk now.

482
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,333
I came as an ambassador of
Suleyman Shah of Kayi tribe.

483
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,533
I am his son, my name is Ertugrul.

484
01:01:50,966 --> 01:01:52,066
Well?

485
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,100
What do you want, son of a Bey?

486
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,233
I came to claim land from you.

487
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,533
You want land?

488
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:06,200
What will you give us in exchange?

489
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:11,666
Apart from the goats that will damage
our crops and the stench over our city?

490
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:16,266
Did the city make you forget
your roots, Bey?

491
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,900
How did you know that
I was Turkmen as well?

492
01:02:22,466 --> 01:02:26,933
The ring on your thumb. It is obvious
that it is not a mere ornament.

493
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,366
It gives you away, your thumb is damaged
due to shooting arrows to infidels.

494
01:02:31,933 --> 01:02:36,233
If you give us a land, in exchange
2000 Alps will be on your side...

495
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:40,033
...anytime you have trouble.
-2000 Alps?

496
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,933
Even the guards in my palace
is more than this.

497
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,933
May you have a good journey, son of a Bey.
Next.

498
01:02:56,466 --> 01:02:58,366
-Bey.
-Next.

499
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,200
Bey.

500
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:01,933
Come on.

501
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,100
Come on.

502
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,900
Your guards, count them as three less.

503
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:36,666
Congratulations.
It was the best spectacle I have watched.

504
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,633
Isn’t that so, Nasir? You clap as well.

505
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:44,966
Your highness Ameer.

506
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,466
I would like to get to know
this Turkmen warrior better.

507
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:57,366
We shall listen to the myths, stories
and sagas of the nomads from him...

508
01:03:57,566 --> 01:04:01,300
...during dinner tonight, what do you say,
my dear uncle?

509
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:04,166
I would be honored, your highness.

510
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:21,200
He sent the bodies of my men.

511
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,466
He thinks he can intimidate me.

512
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,533
Pray that he did not run over
your soldiers.

513
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,900
What are you saying?
Is your Bey opposing the Seljuk state?

514
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:34,500
Stop speaking nonsense, Karatoygar.

515
01:04:35,366 --> 01:04:38,033
And don’t try to use Seljuk state
as an excuse.

516
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:42,033
Sultan Aladdin is not aware
of the things you do here.

517
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,500
I am sure of that.

518
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:49,333
I understand that these prisoners will
open other doors for you in the state.

519
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,700
You should focus your intelligence
on your own tasks.

520
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,400
What does this intelligence say
about your incompetence, Kurdoglu?

521
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,700
You should see the incompetence of
your own men first.

522
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,033
They cannot even throw an ambush.

523
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,166
That is enough, Kurdoglu.
If you don’t bring Numan to me...

524
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:12,933
...you cannot become the Bey you wish.
I would make the sky fall on you.

525
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:17,466
You and Suleyman Shah
would be crushed below it.

526
01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:21,966
If you can be patient,
we can both take what we want.

527
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:26,666
But if you trample over me,
we would both lose.

528
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,233
I am prepared to fight
the whole world for Numan.

529
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:35,633
Don’t you ever forget this.

530
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,200
Won’t you still tell me
who those prisoners are?

531
01:05:40,433 --> 01:05:43,466
Don’t think about who they are,
think about who I am.

532
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,933
This is more important for you, Kurdoglu.

533
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:50,333
What will we do now?

534
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:59,666
I will give you Numan and
Suleyman Shah as well.

535
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,200
You will come to collect them
like a ripe date on a branch.

536
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,466
Now, listen to me closely.

537
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,033
When the caravan is ambushed,
Suleyman Shah cannot sit in his tent.

538
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,700
He will come after you.

539
01:06:18,066 --> 01:06:19,333
14 carpets.

540
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,966
Two dozens of wooden spoon.

541
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,233
72 pieces of kerchief.

542
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,566
God bless. God bless.
Your daughter and bride worked very well.

543
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:36,133
Dear Teyze, you should tie them well so
that we don’t have a problem on the road.

544
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:39,666
We wrapped them all up, Bey.
We wrapped them very well with my husband.

545
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:43,600
We don’t have a lot but I beg you...

546
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,533
...protect the caravan well.
Our livestock died of starvation.

547
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,900
All we have is entrusted in you.

548
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:55,100
I know, Emmi, I know. Don’t you worry.
Trust God first, then us with your goods.

549
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:59,066
I chose the best Alps I have for this job.
Do not worry about it.

550
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:01,000
Do not worry, people!

551
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,233
-Alright?
-Yes, Bey. Alright.

552
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:05,466
Gundogdu...

553
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:11,200
...with the money I get from these knives,
I will wed my daughter, let it be known.

554
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,266
You cannot save yourself
from Aykiz’s wrath.

555
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,200
Turgut’s as well.

556
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:22,500
We don’t know the distress they are
in Aleppo, may God be with them.

557
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,066
With you too.

558
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,133
Next.

559
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:39,433
Don’t come closer.
I would crush you like a millstone.

560
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:41,333
Please don't do this!

561
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,333
Anytime water touches my skin,
trouble finds me.

562
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:50,433
-You would go down with me as well.
-Bamsi, there is a feast in the palace.

563
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,366
Decide whether you will eat with us
or in the stable.

564
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,400
Please don’t.
I won’t give you my blessing if you die.

565
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:59,600
Bamsi, you have no way out.
You have to bathe. Give in.

566
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,333
I will not! I will die but
not submit to this. I will not!

567
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:06,366
-You skunk! You asked for this!
-Dear God!

568
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,533
-Please don’t do this. Dear God!
-Quiet!

569
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,533
Do not play around.
We will be late to the palace.

570
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:31,600
You heard our Bey, do not play around.

571
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:46,666
Bey? Why are you so thoughtful?

572
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,133
Being invited to
Ameer’s palace is a big thing for us.

573
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:58,000
They did not give us a land
or a promise, Ilyas.

574
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:02,466
-We will see what God has planned for us.
-Amen, Bey.

575
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,366
This job shall be finished tonight.

576
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:20,066
Will the men you send
be able to finish the job?

577
01:09:21,066 --> 01:09:23,100
You do your part, Nasir.

578
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:38,066
Which one of you hid my weapons?

579
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:40,700
What are you saying?
Didn’t we go inside together?

580
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:43,500
-But they are not here, look.
-What do you mean?

581
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,433
-Mine are not here either.
-They stole mine as well.

582
01:09:52,966 --> 01:09:57,333
I told you! Anytime I bathe,
some trouble happens! You saw it as well!

583
01:09:57,533 --> 01:10:00,033
We were careless trying to bathe you!

584
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,366
That’s enough! Shut up!
How will we tell this to our Bey?

585
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:09,000
What will you tell me, Turgut?

586
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,633
-I am asking you, Turgut.
-Bey, they stole our weapons.

587
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:23,566
What?

588
01:11:39,366 --> 01:11:40,700
Please, sit.

589
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,600
Please come to the table, Alps.

590
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,966
-Did you lose a man in the fight?
-No, your highness.

591
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:44,366
So, you were ambushed in my territory.
Is that so?

592
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:50,633
We will send soldiers and not let them
nest there, right, uncle?

593
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,466
-Of course, your highness.
-Fine. Alright.

594
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,333
They were punished severe enough.
They are all dead.

595
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:13,233
I know how the famine is affecting
you nomads. Sultan Aladdin is being...

596
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,466
...over tolerant with you. It is known
how your herds destroy villages and towns.

597
01:13:20,266 --> 01:13:23,933
The struggle between
the Oguz Tribes is another problem.

598
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,633
Everyone is after their herd, after food.

599
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:33,400
Famine hit the tribes hard. But a few
vigilant people cannot be an example.

600
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,533
I am bored. Play something more lively.

601
01:13:46,133 --> 01:13:49,333
Mongols from one side,
crusaders on the other.

602
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,633
I am not even counting
Khwarazmshahs and the Seljuks.

603
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,400
We need an ally to run to this fire with
a bucket of water, not a bellow.

604
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:03,266
When the factions inside the Muslim world
is demolishing everything...

605
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,000
...this is what we need.
Is this not so, your highness?

606
01:14:09,933 --> 01:14:13,200
It is, uncle. We need to put out the fire.

607
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:21,433
Our swords would not go back to their
sheaths, our horses don’t back down.

608
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,966
We also need an ally with a bucket of
water to put out the fire in our home.

609
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,200
How will we make a deal with you, Turkmen?

610
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:36,033
We would like a fertile winter quarter
for our tribe.

611
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:37,966
A quarter.

612
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,333
First you ask a quarter.
Then that would turn into a moorland.

613
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:45,066
Then you would demand a whole territory.

614
01:14:45,233 --> 01:14:47,533
True, we would.

615
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:55,000
If I gave you Aleppo...

616
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:02,333
...would you be satisfied?

617
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:09,000
Instead of offending an Ameer
who opened his land for us...

618
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:12,100
...we would let all the herds
we have starve.

619
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:19,666
-But I have reservations, Ertugrul.
-I am here to clear them up.

620
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:27,200
We thank you for the presents
Kayi ambassadors brought for us.

621
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:30,200
If you accept,
we also have some presents for you.

622
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:20,966
These are our weapons.

623
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:50,033
Now tell me, Ertugrul. How can we trust
the promises of warriors who cannot...

624
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:53,033
...even hold on to their weapons
during peace?

625
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,366
Why are you there, Nasir?
We are having fun here, come beside me.

626
01:17:54,133 --> 01:17:58,100
Now you can go. Go and rest.
You came from a long way.

627
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,466
I will consult with my commanders
tomorrow and give you my decision.

628
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:16,233
I herewith swear that from now on,
a hand that cannot claim his sword...

629
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:20,400
...shall not hold any other weapon.

630
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:26,433
I wish our weapons had been
struck by lightning...

631
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:29,900
...so that our Ertugrul Bey
would not have been humiliated like this.

632
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:34,433
I wonder what Ertugrul Bey feels
right now. He must be in rage.

633
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,166
Peace be upon you.

634
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:54,100
And peace be upon you,
with God’s Grace and Mercy.

635
01:20:16,566 --> 01:20:21,666
With peace in our world and beyond,
we commemorate one of your followers...

636
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,666
...who was full of love,
his highness Abdul Qadir Gilani.

637
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,266
Great God...

638
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:46,900
...You never make a subject
carry a load too heavy for him.

639
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:49,533
You put the load of the whole tribe
on my shoulders.

640
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,033
Grant me a way to carry this load.

641
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,700
You took Jonah out from a hole and made
him Sultan of Egypt. Please grant me...

642
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:11,600
...an opportunity so that I can climb up
from this bottomless pit I have fallen.

643
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:23,666
<i>Wake up, my son.</i>

644
01:26:23,316 --> 01:26:25,950
Dear God, we thank you.

645
01:26:36,683 --> 01:26:38,716
What did you do, did you kill him?

646
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:43,350
Don’t kill him!

647
01:26:53,316 --> 01:26:55,783
-Why did you kill him?
-What is happening here?

648
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:09,983
We learned many things from you,
your highness.

649
01:27:10,116 --> 01:27:14,383
In your cities, we have to guard
our weapons and our lives as well.

650
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:17,416
Who is this man, Nasir?

651
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:30,316
A Templar.

652
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,083
What did you talk about during dinner?

653
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,116
What does he want from El Aziz?

654
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,816
Kayis.
They wanted a quarter to stay in winter.

655
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:20,383
Kayis must get what they want.

656
01:28:22,383 --> 01:28:24,716
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

657
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:29,350
The territory they get, make it near
the border with the Crusader Countship.

658
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:33,783
This is an opportunity to kill
not only Ertugrul but all their blood.

659
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:38,683
Kayis may spend the winter in the skirts
of the Amanos Mountains...

660
01:28:38,883 --> 01:28:42,450
...somewhere very remote,
near the border of Antioch Countship.

661
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:47,750
This will be the last winter
of their lives.

662
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,450
Titus, are you aware of
what you are saying?

663
01:28:52,683 --> 01:28:54,116
This is a dangerous game.

664
01:28:54,283 --> 01:28:56,050
Do as I tell you, Nasir.

665
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,016
Follow them everywhere.

666
01:29:10,283 --> 01:29:14,016
You will report every move he makes,
every breath he takes back to me.

667
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:15,816
Take these pigeons.

668
01:29:31,883 --> 01:29:35,916
You became the hero of the tribe all of
a sudden, you don’t even talk to me now.

669
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,216
Suleyman Shah is not giving
his goods for us to sell.

670
01:29:40,283 --> 01:29:44,350
We came to the tribe for nothing.
Come on, help me prepare the caravan.

671
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:47,916
-I am not coming.
-I will not have this attitude, Afsin.

672
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:50,716
I took you with me while
you were starving.

673
01:29:50,983 --> 01:29:53,416
I gave you food and water, made you a man!

674
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,150
Now you cannot turn against me.
You owe me.

675
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,916
-May you heal soon.
-Thank you, Bey.

676
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:11,883
It is not very common...

677
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:17,683
...for someone to be such a good trader
and swordsman at the same time.

678
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:20,950
I heard that last night you fought well
in this wounded state.

679
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,683
The helper of the trader is
also just like you.

680
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:28,216
If I were a good trader, I would not have
been left out with children and no money.

681
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:33,216
When we come to sword, what we know about
swordsmanship is playing with children...

682
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:37,783
...that is all. If God permits, the burden
we imposed on you should finish soon.

683
01:30:39,283 --> 01:30:42,416
This is our only consolation,
Numan Effendi.

684
01:30:43,316 --> 01:30:45,150
Our only consolation.

685
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:47,883
So you say I owe you.

686
01:30:48,983 --> 01:30:53,716
Look at me, you dirty old man!
I worked for you like a dog for years...

687
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:58,916
...and I paid my debt to you! Now get out
of my face before I rip your head off.

688
01:30:59,316 --> 01:31:00,650
Get lost!

689
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:19,250
One is a trader...

690
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,716
...the other one is a caravan worker.

691
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:30,350
But they are first class swordsmen.

692
01:31:33,816 --> 01:31:35,716
You found each other well.

693
01:31:40,316 --> 01:31:46,083
I don’t know why but I don’t wonder about
who Karatoygar’s man inside the tribe is.

694
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,950
What are you doing?

695
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,916
-Selcan.
-Stop! Don’t!

696
01:32:30,283 --> 01:32:34,050
This is a sin! You cannot precede over
what God permits for you!

697
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,216
If we had a baby,
everything would be different.

698
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:42,183
My Hatun.

699
01:32:44,783 --> 01:32:48,783
We will have a baby one day.
We should not lose hope from God.

700
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:52,716
Your mother...

701
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,216
...is about to crown Halime
the first chance she gets.

702
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:04,950
Selcan...

703
01:33:05,183 --> 01:33:06,683
...don’t talk anymore!

704
01:33:10,316 --> 01:33:13,250
You are not aware of
the things going on around you.

705
01:33:14,216 --> 01:33:17,683
You don’t know the respect
she showed her at the weaving area.

706
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:20,650
She shows her the respect
she refrains from me.

707
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:25,116
She treats me as if I am not
his son’s wife but a mere servant.

708
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,983
Why?
Because I did not give her a grandson yet.

709
01:33:29,283 --> 01:33:30,716
She hates me.

710
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:34,683
Selcan.
You are accusing my mother without reason.

711
01:33:35,016 --> 01:33:36,850
She would not stoop so low.

712
01:33:37,016 --> 01:33:39,383
I know what goes through her mind.

713
01:33:42,216 --> 01:33:46,083
Look, woman, I cannot listen to
your whining right before the caravan...

714
01:33:46,216 --> 01:33:49,316
...alright? For the love of God.
-You don’t understand, do you?

715
01:33:49,683 --> 01:33:53,916
I am saying that Halime will set her foot
in our tribe but you don’t care less.

716
01:33:54,216 --> 01:33:56,450
God give me patience, patience.

717
01:34:37,783 --> 01:34:40,650
Gundogdu came out of his rage
very quickly, thank God.

718
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,116
He deserved to lead the caravan.

719
01:34:44,983 --> 01:34:47,216
Just like he deserved to carry wood.

720
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:53,083
If God permits, he will manage
to beat his arrogance as well.

721
01:34:53,716 --> 01:34:56,450
If God permits, Hayme. If God permits.

722
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:01,816
He organized the caravan very quickly.
That is not easy at all.

723
01:35:02,216 --> 01:35:05,183
He works day and night,
fighting tooth and nail.

724
01:35:06,216 --> 01:35:07,983
May God let him succeed.

725
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,650
-Sometimes...
-Sometimes what?

726
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:20,983
-Nothing.
-Hayme, what is on your mind?

727
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:26,883
I don’t know, Bey.
I get anxious about many things.

728
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:31,683
Don’t you worry.
They will both return safe and sound.

729
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:37,450
If God permits. If God permits.

730
01:35:41,383 --> 01:35:43,816
Halime, come on,
let us go and eat something.

731
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:47,716
-Aykiz, I will come after I finish this.
-Alright, I will be waiting.

732
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:32,383
-Sister, what did you do?
-This is not the time to question me.

733
01:36:32,716 --> 01:36:36,916
-What did you throw inside the cauldron?
-I am trying to save you from that girl.

734
01:36:37,883 --> 01:36:39,916
Sister, what you did is not right.

735
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:43,283
Moreover, the problem is not Halime here,
it is the caravan.

736
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:47,850
Gokce, why are you so empty headed?
Haven’t you still grasped the problem?

737
01:36:47,983 --> 01:36:50,883
That girl is the biggest disaster
who came to our tribe.

738
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:54,016
When will you understand this?
When Ertugrul weds her?

739
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:31,016
Do we have permission, Bey?

740
01:37:41,883 --> 01:37:47,016
Bey, we put you in a difficult situation.
We want you to forgive us.

741
01:37:59,383 --> 01:38:03,016
If you make a mistake like this again,
you would not find the opportunity...

742
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:05,350
...to come before me
and ask for forgiveness.

743
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:14,883
Bey, his highness Ameer
would like to see you.

744
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:55,316
Come, brave boy of the steppes, come.

745
01:38:58,783 --> 01:39:01,916
I owe you an apology for
the things that happened last night.

746
01:39:02,116 --> 01:39:06,716
Whoever is behind this attempt, my uncle
will find and punish them accordingly.

747
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:10,316
-Uncle.
-We decided to...

748
01:39:10,883 --> 01:39:14,350
...give you the territory you requested,
son of a Bey.

749
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:19,283
If you want the truth,
Nasir persuaded us to do so.

750
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:26,283
Do you know this place?
West of the Asi River.

751
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:31,716
-I heard that the land was fertile.
-It is fertile in enemies as well.

752
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,016
It is at the border of the people
who came to kill you last night.

753
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:37,916
So we can sleep side by side
with the devil.

754
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,750
Is it worth to take this risk
for your herds?

755
01:39:41,183 --> 01:39:44,983
Enemy enables us to be alert
and spry all the time. It keeps us alive.

756
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:54,416
Awesome, awesome, awesome. I love
these braves from the steppes, uncle.

757
01:39:55,216 --> 01:40:00,083
So you want to test your fate in the face
of the scorpion needle. Is that so?

758
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:05,183
If you are so willing to sleep
side by side with the devil...

759
01:40:05,716 --> 01:40:08,183
...all we can say is good luck to you.

760
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:11,683
We are impressed by
your courage once again.

761
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,850
When we have friends like you behind us...

762
01:40:17,749 --> 01:40:20,816
...we would never refrain from
facing the enemy upfront.

763
01:40:30,116 --> 01:40:33,249
Are you stilling thinking about
what Gokce said, Halime?

764
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:36,750
No. Why would her words concern me?

765
01:40:37,816 --> 01:40:41,083
-It is between Ertugrul and Gokce.
-So you don’t care?

766
01:40:44,683 --> 01:40:48,983
I know that you are eating yourself inside
out the last two days, am I blind, Halime?

767
01:40:49,116 --> 01:40:52,883
-Aykiz, please, let us focus on our work.
-Alright but...

768
01:40:53,116 --> 01:40:58,383
...please don’t take that mad girl
Gokce seriously. She is in an illusion.

769
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:02,916
Maybe Mother Hayme and Gokce already...

770
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:09,750
Aykiz?

771
01:41:16,283 --> 01:41:20,116
For it to take this color,
pheasant’s eye seeds must be added.

772
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:24,150
Halime, who would do this?

773
01:41:32,283 --> 01:41:35,116
Anyhow, there is a solution
for everything.

774
01:41:36,183 --> 01:41:39,083
Caravan is about to leave,
how will we make it in time?

775
01:41:39,316 --> 01:41:43,316
We will, Aykiz. There is no other way.
We will make it in time.

776
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:13,450
We are leaving.

777
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:25,383
Let us go and see our tribe’s
new territory.

778
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:27,883
-Ertugrul Bey?
-So El Aziz...

779
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:31,716
Let us not make our new land wait for us.

780
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:57,916
I don’t want Gundogdu, my father in law
or Mother Hayme to know that I came here.

781
01:42:58,383 --> 01:43:01,016
Don’t worry. No one will know.

782
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:05,716
Especially that man, Suleyman Shah,
will never know!

783
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:12,450
As you asked,
I brought a wisp of Gundogdu’s hair.

784
01:43:15,016 --> 01:43:19,283
You are the daughter of a big Bey, Selcan.
You don’t deserve these things.

785
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:27,350
The impudence of the woman who is supposed
to be your mother in law. Your husband...

786
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:30,050
...looking at you like a dried up twig.
-Enough!

787
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:36,350
Do not be ashamed of the pains you lived
through. You shall get all you deserve.

788
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:41,283
The spirit army shall fill
your stomach with the seeds of your man.

789
01:43:47,216 --> 01:43:51,716
You will have a son.
And the fate of Kayi tribe will change.

790
01:43:59,383 --> 01:44:04,783
Hamza, we will leave early in the morning.
Check the weapons of the Alps...

791
01:44:04,916 --> 01:44:07,883
...make sure they have plenty of arrows.
-As you wish, Bey.

792
01:44:12,683 --> 01:44:14,783
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, uncle.

793
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:17,183
I thought about it and...

794
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:21,716
...I don’t think it is a good idea for you
to be going with the caravan, Gundogdu.

795
01:44:22,683 --> 01:44:23,816
Why is that?

796
01:44:23,983 --> 01:44:26,650
We don’t know what that Karatoygar dog
may be up to.

797
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,950
Even if you take the best Alps with you,
this is very dangerous.

798
01:44:30,116 --> 01:44:33,950
You are son of a Bey. Ertugrul is not here
either and your father is ill.

799
01:44:34,716 --> 01:44:37,883
It would be best if you find
a way to stay in the tribe.

800
01:44:38,016 --> 01:44:41,983
Uncle, would it suit a son of a Bey
to drowse around in the tribe?

801
01:44:42,883 --> 01:44:47,416
Look around you. All these people have
trusted their goods and labor with me.

802
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,683
Of course, it should be
my duty to take them.

803
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:55,816
If that dog Karatoygar makes a move, we
shall do all what we can, if God permits.

804
01:44:57,016 --> 01:44:58,416
Do not worry about it.

805
01:45:04,883 --> 01:45:06,950
We made everything ready, Mother Hayme.

806
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,916
Gokce finished the carpets.

807
01:45:09,116 --> 01:45:13,650
May your hands be blessed. If God permits,
they will find their worth in the market.

808
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,416
And I wove this for you, Mother Hayme.

809
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:28,783
My pure girl, clean girl.
You are one of a kind.

810
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:32,316
When did you find the time
during all this hassle?

811
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:34,983
She has not slept for days, Mother Hayme.

812
01:45:35,983 --> 01:45:37,683
God bless.

813
01:45:41,283 --> 01:45:42,983
Halime, what will we do?

814
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:13,650
Why did they become like this, Halime?

815
01:46:22,183 --> 01:46:25,250
I am guessing that we did not use
enough dung, Mother Hayme.

816
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:26,883
We shall try again.

817
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:34,650
You did all you could do.
It would never be ready by the morning.

818
01:46:35,016 --> 01:46:39,450
No! We will work all night if needed to
make them ready, Mother Hayme.

819
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:41,350
Do not worry.

820
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:47,350
One last hope? Alright.

821
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:50,116
May it be easy on you.

822
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,050
Welcome, son of a Bey.

823
01:47:44,650 --> 01:47:48,050
I wanted a blessing from Ibn Arabi
before we set on the road.

824
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:51,650
Sheikh Efendi already left,
don’t you know?

825
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:54,450
-To where?
-God knows.

826
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,750
-Won’t I see him again?
-Only God knows.

827
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:05,283
-I need to find him.
-How can you find, if you have not lost?

828
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:08,050
How can you lose, if you have not found?

829
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:24,316
This was the stupidest thing
you could have done, Titus.

830
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:30,716
You did not manage to revenge your brother
and made Kayis a bigger problem for us.

831
01:48:30,983 --> 01:48:33,416
Sir, I did the right thing.

832
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:36,816
You did the right thing, is that so?

833
01:48:36,983 --> 01:48:40,683
-I did not expect such stupidity from you.
-Sir.

834
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:45,883
I don’t understand whom you are afraid of.
Of Ertugrul or the person beside him...

835
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:47,783
...Ibn Arabi?

836
01:48:49,316 --> 01:48:52,050
How dare you say that I am frightened?

837
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:56,850
Listen to me closely, Titus.

838
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:02,850
We will never let the Turks
come to our borders, never!

839
01:49:09,016 --> 01:49:14,316
If your desire for revenge precedes
your duty one more time...

840
01:49:15,383 --> 01:49:19,350
...I would bury you beside
your brother with my own hands.

841
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:43,016
Great God, you make everything possible.

842
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:45,783
This must be heaven.

843
01:49:46,116 --> 01:49:48,416
But hell is right around the corner.

844
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:52,416
Yes, beyond this territory is the
Antioch Crusaders Countship.

845
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:56,916
Secret fort of the Templars
must be somewhere around here.

846
01:49:58,116 --> 01:50:02,850
Devil is everywhere, Turgut.
In our tribe, in Aleppo. Everywhere.

847
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:06,383
We will have a lot of fun, a lot!

848
01:51:12,283 --> 01:51:15,783
God bless, Bey. You can find water
under every stone you turn.

849
01:51:15,983 --> 01:51:18,316
I never saw such fertile land in my life.

850
01:51:18,883 --> 01:51:23,283
It will grow the babies, fatten the sheep.
It will give life to the tribe.

851
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:31,250
How did they let such
a nice land to be uninhabited?

852
01:51:32,283 --> 01:51:34,783
Because it is right next to hell, Turgut.

853
01:51:36,116 --> 01:51:39,416
Yes, Bey.
Why did these Templars want to kill you?

854
01:51:40,783 --> 01:51:44,316
I am guessing that they want to
revenge the knights we killed.

855
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:48,750
Bey, so we can say that they will not let
us find peace here as well.

856
01:51:50,383 --> 01:51:51,916
Forget the heretics...

857
01:51:55,183 --> 01:51:57,316
...think about your wedding with Aykiz.

858
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:01,850
As soon as the tribe settles here,
our first job will be to wed you.

859
01:52:02,683 --> 01:52:03,916
God willing, Bey.

860
01:52:05,183 --> 01:52:10,883
Aykiz is a dear. If she was someone else,
she would have wed another man long ago.

861
01:52:17,716 --> 01:52:18,750
Bey...

862
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:22,783
...maybe we can have a double wedding.

863
01:52:29,683 --> 01:52:34,683
Our flags shall be our tents. We shall
ride our horses to borderless plains.

864
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:39,183
Our weapons shall be our lovers
and our armies shall be strong.

865
01:52:39,416 --> 01:52:43,983
Our crest shall fly over seven climates
as the flag of justice.

866
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:48,316
We shall carry our divine message
beyond the mountains and seas.

867
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,683
You came walking to your own death.

868
01:53:33,116 --> 01:53:36,016
You have been breathing down
on our necks since Aleppo.

869
01:53:36,183 --> 01:53:38,250
Tell me! Who holds your leash?

870
01:54:13,883 --> 01:54:15,716
He has already gone to hell.

871
01:54:37,316 --> 01:54:39,250
These are messenger pigeons, Bey.

872
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:44,383
Then, let us send them to their owner.

873
01:56:40,216 --> 01:56:42,416
Dear God, thank you.

874
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:00,750
The long awaited has come.

875
01:57:01,016 --> 01:57:03,416
What are you blabbering on again?

876
01:57:03,983 --> 01:57:08,850
Didn’t you come to me because of the
heaviness that fell upon you, Petroccio?

877
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:15,683
I don’t believe in any of the prophecies
than heretic from Andalusia, Ibn Arabi...

878
01:57:15,883 --> 01:57:19,849
...has thrown our way,
my dear brother Giovanni.

879
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:23,016
Don’t call me Giovanni.

880
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:26,683
My name is Omer.

881
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:32,683
You know very well that everything
my sheikh Ibn Arabi has said came true.

882
01:57:33,783 --> 01:57:36,950
The starbursts herald
the long awaited braves.

883
01:57:38,083 --> 01:57:43,016
Will these herd of shepherds running away
from the Mongols rule the whole world?

884
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:47,250
They will unite the whole Muslim world
as a fist.

885
01:57:47,783 --> 01:57:53,250
And that fist will throw a punch,
demolishing your cursed order.

886
01:58:11,216 --> 01:58:13,283
Did you take enough water, Gundogdu?

887
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,750
You won’t find water while passing
the Enger Mountain.

888
01:58:16,883 --> 01:58:20,916
We did, Bey. We didn’t want to take too
much as it would be heavy for the animals.

889
01:58:21,116 --> 01:58:25,450
-Good. Is there anything left behind?
-There is. Aykiz and Halime.

890
01:58:28,816 --> 01:58:30,350
Let me run and check them.

891
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:33,250
They are coming.

892
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:44,350
We apologize for being late.

893
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:47,750
-Are they finished?
-All of them, Mother Hayme.

894
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:51,783
How did they turn out?
Are they worth taking to the market?

895
01:58:51,950 --> 01:58:53,250
Show me one to see.

896
01:59:01,116 --> 01:59:03,016
How is it, Hanim, is it good?

897
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:07,450
I have never seen such vibrant colors
in my life.

898
01:59:08,416 --> 01:59:10,850
Good. Load these drapes as well.

899
01:59:11,783 --> 01:59:13,316
The caravan may leave.

900
02:00:01,916 --> 02:00:02,950
Come.

901
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:08,950
The caravan left the village, sir.
Suleyman Shah’s son Gundogdu is leading.

902
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:10,683
Come closer. Come to me.

903
02:01:15,816 --> 02:01:18,250
The flood has passed and sand is left.

904
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:23,716
Thank God, we did not need to bow
our heads in shame in front of our men.

905
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:29,283
You worked very hard. After cleaning up,
you may all go and rest.

906
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:33,450
Come on now. Selcan, come with me.

907
02:01:38,316 --> 02:01:41,850
There is an issue
I wanted to talk with you for a long time.

908
02:01:42,016 --> 02:01:43,450
I am listening, mother.

909
02:01:44,816 --> 02:01:50,950
My girl, after your mother and
father died, you and your sister Gokce...

910
02:01:51,116 --> 02:01:57,950
...were entrusted with us. I tried not to
discriminate you from my own children.

911
02:01:58,883 --> 02:02:01,350
May our lives be sacrificed for you,
Mother Hayme.

912
02:02:01,683 --> 02:02:04,950
Did we commit a crime without knowing?
Did we break your heart?

913
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:09,916
No, nothing like that. The thing I want
to say is completely different.

914
02:02:11,316 --> 02:02:16,250
Gokce has grown, she got very beautiful.
She became a very proper girl.

915
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:19,916
We need to wed her soon.

916
02:02:20,883 --> 02:02:24,816
You are right, mother. I was also thinking
the same thing for a long time.

917
02:02:26,216 --> 02:02:27,716
Well...

918
02:02:28,816 --> 02:02:30,950
...who are we going to wed her with?

919
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:37,816
If you give consent as well, Ertugrul
and Gokce should grow old together.

920
02:02:40,216 --> 02:02:43,850
Please, Mother Hayme, who am I to have
a say in something like this?

921
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:48,416
Don’t say that.
You raised her since she was very little.

922
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:53,983
I wanted to ask you first.
You can inquire and see her reaction.

923
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:57,816
I will go immediately, Mother Hayme.
I am going right now.

924
02:05:44,716 --> 02:05:48,016
<i>The pigeon wing’s final destination</i>
<i>is the wolf’s mouth.</i>

925
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:50,816
<i>Suleyman Shah’s son, Ertugrul.</i>

926
02:06:38,316 --> 02:06:39,716
Attack!

927
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:41,750
We expected a big welcome
with drums and all.

928
02:08:41,983 --> 02:08:44,916
-This is strange.
-Everyone must have finished their job.

929
02:08:45,083 --> 02:08:48,683
The caravan must be on its way as well.
Everyone is probably resting.

930
02:08:48,983 --> 02:08:51,983
You carry on. I will visit my father.

931
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:15,883
Stop!
