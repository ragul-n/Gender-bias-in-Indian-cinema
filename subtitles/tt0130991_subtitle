3
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,330
Kamla, come here.

4
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,240
Open your mouth.

5
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,190
Just you wait!

6
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,960
How many times have I told you
not to talk to that bitch?

7
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,990
She'll make you, too,
worthless like herself.

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,510
- Will you play with her again?
- No, Ma.

9
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,646
Trouble maker.

10
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,660
- Have you finished?
- Yes, mother.

11
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,180
What's that?

12
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,930
God! This girl will throw
away the utensils too.

13
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,040
Wonder what sin I'm paying for.
You good-for-nothing!

14
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,850
You dirtied the utensils again.
What do you think?

15
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,400
Clean them all again.

16
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,630
If I see you wasting time
again, I'll thrash you!

17
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,310
I'll be rid of her
only after she dies.

18
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,520
Will you let me die
in peace or not?

19
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,840
You shut-up! This girl
has become so lazy...

20
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,790
the moment I turn my back,
she starts lazing around.

21
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,690
She has even made my
Shankar like herself.

22
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,910
You're being cruel
to her for no reason.

23
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,390
Despite being so
close to death...

24
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,910
I might not die...

25
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,700
because I don't want to leave
the innocent girl at your mercy.

26
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,250
Talking too much will hurt you.

27
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,820
Take your medicine and sleep.

28
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,330
You'll have to listen
to me today.

29
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,210
She is my friend's daughter.

30
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,690
And he'd left her in my custody,
along with all his property...

31
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,810
so that I took care of her.

32
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,480
But along with usurping
his property...

33
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,270
you also want to kill her.

34
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,230
How will I face my friend
in the next world?

35
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,120
I don't like speaking of death.

36
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,070
And as if I'll take this wealth
with me when I die.

37
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,810
I'm keeping it for your son.

38
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,430
Let's go and hear a
story from the maid.

39
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,300
- Is your ear feeling better now?
- Forget that.

40
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,510
Mom is reading the Gita for father.

41
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,230
It's a good opportunity.
Let's go!

42
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,050
Maid!

43
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,910
You two have come
together again?

44
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,940
If madam sees you,
you won't lose anything.

45
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,190
- This poor girl will be beaten.
- She can't see us.

46
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,990
She's reading the Gita to father.

47
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,390
And you won't let us be beaten.

48
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,430
Naughty!

49
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,960
- Will you tell us a story?
- Alright, sit here.

50
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,600
Take.

51
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,570
What story would
you like to hear?

52
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,250
- The fairy princess story.
- Yes, the same.

53
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,350
When the prince comes
on horseback...

54
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,390
Keep quiet.
Let her tell the story.

55
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,060
Alright, listen.

56
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,990
There was a fairy queen,
who had a young daughter.

57
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,670
She was very beautiful, very
sweet. Everyone loved her.

58
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,160
She was great friends
with a prince...

59
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,670
who used to take her on
his horse for long rides.

60
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,600
When he didn't come, she would
sing a song to call him.

61
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,520
And the prince, wherever he
might be, would come running.

62
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,880
But one day, when she was
sleeping in her palace...

63
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,300
a witch came in to eat her.

64
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,540
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

65
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,700
Let us create our own new world

66
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,850
We will live in our
own small world

67
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,860
In which we will live with love

68
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,150
We will make the moon our boat

69
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,300
And bring down the stars

70
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,490
Our world will be different
from this world

71
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,710
And our love unique

72
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,570
Let us create our own new world

73
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,140
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

74
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,370
Let us create our own new world

75
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,200
With flowers in our lap

76
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,490
We will narrate our story

77
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,550
With the dawn will come dancing

78
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,730
And bring along new blooms

79
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,000
The dew will come and
kiss our cheeks

80
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
And the rains will pour

81
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,160
Let us create...

82
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,600
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

83
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,790
Let us create our own new world

84
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,500
- Maid?
- What is it?

85
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,650
Mom has locked Kamla
in the room again.

86
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,480
She'll be afraid.
Please get her out of there.

87
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,070
She is bent on killing
the poor girl.

88
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,750
Maid, you have to go and
get her out of there.

89
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,060
Come dear, master
has called you.

90
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,460
Come close to me, dear.

91
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,890
I had made many promises
to your father.

92
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,750
But I have been incapacitated.

93
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,060
I wonder how I will
ever face him.

94
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,790
You aren't feeling well.
Go to sleep.

95
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,400
I want to sleep forever.

96
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,080
But I am helpless. When you
are not at peace here...

97
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,030
how can I die in peace?

98
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,250
Master, if you talk like that,
who will she look to for support?

99
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:55,500
When one has no one left,
God becomes his support.

100
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,280
Kamla, I put you in His care.

101
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,780
Where is God's picture?
Where is it?

102
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
Why can't I see it?

103
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,940
Maid, bring the picture here.

104
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,060
Whenever I've been very upset...

105
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,800
I have found solace at His feet.

106
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,990
You also take solace
from Him, dear.

107
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,380
Shankar, come close to me.

108
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,880
You are my son.
You keep my word.

109
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,910
I make you responsible
for Kamla.

110
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,320
With God as witness...

111
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,280
promise me...

112
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,350
you won't let your mother
take Kamla's property.

113
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,670
You witch! You've come out again!

114
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,680
What magic spell are you
casting here? Come!

115
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,750
Leave her alone!
I said leave her alone!

116
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,530
As long as Shankar's
father was alive...

117
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,050
we somehow managed to survive.

118
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,810
But I am alone, and a woman.
And I have to take care of my son.

119
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,990
How can I afford
to feed that orphan?

120
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,740
Don't worry, the girl will
calm down in our orphanage.

121
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,040
You won't know she even exists.

122
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,450
- Shall I call her?
- Sure.

123
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,820
Kamla, where does man
go after he dies?

124
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,320
- To God.
- God kills man.

125
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,690
Then what does His idol do?

126
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,350
Father used to say that keeping
it close rids one of his fear.

127
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,040
One finds solace.

128
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,620
After father's death,
I feel very scared.

129
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,850
Then take the idol to your room.

130
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,600
- What about you?
- Just give me a flower kept at His feet.

131
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,190
Kamla.

132
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,200
Where were you?
I've been looking for you.

133
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,920
Look at your hair. It's disheveled.
Come, I'll comb it.

134
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,160
Go Shankar, you also
go and freshen up.

135
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Greet him.

136
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,320
I've heard you're a very naughty girl.

137
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,430
But you'll have
to straighten up from today.

138
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,790
And be as straight a girl
as this cane of mine!

139
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,680
Come with me!

140
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,090
- Shankar! Shankar!
- Kamla!

141
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,840
Shankar!

142
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,120
Kamla!

143
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't cry, dear.

144
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
What is your name, dear?

145
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,010
Did she reveal who
her relatives are?

146
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,950
No madam, she doesn't
want to go anywhere.

147
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,590
Mention her going back,
and she starts crying.

148
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,810
I told you, she doesn't seem
to belong to this world.

149
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,080
She has come from heaven
only to serve the Lord.

150
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,880
Make her a priestess (devotee).

151
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,160
Will you stay here with us and
promise to serve the Lord?

152
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,880
Will you lock me up here?

153
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,880
This is God's home. No one is
forced to do anything here.

154
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,620
Will mother come
here and beat me?

155
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,320
Those who promise to
serve the Lord...

156
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,570
God Himself protects them.

157
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,750
No one will beat you here.

158
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,030
Kamla, before becoming a priestess...

159
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,860
any memories you have
of earthly bonds...

160
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,690
destroy them all in this holy fire.

161
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,270
It will destroy all your sins,
and purify you.

162
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:11,560
You have to surrender
your clothes, your bonds, in this fire.

163
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,550
Hail Shankar!

164
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,500
A devotee craving the sight
of You is here

165
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,120
I light lamps before You

166
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,550
If I gain a place at your feet,
I'll find peace in life

167
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,210
A devotee craving the sight
of You is here

168
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,010
I light lamps before you

169
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:07,120
If I gain a place at your feet,
I'll find peace in life

170
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,560
You sustain the world

171
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,470
Your lights are the
moon and stars

172
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,990
This sinner has come
to Your door

173
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,430
Please keep me at Your feet

174
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:05,980
I plead with You, with my
head bowed in reverence

175
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:20,140
If I gain a place at Your feet,
I'll find peace in life

176
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,090
A devotee craving the sight
of You is here

177
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,900
I light lamps before You

178
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:34,940
If I gain a place at Your feet,
I'll find peace in life

179
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,290
I have many flaws

180
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,580
Help me keep my honor

181
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,410
Help me through life

182
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,230
Grant me this boon, oh Lord

183
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,520
I have brought this sinful
life to Your door

184
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,930
Grant me this boon, oh Lord

185
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:35,300
I plead with You, with my
head bowed in reverence

186
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,480
If I gain a place at your feet,
I'll find peace in life

187
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,210
A devotee craving the sight
of You is here

188
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,990
I light lamps before You

189
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,880
If I gain a place at your feet,
I'll find peace in life

190
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,980
A devotee craving the sight
of You is here

191
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,180
Shankar?

192
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,290
Who was he?

193
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,020
- Who was he?
- Kamla?

194
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,160
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

195
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,390
Let us create our own new world

196
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,590
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

197
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,820
Let us create our own new world

198
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,880
- Are you very sad?
- No, mother.

199
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,770
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

200
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
Even after staying in the
temple for so many years...

201
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,760
why does your mind always
think of the outside world?

202
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,810
Your feet falter many times
walking the path of your duty.

203
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,960
What is that bond you
haven't been able to forget yet?

204
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,950
Who holds the strings of your heart?
Who tugs at them always?

205
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,950
I think of no one but Shankar.

206
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,640
I have surrendered
myself at His feet.

207
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,190
That is what I'd
come to tell you.

208
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,450
That you have become
the Lord's priestess.

209
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,750
You have no right to have
anything in your heart...

210
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,520
except the Lord's image.

211
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,620
Stick to your oath, dear.
Keep your heart pure.

212
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,750
If it still holds any evil,
any sin, any memory...

213
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,780
throw it out of your heart.
It is in your interest.

214
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,950
Years passed.
Many Springs came and went.

215
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:32,320
Many storms rose, and hid
in the folds of time.

216
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,210
But he couldn't erase
the memory of her from his heart.

217
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,280
The cruelty of time had
snatched the shine from his eyes.

218
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,850
His lips smiled,
but his heart would cry.

219
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,810
Nobody was aware
of the poison...

220
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,830
that was suppressed
in that handsome body.

221
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,230
Many women came into his life.

222
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,310
They fell for his money,
and his woeful face.

223
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,140
}And he would secretly
laugh at them.

224
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,150
He was taking revenge
on the entire world.

225
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,610
- Then what happened?
- We'll know when we continue.

226
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,220
It is always easier
when no one knows.

227
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,440
Knowing something
is also a burden.

228
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,850
Shankar, you like this flower
very much, don't you?

229
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,340
Then put it in my hair.

230
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,960
Come on!

231
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,250
Mohini, how will
one flower help?

232
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,300
Ask for diamonds and pearls.
You can loot everything.

233
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,960
- What have I looted from anyone?
- Ask me that.

234
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,640
Except for this one flower, you
have taken everything I had.

235
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,230
What you say is so fascinating.

236
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,810
Your eyes are so mesmerizing.

237
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,710
And even my estate is beautiful.

238
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,230
It is full of silver fields
and gold jungles.

239
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,340
You always confuse me
with what you say.

240
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,950
- You are very bad.
- Thank you.

241
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,800
- What are you doing here?
- When did you trap this new bird?

242
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,990
What you're doing isn't right.

243
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,620
- Better leave!
- Yes, I'm leaving.

244
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,020
- Meet you at the estate.
- Don't go there, I'm warning you!

245
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,030
Why not? What will
you do? Kill me?

246
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,080
What's the matter?

247
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,600
What's the matter?

248
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,970
I'll have to go to my
estate for some days.

249
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,040
So, why are you worried?
Take me along.

250
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,380
I'll get a chance to see your estate.

251
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,950
- Will you come along?
- We'll take along some friends, too.

252
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,640
It'll be a nice picnic.

253
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,800
This full moon, we will have to
attend the festival in Kamalpur.

254
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,420
What festival, mother?

255
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,990
Every year, after harvest,
the farmers there...

256
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,330
worship the Goddess.

257
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
We received an invitation this year.

258
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,600
- When do we leave?
- On the 13th day.

259
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,730
- Hail Shankar!
- Welcome. How are you?

260
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,220
By the Lord's grace,
we are fine.

261
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,560
She is Thakur's (landlord's)
Mother. Greet her, dear.

262
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
Thakur's mother?

263
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,500
Greetings, mother.

264
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,690
It's strange! Seeing the
Thakur's mother...

265
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,770
I felt she was my old maid.
She has the same face!

266
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,960
Don't say that, dear.
She is Thakur's mother.

267
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,220
If anyone hears you,
what will they say?

268
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,800
There can be two people
with similar faces.

269
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,060
Besides, your maid's face
would change over the years.

270
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,070
God knows whether she
is alive or not.

271
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,220
What are you looking at?

272
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,540
Those flowers are so beautiful.

273
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,830
You are sad again. You've been
reminded of some past memory.

274
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,980
No mother.

275
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,770
Past days and separated friends...

276
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,540
don't return just by
thinking of them.

277
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,140
And what will I gain
thinking about them?

278
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,040
I was just admiring
the lovely sights.

279
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,110
The flower beds
are so beautiful.

280
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,210
If you permit me, may I take
a stroll in the garden?

281
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,180
Of course, child.

282
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,670
Away from the world,
close to the clouds

283
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,060
Let us create our own new world

284
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:34,020
Who are you?
Have I reached heaven?

285
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,220
No. Your horse stumbled.

286
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,980
You wanted to pluck this flower.

287
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,700
Where is the flower?

288
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,890
- I wanted to pluck the flower, but fell down.
- Why?

289
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,290
Any beautiful flower
I see, I pluck it.

290
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,900
Even you are very beautiful.

291
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,200
Why stare at me like that?
Do you know me?

292
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,200
I feel I've seen you before.

293
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,200
Where have you seen me?

294
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,020
You must have heard
about my riches.

295
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,560
You misunderstand me.

296
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,460
Who are you?

297
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,280
A priestess.

298
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,520
If you're a priestess,
go to the temple and worship God.

299
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,090
You'll only benefit there.
What can you accomplish roaming the jungle?

300
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,610
How are you, Mohini?
My eyes were craving to see you.

301
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,400
Do you like this place?

302
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,286
I feel like never
leaving this place.

303
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,110
Who's asking you to leave?
Ask my heart.

304
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,270
Every heart beat says you
must stay here forever.

305
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,800
You are a thorough liar!

306
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,910
You have no place for
me in your heart.

307
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,380
If not in my heart,
there's a place in this house.

308
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,800
Thakur has come suddenly,
and we have many guests.

309
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,390
Their stay is being arranged
in the rooms below.

310
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,800
Would you mind if I gave
you a room upstairs?

311
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,390
Come.

312
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,250
This wind, this night,
this moonlight

313
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,240
All I crave is for
one look from you

314
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,480
How can I not yearn for you?

315
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,390
My passion for you
brings joy to my heart

316
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,700
This wind, this night,
this moonlight

317
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,990
Do you know, oh naive one...

318
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,770
what one look from you
does to me?

319
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,670
If it's an angry look,
it can make hell break loose

320
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:36,410
And a loving look gives solace

321
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,110
How can I not yearn for you?

322
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,000
Your every word fascinates me

323
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,430
This wind, this night,
this moonlight

324
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:21,200
There is none more
beautiful than you

325
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,370
There is excitement in the air

326
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:51,100
All due to the magic
of your eyes

327
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,440
How can I not yearn for you?

328
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,310
My passion for you brings
joy to my heart

329
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,890
This wind, this night,
this moonlight

330
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:11,350
All I crave is for
one look from you

331
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,280
She is Thakur's mother.
Greet her, dear.

332
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,380
I wanted to pluck a flower,
and fell down.

333
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,940
Even you are beautiful.

334
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:01,000
- What's going on upstairs?
- You? Over here?

335
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,240
The screams are scaring me.
Who's upstairs?

336
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,520
- The spirit of a witch.
- Spirit? There's a spirit here?

337
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,020
It's in the room upstairs.
It doesn't come down, don't worry.

338
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,010
Then why has Thakur gone upstairs?

339
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,130
Unless he goes upstairs
for the witch to see him...

340
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,760
she doesn't stop screaming
and shouting.

341
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,100
Don't go upstairs.

342
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,970
Who's she?

343
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,780
- She's a priestess.
- What's she doing here?

344
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,320
I wonder where these
priestess's come from.

345
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,040
Is this a home or a temple?

346
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,370
What will you gain by breaking
these lifeless statues?

347
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:01,970
My life is broken.
I will break everything.

348
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,200
That won't give you
peace of mind.

349
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,400
Peace is not in my destiny.

350
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,980
Your roaming from city to city
distresses you all the more.

351
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,640
I don't roam.
I try to escape death.

352
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,720
If I stay here,
she'll suck me dry one day.

353
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,210
Forget that.
I get wounded every day.

354
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,190
For how long will you
treat the wounds?

355
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,180
May I come in?

356
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,110
Come.

357
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:33,770
What is the matter?
You hesitate to invite me in?

358
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,510
- What's inside your room?
- My ruin.

359
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,400
There's something you're hiding...

360
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,910
or you wouldn't stand in
the doorway like that.

361
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,350
You don't like anyone
coming to your room?

362
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,630
It's not that.

363
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,180
But sometimes, a garden
becomes so barren...

364
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,560
it's afraid to invite Spring.

365
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,310
Anyway, love, tell me...

366
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,960
how did you know someone needed
you badly right now?

367
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,250
Don't speak such sweet lies.

368
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,210
If you needed someone,
you weren't helpless.

369
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,820
Nor was my room so far away.

370
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:38,840
I heard some voices and assumed
you must be awake.

371
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:46,080
So I came to ask why you
haven't been able to sleep yet.

372
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,280
You're asking a question
whose answer I'm also looking for.

373
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,180
I often think about it,
but don't know why.

374
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,230
And then I feel like going
and lying down...

375
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,830
in the lap of a beauty like you.

376
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,080
Even that's not true.

377
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:13,060
Or someone waits for you for
hours, but you don't come.

378
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:19,630
You gave me a room downstairs
with all the other guests.

379
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,340
Moreover, you hide in your room...

380
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,210
and send the moonlight
to my room to make me jealous.

381
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:42,460
I can't enjoy the beautiful moonlight
in the garden alone.

382
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,510
That's what I came to tell you.

383
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:30,930
You threw this scarf and
called me, and here I am!

384
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,700
- No, I didn't.
- I misunderstood you?

385
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,710
Yes, you misunderstood.

386
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,900
I've never misunderstand women.

387
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,020
Such meetings that happen coincidentally...

388
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,620
are actually deliberate
more than destined.

389
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,306
Coincidentally, that day,
you were standing...

390
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,930
right where I had to pass.

391
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,550
It's also a coincidence
you're staying in my home.

392
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,630
And it's a coincidence
that you pass by me.

393
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,130
Today, when I was having
tea in the garden...

394
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,250
it was a coincidence that
your scarf fell on me.

395
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,140
Even this is a coincidence,
that you're very beautiful.

396
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,110
- Fear God.
- I don't fear anyone.

397
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,230
I don't fear life,
I don't fear death.

398
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:35,450
I only fear beauty, only beauty.

399
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,930
I'll meet you after
the festival tonight.

400
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,350
Don't forget.

401
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,860
Who is it?

402
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,550
Who is it?

403
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,990
Mr. Thakur, Mr. Thakur.

404
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,700
What happened to you?

405
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,170
Your idol.

406
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,310
I am very grateful to you.

407
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,040
You saved my life today.

408
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,970
The God who saved you
is in your hands.

409
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,000
I am nobody.

410
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:18,150
Yes, He's there. He's saved me
many times since childhood.

411
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,510
Today, you saved me.

412
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,710
Is there a connection
between you and this idol?

413
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,030
There is,
but perhaps you've forgotten.

414
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:47,990
- What?
- That I'm a devotee of Lord Shankar.

415
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:59,040
- What happened?
- There was a fire.

416
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,440
How?

417
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,680
Someone couldn't ignite my heart,
so set fire to my bed.

418
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,200
You're always joking.

419
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:12,560
Are you alright?

420
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,760
I'm so used to burning,
I never noticed the fire.

421
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,790
This priestess arrived,
or anything might have happened.

422
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,120
But how did she become
so concerned about you...

423
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,870
that she came to your room
in the middle of the night?

424
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,330
Is she responsible for the fire?

425
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:53,330
Shankar, what has
happened to you?

426
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,530
Do you have any relation
with this idol.

427
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,390
Yes I do. I think you've forgotten.

428
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:31,390
- Who is it?
- It's me, Thakur.

429
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,190
What do you want?

430
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,630
Nothing. I was strolling on the verandah
when I heard you humming.

431
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:43,670
I thought I'd come and ask
why you haven't gone to bed yet.

432
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,150
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- How can I?

433
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:52,240
The bed is burned.
There's water on the floor.

434
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,700
Then wake up the servants.

435
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,480
Why bother them at this hour?

436
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,280
I can't sleep anyway.

437
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:10,520
- Why haven't you slept yet?
- I was admiring the moonlight.

438
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,330
It's beautiful.

439
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,510
If you want to see the moonlight,
come and see it in the garden.

440
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,040
- Garden?
- Yes.

441
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:27,839
- At this hour?
- Yes.

442
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,590
The flowers look good
during the day.

443
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,450
But when you see
them at night...

444
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,920
they seems like stars floating
in a milky river.

445
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:49,029
When you held the idol close
to your heart...

446
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,710
for a moment I thought...

447
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,719
What did you think?

448
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:59,570
- That you're a priestess.
- That I am.

449
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,490
Your voice sounds familiar.

450
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,900
When I hear it, I feel...

451
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,110
like someone is calling
out from my childhood.

452
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,490
But that childhood has
been left far behind.

453
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,930
It's said that when man
reaches his maturity...

454
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,609
he begins to love new voices.

455
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,640
He can hear the music
of marriage.

456
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,580
Then he shouldn't care
for past voices.

457
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:45,289
How can you talk like that?

458
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,650
If you were left on one shore...

459
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,800
and your companion floated away
on the waves of time to the other...

460
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,020
wouldn't you try
to call him back?

461
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:04,600
No, I would never be so foolish.

462
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,620
Why do you call it foolishness?

463
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,460
Because the sea of life
and time is such...

464
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,660
that once a man crosses it,
he can never return.

465
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:23,230
And if the companion
across the shore...

466
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,390
is happy with his new friends...

467
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,440
but is made to cross the stormy waves
again only for the separated mate...

468
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,470
then the mate is being selfish.

469
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,280
You must be very much
at peace now.

470
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:53,170
Who wouldn't feel peace
at the Lord's feet?

471
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,830
Aren't you at peace?

472
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:03,930
No.

473
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,120
You always keep God's
image under your pillow.

474
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:14,460
- Still you don't feel at peace?
- That makes me even more restless.

475
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,200
You'll get married some day.

476
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,470
Then you'll get over
this restlessness.

477
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,460
Who told you getting married
gives one peace?

478
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,310
Then why are you
getting married?

479
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,070
Let's cut this out.

480
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,570
Tell me, do you like my fiancé?

481
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,740
Don't avoid my question.

482
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:48,880
And don't even lie.

483
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,610
You have my promise, tell me.

484
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,440
- No.
- Why?

485
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,160
- She isn't a good woman.
- I won't find a good woman.

486
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,560
Why not?
Aren't there good women in the world?

487
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,960
Those that are,
become priestesses like you.

488
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,770
And no one can propose
marriage to them.

489
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,240
Forget that. Tell me,
why is she not a good woman?

490
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,500
Why do you accuse her
of being no good?

491
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:23,310
- Because I know.
- What do you know?

492
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:28,590
That she traps wealthy men
and usurps their wealth.

493
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,410
That's her business.

494
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,950
I know all that.

495
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:36,820
I can even tell you the names
of men she has ruined.

496
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,280
- And still you are...
- I am marrying her.

497
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:42,680
And if she wants my money in return,
then I don't want my wealth at all.

498
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,160
This wealth gave me the most
painful wound in my life...

499
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,280
and now I'm taking revenge for it.

500
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,360
By throwing a few notes
I'm buying her talent and respect.

501
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,750
So that no one would
ever respect wealth again.

502
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:03,620
But you will also lose
your respect in this way.

503
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,430
So what?

504
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:11,100
Even if my life is taken away
from me, then how does it affect me?

505
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:16,440
Only true love can give peace of mind.

506
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,190
Without that the peace we
have is nothing but illusion.

507
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,560
Or defeat or another name for death.

508
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:31,040
And I'm not going to get
defeated by a woman for fake respect.

509
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,800
I found a woman's weakness.

510
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,990
A woman's biggest weakness
is her greed for wealth.

511
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,520
Now I'm taking
revenge with the same weapon.

512
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,280
But not all women are like that.

513
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:49,510
Your mother is a woman, too.

514
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:54,410
Mother! In all the books all
over the world have praised mothers.

515
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:58,120
But I count my mother
in the same category.

516
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,420
But your mother is so nice.

517
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,560
She's not my mother. She's a maid.

518
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,040
My mother passed away long ago.

519
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,150
You spent your life within the walls
of a temple. You don't know my story.

520
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:19,690
An intoxicated man forgets his path.

521
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,676
He starts walking in the
subconscious state hurting himself!

522
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,550
Because he doesn't
have any other option.

523
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,390
I don't deny my mistakes.

524
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,390
But wouldn't you have done the same
if you were in my place?

525
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,000
May God give you everything!

526
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,380
- Sir?
- Why?

527
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,780
I don't want to be a
burden on a husband and wife.

528
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:54,140
Say that you can't share
the burden of my slander.

529
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,990
If you're so stubborn...

530
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,600
then I can also forget you.

531
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,980
What happened, Thakur?

532
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,470
Nothing happened to Thakur.

533
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,670
Your Shankar is getting ruined.

534
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,480
But what happened?

535
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,350
- She's here?
- Who?

536
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,280
- Kamla.
- Where is she?

537
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,220
- She's in the adjoining room.
- In the adjoining room?

538
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:03,030
- She's Kamla?
- Yes, mother, she is Kamla.

539
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,880
But why are you sad,
now that you've met her?

540
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,400
I hoped to get her...

541
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,280
but now even that hope is dying.

542
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:19,580
But why?
Doesn't she realize you're Shankar?

543
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,500
- I think she's recognized me.
- Then?

544
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,660
But she's hiding her
identity from me.

545
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,220
She must be trying to fool you.
Wait, I'll go.

546
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,740
Don't do that! If she comes to
know we've recognised her...

547
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,970
she will leave.

548
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,250
But why?

549
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,280
Because she doesn't have a
very good opinion about me.

550
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:53,560
She feels that if I'm marrying Mohini,
I've no right to love her.

551
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:57,020
No one can snatch anyone's
right to love.

552
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,400
Only the price of love
can be demanded.

553
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:06,970
Just let me tell her once what
a big price you've paid...

554
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,050
- for her love.
- Do nothing of the sort.

555
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,680
Once she leaves,
I'll never be able to see her again.

556
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,090
Don't insist, mom.
Make her stay here longer.

557
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:24,550
So that before making the
last move of my destiny...

558
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,200
I'll at least see her enough.

559
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,090
Hello, madam. What's this?

560
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,340
The horses and guests are
waiting for you to go riding...

561
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,670
and you're not even dressed yet.

562
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,070
I won't be able to go
with you all today.

563
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,640
Why? Do you want to go
to the temple to pray?

564
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:55,100
No. Someone has forcibly
usurped someone's land.

565
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:00,870
The one whose land has been
usurped, cannot even complain.

566
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,980
I have to go and dispense justice.

567
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:12,110
You are so cruel, and people
ask for justice from you.

568
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,180
- When will you return?
- Why?

569
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,860
I won't be able to wait any longer.

570
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,930
Only God knows who
waits for whom.

571
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:07,600
Oh my heart, he has left

572
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:12,550
Love his memories now

573
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,910
There is no joy in living

574
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:31,720
Wait for death now

575
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:40,050
Oh my heart, he has left.
Love his memories now

576
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:07,420
What have you got to
do with happiness?

577
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,510
You are destined for sorrow

578
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:27,120
Stop expecting to be happy

579
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,760
Accept sorrow now

580
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:40,210
There is no joy in living.
Wait for death now

581
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:49,920
Oh my heart, he has left.
Love his memories now

582
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:10,630
Forget the days of joy

583
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:15,290
Don't dream of love

584
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:29,840
You surrendered your heart

585
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:34,690
Surrender your life now

586
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:39,680
There is no joy in living.
Wait for death now

587
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:10,260
An astrologer is here. Would
you like your hand read?

588
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,110
I don't need any astrologer.

589
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,780
Who doesn't need an astrologer?

590
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,650
Everyone wants to know what's
in store for him.

591
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:26,450
But one whose destiny has
already been ruined by time...

592
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:31,480
doesn't need an astrologer
to tell her about her ruin.

593
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,350
I won't mourn over
the past, lady.

594
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,910
I'll tell you what the future
has in store for you.

595
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,750
There is nothing left
in my future now.

596
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:48,240
All my joy was in my past,
which is gone along with the past.

597
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,040
- What is gone can return.
- Can time ever come back?

598
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,670
But friends lost can
always come back.

599
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,110
The man who left in
the morning...

600
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,420
aren't you waiting
for his return?

601
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,670
- Astrologer!
- Don't lie to an ascetic.

602
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:13,430
I can see the lines of your
forehead and tell...

603
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:16,470
that the one for whom you wait...

604
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:20,250
the one for who your heart is
restless, you are deceiving him.

605
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,090
I am deceiving him?

606
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:28,550
- Your knowledge says that?
- Yes, you are deceiving him.

607
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,800
Tell me.
Haven't you recognised him?

608
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:36,190
Look priestess, you must
not lie to pious souls.

609
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,610
I have recognised him.

610
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:43,510
Then why haven't you
told him who you are?

611
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,320
He is surrounded by darkness today.

612
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,310
And the lamp that can
brighten his life...

613
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,960
you're hiding that
lamp from him.

614
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,220
Why are you doing this?

615
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,430
That's where you are mistaken.

616
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:06,030
Just look at the facts.

617
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:11,650
He's collected the stars
and moon in his home.

618
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,050
My small lamp is of
no consequence there.

619
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,380
People will laugh at me.

620
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:24,746
People won't laugh at you,
but at he...

621
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:28,040
who collects fireflies
to eliminate the darkness.

622
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:33,100
Even he laughs at himself.
At least you have mercy on him.

623
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,030
Are you asking me
to show mercy on him...

624
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:38,886
or to beg for mercy from him?

625
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,610
He is begging
for mercy from you.

626
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,820
You can shed tears
for a stone idol.

627
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:47,620
But you don't have place for an
unfortunate man in your heart?

628
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,896
Do you want the one who
faltered and fell once...

629
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,510
- to fall into an even deeper pit?
- Don't say that!

630
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:56,130
You become an ascetic
to help the world.

631
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,840
Can't you take care
of even one soul?

632
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,020
What can I do for him now?

633
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,250
If I could, I wouldn't let him
out of my sight for a moment.

634
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:14,960
I would hide him and take him away
from this poisonous atmosphere.

635
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,450
I would save him
from this brightness...

636
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,240
which is blinding him.

637
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,490
But time has snatched
him from me.

638
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,180
Time has brought him back
to your feet, Kamla.

639
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,010
Hide him in your heart again, Kamla.

640
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,440
Hide him in your heart again.

641
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:50,030
Astrologer, Ms. Mohini
has called you.

642
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,690
And even madam.

643
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:57,280
Alright, come. I have
finished with her.

644
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,326
Priestess, if you feel I've
given you correct information...

645
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,750
give me a reward.

646
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:09,060
I'm a poor priestess. I have
nothing to give, but my life.

647
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,650
I'll tell Ms. Mohini her future.

648
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:25,630
- Madam...
- Come, sir, sit down.

649
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:42,430
You have very sharp brains.

650
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,680
- But...
- But what?

651
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,680
But your heart is crooked.

652
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,470
What do you mean?

653
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:01,050
I'll tell you later. Right now,
I see something more dangerous.

654
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:06,370
You're going to suffer
a big deception in soon.

655
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,200
How?

656
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:13,930
- Don't ask me that.
- Why?

657
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,406
You must not ask everything
from astrologers.

658
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:20,900
They'll expose you.

659
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:24,490
Answer my question.
What deception will I suffer?

660
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,160
Well, if you want to
hear it, then listen.

661
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:34,030
You've succeeded in plundering
many rich men before now.

662
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:41,680
But currently, you're
involved with a man...

663
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,620
who is cheating you.

664
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,740
You think he's rich,
but he doesn't have a penny.

665
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:51,380
He is neck deep in debts.

666
01:27:55,860 --> 01:28:00,000
He's after the wealth you've
accumulated from cheating others.

667
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,850
I'll warn you not to let
yourself get involved, madam.

668
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:08,100
You impudent man!
Get out of here!

669
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:12,436
I'm going. But at least
pay me my fee.

670
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,080
You talk nonsense
and ask for fees?

671
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:18,226
How am I at fault?
It was written in your hand.

672
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:20,660
I said, get out, or
you'll be thrown out!

673
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,120
If you throw out an ascetic,
he'll curse you!

674
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:26,700
Servants! Throw him out!

675
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:17,570
I was so scared without you.

676
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:22,140
- Really?
- As if you care.

677
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:27,890
Let anyone wait all day long
for you, but you're too busy.

678
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:37,180
What can I say? Managing
an estate is hard work.

679
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,340
What work do you have to do?

680
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,390
I have to give and
take in millions.

681
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,100
But you only have to take,
not give money to anyone.

682
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:52,040
- Why not?
- To whom?

683
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,570
To those who've lent me money..

684
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,600
But why do you worry
about all that?

685
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:02,920
How can I not be worried
when you are?

686
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,060
Have you borrowed money from anyone?

687
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,110
Yes, about half a million rupees.

688
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,590
Don't lie to me!

689
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,240
Those who owe half a million...

690
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:21,530
don't look as carefree as you.

691
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,890
Don't get fooled by my face.

692
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,230
I see you and my face glows.

693
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:35,080
And, truly speaking,
when I have you I fear nothing.

694
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:40,730
At the most, my debtors will
take away my estate from me.

695
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,770
I'll still have the wealth
of your beauty.

696
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,660
But I do regret one thing.

697
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,870
I've squandered my wealth
on others before now.

698
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:56,870
But I couldn't give you anything.

699
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,820
But then, I think, that's not necessary.
You truly love me.

700
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,530
How fortunate I am!

701
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:12,270
Come out of your dream
world and listen to me.

702
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,090
Tell me. Say what
you have to now.

703
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,890
Such opportunities
don't come every day.

704
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:20,960
- I want to return tomorrow.
- Why?

705
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:25,100
My mom is alone at home.
And I had a bad dream last night.

706
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:28,660
- At night or during the day?
- Don't joke!

707
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,970
I'm not joking.
It's not the time to joke.

708
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,470
Two loving hearts are separating.

709
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,550
- Why does this happen, Mohini?
- What?

710
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:40,950
Why does destiny separate
two lovers?

711
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,690
I'm a man.
I can bear this pain.

712
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:49,340
But how will you survive
without me, Mohini?

713
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,040
I'll arrange for your departure tomorrow.
But on one condition.

714
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:57,350
- What?
- You won't shed tears for me.

715
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:00,490
See! You're already crying.

716
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,190
Stop them. Don't let them fall,
or I'll feel terrible!

717
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:26,930
Got time to spare?

718
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:32,420
Yes, I have the time now, forever.

719
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,100
Do you know what she was saying?

720
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:40,690
I don't want to know.

721
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:48,370
Don't turn away from
me like that.

722
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:51,720
I begin to feel lost.

723
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,000
These lonely nights are witness...

724
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:01,920
to how much this man has been
looking for you, fighting against time.

725
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:06,600
You'll be commiting a sin
if you turn away from me.

726
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,750
When have I ever
turned against you, Shankar?

727
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,556
Why are you making false
allegations against me?

728
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,380
How can I trust you?

729
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:18,430
I fear you may consider
me bad and discard me.

730
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:23,740
Why? Is this what
you expect of me?

731
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,130
Not expect, I fear it.

732
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,930
Just tell me once,
and this fear will disappear.

733
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:42,920
- What can I say?
- Don't say, just do.

734
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:47,030
- Do what?
- Kiss this sinner once with your lips.

735
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:51,900
So that this lifeless body comes
alive again with the elixir.

736
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,340
I'll close my eyes, Kamal.

737
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:02,330
Give me whatever you want.
Life, or death.

738
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:19,650
My life was so barren
without you...

739
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,230
that today, despite having got you,
I can't believe it.

740
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:27,640
You're standing before me,
but my heart doesn't believe it.

741
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:32,850
It tells me, This is all
an illusion, a dream.

742
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,250
Don't believe it.

743
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,340
This dream will deceive you again.
Don't believe in it.

744
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,030
Beware of it, Shankar!

745
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:53,850
Make me believe you have
actually come to me.

746
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,240
Shower me with your tears...

747
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,830
so that all my illusions,
my fears, are washed away.

748
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,930
You're removing me from this hell
and taking me into heaven.

749
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,460
If this isn't a dream...

750
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:18,870
I'm ready to pay the price
of my entire life for it.

751
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:23,720
I'm ready to pay the price
of my entire life for it.

752
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:31,800
Thakur, you don't have the
money to strike this deal.

753
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:35,150
- Mother...
- The soul that's renounced this world...

754
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,406
don't take it towards ruin.

755
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,130
We aren't going towards ruin.

756
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,220
We want to be saved from ruin.

757
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,260
To be saved from ruin,
go to the feet of God.

758
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,500
Don't you fear steering someone
away from her path?

759
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:54,610
There is fear in sin,
and love isn't sin, Mother.

760
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,820
Lost in your darkness,
you've become blind, Thakur.

761
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,800
You can't see sense.

762
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,710
The flame of love
gives sight even to the blind.

763
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:08,140
I may be a sinner, but God forgives
the sins of those who love truly.

764
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:13,070
Come, Kamal.

765
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:24,290
If I have ever wronged you in
any way, please forgive me.

766
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:30,500
You have never wronged me.
God be with you.

767
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:36,570
Love broke...

768
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:41,550
all bonds

769
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:48,580
Against love...

770
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:59,060
the world accepted defeat

771
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:17,170
My beloved took over my heart

772
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:20,740
My heart bloomed...

773
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,530
and love smiled

774
01:37:24,810 --> 01:37:27,930
A mischievous wind blew

775
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:31,460
Every bud bloomed

776
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:45,920
I was reunited with you

777
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:59,670
My beloved took over my heart

778
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,600
Everything seems different

779
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:27,630
Even the earth and sky seem new

780
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:37,760
We left the world...

781
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:44,980
and created a new world
of love for ourselves

782
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,280
The winds came dancing...

783
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:52,070
having kissed the blue skies...

784
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:56,050
and erased all scars of sorrow

785
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,940
I had no happiness

786
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,800
My heart's bud had not bloomed

787
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,090
Love's arrow had not
pierced my heart

788
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:23,900
I wasn't really living life

789
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:26,940
The sound of your feet...

790
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,680
brought along smiles...

791
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:34,630
and made my life

792
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:52,150
The season of Spring
brought along lavish love

793
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:02,880
My heart called out to you

794
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:20,480
You arrived from somewhere

795
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:24,270
You slowly smiled...

796
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:27,890
And filled my heart with joy

797
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:31,260
The winds came dancing

798
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:16,240
What happened, Kamal?
What happened?

799
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:27,150
- Ghost.
- Ghost? It came here, too?

800
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,610
No, don't go up.

801
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,850
You have my promise,
don't go up.

802
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,510
What mystery is this?
Whose ghost is this?

803
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,760
You don't even tell me anything.

804
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:59,500
It's a very sad story.

805
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:03,270
You'll get upset if you hear it.

806
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:06,530
I won't be at peace
if I don't hear about it.

807
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:11,540
Look Kamal, we'll get married tomorrow
and leave this place.

808
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:17,280
I'll tell you everything then.
But don't ask me anything here.

809
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:23,170
Just have faith in me.
Have faith in me.

810
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:28,530
Tomorrow? Have all arrangements
been made?

811
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:34,380
Two people who love each other
will get married tomorrow.

812
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:36,980
No arrangements are necessary.

813
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,980
When two hearts unite...

814
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:46,050
you don't need guests,
or the priest for such a marriage.

815
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:54,760
Two lovers unite.

816
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,800
May you always be happy.

817
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:35,520
No dear, I am just a maid.

818
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,580
No mother.

819
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:42,910
This home was engulfed in
darkness without you.

820
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,410
Now that you're here...

821
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:50,860
it seems the dark night stole
the moon and brightened itself.

822
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,110
You made Thakur
wait for so long.

823
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,250
Madam, where do I put the sweets?

824
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,330
I'll be right back.

825
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:59,060
What are you doing?
Mother will come.

826
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,140
Let her come.

827
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,240
Why are you staring
at me like that?

828
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,910
I've been wanting to see you
as a bride forever.

829
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:17,570
If you only knew how much
my heart has waited for this moment.

830
01:46:24,570 --> 01:46:29,080
Someone will see.
You're not even embarrassed.

831
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,600
All restrictions will be removed today.

832
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,290
- And then you...
- You...

833
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:40,200
Don't say anything now.
Just keep looking at me.

834
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:48,830
I see my days, my nights,
my life, in your eyes.

835
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,386
It seems like far away
in some lake...

836
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:55,530
a mansion has been
made by moon rays.

837
01:46:58,130 --> 01:47:01,570
And to reach there, the
stars have lit our way.

838
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:04,610
You and I walk towards it.

839
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:15,890
And now, you two accept
each other as husband and wife.

840
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:24,180
Keep faith in each other and speak,
repeating after me.

841
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,130
First you say, Thakur...

842
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:32,100
'I accept Kamla as
my wife from today.'

843
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:35,346
I accept Kamla as
my wife from today.

844
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:37,180
Wait! This marriage
cannot take place!

845
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:45,390
- Get out of here!
- Whenever I come, you threaten me.

846
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:48,150
Why are you afraid of me?
I won't eat you.

847
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,050
- Listen carefully!
- I don't have time for your nonsense.

848
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:56,630
Go away, or you'll be
thrown out of here!

849
01:47:56,990 --> 01:48:00,800
Say what you like.
It's your mouth.

850
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:03,980
But I won't let this
marriage take place.

851
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:08,180
Having one wife already,
you cannot marry again.

852
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:12,160
- Society has given me that right.
- You sold that right.

853
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,970
You agreed to the deal,
and now you're backing out?

854
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,926
Shame on you!

855
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:22,490
You're doing an injustice
to the one whose money you live on.

856
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:25,710
Did you win this huge estate
from gambling?

857
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,130
Have you forgotten your promise?

858
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,590
Don't you remember the
deal you struck at all?

859
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,800
What a shame!

860
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,120
I've never made any deals with you.

861
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:40,870
If my mother promised you anything,
I'm unaware of it.

862
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,820
Nor am I responsible for it.

863
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,180
I have done whatever
I could for your sister.

864
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:50,390
And I want nothing
from you in return.

865
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,990
Take back your estate, your title.
I want nothing.

866
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:57,010
I'll leave here this very day.

867
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:00,880
So, you don't remember
the promise your mother made?

868
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:03,470
You don't remember the marriage
the priest performed?

869
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,040
Perhaps you also don't remember
that Sheela...

870
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:10,480
whose very mention makes you go pale,
is your wife.

871
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:14,030
Shame on you! You are lying!

872
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,470
He is himself mad,
but makes allegations against us.

873
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:19,370
He calls my sister mad.

874
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:23,090
She was absolutely normal.
He drove her mad.

875
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:25,160
He stole her peace of mind.

876
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,820
He did something to her.

877
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,900
She was fine?
I did something to her?

878
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:35,966
All of you come with me
and see for yourself...

879
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:38,190
that no one can go near
the one he's calling my wife.

880
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,460
Why are you so scared?

881
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,290
She is no ghost or witch.

882
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:34,280
She's my wife,
the mistress of this house.

883
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:37,870
My comfort in happiness and sorrow.

884
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:43,050
If you want to see the curse of life,
go and see this mad woman.

885
01:51:43,670 --> 01:51:45,670
This gift has been given
to me by you people.

886
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:52,430
I've been sold. My peace and
happiness have been sold.

887
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:56,880
For wealth and money,
I was handed over to this witch.

888
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:01,860
Don't be afraid. Come and see
the horrendous face of justice.

889
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:06,000
See the justice of the God
whose huge temples you build.

890
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,056
And then see this woman who
spews the fire of hell...

891
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,480
with her every breath.

892
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:13,190
And then see the eyes of
this innocent woman...

893
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,510
in which you'll find the solace
of heaven. Everything...

894
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,860
Kamla, open the door!

895
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:47,100
Kamla, it's me, Shankar.
Open the door.

896
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:17,890
Sad about leaving?

897
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:36,470
You've come so late. I've been
waiting for you for so long.

898
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:43,260
It seems like aeons have passed.

899
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,300
Don't you want to touch
someone else's husband?

900
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:57,410
You must be thinking
what a bad man I am.

901
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,220
What a sinner I am.

902
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:06,010
Look Kamal, abuse me if you like...

903
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:09,410
but please don't remain
silent like this.

904
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,460
Say whatever you want.

905
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:15,930
I want to leave.

906
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,430
So, you want to ruin me?

907
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:26,930
I want to save your honor.

908
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:31,430
I cannot stay here.

909
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,070
Who's asking you
to stay here, Kamal?

910
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:36,780
We'll both leave here.

911
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:39,340
And never come back.

912
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,440
No.

913
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:44,710
Because I'm another woman's husband?

914
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:50,470
You don't love me, Kamal?

915
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:53,870
You want a husband
that belongs only to you...

916
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,070
whose everything belongs to you.

917
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,110
You love a man's status,
not him.

918
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:06,300
You don't know how much
I love you, Kamal.

919
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:10,120
But perhaps you don't
believe me anymore.

920
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:13,320
You must be wondering why
I didn't tell you beforehand.

921
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:17,160
I didn't tell you because
my sorrow hurts you, too.

922
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,340
And I considered her my sorrow,
not a relationship.

923
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:25,470
There's no bond in the world
which can defeat the storm of love.

924
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:29,670
And when you ride this storm,
why are you afraid?

925
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:35,810
I found love for only a few moments,
and then lost it.

926
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:48,440
You are making the decision
after knowing only one side of the story.

927
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:52,580
Why don't you think of the one
who found you after all these years?

928
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:55,980
And who is not ready
to lose you at any cost.

929
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,320
You've heard only half
the story, Kamal.

930
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:02,460
You're not aware of all
I've suffered over the years.

931
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,670
At least hear the story of
my ruin before you leave.

932
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,040
Even that was a similar dark night...

933
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,660
when you'd given me
that idol and left.

934
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:19,790
I didn't know where you were.

935
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:24,110
My eyes would look out for you
at the sound of every footstep.

936
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:29,120
My feet never faltered
in desiring you, Kamal.

937
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:33,980
But I finally had to give up.

938
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:38,350
I was given all the luxuries of life...

939
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:44,960
but pushed towards ruin anyway.

940
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:48,870
The fear of poverty made
my mother sell me...

941
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:50,900
and she celebrated the deal.

942
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:01,670
I was watching myself being ruined.

943
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:07,060
I knew my death was hidden in
these silver and golden stars.

944
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,230
And I saw this death in
my wife on first sight.

945
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:19,556
She was mad.
Her smile was venomous...

946
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:21,480
but I had taken the
price of this venom.

947
02:00:34,850 --> 02:00:36,810
I was engulfed in scary darkness.

948
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:41,100
I wanted to run away
from that hell.

949
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:46,770
But I felt that frightful
witches were following me.

950
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,590
They were screaming and
asking me to stop.

951
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:53,410
Their lips were thirsting
for my blood.

952
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:56,750
The fire in their breath
was desperate to burn me.

953
02:00:57,330 --> 02:00:59,160
They were asking me
to stop and listen.

954
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:03,440
And then I found a new way
of escape for myself.

955
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:07,970
Those screams got buried
in the sound of anklets.

956
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:13,520
The venom of their laughter was lost
in the smiles of other women.

957
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:23,170
The beating of drums and other music
echoed in my ears.

958
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:27,760
For some time the shine of money
eliminated the darkness around me.

959
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:35,860
But who can find solace
in the depths of humiliation?

960
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:40,390
When alone, my heart
always told me...

961
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:44,790
I had strayed far from my goal.

962
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:50,320
At such times, I would kiss
the idol you had given me.

963
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,810
I used to ask
for pardon from you.

964
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:11,900
What else can a man,
alone and gone astray, do?

965
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,740
And when I had lost everything...

966
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:25,330
you suddenly came as a star
and peeked into my ruin.

967
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:29,190
That day, when I saw you hold
the idol close to your heart...

968
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:31,110
I recognised you immediately.

969
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:36,420
- And I felt...
- Enough! Stop it.

970
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:40,350
Don't talk about the past now.

971
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,200
There's no point in talking
about the past, either...

972
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,520
when the future belongs to us.

973
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:48,650
I've found you now, Kamal.

974
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:53,410
Your arrival makes me feel
the holy Ganga has come to the sinner.

975
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,140
I don't fear anything now.

976
02:02:57,410 --> 02:03:03,810
Hold my hand, and ask me to take you
to a new world of our own.

977
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:09,010
The river doesn't go dry
when it comes to the thirsty.

978
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:12,690
- Come close to me.
- No!

979
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:21,120
Do you want to leave me alone
in that bad world...

980
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:24,800
and confine yourself
to stone walls?

981
02:03:26,350 --> 02:03:29,330
Just think how bleak my life
will become without you.

982
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:35,380
Don't reject the one who loves you
and who you loved, Kamal.

983
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:39,640
A sinner who you can reform,
don't send him to the devil.

984
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,650
He'll never be able to reform again.

985
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,840
God will give you good sense.
He only will save you.

986
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:50,070
God will save me? And you?

987
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:53,570
I'll pray for you.

988
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:58,830
The hands that can lift in prayer...

989
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:01,950
can also save a falling man.

990
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,820
Religion doesn't permit that.

991
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:09,196
Does your religion say
you shouldn't help a man...

992
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:12,150
fallen in muck,
because you might soil your clothes?

993
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,920
You have loved, Kamal.

994
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:18,980
Like other selfish women,
why are you afraid of society?

995
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:23,760
Ask your heart once.
Doesn't your heart say anything?

996
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:26,610
I won't listen to my heart.

997
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:30,120
It's crazy for you.

998
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:33,000
Don't test me like that.

999
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,590
- Let me go.
- Wait Kamal!

1000
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:49,310
Do you still want to go, Kamal?

1001
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:53,510
Yes.

1002
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:05,420
Then go. If I want,
I can compel you to stay.

1003
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:11,220
But then I'll only get your
body, not your soul.

1004
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:14,690
I don't want a body
without a soul.

1005
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:18,050
I can get many bodies.

1006
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:23,160
Kamal, if you don't
love me, leave!

1007
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:25,910
Don't ever think of me.

1008
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,650
And don't forgive my sins.

1009
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,590
May God grant you peace.

1010
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:07,960
Don't go, Kamal, don't go.

1011
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,180
Don't go, Kamal.

1012
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:37,410
Where are you,
oh comfort of my life?

1013
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:40,120
My heart calls out to you

1014
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:49,270
With our separation,
my desires shed tears

1015
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:30,900
You left,
having lost esteem for me

1016
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:48,160
Oh tormentor

1017
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:54,480
My heart looks out for you

1018
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:35,650
There are tormented
desires in my eyes

1019
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:52,340
See this storm in my eyes

1020
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:58,560
Come back, this heart
cries in pain

1021
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:31,990
Where are you?

1022
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:36,900
I hope you have no attachments
left with the world now.

1023
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,600
No.

1024
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:43,850
Then this full moon, we'll
have you cleansed.

1025
02:10:53,410 --> 02:10:54,810
What are you doing?

1026
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:57,740
Lightning couldn't uproot it.
So I'm uprooting the tree.

1027
02:10:57,870 --> 02:11:02,990
How far will you dig? The
roots are very deep.

1028
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:07,596
If lightning couldn't uproot it,
how will you uproot it?

1029
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:11,440
Then what do I do? Why have
the roots gone so deep?

1030
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:16,810
Don't be foolish.
Come upstairs. Come.

1031
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:34,060
People think I'm mad.

1032
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:52,230
For God's sake, please leave.

1033
02:11:53,490 --> 02:11:55,350
You're making me steer
away from my religion.

1034
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:16,780
Get up, Kamla, it's four AM.
Get dressed before prayers.

1035
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:19,470
The ritual of cleansing you
will be performed today.

1036
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:19,870
So that your cleansing
ritual is complete...

1037
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:25,800
burn all your worldly desires
in this holy fire.

1038
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:56,400
Do you have an attachment
with anyone in the world now?

1039
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:06,220
No.

1040
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:17,460
What about Shankar? Shankar,
where are you?

1041
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,140
Who are you?

1042
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:21,020
I was just collecting
the burned things.

1043
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:23,520
How did this mansion catch fire?

1044
02:16:25,390 --> 02:16:28,280
Thakur's mad wife set it afire.

1045
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:30,340
Did everyone survive?

1046
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:33,590
- No. - Who?
- The mad woman.

1047
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:39,450
- Did the Thakur survive?
- It would be better if he hadn't.

1048
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,630
Why, what happened?
Where did he go?

1049
02:16:44,549 --> 02:16:48,009
To his old house,
where he lived before.

1050
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,460
Who is it?

1051
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,580
Who are you?

1052
02:17:48,770 --> 02:17:53,460
How did you come here?
Is it night already?

1053
02:17:55,430 --> 02:17:57,220
Day has broken only now, Shankar.

1054
02:17:59,190 --> 02:18:01,400
But you come only at night,
in my dreams.

1055
02:18:03,209 --> 02:18:05,349
I haven't come in your dream.

1056
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:13,740
You want to deceive me
because I've gone blind?

1057
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:17,430
Kamla won't come here now.

1058
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:21,510
I've been blinded.
I have nothing left.

1059
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:27,910
She loves God.
She loves stone idols.

1060
02:18:31,770 --> 02:18:33,470
Why will she come to any human?

1061
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:35,440
But what about your love?

1062
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:39,620
Love? What has a woman
got to do with love?

1063
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,370
You're just a dream in my imagination.

1064
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:51,620
That's why you come to me.

1065
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:59,200
You are crying?
Even you are crying today?

1066
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:05,340
You've taken such a big price from me
for this one tear of sympathy.

1067
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:10,550
- Such a big price!
- Shankar, forgive me!

1068
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:13,990
Forgive me, Shankar.

1069
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:16,620
I'm not angry with you.

1070
02:19:18,379 --> 02:19:19,839
You're just a dream.

1071
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:23,940
Even if Kamla actually came,
I would forgive her.

1072
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:28,670
Why just forgive?
I love her even today.

1073
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:33,190
I love her even today.

1074
02:19:47,010 --> 02:19:52,020
Shankar, Kamla has come,
and you don't even recognise her?

1075
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:57,900
I've been blinded, but even you
have begun to dream like me?

1076
02:19:59,210 --> 02:20:02,620
No, she's not a dream.
Kamla has actually come.

1077
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:06,280
- She's come?
- Yes.

1078
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:11,810
Then ask her to call out to me.

1079
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:21,230
- Are you really Kamla?
- Yes.

1080
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:30,880
- Honest?
- Yes Shankar, I am your Kamla.

1081
02:20:31,970 --> 02:20:33,730
I knew you would come one day.

1082
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:38,420
But not your love.
My love will draw you to me.

1083
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:42,280
Forgive me, Shankar.

1084
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:51,500
You took so long to come.
