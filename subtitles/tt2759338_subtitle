1
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,870
Who is it?

2
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
Overtake him.

3
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,790
I've been honking for so long.

4
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,370
But he doesn't seem to comply.

5
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,830
Honk again.

6
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh, so it's you.

7
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,130
I had no clue that
you were on the bike.

8
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,550
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have asked my driver to honk.

9
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,210
I would've told him to run you down.

10
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,630
An army of mice can't
hunt down a lion.

11
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,750
Do I have to request all of you?

12
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Go on.

13
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,500
Are you going to kill me now?

14
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,050
Rudra Pratap Chauhan.

15
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,050
Encounter Specialist.

16
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,300
You arrested me two.

17
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,750
But nothing happened.

18
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,340
I got bail in a jiffy.

19
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,340
One more thing.

20
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,420
I don't think you have
a chance this time either.

21
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Look there, here comes the cavalry.

22
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,300
One bullet, one enemy.

23
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,630
2 meters distance,
and a few inches of grave!

24
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,800
File closed!

25
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,630
Hello sir.

26
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,210
Hello sir.

27
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,590
Sir. Sir.

28
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,800
Sir...you caused an
earthquake on arrival.

29
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,550
Even I want to score
half century, sir.

30
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,800
I mean, why didn't you
take me along as well, sir?

31
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Even I could've caused some fireworks.

32
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,590
And killed those brothers-in-law.

33
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,550
Brothers-in-law?

34
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,500
!

35
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,420
Fine, be ready to
celebrate on next Diwali.

36
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,090
And for sweets as well.

37
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,130
Sweets?

38
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,210
Meaning, your SP madam
will call me in now.

39
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,840
For some sweets.

40
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,460
May I come in?

41
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,750
Officer, there are other methods to do
your job other than shooting someone.

42
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
A Policeman must display
responsible behaviour.

43
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,050
And especially you, because the
entire state have their eyes on you.

44
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,420
And, why did you
have to shoot Pandari?

45
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,500
Can you tell me why?

46
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,710
One doesn't need
permission to kill rats.

47
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,300
Get out!

48
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,380
Out!

49
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,170
I am sorry.

50
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,050
I am sorry...

51
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,340
Rudra, I am the boss in the office.

52
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,380
But you're the boss at home.

53
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,750
Sorry!

54
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,590
I know I was a little rude back there.

55
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,920
But you know, Rudra, that
I was only speaking for your good.

56
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,300
Killing people is
not the only solution.

57
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,750
Huh...

58
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,550
People like them only understand
the language of violence.

59
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,880
But I feel...my Rudra is lost
somewhere in all this commotion.

60
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,380
Madam...

61
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,550
Madam...

62
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Search the room.

63
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,420
Don't miss a single object.

64
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,590
- Question the staff as well.
- Yes, ma'am.

66
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,210
I was on duty here all night, sir.

67
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,420
I just left for a
while to have my dinner.

68
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,920
In fact, the warden herself
told me to go have my dinner.

69
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,920
- That's all I know, sir.
- Okay.

70
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,300
- Send the bodies for post-mortem.
- Okay, ma'am.

71
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,710
When did you last
talk to your daughter?

72
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,460
Our daughter called us last evening.

73
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,880
She sounded very happy.

74
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,920
I don't think my daughter
can ever do such a thing.

75
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,800
She can never commit suicide.

76
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,840
But the evidence that we found
suggests that they committed suicide.

77
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,590
The question is why?

78
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,050
Madam, our daughter
can never commit suicide.

79
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,550
Never.

80
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,090
Look, you can go for now.

81
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,050
Yes, madam.

82
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,670
But the Police can call you
for investigations at any time.

83
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,670
- Honey.
- No madam, sugar.

84
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,050
- Honey Singh.
- Yes, madam.

85
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,750
- Take their statements, please.
- Yes, madam.

86
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,590
Come, follow me.

87
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,300
Yes.

88
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,630
As the Education Minister
of this Statement...

89
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,750
...what is your opinion about the
incident that occurred in the college?

90
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,710
Look, I've given an ultimatum
to the Chief Minister...

91
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,300
...and, he's assured
me that the investigation

92
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,460
...under the supervision
of SP Aditi Singh

93
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,710
will be fast-tracked.

94
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,590
A government that cannot assure the
security of women in their own college...

95
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,250
...has no right to stay in power.

96
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,630
No, right at all.

97
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,960
But I request the media to
stop making a hype of this case.

98
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,460
And I want the Chief Minister to resign
from his post with immediate effect.

99
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,630
I've to attend a meeting.

100
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,170
Only after the party meeting, place.

101
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,420
And, I say this out loud.

102
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,800
A woman's honour,
is the country's honour.

103
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,170
And this incident demands
an unbiased investigation.

104
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,750
Immediately.

105
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,710
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

106
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

107
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,420
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

108
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,050
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

109
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,340
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

110
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,960
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

111
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,170
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

112
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,300
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

113
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,170
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

114
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,050
Madam, reports.

115
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,340
Madam, we found four
dead bodies in the room.

116
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
But there were 5 blood
samples in the room.

117
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,130
And the 5th blood sample
didn't belong to the warden.

118
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,840
What?

119
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,800
Are you positive that the 5th blood
sample doesn't belong to the warden?

120
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,210
Positive?

121
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,250
Madam, believe me.

122
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,920
Honey Singh giving scientific answer.

123
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,050
Smallmouth big talking.

124
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,050
This suicide mystery
is as complicated as Jalebi?

125
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,210
Jalebi?

126
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,880
Twisted and tasty.

127
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,250
Morning, sir.

128
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,750
Morning, sir.

129
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,630
Sit.

130
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,300
Now speak.

131
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,250
What is your opinion about
the incident at the Women's college

132
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,130
and the poor administrative
condition of the city?

133
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,920
The Women's College is an
respective organisation of our state.

134
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,460
The entire state is
proud of this organisation.

135
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I strongly condemn the
incident that occurred there.

136
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,710
We'll investigate to find out the reason behind
why those three girls committed suicide?

137
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,750
I have faith in the Law and Order.

138
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:30,460
That's why I've been receiving
the love of my people.

139
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,960
But what about those dozens of incidents
that have been occurring in this state.

140
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,880
Kidnapping.
Murder. Rape. Businessmen fleeing.

141
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,920
Will the people be able to maintain
their faith in you in such condition?

142
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,630
Hey...

143
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,960
Enough!

144
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,170
You've said enough.

145
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,460
Don't try to show that only the media
cares for the people, and we don't.

146
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,340
Don't try to conspire.

147
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,210
I am a Minister for the poor and
the underprivileged and the exploited.

148
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,420
If people like you were the
only well-wishers of the people...

149
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
...then I wouldn't be winning
the elections three times.

150
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,300
Although you're talking nonsense.

151
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,050
But you tell me what I should do.

152
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,210
I'll do that for your sake.

153
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,750
Sir, daring Police officer
Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan.

154
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,920
The public's demand is to reinstate him
in the State Crime Branch Headquarters.

155
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,670
Done.

156
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,710
I respect daring Police officers.

157
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,460
But...troubling innocent
people in the name of honesty...

158
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,750
...pressing false charges against them,

159
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:12,920
deeming people as criminal
on the basis of their caste.

160
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,920
And working only for medals
and applause is completely wrong.

161
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,500
I don't want any Police officer
to trouble the people of my state.

162
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,670
That's it.

163
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,590
- PA...
- Sir.

164
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:38,130
Tell DGP sir to reinstate Rudra Pratap Singh
back to Crime Branch with immediate effect.

165
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,000
- Order.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay.

167
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,050
Bless all of you.

168
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,550
Bless all of you.

169
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,550
Aditi.

170
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,670
That suicide case?

171
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,960
It's not a suicide.

172
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,750
How can you see that?

173
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,880
Because the prime evidences
of suicide say otherwise.

174
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,380
Four dead bodies
and five blood samples.

175
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,170
It has to be a case
of cold-blooded murder.

176
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,210
Rudra.

177
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,840
I think I need your help.

178
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,460
But you know what my methods are.

179
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,420
You will never change.

180
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,880
Look Rudra,
you must change your methods slightly.

181
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,050
For me.

182
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,630
Because I don't want
you to get transferred again.

183
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,920
I mean first Bangalore, then Mumbai,
Delhi, Kolkata, and now here.

184
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:16,920
Please.

185
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,750
For me.

186
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,380
For you...I will try.

187
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,840
No.

188
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,710
This is not their handwriting at all.

189
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,960
I want to see all the objects which
the Police recovered from this room.

190
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,880
Sir.

191
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,420
Dubey.

192
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,250
Get the bag.

193
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,170
Here they are, sir.

194
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,800
I want all the details
of this sim card.

195
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,250
Call log. Last call.

196
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay.

197
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,090
And go to the back and find out...

198
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,750
...in whose name is this
500,000 rupees payslip.

199
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,500
There has to be a cash trail to this.

200
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,420
I want details of all the girls
that stay in the college hostel.

201
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,800

202
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,380

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,590
Sir, the call's connected.

208
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,380
Good afternoon, sir.

209
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,050
The issue...is a little serious.

210
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,340
So I called personally.

211
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,710
The female suicide case
which you are investigation...

212
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
...you must reach some
conclusion quickly.

213
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,090
Sir, the Police are doing their job.

214
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,210
I assure you that the Police
will soon reach some conclusion.

215
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,750
It's what i expect from
Police officers like you.

216
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,500
Yes.

217
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,170
But please remember that the
Opposition don't make an issue out of it.

218
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,050
Yes, sir.

219
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,800
Better explain to your
Department's Superman.

220
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,420
Don't be too trigger happy.

221
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,050
And do his job within
the limits of the Law.

222
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,880
Sir.

223
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,130
Start counting.

224
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,130
101...

225
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,710
102...

226
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,960

227
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,380

Okay, SP Aditi Sing.

You ask him, sir.

245

He's the senior,
although he doesn't look like it,

246
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,670

Take a left.

264
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,920
Hello.

265
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,050
Rudra, I've got two important numbers.

266
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,880
Note them down.

267
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,630
This is it, sir.

268
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,050
12/272.

269
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,960
Watch me.

270
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,750
Is Ramesh Dubey at home.

271
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,420
There is no Ramesh Dubey here.

272
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,460
He doesn't.

273
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,460
He doesn't live here.

274
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,380
But sir, the bank gave this address.

275
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,170
12/272.

276
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,920
Ask her.

277
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,880
I am asking her.

278
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
- How long have you been living here?
- 10 years, sir.

279
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,880
I see...

280
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,460
Dulare, wait.

281
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,590
Fake identity,
fake address, fake everything, sir.

282
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,380
You know what, go back to the bank.

283
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,670
Again bank, sir.

284
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,250
Is there a problem, Honey Singh?

285
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,670
No, sir.

286
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,300
Good.

287
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,420
Go back.

288
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,750
Yes, sir. Going, sir.

289
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,250
Back to the bank.

290
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,670
- Details are not up-to-date, sir.
- Doesn't matter.

291
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,250
When was the last transaction made?

292
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,340
On Wednesday 6 pm.

293
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,880
Money was withdrawn from
the Sunder Nagar ATM, sir.

294
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,710
Wednesday evening... 6...

295
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,000
- On the day of the murder.
- Yes, sir.

296
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,000
Anyway...I want to
check the CCTV footage.

297
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,960
Sorry sir, actually...

298
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,710
I said i want to
check the CCTV footage.

299
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,500
Now.

300
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,880
Sir.

301
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,460
- Is this the footage?
- Yes, sir.

302
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,210
Slow it down.

303
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,340
- Is this at 6:30?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:11,880
Pause it.

305
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,050
I want a picture of this man.

306
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,130
Sir, that looks like
Contractor Pandey.

307
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,590
Yes, looks like him.

308
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,090
Do you know him?

309
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:21,800
Yes, of course.

310
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,170
He's a big sycophant of the Ministers.

311
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,210
- Shankar.
- Greetings, brother-in-law.

312
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,590
- Where are you these days?
- What's wrong?

313
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,500
Go and check why that Police officer
took Pandey to the Police Station.

314
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,420
Yes.

315
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,670
Find out what's the issue.

316
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,670
- And call me back.
- Okay.

317
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,000
Bring him here.

318
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,710
Great.

319
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,340
How did you get hold of
the debit card of Ramesh Dubey?

320
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,800
Ramesh Dubey?

321
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,000
Ramesh Dubey who?

322
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,710
How is Ramesh Dubey connected to you...

323
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,550
...that you were withdrawing
money from his debit card?

324
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,590
Money? Card?

325
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
What are you saying, madam?

326
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,210
I have only two cards.

327
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,050
Voter card. And Licence.

328
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,960
I can show it if you want.

329
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,340
And last month I even applied for an Aadhar
Card (ID card) under the government scheme.

330
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,460
I can give you a
photocopy of you wish.

331
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,340
Greetings, SP madam.

332
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,630
What are you sending, madam?

333
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,550
Babloo, Mantu, you guys startled me.

334
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,630
Brother got you bail.

335
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,300
Now, let's go.

336
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,210
Take a good look, madam.

337
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,920
Are all the signatures in place?

338
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,460
Come on, let's go, Mr. Pandey.

339
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,340
I'll take your leave.

340
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,880
So Mr. Pandey.
I heard that the Police took you in.

341
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,130
Shankar, that new SP doesn't
know how well connected I am.

342
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,250
And still, you got arrested.

343
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,710
You're the main party worker.

344
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,590
And, there is no one above you.

345
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,000
What's going on, Aditi?

346
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,460
What kind of investigation
are you getting involved?

347
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,170
The girl's hostel...

348
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,340
Look, don't do anything to
spoil the Police Department's image.

349
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,130
No, sir...

350
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,000
And, a suicide case has to be closed,
that's all.

351
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,800
So why this running around?

352
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,090
But, sir...

353
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,250
Look, as a Lady SP...

354
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,420
...the Home Minister
has done you a big favor.

355
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,250
Please don't do anything
to get stripped of this.

356
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,210
It's an open and shut suicide case.

357
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,670
The report should be
on my table immediately.

358
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,000
You'll get your chance
to play Sherlock Holmes.

359
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,670
There are many pending cases.

360
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,550
Now go.

361
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,550
I wonder which department
I am working for?

362
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,880
And why?

363
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,250
A case which is
definitely a murder case...

364
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,670
...we barely manage to find one suspect,

365
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,500
but the court grants him bail.

366
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,130
They should've told
us during the training...

367
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,050
...that the Police are like
the three monkeys of Gandhiji.

368
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,130
See no evil, Hear no Evil,
Say no Evil to the Criminals.

369
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,670
Aditi...that's the culture
and system of this Department.

370
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,750
We've to stay within this
system and fight against it.

371
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,500
And one doesn't need
any special training for it.

372
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,340
Our department teaches us everything.

373
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,420
Fight for what?

374
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,840
DGP sir told me personally...

375
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,130
"Aditi, this is an open
and shut case of suicide."

376
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,170
"Make your report."

377
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,300
Just do one thing for now.

378
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,130
Send a Suicide report
file to the DGP's office.

379
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,710
I will have to.

380
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,210
You know what, it's over.

381
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,460
It's not over.

382
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,800
Its just begun.

383
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,960
'Yeah Rudra,
I've to important numbers.

384
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,960
Write them down.'

385
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,090
The number you gave
me belonged to some girl.

386
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,960
She's a patient in
Arogya Dham Hospital.

387
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,960
'I found this girl
in an unconscious state.'

388
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,630
'She had a severe injury on her head.'

389
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,590
'And, I found this
mobile in her pocket.'

390
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,300
- 'No one knows about her yet.'
- Good.

391
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,960
I don't know why, Aditi,
but I feel this is our last option.

392
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,000
Only I know about her, and now you do.

393
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
I want this to stay between us.

394
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:36,250
And if possible, post some of your
trusted people outside the hospital.

395
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,460
As security.

396
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,840
That will be good.

397
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,460
Your tea's gone cold.

398
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,800
As I said before.

399
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,170
The Administration will order an
unbiased investigation of this case.

400
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,960
And that's what we did.

401
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,340
After a careful investigation...

402
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,170
...the report submitted to
the Home Minister by the Department...

403
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,840
...it was a suicide.

404
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,420
The Opposition made
a hype of this issue...

405
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,750
...and tried to spoil my image.

406
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,920
And I strongly condemn their action.

407
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,170
Give me the tobacco.

408
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,590
As the Chief Minister of the state...

409
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,380
...the law and Order of
this city is my responsibility.

410
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:48,590
That's why I gave a handsfree to a
talented officer like Rudra Pratap Singh.

411
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,960
Sir, that's free
hand and not hands-free.

412
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,460
It's the same thing,
hands-free and free hand.

413
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,500
But I won't take credit for it.

414
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,840
Rudra Pratap deserves
all the accolades.

415
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,630
Rudra Pratap deserves
the commendations.

416
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,630
Blessings to all of you.

417
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,750
- I'll come home in the evening...
- Sir.

418
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,130
Hello.

419
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,210
Hello, Rudra sir.

420
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,550
This is Bramhanand Tripathi.

421
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,960
Hello.

422
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,250
Myself SI Dulare.

423
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,130
- SI Dulare?
- Yes...

424
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,960
Isn't this Mr. Rudra's number?

425
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,840
Yes...

426
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,710
Then how did you answer his phone?

427
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
How can you keep someone else' phone?

428
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,050
Who gave it to you?

429
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,880
Who gave you this right?

430
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
- Let me talk to...
- Just a minute...

431
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,210
Sir, its opposition leader Mr.
Tripathi on the line.

432
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,300
I will call you back.

433
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,750
Yes.

434
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,800
Say what?

435
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,840
Why do you give your
phone to someone else?

436
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,000
Look Rudra sir, in order to
maintain peace and order in the city...

437
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,090
Pro... Prom... Porm...

438
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,000
What is it called?

439
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,750
Sir.
- Promptness.

440
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes, the promptness you've
displayed...is truly commendable.

441
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,630
And that's why I called.

442
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,090
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

443
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,250
I am congratulating you,
and you're sounding so upset.

444
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,130
Look, Rudra sir.

445
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,550
I, Brahmanand Tripathi,
and my Vikas party...

446
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,130
...are with you all the way.

447
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,750
Whether you take any action
or proceedings, we are with you.

448
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:50,960
"The rascal stole...all my emotions."

449
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,380
"I climbed another ladder..."

450
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,340
"...such was my amazing promotion."

451
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,920
"O ascetic..."

452
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,250
"O ascetic..."

453
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,880
"My beloved..."

454
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,500
"...swayed my waist..."

455
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,170
"As I stole his heart with my eyes."

456
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,210
"O ascetic..."

457
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,460
"O ascetic..."

458
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,210
"My beloved..."

459
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,090
"...swayed my waist..."

460
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,170
"As I stole his heart with my eyes."

461
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,380
"I am like a double-edged sword."

462
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,170
"I am a little sweet
and a little salty."

463
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
"But I made a mistake
befriending my beloved."

464
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,630
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

465
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,300
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

466
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,000
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

467
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,670
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

468
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,170
"The rascal treated me to
cappuccino and stole my heart."

469
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,090
"Stole my heart."

470
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,630
"He stole my heart."

471
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,090
"Stole my heart."

472
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,550
"O ascetic..."

473
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,590
"I've been robbed."

474
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,090
"O ascetic..."

475
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,630
"Holi..."

476
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,380
"Babaji had three pigeons,
and they all liked to fly."

477
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,960
"Nice..."

478
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,920
"Babaji had three pigeons,
and they all liked to fly."

479
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,380
"One flutters his wing and the other
winks at the girls."

480
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
"Great...really great."
"This is really great."

481
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,500
"Hookah's piping hot while
the pipe's tastes nice too."

482
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,250
"Look at him."

483
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,670
"Hookah's piping hot while
the pipe's tastes nice too."

484
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,920
"Sister-in-law's fallen down..."

485
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
"...pick her up and take a kiss."

486
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,500
"The rascal treated me to
cappuccino and stole my heart."

487
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,750
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

488
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,300
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

489
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,380
"The rascal took me to see
an English film and stole my heart."

490
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,380
"Stole my heart."

491
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,050
"The sassy lass robbed
everything from me."

492
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,840
"Stole my heart."

493
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,460
ACP madam.

494
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,550
You said that the
investigation will be unbiased.

495
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,130
Our daughters can
never commit suicide.

496
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,170
Look, our investigation
isn't over yet.

497
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,630
And just like you, even we believe that
your daughters didn't commit suicide.

498
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,300
They have been murdered.

499
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,130
We'll soon find a suspect.

500
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,420
And believe me, whoever is behind this
incident will be someone well connected.

501
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,460
But at that time,
you shouldn't go back on your words.

502
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,630
Only then can we get
justice for your children.

503
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,050
You have our full support.

504
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:10,840
Thank you.

505
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,170
Thank you.

506
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,130
This time my I've maintained
Law and Order during my course.

507
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,210
And you guys have done your part too.

508
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,090
We will get the votes.

509
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,880
You must all strengthen the party.

510
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,300
And keep promoting Fodder Machine.

511
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,750
There is no dearth of funds.

512
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,130
Everyone will make a buck.

513
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,420
Your pockets will be jingling.

514
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,670
Don't worry.

515
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,460
I am in a hurry now.

516
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,920
I have a rally meeting to attend to.

517
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,550
We'll meet tomorrow at the same time.

518
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,340
Blessings to all of you.

519
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,840
Bring me the files I need to sign.

520
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,170
Sir, please read them once.

521
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,710
Why?

522
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,630
Why didn't you read them?

523
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,170
Was your IAS degree from Dhanbad fake?

524
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,340
Huh?

525
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,210
Should I order a CBI inquiry?

526
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,340
Asking me to read?

527
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,130
Fine, I'll call you later.

528
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,210
Greetings, sir.

529
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,500
What is it?

530
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,250
That College incident.

531
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,340
Rudra Pratap from Crime
Branch has found that girl.

532
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,500
I see.

533
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,380
She's in Arogya Hospital.

534
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,130
And the news is that Tripathi from the
Opposition is fully supporting him.

535
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,210
Hello.

536
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,210
Sir, the girl's blood matched with
the blood sample that you provided.

537
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,630
- I am coming.
- Thank you.

538
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,050
Sir.

539
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,750
- All okay.
- Sir, all okay here.

540
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,050
But that man standing there has been
pacing around the place since morning.

541
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,840
Who sent you?

542
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,300
Shankar sir.

543
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,630
Shankar.

544
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,210
Where can I find this Shankar?

545
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,710
Tell me.

546
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,130
Teli Gali, 25.

547
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Check her first.

548
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,050
His name is Shankar.

549
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,750
He's the CM's sycophant.

550
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,250
I am sure he's involved in this case.

551
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,920
And I think he's the
one who got Pandey bail.

552
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,840
And Pandey's been
missing since that day.

553
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,130
But there's nothing we
can do without strong evidence.

554
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,300
Aditi, it's like playing
hide-n-seek with the crime.

555
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,670
The more you enjoy it,
the more you'll play.

556
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:27,630
But in this game,
someone will give up first.

557
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,500
Welcome. Welcome, DGP sir.

558
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,710
What is the condition
of Law and Order?

559
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,090
All okay, sir.

560
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,300
- DGP sir.
- Sir.

561
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,130
Tie it. what are you waiting for?

562
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,130
If I had fallen down,
then so would the government.

563
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,000
And the media would've
turned this into breaking news...

564
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:06,800
...that the government collapsed.

565
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,920
Do you know that?

566
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,090
You don't.

567
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,130
If you tie it,
you'll get to keep your job.

568
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,880
Don't be shy.

569
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,300
Your SP's on the way too.

570
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,090
That's more like it.

571
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,460
Now shine it too.

572
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,920
Take your handkerchief out.

573
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Come on.

574
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,090
Nice. Very nice.

575
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,550
Very good Mr. DGP.

576
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,920
Blessings!

577
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,000
Did you see the breaking news today?

578
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,250
No, sir.

579
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,090
The bitter truth of Democracy.

580
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,880
This is the Parliament House
where this shameful incident occurred.

581
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:51,170
A DGP rank police officer
is tying the CM's shoelace.

582
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,630
So what if the DGP tied my shoelace.

583
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,130
It's no ordinary shoelace.

584
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,670
And I don't want such
an incident to happen to you.

585
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,800
I just wanted to investigate.

586
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,380
As long as you remain as Gandhiji's
three monkeys, you will stay alive.

587
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:19,460
And the day you'll try
to be a hero of your Department...

588
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,340
...someone will shoot you done.

589
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,750
I am explaining to you
because you're just a kid.

590
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,460
See you, sir.

591
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,420
Aditi.

592
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:00,920
What happened?

593
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,550
Nothing.

594
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,340
Why are you so angry?

595
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,670
Let it be.

596
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,420
Dulare.

597
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,710
- Jai Hindi, sir.
- Jai Hind.

598
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,550
I wanted to give you this file.

599
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,840
Sinha sir said it's urgent, so...

600
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,250
Okay.

601
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,550
Goodnight, sir.

602
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,420
Dulare brought some of your files.

603
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,710
Keep it, please.

604
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,750
What happened?

605
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
Are you going to say something?

606
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,630
The CM called me today.

607
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,920
I am coming from there.

608
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,710
What did the CM say?

609
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,750
What will he say?

610
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:01,840
Bloody corrupt man.

611
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,920
He was threatening me.

612
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,090
Threatening?

613
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:08,670
What kind of threat.

614
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,750
Rudra, he knows that we're
still investigating this case.

615
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
He threatened to kill me.

616
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,170
- Hello.
- Shankar has opened fire on us.

617
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,750
Send backup immediately.

618
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,800
There's been an attack on sir's house.

619
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,250
We must get there immediately.

620
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,130
Here you go, brother.

621
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:10,920
Throw it.

622
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,800
Careful!

623
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,500
Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!

624
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,880
Quiet.

625
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,590
You bark a lot.

626
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,590
But, that doesn't make you a lion.

627
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:12,630
What did you think?

628
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,210
You can barge in my home and kill me.

629
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,130
Huh...

630
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,130
I will fix the time of your death

631
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,090
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

632
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,590
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

633
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,500
Calm down.

634
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,090
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

635
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,380
Calm down, everyone.

636
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,590
I have a question.

637
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,500
What is this terrible
time we're living in?

638
00:58:53,050 --> 00:59:00,000
It's so embarrassing that
the CM makes a DGP tie his shoelace.

639
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,670
A Police officer is attacked.

640
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,460
What will happen to this state?

641
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,210
Police officers are
murdered in broad daylight.

642
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:15,960
In fact, Prasadi Lal has no
right to remain the CM of this state.

643
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:21,050
And I strongly oppose his rally.

644
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,210
Jai Hind. Jai Bharat.

645
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,170
Let's go.

646
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,710
- Mr. Tripathi!
- Long live...

647
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,420
- Mr. Tripathi!
- Long live...

648
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,090
- Mr. Tripathi!
- Long live...

649
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,250
- Mr. Tripathi!
- Long live...

650
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,500
Where are you going?

651
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,590
The headquarters.

652
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,800
The CM's rally is today.

653
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,340
So now what?

654
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,800
Hanumant and Anjana's body
has been sent for post-mortem.

655
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,460
It's okay.

656
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Rudra. Everything will be fine.

657
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,630
Come, I'll drop you.

658
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,500
Come on.

659
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,000
Okay, see you in the evening.

660
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,710
- Aditi.
- Yeah.

661
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,050
I could have...killed him today.

662
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,050
- Who?
- Shankar.

663
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,170
- Rudra...
- I visited CM house.

664
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,300
Are you mad..

665
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,710
But, I didn't do it.

666
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,000
Not because I can't kill him.

667
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:24,840
But I didn't kill him because
that would've made you angry.

668
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,130
See you.

669
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:48,800
Hello.

670
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:49,920
Yes, Sapna.

671
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,630
Sir, the girl is conscious.

672
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,380
That's good.

673
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,840
Take care of her, I'll be there.

674
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:56,670
Okay.

675
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,550
Aditi, that girl's conscious.

676
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,840
I must go.

677
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,710
Good.

678
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,340
Keep updating me
about every development.

679
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:07,840
I will.

680
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,170
Look, don't be scared.

681
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,210
You're safe.

682
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,840
You're in my house.

683
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,920
My name is Rudra.

684
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,750
I am a Police officer.

685
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,500
Can you tell me..

686
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,380
what happened with you on that day?

687
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,840
The CM's rally will reach
Shashtri Nagar through this route.

688
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,880
- Mr. Mishra, you will handle Shashtri Nagar area.
- Yes, ma'am.

689
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,380
At this turn,
the rally will reach Indra Nagar.

690
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,630
Mr. Upadhyay,
you will handle the Indra Nagar area.

691
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,460
My name is Pooja.

692
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,210
And I am the girl's hostel
warden Kanchan Devi's daughter.

693
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,800
Come.

694
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,130
Sit.

695
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,420
What happened on that day?

696
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,550
All this began on our
College's Annual Day function.

697
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:33,170
Our Chief guest,
respect Chief Minister...

698
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:39,550
...spared some of his valuable time to attend
our College's 50th Annual Day function.

699
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,460
And for that, I am truly obliged.

700
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:48,250
And I request him to come
here and bless the children.

701
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,550
Calm down.

702
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:03,300
I am really happy..

703
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,300
..to see all the children here.

704
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,960
The way woman are
advancing in every sector.

705
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:19,420
My hats off to all the girls.

706
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:28,210
The Women's college
Student leader Sanju.

707
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,420
Wow!

708
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,300
Amazing.

709
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,670
She is a very talented student.

710
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:49,670
I truly commend her
aspirations and talent.

711
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,920
I appreciate it.

712
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,380
Did I scare you?

713
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,920
How can I be scared of you?

714
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,670
This is how you steal my heart.

715
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,590
Really? Really?

716
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,840
What?

717
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,090
First...can I say something?

718
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,250
Did you have to talk at this time?

719
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,460
Okay, forget it.

720
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,590
I won't say it.

721
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,170
Okay, ...say it.

722
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,840
You know, if you could get
me an election ticket as well.

723
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,130
You just climbed up a single ladder...

724
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,630
...and already eyeing
the minister's chair.

725
01:06:58,670 --> 01:06:59,800
No.

726
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,880
All I am asking for a ticket.

727
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,630
It is not a joke.

728
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:15,670
Look, whenever I ask you for a ticket,
you make some excuse.

729
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,250
Whenever you call me,
and wherever, I come immediately.

730
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,130
And never ask a question.

731
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,630
Please do this one thing for me.

732
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,670
Look...i even make
promises to the people.

733
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,130
That's my habit.

734
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,340
You see, Shankar is my brother-in-law.

735
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,050
He keeps asking me for a ticket,
but I don't give him.

736
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,960
I will when I have one.

737
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:57,800
And...if I call you,
I even give you good money.

738
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,670
That's true.

739
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,550
But you see, money isn't
the solution to everything.

740
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,670
Then what is?

741
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,380
I must think of my future as well.

742
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,130
I see...

743
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,710
Then let's think about the future...

744
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,500
One day, I was sitting with Sanju,
Kavita, and Rupali, in their room.

745
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:33,340
What are you watching?

746
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,000
What are you watching?

747
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:34,710
I want to see too.

748
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,170
Pooja.

749
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,130
I want to see too.

750
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,420
This is not for you.

751
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:38,840
What do you mean?

752
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:40,340
I mean you're too young.

753
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,380
No, I am not.

754
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,750
I understand everything pretty well.

755
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,710
Okay, let me watch.

756
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,880
You'll understand when
you spend time with us.

757
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,670
Listen, I will complain
about this to my mother.

758
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,880
Then you'll understand.

759
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,170
Your mom.

760
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,210
Nice.

761
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,130
Yes, mom.

762
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,550
Pooja, where are you?

763
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,840
I am in Sanju's room.

764
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,500
What are you still
doing in the hostel?

765
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,050
Don't you want to eat with me?

766
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:08,380
Food will be here soon.

767
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,340
What are you doing?

768
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,050
Yes, I am coming.

769
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:11,000
Two minutes.

770
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,550
You've been saying that...

771
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,130
Hello. Hello. Hello.

772
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,090
She hung up.

773
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:18,880
She's always...

774
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,250
Madam.

775
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,090
Since hostel closed down
you stopped taking our calls.

776
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,800
We called you so many times

777
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,880
but why don't you answer.

778
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,000
There are only a
few more hotties left...

779
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,090
...send them over for
the Chief Minister.

780
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,130
You've already taken
full advantage of Sanju.

781
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,460
Her holidays are due, let her go now.

782
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:42,380
Sanju is old news.

783
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,750
This is a new fragrance.

784
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,550
Look, we'll talk about
this tomorrow in the office.

785
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,550
Please leave now.

786
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,460
Isn't that the same girl?

787
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:02,420
From the function?

788
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,000
She is very beautiful.

789
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,300
The Chief Minister has lost his mind

790
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,130
since he saw her.

791
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,340
Show me.

792
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,920
You'll get his blessings.

793
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,800
No Shankar.

794
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,250
She is my daughter.

795
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,380
Leave her alone.

796
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,590
Once I deflower her,
her life will be made.

797
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,550
Go and tell your brother-in-law to
keep his feelings in control!

798
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:28,590
Sanju has kept all
his pictures pretty safely.

799
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,050
It won't take me too long
to publish it in the newspapers.

800
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:33,050
Understand!

801
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:38,380
I can take your brother-in-law's
seat from him in a jiffy.

802
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,550
Now get out.

803
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,000
Get out!

804
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,250
The name is Shankar Yadav.

805
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,880
I am the CM's brother-in-law.

806
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,090
And how dare you threaten
my brother-in-law!

807
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,420
Sanju!

808
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:17,250
Sanju!

809
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,590
Shankar killed my mother!

810
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:20,050
What?

811
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,000
Killed her.

812
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:26,500
Shankar was telling my mother that
you and the CM are having an affair.

813
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,710
Are you?

814
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,630
Tell me?

815
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:29,840
Are you having an affair?

816
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,050
He was telling my mother
that you have some photos.

817
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:33,670
Sanju.

818
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:34,590
Where are those photos?

819
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,170
Where are those photos and videos?

820
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,420
Tell me.

821
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,710
Where are those photos?

822
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,340
So Sanju?

823
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,420
I heard you've been showing
a keen interest in photography.

824
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,170
Take my pictures as well.

825
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:50,840
Look.

826
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,000
Take one.

827
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,710
Click it. Click it.

828
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:00,590
Didn't you want a ticket
from brother-in-law?

829
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,960
But now it looks highly difficult.

830
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,750
Shankar. I will kill you!

831
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,880
That day when I came
out of the girl's hostel,

832
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,710
I fell unconscious immediately.

833
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,590
I don't remember what
happened after that.

834
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,340
- Can you give a statement?
- Yes, sir.

835
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:02,500
You were talking about
some video, photo, or MMS.

836
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:10,210
Sir, that day when
I went to Sanju's room.

837
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,210
And asked about the photos.

838
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,670
'Which photos and videos?'

839
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:19,340
She hid a locket inside her t-shirt.

840
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,420
Locket?

841
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,130
- How is this connected with a locket?
- I don't know, sir.

842
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,920
But she had a habit.

843
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,960
She used to keep all her
photos and videos on a pen-drive.

844
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,340
Her...locket is her pen-drive, sir.

845
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,750
I am sure.

846
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:51,000
I am sure, sir.

847
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:06,880
Hello.

848
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:09,210
Ma'am, a huge crowd has
gathered around here.

849
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,750
We'll need extra force.

850
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,590
Yes, I've already
ordered for extra force,

851
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,380
and I am on my way too.

852
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:15,670
Okay.

853
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:25,250
Soon, your beloved
Minister will be with you.

854
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:28,300
Please maintain silence
until he arrives.

855
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,800
-Jai Hind, sir.
-Jai Hind, sir.

856
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,460
- Long live
- Prasadi Lal...

857
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,210
- Long live
- Prasadi Lal...

858
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,250
- Long live
- Prasadi Lal...

859
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:51,170
There are some people in this crowd...

860
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,000
...who don't want your
beloved Minister's

861
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,500
rally to be successful.

862
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,300
And...

863
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,590
We don't want such a minister!

864
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,050
Who is that?

865
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,000
Throw him out!

866
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,300
Hey... Move!

867
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:16,960
Move!

868
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,920
What are you doing?

869
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,250
I said move.

870
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:02,880
'And the day you will try to be
a hero of your department...'

871
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,920
'...someone will hunt you down.'

872
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,300
"Oh...beloved..."

873
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,420
"Oh...beloved..."

874
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:09,960
"Who do I tell...my heart to."

875
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:14,920
"My beloved left me alone..."

876
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,090
"Oh...beloved..."

877
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:19,710
"Oh...beloved..."

878
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,090
"Oh...my beloved..."

879
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:25,250
"Oh...beloved..."

880
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:03,380
"The union and separation
with my beloved."

881
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:08,550
"The union and separation
with my beloved."

882
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:15,500
"A moment...of happiness."

883
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:24,170
"A moment...of happiness."

884
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:32,340
"A moment...of happiness."

885
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:36,000
"I wonder what mistake I made..."

886
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:38,960
"...my heart is lost."

887
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:42,340
"Oh...beloved..."

888
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,050
"Oh...beloved..."

889
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,250
"Who do I tell...my heart to."

890
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:58,130
"My beloved left me alone..."

891
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,460
"My beloved left me alone..."

892
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,920
"Oh...beloved..."

893
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,710
"Oh...beloved..."

894
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,800
"Oh...my beloved..."

895
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,840
"Oh...beloved..."

896
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,880
Rudra, what brings you here?

897
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,920
Come inside.

898
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,550
Sit.

899
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:04,170
I am resigning.

900
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:08,500
Look Rudra,
even I am sad about Aditi's death.

901
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:12,420
But that doesn't mean that
you resign from the Police Force.

902
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:18,960
All her life she worked
within the norms of the Law.

903
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:22,050
And my mistake was...

904
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,000
..that I listened to her.

905
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,420
But what I am going to next,

906
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,920
I can't do it as a Police officer.

907
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,210
A Police officer will break the law.

908
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,500
Yes.

909
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:49,380
Because I know you cannot help me.

910
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,800
You are helpless.

911
01:23:55,250 --> 01:24:00,210
So helpless that you have
to tie a minister's shoelace.

912
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,090
My resignation.

913
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:11,840
See you.

914
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,130
Wait.

915
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:16,250
You're making a big mistake.

916
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,460
If I stop now,
then no one can stop those rascals.

917
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:35,380
Do you know what it means?

918
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,750
Eradicating unrighteousness
is not a sin.

919
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:48,960
How long will keep obeying
these Minister just to save our jobs...

920
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,420
...and stay at their beck and call?

921
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,630
How long?

922
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:57,210
This uniform, which we should respect...

923
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,340
...but these ministers
are humiliating it.

924
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Rudra Pratap Singh Chauhan, you
can do whatever you think is right.

925
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,630
Your Department fully supports you.

926
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:17,920
SP Aditi Singh's
martyrdom won't go waste.

927
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:41,840
"The one that's called youth."

928
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:47,340
"Is trouble all the way."

929
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:52,170
"Its trouble to hide it."

930
01:25:52,380 --> 01:26:01,710
"And...it's troubling showing it too."

931
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,710
"O, beloved..."

932
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,960
"O, beloved..."

933
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,960
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

934
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:26,670
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

935
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:29,250
"O, beloved...people ogle at me."

936
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,840
"People taunt me."

937
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,340
"My youth has become trouble for me."

938
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:40,050
"As your veil slips down..."

939
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:42,590
"Walk carefully."

940
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,170
"There are many Romeos around here."

941
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:47,920
"They won't listen to an excuse."

942
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,550
"Otherwise...you'll be
calling out your beloved."

943
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,170
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

944
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:57,000
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

945
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:36,420
"I just turned 16...and
on my way to 17."

946
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:41,130
"My youth is now in danger."

947
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,880
"Everyone's crazy about my youth..."

948
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,630
"...like bees hovering on a flower."

949
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,460
"I am in trouble...after
making wrong gestures."

950
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:56,460
"Why did you put...kohl in your eyes?"

951
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:01,630
"Why did lace your
tresses with flowers?"

952
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:06,500
"Why did you deck yourself?"

953
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:10,920
"That's why everyone teases you."

954
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,210
"I am scared of their prying eyes."

955
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:18,050
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

956
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:21,300
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

957
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,210
"Who will I kiss...whose
beloved will I be?"

958
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,500
"All my lovers are after me."

959
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:10,500
"The Policeman says...take my bungalow."

960
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:15,550
"And the trader's son
squanders all his earnings."

961
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,840
"Why did you shine your trinket?"

962
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,880
"And wear a gold chain
around your waist."

963
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:30,840
"Why did you come
out of your house alone?"

964
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,800
"That's why everyone's
crazy about you."

965
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,000
"The fish has taken the bait."

966
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:42,460
"O, beloved...people flirt with me."

967
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:46,210
"O, beloved...people stare at me."

968
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,960
"O, beloved..."

969
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,590
"O, beloved..."

970
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:54,000
"O, beloved..."

971
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:56,000
"O, beloved..."

972
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:13,750
Give him a grand welcome.

973
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,210
Go on!

974
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:54,380
Kill the rascal!

975
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:52,960
My Aditi won't come
back if I kill you.

976
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:57,960
But if I spare you today,
then someone else might regret.

977
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:03,920
I told you,
that I will fix your time of death.

978
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,880
Today is Dussera.

979
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,880
"The time to slay evil is Dussera."

980
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,130
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

981
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,250
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

982
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,800
"Dussera is the time
to conquer over evil."

983
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
- Long live...
- Prasadi Lal!

984
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,170
- Long live...
- Prasadi Lal!

985
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:34,960
- Long live...
- Prasadi Lal!

986
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,750
Greetings.

987
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,920
Shankar.

988
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Shankar.

989
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,500
Where is Shankar?

990
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:28,090
Didn't you invite him?

991
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:35,050
Blessings to all of you
on the occasion of Dussera.

992
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:44,840
DGP.

993
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,920
DGP, come here.

994
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,630
What kind of Ravan is this?

995
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:57,750
It took him 10 heads
to abduct one Sita.

996
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:03,420
And I alone...have send the
entire state hostage with one head.

997
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:08,130
"The time to slay evil is Dussera."

998
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:10,840
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

999
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,750
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

1000
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,840
"Dussera is the time
to conquer over evil."

1001
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,710
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1002
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,210
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1003
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,340
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1004
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:25,090
"Dussera is the time
to conquer over evil."

1005
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:26,750
Do you see...the condition of the state?

1006
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:36,590
Look...a low-rank Police officer
like you can never harm me.

1007
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,090
I am the CM of this state.

1008
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:43,170
My name is Prasadi Lal.

1009
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:51,170
I control the people.

1010
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,800
Did you forget what
happened to your wife?

1011
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,130
I won't kill you.

1012
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:06,170
The people will kill you.

1013
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:09,050
They love me a lot.

1014
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,800
I am the king.

1015
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:15,000
My name is Prasadi Lal!

1016
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:32,050
Don't you have anything else to say?

1017
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,210
Go on.

1018
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,960
Lecture me.

1019
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,250
But now it's my turn to speak.

1020
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:48,590
The people you were talking about,
that's us.

1021
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,460
UPSC!

1022
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:55,500
Union Public Service Commission!

1023
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,550
We are not your servants,
to clean your shoes.

1024
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,340
We are public servants.

1025
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,210
Look...

1026
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,750
Look what your people
are saying about you.

1027
01:42:19,130 --> 01:42:21,500
I was in the girl's college myself.

1028
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:24,130
At that time...

1029
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,880
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

1030
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,420
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

1031
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,130
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

1032
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:33,960
- Prasadi Lal...
- Down! Down!

1033
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:53,420
Sometimes for the sake of the law and
the country, you have to break the Law.

1034
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:59,630
And, if I don't take an initiative
now, then justice will never be done.

1035
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:03,960
And justice will be done today.

1036
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,840
Get up.

1037
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,460
No. No. No.

1038
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,380
What did you say?

1039
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:13,590
No. No. No.

1040
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:17,250
"The time to wage war is Dussera."

1041
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,380
"The time to do justice is Dussera."

1042
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:22,210
"Dussera is the time
to conquer over evil."
