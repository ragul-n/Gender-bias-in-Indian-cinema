6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,388
It's decided by one's deeds. Karma.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,996

15
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,919
We don't want any dam for us

16
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,058
What more can I say?

17
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,267
Blogging was just a hobby for me.

18
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,274
But her inspiration made me mould my memory...

19
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,370
..our memories.. to this novel.

00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,537

..we've already given awayto reviewers.

25
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,455
And if you find it boring,
the blame should definitely go over there.

26
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,194
About the central character of this novel..

27
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,935
..his life is an ode to lost love.

28
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:38,038
Razia called it a river of love
flowing towards a sea of separation.

29
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,343
Now for the surprise.

30
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:53,255
The man who sailed across the nine seas of lost love
in this book is here with us today.

31
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,727
Moreover, I'll be a part ofthis
wonderful marine city soon.

36
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,118
A voyage to the nine forms of lost love
under the cosmic influences of nine planets.

37
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,556
I'm not elaborating much, a book is to be read.

38
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,013
I'm sure the two ofyou have heard that
ships are safest in the harbour.

39
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,989
But that's not where it's meant to be.

40
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,623
Yes sir

41
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,356
Send a request to bunk at the next port.

42
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,922
OK Captain.
Superintendent has called again for the reports.

43
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,530
He said we will just have to manage it
until we're able to dry.-dock.

44
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,530
Did he really?

45
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,064
Well, tell him to shut his mouth
and moving to repair this ship..

46
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,803
..instead of sending out orders
from that cozy little office of his.

47
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,644
Daddy. Whose ship are we going to?

48
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,019
To dad's old friend's ship.

49
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,817
And where are we going to?

50
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,660
Well, far far away, to your dad's place.

51
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,917
You want to see my home, son?

52
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,558
Yes, Who is there in your home?

53
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,257
Your grandpa's there.

54
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,827
But Mommy told me that Grandpa went to heaven!

55
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,138
You've got another grandpa.

56
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,532
Oh! Two grandpas? Will mummy also come there?

57
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,168
No.

58
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,556
Look there

59
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,769
8 long years!

60
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,444
No, 8 short years, mate.

61
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,846
Where have you been?
No emails, no phonecalls, nothing!

62
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,517
We knewthat you'd immigrate somewhere
proper but we'd no idea where.

63
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,815
A long story., mate.

64
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,417
Sam. Say hello.

65
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,930
Hello. My name is Sam and this is my Octopian boy.

66
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,727
An Octopian boywow!

67
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,398
Sam, my name is Freddie and this is my Octopian girl.

68
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,834
He's just being silly.

69
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,006
I'm Razia. Come let's go.

70
00:07:59,078 --> 00:07:59,669
Sam, here.

71
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,779
What's wrong?
- It's time for Sam's next dose.

72
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:06,450
He's got diabetes.

73
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,686
Diabetes. It's for old people.

74
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,955
My son's got it a bit early. Juvenile diabetes.

75
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,125
Sam, your hand.

76
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,298
Watch it.

77
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,028
It's paining.

78
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,930
So Sam is really not Mira's son.

79
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,275
Yeah. Apparently, he lost her.

80
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,170
She married some yatchsman.

81
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:35,538
Where is she?

82
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,807
He really didn't want to talk about it
but I knowthat he hasn't been home in years.

83
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,050
Can't believe it. Here, have some coffee.

84
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,450
Darling, you make incredible coffee.

85
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,655
Some of the best.

86
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,019
But I told Vinaythat we'll be going to the
Seaman's club tonight and have some drinks.

87
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,262
Sam..
- I'll take care of him.

88
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,172
"l walk awayfrom the blue light."

89
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,391
Freddie, memories are like wine, man.

90
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,819
Tastes better with time.

91
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,023
You're absolutely right, Vinay.

92
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,330
But bad memories get bitter with time.

93
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,731
Freddie man, memories come and go,
we don't have a choice.

94
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,267
You do remember your first love.

95
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,110
First love? I remember myfirst drink.

96
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,816
"Oh its raining"

97
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,885
"Somewhere in my dreams"

98
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,224
"But I feel the heat"

99
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,951
"Shower me with love"

100
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,031
"Get your body move"

101
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,228
"ln the latest groove"
"And make your move"

102
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,438
"For the party sake, get your body shake"

103
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,568
"Well that's what ma music will make"

104
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,878
"l will love you like a never ending dream
Look into my eyes"

105
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,787
"Tell me what you see, read my heart
Lets party up tonight"

106
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,558
"Come on, come on..Lets turn it up
And feel the beat in our hearts"

107
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,560
"Come on, come on.. Lets burn it out
And swayto the songs tonight"

108
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,402
"Move your bodythrough the night"

109
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,707
"Lift your hands up for this song"

110
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,703
"Dance around and
Rock this floortonight"

111
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,511
"Get your bodymove"

112
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,489
Memories are likewine.

113
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,490
Freddy, you tell me, what's more painful..

114
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,863
..unexpressed love or unrequitted love?

115
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,800
Ifyou'd expressed it on time..

116
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,268
..you'd would have gotten your love.

117
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,069
But it's too late.

118
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,271
It's time to board. I gotta go!

119
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,607
Vinay.

120
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,477
The surveyor has boarded,
will you make sure everything's alright?

121
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,243
I'll have a quick round.
- I'll take Sam.

122
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,987
Sam, don't trouble Razia. Okay?

123
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,401
Ifthis ship sinks, we can escape in these lifeboats.

124
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,869
And what ifthe lifeboat sinks?

125
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,572
Good question.

126
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,371
Well lifeboat rarely sink.

127
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,872
And even ifthey do,
you've your life jacket to keep you afloat.

128
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,977
But what ifthe life jacket sinks?

129
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,498
Ajit! Ajit!

130
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,231
Don't fire the boiler,
oil has accumulated on the floor?

131
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,407
Clean that out first.

132
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,144
I will!

133
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,432
Daddy!

134
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,930
Daddy.

135
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,070
Your daddy is busy, we'll go?

136
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,607
Okay.

137
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,113
Hey darling, can you please come down to CCR?

138
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,445
I think I've a job for you.

139
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,287
Ok, I'll be right there.

140
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,870
Don't worry.,
give me an hour I'll finish the calculations.

141
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,186
But filling those tanks partially is dangerous.

142
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,415
It's better to fill the double-bottom tanks instead.

143
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,024
But you've some problems with your transfer lines.

144
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,326
Crap!

145
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,499
Is there anything?

146
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,101
Anything at all that works fine
on this 200 year old rust bucket.

147
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,106
You 2 carry. on, we'll see what's going on.

148
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,314
This is 9 victa echo echo.

149
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,150
There's a fire onboard. Over.

150
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,128
We'll have to release the CO2,
there's no other option. - Damn it!

151
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,128
Close the other doors.

152
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,382
CO2 released. Over.

153
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,285
Myfirst CO2 release experience.

154
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,958
Yeah, me too.

155
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,187
Crap, I've gotta give Sam a shot.

156
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,074
The fire must've broken through that..

157
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,473
Have you seen Sam?

158
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,570
Sam is sleeping in my room.

159
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,377
He's not there.
- What?!

160
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,746
He must be somewhere around.

161
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,615
I've looked around, he's not there.

162
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,591
Excuse me, have you seen Sam?
- No

163
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,162
Vinay! Vinay! Over!

164
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,898
Roger, Vinay here. Over. - Is Sam with you?

165
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,599
No, over.
- Then I think you'd rather bolt.

166
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,127
Have you seen Sam?
- No, I've not seen him.

167
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,601
Sam was in the engine room.
- What?

168
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,506
He came down searching for you.

169
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,572
No, Vinay,
you can't go down without the oxygen mask.

170
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,027
Go check the bridge. Check the bridge, quick!

171
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,423
Go to the battery. room and see there..

172
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,762
Nothing? Nothing!

173
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,396
Go forward! Forward!

174
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,374
Both ofyou.. both ofyou go to the pump room
and look for Sam now!

175
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,709
Wait! Wait!

176
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,444
Take him to the cabin.

177
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,985
Vinay! We found him!

178
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,055
Sam!

179
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,462
Sam!

180
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,185
I fell asleep.

181
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,821
I'm so sorry., Vinay.
- It's alright.

182
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,896
Man, you've tried all the available options?

183
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,558
Almost.

184
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,564
There's one last thing left.

185
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,694
One last hope.

186
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,823
What's bothering you? Sam's alright.

187
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,087
I'm just thinking about Vinay and Mira.

188
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,721
I hate tragic love stories.

189
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,995
Well then, what kind of love stories do you love?

190
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,335
Our kind.

191
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,001
Really?
- Yes.

192
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,732
Why is that?

193
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,045
Doesn't the sea look romantic?

194
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,041
It's beautiful.

195
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,210
But is not really half as beautiful
as you look right now.

196
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,411
I love you.
- Oh lady!

197
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,847
Let's not get too carried awaywith this.

198
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,788
C'mon, let's go to bed.

199
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,291
Carry me, my captain, I'm tired.

200
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:56,457
ok..

201
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,567
"Everyday in my life
Seems like I met my knight"

202
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:08,103
"ln shining armor you
Came for me in light"

203
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,613
'There is no one anywhere in the world
Whom I can trust for sure"

204
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,151
'To hold my hands all the way
My life lies ahead of me"

205
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,450
"Blinding lights all around
But I don't hear a sound"

206
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,686
"Your voice is in my head
And my heart is filled with song"

207
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,660
I was thinking how it'd feel..

208
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,991
..to have someone lying between us.

209
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,505
Someone we could call our own.

210
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,035
Am I so boring?

211
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,374
That you need somebody here with us?

212
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,886
Besides with somebody between us,
how can I hold you so closely?

213
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,798
Things like the repairs will last for months.

214
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,902
It'd be easier to just replace the whole engine room.

215
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,840
It's hard to get spares for a girl that old.

216
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,043
Freddy, I need to take some time off to go home.

217
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,677
I don't want to delay Sam's treatment.

218
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,050
Of course,
are you sure you'll be going to the right place?

219
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,521
Like I said, my last hope.

220
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,320
Well good. It's a weekend anyway.

221
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,825
Bye.

222
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,465
HeyVinay! Next week, summer palace alright?

223
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,871
Daddy, what is that thing for?

224
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,306
That separates the seawater from the fresh water.

225
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,574
Where's the dam?

226
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,012
It's veryfar off. Beyond our home.

227
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:17,000
"Why did you go leaving me?"

228
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:22,379
'Why did you so break my heart?"

229
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:27,882
'Where can I find you now?"

230
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:32,349
"Where you are?"

231
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,454
"No matter where you are..."

232
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,923
"my heart too will be there"

233
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,904
"Will we ever meet again?"

234
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:54,343
'Will my lost love come back?"

235
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,179
"Why did you go leaving me?"

236
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:04,655
'Why did you so break my heart?"

237
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:39,955
"You had given me only one gift...
That was just your memories"

238
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:49,994
"You had given me only one memory....
That was just your love"

239
00:22:50,736 --> 00:23:00,907
"That love was always the symbol
In the poems from my heart"

240
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:11,682
"Even the winds heard...
what I told the clouds"

241
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:30,575
"Can you... Not hear it...
The agony of my love"

242
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:35,011
"Why did you go leaving me?"

243
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:41,942
'Why did you so break my heart?"

244
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,940
Sir, this is your stop. Are you not getting down?

245
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,304
Dad..

246
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,039
Sleeping. Shall I wake him up?
- No.

247
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,940
He was talking about your arrival today.

248
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,480
Mira..

249
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,991
Nothing, forget it.

250
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,241
Take a bath. I'll get the dinner ready.

251
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,338
What's your son's name?

252
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,777
Sam... Samuel.

253
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,683
Your husband..

254
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,727
Oh! You didn't dry. your hair?

255
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,403
Daddy, wake up.

256
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,444
Wake up, daddy!

257
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,511
Who are you?

258
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,613
First tell me, who are you?

259
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,085
I'm asking you, who are you?

260
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,087
But who are you?

261
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,935
Blow. Blow!

262
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:33,780
Son.

263
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,221
I knew you'd come back.

264
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,716
But I thought you'd come much earlier.

265
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:49,599
See, your horoscope prediction says that
your wandering period is now over.

266
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,164
I know, you don't believe in all this.

267
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,971
Buddha's teachings have changed me a lot, son.

268
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,777
Where's that boy?

269
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,716
Come here. Let me see.

270
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,014
Blow.

271
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,254
I'm happythat my son has come home with his son.

272
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,331
I remember you curing a case of juvenile diabetes..

273
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,367
Diabetic.

274
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,605
Someone will be coming from the East.

275
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,114
Maybe snake bite. Be prepared.

276
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,753
Sire!

277
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,316
Sire! He's been poisoned!

278
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,141
A viper.

279
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,381
Scared?

280
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,387
Your tea must be cold. Let me get you another.

281
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,885
Did father teach you astrologytoo?

282
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,494
I can't even predict my own future.

283
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,953
That is dangerous!

284
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,419
You do that, when there is no other option!

285
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,236
All these injections and these tablets..

286
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,995
..he's such a small child.

287
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,636
All these doctor's theyjust prescribe medicines.

288
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,214
God. He cures illiness.

289
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,113
I am sorry., If I could never fulfill your deams
or followyour foot steps.

290
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,350
He decides so.

291
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,818
We can not change our destiny!

292
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,924
How long are you going to be here?

293
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,395
For a few months perhaps!

294
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,068
You actuallywant to leave?

295
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,972
I haven't decided yet!

296
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,141
And Sam's mother?

297
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,243
She wasn't able to come.

298
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,391
Show me your tongue.

299
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,158
It will take some times treatment.

300
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,201
Let him be here. This is his home.

301
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,307
No? Ok!

302
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,710
Welcome to the summer palace!

303
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,608
This is amazing!

304
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:01,947
Come on

305
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,222
Freak man! Marvelous!

306
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,391
This house has exceeds all my expectations.

307
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,224
After father's death,
we are the onlytwo actually staying here.

308
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,165
Come on, come this way!
I want to showyou something.

309
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,562
My great grand father!

310
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:26,166
He came here to lndia to build this dam,
dumb American settled here.

311
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,209
It was my misfortune..

312
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,672
..I am not destined to be some British born
to a rich woman in Europe.

313
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,611
We still have time Freddie!

314
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,311
Meet my Grand father.Sir William Brown..

315
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,112
He was the first to admire this place.

316
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,985
His game was cricket not politics.

317
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,290
Myfather, John Brown.

318
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,955
Myfather is the man,
who made the city the wayyou see it now.

319
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,660
He started the construction on the dam
but before he finished it, he was killed.

320
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,699
He is probably constructing a dam in heaven now!

321
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,068
This is my sister, Mariya Brown.

322
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,208
She was the only worry. in my life.

323
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,008
Awrongfully administered anesthesia
did that to her.

324
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,647
Frederick Brown didn't inherit
political powers from his father.

325
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:14,282
This man Durai, Mariya's husband.
He became the next mayor

326
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,495
I wish I could talk to her for now.

327
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,416
Sir. What is this, sir?

328
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,017
Leave him

329
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,846
Enjoying your parole?

330
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,352
Yes sir.

331
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,389
You didn't get much ofthis in jail, didn't you?

332
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,551
No sir.

333
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,362
I told you, you'll receive a wam reception!

334
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,197
Bythe dam protestor's your now a hero!

335
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,145
When they requested, I couldn't say no..
- How's your family?

336
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,882
Fine sir!

337
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:18,947
Brother! Did you come out on parole to spend time
with your family or make speeches.

338
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,920
Sir?

339
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,753
You were not suppose to make
speeches against the dam.

340
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,226
I'm sorry. sir!

341
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,125
You will not speak against the dam anymore!

342
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,670
I am sorry. sir!

343
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,780
Dirty dog!

344
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,412
I thought he would get away by killing his boss.

345
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,216
Throw him into the bushes.

346
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,962
You're always a witness.

347
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,835
No wonder why.

348
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,408
I believe your brother is in town!

349
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,178
I was wondering whether..

350
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,151
..I should send him also to the bushes.

351
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,281
Please let me go!

352
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,352
I want to see him.

353
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,630
No.
- Please

354
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,431
Ifyou will go away, who will keep my secrets?

355
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,561
Whoa easy easy

356
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,465
What ifyou do not return?

357
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,938
Howwill I win my next election with out you?

358
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,177
I need you.

359
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,583
You are my lucky mascot!

360
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,984
Just like him.

361
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,698
How long will it take for the divorce?

362
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,932
There are some formalities to take care of.

363
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,602
What is Sandra doing now?

364
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,047
Which he always does, shooting new stories.

365
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,636
Ifyour father was so worried
about Mira's horoscope..

366
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,705
..howwas he able to accept her
marring a foreigner?

367
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,408
How can you absolutely know nothing about?

368
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,272
I still dont believe this story..

369
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,017
Father, this is..

370
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,612
I know. This is Raziya. And this is Freddy.

371
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,523
Your friends from the Marine lnstitute.

372
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,797
Vinaytold us that you knowthe past,
present and future. Now I'm convinced.

373
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,528
No, Vinay has told me so much about you.

374
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:21,399
Love birds who crossed the border to nest!

375
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,942
I am a bit curious.
Is it possible to know our future?

376
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,212
Astrological progressions can only give you
an insight to opportunities and..

377
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,786
..trends from the cosmic angle.

378
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:42,315
Tell me your date, place and time of birth.
We shall see.

379
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,989
Because I understand that lndian astrology
is based on the 9 planets.

380
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,962
But Pluto's no more planet.

381
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,263
This is also based on some misunderstanding!

382
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:56,463
According to the nine star's,
only five planets are included from the solar system.

383
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:01,835
So actually it is onlythe Sun and the Moon that
has the maximum influence on our daily life.

384
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:05,540
Much more than other bodies and planets!

385
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,811
You believe that destiny cannot be changed!

386
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:13,617
Sometimes the vibrations from the hymns of the veda..

387
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,119
They can have some effect.
That is why we have the prayers.

388
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,455
Where is Mira?

389
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,956
Mira!

390
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,461
See who's here? Come!

391
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,700
Hi Mira!

392
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,078
Vinay always talked about you!

393
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,213
Mira did this, Mira did that,
never spoke of another woman.

394
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,789
He lived with your memories Mira, for years.

395
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,363
Each and every. second of it.

396
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,897
Ever since, why did you ditch him.

397
00:38:56,033 --> 00:39:00,094
Yes, I ditched, not him, but my dreams

398
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,068
Do you anything about me?

399
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,674
Do you know anything about my love?
Nothing

400
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,176
Have you ever experienced the pain
while sacrificing your love?

401
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:12,513
But I did. I have never lived for myself.

402
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,349
It's all myfaith!

403
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,846
I dont understand!

404
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,916
Come.

405
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,462
This is all he left for me.

406
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,331
I dont knowwhen I started loving him.

407
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,235
Happy birthday!

408
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,670
Thank you.

409
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,776
Father read my horoscope and discovered
that marriage would hold nothing!

410
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,512
But tragedy and sorrowfor me.

411
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:56,559
He performed many rituals and prayers
to try. cleanse me ofthis curse.

412
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,754
Vinay believed in none of it..

413
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:07,627
"Why did you leave me and go?"

414
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:13,233
"Why did you break my heart and go away?"

415
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:18,838
"Where are you now?"

416
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:23,511
"Where are you?"

417
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:28,785
'Wherever you will be.."

418
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,588
"..there shall be.."

419
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,254
I was all alone after Vinay left for his studies

420
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,631
"Will we ever meet again?"

421
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:44,902
"Will my lost love return to me?"

422
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,779
Father realized how we felt about each other.

423
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,637
He checked the compatiability of our horoscopes.

424
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:58,511
He was shocked to learn that we weren't
destined to be together even for a day.

425
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,725
He studied every. old manuscript
he could find a solution.

426
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,489
He was not able to accept a positive disaster.

427
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,665
I'm only saying what I'm seeing.

428
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,794
He revealed everything to me.

429
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,437
In the beginning I could not accept it as myfate.

430
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,639
But I knew he was never wrong in his prediction.

431
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:28,250
Whenever we tried to express our love
it was followed by a tragedy.

432
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,498
I engrossed myself in learning treatment from father
and devoted more time to practice it.

433
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:59,111
Then one day..Mark came to treat his psoriasis.

434
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,310
His wife had left him because of his skin condition.

435
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,918
Mark grew closer to me.

436
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,652
Finally he asked me to marry. him.

437
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:19,567
Father was suprised to see the compatiability
of Mark's horoscope with mine.

438
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:27,936
He believed that the rituals and prayers have
brought me this luck of one in a million chance.

439
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,239
For me it was an exit from everything.

440
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,713
And I said yes to Mark's proposal.

441
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,878
But I didn't know howto face Vinay!

442
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,282
How dare you invite me to your wedding?
Dont you know I love you?

443
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,318
You never told me.

444
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,450
All my life you lived with me and you didn't know?

445
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,700
You didn't really mean it.

446
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,807
I have made up my mind.

447
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,007
You made this for me.

448
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:26,435
"You have given me just one gift."

449
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,095
'That is only.."

450
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:33,676
'That is onlyyour memory.."

451
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:38,247
Mark was understood everything
and left very. quietly.

452
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:46,583
Accepting myfate,
I took a break from my professional study.

453
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,424
You could have told me everything!

454
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:31,458
I am sorry. this misunderstanding
has been very. painful.

455
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,299
You know there are two sides of a coin.

456
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:46,509
So close yet never knowning each other.

457
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,179
You never told me what happened with you.

458
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,650
I tried to forget.

459
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,992
And you blame me for not telling you everything.

460
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,424
You're right. I am sorry!

461
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,767
I met Sandra on my first voyage.

462
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,566
She was the daughter of my captain.

463
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,107
It was just the beginning.

464
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,444
She is beautiful.

465
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,083
We were like needles in a clock.

466
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,750
You know difference of breed,
different purposes.

467
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,990
Meeting at different times.

468
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,096
I dont even know why we even got married.

469
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,162
I didn't want Sam to grow up in
an atmosphere like this.

470
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,362
Dont worry everything will be alright!

471
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,505
There is hope.

472
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,703
You will soon have a child.

473
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,873
I can see it.

474
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:58,082
Do you have any faith in Ayurveda?

475
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,913
I've never tried it but I have faith in you.

476
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,653
Ayurveda means knowledge of life.

477
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,222
It's a 5000 years old wisdom.

478
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,396
Nature's old cures and treatments.

479
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,595
Unfortunately, not many people
practice it as it should be.

480
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:23,177
I will give you some medicine
which you must take regularly without fail.

481
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:28,341
Have faith and put that faith into practice.

482
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,215
Sam, come.

483
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,853
Sam, don't be a bad boy!

484
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,694
First let me finish your treatment for today.

485
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,499
No Mira. I want to play now.

486
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,762
Ifyou be a good boy and listen to me,
I will take you to see the damn later.

487
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,601
Really?
- Really, ok?

488
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,971
Ok
- Good boy

489
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,321
Dad, come fast.

490
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,062
I don't feel lonely right now.

491
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,970
But..
- But?

492
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,132
After you leave, I don't know.

493
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,435
Sam is my onlyworry now.

494
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,874
Because he needs his mother soon.

495
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,553
No one would be a better mother to Sam than you.

496
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,820
Ifyou say yes, I dont have to go back.

497
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,563
Am I so lucky?

498
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,565
Our horoscopes could not have changed over night!

499
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,565
Our stars are still jealous of us.

500
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,940
I am sorry. I am not questioning your beliefs.

501
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,412
But what could be worse than this? Death?

502
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,221
It's better to die than live like this.

503
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,289
But father?

504
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,191
I once failed with him and you.

505
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,591
I can't fail again.

506
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,040
Do you remember this damn?

507
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,573
I think it is also like us.

508
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,513
Holding pressure but for others.

509
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,479
Do you remember those long walks to school?

510
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,490
Yeah, in the rain.

511
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,485
That was fun.

512
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,991
Aleast it was fun with you.

513
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,360
Wow! It is drizzling!

514
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,612
Mummy!

515
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,478
Hey!

516
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,080
Hey, my little man!

517
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,950
My mummy has come.

518
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,314
Hello Vinay! Hello Mira!

519
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,085
Vinay has spoken a lot about you!

520
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,691
How are you, my boy?

521
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,065
I am good mummy and how are you?

522
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,083
Father.. I'm.. -Sandra, isn't it?

523
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,452
I knewyou'd be coming.

524
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,862
Mummy! Mummy! Where's my gift?

525
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,692
Hi! -Where's my gift? -One second..

526
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:09,499
Right here.
- Thank you, mummy. Thank you.

527
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,667
You'll catch a cold, it's wet.

528
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,057
Well, I've been in many more rains before.

529
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,130
I've always wanted to be here during
the monsoon seasons.

530
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,067
Doesn't seem to be raining much right now.

531
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:45,299
See, here the climate is always changing.

532
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,240
It's beautiful here.

533
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,172
Excuse me.

534
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,147
No microwave radiation.

535
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,414
Well actually, I did need to make a call.

536
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,952
For that you've to cross the river.

537
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,190
So, you've come to meet your son?

538
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,771
Yes, I have.

539
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,407
I'm also here doing a documentary.
on the last colonial dam.

540
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,874
Just started my research.

541
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,813
Perhaps I can help you.

542
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,014
A book on Navarasas.

543
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,911
Where did you find this?

544
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,919
I've searched so many places
for a book like this.

545
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,059
You like it then you can have it.

546
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,052
Thank you.

547
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,193
This no. 9..

548
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:46,327
..you know, is the most meaningful number
according to Vedic mathematics.

549
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:52,407
Here also it's very important
and for your dam project also.

550
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:57,075
You see, there's a water-sharing contract
with the neighbouring state for..

551
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:01,014
..999 years and legally it cannot be cancelled.

552
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:04,813
And this fight is going on and on,
for decades and decades.

553
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:11,089
So tomorrow, ifthe world war happens,
surelythe cause will be water.

554
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,155
Anymore divorce papers to sign?

555
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,399
It took me months to track you down.

556
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,595
Why can't you atleast respond to my mails?

557
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,932
I had to find some reason to come back.

558
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:28,704
Why don't you shoot a programme on diabetic children
who grow up without a other's care?

559
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,143
Look, I don't want to argue, Vinay.

560
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,680
I want my Sam back and you too.

561
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,514
Why? Has your busy schedule finally all cleared up?

562
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,180
I knowwhat I did. I'm sorry..

563
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,590
Where were you all these years?

564
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,194
But I'm here now.

565
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,089
I came back to get what I threw away.

566
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,534
I know I was wrong. And I understand you now.

567
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,994
Don't make the same mistake I made.

568
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,108
Think what this divorce would do to my child.

569
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,900
Mummy!
- Baby!

570
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,575
Mummy, see, the head is turning.
- Wow! This is so cool.

571
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,897
"Even though you reached so close to me"

572
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:37,712
"As close as I could wrap my arms around yo"

573
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:43,743
"ln this lonely and silent home unknown to all"

574
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:54,219
"Like strangers we stood...
Like total strangers, we stood apart"

575
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,103
You look great!

576
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:21,080
This city is drying.

577
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,823
There is not a single drop ofwater to drink.

578
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,121
Next election is round the corner.
Do remember that.

579
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:30,131
People are wondering why so much money
has been gone into building the new dam.

580
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,629
Are you building a dam of gold?

581
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,099
Don't make me repeat mywords.

582
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:36,763
I am sick of denying these false allegations.

583
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,534
You promised the people a new dam
five years ago.

584
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,507
And what happened? Where is the water?

585
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,808
People need water
not your election manifesto.

586
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,314
You understand one thing.
There is no sympathywave this time.

587
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,647
Your wife's maiden name won't help
you win this election.

588
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:57,215
John Brown's son is back in town. Ifwe can
convince him, we can project him as the candidate.

589
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,486
Stop this nonsense!

590
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:00,796
Stop this nonsense.

591
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,466
I.. I know that we need water.

592
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,399
And I knowthat we're delayed.

593
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,368
But we will get the dam.

594
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:12,600
You've Durai's word for it.

595
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,101
You have been saying this for the past five years.

596
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,106
Meeting is over.

597
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,541
These dams, you know, are very dangerous.

598
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,713
You know, the largest man-made disaster..

599
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,324
..is not the nuclear bomb, it's the dam disaster.

600
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:35,660
And more than 250,000 people..
they lost their lives in that.

601
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,430
And now if this dam bursts,
then 10 times more will lose their lives.

602
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:08,557
Grandpa, see,
Octopian boy can save you from anytrouble.

603
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,269
The family doctor can't believe
Sam's new diagnosis.

604
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,172
So now your insurance agent will be very. happy.

605
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,845
You must spend more time with your son.

606
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,917
I think right now, his grandfather is a better choice.

607
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,888
I've to go to the temple.
- Temple?

608
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,354
Sam, your father is not feeling well today.
- Why?

609
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,462
He's going to the temple.

610
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,515
You should go back to your family.

611
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,984
Sam needs to be with his mother.

612
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,092
How can you take your love back just like that?

613
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,996
Just deny everything. Our dreams, our love?

614
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,929
Don't be cruel. Please.

615
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,225
The stars have decided.

616
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,600
I don't have the right to return
love to anyone in my life.

617
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,065
I'm used to it by now.

618
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,275
Life can be cruel.

619
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,207
Sometimes we need to burn out for others.

620
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,851
If the flame tries to feel the pain of the wick,
it can't glow.

621
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,887
I don't have anymore dreams for myself.

622
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,184
Just let me go back to my old life.

623
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,177
I realise nowwhat I was missing.

624
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,654
I'm waiting for your nod.

625
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,456
This is going to be my last assignment.

626
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,753
Everything depends on you.
- I need time to think.

627
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,423
I haven't said yes yet.

628
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,835
You said you'd think about it.

629
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,374
That's enough for now.

630
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,981
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 5th party at our summer palace.

631
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,983
This is the last partywe're holding
at this wonderful house.

632
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,627
Oh! -Yes.. yes..

633
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,695
Our marine city will be waiting for you soon.

634
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,026
Next year, we'll partythere. -Yeah!

635
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:01,293
Yes.. yes..
and there's one more announcement.

636
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:06,274
9 months from nowthere's going to be a new cadet
coming aboard the good hip Freddy.

637
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,312
Yes.. yes.. thank you..
thank you all very. much.

638
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,746
Now let's enjoythe party.

639
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,012
Music please.

640
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,114
Freddy.

641
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,861
You forgot to invite your only brother-in-law.

642
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,796
Razia, congratulations.

643
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,765
You know,
Maria will be thrilled hearing this news.

644
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,798
Ifyou don't mind I'll take him away
for a few minutes.

645
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,213
I didn't come here to drink or dance.

646
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,174
What do you want, Durai?

647
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:54,712
They're saying, certain people have spoken
to you about running for mayor.

648
00:59:56,526 --> 01:00:00,826
If I wanted to enter your bloody game of politics,
I'd have done it a long time ago.

649
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:06,400
And lucky for you I'd rather be amongst the honest seas
than greedy land-hunters like ourself.

650
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,332
But you could get ambitious.

651
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,677
And.. you've reasons, don't you?

652
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,372
You're awaiting the next drought.

653
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,311
You've already done enough to harm me, Durai.

654
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,145
You separated me from my only sister.

655
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:30,282
Durai is not a loser.
To win he can separate anything from anybody.

656
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,525
I want you to know one thing, Freddy.

657
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,659
The rule of your dynasty is over with your father.

658
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:43,000
Don't try. and do anything stupid
to try and regain it.

659
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,703
That's not really enough to frighten a mariner.

660
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,584
You know, I was elected on a sympathy wave.

661
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:01,220
I just might get re-elected
on another sympathy wave.

662
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,918
After the death of my beloved wife.

663
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,889
Any doubts?

664
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,434
Nice music going on.

665
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,335
Enjoythe party. C'mon!

666
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,466
Durai said he would kill Maria.

667
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,176
I'll kill that bloody bastard
before he touches her again.

668
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,542
Did I forget I had a sister
and maybe she needed me?

669
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,588
Don't jump to conclusions, Freddy.

670
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,089
First find out what you don't know.

671
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:10,727
John Brown was more than a mentor to me.

672
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,423
John Brown was more than a mentor to me.

673
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,760
He was my role model. Guru.

674
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,134
Like your god.

675
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:24,068
This new dam was his dream project.

676
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,065
But he died a martyr.

677
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,541
I'm just a caretaker.

678
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,243
My mission is to complete his vision.

679
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,351
Excuse me.

680
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:40,589
Hello.

681
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,620
Okay. I'll do that.

682
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,327
Excuse me, I need to go.

683
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,967
Can we complete this later?
- It's ok. I can wait.

684
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,171
Ifyou need anything, just ask for it.
Excuse me.

685
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,391
Maria.
- Who are you?

686
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,861
I'm Sandra, Freddy's friend.

687
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,733
Freddy! How's my Freddy?

688
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,200
Where's he?
- Freddy's alright.

689
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,303
But he's worried.
- Tell him I'm alive.

690
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,546
We knowwhat's going on here, ok?

691
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,080
Be readytonight, we'll be back.

692
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,987
Be careful. Durai's dangerous.

693
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,960
Don't worry, leave it to us.

694
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,552
Let's do it, Rambo.

695
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,801
You'll be safe here.

696
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,640
Let's get this mess cleaned up.

697
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,505
We'll be right back.
- Thank you.

698
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,281
I'll take you away from here forever.

699
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,945
Freddy, I've to tell you something.
- What?

700
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,557
Our father wasn't murdered.
- What do you mean?

701
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,293
He committed suicide.
- What?!

702
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,766
He's doing it for us.

703
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,571
Durai! Cheat! How dare you?

704
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,304
This must be scrapped!

705
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,310
Do you know how many people got killed
in today's police firing?

706
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,518
I'll not let you kill my people again.

707
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:35,822
We found out about you.
- To hell with your findings.

708
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,150
What?!

709
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:41,162
Isn't this your signature, Mr. Mayor?

710
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:47,267
Your people, the same people you're
speaking of protecting, will soon spit n you.

711
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,094
I beg you, Durai. Please don't.

712
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,907
Tomorrowyou've till tomorrow to close this or else..

713
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,636
..I'll decide what to do next.

714
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,274
Is that what you reallywant?

715
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,717
Please don't do this, Durai.

716
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,251
Please, I'm begging you..
- Shut up.

717
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,480
Don't do this to myfather please..
- Shut up!

718
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,021
I'll not let you do it.

719
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,528
Not while I'm alive.

720
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,052
Why are you crying for me?

721
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,281
Try. crying for your dad.

722
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,834
The servant lied to the police.

723
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,940
And then again in court,
to make it look like a murder.

724
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,135
Durai easilywon the election.

725
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,970
I think she left the country..
- No way.

726
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,637
Her passport is with me.

727
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,238
Shall we go to the police?

728
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,145
Is police more capable than Durai?

729
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,477
Comb the entire city.

730
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,950
Track all his calls and moves.

731
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,387
Make sure this matter doesn't leak out.

732
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:20,851
Cause if it does.
It'll jeopardise the entire election victory..

733
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:23,163
Search inside

734
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:23,731
What you want?

735
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,356
Don't interfere you son of a bitch!

736
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,801
Hey! Don't use that kind of language here,
Durai. This is not your party office.

737
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,072
Go search!

738
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,607
Did you forget something at the party?

739
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,508
I think I did.

740
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,508
Relax, You are in safe hands.

741
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,985
Boss, she is not here.

742
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,089
You checked every.where?
- Yes.

743
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,516
Move in

744
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:33,167
Freddy, don't ever playwith Durai.
I know she is in the city. And I will get her.

745
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:41,004
Ayurveda doesn't work on medicines only.

746
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,475
Results really depend on your lifestyle.

747
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,246
Dad, I've some good news for you.

748
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:51,318
Tell me.

749
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,685
The inauguration date for the new dam
has been fixed.

750
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,454
I think I could showthe last sunset now.

751
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,121
When is it? -On the 9th.

752
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,393
Another 999.

753
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:09,095
Oh my god! Mira! Mira!

754
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,998
It's a bad omen.

755
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,501
Disaster.

756
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,518
Tomorrow, we'll go live as planned.

757
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,781
I'll send you a mail. Ok, bye.

758
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,753
Let's make a move. -Alright.

759
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,104
When do you need to go, son?

760
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,608
Tomorrow.

761
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,881
Ifyou must go then go today itself.

762
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,888
Tomorrow is not an auspicious day.

763
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,960
Bad times, omens, I can't believe
you're still going on and on about all his.

764
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,894
It's my belief, myfeeling.

765
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,732
Something terrible is going to happen.

766
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,434
Sam will go away.

767
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,971
He must..

768
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:27,309
..atleast he should not grow up without his mother.

769
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,824
Sam. Hey Sam!

770
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,296
Sam.

771
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:51,135
She has given up all her dreams.

772
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:57,138
I have not been able to give her anything back.

773
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,674
Sam, c'mon. Don't be a bad boy.

774
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,408
Sam! Sam! Honey, please take your medicines.

775
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,450
My documentary. is going live in the evening.

776
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,284
Please do watch it. -I'll try..

777
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,456
Come back before dinner,
it'd be our last meal together.

778
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,295
I'll surely do my best to make it.

779
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,273
I'm still waiting for an answer, honey.

780
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,469
Let's be optimistic.

781
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,345
I'll see you in the evening.

782
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,112
Sam, you're a healthy boy now.

783
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,782
But don't forget to take your medicines, ok?
- Okay.

784
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,314
But Mira, why are you so sad?

785
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:49,491
When you reach home, will you remember me?
- Yes.

786
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,674
Come with us, Mira.
- I can't.

787
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,573
Please.
- Sam, I can't come.

788
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,644
Grandpa.

789
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,216
You've put all his medicines?
- Yes. -Show.

790
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,922
Grandpa, I'm a healthy boy now.

791
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,949
You're a strong boy.

792
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,930
Now, don't need this.

793
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,923
So, we'll remove it.

794
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,162
Throw it.

795
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,039
"Salutations, O motherland!"

796
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,907
"Salutations, O motherland!"

797
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,642
"Salutations, O motherland!"

798
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,445
This urban dam has completed
100 years of existence.

799
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,980
This is the last sunset for this colonial dam.

800
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,955
It'd witnessed an empire on
which the sun never used to set.

801
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,526
It has witnessed its decline.

802
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,626
Tomorrow it becomes just an underwater monument.

803
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:02,693
A reminder of the long gone colonial era as dam 999.

804
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,463
Pack up.
- Ok.

805
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,311
Great Job guys
- thanks.

806
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,614
Thank you, ma'am.
- Welcome

807
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,017
What happened?

808
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:27,193
Hope it's not the calm before the storm.

809
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,163
Yes, looks like a heavy rain is building up.

810
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,799
Let's go to the new dam.

811
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,103
We need to plan for tomorrow's coverage.

812
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,911
It's time to say goodbye.

813
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:57,649
I was so lonely.

814
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,721
I just couldn't stop thinking of you.

815
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,164
Its fate.

816
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,862
Well, I don't believe in that crap anymore.

817
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:08,800
We've a chance.

818
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,137
Vinay, it's for you.

819
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,207
I could never take a chance with your life.

820
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,267
My faith won't let me.

821
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:21,277
I was always afraid to come to this house.

822
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,782
For me this place has never
been complete without you.

823
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,515
You're always with me.

824
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,160
Close to me, in my heart.

825
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,394
I told you, it's my fate.

826
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,130
No, our fate.

827
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,840
I can't leave you to fate anymore.

828
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,023
Come, let's go inside.

829
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,496
It's going to rain now.
- No grandpa, it's not raining.

830
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,361
C'mon.. c'mon..

831
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,494
Where's your dad? -lnside.

832
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,129
Really?
- Yeah.

833
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,405
Can I have that?

834
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,631
It's a miracle!

835
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:25,926
I can't believe it.
- You should thank Mira for this.

836
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,831
All I did was obey her.

837
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,096
Thank you so much, Mira.
Thank you.

838
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,531
Thank you.

839
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,702
See this sis, passport and the cds.

840
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,504
Welcome to the world of menace.

841
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,990
Sir, thank you for your support.
- You're welcome.

842
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,366
Oh damn it! I'm late.

843
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,464
And all this rain..
- What do you expect?

844
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,730
It's been burning for the
past few days in the mountains.

845
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,306
The heaviest rainfall ever been recorded.

846
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:16,008
See, there's a low pressure formation
moving from East towards us.

847
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,952
What's going on? What?!

848
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,992
Oh my god! Damn it!

849
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,206
Stop filling the dam.
- What?!

850
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,908
You heard it. Stop fillind the dam
and open the bi-valve shutter.

851
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,283
But we need special permission for that.
- Then get it.

852
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,418
Sir, what about the inauguration?

853
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,755
Opening the shutter would flood the axis road.

854
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,259
Inauguration? The whole place will be under water
and you're talking about he inauguration?

855
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,991
We'll have to call the mayor, sir.
- I said get him on the line right now.

856
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:07,194
I said right now.

857
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,260
Sir, you know he won't give us permission.

858
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,735
This dam won't take anyone's
permission to collapse.

859
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:16,772
There's another way out.
- What?

860
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,039
We can close the old dam's shutters partially.
- No way.

861
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,207
Water level at the dam has already
reached the maximum level.

862
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,678
Ifwe try. to pull back anymore water,
that's the end.

863
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:33,824
Oh my god!

864
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,322
The altitude of this place is around 3000 feet.

865
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:42,000
If it breaks, the water will rush like a bullet
and sweep the city in her loods.

866
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,204
Let me talk to the mayor.

867
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,671
Please try.to understand the situation, sir.

868
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,346
The dam is not even tested once.
- What?

869
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,242
You're scared of a little hole.

870
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:00,254
Go and check out the old dam,
it has a lot of them.

871
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:02,614
And it has lasted more than 100 years.

872
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,317
But this is a concrete dam, it won't sustain.

873
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,258
We'd decided we shall not fill it
to capacity right?

874
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,261
Let's get on with the inauguration and..

875
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,131
..Iater we shall test it or fix it.. whatever.

876
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,899
Are you crazy? Don't talk like an idiot.

877
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:21,702
Shut up! You got your share, right?

878
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:26,707
Right? If anyone else comes to know about it..

879
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,782
..do I need to tell you what will happen?

880
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:32,648
If the dam collapses,
2.5 million people will be washed away.

881
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:35,950
Just follow my orders. Follow my orders!

882
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,150
The inauguration is going to happen tomorrow.

883
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,088
The press will be there,
the dignitaries will be there.

884
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:44,925
And so will you be.
I want you there in time.

885
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:50,060
Thank you.
- Hello.. hello.. stupid.

886
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:54,904
Ifthis dam bursts,
10 times more people will lose their lives.

887
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,083
Oh crap! The lines are down.

888
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,251
In the present inflow rate, how long will it take
for the dam to collapse?

889
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,083
4-5 hours.

890
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,120
We've enough time to move
our families to safer places.

891
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,194
Let's go. Come.

892
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:17,960
Sir.

893
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:23,004
Sir, aren't you leaving?
- Just get out of this place.

894
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,631
Don't be stupid.
- Let me see what I can do.

895
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:30,538
Sir, we've to save this place. We've to do it.

896
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,408
Hey man! Think about your family.

897
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,471
No, sir. I won't go.

898
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,751
And you, get your crew and get out of here.

899
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,786
You can cover a big disaster.

900
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,856
Excuse me, but what makes you so sure
that this dam will burst?

901
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:51,193
The way it was constructed.
It's my design.

902
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,426
I was bribed bythat bloody Durai.

903
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,765
But when I realised the danger,
I informed the mayor.

904
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,636
But before he could do something,
he was killed on the same day.

905
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:05,035
You said there's something left to do.
- What's left? This dead phone?

906
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,017
I've a satellite phone in the van.
Inform the higher authorities.

907
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,348
Also we have up linking facility.

908
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,580
Lets alert the media, we still have time.

909
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,123
But who's going to take
this small leak seriously?

910
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,189
No one.

911
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,926
Relax. It's not too late.

912
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:29,534
Let's break the rules.
- Ok, come.

913
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:38,311
If we can open the bypass shutter,
we've a chance.

914
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,744
Why don't you open the
shutters of this new dam?

915
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,840
But water will take a few more hours
to reach the shutter level.

916
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:44,917
Lets open the bypass shutter.

917
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:47,917
Before we open the shutter we need to
give a lood alert to the public.

918
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,557
You leave that to me.

919
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,158
The main power is out.

920
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,530
You try.to reach the alert.

921
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,028
Show on the way.
- C'mon! Hurry. up!

922
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,101
Hurry. up!

923
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,305
Damn it. He's acting fast.

924
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,837
The police doesn't want the news to leak out.

925
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,148
Let's go. We need a vehicle.
- Ok.

926
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,046
We need to get out of here right now.

927
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:53,552
The new dam is going to burst
and it's already started leaking.

928
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,316
What do you mean?
- lt'll stayfor a few more hours.

929
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,484
Anything can happen after that.
- You mean the whole place will be flooded? Exactly.

930
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,628
Everything is captured in this.

931
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,435
We need to playthis video
at the local cable TV station.

932
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,571
If Maria talks, people will believe.

933
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,970
Well let's go then, we need to reach
the sea to make all this happen.

934
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,078
But before we do that,
we need to move every.one here to a safer place.

935
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,703
The church on the hilltop
is the only option right now.

936
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,475
We've to move

937
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,716
How many boats do we have?
- Two. A speedboat and a houseboat.

938
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,081
Listen, Razia and Mira can take dad,
Sam and the other patients in the boat.

939
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,385
Let Freddytake Maria into the ship.

940
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,991
Vinay, go with Freddy, reach the cable TV station.

941
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,463
Try. to convince them. Try.for repeat runs.

942
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,133
I've to get back to the dam site.

943
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:53,940
You didn't give me a reply.

944
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,622
I guess I was a little late getting here.

945
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:08,494
Don't worry. about me.

946
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:12,030
For me there will always be
another assignment waiting.

947
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:24,173
Be careful.
- You too.

948
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,556
Go with Razia and Mira.

949
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,027
I'll come back soon. Ok?

950
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:42,754
Take care.

951
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,368
C'mon guys, let's move.

952
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,557
Take care ofyourself and junior, alright?

953
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:28,006
I've to go.

954
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,942
It's time to go.
- Ok. -I'll carry.you alright? -Yeah.

955
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,582
Call father! Meera, let's not waste time. Call him.

956
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:14,178
He's still praying

957
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:16,550
The boat is waiting for us

958
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:27,699
All ofyou can leave now.

959
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:32,402
My prayers and blessings will always be with you.

960
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:41,882
He won't come Raziya

961
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,747
He can't, He's never crossed
this river since his wife's death.

962
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:49,390
Let's praythat nothing happens to him.
We should go.

963
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:49,922
I'm not coming

964
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:50,990
What?

965
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,922
I can't come leaving him here like this.

966
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:54,822
Don't talk rubbish. You have to come.

967
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,396
The man sitting inside is my Father!

968
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:04,162
Sam let's go.
- No, I won't

969
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,202
Now be a good boy.
Don't be stubborn OK...

970
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,538
And I will come and see you. OK?

971
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:11,712
OK

972
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:13,612
Now give me a hug.

973
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,108
Come let's go.

974
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:31,189
Prayfor metoo..

975
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:08,728
Oh no!

976
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,808
Oh crap!
- Damn it!

977
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,310
Is there any other way?
- We can go through the forest.

978
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,675
But it'll take more time.
- Let's do it. -Ok.

979
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:21,746
Go back.

980
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,362
I'll do as you.

981
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,695
Ancient form.

982
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:44,796
Right now you just enjoyyourselves.

983
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,508
Yes! Greetings.

984
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,103
How are you?

985
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:55,209
Hey!

986
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:14,264
There's a leak in the dam and the dam
will burst in a matter of hours.

987
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,666
The lives ofthousands are under threat.

988
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:20,865
I request you to leave to
high altitudes immediately.

989
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:24,373
There's a leak in the dam and
the dam will burst in a matter of hours.

990
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:26,811
The lives of thousands are under threat.

991
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:31,009
I request you to leave to high altitudes immediately.

992
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:35,684
C'mon fast..

993
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:05,979
Stop it! -Hey!

994
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,177
Hey! Stop it!

995
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:08,384
Stop it!

996
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:22,896
Who asked you to telecast this?

997
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:29,032
Where is he?
- He's in the editing suite.

998
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,172
Where?
- Upstairs.

999
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:34,877
Get him.
- Ok, sir.

1000
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:45,953
Where is his place?

1001
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,120
It's near the dam. He himselfwill show us.

1002
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,448
All failed. -What do you mean?

1003
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:17,843
This whole place is flooding.
- So what?

1004
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:20,954
We don't have a neumatic system
to open the bypass shutters.

1005
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,883
Yeah. We should go for that.

1006
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,357
But the opening valve is under water.

1007
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:29,221
Can we give it a try?
- Yes, we should.

1008
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,331
But it's too risky.
- No, sir.

1009
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:35,194
Ifwe have an option, we should try..
- Ok.

1010
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,766
Look here, this is the shutter drive.

1011
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:43,034
This is the first valve, this is the other valve.

1012
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:46,146
All valves are to be simultaneously opened
to get sufficient pressure.

1013
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,716
Ok, sir. Take care of the shutter.

1014
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,608
At exactly five minutes, we'll open the valve.

1015
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:53,742
C'mon, Sandra.

1016
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:02,851
Daddy!

1017
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:10,964
Where's dad and Mira?

1018
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:12,802
Where are they?

1019
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:15,767
They didn't come.
- What?!

1020
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:20,975
Father refused to come and Mira..
she couldn't leave without him.

1021
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,706
Oh no!

1022
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:39,399
We should turn all the valves.

1023
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:40,966
Just turn it this way.

1024
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:43,870
I'll showyou the other one.
- Ok.

1025
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,868
Oh shit! It's totallyflooded.

1026
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:54,581
You open the first valve,
I'll take care of the other.

1027
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,776
We only have 3 minutes.
- Good luck

1028
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:12,684
Earthquake!

1029
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:21,718
Careful.

1030
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,390
Come fast.

1031
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:33,602
Oh god! Sir!

1032
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,539
Sir! Sir!

1033
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:15,902
An earthquake of 6.5 magnitude
was recorded on the Richter scale..

1034
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:18,766
..causing the over-filled century. old dam to burst.

1035
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:21,566
In just half an hour,
the entire citywas washed away.

1036
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,007
No more dams exist in this place.

1037
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:29,878
It took 15 years for the world to come to know
about the 1975 dam disaster in China,..

1038
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:35,354
..where hundreds of thousands of lives got perished.
The series of dam disasters doesn't stop here.

1039
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,718
With over 4000 similar outdated dams across the world..

1040
01:41:38,859 --> 01:41:41,054
..potential threat to life remains unanswered.

1041
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:44,096
Do we stop this or should
we just wait for another disaster to happen.

1042
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:48,467
This is the world's biggest disaster ever.
Is it the anger of Mother Nature?

1043
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,194
Or the wrong doings of human beings?

1044
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:51,923
Scared of a little hole.

1045
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:54,467
Go and check out the old dam.

1046
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:58,435
It has a lot ofthem and
it has lasted more than 100 years.

1047
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:01,664
Much longer than you and I will live.

1048
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:11,035
Can you try?

1049
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,476
Ok.

1050
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:19,347
I'll do my best.
- Good.

1051
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:00,223
Charles, this is Sandra.

1052
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,021
Good evening, lovelyto meet you.

1053
01:45:02,195 --> 01:45:03,787
And Vinay.
- Hi, Vinay.

1054
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:05,124
And this little man is Sam.

1055
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:06,892
Hi, Sam. -Hi!

1056
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:09,629
Please excuse me.

1057
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:21,645
Vinay.
- I thought I saw Mira.

1058
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,280
No, Vinay.

1059
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:30,517
Vinay, look..

1060
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,529
Vinay! Stop!

1061
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:41,022
Please!

1062
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:46,363
Mira!
- Vinay, please stop!

1063
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,273
Mira!

1064
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:55,005
Vinay! It's your imagination.

1065
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:56,573
I saw her.

1066
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:59,012
I saw her.

1067
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,578
I saw her.

1068
01:46:05,092 --> 01:46:09,586
Alright you two we have another function to attend.
So see you later this evening. Alright?

1069
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,029
See you later Sam!

1070
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:20,600
Freddy, you think we made a mistake
with the ending of the story?

1071
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:21,730
What do you mean?

1072
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:26,474
I think Mira's alive out there somewhere.

1073
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:31,245
Well, the novel's already published
but there's always room for a sequel.

1074
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:35,116
C'mon. There's life even after death.

1075
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:37,453
It's in the memory..

1076
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:39,555
That Mira lives in Vinay's memories.
