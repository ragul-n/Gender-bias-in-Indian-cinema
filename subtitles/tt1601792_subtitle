1
00:00:55,232 --> 00:01:00,693
"Those four!"

2
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,977
Dear... dear...
I'm calling you only.

3
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,819
I said yes, go ahead.

4
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:19,946
I'm not getting sleep.

5
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,555
Why are you hesitating?
Put your hand...

6
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,557
Trust me, I'm not getting sleep.

7
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,400
Dear...

8
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,730
I never expected you'll get
an open top. - Open top?

9
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:36,170
Bald head.

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,499
I never expected
you'll go bald.

11
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:40,968
What if I'm bald now?

12
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:43,970
If I knew you'll go bald,
would I've married you?

13
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:47,080
Now that I'm bald,
will you divorce me?

14
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:48,410
I would've divorced you,

15
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,986
but getting a partner at this
age is little difficult.

16
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,753
That's why I'm in a dilemma.

17
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,256
True! Who will marry
you at this age?

18
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:01,591
I didn't mean a partner
for me but for you.

19
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:02,924
Hey, leave me.

20
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,432
Actually you're responsible
for my baldness. Leave me.

21
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,205
Sorry.

22
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:20,280
Why feel sorry now?
I'm already bald.

23
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,952
The sorry wasn't for it.
- But why?

24
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:26,945
I gave you a lot of trouble,
the sorry was for that.

25
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,220
From tomorrow
I'll make you cry.

26
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:34,222
You can never do that.

27
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:43,368
Bharathi, I'm not getting sleep,
put your hand on me.

28
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,324
Hey Katakata!
- Tell me, Takataka!

29
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,195
Calling me by name?

30
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,428
I didn't call you by name,

31
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:54,604
I told you, tell me fast what you
want to say. That's all!

32
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,774
Hey Hell boy!
Why are you blabbering?

33
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,773
I swear on our Lord,
I'll cut your throat.

34
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:03,446
Okay, you can do it later,
but do your duty first.

35
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:06,775
I'll see... l'll see...
how you'll work?

36
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:09,612
The life we must take now
is in this body only.

37
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,948
Why are you hesitating?
Come, let's take his life quickly.

38
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,124
Stop!

39
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:17,350
The labour pain a mother goes
through to deliver her child,

40
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:21,286
soul too goes through the
same pain to leave a body.

41
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:24,467
So take a firm foothold and
then pull out the soul.

42
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:27,364
Only then the soul will come
out from the body.

43
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,974
But looking at his face tells me,
we needn't take much trouble.

44
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:34,303
Just a pat to wake him and
he'll reach hell before us.

45
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,309
Are you challenging my long
years of experience?

46
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,478
Look at my horns,
they are bigger than yours.

47
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,651
But has very little brain.

48
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:42,986
Don't get angry.

49
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:46,384
Sometimes my ideas are sharper
than your horn. - Is it?

50
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,782
Then wake him up.

51
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,052
If the soul wakes up on your pat,
I'll give anything you ask.

52
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,824
If you lose, you should
never go against me.

53
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,056
As you say.

54
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:06,807
I've won! L've won!
...l've won!

55
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,809
Shut up! Stop jumping,
I accept you've won.

56
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:11,538
Make your wish,
I'll grant it.

57
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:13,813
Now I don't have any wish,

58
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:14,985
but I'll make the wish
some other time.

59
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,083
Okay, as you wish.

60
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,164
Mr. Raghuram, you are dead.

61
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:36,771
Come, let's go to our world.

62
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:40,241
Am I dead...?

63
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:42,777
Yes, you are dead.

64
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:47,112
She'll not hear your shouts.

65
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:53,182
Have you understood now?
You are dead. Come, let's go.

66
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,023
What about me?
- Where're you going? Come, let's go.

67
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,566
Wow! The sun is rising!

68
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,401
You've gone down! Come!

69
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:15,077
Stop men! Let me see it
for sometime.

70
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,414
I always loved to
see the rising sun.

71
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:18,740
Where are you going?

72
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,416
You may kiss just
because you like it.

73
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,244
Even Lord Hanuman hasn't
recovered till now.

74
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,087
Oh! My wife is crying!

75
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,425
Why are you so surprized?

76
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,594
Won't your wife cry on your death?
Come, let's go.

77
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:35,424
Let's go... but I've a little request,
you must fulfill it.

78
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,429
We are not angels
to fulfill wishes.

79
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,602
Moreover gods are no jokes.

80
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:42,431
You've to do great penance to
make them appear and get boons.

81
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,106
But we appear though you
don't do any penance.

82
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,276
Though we appear, we are not
powerful enough to grant boons.

83
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:51,107
No sir, they say you need atleast
four people as pallbearers,

84
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,612
Now I'm dead.

85
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:55,216
Four people who have come
to carry my body,

86
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:57,616
I wish to hear them,
what they talk & how they look.

87
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:59,789
We feel like going away from
here immediately, come.

88
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,618
Come, let's go.
- Come. - Sir!

89
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,123
Stop sir!

90
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm dead for the first time,

91
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,458
I'll lose my relationship with
this world from today.

92
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,066
I wish to see
my funeral procession.

93
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:14,463
Let's stay here till they
lit pyre to my body,

94
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,138
please fulfill my last wish.

95
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:18,801
This is not your last wish,

96
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,306
this is your first wish
after your death.

97
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:22,144
Moreover there's no end
to man's wishes.

98
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,644
The moment one is fulfilled,
a new wish follows.

99
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,975
We can't fulfill any of your wish,
come on get going... move...

100
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:28,481
Guru, he has made a strange wish.

101
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:30,812
Let him see it.
What will happen?

102
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,818
Why are you blabbering?
- Guru!

103
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,491
If there's any delay,
I owe an explanation to Lord Yama.

104
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,159
Guru... - What?

105
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,159
Many have asked this
as their last wish,

106
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:41,991
ever since I've joined as
the messenger of death,

107
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,666
I've not seen any funeral procession,

108
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,494
I too have a strong
desire to see, guru.

109
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:47,169
Why don't you listen to me?

110
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,999
Guru, you lost the bet
a little while ago and I won.

111
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,674
This is my wish, you have
to fulfill it. That's all!

112
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,842
That's all? - Yes.

113
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,032
Then, as you wish.

114
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:57,009
I think you are very anxious
before reaching hell,

115
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:58,511
watch the hell here only.

116
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,343
Thank you very much for
accepting my request.

117
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,184
Look, how much my wife loves me.

118
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,516
Look, how she's crying
over my death.

119
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,718
Why are you laughing?
- Nothing...

120
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,548
First time we're seeing a wife
who loves her husband so much.

121
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,724
Husband's body is
still in the house,

122
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:43,222
she's eating upma
in the kitchen,

123
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:45,554
what else can we do other than laugh.
- What's wrong if she eats?

124
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:48,230
Eating upma doesn't mean
she doesn't love her husband.

125
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:50,059
You need energy to cry also.

126
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:53,566
Anyway you are defending
your wife very well.

127
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,739
We'll tell just like that whether
your wife loves you or not,

128
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,908
just answer our questions.

129
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:02,574
Is yours arranged marriage
or love marriage?

130
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:03,905
Arranged marriage.

131
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,416
Did you take dowry or not?

132
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:09,415
I did take dowry.
- That's it!

133
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:14,086
Any wife will be angry on her
husband who takes dowry.

134
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,918
The anger comes out on
such occasions only.

135
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:17,923
Oh No! You've mistaken me.

136
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:20,426
I had taken dowry under
a different circumstance.

137
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,655
What's that circumstance?

138
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,930
Bride knows music very well.

139
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,262
She's a good singer.
- Stop!

140
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:31,270
I like the girl,
I don't want any dowry.

141
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:34,103
I'm thinking of getting married
in a Registrar's Office.

142
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,871
My son always had
modern thoughts.

143
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:40,943
He wants to marry
without taking dowry.

144
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:43,676
He's a role model to
the new generation.

145
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,622
The bride wants to talk
to the groom.

146
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,954
I thought you were orthodox
looking at your dress.

147
00:10:53,163 --> 00:10:55,028
You are a modern girl.
- Come.

148
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:02,233
Don't start reciting poems
finding the girl alone.

149
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:06,040
All have left, we can talk now.

150
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,371
What did you study?

151
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,315
Mmm... M.A., Journalism.

152
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,381
Are you a man of modern thought?

153
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:18,309
I mean...
people around me... say so.

154
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:22,322
So, you don't know what you're
till people around tell you.

155
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:23,720
It's difficult with you.

156
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:26,492
Do you put your leg on person
sleeping next to you?

157
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:30,326
No... moreover till now I've never
slept next to anyone.

158
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,831
I've that habit. - What?

159
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,726
I used to sleep next
to my mother.

160
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:35,068
One more thing...

161
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,670
when I get angry,
I'll call informally.

162
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,271
If you get more angry.
- I'll call names.

163
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:41,340
If you get furious in anger.

164
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,172
I'll strangle the neck
under my feet.

165
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,347
Do you've any objections?

166
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:47,016
What's there to object after
my neck is under your feet?

167
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,353
Do you like me?

168
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:54,012
I mean... you've extreme thoughts...
Jingoistic thoughts...

169
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,851
Don't prolong it.
- I like you.

170
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,491
Can I ask a question?
- You can.

171
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:02,031
We never met earlier.

172
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:05,429
What's your idea in calling me
informally on seeing me?

173
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,631
Is this your first time
to meet a bride? - Yes.

174
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,371
This is my 100th proposal.

175
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:13,373
I got vexed respecting every
fool who came to see me.

176
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,378
Why did you refuse
to take dowry?

177
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,844
I'm against dowry.
- Stop it!

178
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:22,051
Is it to boast later that you
didn't take dowry to marry me?

179
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:25,881
Marrying me without taking dowry
like a man of modern thought,

180
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,784
you needn't give any life to me.

181
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,388
Moreover we are not poor,

182
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,719
we are comfortable
to some extent.

183
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:33,725
So, I'll marry giving you dowry.

184
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,989
I'll marry you,
only if you take dowry.

185
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,930
I'll call all of them inside.

186
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:45,230
You must accept before
them of taking dowry.

187
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,068
Or else I'll refuse this proposal.

188
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,237
Okay.

189
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:52,415
That's it! I had to take dowry.

190
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,083
After hearing you,

191
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,912
I'm not surprised that your
wife is eating upma.

192
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,079
When she bossed over him on
the day he came to see her,

193
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,758
won't she eat on his death?

194
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,598
My daughter!

195
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:10,759
My daughter too loves me!

196
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:14,763
Indra! How did your father die?
- I don't know!

197
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:17,769
When did he died?
- I don't know!

198
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:19,438
Did he have any heart attack?

199
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,770
Oh! Heart attack or angry on us?

200
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,445
Why don't you listen if I
say he died in his sleep?

201
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,282
What's this man?

202
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,950
Even his daughter abhors him.

203
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,278
I think daughter is more
educated than his wife.

204
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,784
How can she not abhor him?

205
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:33,455
You've mistaken.

206
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,454
How does she know
how I had died?

207
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:36,455
She's just a little girl.

208
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,289
Did you want to see this & made a wish
to be here till consumed to fire?

209
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:42,965
Look there!

210
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,963
My close friend Subrahmanyam
is coming.

211
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:47,695
So what?

212
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:50,134
He too loves you very much?

213
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,372
Yes. - Oh?

214
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,634
My Subbu loves me very much.

215
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:55,311
Our friendship is great.

216
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,806
He was always with me
through thick and thin.

217
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:00,141
But why hasn't he come
along with you now?

218
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:04,142
He'll be sad for my early death
and not coming along with me.

219
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:06,982
Now watch! He'll cry his
heart out falling on my body.

220
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,317
Cry his heart out?
Let's watch it.

221
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:23,301
It's me Subbu speaking...
- Tell me...

222
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,608
Come immediately
to Raghuram's house.

223
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:26,673
Why? What happened?

224
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,674
Atlast our Raghuram has
done a good thing.

225
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,573
What?

226
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,439
He has died.

227
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,744
He never did anything
better than this.

228
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:34,012
Come immediately.

229
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:38,184
You said he's your bosom friend.

230
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:41,016
You said he'll cry his heart out
falling on your body.

231
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,418
Did you hear what he said?

232
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:44,685
It seems you did a
good thing by dying.

233
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:49,354
No... I had a little tiff with
him before my death.

234
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:50,692
I think he still has a grouse,

235
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:52,368
otherwise he's always
affectionate on me.

236
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,194
Stop it!

237
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:54,529
Why are you lying?

238
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,874
Are we not seeing the love
your people have on you?

239
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:00,175
Enough of watching it,
come let's go. - Come...

240
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,378
Sir... one more small request.

241
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,377
There are neighbours and friends,
let's wait till they too come.

242
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:06,207
What's this man?

243
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,974
Even after all this
haven't you got sense?

244
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:10,549
When people in your home
don't love you?

245
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,221
How can neighbours
and friends love you?

246
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:14,219
Not a soul will come to
pay respects to your body.

247
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,652
You would've done all useless
things when you were alive.

248
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,054
That's why you have died unwept.

249
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,387
That's why people say...

250
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:23,054
be good to four people
and love four people.

251
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,733
I think you've failed to do it.

252
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:27,403
Who will be your pallbearers
and who will lit pyre to you?

253
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:28,901
You've mistaken me.

254
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,474
I had done the same
till I was alive.

255
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:35,307
I loved everyone and
shared love with them.

256
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:36,239
What's it man?

257
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,414
When you love them,
why will they not reciprocate it?

258
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:40,742
They say money rules man's life.

259
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,248
But I say it's love.

260
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,511
I didn't listen to them.
They didn't listen to me.

261
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,586
I had this trouble
with them all my life.

262
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,418
Anyway, who won the duel?
You or they?

263
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:52,088
To know the winner,

264
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:55,094
you've to wait till
my body is cremated.

265
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,391
You must know my story.

266
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:14,006
O Lord Rama, lord of Seetha!
Liberate us!

267
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:19,519
Blue complexioned Lord!

268
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:22,021
Take us in the
right path, Adi Sankara!

269
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:55,722
Another day has dawned
for you and me...

270
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:59,555
Happiness and enthusiasm
is flowing out from the heart...

271
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,728
Open the doors to the heart...

272
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,729
Remove the curtains
of differences...

273
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,392
Invite the first rays
of a new dawn...

274
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:14,407
Good morning to all of you!

275
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:34,589
Mallaiah! Did all get bonus?

276
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,094
Give this to the Editorial.

277
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:41,600
Please sit down.

278
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,437
Sir, the fortune predictions I write,

279
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:48,270
appear in all daily, weekly
and monthly magazines.

280
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,775
Except yours.

281
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,043
So I'm here to tell you to publish
my predictions in your magazine.

282
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,287
Tell me how will my day be?

283
00:17:58,488 --> 00:17:59,887
Tell me your zodiac sign.
- I don't know.

284
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,614
Then tell me your date of birth,
I'll tell you.

285
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:02,621
July 19th.

286
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:03,952
July 19th...

287
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:05,786
No use...

288
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,623
You shouldn't do any work today.

289
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,458
Then your write up on fortune
will not get published.

290
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,196
Just now you told me not
to do any work today.

291
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:12,959
Not that sir...

292
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:15,967
Nothing doing, without hard work
nothing is possible.

293
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,139
Not that sir...

294
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:18,806
They said efforts will never fail.

295
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,476
Nobody has said zodiac signs
will get you success.

296
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:21,644
You may go now.

297
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,421
Here's your salary.

298
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,321
Please sign here.

299
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:27,206
The power that fills
light into lives...

300
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,709
Present us the power...

301
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:33,382
Ocean of mercy...

302
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,882
Present us...

303
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:49,856
Lord! Look after these
innocent kids with care!

304
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,328
Let's turn our smiles
into flowers...

305
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,370
Let's turn flowers
into moonbeam...

306
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:58,029
Let's turn mischief
into a song...

307
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,436
Let's impound tears in eyes...

308
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,077
Let's give a holiday
to difficulties...

309
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:04,405
Let's enjoy the happiness...

310
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,284
This world has bloomed
beautifully... our world!

311
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:15,388
Shall we welcome
happily another day?

312
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,614
Hey! You want to die man!?

313
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,116
I want an auto please.

314
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,618
You come. - Get in.
Please make him sit inside.

315
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:47,949
Please sit inside the auto.

316
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,626
Sit... sit... don't run away.

317
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:56,454
Listen to me... don't run...

318
00:20:58,501 --> 00:20:59,297
You?!

319
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:28,755
You too come... you too come...

320
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:29,829
I'll come.
You too come...

321
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:32,331
I'll come...
- You too come

322
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,837
I've come to know you've
adopted ten patients here,

323
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,165
and taking care of them.

324
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,839
Who are you sir?
- Me?

325
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,170
I'm District Collector.

326
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:43,842
Don't say that aloud.

327
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,844
They have brought me
here for saying that.

328
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,179
There is no good man
in this world than you...

329
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:02,528
Hypocrites who act like good
are the real mad people...

330
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:08,037
Mad after money,
mad after power...

331
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,035
We don't need it friends...

332
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:13,705
Madness of deception which
has inflicted mankind...

333
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:16,045
Madness of destruction...
madness of hatred...

334
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,077
It's out of bounds in this fort...

335
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:22,077
You are the Supreme Lords!

336
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:24,550
Laugh... laugh...

337
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,884
Teach us also...

338
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:34,226
Sun has left bidding adieu...

339
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:38,328
He woke up the world
on the other side...

340
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:42,231
Stop fearing the darkness...

341
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:46,238
Let's dream about
tomorrow's morning...

342
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,908
Good night to everyone.

343
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:21,107
Father... shampoo!
- I've brought son.

344
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:25,043
Spread your palm correctly or
else the drop may fall down.

345
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,375
What's this father?
Give me a drop or two more.

346
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,043
If I give one more drop...

347
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,389
What should last a week
will be over in a day.

348
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,557
When I was of your age,

349
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:38,886
I used to take head bath for
a week with one soap nut.

350
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,562
What?
Did you take head bath also?

351
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,560
My son has started
making fun of me.

352
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:43,993
Nobody is there to stop him.

353
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:48,403
Even if a drop falls,
it'll fall into the shell,

354
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:50,003
we can take bath by
washing the shell clean.

355
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,469
Father... Horlicks!

356
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,238
It's not even two months old
and it's already half empty.

357
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:00,081
Horlicks... you're a minus and
moreover heath drink to you.

358
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:01,580
Father, I'll not take it easy
if you call me minus.

359
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:02,910
Why are you getting so angry?

360
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,087
Will anyone call a minus
as plus instead of minus?

361
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,755
Milk is getting cold,
add horlicks first.

362
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,253
Already you are drinking milk,

363
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,254
why do you need
horlicks with it?

364
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,427
Horlicks is added
to milk isn't it?

365
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:13,254
Always in the mood of
eating and drinking,

366
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:15,431
never bothers to read
the lable on the bottle.

367
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:16,620
What is written on it?

368
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:19,833
Horlicks can be added
to plain water also. I mean...

369
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:21,763
no need to add Horlicks
if you drink milk,

370
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:24,098
no need to take milk
if you take Horlicks.

371
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:27,105
You can claim on TV,
Horlicks is the secret of my energy.

372
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,437
Hubby... I need cumin seeds
for seasoning.

373
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:30,441
Can't you make one
request for everything?

374
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:31,943
How many times do I've to
open and close the cupboard?

375
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:33,615
Who told you to lock
and open it?

376
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:36,114
Will anyone lock up
food items like money?

377
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:37,448
Shut up!

378
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:39,280
You are going overboard
the more I keep quiet.

379
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:42,322
Sir, Mastan Bhai is here.
- Mastan Bhai here?

380
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:45,123
What has brought you
here Mastan Bhai?

381
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:46,955
Greeting sir...
I came for a loan.

382
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,060
Loan?
Have you come for a loan?

383
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,792
What's that emergency need?

384
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:52,990
Indeed it's an emergency.

385
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:55,133
People take loans under
pretexts like this...

386
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,464
you don't know about it.

387
00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:57,798
Needs force you
to take loans...

388
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,975
If you fail to repay,
it'll bring disgrace also.

389
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,803
I've told you it's
an emergency need.

390
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,741
Advising you is my duty,
then it's up to you. Come.

391
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:09,883
You'll get Rs.2 lakhs for the
jewels you've pawned.

392
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:10,978
Take it.

393
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:12,483
In the witness of Allah,

394
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:15,156
I've taken a loan of
Rs.2 lakhs from Kotaiah.

395
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:17,993
Thank you.
- God bless you.

396
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:20,321
What's the surprize dad?
- Wait and see.

397
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:31,172
Did he ask for a bike?

398
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:32,341
It's a thrill when you get
it before asking for it.

399
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:35,010
How can he know it's value if you
present him before he asks?

400
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:36,174
Have you started irritating again?

401
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:37,505
Your bike is very good.

402
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:40,511
Suri, your father never
gives you money,

403
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:41,683
how did you get a new bike?

404
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:43,511
Do you know how much
hard work I did to get this?

405
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,846
You?
Where did you work hard man?

406
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:47,181
Where else, at home.

407
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,858
Work hard at home?
- What else then?

408
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,527
Do you know how difficult it is
to steal my father's savings?

409
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:53,524
You'll never come good in life.

410
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,390
Hey Watch out!
It's a new bike!

411
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:57,456
I think he has decided
to kill himself.

412
00:25:58,568 --> 00:26:00,468
Pull over the vehicle...
pull over. Come... come.

413
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:01,862
I saw my dad's face
on waking up.

414
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,368
Do you've RC?
- No sir.

415
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,366
Do you've license?
- No sir.

416
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,709
Do you've Insurance?
- No sir.

417
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,877
What do you've then?

418
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:09,737
I've a hundred rupee note.

419
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:15,617
Go... go now...
- We'll go sir...

420
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:16,785
But I've a question,
will you answer honestly?

421
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:17,452
What is it?

422
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,120
What's your daily income?

423
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:20,289
If you give another Rs.100,
I'll tell you.

424
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,515
Why not sir? I'll give.

425
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:23,617
How much sir?

426
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:25,453
You shouldn't ask a Policeman's
income and wife's age,

427
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,128
and I shouldn't tell you.

428
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,458
I don't want your wife's age,
but I know your income.

429
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,293
You know it, don't you?
Get going.

430
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:34,800
If we get Policeman's job,
we can mint money.

431
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:39,070
Hey! Trouble has erupted!
Come, let's go. - Where?

432
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:40,242
Come, let's go and
cut their limbs.

433
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:41,740
Let's hack them...
you go ahead...

434
00:26:41,944 --> 00:26:43,172
I'll park my scooter and come.

435
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:45,971
Hey! Bring the vegetable knife...
I've to go with them. - Okay...

436
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:49,747
What son?

437
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:51,583
Where you going son
with a stick?

438
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,584
Where else? Shouldn't I go when
they are calling us?

439
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,654
Where do you want to go?
Shut up & walk into the house.

440
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,927
If he goes out of the house,
I'll break your legs

441
00:26:59,128 --> 00:26:59,753
Take him in.

442
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:03,193
My foot! A great savior
has born here!

443
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:10,272
Oh My god! Somebody's house is
on fire in the next street.

444
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,775
Instead of standing there
and watching the fun,

445
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:22,780
can't you all get a bucket of
water and wet the walls?

446
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:23,952
Have you gone mad?

447
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,950
Why are you wetting our walls
when a house is on fire elsewhere?

448
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,122
Think future!

449
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:29,951
What if a speck of fire
falls on our house?

450
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:30,955
He'll never change.

451
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:39,126
Stop!

452
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:40,802
Why are you saving Muslims?

453
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:43,471
I'm saving humans,
not their religion.

454
00:27:43,673 --> 00:27:45,971
No brother, they have killed
ten Hindus in Old city.

455
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:46,971
Do you know that?

456
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:48,643
Just because ten Hindus
were killed there,

457
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:50,368
will you kill ten Muslims here?

458
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,806
Then kill me first!

459
00:27:57,186 --> 00:28:00,155
Oh! Will you kill only Muslims?

460
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,824
Now I'm also a Muslim...

461
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,321
this is my family...

462
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,392
she's my mother...
he's my brother...

463
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:10,991
they are all my children...

464
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,658
Kill me now... kill me!
Why have you stopped?

465
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,666
Brother...
you don't know anything...

466
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:16,997
move aside...
let's burn them alive.

467
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,174
What have they done
to get burnt alive?

468
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,933
Did Mastan Bhai harm
you personally?

469
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:23,375
Did he harm you?
Did he harm you?

470
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,411
Mastan Bhai didn't do anything,
but his religion did.

471
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,346
No, you are doing it.

472
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,849
Smoking cigarettes,
not only spoiling your health,

473
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,350
you are spoiling the health
of people around you also.

474
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:34,022
Why are you linking
cigarette with religion?

475
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:35,019
This is my habit.

476
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:37,415
Even religion is a habit.

477
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:40,191
In our country 200 millions
are smoking cigarettes,

478
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:43,695
they are spoiling their health
and people around them also.

479
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,026
When we tolerate
such a bad habit,

480
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:48,635
why shouldn't we tolerate
a habit known as religion?

481
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:53,363
A human killing another
human is mental illness.

482
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:56,875
For god's sake,
don't rub it on any religion.

483
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:59,874
No religion preaches
to kill another human.

484
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:02,050
If such a religion had been there,

485
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:07,113
Mankind would've become extinct.

486
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,649
Brother... what happened?

487
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:23,602
Indra, pumpkins are crying
here instead of onions.

488
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,735
That's all right!
Have you finished writing?

489
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:29,137
It's almost over mother.

490
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:36,744
Isn't it Boost?
I'll give it.

491
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:42,349
Enough of building muscles,
drink this Boost.

492
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,482
No need. I'll not drink.

493
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:52,260
Volga

494
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:54,493
Looks like you're writing
something seriously,

495
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:55,702
please drink this Boost.

496
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:59,604
For asking her to drink Boost,
she's looking at me like a ghost.

497
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:00,935
No use here.

498
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:03,967
This boy is right.

499
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:07,441
Chinna! You look tired
working out Maths.

500
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,618
Please drink this Boost.
- I'll not drink.

501
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:10,843
Actually I don't want
to talk to you.

502
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:14,119
I've been watching,

503
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:17,850
I'm hurt and people at home are
on a non co-operation movement.

504
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,286
Why will you not drink?
Drink!

505
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:20,962
If you don't drink,
I'll kill you.

506
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:22,721
Drink... drink... fool!

507
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,002
Wipe your mouth...
do your Maths.

508
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:31,799
Chinna, drink this Boost.

509
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,737
I don't want. He made me
drink sugarless coffee.

510
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:37,335
I've to brush again to clean
my mouth of it's bitter taste.

511
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:41,074
That sugarless coffee
was for you.

512
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,647
Mummy, I've finished writing it.

513
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,821
Read it carefully and sign,
if you agree to it.

514
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:49,991
If I don't agree?

515
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,159
We'll fend for ourselves.

516
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,089
Has it reached that stage?

517
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,690
To you... I mean to Mr. Raghuram,

518
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,993
We, I mean family members,

519
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:01,833
an agrament...
between us...

520
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,666
Agrament?
What's that?

521
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,172
Don't you know the spelling of
"agreement" also? Give me the pen.

522
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:13,841
A-G-R-E-E-M-E-N-T!

523
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:15,346
No use in correcting
that spelling,

524
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:17,109
first correct your fate.

525
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:18,580
He's an editor, isn't he?

526
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:20,014
He'll only correct the proofs,

527
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:21,189
but never cares to
know what is in it.

528
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,017
Is it for me?
- No.

529
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,192
Give it to me, I'll read.

530
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:28,458
To you... it means to Mr. Raghuram,

531
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,531
We, means family members,

532
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,132
an agreement between us,

533
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:34,592
I, known as Raghuram,

534
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,867
hereafter interfere in
matters concerning house,

535
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:38,869
and office only,

536
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:42,874
I'll not interfere in other
matters and other's matters,

537
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:44,875
I promise not to get
involved in street fights,

538
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,548
and hurt myself seriously,

539
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,378
and I swear it in the witness
of all my family members.

540
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:53,555
By, Raghuram.
Sign it!

541
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:56,054
Sign it!
- Why should I sign?

542
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:58,393
Won't you sign as the witness?
- You sign it first.

543
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:03,928
Never again behave
foolishly like this.

544
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:05,828
You've done a great job!

545
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:09,564
You didn't just save Mastan's home,
you saved mine too.

546
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:10,568
How come?

547
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:11,899
It seems you doused your house
with water before hand.

548
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:13,574
Keep quiet man.
You are a trouble.

549
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:15,243
If Mastan had died in yesterday's
communal clashes,

550
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,570
I would've lost Rs.2 lakhs.

551
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:18,576
Because I've lent him Rs.2 lakhs.

552
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,442
I thank you once again
for saving his life.

553
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,079
Do one thing in future,

554
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:24,252
you insure anyone who
takes loan from you.

555
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:25,579
Even if he dies you'll
get back your loan.

556
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:27,756
I'm not that intelligent,

557
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:29,788
if he repays the loan
while he's still alive,

558
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,760
won't I lose money
paying his premiums?

559
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:34,421
It seems you bled heavily,

560
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,427
infact I thought of
donating my blood,

561
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:39,100
mine is B negative,
it doesn't match yours.

562
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:41,599
What? Is your blood group
B negative? - Yes.

563
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:44,599
Someone in General Hospital
needs it very urgently,

564
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:47,002
come, let's go.
- I disclosed it at wrong time.

565
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,108
You've brought to light starvation
deaths of farmers in remote area.

566
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,420
Volga

567
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,627
Sir, Chairman is calling you.

568
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:06,624
Go on, I'll join you.

569
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,963
A fashion parade is scheduled
tomorrow in Grand Canyon,

570
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,302
these International models,

571
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:20,202
must appear on
tomorrow's front page.

572
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:23,000
These photos in our
papers' front page?

573
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:28,472
This fashion show is not great news
than farmers' starvation deaths.

574
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:30,549
I can't publish it.

575
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:34,319
Starvation deaths are routine,
publish these photos,

576
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,487
lt'll add beauty and
we'll get money too.

577
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,990
Hunger is stark pain,
it'll never be beautiful.

578
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:41,659
Encouraging these for
beauty and money is...

579
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:44,025
Tell me one thing,

580
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,494
are you running this paper
for moral values or money?

581
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:50,900
Just holding on to moral values
we can't run paper.

582
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,000
If you can't then shut it down.

583
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,836
Yes, no need of a paper that
can't keep up moral values.

584
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:57,171
It's a waste! Close it.

585
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:05,512
Money may survive in a immoral place,
but I can't survive.

586
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,356
I'm resigning!

587
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:16,124
Volga

588
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:17,365
What?

589
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:22,931
You've come to bed very early.

590
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:26,033
You visit your younger wife first.
- Younger wife?

591
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:30,541
Oh Younger wife!
I've divorced her.

592
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:32,611
Divorced? Why?

593
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,479
I've resigned from my job.

594
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:39,721
God! Why did you resign suddenly?

595
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:42,049
Don't worry, I've applied
for another job,

596
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:43,224
I'll get it in one month.

597
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:45,393
Will you be free
all this month then?

598
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:46,720
Why would I be free?

599
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,897
I'll do a better job
from tomorrow.

600
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:50,895
What job will you
get in a day?

601
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:01,398
Appadalu... mouth watering!
- No need.

602
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,575
Madam, please buy Appadalu.

603
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,906
Appadalu, madam.
- What is it?

604
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:07,582
Beautiful Appadalu.
- No need.

605
00:35:07,783 --> 00:35:08,408
Madam, please buy Appadalu.

606
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:17,752
Appadalu madam. Beautiful Appadalu.
- No need. - Appadalu...

607
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,758
Oldman! You mustn't sell here.
This is my area.

608
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:21,759
Your area?

609
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:24,262
Yes, from that bus stop
to this place,

610
00:35:24,466 --> 00:35:26,866
only I'll sell,
you shouldn't sell here.

611
00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:29,434
Why shouldn't I?
I'll sell here only.

612
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:31,868
You sell yours and I'll sell mine.

613
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,108
Oldman! You are not
listening to my words.

614
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:45,552
I'll complain to Karim Bhai.

615
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:51,559
If you tell Karim Bhai,
I'll tell... mind it!

616
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:54,625
You look like a gentleman,

617
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,355
will you spoil my livelihood
by selling your wares here?

618
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,635
Go and sell on the other road,

619
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:02,133
I'll not trespass
into your area,

620
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,567
you don't trespass
into my area. Okay?

621
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:10,373
Okay... okay... this is right.
I'll sell there only.

622
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,140
What a man I met early morning!

623
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:15,248
Appadalu madam.

624
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:18,986
Will you please give me your
expensive few minutes?

625
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:19,984
Tell me.

626
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:23,320
Green gram, black gram
and rice flour,

627
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:25,652
have you ever eaten a dish
with all these together?

628
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,658
What are you talking about man?

629
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:30,991
I've a tasty product
with these ingredients.

630
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,928
What is it?

631
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:33,728
Appadalu!

00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:37,331
Yes, a pack is just Rs. 10 only.
Please try it once.

633
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,938
You appear like a gentleman.

634
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:40,841
Will you narrate such a
long tale for selling this?

635
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:43,511
Do you think I've no other work?
Go away from here.

636
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,080
Madam... Appadalu please...
- No need please.

637
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:51,682
Green gram, black gram
and rice flour,

638
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:52,683
if you mix all the three...

639
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:57,416
What will be the result?
Go away... l'm very busy.

640
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:03,023
You've grown old but still don't
know how to sell Appadalu?

641
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:04,529
Who taught you man?

642
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,031
Why are you bothered
about ingredients?

643
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,636
No one will buy your words.

644
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:11,873
Watch me and learn to sell.

645
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,206
Madam... Appadalu... tasty food...

646
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:22,212
Taste it once and
pay only if you like it.

647
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:25,781
One pack is just Rs.10 only,
you can pay tomorrow also.

648
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:29,219
No need to come back again
for Rs.10, take it.

649
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:32,257
Take two packs,
pay a rupee less.

650
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:35,787
Great boy! Okay, take it.

651
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:40,731
I don't have one rupee change,
I'll pay tomorrow.

652
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:41,732
Promise madam.

653
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:45,134
I've understood your cleverness,
but keep the rupee also.

654
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:51,742
Understood now, how to sell it?

655
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:55,815
I got it boy! Come sir.
Sit here sir.

656
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:58,412
What are your parents doing?

657
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,420
If I had parents, why would
I be selling on streets?

658
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:03,921
I don't have anyone.

659
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:06,950
Are you an orphan?

660
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:34,284

661
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:30,674

with just one piece.

668
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:50,856
Cost of a pack?

00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:52,033
Rs. 10 madam.

670
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:54,702
My husband too is
a salesman like you.

671
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,697
Now tell me,
what will it cost to me?

672
00:39:57,906 --> 00:40:00,534
Let it be anyone,
no discount!

673
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:01,538
One pack is Rs. 10!

674
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:04,378
Boss! Who are they?

675
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:05,705
Why are you talking to them?

676
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:07,215
Did you sell everything?

677
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,384
Sold out but just two packs
are remaining...

678
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:11,381
if they settle for the price,
I'll sell it.

679
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:13,383
Boss, their faces show
they'll not buy,

680
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,055
take the two packs
to your home.

681
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:18,715

Take Rs. 20! Come.

683
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,560
Why are you gaping, boss?

684
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:30,067
This is a sales technic.
- You're genius!

685
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,570
Greetings Mr. Raghuram.
- Greetings madam.

686
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:35,242
Please come.

687
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:37,908
It seems you had called my office.
- Yes.

688
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:39,739
He's the boy about
whom I told you.

689
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:41,575
Look after him carefully.
- Okay.

690
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:43,751
I'll make a regular visit.
- Okay.

691
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,757
They will take you with them,

692
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,255
they will feed you
three times a day,

693
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,928
they will give good clothes
and educate you.

694
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,096
Will they educate me?
- Yes.

695
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,257
Promise? Truly?

696
00:40:57,466 --> 00:41:00,264
They will teach and
play with you.

697
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:01,766
What about my business?

698
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,269
You've taught me the
business, haven't you?

699
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:08,272
I'll take care of the business,
you go with them.

700
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:10,604
I'll go but tell me,
who are you?

701
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:12,780
I'm your friend, Raghuram.

702
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,775
Study well.
- Come son.

703
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:16,776
Go.

704
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:21,948
Bye. I'll take leave,
you'll visit me often, won't you?

705
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:24,125
Definitely! Take him carefully.
- Bye sir.

706
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,954
Bye sir.

707
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:35,935
Volga

708
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,298
Will you misbehave with a
girl in the fashion show?

709
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:39,974
Irresponsible son!

710
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:41,972
No dad...
- Shut up!

711
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:42,802
Stop it sir.

712
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,479
Teach morals to your son later,
first bring a change in you.

713
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:50,642
What is this?

714
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:55,147
You can print such dirty pictures
on the front page,

715
00:41:55,357 --> 00:41:57,154
but expect your son
to be good boy?

716
00:41:57,592 --> 00:41:59,492
First introspect yourself.

717
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:03,327
If you print such dirty,
shameless photos,

718
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:06,000
not only your son,
any father's son will get spoiled.

719
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,328
First protect the values
of your news paper,

720
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:09,504
and then teach morals
to others.

721
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:15,937
Volga

722
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,509
Money may survive
in immoral places,

723
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:21,841
I can't survive.
I'm resigning.

724
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,351
Appadalu is very tasty.
- Really? Then enjoy your food happily.

725
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:34,855
I don't find any other dishes
other than this.

726
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:40,194
It seems you can finish dinner
with one piece. Eat!

727
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:43,371
Who said that?
- A salesman.

728
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:47,041
Why didn't you prepare vegetables
on a salesman's advice?

729
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:49,877
Why are you calling
a salesman informally?

730
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:51,875
If he calls someone informally,
why are you beating him, mother?

731
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,878
You too are calling him informally,
it's wrong, don't do it.

732
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:58,883
What am I to call that fool
for giving such lousy idea?

733
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:01,555
Ask him, he'll tell you.

734
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:03,553
Why should we ask father
about that fool?

735
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:06,056
That salesman is none
other than our father.

736
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:08,558
Did you sell it in market?

737
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,424
How insulting it would be
if anyone had seen it?

738
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,229
What's there to feel insult in it?
- Shut up!

739
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:16,904
When you said you'll
find a job in a day,

740
00:43:17,105 --> 00:43:21,064
I didn't expect you to do such
a thing to bring disrepute.

741
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:23,906
How can you call it as disrepute?

742
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:27,912
Till yesterday, I took care
of you all as an Editor,

743
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:31,415
from today I'll take care
of you as a salesman.

744
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,247
Whether I'm an editor
or a salesman,

745
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,082
there will be no change
in looking after you.

746
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,258
But why are you bothered
about the change in my job?

747
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:40,257
It's wrong to take loan or
earn through bad ways,

748
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,760
you must see
the dignity of labour.

749
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:44,430
Got it?

750
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:45,925
Got it.

751
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:47,260
Got it very well.

752
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:50,267
You'll convince us
with your arguments,

753
00:43:50,472 --> 00:43:52,269
you'll never change your attitude.

754
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:55,102
Attitude is like wife,

755
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,937
changing it often is bad.

756
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,781
You? Please come in sir.

757
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:05,786
I was wrong.

758
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:07,280
Please sit children.

759
00:44:09,658 --> 00:44:11,125
Hereafter your word is mine.

760
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:12,793
I'll never interfere again
in your profession.

761
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,963
So, you must continue
as the editor.

762
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:19,463
Nothing doing, you're coming
to office from tomorrow.

763
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:20,792
He'll not come tomorrow,

764
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:21,965
tomorrow is my birthday.

765
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:27,300
You must attend office
from day after tomorrow.

766
00:44:29,177 --> 00:44:30,974
Crisps are fine,
where did you buy it?

767
00:44:35,784 --> 00:44:49,755
Volga

768
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:53,660
Lord! I've donated 25 paise
according to my capacity,

769
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:55,165
take it as Rs.100 and 1000,

770
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,838
bless me it turns
into billions, Lord.

771
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:00,837
Priest, make a good heavy offering,

772
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:02,168
I didn't have breakfast.

773
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:03,507
Offering is nothing,

774
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:06,180
for your generosity,
I'll send food to your entire family.

775
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:08,178
Even a beggar will return it.

776
00:45:08,383 --> 00:45:09,008
You carry on priest.

777
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:10,180
You may go.

778
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:13,012
Priest, today it's my
daughter's birthday,

779
00:45:13,221 --> 00:45:15,519
offer special prayers for her.
- Okay.

780
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:16,686
What's her name?

781
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,026
Race?
- Paidipala.

782
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,535
What's our next program?

783
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:29,704
There's an Italian food festival
going on in Shilparamam.

784
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,372
Let's eat there.
- Okay, let's go.

785
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:34,701
No need.
Let's go home.

786
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,706
I'll cook whatever you ask.

787
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:38,208
I know what will you prepare.

788
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:39,710
Pudding, Vada and
Tamarind rice, that's all!

789
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:41,882
Yes dad, mother always
prepares the same things.

790
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,210
Recently for Telugu new year,
same three items!

791
00:45:44,419 --> 00:45:46,216
For Lord Ganesha's birthday,
same three items!

792
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:49,049
When we have some guests,
again same three items!

793
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:50,884
For Indra's birthday,
you'll prepare same three items!

794
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:54,892
Pudding, Vada and
Tamarind rice!

795
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:55,721
Bloody fool!

796
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,898
I prepared flour laddus
for your birthday.

797
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,896
I prepared sweet souffle
for his birthday.

798
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:01,068
Have you forgotten
it so easily?

799
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:02,065
My mother!
I haven't forgotten anything.

800
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,738
Father, they were not flour
laddus but stone laddus.

801
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:06,236
Do you know what my
friends did with it?

802
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:07,738
What did they do?
- They played cricket.

803
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:08,738
Didn't it break?
- It did break.

804
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:09,739
What?
- Bat...

805
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:12,405
Making fun of my culinary skills!

806
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:15,078
Stop I say...

807
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:17,251
Stop... stop...
- You please move aside.

808
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,249
No war please!

809
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,251
Let's do one thing,
today it's her birthday,

810
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:24,084
so, let's do as she says.

811
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:26,586
...l'm getting her
medically treated...

812
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:30,229
I think she'll live little
long with your mercy.

813
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:36,833
Now people like you are collecting
money with fake diseases.

814
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:39,198
Oh! I'm not a cheat like them.

815
00:46:39,374 --> 00:46:41,842
I swear on god! My daughter
is really a cancer patient.

816
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:44,170
If you've any doubt check
the doctor's certificates.

817
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:47,507
Certificates? People are printing
counterfeit notes by morning.

818
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,013
Is it so difficult to produce
these certificates?

819
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:51,883
She had to have a
chemotherapy in two days,

820
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,520
please donate whatever
you feel like.

821
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:55,690
I've not heard anything, how can you
ask me whatever I feel like giving?

822
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:57,854
Go away... anyway she's
going to die...

823
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:00,186
Take it madam.
- Listen to me, don't give.

824
00:47:00,562 --> 00:47:04,020
Don't believe her words.
- You take it madam.

825
00:47:04,232 --> 00:47:04,857
Take it madam.

826
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,197
Even god can't help you.

827
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:21,615
Volga

828
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:22,513
What's this?

829
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:24,848
We were planning to
spend the day happily.

830
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:27,647
Do you've to donate all the
money on her birthday too?

831
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:33,487
If you deny children of their little
wishes also, will they love you?

832
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:36,156
If you spoil their fun,

833
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:38,161
do you know how
much they are hurt?

834
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:39,333
What's this your eccentricity?

835
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:41,502
Infact it was disgusting
to see them.

836
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,501
We would've spent the day happily
with money given to the girl.

837
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:47,004
Will our Rs.1000
alter their lives?

838
00:47:47,308 --> 00:48:03,282
Volga

839
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:04,525
What did you say?

840
00:48:04,893 --> 00:48:07,020
Will Rs.1000 alter lives?

841
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:11,361
Sometimes even 10 paise
will save a life.

842
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,700
This 10 paise postcard
saved my mother's life,

843
00:48:16,905 --> 00:48:18,702
and taught me about life.

844
00:48:19,741 --> 00:48:21,709
Like your mother loves you,

845
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,878
my mother too loved
me very much.

846
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:26,706
When I lost my father as a boy,

847
00:48:26,915 --> 00:48:31,375
my mother struggled very
hard to educate me.

848
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,217
When I was in college,

849
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:36,390
my mother's health deteriorated,

850
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:38,058
both her kidneys failed.

851
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:41,057
Doctors suggested surgery.
I didn't have money.

852
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,723
I must save mother.
But how?

853
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:50,067
This letter came from a remote
village near Madurai in Tamil Nadu.

854
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,398
Informing about a charitable
institution in Bangalore,

855
00:48:52,607 --> 00:48:53,733
which conducts
free operations.

856
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:55,739
I took my mother there
without any further delay.

857
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:58,003
They did a free operation,
my mother survived.

858
00:48:58,246 --> 00:49:01,079
I'm surprized that this
letter has saved my life.

859
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:04,410
The person who wrote this is
neither a friend nor a relative,

860
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,246
infact not from our state also.

861
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:08,752
We don't know their face also.

862
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:10,754
May be this is known as Humanity!

863
00:49:13,294 --> 00:49:19,460
Son, you must meet the god
who wrote this in Madurai.

864
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:23,096
For just a letter they had
performed a free operation,

865
00:49:23,304 --> 00:49:26,603
I thought the person would
be rich and powerful.

866
00:49:26,808 --> 00:49:28,435
But my thoughts were wrong,

867
00:49:28,643 --> 00:49:32,773
I understood when I saw the
simple and peaceful home,

868
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:37,280
Sir, I've come to meet
Mr. Swaminathan here...

869
00:49:41,823 --> 00:49:43,120
Mr. Swaminathan...

870
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,959
You can meet him later,
first give me that towel.

871
00:49:46,127 --> 00:50:01,441
Volga

872
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,142
I've come from Hyderabad,

873
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:04,470
I want to meet Mr. Swaminathan.

874
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:05,646
Do you know English?

875
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:09,146
Read these news papers,

876
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,648
you'll know who is
in which problem.

877
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:15,322
Check with this reference book,

878
00:50:15,523 --> 00:50:17,991
it has details about which
institution will help them.

879
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,486
After that write letters to them.

880
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:22,489
To whom?
- Fool!

881
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:26,656
Find which social organisation will
help the affected in which way.

882
00:50:26,868 --> 00:50:27,334
Got it?

883
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:32,840
That means...
you are Mr. Swaminathan.

884
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,504
I'll go out and come back.

885
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:38,679
Meanwhile you write letters and
post them in the opposite box.

886
00:50:39,047 --> 00:50:40,344
Where are you going sir?

887
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:43,517
I'm a clerk in Railways.
Bye.

888
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,013
I went to thank him.

889
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:50,349
But I understood
how he accepts it,

890
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:53,186
by making me
write few letters.

891
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:56,363
A caption there attracted
me very much.

892
00:50:56,564 --> 00:50:57,861
I believe in mankind.

893
00:50:58,066 --> 00:50:59,863
I love them,
I respect them.

894
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:03,533
Because of little selfishness
that I'm also a human.

895
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:07,537
After reading it,
a little desire sprouted in me,

896
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:11,200
I was in ecstasy that the
world belonged to me.

897
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:15,375
Ever since then I love my family
and the world alike,

898
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,550
I'll do so in future also.

899
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:19,546
I spend half of
my earnings to home,

900
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:21,381
and other half to the society.

901
00:51:21,756 --> 00:51:25,556
If Swaminathan hadn't bothered
about society that day,

902
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,890
I wouldn't be now your
father and an editor.

903
00:51:30,098 --> 00:51:33,556
I wanted you to
understand society,

904
00:51:33,768 --> 00:51:37,898
that's why I made you to donate money,
not to spoil your happiness.

905
00:51:42,577 --> 00:52:23,616
Volga

906
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:26,616
Daddy, come and see
what mother is up to. Come daddy.

907
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:31,117
What's it dear?
- Did you see mother?

908
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:32,792
She has grown 10 years younger!

909
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:35,454
Really!

910
00:52:35,663 --> 00:52:37,961
There's treacherous plan
behind this, dad.

911
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:42,796
Traitor! How dare to
cheat your husband?

912
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:46,633
Dad, we must avenge this cheating.
- Avenge?

913
00:52:46,874 --> 00:52:47,806
Come Daddy, I'll tell you.

914
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:51,469
I'll bring a 20 year difference
between you and mother. Sit.

915
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:53,980
Sit here.
- Oh No dear!

916
00:52:54,182 --> 00:52:55,479
If you don't dye your hair,

917
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:57,310
we'll be like your elder
and younger daughters.

918
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:58,985
You think like that?
- Yes.

919
00:52:59,187 --> 00:53:01,314
Okay... do it... do it...

920
00:53:01,522 --> 00:53:03,149
What's there do dye?
Come on do it.

921
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:05,985
Father, sign here.

922
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:09,662
I'm applying to join as SI.

923
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:12,992
Do you want to join
Police department?

924
00:53:17,038 --> 00:53:18,335
Thanks father.

925
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:24,672
Chinna! - Yes father.

926
00:53:24,879 --> 00:53:25,846
How did you write
your EAMCET exams?

927
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,014
I did very well daddy.

928
00:53:27,215 --> 00:53:29,012
Will you get the rank
in thousands or lakhs?

929
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:30,343
I'll get within 100 ranks daddy.

930
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:31,347
Happy to hear it.

931
00:53:37,658 --> 00:53:38,352
Yeah! Tell me.

932
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,685
That's...

933
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:41,361
I'll coming right now.

934
00:53:44,465 --> 00:53:46,695
Daddy, I've special class,
I'm going to attend it.

935
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:49,362
All right...
go and attend dear...

936
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:55,867
Why are you so late?
Did you see the time now?

937
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:58,545
It's like fighting death to cheat
my dad and come out, you know?

938
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:00,881
Is your father a demon?

939
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:02,709
No, he's very good man.

940
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:03,713
Why do you fear him then?

941
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:06,545
Nothing... if he comes
to now about us,

942
00:54:06,754 --> 00:54:08,551
I'm worried about his reaction.

943
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:10,049
Why your hand is coloured?

944
00:54:10,258 --> 00:54:12,226
I was applying
hair dye to my father.

945
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:18,224
You did apply dye perfectly.

946
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:21,731
Look son,

947
00:54:21,936 --> 00:54:26,737
I don't want my daughter
to lie to meet you.

948
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:27,737
Sir that's...

949
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:32,402
Nothing, I don't have much
hair to dye it everyday.

950
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:35,082
Tell me about your parents,

951
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:37,751
I'll talk to them and
arrange your marriage.

952
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:41,251
Dad, we are still in the
process of knowing each other,

953
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:43,423
we haven't thought
about marriage yet.

954
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:48,917
Still getting to know each other?

955
00:54:49,297 --> 00:54:51,765
Father, not like that...
- Don't utter one more word,

956
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,768
you both just follow me.

957
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:00,604
Come... come...

958
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:03,101
Come and sit here.

959
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,448
Why are you feeling
like a stranger?

960
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:09,611
Sit down.

961
00:55:10,685 --> 00:55:13,779
Open place...
it's pleasant here...

962
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:15,785
No disturbance.

963
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,118
You can be free and get to
know each other very well.

964
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:22,125
After college,
come straight to home.

965
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,127
Don't go to any park.

966
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:26,459
I don't like people seeing
my daughter in park,

967
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:29,135
and pass dirty comments
about her.

968
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,628
Look son...

969
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:34,300
No need to decide right now,

970
00:55:34,675 --> 00:55:37,803
it's enough if you tell me after you
get to know each other very well.

971
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:42,812
Leave my hair!

972
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:44,484
What are you doing now?

973
00:55:44,852 --> 00:55:46,149
You saw it, didn't you get it?

974
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:48,321
Forget about knowing it,
I may go mad for it.

975
00:55:48,522 --> 00:55:50,149
On finding her with
a boy friend in park,

976
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:52,326
instead of breaking her limbs
and bringing her home,

977
00:55:52,526 --> 00:55:54,824
will you ask her to love in home
instead of going to parks?

978
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:56,155
They are not in love,

979
00:55:56,364 --> 00:55:58,332
they are just in the process of
getting to know each other.

980
00:55:58,532 --> 00:55:59,499
Oh! My god!

981
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,501
When they have decided
to meet secretly in park,

982
00:56:02,703 --> 00:56:04,830
what's there still to know
about each other? My foot!

983
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:05,663
You come with me.

984
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,508
Why do you get
tensed up unnecessarily?

985
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:09,505
Do you remember?

986
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,508
Your parents got you married to me
without knowing about me,

987
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,682
you were angry on your parents,
as the new bride!

988
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,013
I haven't understood you yet!
That's my grouse!

989
00:56:19,287 --> 00:56:21,380
Grouse! I don't want my daughter
to have the same grouse.

990
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:22,351
So, I did like this.

991
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:24,524
Oh God!

992
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:31,198
Is it necessary to run
to catch thieves?

993
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:33,196
How can you catch them
if you don't run?

994
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:34,368
To catch thieves?

995
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:35,865
Infact I belong to
a gang of thieves.

996
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,538
If I run to catch myself,
people may think I'm mad.

997
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:40,536
I can't run anymore,
you carry on.

998
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:41,366
Come...

999
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,707
You'll never prosper.

1000
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,217
What's it son?

1001
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:51,043
Leg?

1002
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:54,546
Here?

1003
00:57:02,096 --> 00:57:03,893
Get up... get up.

1004
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:05,565
Wear the shoe.

1005
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:08,398
His father is really great.

1006
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:10,229
Walk son,
nothing will happen to you.

1007
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:12,233
Go... go...

1008
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:22,543
Volga

1009
00:57:22,683 --> 00:57:24,241
Sign as the witness
on behalf of the bride.

1010
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,418
Why didn't you apply
dye this time dear?

1011
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:35,254
Last times' dye hasn't
faded out yet.

1012
00:57:38,132 --> 00:57:40,259
I think he's not the guy
I met in the park...

1013
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,598
I didn't get to know him
very well, father.

1014
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,428
Look Indra, now you're married,

1015
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,608
after starting the family,

1016
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,437
don't say you didn't get
to know him well.

1017
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:54,440
Try to know him sincerely.

1018
00:57:59,053 --> 00:57:59,951
What do you do?

1019
00:58:00,154 --> 00:58:01,451
That's...
- Software professional, father.

1020
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:02,952
Where are you working?

1021
00:58:03,157 --> 00:58:04,954
Not working presently,
have to find a job.

1022
00:58:05,993 --> 00:58:08,461
Did his parents agree
to this marriage?

1023
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:10,959
I mean... ours is very
orthodox family...

1024
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:12,460
they will not accept so easily.

1025
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:15,293
Infact they will not allow
into house after marriage.

1026
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:22,036
Volga

1027
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:23,139
Come in.

1028
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,806
Wait here only.

1029
00:58:28,015 --> 00:58:29,642
Your mother will come
to ward off evil.

1030
00:58:35,022 --> 00:58:37,820
Why are you watching TV?
Go and talk to them.

1031
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:45,999
What has happened now?
Why are you so sad?

1032
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,167
What else should happen?

1033
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:49,836
When your daughter
is marrying a stranger,

1034
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:51,334
instead of stopping it,

1035
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:53,837
will you sign as witness
and bring them home?

1036
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,334
Did Subrahmanyam tell you?

1037
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:58,011
Let it be anyone,
I know what you did.

1038
00:59:00,448 --> 00:59:01,506
Don't cry...

1039
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:03,680
Easy? What easy?

1040
00:59:03,884 --> 00:59:06,352
I can't take anything easy
in life like you.

1041
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:09,017
Recently when you found
her with a boy friend,

1042
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:11,521
you brought her home
and told her to love here.

1043
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:13,852
Now ditching that boy,
she's marrying someone else,

1044
00:59:14,061 --> 00:59:15,187
instead of beating her,

1045
00:59:15,396 --> 00:59:16,863
will you conduct her
marriage yourself?

1046
00:59:17,731 --> 00:59:21,189
Bharathi, just think about
our first night.

1047
00:59:21,402 --> 00:59:23,870
I'm furious enough
to kill you,

1048
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:25,868
and you're talking
something else.

1049
00:59:26,073 --> 00:59:28,701
Do you want to feel happy
thinking about honeymoon days?

1050
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:32,709
Please don't cry.
Come and sit here.

1051
00:59:32,913 --> 00:59:34,380
Sit... sit here.

1052
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:38,385
What did you say on our first night?
- What did I say?

1053
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:40,545
I saw a leopard as
a prospective bride,

1054
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:42,551
may be I've to see
a cannon now?

1055
00:59:44,425 --> 00:59:47,223
Why are you bringing milk
hiding under your sari?

1056
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:50,559
It's not milk, it's the dowry
I promised you.

1057
00:59:51,432 --> 00:59:52,899
Yes.

1058
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:54,900
Take it.

1059
00:59:55,102 --> 00:59:56,899
Can't I avoid it?
- Take it please.

1060
00:59:57,938 --> 00:59:59,735
Oh It's very heavy!

1061
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:02,739
This is my savings
since I'm 10,

1062
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,410
won't it be heavy?

1063
01:00:04,612 --> 01:00:06,079
How much will it be?

1064
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,577
How do I know?

1065
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:09,078
Break it open and count.

1066
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:11,410
Oh! No!

1067
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:14,247
If I break & start counting now,
it'll become dawn.

1068
01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:15,251
Let's count tomorrow morning.

1069
01:00:15,623 --> 01:00:16,920
You asked how much
is the dowry, didn't you?

1070
01:00:17,124 --> 01:00:19,422
Break it open now.
- No, let's open it tomorrow.

1071
01:00:19,627 --> 01:00:20,423
No, right now...

1072
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:25,426
Really plenty of money!

1073
01:00:25,633 --> 01:00:27,760
Lt'll take long time
to count them,

1074
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:28,764
please come and sleep.

1075
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:31,597
Oh Sleeping? Leaving open
Goddess of wealth!

1076
01:00:31,805 --> 01:00:32,772
It's a sin.

1077
01:00:32,973 --> 01:00:35,441
Then start the count.

1078
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:44,275
Do you like me?

1079
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:46,282
I liked you,
that's why I married you.

1080
01:00:46,987 --> 01:00:49,114
Didn't you like any of those
100 prospective grooms?

1081
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:51,120
If I had liked anyone,
why would I marry you?

1082
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:53,786
If you hadn't liked me?

1083
01:00:54,828 --> 01:00:56,796
100 more prospective grooms
would've come to see me.

1084
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:02,794
You married me
selecting from a 100.

1085
01:01:03,003 --> 01:01:06,962
But Indra,
befriending two or three,

1086
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:09,802
she has married the man
she liked out of them.

1087
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:12,471
Even if we arrange her marriage,

1088
01:01:12,913 --> 01:01:14,642
we've to bring few proposals,

1089
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:16,482
arrange the meeting
of bride and groom,

1090
01:01:16,684 --> 01:01:19,152
and marry her to
the man she selects.

1091
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,147
That's what she has done.

1092
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:26,319
Our daughter has the capacity
to choose what she wants,

1093
01:01:26,527 --> 01:01:29,496
we must congratulate her,
not insult her.

1094
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:31,995
Come... come and bless them.

1095
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,182
Please come in.

1096
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:54,854
Come in.

1097
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:59,025
Why are you still dull?

1098
01:02:00,728 --> 01:02:03,356
You were dull that day for not
celebrating your birthday.

1099
01:02:03,897 --> 01:02:06,695
It doesn't matter if nobody
knows your birthday,

1100
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:08,193
but you're married today,

1101
01:02:08,402 --> 01:02:10,700
marriage is a thing
people should know.

1102
01:02:10,904 --> 01:02:11,700
You must be very happy.

1103
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:53,075
Kicking on my chest...

1104
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,578
Horse riding on my back...

1105
01:02:55,816 --> 01:02:59,912
A little girl who played...

1106
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,580
Look! How strangely
she has grown up...

1107
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:09,092
and our daughter has
become a bride now...

1108
01:03:18,305 --> 01:03:21,433
This is a time of happiness...

1109
01:03:22,643 --> 01:03:26,272
This is a garland
of felicitations...

1110
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:08,818
We think we are doing all this...

1111
01:04:09,022 --> 01:04:10,319
It's all humbug...

1112
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:16,493
If god marries them in heaven
and sends as couples...

1113
01:04:16,697 --> 01:04:21,157
why should we celebrate
once again grandly?

1114
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:25,665
When people like you
are changing fates...

1115
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:30,499
To tell the world,
marriage is not a joke...

1116
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:35,011
Tying those three knots and
take seven steps together...

1117
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:39,007
That isn't the marriage...

1118
01:04:39,553 --> 01:04:41,851
Hearts must unite...

1119
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:44,182
Be a companion for all the life...

1120
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:48,020
Only then it is happy marriage...

1121
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:34,590
My husband used to call me
as 'Gold' when I was a new bride...

1122
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,266
Now he calls me a Granary.

1123
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:38,928
If you eat anything everyday...

1124
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:40,763
won't you get averse to it?

1125
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,269
Once you lose
interest in family...

1126
01:05:43,474 --> 01:05:45,442
won't it become a bore to you?

1127
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:49,943
There are just 7 basic notes
for millions of tunes...

1128
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:54,607
One must develop interest
to sing new tunes...

1129
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:56,953
Like researching music...

1130
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,281
research fun in life...

1131
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:03,790
And lead a happy family life...

1132
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:06,121
There will be days of
good and bad...

1133
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,298
Ever chase of sorrows
and happiness...

1134
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:12,458
All together is the
life of happiness...

1135
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,806
Beautiful... full of sweet...

1136
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:25,982
Life is a boon...

1137
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:30,643
It must go on like
a song and a game...

1138
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:32,823
Pleasing... enchanting...

1139
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:34,991
A life of togetherness...

1140
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,318
Let this moment become eternal...

1141
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:01,847
Marriage is over.

1142
01:07:02,787 --> 01:07:06,382
Don't think about future
and get worried.

1143
01:07:06,557 --> 01:07:09,025
Go on a honeymoon
for a week.

1144
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:11,019
Take it.

1145
01:07:11,729 --> 01:07:12,661
Take it, son-in-law.

1146
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:17,189
Don't leave anything,
throw everything out.

1147
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:20,704
Dents will reduce it's value,
keep it safely.

1148
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:23,199
Sir, please stop!

1149
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:24,700
We beg you sir.

1150
01:07:24,909 --> 01:07:26,035
I'll settle your loan sir.

1151
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,870
Give me a month's time sir.

1152
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,212
People may think,
you're honest.

1153
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:31,040
What you couldn't
settle in 3 years,

1154
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,216
can you settle it in a month?
How can you do it?

1155
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:34,213
This will not work out,
clear out!

1156
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:35,214
You go away madam,

1157
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:36,716
ladies' sentiment will
not work on me...

1158
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:38,047
Please sir, don't throw us
out on to the streets.

1159
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:41,384
Did I throw you on streets?

1160
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:46,052
After taking loan,
you're living happily at home.

1161
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:47,560
As the lender,
I'm on the streets,

1162
01:07:47,765 --> 01:07:52,065
begging you to repay
my loan immediately.

1163
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,395
Who has thrown whom
to the streets?

1164
01:07:53,604 --> 01:07:54,730
Please do justice to me.

1165
01:07:54,939 --> 01:07:56,907
Kotaiah, why are you pushing
him to the streets?

1166
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,074
He's living here for
the past 10 years,

1167
01:07:58,275 --> 01:07:59,242
he'll definitely repay you.

1168
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:02,412
Even the loan is 10 year old...
how can he repay?

1169
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,580
If you've so much mercy on him,
you settle his loan.

1170
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:06,079
If a situation comes,
I'll definitely do.

1171
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:07,743
What more I need now!

1172
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:09,419
Hey, bring those documents.

1173
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,416
Throw all the things
into the house.

1174
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:12,918
What's this man?
- Please sign as the guarantor.

1175
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,928
You must trust human.

1176
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:26,101
Trust & love is the lifeline,
not money.

1177
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:28,431
If what you say is true,

1178
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:30,937
you mustn't ever
take a loan from me.

1179
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:32,608
If you do take a loan,

1180
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,607
then you should accept
money's power.

1181
01:08:34,812 --> 01:08:35,938
Why are you talking like that?

1182
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,773
At times of need,
one must take loans.

1183
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,450
Just now you said,
love rules our life.

1184
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:41,276
Ask loan from it?

1185
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,783
Okay, I trust love
more than money.

1186
01:08:43,988 --> 01:08:45,114
I'll never come to
you for a loan.

1187
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:45,947
Let me see it.

1188
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:47,950
What have you done now?

1189
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,460
At first opportunity,
you'll take other's responsibility.

1190
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:52,629
If Sankaraiah fails
to repay the loan,

1191
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,127
Kotaiah will throw you
to the streets.

1192
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:55,457
Yes, he'll do it.

1193
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,130
First think about your slippers,

1194
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,803
before spreading
a carpet to the world.

1195
01:09:01,005 --> 01:09:03,132
I didn't spread any
carpet to the world.

1196
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,467
I just removed a thorn
my neighbour ran into.

1197
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:06,142
That's all!

1198
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:08,268
You'll never change.

1199
01:09:15,019 --> 01:09:17,817
Got your EAMCET results?
- Yes uncle.

1200
01:09:18,022 --> 01:09:18,989
What rank did you get?

1201
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,816
He got 30 and I got 40.

1202
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:23,652
You've got very good ranks.

1203
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:25,658
Yes, indeed great ranks...

1204
01:09:25,863 --> 01:09:28,832
I got in 30000's and
he got in 40000's.

1205
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,667
If you get such great ranks,
how can you get an engineering seat?

1206
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:32,995
Why not, if you pay donation?

1207
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:36,172
How can I pay lakhs of donation?

1208
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:37,670
Is it possible for me?

1209
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,175
I don't know what you'll do,

1210
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,173
I'm doing Engineering
in Bangalore, that's final.

1211
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:44,006
This is the problem with you,
you're very stubborn.

1212
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:46,273
Okay... let me see.

1213
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:50,186
Who is getting a seat
without paying donation?

1214
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,412
Pavan, put your legs down.

1215
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:55,685
You'll not get a seat here,
ask your father,

1216
01:09:55,893 --> 01:09:58,020
let's go to Bangalore and
do engineering there. - Okay.

1217
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:58,956
No way.

1218
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:01,360
I'll not agree to pay for
your engineering seat.

1219
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,534
You know, Pavan's father is
paying donation for his seat.

1220
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:05,531
Why not you?

1221
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:09,035
I don't want my son to buy
engineering degree. I'll not pay.

1222
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:12,037
Why're you so stubborn?
What's wrong in asking you?

1223
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:15,541
How can you study now
without paying donations?

1224
01:10:15,746 --> 01:10:18,715
Buying education will not work,
work hard to educate yourself.

1225
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:22,044
I can spend anything
for studying not to buy.

1226
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:24,049
I'm not able to understand
anything you say.

1227
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,881
What's there in it
not to understand?

1228
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,723
You got a rank in 30000's,

1229
01:10:27,925 --> 01:10:29,552
that means you're not qualified
to become an engineer.

1230
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:31,053
If you really want
to become an engineer,

1231
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,058
study hard and write
the entrance exam again.

1232
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:36,061
I can spend anything for studies.
- What's your idea dad?

1233
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:38,401
There are lakhs of people like
me with ranks above 30000's,

1234
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,230
they are paying money to
become engineers. Why shouldn't I?

1235
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:42,132
You're right.

1236
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,135
Unqualified people are paying...

1237
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,569
to become doctors,
engineers and lawyers.

1238
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:50,076
They are doctors for namesake only.
They can't treat anyone.

1239
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,248
Namesake engineers,
buildings crumble like pack of cards.

1240
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,576
Namesake lawyers,
justice is miscarried.

1241
01:10:54,785 --> 01:10:57,583
They become a burden to the nation,
they are not worth a dime.

1242
01:10:57,955 --> 01:11:00,924
I don't want you also to become
one of those namesake engineers.

1243
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,753
Sir Arthur Cotton...
Mokshagundam Viswesraiah...

1244
01:11:04,962 --> 01:11:07,760
Our President Abdul Kalam...
they are true engineers.

1245
01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:11,093
Do you expect every engineer
to become an Abdul Kalam?

1246
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,099
No need... but you must have
a passion to become one.

1247
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,272
Father, I'm not a genius
like Abdul Kalam,

1248
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,100
I'm an average student.

1249
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,443
Even Abdul Kalam was
an average student,

1250
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:24,375
but the desire of engineer
made him a bright student.

1251
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:27,450
Develop interest in studies.
Got it son?

1252
01:11:27,818 --> 01:11:29,786
Never again talk about
donation with me.

1253
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:31,955
Yuck! Unnecessarily I was
born in this house.

1254
01:11:32,156 --> 01:11:33,953
If I had been born in
Subrahmanyam's house,

1255
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:35,284
I would've become
an engineer.

1256
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,531
You've passed in all the tests,

1257
01:11:45,002 --> 01:11:47,470
There's one more final test...
you've to pass that also.

1258
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:48,467
Tell me sir,
what is the test?

1259
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,799
There's one Mr. Ramanarayana
waiting outside, go & meet him.

1260
01:11:51,008 --> 01:11:51,975
He'll give you the details.

1261
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,310
Got it? What's the final test?

1262
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:01,477
Bring Rs. 3 lakhs
and take SI's job.

1263
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:07,487
Sir, I passed all the tests,

1264
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:12,324
I got selected in
personal interview also.

1265
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:13,496
Why should I pay money?

1266
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:16,495
Asking me why? What do you think
is the power of an SI's post?

1267
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,158
It's a golden egg laying goose,
if you want it, pay now...

1268
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,166
Paid sir.

1269
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:24,499
Rs. 3 lakhs sir... count it.
- No need,

1270
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,335
paying bribe and a prostitute
will always be correct.

1271
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:27,510
You've got the job!

1272
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:29,508
Look, he has got the job
without passing any tests.

1273
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:32,238
Don't think too much! There're just
two posts available, bye.

1274
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,512
Why are you still pondering?

1275
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:40,451
Once you become SI, just 3 months
is enough to earn Rs. 3 lakhs.

1276
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:41,850
You take care of Punjagutta circle,

1277
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:44,527
I'll take care of Ameerpet circle.
That's it!

1278
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:45,922
Go and ask money
from your father.

1279
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:48,364
I'll not give.

1280
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:51,125
I know this will be your answer.

1281
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:52,861
But you've to.

1282
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,470
Though I had passed all the tests,
I'm forced to pay up.

1283
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:59,266
Suri got the job without any
tests and by paying bribe.

1284
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,208
If I've to become an SI,
you've to cough up Rs. 3 lakhs.

1285
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:06,705
Look, you'll pay Rs. 3 lakhs
and buy the SI job,

1286
01:13:07,084 --> 01:13:09,882
you'll take bribes to get
back your money.

1287
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,878
When I gave bribe, you'll justify,
why not I take bribes,

1288
01:13:14,091 --> 01:13:15,388
and become a corrupt officer.

1289
01:13:15,926 --> 01:13:17,723
I don't want to send a corrupt
officer from my house.

1290
01:13:17,928 --> 01:13:20,488
Father, that's where
our opinions clash.

1291
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,823
I passed all the tests honestly.

1292
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,068
What can I do if
they are not honest?

1293
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:26,236
Can I bring a change in them?

1294
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:30,395
I didn't tell you to bring
a change in them. You be honest.

1295
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:33,235
I don't care all that.
I don't know how you do it.

1296
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:34,967
I want that SI's job!

1297
01:13:38,115 --> 01:13:41,414
Okay, let's forget about it
and find a new job.

1298
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:44,413
Let's file a case against the
officer who wanted bribe.

1299
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:45,747
What are you saying father?

1300
01:13:45,956 --> 01:13:47,583
Do you want to file a case
and go around courts?

1301
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,258
If we pay the money
spent on it as bribe,

1302
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:50,426
I'll get the job, you know?

1303
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:53,755
How can you say we'll not
get justice before hand?

1304
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:57,593
Look, I don't trust cases & courts.
I trust only bribe.

1305
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:00,929
Tell me, will you pay
Rs. 3 lakhs or not? - I'll not.

1306
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,597
Now I've understood you,

1307
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,933
you said he's unqualified
to become an engineer,

1308
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:07,269
I'm losing the SI's job,
though I'm qualified.

1309
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:10,776
Are you covering your
incompetency as morals?

1310
01:14:10,981 --> 01:14:14,280
Yuck! Even miser Kotaiah
is better than you.

1311
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:23,884
Take your fare.

1312
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:27,289
Did you've a comfortable journey?
- Yes father.

1313
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:28,631
Come in.

1314
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:33,159
You look tired,
go in and take rest.

1315
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,473
Have this sweet.

1316
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:50,315
My husband is a software
professional, isn't he?

1317
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,044
He's planning to go to America.

1318
01:14:52,356 --> 01:14:54,324
He met consultant
also on the way back.

1319
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,488
They have asked him to
come again for formalities.

1320
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,320
Happy to hear it. Go.

1321
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:02,157
No daddy, they are asking Rs. 4 lakhs
to send him to America.

1322
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:04,664
It'll be nice if you
arrange funds for him...

1323
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:06,927
Why? Did they ask as deposit?

1324
01:15:07,371 --> 01:15:10,272
No, we have to find a job
within six months.

1325
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,341
How will you survive
those 6 months?

1326
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,739
We'll work in hotels
or petrol bunks.

1327
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:17,510
Can't you do the same job here?

1328
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,682
And try to get a job
in Infosys or Wipro.

1329
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:22,351
Do you want me to work
as petrol delivery boy?

1330
01:15:23,053 --> 01:15:23,951
What's wrong in it?

1331
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:27,019
When you're not ashamed to do
in America, why feel here?

1332
01:15:27,224 --> 01:15:30,751
In India we get paltry rupees,
but in America we get dollars.

1333
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:35,198
You need those paltry rupees
to go to America.

1334
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:38,197
If you don't find a job
within 6 months,

1335
01:15:38,402 --> 01:15:40,700
they will confiscate your Visa
and deport you to India.

1336
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:44,199
Again you'll need the same
paltry rupees to survive.

1337
01:15:44,408 --> 01:15:45,204
Father-in-law!

1338
01:15:47,244 --> 01:15:49,974
Oh! Has sweet turned spicy so soon.

1339
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:53,375
I didn't hurt you.
I'm telling you a truth.

1340
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:56,715
If you're worth,
nothing can stop you.

1341
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,388
If you're unworthy,
you're a waste anywhere.

1342
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:01,557
Daddy, we don't want your advises
and moral instructions,

1343
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:02,656
give us money,
that's enough!

1344
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:06,061
I'll not give.

1345
01:16:06,263 --> 01:16:08,060
Don't give...
don't give anything...

1346
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:09,729
You don't want Chinna
to become an engineer,

1347
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,560
you don't want elder son
to become SI,

1348
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:13,736
you don't want son-in-law and
daughter to go to America.

1349
01:16:14,438 --> 01:16:17,737
I'm seeing first time a father who doesn't
care about his children's future.

1350
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:20,068
Why don't you try
to understand me?

1351
01:16:20,277 --> 01:16:21,574
What's there to understand?

1352
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:23,905
You claim to have loved
home and society alike.

1353
01:16:24,114 --> 01:16:26,412
Why don't you follow the
society's path that you love?

1354
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:29,915
Your friend Subrahmanyam paid donation
for the engineering seat to his son.

1355
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,747
Kotaiah bought SI's job.

1356
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:34,082
Your Chairman has sent his son to
America for higher studies.

1357
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,088
They are the people you love,
aren't they?

1358
01:16:36,293 --> 01:16:37,760
They are much forward than you.

1359
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,758
If you go backward
with your ideals,

1360
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:41,430
they will not award you
with an Idealist title.

1361
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,428
They will make fun of you
as useless man.

1362
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,435
Fearing their fun,
do you want me to change my path?

1363
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:50,265
I'll try to bring them back to my path,
I'll never go wayward.

1364
01:16:50,474 --> 01:16:51,600
Stop it!

1365
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:53,605
They said win at home
and then world.

1366
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:58,440
I'm seeing for the first time a
head of family so unconcerned.

1367
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:02,379
Sir, you must save my son.
- What happened?

1368
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,117
He's fighting death after
an accident. - Oh My god!

1369
01:17:05,322 --> 01:17:08,382
He's in hospital, he has hurt
his head severely.

1370
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,523
They suggested an
emergency operation.

1371
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:12,454
It'll cost Rs. 1 lakh.

1372
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:14,964
I can't muster that much
fund immediately.

1373
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:18,297
Chairman is also not in town.

1374
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,133
You must save my son
at any cost sir.

1375
01:17:21,338 --> 01:17:25,638
You don't worry!
I'll come immediately. - Okay sir...

1376
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:43,151
For you only!

1377
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,997
When people say father-in-law is
greatman, I took it lightly.

1378
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:53,169
Instead of giving it
to his children,

1379
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:56,669
I just came to know he's a beggar
who gives alms to beggars.

1380
01:17:57,374 --> 01:18:01,174
Didn't you find anyone else to seek
money other than my father?

1381
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:02,845
You keep quiet, mother.

1382
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:04,911
Hey Oldman! Why are you
still standing here?

1383
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:07,012
Clear away from here,
before my father comes back.

1384
01:18:07,384 --> 01:18:10,182
Or else I'll throw you out!
- What's that?

1385
01:18:10,387 --> 01:18:11,684
Mother, I'm warning you,

1386
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,914
if you don't stop father now,
I'll leave this home.

1387
01:18:15,392 --> 01:18:17,860
Why are you still here?
Go... get out!

1388
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,525
Go!

1389
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,867
Here... here...

1390
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:27,202
I want Rs. 1 lakh immediately.

1391
01:18:27,404 --> 01:18:30,373
This is Vanasthalipuram
plot documents.

1392
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:33,270
I'll give but you've to
accept your defeat.

1393
01:18:34,578 --> 01:18:36,205
Give me Rs. 1 lakh now,
I'll accept defeat.

1394
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:40,042
How can I give without any pledge?
I'll give... sit there.

1395
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:42,476
Be quick! I must go urgently.
- Sit, I'll get money.

1396
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:45,277
You've come urgently for
Rs. 1 lakh, it means,

1397
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:48,223
someone would've come
seeking help from you.

1398
01:18:48,425 --> 01:18:49,892
You would've promised him.

1399
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:52,220
By the way, who is that beggar?
- That's none of your business.

1400
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:54,226
Indeed it is unnecessary to me,

1401
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:58,390
helping every Tom, Dick and Harry,
I'm sure you'll come to the streets.

1402
01:18:58,602 --> 01:19:01,230
Stop Raghuramaiah!
Look at this.

1403
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:03,906
Despite my warnings,

1404
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:06,234
when she claimed her daughter
is suffering from cancer,

1405
01:19:06,443 --> 01:19:08,741
you donated money generously
like a great philanthropist.

1406
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:10,071
Have you read now?

1407
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:12,915
It has been proved that
she was cheat.

1408
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:17,746
That's why I love money and
respect it than humans.

1409
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,751
But I'm extremely happy Kotaiah!

1410
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,082
Happy? Why?

1411
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,259
It's proved that the little girl
is not affected with cancer.

1412
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,586
That's enough for me.

1413
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:25,920
You helped in time, thanks.

1414
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:28,757
Brother, water.
- I've to go out urgently.

1415
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:32,260
Even god can't save you with
so many bad habits.

1416
01:19:32,469 --> 01:19:33,766
He doesn't have any bad habits.

1417
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,267
Pity, Mercy, Compassion!

1418
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:38,600
What other bad habits one needs
to ruin his own life!

1419
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:52,455
Where is Mallaiah?

1420
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,958
I don't know.
Who knows?

1421
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:00,891
Stop!

1422
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:11,030
You're giving money
to some stranger.

1423
01:20:11,508 --> 01:20:12,372
I won't stop you.

1424
01:20:13,276 --> 01:20:15,972
But, settle the money
to my children too.

1425
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:21,045
Promise me that you'll make
their desires come true.

1426
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:30,723
Promise me if you want
our relationship to continue.

1427
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:45,864
The world is no different
to home to this man.

1428
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:55,683
These 4 people haven't understood
his objective for now.

1429
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:01,720
Without money,
I can't do it.

1430
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:03,483
As a doctor,
how could you say that.

1431
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:04,489
How many times
do I've to tell you?

1432
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,025
Here is the money.
Perform the operation.

1433
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,094
Bought the money!
Pay it in the counter.

1434
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:09,697
I'll get ready the
operation theatre. - Okay.

1435
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,625
Look... - Mad man.

1436
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:12,358
You're a God.

1437
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:15,094
Pay the money in the counter and
find out what has to be done.

1438
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:16,772
Go. - Okay sir.

1439
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:26,372
The arrangements are good.

1440
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:29,074
I've arranged this bride seeing
scheme in a very simple manner.

1441
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:30,047
Scheme!

1442
01:21:30,387 --> 01:21:31,786
Why is he calling it a scheme?

1443
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,579
There is no cheating
in this, right?

1444
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:36,281
Don't mistake him.
Explain him.

1445
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:41,425
Sir, I worked in State Govt. For 40 years
and retired very recently.

1446
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,429
I had implemented
many govt. Schemes.

1447
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:46,625
Since I was used to it,
I said scheme by mistake.

1448
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:47,530
Thank God!

1449
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:50,569
You didn't made us wash dishes
saying it's 'Self help scheme'.

1450
01:21:50,774 --> 01:21:52,332
The way you talk is
very interesting.

1451
01:21:52,976 --> 01:21:54,307
Son-in-law, what would you
like to have?

1452
01:21:54,511 --> 01:21:55,068
Coffee... Tea...?

1453
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:56,404
Don't call him as
Son-in-law so soon?

1454
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:57,910
Father... - What's it?

1455
01:21:58,815 --> 01:21:59,839
Call your daughter.

1456
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:02,382
He'll see what he wants and
I'll see what I want.

1457
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:04,447
Sir, what he means is,

1458
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:08,488
his son will see her beauty and
he'll see to the other matters.

1459
01:22:08,692 --> 01:22:10,421
To hell with your
other matters.

1460
01:22:10,627 --> 01:22:12,754
Were you also working in
State govt. Along with him?

1461
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:15,362
Can't you clearly say dowry?

1462
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:17,055
Is your daughter fair or
dark complexioned?

1463
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,428
She'll be like me.
- Is she bald?

1464
01:22:19,703 --> 01:22:20,931
No, very fair.

1465
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:24,105
We aren't concerned about
your daughter's complexion.

1466
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,600
We're concerned about dowry.
White or Black?

1467
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:29,208
Greetings.

1468
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:30,709
Sit down. - Please sit down.

1469
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:33,272
I like the girl. - Me too.

1470
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:34,950
Me too, father.
- You also say.

1471
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:36,743
I like the girl too.
- I 'll slipper you.

1472
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:38,419
Hold a mike & say you like her.

1473
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,248
Let everyone in the city know it.
Useless fellow!

1474
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,420
If they know you like her,

1475
01:22:42,659 --> 01:22:43,990
your dowry rate will fall down.

1476
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:47,823
To get this minus married,
I've to earn from plus like you.

1477
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:48,520
Yuck!

1478
01:22:48,732 --> 01:22:49,323
Change your position.

1479
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:50,055
You listened to him, didn't you?

1480
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:52,826
He likes her. Take her in.
- Please go inside.

1481
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:55,527
Look at her height.
- Perfect choice.

1482
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:57,070
Priest, why are you
sitting silently?

1483
01:22:57,474 --> 01:22:58,532
The other matters...

1484
01:22:58,742 --> 01:23:02,974
Actually... - I'll give you
Rs. 4 lakhs as dowry.

1485
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,805
How much?
- 4 lakhs.

1486
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:08,779
Lakhs! He's saying as if
it is 4 crores.

1487
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:11,383
I paid Rs. 4 lakhs bribe
for his SI's job.

1488
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:14,386
Father, I said I like the girl.
Why talk about dowry now?

1489
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:17,992
Why? For this.

1490
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,024
What is this?

1491
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:22,896
From feeding bottle to the
Police uniform you wore,

1492
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:24,191
I've noted down all
the expenses in this.

1493
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,230
This is only the principle.

1494
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:26,959
I've must get it with interest.

1495
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,432
Maintaining an account of
your son's expenses!

1496
01:23:28,638 --> 01:23:30,868
People will beat with slippers
if I maintain an account of other's sons.

1497
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:35,541
You're getting respected because
you're my son and a police officer.

1498
01:23:35,745 --> 01:23:37,269
Think about your position
if you don't have these.

1499
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,243
What will be my position?
- Position?

1500
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:42,149
O bald head, he is not my son.

1501
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:43,910
Father!
- I said you're not my son.

1502
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,347
He's my son,
a police officer.

1503
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:53,092
What will this son-in-law have?
- He'll drink pesticide.

1504
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:54,456
Father! - Didn't I say
you're not my son.

1505
01:23:54,664 --> 01:23:55,289
Stop it.

1506
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,063
Ask your daughter to bring milk.

1507
01:23:58,635 --> 01:24:00,262
I said just like that, but you're
dreaming about your first night!

1508
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:02,505
Father, what's all this?

1509
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,037
Sir, tell me,
who is my son-in-law?

1510
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:08,074
Tell me the dowry you will pay.
I'll tell you, who your son-in-law is?

1511
01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:11,179
For the time being,
adjust with Rs. 4 lakhs.

1512
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:15,681
After marriage,
there are other schemes too.

1513
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,853
We're not interested
about those schemes.

1514
01:24:18,121 --> 01:24:20,885
My son's price is Rs. 10 lakhs.
If you agree, inform us.

1515
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,025
Or else, I consider
this scheme, a failure.

1516
01:24:24,227 --> 01:24:25,194
Get up.
- You too.

1517
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:26,223
Water sir.

1518
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:29,028
How is your son?

1519
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:31,029
Because of you, he survived
from the clutches of death.

1520
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:34,893
I'll repay your money very soon.
- That's okay.

1521
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:38,065
To repay my money,
don't take loan from others.

1522
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:38,865
As you say sir.

1523
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:45,275
Who're you?
What do you want?

1524
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:48,177
My name is Giri.
I've come to meet Mr. Raghuram.

1525
01:24:49,552 --> 01:24:51,747
Where are you coming from?
- From Mental hospital.

1526
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:56,221
A mental named Giri, whose mental
disorder is cured has come to see you sir.

1527
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:59,961
Don't call a cured man
as mental.

1528
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:01,596
Sorry sir.
- That's alright. Call him.

1529
01:25:01,798 --> 01:25:04,426
Giri...
- Greetings sir. I'm Giri sir.

1530
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:06,158
Giri, are you fine?
- I'm very fine.

1531
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:09,770
My mental disorder is fully cured.
Even the doctor has certified it.

1532
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:11,203
I'm very happy to hear that.

1533
01:25:11,474 --> 01:25:15,911
Mallaiah, I'm appointing Giri
as House keeping officer.

1534
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:17,203
As what?

1535
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,108
As the sweeper.
- I see.

1536
01:25:19,315 --> 01:25:21,306
Tell him about his job.
- Okay sir.

1537
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:22,814
Thank you sir.

1538
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:26,885
Indra, did you pack your
father's lunch box? - No.

1539
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:28,716
No?

1540
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:30,450
What has happened?

1541
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,684
Why should I be concerned
about a person?

1542
01:25:31,895 --> 01:25:32,657
Who is not concerned about us?

1543
01:25:32,862 --> 01:25:33,658
Shut up.

1544
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,695
It is my mistake for asking
you to pack his lunch box.

1545
01:25:40,837 --> 01:25:42,828
Hubby, I've kept dhal
in the top box.

1546
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:44,267
Don't leave anything.

1547
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:49,168
There is tomato soup
in the second.

1548
01:25:49,379 --> 01:25:50,812
Since you love it,
I've packed plenty.

1549
01:25:54,684 --> 01:25:56,447
You don't eat curd rice,
if curd is packed separately.

1550
01:25:56,653 --> 01:25:58,314
So, I've mixed curd & rice.

1551
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:03,388
Don't forget to have lunch
in your busy schedule.

1552
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:05,584
You'll atleast think about us
when you see the lunch box.

1553
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:07,196
I was born in this
house for nothing.

1554
01:26:07,397 --> 01:26:10,025
If I had been born in Subrahmanyam's
house, I would've become an Engineer.

1555
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:14,430
The miser Kotaiah
is better than you.

1556
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:21,907
We need money not your advices
and moral instructions.

1557
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,375
Win at home and then world.

1558
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:29,749
First time I'm seeing a head of
family so unconcerned.

1559
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:03,008
In this competitive world, every need
must be fulfilled. Nothing is wrong.

1560
01:28:03,713 --> 01:28:05,340
If the bus we travel
meets with an accident,

1561
01:28:05,548 --> 01:28:07,778
we break the emergency door
and come out. Is it wrong?

1562
01:28:09,152 --> 01:28:11,677
People like us are in
danger every second.

1563
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:13,318
In my point of view,
doing wrong...

1564
01:28:13,556 --> 01:28:15,217
is like breaking the emergency door.
Enough.

1565
01:28:15,425 --> 01:28:16,414
Stop it.

1566
01:28:17,693 --> 01:28:18,921
I didn't mean you.
You carry on.

1567
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:23,727
I may forgive my children
if they are useless.

1568
01:28:23,933 --> 01:28:26,367
But I won't allow them
to lead a corrupt life.

1569
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:30,665
On whose name this house is registered?
- On the owner's name.

1570
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,033
Owner means your father, right?

1571
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:34,536
A own house for us!
This is a rented house.

1572
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:39,240
No way.
We must do something.

1573
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:42,546
You need money to do anything.
- You're right.

1574
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,387
Whatever we may do,
it's only for money. - Yes.

1575
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,422
I want to become an SI,

1576
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:49,953
he wants to become
an engineer,

1577
01:28:50,259 --> 01:28:51,624
you both want to
go to America.

1578
01:28:52,028 --> 01:28:53,757
All this is to make money.

1579
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,727
To make money,
we need to invest money.

1580
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:00,294
Who'll provide that?
- Who else other than your father.

1581
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:02,935
Didn't you see the confusion
in our house the other day?

1582
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:04,967
My father doesn't
have that much money.

1583
01:29:05,675 --> 01:29:07,643
I know that.

1584
01:29:08,144 --> 01:29:09,668
He has earned a good name
in the society.

1585
01:29:09,879 --> 01:29:11,642
That's enough for us
to make money.

1586
01:29:11,981 --> 01:29:13,209
I didn't get you.

1587
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:14,542
I've understood.

1588
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:15,909
What is the business,
we're planning to start?

1589
01:29:17,653 --> 01:29:19,120
Let's open a Chit Fund Company
on your father's name.

1590
01:29:19,322 --> 01:29:20,789
We'll be the directors.

1591
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:24,391
If people know Raghuram's sons,
son-in-law have started a finance co.,

1592
01:29:24,627 --> 01:29:26,754
then all the people in this colony
will deposit money in our company.

1593
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,791
Our needs will get fulfilled.

1594
01:29:29,298 --> 01:29:30,265
The plan is very good.

1595
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:32,229
What if you go away to America
after opening the company...?

1596
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:33,958
What's that silly doubt?

1597
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,034
When I've so much money,
will I go to America?

1598
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,002
We have no business experience.

1599
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:40,374
If something goes wrong...?
- What if something goes wrong...!

1600
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:43,977
As long as we've money,
we can solve any problem.

1601
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,045
If it is out of control,

1602
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:47,307
it is the people who are going
to suffer & not us.

1603
01:29:47,517 --> 01:29:48,415
This is cheating.

1604
01:29:49,519 --> 01:29:50,417
What cheating?

1605
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:53,453
Swindling money from students like you
as donation. Isn't it a cheating?

1606
01:29:53,656 --> 01:29:55,248
Though he is qualified
for a SI's post,

1607
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:57,983
they said he'll get the job, only if he
pays Rs. 3 lakhs. Isn't it a cheating?

1608
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:03,026
There is nothing wrong in cheating
the society which has cheated us,

1609
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:04,722
I'm ready.
When shall we start the company?

1610
01:30:07,003 --> 01:30:09,699
Yuck! I never thought that you
would marry such a cheap guy.

1611
01:30:10,339 --> 01:30:12,068
You people don't know
to lead a honest life.

1612
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,542
So, you've planned
to cheat people.

1613
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:17,110
We don't have a job like you
to be honest.

1614
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,872
Bharathi, didn't you hear what he said?
At least you advice him.

1615
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:22,682
What am I to advice him?

1616
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:27,649
If a father like you doesn't
care about his children,

1617
01:30:28,124 --> 01:30:29,819
they will turn into
thieves & cheats.

1618
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,722
For giving birth to us,
give us Rs. 5 lakhs each.

1619
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:36,160
We won't cheat anyone.
We'll listen to you.

1620
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:38,731
What? Trying to blackmail me.

1621
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:40,429
I'm not blackmailing you.

1622
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:43,566
If you don't want us
to use your name,

1623
01:30:43,806 --> 01:30:46,138
give us 5 lakhs each.
We'll live on our own efforts.

1624
01:30:46,342 --> 01:30:48,139
Shekar, what are you talking?

1625
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:50,173
Father-in-law doesn't have that
much money to give us.

1626
01:30:50,379 --> 01:30:51,744
We know that he doesn't
have the money.

1627
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:53,480
But he has friends
all over the city.

1628
01:30:53,683 --> 01:30:55,981
He has to just ask them.
Money will come to his door step.

1629
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:04,489
We would be very happy if you
arrange the money in 2 days.

1630
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:15,095
Volga

1631
01:31:15,371 --> 01:31:19,432
Has your hopes dashed?

1632
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:26,010
Has the noose tightened?

1633
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:36,356
Has you ideal got wet in turmoil?

1634
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,530
If I don't give them money,
my children will take to wrong path.

1635
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:47,928
They won't even hesitate
to cheat people.

1636
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:49,533
If it shouldn't happen,

1637
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:52,264
I must give them the money
they had asked for.

1638
01:31:52,908 --> 01:31:56,708
But who will give me
so much money right now?

1639
01:32:01,384 --> 01:32:02,351
Welcome...

1640
01:32:02,551 --> 01:32:03,950
Mine is a compound
interest business.

1641
01:32:04,153 --> 01:32:05,051
For those who are in need of money,

1642
01:32:05,254 --> 01:32:06,915
I will be better
than an ATM center.

1643
01:32:07,123 --> 01:32:10,581
Because ATM has limits.
I don't have any.

1644
01:32:10,793 --> 01:32:11,919
No matter how many lakhs
you may ask for.

1645
01:32:12,128 --> 01:32:14,323
Spot decision & spot payments.

1646
01:32:14,597 --> 01:32:16,827
But you must have
something to pledge.

1647
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,626
How food is necessary to live,

1648
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:21,860
you must have something
to pledge to get a loan.

1649
01:32:24,307 --> 01:32:26,400
Hey Raghuram, want any loan?

1650
01:32:26,642 --> 01:32:27,472
What do you have to pledge?

1651
01:32:27,743 --> 01:32:30,007
Utensils to Charminar,
I'm ready to take anything.

1652
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:31,375
What? You don't have
anything to pledge.

1653
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:35,474
Sorry. I don't give money
without pledging anything

1654
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:41,556
Want 15 lakhs...?

1655
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:44,152
Come, I'll give you.

1656
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:47,224
Here is the money.

1657
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:48,587
Why are you staring at me?

1658
01:32:48,798 --> 01:32:50,493
It is you who told me that
money is only paper.

1659
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,863
Take it.

1660
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:01,607
Give 5 lakhs to Mr. Raghuram.

1661
01:33:02,611 --> 01:33:04,602
Tomorrow is the salary day.

1662
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,279
No problem,
make the necessary arrangements.

1663
01:33:06,482 --> 01:33:07,107
Okay sir.

1664
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:08,815
In which account
should I debit this?

1665
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,582
In my personal account.

1666
01:33:15,858 --> 01:33:17,485
Brother...

1667
01:33:17,827 --> 01:33:18,293
Welcome.

1668
01:33:20,296 --> 01:33:23,129
Mastan, Zaheer has come.

1669
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:27,062
I'm Raghuram & not Zaheer.
- I know.

1670
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:29,836
Zaheer is my elder son's name.
But he is no more.

1671
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:33,497
You saved our family.
So, I called you Zaheer.

1672
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:40,637
Welcome Raghuram.

1673
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:43,585
Infact, I wanted to meet you.
But you've come.

1674
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:45,346
Please come.

1675
01:33:46,021 --> 01:33:47,648
Rashmi & Badshah, please go out.

1676
01:33:48,691 --> 01:33:51,990
Greetings brother.
- Greetings. Greetings brother.

1677
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:53,821
You too Mumtaz.
- Okay.

1678
01:34:03,372 --> 01:34:05,272
Please take it. Rs. 5 lakhs.

1679
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:08,671
Mastan bhai, why're you giving
me money so secretly?

1680
01:34:08,878 --> 01:34:12,177
I don't like anyone
to know about this.

1681
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:14,682
If people know that
you owe me money,

1682
01:34:14,884 --> 01:34:16,146
your honour will be at stake.

1683
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:22,756
Even if I die, my people shouldn't
trouble you asking for money.

1684
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:38,797
Volga

1685
01:34:39,008 --> 01:34:39,975
Have you gone mad?

1686
01:34:40,509 --> 01:34:42,704
You joined engineering
because you liked it.

1687
01:34:42,912 --> 01:34:43,708
Have you got bored
with it so soon?

1688
01:34:43,913 --> 01:34:44,709
Just because you paid donation,

1689
01:34:44,914 --> 01:34:46,142
it doesn't mean that I shouldn't
get bored of that subject.

1690
01:34:46,415 --> 01:34:47,541
I've started to hate mathematics.

1691
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:48,307
I won't do engineering.

1692
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:49,711
I'll join some college and
will do some degree course.

1693
01:34:49,919 --> 01:34:50,647
Hey...

1694
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,221
I paid 4 lakhs as donation,
not just 1 or 2 lakhs.

1695
01:34:54,423 --> 01:34:55,219
I borrowed that money.

1696
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:58,319
You're worried about the money
you paid & not my interests.

1697
01:34:58,527 --> 01:34:59,892
Yes, I'm money minded now.

1698
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:01,153
I'm least bothered
about your interests.

1699
01:35:01,397 --> 01:35:03,024
If you don't complete
your engineering degree,

1700
01:35:03,232 --> 01:35:03,994
I'll break your legs.

1701
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,064
I would rather walk out
of this house,

1702
01:35:05,267 --> 01:35:06,097
but I won't do engineering.

1703
01:35:06,602 --> 01:35:07,261
Threatening me...?

1704
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,000
Go... go man.

1705
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:11,666
Why are you still
standing here? Go.

1706
01:35:13,609 --> 01:35:15,406
You brought him up luxuries and
he doesn't know the value of money.

1707
01:35:15,611 --> 01:35:16,737
No point in blaming him now.

1708
01:35:16,946 --> 01:35:17,640
You shut up.

1709
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,647
Don't even give him a glass of water.

1710
01:35:20,282 --> 01:35:22,079
Get me & Raghuram some coffee.

1711
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:25,576
I didn't pay the donation
to avoid such situations.

1712
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:29,288
Are you justifying yourself
using the situation?

1713
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:34,786
If he had told me this after 4 years
I would've really got hurt.

1714
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,761
Thank god he told me that now.
My problem will get reduced.

1715
01:35:37,132 --> 01:35:37,996
And talking about money,

1716
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:40,563
we always have money problem.

1717
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:41,598
Come & sit.

1718
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:46,041
You phoned that you wanted
a favor from me.

1719
01:35:46,642 --> 01:35:49,202
Oh No! Nothing.
I'll discuss about that later.

1720
01:35:49,445 --> 01:35:50,469
What's there to talk later?

1721
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:53,179
Hey, don't think that
I'm advising you again.

1722
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:57,010
Stop sticking to your
old principles.

1723
01:35:57,653 --> 01:35:58,779
Fulfill your children's aspirations.

1724
01:36:06,662 --> 01:36:09,529
I've lost.
You've won Kotaiah.

1725
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:12,359
What did you say?
- I said you've won.

1726
01:36:13,402 --> 01:36:18,135
Only now I understood that life
runs on money & not on love.

1727
01:36:20,009 --> 01:36:21,704
That was very sweet to hear.

1728
01:36:22,111 --> 01:36:27,674
Have you understood, even the Great
Raghuram has bowed before money?

1729
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:29,679
Let me tell you a fact.

1730
01:36:30,019 --> 01:36:31,486
Eagle is the transport
to Lord Vishnu.

1731
01:36:31,687 --> 01:36:32,813
Nandhi is the transport
to Lord Shiva.

1732
01:36:33,022 --> 01:36:36,651
Human is the transport to the
money which rules this world,

1733
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:40,158
Okay, that's fine.
You've accepted your defeat.

1734
01:36:40,362 --> 01:36:41,260
Do you want money?
- Yes.

1735
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:42,987
How much?
- 5 lakhs.

1736
01:36:44,033 --> 01:36:46,024
5 lakhs...?
- Can't you give me?

1737
01:36:46,201 --> 01:36:47,930
Why not?

1738
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:50,865
But you need to pledge something
for that much money...

1739
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:53,531
I don't have anything.

1740
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:55,835
Without pledging anything...

1741
01:36:56,946 --> 01:36:58,345
Tell me if you won't.
- Why won't I give you?

1742
01:36:58,881 --> 01:36:59,848
That's my business.

1743
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:04,852
But my business rule says
that I must...

1744
01:37:05,554 --> 01:37:09,888
I will give you money
by breaking the rule.

1745
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:11,526
Do you know why?

1746
01:37:12,428 --> 01:37:15,761
Because you're an incompetent
who can't cheat,

1747
01:37:16,031 --> 01:37:18,499
a mad man who believes in good.

1748
01:37:19,068 --> 01:37:19,727
That's the reason, I'll give you.

1749
01:37:20,002 --> 01:37:20,730
Please wait. I'll bring it.

1750
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:36,378
Volga

1751
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:38,780
It's very late.
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?

1752
01:37:38,988 --> 01:37:40,888
I didn't get sleep.
So I didn't go to bed.

1753
01:37:52,768 --> 01:37:54,235
Please reduce the TV volume.

1754
01:37:55,104 --> 01:37:58,437
I'm Raghuram speaking.
Who're you?

1755
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:02,038
Please reduce the TV volume.

1756
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:08,340
Reduce the volume, idiots.

1757
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:10,085
Do you have to shout to say that?

1758
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:11,252
Can't you say that politely?

1759
01:38:11,453 --> 01:39:00,696
Volga

1760
01:39:00,803 --> 01:39:03,601
Thanks for understanding
our problems at least now.

1761
01:39:06,975 --> 01:39:08,875
Father-in-law,
I know your capacity.

1762
01:39:09,311 --> 01:39:11,006
I also know that you won't
hurt your children.

1763
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:17,579
When asked to a Rupee,
"What will you do?",

1764
01:39:18,754 --> 01:39:20,688
It said that,
I'll make Harischandra to tell a lie,

1765
01:39:21,557 --> 01:39:23,525
make a husband & wife quarrel,

1766
01:39:24,393 --> 01:39:26,020
separate a father from his son,

1767
01:39:26,895 --> 01:39:28,954
spark sibling rivalry,

1768
01:39:30,065 --> 01:39:33,523
and finally, it said that it
will separate close friends also.

1769
01:39:33,736 --> 01:39:37,832
I thought my home was
an excuse to such a Rupee.

1770
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:41,604
But I never expected that rupee
will enter my home,

1771
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:48,213
and destroy bonds & relationship.

1772
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:55,822
I wanted to correct you people.

1773
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:59,894
But you people think that
money will correct everything,

1774
01:40:01,196 --> 01:40:03,164
money will make everything
look good,

1775
01:40:04,166 --> 01:40:06,396
and said that you'll be fine,
only if you've money.

1776
01:40:06,668 --> 01:40:11,002
I didn't want you to spoil your life
by taking wrong decisions.

1777
01:40:11,507 --> 01:40:12,667
So, I gave you this money.

1778
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:19,403
As children of Raghuram,
I didn't want you to commit any wrong.

1779
01:40:19,615 --> 01:40:20,445
So, I gave you this money.

1780
01:40:25,487 --> 01:40:27,079
Are you happy now?

1781
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:32,091
You may not be feeling hungry
on seeing them happy.

1782
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:34,494
But I'm hungry.

1783
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:36,763
Oh No! Wait for some more time.

1784
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,029
I'll cook in no time.

1785
01:40:46,408 --> 01:40:48,376
Hubby, Upma is ready.

1786
01:40:53,816 --> 01:40:55,306
Did you eat? - No.

1787
01:40:55,584 --> 01:40:56,778
I'll eat after you finish eating.

1788
01:40:57,152 --> 01:40:58,619
No way. Sit.

1789
01:40:58,854 --> 01:41:13,463
Volga

1790
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:15,296
Oh No! It's 1 'O'clock.

1791
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:16,797
It's another day.

1792
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,636
We can eat only after taking bath
and offering prayers to god.

1793
01:41:20,843 --> 01:41:23,368
Moreover, today is
an auspicious Friday.

1794
01:41:26,582 --> 01:41:27,344
There's nothing.

1795
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,875
It will be dawn in 2 hours.

1796
01:41:30,352 --> 01:41:31,216
We'll eat then.

1797
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:36,953
Sorry my dear.

1798
01:41:37,192 --> 01:42:28,403
Volga

1799
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,943
If you arrange for
money in 2 days,

1800
01:42:30,579 --> 01:42:31,705
we would be very happy.

1801
01:42:33,482 --> 01:42:35,814
That miser Kotaiah is
better than you.

1802
01:42:36,018 --> 01:42:37,383
You must accept your defeat.

1803
01:42:37,753 --> 01:42:39,311
If people know that you owe me money,

1804
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:40,715
your honour will be at stake.

1805
01:42:41,423 --> 01:42:43,391
If you don't fulfill your
children's little wishes,

1806
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:44,716
how can they love you?

1807
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,921
My son is saved because of you.

1808
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:49,329
First see whether you've slippers,

1809
01:42:49,598 --> 01:42:51,725
before spreading carpet
to the world.

1810
01:42:51,934 --> 01:42:53,731
You saved our family.

1811
01:42:53,936 --> 01:42:55,301
That's why, I called you Zaheer.

1812
01:42:55,604 --> 01:42:57,834
Give us Rs. 5 lakhs each for
having given birth to us.

1813
01:42:58,774 --> 01:43:01,470
Adopt 10 mentally ill children.

1814
01:43:03,545 --> 01:43:04,239
Go man... go.

1815
01:43:04,446 --> 01:43:05,743
Who was your teacher?

1816
01:43:05,948 --> 01:43:07,415
Sorry Raghu, I was wrong.

1817
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,407
You sold appadalu
on the streets.

1818
01:43:09,685 --> 01:43:10,583
What's this father?

1819
01:43:10,786 --> 01:43:12,253
It would be a disgrace
if anyone sees me.

1820
01:43:12,454 --> 01:43:14,251
You saved our home.

1821
01:43:16,792 --> 01:43:21,627
To love or to be loved,
money has nothing to do with it.

1822
01:43:21,964 --> 01:43:23,955
My opinion was buried
in my house itself.

1823
01:43:27,135 --> 01:43:29,933
Your story was wonderful!

1824
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:33,103
After listening to everything,
I've come to a conclusion that,

1825
01:43:33,642 --> 01:43:34,939
you died cheating others.

1826
01:43:35,143 --> 01:43:35,837
It's true.

1827
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:37,939
If you are such a honest man,

1828
01:43:38,146 --> 01:43:40,774
why should we come to take you?

1829
01:43:41,249 --> 01:43:43,513
Yes, I'm not a honest man.

1830
01:43:44,419 --> 01:43:46,444
I was bent by my children's love.

1831
01:43:47,255 --> 01:43:48,745
I borrowed money from
those who trusted me,

1832
01:43:49,491 --> 01:43:51,516
and gave it to my children.

1833
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:54,853
Where are his sons & son-in-law?

1834
01:43:55,063 --> 01:43:55,825
They are not to be seen.

1835
01:43:56,598 --> 01:43:57,963
Son-in-law has gone to Mumbai.

1836
01:43:58,367 --> 01:43:59,698
Sons are in Bangalore.

1837
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:02,131
Oh No! His sons were not with him
in his last minutes.

1838
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,429
Have you informed them?

1839
01:44:03,939 --> 01:44:05,634
I must know about their
whereabouts to inform them.

1840
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:08,474
I've informed my friends
in Bangalore & Mumbai.

1841
01:44:08,677 --> 01:44:10,577
Go & stay with Bharathi.
- Okay.

1842
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:13,909
Where are they?

1843
01:44:14,483 --> 01:44:16,246
They were at home when I died.

1844
01:44:16,585 --> 01:44:18,815
How can they go to
Bangalore or Mumbai?

1845
01:44:19,021 --> 01:44:20,579
You don't know,
what had happened?

1846
01:44:20,789 --> 01:44:21,414
What happened?

1847
01:44:21,623 --> 01:44:24,148
Oh My god! He's killing us.

1848
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:26,293
After you died & before
we came to take you,

1849
01:44:26,495 --> 01:44:27,223
something had happened.

1850
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,431
Father-in-law...

1851
01:44:39,775 --> 01:45:00,528
Volga

1852
01:45:00,595 --> 01:45:01,118
Father...

1853
01:45:01,797 --> 01:45:03,662
Father...

1854
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:11,363
Don't cry.

1855
01:45:12,174 --> 01:45:13,266
If you cry, your mother will wake.

1856
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:15,972
Mother mustn't know this.
- Indra stop!

1857
01:45:17,546 --> 01:45:19,309
No. Don't wake up your mother.

1858
01:45:19,514 --> 01:45:20,139
Brother...!

1859
01:45:20,449 --> 01:45:22,383
If she gets up,
she'll start crying.

1860
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:24,409
And the people around
will come here.

1861
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,082
The people will know about
this in a second,

1862
01:45:26,288 --> 01:45:27,448
and spread like forest fire,
everyone will be here before dawn.

1863
01:45:27,656 --> 01:45:29,453
What will happen if they come here?

1864
01:45:29,658 --> 01:45:31,751
Those who gave money to
our father will also come.

1865
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:34,288
If they demand money and
stop us from taking the body,

1866
01:45:34,496 --> 01:45:35,360
what will be our position?

1867
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:39,091
What shall we do now Shekar?

1868
01:45:39,868 --> 01:45:44,168
Until his last rites are over,
we must be in hiding.

1869
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,300
Indra, stay here & manage.

1870
01:45:46,741 --> 01:45:48,174
What am I to tell them
if they enquire about you?

1871
01:45:48,376 --> 01:45:50,344
Tell them that we've
gone to Bangalore.

1872
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:52,271
We'll be in touch
with you on phone.

1873
01:45:52,981 --> 01:45:53,879
What about our father?

1874
01:45:54,382 --> 01:45:55,440
His funeral...?

1875
01:45:55,817 --> 01:45:58,650
He lived for the welfare of
other people until his last breath.

1876
01:45:58,854 --> 01:46:00,185
They will lit the pyre.

1877
01:46:01,156 --> 01:46:03,818
It's better we put
the body on the bed.

1878
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:33,345
Volga

1879
01:46:33,822 --> 01:46:34,754
That's the present situation.

1880
01:46:34,923 --> 01:46:38,290
After you died, your sons & son-in-law
started abusing you & went away.

1881
01:46:38,493 --> 01:46:40,484
I've never seen such idiots before.

1882
01:46:40,695 --> 01:46:45,098
I never thought they would abscond
leaving their father's body behind.

1883
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:45,823
Yuck!

1884
01:46:46,034 --> 01:46:47,296
Why are you accusing them?

1885
01:46:47,502 --> 01:46:48,799
They haven't done anything wrong.

1886
01:46:49,004 --> 01:46:50,562
Though the penance is broken,
you must get it's fruit.

1887
01:46:50,772 --> 01:46:52,535
He borrowed money for them & died.

1888
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:54,971
If the borrowers take back
the money from them,

1889
01:46:55,177 --> 01:46:57,475
there is no point in he giving
them the money or to his death.

1890
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,306
I'll kill you,
if you talk anymore.

1891
01:46:59,514 --> 01:47:03,883
Sir, why are you fighting
because of my sons?

1892
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:06,519
Stop fighting and
tell me, where are they?

1893
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:08,086
Want to see them?
- Yes.

1894
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:09,382
Let's go & see.

1895
01:47:09,758 --> 01:47:11,749
Oh No!

1896
01:47:12,527 --> 01:47:14,051
Your BP is very high.

1897
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:15,991
What should I do
to control my BP?

1898
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:18,632
It's very simple.
Don't lend money to others.

1899
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:20,232
You said a very nice thing.

1900
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:22,164
I thought you asked for some money.
I won't give you.

1901
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:24,770
So, I'm the first victim.

1902
01:47:25,173 --> 01:47:27,698
I was joking.
I can't live without lending money.

1903
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:29,274
But if you don't get
back the money...?

1904
01:47:29,477 --> 01:47:31,502
Life's gone!
- Worst will be over.

1905
01:47:32,214 --> 01:47:33,681
It's the life of the one
who borrowed money & not mine.

1906
01:47:33,882 --> 01:47:36,407
Sir... - What is it?
- Raghuram has died.

1907
01:47:36,851 --> 01:47:38,478
What have you done, Mr. Raghuram?

1908
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,023
I had given money to someone.

1909
01:47:43,391 --> 01:47:46,053
Once I get it, we'll fix
the marriage. - Okay.

1910
01:47:46,394 --> 01:47:48,191
Your marriage has been fixed, my dear.

1911
01:47:49,631 --> 01:47:51,599
Mastan Bhai, Raghuram has died.

1912
01:47:54,035 --> 01:47:54,592
Excuse me.

1913
01:47:57,105 --> 01:47:59,198
I know that you gave
money to Raghuram.

1914
01:47:59,441 --> 01:48:01,932
His sons would be there.
Ask them.

1915
01:48:02,277 --> 01:48:03,175
Please ask them.

1916
01:48:03,545 --> 01:48:06,412
If you don't, your sister's
marriage will be at stake.

1917
01:48:10,085 --> 01:48:12,610
Are they staying in this lodge?

1918
01:48:14,856 --> 01:48:16,585
Take a good look at them.

1919
01:48:20,328 --> 01:48:22,023
Shekar, why are you so tensed?

1920
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:23,657
Tension...!

1921
01:48:23,865 --> 01:48:25,298
Why should we hide in
a lodge like criminals?

1922
01:48:26,067 --> 01:48:27,364
Yes, we are criminals.

1923
01:48:29,638 --> 01:48:31,469
For us to lead a
luxurious life tomorrow,

1924
01:48:31,773 --> 01:48:33,365
we must be criminals today.

1925
01:48:33,708 --> 01:48:34,538
There's no other choice.

1926
01:48:34,943 --> 01:48:36,911
Yes, your son-in-law is
very honest man.

1927
01:48:37,112 --> 01:48:37,874
He's speaking the truth.

1928
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:38,738
An important news!

1929
01:48:38,947 --> 01:48:44,180
The famous editor Mr. Alamarthi Raghuram
died today morning.

1930
01:48:44,386 --> 01:48:45,546
Brother, look at the TV.

1931
01:48:46,621 --> 01:48:49,988
"He had offered a great service
to the print media

1932
01:48:50,225 --> 01:48:52,819
and worked for people's upliftment".

1933
01:48:53,094 --> 01:48:57,588
Newspaper Owner G. Venkat Rao
paid rich homage to Mr. Raghuramaiah.

1934
01:48:57,866 --> 01:49:02,826
But on this sad occassion his
sons are not in station,

1935
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:10,237
On seeing this message, he hoped that
his sons & son-in-law will come home.

1936
01:49:10,445 --> 01:49:11,070
Did you see?

1937
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:13,179
The Chairman is so much
worried about us.

1938
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:16,179
Yes. He respects
my father very much.

1939
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:19,279
Let's make money
out of his respect.

1940
01:49:24,693 --> 01:49:25,591
Didn't you get me?

1941
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:28,862
We're opening a Chit Fund company
in your father's name.

1942
01:49:30,799 --> 01:49:35,099
Not only that, pay the bribe
and confirm your SI job.

1943
01:49:35,804 --> 01:49:38,272
But we promised our father...

1944
01:49:38,473 --> 01:49:40,668
Our father is no more to question
about the promises we made.

1945
01:49:41,643 --> 01:49:42,302
Why fear unnecessarily?

1946
01:49:44,913 --> 01:49:46,471
How dare you cheat me?

1947
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:47,670
I won't spare you.

1948
01:49:47,882 --> 01:49:49,907
I will kill you.

1949
01:49:53,488 --> 01:49:54,955
Will you kill him?

1950
01:49:56,324 --> 01:49:59,953
Allow me to enter my body once.

1951
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:01,594
I'll teach them a lesson.

1952
01:50:01,796 --> 01:50:03,491
I'll repay my loans.

1953
01:50:03,698 --> 01:50:06,826
His inner voice has started troubling him.
We are in for trouble.

1954
01:50:07,168 --> 01:50:09,966
Once dead will never come back alive.
Please don't trouble us.

1955
01:50:10,171 --> 01:50:10,933
No sir.

1956
01:50:11,139 --> 01:50:13,334
I'll go urgently and
inform my Chairman,

1957
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:15,031
or Mastan Bhai,
or Kotaiah,

1958
01:50:15,243 --> 01:50:17,541
that these people are hiding
in a lodge here only.

1959
01:50:17,746 --> 01:50:19,680
Hey! Stop!

1960
01:50:21,249 --> 01:50:23,581
Yes sir... he's gone sir.

1961
01:50:24,386 --> 01:50:25,182
I don't know sir.

1962
01:50:26,421 --> 01:50:27,149
Yes sir.

1963
01:50:27,956 --> 01:50:29,150
I don't know sir.

1964
01:50:34,362 --> 01:50:35,386
Why are you getting irritated?

1965
01:50:35,597 --> 01:50:38,657
We are getting many calls
asking about Raghuram,

1966
01:50:38,867 --> 01:50:40,391
they are asking his address
and other details.

1967
01:50:42,036 --> 01:50:44,630
So much of response for the
death of an ordinary editor.

1968
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:50,300
Mallaiah... Chairman...
- Chairman is out of station.

1969
01:50:50,512 --> 01:50:51,376
He's in Delhi.

1970
01:50:52,013 --> 01:50:53,480
No staff has come
to office yet.

1971
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:56,275
They have gone pay last respects
to departed soul Raghuram.

1972
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:01,616
You'd helped this man, hadn't you?
- To him only.

1973
01:51:01,823 --> 01:51:05,554
Anyway you are dead now, he's happy
because he needn't repay you.

1974
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:14,625
Volga

1975
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:15,961
Take water sir.

1976
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:19,299
You take water every hour.
Have it.

1977
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:20,405
What's this?

1978
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:22,733
Are we visible to him?

1979
01:51:23,011 --> 01:51:23,739
No... no.

1980
01:51:24,012 --> 01:51:27,470
I couldn't come to pay my last
respects though you'd helped me.

1981
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:28,910
Please forgive sir.

1982
01:51:29,284 --> 01:51:32,651
Helping others with money and
leaving near ones as orphans,

1983
01:51:33,421 --> 01:51:36,413
fearing your family members will
abuse you even after death,

1984
01:51:36,624 --> 01:51:37,488
I didn't go there.

1985
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:40,987
But I'll definitely
repay your loan.

1986
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:43,923
I'll repay it to your heirs...

1987
01:51:45,133 --> 01:51:46,964
You're still alive to repay,

1988
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:49,136
he has died before giving,
that's the difference.

1989
01:51:49,337 --> 01:51:50,235
What's this?

1990
01:51:50,438 --> 01:51:52,167
You wanted to see your funeral,
but sitting comfortably here.

1991
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:53,772
Get up... get up... come.

1992
01:51:53,975 --> 01:51:55,943
What have you done Raghuramaiah?

1993
01:51:56,144 --> 01:51:57,372
I never expected you'll
cheat me like this.

1994
01:51:57,579 --> 01:51:58,443
Sir, I forgot to bring
flower garlands.

1995
01:51:58,646 --> 01:51:59,806
Flower garlands?
Waste of money.

1996
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:02,209
Let's atleast burn incense sticks
at his feet and bow to him.

1997
01:52:02,417 --> 01:52:03,611
Bloody bull!

1998
01:52:03,818 --> 01:52:06,150
We are not here to pay homage.

1999
01:52:06,354 --> 01:52:07,616
We are here to get back my loan.

2000
01:52:08,456 --> 01:52:10,253
Where are his sons and son-in-law?

2001
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:11,390
Go and find them.

2002
01:52:11,526 --> 01:52:19,262
Volga

2003
01:52:19,434 --> 01:52:23,097
Trusting you, I lent you money
without any pledge,

2004
01:52:23,371 --> 01:52:25,464
will you cheat me like this?

2005
01:52:25,707 --> 01:52:27,607
Kotaiah, please forgive me.

2006
01:52:27,809 --> 01:52:29,470
My sons are rascals.

2007
01:52:29,811 --> 01:52:31,369
My son-in-law is a wastrel.

2008
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:34,742
I took loan from you
to settle their lives.

2009
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,445
They are in a lodge
with the money.

2010
01:52:37,652 --> 01:52:39,882
You go there immediately
and take back your money.

2011
01:52:40,154 --> 01:52:45,990
Go... go... Kotaiah... go.

2012
01:52:48,162 --> 01:52:48,753
Why?

2013
01:52:49,497 --> 01:52:52,933
How many times do I've tell
they can't hear you?

2014
01:52:53,201 --> 01:52:54,668
Why haven't they come yet?

2015
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:58,496
I told you to find them,
why are you still here?

2016
01:52:58,706 --> 01:53:00,606
I can find them if they are here,
how can I if they are in Bangalore?

2017
01:53:00,808 --> 01:53:01,740
Bangalore?

2018
01:53:01,943 --> 01:53:04,810
It seems sons and son-in-law have
fled to Bangalore overnight?

2019
01:53:08,116 --> 01:53:09,014
What man?

2020
01:53:09,183 --> 01:53:10,480
Your money has gone
down the drain.

2021
01:53:11,352 --> 01:53:15,721
The world at large abuses
Kotaiah as bad man & miser.

2022
01:53:16,057 --> 01:53:17,752
But such a man had trust in me.

2023
01:53:18,092 --> 01:53:20,083
Kotaiah who never trusts
his own shadow also,

2024
01:53:20,662 --> 01:53:22,493
trusted and lent me money.

2025
01:53:23,197 --> 01:53:25,062
I've cheated such a man.

2026
01:53:25,633 --> 01:53:26,964
Cheated him badly.

2027
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:38,078
Volga

2028
01:53:38,212 --> 01:53:39,804
This is very sad news...

2029
01:53:40,014 --> 01:53:42,642
a news we all must know
and pay homage...

2030
01:53:42,850 --> 01:53:47,617
We know Alamarthi Raghuramaiah
as an editor only.

2031
01:53:47,855 --> 01:53:54,055
We've been flooded with phone
calls knowing about his demise.

2032
01:53:54,262 --> 01:53:56,230
But inquiries about him,

2033
01:53:56,431 --> 01:53:59,491
reveals he's a great humanist
and a great social worker.

2034
01:53:59,734 --> 01:54:02,897
Let's know about this great soul
and pay our homage to him.

2035
01:54:03,104 --> 01:54:05,163
Great Humanist and social worker!

2036
01:54:05,373 --> 01:54:07,568
How can people know
how he had cheated me?

2037
01:54:07,775 --> 01:54:09,242
What? Did he cheat you?

2038
01:54:09,444 --> 01:54:10,877
Cheated... cheated profoundly...

2039
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:13,513
Look, when so many people
are worried about him,

2040
01:54:13,715 --> 01:54:15,876
without telling a word
to any living soul,

2041
01:54:16,084 --> 01:54:17,449
isn't it cheating to go
away on his own?

2042
01:54:17,652 --> 01:54:18,346
What do you say?

2043
01:54:18,553 --> 01:54:20,384
Actually... - What actually?

2044
01:54:20,822 --> 01:54:23,222
I can't tell you anything more
about him. Please leave me.

2045
01:54:27,228 --> 01:54:30,391
Mr. Raghuram, don't think
you've escaped with death.

2046
01:54:30,865 --> 01:54:33,129
I would rather kill the others
and will get back my money.

2047
01:54:33,334 --> 01:54:35,199
Let your sons come.
I'm waiting for them.

2048
01:54:35,403 --> 01:54:36,563
Hey you mad fellow!

2049
01:54:36,804 --> 01:54:41,002
Even if they come here, you won't
be able to get back your money.

2050
01:54:41,242 --> 01:54:43,107
His sons are worse than you.

2051
01:54:43,311 --> 01:54:44,539
Mind your words.

2052
01:54:44,746 --> 01:54:45,940
Who're you to abuse my sons?

2053
01:54:46,147 --> 01:54:49,412
Wow! You're getting angry!

2054
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:53,116
You were scolding your sons a while ago
and now you're supporting them.

2055
01:54:53,287 --> 01:54:57,724
You died for your children
to be happy.

2056
01:54:57,925 --> 01:55:00,758
Don't kill me with your words.

2057
01:55:00,962 --> 01:55:03,726
Our job is to torture you.

2058
01:55:03,931 --> 01:55:06,229
How can we step away
from our duty?

2059
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:12,504
We know Mr. Alamarthi Raghuram
as a newspaper editor.

2060
01:55:12,707 --> 01:55:14,470
He's such a great humanist.

2061
01:55:14,676 --> 01:55:19,978
He donates half of his earnings to
society and the rest to his family.

2062
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:23,947
He gave solutions to people
through his letters.

2063
01:55:24,152 --> 01:55:29,021
Even our Chief minister has
condoled his death.

2064
01:55:29,357 --> 01:55:33,123
Let's meet a few people,
who'll tell about his greatness.

2065
01:55:42,804 --> 01:55:47,832
Forgive us for troubling
you at this hour.

2066
01:55:48,876 --> 01:55:52,903
Mr. Raghuram has donated his eyes
to our organization after his death.

2067
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:02,520
If you please co-operate
with us...

2068
01:56:02,724 --> 01:56:20,598
Volga

2069
01:56:20,875 --> 01:56:22,638
If you please go out...

2070
01:56:30,485 --> 01:56:33,750
Of all the organs eyes are very
important so said our elders.

2071
01:56:34,288 --> 01:56:37,985
By donating your eyes,
your good deeds have doubled.

2072
01:56:38,893 --> 01:56:40,292
This is a sin,
not a good deed.

2073
01:56:40,495 --> 01:56:42,224
Why did you say that?

2074
01:56:42,597 --> 01:56:44,462
How can you say
donating eyes is a sin?

2075
01:56:44,732 --> 01:56:49,135
He wants his eyes to live in
this world even after his death.

2076
01:56:49,337 --> 01:56:50,736
That's greed.
Isn't greed a sin?

2077
01:56:50,938 --> 01:56:52,906
To hell with your ideals!

2078
01:56:53,441 --> 01:57:00,176
Donating eyes & giving vision to others
after one's death is a noble.

2079
01:57:05,186 --> 01:57:06,346
Get me that dust bin.

2080
01:57:15,963 --> 01:57:17,191
This isn't a natural death.

2081
01:57:18,566 --> 01:57:19,794
His eyes are of no use.

2082
01:57:20,134 --> 01:57:21,624
It looks like a suicide note.

2083
01:57:22,503 --> 01:57:23,470
Greetings to everyone.

2084
01:57:23,671 --> 01:57:27,573
This letter is written
by a man of failures.

2085
01:57:28,009 --> 01:57:32,776
As a husband to a wife,
I couldn't make her understand me.

2086
01:57:33,748 --> 01:57:38,276
As a father, I couldn't
make my children understand life.

2087
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:43,848
Fearing that my children
will cheat the public,

2088
01:57:44,425 --> 01:57:46,484
I borrowed money from those
who had trust in me.

2089
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:49,162
Knowing that I won't be
able to repay the money,

2090
01:57:49,664 --> 01:57:50,926
and with no other choice left,

2091
01:57:51,265 --> 01:57:55,361
I'm running away from
this world as a cheat.

2092
01:57:56,838 --> 01:58:00,774
As a citizen, I lost the right
to live on this earth,

2093
01:58:01,008 --> 01:58:02,999
and I'm dying as
a man of failure.

2094
01:58:03,311 --> 01:58:08,146
Yours, don't know
what I'm to whom, a loser.

2095
01:58:12,954 --> 01:58:14,979
Why am I writing this letter?

2096
01:58:17,325 --> 01:58:19,623
Though the doctors praised
your noble deed,

2097
01:58:19,827 --> 01:58:21,886
they have brought the secret
about your death to light.

2098
01:58:22,096 --> 01:58:23,927
So, you committed suicide!

2099
01:58:24,232 --> 01:58:26,359
Suicide is a very big sin!

2100
01:58:26,567 --> 01:58:28,398
You'll definitely go to hell.

2101
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:31,504
He always used to help others
and never asked help from others.

2102
01:58:31,706 --> 01:58:34,903
Poor man! I wonder what made
him to commit suicide.

2103
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:35,837
Suicide!

2104
01:58:36,043 --> 01:58:37,203
Hubby...

2105
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:55,092
Volga

2106
01:58:55,196 --> 01:58:57,357
What happened? - Nothing.

2107
01:58:58,065 --> 01:58:59,589
It's been very long
since he died.

2108
01:58:59,901 --> 01:59:02,995
His Eyes have become useless.
That's why we are worried.

2109
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,230
Please go out.

2110
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:12,975
By telling everyone that he
has committed suicide,

2111
01:59:13,514 --> 01:59:16,381
I don't want to defame him.

2112
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,544
Oh no! You need not tell me that.

2113
01:59:22,423 --> 01:59:23,549
Let's go.
- Okay sir.

2114
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,089
What have you done?

2115
01:59:33,301 --> 01:59:34,063
See for yourselves!

2116
01:59:34,602 --> 01:59:37,594
Look how much they love me.

2117
01:59:38,272 --> 01:59:40,331
You ridiculed me saying that
my wife was eating Upma.

2118
01:59:40,608 --> 01:59:42,405
That was the last dish I touched.

2119
01:59:42,543 --> 01:59:56,480
Volga

2120
02:00:16,978 --> 02:00:18,275
She ate because she
remembered this incident.

2121
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:21,039
She ate not because she was hungry
or not that she doesn't love me.

2122
02:00:21,615 --> 02:00:24,982
Kotaiah... What Kotaiah!
I'm only guarding the body.

2123
02:00:25,319 --> 02:00:26,843
We waited till now for
his sons return.

2124
02:00:27,054 --> 02:00:27,884
But they haven't come yet.

2125
02:00:28,089 --> 02:00:29,056
Don't know what to do?

2126
02:00:29,256 --> 02:00:30,120
If you don't know what to do,

2127
02:00:30,324 --> 02:00:31,450
Give company to the body

2128
02:00:31,826 --> 02:00:34,124
We've to wait till his sons return.

2129
02:00:34,328 --> 02:00:35,056
They won't come.

2130
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:38,628
How come you're so sure?

2131
02:00:38,833 --> 02:00:40,164
We don't know where they are?

2132
02:00:41,202 --> 02:00:42,965
They don't know about
their father's death.

2133
02:00:43,504 --> 02:00:44,300
How will they come?

2134
02:00:44,505 --> 02:00:47,531
Without his sons!
What a pity!

2135
02:00:47,742 --> 02:00:48,731
Never mind if his sons
are not here.

2136
02:00:49,176 --> 02:00:50,609
We are also like his sons.

2137
02:00:51,012 --> 02:00:53,071
We'll do the last rites.

2138
02:00:56,784 --> 02:00:58,979
Your Rs. 5 lakhs are gone.

2139
02:00:59,186 --> 02:00:59,880
Who knows?

2140
02:01:00,688 --> 02:01:03,885
The horse can lie
or can get up?

2141
02:01:04,692 --> 02:01:07,160
His sons might come and
I might get back my money.

2142
02:01:08,195 --> 02:01:09,321
Let's see.

2143
02:01:10,231 --> 02:01:14,827
Mastan Bhai, you didn't want others to
know I had borrowed money from you.

2144
02:01:15,202 --> 02:01:16,692
How am I going to repay you?

2145
02:01:17,371 --> 02:01:19,066
I dragged you into trouble.

2146
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,336
I cheated you.

2147
02:01:21,208 --> 02:01:23,733
I feel ashamed to
seek your forgiveness.

2148
02:01:23,978 --> 02:01:25,502
I'm ashamed of myself.

2149
02:01:25,713 --> 02:01:28,409
You're making me a debtor.

2150
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,414
We come to this earth alone...

2151
02:02:08,923 --> 02:02:11,687
We go from this earth alone...

2152
02:02:12,093 --> 02:02:17,895
Our fate makes us enact
a play in between...

2153
02:02:18,432 --> 02:02:30,469
The bonds & relationships never
come with us till the end...

2154
02:02:31,112 --> 02:02:33,740
Death is inevitable...

2155
02:02:34,248 --> 02:02:36,842
Fame will stay on forever...

2156
02:02:37,384 --> 02:02:46,190
Your body & your honour
are being borne...

2157
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:52,198
...by those 4 people.

2158
02:02:52,733 --> 02:03:03,007
...by those 4 people.

2159
02:03:03,477 --> 02:03:05,445
I'm no way related to him.

2160
02:03:06,313 --> 02:03:09,544
He took me to Jaipur and
gave me a new wooden leg.

2161
02:03:09,817 --> 02:03:11,785
He's really a god.

2162
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:13,878
Forgive me daddy.

2163
02:03:17,491 --> 02:03:18,753
I want see him.
- Stop.

2164
02:03:19,426 --> 02:03:21,018
Sit down. Where will you go?

2165
02:03:22,029 --> 02:03:23,758
Sit down.
- No, I must go.

2166
02:03:24,064 --> 02:03:25,725
I told you to sit.
- We'll get caught if we go out.

2167
02:03:26,033 --> 02:03:27,398
Money lenders won't
be kind to us.

2168
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:28,768
I don't want this money.

2169
02:03:29,303 --> 02:03:30,167
I want to see daddy.

2170
02:03:30,371 --> 02:03:31,395
Shut up. Where will you go?

2171
02:03:31,605 --> 02:03:32,594
It's dangerous if he
stays here anymore.

2172
02:03:32,806 --> 02:03:34,103
We must change our hideout.

2173
02:03:34,308 --> 02:03:36,105
Call the travels.
I'll handle him.

2174
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:37,608
I say sit.

2175
02:03:38,145 --> 02:03:39,544
Don't talk. Shut up.

2176
02:03:39,813 --> 02:03:41,178
How long will it take
to reach Vijayawada?

2177
02:03:41,482 --> 02:03:43,211
If we don't stop in between,
we can reach there in 7 hours.

2178
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:44,483
Okay, go fast.

2179
02:03:49,156 --> 02:03:51,556
Hubby, something really
bad has happened.

2180
02:03:52,326 --> 02:03:53,691
Father didn't die naturally.

2181
02:03:54,595 --> 02:03:55,892
He had committed suicide.

2182
02:03:56,664 --> 02:03:57,995
Come home immediately.

2183
02:04:03,938 --> 02:04:06,668
Though you knew where they were,
you were lying.

2184
02:04:08,342 --> 02:04:08,865
Yuck!

2185
02:04:11,345 --> 02:04:13,643
By supporting sinners like you,

2186
02:04:14,848 --> 02:04:17,316
I lost my loving husband.

2187
02:04:18,786 --> 02:04:25,123
Please forgive me...

2188
02:04:25,326 --> 02:04:26,918
I really made you cry, didn't I?

2189
02:04:27,661 --> 02:04:28,457
But I'm sorry.

2190
02:04:32,032 --> 02:04:33,966
From tomorrow, I'll make your cry.

2191
02:04:35,202 --> 02:04:35,896
Impossible.

2192
02:04:38,105 --> 02:04:41,040
When you said that you'll make me
cry from tomorrow,

2193
02:04:41,709 --> 02:04:43,609
I thought you were joking.

2194
02:04:44,878 --> 02:04:49,542
But I never thought that
you'll kill yourself.

2195
02:04:53,053 --> 02:04:55,613
It's my mistake.
You must forgive me.

2196
02:04:56,223 --> 02:04:57,349
In trying to convince
me and children,

2197
02:04:57,891 --> 02:05:02,089
I couldn't understand how badly
you were hurt between us.

2198
02:05:03,897 --> 02:05:07,731
Even at the times of hardship,

2199
02:05:07,935 --> 02:05:10,130
I was so selfish that I didn't know
that you'll be left alone.

2200
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:15,770
Please forgive me...

2201
02:06:01,188 --> 02:06:03,452
So many people in a
funeral procession. Who has died?

2202
02:06:03,857 --> 02:06:05,119
Social activist Mr. Raghuram.

2203
02:06:05,326 --> 02:06:05,951
Mr. Raghuram!

2204
02:06:06,193 --> 02:06:07,490
Sir, I'll carry his body
and will be back soon.

2205
02:06:07,695 --> 02:06:08,389
What are you doing?

2206
02:06:08,595 --> 02:06:10,460
If you go, how will you
take us to Vijayawada.

2207
02:06:11,832 --> 02:06:14,926
I know him very well.
I must lucky to carry his body.

2208
02:06:15,336 --> 02:06:17,236
Wait in the car or
else take another car.

2209
02:06:17,504 --> 02:06:18,471
From where did you get him?

2210
02:06:22,276 --> 02:06:24,938
Chinna, listen to me.
- Chinna stop.

2211
02:06:26,447 --> 02:06:28,415
So now you remember me.

2212
02:06:28,849 --> 02:06:30,976
Stop. You shouldn't touch me.

2213
02:06:35,356 --> 02:06:37,221
There they are, Raghuram's sons.

2214
02:06:37,624 --> 02:06:39,023
You've come at the right time.

2215
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:40,085
Get down fast.

2216
02:06:41,528 --> 02:06:41,994
Come...

2217
02:07:28,742 --> 02:07:31,370
When 4 people praised you...

2218
02:07:31,945 --> 02:07:34,778
when 4 people abused you...

2219
02:07:35,082 --> 02:07:41,180
you carried your principles
like a cross...

2220
02:07:41,422 --> 02:07:47,088
You wanted the well being
of people in society...

2221
02:07:47,761 --> 02:07:53,393
you showed them the
path of righteousness...

2222
02:07:53,834 --> 02:07:56,632
The 4 has turned into 10...

2223
02:07:57,104 --> 02:07:59,834
The 10 has turned
into 100s & 1000s...

2224
02:08:00,107 --> 02:08:09,743
They are following you
as your disciples...

2225
02:08:12,453 --> 02:08:25,594
...those 4 people...

2226
02:08:45,152 --> 02:08:47,279
We thought he died
like an orphan.

2227
02:08:47,488 --> 02:08:51,288
But so many people have come
to his funeral procession.

2228
02:08:51,492 --> 02:08:52,618
Why will they not come?

2229
02:08:52,826 --> 02:08:55,294
His death news was
telecast on TV.

2230
02:08:59,333 --> 02:09:02,461
Subrahmanyam, I don't like him
to perform my last rites.

2231
02:09:02,669 --> 02:09:04,967
Stop him... please stop him.

2232
02:09:07,508 --> 02:09:08,805
Did you see?

2233
02:09:09,009 --> 02:09:11,637
Even now, he is worried about
money & not about me.

2234
02:09:11,845 --> 02:09:14,313
I don't like him to
lit pyre to my body.

2235
02:09:14,515 --> 02:09:16,983
Subrahmanyam, stop him.
He is an idiot.

2236
02:09:17,184 --> 02:09:19,311
Stop it.

2237
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:21,647
I don't like you to
perform my last rites.

2238
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:31,320
Mastan Bhai, Kotaiah...
at least you stop him.

2239
02:09:31,565 --> 02:09:33,829
Your money is in that bag.

2240
02:09:34,034 --> 02:09:35,661
Go and take it.
But stop him.

2241
02:09:36,904 --> 02:09:39,498
How many times to tell him
that they will not hear him?

2242
02:09:39,706 --> 02:09:42,504
Until his head breaks into pieces,
we have to face this.

2243
02:09:49,716 --> 02:09:53,516
Lit pyre & save him
from going to hell.

2244
02:09:54,388 --> 02:09:58,518
Hey, you don't have to save me
from going to the hell.

2245
02:09:58,725 --> 02:10:00,852
Return their money,
it's enough.

2246
02:10:01,728 --> 02:10:04,196
Betrayal is the biggest sin.

2247
02:10:04,398 --> 02:10:07,367
By committing that sin,
I'm in hell already.

2248
02:10:07,568 --> 02:10:10,196
Return their money.

2249
02:10:10,404 --> 02:10:12,269
You don't have to free me from hell.

2250
02:10:12,539 --> 02:10:13,301
Stop!

2251
02:10:17,144 --> 02:10:19,044
By litting pyre,
do you think you can escape?

2252
02:10:19,246 --> 02:10:21,373
Your father borrowed
Rs. 5 lakhs from me.

2253
02:10:21,582 --> 02:10:23,209
He borrowed the money
yesterday & died.

2254
02:10:23,417 --> 02:10:24,213
Who'll repay the money?

2255
02:10:24,418 --> 02:10:25,544
The son who lit's the pyre.

2256
02:10:25,752 --> 02:10:28,550
Bingo! You've caught him
by his neck.

2257
02:10:28,755 --> 02:10:31,189
Don't leave him until he
returns the money. Go ahead.

2258
02:10:31,425 --> 02:10:34,394
You're looking around
as if you are deaf.

2259
02:10:34,728 --> 02:10:35,490
He who studies people,

2260
02:10:35,729 --> 02:10:37,629
will become a philosopher
or a business man,

2261
02:10:37,798 --> 02:10:38,890
I'm a business man.

2262
02:10:39,066 --> 02:10:40,590
But do you know what kind
of a business man I'm.

2263
02:10:40,734 --> 02:10:43,999
I'm a ruthless business man
even to a widow.

2264
02:10:44,371 --> 02:10:45,702
Money is important to me.

2265
02:10:45,939 --> 02:10:48,032
Give me my money and
lit pyre to your father's body.

2266
02:10:48,308 --> 02:10:50,401
Kotaiah, do you know
what you're doing?

2267
02:10:50,611 --> 02:10:53,409
What should I know?
I'm not picking anyone's pocket.

2268
02:10:53,614 --> 02:10:55,582
I'm getting back my money.

2269
02:10:55,782 --> 02:10:57,249
It's between me & the dead body.

2270
02:10:57,451 --> 02:10:58,748
Who are you to interfere?
Move away.

2271
02:10:59,786 --> 02:11:02,584
Give me money & lit pyre
to your father's body.

2272
02:11:06,293 --> 02:11:08,761
Why are you looking there?
I'm here.

2273
02:11:08,962 --> 02:11:10,088
Repay the money.

2274
02:11:10,297 --> 02:11:11,594
Why should I repay the
loan he had taken?

2275
02:11:12,132 --> 02:11:14,430
You won't give money
without pledging anything.

2276
02:11:14,635 --> 02:11:16,262
You keep what my father
had pledged with you.

2277
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:18,768
Now he has come
to the point.

2278
02:11:18,972 --> 02:11:23,102
I'm waiting to take
what he had pledged.

2279
02:11:23,310 --> 02:11:25,278
Go ahead. Keep it with you.
- Then why to wait?

2280
02:11:25,479 --> 02:11:27,606
Cut your father's head
and give me.

2281
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:36,285
Kotaiah, what are you talking?
- I didn't say this.

2282
02:11:36,657 --> 02:11:38,454
I want him to cut his head
and give me.

2283
02:11:38,659 --> 02:11:42,425
Because he promised me that he'll
repay the loan pledging his head.

2284
02:11:45,832 --> 02:11:50,132
Pledging his head means
pledging his honour.

2285
02:11:50,337 --> 02:11:53,966
Infact it's not his head.

2286
02:11:54,174 --> 02:11:58,634
I didn't know that.
He also did the same.

2287
02:11:58,845 --> 02:12:00,972
He pledged his honour in my hands.

2288
02:12:01,181 --> 02:12:02,978
Why should I talk to you all?

2289
02:12:03,183 --> 02:12:05,151
Listen everyone,

2290
02:12:05,352 --> 02:12:07,650
If he wants his head,
my money must be returned.

2291
02:12:07,854 --> 02:12:09,651
Kotaiah, please move away.

2292
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,982
Settle the accounts later.

2293
02:12:11,191 --> 02:12:12,818
There will be nothing left later.

2294
02:12:13,026 --> 02:12:14,653
His ash will be left
to apply on our faces.

2295
02:12:14,861 --> 02:12:18,524
Repay my money or
burn me along with him.

2296
02:12:18,765 --> 02:12:22,496
He won't listen to us,
he is a flesh eating vulture.

2297
02:12:22,703 --> 02:12:25,001
Why still talk to him?
Throw him out.

2298
02:12:25,539 --> 02:12:26,335
Stop.

2299
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:29,338
If you step forward,
I'll burn myself.

2300
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:34,170
I really don't care
about my life.

2301
02:12:34,381 --> 02:12:37,680
As long as the man lives,
money gives power to life.

2302
02:12:37,884 --> 02:12:40,182
It's money which made
a man to cheat.

2303
02:12:40,387 --> 02:12:43,356
That's why I like money
...very much.

2304
02:12:43,557 --> 02:12:45,354
Kotaiah, it's enough.

2305
02:12:45,559 --> 02:12:47,026
Tell me where to sign the papers.

2306
02:12:47,227 --> 02:12:48,854
I'll sign & repay your money.
Give that to me.

2307
02:12:49,062 --> 02:12:50,529
What will you repay?

2308
02:12:50,731 --> 02:12:52,358
For the money you took 3 years back,

2309
02:12:52,566 --> 02:12:55,194
you haven't repaid a penny.
Will you repay 5 lakhs?

2310
02:12:55,402 --> 02:12:56,027
Get lost.

2311
02:12:56,403 --> 02:12:57,870
Shekar, don't delay.

2312
02:12:58,071 --> 02:13:00,369
Give me my money.
Lit pyre to your father's body.

2313
02:13:00,574 --> 02:13:01,199
I won't give.

2314
02:13:01,408 --> 02:13:03,035
Because my principles are
very similar to yours.

2315
02:13:03,243 --> 02:13:05,211
I give importance to money
than anyone's life.

2316
02:13:05,412 --> 02:13:08,040
If I don't light pyre,
or if you burn yourself,

2317
02:13:08,248 --> 02:13:09,875
nothing bothers me.
Do as you like.

2318
02:13:10,083 --> 02:13:10,708
Brother...

2319
02:13:16,923 --> 02:13:19,892
It's wrong my boy. Don't leave your
father's body this way.

2320
02:13:20,093 --> 02:13:21,560
Wait. I'll talk to him.

2321
02:13:22,395 --> 02:13:27,458
Kotaiah, take my gold bangles.
I'll repay the loan amount.

2322
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:32,737
You only know the value of money
and not humans, sinner!

2323
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:33,765
Take it.

2324
02:13:35,275 --> 02:13:38,506
He saved my family.
Please don't insult him.

2325
02:13:38,712 --> 02:13:40,839
I'll even sell my shop
to repay your loan.

2326
02:13:41,047 --> 02:13:42,878
Allow the proceedings
to continue.

2327
02:13:44,217 --> 02:13:45,343
He's like my father.

2328
02:13:45,585 --> 02:13:47,985
Forget about his sons.
I'll repay his loan.

2329
02:13:48,922 --> 02:13:54,258
Kotaiah, just like them, I'll also repay
the loan by serving you. Move away.

2330
02:13:54,494 --> 02:13:57,520
Kotaiah, take my gold chain.

2331
02:13:57,731 --> 02:13:58,698
Please go.

2332
02:13:59,299 --> 02:14:01,324
Take my ring.

2333
02:14:05,071 --> 02:14:06,936
Whatever you want to donate,
put them in this plate.

2334
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:09,404
Don't throw them down. Stop.

2335
02:14:18,652 --> 02:14:20,415
To hell with you!

2336
02:14:22,789 --> 02:14:23,448
Take it.

2337
02:14:23,824 --> 02:14:24,620
Here is the blank cheque.

2338
02:14:25,358 --> 02:14:26,552
Fill it with any amount you want.

2339
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,455
Do you know about Mr. Raghuram?

2340
02:14:30,230 --> 02:14:33,165
I don't have to know
about Mr. Raghuram.

2341
02:14:33,667 --> 02:14:38,536
His son who said that he is no way
connected to his father's debts,

2342
02:14:38,738 --> 02:14:40,365
tell what Raghuram is to his son.

2343
02:14:41,608 --> 02:14:44,600
I don't give a penny
without pledging anything.

2344
02:14:45,212 --> 02:14:49,979
Do you know why I gave money to that
noble man without pledging anything?

2345
02:14:51,451 --> 02:14:59,051
In this world, I love this
noble man more than money.

2346
02:14:59,893 --> 02:15:01,258
Hey...

2347
02:15:02,796 --> 02:15:09,395
The day he came to my house,
accepted his defeat & asked money,

2348
02:15:09,603 --> 02:15:13,664
I had decided to forfeit
my money the day I gave him.

2349
02:15:13,874 --> 02:15:19,471
But knowing that he was defeated
by sinners like you, I came to his rescue.

2350
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:25,640
You were all ready to sacrifice
anything for this noble man.

2351
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:32,149
But as his son, he was ready to
go away without litting pyre,

2352
02:15:32,759 --> 02:15:36,957
and leaving this noble man's
body to the dogs.

2353
02:15:38,198 --> 02:15:41,395
Though he died,
I didn't want him to lose,

2354
02:15:41,601 --> 02:15:44,570
and I wanted a change
in these sinners.

2355
02:15:44,771 --> 02:15:48,502
That's why I did all this.
Please forgive me.

2356
02:15:48,708 --> 02:15:55,705
I'm money minded
but not a bad man.

2357
02:15:56,082 --> 02:15:57,344
Please try to understand me.

2358
02:15:58,084 --> 02:15:59,210
Please forgive me.

2359
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:04,386
Take this cheque too & enjoy.

2360
02:16:04,624 --> 02:16:08,253
Uncle, please forgive me.

2361
02:16:16,102 --> 02:16:21,404
When you were alive,
we never understood your greatness.

2362
02:16:22,208 --> 02:16:24,904
Father, please forgive me.

2363
02:16:25,111 --> 02:16:26,078
Take this, uncle.

2364
02:16:26,279 --> 02:16:30,909
We don't need this money.
We only need our father.

2365
02:16:31,451 --> 02:16:34,943
We'll stand on our legs.
We don't need this money.

2366
02:16:35,822 --> 02:16:37,881
Whoever has given money
to my father,

2367
02:16:38,224 --> 02:16:41,318
please come and
take back your money.

2368
02:16:41,528 --> 02:16:42,654
We don't need money.

2369
02:16:42,862 --> 02:16:44,557
They won't come and take.

2370
02:16:44,764 --> 02:16:47,255
If they take back the money, it means
they don't respect your father.

2371
02:16:47,467 --> 02:16:48,627
Carry on with the proceedings.

2372
02:16:52,572 --> 02:16:55,507
No Shekar, you shouldn't
lit the pyre.

2373
02:16:55,709 --> 02:17:00,942
No. You're not worthy
to lit the pyre.

2374
02:17:02,515 --> 02:17:08,249
I was wrong in stopping him in every
attempt he made to correct them.

2375
02:17:09,589 --> 02:17:11,784
Since we ourselves killed
a man who cared for us,

2376
02:17:12,926 --> 02:17:15,326
we don't have the right
to lit his pyre.

2377
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:19,030
Sir...

2378
02:17:20,333 --> 02:17:25,066
He loved his family and
you all equally.

2379
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,066
His family killed him.

2380
02:17:31,444 --> 02:17:35,380
But you all saved his honour.

2381
02:17:37,083 --> 02:17:42,453
Only you have the right
to lit his pyre.

2382
02:17:44,324 --> 02:17:46,292
For his soul to rest in peace,

2383
02:17:47,127 --> 02:17:48,492
you all must lit his pyre.

2384
02:17:50,163 --> 02:17:52,358
Please don't say no.

2385
02:17:57,070 --> 02:18:04,272
Those 4 people.

2386
02:18:04,477 --> 02:18:08,607
I won...

2387
02:18:09,015 --> 02:18:11,142
They made me victorious.

2388
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:16,886
I believed that this world runs
on love & not on money.

2389
02:18:17,223 --> 02:18:20,681
Those 4 people have made
my belief victorious.

2390
02:18:25,398 --> 02:18:26,023
You...?

2391
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:28,496
Poor fellow!

2392
02:18:28,968 --> 02:18:30,833
Till now you were in
neck deep sorrows.

2393
02:18:31,671 --> 02:18:33,332
Sorrows means hell.

2394
02:18:34,007 --> 02:18:37,499
That's why we appeared
like hell boys to you.

2395
02:18:39,112 --> 02:18:40,841
Now that you're happy,

2396
02:18:41,047 --> 02:18:42,344
Happiness means heaven.

2397
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:45,074
That's why we appear like
angels to you.

2398
02:18:45,418 --> 02:18:46,442
Come, let's go.

2399
02:18:46,786 --> 02:18:48,754
When we were born,
we bring nothing to this world.

2400
02:18:49,522 --> 02:18:51,786
People say that we don't take
anything with us when we die.

2401
02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:56,859
But I'm taking your love and
affection with me.

2402
02:18:57,564 --> 02:19:00,124
Farewell to our friend...

2403
02:19:00,467 --> 02:19:03,368
Farewell to our dear...

2404
02:19:03,570 --> 02:19:09,236
You live in our hearts...

2405
02:19:09,909 --> 02:19:12,673
Soul is reality...

2406
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:15,746
Life is truth...

2407
02:19:16,149 --> 02:19:21,815
Your deeds live in
this world forever...

2408
02:19:22,422 --> 02:19:25,323
While living be
helpful to others...

2409
02:19:25,692 --> 02:19:28,490
After death become
a memory of solace...

2410
02:19:28,928 --> 02:19:38,132
Your love and affection
is spread by...

2411
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:54,044
...those 4 people...
