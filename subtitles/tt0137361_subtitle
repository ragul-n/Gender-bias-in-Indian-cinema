2
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:34,591
Good afternoon.
This is Eastern Exporters.

3
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,912
Oh no, that's all right, Mr Sharma.
One moment.

4
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:48,031
You're giggling away!
What's she saying?

5
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,351
She has called him home.
- Really? Give it to me

6
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,077
I'll be there in half an hour.
- No, sooner.

7
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,238
In 20 minutes then?
- No. 15 minutes.

8
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,111
All right.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

9
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,432
Do you think I like being
away from you?

10
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:19,712
Sometimes I feel like giving up
everything to sit before you.

11
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,591
To just keep looking at you.

12
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,540
You're back, Mr Kashinath?
- At the moment...

13
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:29,837
the exporter's dealing only in love.
- What does that mean?

14
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,111
It's the telephone. By getting
married at the age of 40...

15
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,077
Mr Sharma has turned the office
into a bridal party.

16
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,911
Out of every hour, he spends
two hours on the phone.

17
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,517
Two hours in an hour?
What arithmetic is that...?

18
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,678
Moron! When could you ever use
arithmetic in love?

19
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,551
Does it appear from the boss's face
that he could be such a romantic man?

20
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,391
God!
- What happened?

21
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,071
Damn it! The line
has gone dead.

22
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,791
<i>Sway gently...</i>

23
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,511
<i>O yearning heart...</i>

24
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,551
<i>he shall arrive.</i>

25
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,751
<i>Do not torment
me like this...</i>

26
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,631
<i>he shall arrive soon.</i>

27
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,632
<i>The air bears his scent.</i>

28
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,832
<i>I can hear his footsteps.</i>

29
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:45,152
<i>Let me dress up for him..</i>

30
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,031
<i>For he shall arrive soon.</i>

31
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>Sway gently...</i>

32
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,751
<i>O yearning heart...</i>

33
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,151
<i>he shall arrive.</i>

34
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,754
You're back.
- Sing.

35
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:10,956
Go & freshen up. Don't you remember?
We're attending a party today.

36
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,875
There's a lot of time for that.
But a song mustn't remain incomplete.

37
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,311
Please sing.

38
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:25,952
I feel sad that I didn't
learn to sing better.

39
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,834
What you have learnt
is enough for me.

40
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:34,591
When a man gets more than he expects,
he thinks he's not worthy of it.

41
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,431
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

42
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,351
Where?

43
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,671
Not even learnt...
you stole them.

44
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,071
From my poems.

45
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:55,231
<i>Sway gently...</i>

46
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,157
<i>O yearning heart...</i>

47
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:00,511
<i>he shall arrive.</i>

48
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:08,191
<i>Do not torment
me like this...</i>

49
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,071
<i>he shall arrive soon.</i>

50
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:35,071
<i>His shadows have begun
to touch me.</i>

51
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:42,272
<i>In the heart rings
the bridal shehnai.</i>

52
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:58,112
<i>In my heart sings love...</i>

53
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:00,511
<i>for he shall arrive soon.</i>

54
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,831
<i>Sway gently...</i>

55
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,231
<i>O yearning heart...</i>

56
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:10,111
<i>he shall arrive.</i>

57
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:33,152
<i>I shall sulk
and torment him.</i>

58
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:39,872
<i>When he placates me,
I will be placated.</i>

59
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:56,076
<i>When can one help the feelings
of the heart at a time like this...?</i>

60
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,594
<i>He shall arrive soon.</i>

61
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,911
<i>Sway gently...</i>

62
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:05,311
<i>O yearning heart...</i>

63
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>he shall arrive.</i>

64
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:12,031
<i>Do not torment
me like this...</i>

65
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,431
<i>he shall arrive soon.</i>

66
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,077
I'm ready.

67
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:39,871
To eat?
- Hush! Shameless!

68
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,675
Listen... what if we don't go?

69
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:47,551
What are you saying! If we don't go,
we'll earn a bad name.

70
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,872
What will they think?
- At the most, they'll laugh at us.

71
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:56,429
They'll tease that since we're newly
married, we like being with each other.

72
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,598
No, you'll have to come!

73
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:02,911
Please hook my blouse.

74
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,591
You should behave like you
used to before marriage.

75
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:13,471
How is that possible?
- Why is it not possible?

76
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,351
I'm hooked.

77
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:19,231
Now I cannot be like I was
before even if I want to.

78
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:23,597
Earlier, I used to say that
man makes the world go round.

79
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,951
What have women
got to do in it?

80
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,391
And now?

81
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,235
Now I think men are useless.

82
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:37,580
Do you know, earlier,
club and parties were my life.

83
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,589
Now I fear crowds.

84
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:44,198
Why?
- I lose you in a crowd.

85
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:48,031
I know! They are all
excuses of your laziness.

86
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,431
Now come like a good man.
Come on!

87
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,117
Yes, madam?
- Here are the keys.

88
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,471
Take care of the house.
We'll be back late.

89
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,311
And yes, shut the windows,
it may rain.

90
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,751
Alright.

91
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,671
Let's go.

92
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:54,451
Purse... handkerchief...

93
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:01,172
goggles... pen...
and cigarettes.

94
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,051
Don't smoke more than four.

95
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
Honestly Aruna,
if it wasn't for you.

96
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:11,740
Enough now! Go, or you'll
get late for office.

97
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:20,853
Listen... are you
forgetting something?

98
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,611
No.
- Think again.

99
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,251
Go... go!

100
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,291
Hello, Sharma here.

101
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:50,177
You...?
- Didn't recognise me?

102
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:54,452
I'm Shanta.
Now please don't ask who Shanta.

103
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,331
What are you talking!
How can I forget you?

104
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,691
I can see your
image before my eyes.

105
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,571
Only, your voice
is a little thick.

106
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:06,977
Probably been fighting with
your husband all night.

107
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:11,616
See! I am very fortunate.
I am not married yet.

108
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,857
I know now for sure
that you haven't recognised me.

109
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:18,459
I am Aruna's friend, Shanta.
- Oh yes! Shanta.

110
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:24,417
Tell me, what are you so proud of?
Everyone gets married.

111
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:28,769
And everyone becomes
a father too.

112
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,977
You are badly mistaken.

113
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:34,529
Neither have I become proud,
nor am I going to be a father.

114
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,737
Trying to hide?
- Not at all.

115
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:39,091
You are shooting in the dark.

116
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,113
Lay a bet.
- You'll lose.

117
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:45,820
No problem. Tell me, how much?
- Whatever you say.

118
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,731
Rs.100, Rs.200, Rs.1000.

119
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,531
Then you have lost the bet.
Come home quickly with the money.

120
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,371
Aruna, listen!

121
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,095
Sir, please excuse.

122
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,931
It's a girl.
- Girl!

123
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,811
Sir!
- What is it?

124
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,731
It's a baby girl.

125
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,657
Nurse, how is my wife?

126
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,491
She's bleeding.
I'm going to call the doctor.

127
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:48,212
What happened, sir?...Sir!
- Nothing.

128
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,451
Sorry Mr.Sharma,
I could not save her.

129
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,692
Sir, the car is waiting.
- Okay.

130
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:54,931
Listen...

131
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:02,131
Are you forgetting something?

132
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,851
Sarla, why do
you bring her before me?

133
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,172
Is there no other place
for her in the world?

134
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:30,171
Sorry Mr.Sharma,
I could not save her.

135
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:57,332
Where is my daughter?
...Where is she?

136
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,739
Why don't you speak?

137
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:48,212
How are you at fault?
Why do I hate you?

138
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:54,452
It's my ill-fate.

139
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:12,491
Uma dear!

140
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:46,092
Where are you?
...Where are you, dear?

141
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,371
Uma!...Where is Uma?

142
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,851
Where are you, dear?

143
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,971
Go to sleep now.

144
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:00,584
Take... take it to him.

145
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:07,462
Go... why are you afraid?

146
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,057
If you still keep running
away from your father,

147
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,931
when will you
get close to him?

148
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,331
Take... take.

149
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:19,092
He will gradually accept you.
Go.

150
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:26,291
What a destiny the poor girl
is born with.

151
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:27,872
Have you ever heard of a father

152
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:31,580
who is not ready to look at his
daughter's face unless he's drunk?

153
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:16,671
You? Why did you bring this?

154
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,571
Didn't your teacher come today?

155
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:27,812
Then what are you doing here?
Go and study.

156
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,372
Where were you?
Where is Govind?

157
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:52,771
Tell me, in which year
did the soldiers mutiny happen?

158
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:58,532
Say something.
...Your silence beats me.

159
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:03,332
You write so well.
What happens to you while talking?

160
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:09,092
At least tell me if a mutiny
did take place or not.

161
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:15,331
This is what happens
with rich kids.

162
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,731
Their parents
spoil them silly.

163
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:42,692
Sir, are you not feeling well?
- Yes.

164
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,011
Then go home.
It's not a busy day today.

165
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,411
I think I'll do just that.

166
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:12,771
Why did you touch it?
..Why did you!

167
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,611
Go away from here!
Go away!

168
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,451
Firstly, you will
have to quit drinking.

169
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:43,772
Secondly, you need
to take a holiday.

170
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,697
Where do I have the
time to take a holiday?

171
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:49,051
You will have to spare time.

172
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:52,617
Don't worry doctor,
I'll take him.

173
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:55,337
Alright Mr.Suresh,
he is your childhood friend.

174
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:59,131
Take him somehow.
It's your responsibility now.

175
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,051
I'll be going, bye!

176
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,291
I was going with my daughter
to Mahableshwar anyway.

177
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:09,691
Now you also come along,
and take Uma too.

178
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:20,905
Why did you knock and enter?
Since when did you become so formal?

179
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,337
That's not formal,
it's normal.

180
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:27,459
One must knock before
entering someone's room.

181
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:31,017
Who knows what you are doing inside?
There could be a woman inside.

182
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,737
Oh, I forgot!
You are a widower.

183
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:38,011
But widowers need more privacy.
Right, Bakshi?

184
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:40,617
Hey, I forgot!
Even you are a widower.

185
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:44,136
Strange! Anyone who comes to
meet Sharma becomes a widower.

186
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,175
Good I didn't get married.

187
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,729
Anyway, how are you, Sharma?

188
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,338
Damn it! He's made
a mountain of a mole hill.

189
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,692
Nonsense!
I'm talking him to Mahableshwar.

190
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:01,577
The doctor didn't ask him to quit
smoking and drinking just like that.

191
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:05,256
Wonderful!
Do one thing.

192
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,177
Send me all the bottles.
You desire to live, I desire to die.

193
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:14,491
Moses, don't talk
of death now.

194
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:19,772
Got scared? Your own death
is a matter of fun.

195
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,131
One doesn't know anything himself,
and the others cry.

196
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:26,306
That is why, I don't want to make
you cry, but cry myself.

197
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:30,811
We are your friends.
How can we let you cry?

198
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:35,612
Look, you are going to die soon.
So make your Will.

199
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:38,972
If you die before that,
I'll lose my fees.

200
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,771
Oh! I forgot to give you
the important news.

201
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,697
Your future son-in-law,
and my landlord

202
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,777
is returning from
Europe next week.

203
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,657
Who?
- Hari Mehta's son, Arun.

204
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:55,299
Has Uma's marriage
been fixed with Arun?

205
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:59,611
First consider
who is saying this.

206
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,932
Though Hari desired that
his son marry my daughter.

207
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,977
But Suresh, if Arun is returning,
I just cannot come with you.

208
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,697
No, you go, I'll send
him to Mahableshwar.

209
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,051
One who has traveled thousands of
miles, won't he travel another 200?

210
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:17,371
What I only fear is that he'll
start pestering me for the rent.

211
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:24,137
I'll give him rent, but only
that can take him to Mahableshwar

212
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,531
not bring him back.

213
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,252
Moses, you also come along.
- Mahableshwar? No!

214
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,657
I have a sad memory
connected with Mahableshwar.

215
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,531
What memory?

216
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:41,577
I'd fallen in love there.
- Is it? When?

217
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:46,377
In 1932. No, in that year, I fell
in love with Rosy in Darjeeling.

218
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:50,499
This was in 1931. When I stepped out
of the hotel in Mahableshwar.

219
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:54,184
I saw a beautiful girl
standing near the mountain.

220
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,175
At that time, the new fad was
women wearing trousers.

221
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:03,497
I saw her and fell for her.
And started following her.

222
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:07,771
Then what happened?
- It is better if you don't ask.

223
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:13,052
That girl turned
out to be a boy.

224
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,393
Everything seems new,
doesn't it, Arun?

225
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,660
Yes, I am returning after
five years after all.

226
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:46,975
Why didn't Ashok come?
- I forgot to tell you.

227
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,851
His mother is not keeping well.
- What happened to her?

228
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:53,691
It's nothing serious. Ashok has gone
to collect the reports. He'll come.

229
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,574
How is my tenant, Mr.Moses?

230
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:17,212
Who are you looking for, uncle?
- The madam.

231
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:18,760
Madam?

232
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:21,097
Yes. Didn't you bring
along a madam from abroad?

233
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:22,971
No.
- Damn you!

234
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,371
You have truly disappointed me.
- Why?

235
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:29,211
I thought you will come back
and make me proud.

236
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,091
But you didn't do a thing!

237
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:34,971
Come inside.

238
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,537
Uncle, why all
this decoration?

239
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,891
I thought, two
of you will come.

240
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:49,252
And become three before
removing it all.

241
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:55,972
Alright tell me, what feats
did you accomplish there?

242
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,057
- I wrote, I read.
- And?

243
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:01,739
I played cricket, tennis.
- And?

244
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:04,611
Traveled to other countries.
- And?

245
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:06,531
And nothing else.

246
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:13,257
But uncle, it is necessary to marry
a foreigner if you go abroad?

247
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:17,091
Who spoke of your marriage?
You'll bring the girl, I'd marry her.

248
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,937
Great! He would spend her fare,
and you would marry her?

249
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:26,320
That's what happens.
In 1936, when I brought Clara.

250
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:28,621
No, in 1936, it was Polly.

251
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:32,977
In 1939, when I brought Clara to
India, I put her up in a good hotel.

252
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:36,624
But the climate here didn't
suit her. She caught a cold.

253
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,655
Then?- I took her to Dr.Gomes.

254
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:44,177
Why are you laughing, uncle?
- What else can I do?

255
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:50,219
Know what happened? Dr.Gomes married
her, & I had to pay her hotel bills.

256
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:55,249
Look, don't ask for the rent
now that you have come.

257
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:58,858
I'm broke.
- What are you saying, uncle!

258
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:01,777
In fact, I should be paying you.
- Why?

259
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,651
You looked after my house in
my absence for so many years.

260
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:08,458
Give me Rs.500.
Alright, forget it. We are quits.

261
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:13,252
Uncle Moses, we are planing to
throw a grand party next Sunday.

262
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,832
In honor of Arun's return.

263
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:17,580
Not Sunday.
He has to go to Mahableshwar.

264
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,971
Mahableshwar?
- Sharma is not keeping well.

265
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,371
What happened to him?
- Nothing to worry about.

266
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,771
I have promised him I'll send you
over as soon as you return.

267
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:31,057
Then I will have to go. Uncle, you
chat with them, I'll meet Ashok & come.

268
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:32,451
Alright.

269
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:38,211
What will you take?
Gopal, get us whiskey.

270
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,375
Who... who is it?
...Oh my God!

271
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:15,452
Oh my God, it's you!
Ma, come quickly! Look who's here.

272
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:17,897
We were happy you
were away for five years.

273
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:19,656
But now you are
back to trouble us.

274
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,695
To trouble you and
to listen to your abuses.

275
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:24,571
Your abuses are better
than staying abroad.

276
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:29,851
Arun, you are back!
Bless you, son!

277
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:34,793
You have reduced.
- Because I didn't have ma there.

278
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:36,580
Now I'll put on again.

279
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:41,897
Ma, you are still as beautiful.
You still get dimples when you smile.

280
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,337
Naughty!

281
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,652
And you still express
shyness the same way.

282
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,737
I'm not talking to you.
- Why?

283
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:51,938
Why didn't you answer
my last three letters?

284
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:56,252
How could I? I learnt
the alphabet 50 years ago.

285
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,651
And forgot it all
rearing up the children.

286
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,713
It takes five days for
the letter to reach you

287
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,856
and it takes me seven days
to write a letter.

288
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,097
Tell me, how could I write?
- You are forgiven!

289
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,739
Tell me something,
haven't you found a nut yet?

290
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:12,091
Nut? For what?
- For Gauri.

291
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:17,372
I thought you must have got married
by now, but you are still here.

292
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,731
Look, I have bought you
a beautiful gift.

293
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,651
You'll get it when
you get married.

294
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:24,571
Now I won't give you anything
on your marriage now.

295
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:28,937
It's such a cheap watch.
- It's cheap? Return it back to me.

296
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:31,771
No, I don't want to
hurt someone's feelings.

297
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,211
You are forgiven.

298
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:40,412
Ashok, leave... leave me!

299
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:47,132
Have you stopped writing poetry?
- Why?

300
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:49,097
You have become so strong.

301
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,977
I was very sad because you left,
that's why I grew fat.

302
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,992
So a person grows
fat when he's sad?

303
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,393
You have gone all around the world,
but you are still an ass.

304
00:36:56,417 --> 00:37:01,061
Not as ass, an ass' friend.
- I'll thrash you!..Sit down.

305
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,931
So professor.
- I have quit being a professor.

306
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,920
I am a school teacher now.

307
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,777
Why? They dismissed
you from college?

308
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,993
No, I was not dismissed,
I quit the job.

309
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:14,856
I wasn't comfortable there.
There was no work, only money.

310
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,655
Being a school teacher is better.
All work, no pay.

311
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:22,831
How much time you wasted.
Look at the time!

312
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:26,576
I know you got a watch
as a gift. Go make tea for us.

313
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,415
Right away!

314
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:30,857
What's the problem
with mother?

315
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,377
Nothing serious,
she had an infection.

316
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,578
The doctor has advised
change of weather.

317
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:38,491
You know my financial state.

318
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:41,371
Yet, a publisher has promised
to give me money.

319
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:43,337
The moment I get that money,
I'll take ma to a hill station.

320
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,937
Why don't you take
her to Mahableshwar?

321
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:48,137
And I cannot afford to
take her so far.

322
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:50,537
Stop joking.
I am going to Mahableshwar.

323
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,073
My uncle, Mr.Sharma is sick.

324
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,664
I am going anyway to see him.
You all also come along.

325
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,096
As if that will not cost money.
- Mr.Ashok!

326
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,177
Who is it? Come inside.
- Your money order.

327
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:02,491
Money order! Where has it come from?
...Oh, the publisher has sent it.

328
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:04,411
That's surprising!

329
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:08,732
Gauri, the money has come,
get ready to leave.

330
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,416
You are going by car, isn't it?
We'll travel with you.

331
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,455
That will save
my travel expenses.

332
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:17,851
Have you counted it?
- Yes.

333
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,257
Has the money come?
- Yes.

334
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:23,976
Then shall I pack our bags?
- Yes. Here's your pen.

335
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,537
Keep it, I bought it for you.
- For me?

336
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:28,072
I'll begin
my new story with it.

337
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,820
Let's go up.
Gauri, get the tea upstairs.

338
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:33,691
Come! You are walking so slow.
- I am tired.

339
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:50,491
Mohan, what are you thinking?

340
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,331
I was thinking that
human mind is so strange.

341
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:59,612
Look, it's such a beautiful place,
there is so much peace here.

342
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:03,451
On one hand,
I feel like staying here.

343
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:08,252
But when I think of work,
I feel like going back right away.

344
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:12,091
Why are you
so obsessed with work?

345
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:16,411
You can quit drinking in a day, can't
you quit this obsession for work?

346
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,811
There is nothing left in life.

347
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:21,691
It is my work that
helps me forget everything.

348
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:25,531
Let's go back.

349
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,553
This girl is mad,
she'll even make me go mad.

350
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:43,300
Look!
She's riding a mad horse.

351
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:47,451
Anyone around?
...Sit down.

352
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:52,251
Get tea for him.
Has Annie returned? - Yes.

353
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:59,931
Don't talk to me!
- Why?

354
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,472
Why did you ride that horse?
I'd forbidden you.

355
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:05,023
You know that horse dropped
a guy. He broke his bones.

356
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,977
Leave me!
I said leave me!

357
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:15,291
I will not leave you.
- Leave me, I'll fall.

358
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:17,737
I won't. First say
you're not angry with me.

359
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,611
I'm not.

360
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:23,452
Daddy, you have grown old!

361
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,291
Me? I have grown old?
I challenge you for an arm wrestle.

362
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:33,051
Sharma uncle, you are the judge.

363
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,931
The other hand behind you.

364
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:05,211
Cheat! You used body weight.
Right, uncle?

365
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:08,091
An old man will
support another old man.

366
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,737
Just let Arun come!

367
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,898
Oh yes! Arun is coming.
Did you call the electrician?

368
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,811
Did you get the switch
in the guest room repaired?

369
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:17,800
Why do we need an electrician?
Arun is himself an engineer.

370
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,620
Can't he repair a switch?

371
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:23,017
He can do everything,
but not repair your head!

372
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,520
He will travel such a
long distance

373
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:26,473
and you expect him
to repair switches here?

374
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:27,912
What kind of a hostess are you?

375
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:31,620
Daddy, if you scold
me again, I'll... - What?

376
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,491
I'll ride the horse again!
- No! You are a good girl.

377
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,851
Only your brain... no,
it's better than any of us.

378
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:48,892
Mohan, I hope you don't
feel offended about all this.

379
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:51,771
About what?
- About Annie's behavior.

380
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:53,211
Why?

381
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:57,051
She has grown so big,
but she still acts immature.

382
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:00,891
Even she has the same fate
as your daughter.

383
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:04,731
She was a year old when
she lost her mother.

384
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,015
Since then, I have given her
the love of a father and mother.

385
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,838
Remove the luggage.
- Gauri, get down.

386
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:23,813
Ma, I'll just say hello
to Sharma uncle and come back.

387
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:27,876
Arun, I think you
should stay with them.

388
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,437
No. You stay out of this.
- She is right.

389
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,791
They may feel offended
about your staying here.

390
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:36,293
So let them. How can I stay
with them when you are here?

391
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:40,000
How can you suggest such a thing?
- Put an end to this now.

392
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:42,532
Arun, drop me off at the bazaar,
I'm feeling very hungry.

393
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:44,799
I'll pack something
for them too. Take the bags.

394
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:48,152
Keep this bag safely,
all the money is in this.

395
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:50,071
Let's go, Arun.

396
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:11,112
Why are you staring like that?
You have come to the right address.

397
00:43:12,141 --> 00:43:15,431
Don't recognise me?
I'm Annie!

398
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:21,672
You have grown so big! You were
so little when I last saw you.

399
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:28,276
Even you used to wear knickers then
which kept dropping to your knees.

400
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,275
And your nose kept leaking.

401
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:35,733
Now don't talk too much, go inside,
uncle Sharma is waiting for you.

402
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:38,613
And give me the car keys,
I'll take your luggage in.

403
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:41,841
I left my luggage at Holiday Camp.
- What do you mean?

404
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:46,151
Actually, my friend, Ashok, and his
mother and sister have come with me.

405
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,031
They are staying at Holiday Camp.
Even I am staying with them.

406
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:52,392
What did you say?
Say it again.

407
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:53,973
My friend Ashok.

408
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:55,860
His mother and sister
have come with you.

409
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,640
They are staying at Holiday Camp.
Even you want to stay with them.

410
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:02,997
Please go inside.
I am a little hot headed.

411
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:05,460
If I abuse you,
you'll complain.

412
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,413
It will be your fault,
and I will earn ill-repute.

413
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,200
Go inside, quick!

414
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:21,671
I said go inside!

415
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,955
Gopal, come with me.

416
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:36,117
It's such a beautiful place.
- Yes, but it's very cold.

417
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,517
Why don't you wear a shawl?
Where is it?

418
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,391
In the bedding.

419
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:41,940
I'm feeling dirty
after the travel.

420
00:44:41,964 --> 00:44:44,241
If I could get hot water,
I'd take a bath and feel fresh.

421
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:49,032
Don't open it! Gopal, pick
that bedding, I'll take the bag.

422
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:52,437
And even this.
I won't even let you touch it.

423
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:57,192
You are Ashok's mother, aren't you?
- Yes, do you know him?

424
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:01,038
I've never met him. I've even
heard his name for the first time.

425
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:04,532
You want to ask how I know
you are Ashok's mother.

426
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:06,837
Common sense!
Ashok is Arun's friend.

427
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:08,820
Your age says you
cannot be his sister

428
00:45:08,844 --> 00:45:10,357
nor can she be his mother.

429
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,077
I don't like to talk too much.
Let's go.

430
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:16,391
But we don't know you.

431
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:18,311
You will get to know me.

432
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:22,677
One who is with me even for
1-2 hours, can never forget me.

433
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:24,597
My name is Annie,
my papa's name is Suresh Bakshi.

434
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,517
And Bakshi Villa
is named after him.

435
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:30,933
If Arun wasn't stupid, he would
have brought you straight over there.

436
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:32,757
Anyway, forget what happened.
Let's go.

437
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:36,117
We don't mind coming,
but Ashok has gone out.

438
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:39,431
Let me ask him first.
- What will you ask him?

439
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:44,231
Nothing, but he's has his own ways.
What if he doesn't agree?

440
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:49,717
Aunty, I am a very nice girl.
But if it comes down to fighting

441
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,918
no one can defeat me.

442
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:58,632
If he comes here and refuses,
just think of the fireworks here.

443
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,117
Will you like that?

444
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:02,517
That's alright,
but when brother returns.

445
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,460
The watchman will tell him. Everyone
here knows where our bungalow is.

446
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:12,309
Aunty, our place is so huge,
each person has three rooms.

447
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:17,359
Please come! I took pains to
make the guest rooms. Please come.

448
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:25,696
Listen! Is this Bakshi Villa?
- Yes.

449
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,735
Is anyone in?
- Yes, go inside.

450
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:44,051
Excuse me.

451
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:48,851
Hello.

452
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:53,171
My name is Ashok.

453
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:56,051
Did you bring my mother and
sister here from Holiday Camp?

454
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:03,251
You are Mr.Bakshi's daughter,
aren't you?

455
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:07,091
But this is Bakshi Villa,
isn't it?

456
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,491
Then.

457
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,816
You are too much, Ashok!
What took you so long?

458
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:16,211
And what is this? You have
even brought your ration along?

459
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:20,289
It's like carrying your bed along
when you go to someone's house.

460
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:23,418
Now don't talk too much,
go and take a wash.

461
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:27,777
But you don't need
to take a wash.

462
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:31,745
Seeming you,
I feel like taking a wash.

463
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:36,379
Come, your sister and mom must
be wondering where you are. Come!

464
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:47,891
Stranger characters here.

465
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:52,212
Why just a short story,
even a novel can be written here.

466
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:58,317
Ashok, get dressed soon, or the food
will get cold, & Annie will get hot.

467
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:00,717
Why do I have to get dressed?
Let's go.

468
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:04,077
But listen, Gauri. You are
a guest of cultured people.

469
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:06,911
Please show
some table manners.

470
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:11,277
You think I'm so stupid?
- I didn't say SO stupid.

471
00:48:11,301 --> 00:48:14,591
Have we never been invited
by a rich man?

472
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:17,471
You have dinner
everyday at home.

473
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,314
At home, you lick
your fingers.

474
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:25,325
But over here, you'll have to sit on
the chair and eat with fork and spoon.

475
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,777
Will you be able to manage?
- With knife and fork?

476
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:31,092
Then you brother and sister
better sit away from each other.

477
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:35,411
Ma, she doesn't listen to me,
you only make her understand.

478
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,811
She has to behave well.

479
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,792
Ma, even you are laughing?
I'm not coming!

480
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:45,020
Ma, why did you laugh?
Come, Gauri.

481
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,371
Come on, hurry!
I'm feeling hungry.

482
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,731
No, you didn't do the right thing.
You shouldn't have taken up a job.

483
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,574
You should have started some
business. You had my support.

484
00:48:55,641 --> 00:49:00,372
You are right, but I couldn't
muster courage to do business...

485
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:02,337
because I didn't
have experience.

486
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:05,857
Who has experience in the beginning.
You slowly gain experience.

487
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:09,057
No one is born with it.

488
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:12,372
Even I didn't have any
experience when I started business.

489
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:14,291
Perhaps that's
why I succeeded.

490
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:17,651
They have come!

491
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:21,011
Please come.

492
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,851
Ashok, sit here.
Gauri, you sit here.

493
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:33,492
He's Ashok, and she's his mother.
And she's Gauri.

494
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:36,033
Please sit down.
- Ashok, he's my uncle.

495
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,780
You know about him,
and he is.

496
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:40,096
I'm Bakshi.

497
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,614
Mr.Bakshi, Ashok is a
very good writer.

498
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:45,057
His articles and short stories
get published

499
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:48,851
in India's leading magazines.
- Great! How does he make a living?

500
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:55,572
You are right. A writer has to
have a job to make a living.

501
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:57,249
One cannot survive
by just writing.

502
00:49:57,273 --> 00:50:02,624
Only a few buy books to read them.
All the others borrow.

503
00:50:02,648 --> 00:50:05,655
Do people even read
in our country?

504
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:10,816
Papa, everyone is talking,
and I haven't spoken a word.

505
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,334
And you say I talk too much.

506
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:16,897
The talks are small, but when
you speak them, they become too much.

507
00:50:16,921 --> 00:50:22,939
Papa! You are very bad. I won't
dine with you, I'll dine with Uma.

508
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:27,732
Uma come, I'll dine
with you today.

509
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:32,052
Annie... is she
your younger sister?

510
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:35,411
No aunty, she is Sharma
uncle's daughter, Uma.

511
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:38,400
I am elder to her
by four years.

512
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:42,817
But coincidentally,
we were born on the same day.

513
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:47,457
Is it? Come and dine with us.
- No aunty, she is going to dine.

514
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:50,337
But in another room.
She doesn't eat in ether's presence.

515
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,171
Why?
- She's shy.

516
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:58,452
Is it? Then I'll done with her. She
won't feel shy with me, will she?

517
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,696
If you people don't mind,
I'll dine with Uma.

518
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,360
Even I am not used to
a table and chair.

519
00:51:03,384 --> 00:51:08,541
Come dear.
...You sit here!

520
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:15,260
It's surprising, isn't it?
Uma is growing old by the day.

521
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:18,131
And you are becoming a child.

522
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:21,491
Boy! serve us dinner.

523
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,568
<i>Did the heart
say something?</i>

524
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:06,204
<i>Nothing.</i>

525
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:21,084
<i>Did the heart
hear something?</i>

526
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:29,244
<i>Nothing.</i>

527
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:36,924
<i>There are such
conversations too.</i>

528
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:46,524
<i>Did the heart say something?</i>

529
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:14,364
<i>The heart is
feeling naughty.</i>

530
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:22,044
<i>Someone make
it see sense.</i>

531
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:32,123
<i>Desires awaken.</i>

532
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:39,324
<i>Someone may get defamed.</i>

533
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:46,888
<i>On the bed of cold lids</i>

534
00:53:46,912 --> 00:53:51,807
<i>sleep the fairies
of dreams.</i>

535
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:57,564
<i>There are such
conversations.</i>

536
00:54:29,793 --> 00:54:34,524
<i>To console the heart</i>

537
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:39,804
<i>is fake shine,
fake glamour.</i>

538
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:47,004
<i>Though life
remained meaningless</i>

539
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:52,284
<i>everyone thought
it was spring.</i>

540
00:54:56,673 --> 00:55:01,884
<i>Does anyone ask the buds</i>

541
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:06,684
<i>whether they laugh or cry?</i>

542
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:11,964
<i>There are such
conversations.</i>

543
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:57,564
You wake up so early?
The mornings are so beautiful.

544
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:01,403
Everything seems
bathed in milky coldness.

545
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:06,684
And then slowly, everything
wears a cloak of brightness.

546
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:07,844
Isn't it?

547
00:56:09,764 --> 00:56:14,085
What are you hiding in your scarf?
...Flowers?

548
00:56:15,524 --> 00:56:16,484
Let me see.

549
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:22,724
They are so beautiful.

550
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,604
Shall I take a few?

551
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,484
Uma, you came out
without warm clothes?

552
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:30,699
Hello.
- Hello. Did Arun get up?

553
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:34,725
No. Shall I send you tea?
- If it isn't too much of a trouble.

554
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:38,572
It's no trouble at all.
Come Uma, wear your sweater.

555
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:47,200
Arun! Don't drink tea.
- What happened?

556
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:50,496
I said don't drink tea!
- But what is the matter?

557
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,559
We are all going out today.
We will eat and drink there.

558
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:58,037
Get up!
- When she asks you to get up

559
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:01,874
you'll have to get up.
Consider it army orders. Go.

560
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:05,714
Let's go.

561
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:15,865
He's a nice guy. Remember,
even his father was like that.

562
00:57:16,344 --> 00:57:21,145
He's very jovial. I am sure
Uma will be very happy with him.

563
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:26,425
Arun, we'll have
a great time today!

564
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:32,184
For what? - For saving me
from those old men.

565
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:39,385
How dare you call my father old!
- I was talking about Sharma uncle.

566
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:43,704
Uncle Sharma?
Shall I tell him?

567
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:47,392
Come on! You take everything
seriously. I was just joking.

568
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,759
I understand.
You are just like me.

569
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,384
You never realise what you say.

570
00:57:52,824 --> 00:57:56,032
The only difference is that
I talk too much.

571
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:58,911
But rarely is it wrong.

572
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:02,904
Even you talk,
but it is rarely correct.

573
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:08,189
Yet, I like you.
You are so jovial.

574
00:58:08,664 --> 00:58:10,584
What are you waiting for?
Go ask the others to get ready.

575
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:13,759
Annie, if I tell Ashok,
he may not.

576
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,232
But if you tell him, he may.

577
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:17,304
Alright, I'll convince them.

578
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:23,268
Gauri, get up!
- Ma, let me sleep.

579
00:58:23,424 --> 00:58:27,112
What a lazy girl you are! Look,
your brother even took a walk.

580
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:31,240
Ma, let her sleep.
- Come on, get dressed!

581
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:36,040
Gauri, you are still sleeping?
Mr.Writer, enough writing. Get up.

582
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:37,184
What is the matter?

583
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,837
I have decided to
have our breakfast outdoors.

584
00:58:41,024 --> 00:58:42,464
Why drag an old woman along?

585
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:44,384
If you don't mind, excuse me.

586
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:50,145
Aunty is old, so she won't come.
You are young, so you won't come.

587
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:53,024
Uma won't go because
she's neither old, nor young.

588
00:58:53,504 --> 00:58:55,424
Gauri, even you
find some excuse.

589
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:57,824
Alright.
Today's program is canceled!

590
00:58:58,304 --> 00:59:03,433
Why cancel? I will go alone.
And will eat for all of you.

591
00:59:04,064 --> 00:59:07,905
Don't be angry, dear. Gauri,
get dressed. Ashok, you too.

592
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:16,064
Get ready soon,
I am waiting for you.

593
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:17,832
Ma, what did you get me into?

594
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:20,864
Get up! What have you come
here for? Not to sit indoors.

595
00:59:25,664 --> 00:59:26,624
Get in.

596
00:59:32,184 --> 00:59:36,024
Ashok, keep this inside.
Gauri, did you take a mat? - Yes.

597
00:59:36,184 --> 00:59:37,788
And the basket.
- I've kept it in the boot.

598
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:40,671
Won't Uma come with us?
- She doesn't go anywhere.

599
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:43,704
At least try.
- You didn't I didn't?

600
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:46,432
The moment she heard picnic,
she broke into cold sweats.

601
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,759
I was worried she'll faint.
That's how shy she is.

602
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:52,825
That is why we
should take her along.

603
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:56,184
Our company is a must for her.

604
00:59:56,664 --> 01:00:00,985
Forget it. Why trouble yourself
over something that's not possible?

605
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,424
Let's go.

606
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:21,625
Why didn't you go with them?
Why can't you be merry like them?

607
01:00:22,104 --> 01:00:24,024
Why are you always
lost in yourself?

608
01:00:27,384 --> 01:00:31,225
You don't like this noise,
this crowd, right?

609
01:00:32,184 --> 01:00:34,104
Even I don't like it.

610
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:36,984
Let's go back today itself.

611
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,975
<i>The wet weather.</i>

612
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:10,974
<i>It makes my heart go wild.</i>

613
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,810
<i>It makes the tresses fly.</i>

614
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,650
<i>And steals the
fragrance from flowers.</i>

615
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,056
<i>The crazy, naughty wind!</i>

616
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,410
<i>The wet weather.</i>

617
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,850
<i>The bird sings
in the jungle</i>

618
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,690
<i>and thrills every nerve.</i>

619
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,530
<i>Like someone naughty</i>

620
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,775
<i>secretly lifts the veil.</i>

621
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,253
<i>No one came,
no one who I liked.</i>

622
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,093
<i>So my shadow
walked along with me.</i>

623
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,490
<i>The wet weather.</i>

624
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,170
<i>A whiff of wind
blows every moment.</i>

625
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,850
<i>And blows away my scarf.</i>

626
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:19,612
<i>My heart, my soul,
my life, sing softly.</i>

627
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,496
<i>My heart has bloomed.</i>

628
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,810
<i>A pain sears my heart.</i>

629
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,210
<i>The wet weather</i>

630
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,461
Madam...
- Who is it?

631
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:54,541
Uma, you!
Come dear. Come, sit down.

632
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:01,741
Madam, a telegram has come. Mr.Sharma
will have to leave today itself.

633
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,580
And you two?
- Even we will have to leave.

634
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:08,943
But I have not even been
able to talk to you.

635
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,820
Madam, have breakfast.

636
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,031
I don't eat anything
in the mornings.

637
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,140
Nothing at all?
- No.

638
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,540
Eat something.

639
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,260
I'll have to eat
if you tell me.

640
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:30,060
This is surprising, madam.
She doesn't even talk to anyone.

641
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,900
I know why she doesn't talk.

642
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,700
If she talks,
flowers will fall.

643
01:04:39,499 --> 01:04:42,064
And if she smiles,
pearls will fall.

644
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,870
Don't drag me.

645
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,536
Ma, it was such fun. It would
be nice if you had come along.

646
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,697
Yes, you'd see what a good
sense of humor she has.

647
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,096
I can't be serious
like you every time.

648
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,031
Ma, they are so rich,
but not at all proud.

649
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:01,472
They are very nice people.

650
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:04,256
Gauri, never form an
opinion about someone so soon.

651
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,090
Why, can't rich
people be good?

652
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,591
Some good men do become rich.

653
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:14,779
But it's very difficult to
stay good after becoming rich.

654
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,650
I am waiting for the day
when you will become rich.

655
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,191
That's impossible.

656
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:23,899
Why? It's possible some film producer
buys one of your novel some day.

657
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,936
That day will indeed be
very unfortunate for him.

658
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,096
But Gauri, I have thought of a
wonderful plot.

659
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,411
I forgot to tell you.
Sharma left for home.

660
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,290
Suddenly?
- Yes, he received a telegram.

661
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:43,231
I could not even meet her.
- Yes, she was such a sweet girl.

662
01:05:43,255 --> 01:05:46,939
I'd begun to like her very much.
Wonder when she'll meet us again.

663
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,010
Ma, you had gone outside?
- No.

664
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,331
Then who brought these flowers?
- Uma gave them before she left.

665
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,295
So you want a divorce,
Mr.Clairiat? - Yes.

666
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,135
Do you know what divorce means?
- Yes, leaving one's wife.

667
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,680
Reason?
- Marriage.

668
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,977
Why did you get married?
- I didn't, she married me.

669
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,890
She was after me,
I could not refuse.

670
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,730
Why? - You are old,
you won't understand.

671
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,560
I understand! Love marriage?

672
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,361
Seeing my face, you don't believe it?
No one does. Even I don't.

673
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,240
How many years have you
been married? - Five years.

674
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,041
Why do you want to break this
relationship of five years in a day?

675
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,880
She always taunts
me about my face.

676
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,404
Before marriage, she used to
say my face is like the moon.

677
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,680
And now

678
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,961
You only find some solution. Help
me get out of this daily tension.

679
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,321
Because of the fight, did she
ever stop looking after you?

680
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:14,343
No, never.

681
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,978
Did she ever not take care
of you when you were ill?

682
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,120
She did.

683
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:20,050
Who cooks food?
- She does.

684
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:22,344
Did you ever have to go
hungry after the fight?

685
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,360
No.
- Then why have you come here?

686
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:26,288
Send her, I'll fight
the case on her behalf.

687
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:32,041
Then what about me?
- You'll have to pay her alimony.

688
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,361
Damn! I only make Rs.400 a month.
How will I survive?

689
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,090
Shall I tell you?
- Yes.

690
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,081
Go home. And behave the way
you used to with your wife earlier.

691
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,881
The woman who loved a man
like you, married you

692
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,160
looked after you, fed you...
Remember, she still loves you.

693
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,000
Mr.Clairiat, you cannot
clap with one hand.

694
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,404
Go home,
everything will be alright.

695
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:02,287
Will it?
- Believe me

696
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:03,729
everything will be alright

697
01:08:03,815 --> 01:08:05,169
May I leave?
- Yes.

698
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,881
How good a cook is your wife?
- Very good. Her Biryani

699
01:08:11,943 --> 01:08:16,210
Enough! The day you stop fighting,
invite me to taste her Biryani.

700
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,120
That will be my fees.
- Sure.

701
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,561
No! Is this true or am I
dreaming? Annie in a saree!!

702
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,960
Wait! Let me confirm.

703
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,768
I know! You want to pinch
me with that excuse.

704
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,168
Alright, but don't
pinch too hard.

705
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,000
How do I look in a saree?

706
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,601
Has this change come about only
on the outside, or within too?

707
01:09:06,663 --> 01:09:10,253
Why? - Because you
are talking to me

708
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,400
but looking up.

709
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,688
Arun and I had decided to go
marketing. I came a little early.

710
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:21,969
It's not your fault.
The watches nowadays run very slow.

711
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,761
Uncle, are these flowers
from your garden?

712
01:09:26,856 --> 01:09:29,966
The garden belongs to someone else;
the flowers are mine.

713
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,000
Flowers belong to those
who like flowers.

714
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,440
Can I take one?

715
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,281
Let someone else wear a
flower in your beautiful tresses.

716
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,600
Not on my behalf,
on Arun's behalf.

717
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,040
Happy now?

718
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:53,641
That fool will come, and leave
without understanding the relation...

719
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:55,570
between tresses and flowers.

720
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:02,761
Uncle, you are so nice. You are not
only daddy's, but my friend too.

721
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,080
But uncle,
why are they not like you?

722
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,400
They have all turned old
and senile. I am still young.

723
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,721
Uncle, remember
what it is next Friday?

724
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,521
Your birthday, right?
I'll surely come.

725
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,920
And bring along a huge bouquet.

726
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,721
If anyone comes between you and me,
I'll get into a duel with him.

727
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,560
What is the mater, uncle?
- There he comes!

728
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,360
What happened?
Why are you laughing?

729
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,721
Nothing happened.
And it cannot either.

730
01:10:39,912 --> 01:10:42,127
I am laughing because
I cannot cry.

731
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,881
You are getting late,
aren't you? Go.

732
01:10:51,905 --> 01:10:55,705
<font color="#ff0000"><i>Synced by Anomix33</i></font>

733
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,214
You!
- What are you doing?

734
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:08,866
Batik.
- You make it yourself?

735
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,931
It's very easy.
- Teach me too.

736
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:16,257
I may look stupid,
but I am very smart.

737
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:20,090
Who are you talking to, Gauri?
Oh, it's you!

738
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,600
Aunty, Gauri is so nice, so smart.
Why can't I be so nice?

739
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,961
There is no one more
nicer than you, dear.

740
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:31,367
May you always be like this.

741
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,768
I had some important
work with you.

742
01:11:33,952 --> 01:11:37,127
Tell me.
- I forgot what it was.

743
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,848
Arun, why had I come here?
- Your birthday.

744
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,960
Keep quiet!

745
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,135
Aunty, I'm celebrating
my birthday day after tomorrow.

746
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,720
And bring along
Ashok and Gauri.

747
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,120
Tell Gauri personally,
or she won't come.

748
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:53,286
Gauri, do come.
- I would surely come, but

749
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,240
But what? - I teach in
a school in the evenings.

750
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,601
You know I already took
such a long holiday.

751
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:03,524
So I won't be able to make it.

752
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,281
- Offended?
- How can I be?

753
01:12:09,599 --> 01:12:11,683
I have to learn Batik from you.

754
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,969
Aunty, when will Ashok come? Ask
him to attend the party definitely.

755
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,840
Yes, he will surely come,
even if he is busy.

756
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:23,690
What if he is very busy?
- Even then he will come.

757
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:28,484
That's good. I'll be going now,
I have to invite many other people.

758
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:32,810
Bye, Gauri.
- Bye ma, bye Gauri.

759
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,120
They are such nice people.
- Yes, ma.

760
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,327
Ma, some day,
we must visit Uma's home.

761
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,320
Yes, though we were together only
for a few days, I cannot forget her.

762
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,495
I have even asked Ashok
to look them up.

763
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,561
You think he will ever
visit a rich person's home?

764
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,440
When did you return?
- 4-5 days ago.

765
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,364
Gauri, your mother,
how is everybody?

766
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:58,250
They are fine. Mother wanted me to
look you up as soon as we were back.

767
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,368
How is Mr.Sharma?
- He has gone to Delhi.

768
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,440
Be seated, I'll be back.

769
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,270
Hello.

770
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,790
Mother has sent me
to look you up.

771
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:32,420
And I have come to thank you.

772
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,701
I got those flowers you left.

773
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,980
I hope you are fine.

774
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,660
I had come to inquire about you,
which I have. May I leave now.

775
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,020
I can stay if you like.

776
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,701
I'm going.
- No, please stay.

777
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,980
Thank you God!
You at least spoke something.

778
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:10,820
Or I had decided that if you
don't speak to me today

779
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,220
I'll never step
into this house again.

780
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,061
Will you stand there?
Please come and sit here.

781
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,180
Tell me, why don't you speak?
..Sit down.

782
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:32,909
I don't need to tell you this,
but your eyes say everything.

783
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:48,740
So much only for me?

784
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:55,275
I am a good eater, specially
where sweets are concerned.

785
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,820
But I am embarrassed.

786
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,995
I'll get one more plate.

787
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,620
Take, one more plate is coming.

788
01:15:04,419 --> 01:15:07,944
I have just eaten.
- Even I have just eaten.

789
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,780
Look Uma, better eat, or else

790
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,620
or I'll finish it alone.

791
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,301
Uma, I think you have
never seen yourself smile.

792
01:15:23,396 --> 01:15:25,993
Some day, go and smile
into the mirror.

793
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:29,061
You'll know how
beautiful your smile is...

794
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,500
how sweet.

795
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:42,020
'Uma, I think you have
never seen yourself smile.'

796
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,900
'Some day, go and smile
into the mirror.'

797
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,261
'You'll know how
beautiful your smile is.'

798
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:36,910
What is this?
You are still writing?

799
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,830
Looks like you have
been awake all night.

800
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:43,631
Yes Gauri, I was
awake all night.

801
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,430
Gauri, my novel
is going great.

802
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,791
Wish we could take our characters,
our thoughts from real life,

803
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:54,198
instead of imagining them.
It would be so nice.

804
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:58,511
It's Annie's birthday day after.
She liked Batik very much.

805
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:00,910
Shall I make a
piece of Batik for her?

806
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:04,278
Yes, sure.
- But it's such a cheap thing.

807
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,719
And they are so rich.

808
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:12,911
Come on! They should see the feeling
behind the gift, not it's price.

809
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:18,190
Alright, I'll make two pieces.
One for Annie, and another for Uma.

810
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:19,630
For Uma?

811
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,325
Yes, it's Uma's birthday too
on the same day.

812
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:23,950
Remember, Annie had told us.

813
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:27,311
Oh yes!
But Uma won't attend the party.

814
01:17:27,502 --> 01:17:29,717
So what?
Go and give it to her at home.

815
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:33,550
Get up. Take a wash.
Your tea is getting cold.

816
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,445
I'll tell you another
funny incident.

817
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:47,471
One day, a Mr.Rai came to my house.
He said, 'Lawyer, please save me'

818
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,390
I asked him what the matter was.

819
01:17:49,453 --> 01:17:52,083
He said his neighbour had
accused he had abused him.

820
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,710
So the neighbour
had dragged him to court.

821
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,437
I told him I'll save him.

822
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:01,390
That he must not speak in court.
He must act dumb.

823
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,118
He stood in court.

824
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:10,030
Mr.Rai didn't answer any
question the prosecutor asked him.

825
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:14,831
I told the judge how could Rai
have abused when he cannot speak.

826
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,278
The judge acquitted him.

827
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,670
Mr.Rai was happy, I was happy.

828
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:25,390
I congratulated Mr.Rai
and asked him for my fees.

829
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:29,711
Do you know what fees he gave me?
- What?

830
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:34,510
They've come!

831
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:46,994
I know who that is.

832
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,670
See! Every girl
recognizes my whistle.

833
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:00,910
Bless you. May you get
all happiness in life.

834
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,358
And leave all sorrows for me.

835
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:05,230
May you laugh.
May you always laugh.

836
01:19:05,549 --> 01:19:07,633
Yes Moses, that's the
blessing she needs.

837
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,510
You old man! What are you
doing among youngsters?

838
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,477
And what are you doing?

839
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,870
You are comparing
yourself with me?

840
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:19,631
I am the apple of everyone's eye,
and you are an irritation. Scram!

841
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:22,322
Okay baba (old man)!
- Hey! Who are you calling baba?

842
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,910
Call me young man.
- Alright! Young man.

843
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:32,590
Why are you so late?

844
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:36,438
You invited me at 7:30,
and it's 7:30 now.

845
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:37,870
Take.

846
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,550
Where is Ashok?

847
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,791
Hello Uma.
- Hello.

848
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,190
Feeding the fishes?

849
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:11,471
They are your good friends,
they don't trouble you.

850
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:15,790
Neither do they speak,
nor force you to speak.

851
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,630
I have brought something for you.
Close your eyes.

852
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,550
Come on!

853
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,437
Now extend your hand.

854
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:31,150
Gauri has herself made
it for you. - Herself?

855
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:34,037
Yes, as a gift
on your birthday.

856
01:20:45,837 --> 01:20:50,354
What happened?
...What happened, Uma?

857
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,150
Nothing... nothing.

858
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:58,999
What happened, dear?
- I don't know, she suddenly left.

859
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:01,718
Gauri had sent her a gift
on her birthday.

860
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,270
Oh, birthday.

861
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:07,630
How can her birthday be
a happy occasion for her?

862
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,990
She lost her mother
on the day she was born.

863
01:21:11,182 --> 01:21:13,495
That is why
she blames herself.

864
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:17,710
She is punishing
herself for that crime.

865
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,110
Where must she have gone now?

866
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:23,954
Where can she go? She must be
sitting in the garden and crying.

867
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,310
Can I go there?
- Yes.

868
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,125
When I go home,
ma and Gauri will ask me

869
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,710
what you thought
of the birthday gift.

870
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:58,510
What will I tell them?
I cannot lie

871
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,430
and I don't have the
courage to speak the truth.

872
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,790
I had come here with joy.

873
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:09,071
Had I known my coming here will
hurt you, I'd never have come.

874
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:12,918
You are not at fault.

875
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:15,310
If I was at fault,
it would be different.

876
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,710
Being blamed
despite being innocent

877
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,885
But one thing is true.

878
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,951
Neither would I come to wish you,
nor would you get hurt.

879
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:28,270
But now I will have to go and tell
Ma and Gauri that I made Uma cry.

880
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,630
Then look here, towards me.

881
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:35,470
Smile.

882
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:38,830
Let me at least take
something for mom and Gauri.

883
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,710
Smile.

884
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,741
<i>Why did you give me
so much happiness</i>

885
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,620
<i>that my heart fears?</i>

886
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:39,061
<i>I may get carried away,
I may slip</i>

887
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,220
<i>Why did you give me
so much happiness</i>

888
01:23:47,244 --> 01:23:49,944
<i>that my heart fears?</i>

889
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,180
<i>I have so much
to choose from.</i>

890
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:17,941
<i>I disgrace myself today.</i>

891
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,740
<i>My heart skips a beat.</i>

892
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,541
<i>If I begin to feel proud.</i>

893
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:43,864
<i>Why did you give me
so much happiness</i>

894
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:46,588
<i>that my heart fears?</i>

895
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:04,980
<i>I feel flushed
seeing my glowing face.</i>

896
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,261
<i>I may jinx myself.</i>

897
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,980
<i>This is a time when</i>

898
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,860
<i>you fall in love
with yourself.</i>

899
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:36,308
<i>Why did you give me
so much happiness</i>

900
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:38,632
<i>that my heart fears?</i>

901
01:25:55,660 --> 01:26:00,460
<i>Life is desperate for me.</i>

902
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:05,741
<i>Love is a beautiful
dream for me.</i>

903
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:24,308
<i>Wonder why everyone
gets carried away</i>

904
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,860
<i>when my heart gets
carried away.</i>

905
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,180
<i>Why did you give me
so much happiness</i>

906
01:26:31,204 --> 01:26:34,704
<i>that my heart fears?</i>

907
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:47,942
Come to my house some day.
I'll show you a sight.

908
01:26:48,172 --> 01:26:51,532
There is a colony of poor
people near our home.

909
01:26:52,012 --> 01:26:55,372
And we can see everything
they do from our balcony.

910
01:26:56,812 --> 01:27:00,020
I always wonder how
they must be surviving

911
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:02,091
with so many
sorrows and troubles.

912
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:07,853
Not just living, they sometimes
even manage to rejoice so much

913
01:27:08,332 --> 01:27:10,252
it surprises me.

914
01:27:11,212 --> 01:27:15,533
Now I think, is it
because they are used to sorrow?

915
01:27:15,692 --> 01:27:17,459
Sorrow is no more
sorrow for them.

916
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,332
But that's not the
reason of their craziness.

917
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:24,172
They have a strange
force of life.

918
01:27:24,652 --> 01:27:27,052
Hard work, hard work,
and more hard work.

919
01:27:27,532 --> 01:27:30,413
They don't get
anything easily.

920
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:34,732
So a little happiness
that comes their way

921
01:27:35,212 --> 01:27:38,572
they want to enjoy
it to the fullest.

922
01:27:40,491 --> 01:27:42,411
You have got a lot in life.

923
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,251
Haven't you?

924
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:52,012
And even if you haven't, so what?
You don't get everything in life.

925
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:56,812
Look at your father,
What does he lack?

926
01:27:57,292 --> 01:28:02,573
He has money, respect, status.
But a wife.

927
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:08,813
Sorry, I started
that topic again.

928
01:28:10,732 --> 01:28:12,652
Even I cannot forget it.

929
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:15,051
I am not asking
you to forget it.

930
01:28:15,532 --> 01:28:19,853
But just think.
The sorrow of your father.

931
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:22,252
You must always be happy,
so that your father.

932
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:28,340
No... I love him very much.

933
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:31,372
That's true. You don't even
like to look at anyone else.

934
01:28:31,852 --> 01:28:35,212
I'm stating a fact.
I gave such a big lecture.

935
01:28:35,692 --> 01:28:37,612
I came to wish you
on your birthday

936
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:40,021
but you didn't even
offer me a piece of sweet.

937
01:28:40,492 --> 01:28:43,373
I'll get it.
- Sit down, I was just joking.

938
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:47,212
I look calm and serene,
but I am very naughty.

939
01:28:52,012 --> 01:28:53,932
Tell me what
is wrong with this couplet.

940
01:28:54,124 --> 01:28:55,378
Which couplet?

941
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:00,172
Let's talk of the
beauty of my beloved.

942
01:29:00,652 --> 01:29:04,493
Let's talk of tresses,
of beautiful faces.

943
01:29:07,372 --> 01:29:09,772
Tell me.
You are all educated.

944
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:14,572
It's perfect, there is
nothing wrong with it.

945
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:16,337
Perfect? Nonsense!

946
01:29:16,491 --> 01:29:20,813
You would know if you had loved.

947
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:24,172
'Talking' is wrong here. Which means,
you are in love, & still only talking?

948
01:29:26,572 --> 01:29:29,932
Uncle, if Ashok was here,
he'd give you an answer.

949
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:33,772
Even Ashok, the great, would not
have been able to give an answer.

950
01:29:34,252 --> 01:29:37,612
Alright tell me, seeing a full moon,
why did the poet say

951
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:42,412
'l moon, hide behind clouds“

952
01:29:43,371 --> 01:29:45,291
'Why do you make me jealous?'

953
01:29:45,772 --> 01:29:48,172
'When the whole
world is hungry'

954
01:29:49,131 --> 01:29:50,572
'You remind me of food'

955
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:51,724
Wonderful!

956
01:29:53,452 --> 01:29:55,852
Why are you so late?
- I'm sorry.

957
01:29:56,332 --> 01:29:57,772
Gauri has sent this for you.

958
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:06,259
Gauri has sent this.
What have you brought for me?

959
01:30:06,411 --> 01:30:08,331
I... I have brought
you my best wishes.

960
01:30:08,812 --> 01:30:14,573
Just best wishes won't do.
You'll have to recite a poem for me.

961
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:18,740
Look, I am a poet
who writes only tragic poems.

962
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:21,772
My poetry won't befit
this happy occasion.

963
01:30:21,932 --> 01:30:27,061
Don't make us understand.
As it is, we are very knowledgeable.

964
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:38,092
Begin.
- Yes, come on!

965
01:30:40,011 --> 01:30:44,333
Uncle, I'll make the
lights dim for effect.

966
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,761
<i>Either hear what
my heart says</i>

967
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:07,001
<i>or let me keep quiet.</i>

968
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:12,761
<i>How can I call
sorrow, happiness?</i>

969
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:19,001
<i>Those who do, let them.</i>

970
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:25,241
<i>Either hear what
my heart says</i>

971
01:31:25,265 --> 01:31:31,665
<i>or let me keep quiet.</i>

972
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:16,601
<i>What flower has
bloomed in the garden?</i>

973
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:34,656
<i>The gardener does
not love it.</i>

974
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:40,601
<i>I laughed off everything.</i>

975
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:46,841
<i>Now, if my eyes
shed tears, let them.</i>

976
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,601
<i>Either hear what
my heart says.</i>

977
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:11,321
<i>I have not seen a
single happy dream.</i>

978
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:29,081
<i>Even if I have,
I've forgotten it.</i>

979
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,841
<i>You could not give
what I wanted.</i>

980
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:41,081
<i>Let me bear what
you have given me.</i>

981
01:33:41,559 --> 01:33:47,320
<i>Either hear what
my heart says.</i>

982
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:14,201
<i>No one can share
someone's sorrow.</i>

983
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:32,441
<i>No one has so much feeling.</i>

984
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:38,681
<i>Let the flowing
tears, flow.</i>

985
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:44,441
<i>Don't give me
that sympathy.</i>

986
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:50,681
<i>Either hear what
my heart says</i>

987
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:56,805
<i>or let me keep quiet.</i>

988
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:22,402
Hello.
How are you feeling now?

989
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,121
Hello uncle.
- Sit down, dear.

990
01:35:24,217 --> 01:35:27,774
I'm fine. You...
- We have come to invite you.

991
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:31,802
We are having a prayer session
day after. You and Uma must come.

992
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,685
Me?
- It's Sunday, a holiday.

993
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:40,450
Please don't mind, but I won't be
able to come. Uma will surely come.

994
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,801
Alright.
Gauri will come and take Uma.

995
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:49,082
Boy!
Ask the driver to drop them home.

996
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:52,930
Why do you bother?
- It's no bother.

997
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,281
The driver will know where you stay,
so Uma can come on her own.

998
01:35:56,761 --> 01:35:57,721
Good day.

999
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,108
Madam... - Brought the leaves?
Keep them there.

1000
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,701
Sit down, I'll just come.

1001
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:14,749
What is it? - He's brought
banana leaves. Pay him.

1002
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,261
What all do you want me to do? Do I
give tea to Ashok, or give him money?

1003
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:24,030
Give him the money.
- Uma, go upstairs & give Ashok tea.

1004
01:36:24,117 --> 01:36:25,950
Must you ask her to do things?

1005
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,821
So what?
...Go give him tea and come.

1006
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,341
Uma hasn't come yet, Gauri?
Tell me as soon as she comes.

1007
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,940
You? When did you come?

1008
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:05,781
They are making you do chores.
Please sit down.

1009
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:09,621
Won't you attend
the prayer session?

1010
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:11,381
I am praying.

1011
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,636
I think, working with dedication,
loving and respecting everyone

1012
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:18,261
that itself is
the greatest worship.

1013
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:21,141
But that doesn't mean
I am against praying.

1014
01:37:21,428 --> 01:37:24,985
We are having prayers,
that's why you came.

1015
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,701
Do you pray'?

1016
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,581
What do you ask from God?

1017
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:39,862
I forgot! You don't tell
what you ask from God.

1018
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:44,181
And then, girls even hide
what's on their mind from God.

1019
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,100
Isn't it?

1020
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:49,941
Even I sometimes feel like
asking something from God.

1021
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:54,262
But when God Himself is showering
all the world's beauty on me

1022
01:37:54,357 --> 01:37:59,103
without asking, & trying to provide
me with everything, why should I ask?

1023
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:01,461
Don't you think so?

1024
01:38:02,901 --> 01:38:06,742
Sarla says God doesn't
give happiness to everyone.

1025
01:38:06,837 --> 01:38:10,110
Don't say that.
Don't blame God.

1026
01:38:10,581 --> 01:38:13,462
It is we who
create woes for ourselves.

1027
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:19,702
Agreed there are reasons but
why are you standing? Sit down.

1028
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,341
What were you writing?

1029
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,141
A story.
A story of a girl like you.

1030
01:38:33,621 --> 01:38:36,981
She thought people
misunderstood her.

1031
01:38:37,461 --> 01:38:39,381
Even she didn't
understand others.

1032
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:42,741
She only understood the language
of flowers and birds.

1033
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:47,065
But she was very uncomfortable
in the world of humans.

1034
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:52,341
She never realized that the real
block was not outside, but within her.

1035
01:38:52,821 --> 01:38:54,261
Within her mind.

1036
01:38:55,701 --> 01:39:00,022
She kept a distance from people.
Even people got distanced from her.

1037
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:02,421
And then one day,
it so happened

1038
01:39:06,068 --> 01:39:07,541
What happened?

1039
01:39:09,141 --> 01:39:12,022
I was going to write that
when you came.

1040
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:27,662
No... no! I don't want to
hear anything. You are a coward.

1041
01:39:27,757 --> 01:39:29,906
You can love, but cannot
say even this.

1042
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,501
Please Annie,
how can I just say it?

1043
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:36,785
Alright, don't.
You keep pondering, I'm leaving.

1044
01:39:40,781 --> 01:39:43,508
What if I ask
Uncle Moses to tell him?

1045
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:45,901
Who is getting married?
You, or Uncle Moses?

1046
01:39:45,997 --> 01:39:48,823
I, but at least
let's take his advice.

1047
01:39:49,741 --> 01:39:50,701
Alright, come.

1048
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:58,382
Come dear.
- We want an advice from you.

1049
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,744
If it's legal advice,
you'll have to pay fees.

1050
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:04,469
If it's not legal advice,
you'll have to pay more fees.

1051
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:08,309
Oh uncle, don't joke.
- We are so nervous, and...

1052
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,420
What is the matter?

1053
01:40:15,661 --> 01:40:19,021
People rise in love,
not fall in love.

1054
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:21,421
Some say they are
arrested in love.

1055
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,261
Is love the police
that it can arrest you?

1056
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,508
Some say a girl
has made them die.

1057
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:30,061
Instead, they must say,
a girl has made them come alive.

1058
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,941
We are moving away
from the issue.

1059
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:36,301
Is there an issue
greater than love?

1060
01:40:36,461 --> 01:40:38,709
There is. Uncle Sharma
had called me yesterday.

1061
01:40:38,893 --> 01:40:41,904
You think he must get married?
- Yes.

1062
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:44,941
To the one who he doesn't even
love? Just because his father

1063
01:40:45,101 --> 01:40:50,230
Never! The one he loves...
he must marry her.

1064
01:40:50,317 --> 01:40:54,834
I am not saying he must marry me.
Whether he marries me or not

1065
01:40:55,021 --> 01:40:59,189
is not the question. The question is
how can he love one and marry another?

1066
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,781
Won't that ruin
both their lives?

1067
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:04,141
Uma is such a nice girl,
so innocent.

1068
01:41:04,236 --> 01:41:05,906
Would it be right
to cheat her?

1069
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,461
You are right.
- But uncle...

1070
01:41:08,557 --> 01:41:11,863
Arun, I can understand
the fix you are in.

1071
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:17,102
But just think.
To avoid a little pain today

1072
01:41:17,197 --> 01:41:19,380
if you take a wrong decision

1073
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:25,261
it is possible everyone may have to
bear much more pain in the future.

1074
01:41:25,741 --> 01:41:28,141
I won't marry anyone except Annie.

1075
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:36,302
But the problem is,
how do I tell Sharma uncle?

1076
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:41,581
You tell him, uncle.
- No son.

1077
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,941
You must face this yourself.

1078
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:49,261
Anyone else telling him
will hurt him terribly.

1079
01:41:49,741 --> 01:41:51,181
I know him.

1080
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,581
You must go.

1081
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,421
You have loved,
not committed a sin.

1082
01:41:57,517 --> 01:42:01,270
What will happen at the most?
He will slap you. Accept it.

1083
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:04,624
One has to bear
a lot for love.

1084
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,941
Even you want that, uncle?

1085
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,720
What is it, Arun?
- Send Ashok.

1086
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:19,601
He's not home.
- Damn!

1087
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:21,812
What happened? - I wanted
to take advice from Ashok.

1088
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:26,169
Take it from me. There is
nothing more cheaper than advice.

1089
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,721
Keep your advice with yourself,
or give it in school.

1090
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:33,041
You haven't gone to school today?
- I quit my job.

1091
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:36,881
Why? - We are leaving
for the village.

1092
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:40,721
What for?
- I'll teach in a school there.

1093
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:42,641
And even Ashok may join us later.

1094
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:44,856
Arun! when did you come?

1095
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:48,697
Ma, why this sudden decision
to live in the village?

1096
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:51,762
Ashok quit his job.
- Why?

1097
01:42:51,857 --> 01:42:55,130
It was difficult to survive.

1098
01:42:55,601 --> 01:42:58,961
But don't worry,
this decision is in our interest.

1099
01:42:59,441 --> 01:43:02,801
Ashok will stay here.
If he doesn't get another job

1100
01:43:02,961 --> 01:43:05,972
even he will join us in the village.
He will teach in a school there.

1101
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:08,081
If you all leave, even I'll
join you in the village.

1102
01:43:08,273 --> 01:43:10,968
I have no one here
to understand my problems.

1103
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,958
What problem? - Nothing,
just tell Ashok I'd come.

1104
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,164
Tell me about it.
- It's nothing.

1105
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:20,081
Really?
- Yes, it's nothing.

1106
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:26,801
What is the matter, Arun?
- It's nothing.

1107
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:29,201
There is something
which you aren't telling me.

1108
01:43:29,297 --> 01:43:31,643
It's nothing. Tell Ashok I'd come.
I'll come again.

1109
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:32,721
Alright.

1110
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:47,381
Arun, you?
When did you come?

1111
01:43:48,621 --> 01:43:51,981
Just now.
- You should have come upstairs.

1112
01:43:52,261 --> 01:43:55,621
Why did you stay here?
Don't you consider this your home?

1113
01:43:57,061 --> 01:43:58,501
Sit down.
What is it?

1114
01:43:58,981 --> 01:44:02,822
I am in a dilemma.

1115
01:44:03,781 --> 01:44:05,701
What dilemma?

1116
01:44:06,661 --> 01:44:10,982
I want to talk to you,
but it's a delicate matter.

1117
01:44:11,461 --> 01:44:13,861
Why are you so scared?
- I'm not scared.

1118
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:17,701
Are you busy?
- I am, but not for you.

1119
01:44:18,181 --> 01:44:19,621
What is it, tell me.

1120
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:28,746
Mr.Bakshi... l...
- What about Mr.Bakshi?

1121
01:44:29,701 --> 01:44:35,462
No... we had met that guy in his
house in Mahableshwarm... Ashok...

1122
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,345
What happened to him?
- He lost his job.

1123
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,225
The poor guy has to send
his mother and sister to the village.

1124
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,916
I was wondering if
- Is that all?

1125
01:44:44,101 --> 01:44:47,461
Yes. - Send him to me,
I'll do the rest.

1126
01:44:48,901 --> 01:44:52,261
Where are you going right now?
- I don't know.

1127
01:44:52,741 --> 01:44:55,141
Don't know?
- I do.

1128
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:58,021
Shall I drop you somewhere?
- No, I've brought my car.

1129
01:44:58,980 --> 01:44:59,940
I'm leaving.

1130
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:09,065
What are you writing, Gauri?
- Arun just left.

1131
01:45:09,253 --> 01:45:10,671
He has come twice
since morning for you.

1132
01:45:10,788 --> 01:45:13,669
Why, what is the matter?
- I don't know.

1133
01:45:13,861 --> 01:45:17,221
He said Mr.Sharma has called you
home, he has urgent work with you.

1134
01:45:17,701 --> 01:45:22,502
Mr.Sharma has called me?
Gauri, I really don't like Mr.Sharma.

1135
01:45:23,461 --> 01:45:26,342
I think you must go,
Arun looked very upset.

1136
01:45:27,301 --> 01:45:30,182
Is it? Then I'll have to go.

1137
01:45:30,373 --> 01:45:34,508
Since you are going there,
ask Uma to come and meet us.

1138
01:45:34,981 --> 01:45:37,676
Wonder when we'll meet again.
- Can't you call her up?

1139
01:45:37,861 --> 01:45:39,301
I'm not telling her anything.

1140
01:45:43,621 --> 01:45:47,462
Ma wants to meet you
before we leave for the village.

1141
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:51,116
We would come,
but the buses are so crowded.

1142
01:45:51,301 --> 01:45:53,701
You have a car,
why don't you come?

1143
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,620
Will you come?

1144
01:45:57,061 --> 01:46:01,382
I'm sure you are nodding. How
will I see that over the telephone?

1145
01:46:01,861 --> 01:46:05,221
Tell me, will you come?
- I will.

1146
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:10,981
Your father has called Ashok over
to your house. Do you know why?

1147
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:15,781
Nodding your head again?
- I don't know.

1148
01:46:17,221 --> 01:46:20,581
Come soon. I'll disconnect.

1149
01:46:34,641 --> 01:46:37,041
Take, drink.
- I don't want it.

1150
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:41,842
Why are you upset now? You have
sent daddy to meet Uncle Sharma.

1151
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:43,768
I saw what you could do.

1152
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,001
You are such a chatter box!

1153
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,320
I don't know what to do.

1154
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:59,122
What a dilemma!
...You say suggest something.

1155
01:47:00,561 --> 01:47:02,961
Why should I?
I am a chatter box.

1156
01:47:03,441 --> 01:47:07,762
Annie, try to understand.
Your problem is my problem.

1157
01:47:08,241 --> 01:47:10,161
But what is the problem?

1158
01:47:10,353 --> 01:47:12,568
I'd gone to meet Uncle Sharma
to talk about us.

1159
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:14,961
But told him instead
to help Ashok get a job.

1160
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,699
He told me to send him.

1161
01:47:19,761 --> 01:47:22,642
I told Gauri to tell Ashok
Uncle Sharma has called him.

1162
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,044
You did the right thing.
- Nonsense.

1163
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:28,889
You don't know Ashok.
He is a complicated man.

1164
01:47:29,361 --> 01:47:32,721
Then go and tell him not to go.
- I went twice, but didn't meet him.

1165
01:47:33,201 --> 01:47:37,042
If he goes to meet
Uncle Sharma, I've had it.

1166
01:47:44,721 --> 01:47:47,121
Who is it?
- Hello.

1167
01:47:47,601 --> 01:47:50,001
It's you.
- You wanted to meet me.

1168
01:47:50,481 --> 01:47:54,802
Me?...Oh yes!
But why did you come here?

1169
01:47:55,281 --> 01:47:56,721
You should have
come to my office.

1170
01:47:57,201 --> 01:47:58,641
Anyway, now that you
are here, sit down.

1171
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,400
How much salary do you expect?

1172
01:48:06,801 --> 01:48:08,721
How many years since
you passed your Masters?

1173
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,164
Six years.

1174
01:48:11,601 --> 01:48:16,882
Do you have any experience?
- No, I teach.

1175
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:19,761
That's the most easiest job.

1176
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:24,561
Anyway, I'll speak to Mr.Robinson
of National Builders.

1177
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,481
A job will
be arranged for you.

1178
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:32,242
Remember, a job means to
keep your seniors happy.

1179
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,081
Then even if
you have to flatter them.

1180
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,921
The guys nowadays have airs.

1181
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,721
They leave their
self respect behind.

1182
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:47,896
Or you know there are so many
graduates and double graduates

1183
01:48:48,081 --> 01:48:49,041
who are jobless.

1184
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,444
You have called me here
to give me a job?

1185
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:54,321
But who told you I want a job?

1186
01:48:54,801 --> 01:49:00,082
Arun did. - Arun?
He told you I want a job?

1187
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:01,201
Yes.

1188
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:13,042
Aren't you jobless?
- There are many who are jobless.

1189
01:49:13,137 --> 01:49:15,450
Will you give jobs
to all of them?

1190
01:49:15,921 --> 01:49:19,129
Everyone cannot come to me.
It's just that you

1191
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:20,721
You are taking pity on me?

1192
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:25,041
Why do you think
whoever comes to you

1193
01:49:25,521 --> 01:49:26,809
is begging for your kindness?

1194
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,801
I have to think, when I hear someone
committed suicide for not having a job

1195
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:33,681
That someone was thrown out
of the house for not paying rent.

1196
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:36,089
Or that he had to send his
mother and sister to the village.

1197
01:49:36,177 --> 01:49:38,326
And you feel pity for them.

1198
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,321
We may be poor, Mr.Sharma.
We may even have several needs.

1199
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:46,457
But you don't know
that love and sacrifice

1200
01:49:46,641 --> 01:49:48,561
eliminates all those lacking.

1201
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,960
We only don't have money,
but everything else.

1202
01:49:51,441 --> 01:49:52,729
What do you want to say?

1203
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,761
That you poor people have
only money, nothing else.

1204
01:49:56,241 --> 01:49:59,122
Look at yourself,
at your daughter.

1205
01:49:59,313 --> 01:50:02,772
And decide for yourself whether you
should take pity on someone else

1206
01:50:02,961 --> 01:50:03,921
or yourself.

1207
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:08,722
I didn't call you here
to advice me in my home.

1208
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:14,001
I'm sorry for having hurt
your feelings, Mr.Sharma.

1209
01:50:14,481 --> 01:50:16,881
Where my feelings are concerned.
Forget it.

1210
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,721
Do come to my house one day.

1211
01:50:21,201 --> 01:50:24,561
And see for yourself whether
you need me or I need you.

1212
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:26,001
Good day.

1213
01:50:38,481 --> 01:50:39,441
Come.

1214
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,681
How are you?
- I'm fine. Sit down.

1215
01:50:52,881 --> 01:50:54,321
What is the matter?

1216
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,161
I've come to discuss
a delicate matter.

1217
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:01,521
I don't know how to begin.
- Please tell me.

1218
01:51:03,441 --> 01:51:09,202
Arun's father wanted Arun
to marry your daughter.

1219
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:14,481
But Arun wants to marry Annie.

1220
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,841
In fact, he has
even proposed her.

1221
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:25,522
Alright, if he wants to marry
Annie, who can stop him.

1222
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,801
But Uma
- You don't have to pity Uma.

1223
01:51:32,241 --> 01:51:37,522
I wanted to keep my promise, or there
is no dearth of boys for my daughter.

1224
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:40,882
Sitaram had asked for her hand
for his son a few days ago.

1225
01:51:40,977 --> 01:51:45,047
Good! A big burden
is off my heart.

1226
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,601
And my heart too.
Instead, I am grateful to you.

1227
01:51:48,241 --> 01:51:50,008
Because Arun is not all that

1228
01:51:50,481 --> 01:51:52,881
Anyway, you fix this alliance
without hesitation.

1229
01:52:29,841 --> 01:52:34,162
Is Mr.Sitaram in?
...he's gone out? I'll call later.

1230
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,084
Sharma here.

1231
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,365
Where are you two going?

1232
01:52:47,121 --> 01:52:50,002
Have you lost your tongue?
Why don't you answer?

1233
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,321
We are going to Ashok's house.
- Ashok's house?

1234
01:52:54,481 --> 01:52:57,492
His mother and sister
are going to the village, so

1235
01:52:57,681 --> 01:52:59,601
Let them go to hell!
What have you got to do?

1236
01:52:59,697 --> 01:53:01,083
Go upstairs!

1237
01:53:02,312 --> 01:53:04,712
Sarla, I don't want Uma to be
friendly with any Tom Dick Harry.

1238
01:53:04,872 --> 01:53:05,832
Is that clear?

1239
01:53:29,092 --> 01:53:31,012
Ashok!
- Come in.

1240
01:53:31,508 --> 01:53:35,578
I have come already... What is
this you have done to yourself?

1241
01:53:37,172 --> 01:53:40,532
You are running a temperature!
- I was, it's comes down now.

1242
01:53:40,692 --> 01:53:43,256
Why didn't you inform us?

1243
01:53:43,411 --> 01:53:45,812
You could have come to
look me up.

1244
01:53:46,452 --> 01:53:50,936
You are right.
But Arun is so busy with his work.

1245
01:53:51,091 --> 01:53:53,492
And I...
- You are busy shopping.

1246
01:53:54,452 --> 01:53:58,293
When will the D-day come?
- D-day? What D-day?

1247
01:53:58,611 --> 01:54:01,176
Your marriage.
- Marriage?

1248
01:54:01,651 --> 01:54:05,492
Seeing your state, I feel like
marrying today, now itself!

1249
01:54:05,972 --> 01:54:09,813
Then at least Ma and Gauri will come,
& we won't have to see you like this.

1250
01:54:10,772 --> 01:54:12,212
Did you take medicine?

1251
01:54:13,652 --> 01:54:15,387
Why should I take medicine for fever?

1252
01:54:15,572 --> 01:54:19,413
And food?
- My neighbours send it.

1253
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:22,299
If that's the case,
why don't you go and stay there?

1254
01:54:22,611 --> 01:54:28,057
Because if I go there,
who will send me food from here?

1255
01:54:30,932 --> 01:54:34,292
Anita, Arun will be
very happy marrying you.

1256
01:54:34,772 --> 01:54:39,093
You are one in a million.
You have a clear heart.

1257
01:54:39,572 --> 01:54:45,813
Don't tell Arun this, or he'll say,
I don't have anything in my heart

1258
01:54:46,292 --> 01:54:47,580
nor my head.

1259
01:54:49,172 --> 01:54:54,453
Anita, my novel just got published.
Here's my first copy for you.

1260
01:54:54,932 --> 01:54:57,813
Wow! 'Anupama'.

1261
01:54:59,539 --> 01:55:02,136
Who is Anupama?

1262
01:55:03,091 --> 01:55:05,011
My imagination.

1263
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:08,373
Only imagination?
- Yes.

1264
01:55:09,332 --> 01:55:10,292
Is it?

1265
01:55:11,252 --> 01:55:13,172
This is your copy.

1266
01:55:14,132 --> 01:55:19,413
Uma, you are my Anupama.
Ashok.

1267
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:27,573
Ashok, you are a writer.
You can express your feelings.

1268
01:55:28,532 --> 01:55:29,972
But you cannot hide them.

1269
01:55:30,452 --> 01:55:35,733
I may sing, dance, prance around,
but don't forget

1270
01:55:36,212 --> 01:55:38,612
a woman's heart
beats within me.

1271
01:55:44,371 --> 01:55:48,693
I'll be back.
If Arun comes, ask him to wait.

1272
01:55:48,788 --> 01:55:53,501
But where are you going?
- To get your medicine.

1273
01:55:53,852 --> 01:55:55,992
I don't need medicine.

1274
01:56:01,212 --> 01:56:02,979
Come... come on!

1275
01:56:03,452 --> 01:56:04,892
You've brought the doctor along?

1276
01:56:04,987 --> 01:56:08,741
Yes, a doctor,
whose medicine can never fail.

1277
01:56:09,531 --> 01:56:14,977
Doctor, will you stay out?
Please come in... come.

1278
01:56:34,372 --> 01:56:41,094
Ashok, Uma can stand. But you
are sick, you should take rest.

1279
01:56:42,052 --> 01:56:43,787
Come Uma, sit down.

1280
01:56:43,972 --> 01:56:46,853
What are you waiting for?
Don't we have to get medicines?

1281
01:56:47,331 --> 01:56:49,251
Yes, but which medicine?

1282
01:56:49,732 --> 01:56:55,493
My great grandfather was a doctor.
I know all medicines.

1283
01:56:55,588 --> 01:56:57,934
Let's go.

1284
01:56:59,332 --> 01:57:04,613
Uma, you chat with Ashok.
I'll come and pick you up later.

1285
01:57:10,852 --> 01:57:11,812
Sit down.

1286
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:26,213
Since when have you been sick?
- Since 3-4 days.

1287
01:57:28,132 --> 01:57:30,532
You must have been in pain.

1288
01:57:32,451 --> 01:57:33,892
No, not really.

1289
01:57:35,619 --> 01:57:39,176
The novel I was writing that day,
has got published.

1290
01:57:40,612 --> 01:57:42,052
Here's your copy.

1291
01:57:50,691 --> 01:57:54,052
'Anupama'
What a nice name.

1292
01:57:55,491 --> 01:57:57,411
Do you know the
meaning of 'Anupama'?

1293
01:57:58,852 --> 01:58:02,693
One who is unique.
Incomparable!

1294
01:58:03,171 --> 01:58:07,012
Yes. But for me,
'Anupama' is you.

1295
01:58:09,891 --> 01:58:13,252
Yes Uma,
you are my Anupama.

1296
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:18,380
Whatever I saw you going through,
I merged it with my imagination

1297
01:58:18,531 --> 01:58:19,491
and wrote this novel.

1298
01:58:19,972 --> 01:58:23,628
If my imagination
and your life are same

1299
01:58:23,812 --> 01:58:26,212
I will consider my effort
worthwhile.

1300
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:41,572
Sarla, a prospective groom's
family is coming to see Uma.

1301
01:58:42,052 --> 01:58:44,933
Make arrangements for their welcome.
And ask Uma to get dressed.

1302
01:58:45,028 --> 01:58:49,295
But
- But what?

1303
01:58:49,412 --> 01:58:50,700
Uma has gone out today.

1304
01:58:51,652 --> 01:58:55,973
What! Uma has gone out?

1305
01:58:56,452 --> 01:58:58,372
Annie took her along.

1306
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:01,732
Annie?
- Yes.

1307
01:59:02,212 --> 01:59:03,652
She'll be back soon.

1308
01:59:09,892 --> 01:59:13,252
Any letter from Gauri or Ma?

1309
01:59:14,051 --> 01:59:15,656
Yes, I received one letter.

1310
01:59:16,612 --> 01:59:19,972
About me
- Yes, they enquired about you.

1311
01:59:20,931 --> 01:59:23,812
They had waited for you
before leaving for the village.

1312
01:59:26,691 --> 01:59:28,611
Even I hoped to meet them.

1313
01:59:30,052 --> 01:59:34,373
I see a lot of change
in the Uma of then and now.

1314
01:59:37,251 --> 01:59:41,573
What change?
- That you hope for something.

1315
01:59:42,051 --> 01:59:46,373
Hoping is beautiful.
Hoping is life.

1316
01:59:47,332 --> 01:59:51,173
You were asking what happened
next in the story.

1317
01:59:51,268 --> 01:59:55,021
Since that day,
there was a change in Uma.

1318
01:59:55,491 --> 01:59:59,813
The seed of hope burst,
and a leaf emerged

1319
01:59:59,908 --> 02:00:05,102
then another, and another,
and a plant grew.

1320
02:00:06,051 --> 02:00:11,333
Then? - The plant grew,
flowers bloomed.

1321
02:00:11,651 --> 02:00:14,695
Then...
- Annie has come!

1322
02:00:15,172 --> 02:00:18,532
I'll go home now.
Please sit, I'll come again.

1323
02:00:43,451 --> 02:00:46,495
Don't you dare step out of the house
again without my permission.

1324
02:00:46,972 --> 02:00:47,932
Go upstairs!

1325
02:01:21,051 --> 02:01:24,892
Hello, Mr.Sitaram.
Are you coming in the evening?

1326
02:01:26,332 --> 02:01:31,133
No, it's not that. Actually, my
health is deteriorating by the day.

1327
02:01:31,324 --> 02:01:34,499
So I want the marriage date
fixed at the earliest.

1328
02:01:35,932 --> 02:01:38,813
What?...yes... good day.

1329
02:01:47,471 --> 02:01:49,391
Who is it?
- Ashok here.

1330
02:01:49,872 --> 02:01:53,713
Oh, Ashok.
Yes, tell me.

1331
02:01:54,672 --> 02:01:58,032
Can I speak to Uma?
- Yes.

1332
02:02:11,952 --> 02:02:15,793
You are not keeping well.
Why did you come out?

1333
02:02:15,984 --> 02:02:20,403
I could not hold myself back. I'm
calling from a neighbor's place.

1334
02:02:20,592 --> 02:02:24,433
Look, I must tell
you this today.

1335
02:02:26,352 --> 02:02:27,312
What?

1336
02:02:27,631 --> 02:02:32,596
I just want to tell you
to consider us your family.

1337
02:02:33,072 --> 02:02:34,512
Consider our home your home.

1338
02:02:35,471 --> 02:02:37,391
You have full right over us.

1339
02:02:38,832 --> 02:02:42,192
If we can do anything for you

1340
02:02:42,672 --> 02:02:48,433
we, Gauri, Ma, me,
will consider it an honor.

1341
02:02:50,352 --> 02:02:51,792
Will you remember?

1342
02:03:00,912 --> 02:03:02,352
What happened, Uma?

1343
02:03:02,512 --> 02:03:03,472
What happened?

1344
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:07,633
I'm Sarla.
- Is Uma crying?

1345
02:03:08,111 --> 02:03:13,872
Yes. But why?
- Can I come and meet her today?

1346
02:03:15,312 --> 02:03:19,153
No, some people
are coming to see Uma.

1347
02:03:26,952 --> 02:03:28,392
Come dear, sit down.

1348
02:03:30,792 --> 02:03:34,633
Sharma insisted, that's
why we had to give you trouble.

1349
02:03:35,272 --> 02:03:37,192
Or there was no need to see you.

1350
02:03:37,512 --> 02:03:40,393
What is your name?
- Uma.

1351
02:03:40,488 --> 02:03:44,241
Wow! You are as
beautiful as your name.

1352
02:03:44,328 --> 02:03:50,482
You are right. She's a very nice
girl, in looks, and talent.

1353
02:03:50,952 --> 02:03:53,833
I didn't get married.
I don't regret that.

1354
02:03:54,792 --> 02:03:59,408
What I regret is that
if I'd got married,

1355
02:03:59,592 --> 02:04:02,473
even I'd have
a daughter like Uma.

1356
02:04:03,432 --> 02:04:06,313
That's why I sometimes
think I'll get married.

1357
02:04:11,112 --> 02:04:13,807
Then is the 6th confirmed?
- Yes.

1358
02:04:13,992 --> 02:04:16,687
Now we are more desperate
to take her home.

1359
02:04:16,872 --> 02:04:18,312
The sooner good things
are done, the better.

1360
02:04:18,792 --> 02:04:21,673
Mohan, the dinner arrangements
should be excellent.

1361
02:04:22,151 --> 02:04:25,512
Biryani, pulao!
I'll eat so much

1362
02:04:32,372 --> 02:04:33,812
What will happen now, Ashok?

1363
02:04:34,771 --> 02:04:38,132
I know the boy who
Uma is being married to.

1364
02:04:38,611 --> 02:04:40,531
Uma will never
be happy with him.

1365
02:04:40,912 --> 02:04:44,272
We must do something.
- But what can we do?

1366
02:04:44,432 --> 02:04:48,120
You can do everything. Why don't
you pull Uma out of that hell?

1367
02:04:48,272 --> 02:04:51,283
That will be wrong in principle.
- What principle?

1368
02:04:51,472 --> 02:04:54,832
I know very well Uma loves you,
and you love Uma.

1369
02:04:55,312 --> 02:04:57,047
Your going to the
village is just an excuse.

1370
02:04:57,232 --> 02:05:00,113
Why don't you say you are
trying to run away from here?

1371
02:05:00,208 --> 02:05:01,561
That you are trying to
shirk your responsibility.

1372
02:05:02,032 --> 02:05:04,432
I didn't know you
were such a coward.

1373
02:05:04,912 --> 02:05:06,352
Anita, I am not a coward.

1374
02:05:06,832 --> 02:05:10,488
But I don't want to impose
my views, my principles on her

1375
02:05:10,672 --> 02:05:13,072
like her father,
and make her a mental invalid.

1376
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:16,437
Like millions of parents have done
in this country with their children.

1377
02:05:17,392 --> 02:05:19,792
A person's freedom is as important
as a country's freedom.

1378
02:05:20,272 --> 02:05:22,192
And this freedom has to
be gained with one's own effort.

1379
02:05:22,671 --> 02:05:24,112
All those are bookish talks.

1380
02:05:24,591 --> 02:05:27,472
No Anita, these are
not bookish talks.

1381
02:05:27,952 --> 02:05:32,273
I had told Uma my doors
are always open for her.

1382
02:05:32,752 --> 02:05:36,112
It's her job
to walk up to my home now.

1383
02:05:36,592 --> 02:05:40,433
Pardon me Ashok, I am naive.

1384
02:05:41,392 --> 02:05:45,713
But I know that some people
can walk on their own.

1385
02:05:46,192 --> 02:05:50,993
While some need help.

1386
02:05:51,471 --> 02:05:55,312
But you won't understand this,
because you are a man.

1387
02:05:55,472 --> 02:05:57,239
You think with your brain.

1388
02:05:58,352 --> 02:06:04,441
Alright, do nothing,
and let her die a torturous death.

1389
02:06:08,751 --> 02:06:10,671
Where is Uma?
- In her room.

1390
02:06:15,952 --> 02:06:21,233
Uma, Ashok is leaving tomorrow
by the 10 am train.

1391
02:06:21,712 --> 02:06:23,152
He may never return.

1392
02:06:26,991 --> 02:06:29,872
I don't have to tell
you why he is leaving

1393
02:06:30,352 --> 02:06:34,193
That day, when you heard he is sick,
and came along with me

1394
02:06:34,384 --> 02:06:38,519
I knew your feelings for him,
and his for you.

1395
02:06:39,471 --> 02:06:41,872
Don't let this happen,
you'll ruin yourself.

1396
02:06:42,832 --> 02:06:46,673
Leave everything.
Break these fake bonds.

1397
02:06:47,632 --> 02:06:50,992
Even the whole world is no
compensation for love.

1398
02:06:52,911 --> 02:06:54,831
What are you afraid of?

1399
02:06:55,312 --> 02:07:00,593
You are so fortunate. You gave
love, you got love in return.

1400
02:07:01,072 --> 02:07:02,992
Don't let it go just like that.

1401
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:09,232
Uma, you can ruin your life, but
have no right to ruin Ashok's life.

1402
02:07:10,672 --> 02:07:14,993
When the heart breaks,
there is no sound.

1403
02:07:16,911 --> 02:07:21,712
If you reject his love,
even God won't accept you.

1404
02:07:22,671 --> 02:07:24,591
I cannot say any more.

1405
02:07:25,072 --> 02:07:28,913
Come with me... come.

1406
02:07:31,311 --> 02:07:38,033
Oh. I thought you were soft hearted.
But now I know you don't have a heart.

1407
02:07:38,512 --> 02:07:40,912
We were mistaken,
even Ashok was mistaken.

1408
02:07:42,352 --> 02:07:46,586
He simply wrote a book,
and dedicated it to you.

1409
02:07:47,152 --> 02:07:52,433
You! Who shattered
all his dreams, his hopes.

1410
02:08:31,312 --> 02:08:34,672
Anupama only understood the language
of flowers and birds.

1411
02:08:35,152 --> 02:08:39,473
But she was very uncomfortable
in the world of humans.

1412
02:08:39,952 --> 02:08:43,608
She never realized that the real
block was not outside, but within her.

1413
02:08:43,792 --> 02:08:44,752
Within her mind.

1414
02:08:46,191 --> 02:08:50,032
Anupama never left
that world of shadows.

1415
02:08:50,512 --> 02:08:55,313
Gradually, she had neither
expected, nor felt dejected.

1416
02:08:59,152 --> 02:09:01,552
One day, a stranger
came into Anupama's life.

1417
02:09:02,511 --> 02:09:08,272
What knocked her doors
with its lashes, was love.

1418
02:09:12,592 --> 02:09:18,833
Then, a question kept
hovering in her mind.

1419
02:09:19,312 --> 02:09:23,480
Anupama, why are you hesitant?
What dilemma is this?

1420
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:27,472
You rule your heart,
you can do as you please.

1421
02:09:29,391 --> 02:09:32,567
And then came a day, when
Anupama came out of the web

1422
02:09:32,752 --> 02:09:34,192
she had spun herself.

1423
02:09:34,672 --> 02:09:40,433
She saw the morning sun waiting
to welcome her with open arms.

1424
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:47,157
Only one voice echoed
in her heart, 'I will go!'

1425
02:10:36,192 --> 02:10:37,152
Keep it here.

1426
02:10:51,551 --> 02:10:53,471
The token of acceptance
has come, go and accept it.

1427
02:10:57,792 --> 02:11:02,593
What happened?
- Sir, return it all.

1428
02:11:04,512 --> 02:11:07,872
What do you mean?
- This is not a token

1429
02:11:08,352 --> 02:11:10,752
it is the message
of death for Uma.

1430
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:15,073
I cannot see my daughter being
sacrificed right before my eyes.

1431
02:11:15,264 --> 02:11:18,439
What nonsense are you talking!
- I am stating a fact.

1432
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:21,793
Uma is not only your daughter,
she is my daughter too.

1433
02:11:21,888 --> 02:11:25,641
I may not have sired her,
but I have reared her.

1434
02:11:26,111 --> 02:11:28,512
I have seen her
grow up everyday.

1435
02:11:28,991 --> 02:11:34,273
I know what she desires,
what she craves.

1436
02:11:34,751 --> 02:11:36,671
Stop that nonsense!
Is this a joke?

1437
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,883
Her token of marriage has come,
so many guests are expected.

1438
02:11:39,072 --> 02:11:43,240
I cannot see her being
murdered like that.

1439
02:11:43,391 --> 02:11:45,792
If you cannot bear it?
Get out of here!

1440
02:11:46,752 --> 02:11:51,553
I will go away.
I am a servant after all.

1441
02:11:52,991 --> 02:11:57,313
If your wife was alive,
would she allow this marriage?

1442
02:11:58,272 --> 02:12:02,593
No, she would never allow her
Uma's life to be ruined like that.

1443
02:12:33,432 --> 02:12:39,193
Father...
- Do even you want to say something?

1444
02:12:43,011 --> 02:12:48,772
No father, I have come
to take your blessing.

1445
02:12:51,172 --> 02:12:56,933
I am leaving
this home forever.

1446
02:13:01,732 --> 02:13:06,533
As soon as I came into this world,
I snatched what was most dearest to you.

1447
02:13:07,971 --> 02:13:11,332
Wonder what place mom must have
created for herself in your heart

1448
02:13:12,292 --> 02:13:16,133
that seeing me,
you are reminded of her.

1449
02:13:18,531 --> 02:13:22,853
Maybe that is why
you never forgave me.

1450
02:13:24,772 --> 02:13:30,533
Bless me to make the same place
for myself in someone's heart

1451
02:13:31,492 --> 02:13:34,373
that mom had made
for herself in your heart.

1452
02:13:54,532 --> 02:13:59,333
You are blessing me, father.
Shall I go?

1453
02:14:19,492 --> 02:14:23,813
Father, I know
how lonely you are.

1454
02:14:25,252 --> 02:14:29,093
I will come
whenever you call me.

1455
02:14:35,331 --> 02:14:37,732
The token has come?
Where is Mohan?

1456
02:14:37,828 --> 02:14:38,788
Upstairs.

1457
02:14:45,731 --> 02:14:48,296
Uma, what happened, dear?

1458
02:14:50,212 --> 02:14:52,132
I am leaving, uncle.

1459
02:14:54,052 --> 02:14:56,933
Leaving?
What is the matter?

1460
02:14:58,371 --> 02:15:00,772
Nothing.
- There is something.

1461
02:15:01,732 --> 02:15:05,092
I am like your father.
Tell me.

1462
02:15:06,532 --> 02:15:11,148
I am going forever.
- What!! Have you gone crazy?

1463
02:15:11,332 --> 02:15:13,580
The guests have arrived.
- Let me go, uncle.

1464
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:16,132
No! Be sensible.
What behavior is this?

1465
02:15:16,228 --> 02:15:18,279
Have you given a thought
of what will become of your father?

1466
02:15:18,564 --> 02:15:20,364
He will not be able
to face anyone.

1467
02:15:20,451 --> 02:15:22,852
His honor will be disgraced.
- Let me go, uncle.

1468
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:24,334
No, I won't let you go.

1469
02:15:26,051 --> 02:15:27,011
Let her go, Moses.

1470
02:15:59,332 --> 02:16:00,772
Have you come to meet Ashok?

1471
02:16:02,531 --> 02:16:04,136
He has left for the station.

1472
02:16:13,732 --> 02:16:16,132
Sarla, go home.

1473
02:16:17,572 --> 02:16:19,492
Father has no one in the world.

1474
02:16:20,452 --> 02:16:24,108
Come quickly.
- I won't go back home, uncle.

1475
02:16:24,292 --> 02:16:27,652
I have not come to take you
back home. Hurry! or we'll be late.

1476
02:16:51,651 --> 02:16:55,492
The train is about to leave.
You also go.

1477
02:16:55,972 --> 02:17:00,773
Truly speaking, I don't
like this 'see-off' ritual.

1478
02:17:03,652 --> 02:17:07,973
Anita, don't be sad,
life is like that.

1479
02:17:08,931 --> 02:17:12,292
Ashok, don't give me
those high funda talks.

1480
02:17:13,252 --> 02:17:17,573
If this is life,
why live at all?

1481
02:17:18,052 --> 02:17:20,452
I don't believe
in these things. I...

1482
02:17:30,532 --> 02:17:32,452
Ashok, look!

1483
02:17:44,932 --> 02:17:48,937
You had said that
whenever I want...

1484
02:17:49,732 --> 02:17:52,613
Yes Uma... come.

1485
02:17:53,237 --> 02:17:55,237
