00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:28,690
'Man chanting Shloka'

2
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:34,656
Sanskrit chants

3
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:41,765
Sanskrit chants

4
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,067
Sanskrit chants

5
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,641
Panditji what are you doing??

6
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:58,821
Sanskrit chants

7
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,424
Sanskrit chants

8
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:17,500
This is my family.

9
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,747
I'm putting them to rest.

10
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:36,120
Peace be upon them.

11
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,822
Peace be upon them.

12
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,296
Peace be upon them.

13
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,135
In November,
the Indan Prime Minister

14
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,143
toured the world

15
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,736
to explain again the gravity
of the situation

16
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,416
In capital after capital,
she pleads the Bengali cause

17
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,413
In London she has asked
what can be done

18
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,215
to stop the refugee accidents

19
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,556
Well surely that the massacre
there stops the rape stops

20
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:13,695
The burning of villages stop.

21
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,027
Can it not be
fair to put to you

22
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,066
that you are
contributing in a way

23
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,692
to the exodus of
the refugees by

24
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,736
your support of
Pakistan Guerillas.

25
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,403
And mustn't you,
in effect...

26
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,600
face the question of
having to reduce your support

27
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,474
for the Guerilla army which is
operating in East Pakistan.

28
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,714
Well, that means we allow
a massacre to continue?

29
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:34,481
What happened first?

30
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,550
How many people
were killed according to

31
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:39,088
your correspondent
of British Newspapers?

32
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,087
Of American Newspapers?
Of French Newspapers?

33
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:46,123
Canadian Newspapers,
Arabian Newspapers.

34
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:50,798
The massacre began long before
there was a single Guerilla.

35
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,100
But if the contribution
to quietening

36
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,104
of the situation
as I say--

37
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,538
No, what does quietening mean?
Does it mean

38
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,237
that we allow,
we support the genocide?

39
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:04,672
And do you think
it can be stopped?

40
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,647
Do you think people are
going to sit aside

41
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:09,014
and watch their women
raped in front of them?

42
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,588
And say that, no, we are going
to quieten the situation.

43
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,082
That's not quietness.

44
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,252
That is the worst possible
type of war

45
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,455
It is the worst
possible type of violence.

46
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,427
But how then without
something done to control

47
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,661
the Guerilla activity
in return for

48
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,136
greater discipline
by the Pakistan Army

49
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,796
can we secure this first step?

50
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,666
When Hitler was on the rampage

51
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,203
why didn't you say
let's keep quiet

52
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,473
let's have peace with Germany

53
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,036
and let the Jews die or

54
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:41,481
let Belgium die, let France die!
Would you say that was quiet?

55
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:47,650
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

56
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:50,783
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

57
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:55,189
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

58
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,466
But why Joi Bangla?

59
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,005
Why not Joi Bengali ?

60
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,574
Speak up.

61
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:14,283
Bengali is our language,
Islam is our religion.

62
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,587
But Bangladesh
is our everything!

63
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,281
Joi Bangla!

64
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,016
Joi Bangla!

65
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:24,718
Joi Bangla!

66
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:28,292
And that is why,
I am first a Bangladeshi,...

67
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:30,792
then Bengali

68
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,765
and then a Muslim

69
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,278
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

70
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,338
This may be my final message.

71
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,467
From this day onwards...

72
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,471
Bangladesh is independent!

73
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,454
I call upon the people
of Bangladesh!

74
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:27,052
Wherever you might be

75
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:29,619
and with whatever you have

76
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:34,720
to resist the army of
occupation till the last.

77
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,692
Your struggle must go on

78
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,064
until the last soldier

79
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,571
of the Pakistani occupation
army is expelled

80
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,234
fro in the so of
Bangladesh

81
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,104
Final victory is ours

82
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,742
Joi Bangla!

83
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,387
From this day onwards

84
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,485
Bangladesh is independent!

85
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,260
I call upon
the people of Bangladesh...

86
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,430
How many times are you
going to listen to it?

87
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,569
Just a little while longer.
I am almost done.

88
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,535
Please play it or else
I won't be able to write.

89
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,705
You'll go mad!

90
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,273
See' the boy has already come
to take the article.

91
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,406
Bangladesh...
Wherever you might be...

92
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,682
and with whatever you have...

93
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,381
to resist the army of...

94
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,020
He won't come inside.

95
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,517
Say's he is in a hurry.

96
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,390
Your struggle must go on!

97
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,324
He's coming.

98
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,367
Last night' the president'
the Pakistani army..

99
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,540
The 'bindi'
really suits you'...

100
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,149
now you can listen to
whatever you like.

101
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,165
Here.

102
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:17,662
- Go quickly.
- Yes.

103
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:19,379
Were you expecting someone?

104
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:21,685
No.

105
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,250
Let me check.

106
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:25,688
Don't go.

107
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:29,663
Ok go!

108
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,630
These people forced me to...

109
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:48,777
It's so noisy in here.

110
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,219
Turn on the lights.

111
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,160
Now we can talk in peace.

112
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,440
Thank you.

113
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,309
What do you want?

114
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,615
Nothing!

115
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:34,256
But you seem to
want freedom'...

116
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,455
isn't it?

117
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,192
You can do
whatever you want'...

118
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,166
but you can't stop Bangladesh
from becoming a free nation.

119
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,140
Do whatever you want?

120
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,777
These are strong words...

121
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,117
do whatever you want

122
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:03,719
and yet you use
them so carelessly...

123
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,183
I have a big house in Lahore

124
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:33,312
where my parents'
my brothers' sisters'

125
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,616
my two aunts'
uncles and their children

126
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:44,191
by god's grace
its a big family

127
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,533
and all of us
live under one roof

128
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:53,132
but if one day my brother
comes to me and says

129
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,108
divide this house into two

130
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:59,810
then I will divide
him into so many pieces'

131
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,117
that he will forget
how to count.

132
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,157
See?

133
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:18,155
The mere mention of a divide

134
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,428
has brought
tears to your eyes.

135
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,695
- Scoundrel!
- Amir!

136
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,640
How had that
child wronged you?

137
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,632
How have we wronged you?

138
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,475
Not me

139
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,582
but yes

140
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,051
you have wronged Pakistan!

141
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,724
We haven't done
anything to anybody,

142
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,296
we have nothing to
do with your Pakistan!

143
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,788
'Your Pakistan'?

144
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:57,194
Then you will say 'your I slam'

145
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,573
'your Allah'.

146
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:03,174
There is only one Allah!

147
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,244
Islam is also one

148
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,409
and so is Pakistan!

149
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,682
That's why not yours,
not mine,

150
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,623
but ours.

151
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,055
You only explain to him...

152
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:24,496
You fool!

153
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:32,698
If only we had continued
this tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte...

154
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,243
you would've been
in a better position.

155
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:40,376
Remember, you are
the one to have ended it.

156
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,242
Hey!

157
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,549
You have a lot of love
for your Bangladesh isn't it?

158
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,288
Now watch,

159
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,698
while I disrobe your love.

160
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,569
Scoundrel!

161
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:45,306
Leave her alone you animal.

162
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,483
Abbu, please play a song.

163
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,563
Open your mouth!

164
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,433
Abbu, he's looking at me!

165
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,023
Kausar...

166
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:11,627
- Kausar!
- Yes?

167
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,605
Where are Abbu and Ammi?

168
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,733
They have gone to get food,

169
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,235
must be on their way back.

170
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,438
When did they go?

171
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,277
While you were sleeping.

172
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,576
Will they come soon?

173
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,229
Is there anything to eat?

174
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,194
Eat a guava.

175
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,295
They have worms in them.

176
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,096
So what?

177
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:52,136
Not all of them are spoilt,

178
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,108
should I find you one?

179
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:56,104
Yes.

180
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:39,484
- Can you see them?
- No.

181
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,486
Look properly.

182
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,353
I can't see them,

183
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,483
can't see anyone.

184
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,220
You come down, let me climb.

185
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,520
Come down, let me see.

186
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,207
Do you think they heard me?

187
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:11,245
Lets go and look for them.

188
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:17,114
What if they come
here while we are gone?

189
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:25,394
They told me to wait here.

190
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,173
It will be scary at night.

191
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,739
Why?

192
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,103
You're not a child.

193
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:39,113
Not like you are an old man.

194
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,424
Lets go find them!

195
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,119
No.

196
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,120
They will come back here.

197
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,224
Rafiq!

198
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:05,263
Rafiq!

199
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:29,491
Rafiq!

200
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:31,191
Rafiq!

201
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:35,570
Rafiq!

202
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,669
Your Radio!

203
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,660
What else did your teacher
tell you about demons?

204
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:50,745
That they are

205
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,248
made of fire...

206
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,740
And what does fire do?

207
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,110
It burns!

208
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,653
Has everything burnt to ashes?

209
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,392
Everything!

210
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,243
Torch.

211
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:34,719
Open it.

212
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,708
Take all these
women and wash them'

213
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:04,309
I don't like filth.

214
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,785
Yes Sir!

215
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:10,691
Get up.

216
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:13,360
Get up!
Make everyone stand!

217
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:15,089

Move!

220
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,499
Where is everyone!

221
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:25,463
Take them!

222
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,074
Move!

223
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:30,544
Move!

224
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:36,116
Stand here!

225
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,652
Move!

226
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,156
Move!

227
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:22,095
Clothes off, everybody.

228
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,747

Forty.

232
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,094

00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:36,320
Take them away.

Move.

257
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:04,989
Stand behind her.

00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:40,488
Thirteen.

262
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,620

- Wow!

266
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,742
Splendid Sir,
god has willed it.

267
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,475
Sanober,
Twenty Four years old.

268
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:02,149

269
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:04,285

00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,210

271
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,221

00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,351
Fifteen.

273
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,052
Fifteen?

274
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:15,186
Yes Sir!

275
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,529
These women
are not here for you...

276
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:24,271
they are here to
serve our nation!

277
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,171
- Saleha...
- Hey!

278
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:32,179
The children that are born
from their wombs...

279
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:35,339
will be theirs
as well as ours.

280
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,520
God willing, they'll dissolve
the difference between

281
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,087
West and East Pakistan.

282
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,123
Yes Sir.

283
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:49,128
They will be
Pakistan's children.

284
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,795
Yes Sir.

285
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,159
So fifteen or sixteen?

286
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,428
Fif.. fif..

287
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,172
- Sixteen Sir.
- Tofail!

288
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,599
Yes Sir.

289
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,303
Fifteen?
Or Sixteen?

290
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,241
Sir, I think...

291
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,106
sixteen.

292
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,678
You think?

293
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:13,721
You think?

294
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,688
The difference between
fifteen and sixteen

295
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,386
is not a mere number.

296
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,325
It's the difference
of an entire generation.

297
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:25,196
Yes Sir.

298
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,668
- Doctor.
- Sir.

299
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:30,401
Make sure all these women...

300
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:32,567
can have children.

301
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:36,371
And if possible'
more than one.

302
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,148
And those who can't

303
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,482
have no reason to live.

304
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,095
Understand?

305
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,663
Yes Sir!

306
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:58,097
Then why the hell are
you still standing here?

307
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,100
Go.

308
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:01,629
Yes Sir!

309
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,261
Listen!

310
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,431
Come here.

311
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,370
- Ok go.
- Okay.

312
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,393
Marvelous!

313
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,508
Dirty.

314
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:49,283
Dirty.

315
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:52,684
Dirty.

316
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,726
Dirty.

317
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,190
Dirty.

318
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,597
Dirty.

319
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,669
Dirty.

320
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:20,774
Dirty.

321
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:38,163
Where are we?

322
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,402
Dirty.

323
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,139
Where?

324
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:56,248
Didi where am I?

325
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,452
In Hell.

326
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,233
They couldn't even
find Fida's body?

327
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:21,265
It's so dark in here.

328
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,605
Your friends are
here to see you.

329
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,381
I'll call them here.

330
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:44,091
Amir, It's good to see
you are recovering well.

331
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:48,265
Brother Amir,
we were just telling Mohsin

332
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:50,535
that he must move
out of this house.

333
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:52,436
We have already
discussed this matter,

334
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,167
why do you need to talk
about it in front of him...

335
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:55,265
Listen.

336
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:56,810
I am not like an Ostrich

337
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:58,407
which buries It's
head in the sand

338
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:00,480
and thinks
that the danger has passed.

339
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,381
Amir is very lucky

340
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,777
that he is still alive.

341
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,781
You, him or I

342
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:10,723
might not be able to
survive the next attack.

343
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,092
And you know

344
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,288
that they are going
to attack again.

345
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,425
So you mean,

346
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,325
we should run every
time we see danger?

347
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:23,204
We can run,

348
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,372
but what about
those who can't?

349
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,299
We are not social workers.

350
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,335
We are journalists!

351
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,772
Our job is not to
stop these brutal crimes,

352
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:36,149
but to write about them.

353
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,348
Only if we are alive'
will we be able to write.

354
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,180
No,

355
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:45,817
that's not the way.

356
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:49,760
If we write only
then will we be alive.

357
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,533
Otherwise our bodies
might live on,

358
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,101
but our conscience
will surely die!

359
00:34:57,672 --> 00:34:59,106
Amir you have no idea what has

360
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:00,402
has been going on here
for the last three days.

361
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:01,507
You were unconscious...

362
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,771
- During this...
- I was unconscious,

363
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,104
but I am awake now.

364
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,311
I know

365
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:15,219
what we must do...

366
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:21,728
we must gather,

367
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:24,364
not just journalists,

368
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,599
we will include every one.

369
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:30,027
Munawar bhai, Selina,
Rashid Sahb,

370
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:32,430
Scientists,
Students, Teachers,

371
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,535
we must come together
and form a strategy,

372
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,737
and we will write,

373
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:40,245
we will report things.

374
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,546
I will be the first to write

375
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:43,208
and tell people
what I have gone through.

376
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:52,151
What?

377
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:55,561
Am I not making
any sense to you?

378
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,358
Amir, wasn't I telling you,
in the last three days...

379
00:35:57,465 --> 00:36:01,095
I couldn't even
recognize Selina's body.

380
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:08,738
Munawar, Rashid Sahb,..

381
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:13,272
Mannan, Zahirul,...

382
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,013
Chakraborty...

383
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,518
all of them have been...

384
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:30,120
I thought

385
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,500
I was the only one.

386
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,504
Even Fida wasn't the only one.

387
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,346
I know what I have to do.

388
00:36:56,624 --> 00:36:58,524
Where is the phone?

389
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:13,030
The school children sang songs

390
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,508
and the principal praise

391
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:19,679
the efforts of the
American government.

392
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:23,575
One moment.

393
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:27,145
Hello?

394
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:29,152
They are waging war.

395
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:31,782
Only you I know
can do something about it.

396
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:35,152
Amir, I understand.

397
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:38,724
But please realize, our powers
have been taken away.

398
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,597
I'm really
in no position to...

399
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:43,761
It will give me
a sense of pleasure

400
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,506
if you let me
see her body please.

401
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,549
Please do something.

402
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,675
I overheard
they've let some women live.

403
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:00,447
Please, help me find Fida.

404
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:03,046
I'll be indebted to you
for the rest of my life.

405
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,751
Are you listening?

406
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,750
Can we meet?

407
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,624
I can come to Dhaka
if you want.

408
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:39,455
Hey, get out!

409
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,188
Get of the bus.
Old man!

410
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,697
Get of.

411
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,065
I will kill you!

412
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,473
Silence!

413
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,080
Silence!

414
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:36,742
Look here'
this is 'pul-e-sirat'.

415
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:39,246
The bridge over hell.

416
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:42,687
H ell on this side
and heaven on the other.

417
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,722
Will you run?

418
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,289
Run!

419
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:49,362
Run now.

420
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:51,659
Run!

421
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:44,446
Rafiq!

422
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:45,710
Rafiq!

423
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,810
- What is it?
- Come quickly!

424
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,823
Coming.

425
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,086
Come now!

426
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:02,696
You want to see something?

427
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:16,548
There is more here.

428
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:20,613
- So much!
- What?

429
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,315
So much rice!

430
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:42,108
Kaki knew so many stories.

431
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:47,772
We've buried everyone...

432
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,844
Uncle Rasool, Batulan,

433
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,119
brother Kamrul,

434
00:41:59,593 --> 00:42:01,493
brother Akbar,

435
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,494
- Moulvi Sahb, Master Sahb...
- Only Abbu and Ammi...

436
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:09,163
...and we have cremated Kaki.

437
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,536
Now we can go.

438
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:14,270
Where?

439
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,167
Anywhere'

440
00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:20,606
we've buried everyone,

441
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,738
our job is done.

442
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,059
...but Kaki doesn't
have a grave.

443
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,086
Where should
we write her name?

444
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:39,295
Should we write
it on her house?

445
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,335
There, on that wall.

446
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:47,267
I'll write it.

447
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,361
Kausar!

448
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,497
Pakistani!

449
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:25,502
No there are women too.

450
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,111
You go and hide.

451
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:33,145
Let me check.

452
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,686
Who are you?

453
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,127
What are you doing here,
alone?

454
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:15,787
This is my village!

455
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:20,122
Then where are the
rest of the villagers?

456
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,605
There.

457
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:41,586
We are travellers,

458
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,823
we need a place to stay.

459
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,622
There is no place here.

460
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,524
- Listen...
- Let me handle this.

461
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,757
We are all very tired,

462
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:54,427
even the animals.

463
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,131
We all need rest.

464
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,332
Just one night?

465
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:02,075
Yes,

466
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:05,043
we will leave with
the first light.

467
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:08,378
What will we get?

468
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:15,086
What will you get!

469
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,750
What can you get from us?

470
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,720
Then you can't stay.

471
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:27,024
Alright.

472
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:30,632
Alright.

473
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:35,569
We have rice...

474
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:43,811
He has eaten, just a handful
of rice after two long days.

475
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:47,518
I am his sister,

476
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:51,717
It's just the two
of us in this village.

477
00:45:52,826 --> 00:45:55,420
We were afraid, the
Pakistanis were approaching.

478
00:45:58,332 --> 00:46:00,300
We are like you son.

479
00:46:01,435 --> 00:46:04,302
Whatever we have,
is all yours.

480
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,743
Come on!
Set the stove,

481
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:15,281
we have two guests
with us tonight.

482
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:18,718
This is Mariyam.

483
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,018
I am Kausar and this is Rafiq.

484
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:26,091
Come.

485
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,660
- Who was that boy?
- My brother.

486
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:50,550
Sister, sing a song.

487
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:55,382
Bengali Folk Song

488
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:14,138
Okay.

489
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:22,375
Baba.

490
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,279
What is this dear?

491
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:25,749
There is a tradition
in our village,

492
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:28,747
when a child is born,
we eat 'ladoos'.

493
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,216
...but so much rice!

494
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:34,616
Kaki left it behind...

495
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:37,357
...she will not mind.

496
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:02,146
Come, come.

497
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,690
Why are you crying?

498
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,529
Well done Rafiq.
I think he likes the song.

499
00:49:29,442 --> 00:49:31,308
Our government has failed
to denounce

500
00:49:31,378 --> 00:49:33,142
the suppression of democracy.

501
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,572
Our government has failed to
take forceful measures

502
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,150
to protect its citizens.

503
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,748
While at the same time,
bending over backwards

504
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,751
to placate the West Pakistan
dominated government.

505
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,318
And to lessen
any deservedly negative

506
00:49:45,392 --> 00:49:48,555
international public relations
impact against them.

507
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,098
Our government has evidence
what many will consider

508
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,638
moral bankruptcy.

509
00:49:58,738 --> 00:50:01,105
But we have chosen,
not to intervene.

510
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:04,508
Even morally, on the grounds
that the Awami conflict,

511
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:06,340
in which unfortunately

512
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:09,449
the over-worked term genocide
is applicable,

513
00:50:09,616 --> 00:50:13,382
is purely an internal matter
of the sovereign state.

514
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:17,682
Private Americans have
expressed disgust.

515
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:22,194
We, as professional civil
servants express our dissent

516
00:50:22,262 --> 00:50:23,593
with current policy

517
00:50:23,697 --> 00:50:27,565
and fervently hope that our true
and lasting interests here

518
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:31,126
can be defined and
our politics redirected.

519
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,741
You know, I would really love
for you to stay here.

520
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:45,785
I know.

521
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:47,679
Thank you.

522
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,151
But I can't.

523
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:53,724
I need to write
what I have seen and

524
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,653
it might put you into trouble if
I write sitting in your house.

525
00:50:58,331 --> 00:51:00,129
Thank you for understanding.

526
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:02,292
You know I will not give up
that easily.

527
00:51:02,636 --> 00:51:05,128
I'll cause a ruckus in
the corridors of power.

528
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,173
There is hope, Amir.

529
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:12,742
Take this.

530
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:16,210
Meet him.
He'll know what to do.

531
00:51:22,055 --> 00:51:27,721
Good-bye Kha-mi-da bibi

532
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:36,064
Good-bye Ba-arsh-in

533
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:07,091
You know son,

534
00:52:08,468 --> 00:52:10,527
these people will
always be here,

535
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:12,469
in their own village.

536
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:16,809
You will be able to
find them whenever you want.

537
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:29,483
They don't need you anymore.

538
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:32,723
But we do.

539
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,627
Mariyam has a lot
to learn from you

540
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,255
Yes.

541
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:40,163
And Razia also needs you

542
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,291
to help calm her baby.

543
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:51,303
Then a day will come,
when you will return

544
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:53,703
amongst your people.

545
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,739
We will also come with you,

546
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,181
en route our village.

547
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:02,084
We will come together.

548
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:04,319
Come with us.

549
00:53:09,262 --> 00:53:12,698
Good-bye Ro-ona aapa

550
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:27,213
You know that we are
going to Charghat, don't you?

551
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:31,081
The same place you had
promised your father to go to.

552
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:37,554
Said bye to everyone.

553
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:43,086
Alright.

554
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:48,225
Ok then,

555
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:50,803
may god be your guardian.

556
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:09,481
Kausar, why don't the two
of you also come with us?

557
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,581
Why do you want
to stay here alone?

558
00:54:19,766 --> 00:54:21,495
Get up! Let's go.

559
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,126
Come on.

560
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:25,303
I will come along.

561
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:31,308
Rafiq! Come.

562
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:33,374

573
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:54,626
<i>We are where we were</i>

574
00:55:54,727 --> 00:56:00,496
<i>but our world
has drifted away</i>

575
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:07,006
<i>Our own shadows have left us</i>

576
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:16,439
<i>Our shadows have left us</i>

577
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:20,383
<i>to become one with the night</i>

578
00:56:20,486 --> 00:56:24,423
<i>Would you extend a hand</i>

579
00:56:24,524 --> 00:56:28,290
<i>and listen to the
woes of our hearts?</i>

580
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:31,625
<i>Soaked in tears</i>

581
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:36,168

588
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:55,546
<i>Once again a lonely cloud</i>

589
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:59,516
<i>has wandered from its course</i>

590
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:04,557
<i>A song that was
not yet complete</i>

591
00:58:11,497 --> 00:58:15,434
<i>A song that was
not yet complete</i>

592
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:19,267
<i>has lost its tune

593
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:24,003
<i>A dream trickles from the eye</i>

594
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,307
<i>and shatters as it falls</i>

595
00:58:27,413 --> 00:58:31,350
<i>Your memory is now</i>

<i>we look for fragments

599
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:10,748
<i>A part of my heart
still questions time</i>

600
00:59:19,065 --> 00:59:26,665
<i>A part of my heart
still questions time</i>

601
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:30,710
<i>What disrespect did I show?</i>

602
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,537
<i>What was my sin?</i>

603
00:59:34,747 --> 00:59:39,446
<i>The little story of our hearts</i>

604
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:50,562
<i>The little story of our hearts</i>

605
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:54,497
<i>still remains unfinished</i>

606
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,537
<i>Why was this sadness</i>

607
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:02,302
<i>forced upon our smiles?</i>

608
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:06,436
<i>Why does my heart</i>

609
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:10,414
<i>feel this piercing pain?</i>

610
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:14,453
<i>In the darkness of our reality</i>

611
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,320
<i>we look for fragments
of our existence</i>

612
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:04,068
I 've said this
many times before,

613
01:01:06,138 --> 01:01:12,305
I don't like filth!

614
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:18,550
And then...

615
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,521
what's wrong in
what I'm saying?

616
01:01:29,528 --> 01:01:31,326
No.

617
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:38,501
Abstain from anger.

618
01:01:42,508 --> 01:01:44,602
Anger is a sin.

619
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:50,273
Anger is the
work of the devil.

620
01:01:56,122 --> 01:01:58,318
Would you like to kill me?

621
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:03,629
I don't appreciate threats.

622
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:07,459
And I'm not
one bit afraid of death.

623
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,267
But who can trust
you and your mood swings?

624
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:19,678
A little annoyance and

625
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,741
game over!

626
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,825
Just divulge this one secret,

627
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:41,596
getting annoyed
at every little thing

628
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:48,062
getting displeased,
getting irked

629
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:54,203
where have you learnt
all these traits?

630
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,285
Swear to the gods

631
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,518
I tolerate a lot
of your tantrums.

632
01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:06,657
Isn't it?

633
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:11,697
All right,

634
01:03:12,765 --> 01:03:14,563
as you wish

635
01:03:15,468 --> 01:03:17,596
I'm but a slave
to your wishes.

636
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:43,060
No! Listen!

637
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,146
Now tell me,

638
01:04:03,182 --> 01:04:05,150
what is it you like?

639
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:08,711
The waist?

640
01:04:10,022 --> 01:04:13,151
Or would you like
to go through her heart?

641
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:20,226
Dirty

642
01:04:33,345 --> 01:04:34,744
Dirty

643
01:04:36,282 --> 01:04:38,046
Dirty

644
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,658
Happy?

645
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:51,721
Dirty

646
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:57,559
Dirty

647
01:05:01,707 --> 01:05:03,436
Dirty

648
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:06,404
Open it!

649
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:08,537
They are ashamed of this,

650
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,080
not of what they
do in broad daylight.

651
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,649
You know Amir,

652
01:05:20,192 --> 01:05:22,661
there are three breeds
of men who come here.

653
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:29,395
First, the kind that imposes
his manhood at gunpoint.

654
01:05:30,169 --> 01:05:32,604
Second,
those pretentious 'god men'

655
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:35,538
who call themselves
Al Badr and Al Shams

656
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:40,774
and then,
that patriotic snitch

657
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,811
who with all his loyalty,
betrays the country!

658
01:05:44,683 --> 01:05:47,175
The Pakistanis
call them Razakars.

659
01:05:50,256 --> 01:05:52,122
- What's the news?
- The informer is here.

660
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:54,716
- If you say...
- Listen to me.

661
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:58,388
If you don't give
me good news...

662
01:05:59,532 --> 01:06:01,466
I will kill you.

663
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:04,468
By creating them, the
Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan,

664
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:07,039
had made it certain

665
01:06:07,606 --> 01:06:10,735
that while the Al Badir
makes every night darker,

666
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:12,704
the Al Shams will
make sure that

667
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:15,208
every morning is stained
with the colour of blood.

668
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:24,484
Kushtiya, Jinjira, Chittagong

669
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,285
It's the same
story everywhere.

670
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:33,598
Sure the Mukti Bahini
is fighting but,

671
01:06:35,301 --> 01:06:36,632
how do we fight against guns
and bullets

672
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:39,397
with just sticks and sickles?

673
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,032
We can fight with the pen.

674
01:06:43,776 --> 01:06:46,268
They attacked me because

675
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:49,444
they were afraid of
the power of my words.

676
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:53,314
Like me, they targeted
journalists, teachers,

677
01:06:53,786 --> 01:06:55,754
professors,
scientists, thinkers

678
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:59,252
and all those who
they felt threatened by.

679
01:06:59,825 --> 01:07:01,224
Why?

680
01:07:02,628 --> 01:07:05,689
Because they knew these were
the real guardians of freedom.

681
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:09,398
We will have to instil this
fear within their ranks again.

682
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,165
We should take
out a newspaper.

683
01:07:13,672 --> 01:07:16,141
We will tell the whole
world about their cruelty.

684
01:07:16,642 --> 01:07:18,610
And what will the world do?

685
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:20,602
The same thing
that our friend,

686
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,511
Archer Blood's government did?

687
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,145
No one will listen, Amir.

688
01:07:27,186 --> 01:07:28,517
The outside world
does not care

689
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,688
and will the people here,

690
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:33,520
read the newspaper
or save their lives?

691
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,691
The world is ignoring
us today because

692
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:39,594
we are not important to them,

693
01:07:40,499 --> 01:07:42,661
but the day we kill
three or four of them

694
01:07:43,168 --> 01:07:44,658
they will take note of us.

695
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,337
Our government
has been formed.

696
01:07:51,543 --> 01:07:52,169
What?

697
01:07:52,244 --> 01:07:53,575
Last night in Boidanathola,

698
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:56,046
the Awami League
formed the government.

699
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:58,239
- Really!
- Yes!

700
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,749
Just got this information,

701
01:08:00,052 --> 01:08:02,111
- great news isn't it?
- Good news indeed.

702
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:05,354
Bongabondhu has been named the
first president of Bangladesh

703
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:06,686
and have called for

704
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:09,285
Boidanathola to be
named Mujibnagar.

705
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:10,720
Great!

706
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:12,686
Even Zia is with us now!

707
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:14,357
Now tell me Amir,

708
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:15,991
can you form a government

709
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:18,059
in such a short time
with your pen?

710
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:23,402
Mojid Sahb!

711
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,146
Mojid Sahb!

712
01:08:36,755 --> 01:08:38,382
Mojid Sahb!

713
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:41,618
Why Mojid Sahb?

714
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,323
What conspiracy
are you plotting

715
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:46,762
behind these closed doors?

716
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:51,669
Mojid Sahb!
I have told you so many times

717
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:57,769
to support true Islam,

718
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:02,513
support Pakistan.

719
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,506
Thirty years ago,
when I picked you up

720
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:07,985
from a dumpster
in Chittagong,

721
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:10,988
it didn't occur
to me that one day,

722
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,149
you will teach me
the values of Islam.

723
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,992
Mojid Sahb!

724
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:39,649
Your understanding
of Islam is quite apparent

725
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:43,687
by the methods your Pakistani
friends have adopted.

726
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:49,020
Do you think you own Islam?

727
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:52,623
Or does Allah belong
only to Pakistan?

728
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,771
When night falls,
flocks of birds return home.

729
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,137
For us it was a journey away

730
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:10,443
in the darkest period
of our lives.

731
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,116
My eyes were witnessing this
exodus for the second time

732
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:15,186
in their seventy
years of existence.

733
01:10:16,688 --> 01:10:18,782
Just a couple more hours

734
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:21,088
and we will reach Gopalpur.

735
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,618
From there,
it's just two more days

736
01:10:24,696 --> 01:10:26,596
to Charghat.

737
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:30,096
India begins and
our journey ends.

738
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:35,264
Baba!

739
01:10:36,074 --> 01:10:37,439
Baba!

740
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:41,641
Baba!

741
01:10:42,214 --> 01:10:44,273
Pakistani!

742
01:10:47,186 --> 01:10:50,383
Hide, hide here
behind the trees.

743
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:06,403
You fool!
Leave them here and hide.

744
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:38,134
Who is it?

745
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:46,404
It's been days
since I smoked.

746
01:11:46,478 --> 01:11:49,846
Right.
Lets find a Bengali guy.

747
01:11:50,148 --> 01:11:52,082
Look.

748
01:11:53,652 --> 01:11:55,245
Oi!

749
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:57,516
Oi! Wait, wait, wait, wait...

750
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:01,589
Who is it?

751
01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:05,596
Amazing!
Not a person in sight.

752
01:12:11,403 --> 01:12:13,201
Where do you think
you're headed Mister?

753
01:12:15,474 --> 01:12:17,408
Are you deaf?

754
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:21,478
Keep him quiet.

755
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,309
He doesn't say anything.

756
01:12:23,415 --> 01:12:24,814
Speak up, devil's children.

757
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:27,415
Sir here, is a good man.
He will escort you home.

758
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,312
He will get us all killed!

759
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:31,389
Just look at his bones,

760
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,083
they are looking so weak.

761
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:38,586
Say! Milk and cream
is your wife's specialty...

762
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,827
I suggest you should
savor them every day.

763
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:47,304
Otherwise one day,
you might just disappear.

764
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:49,167
Disappear, my ass.

765
01:12:49,274 --> 01:12:53,302
I bet they can still
run at a 100 miles per hour.

766
01:12:53,545 --> 01:12:55,445
Are you wearing tin glasses?

767
01:12:55,514 --> 01:12:57,380
100 miles per hour...

768
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,608
I don't think
they can even walk.

769
01:13:00,285 --> 01:13:01,150
Then?

770
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:02,687
At best, they can crawl.

771
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:04,722
Really? Ok, let's bet.

772
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:07,387
For how much?

773
01:13:07,492 --> 01:13:08,687
- 10 Rs.
- 10!

774
01:13:09,161 --> 01:13:10,560
Oi,
I say you're a wealthy man.

775
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:12,391
Leave the wealth,
you also take it out.

776
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:14,261
Come on, take it out.

777
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,198
- Here.
- Give me.

778
01:13:17,402 --> 01:13:19,063
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

779
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:22,106
Now see, they won't
run at a 100 miles per hour,

780
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:24,198
they'll run at 200!

781
01:13:24,309 --> 01:13:25,333
- Is it?
- Do you want to see?

782
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:26,468
- Show...
- Come,

783
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:28,444
Come, come, come...

784
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:30,379
make sure to run, yeah?

785
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,483
Look now

786
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:38,215
Somebody stop them!

787
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:40,415
Where did they go?

788
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:42,220
Run, you fools...

789
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,284
Run!

790
01:13:46,098 --> 01:13:47,657
You lose every time.

791
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:49,234
Oh no!

792
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,696
What have you done?

793
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:54,636
I lost because
of these animals.

794
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:57,075
You!

795
01:13:57,175 --> 01:13:59,234
Let them be.

796
01:14:00,112 --> 01:14:02,547
There are many more,
where they came from.

797
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:04,446
Lets go!

798
01:14:47,826 --> 01:14:49,157
Raziya!

799
01:14:50,095 --> 01:14:51,256
Raziya!

800
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,530
My parents house

801
01:15:37,342 --> 01:15:38,571
no longer exists.

802
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,603
My hushand's house

803
01:15:42,214 --> 01:15:43,545
burnt to ashes,

804
01:15:45,283 --> 01:15:48,344
and my son died before
knowing what a home is.

805
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,385
Where are we going
in search of a home now?

806
01:15:57,562 --> 01:15:59,530
Baba says, we will come back.

807
01:16:00,265 --> 01:16:02,256
Come back and stay where?

808
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:06,427
Next to my son's grave?

809
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:09,337
Or my parents?

810
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:12,103
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

811
01:16:12,177 --> 01:16:13,702
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

812
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,009
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

813
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:19,610
Son, go and call them quickly.

814
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:22,379
Okay.

815
01:16:26,057 --> 01:16:27,650
After spending the night
in Gopalpur, we thought

816
01:16:27,726 --> 01:16:30,058
we would leave for Charghat...

817
01:16:33,598 --> 01:16:35,032
...but that ill-fated
morning our hopes

818
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,432
were
to suffer yet another blow.

819
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,471
- Raziya!
- Raziya!

820
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,264
Between those
merciless beheadings,

821
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:18,776
squirting blood
and wailing women,

822
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:22,036
I saw innocence,
die an innocent death.

823
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:45,094
Rafiq!

824
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:50,571
True to his word,

825
01:17:50,642 --> 01:17:53,202
he did not let
anything happen to his sister.

826
01:19:09,087 --> 01:19:12,182
<i>These muted pathways</i>

827
01:19:12,257 --> 01:19:15,522
<i>wailing walls</i>

828
01:19:15,593 --> 01:19:19,723
<i>and shutters to a
window without a view</i>

829
01:19:21,433 --> 01:19:24,528
<i>On annulled earth</i>

830
01:19:25,003 --> 01:19:27,734
<i>He quivering gates</i>

831
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:32,603
<i>to the stench of burnt souls</i>

832
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:37,377
<i>The blood that flows</i>

833
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:40,782
<i>from a mother's breast</i>

834
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:45,546
<i>now lies lifeless</i>

835
01:19:47,192 --> 01:19:52,426
<i>It will run through
the gutters</i>

836
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:58,534
<i>and eventually clot</i>

837
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:05,609
<i>Blood is after all blood</i>

838
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:11,114
<i>it will eventually clot</i>

839
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:42,270
<i>Words dripping with blood</i>

840
01:20:43,815 --> 01:20:48,309
<i>and tongues that
brand these words</i>

841
01:20:50,588 --> 01:20:53,683
<i>Whichever language it speaks</i>

842
01:20:53,758 --> 01:20:56,819
<i>whatever faith it follows</i>

843
01:20:57,095 --> 01:20:59,564
<i>blood is after all blood</i>

844
01:20:59,631 --> 01:21:02,100
<i>it will eventually clot</i>

845
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:59,488
<i>The predators
were our very own</i>

846
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:06,197
<i>their faces and
their god our own</i>

847
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:12,460
<i>but where was this Lord?</i>

848
01:22:12,537 --> 01:22:16,030
<i>Beyond the horizon</i>

849
01:22:16,107 --> 01:22:19,771
<i>riding the clouds</i>

850
01:22:20,044 --> 01:22:25,175
<i>making it rain blood</i>

851
01:22:25,283 --> 01:22:28,742
Blood!

852
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:37,390
<i>Oh Lord,
what have you created?</i>

853
01:22:37,695 --> 01:22:41,723
<i>The earth is soaked in blood</i>

854
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:47,205
Whose path is this?

855
01:22:47,372 --> 01:22:50,307
Whose domain is this?

856
01:22:50,408 --> 01:22:55,107
<i>Where is that place
where my home used to be?</i>

857
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:59,674
<i>Where is that place?</i>

858
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:42,390
<i>Why have we lost
so many innocent lives?</i>

859
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,424
Because of you!

860
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:47,358
I haven't done
anything Mojid Sahb.

861
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:49,260
I'm right here.

862
01:23:49,334 --> 01:23:52,133
But your allies are all there!

863
01:23:52,437 --> 01:23:54,132
It's a shame.

864
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:57,534
I can't believe that people
like you live in this country.

865
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:01,477
I had no one in my life,

866
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:04,306
I knew only you

867
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:08,083
and then,
the teachers in the Madrasa.

868
01:24:09,354 --> 01:24:12,415
It was you, who put me
in the Madrasa, Mojid Sahb

869
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:17,194
I learnt whatever
they taught me!

870
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,591
What else could I
have done Mojid Sahb?

871
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:27,763
But after what
happened in Gopalpur...

872
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:32,136
Allah will never forgive me...

873
01:24:33,144 --> 01:24:34,703
Mojid Sahb, he...

874
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:37,673
If this malingerer
wasn't like a son to me,

875
01:24:38,483 --> 01:24:40,577
I might have
even forgiven him.

876
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:45,052
Mojid Sahb...

877
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:50,756
If you help us, innocent
lives can still be saved.

878
01:24:53,097 --> 01:24:54,531
Give us the names
of all your allies...

879
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:20,584
Bhitika! My child!

880
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,462
What are you looking at?

881
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:37,264
Help me.

882
01:25:38,672 --> 01:25:39,605
In about two hours,

883
01:25:39,706 --> 01:25:42,141
two Pakistani officers
will pass by Kharkharia Mor,

884
01:25:44,578 --> 01:25:46,637
and I have brought
some flowers

885
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:48,806
to welcome them.

886
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,547
It will take about an hour
to reach there.

887
01:25:52,786 --> 01:25:54,185
Where? The camp?

888
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:55,718
Kharkharia Mor.

889
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,850
Oh! That means
we've lost this opportunity.

890
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,557
No, not yet.

891
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,885
But we will...
if your men don't hurry.

892
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,489
But you will not go alone...

893
01:26:04,598 --> 01:26:05,724
Ashraf!

894
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:07,561
These three will go with you.

895
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:13,837
Joi Bangla!

896
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:19,838
Joi Bangla!

897
01:26:25,385 --> 01:26:27,319
I've never heard about you
before.

898
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:28,855
It's best if you don't.

899
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:32,655
You are Amir, isn't it?

900
01:26:35,228 --> 01:26:36,593
You know of me?

901
01:26:37,764 --> 01:26:40,199
I used to read your articles
very fondly.

902
01:26:40,434 --> 01:26:41,868
You write well.

903
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:46,805
Used to write...
I don't anymore.

904
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,674
If I hadn't read
your articles,

905
01:26:50,177 --> 01:26:52,475
I would never have had
the courage to do this.

906
01:26:55,515 --> 01:26:56,846
Where have you come from?

907
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:58,749
Hell.

908
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:05,249
Don't mind.

909
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:07,821
I really have come from hell.

910
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:18,501
My father was also
very fond of your writing.

911
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,765
That day,
he was making breakfast

912
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,474
and I was reading out
the newspaper to him

913
01:27:27,647 --> 01:27:30,412
when suddenly
the door bell rang and...

914
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:34,152
anyway.

915
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:38,224
My father was a professor
at the university

916
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:40,487
and very fond of fish.

917
01:27:41,228 --> 01:27:42,252
Watch your step!

918
01:27:42,329 --> 01:27:43,763
Where is your father now?

919
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,660
In heaven.

920
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:49,193
Oh! I am sorry.

921
01:27:50,637 --> 01:27:51,729
Why?

922
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:55,475
I am the one
who has come from hell.

923
01:27:56,343 --> 01:27:58,243
Heaven is a good place,
isn't it?

924
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:05,309
Amir! I feel no shame
in sharing my story.

925
01:28:06,486 --> 01:28:08,181
This is not just my story.

926
01:28:08,722 --> 01:28:11,214
This is the story of
every woman in Bangladesh.

927
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:17,188
From here on, we are going to
write our story ourselves.

928
01:28:19,065 --> 01:28:20,624
Will you pen our story?

929
01:28:24,337 --> 01:28:25,702
Anyway...

930
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:19,684
I heard about you,

931
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:24,730
it distressed me.

932
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,335
Fida...

933
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:40,769
her name was Fida.

934
01:29:58,598 --> 01:29:59,793
She's alive.

935
01:30:12,746 --> 01:30:14,043
Dead!

936
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:18,173
Alive?

937
01:30:20,153 --> 01:30:21,643
I must go back.

938
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:24,383
Tell Mojid Sahb,

939
01:30:24,491 --> 01:30:27,119
I will be back with more
ammunition and information.

940
01:30:28,194 --> 01:30:29,593
Bhitika, stop!

941
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:32,323
Where have you seen her?

942
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:37,094
Somewhere in Dhaka!

943
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:41,270
She was nothing
more than a living corpse.

944
01:30:46,413 --> 01:30:48,074
Hope is a good thing Amir,

945
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:50,845
but it's best
to let this one go.

946
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:17,702
Done with your bath?

947
01:31:33,526 --> 01:31:34,755
Can I go?

948
01:31:38,298 --> 01:31:39,663
Ok go.

949
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:43,394
Don't bathe so much,
you'll grow old.

950
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:40,491
What? What are you looking at?

951
01:32:41,094 --> 01:32:42,459
Bury her now,

952
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:49,491
and you'll do it alone.

953
01:34:09,282 --> 01:34:12,115
She kept trying to wash
the stains off her body,

954
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:14,319
without water or soap.

955
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:18,181
She had forgotten that

956
01:34:18,258 --> 01:34:20,283
the stains were not
on her body,

957
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,528
but had seeped
through to her soul.

958
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,094
How could they be cleansed!

959
01:34:35,241 --> 01:34:38,108
Her soul could
only be cleansed with blood.

960
01:34:38,511 --> 01:34:40,536
Just like the soil of
Bangladesh.

961
01:35:07,807 --> 01:35:09,571
Come, eat something.

962
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:13,111
It's been two days,
since they've given us food.

963
01:35:25,325 --> 01:35:27,384
Hurry up
or it'll be over.

964
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:29,195
Here, eat this stale bread.

965
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:31,621
Go, get lost.

966
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:35,596
What will you eat love?

967
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:37,567
This is my food.

968
01:35:38,438 --> 01:35:39,633
Here.

969
01:35:44,477 --> 01:35:47,276
Do you want to see
how they fight over bread?

970
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:49,576
Want to see?

971
01:35:51,284 --> 01:35:53,412
Leave it!

972
01:36:07,233 --> 01:36:08,394
Leave!

973
01:36:10,803 --> 01:36:12,237
Leave it!

974
01:36:12,305 --> 01:36:14,069
- It is my bread!
- Leave it!

975
01:36:27,754 --> 01:36:29,381
What about you?

976
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:32,149
I have eaten.

977
01:36:37,463 --> 01:36:39,090
Eat a little more.

978
01:36:51,177 --> 01:36:53,145
I saw your photograph today.

979
01:36:54,647 --> 01:36:55,842
Keep eating.

980
01:37:02,522 --> 01:37:05,389
We killed
two Pakistani officers today.

981
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:11,255
Really!

982
01:37:13,733 --> 01:37:15,462
I haven't lost my mind.

983
01:37:17,603 --> 01:37:21,801
No, not at all.
It's all right. Eat.

984
01:37:30,616 --> 01:37:32,084
Look there.

985
01:37:34,253 --> 01:37:36,221
The razakar at that gate,

986
01:37:38,391 --> 01:37:40,359
stands watch every night.

987
01:37:43,196 --> 01:37:44,823
Please him a bit...

988
01:37:51,838 --> 01:37:57,675
and... he lets you go
to the river to bathe.

989
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:00,210
Ok.

990
01:38:02,115 --> 01:38:03,207
Yes,

991
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:07,149
but only the cleaning women
like me.

992
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:19,463
I steal arms and ammunition
from the armoury.

993
01:38:26,539 --> 01:38:28,439
I haven't lost my mind Fida!

994
01:38:30,143 --> 01:38:31,838
How do you know my name?

995
01:38:35,248 --> 01:38:36,738
Amir told me.

996
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:40,347
Amir?

997
01:38:43,389 --> 01:38:45,357
He is the one who showed me
your photograph.

998
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:49,854
Amir is alive?

999
01:38:50,797 --> 01:38:52,458
Thank God!

1000
01:38:53,466 --> 01:38:55,093
Amir is alive!

1001
01:38:57,503 --> 01:38:59,528
He is with the MuktiBahini.

1002
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,772
It's for them,
I took the ammunition.

1003
01:39:05,845 --> 01:39:08,314
Pakistan's days are
numbered...

1004
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:12,684
Does he know
that I am here?

1005
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:18,583
Everyone is fighting
for Bangladesh

1006
01:39:19,425 --> 01:39:21,189
and he is fighting for you...

1007
01:39:21,828 --> 01:39:23,262
Fida.

1008
01:39:26,532 --> 01:39:28,125
He will surely come.

1009
01:39:32,138 --> 01:39:34,470
Will you meet him again?

1010
01:39:35,842 --> 01:39:38,436
I don't know. Maybe.

1011
01:39:42,482 --> 01:39:43,847
Maybe not.

1012
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:45,475
Get up.

1013
01:39:45,785 --> 01:39:47,753
Haven't you eaten enough?

1014
01:39:48,521 --> 01:39:50,114
Meal time is over.

1015
01:39:55,094 --> 01:39:57,756
I felt like
screaming my heart out.

1016
01:40:00,867 --> 01:40:02,392
We hadn't lost yet.

1017
01:40:02,602 --> 01:40:03,831
We were fighting.

1018
01:40:13,379 --> 01:40:15,074
Aamir was alive...

1019
01:40:16,549 --> 01:40:18,244
and looking for me.

1020
01:40:31,597 --> 01:40:33,087
What the...

1021
01:40:36,602 --> 01:40:38,229
You seem to be very happy.

1022
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:47,070
Have you lost your mind?

1023
01:41:14,607 --> 01:41:17,668
Teacher used to say,
all Muslims are brothers.

1024
01:41:20,746 --> 01:41:23,306
Why don't you check
another guava?

1025
01:41:25,051 --> 01:41:26,815
I always knew he was lying.

1026
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:31,114
No son, teacher never lied...

1027
01:41:31,591 --> 01:41:35,323
and not only Muslims,
all men are brothers.

1028
01:41:36,629 --> 01:41:39,621
He must have told you
the story of 'Adam and Hawa'.

1029
01:41:40,066 --> 01:41:42,194
We all are their children.

1030
01:41:47,106 --> 01:41:48,437
Not them.

1031
01:41:49,842 --> 01:41:55,281
They were demons,
disguised in flesh and blood.

1032
01:41:56,682 --> 01:41:59,515
And teacher said that
good always wins over evil.

1033
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,381
I will fight them.

1034
01:42:13,733 --> 01:42:15,599
After the
Bangla music presentation

1035
01:42:15,668 --> 01:42:17,432
on the 1st in America,

1036
01:42:17,503 --> 01:42:20,666
people are concentrating on
the situation of Bangladesh.

1037
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:22,265
That is all for today.

1038
01:42:42,094 --> 01:42:43,391
Stop.

1039
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,755
Look back

1040
01:42:46,332 --> 01:42:48,130
and see.

1041
01:42:49,135 --> 01:42:53,470
If you don't look back,
then how will you learn?

1042
01:42:54,807 --> 01:42:57,174
Look at what is happening.

1043
01:42:57,476 --> 01:43:01,344
See what is happening
around you and learn.

1044
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:03,514
Otherwise, time...

1045
01:43:03,582 --> 01:43:06,847
will repeat itself.

1046
01:43:07,553 --> 01:43:09,021
Stop!

1047
01:43:09,455 --> 01:43:11,480
Didn't I tell you to stop!

1048
01:43:12,224 --> 01:43:16,525
You think I am blind.

1049
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:19,254
I can't see...

1050
01:43:20,499 --> 01:43:23,434
but don't forget who I am.

1051
01:43:23,502 --> 01:43:26,199
I am Durga. Durga!

1052
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:32,043
My eyes

1053
01:43:32,545 --> 01:43:36,038
can see what you can't.

1054
01:43:36,449 --> 01:43:41,512
A shadow of doom...

1055
01:43:42,455 --> 01:43:44,287
Change it!

1056
01:43:44,523 --> 01:43:46,423
While you can...

1057
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:50,689
Change it.

1058
01:43:50,763 --> 01:43:52,663
Who are you? What do you want?

1059
01:43:52,732 --> 01:43:55,326
Change it.

1060
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:58,598
Why do you need to show
a gun for that?

1061
01:44:00,106 --> 01:44:01,471
Who else is there?

1062
01:44:03,576 --> 01:44:04,702
Who else is there?

1063
01:44:05,711 --> 01:44:07,406
Guests!

1064
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,092
What did you say
is the name of your village?

1065
01:44:24,797 --> 01:44:26,458
Rasoolpur.

1066
01:44:27,533 --> 01:44:29,467
Why don't you speak?

1067
01:44:30,436 --> 01:44:32,131
Yes, you.

1068
01:44:32,705 --> 01:44:36,801
How will I recognize you
when we meet again?

1069
01:44:39,578 --> 01:44:41,239
I have to go to Charghat.

1070
01:44:43,182 --> 01:44:45,276
Go in the morning.

1071
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:56,257
Eat properly.

1072
01:44:58,197 --> 01:44:59,756
Slowly.

1073
01:45:33,766 --> 01:45:38,670
Today marks an important date
in world history,

1074
01:45:40,206 --> 01:45:41,696
because on this day,

1075
01:45:42,641 --> 01:45:44,405
our forefathers had

1076
01:45:44,777 --> 01:45:47,542
laid the foundations
of a beautiful nation.

1077
01:45:48,647 --> 01:45:50,308
It is very sad,

1078
01:45:51,884 --> 01:45:53,818
that a few of
our own people conspired

1079
01:45:53,886 --> 01:45:56,821
against our beautiful nation.

1080
01:45:58,224 --> 01:46:00,454
What can be more tormenting

1081
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:04,892
to the souls
of our forefathers

1082
01:46:05,731 --> 01:46:10,225
that today, we are forced
to raise arms against

1083
01:46:10,336 --> 01:46:12,532
our own people,
in our own country!

1084
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,067
But remember,

1085
01:46:17,476 --> 01:46:21,504
conspiring against the nation
will not be tolerated!

1086
01:46:23,782 --> 01:46:25,307
Remember,

1087
01:46:26,519 --> 01:46:28,385
we had sworn,

1088
01:46:29,388 --> 01:46:31,584
that even
at the cost of our lives,

1089
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:37,123
we will not let any harm
come upon our pure motherland.

1090
01:46:40,366 --> 01:46:44,633
And today,
we reiterate our vows,

1091
01:46:46,305 --> 01:46:51,607
that till the last drop of
blood flows through our veins,

1092
01:46:52,511 --> 01:46:55,537
the people who conspire
against this country,

1093
01:46:57,516 --> 01:46:59,814
the people
who betray our country

1094
01:47:00,452 --> 01:47:02,386
and the enemies
of our community and country

1095
01:47:02,454 --> 01:47:04,752
will never be allowed
to succeed.

1096
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:09,450
By the grace of god,
victory will be ours!

1097
01:47:11,397 --> 01:47:16,699
Long Live Pakistan!
Long Live Pakistan!

1098
01:47:16,769 --> 01:47:21,366
We will be victorious!

1099
01:47:23,676 --> 01:47:25,337
We will be victorious!

1100
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:28,506
- We will be victorious!
- We will be victorious!

1101
01:47:28,581 --> 01:47:31,642
- We will be victorious!
- We will be victorious!

1102
01:47:31,717 --> 01:47:33,446
We will be victorious,

1103
01:47:33,519 --> 01:47:36,216
because victory is our right!

1104
01:47:36,589 --> 01:47:39,581
Because justice is our right!

1105
01:47:40,492 --> 01:47:42,460
We will win undoubtedly,

1106
01:47:42,861 --> 01:47:45,193
because we have won before.

1107
01:47:59,812 --> 01:48:01,177
Raziul

1108
01:48:02,548 --> 01:48:04,346
Ghulam Mohammad

1109
01:48:05,818 --> 01:48:07,479
Sultan

1110
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,110
Ali

1111
01:48:09,188 --> 01:48:10,485
Rehman

1112
01:48:11,624 --> 01:48:13,183
Quadir

1113
01:48:20,299 --> 01:48:21,664
Speak!

1114
01:48:24,336 --> 01:48:25,303
Ashraful

1115
01:48:26,505 --> 01:48:27,802
Shamsuddin

1116
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:39,546
Imtiaz

1117
01:48:42,488 --> 01:48:43,478
Ansari

1118
01:48:48,861 --> 01:48:50,386
Rehman

1119
01:48:52,431 --> 01:48:53,660
Razizu

1120
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:55,496
Khadir

1121
01:48:55,567 --> 01:48:57,126
Sultan

1122
01:48:57,236 --> 01:48:58,431
Abdullah...

1123
01:49:02,608 --> 01:49:04,770
I hope Malik's name
is on that list, Mojid Sahb.

1124
01:49:09,715 --> 01:49:11,740
This is now
your responsibility.

1125
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,145
- Greetings, sir.
- What is it?

1126
01:49:45,484 --> 01:49:46,645
Go away!

1127
01:49:50,456 --> 01:49:51,355
What?

1128
01:49:51,423 --> 01:49:53,414
Who are the Dhaka Guerillas?

1129
01:49:55,327 --> 01:49:56,419
How many members do they have?

1130
01:49:56,495 --> 01:49:58,088
Who all are involved?

1131
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:02,631
Scoundrel!

1132
01:50:03,602 --> 01:50:05,832
You can't even find out
one name!

1133
01:50:14,513 --> 01:50:15,605
No, sir!

1134
01:50:16,315 --> 01:50:17,578
No, sir.

1135
01:50:18,317 --> 01:50:19,648
Idiot!

1136
01:50:30,129 --> 01:50:31,392
Anger is a sin.

1137
01:50:33,799 --> 01:50:35,289
Anger is a sin.

1138
01:50:42,674 --> 01:50:44,335
Anger is a sin.

1139
01:50:58,190 --> 01:51:00,124
Joi Bangla!

1140
01:51:00,192 --> 01:51:01,819
- Did he say something?
- No Sir.

1141
01:51:02,361 --> 01:51:04,489
Joi Bangla!

1142
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,328
Who is your leader?

1143
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:19,343
Bongabondhu, Sheikh Mujib.

1144
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:22,504
Bongabondhu.

1145
01:51:23,348 --> 01:51:27,581
Your Bongabondhu
is rotting in our jail!

1146
01:51:27,653 --> 01:51:29,382
(Making fun of Bengali)

1147
01:51:29,822 --> 01:51:35,226
You neither understand us,
nor our language.

1148
01:51:37,196 --> 01:51:42,293
Who are you?
Why are you here?

1149
01:51:43,068 --> 01:51:44,502
You fool!

1150
01:51:45,304 --> 01:51:47,068
Why are we here!

1151
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:56,511
We are here, to show you
your rightful place.

1152
01:52:11,263 --> 01:52:13,493
It's your time today,

1153
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:16,258
but tomorrow, it'll be ours.

1154
01:52:19,638 --> 01:52:21,538
The day we Bengali's

1155
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,166
stand on your border

1156
01:52:24,443 --> 01:52:26,343
and urinate,

1157
01:52:26,778 --> 01:52:30,237
all of Pakistan will be
flooded!

1158
01:52:31,516 --> 01:52:33,211
Speak in Urdu!

1159
01:52:36,388 --> 01:52:39,153
Speak in Urdu...

1160
01:52:39,758 --> 01:52:46,130
Then tell your Jamaatis
to go swim in it.

1161
01:53:21,733 --> 01:53:24,168
Don't be afraid,

1162
01:53:26,571 --> 01:53:29,802
these people are losing.

1163
01:53:44,089 --> 01:53:49,584
Bangladesh is coming!

1164
01:54:19,424 --> 01:54:20,789
Goodbye.

1165
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,555
Goodbye.

1166
01:54:24,129 --> 01:54:25,563
Goodbye.

1167
01:54:40,812 --> 01:54:42,439
A forest on the other side
of the river,

1168
01:54:42,547 --> 01:54:43,776
and Charghat just beyond that.

1169
01:54:44,082 --> 01:54:45,140
Baba!

1170
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,649
It's not too far now...

1171
01:54:49,721 --> 01:54:51,416
Charghat.

1172
01:54:52,357 --> 01:54:54,792
Charghat.

1173
01:54:55,193 --> 01:54:57,093
Charghat.

1174
01:54:58,196 --> 01:55:00,290
Charghat.

1175
01:55:04,669 --> 01:55:06,603
Why Charghat?

1176
01:55:06,705 --> 01:55:09,072
Who? Who are you?

1177
01:55:10,475 --> 01:55:11,636
Bangladesh!

1178
01:55:13,078 --> 01:55:14,409
Bangladesh?

1179
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:19,080
We are all Bangladesh.
All us women!

1180
01:55:19,751 --> 01:55:24,211
And if Pakistan thinks
it can ravage Bangladesh,

1181
01:55:24,289 --> 01:55:26,621
the way they ravaged
our bodies...

1182
01:55:27,125 --> 01:55:29,321
then they are wrong!

1183
01:55:32,431 --> 01:55:34,490
We must get to India, son.

1184
01:55:37,235 --> 01:55:38,600
India.

1185
01:55:39,304 --> 01:55:40,703
Charghat.

1186
01:55:43,241 --> 01:55:44,572
Charghat.

1187
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:58,287
Bangladesh is everywhere.

1188
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:02,851
Beside the river of pain,

1189
01:56:05,263 --> 01:56:06,753
and

1190
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:12,767
beyond the boat of hope.

1191
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:20,511
The Bangladesh of tomorrow,

1192
01:56:28,186 --> 01:56:29,711
this

1193
01:56:30,755 --> 01:56:37,354
young soldier's Bangladesh.

1194
01:56:37,863 --> 01:56:39,592
Have you lost your mind?

1195
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,861
Stop screaming.

1196
01:56:43,401 --> 01:56:44,766
We have reached.

1197
01:57:09,227 --> 01:57:12,060
I hope no one saw you
coming here.

1198
01:57:13,665 --> 01:57:14,723
No.

1199
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:23,765
I'll go outside
and keep an eye.

1200
01:57:44,129 --> 01:57:45,528
Will Amir be there?

1201
01:57:46,198 --> 01:57:50,499
Maybe. If he is then
what should I say?

1202
01:57:53,705 --> 01:57:55,230
Don't tell him you met me.

1203
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,466
Why?

1204
01:57:57,309 --> 01:57:59,835
I don't want him to accept me
out of pity.

1205
01:58:01,246 --> 01:58:07,583
What has happened with
you, me or anyone else,

1206
01:58:08,253 --> 01:58:10,153
is not our fault.

1207
01:58:11,489 --> 01:58:14,117
If he acts pitiful
or does not accept you,

1208
01:58:14,392 --> 01:58:16,486
then he was
never worthy of you.

1209
01:58:19,164 --> 01:58:20,359
Take my hair out.

1210
01:58:27,672 --> 01:58:29,197
Come back soon.

1211
01:58:57,168 --> 01:58:58,636
Stop.

1212
01:59:11,516 --> 01:59:12,574
Sir.

1213
01:59:14,486 --> 01:59:15,578
What are you doing?

1214
01:59:17,555 --> 01:59:18,681
Go on.

1215
01:59:21,159 --> 01:59:22,320
Stop.

1216
01:59:27,332 --> 01:59:30,393
This is Pakistan growing
in your wombs.

1217
01:59:34,506 --> 01:59:37,567
You used to go on
about your Bangladesh.

1218
01:59:39,244 --> 01:59:41,372
Now tell me
if your Bangladesh will...

1219
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:44,348
how do they say it in English?

1220
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:46,408
What is it?

1221
01:59:46,651 --> 01:59:47,743
Yes.

1222
01:59:49,521 --> 01:59:50,818
Accept.

1223
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:55,091
Even your family
will not accept you now!

1224
01:59:58,129 --> 01:59:59,358
Let's go.
- Yes Sir.

1225
02:00:06,538 --> 02:00:07,835
Move along.

1226
02:00:18,783 --> 02:00:20,308
You want to go again?

1227
02:00:22,754 --> 02:00:25,280
Why are you in such a hurry
to grow old?

1228
02:00:27,625 --> 02:00:29,059
I'll come soon.

1229
02:00:29,127 --> 02:00:31,118
By then you would have
grown old.

1230
02:00:31,563 --> 02:00:34,658
You are young now,
just right for me.

1231
02:00:36,134 --> 02:00:37,465
Let's go inside.

1232
02:00:38,136 --> 02:00:41,470
Won't it be better
if I am clean?

1233
02:00:41,773 --> 02:00:44,105
Don't throw tantrums.
Come inside.

1234
02:00:44,209 --> 02:00:47,543
- Let me go...
- Come on!

1235
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,271
- You fool!
- Come here!

1236
02:00:51,516 --> 02:00:52,847
Who are you?

1237
02:00:53,318 --> 02:00:54,547
Get up!

1238
02:00:57,522 --> 02:00:59,320
- Bring him.
- Sir.

1239
02:00:59,391 --> 02:01:01,189
I didn't do anything.

1240
02:01:01,292 --> 02:01:02,623
Bring him here.

1241
02:01:03,561 --> 02:01:05,154
- Sir?
- Move!

1242
02:01:06,231 --> 02:01:07,323
Move!

1243
02:01:09,134 --> 02:01:11,432
What did I do?

1244
02:01:11,503 --> 02:01:14,473
What have I done?

1245
02:01:16,641 --> 02:01:18,473
What is going on here?

1246
02:01:19,043 --> 02:01:21,137
I didn't do anything Sir.

1247
02:01:21,246 --> 02:01:22,475
In fact, I am the one
who caught her.

1248
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:23,809
I didn't do anything Sir.

1249
02:01:24,115 --> 02:01:25,048
I didn't do anything Sir!

1250
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,515
Sir I didn't do anything!

1251
02:01:29,387 --> 02:01:30,821
Sir!

1252
02:01:54,112 --> 02:01:55,841
Bring them all out,

1253
02:01:58,082 --> 02:02:00,449
let them learn.

1254
02:02:06,124 --> 02:02:07,785
Come on out everyone!

1255
02:02:47,165 --> 02:02:48,394
Hey, come on.

1256
02:06:14,772 --> 02:06:16,797
Do demons come from hell?

1257
02:06:17,675 --> 02:06:19,234
Yes,

1258
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:23,280
they had come from hell.

1259
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:26,608
They,

1260
02:06:27,485 --> 02:06:29,817
had come to rob us
of our freedom.

1261
02:06:30,555 --> 02:06:31,852
If they ever come
in front of me,

1262
02:06:32,156 --> 02:06:33,555
I will free them forever!

1263
02:06:33,658 --> 02:06:36,150
No son!

1264
02:06:37,695 --> 02:06:39,288
Don't think like that.

1265
02:06:44,702 --> 02:06:46,466
In a few days,

1266
02:06:47,705 --> 02:06:49,730
we will reach Charghat.

1267
02:06:54,212 --> 02:06:58,513
If anything happens to me
on the way,

1268
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:01,209
don't stop.

1269
02:07:02,353 --> 02:07:03,718
Keep walking.

1270
02:07:05,189 --> 02:07:09,751
Don't ever leave your
mother and sister, all right?

1271
02:07:15,633 --> 02:07:17,658
What will happen to you Abbu?

1272
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:23,071
Nothing will happen to you,

1273
02:07:27,111 --> 02:07:28,579
I am not a child anymore.

1274
02:07:33,584 --> 02:07:35,348
I won't let anything happen
to you.

1275
02:07:57,475 --> 02:07:59,375
Why don't you talk to me?

1276
02:08:05,483 --> 02:08:07,577
We are almost
about to reach India.

1277
02:08:16,828 --> 02:08:19,422
Do you think
we will be happy in India?

1278
02:08:19,664 --> 02:08:20,597
Baba had said...

1279
02:08:20,698 --> 02:08:22,598
I know what Baba had said.

1280
02:08:28,673 --> 02:08:30,698
H e used to say that
every girl gets married

1281
02:08:30,808 --> 02:08:32,333
and has to leave someday,

1282
02:08:35,646 --> 02:08:38,138
I have had to leave
before getting married.

1283
02:08:47,792 --> 02:08:49,419
I am with you.

1284
02:08:51,395 --> 02:08:53,090
I will get you married.

1285
02:08:53,331 --> 02:08:54,526
Where?

1286
02:08:54,632 --> 02:08:55,861
In India?

1287
02:08:58,135 --> 02:08:59,330
Why?

1288
02:09:00,671 --> 02:09:02,537
Who says we cannot come back?

1289
02:09:06,244 --> 02:09:07,473
You wait here,

1290
02:09:08,312 --> 02:09:09,780
I'll just come back...

1291
02:10:15,146 --> 02:10:16,443
Where were you?

1292
02:10:17,715 --> 02:10:19,240
Are you all right?

1293
02:10:20,451 --> 02:10:22,078
What will happen to me?

1294
02:10:27,458 --> 02:10:28,687
Should we leave?

1295
02:10:38,436 --> 02:10:40,666
Find out about these
Dhaka guerillas.

1296
02:10:41,105 --> 02:10:42,539
We don't have a single name!

1297
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,539
How many members are there,

1298
02:10:43,641 --> 02:10:45,609
who are the people involved?

1299
02:10:46,277 --> 02:10:47,745
I am repeating my orders.

1300
02:10:48,746 --> 02:10:50,373
Shoot the rebels at sight.

1301
02:10:50,481 --> 02:10:51,642
Yes, sir.

1302
02:10:52,216 --> 02:10:54,116
Not even one person
should be left alive!

1303
02:11:05,796 --> 02:11:06,695
Where is everyone?

1304
02:11:06,797 --> 02:11:08,322
Go and check.

1305
02:11:17,475 --> 02:11:19,170
You are making a mistake.

1306
02:11:25,683 --> 02:11:27,208
Mr. Journalist!

1307
02:11:50,741 --> 02:11:51,833
You are still alive?

1308
02:11:55,212 --> 02:11:57,112
We will ask the questions
today.

1309
02:12:01,285 --> 02:12:02,616
I will let you go.

1310
02:12:03,521 --> 02:12:05,319
Just tell me where my wife is.

1311
02:12:08,092 --> 02:12:09,218
In the same place,

1312
02:12:10,394 --> 02:12:12,192
where your Bangladesh is.

1313
02:12:14,698 --> 02:12:16,666
Neither will you get
your wife,

1314
02:12:18,269 --> 02:12:20,670
nor your Bangladesh!

1315
02:12:25,609 --> 02:12:27,771
Your reign is over.

1316
02:12:28,245 --> 02:12:29,644
You have lost.

1317
02:12:30,514 --> 02:12:32,482
MuktiBahini and
the Indian forces

1318
02:12:32,583 --> 02:12:34,517
have reached Chandpur.

1319
02:12:34,585 --> 02:12:36,110
Nothing has changed.

1320
02:12:37,388 --> 02:12:40,483
Who will save you
from your own people?

1321
02:12:41,659 --> 02:12:43,058
Islam,

1322
02:12:43,627 --> 02:12:44,788
Allah,

1323
02:12:45,262 --> 02:12:47,492
and the people of Pakistan,

1324
02:12:47,798 --> 02:12:51,132
have nothing to do with
your barbarity!

1325
02:12:52,837 --> 02:12:55,636
Don't you heartless people
understand,

1326
02:12:56,373 --> 02:13:00,810
that your power hungry leaders
Yahya, Tikka and Bhutto

1327
02:13:01,112 --> 02:13:02,273
planned all of this!

1328
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:05,515
You thought you will scare us
into submission,

1329
02:13:06,684 --> 02:13:09,051
but the methods
you chose to use,

1330
02:13:09,153 --> 02:13:11,247
forced a journalist like me
to pick up arms!

1331
02:13:12,323 --> 02:13:14,155
You will surely be punished
for your crimes.

1332
02:13:14,258 --> 02:13:15,748
Nothing will happen.

1333
02:13:17,294 --> 02:13:19,262
The whole world will stop you.

1334
02:13:20,564 --> 02:13:22,123
You cannot punish
every soldier for the orders

1335
02:13:22,233 --> 02:13:23,598
given by a superior officer!

1336
02:13:26,337 --> 02:13:30,467
A soldier only follows orders.

1337
02:13:30,741 --> 02:13:32,209
Hitler's soldiers also
tried to

1338
02:13:32,276 --> 02:13:33,266
hide behind the same plea.

1339
02:13:33,377 --> 02:13:35,641
But even today,
they are being condemned!

1340
02:13:39,817 --> 02:13:41,649
Hitler did not have
the support of

1341
02:13:42,219 --> 02:13:43,812
the American Government.

1342
02:13:47,391 --> 02:13:50,793
Come out of your dream world.

1343
02:13:53,330 --> 02:13:54,798
Let's say,

1344
02:13:56,300 --> 02:13:58,792
your Bangladesh
comes to existence,

1345
02:13:59,103 --> 02:14:00,127
then?

1346
02:14:00,804 --> 02:14:02,294
What will you gain?

1347
02:14:02,773 --> 02:14:05,208
In a few years,
your own leaders

1348
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:08,406
will fight each other
for dominion.

1349
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:10,779
In the race for power there
will be lobbying, politics,

1350
02:14:11,081 --> 02:14:12,344
bribery, corruption

1351
02:14:12,716 --> 02:14:14,241
will you be able to stop it?

1352
02:14:16,353 --> 02:14:19,653
Even if you catch
the small fish, so what?

1353
02:14:20,691 --> 02:14:23,092
What about
the real crocodiles?

1354
02:14:24,195 --> 02:14:26,289
That are hiding amongst you.

1355
02:14:27,665 --> 02:14:29,258
How will you find them?

1356
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:34,698
What about
our Al Badr and Razakars?

1357
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:38,502
They will continue to do
what they are doing today.

1358
02:14:38,776 --> 02:14:41,643
The bribery and the corruption
that you are talking about,

1359
02:14:41,745 --> 02:14:44,271
exists in every country
in some form or the other.

1360
02:14:44,548 --> 02:14:46,812
But we will make sure
to uproot the very seed

1361
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:49,652
of moral corruption
that you tried to sow here.

1362
02:14:50,221 --> 02:14:51,450
For the last time,

1363
02:14:51,555 --> 02:14:53,114
tell me where Fida is!

1364
02:15:02,099 --> 02:15:03,464
Forget about her.

1365
02:15:06,437 --> 02:15:07,734
Don't you remember

1366
02:15:09,807 --> 02:15:12,139
two held her hands

1367
02:15:14,211 --> 02:15:16,578
and two held her thighs.

1368
02:15:20,150 --> 02:15:21,709
How she cried,

1369
02:15:23,587 --> 02:15:25,282
how she screamed.

1370
02:15:29,727 --> 02:15:31,525
But she was good

1371
02:15:33,797 --> 02:15:37,825
and many more after me...

1372
02:16:34,191 --> 02:16:35,681
Malik was right.

1373
02:16:37,795 --> 02:16:39,354
Even today,

1374
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:42,224
forty-two years after
our independence,

1375
02:16:42,566 --> 02:16:43,829
we are not free.

1376
02:16:44,835 --> 02:16:45,825
Even today,

1377
02:16:46,136 --> 02:16:48,161
disguised amongst us
in flesh and blood,

1378
02:16:48,272 --> 02:16:49,740
the evil roams free.

1379
02:16:51,141 --> 02:16:51,801
Even today,

1380
02:16:52,109 --> 02:16:53,736
we live in hell.

1381
02:16:54,645 --> 02:16:57,239
And the gatekeepers
of this hell

1382
02:16:57,848 --> 02:17:01,216
are the same razakaars
that stole our paradise

1383
02:17:01,452 --> 02:17:03,614
from us forty-two years ago.

1384
02:17:07,224 --> 02:17:12,594
Chandipur, Jessore, Chittagong
have been liberated.

1385
02:17:13,597 --> 02:17:15,395
Tomorrow night at 9 o'clock,

1386
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:18,301
One contingent
of the MuktiBahini

1387
02:17:18,569 --> 02:17:21,539
will attack the cantonment
from the front.

1388
02:17:22,539 --> 02:17:24,701
We will attack them
from behind.

1389
02:17:25,609 --> 02:17:29,307
What happens next,
will be decided there itself.

1390
02:17:32,850 --> 02:17:34,648
Your tea is getting cold.

1391
02:17:37,087 --> 02:17:38,282
I don't feel like it.

1392
02:17:42,092 --> 02:17:43,560
Are you still with us?

1393
02:17:45,195 --> 02:17:47,596
Or did your war end
this morning?

1394
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,761
What do you think?

1395
02:17:52,536 --> 02:17:56,700
Amir, I understand
what you are going through.

1396
02:17:57,408 --> 02:17:59,536
This is the last push.

1397
02:18:00,444 --> 02:18:01,775
The last fight.

1398
02:18:02,679 --> 02:18:04,670
Once we have won,

1399
02:18:05,349 --> 02:18:07,340
we will all look
for your Fida.

1400
02:18:08,118 --> 02:18:11,315
We will surely find her.

1401
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:16,249
The Bangladesh of tomorrow
will not wield weapons,

1402
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:17,723
but a pen.

1403
02:18:18,295 --> 02:18:20,320
That will be
our real Bangladesh!

1404
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:24,734
Then, let's go.

1405
02:18:25,669 --> 02:18:31,233
Dark clouds

1406
02:18:40,584 --> 02:18:43,246
are getting ready
to adorn the horizon.

1407
02:18:45,322 --> 02:18:50,726
Heart in hand,

1408
02:18:56,467 --> 02:19:02,600
steer your boat with
utter care,

1409
02:19:04,341 --> 02:19:10,075
o boatman...

1410
02:19:14,351 --> 02:19:17,685
so the boat sink not,

1411
02:19:18,489 --> 02:19:24,553
in trying to reach the bank.

1412
02:19:27,464 --> 02:19:33,562
The river bank
could not be reached.

1413
02:19:38,108 --> 02:19:43,672
Dark clouds

1414
02:19:52,556 --> 02:19:55,082
are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.

1415
02:19:58,395 --> 02:20:04,630
In the city of Dhaka

1416
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:09,730
at the Rangbazaar,

1417
02:20:10,541 --> 02:20:17,470
where buying and selling of
colours takes place,

1418
02:20:19,683 --> 02:20:24,746
we are the financiers of

1419
02:20:28,825 --> 02:20:35,663
Madangunj today.

1420
02:20:39,403 --> 02:20:46,434
Tie not the boat
on those banks

1421
02:20:51,181 --> 02:20:57,120
we couldn't reach
the river banks.

1422
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:05,426
Dark clouds

1423
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:17,070
are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.

1424
02:21:19,743 --> 02:21:24,544
<i>- O Radharaman.
- Sister, let's go.</i>

1425
02:21:25,282 --> 02:21:29,742
<i>- I went to the river,
- Sister.</i>

1426
02:21:34,524 --> 02:21:41,294
<i>thinking I would
cross the river today.</i>

1427
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:50,104
<i>I had made up my mind.</i>

1428
02:21:53,410 --> 02:21:57,313
<i>But my day went past.</i>

1429
02:21:57,848 --> 02:22:02,410
<i>I couldn't find</i>

1430
02:22:05,322 --> 02:22:09,782
<i>- the other shore.
- Joi Bangla!</i>

1431
02:22:10,093 --> 02:22:12,323
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1432
02:22:12,696 --> 02:22:14,664
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1433
02:22:14,765 --> 02:22:18,395
<i>O Radharaman.</i>

1434
02:22:19,803 --> 02:22:25,742
<i>I went to the river,</i>

1435
02:22:28,578 --> 02:22:35,416
<i>thinking I would
cross the river today.</i>

1436
02:22:40,323 --> 02:22:46,126
<i>I had made up my mind.</i>

1437
02:22:48,632 --> 02:22:52,330
<i>But my day went past.</i>

1438
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:56,700
<i>I couldn't find</i>

1439
02:23:01,211 --> 02:23:06,650
<i>the other shore.</i>

1440
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:16,353
<i>Dark clouds</i>

1441
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:26,265
<i>are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.</i>

1442
02:23:29,139 --> 02:23:36,045
<i>Dark clouds</i>

1443
02:23:41,718 --> 02:23:44,050
<i>are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.</i>

1444
02:23:44,154 --> 02:23:45,519
Stop!

1445
02:23:46,189 --> 02:23:50,319
<i>Dark clouds</i>

1446
02:23:50,427 --> 02:23:52,225
Stop!

1447
02:24:00,704 --> 02:24:03,366
<i>Are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.</i>

1448
02:24:05,342 --> 02:24:11,372
<i>Dark clouds</i>

1449
02:24:19,723 --> 02:24:22,192
<i>are getting ready to
adorn the horizon.</i>

1450
02:24:31,735 --> 02:24:33,601
Abu, he's looking at me!

1451
02:24:33,703 --> 02:24:40,040
<i>Dark clouds</i>

1452
02:26:44,401 --> 02:26:46,460
Joi Bangla!

1453
02:27:00,283 --> 02:27:01,717
Run!

1454
02:27:45,095 --> 02:27:46,494
Didi!

1455
02:29:16,653 --> 02:29:19,350
Its not about an eye
for an eye.

1456
02:29:21,124 --> 02:29:22,751
It's also not just
about revenge.

1457
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:24,793
This is about justice.

1458
02:29:25,328 --> 02:29:27,820
The society, which does not
punish the guilty,

1459
02:29:28,131 --> 02:29:30,156
suffers the death
of innocence.

1460
02:29:30,667 --> 02:29:33,398
Till the murderer is not
punished for his misdeeds

1461
02:29:33,503 --> 02:29:38,600
every nook and corner of
humanity will suffer.

1462
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:41,744
I'm sorry,

1463
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,581
but this is also not just
about murder.

1464
02:29:48,618 --> 02:29:50,586
This is about brutality,

1465
02:29:50,687 --> 02:29:52,553
This is about conspiracy,

1466
02:29:52,655 --> 02:29:56,250
betrayal and treachery
with the country!

1467
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:59,285
These people have trampled

1468
02:29:59,395 --> 02:30:00,863
over the very concept of
motherhood.

1469
02:30:02,365 --> 02:30:05,391
These people have stolen
the dreams of the innocent.

1470
02:30:05,802 --> 02:30:08,328
They have divided us
by language.

1471
02:30:09,339 --> 02:30:11,774
They have even divided
our Allah,

1472
02:30:12,642 --> 02:30:15,475
into their god and our god.

1473
02:30:16,312 --> 02:30:18,212
Why should we not punish them?

1474
02:30:18,748 --> 02:30:20,614
Till the time
we don't punish them,

1475
02:30:20,717 --> 02:30:22,412
we will not be free.

1476
02:30:38,568 --> 02:30:41,060
Malik might have been right
in his belief...

1477
02:30:41,538 --> 02:30:46,339
but now,
it is time to prove him wrong.

1478
02:30:49,846 --> 02:30:52,474
H e had said that
their blood would flow

1479
02:30:52,582 --> 02:30:55,483
through this generation's
veins,

1480
02:30:56,452 --> 02:30:58,443
but he was wrong.

1481
02:31:28,785 --> 02:31:30,184
I...

1482
02:31:30,553 --> 02:31:33,250
I am a Birangona's grandson

1483
02:31:33,356 --> 02:31:34,585
but their stale blood
does not flow

1484
02:31:34,691 --> 02:31:36,659
through my veins.

1485
02:31:37,427 --> 02:31:41,421
My blood is as red as it gets
for Bangladesh...

1486
02:31:42,265 --> 02:31:44,495
and my Bangladeshi blood

1487
02:31:44,601 --> 02:31:47,662
is screaming out for justice.

1488
02:31:53,176 --> 02:31:55,736
It wants
unconditional freedom.

1489
02:31:56,746 --> 02:31:58,475
The kind of freedom.

1490
02:31:59,082 --> 02:32:01,710
I have seen
in my grandfather's eyes.

1491
02:32:07,423 --> 02:32:11,792
And today I repeat to you
what he taught me,

1492
02:32:12,762 --> 02:32:15,595
I am first a Bangladeshi,

1493
02:32:17,033 --> 02:32:19,024
then a Bengali

1494
02:32:19,569 --> 02:32:22,197
and then a Muslim.

1495
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:30,671
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1496
02:32:31,147 --> 02:32:34,048
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1497
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:36,676
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1498
02:32:36,786 --> 02:32:39,483
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1499
02:32:39,589 --> 02:32:41,751
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1500
02:32:42,058 --> 02:32:44,220
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!

1501
02:32:44,327 --> 02:32:46,557
- Joi Bangla!
- Joi Bangla!
