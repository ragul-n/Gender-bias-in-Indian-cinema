1
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:42,443
Shankar, who is coming?

2
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,046
Manohar!

3
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,452
What news have you
brought, Manohar?

4
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,456
Jogi Thakur, there's a bad news.

5
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,321
A police station is opening
in the village.

6
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:05,397
This is all because of
that doctor in the village.

7
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:09,663
Oh! So this is the matter!

8
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:15,338
He must have requested the Collector
to stop the menace of the bandits...

9
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:17,412
and open a police station
in the village.

10
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:22,411
That doctor will stop us
later first let us stop him.

11
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,680
You be here and others get
ready to go to the village.

12
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,017
We will go with them, come on!

13
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,029
Papa, what have you brought for me?

14
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:39,097
- Nothing.
- You are lying.

15
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,366
ls it? Okay, check my pocket.

16
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,372
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

17
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,049
This is a nice sari.

18
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,984
l know you're saying to please me.

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,390
l know that l don't
have a good choice.

20
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:11,664
That's true, if you
had a good taste...

21
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,002
then you would not get for
Karan a noisy toy.

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,396
- Stop him. - Okay,
l will go and stop him.

23
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,358
Leave me!

24
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:46,693
Stop!...What are you doing?

25
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,702
Don't you know him, he is
a very famous doctor.

26
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:04,381
He had taken an application so that
a police station can start here.

27
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,044
To curb us, bandits.

28
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,053
- Very good, doctor.
- Please forgive us.

29
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:13,990
Wasn't it your suggestion?

30
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:24,005
Please let my wife and child go.

31
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,732
What are you saying, doctor...

32
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:34,742
until you're alive, your wife
and kid will be with you...

33
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:40,679
but you won't be alive for too
long to see them with you.

34
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:45,686
But don't worry, after you, there
will be many to take care of them.

35
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,433
- Come here!
- Leave my child!

36
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,698
Take her away.

37
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:03,374
- Someone please help us!
- What can l do now?

38
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:07,641
- Tell me.
- l will do as you say.

39
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:16,048
- Leave my wife and child. - l want
to see how much guts you have.

40
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:24,397
Take this doctor,
pick up the gun...

41
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:32,996
aim at me and shoot me.
- l've not killed anyone in my life.

42
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,734
you mustn't have got into such
a mess before in your life.

43
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:43,416
How could you go against
the bandits?

44
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,021
Take him away!

45
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:05,971
Don't be afraid, your life
will revolve around this toy...

46
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:10,037
until l can hear this toy
revolving and making a noise...

47
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:16,980
you will be alive,
once this noise stops...

48
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,985
then only God can save you...

49
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,983
if you value your
life then go, run!

50
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:31,658
Now start this toy,
and begin running.

51
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:34,669
Go!

52
00:05:57,058 --> 00:06:00,357
Son, you run away from here, quick!

53
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,635
Mother!

54
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,027
Loot them all! Burn their houses,
they should not escape!

55
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:18,639
Don't spare anyone!

56
00:07:58,713 --> 00:07:59,680
Hey! Where are you going?

57
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,961
Leave my son!

58
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,971
Hurry up!

59
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:40,981
Fast!

60
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,385
You betrayer! Traitor!!

61
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:58,397
l will not spare you!

62
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:40,374
- What is the matter, Baba?
- He has run away from the jail.

63
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,651
The police has kept a reward
of fifty thousand for him...

64
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,522
dead or alive.

65
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,327
Mother!

66
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,002
Leave me!

67
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:18,001
Nobody will find him!
Jogi Thakur will die at my hands!

68
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,361
Manohar, didn't you recognize me?

69
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,695
l am Jogi Thakur.

70
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:50,710
Many years have passed by,
even l have changed...

71
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:57,780
l have toiled for years
in the jail...

72
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:04,389
and you have gathered a lot of
loot and are living peacefully.

73
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,661
Sunny boy! What is your name?

74
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,009
You both go out.

75
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:29,750
Sit.

76
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:36,018
- Why have you come here?
- Where is Raja Singh?

77
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,685
l don't know.

78
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:49,363
Okay...Kishanva...!!

79
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,441
Manohar's wife and kid
are sitting out?

80
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:57,703
Yes, they are.

81
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,379
- Kill them...
- Wait!

82
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:05,986
l will tell you.

83
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,986
Don't be afraid, sit down.

84
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:19,329
Now tell me, where will
l find Raja Singh?

85
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,003
Kishanva, you go.

86
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,666
Raja Singh has become
a rich landlord...

87
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,343
there's a village 100 miles
away from here...

88
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,410
Akalgadh, the entire land
there belongs to him.

89
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,743
He has a mansion, horse,
elephants, armed bodyguards...

90
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,679
nobody knows him as Raja Singh,
he is called Rajasaab.

91
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:45,024
Rajasaab!...Very good!

92
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:54,024
- What was that...?
- Kishanva is a little mad...

93
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:04,034
l asked him to go and he thought
he is supposed to go and shoot.

94
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,313
That man is crazy!

95
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:29,001
That man died a dog's death
and now it's Rajasaab's turn.

96
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,975
- No, master!
- Blind man! Can't you see?

97
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,716
- Let him go, master.
- Please forgive me, master.

98
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,651
- My son was coming under your cart.
- lf he was going to come under...

99
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,989
then you will try to stop me?

100
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:32,995
Please leave him, master!

101
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:38,665
A cheap lowly man
tries to argue with me!

102
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:54,416
Remember everyone...

103
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:59,081
if you wish to stay in Akalgadh,
you have to be under my feet.

104
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:03,622
lf anyone raises his voice
or looks into my face...

105
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:08,365
then along with your wife and
child, l will slaughter you!

106
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,647
Sir, l thought that you'd stay
in Palangadh with your friends.

107
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:34,991
Sir, this man is not ready
to put his thumb print.

108
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:40,057
His father too will
put a thumb print.

109
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:50,404
Listen, you cannot
return back my money...

110
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:56,415
l am telling you, it's better that
you write your land in my name.

111
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:03,615
- A land is like a mother to us.
- You save yourself or your mother.

112
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:10,953
Circus lovers, once again,
in front of you...

113
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,626
we present the brave young man
who is the pride of this circus...

114
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:23,967
the one and only...brave
and courageous...

115
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:28,644
this young man
performs the tricks...

116
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:33,316
can sit, stand, jump
from a running horse.

117
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:37,718
Watch his tricks.

118
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:44,653
You must have never
seen such marvels...

119
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:55,669
his acrobats are unique,
my friends...

120
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,012
they are unmatched!

121
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:08,353
While he is riding, the girl
rotating all around....

122
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:12,356
now he will burst the balloons
on her one by one...

123
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:18,360
look, how this brave girl
has risked her life.

124
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:25,370
Look how this talented man will
extinguish the candle on her head.

125
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:30,374
Look at the marvel!

126
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,382
lt's a new place, l thought
of going for a change.

127
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:50,395
Daga, l get scared when
you go for such outings.

128
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:55,399
- You went out in Bhopal too.
- l will not fight always, manager.

129
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,335
You are strange, now come on,
give me some money.

130
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:04,941
Son, l have gathered all
your money but...take this.

131
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,613
Manager, did l tell you, yesterday
l saw the same dream again.

132
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:21,358
- Oh, the one which you've been
seeing since childhood? - Yes!

133
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:25,295
One lane and a big snake.

134
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,364
l was thinking of one item.

135
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,698
you with a python,
a horse and one...

136
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:38,977
- We will talk later.
- But listen...

137
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,717
this is a new town, don't get
into a fight with anybody.

138
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:54,393
- Double your money!
- Hey! l bet for 10 rupees.

139
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,656
- The red one will win.
- Why are you pushing?

140
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:05,064
- Double your money.
- Put my money on the black one.

141
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,343
Come on, very good!

142
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,011
Hit that one! Come on!

143
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,014
Don't push!...Yes, come on, hit!

144
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,027
Now watch the fun!

145
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,027
Hey! Let's bet on them instead!

146
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,030
- Give the money you bet.
- Bet on them now!

147
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:41,701
- Give money.
- Here, bet on him!

148
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,047
Come on, get up!

149
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,779
- Get up!
- You wanted to hit me?

150
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,332
Hey! What about my money?

151
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,002
l have lost my money, let me go!

152
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:18,410
One..two...three...four...

153
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:23,012
five...six...seven...

154
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,012
eight...nine...where is everyone?

155
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:34,023
Nine...Ten...!

156
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:39,021
- Enough.
- Come on.

157
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,763
- Don't push me.
- You cannot escape me.

158
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,037
- l will not spare you.
- We will see.

159
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,442
First listen to me
and then get angry.

160
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:52,441
That man fought with me,
what could l do?

161
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:56,049
Whenever you go out, how come
someone fights with you?

162
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,707
- The same happened in Bhopal too.
- That man abused me in Bhopal.

163
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,644
- And in Jabalpur?
- That man dashed against me.

164
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:05,384
- And in Gwalior?
- l was drunk there.

165
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,325
Shut up! lt is never your fault.

166
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,329
Manager, you wait here,
let me talk to the constable.

167
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,669
- Sir, listen...
- l have already spoken to him.

168
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:19,062
He has already
understood everything.

169
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:22,003
- He knows it's not your fault.
- Shall we go then?

170
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,667
Let's go...listen,
say thanks to him.

171
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,672
- He is the boss of this station.
- Good bye, sir.

172
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:33,008
Tomorrow, his five kids and wife
will come over to see the circus.

173
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:52,368
- Let's go now. - Manager, is
he the same Jogi Thakur...

174
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,040
whose men had left me near
your circus when l was a kid?

175
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,045
So what even if he is?
Will you go in his search?

176
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:04,641
No Manager, l have to meet
this Jogi Thakur.

177
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:05,719
Where will you find him?

178
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:09,055
We have the news that Jogi Thakur
has gone towards Akalgadh.

179
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:12,992
You come with me.

180
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,989
- You will not listen to me?
- l'm sorry if l was wrong.

181
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,662
- l never thought that you'd
leave me and... - Yes manager.

182
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:30,332
The police may want Jogi Thakur
dead or alive but l want him alive.

183
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:35,413
Because, only he can tell me
who my parents were and who l am?

184
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,749
But Dara, before you catch him
and ask about yourself...

185
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:48,688
what if someone kills him?
- No, until l don't get my answers...

186
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:51,421
l will not let him die!

187
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,977
Who threw that stone?

188
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,645
Who could dare to do this?

189
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:18,514
See who is there?
Who threw a stone up?

190
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:26,662
Sir, along with the stone,
there was a note too.

191
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:31,402
Read it...Don't look at me!

192
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,668
'Raja Singh alias Rajasaab,
let me tell you...

193
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,674
that l have come back
from the jail...

194
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:44,416
now even God cannot
save you from dying...

195
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:52,014
your father, Jogi Thakur'

196
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,030
Come on, quick!

197
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:03,970
Hurry!

198
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,706
You betrayer! Traitor!!

199
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,311
l will not spare you!

200
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,652
How did he know that l am here?

201
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,661
Hey! ls there a place here
where l can spend a night?

202
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:34,729
There is! Go further
to Lajja Dada's inn.

203
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:40,404
- A good breed horse. - Yes,
his father has won many races.

204
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,737
Forget the father,
you talk about him.

205
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:47,672
l'll give you a good price
for him, l have big business.

206
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,214
Hey Junior! Will l get
a room to stay here?

207
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:59,686
Yes, can l take your horse
there, we have a stable.

208
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:05,362
- Okay but where is the room?
- That side.

209
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,970
How far is Akalgad from here?

210
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:15,375
l've never been there but, l've
heard it takes 3 days to reach there.

211
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,642
So now even you're going
to Akalgadh?

212
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,708
Here, once or twice in a month
someone would come...

213
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:26,383
to go to Akalgadh but now, there
are three people in one day.

214
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:29,386
Now even you asked, everyone wants
to know how to reach Akalgadh.

215
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,389
Can you see that black horse
who is being fed grass?

216
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,996
He too is going to Akalgadh,
that boy is your age.

217
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:42,661
Look there...he is coming down.

218
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:55,011
How can he catch Jogi Thakur?

219
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,956
Why do you think it is difficult...

220
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:11,354
Jogi Thakur is just a man,
so what's the big deal...

221
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:16,365
we are four of us and my
three men are already there...

222
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:22,704
let me tell you, if Jogi Thakur
is a thug we are bigger than him!

223
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,977
Only we will kill Jogi Thakur!

224
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:30,373
l am sure we will get
the reward money.

225
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:35,377
l hope someone else does
not kill him before you do...

226
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,318
and win the reward money.

227
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:41,718
Who can kill him?
Whom are you talking about?

228
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:43,993
Answer me, who could it be?

229
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:49,002
That one?

230
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,674
Hey! Are you going to Akalgadh?

231
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,612
Hey, you! What's your name?

232
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:27,963
Hey, kiddo! l asked your name.

233
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,308
You didn't tell me
what's your name?

234
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:40,317
lt's very late and l want to
wake up early in the morning.

235
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:48,394
You will not tell me your name?

236
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:58,399
Listen, you are drunk,
you should also go and sleep.

237
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:07,276
When l ask for a name, people
answer me, you too will answer.

238
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:43,978
Anyone else wants to know my name?

239
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,317
My name is Karan!

240
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:16,674
Let me bandage you
and come along with me.

241
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,747
- l will kill the rascal!
- How dare he attack you?

242
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:24,750
l was caught unaware, l didn't
realize when he removed his knife.

243
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:30,360
He too is going to Akalgadh and
there's a dense forest on the way.

244
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:36,695
We will find him and kill him there.

245
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,700
- We will deal with him on the way.
- Take it easy...

246
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:45,704
if we kill him, we may
foil our further plans.

247
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,706
- Don't you want to go to Akalgadh?
- No!

248
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:54,779
- Who are you? Chief,
was he the one? - No!

249
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,385
- lt was not him.
- Hey! What's your problem?

250
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:06,389
My problem is that you are
not going to Akalgadh!

251
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:13,404
lt won't be right if he goes
to Akalgadh in this state.

252
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:17,669
- Are you mad? - Listen, you
may insist as much you want...

253
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:21,410
but, he cannot go to Akalgadh
in this condition.

254
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:45,094
You will return back
before tomorrow morning...

255
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,433
back to where you came from.

256
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:52,443
Neither you will go to
Akalgadh nor he!

257
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,777
Hey! Check if someone
is taking the horse!

258
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:03,315
- Hey, Parsuram! - What is
it early in the morning?

259
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:05,990
l am selling a horse,
will you buy it?

260
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,651
You can sell it
after sun rise too...

261
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,054
you found this time
to sell the horse?

262
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:15,397
l can sell it later but then,
you will not get him so cheap.

263
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:16,535
Not this one.

264
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:27,012
Oh, wow! Okay, now l understand!

265
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,037
Sir, you choose any one horse
out of these, let that one go.

266
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,376
Look at this one,
he is a beautiful horse.

267
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:01,038
His ancestors have fed only
on the royal family fodder.

268
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:05,309
Now there is no royal family and
they have sold all the horses.

269
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,649
lt was so small when it came here,
l raised it up like my son.

270
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:13,651
l have fed him whatever
l have eaten.

271
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:16,996
l must have worked like an ass but,
l raised him like a horse.

272
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:21,330
So you like him, l was sure that
you can identify pedigree horses.

273
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:25,398
lt runs like lightning and it
costs only two thousand rupees.

274
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,408
- Hey! What are you doing?
- How much did you pay him?

275
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,001
- What do you mean?
- l've not come to buy a horse.

276
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:37,010
But he gave me only three hundred
...okay, now l understand...

277
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,023
Take this three hundred rupees.

278
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:31,402
''These spirited young men,
they own this world''

279
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:46,344
''When they set out,
the skies travel with them''

280
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,430
''The angry young men
with unyielding intentions''

281
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:05,971
''They travel with
the pace of the lightning''

282
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:43,733
''They can break the mountains which
come in the way of their destination''

283
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:51,011
''They can turn the course
of rivers in their path''

284
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,371
''Nobody can stop or halt
this caravan of life''

285
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,004
Who is this?

286
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,206
Nanku, look, Jogi Thakur is here!

287
00:36:55,715 --> 00:37:01,017
He looks like a city bred boy
but, he has a gun too.

288
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,954
- Hey!..Halt!
- Did you call me out?

289
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:11,630
Yes, who are you? And where
are you heading with this gun?

290
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:18,364
Brother, perhaps you're unaware,
an escaped convict Jogi Thakur...

291
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,371
has been seen in this region, there
is a reward of fifty thousand on him.

292
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:25,307
l thought that Dara...
my name is Dara...

293
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,374
l have a horse and a gun too...

294
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:32,644
l should go to Akalgad, who knows,
l may be fated to get that money.

295
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:38,991
Look at him!

296
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,328
Show him what we are!

297
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,006
He has scampered off!

298
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:05,609
l've seen a kite on the pillar many
times but a man for the first time.

299
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,277
- Where did you get cut?
- Can l get a place to stay here?

300
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:12,355
You have come and hung on
the right place, my friend!

301
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,961
Till l come out, you get down.

302
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,968
Now where is he hanging?

303
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:27,632
You've come to the right place,
in Akalgadh, you'll find only...

304
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:31,709
tea, milk, biscuits in Bachoomal's
shop and sometimes, l even cook.

305
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:34,639
lt's like a hotel in the city.

306
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:38,311
Enough from my side
now you say, who are you...

307
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:39,976
where are you from and
how long you'll be here?

308
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,713
lt will take a long time to answer
so many questions, Bachoolal.

309
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:45,990
- Can l first see the room.
- That's right, my friend.

310
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,651
You'll have to come inside,
l cannot get the room out.

311
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,992
Come after me.

312
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:58,197
l don't say l don't trust you but,
you look like a city bred man.

313
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:03,274
That's why, l would
like my rent in advance.

314
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:08,946
Someone has said right,
cash today, credit tomorrow.

315
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,942
So my friend, this is the room.

316
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,957
This is the room.

317
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,697
Bachoolal, l will be here
for quite a while...

318
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:39,645
is five hundred rupees fine?
- What, five hundred?

319
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:45,644
My friend, l am fine with it.

320
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:48,987
Bachoolalji!
- Coming!

321
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:54,651
- Who are those men there? - Don't
point, they're Rajasaab's men.

322
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,996
- And who is this Rajasaab?
- That was a good question.

323
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:01,997
You stay in the jungle
and ask who the lion is?

324
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,404
Hey look, he is coming again!

325
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:17,675
You've come back again?
Didn't we ask you to go back?

326
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:22,077
And where is your horse and gun?

327
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,757
Answer!

328
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:29,220
The horse you are asking about,
l've come to talk about that.

329
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:36,034
l told you my name but, l forgot
to tell you the horse's name.

330
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:42,573
Jamura...lt's a nice horse but,
it has one problem.

331
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:49,446
l don't joke...the way you were
shooting, l thought you were joking.

332
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:55,712
But Jamura felt bad,
l tried to explain to him...

333
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:59,121
don't feel bad about what
these three donkeys tell you.

334
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:41,363
- Why is my stuff lying here?
- Why are you asking me?

335
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:45,436
- Pick up your stuff.
- But you gave me a room?

336
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:49,041
- What room?
- Strange man!

337
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,039
l plead to you, when you could
not spare Rajasaab's men...

338
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:01,378
then l am nobody but,
if you stay here...

339
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:04,990
then along with my shop,
Rajasaab will burn me too.

340
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:09,992
l plead to you, go away from here,
l don't know who you are.

341
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,729
Alright, is there
another inn around?

342
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:19,402
My friend, after what you have
done, nobody in this village...

343
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:21,403
will make you stay with him
and get killed.

344
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,669
You do not know Rajasaab,
l know him.

345
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:26,339
l suggest you leave this place.

346
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:33,742
Jamura, atleast we found
a place to stay.

347
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:40,423
But what will l eat...that's
the advantage of your being a horse.

348
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:44,028
You can go and feed
yourself anywhere...

349
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:47,688
but what will l do, never mind...

350
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:52,036
sometimes it is alright
to sleep empty stomach.

351
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,992
Rest for sometime, l'll go and
check if l can get tea here.

352
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:24,002
No, l don't feel like having.

353
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,333
Father, it will get your fever down,
l will be back right away.

354
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,008
Cover yourself properly.

355
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:41,085
You think you're a strong man
that you can fight him?

356
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:45,019
You are too smart,
you keep all news.

357
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,428
- Will l get tea here? - You will.
How much. - One cup.

358
00:44:00,673 --> 00:44:03,972
l think she stays close by.

359
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,381
Where are you coming from
at this hour, my dear?

360
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:21,984
Don't you know, you're here and your
mother has done a second marriage.

361
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:23,729
l am coming from there.

362
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,728
You wretched woman!
What did you say?

363
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,668
Say that again!

364
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:41,737
You are talking too much!

365
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:53,019
Hey! What are you doing?

366
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:29,654
- Tea.
- Getting it.

367
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,341
Take this blanket.

368
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:51,016
No, this is fine.

369
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:58,420
My father is very sick.

370
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:03,952
l had taken him to the neighboring
village for treatment and got late.

371
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,624
You also look like a traveler.

372
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:12,368
Yes, l am heading
towards Akalgadh.

373
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,366
We too live there.

374
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:18,374
Do you know someone there?

375
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:23,982
No, l have some other work.

376
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:32,387
We will leave tomorrow morning,
you can come with us.

377
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:33,992
You will reach early.

378
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:37,996
Okay.

379
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:49,337
lt is quite cold, keep this.

380
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:05,952
Jamura, once in a while,
you should also wash your face.

381
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:09,620
- Gulabo, come.
- Wait, Sharbati.

382
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,969
Gulabo look, a man...!

383
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:22,303
Man?...Where is he...?

384
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,638
- l am here, lady!
- Sharbati, is he a bandit?

385
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,982
Wait!...Who are you?

386
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:35,383
- l am a man.
- Man...?

387
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:38,046
lf you don't trust me
then ask Sharbati, Gulabo.

388
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:41,724
Sharbati, he knows our names,
he is surely a bandit.

389
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:46,656
- Are you a bandit?
- No!

390
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:52,730
- Don't you have a mother or
a sister at home? - No!

391
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:56,404
No?...Gulabo, he has
no mother or sister.

392
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,010
He must not be having, bandits
don't have mother or sister.

393
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,943
Okay listen...if you're not a
bandit then what are you doing here?

394
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:12,680
Can't you see, we have
come to bathe here.

395
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:14,950
l came to see just that.

396
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:17,963
- Aren't you ashamed?
- l am.

397
00:48:18,197 --> 00:48:23,692
- l am a bit shy. - We must
complain against you to Rajasaab.

398
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,629
Oh! So you too are the subjects
of that Rajasaab?

399
00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:28,371
We are nobody's subjects...

400
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:31,977
there's a fear of bandits there
that's why we stay here.

401
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:34,977
We were passing with
our company from this area.

402
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:40,645
- Your company? - Yes, my father
owns a drama company.

403
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:46,388
We both have same lifestyles, you're
from a drama and l'm from a circus.

404
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:49,322
What, you work in a circus?

405
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:53,994
- You're not a bandit? - l am a
circus guy and you're a drama girl.

406
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:57,662
We both do the same thing,
entertain people.

407
00:48:59,038 --> 00:49:00,266
That's true but...

408
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:04,466
Now you find anyone else,
let us entertain each other.

409
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:09,613
- Hey move! Go wash your face.
- l have just done that.

410
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:15,351
- Coming, father. - l am looking
for you, where were you?

411
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:17,955
Don't you know that
bandits roam here?

412
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:20,352
Look here, there's a man!

413
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:24,360
A man?...Banke come,
let's see who this man is.

414
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:28,967
- Wonder who he is?
- Who are you and what do you want?

415
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,294
l am new here.

416
00:49:30,402 --> 00:49:33,963
You be may new or old but,
stay at a distance.

417
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:37,635
- Child, hide behind me.
- No, behind me!

418
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:40,978
- What do you want?
- Father, he is from a circus.

419
00:49:42,014 --> 00:49:45,643
- What? - He does acrobats.
- Oh, l see.

420
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:48,384
So what acrobats were
you showing to my daughter?

421
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:51,319
l was just talking to her.

422
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:57,992
- He was teasing us. -How dare you?
My name is Hariprasad Chatpatia.

423
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:02,400
l own Rangbirangi drama company!

424
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:05,059
l am a very strict man!

425
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:08,666
- Banke, get my gun.
- Father, this is a gun.

426
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,738
- ls it loaded. - Yes, it is
but, the bullets are fake.

427
00:50:13,112 --> 00:50:18,414
Move behind! Child, l've told
you not to talk to strangers.

428
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:23,351
Move behind l say!...Baanke, run!

429
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:25,019
Run, child!

430
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:37,699
Hey! Come to Rajasaab with us.

431
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:44,372
Again the same Rajasaab?
l am eager to meet this man!

432
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,441
We have to take you to him, sunny!

433
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:50,039
That's nice, after all we all
turned out to be friends.

434
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:55,713
Alright, let's go.

435
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:11,400
Bachoolalji, make tea for me,
l will be right back.

436
00:51:21,046 --> 00:51:24,345
Hey! Why are you getting into
a fight with me without any reason?

437
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,419
l was going to come here on my own, l
think you like getting into trouble.

438
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:31,750
Hey! Didn't l thrash you enough
yesterday, do you want more?

439
00:51:32,057 --> 00:51:34,025
Rajasaab is here.

440
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:38,689
Rajasaab, he had a gun too.

441
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:22,405
Roopchand, is this the army
you've made to kill Jogi Thakur?

442
00:52:30,048 --> 00:52:34,747
This boy alone could take
three of you to task...

443
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:39,351
and he doesn't have
a single scratch on his body.

444
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:44,355
lf you cannot save yourself
from this boy...

445
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,021
then how will you
combat the Thakur.

446
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:51,033
Rajasaab, you don't need
an army for Jogi Thakur...

447
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:53,762
l have come here chasing him.

448
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:59,372
- Come chasing Jogi Thakur?
- Actually for the reward money.

449
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:02,979
But Rajasaab, Jogi Thakur is
destined to die at my hands.

450
00:53:03,148 --> 00:53:06,640
l thought that people in Akalgadh
will welcome me with flowers...

451
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:13,982
but what your men did, l did not
hit them back much in my defense.

452
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:19,721
And by thrashing these three mice,
you think you've become very strong?

453
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,337
First, let my men
flex your muscles...

454
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:29,073
after that, l will talk to you.

455
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:40,681
l've not seen you in action
since a long time.

456
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:44,682
Raajasaab, l am willing
to fight this man...

457
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:48,024
but...
- That's it?

458
00:53:49,061 --> 00:53:52,690
lt's not like that, every fight has
it's own style and set of rules.

459
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:55,426
l want to know the style and
the rules of this combat.

460
00:53:56,068 --> 00:54:02,303
l mean if we come this close...can
l hit him like this?

461
00:54:02,474 --> 00:54:04,635
And if he slouches down then
can l box him like this?

462
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,377
And if he falls like this
then can l kick him?

463
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,309
And Rajasaab, is it a fault
to punch him in his stomach?

464
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:16,984
What if l thrash him on his back
or kick on his shin?

465
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:19,982
l just wanted to ask you this.

466
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:24,390
- What is your name?
- My name is Dara.

467
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,329
Banwari, give his gun back to him.

468
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:32,731
You have to combat the bandits
with a gun, not with your hands.

469
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:37,338
Like your hands, do you
know how to use a gun?

470
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,351
You can stay in Akalgadh.

471
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:56,692
lf you kill Jogi Thakur, you will
get a reward from the police...

472
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,692
l will also give you a reward.

473
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:08,700
Trust me, until l am here,
nobody else can kill Jogi Thakur.

474
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,036
They are Rajasaab's men.

475
00:55:16,014 --> 00:55:18,710
Sister...!!

476
00:55:19,084 --> 00:55:22,383
Be careful! Pilu,
son what are you doing?

477
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:41,332
There's only one hotel in Akalgadh,
l swear it, you won't find another.

478
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,008
l have one room and
l swear, it is vacant.

479
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:48,403
But you tell me how long you'll be
here then l will tell you the rent.

480
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:52,676
Perhaps two days or
perhaps, two months.

481
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:58,546
l understand, give me five
hundred...is that a lot?

482
00:55:59,057 --> 00:56:04,290
- No. - Alright then,
let me take your baggage up.

483
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:10,626
- You are back?
- Take this five hundred.

484
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:15,632
But my friend, you were there
and now you are here?

485
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:20,376
We had a talk yesterday,
this is my stuff.

486
00:56:20,612 --> 00:56:25,379
Sorry sir, l already fixed
the deal with him yesterday.

487
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,646
- That's why his stuff...
- Bachoolal, the room you gave me...

488
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:37,995
only my baggage will go there.
- l'm sorry, l've fixed with him now.

489
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:43,396
- That's why his stuff...
- l you move a step ahead...

490
00:56:44,035 --> 00:56:46,663
then you will not be able to
walk on your feet hereafter.

491
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,008
- Come here and pick up my baggage.
- Alright.

492
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:56,011
Bachoolal, if your
both hands break...

493
00:56:57,115 --> 00:57:00,346
then you will not be able
to lift anything hereafter.

494
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:04,954
- Keep my stuff in my room.
- Okay.

495
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,951
- Bachoolal! - l swear it, there's
a ditch here and a valley there...

496
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:12,691
what do l do? My hands and legs
both are dear to me...

497
00:57:12,998 --> 00:57:15,626
is the ground rotating
or am l feeling dizzy?

498
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:20,629
- Come on, pick up my bags.
- You are a strange man.

499
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:24,300
Why did you come without saying
anything? ls this your baggage?

500
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,307
Bilu, pick it up.

501
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:31,642
Come and stay with us.

502
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:35,981
How can you stay here, this is
not allowed in our village.

503
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,313
Let's go.

504
00:57:57,375 --> 00:58:01,277
He's gone but he has taken
your three hundred along.

505
00:58:01,446 --> 00:58:05,280
That was his,
now you stop trembling...

506
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,947
and take my stuff upstairs.

507
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:18,361
Come...Bilu, you open
the room upstairs...

508
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,624
and keep his baggage in that.

509
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,300
There's no need for that,
l can stay anywhere.

510
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:29,304
lf you can stay anywhere then
why not here? Come.

511
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:32,704
Surkhiya, what are you staring at?

512
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:37,981
Run along! Watch out from him.

513
00:58:49,294 --> 00:58:53,731
You've done a very good thing
by telling me.

514
00:58:54,099 --> 00:59:00,937
But let me tell you,
do not be afraid.

515
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:05,938
Nobody can harm me, ask me why?

516
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,605
- Ask!
- Why, Jogi Thakur?

517
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:13,347
One day, l was sleeping
in my cell...

518
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:19,957
and in my dream l see that
a Goddess is in front of me...

519
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:28,962
and She said, listen to me...

520
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:38,033
destroy the enemy!
Wipe them out!

521
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,380
And l said,
as you please, O Mother!

522
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:58,520
So Damru, now you can think
that nobody can save that Raja!

523
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:04,399
Nobody can kill me!

524
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:10,064
Help!!..Leave me!

525
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:15,005
How can l leave you,
l have got you in my hands.

526
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:19,676
- Help me, someone!
- Nobody is here to save you now!

527
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:24,021
Help, someone!!

528
01:00:24,189 --> 01:00:28,751
Hey, weakling! You were
trying to tease my Gulabo!

529
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:33,427
- You rascal, scoundrel...
- You weakling, feeble man!

530
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:39,366
- Why baldy, how are you
feeling now? - Stop him right now!

531
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:43,438
How dare you tease my Gulabo?

532
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:47,044
- Hey! Who is it?
- What are you trying to do?

533
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:51,376
You're asking me? Ask this
weakling what he was doing?

534
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:55,383
Whatever he was doing,
he was doing on my behest.

535
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,056
What are you saying? lnspite of
being a father, you were...?

536
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:03,718
Stop, you fool! You intervene
and spoil our rehearsal...

537
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,997
and now you are arguing with me?

538
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:10,395
- Rehearsal? - Then what did you
think, was this my final rites?

539
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:15,998
This ape of the circus does not
know what a drama is...

540
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:18,074
what art is and what an artist is?

541
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:24,071
- Hey, Khatpatia! - Yes?
- Take me in your refuge.

542
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:27,741
- How can l do that?
- lf you bless me...

543
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,349
then l can get everything.

544
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:33,024
Just give me one chance.

545
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:37,356
- Just once.
- Give you a chance for what?

546
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,020
- To act in your play.
- To act in the play?

547
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:49,698
You'll act in a play,
do you think it is so simple?

548
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:54,034
- But he has worked in a circus.
- But who'll say the dialogue for him?

549
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:57,046
Give me a chance then l will
show you what l can do.

550
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,644
Okay, l will give you a chance,
try and understand the scene.

551
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:06,319
- She is the girl...
- That l know.

552
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:08,992
- l am her father.
- That also l know.

553
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:14,988
- And l am the chief of this
hamlet, what am l? - Chief!!

554
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:18,335
- And you love this girl.
- l do!

555
01:02:18,703 --> 01:02:20,728
But l am against this.

556
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,406
- Me too!
- Your name is 'crazy lover'

557
01:02:24,576 --> 01:02:27,670
And this girl's name is...
l hope you understand?

558
01:02:28,046 --> 01:02:32,005
- l did.
- Then let's start the rehearsal.

559
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:34,014
l will quit if he acts in this play.

560
01:02:37,122 --> 01:02:41,024
- Phulmati..
- Khatpatiya, l am quitting!

561
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:45,424
lt will be a mistake if you think
about your 'crazy lover'...

562
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:48,430
don't think he will ever reach here!

563
01:02:51,069 --> 01:02:57,372
Love is not a sin,
he is a tyrant, not my father!

564
01:02:58,076 --> 01:03:02,706
- l am here Phulmati! - My
'crazy lover' you have come?

565
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:06,381
l was sure your eyes
would await my arrival!

566
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:08,644
And your heart must be
yearning for me.

567
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,989
- Not yearning, say love.
- Yes, you love me!

568
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:17,187
But this cruel world has
created a wall between us.

569
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:18,989
Never mind, Phulmati...

570
01:03:19,697 --> 01:03:24,999
today your 'crazy lover' will
take you away from here.

571
01:03:25,703 --> 01:03:28,194
- l can hear someone approaching.
- Let the rascal come.

572
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:34,341
- 'Crazy lover' you?
- Yes my love, it's me.

573
01:03:34,512 --> 01:03:37,003
- Naive man!
- Listen, O guard of the chief...

574
01:03:37,182 --> 01:03:40,413
l am taking Phulmati
from here today.

575
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:43,349
Soldiers, hand me over my sword.

576
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:51,028
Give me my shield, blacken his face
and throw him out of here.

577
01:03:51,196 --> 01:03:55,428
- Get ready!
- l am ready for a combat!

578
01:04:00,672 --> 01:04:02,970
Hey someone! Please help me!

579
01:04:06,678 --> 01:04:07,645
Hey! What are you'll doing?

580
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:17,988
Wait, l will come,
let me finish here

581
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,718
Nobody can stop us today.

582
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:28,328
Hey! He is actually taking her away.
Don't watch me, save my daughter!

583
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,730
He has taken my daughter!
Someone get my gun!

584
01:04:46,117 --> 01:04:49,746
- Phulmati, are you hurt?
- To hell with Phulmati!

585
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:53,691
Listen to me...

586
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:56,686
- Are you mad?
- Yes, l am.

587
01:04:57,195 --> 01:05:00,358
- And l am a lover too.
- To hell with such a lover.

588
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:06,693
- l think l broke my leg.
- ln love, even the heart breaks...

589
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,972
And you have only broken
your leg! - Shut up!

590
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:16,644
Now sit and act alone
in that play, l am going!

591
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,987
Wait, l am coming.

592
01:05:32,764 --> 01:05:39,328
''O my love, don't go away''

593
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:45,407
''Come here
Get lost!''

594
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:32,055
''Where are you off to?''

595
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:36,720
''l am waiting here for you''

596
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:07,283
''Go away from here, O silly man''

597
01:07:26,077 --> 01:07:30,377
''Leave me, let me go''

598
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:34,984
''l will never belong to you''

599
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:21,363
- Oh my! That far? - lf you try,
you can hit even farther.

600
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:26,970
- Try. - lf l learn to play so well
then all the boys in the village...

601
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:34,375
Only l can teach you how to play
to win a game!

602
01:08:35,012 --> 01:08:39,312
Give that stick to me,
what is your name?

603
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:44,714
Bilu, a man should only play
the games he is good at.

604
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:49,650
First see the direction
of the wind...

605
01:08:50,094 --> 01:08:54,394
if the direction of the wind is
there and if you swing this side...

606
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:57,325
then how far can this stick go,
now you understand?

607
01:08:57,435 --> 01:09:03,340
- Yes.
- Now watch me playing.

608
01:09:08,713 --> 01:09:14,345
Bilu, did you see, how far that
stick flew without my touching it.

609
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:19,616
Just think, had l touched it,
where would it reach?

610
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:20,958
Come with me.

611
01:09:22,059 --> 01:09:23,959
- What is beyond this ground?
- A river.

612
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:25,289
- And beyond the river?
- A ground.

613
01:09:25,396 --> 01:09:26,954
- And beyond that ground?
- Mountains.

614
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:32,969
Mountain...okay friend, now you
will find this stick on that hill.

615
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:34,972
Watch.

616
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:44,311
Go Bilu, go and get that
stick from that hill.

617
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:49,312
And learn to play properly.

618
01:09:51,022 --> 01:09:55,982
Because, a man should play
the games he is good at.

619
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:02,659
- What happened then?
- Then a strange thing happened.

620
01:10:03,034 --> 01:10:08,666
l was watching the stick and
it flew far away, in the air.

621
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,009
lsn't it great, he aimed at the
stick from such a big distance.

622
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,409
Okay Bilu, tell me one thing...

623
01:10:17,048 --> 01:10:22,008
you talk to him a lot, does he
ever talk to you about himself?

624
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:25,347
What can he say about himself?

625
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:31,425
That, who he is, where he is from?

626
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:36,090
Which town is he from? He must
have told you something...

627
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:42,706
l want Jogi Thakur
and that too, alive.

628
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:47,033
Why do you want him alive,
will you keep him in a cage?

629
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:51,374
Bachoolalji, whatever reward l
will get, l will give you half.

630
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:56,379
Really? Even if l get one fourth
of that fifty thousand...

631
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:59,047
l'll never stay in Akalgadh,
l would straight go to Sarangpur...

632
01:10:59,156 --> 01:11:01,056
and put up a new hotel there.

633
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:05,391
Okay but first find a way
to reach Jogi Thakur.

634
01:11:05,696 --> 01:11:09,393
Okay listen, let me tell you when l
went to the neighboring village...

635
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:17,201
l heard a rumor that Surkhiya gives
the news of this village to Jogi.

636
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,342
Get that?

637
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:22,672
Surkhiya, where will
l find Jogi Thakur?

638
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:29,013
- l don't know.
- You know, Surkhiya.

639
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:36,749
- You're breaking my fingers.
- l will cut them too.

640
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:47,368
- Leave! - Whom should l leave?
- Leave me!

641
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:50,371
- Where will l find Jogi Thakur?
- l will tell you.

642
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:59,374
l don't know where he
will be at the moment...

643
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:07,718
but tomorrow is 'naagpanchami'
and he will go the temple surely.

644
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:12,392
- ln the temple? - Yes he has
immense faith in Lord Shiva.

645
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:14,993
Whatever it may be,
he will surely...

646
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:52,365
Offer milk to the snake.

647
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,038
The snake will protect you, Baba.

648
01:14:23,093 --> 01:14:26,324
- Where is he?
- Who??

649
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:46,013
Tell him that l had come and
enough of playing games now...

650
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:50,018
now whatever he has to talk,
ask him to talk openly.

651
01:14:50,254 --> 01:14:51,346
l will come again!

652
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:01,961
He has come.

653
01:15:19,216 --> 01:15:23,983
l heard that you came to talk to me.

654
01:15:26,023 --> 01:15:26,990
So tell me.

655
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,393
l came to tell you that Akalgadh
is such a small place...

656
01:15:34,164 --> 01:15:39,192
that, only one of us can stay here.

657
01:15:39,436 --> 01:15:43,395
And let us decide today
who that person will be.

658
01:15:43,574 --> 01:15:49,012
lsn't this place quite
small to decide that?

659
01:15:50,314 --> 01:15:54,751
Let's do one thing, today,
after sunset...

660
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:01,353
let's meet in the ground
behind that hill.

661
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:05,621
- Alright.
- l will wait for you.

662
01:17:10,728 --> 01:17:13,629
lt is decided that either
one of us can stay here...

663
01:17:13,998 --> 01:17:17,695
but how can we decide
which one of us?

664
01:17:19,003 --> 01:17:20,300
lt is simple...

665
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:27,032
the sun which is setting here
will rise from there tomorrow.

666
01:17:30,014 --> 01:17:36,317
The one who can stand on his feet
and watch the sun rising...

667
01:17:38,222 --> 01:17:39,985
will stay here.

668
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:29,684
l will not let Jogi Thakur die.

669
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,424
So let me also tell you,
nobody is born in this world...

670
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:38,032
who can save Jogi Thakur from me.

671
01:20:39,736 --> 01:20:43,365
Bachoolalji, never
underestimate anybody.

672
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:48,369
Karan is really very mean, if he
lays his hands on Jogi Thakur...

673
01:20:49,146 --> 01:20:51,114
then we will be left with nothing!

674
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:57,779
My friend, the way every
morsel is predestined...

675
01:20:58,155 --> 01:21:02,387
the same way, every bullet
too is predestined.

676
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:06,393
lf your bullet is predestined
to kill Jogi Thakur...

677
01:21:06,563 --> 01:21:08,997
then my friend, Karan may
try whatever he wants...

678
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,396
only you will kill Jogi Thakur.

679
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:15,664
Bachoolal, l have told you
that l want Jogi Thakur alive.

680
01:21:16,173 --> 01:21:23,011
ln this attempt, my Sarangpur hotel
will shut before it starts!

681
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:28,015
lf l ever find Jogi Thakur, l swear,
l will fall at his feet...

682
01:21:28,185 --> 01:21:32,019
and tell him that brother, you've
been to jail even before...

683
01:21:32,189 --> 01:21:36,353
and can stay even now but
Bachoolal cannot stay in Akalgadh.

684
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:40,419
l plead to you, please get caught!

685
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:47,560
lf you really plead to him l don't
think Jogi Thakur will refuse you.

686
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:50,039
But...Hey! Gulabo.

687
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:57,035
- But what? - We have to
find Jogi Thakur somehow.

688
01:21:57,214 --> 01:22:00,047
You go to the village and talk to
people, you may find something.

689
01:22:00,217 --> 01:22:03,311
l will go the other side
and find out.

690
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:07,980
My friend, you think Jogi Thakur is
hiding behind this girl's veil?

691
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:11,321
lt's better to look
in all directions.

692
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:16,329
That's right, you must
not leave out any corner.

693
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:19,994
Go, you go and search
that girl's veil...

694
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,001
l will go to the village
and find out.

695
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:30,343
l am coming, Phulphuli!

696
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,025
Gulabo, why are you so angry?

697
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:53,026
- Leave me. - Don't shy from me or
l will come to your place tonight.

698
01:22:53,804 --> 01:22:54,771
Let go of me!

699
01:23:01,078 --> 01:23:05,378
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

700
01:23:06,683 --> 01:23:09,379
Tell me, what is wrong with you?

701
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:12,716
- Tell me.
- Don't ask.

702
01:23:19,363 --> 01:23:22,696
Did you meet him on the river side?

703
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:30,006
Don't ask.

704
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:34,738
Now l know, what did he say?

705
01:23:35,112 --> 01:23:37,740
Did he say something?

706
01:23:44,054 --> 01:23:45,021
Don't ask.

707
01:23:47,057 --> 01:23:52,359
Tell me...then what happened?

708
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:57,762
What did he do?...
Did he do something?

709
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:07,973
Don't ask.

710
01:24:09,012 --> 01:24:12,641
Don't ask! Go, l will not ask!

711
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:17,987
But tell me something,
what happened?

712
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:59,404
''My heart is beating...

713
01:25:01,044 --> 01:25:05,674
my anklets tinkle with joy''

714
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:53,793
''l went to bathe on the river side,
l met that boy''

715
01:26:02,038 --> 01:26:06,065
''He smiled and said that
he finds my face pretty''

716
01:26:06,243 --> 01:26:14,742
''When he smiled at me, l said...

717
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:21,012
my heart was beating fast
and my anklets tinkled''

718
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:07,193
''When l went to see a fair,
l met that lover''

719
01:27:15,378 --> 01:27:19,405
''He said, let me touch you,
my touch won't taint you''

720
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:26,421
''l smiled and l was trapped''

721
01:28:12,102 --> 01:28:16,402
''When l went to fill water,
l met that silly boy''

722
01:28:25,048 --> 01:28:29,007
''He smiled and said that he
would get drunk and visit my home''

723
01:28:29,252 --> 01:28:33,018
''When l smiled, l was trapped''

724
01:28:36,059 --> 01:28:37,686
''He wet my sari''

725
01:29:06,556 --> 01:29:09,389
Why, is your heart beating fast?

726
01:29:17,033 --> 01:29:18,000
Why are you all laughing?

727
01:29:20,704 --> 01:29:21,728
What is the matter?

728
01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:24,073
Don't ask.

729
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:30,407
When they'll be thrashed, they
will pay the tax for the land.

730
01:29:31,781 --> 01:29:35,740
Mansingh, till l come
back from Palangadh...

731
01:29:36,052 --> 01:29:37,417
this job should be done, understand?

732
01:29:38,188 --> 01:29:39,348
l have understood, Rajasaab.

733
01:29:43,059 --> 01:29:47,223
Please have mercy, master!
Please don't do this!

734
01:29:47,397 --> 01:29:48,364
Get up!

735
01:29:49,799 --> 01:29:55,760
- Please have mercy on him, master.
- l will not let you take this.

736
01:29:56,139 --> 01:30:00,439
l am a poor man, have mercy
on me for God's sake.

737
01:30:02,078 --> 01:30:05,445
- My children will starve to death.
- Did l ask you to sire kids?

738
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,050
Come on!

739
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,048
- Leave me!
- Wait!

740
01:30:29,773 --> 01:30:33,470
- Remove these grain sacks
from the cart. - What?

741
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:39,070
Dara, you do your work, if you
interfere in Raajsaab's work...

742
01:30:39,182 --> 01:30:41,150
then you will regret.
- Why didn't you say it before?

743
01:30:41,317 --> 01:30:45,811
Now l have already interfered, come
on, don't watch me, remove the sacks.

744
01:30:47,857 --> 01:30:49,415
l will shoot you if you step ahead!

745
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:22,053
Attack from the front,
only cowards attack from behind!

746
01:31:27,097 --> 01:31:29,065
- l will deal with you later, Dara!
- Alright.

747
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:34,463
Thank you for saving me.
Have a long life.

748
01:31:34,637 --> 01:31:35,604
That's alright, Gangu.

749
01:31:52,122 --> 01:31:55,614
A man should only play
the games he is good at.

750
01:32:24,231 --> 01:32:25,198
What is it?

751
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:31,801
What's the news?

752
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:37,870
Jogi Thakur, today l have got
the informer along with me.

753
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:40,480
Come forward, Surkhiya.

754
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,889
He is the one who gets
the news from Akalgadh.

755
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:52,820
He wanted to meet you since long.

756
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:54,492
Meet me?

757
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:09,165
To meet me, the police has
sent new men in Akalgadh...

758
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,434
didn't you get them along?

759
01:33:14,147 --> 01:33:16,775
How are they?

760
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:27,450
Jogi Thakur, you're the boss but let
me tell you that they are deadly.

761
01:33:30,764 --> 01:33:39,866
- Why have you bandaged your hand?
- One of them broke my fingers.

762
01:33:41,508 --> 01:33:45,808
Now l understand
things clearly.

763
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:52,814
Yes, now l understand
everything clearly.

764
01:33:53,253 --> 01:34:00,887
That, why you call them so deadly.

765
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:05,088
lsn't it because
they broke your fingers?

766
01:34:06,533 --> 01:34:12,438
By the way, l too
am very dangerous!

767
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:23,775
They broke your fingers now
l will break their necks!

768
01:34:27,487 --> 01:34:31,446
You don't worry at all,
did you get that?

769
01:34:31,892 --> 01:34:43,861
l have him...him...that one...
all of them with me...

770
01:34:44,504 --> 01:34:50,807
we all are in these ravines
and we all need food.

771
01:34:52,045 --> 01:34:57,881
l was thinking which night
l should attack Akalgadh.

772
01:34:58,251 --> 01:35:06,158
That way l can get food and kill
those two supposedly brave men too.

773
01:35:10,463 --> 01:35:12,829
What do you feel?

774
01:35:16,469 --> 01:35:22,430
- Answer. - The houses in Akalgadh
will not have much grains now.

775
01:35:23,877 --> 01:35:28,780
After a week when the harvest is
cut, there'll be a lot of crop.

776
01:35:29,616 --> 01:35:38,115
You're right...Damru, this
Surkhiya is quite intelligent.

777
01:35:39,159 --> 01:35:44,461
Am l right, Surkhiya?

778
01:35:45,498 --> 01:35:46,465
Jogi Thakur, l am just your...

779
01:35:54,174 --> 01:35:58,474
This Surkhiya told me that
his fingers were broken...

780
01:35:59,512 --> 01:36:10,081
but it was he who informed those
two about my visit to the temple.

781
01:36:14,461 --> 01:36:19,091
But before dying,
he gave me a right advice.

782
01:36:21,468 --> 01:36:25,427
Come on, let's go to Akalgadh...

783
01:36:26,473 --> 01:36:32,434
let us go and cut
the crops growing there!

784
01:38:15,448 --> 01:38:24,152
''The drums and cymbals play''

785
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:31,424
''A beautiful damsel's flared
skirt swirls in the air''

786
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:56,848
''The drums and cymbals play...

787
01:38:57,490 --> 01:39:03,122
the bells of my anklets sparkle
like the stars and the moon''

788
01:39:22,448 --> 01:39:28,751
''Your beauty is oozing
from the urn of your body''

789
01:39:38,531 --> 01:39:43,833
''The soothing beauty of your youth
and the radiance of your eyes''

790
01:40:51,137 --> 01:40:57,770
''l was naive, didn't
realize what was love''

791
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:13,386
''lt struck me when you came
in front of me as my lover''

792
01:41:58,471 --> 01:42:04,842
''l reside in the world of love,
come and hold my hand''

793
01:42:14,821 --> 01:42:20,521
''Take me wherever you want,
l am with you''

794
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,463
Where are they?

795
01:43:45,578 --> 01:43:48,206
Wait there, you cannot escape me!

796
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:47,605
Are your bullets over?

797
01:45:59,245 --> 01:46:00,212
Now tell me.

798
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:18,163
Let's go!

799
01:46:20,199 --> 01:46:23,100
Let's run from here!

800
01:46:48,227 --> 01:46:51,128
A man should play only
the games he is good at.

801
01:47:29,468 --> 01:47:31,834
Jogi Thakur escaped
my hands once again today.

802
01:47:32,805 --> 01:47:35,433
Once again, l was not
successful in my attempt.

803
01:47:35,675 --> 01:47:43,104
But for how long, till l am alive,
Dara or Jogi Thakur's men...

804
01:47:43,482 --> 01:47:45,450
cannot save Jogi Thakur from me!

805
01:47:45,818 --> 01:47:51,120
You know that and yet, you've
come to rub salt over my wounds.

806
01:47:51,557 --> 01:47:56,859
lf you've come to see my tears then
look, l have no tears in my eyes.

807
01:47:57,029 --> 01:47:59,463
Now go and leave me alone!

808
01:48:01,167 --> 01:48:04,466
Alright, l will go
and leave you alone.

809
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:08,399
As it is l feel that you have
spent all your life alone...

810
01:48:08,574 --> 01:48:10,405
that is why you
don't know how to...

811
01:48:14,447 --> 01:48:17,075
l don't know how and where
you have spent your past life...

812
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:20,608
that is why you understand
only hatred and violence.

813
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:24,753
But everyone in this world
is not like you.

814
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:28,825
l came to bandage
your wounded hand...

815
01:48:28,994 --> 01:48:30,757
and l will go after l do that!

816
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:33,098
Sit down!

817
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,601
Now you can be alone
as much as you want.

818
01:49:26,452 --> 01:49:29,421
Whatever you said
about me was right.

819
01:49:31,457 --> 01:49:38,420
But l want to tell you something
which l've never told anyone before.

820
01:49:39,799 --> 01:49:42,825
l've learnt this language of hatred
and violence in this world.

821
01:49:44,537 --> 01:49:47,768
And l can only speak
the language l have learnt.

822
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:58,450
However deep the wound is,
it can be healed.

823
01:49:59,485 --> 01:50:02,454
But you can never heal
if you hide the wound.

824
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:15,730
l want to talk to you.

825
01:50:16,769 --> 01:50:17,736
lt is about Jogi Thakur.

826
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:20,404
l can give you
Jogi Thakur's whereabouts.

827
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,068
Damru, you were Jogi Thakur's
accomplice since many years...

828
01:50:26,445 --> 01:50:28,470
so why have you come today
to give me his whereabouts?

829
01:50:29,515 --> 01:50:34,817
- Only for money? - l need money
because l'm leaving this village.

830
01:50:35,454 --> 01:50:38,082
But what l have come to tell you
is not for money.

831
01:50:38,457 --> 01:50:41,085
- Then why?
- Surkhiya used to drink a lot...

832
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,826
however useless he was but,
he was my friend...

833
01:50:44,463 --> 01:50:46,431
and Jogi Thakur killed him brutally.

834
01:50:47,466 --> 01:50:50,765
Today it was Surkhiya,
tomorrow it can be me too.

835
01:50:57,476 --> 01:51:00,104
Behind the hill is
a dilapidated house...

836
01:51:00,212 --> 01:51:02,112
tomorrow morning Jogi Thakur
will come there...

837
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:04,574
he hides there for days together.

838
01:51:23,769 --> 01:51:28,138
- Karan, who was this man?
- Why?

839
01:51:28,507 --> 01:51:33,069
l have seen him before,
Dara was with this man.

840
01:51:33,445 --> 01:51:39,406
- Who is he? - He is a man who
sells one thing at two places.

841
01:52:07,813 --> 01:52:09,110
Keep your hands on the rein.

842
01:52:11,483 --> 01:52:15,180
Oh! So it's you? So you too like
to wander around in the morning?

843
01:52:18,157 --> 01:52:21,126
Get down.

844
01:52:22,227 --> 01:52:26,186
Alright if you insist.

845
01:52:27,499 --> 01:52:32,198
- Now tell me.
- Wait here for me.

846
01:52:34,506 --> 01:52:36,872
- Here?
- Yes.

847
01:52:38,243 --> 01:52:44,876
Because, where you wanted to go,
l will go instead of you.

848
01:52:45,184 --> 01:52:49,484
You mean that man sold
the information to both of us?

849
01:52:49,655 --> 01:52:50,815
Walk straight.

850
01:52:58,530 --> 01:53:01,499
- l am going.
- Karan, you're making a mistake.

851
01:53:02,201 --> 01:53:04,829
Jogi Thakur will have
many men with him.

852
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,094
Take me along.

853
01:53:08,474 --> 01:53:12,171
- l will help you.
- You have helped me enough.

854
01:53:12,811 --> 01:53:16,440
For today this is enough,
you stay here.

855
01:53:18,484 --> 01:53:19,781
You will repent.

856
01:53:25,557 --> 01:53:27,457
Have you changed your mind?

857
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:34,190
l remembered that a man should
only play the games he is good at.

858
01:54:10,869 --> 01:54:14,430
Sunny, you want Jogi Thakur?

859
01:54:15,207 --> 01:54:19,837
Pick him up! Kiddo, you can
meet Jogi Thakur later...

860
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:26,840
first combat Jogi Thakur's men!

861
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:34,118
Hit him so much
that his bones break!

862
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:36,188
Tie him up!

863
01:54:42,568 --> 01:54:45,469
Now you wait and see
what l do to you!

864
01:54:46,038 --> 01:54:49,474
l will take your corpse
to Jogi Thakur.

865
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:51,471
Pull him up!

866
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:37,848
lsn't this sad, some time back,
l was tied up...

867
01:55:38,757 --> 01:55:40,452
and now it's you.

868
01:55:40,826 --> 01:55:45,456
lsn't it strange?...So this is
the backside of that hill?

869
01:55:47,499 --> 01:55:53,131
- My hands are tied back.
- ls it? My hands were tied in front.

870
01:55:53,505 --> 01:55:55,803
l met a man there who untied me...

871
01:55:56,241 --> 01:56:05,741
or else, l would be tied there and
you...you would be hung on this!

872
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:10,816
Why, what happened?

873
01:56:11,456 --> 01:56:13,822
Didn't you find Jogi Thakur?

874
01:56:16,461 --> 01:56:21,421
But whoever met you instead of him,
l can see they met you with love.

875
01:56:22,467 --> 01:56:26,767
- Will you untie my hands?
- l should not be doing that...

876
01:56:27,005 --> 01:56:30,441
but yet l will, you should
have not come here alone...

877
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:32,773
but yet, you insisted.

878
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:42,113
We will settle our scores later
but remember this Damru...

879
01:56:42,487 --> 01:56:45,456
he duped both of us today.

880
01:56:46,491 --> 01:56:47,458
Take this.

881
01:56:51,496 --> 01:56:57,799
Tell me one thing, l want to kill
Jogi Thakur and you want him alive...

882
01:56:58,503 --> 01:57:02,132
if l would have died today then
wouldn't your path be clear?

883
01:57:02,507 --> 01:57:04,475
That is true.

884
01:57:06,445 --> 01:57:10,074
- Then why did you save me?
- l made a mistake.

885
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:15,079
And l made this mistake because,
once, you saved my life.

886
01:57:17,122 --> 01:57:22,082
l don't like taking favors
or anything from anybody.

887
01:57:22,794 --> 01:57:25,422
Besides, l wanted to tell you
one more thing...

888
01:57:26,531 --> 01:57:32,492
a man must play the games
he is good at.

889
01:58:08,173 --> 01:58:13,076
''They are the best of friends
and the worst of enemies''

890
01:58:15,514 --> 01:58:20,076
''Their objective is
to risk their life''

891
01:58:36,468 --> 01:58:42,839
''They have fire in their belly
and thunder in their eyes''

892
01:58:44,009 --> 01:58:49,106
''These spirited young men,
they own this world''

893
01:59:01,093 --> 01:59:05,052
Dara, tell me one thing...

894
01:59:05,564 --> 01:59:09,466
why do you want Jogi Thakur alive?

895
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:14,400
Karan, the manager of my circus
told me...

896
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:19,403
that when l was small Jogi Thakur's
men left me near the circus tent.

897
01:59:19,778 --> 01:59:21,803
So, when l saw
Jogi Thakur's poster...

898
01:59:22,047 --> 01:59:25,813
that he had escaped from
the jail, l decided...

899
01:59:26,451 --> 01:59:31,411
l will catch him alive and
find out about my parents.

900
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:35,419
That is why, until l don't
come to know about my parents...

901
01:59:36,128 --> 01:59:40,827
l will not let Jogi Thakur die.

902
01:59:43,468 --> 01:59:46,437
Karan, why do you want to
kill Jogi Thakur?

903
01:59:50,475 --> 01:59:52,102
Do you want to know why?

904
01:59:54,479 --> 02:00:03,114
Listen, in front of my eyes,
Jogi Thakur humiliated my mother.

905
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,116
He killed my father...

906
02:00:08,827 --> 02:00:13,787
my mother saved me
and sacrificed her life.

907
02:00:16,835 --> 02:00:26,801
Dara, l have grown up
with these memories.

908
02:00:29,448 --> 02:00:33,748
The only objective and
destination of my life is...

909
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:36,487
Jogi Thakur's death.

910
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:45,762
Karan, l promise you that...

911
02:00:46,465 --> 02:00:48,433
even if l don't get
the answers to my questions...

912
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:53,828
but you will surely
find Jogi Thakur.

913
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:57,436
Yes, my friend.

914
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,107
Shall we go now?

915
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:08,048
Dara, watch out
from Raajasaab's men.

916
02:01:08,487 --> 02:01:11,047
By saving that farmer's life
you have invited their wrath.

917
02:01:11,423 --> 02:01:14,790
And you have made them
your foe by saving my life.

918
02:01:15,494 --> 02:01:17,792
Anyway, we will deal
with them later.

919
02:01:39,451 --> 02:01:40,748
Bachoolalji, one tea.

920
02:01:55,867 --> 02:01:57,425
What's happening here??

921
02:02:10,148 --> 02:02:11,115
lt's you...?

922
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:14,781
Get the rascal here!

923
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:16,844
Come on!

924
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,468
So he is the other one?

925
02:02:47,519 --> 02:02:54,891
l've heard that you both sympathize
with these poor villagers?

926
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:05,094
Never mind, today these villagers
will also empathize with you.

927
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:12,169
You swine! How dare
you look into my eyes?

928
02:03:18,483 --> 02:03:23,182
Look down!!

929
02:03:25,156 --> 02:03:27,522
l said look down!

930
02:03:28,893 --> 02:03:31,123
Look down l say!

931
02:03:36,501 --> 02:03:38,867
You won't look down!

932
02:03:43,174 --> 02:03:48,874
Rajasaab...just
untie my one hand...

933
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:50,480
then let me show you what l am!

934
02:03:55,787 --> 02:03:57,482
You will show me?

935
02:04:08,466 --> 02:04:09,763
Leave me!

936
02:04:23,481 --> 02:04:28,441
Lay them on the horses and
throw them out of the village.

937
02:04:29,554 --> 02:04:34,457
And hereafter, if you see any one
of them in and around Akalgadh...

938
02:04:34,693 --> 02:04:36,126
then shoot him!

939
02:06:46,491 --> 02:06:51,190
- Help me.
- Leave him!!

940
02:06:56,501 --> 02:06:59,470
- Leave him, you rascal!
- Mother!!

941
02:07:03,508 --> 02:07:05,476
Mother, save me!

942
02:07:16,454 --> 02:07:17,421
Mother!

943
02:07:30,535 --> 02:07:33,766
- Lie down.
- No, l am fine.

944
02:07:34,472 --> 02:07:36,440
How did all this happen?

945
02:07:37,208 --> 02:07:42,441
- How did l come here? - Our men
found you both badly wounded.

946
02:07:42,814 --> 02:07:45,840
- And where is he?
- He too is here.

947
02:07:46,017 --> 02:07:47,848
He got up just now, he is outside.

948
02:07:48,152 --> 02:07:51,121
Good that these men went out
for a walk there...

949
02:07:51,823 --> 02:07:53,450
or who would visit those ruins?

950
02:07:57,495 --> 02:08:00,521
l will arrange for some food
for both of you.

951
02:08:21,452 --> 02:08:24,080
Nothing has happened to me.

952
02:08:28,192 --> 02:08:31,491
How did you reach here
so late in the night?

953
02:08:32,130 --> 02:08:36,829
l could not come in the day,
Rajasaab's men are all around.

954
02:08:37,535 --> 02:08:39,833
Nobody can step out.

955
02:08:40,471 --> 02:08:43,838
Karan, he is meting out injustice
on those poor villagers.

956
02:08:44,542 --> 02:08:46,510
His days of atrocities
won't last too long.

957
02:08:47,478 --> 02:08:52,643
You're right, to end Rajasaab's
atrocities and him...

958
02:08:53,017 --> 02:08:54,450
we both are enough.

959
02:08:54,819 --> 02:08:57,845
We will attack his mansion tomorrow.

960
02:08:58,556 --> 02:09:03,118
Unarmed?...His mansion is
guarded by armed bodyguards.

961
02:09:03,561 --> 02:09:08,726
She is right Karan, we have to
get back our guns at any cost.

962
02:09:09,434 --> 02:09:11,402
Your guns are in
Rajasaab's mansion...

963
02:09:11,569 --> 02:09:13,400
and reaching there would be...

964
02:09:14,172 --> 02:09:16,732
l can think of one way...

965
02:09:18,443 --> 02:09:20,468
that is if Gulabo helps me.

966
02:09:21,446 --> 02:09:26,816
- How? - lf you help me then
we can support both of them.

967
02:11:04,482 --> 02:11:08,782
''My heart beats out loud...

968
02:11:10,488 --> 02:11:16,449
thinking where is my love,
wonder what will happen today''

969
02:11:16,627 --> 02:11:20,791
''l am also apprehensive.
l do not know where to go''

970
02:11:25,436 --> 02:11:29,805
''l have to meet him some day''

971
02:12:16,554 --> 02:12:20,854
''His intentions are not clear''

972
02:12:21,025 --> 02:12:24,461
''He has been eying me''

973
02:12:37,508 --> 02:12:41,467
''He teases me every time
l pass by...

974
02:12:41,646 --> 02:12:45,138
whenever he sees me alone''

975
02:12:45,516 --> 02:12:48,883
''He embraces me in the shade
of the banyan tree''

976
02:12:53,524 --> 02:12:58,484
''Why does he do this,
someone please tell me?''

977
02:13:56,921 --> 02:14:00,880
''When he holds my arm...

978
02:14:01,192 --> 02:14:04,491
my bangles tinkle with fear''

979
02:14:17,875 --> 02:14:25,111
''His touch makes me
quiver with excitement''

980
02:14:25,483 --> 02:14:28,452
''What feeling is this which
keeps me awake the whole night''

981
02:14:33,224 --> 02:14:38,184
''l have saved myself
but lost my heart''

982
02:15:29,547 --> 02:15:35,110
Friends, from now on, you are
free from Rajasaab's clutches!

983
02:15:37,221 --> 02:15:38,449
Burn these books!

984
02:15:39,156 --> 02:15:40,851
Yes, let's burn them!!

985
02:15:41,025 --> 02:15:42,458
These books are
penned with your blood.

986
02:15:45,162 --> 02:15:49,462
- Jogi Thakur, there's
a good news. - What?

987
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:53,859
Those two have captured Rajasaab's
mansion and he has run away!

988
02:15:55,239 --> 02:15:59,539
- And where is he?
- He is hiding in Palangadh.

989
02:16:00,511 --> 02:16:03,674
That's like it, now
l can settle my scores!

990
02:16:03,848 --> 02:16:05,406
There won't be
a better chance than this.

991
02:16:05,649 --> 02:16:11,144
Those ungrateful, spineless farmers
of Akalgadh, l will kill them all.

992
02:16:11,522 --> 02:16:15,481
l will perish entire Akalgadh!

993
02:16:20,197 --> 02:16:25,829
l have destroyed many villages in
my life, one more won't matter!

994
02:16:26,003 --> 02:16:29,166
Dara too is a victim of
your destruction, master.

995
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:34,444
- What do you mean? - His parents
were from Nambi village.

996
02:16:34,612 --> 02:16:36,773
He saw the ruins and
remembered his village.

997
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:41,440
What are you trying to say?

998
02:16:41,819 --> 02:16:44,117
The bandits had abducted
him when he was small.

999
02:16:44,488 --> 02:16:47,184
l've heard that they left him
outside a circus tent.

1000
02:16:48,492 --> 02:16:52,121
Master, he has not come here
to kill Jogi Thakur...

1001
02:16:52,897 --> 02:16:56,128
he has come to find out
who his parents were.

1002
02:16:57,501 --> 02:17:01,198
lf you tell about this to anyone,
l will cut off your tongue.

1003
02:17:05,643 --> 02:17:09,477
This boy's life is very dangerous.

1004
02:17:17,188 --> 02:17:19,418
Master, Jogi Thakur
has attacked us.

1005
02:17:24,128 --> 02:17:28,497
Now let me see who can
save you today!

1006
02:17:44,148 --> 02:17:47,447
Stop firing! Nobody will shoot!

1007
02:17:50,154 --> 02:17:52,452
Hey! Why did he stop firing?

1008
02:17:57,561 --> 02:18:00,462
Kishanva, wait a minute.

1009
02:18:04,635 --> 02:18:11,063
Here l am!

1010
02:18:11,842 --> 02:18:14,743
This is not the time
to show our rivalry.

1011
02:18:15,446 --> 02:18:20,816
Well said! Didn't you think
about this on that day...

1012
02:18:20,985 --> 02:18:22,953
when you took all
the loot and ran away?

1013
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,418
And left me at the hands
of the police?

1014
02:18:26,123 --> 02:18:28,819
l still have the loot
with me, Jogi Thakur.

1015
02:18:31,529 --> 02:18:34,430
lnfact it has multiplied
over hundred times.

1016
02:18:35,466 --> 02:18:36,763
l will give you everything.

1017
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:45,768
lf you want to talk to me
then come inside...

1018
02:18:46,477 --> 02:18:47,444
but come unarmed.

1019
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:51,107
What are you thinking, Jogi Thakur?

1020
02:18:52,816 --> 02:18:55,444
What will you achieve
by killing me?

1021
02:18:57,555 --> 02:19:00,115
l am willing to give
you the loot you wanted.

1022
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:03,788
Hold this.

1023
02:19:06,430 --> 02:19:10,799
And listen, you can
shoot him later.

1024
02:19:11,435 --> 02:19:14,404
He thinks he is too smart.
l am coming!

1025
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:17,407
Rajasaab, l am coming!

1026
02:19:21,845 --> 02:19:26,077
So Rajasaab, what do
you have to tell me now?

1027
02:19:26,517 --> 02:19:31,079
Jogi Thakur, our business is such.

1028
02:19:31,255 --> 02:19:34,816
Sometime you gain,
sometime you lose.

1029
02:19:36,193 --> 02:19:40,095
But why do you consider
me as your enemy?

1030
02:19:41,131 --> 02:19:44,430
Okay but first let me see
what's in your hand?

1031
02:19:47,538 --> 02:19:49,506
This is nothing, Jogi Thakur...

1032
02:19:49,873 --> 02:19:52,103
if you wish you can get more.

1033
02:19:52,743 --> 02:19:56,110
But before that,
we have to kill them.

1034
02:19:56,547 --> 02:20:00,108
Who?...Those two?

1035
02:20:00,484 --> 02:20:04,784
Yes, those two. Jogi Thakur,
if we join hands...

1036
02:20:05,022 --> 02:20:07,786
we can easily crush them.

1037
02:20:08,425 --> 02:20:11,394
After that, we can share
the wealth l have.

1038
02:20:12,496 --> 02:20:16,796
lt was your bad luck that you went
to jail and l managed to escape.

1039
02:20:17,768 --> 02:20:20,737
But we have spent years
together looting villages...

1040
02:20:20,904 --> 02:20:22,462
we have spent great times together.

1041
02:20:23,641 --> 02:20:26,405
Just trust me once.

1042
02:20:39,189 --> 02:20:42,420
Once, you tried to kill me
and l was saved.

1043
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:45,826
But today, nobody
can save you from me.

1044
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:49,624
lf you value your life then
tell me where is Jogi Thakur.

1045
02:20:52,136 --> 02:20:55,435
lt's useless! This man won't talk.

1046
02:20:56,473 --> 02:21:02,844
He is a man who will not open
his mouth fearing any power...

1047
02:21:03,147 --> 02:21:06,776
that is why, it's no point
asking Damru about Jogi Thakur.

1048
02:21:07,084 --> 02:21:10,713
He will not speak
even if you shoot him.

1049
02:21:11,422 --> 02:21:17,122
He knows that l am going to shoot
him but yet, he will not talk.

1050
02:21:17,494 --> 02:21:19,724
Wait, l will tell you.

1051
02:21:20,497 --> 02:21:24,797
Don't shoot me, Jogi Thakur
is with Rajasaab.

1052
02:21:24,902 --> 02:21:27,803
Where are they?

1053
02:21:28,439 --> 02:21:30,407
They both are old friends.

1054
02:21:31,442 --> 02:21:35,811
And Dara, Rajasaab
killed your parents...

1055
02:21:36,513 --> 02:21:39,141
his men left you near the circus.

1056
02:21:43,454 --> 02:21:46,423
- Don't spare anyone!
- Hey! Where are you going?

1057
02:21:48,459 --> 02:21:49,756
Leave him, you rascal!

1058
02:21:54,131 --> 02:21:56,429
- Come here l say!
- Mother!

1059
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,833
l plead to you, leave my son!

1060
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:07,508
l'm saying the truth, they both
have joined hands again.

1061
02:22:07,878 --> 02:22:10,108
They are friends again.

1062
02:22:10,481 --> 02:22:13,450
They are conspiring
to kill you both!

1063
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:20,455
So the killer is not Jogi Thakur,
it is Rajasaab.

1064
02:22:25,963 --> 02:22:29,922
One man go that side, they can
come from a shortcut too.

1065
02:22:30,501 --> 02:22:32,469
Jogi Thakur, everything is fine.

1066
02:22:34,505 --> 02:22:37,474
Lock them up,
nobody should come out.

1067
02:22:40,511 --> 02:22:44,880
''They reside in
the shadows of death''

1068
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:52,220
''Their life is in danger
wherever they tread''

1069
02:23:08,205 --> 02:23:14,838
''They are pursued by bandits,
wherever they go''

1070
02:23:15,879 --> 02:23:20,839
''These spirited young men,
they own the world''

1071
02:23:43,507 --> 02:23:46,476
Shoot the rascals!

1072
02:24:59,249 --> 02:25:03,208
- Dara, are you fine? - l'm fine,
it's just a little cough.

1073
02:25:06,456 --> 02:25:09,823
Oh God, l have only four bullets,
you have some more?

1074
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:12,428
l don't have any.

1075
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:18,167
Now what?

1076
02:25:22,205 --> 02:25:25,834
- Dara, look there!
- What?

1077
02:25:26,076 --> 02:25:30,172
We cannot kill them with four
bullets, they are heavily armed.

1078
02:25:30,547 --> 02:25:32,447
You cover me, l will
get that knapsack.

1079
02:25:45,829 --> 02:25:46,853
Surround them!

1080
02:26:01,578 --> 02:26:05,480
Go after them!

1081
02:26:07,451 --> 02:26:09,681
Rajasaab and Jogi Thakur
are in Bachoolal's hotel...

1082
02:26:10,187 --> 02:26:11,415
we have to get them out.

1083
02:26:14,458 --> 02:26:15,425
Let's go.

1084
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:19,429
- Kill them!
- Come behind me.

1085
02:26:21,865 --> 02:26:24,095
Shoot them, they should not escape.

1086
02:27:04,508 --> 02:27:08,137
Why is that man running away
like a coward?

1087
02:27:10,514 --> 02:27:12,812
Rascal...Swine!

1088
02:29:15,505 --> 02:29:18,804
This snake was haunting
my sleep since many years.

1089
02:29:19,109 --> 02:29:21,737
l could not remember
anything clearly.

1090
02:29:25,448 --> 02:29:29,817
But when l saw this village,
this lane and this house...

1091
02:29:30,453 --> 02:29:35,083
and when Damru told me that
Jogi Thakur and you were friends...

1092
02:29:35,525 --> 02:29:39,825
l remembered who my parents were.

1093
02:29:40,463 --> 02:29:43,489
l remembered who l am
and who you are.

1094
02:29:44,601 --> 02:29:48,628
Raja Singh, l will not spare you!

1095
02:30:42,459 --> 02:30:45,428
You think you can kill me?

1096
02:31:46,056 --> 02:31:49,025
l will not leave you!

1097
02:31:52,128 --> 02:31:53,823
Don't watch, take him away!

1098
02:31:57,867 --> 02:32:01,428
Hey you! Now you wait
and see how l shoot you!

1099
02:32:15,485 --> 02:32:18,113
Now tell me...Let him free!

1100
02:33:00,663 --> 02:33:03,894
By killing me you will
get fifty thousand...

1101
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:10,428
but today, Rajasaab has
given me a lot of money.

1102
02:33:11,474 --> 02:33:14,841
l can give you double of the
amount you will get in reward.

1103
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:17,437
Drop the gun.

1104
02:33:22,152 --> 02:33:27,454
l don't want fifty thousand,
l want you, Jogi Thakur!

1105
02:33:31,494 --> 02:33:36,864
Remember...the way this gun
is on the ground...

1106
02:33:37,834 --> 02:33:42,862
you too kept the gun like this,
in front of someone.

1107
02:33:45,842 --> 02:33:51,803
Remember the noise of this toy.

1108
02:33:52,916 --> 02:33:59,219
As soon as this noise stops,
try to pick up the gun, Jogi Thakur.

1109
02:34:15,872 --> 02:34:17,840
Son, run away!

1110
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:24,447
Mother!

1111
02:34:28,218 --> 02:34:31,517
l made a huge mistake of letting
him go when he was a kid.

1112
02:36:05,114 --> 02:36:06,411
How did this happen?
