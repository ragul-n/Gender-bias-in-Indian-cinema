00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:44,687
Dearfriends, the most loved
writer in Malayalam Mrinalini

2
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:49,892
Who has won booker prize, after a
long period has returned to native

3
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,869
Miseries of mankind roving
in the expanses of love and lust

4
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,067
Which is portrayed in her novel
named 'Rudrasimhasanam'

5
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,145
l congratulate Mrinalini on the
behalf ofjournalist association -

6
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,237
- and also from myself

7
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,879
To receive our token of love and
to speak few words to us-

8
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,918
- today Mrinalini has come here

9
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,250
Forthat may l invite Mrinalini

10
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,555
Greetings, because of the
blessing from previous birth

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,192
l was able to write
through those words

12
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,465
Through the picture l drew
in the minds of the readers

13
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,866
Those who loved me, my dear one

14
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,579
Forthe love which you give to me

15
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:42,284
My thankfulness, better than
l speaking more towards you

16
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,522
lt is better on a
communication of expressions

17
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,092
This work of mine, as readers
who read it in that context

18
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,291
You can feel free to ask
what you wanted to ask

19
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,097
'Rudrasimhasanam' which
won the booker prize

20
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,693
Told about the destroyed
feudal system and also narrated -

21
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,002
- on the miseries of salacious,
voluptuous dreams of females

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,575
On this what we readers
can't understand is

23
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,270
There are lot of mysteries
hidden in your writing

24
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,747
lf we feel that it a face mask
and an absconding of a writer -

25
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,310
- is there anything wrong in it?

26
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,617
Mrinalini, who is well known
as a writer in Malayalam

27
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,024
We would like to know
more of her past life

28
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,163
Nowhere in this book, it is mentioned
about your birth or

29
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,825
- anything on your life till now

30
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,130
Like the native place, parents
no references are given on them

31
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,727
Why is that?

32
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,572
You wrote even in old age
there is sexual craving,

33
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,943
- is it because of the angerthat
you couldn't indulge in it?

34
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,774
To awaken the nerves
of new generation -

35
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,011
- you are a writer who is suffering
from some sort of mental disorder

36
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,256
''Dear one, sweet dreams for eyes, sweet
bird with coquettish words''

37
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:23,529
''Under the shade of gold blossomed
tree, you a little golden bud''

38
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:33,403
''Hey sisters come and
render the blessings''

39
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:38,073
''Dear one, sweet
dreams for the eyes''

40
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:09,104
''On the branches sings the sparrow''

41
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:15,619
''Today within me, mind
swings to and fro''

42
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:25,095
''Hey beloved, beauty of your eyes
is tender, lustrous and immensely sweet''

43
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,964
''l'll murmur sweet song in your ears and
l'll sing a love song in a high note -''

44
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,333
''- that can reach up to sky''

45
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:39,843
''When desires roars like waves l'll
sing a lullaby for the entire night''

46
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,438
''Always by your side,
joy in your beauty''

47
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,915
''Yourtender words
creates a sweet ebb within me''

48
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:57,994
''Hey beloved, beauty of your eyes
is tender, lustrous and immensely sweet''

49
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:05,297
''When the dusk dreams, l'll search
for you with my eyes over the seas''

50
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:12,943
''When weaving the dreams l'll
make you sleep by singing a lullaby''

51
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,606
''Always by your side,
joy in your beauty''

52
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,618
''Yourtender words
creates a sweet ebb within me''

53
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:29,617
''Dear one, sweet dreams for the
eyes, sweet bird with coquettish words''

54
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:37,968
''Under the shade of gold blossomed
tree, you a little golden bud''

55
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,042
Oh! My heavens,
my god, my goddess!

56
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,445
Come running

57
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,187
What is it Janakiedathi?
What happened?

58
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,923
Molutty, elephant has
shown the signs of rut

59
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,530
Killed mahout Kesawan

60
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,365
Second mahout was also killed who
came for the rescue - My goddess!

61
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,020
Should somehow
inform father, ruler

62
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:39,231
ln the morning it was served with
coconut, beaten rice and jaggery

63
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,127
Molutty, he won't be calm until
and unless father, ruler arrives

64
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,764
l don't know where father
has gone, Janakiedathy

65
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,706
My goddess who protects our home

66
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,386
Ruler, are you sleeping?

67
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:14,088
l don't know why, Shivathanu, from
yesterday night onwards mind is worried

68
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,793
A feeling as if the goddess at
Manavathoor is standing on chest

69
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,434
Ruler, on your chest it's not
Goddess, who is standing

70
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,066
lt's Ummamma, who
is standing on chest

71
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,371
l've only one wish

72
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,346
Only l know ruler's right
and wrong doings

73
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,420
l got a life, l got love it was
you, ruler who gave all this

74
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,090
What is right for the ruler,
that is right to me also

75
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:43,022
When my breath comes to
an end, the secrets of ruler -

76
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,097
- also should come to an
end along with that

77
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,734
Shivathanu!
Yes - You were given to me by Goddess

78
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,736
Mother!
Goddess at Manavathoor

79
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,505
By giving money and liquor
won't get the love

80
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,433
That should come from the soul

81
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,777
Your love is like that

82
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,115
What Shivathanu, what happened?
Let me take a look

83
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,348
What a pity!

84
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,129
Ruler, the tyre is punctured
What to do now?

85
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,458
lf not reached on time Umayamma,
will get offended

86
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,259
What to do now?

87
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,612
Abhimanyu again got struck in rut
Hey ruler!

88
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,349
Says Abhimanyu, is again struck in rut

89
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,845
My Manavathoor Goddess!

90
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,806
To calm down Abhimanyu,
only my ruler can do it

91
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,410
Why seeming to be doubtful?

92
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:19,383
He will recognise the hand which
feeds him coconut, beaten rice and jaggery

93
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,784
When ruler holds on his tusk
as he is in a state of rut

94
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,590
He will come walking
like an obedient boy

95
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,256
Even if it is to any hell!

96
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,599
You may go

97
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,733
My god!
Father!

98
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,247
Molutty, you may go, to protect
fatherthere is Goddess at Manavathoor

99
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,942
Father, don't go near Abhimanyu

100
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,776
He'll become calm when
the rudeness subdues

101
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,447
You may go inside, l'm the one
who is telling no? You go inside

102
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,553
Ruler, you may come

103
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,659
Daughter
Father - Come here daughter

104
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,934
Ruler, go and call
just call son, Abhimanyu

105
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:13,574
Think of Goddess at Manavathoor
in the mind and call lovingly

106
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,296
What is it that you want?
l'll give you anything, come son

107
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,295
My Goddess at Manavathoor

108
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,468
Shivathanu, look he is Abhimanyu

109
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,342
He is my son

110
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,915
My life, as you've said,
l'll not give him to anyone

111
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,051
Look, now l'm going to chain
you on that wooden pole

112
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,917
As big as your body you have
a big soul, my Abhimanyu

113
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,561
Manavathoor Goddess!

114
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,772
My goddess, failed!

115
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,648
Son!

116
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,714
Father!

117
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,867
Son!

118
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,150
Move away!

119
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:04,036
Hello, is it po...po...police station?

120
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,758
Molutty, open the eyes

121
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,205
Move away fellows!

122
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,892
Sir, the astrologer had predicted 3
times he should be send to forest

123
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,090
Or else he'll kill 5 people and
demolish the ancestral home

124
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,762
3 people have already died
sirs kindly kill this evil creature!

125
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,211
Anyway should require
a consent letter

126
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,821
Daughter Haimavathy princess is
saying to shoot and kill this animal

127
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
Says she doesn't want to
see the father's killer again

128
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,561
Since it had killed 3 people,
there nothing more to think

129
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,120
No matter how violent it is -

130
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,599
- if it doesn't know the person
who feeds, then it's difficult to chain

131
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,502
Yes - To avoid killing
this animal that is ourjustice

132
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,670
But over here

133
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,209
As perthe new wild
life protection rule

134
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,677
No matter how many
people it has killed -

135
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,510
- we do not have the right
to kill that animal

136
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,912
But if the sleeping pills is
give in an over dose -

137
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,849
- sometimes death may happen

138
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,805
Elephant named Abhimanyu hailing
from Manavathoor royal family

139
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,932
On this day became, violent
mahout Keshavan

140
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,978
The second mahout, Manikuttan

141
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,809
Owner of Abhimanyu and ruler
of Manavathoor royal family

142
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,682
Neelakandaraja, son of Patmanabaraja
was brutally killed

143
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,648
For the native as
well as forthe compatriots

144
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,216
Found to be threat forthe life and
property, as perthe lndian Wild Life Act

145
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,295
Should be shot with a highly
powerful sleeping pills

146
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,992
Creature should be made to calm
down, as it is informed to compatriots

147
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:26,435
Must not kill, we have no
rights to kill anyone

148
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,169
Mother!

149
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,898
What is it Tanumama, at this night?

150
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,272
So far, a bold person who
hasn't chained any elephant

151
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:50,043
Will cover the sun with the palm

152
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,782
Has got the nails of an eagle,
earth's turning will be stopped

153
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,123
With a thumb of the left foot

154
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:02,192
Doesn't like females, he is a sorcerer

155
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,359
The deity is Pratyangira,
which is for destroying the foes

156
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,499
At mid night will immerse in the
pond and argue with Goddess

157
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,102
lt seems he is Rudhran,
he is Rudra Simhan

158
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,242
Will he again go from here?

159
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,249
Told he is going
To where?

160
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,154
Whole day l was wandering
in search of a mahout

161
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:36,161
After my dear ruler's body is burned
to ashes, if l continue to stay here

162
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,560
That is only because of thinking
of daughter - Thanumama

163
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,168
During a rainy season when
came by swimming the river

164
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:48,940
Gave a place to sleep and food
to eat, my ruler is god to me

165
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,574
To look after royal family and
Haimavathy, l was given by Goddess

166
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,315
Always used to say that

167
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:06,094
Do not cry, you are the daughter of
a great father, you are the next heir

168
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,832
Mother, protect

169
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,048
Goddess, actually who
is this Rudra Simhan?

170
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,136
Abhimanyu, will again
show the signs of rut

171
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,642
lf an elephant becomes
lunatic it can be chained

172
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,136
But females

173
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,571
They can't be chained

174
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,679
There is a big gap for
the windows in here

175
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,520
That should be closed

176
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,053
lf not...

177
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:34,148
Don't leave me and this royal family
and go, l don't know who you are

178
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,352
l don't know what is
happening over here

179
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,356
l'm a girl who has lost everything

180
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,996
Princess, kindly get up

181
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,229
Shouldn't call me like that

182
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,564
l'm Rudran

183
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,941
Rudra Simhan

184
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,011
l've affirmed it in the mind, that
l'll fail only in two places

185
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,945
One is my death and other is in
front of deity which l worship

186
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,557
The mighty Pratyangira

187
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,761
God and death will not cheat

188
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,628
l have not come here
upon your invitation

189
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,462
At the right time l came
at the right place

190
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:28,672
lt is only a destiny, destiny no one
has got the rights to say don't go

191
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,448
To say don't know
whetherthere is right

192
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,013
lf it is a stupidity kindly pardon

193
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,618
ln such a situation don't
leave us and go

194
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:57,428
Until the princess gets married, you
should be here as a shelter for us

195
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:03,263
Marriage, this princess doesn't
have the luck for a married life

196
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,002
My goodness
Husband won't live

197
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,677
Won't happen anything to virginity

198
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,309
Some astrological fools will slide
away saying it's a previous birth curse

199
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:22,285
And then..A person will come who
loves princess more than his soul

200
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,793
Princess will be filled with love

201
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,027
Princess will keep him
close to her heart

202
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,431
With the burden of
dreams that he gives

203
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,399
Princess will continue to live
for the remaining years

204
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,468
Let it take place

205
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,783
Who is he?
l don't know

206
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,788
But for me..Towards him..
My god

207
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,324
What are you saying?

208
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:59,086
There are certain evil spells which
can arrest rich, beautiful girl's mind

209
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,631
And also some sorcerers
with a single glance

210
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,328
With a single word any strong
mind can become a drop of snow

211
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,665
Right now l understood that

212
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,306
This man, this Rudran is a sorcerer

213
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,467
A very native one
Enough!

214
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,210
Aren't you Harikrishnan?

215
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,375
Son of Thanumama
Yes

216
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,586
You have become very
handsome like a ripened banana

217
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,892
When l last saw you, you
were like a dry paddy field

218
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,461
How come, now you are here
l'm checking the accounts

219
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,325
Do you know me?
ls it Mohini Chitta?

220
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,836
All that which had happened here?
l came to know that

221
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,602
When l got the news, it was late

222
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,471
This Mohini doesn't believe
in tears and pretensions

223
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:25,439
What is destined to happen will take
place, l was on a pilgrimage tour

224
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,279
At Rishikesh,
- Shall l go?

225
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,949
Harikrishna!

226
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,154
l want to see you

227
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,288
Alone

228
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,627
Won't you come?

229
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,279
l came to know about everything

230
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,445
Just console thinking it is just fate

231
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,725
Daughter you are the main
pillar of this royal family

232
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,325
Then the Goddess,
serpents, what you say

233
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,299
The lives of the remaining people
either live and sacrifice and finish it

234
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,834
Really fatigue due to journey, should
take a bath and should have some sleep

235
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,408
The big Lord had taken care of her
like his own daughter

236
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,283
At least to console you, can't
she shed some tears and go?

237
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,017
Certain ladies with these
kind of character!

238
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,945
No need Janakiedathi, what
Mohini Chitta said is true

239
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,826
She doesn't know to
show off and to be pretentious

240
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,530
Her mind is pure like tears

241
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:11,421
Brother alight fast, alight
fast, Yea get on, just go inside

242
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,699
l want to meet Princess Haimavathy
Who is it?

243
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,566
Abdulla! - Came to
inspect the elephant

244
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,404
Who has chopped off this one, this
will get ripe only after one month, is it?

245
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,741
l shall call the Princess

246
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,297
Princess is calling

247
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,569
Who is it?

248
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,732
Abdulla
Who has said and came? - Ustad

249
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,072
From which native are you?

250
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,472
Ponnani, do you know?
Has not come but has heard

251
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,919
Are you experienced in
the field of elephants?

252
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,412
Not experienced with taking them
but experienced in making them obey

253
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,687
Anyone can take an elephant but
on his tuskers there should be a hold

254
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,723
That hold will make
a knot on this brain

255
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,329
At that time it will know the strength
of the person who holds him

256
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,332
Don't you know about Abhimanyu?

257
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,667
3 people were...

258
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,470
Princess, elephant taming is death

259
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,477
At any moment it'll crush

260
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,743
Even after giving as much as
sugar cane and jaggery

261
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,082
Lord in here was stamped and killed

262
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,791
When a tusker in rut, by magic
spells in brain, can be calmed

263
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,960
l've come as my Ustad has told

264
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,992
Rudrasimhan

265
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,502
That l don't know

266
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,731
For me he is Ustad, a bold Ustad

267
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,973
While asking the sky,
he'll catch and give

268
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,810
He has got no names and no native

269
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,637
What he has got is a soul

270
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,540
By the god's will, god has
given his soul to him

271
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,646
Doesn't want to hear
about your Ustad

272
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,491
What is the price, fix the deal
and settle it - Princess, who is he?

273
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,390
He is the manager, Shivathanumama

274
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,827
Let him go and stand nearthe
kitchen simply to create job for my hands

275
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,863
Thanumama, you may go

276
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,002
l'll talk to Abdulla

277
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:08,030
Princess, kindly stop, is
ourtutor Rudran there?

278
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,195
Rudrasimhan, do you know him?

279
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,592
Python, which startled
a whole native -

280
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,706
- compatriots who exaggerated
saying it has got ten heads

281
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,806
Within a single night it was caught
and slept making it a pillow

282
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,209
lt was carried on his back
and he strolled down the hill

283
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,210
l'll never forget Princess, he is a
great mystic, a great mystic

284
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,592
''Because of you a
festival mood within me''

285
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:15,963
''During these times will
salvation awaken in me?''

286
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,503
''Hey mirror, a coquettish
talk with me''

287
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:28,506
''This song is in search
for some music''

288
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:35,947
''Finds the depth of this night''

289
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:41,587
''Beside me, beside me''

290
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,192
''Various expressions of love''

291
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:25,632
''Becomes a flame of
light within you''

292
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,896
''Joy becomes like honey''

293
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,875
''Within me like a line of desire''

294
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:44,677
''Stars, your blushful
face became very tender''

295
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:50,188
''You became a tender
figure in the soul''

296
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:56,292
''Hey mirror, a coquettish
talk with me''

297
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:02,767
''This song is in search
for some music''

298
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:09,378
''Finds the depth of this night''

299
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:15,716
''Beside me, beside me''

300
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,131
l must go
You may go

301
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,709
Princess Haimavathy is asking

302
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,465
Harikrishna!

303
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,400
When the sun sets and rises
there is a swelling up in the heart

304
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,904
Before knowing a male what
if the menopause takes place?

305
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,105
My soul will wander through
out this royal Manson

306
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:24,278
ln the serpent temple, the serpents
which are in stone will curb my marriage

307
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,382
ln this birth what harm
did l do to them?

308
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,453
Shall l go?

309
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,131
At night l'll be waiting at the
serpent temple - l must go

310
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,103
Boy, don't tell anyone

311
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,041
Mohini

312
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:07,088
Mohini, for human beings
there is only one birth

313
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:13,403
Whatever which makes us mad,
we should own it at any cost

314
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:22,971
Neverthink of the age, whatever a
female wants, it is not deteriorated in me

315
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,212
Then Harikrishnan

316
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,553
l have set him apart
for Princess Haimavathy

317
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,749
Never mind you also take some

318
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,915
So that he can end his shyness

319
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,359
By the way

320
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,831
He shouldn't know l knew
that, l have some aims

321
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,996
To oppose that l'll not allow anyone

322
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:52,539
Savithri, that was one of
the names of my mother

323
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,247
Because of wrong doings,
whoever comes at night -

324
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,215
- they called mother
by different names

325
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,576
On one of those nights when
own mother was sleeping

326
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,386
l killed her by hitting on her head

327
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:09,387
On that day, the fled l made, after
circling around the earth, stopped here

328
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:16,229
When seeing a girl between the
door slides of this royal Manson

329
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,800
A desire grew inside me

330
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,564
On knowing that menstrual cycle
had halted, Lord married her to me

331
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,897
She gave birth to him, Harikrishnan

332
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,409
By the way, mother
died due to epilepsy

333
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:34,880
But that is not the truth, she
saw me hugging another girl

334
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,150
She is a female, no?
Will cook up that in the mind -

335
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,916
- and later she'll turn to be a foe

336
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:45,920
Didn't think more, just at the navel
an application using the right foot thumb

337
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,121
Only spilled two drops of blood

338
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,460
Carried her on the shoulders and
dumped her into unused well

339
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,234
A married life comes to
an end over there

340
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,437
That is what this Shivathanu is

341
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,139
l'm trying to make Harikrishnan
become close to Haimavathy

342
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:10,082
When Haimavathy goes to pond to
bathe, l was coaching him to entice her

343
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,951
He is a timid fellow, all the more
he was showing some progress

344
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,955
At that time that elephant had
a deadly signs of insanity

345
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,131
To chain him another person's entry

346
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:28,593
l won't spare, l won't spare anyone

347
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,606
Princess!

348
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,211
What is it Harikrishnan?

349
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:43,977
Fathertold to write all the
accounts and show it to Princess -

350
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,249
- and get it signed at
the end of every week

351
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,193
How is that mahout Abdulla?
He is insane

352
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,534
Elephant is a prestige for
the royal family

353
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,707
But in the present situation
taking into consideration -

354
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,505
- on revenues over
here, that is a loss

355
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,505
Lord, was having an
obsession towards elephants

356
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,080
But that obsession what happened
at last, l need not have to say that

357
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:22,055
Presently Thanumama's words,
looks, movements it has changed a lot

358
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,522
Was along with father,
Thanumama knows the things -

359
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,690
- that is delegated by father

360
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,066
After that everything is
known to advocate Mukkodan

361
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:39,538
People and animals which are
around, l can only live trusting them

362
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,406
When you tell me to sign

363
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:49,417
Also to sign
l'll always be here itself

364
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,212
Beside my Molutty

365
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:59,085
Until this breath comes to an end,
l've not come here now to say all this

366
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,256
Whatever which Lord has left
behind, all though can't do more than it

367
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,129
Right now whatever l can do is

368
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:09,604
At present an alliance has come
from Nedumpattu royal family for Mohini

369
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,776
And then?
The groom is abroad

370
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,212
Over there in America, Nedumpattu
royal family has deteriorated

371
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,077
Overthere, there is no
wealth or property

372
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,251
Has not asked or mentioned
anything on bad omen in horoscope

373
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,410
That is also Mohini's blessing

374
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,453
Has told the groom to come
and see the bride to be

375
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,488
Let them come and see
her, they will like her

376
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:50,071
Team  DrC    Release

377
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,514
Did you see?

378
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:05,094
Craved on the granite deities of
serpents without feelings and thoughts

379
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:10,327
Even the sculptor who created this
has got blood, sweat and desires

380
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,802
After displaying all this over here -

381
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,266
- even the priest has got
everything which is mentioned

382
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,774
Serpents are the
soul of the universe

383
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,185
The forces which controls
the humidity of the earth

384
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,685
Shouldn't speak like this

385
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,751
l've got a severe desire
to know a male

386
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,192
l want you for one night

387
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,294
Harikrishna, don't you want me?

388
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:15,663
Harikrishna, are you a stone
without flesh and blood?

389
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:20,293
You wait and see l'll disdain all my
desires and l'll kill myself over here

390
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:24,131
l'll wander over here as an evil spirit
with an unending vengeance

391
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,209
l'll not give married life to
any males orfemales

392
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,869
On that cure you will be
also burned to ashes

393
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:48,261
3 People who looked after so
well, they were crushed to death -

394
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,766
- look at the way it is standing?
As if it doesn't know anything

395
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:03,777
l want to sell his skull getting
scattered in this soil of elephant cradle

396
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:15,116
Team  DrC    Release

397
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,584
Not me

398
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,892
He is the one, he is the one who
knows the inside of human beings

399
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,832
Once upon a time Muslims will stand
outside the entrance of royal Manson

400
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,408
Alms will be given outside -

401
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,740
- they will take it and bow
hands and walk backwards

402
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,241
And now?

403
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,711
You also don't speak
that much superiority

404
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,484
l was told about the cheating done
over here which no one knows

405
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,819
By Ustad!
Stupid, talking nonsense

406
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,188
You rogue what did you call?

407
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:57,422
My Ustad has taught me one trick,
how to behave to creatures like you

408
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:03,272
lf l twist this fore finger inside your
ribs, do you know what'll happen?

409
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:08,306
Then you will lie down in the purge
of the food eaten 90 days back

410
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,282
On this earth there are lot
of people with men's face

411
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,785
But if an ant enters into the nail of
this tuckerthat is standing here

412
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,015
There is a person present
who understands that

413
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,883
That is my Ustad

414
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,821
Only that body of that Ustad has
gone from here, mind is still here

415
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,824
At the very nook and corner
of this royal Manson

416
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,306
Thanumama, while walking you
should be more careful, isn't it?

417
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,975
While getting old, sight of
the eyes will be reduced

418
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,879
Get one good spectacles and
put on the verge of the nose

419
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,811
The leg got slipped but did get hurt

420
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,421
What a nice man, isn't it Princess?

421
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,619
Princess, you may come,
let him see you closely

422
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,793
No need
Why getting scared?

423
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,660
He is a poor animal, Princess
you may come, come

424
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,840
Please come without fear, hey
Abhimanyu, Princess has come to see you

425
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:19,313
Just give a grand greeting
by lifting that trunk

426
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,713
Princess, he is saying something

427
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,287
You may go near him

428
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,997
Not that Mukoddan
lawyer has not said anything

429
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,112
Then did you not understand
what l was telling all this time?

430
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:29,484
Then will tell clearly, Princess Mohini
is evicted from royal family

431
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,013
Lord's immoral relationship
with that flirt Umayamma

432
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,819
Financial burden

433
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:42,021
Court proceedings regarding
titles of lands given on lease

434
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,830
As soon as possible all these are
informed to daughter Haimavathy

435
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,673
Whatever Mukkodan chews in the
mouth, that is the brain of others -

436
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:57,679
- no doubt why compatriots say like
this - Shivathanu, don't flatter me a lot

437
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,781
What did you bring from royal family?

438
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,450
Whatever l deduct overthere
l'll not deduct anything in here

439
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,621
Even the marriage of Mohini is just
a function, just adorning wedding chain

440
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,986
lnside the royal family they shouldn't
give birth to illicit pregnancy

441
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,494
Let them get lost
somewhere, corpses!

442
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,965
Then shall l?

443
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,001
Just pay a visit forthe wedding

444
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,835
Then advocate should
come there saying -

445
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,964
- there are certain things to
discuss with Haimavathy

446
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,771
Haimavathy? Shivathanu, at last
will our plans get busted?

447
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,778
Person who came to
train the elephant -

448
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,540
- with this Haimavathy go with him?

449
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,742
That girl?
Where to?

450
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:57,064
Are you leaving?
Not saying good bye

451
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,574
As per the omens in horoscope,
l can say only like that

452
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,908
Nedumpattu royal family isn't that
far from here to go and come

453
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,909
Shall l take leave?

454
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,958
l won't forget till death

455
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:29,733
Couldn't subdue desires and also
couldn't control body and mind

456
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:35,270
While at Unniraja's bedroom, the
truth is l'm virgin, that is left behind

457
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,072
How can l forget Harikrishnan,
who returned it to me?

458
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,695
What is this Chitta?

459
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,771
You are a daughter to me, what
yourfather couldn't, you could

460
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:16,084
l've cursed that serpent deities
at the serpent temple, to the core

461
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,589
You should pray for me
so that they pardon me

462
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,016
Nothing bad will happen

463
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:26,754
Goddess at Manavathoor and
serpents will bring only good to you

464
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,732
Then has told advocate
Mukkodan to come

465
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:37,172
Over here father has partitioned and
kept ready all the land and wealth

466
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,644
Only Thanumama, knows
everything l'll register everything -

467
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,804
- on Mohini Chitta's name

468
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:46,946
Thanumama

469
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,321
That person for me..He is a cheat

470
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:58,993
Beyond Shivathanu's words l do not
know anything on outside world

471
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,963
l can only take that route,
that is the way l have

472
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:08,235
Be careful, everything
What is there to be careful?

473
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,102
At dusk when the main
entrance is closed

474
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,701
l train myself to get adopted
to feeling it is safe out here

475
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,078
Chitta, where ever
you are, live happily

476
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,342
That is only what l wished

477
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:38,225
Team  DrC    Release

478
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,636
Just tell me how much you
plan to give to Princess Mohini?

479
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:44,139
But when the entire
property is dissected

480
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:49,210
By including everything, what all
antiques which are in underground cellar

481
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,212
There should be two
shares, isn't it Shivathanu?

482
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,916
That is... - That is not, saying
later say it now itself

483
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:02,988
l know Shivathanu will be
slightly reluctant to say but..

484
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:08,660
l cannot desist from saying, not only
obsessed with Kathakali and elephants

485
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:13,392
Father Neelakandaraja,
was slightly obsessed with sex

486
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:20,072
As Neelakandaraja was crushed by
the elephant, he had an illicit relationship

487
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,946
ln that relationship, there is a child
born, a boy that is mentally retarded

488
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:33,255
ls it true? Thanumama,
what l hear is it true?

489
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,087
ls it true that l hear, l'm asking?

490
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,421
lt's true

491
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,096
She is a Princess hailing from
Chellavoor royal family by lineage

492
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,764
When Neelakandaraja met her,
there was only this title of 'Princess'

493
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,935
Sings very well, paints and
also dances and by the way...

494
00:56:54,010 --> 00:57:00,142
- and in many bodies engulfed by old
age, she lighted the ember of lust

495
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,714
One who is cent percent committed
to job, there is nothing to remove -

496
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:09,190
- not even nails, a well
matured very good creation

497
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,089
Not only that
Enough

498
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,991
Princess Haimavathy, there is no
point in getting angry on me

499
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:18,293
How many times have l told to Lord?
To get rid of that Umayamma -

500
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,800
- by giving something

501
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,233
He didn't lent ears to that

502
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:29,437
Princess, will anyone hear when saying
to cut off mango tree, ripe with fruits?

503
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,443
Otherthan this, how many more are
there my father's immoral relations?

504
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:40,220
By flattering my father what all things
you gained from my poor father?

505
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,325
What do you mean,
that l did? Hey advocate

506
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,953
Princess, there is no point in
getting angry on Shivathanu

507
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:53,263
A manager means one who begs to
gain favours, machine to say 'yes' that's it

508
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:59,071
Afterthe death, the list of medicines
that is received from father's room

509
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,203
Outwardly smiling a person
who loves people and died

510
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:08,977
My father, the mental struggles
that father had gone through

511
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,479
Sleeping pills which takes
away the consciousness

512
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,089
How many times? How many times?

513
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,386
You both joined together
and gave shock to my father?

514
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,325
Acting should be done
before the stage

515
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:26,229
Life is not tales and characters

516
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,837
High above there is god

517
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:34,575
So called this body, when there is
life on this body, worms will creep down

518
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:40,241
To remove that neither own hands
nor tongue to cry loud, will rise

519
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,075
Don't forget that

520
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,218
What a brave dialogue?

521
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,392
lt was Princess's father who
enjoyed and indulged in it, is it?

522
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,295
By the way Neelakandaraja really
loved Princess Umayamma,whatever said

523
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,457
ls it not Shivathanu
manager, isn't it?

524
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,296
Yes

525
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,897
Again where else are there
lives of my nonliving father!

526
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:10,273
lf you prepare a list within
one day l'll read and finish it

527
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:17,947
Advocate, land titles of royal
family, list of property details -

528
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,281
- prepared by father

529
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,880
And other matters which
l'm not aware, if so that one

530
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,926
Try to do it honestly

531
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:35,997
l can only close my eyes and pray
before the Goddess of Manavathoor

532
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:46,444
We have not started the game,
before that she is teaching the game

533
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:52,382
We won't give the ball in hand, we
will strike and keep ball moving

534
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:57,488
She will have a circle of earth
and after that she'll fall panting

535
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,860
Not panting and falling, should
'fall flat on ground'

536
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:17,141
Team  DrC    Release

537
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:21,083
No use on telling many times, that
Naniamma, will always add less salt

538
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,652
Won't increase the spices at all

539
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,012
Then how can the
cooking be okay?

540
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,650
Mohini, since you came here
it has been 6 days

541
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,451
Are you satisfied with the food?

542
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,995
Not at all satisfied with
anything, anything!

543
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,230
Yea, that is what l said

544
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:45,967
lf you want to feel satisfied, you
have to put your mind into it, isn't it?

545
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:05,725
Good smell ofjasmine
flower and good distilled oil

546
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:10,028
When both are received
together can sleep very well

547
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:14,329
With the same satisfaction received
while having a feast with 101 dishes

548
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:19,472
Then shall we not sleep?
Turn off the light

549
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:41,026
My goddess, a shadow to lean on,
someone to open up the mind

550
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,331
Someone to burst into tears

551
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,465
To load off the burden of mind

552
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:51,435
Where is that person who
took my heart, goddess?

553
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,095
Just now only l prayed to Goddess

554
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,990
ls Mohini Chitta fine who
is married off to Nedumpattu?

555
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:28,501
Unniraja, is educated
he has got only education

556
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:31,169
After the wedlock, he is a husband

557
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,674
lf there is luck without knowing the
male, can become a mother also

558
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,778
Then grandma, and afterthat

559
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:41,284
From the portico to the
shed adjacent to kitchen

560
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:45,286
Lying there after becoming
weak and wrinkled, one sleep

561
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,687
Finished, the life of a female

562
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,067
Not saying the life of male is superior

563
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,304
By thinking of a female who flees
after someone, by throwing the wedlock

564
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,202
Those who consumes
alcohol and dies

565
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:05,347
lf not along with children by tearing
off the pages in the book of death -

566
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,278
- those people who wander
aimlessly as a spirit

567
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,486
Some sights may make us blind

568
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:15,181
ln a way blind people are lucky

569
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,181
They don't have to see anything

570
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,317
There is not even a
second which l don't think

571
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,320
Where were you?

572
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,365
Princess, you may go

573
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:35,504
l'll be here only, be bold

574
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,831
Ustad!

575
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:15,206
Abdulla! Great procession of
great mishaps are about to start

576
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,448
ln the festival ground which is filled
with fireworks and glitters in sky

577
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,884
To burn the Princess Haimavathy,
whose hands and legs are tied

578
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,222
With a fire torch, Shivathand

579
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:33,160
While seeing the corpses getting
scattered, by poking his fingers -

580
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,702
- in the ears, he feels the joy

581
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,238
Advocate Mukkodan

582
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,902
Well-polished, cleaned by
setting blaze to fire powder

583
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:46,211
This Malapuram knife is there, Ustad,
no one will know will duck -

584
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,783
- into the ass and pull upwards

585
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,680
No need, shouldn't kill anyone

586
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,616
We don't have the right for it

587
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:13,737
Team  DrC    Release

588
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:18,413
Princess.. - What is it Harikrishna?

589
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,576
Father told to send
off Rudra Simhan

590
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,610
This is Manavathoor royal family

591
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,415
Who should come, who shouldn't
come here, that is decided by Haimavathy

592
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,991
lt is a danger to gain father's wrath

593
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:37,527
ln own father's bondage, me who
is ready to smoulder oneself

594
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,931
Why Harikrishna, these
kind of words?

595
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,395
Royal mansion, revenues,
underground cellar -

596
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,639
- Thanumama can lock it

597
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,471
But to lock the doors of
my heart, the key for which

598
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,871
Shivathanu won't have it

599
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,216
Father will cheat

600
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,351
Good if son doesn't support
that cheating

601
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,252
With a good consciousness
l never do that, Princess

602
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,829
At present l can only say like that

603
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,036
You dog

604
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:34,982
l'll chop off both and immerse in that
elephant dung, no one will know it

605
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:38,685
l will know it, only l'll know it

606
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,961
By the way l was thinking

607
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,702
Coming here and after chaining
Abhimanyu, many things

608
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,898
Being born means should be
born to a good father like this

609
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,775
A father who has got
a spine made of iron

610
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:00,073
Shivathanu, do you know,
who your own father is?

611
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:05,710
When l look into someone's
face, l don't see their body

612
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,081
l see their mind

613
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,057
On that it appears even
his mother's womb -

614
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,727
- where he has excreted
for many months

615
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,397
Can hear what the
god says, for Rudran

616
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,294
Similarly how the devil
thinks and aims

617
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:24,873
Both l will absorb into the
heart as a sacred maxim

618
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,870
Won't leave anything

619
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,106
Shall l go?

620
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:33,972
Stop there

621
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:41,818
Umayamma, in her womb not only
the blue royal blood of Neelakandaraja

622
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,320
ln the heart there is also tears fallen

623
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,998
On a blank document by
pressing the Lord's thumb

624
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:53,761
Even now in her underground
cellar, what is guarded in her lron casket

625
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:57,829
On the same title document
l'll make to write with blood

626
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:04,469
That tale of treachery and also the
tales of those who supported it

627
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,639
What rubbish is he talking?

628
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:11,048
l don't know anything or else
you ask to the Goddess in here

629
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:15,590
Hey You Shiva Thanu, to bath in
the pond where Rudran baths -

630
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,656
- you still have to be born again!

631
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,660
To kill you, as you are
born not knowing to whom

632
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:25,699
By giving native medicines your
mother's womb was squeezed a lot

633
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,700
By native maidens

634
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:33,467
You are born only to ruin the native
but still you remained sticking there

635
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,373
l'll show you if you
tell about my mother

636
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,178
Kunnathoor Veera Bhairavan

637
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:47,548
With the power of his 'black magic
and enticement metal foil'

638
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,688
You don't play with me

639
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:55,827
When you see, over here
there is Princess Haimavathy

640
01:08:56,499 --> 01:09:00,697
She is alone but l'm there behind her

641
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,701
Go, come with sword and shield

642
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,134
lf you want you can come to
the front and wage a war

643
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,644
Or you can stab from back

644
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,575
l'm ready for anything

645
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:28,929
Team  DrC    Release

646
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,496
Father, you should
understand what l say

647
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,164
That Rudra Simhan
is not an ordinary person

648
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:45,742
Not only that Princess
Haimavathy loves him also

649
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,549
So what fellow?

650
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:52,612
The things which are to be
owned, to own that should play

651
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,219
Shouldn't fail must act as failed

652
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,758
Mustn't be a fool, but must
enact the character of a fool

653
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:04,531
Even lf l die, you should
remain alive

654
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:10,133
But l don't want to see that behind
the curtain of heaven or hell

655
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,975
With this very eyes will see all that,
and afterthat only this Shivathanu will go

656
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,737
He is not a toy
snake, he is king cobra

657
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:23,078
His poison is more dreadful than
the poison of 'snake Kaliyan'

658
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,088
This is not told by me, it
was told by Veera Bhairavan

659
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,916
l want my father

660
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:35,723
As long as l'm alive nothing
should happen to my father

661
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:41,865
l'm scared - You have the
heart of your mother

662
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,106
What l want to know is,
the birth place of this Rudran

663
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:54,240
On which womb he is born, his
relationship with this royal family

664
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:58,114
On knowing the rut of Abhimanyu,
how did he reach here?

665
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:07,625
Son, Haimavathy is
for you, only for you

666
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:13,961
We do not know the
lapse of time, not only us

667
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,195
Even the time itself

668
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,902
Tomorrow is 'Amavasi' ( full moon
day) you must come with me

669
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,009
To Kunathoor Bhairavan
My goodness!

670
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:27,306
Me -Yes
For father's victory, don't fail me

671
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:33,347
Failure! To chain Rudra
Simhan and Haimavathy -

672

01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,413
A super natural power

685

By taking control over
mean stars in the sky

My god, is he a human being?

689
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:00,271
What can he do to this
royal family, Ustad?

690
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:05,743
He is not alone, along with him there
is Mukkodan advocate and Shivathanu

691
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,379
Now again when
Harikrishnan also joins

Circle will be complete

693
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,980
Along with that one female

694
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,850
Female?
Which female?

695
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,853
Umayamma from
Chelavoor royal family

696
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,097
Time has come forthe journey

By the way, Harikrishnan, today he
will come under the spell of Bhairavan

Harikrishanan, will come
asking for elephant's tail hair

703
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:54,990
Elephant's tail hair?

705
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:01,894
Not saying good bye
Ustad, where are you going?

Ustad, had gone just now telling that

711
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,539
lf you take that and do something,
do you think all will sink under the earth?

712
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,220
By putting the elephant tail hair,
hair, beetle leave and areca-nut -

713
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,555
- place it in the front and
you may do the obeisance

714
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:26,305
By knotting the metal foil on the
elephant's tail, will the boy cheat us?

715
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,641
No, no

716
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:33,121
lf you cheat one who gives
rice, salt and breath, you'll die

717
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,921
She is there no?
My deity with blood

718
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,118
lf you cheat, she will tear
the heart and drink blood

719
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:46,891
Manavathoor royal
family and girl in there

01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,063
That belongs to boy

721
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,904
Not only for the boy,
she belongs to his father also

722
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,973
By all means

723
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,111

724
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:03,916
l won't cheat on him, won't show
treachery, true upon this blood deity

725
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,250

Asking once again

727
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,325

Manavathoor and the bed

Will you cheat us?
No

729
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:23,902
No

730
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,404
At night for the blood
deity, blood sacrifice

That too just born on this earth

733
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,040
Three days old

01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,554
Bring the hair of Haimavathy

01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:45,488
Using a tender palm's stick,
twist the hair and take

737
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:53,057
Will do it -Afterfour days once
Rudran's wax statue is fully melted

There will one man in
Haimavathy's heart

01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,298
You, only you
Did you understand?

740
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,520
First he should know
what a female is

741
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:23,087
By 5 sense organs the 'Kundalini
energy' that is in the body

742
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,701
There is only one female
on this earth who can awaken it

743
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,403
She is the one

744
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:30,666
Umayamma!

745
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:46,083
She is a serpent beauty

746
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:50,656
A serpent beauty who enticed
Neelakanda raja with a glance

747

She has received in writing,
entire wealth of Manavathoor

748
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,027
She is a human demon

749
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,027
Princess Umayamma

750
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,667

dangerfor my son's life

Afterthe bath, while sitting

Assistant has told will
lose the consciousness - Yes

757
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,190
Consciousness will be
lost right from here

758
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,287
Consciousness will be regained -

759
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,796
- at the Umayamma's bed room
of Chelavoor palace

760
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:52,544
Team  DrC    Release

761
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,616
She will make him understand
what a female is

762
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:01,225
Umayamma, has learned
the mantra of sex by heart

763
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:04,093
She'll apply that on him

764
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,364
That will awaken his
sexual energy in him

765
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:28,345
l'm the Umayamma, the
Umayamma which Bhairavan has told

766
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,889
l being here -For questions and
answers it has no relevance

767
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:44,803
We are only puppets, when pulling
the strings we dance and sings

768
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,242
Can you help me to
escape from here?

769
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,843
You are safe here

770
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:54,106
All joined together Kunathoor
Bhairavan, Shivathanu and Mukkodan

771
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,509
They have send you here to me -

772
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,850
- to test the power of metal
foil knotted on the waist

773
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,719
To make you understand
what female is

774
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:11,129
Don't spoil the body

775
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,268
Especially the body of females

776
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:20,541
Better than being a shadow in the
dark and haggling, felt this better

777
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,435
My body never used
to demand anything -

778
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,375
- being surrendered
to other's demands

779
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,451
Knowingly

780
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,948
Knowingly, l'm also doing a mistake

781
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:35,912
For my father

782
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,348
Mistake!

783
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,762
l'm trying to find the
correctness on that

784
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,298
Several times...

785
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,668
You like Haimavathy, don't you?

786
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:04,509
Yes...But! - Harikrishan will
give life for Haimavathy

787
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,955
Haimavathy will sacrifice life
for Rudra Simhan

788
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,219
ln between that for the
most wanted and needy people...

789
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,390
One who is present to
sell out the fake love

790
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:20,465
Princess Umayamma at
Chelavoor royal family

791
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:25,736
Long back, l only had a wish
like that to Princess Haimavathy -

792
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,829
other than that..

793
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,471
l haven't spoken to anyone

794
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:32,507
Don't tell anything to anyone

795
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:37,347
What is there in my mind, to sniff
and find it, there is Kunthoor Bhairavan

796
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,786
His blood sucking deity is there

797
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:46,482
Applied make up on the
face, anyhow should act

798
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:48,793
lf not

799
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:55,501
They will cut into pieces and
immerse in the swamp, human animals

800
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,842
He has come and collected the
elephant's tail hair and gone

801
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,879
That Shivathanu, is the one
who Scapegoats that boy

802
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,815
Ustad, has gone seeing
something in mind -

803
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,248
- anyway Princess never show out
as if you have known

804
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:17,722
Look, l doubt for the morning
'iddili'(rice cakes) mixing wasn't correct

805
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:22,026
The rice and black gram wasn't in
right proportion, tell to attend to that

806
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,623
When the stomach gets
upset, there won't be sleep

807
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,546
Princess, did the actions
intended go astray?

808
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:45,718
Between this Unniraja and Mohini
Chitta, there is some mis-match

809
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:47,850
No, didn't say anything to me -

810
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:51,888
- Mohini Chitta told Unniraja
is an innocent person

811
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:55,620
My studying more there
were some mental issues

812
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,865
The physicians at
Alanchery had treated once

813
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,666
On taking the medicine the
digestion increased, that's all

814
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,000
Mohini Chitta, likes

815
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,539
When will your Ustad come again?
- Princess you don't get upset

816
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:15,313
He has removed his own soul at
the portico of this palace and left

817
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,542
My Ustad

818
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,085
l can hear the throb of that soul

819
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:23,813
Princess, no devil can cross that
portico and reach over to here

820
01:24:41,376 --> 01:25:14,838
Team  DrC    Release

821
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:50,164
To overcome the power of black
magic, Harikrishna you couldn't do it

822
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:54,836
You came in search
of me, you desired me

823
01:26:57,312 --> 01:27:03,478
Must surrender to all the desires of
the male, in the previous birth itself -

824
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,677
- l'm the one who has
received a curse like that

825
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:12,216
l don't know, l can't control anything

826
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:18,194
Some unknown power, at present
in my mind, there is only Umayamma

827
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:20,432
Only there is Umayamma

828
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,106
Certain nights make us
not human beings

829
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,904
On this night you take me

830
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,240
For your fatherto win

831
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:39,847
The boy is lured!

832
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,122
Blood deity made him do it

833
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:45,284
Next is Haimavathy

834
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:47,786
Then the royal palace

835
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,858
After that the soil out there

836
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,934
Do you know why l did it?

837
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:03,275
For me

838
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,005
For my Harikrishnan
Shucks!

839
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,607
Manavathoor royal palace

840
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,214
Underground cellar
inside the palace

841
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:18,325
The breaths that is
remaining in the cellar at night

842
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,324
The blood that is flown
and then tears

843
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:26,865
Cries, this soul of
Veera Bhairavan belongs there

844
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:33,239
When an ant bites,
Bhairavan won't cry out loud

845
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:38,038
Time has made me to chop necks,
made me to drink the blood of animals

846
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:43,014
While l sleep holding the reins of
evil forces, l used to hearthat cries

847
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:45,108
ln the cellar inside the palace

848
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:49,280
A body whose head is chopped,
without closing those eyes watch

849
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:56,030
Even after years that
body isn't decayed

850
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:57,854
l want that

851
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,326
To hug it close to heart and cry

852
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,267
l can't understand what you say

853
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:13,771
But for anything l'll be
with you for anything

854
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,079
But he, this Rudran

855
01:29:38,806 --> 01:30:08,126
Team  DrC    Release

856
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:07,493
Vallan, you go and
tell to your master Bhairavan

857
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:11,155
To quench the thirst of
his blood sucking deity

858
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,424
Won't get my blood

859
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:16,326
No one has got any
rights to take anyone's life

860
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,473
Go
Go l say!

861
01:31:42,964 --> 01:32:12,625
Team  DrC    Release

862
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:48,220
Princess!

863
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,534
Abdulla!

864
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,032
Ustad, some danger has
happened to your Ustad

865
01:32:57,138 --> 01:32:59,868
No, princess, got scared
on seeing some dreams

866
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:01,969
Nothing will happen to Ustad

867
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:05,437
To take his life, that
Goddess should intend

868
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:09,383
Otherwise my Ustad should
sacrifice his life before the Kali

869
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:12,281
Abdulla, before father's death

870
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:15,046
l've seen a dream like this

871
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,148
Abhimanyu, killing father

872
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:22,194
Princess, you may go
and sleep peacefully

873
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,463
My Ustad will be sleeping peacefully
in some temple doorsteps -

874
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,931
- or in some church's portico

875
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:30,136
Kindly you may go, princess

876
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:45,277
Who is that overthere?

877
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:49,647
Hey you, can't you hear on asking?

878
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,120
lt was you, no?

879
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,968
Where were you?
Your face looks fatigue

880
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:07,336
Did that father devil put
you in some trap?

881
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,670
Hey fellow, asking you only

882
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,703
Has left with an elephant's tail-hair

883
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,913
Now standing like a
thief under cover

884
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,146
Good l was able to
recognise you soon

885
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,218
Otherwise l would have
stabbed on your heart

886
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:21,519
Go

887
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,072
Was bit late

888
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:47,138
There was an important trial
of a murder case at the court

889
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,583
At present really busy

890
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:54,320
When father was there often
comes to him, for a meeting

891
01:34:55,589 --> 01:35:00,219
Before father's death, how did he
prepare the will, l want to know that

892
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,662
lf l say it in one word,
don't get fainted

893
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,224
No l won't faint, advocate
Mukkodan you may say it

894
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:11,226
Why should l beg and
receive the curse of this princess?

895
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,564
Hey Shivathanu, you may say it
My goodness!

896
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:15,370
l..How can l?

897
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:17,574
l'll trust whoever says it

898
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:20,680
l must trust that is my situation

899
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:26,680
What a daughter shouldn't hear
about father, as Shivathanu has said it

900
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:29,556
Do you have anything
to say more than that?

901
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:35,052
Your father, demised
Neelakandaraja, as per the will

902
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:37,097
That was prepared for the last time

903
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,563
You are not given a
single pinch of sand

904
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,306
Everything was written
off to Umayamma -

905
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:46,796
- and son at Chelavoor palace

906
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:51,570
ln short myself and Molutty
and other serfs out here -

907
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:53,670
- is in the mercy of Umayamma

908
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,409
For doing this much by my father -

909
01:35:57,518 --> 01:36:00,385
- to both, how much did that
princess Umayamma pay you?

910
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:03,784
My god
Not saying the lies

911
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:08,092
1 .5 crores to me, l'll
say only what l've received

912
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:09,688
l...!

913
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:15,467
Will add one more thing including
interest 11 crore and 96 lakh rupees

914
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:19,061
Within 30 days it should be
retuned to that Umayamma princess

915
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:24,337
lf not including Manavathoor
Goddess, will be confiscated

916
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:29,272
But before that there is a will that is
prepared as perfather's likes, is it not?

917
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,582
Which has got the
share for Mohini Chitta

918
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:35,078
That became invalid, no?

919
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:39,552
lf Abhimanyu dies there are
documents on what to with its nails

920
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:43,788
l'm busy

921
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:49,293
lf it is to be shown to anyone, show
it and read this and decide things

922
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:54,302
lf you want to meet me, inform me,
if there is time l'll come

923
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:59,278
Also if l feel like, shall
l go Thanu..Mama?

924
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:08,415
While telling the facts,
will stop people's heart beat -

925
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,681
- that is only after lawyer Mukkodan

926
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:14,192
That is the reason why compatriots
call him 'death' Mukkodan

927
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:19,595
You are really deadly - Yes indeed,
when flatter a lot, l'm scared

928
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:23,169
What comes next is thunder bolt

929
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:26,265
Lawyer, don't go

930
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,569
This is that fellow that
assistant of elephant tamer

931
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,543
He is real gun powder, say
something and avoid him and go

932
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,852
Coming to palace and
smouldering the heart of princess

933
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:42,551
How to leave like that?
What if l leave?

934
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:47,189
Are you from Ponnani?
lf so..?

935
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:51,358
Look, there is a person waiting to
see you just come and see and go

936
01:37:51,632 --> 01:38:07,469
Team  DrC    Release

937
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:09,940
l recognised the person

938
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:12,918
Shivathanu, is he your scary dream?

939
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,747
Protector of princess,
do you know him?

940
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:20,222
l know him, he is like ''lguana''

941
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,660
On the infamous
'Thumbaman' murder case

942
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:27,460
'Thumbaman' C.l Shamzu,
who killed 6 people by rolling

943
01:38:27,635 --> 01:38:30,934
ln the board day light in the
mist of people with the thumb

944
01:38:31,005 --> 01:38:32,939
Was made motionless, the 'lguana'

945
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:43,540
You can fasten the elephant that is
on rut and females that is driven by lust

946
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:47,812
But people like me who are
born in fire, to fasten me which -

947
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:51,253
- are human animals like me
you are not enough 'lguana'

948
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:55,227
lf you don't listen to what we
say your head will be shaven -

949
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:58,298
- with drums you will be
processioned naked

950
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:01,528
Both you and your
princess Haimavathy

951
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:06,294
At that time to walk along with you
there won't be any elephant or horse

952
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,773
Then look your assistant
who is standing here

953
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:12,436
We'll kill all and immerse in the sea

954
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:16,509
Both of go and escape,
l say you get lost fellows

955
01:39:16,817 --> 01:39:19,809
Hey fellow call this jerk and go

956

Son!

957
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:40,040
Are you scaring Ustad? lf Ustad,
whacks you, both your urine and -

958
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,473
- excreta, will have to be
cleaned by Shivathanu

959
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,305
Who doesn't know who his father is

960
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:53,514
What a stinking smell? Did you
bath in the water from fish market?

961
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,282
Get up and go, l say get up and go!

962
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,352
Get up and come

963
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:00,523
Come, come

964
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:03,826
Hey you, you have hurt
a poisonous snake

965
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:06,866
Hey Shivathanu, call that snake
and go, before killing it by beating

966
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:25,177
Team  DrC    Release

967
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:26,749
Who is it?

968
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:33,059
Rudran

969
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:35,890
Rudra Simhan

970
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,599
Has heard lot about you,
didn't know when you came

971
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:44,727
l was in prayers, l'm on a penance

972
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,863
l have not come to

973
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:50,601
White cloth, white body

974
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:52,937
White ashes

975
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:57,110
How come that heart is not white?

976
01:40:57,651 --> 01:40:59,585
What is that Rudra Simhan wants?

977
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:02,816
Umayamma, do you sell this palace?

978
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:06,422
No - May be out of
desperate situation of yours

979
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,858
You are selling yourself, no?

980
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:12,724
On the Eastern shore
of Chelavoor palace

981
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,864
Where the swans swim, in
the pond where Lilies flower

982
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:18,904
At dawn after oiling baths

983
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:21,907
You, who consumes
other's sweat and blood

984
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:25,410
lf you bath in any
sacred Ganges, that won't end

985
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:30,108
The sins, forthat the Universe
should create, a new sacred water

986
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:35,986
Have you come to scatter my soul?

987
01:41:37,157 --> 01:41:38,988
To get some peace of mind

988
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:41,525
l've just prayed to god and come

989
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,629
What is this child's name?

990
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:48,532
Manikandaraja

991
01:41:49,837 --> 01:41:54,103
ls there any drop of blood of
Neelakandaraja of Manavathoor palace?

992
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,066
ln the creation of this child?

993
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:58,804
This is his son
l'll say no

994
01:41:59,146 --> 01:42:03,014
On your 14th age, the Thahsildar,
who came to confiscate this palace

995
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,517
Who is as old as your grandfather

996
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:08,947
Also in front of Nagamanikkam
who hails from Parasala

997
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:10,182
Was set loose

998
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:16,686
Finally when you were hugged that
old man withered and died inside cellar

999
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,731
Yes, l didn't know anything

1000
01:42:19,032 --> 01:42:22,490
Later came to know he was
having sickness on heart

1001
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:25,934
l'm trying to forget many things

1002
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:30,473
The black magic deity of Kunathoor
Bhairavan, blood sucking deity

1003
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:34,547
On the deity's waist cat's eye
Gemstone which you knotted

1004
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:37,914
Tomorrow the black
magic will repel back

1005
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:42,578
Black magician and deity will
become ashes in the flames of time

1006
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:47,021
Game in the name
of will of Manavathoor

1007
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:49,523
Forthe support evil deities

1008
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:53,994
Will say in single word, return
that will to Haimavathy

1009
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,969
And also document which
are gained by pressing -

1010
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:59,698
- thumb of Neelakandaraja

1011
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:03,471
To you his soul will never pardon

1012
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:06,842
Everything was given by
Neelakandaraja upon his wish

1013
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:09,182
He was very fond of me

1014
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:15,214

Wrath of snakes, the death will

Either that is to your son or any
princess to whom he gave his body

This Bhairavan knows everything

There are certain truths which
the time has buried with clay

The soil which is dead, its dead
truths, they are the mask of time

palace tears should fall

There may be several
arrows, but the aim is one

old story which grandmother has told

1126

There came an elephant
tamer from Kunathoor

1127
01:55:19,345 --> 01:55:21,870
Did she say he went back alive?

1128

Don't know all that

1129
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,948
During that time it was not this
Abhimanyu, it was Manavathoor Shivan

1130
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:34,192
A bold tusker, more
grandeur than him

1131

Tusks, nail, board eyes

1132
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:42,458
One who came to catch his tusks
was a very good black smith

On the blazing fire, one who makes
dual headed knife and spears

l was born to him

1138
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:16,828

Time taught me black magic,
an excellent black magic

1140

Because my deities shield couldn't
bearthe heat of your lust

1146
01:57:12,759 --> 01:57:15,353
Why did you come to this
Manavathoor palace?

Before the evil forces of Bhairavan
don't know will be scattered

Bhairavan is a foe

1158
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:53,685
He shouldn't be under estimated

1159
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:58,960
Courage of being born in
a bold blood, the vigour of that

1160
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:03,865
He has got the strength of being
lying inside a strong womb

1161

Ustad, mind says something
unwanted is going to take place here

omen sign has appeared

Planetary positions are un favourable

Planetary positions changes

Serpents have got power

Planets had ordained widowhood
to Mohini Chitta

1167

Might have ended
the strife with serpents

1168
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,479
Unniraja, should marry Mohini

1169
02:00:25,084 --> 02:00:28,679
After that he should die at
the snake temple bitten by snake

1170
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:32,815
Can't stop the fate

1171
02:00:34,327 --> 02:00:37,888
lf this dead body lies here like this
Shouldn't be allowed

1172

Unniraja's - No need of yet again
misfortune witness account to Unniraja

You may hand overthat to Mohini

Unniraja, is dead

Body is near the pond

1183
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:01,900
Was a snake bite

Mustn't cancel Kali pooja - But still?
As soon as possible

1189
02:03:22,194 --> 02:03:23,786
Remove the corpse from there

1190
02:03:29,268 --> 02:03:35,832
Princess, Goddess at Manavathoor
on full moon day she'll ask blood

1191
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:40,440
Animal sacrifice shouldn't
be a human sacrifice

1192
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:44,111
Pray strongly

1193
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:00,460
Can you wait?

1194
02:04:01,967 --> 02:04:07,462

rut, also fastened Haimavathy, no?

1195
02:04:36,435 --> 02:04:41,839
Mohini, covering the
unfaithfulness with tears -

1196
02:04:42,374 --> 02:04:44,808
- it shouldn't be an
embellishment for ladies

1197
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:52,247
For the females who are
mad on blood and flesh

1198
02:04:52,585 --> 02:04:55,520

02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:16,299
No need, no one should

No one should kill him

1211

You won't miss the aim,
with one shot he'll sit and fall

Then for 3 hours there

Will it hurt him?

You are the one who is shooting
