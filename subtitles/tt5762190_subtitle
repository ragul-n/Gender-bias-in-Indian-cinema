1
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:14,952
Wow! Finally the junior
boss has responded!

2
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,001
Wow! Finally the junior
boss has responded!

3
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,512
He has cut the phone.

4
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,754
It is not cutting the phone sir.
It is cutting the call.

5
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,197
Of course. It's because ofthis grammar
& glamour that you are appointed

6
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:25,760
Thankyou sir.

7
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,200
What?

8
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:30,560
What happened sir?

9
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:35,803
Junior boss is in Europe from a month
and has already spent 5 million.
for 25 million more.

10
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:37,712
Tell it to senior boss sir.

11
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:40,842
What's the use? If he asksfor 2.5
million, this man will send 5 million.

12
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:41,880
Do you know why?
Why sir?

13
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,995
Because if son is golden
star.Father is crazy star.

14
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:45,797
Wow! Super combination.

15
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,235
Should I get their
autograph for you?
take a selfie.

16
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:52,520
If you don't mind,

17
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,712
can I know why golden
star spends so much?

18
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:57,034
For his excitement.Whose
ointment?

19
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:00,120
Not ointment dear.
For excitement.

20
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:26,514
Mam, there is something for you.

21
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,880
What's this?

22
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:46,914
<i>Hi.</i>

23
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,161
I saw the most
exiting girl today!

24
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,560
That moment!

25
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,159
You were not treading
over the floor,

26
00:03:58,873 --> 00:03:59,954
but over my heart.

27
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:07,639
You look ravishingly beautiful
in 18 different angles.

28
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,598
When you sip coffee,

29
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:21,515
it seems like you are
making love to that mug.

30
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,434
Lucky mug!

31
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:37,436
And that graceful walk when
you moved towards the pool

32
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:40,923
would have knocked 100
miss world crowns.

33
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:05,682
Ah!That hot look you gave to the
swimming pool after finishing the coffee!

34
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,995
The water must have reached
its boiling point.

35
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,724
You impressed me in
just 18 minutes.

36
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:33,003
By the way, I wanted
to personally ask,

37
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:35,315
were you swimming in the pool or

38
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,316
were you floating in heaven.

39
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,598
We will meet at4 p.m
in The Park hotel.

40
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:50,077
I'm damn sure that our meeting
will be filled with excitement

41
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:53,200
Preetham

42
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:07,596
This way madam.

43
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,761
I can breathe without oxygen.

44
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,559
But I can't live
without excitement

45
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:34,121
Right now, for this Preetham,

46
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,434
you are the most exiting factor.

47
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,397
Wow! This is so amazing!

48
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,715
Shreya, I love you.
Will you...

49
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:48,955
Wow PreethamlYou
are so amazing!

50
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:55,717
Thankyou. I'm so thrilled!

51
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,360
Hey hi.

52
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,120
Ni

53
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:31,192
Sorry. I was a bit late.

54
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:32,194
Ifsfine.

55
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,437
Were you getting bored? Hmm

56
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,042
Now I have come right.
Your boredom will vanish.

57
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,443
But, I am bored of you.

58
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,874
What?

59
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,159
Are you serious?

60
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:50,163
Shreya,the way we met,
the way we proposed,

61
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,235
the way we strolled around,

62
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,633
was all too exiting!

63
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:58,158
But, now I find all
this very boring.

64
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,834
But why]

65
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:03,641
I don't know.

66
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,363
Then what do you know?

67
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:09,995
Shreya, I know only one thing.

68
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:12,075
Once you start to feel boredom,

69
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:16,232
we should stop continuing
such relationship.

70
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,200
If you continue,

71
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:20,795
there will be unnecessary
anger, tussles...

72
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,879
Don't you feel so?

73
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,200
SQ?

74
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,834
So...

75
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,160
let's breakup.

76
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:36,795
How many girls have you
been with prior to me?

77
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,155
I won't lie. I don't remember.

78
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,202
So basically, you are not
interested in commitment.

79
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,472
You are trying to escape!

80
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:46,440
Just go to hell.

81
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:47,594
Sh reya,

82
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:49,392
Forget it Preetham.

83
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:52,232
Shreya, let me finish Forget it Preetham.
It's over!

84
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,155
Listen to me.

85
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,761
I wouldn't have been
explaining you all this.

86
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:58,679
Oh!Thanks a lot!

87
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,152
You know what? You
are a good guy.

88
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,359
But too confused.

89
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,315
No! I am not confused.You are.

90
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,356
Iam clear about what I want.

91
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,555
Oh! So you don't want me. Right?

92
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,004
Shreya please. Look

93
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,276
You are beautiful. A good girl.

94
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,003
Its all true, but. .

95
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,681
You are not the girl I expect.

96
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,316
Can I know what's your
expectation from a girl?

97
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,037
One who will never bore me.

98
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,440
A non-boring girl.

99
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:32,878
Sounds good. But
practically impossible.

100
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,197
No, no, no. It is possible.

101
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,075
And exiting also.

102
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,358
You and your excitement.

103
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,363
Anyways, all the best.

104
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,000
Thankyou.

105
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,480
Thankyou very much Shreya.

106
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,842
We will be friends forever.

107
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:13,952
Preetham!

108
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:14,992
Hi buddy.

109
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,032
Welcome to India sir.

110
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,000
Thankyou.Where is dad?

111
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:20,272
Our crazy star has gone to bring a
new car to maintain your excitement.

112
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,196
Wow! That's my dad! Yes sir.

113
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:53,120
Hey!

114
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:54,194
Dad!

115
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,152
I love you dad.You are the
best dad in the world.

116
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,315
This dialogue costs 1.6 cores

117
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,475
But uncle, doesn't this
car cost 1 .5 cores

118
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,595
Ofcourse, but he has paid 10 lakes
extra to purchase it today itself.

119
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:04,714
Let's go dad.

120
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:07,080
You come in your car.

121
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,160
What?

122
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:10,879
This is not for you.
It is for me.

123
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,002
Now this is a crazy twist.

124
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,472
You have always
defeated me in racing.

125
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:19,273
Sol have bought a new
car to win this time.

126
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,272
Come on let's race.

127
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:23,081
Come on.

128
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,235
Sir,there are many
pending works.

129
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:28,112
Shall I leave for office.

130
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:29,842
Your office is standing right here.
Just get in.

131
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:30,632
Fine sir.

132
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,398
God protect me from
this father son duo.

133
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,194
Please save me god!

134
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:21,079
Sir, do you really need
such craze at this age?

135
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:25,921
My craze is not in my body.
But in my mind.

136
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:27,232
Sir!

137
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,156
Dude,judging by
your dad's speed,

138
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:31,152
it looks like our
defeat is guaranteed.

139
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,152
Tell me who is he?

140
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,152
Your father.

141
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:34,152
He should always be victorious.

142
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,155
But I too don't like
failures...Hmm

143
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,242
Because I am his son.

144
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:52,155
Hey dad! It's not about the car.

145
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,357
It's the one who drives it
that makes the difference.

146
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,121
No matter how fast you are,I
will always be yourfather.

147
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,512
Don't forget it.

148
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:00,356
Wow! But I too am your son.

149
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:07,792
Hey! Open your eyes.

150
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:10,194
If I open my eyes gods
will dissapear sir.

151
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,361
We did it dude.

152
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,240
All the efforts became in vain.

153
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:43,232
Sir! You morbidly
lost a winning race.

154
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,232
Tell me who won the race?

155
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,232
Your son.

156
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,832
No one should snatch his
excitement away from him.

157
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:49,914
Not even me.

158
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:05,920
Iam nothing without my father.

159
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,112
Nothing exists
without my father.

160
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:09,717
I love my father too much

161
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,112
I shall never hurt him.

162
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:13,161
Iam nothing without my father.

163
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,275
Nothing exists
without my father.

164
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,036
I shall never hurt him.

165
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:21,117
My dad never rebukes
me no matter what.

166
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,398
He did teach me ABCD
when I was a child.

167
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,963
One should learn to
love by seeing my dad.

168
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:34,720
He is the best piece created
by the creator himself.

169
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,918
Dad you are my He-Man.

170
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,200
Dad, you are the Show-Man

171
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:43,122
You are my everything.

172
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:44,400
So let me tell. Listen.

173
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,117
My daddy is my hero.

174
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,399
My daddy is superstar.

175
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,957
Oh daddy. Daddy. Daddy

176
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:40,634
My son is a million dollar baby.
A one and only piece.

177
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:48,399
Like a fully loaded
golden gun in my pocket.

178
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,762
There is no happiness
without my son

179
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:53,795
He is my sight and vision.

180
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,280
He speaks a ton, for he is No 1.

181
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:58,192
My daddy is my god,

182
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,272
It's impossible to
match his speed.

183
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:02,275
Will lay down my life for him

184
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,998
and this song is for him.

185
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,397
Iam nothing without my son

186
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:08,752
Nothing exists without my son
and I won't hurt him

187
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,720
lam nothing without my son

188
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,556
Nothing exists without my son

189
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,601
So let me say this. Listen.

190
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,278
My sonny is my hero

191
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,994
My sonny is superstar

192
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,162
Oh Sonny. Sonny. Sonny

193
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,279
Afather means there
is no fear in life

194
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,597
We booze together. We
have fun together.

195
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,524
This understanding
can never be missed

196
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,603
Oh my daddy. Daddy. Daddy

197
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:07,041
No one will get a son like you

198
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,115
You are my baby. My sweet pea.

199
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,122
My cutie pie. My sugar candy.

200
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,432
My baby. My boss

201
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,639
My gold. My hold.

202
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:17,032
My child. My rascal.

203
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,319
My embrace. My kiss.

204
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,353
Myjoker. My ruler.

205
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,439
My daddy is my hero.

206
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,872
My daddy is superstar.

207
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:36,874
(Scream)

208
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:00,320
Dad

209
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,555
your tears will
make my mother sad.

210
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:07,519
On her birthday, you should
be the most happiest person.

211
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,912
Just as how mom
took care of you,

212
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:14,076
I too will take care of
you for this whole day.

213
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:19,317
I prepared thisjamoon with my own hands.
Open your mouth.

214
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,354
It's delicious.

215
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,514
Really dad!

216
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,601
Oh shit! Dad! It's too sweet.

217
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:33,837
Wouldn't a son's and
mother's love be so sweet?

218
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:37,321
Oh! I have left the dosa on the pan.
Will get it.

219
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:44,680
Dad!

220
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,760
Iam very sorry dad.

221
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:48,392
I had poured ghee like water.
Dosa has belittled into pieces.

222
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:49,392
It's alright child.

223
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,599
Good morning sir.

224
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:53,112
What's this? Am I witnessing
the 9th wonder of the world?

225
00:20:53,113 --> 00:20:55,719
Have a seat and have
Preetham'sjamoon.

226
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:58,520
I will explain it.
make a perfect dosa.

227
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:00,160
Thanks Dad.

228
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:03,712
Aha! It smells so yummy!

229
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:05,442
He has added garnish to it

230
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,039
Garnish forJamoon!

231
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:13,714
Howis it?

232
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:16,832
Dad.

233
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,119
Your favorite suit.

234
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,876
My mother's last gift to you.

235
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:32,560
Wow! Sir.

236
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:35,796
If you just shave a bit,then even now
girls will stand in queue to propose.

237
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:38,961
Dad, the way you keep those two
buttons on the shirt open.

238
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,001
That's extraordinary. exactly

239
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,195
Your mother had gifted me
this shirt 18 years back.

240
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,237
It became tight and I had to open
these two buttons to fit in.

241
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:50,443
And like her love this style
has stayed with me henceforth.

242
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:52,555
Preetham is too blessed to
have a father like you.

243
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:55,756
Anyone else in your place would
have got him a step mother.
replacement for everything

244
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:00,680
But nothing can replace love.

245
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:05,032
What words! But Preetham's
thoughts are completely opposite.

246
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,000
He befriends a new
girl every 3 months.

247
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:08,195
Today's generation is like that.

248
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:13,078
They have too many options and
hence too many confusions.

249
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:16,442
They feel trial and error method
is the only plausible way.
understand that.

250
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,072
Super sir!

251
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,121
If every parent becomes
so accommodating,

252
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,235
then our nation will
become Eden (Ram Rajya)

253
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:26,320
Ah! What theatrics is this?

254
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:27,360
Sorry sir.

255
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:29,792
Got bit emotional and
became little dramatic.

256
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:30,760
Take it

257
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:32,792
I will wear it myself.

258
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,992
No no. I will put it myself.
Or else mom will feel bad.

259
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:37,040
Yes.

260
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:42,639
Watch this SundanSir

261
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,272
This generation does
these things also.

262
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,240
Correct Sir.

263
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:47,912
But a moment before you were
complaining about my son!

264
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:48,880
Sorry sir.

265
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:53,677
Dad, this noon I will
prepare lunch myself.

266
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,912
We will have food together.

267
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:55,800
Uncle, you too.

268
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:58,240
Fine?

269
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,472
Today I will do
whatever you tell me.

270
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:02,072
Just order.

271
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:03,072
If it is like that,

272
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:06,112
I'm going to Kashmir for a
business trip. Join me.

273
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:06,912
KashmirlH mm

274
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:07,880
Sure dad. I will come.

275
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:09,952
Sir! I had booked only two
tickets for both of us.

276
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:10,920
Should I book another ticket?

277
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes. Book it.

278
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:15,272
If my son is coming along then why
are you tagging around as an extra.

279
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:16,240
Iam an extra!

280
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,281
Preetham, will you surely go?

281
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:19,520
Yeah sure.

282
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:22,597
Sir please consider again.
You know about Preetham.

283
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:23,752
By the time he wakes up
in the morning, no one

284
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:24,792
knows what mood he will
be hanging around with.

285
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:26,952
Why don't you do what
I tell you to dol?

286
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:29,032
Should ltrust my
son or your son?

287
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,152
Good one dad.

288
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:33,760
Why should he pull down my son
in front of his son. Poor son.

289
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,432
Should I wait at the
parking lot sir?

290
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:44,481
Why? You have finished
dropping us right.

291
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:45,515
Go back to office and
look after the works.

292
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:47,440
What are you intending to say?

293
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,992
That I would come all
along till here and

294
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,643
then have a change of
mind and would go away?

295
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:51,792
Err

296
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,512
Dad, this is ridiculous!

297
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:57,512
Preetham, is there a relation to his
name Sundar (beautiful) and to his face

298
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,672
Right. Even his thoughts
and words are like that.

299
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,712
They are never related.
Don't stress.

300
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:06,559
He thinks everyone
is like his son.

301
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:14,721
Dad, I will get some snacks.
Do you need anything?

302
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,157
Get me a fruit punch.
Yes.

303
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,360

The travel is enchanting.

307
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,632
Places are pledged to see.

308
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,874
People are pleasant,

309
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:47,921
Excuse me sir.Your order is ready.

310
00:24:50,313 --> 00:24:51,724

Helps you touch and
feel Rajasthan.

313
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:17,792
Preetham, where are you?

314
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:19,761

411
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,032

421
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,764

00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:04,443

00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:19,801

Bye!! Mr wonderfull

561
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:47,073

00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,917
you pulled the chain &
swallowed even that.

563
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:51,719
Because of these people I
have had no breakfast yet.

564
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,073
Hello excuse me

565
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:07,078
Who do you think I am? A boy
or some old tornjeans?

566
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:09,593
You are dry washing
me in the sun.

567
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:10,633
Could you stop
addressing me formally.

568
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:13,205
From now on, treat
me like your friend.

569
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,965

00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:22,876
Catch.

573
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:24,035
<i>7.</i>

574
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,402
I have heard that if boys
don't eat biscuit thrown at

575
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:34,673
them by girls,then they are
bound to get ulcer in heart

576
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,358
Yes. I too have 3 rules

577
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,873
We should follow that
rules at any cost.

578
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh! is that why you
gave me 3 biscuits!

579
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:41,913
What ifl don't agree

580
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:42,995
Just good bye.

581
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:46,161
Rule no 1.

582
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:49,202
From now on, we are temporary

583
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:50,433
Boyfriend & Girlfriend

584
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,357
Just for 5-6 days,that's it

585
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:54,441
really super

586
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:56,713
If all girls think like you,

587
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:59,285
First of all, boys
won't commit sins

588
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:02,873
They can do whatever they want,
they could roam freely & be happy.

589
00:40:02,874 --> 00:40:05,764
It would lead to
population control too.

590
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:07,235
Ok, next Biscuit

591
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:09,116
Rule no 2

592
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,353

593
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:13,436
mental relationship between us.

No relationship at all

595
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:32,755
Mentally, is ok

596
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:39,159
But we will have to think about physical,
because it is out of our control

597
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,395
ok. We don't need it.

598
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:44,116
If both of us don't want
it, then we don't need it.

599
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:47,393
But if both of us do need it,
then too we don't want it.

600
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:51,160
Force is never an option. No,
no, no, we don't <i>need</i> it.

601
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,481
Rule n03.

Double 0k

605
00:41:00,114 --> 00:41:03,197
I won't talk to you even if
you greet me in my dreams.

606
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,036
Okay? Hmm.

607
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:07,557
One minute please.

608
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:12,399
Rules are meant to be broken.
What if I break these rules,

609
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:14,961
and do something
unplanned to you?

610
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,080
Iam fine with it.

611
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:25,521

this forsaken desert.

Something like that.

617
00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:44,036
From now on, we are forbidden
from using mobiles.

618
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:47,243
And only I will determine the
expenditure of this trip.

619
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:48,276
Okay?

620
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:51,477

Oh shit! Cheating!

00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:41,555
There is no commode here!

697
00:46:43,754 --> 00:46:44,596
What is that?

698
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,403
Is this hole a commode?

699
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:50,597
This is Indian style toilet.
People here use this.

700
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:53,877
Why did you bargain for 400 rupees?
That's why he gave this toilet

701
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:58,313
<i>Even</i> if <i>you</i> give 1000 <i>rupees, you</i> won't
<i>get</i> a <i>western</i> commode <i>toilet here.</i>

702
00:46:58,314 --> 00:46:59,281
Now relax

00:47:04,714 --> 00:47:07,763
Just because this is a new
experience, I am not protesting.

706
00:47:23,034 --> 00:47:26,117
What's that? Why were you so
interested in that painting?

707
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:29,277
Were you present in that
group in your past life?

708
00:47:29,394 --> 00:47:35,037
As ditto as in this painting, I want to
steal men's clothes when they are bathing.

709
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,403
I thought you were just mischievous.
But you are dangerous

00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:40,436
Yes

711
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:45,594
You don't have desires like standing on
the top ofthe falls and shouting 0.

712
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:46,841
D0 you?

713
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:47,955
No. Why?

714
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,284
One of my girlfriend had such desires.
So I left her there itself.

715
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:54,435
Crazy fellow.

716

00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:59,956
I was expecting something else.

728
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:02,122
So you forgot all those
conditions so soon.

729
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:04,353
Have yourfood.
Rajasthan special.

730
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:05,321
Jalebi and Kachori.

731
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:10,394
No girlfriend of mine had
ever given me such dinner.
to you that you are boring?

732
00:49:12,634 --> 00:49:15,444
I have never given any
girl so much of time.

733
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:18,562
Why? Do you intend to say so?

734
00:49:18,674 --> 00:49:20,722
You should make sure I never say it.
Can you?

735
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:23,993
One should always try to
do what's impossible.

736
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,803
Then something will happen.

737
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:29,203
Oh! ls that why you have
had so many breakups?

738
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,433
Yes. But none of my
breakups are boring.

739
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:34,433
Each one of them are
colorful and interesting.

740
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,198
Should I narrate it in
prose or in poetry.

741
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:37,594
Mind you, they are all original.

742
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:02,441
Preeta m ...Yea h!

743
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:04,555
Imagine both of us
riding on 100 kmh.

744
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:05,402
Wow!! And then?

745
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:07,440
Then you apply break.

746
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:09,595
I will hug you in slow motion

747
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:10,792
No. It cannot happen

748
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:11,760
why?

749
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:15,153
If I drive the car, you'll
be sitting next to me

750
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:16,121
ifl hit the break your head
will hit the front glass

751
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:17,313
<i>“W Dummy</i>

752
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:18,520
Not the car on Bike

753
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,513
On the Bike!!!

754
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:21,356
Yeah!!

755
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,436
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to ride a bike

756
00:50:24,553 --> 00:50:25,520
Whatl! Are You Joking?

757
00:50:25,634 --> 00:50:26,673
I'm telling the truth

758
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:30,565
Because 2 wheeler is risky, my
dad <i>never</i> allowed <i>me</i> to learn it

759
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:31,600
You Father's son!

760
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:32,753
Why didn't you say this earlier

761
00:50:32,754 --> 00:50:34,643
You asked me today right?

762
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:36,914
Ok,Thank you.

763
00:50:38,674 --> 00:50:39,675
Take this.

764
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:45,360
Brother

765
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:46,552
Yes!

766
00:50:46,553 --> 00:50:47,592
Your Helmet is better than that

767
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:48,472
Thankyou

768
00:50:48,473 --> 00:50:49,440
ls it waterproof?

769
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:50,840
No it is Bulletproof

770
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:11,953

Jai ho!! to Rajasthan.

774
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:40,522
A life lasts for four
days like a chewing gum

775
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:45,359
Don't care for anyone
and hit those drum

776
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:26,284
Thrust into your pocket
what is necessary.

777
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:30,874
Throw into dust
what is unwanted.

778
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:35,678
Bind all the happiness
and courier it to me

779
00:52:37,993 --> 00:52:40,997
and get all your friends
to honeymoon also.

780
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:46,441
Life means searching for
something new everyday

781
00:52:48,313 --> 00:52:52,034
If we keep scratching about
what's this & why is this!

782
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:54,673
Biriyani becomes boring

783
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:55,713
Your pant gets torn

784
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,681
You arefilled with gas

785
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,434
Everybody's

786
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:13,679
Everybody's

787
00:53:14,834 --> 00:53:16,913
Everybody's mind has gone wrong

788
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:18,837
Bang bang, it is camel song.

789
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:24,638
Keep dancing life long

790
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:28,197
Bang bang camel song.

791
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:55,278
Hey Nandhini, Stop!! Stop

792
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:56,595
Stop it.

793
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:01,074
What happenedl!

794
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:05,405
I think I'm Pregnant

795
00:54:06,594 --> 00:54:07,959
You are incorrigible

796
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:11,873
Miss Nandhini,

797
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,032
you know what is the
moral of the story is?

798
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:14,000
What?

799
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:18,033
If an untrained tiger eats footpath
grass, it is bound to get food poisoning.

800
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:21,720
No matter what, you boys
don't lessen your buildups

801
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:23,355
That's Right.

802
00:54:24,434 --> 00:54:29,153
It would be a shame to our beard

803
00:54:29,154 --> 00:54:34,763
Brother, he is suffering
from ill health.

804
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,395
Ok

805
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,915
Open your mouth

806
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:07,481
Preeta m

807
00:55:08,313 --> 00:55:09,394

What happened to you!!?

814
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:25,313
You gave me the pills
that ladies take right.

815
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:27,316
So I was thinking what would
happen in the morning

816
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:29,553
You!!! If! give
medicine out of sympathy

817
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:31,556

to tease me right!

818
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:34,475
Tease me again 84

819
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,925
Oh my dear Prince.

Look son.The moon

821
00:55:54,553 --> 00:55:55,520
Why are you acting crazy?

822
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,636
Hey!!! What's wrong with you

823
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:00,601

Cockroach 84 Ant

828
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:10,433
So except humans everyone!

829
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,432
Rabbit?

830
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:12,514
Yes. Even a rabbit.

831
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:13,672
Is his name Devdas?

832
00:56:13,673 --> 00:56:15,675
Hal! Correct! How do you know?

833
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,835
He had come in my dream
yesterday &told me everything

834
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:22,753
Mr. Preetam

835
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,721
No matter how hard you try,

836
00:56:23,874 --> 00:56:25,953
you will not get any
details about me.

837
00:56:25,954 --> 00:56:26,472
As you helped me in this
desert by giving those pills

838
00:56:26,473 --> 00:56:27,998
As you helped me in this
desert by giving those pills

839
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:29,992
So I thought of thanking
you with yourfull name.

840
00:56:29,993 --> 00:56:32,041
If you don't want to
share no problem,

841
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:33,154
Goodnight

842
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:47,034
Mommy, I love you Mom

843
00:56:51,513 --> 00:56:53,073
I like you so much Mom

844
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,075
I love You Mom

845
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:57,564
Mom When I grow up I
will become a pilot &

846
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,114
show you whole world in a plane.

847
00:57:05,193 --> 00:57:06,479
Mom, I love You Mom.

848
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:13,481
Sir, haven't you
left for home yet?

849
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:14,560
For whose sake
should I go to home?

850
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:17,592
Mom, Dad or wife? No one
is waiting for me there.

851
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:18,560
All I have is my only son

852
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:19,752
He's gone out of town

853
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:22,597
Without him, my home
and office are same.

854
00:57:23,993 --> 00:57:26,041
So you keep watching
your son's video?

855
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:28,918
I have recorded him
talking in his sleep

856
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:33,473
He murmurs his mother's name in his sleep.
But not mine.
a good physiatrist

857
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:34,396
Why?

858
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:38,683
He might give an idea after which
he keeps murmuring your name

859
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:43,924
First send your son
for consultation.
then we'll think about it

860
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:49,835
No matter which topic, he
has to end it on my son.

861
00:57:55,314 --> 00:57:57,112
Hey!! Looks like some
cultural activity is going on

862
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,152
Can we go?

863
00:57:58,153 --> 00:57:59,234
Yeah Sure

864
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:57,200
Drink the milk

865
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,633
May your child be as
strong 84 fit as a camel.

866
00:59:19,634 --> 00:59:22,922
Let your life's journey
be happy & peace full

867
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:29,595
It is so hard to give
birth to a human child

868
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:32,558
He blessed us to have
child like a camel.

869
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,712
Did he think that we
were husband and wife?

870
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:38,001
May your child be as
strong 84 fit as a camel.

871
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:40,075
Please stop. Stop.

872
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:42,280
Please stop sister.

873
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:45,112
Please have a ride.
Just 200 rupees.

874
00:59:45,113 --> 00:59:47,112
Missing a camel ride after
coming to Rajsathan

875
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:48,312
Missing a camel ride after
coming to Rajsathan

876
00:59:48,313 --> 00:59:50,361
is like missing meals
in Dharmasthala.

877
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:51,599
What do you say?

878
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:55,598
I will ride the camel myself.
What do you say?

879
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,755
You know Nandhini.

880
01:00:00,914 --> 01:00:02,803
Iam taking you to Pakistan.

881
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:05,042
Of course you are. Can you
afford Paris or what?

882
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:08,237
Pakistan is just 65
kilometers away from here.

883
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,433
I was planning to give you to them
and ask to forget about Kashmir.

884
01:00:12,434 --> 01:00:14,673
Don't you think it is a
good exchange offer?

885
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:15,713
If you have guts then go.

886
01:00:15,714 --> 01:00:17,204
Wow, my temporary Laila!

887
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:20,320
Now watch this temporary
Majnu's guts.

888
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:22,754
Run my child.

889
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:24,952
Hey! Be careful.

890
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:27,032
Don't worry.This
is four wheeler.

891
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:29,718
<i>I'm expert in all
four wheeler driving.</i>

892
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:31,559
Run my strong camel!

893
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,241
Slow down.

894
01:00:34,313 --> 01:00:35,917
Okay okay. Slow down

895
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:41,404
Thanks. For a moment I thought
you would go to Pakistan.

896
01:00:42,793 --> 01:00:46,923
Hey baby! Ride with me also.
We will also make you famous.
and then I will come there.

897
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:50,392
You whore! I will...

898
01:00:50,393 --> 01:00:56,958
Salim! Are you hurt? Hit her.

899
01:00:57,193 --> 01:00:59,241
Hello brother! Do you
want to land in prison?

900
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:00,392
Do you want to fight?

901
01:01:00,393 --> 01:01:04,632
See if you hit me once, I assure
you, you will be beaten twice.

902
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:06,715
Then I will have to take you to hospital,
treat you for fracture and all.

903
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,922
See my dad is a minister and
her dad is commissioner.

904
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:12,917
You abused her, she hit you back.
Account is settled!

905
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:14,072
So you decide, war or peace?

906
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:17,077
Forget it. It was our mistake.
Let's move.

907
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:19,393
Now that's good.

908
01:01:20,274 --> 01:01:22,038
What type ofa guy are you?

909
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:24,513
I thought you would go
after them and belt them.

910
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,432
But you frightened them
with your dialogue itself.

911
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:27,604
But you frightened them
with your dialogue itself.

912
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:30,081
God has given us
brains to use it.

913
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:35,481
Those who don't have it, use their
hands, legs, machetes, guns etc.

914
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:40,794
Apart from that, you are
my temporary girlfriend.
Don't you think?

915
01:01:41,513 --> 01:01:43,834
You...

916
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:56,002
Even if we share it equally,
it will be halfa bottle.

917
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:57,445
Can you drink that much?

918
01:01:58,994 --> 01:02:00,996
One should try to do
what is impossible.

919
01:02:01,113 --> 01:02:03,161
Then something will happen.

920
01:02:25,154 --> 01:02:27,043
Wow! Now you are a raw girl.

921
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,440
Mr sure, answer a
simple question.

922
01:02:34,034 --> 01:02:35,718
Will you answer it surely?

923
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,192
Yeah sure.

924
01:02:37,193 --> 01:02:40,515
All the men in Rajasthan
were wearing white dhotis.

925
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:43,522
Were they all wearing underwear?

926
01:02:49,673 --> 01:02:50,674
Are you sure?

927
01:02:52,914 --> 01:02:54,678
See!You are not sure.

928
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:56,761
Oh shit!

929
01:02:56,914 --> 01:02:57,953
What?

930
01:02:57,954 --> 01:03:01,037
Doctor, you forgot to give me tablets.
Give it.

931
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:05,233
Alcohol is medicine
to all ailments.

932
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:06,315
Drink it.

933
01:03:08,594 --> 01:03:09,561
Doctor,
hmm

934
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,554
Ask

935
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:15,633
If boys talk dirty then they
are perceived as perverts.

936
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:17,682
What should we call
girls who talk dirty?

937
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,833
F pervert.

938
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:19,912
What?

939
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:20,914
<i>Female pervert.</i>

940
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:32,398
You know F pervert, of all the F's I
have met, you are very different F.

941
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:35,756
Mr Sure.

942
01:03:37,954 --> 01:03:39,877
Let me tell you a secret.

943
01:03:41,273 --> 01:03:42,320
Yeah.Tell me.

944
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:48,919
A girl's character is completely
opposite of what she appears outwardly.

945
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:57,082
What she hides to the world,
is her true character.

946
01:03:58,514 --> 01:03:59,561
So

947
01:04:00,553 --> 01:04:04,035
Are you original or duplicate?

948
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:06,874
Why don't you confirm it first?

949
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:11,042
Are you original or duplicate.

950
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:14,554
Iam always virgin.

951
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:16,396
- Hmm

952
01:04:16,514 --> 01:04:17,640
Oh sorry! Original.

953
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:21,595
Correct.

954
01:04:22,674 --> 01:04:25,075
You are nuts and
you act like nuts.

955
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:28,635
You dump girls
because of boredom,

956
01:04:28,793 --> 01:04:31,558
and when asked why
you have no clue!

957
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:32,994
Yeah correct.

958
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:35,802
So now confirm who are you?

959
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,393
Are you original or duplicate?

960
01:04:39,394 --> 01:04:40,441
I won't say.

961
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:45,153
No son ofa tonsured woman
(bastard) can find that out

962
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:51,633
Son ofa tonsured. . ..
It sounds good yaar.

963
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,032
What does it mean?

964
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:56,152
You don't know who is a
son ofa tonsured woman!

965
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,154
No.

966
01:04:57,874 --> 01:05:01,633
Son ofa tonsured woman means
son of a tonsured woman.

967
01:05:01,634 --> 01:05:02,993
You know one more word?

968
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:06,237
Your father's . .. . do
you know what it means?

969
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:10,353
Yourfathefls!

970
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:11,393
Very good.

971
01:05:11,394 --> 01:05:13,442
Every other moment you
keep mentioning your dad.

972
01:05:13,554 --> 01:05:17,354
But your dad hasn't taught
you any of these wordsl?

973
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:19,554
<i>Here, have it.</i>

974
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,997
Call him right now and ask him why
he hasn't taught you proper Kannada.

975
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,121
Yeah sure.

976
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:27,196
Go bring thejuice.

977
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:28,315
Yes sir.

978
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:33,198
Check who is calling.

979
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,201
True caller app says
it's some Nandhini.

980
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:41,192
Hello Sundar here.

981
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:42,399

982
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,123
Son of a tonsured woman.

983
01:05:47,593 --> 01:05:48,640
Yourfathefls

984
01:05:49,714 --> 01:05:52,160

01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:55,963
Is he your son to talk nonsense.
He is my son.

986
01:05:56,114 --> 01:05:56,952
Put it on speaker.

987
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:57,920
Yes sir.

988
01:05:59,033 --> 01:06:00,000
What's it Preetu?

989
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:02,993
I hate you dad.You haven't
taught me proper Kannada.

990
01:06:02,994 --> 01:06:04,996
He has taught you
nothing properly.

991
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:08,954
You can't ride bike.You
can't use Indian toilet.

992
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:11,238
He knows only”yeah"”sure"

993
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:15,558
You are sure! Your dad
is surely father.

994
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:17,194
Did you listen dad?

995
01:06:18,073 --> 01:06:21,156
Just because you are fixed,
don't fix me either.

996
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:23,803
Call me in morning. Bye.

997
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:25,272
It's not my son sir. It's yours.

998
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,037
There is a new name to the list.
Nandhini.

999
01:06:27,113 --> 01:06:27,912
Speaks like toned milk.

1000
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:29,039
Speaks like toned milk.

1001
01:06:30,313 --> 01:06:34,443
I had a great desire of getting
drunk and to speak incessantly.

1002
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:36,915
That got realized
today with you.

1003
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:38,795
Aye Nandhini,

1004
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,881
You look so beautiful when drunk

1005
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:43,074
So what?

1006
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:52,517
If boys look into your eyes, then their
hearts are bound to be shattered.
the mirror daily?

1007
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:55,675
Are you trying to propose me?

1008
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,395
Your smile...

1009
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:08,084
is a wonderful painting.

1010
01:07:10,754 --> 01:07:11,755
I want to

1011
01:07:13,673 --> 01:07:17,598
hang this painting on the wall
of my heart for eternity.

1012
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:21,559
Would you permit
to do so Nandhini?

1013
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:23,962
Even if you permit or not,

1014
01:07:25,394 --> 01:07:27,396
even if you forget
or remember me,

1015
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,633
even if you get married,
bear kids and become old

1016
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:30,715
and even if you die,

1017
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:35,034
my love for you
won't die Nandhini.

1018
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:46,923
You believed it right?

1019
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:54,242
You thought it was true right.

1020
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:59,834
Hey Nandhini, you
should see yourself.

1021
01:08:01,314 --> 01:08:02,679
Look at your face.

1022
01:08:48,153 --> 01:08:49,200
Hey Preetham

1023
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,199
Sorry. Free tham.

1024
01:08:53,193 --> 01:08:55,082
See how you are sleeping?

1025
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:56,240
Just like a child.

1026
01:08:56,354 --> 01:08:58,472
To be honest, you are a child.

1027
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:01,556
Afather's son who keeps
murmuring his mother's name.

1028
01:09:01,673 --> 01:09:03,562
You keep saying 'sure sure'.

1029
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:08,202
But you are the most
'unsure' boy in the world.

1030
01:09:09,993 --> 01:09:12,072
Anyway, for being my
temporary boyfriend,

1031
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:15,202
for laughing a lot and making
me laugh a lot, for everything

1032
01:09:17,193 --> 01:09:18,524
Now let's breakup.

1033
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:20,798
I won't meet you ever.

1034
01:09:22,473 --> 01:09:23,553
I'm sure.

1035
01:09:23,554 --> 01:09:24,555
Bye

1036
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:41,555
Congratulations sir.
you and your son.

1037
01:09:42,153 --> 01:09:43,120
Double congrats.

1038
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:44,312
What is the matter?

1039
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,281
Just a minute sir. Play it

1040
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:47,481
Yes sir.

1041
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:50,965
Open your mouth sir.

1042
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:54,841
Stop it.

1043
01:09:55,634 --> 01:09:57,713
I can't bear this happiness
and am dancing Sir.

1044
01:09:57,714 --> 01:10:02,038
Our company has earned a profit
of 150 cores in three months.

1045
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:04,041
1.5 cores

1046
01:10:04,873 --> 01:10:07,001
This buildup is too
small for 1.5 cores.

1047
01:10:07,113 --> 01:10:10,273
No sir. This 15 cores is
equivalent to 1500 cores.

1048
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,321
How?

1049
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,553
Because it's my son
who made it...Hmm

1050
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:14,593
Err your son has made it.

1051
01:10:14,594 --> 01:10:15,595
My Son!

1052
01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:18,673
Yes sir. One an average Preetham
used to spend <i>5</i> million.

1053
01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:20,676
But he hasn't spent a single
pie from past three months..

1054
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:25,432
<i>5</i> million thrice is 1.5 cores

1055
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,434
Really sir.

1056
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,593
Usually one becomes happy
when kids make profit.

1057
01:10:34,594 --> 01:10:36,596
And sad when they make losses.
Rig ht?...Yes sir

1058
01:10:36,754 --> 01:10:38,324
But our boss is opposite.

1059
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,838
He is so sad that his
son has made profits.

1060
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:19,314
This isfor you.

1061
01:11:22,473 --> 01:11:23,474
So...

1062
01:11:24,594 --> 01:11:26,596
tell me.Preetam
What's your worry?

1063
01:11:26,713 --> 01:11:28,283
Doctor, I think...

1064
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:28,872
Slowly. Relax and narrate.

1065
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:34,562
Slowly. Relax and narrate.

1066
01:11:35,033 --> 01:11:39,834
Doctor I think, I have gone mad.

1067
01:11:41,074 --> 01:11:46,365
I think I have gone insane.

1068
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:49,754
Yeah it happens.

1069
01:11:51,753 --> 01:11:52,800
It happens!

1070
01:11:53,673 --> 01:11:55,994
But why do you feel so Preetham?

1071
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:01,679
Because. . . .l think I am not normal.
lam abnormal.

1072
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:05,755
Possible. Please have your tea.

1073
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,354
Yeah!! Thank you

1074
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:15,238
So what's normal &
abnormal according to you?

1075
01:12:15,714 --> 01:12:20,754
Doctor you are so
beautiful and hot.

1076
01:12:20,994 --> 01:12:21,961
Then you are normal.

1077
01:12:22,073 --> 01:12:23,723
Your reactions are normal.

1078
01:12:27,993 --> 01:12:28,960
No doctor!

1079
01:12:29,033 --> 01:12:32,116
If I was normal, by now I
would have proposed to you

1080
01:12:32,233 --> 01:12:36,557
and we would be in some exotic
country doing. . . . .you know

1081
01:12:38,594 --> 01:12:41,592
But I am not feeling to
do such things you know.

1082
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:45,314
From past three months,
nothing or no one excites me.

1083
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:48,079
Do you know why?

1084
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:51,513
Because I am not normal.
I'm abnormal.

1085
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:55,923
Yeah sure. I am abnormal.

1086
01:13:00,393 --> 01:13:07,277
You must be the only father who must
be rejoicing at his son's insanity.

1087
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:09,192
You keep looking
elsewhere in Pubs

1088
01:13:09,193 --> 01:13:10,113
You keep looking
elsewhere in Pubs

1089
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:12,640
You have stopped
mingling with people.

1090
01:13:12,953 --> 01:13:13,920
Do you know why?

1091
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:17,192
Because you are present
here only physically.

1092
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:21,482
But your heart has gone away
with the one who has left you.

1093
01:13:23,394 --> 01:13:26,921
That witch from Rajasthan
has disturbed your mind.

1094
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:30,317
You are in love Preetham.

1095
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,443
No! I don't believe this.

1096
01:13:32,953 --> 01:13:34,364
No! No chance.

1097
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:40,353
Like a travel agency package,
after spending, 6 days,3 hours,

1098
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:43,313
in Total 147 hours, she left
without even saying a word.

1099
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:45,316
That Nandhini! Am I loving her?

1100
01:13:46,473 --> 01:13:47,315
No chance dad.

1101
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:51,397
Preetu, when is my birthday?

1102
01:13:52,674 --> 01:13:56,913
May 23rd . . . 24th ... <i>..</i> no.
correct, it's 30th.

1103
01:13:56,914 --> 01:14:00,043
Do you know in which cross
is our house located?

1104
01:14:00,114 --> 01:14:03,835
Dad! Am I a postal guy?

1105
01:14:05,193 --> 01:14:08,276
You don't remember your dad's birthday.You
don't even know your address.

1106
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:13,393
But you remember those 147
hours spent with Nandhini.

1107
01:14:14,633 --> 01:14:16,317
That too after 6 months.

1108
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:21,032
My dear dad, Rajasthan trip is an
unforgettable experience of my life.

1109
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:23,513
That is why I remember it.
That's it.

1110
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:35,521
Nandhini. . . I
miss you Nandhini.

1111
01:14:35,913 --> 01:14:36,914
I miss you.

1112
01:14:37,993 --> 01:14:40,724
Why did you leave me
like that Nandhini.

1113
01:14:42,233 --> 01:14:44,520
Why did you not say
a single word?

1114
01:14:46,514 --> 01:14:47,879
Why did you leave me?

1115
01:14:49,394 --> 01:14:49,512
You have always mumbled your
mother's name in your sleep.

1116
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:52,437
You have always mumbled your
mother's name in your sleep.

1117
01:14:52,553 --> 01:14:54,632
But for the first time
you have taken a girls

1118
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:56,715
name,and that too Nandhini's
name in your sleep

1119
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:01,834
What do you have
to say about this?
her name in my dreams, is it love?

1120
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:06,157
Preetu, Nandhini has occupied
your sub consciousness.

1121
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:09,432
That is why, you keep mumbling
her name in your sleep.

1122
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:10,878
This is your true love.

1123
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:25,644
Dad that means, I have
never loved anyone truly!

1124
01:15:26,034 --> 01:15:28,082
If you had loved them truly, none
of them would have bored you.

1125
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:32,433
Even if you had broken with them, their
memories would have haunted you.

1126
01:15:32,434 --> 01:15:35,278
See, how deeply Nandhini
is haunting you.

1127
01:15:36,674 --> 01:15:41,635
She is that non-boring girl you had
been searching all along your life.

1128
01:16:18,233 --> 01:16:21,840
It is going to snow and rain
in another ten minutes.

1129
01:16:33,193 --> 01:16:36,273
You got her address right dad?

1130
01:16:36,274 --> 01:16:37,924

1131
01:16:38,354 --> 01:16:40,833

1134
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:08,152
I remember it vividly

1135
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:13,153
It was your smile
that started it all.

1136
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:17,153
To every nook of my heart

1137
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:22,154
you tread with a
royal procession.

1138
01:17:22,233 --> 01:17:27,233
Into the furnace of my dreams

1139
01:17:27,353 --> 01:17:31,352
I've been blowing my breaths.

1140
01:17:31,353 --> 01:17:36,353
Iam damn sure the
sparks will raise now.

1141
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:43,352
I remember it vividly

1142
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:50,282
It was your smile
that started it all.

1143
01:18:12,034 --> 01:18:16,033
My eyes behold all the letters.

1144
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:21,032
You are my postal box

1145
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:26,033
Everything I see
reminds me of you

1146
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:30,033
You are the remedy
for my insanity.

1147
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:35,032
After starting this
beautiful chapter

1148
01:18:35,033 --> 01:18:39,032
it would be grave injustice
if I don't get you.

1149
01:18:39,033 --> 01:18:43,032
My thoughts and actions

1150
01:18:43,033 --> 01:18:48,033
after desiring you

1151
01:18:48,034 --> 01:18:53,034
are metamorphosing for sure.

1152
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:59,032
I remember it vividly

1153
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:03,834
It was your smile
that started it all.

1154
01:19:57,513 --> 01:20:02,472
Has set the stage
for you to dance.

1155
01:20:02,473 --> 01:20:07,473
My life without looking at you

1156
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:11,473
is like a newspaper
without news.

1157
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:16,472
I don't need bail
if I get arrested

1158
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:20,472
From now on, it is my
rules for romance.

1159
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:25,473
In burning memories

1160
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:29,553
I have spent nights.

1161
01:20:29,554 --> 01:20:32,392
A dawn will break now for sure.

1162
01:20:32,393 --> 01:20:37,393
I remember it vividly

1163
01:20:37,394 --> 01:20:45,199
It was your smile
that started it all.

1164
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:22,083
Did the wheel get punctured?

1165
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:23,241
What Happened?

1166
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:30,792
Now where shall I
go to get petrol?

1167
01:21:30,793 --> 01:21:32,952
Now where shall I
go to get petrol?

1168
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:36,435
Nonsense

1169
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,273

On top of that, you

So does that mean even you
are searching a girl?

You're not the only one.

1219
01:26:02,233 --> 01:26:03,233
<i>Everyone feels the same.</i>

01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:05,599
He is a bit insane.

1222
01:26:06,313 --> 01:26:08,156
Oh, I thought you were the only one,but
it seems like a family problem.

1223
01:26:08,274 --> 01:26:09,400
What did you say?

1224
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:17,793
There are already so many tensions
and now another one to the list

1225
01:26:39,353 --> 01:26:40,353
<i>Hi, Preetu</i>

You are not angry
about it right?

1231
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:22,392
All those conditions were
just for self-defense.

1232
01:27:22,393 --> 01:27:23,432
Defense!!!

1233
01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:25,432

01:27:25,433 --> 01:27:29,882
in a place where I don't know
anybody with a temporary boyfriend.

01:28:58,594 --> 01:29:00,437
Looks like there is
some crazy twist

1255
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:02,244
Desiring someone in heart &

1256
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:06,039
is common in our country.

1257
01:29:06,594 --> 01:29:09,404
Same might have happened
with Nandhini also.

1258
01:29:13,593 --> 01:29:15,197
Loving is never a crime.

1259
01:29:15,593 --> 01:29:17,402
Separating lovers is a crime.

1260
01:29:36,553 --> 01:29:38,681
Our rain is not
that easy brother.
subtle and yet dangerous.

1261
01:29:41,554 --> 01:29:43,636

poet inside this Major!

1264
01:29:54,674 --> 01:29:55,596
Okayjust wait.

1265
01:29:56,674 --> 01:29:58,005
It is not ladies club.

1266
01:29:58,674 --> 01:30:00,597
It is my sister in law's club.

1267
01:30:02,674 --> 01:30:03,641
Our servants.

1268
01:30:04,674 --> 01:30:06,324
Come, let me introduce you.

1269
01:30:07,673 --> 01:30:08,595
Different family!

1270
01:30:08,914 --> 01:30:10,040
Sister in law

You arejust like me.

1277
01:30:38,754 --> 01:30:42,679
Even if you have the cards to
show you struggle to do the show.

1278
01:30:43,753 --> 01:30:45,562
What do you mean 'like me'?

1279
01:31:00,754 --> 01:31:03,234
Is it a bar or an
interrogation chair?

1280
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:08,753
Hello hello.

1281
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,358

This mental major has opened
his own camp in house.

1284
01:31:17,753 --> 01:31:18,993
Ishould be alert.

1285
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:25,832
Meanwhile, we will
talk about something.

1286
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:26,913
Yeah sure

1287
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:28,913
Earlier, you had
mentioned about a girl.

1288
01:31:28,914 --> 01:31:29,912
Explain it in detail.

1289
01:31:29,913 --> 01:31:30,913
In detail?

1290
01:31:30,914 --> 01:31:31,912
Shall I show a demo?

1291
01:31:31,913 --> 01:31:32,232
Show it.

1292
01:31:32,233 --> 01:31:32,882
Show it.

1293
01:31:33,913 --> 01:31:34,880
This is my girl

1294
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:37,039
This is your girl

1295
01:31:38,914 --> 01:31:40,484
I have found my girl.

1296
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:43,881
Your girl,

1297
01:31:45,913 --> 01:31:49,884
So, I will confess all my
feelings to my girl & clear them.

1298
01:31:53,913 --> 01:31:55,278
Did you understand?

1299
01:31:57,913 --> 01:31:58,994
This is my girl.

1300
01:31:59,913 --> 01:32:00,913

01:35:55,273 --> 01:35:57,321
Dad I will call you later.

1303
01:35:59,314 --> 01:36:00,392
Good morning, Preetam

1304
01:36:00,393 --> 01:36:01,235
Hi, Doctor

1305
01:36:02,313 --> 01:36:04,433
Doctor,You are studying in
Michigan university right?

1306
01:36:04,434 --> 01:36:05,512
Yes.

1307
01:36:05,513 --> 01:36:09,793
There is an africal girl named
Michel studying 3rd year B tech.

1308
01:36:09,794 --> 01:36:11,873
She's a beautiful belly dancer.

1309
01:36:11,874 --> 01:36:13,399
I don't know how to dance

1310
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,115
She will teach you.

1311
01:36:16,153 --> 01:36:19,316
Late night party, midnight racing,
Ganja, LSD she knows everything

1312

Siddu, he is also
specialistjust like you.

1314
01:36:26,434 --> 01:36:29,553
But you are heart specialist
& he is breakup specialist

1315
01:36:29,554 --> 01:36:31,672
If you mix with him, you are bound to
forget everything you have learnt.

1316
01:36:31,673 --> 01:36:32,712
Ok, bye

1317
01:36:32,713 --> 01:36:33,192

Come. I will introduce
you to my Dad.

1324
01:36:47,353 --> 01:36:49,321
Gov't officers had come again

1325
01:36:51,714 --> 01:36:54,913
I have all the legal
documents in a proper way.

1326
01:36:54,914 --> 01:36:55,881
Lets see, what they will do.

1327
01:36:57,033 --> 01:36:58,762
My brother is very strict.

1328
01:36:59,154 --> 01:37:00,121
He has a Gun

1329
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:02,235
Don't do loose talks with him.

1330
01:37:02,354 --> 01:37:04,402
Ok sir. I will become
tight and talk to him.

1331
01:37:04,514 --> 01:37:05,515
Very good

1332
01:37:16,393 --> 01:37:18,113
Hi uncle, good morning

1333
01:37:18,114 --> 01:37:19,036
My name is Preetam.

1334
01:37:19,154 --> 01:37:22,203
I have been staying in your home since
yesterday night But you didn't notice.

1335
01:37:22,313 --> 01:37:24,513
Nothing happens in my house
without my knowledge.

1336
01:37:24,514 --> 01:37:26,118
Many things happen uncle.

1337
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:29,723
Wow! such good height,
personality & maintenance!

1338
01:37:29,874 --> 01:37:32,718
Let me be honest. You look like younger
brother and he looks like elder.

1339
01:37:34,354 --> 01:37:35,393
Am I right?

1340
01:37:35,394 --> 01:37:37,272
Dad didn't I tell you.
He is so mischievous.

1341
01:37:37,273 --> 01:37:39,432
He tortured me last night
about an invisible girl

1342
01:37:39,433 --> 01:37:42,632
now he's torturing me with
this visible stomach.

1343
01:37:42,633 --> 01:37:47,355
I should kick him out before he
starts eyeing on my other parts.

1344
01:37:47,954 --> 01:37:49,956
Uncle, who is the inspiration
for your fitness?

1345
01:37:50,393 --> 01:37:51,393
Is it Aunt?

1346
01:37:51,394 --> 01:37:54,353
It is our family Physician

1347
01:37:54,354 --> 01:37:58,564
ls she more beautiful than you?
Our family doctor is not a lady.

1348
01:37:59,433 --> 01:38:03,802
It's Siddharth. He looks after
Dad's calorie, diet from U.S.

1349
01:38:04,674 --> 01:38:06,722
This hospital is
being built for him.

1350
01:38:06,834 --> 01:38:11,032
Is it? Health Business! Fantastic business.
It is very good idea

1351
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:13,192
This hospital is not being
built for business.

1352
01:38:13,193 --> 01:38:13,512
SiddhartHs dream is to serve
the poor and under privileged.

1353
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,278
SiddhartHs dream is to serve
the poor and under privileged.

1354
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:19,283
When he returns from US
finishing his studies,

1355
01:38:20,233 --> 01:38:21,272
he will marry Nandhini

1356
01:38:21,273 --> 01:38:23,401
84 then the hospital
will be inaugurated.

1357
01:38:23,513 --> 01:38:26,673
Oh!!! For every word they
chant SiddhartHs name.

1358
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:29,120
Preetu, Stop
thinking about them,

1359
01:38:30,914 --> 01:38:32,962
first tell her about
yourfeelings.

1360
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:36,232
Send their family photos
to me, immediately.

1361
01:38:36,233 --> 01:38:37,644
Yeah sure Dad, Love you.

1362
01:38:38,393 --> 01:38:39,360
Love you dad
are seeing refers to the

1363
01:38:42,313 --> 01:38:45,203
new equipments developed
in Hotel's & restaurants

1364
01:38:45,314 --> 01:38:48,363
that are being adopted
in European union.

1365
01:38:49,593 --> 01:38:52,642
Actually the Mittal towers
have even given an order to

1366
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:55,034
construct 5 new Hotels in France

1367
01:38:57,033 --> 01:39:00,355
so we just taught that
entering to Asian market ml!

1368
01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:02,201
Oh!!! Sorry sir?

1369
01:39:05,954 --> 01:39:07,319
The theatre of my soul

1370
01:39:10,274 --> 01:39:11,313
Gentlemen,there is an
urgent family matter.

1371
01:39:11,314 --> 01:39:12,281
Please excuse us

1372
01:39:12,393 --> 01:39:13,394
ok, let's go

1373
01:39:15,593 --> 01:39:18,792
Everything is fine. But the girl's
father looks little authoritarian.

1374
01:39:18,793 --> 01:39:21,992
Looks like he is the villain
in Preetam's love story.

1375
01:39:21,993 --> 01:39:25,313
If the girls accept his love then
I won't care about any villain.

1376
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:26,554
I did not get you sir.

1377
01:39:27,273 --> 01:39:29,958
We will ask him with
love and respect,

1378
01:39:30,394 --> 01:39:33,284
<i>if he rejects,then
we</i> will <i>abduct her.</i>

1379
01:39:34,353 --> 01:39:36,401
I thought only boys
are violent in love.

1380
01:39:36,514 --> 01:39:39,279
But there fathers are
even more violent

1381
01:39:39,714 --> 01:39:41,793
Thank god, I don't
have any daughter

1382
01:39:41,794 --> 01:39:44,195
Ponnapa, only god
can rescue you now.

1383
01:39:44,994 --> 01:39:45,995
Come!

1384
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,359

ls this a gift for me?

1386
01:39:53,314 --> 01:39:53,832
It is a gift. But my
dad's gift to Siddharth.

1387
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:56,313
It is a gift. But my
dad's gift to Siddharth.

1388
01:39:56,393 --> 01:40:00,876

of being a temporary girlfriend.

It doesn't matter whether
you believe it or not.

01:47:42,993 --> 01:47:45,394

me or reject me.

1481
01:48:20,154 --> 01:48:22,077
Marrying someone else
for family pressure

1482
01:48:22,193 --> 01:48:24,355
My heart sings

1483
01:48:25,274 --> 01:48:26,480

1484
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:30,204

Who will loose their
mind in this crazy game.

01:48:38,594 --> 01:48:40,756
God willing it won't be my mind.

1489
01:49:53,914 --> 01:49:55,272

My world has been
caught in your hold.

1500
01:50:31,394 --> 01:50:34,753
Just because they didn't
enlist him into army,

1501
01:50:34,754 --> 01:50:39,393
It has been shattered by the
blows of myriad emotions.

1502
01:50:39,394 --> 01:50:42,952
It will take another five minutes
for the kabab to arrive.

1503
01:50:42,953 --> 01:50:47,193
All the words that
are restrained,

1504
01:50:47,194 --> 01:50:51,312
shouldn't they reach
their destination.

1505
01:50:51,313 --> 01:50:55,553
Can one smile without
breaking the silence.

1506
01:50:55,554 --> 01:50:59,792
Can one meet without
growing apart.

1507
01:50:59,793 --> 01:51:01,392
Iam a child who is lost

1508
01:51:01,393 --> 01:51:03,993
has not been found yet.

1509
01:51:03,994 --> 01:51:08,193
Without you.

1510
01:51:08,194 --> 01:51:11,112
Every morning

1511
01:51:11,113 --> 01:51:13,392
I remember you

1512
01:51:13,393 --> 01:51:16,392
Ok, I will explain again.

1513
01:51:16,393 --> 01:51:21,877
Every noon, every night

1514
01:52:21,434 --> 01:52:22,321
Hey!! Get down

1515
01:52:34,473 --> 01:52:37,556
Do you thinka girl's heart and
her house is a religious inn?

1516
01:52:38,714 --> 01:52:42,321
One can come without informing
& say anything. Right?

1517
01:52:43,354 --> 01:52:46,483
Are you the only one or
is every boy like this?

1518
01:52:47,473 --> 01:52:49,473
When it happens to you, it
is supposed to be real love!

1519
01:52:49,474 --> 01:52:53,320
After 6 months & only when
you feel free, you say it!

1520
01:52:53,634 --> 01:52:58,162
And we are supposed to accept it
instantly with a grin! Right?

1521
01:53:00,034 --> 01:53:01,035
Answer me?

1522
01:53:05,314 --> 01:53:07,396
I have not forced
anyone, anytime.

1523
01:53:08,474 --> 01:53:10,158
Oh!! So you get angry too?

1524
01:53:10,434 --> 01:53:11,435
Scold me, come on.

1525
01:53:12,433 --> 01:53:15,912
Curse,that let Nandhini,the girl
that I didn't get, die in an accident.

1526
01:53:15,913 --> 01:53:17,403
Curse,that let Nandhini,the girl
that I didn't get, die in an accident.

1527
01:53:18,633 --> 01:53:19,794
Nandhini please.

1528
01:53:27,074 --> 01:53:30,157
Nandhini you are an excellent
painting etc, etc...

1529
01:53:30,274 --> 01:53:34,643
If you permit, I will keep you in
my heart for eternity etc, etc...

1530
01:53:35,394 --> 01:53:38,364
Even ifl die, my love
won't die etc, etc...

1531
01:53:40,393 --> 01:53:42,839
You were so close,
just like this

1532
01:53:43,593 --> 01:53:46,722
and you had said these words
looking into my eyes.

1533
01:53:46,874 --> 01:53:48,364
But in just 4 seconds

1534
01:53:49,993 --> 01:53:52,041
you flipped 84 laughed saying

1535
01:53:52,273 --> 01:53:53,479
did you believe it?

1536
01:53:57,353 --> 01:53:58,354
I'm Sorry

1537
01:54:00,553 --> 01:54:01,520
I'm Really Sorry

1538
01:54:02,353 --> 01:54:03,878
You did not fool me.

1539
01:54:04,514 --> 01:54:06,960
In fact, you had
fooled yourself.

1540
01:54:07,714 --> 01:54:10,684
At least have you
understood it right now?

1541
01:54:24,514 --> 01:54:26,243
Me getting fooled in life

1542
01:54:29,474 --> 01:54:32,080
84 understanding
what is true love,

1543
01:54:33,713 --> 01:54:35,283
were both because of you.

1544
01:54:36,873 --> 01:54:38,034
Thanks for that.

1545
01:54:42,153 --> 01:54:44,201
I will never come back again.

1546
01:54:45,434 --> 01:54:46,321
I'm sure.

1547
01:54:50,594 --> 01:54:53,484
Preetam is a guy who
spreads excitement.

1548
01:54:54,633 --> 01:54:56,232
A bold guy who would honestly
say that he is bored.

1549
01:54:56,233 --> 01:54:58,440
A bold guy who would honestly
say that he is bored.

1550
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:02,320
A nice guy who has
changed for me.

1551
01:55:06,313 --> 01:55:09,362
I had left this good guy
once without informing.

1552
01:55:10,353 --> 01:55:12,959
I will be a fool to
let him go again.

1553
01:55:16,433 --> 01:55:17,473
I love you Preetam

1554
01:55:17,474 --> 01:55:19,158
Really, I love you!!!

1555
01:55:56,433 --> 01:56:01,433
After your entry into my heart

1556
01:56:02,633 --> 01:56:07,633
My heart has become a
culinary school of dreams.

1557
01:56:08,674 --> 01:56:13,674
Byjust smiling, you opened,

1558
01:56:13,954 --> 01:56:18,954
a school of love
through your eyes.

1559
01:56:20,354 --> 01:56:22,472
Tell me o friend,

1560
01:56:22,473 --> 01:56:25,473

1561
01:56:25,474 --> 01:56:28,673
Tell me o friend,

01:56:31,554 --> 01:56:34,672
Tell me o friend,

1565
01:56:36,553 --> 01:56:36,833
How am I to survive now!

1566
01:56:36,834 --> 01:56:37,872
Without you.

1567
01:56:37,873 --> 01:56:42,113
Without you.

1568
01:56:42,114 --> 01:56:44,232
Without you

1569
01:56:44,233 --> 01:56:48,353
I need you my love.

1570
01:56:48,354 --> 01:56:50,512
I can't live,

1571
01:56:50,513 --> 01:56:51,553
without you.

1572
01:56:51,554 --> 01:56:52,601
Without you.

1573
01:56:52,713 --> 01:56:54,553
Without you.

1574
01:56:54,554 --> 01:56:55,592
Without you

1575
01:56:55,593 --> 01:57:00,593
I too can't live.

1576
01:57:00,913 --> 01:57:05,913
After your entry into my heart

1577
01:57:07,313 --> 01:57:12,313
My heart has become a
culinary school of dreams.

1578
01:57:13,434 --> 01:57:15,592
You are the one who
came in my dream

1579
01:57:15,593 --> 01:57:18,676
You are the one who
brought beauty to my life

1580
01:57:18,793 --> 01:57:23,793
It hurts me to await more

1581
01:57:24,873 --> 01:57:29,873
Please don't leave my companion

1582
01:57:54,074 --> 01:57:57,192
This heart keeps
putting tantrums

1583
01:57:57,193 --> 01:58:02,193
like a small child.That you ought
to be with me for eternity.

1584
01:58:05,553 --> 01:58:10,553
The clock has picked up pace.

1585
01:58:10,554 --> 01:58:15,554
Like time flies, in
your companionship.

1586
01:58:16,873 --> 01:58:16,912
Like time flies, in
your companionship.

1587
01:58:16,913 --> 01:58:20,112
Tell me o friend,

1588
01:58:20,113 --> 01:58:22,233

Please don't leave my companion

1596
01:59:07,034 --> 01:59:10,233
In search of some solitude

1597
01:59:10,234 --> 01:59:13,392
I went into the forest.

1598
01:59:13,393 --> 01:59:16,392
In every step of mine

1599
01:59:16,393 --> 01:59:18,512
I was haunted by you.

1600
01:59:18,513 --> 01:59:23,513
The wandering heart has been
smitten by your desire.

1601
01:59:24,873 --> 01:59:29,872
Ifeel like I have found
my way to heaven.

1602
01:59:29,873 --> 01:59:33,072
Tell me o friend,

1603
01:59:33,073 --> 01:59:35,233
how am I to survive?

1604
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:37,313
I need you my love.

1605
01:59:37,314 --> 01:59:38,433
Without you.

1606
01:59:38,434 --> 01:59:42,484
Without you

1607
01:59:43,514 --> 01:59:44,515
Without you

1608
01:59:44,674 --> 01:59:45,755
I need you my love.

1609
01:59:48,873 --> 01:59:49,874
I can't live

1610
01:59:50,953 --> 01:59:51,920
without you.

1611
01:59:54,993 --> 01:59:55,994
Without you.

1612
01:59:56,113 --> 01:59:57,114
I can't live

1613
01:59:58,193 --> 01:59:59,240
I can't live.

1614
02:00:01,073 --> 02:00:02,113
Hellol!

1615
02:00:02,114 --> 02:00:03,081
Hello, hello, hello.

1616
02:00:03,234 --> 02:00:04,235
Over.

1617
02:00:05,314 --> 02:00:08,796
Now I have to even wait
for a cooking contractor.

1618
02:00:10,633 --> 02:00:12,752
I should interrogate him
as soon as he arrives.

1619
02:00:12,753 --> 02:00:14,118
Oh!!! He has a good car.

1620
02:00:17,873 --> 02:00:19,841
Oh!!! Even looks like a hero.

1621
02:00:21,073 --> 02:00:22,113
Hello.What's your name?

1622
02:00:22,114 --> 02:00:23,152
- Hi

1623
02:00:23,153 --> 02:00:24,154
Surya ka nth,

1624
02:00:24,273 --> 02:00:25,313
- Suryakanth.

1625
02:00:25,314 --> 02:00:27,112
When you have not arrived in
time to collect the contract.

1626
02:00:27,113 --> 02:00:31,432
Then, what is the assurance that you
will cook 84 serve the food properly

1627
02:00:31,433 --> 02:00:33,401
What is this? Confusion as
soon as I enter...Hello

1628
02:00:33,553 --> 02:00:34,593
The thing is major sir,

1629
02:00:34,594 --> 02:00:36,596
What is this? Your major
body has become hollow!

1630
02:00:36,713 --> 02:00:37,680
Iam aged right.

1631
02:00:37,794 --> 02:00:39,792
Keep my matter aside.
Why are you late?

1632
02:00:39,793 --> 02:00:43,354
There was a function on the
way, so I got delayed.

1633
02:00:44,073 --> 02:00:46,152
What types of food do you cook?

1634
02:00:46,153 --> 02:00:47,154
South lndian...Oh,ok.

1635
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:50,117
North Indian, Continental,
Chinese & Italian

1636
02:00:51,194 --> 02:00:53,313
We don't need Italian idly.

1637
02:00:53,314 --> 02:00:56,397
It is enough if you make
Udupi idly properly.

1638
02:00:56,514 --> 02:00:58,593
Sir,We even make military
idly...How does it look?

1639
02:00:58,594 --> 02:00:59,561
It looks like this...how?

1640
02:00:59,714 --> 02:01:01,682
It looks green like this Sir.

1641
02:01:02,714 --> 02:01:03,752
Ok,

1642
02:01:03,753 --> 02:01:06,802
do you wear suit like
this even while cooking?

1643
02:01:06,953 --> 02:01:09,032
No sir, we wear gloves 84 cook

1644
02:01:09,033 --> 02:01:10,000
New idea, get in please.

1645
02:01:10,114 --> 02:01:11,161
Brother

1646
02:01:14,353 --> 02:01:15,393
Who is this chotu?

1647
02:01:15,394 --> 02:01:16,122
Cooking Contractor.

1648
02:01:16,194 --> 02:01:17,232
Hi,

1649
02:01:17,233 --> 02:01:18,312
Ni

1650
02:01:18,313 --> 02:01:22,398
He is wearing suit now but will
wear gloves while cooking.

1651
02:01:22,554 --> 02:01:23,635
Oh!! Sit down

1652
02:01:25,754 --> 02:01:27,756
All the Guests who come
to this wedding are from
& Foreign countries.

1653
02:01:29,794 --> 02:01:33,003
So, you might have to cook more
North Indian & Continental Dishes

1654
02:01:33,794 --> 02:01:34,636
You can do it right?

1655
02:01:34,874 --> 02:01:36,876
Yes.
-Yes!! He will do

1656
02:01:36,994 --> 02:01:37,512
With thatthey will also do military idly
also. Please tell him to prepare that also.

1657
02:01:37,513 --> 02:01:39,312
With thatthey will also do military idly
also. Please tell him to prepare that also.

1658
02:01:39,313 --> 02:01:40,432
What!! Military ldly?

1659
02:01:40,433 --> 02:01:41,400
Yes

1660
02:01:43,433 --> 02:01:44,434
Hello my son!

1661
02:01:45,513 --> 02:01:46,594
Sir, Sorry sir.

1662
02:01:47,674 --> 02:01:48,712
We couldn't recognize!

1663
02:01:48,713 --> 02:01:53,713
Hey Chotu, Can't you realise!
hotel owner as a chef!!!

1664
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:54,913
It's ok, forget it.

1665
02:01:54,914 --> 02:01:56,359
I was aware of him.

1666
02:01:57,033 --> 02:01:58,073
I wasjust having some fun.

1667
02:01:58,074 --> 02:01:59,803
How does he know about me?

1668
02:02:00,233 --> 02:02:01,678
My Dad is always jovial.

1669
02:02:03,433 --> 02:02:06,198
He is notjust my Dad.
He is my best friend.

1670
02:02:06,313 --> 02:02:10,204
I should find out whether
he is a real father or not.

1671
02:02:10,594 --> 02:02:11,632
Love you Dad

1672
02:02:11,633 --> 02:02:13,635
Now, I will come
directly to the matter.

1673
02:02:13,754 --> 02:02:16,644
You daughter's wedding catering
will be arranged by our hotel.

1674
02:02:16,753 --> 02:02:17,675
It is my Preetham's wish also.

1675
02:02:17,794 --> 02:02:20,195
Our staff will be
here in two days.

1676
02:02:20,994 --> 02:02:22,996
You just explain
what you desire.

1677
02:02:23,113 --> 02:02:24,080
They will provide
you with samples.

1678
02:02:24,194 --> 02:02:25,798
Pick only what you like.

1679
02:02:26,274 --> 02:02:28,197
Don't worry about the Money.

1680
02:02:28,433 --> 02:02:29,798
So does it mean free!

1681
02:02:30,234 --> 02:02:32,362
It is not free.You
have to pay with love.

1682
02:02:32,474 --> 02:02:33,512
Which love?Who's love?

1683
02:02:33,513 --> 02:02:36,712
The one which you give us
& which we give you back.

1684
02:02:36,713 --> 02:02:38,713
Don't Confuse me.
Say it clearly.

1685
02:02:38,714 --> 02:02:41,718
A marriage in your house is
like marriage in our house

1686
02:02:41,873 --> 02:02:43,952
I thought only the
son was baffling.

1687
02:02:43,953 --> 02:02:46,113
But the father is
even more confusing

1688
02:02:46,114 --> 02:02:49,641
Uncle,Why are you thinking so much?
Just say yes.

1689
02:02:50,353 --> 02:02:54,278
The whole of Coorg should melt
in NandhinVs wedding feast.

1690
02:02:55,354 --> 02:02:58,995
Say yes. It is so good.

1691
02:02:59,633 --> 02:03:01,556
Fine. Please call your staff.

1692
02:03:01,713 --> 02:03:03,761
Why are you saying yes
to him Sir, tell me.

1693
02:03:06,874 --> 02:03:09,684
There is some secret
behind this contract

1694
02:03:11,113 --> 02:03:12,877
I should interrogate this.

1695
02:03:20,354 --> 02:03:22,356
You both are a beautiful pair.

1696
02:03:22,513 --> 02:03:24,592
Isn't this is the first time
you are seeing us together,

1697
02:03:24,593 --> 02:03:25,754
please bless us.

1698
02:03:28,674 --> 02:03:30,832
Lead a happy 84 prosperous
life for 100 years

1699
02:03:30,833 --> 02:03:31,952
100years!!

1700
02:03:31,953 --> 02:03:35,002
So 1 in 5 years then for
100 years 2O children

1701
02:03:35,153 --> 02:03:36,120
Are you ready to
give 20 children

1702
02:03:36,194 --> 02:03:37,232
hey!!!

1703
02:03:37,233 --> 02:03:40,442
20 is too muchjust give 11,
we can make an lPLTeam

1704
02:03:40,553 --> 02:03:41,593
Dad,

1705
02:03:41,594 --> 02:03:44,598
talk to Ponnappa & fix our
marriage today itself.

1706
02:03:45,513 --> 02:03:46,435
Isn't that why I
have come this far?

1707
02:03:46,554 --> 02:03:47,555
I love you dad

1708
02:03:50,793 --> 02:03:52,761
oh!!!! I cannot control this.

1709
02:03:55,874 --> 02:03:56,955
Hello

1710
02:04:03,354 --> 02:04:05,356
Sir!! I have wandered
around for 2 years.

1711
02:04:05,474 --> 02:04:08,842
I started the construction
only after DC's approval

1712
02:04:09,434 --> 02:04:12,592
Sir! I have spent 1SCrores
on the land & construction!

1713
02:04:12,593 --> 02:04:14,038
I will be doomed sir.

1714
02:04:14,754 --> 02:04:16,833
DC has changed 84
also the policies.

1715
02:04:16,834 --> 02:04:19,075
Try 84 understand.

1716
02:04:25,154 --> 02:04:26,201
What happened?

1717
02:04:28,354 --> 02:04:30,595
At least finish your lunch 84 go.

1718
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:56,715
What happened dear?

1719
02:04:58,473 --> 02:05:00,441
What shouldn't have happened.

1720
02:05:00,553 --> 02:05:04,444
My dream of building a hospital
& also the land is gone

1721
02:05:04,674 --> 02:05:06,802
<i>How can Haze iddhawth now'!?</i>

1722
02:05:12,073 --> 02:05:14,233
Hi sir. We are coming
from the DC office.

1723
02:05:14,234 --> 02:05:15,272
<i>Hi.</i>

1724
02:05:15,273 --> 02:05:16,313
Sir Please forgive us.

1725
02:05:16,314 --> 02:05:19,602
We did not know that
Ponnappa is yourfriend!

1726
02:05:21,673 --> 02:05:24,677
Keep that aside, is our
friend's problem solved?

1727
02:05:25,634 --> 02:05:28,752
My superior with greed
created this problem.

1728
02:05:28,753 --> 02:05:31,833
But as soon as you interfered,
<i>he</i> has become docile.

1729
02:05:31,834 --> 02:05:34,804
Check if everything
is alright Ponanppa.

1730
02:05:35,034 --> 02:05:38,117
Sir, please call the minister
& say that the job is done.

1731
02:05:38,234 --> 02:05:40,316
Or else we will lose our job.

1732
02:05:41,513 --> 02:05:42,480
I will. Leave now.

1733
02:05:42,594 --> 02:05:43,632
Thankyou Sir

1734
02:05:43,633 --> 02:05:44,600
Thankyou

1735
02:05:45,353 --> 02:05:46,393
Sir,

1736
02:05:46,394 --> 02:05:49,159
I don't know how to thank
you for this help.

1737
02:05:49,314 --> 02:05:51,282
You have come like god at the
most appropriate moment.

1738
02:05:51,394 --> 02:05:54,352
After <i>2</i> hour this god will drink here.
ls it 0k?

1739
02:05:54,353 --> 02:05:55,764
With pleasure sir!

1740
02:05:57,553 --> 02:05:58,554
Cheers!!!!

1741
02:06:00,753 --> 02:06:01,720
Sir

1742
02:06:01,794 --> 02:06:02,841
Yes

1743
02:06:03,953 --> 02:06:04,993
To be frank,

1744
02:06:04,994 --> 02:06:08,077
I did not like Preetam
when he came to our house.

1745
02:06:08,194 --> 02:06:10,196
He might be a close friend but,

1746
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:13,795
roaming & staying with girl
whose marriage is fixed,

1747
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:15,281
looked awkward.

1748
02:06:16,354 --> 02:06:18,402
But look at how destiny works?
came to my house

1749
02:06:20,433 --> 02:06:23,039
and you solved my
biggest problem.

1750
02:06:25,754 --> 02:06:27,722
Now shall I tell you a truth?

1751
02:06:27,834 --> 02:06:28,915
Say it Sir.

1752
02:06:32,194 --> 02:06:34,640
I came to your home
to ask for a favor

1753
02:06:37,233 --> 02:06:38,472
Preetham is my only child.

1754
02:06:38,473 --> 02:06:39,360
Preetham is my only child.

1755
02:06:40,273 --> 02:06:43,755
He is the heir for assets
worth hundred cores.

1756
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:47,677
I have not said no to
anything he has asked.

1757
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:53,155
My son Preetham loves
your daughter Nandhini.

1758
02:06:59,313 --> 02:07:01,361
Even Nandhini loves Preetham.

1759
02:07:02,234 --> 02:07:04,282
They have understood
each other pretty well.

1760
02:07:04,393 --> 02:07:08,193
If they marry, they will
lead a happy life together.

1761
02:07:08,433 --> 02:07:11,880
But this house will become
a burial ground Sir!

1762
02:07:13,713 --> 02:07:15,833
Sir, NandhinVs marriage
is notjust marriage.

1763
02:07:15,834 --> 02:07:18,280
It is repentance
for all my sins.

1764
02:07:19,034 --> 02:07:22,641
It is the bond that is binding
the broken blood ties.

1765
02:07:28,273 --> 02:07:30,002
My only beloved sister,

1766
02:07:31,273 --> 02:07:34,004
was in love with
my estate manager.

1767
02:07:34,473 --> 02:07:35,998
I did not like that.

1768
02:07:36,634 --> 02:07:38,602
So I tried to scare him away.

1769
02:07:40,873 --> 02:07:42,762
But he was as adamant as me.

1770
02:07:45,114 --> 02:07:46,843
One day he came to my house

1771
02:07:47,234 --> 02:07:50,433
& tried to take away my
sister in front of me.

1772
02:07:50,434 --> 02:07:52,641
I tried to scare
him with the rifle

1773
02:07:57,393 --> 02:07:58,360
In that chaos,

1774
02:08:00,474 --> 02:08:04,399
I accidentlyfired a bullet
&it pierced his heart.

1775
02:08:10,033 --> 02:08:12,354
Only after his death
did I realise,

1776
02:08:13,233 --> 02:08:15,156
that my sister was pregnant.

1777
02:08:16,433 --> 02:08:18,792
TMth the angst against me, my
sister left my house & went to his.

1778
02:08:18,793 --> 02:08:20,795
TMth the angst against me, my
sister left my house & went to his.

1779
02:08:21,434 --> 02:08:23,402
Even my mother went with her.

1780
02:08:26,513 --> 02:08:29,712
No matter how many times I
begged for forgiveness,

1781
02:08:29,713 --> 02:08:32,284
my mother & sister
never forgave me.

1782
02:08:35,113 --> 02:08:38,356
I continued to burn in
my guilt and repentance.

1783
02:08:44,314 --> 02:08:47,472
At last, only when I promised
my daughter to Siddharth,

1784
02:08:47,473 --> 02:08:49,555
my mother & sister forgave me.

1785
02:08:50,673 --> 02:08:52,675
My daughter does not
know about this.

1786
02:08:52,794 --> 02:08:54,444
I can understand your pain

1787
02:08:54,914 --> 02:08:58,113
But, won't this be an
injustice to Nandhini?

1788
02:08:58,114 --> 02:09:01,118
Before your son's arrival, Nandhini
had accepted the marriage.

1789
02:09:01,274 --> 02:09:04,198
Wouldn't it be injustice
to Siddharth now?

1790
02:09:06,353 --> 02:09:09,392
Iwill find a rich &
intelligent girl to Siddharth.

1791
02:09:09,393 --> 02:09:12,392
I will find an even better girl
than Nandhini for Preetham.

1792
02:09:12,393 --> 02:09:13,360
Is it 0k?

1793
02:09:13,474 --> 02:09:17,712
But Nandhini & Preethan are
abysmally deep in love Ponnappa

1794
02:09:17,713 --> 02:09:20,912
I had taken Siddharth's father
away from him before his birth.

1795
02:09:20,913 --> 02:09:22,358
Now I have given my word

1796
02:09:23,074 --> 02:09:25,153
&you want me to take
Nandhini away from him?

1797
02:09:25,154 --> 02:09:27,919
Should I loose my
mother&sister again?

1798
02:09:30,353 --> 02:09:33,118
You came as god 84
have helped me once.

1799
02:09:33,434 --> 02:09:39,282
Now I ask you again.
to this house after 26 years.

1800
02:09:39,753 --> 02:09:40,720
Please!

1801
02:09:40,794 --> 02:09:43,365
Please don't kill
our happiness Sir.

1802
02:10:37,154 --> 02:10:38,121
Ponnal!

1803
02:10:38,234 --> 02:10:39,474
Mother!!!!! Mom!!!

1804
02:10:42,353 --> 02:10:43,434
Lakshmi!!!

1805
02:10:44,514 --> 02:10:45,242
- Brother!!!

1806
02:11:24,034 --> 02:11:28,358
Forget Nandhini Preetham.

1807
02:11:29,314 --> 02:11:30,395
Dadlll!

1808
02:11:31,354 --> 02:11:35,075
Did you get emotional after
hearing Ponnapa's story?

1809
02:11:39,633 --> 02:11:40,873
Let's do a thing.

1810
02:11:41,754 --> 02:11:43,518
We will talk to Nandhini

1811
02:11:43,913 --> 02:11:45,278
&take her with us.

1812
02:11:47,034 --> 02:11:48,957
If we take Nandhini with us,

1813
02:11:49,193 --> 02:11:50,922
she will loose her family.

1814
02:11:52,393 --> 02:11:54,475
We will be the reason for that

1815
02:11:56,474 --> 02:11:58,553
Ponnapa's family, which is reuniting
because of this marriage,

1816
02:11:58,554 --> 02:11:59,476
will break again.

1817
02:12:00,393 --> 02:12:02,395
We will also be reason for that.

1818
02:12:02,513 --> 02:12:06,313
But Dad, my heart will break
if I don't get Nandhini,

1819
02:12:06,754 --> 02:12:08,677
Humanity is bigger than love.

1820
02:12:08,913 --> 02:12:10,881
No, no , no, I don't
know that Dad.

1821
02:12:10,993 --> 02:12:12,513
<i>Hustwanfliandwm'.!</i>

1822
02:12:12,514 --> 02:12:15,632
Dad, I don't believe in this
sacrifice bullshit and all dad.

1823
02:12:15,633 --> 02:12:20,473
Notjust you, even if my dead mother
comes back, I will not leave Nandhini

1824
02:12:20,474 --> 02:12:23,513
Preetu!!...No Dad. No.

1825
02:12:23,514 --> 02:12:25,516
I will not listen to anybody
in NandhinVs matter.

1826
02:12:28,354 --> 02:12:31,517
Dad, when it comes to being
obstinate, I am yourfather.

1827
02:12:31,633 --> 02:12:33,712
Even if you don't accept, I
will take Nandhini & go.

1828
02:12:33,713 --> 02:12:36,912
Yes!!! I am sure 84 I don't care
about anything or anybody.

1829
02:12:36,913 --> 02:12:39,883
There is no doubt about
leaving Nandhini.

1830
02:12:49,233 --> 02:12:50,598
Preetham, come in.

1831
02:12:59,874 --> 02:13:00,875
Hil!

1832
02:13:03,034 --> 02:13:06,356
Hey Bangalore boy, are you
enjoying Madikeri rain?

1833
02:13:09,233 --> 02:13:11,235
Uncle, Did you talk to my Dad?

1834
02:13:11,394 --> 02:13:13,473
Please talk to him soon Uncle.

1835
02:13:13,474 --> 02:13:15,442
Siddharth is arriving
tomorrow morning.

1836
02:13:17,393 --> 02:13:18,394
Yeah!! Sure.

1837
02:13:19,473 --> 02:13:21,555
You are marrying a
big American surgeon

1838
02:13:21,634 --> 02:13:23,398
Everything will be fine.

1839
02:13:23,714 --> 02:13:26,194
Uncle, teach him
some seriousness.

1840
02:13:26,914 --> 02:13:28,200
Iam serious Nandhini.

1841
02:13:31,074 --> 02:13:33,076
The thing you said near
the falls is true!

1842
02:13:33,154 --> 02:13:35,077
All this love 84 commitment

1843
02:13:36,354 --> 02:13:37,276
does not suit me.

1844
02:13:39,354 --> 02:13:43,154
Just 4 days after of your
acceptance of my proposal,

1845
02:13:44,674 --> 02:13:46,085
I was bored of you.

1846
02:13:52,113 --> 02:13:53,080
Do one thing.

1847
02:13:53,154 --> 02:13:54,041
Marry Siddharth

1848
02:13:56,154 --> 02:13:58,202
When you get bored, call
this temporary boyfriend.

1849
02:13:58,313 --> 02:14:01,999
We will go to some exotic
country, enjoy & comeback.

1850
02:14:07,554 --> 02:14:10,524
Even when I knew about
you, I trusted you.

1851
02:14:10,754 --> 02:14:13,519
I should hit myself
with my own slippers.

1852
02:14:15,034 --> 02:14:16,445
It is not your fault.

1853
02:14:17,114 --> 02:14:19,082
It is your father's
fault who supports you

1854
02:14:19,234 --> 02:14:20,645
even when you are wrong.

1855
02:14:26,434 --> 02:14:28,880
Never show me your
face ever again.

1856
02:15:07,234 --> 02:15:10,363
You have already finished one bottle.
Stop it.

1857
02:15:24,753 --> 02:15:25,720
What Happened?

1858
02:15:25,794 --> 02:15:29,515
A heavy landslide has blocked all roads.
Pleas return.

1859
02:15:35,113 --> 02:15:37,115
Preetham, where are you going?

1860
02:15:37,233 --> 02:15:38,314
- One minute

1861
02:15:43,514 --> 02:15:45,164
Preetu, Hey!! Preetu

1862
02:15:49,314 --> 02:15:53,558
Dad, looks like this road is
blocked from here to Rajasthan

1863
02:15:57,314 --> 02:15:58,315
RajasthanHF?

1864
02:15:59,394 --> 02:16:00,634
You know Nandhini

1865
02:16:01,553 --> 02:16:09,404
Desert, Camel, By 2 drink, rented
bike, ladies tablet, etc, etc...

1866
02:16:09,873 --> 02:16:11,477
Oh!! No

1867
02:16:11,953 --> 02:16:15,958
Now no Nandhini

1868
02:16:20,154 --> 02:16:23,237
Dad said no. I said no

1869
02:16:23,354 --> 02:16:26,873
That's all. Full 84 Final

1870
02:16:26,874 --> 02:16:31,874
Preetham, get down first

1871
02:16:33,794 --> 02:16:38,152
Dad, this is a new experience!

1872
02:16:38,153 --> 02:16:39,912
<i>Preetham loves new
experience</i> Dad.

1873
02:16:39,913 --> 02:16:42,519
<i>Preetham loves new
experience</i> Dad.

1874
02:16:43,194 --> 02:16:48,280
Till now it was falling in love.

1875
02:16:48,514 --> 02:16:50,516
But from today, failing in love.

1876
02:16:50,594 --> 02:16:51,675
Failing in love

1877
02:16:54,833 --> 02:16:55,720
Dad

1878
02:16:56,233 --> 02:17:02,115
I used to leave girls
when I got bored in love.

1879
02:17:02,594 --> 02:17:04,562
Now life itself is so boring.

1880
02:17:04,753 --> 02:17:07,074
What should I leave Dad?

1881
02:17:07,394 --> 02:17:08,520
What shall I leave?

1882
02:18:14,874 --> 02:18:15,921
Dad

1883
02:18:19,153 --> 02:18:20,200
Love you Dad

1884
02:18:21,274 --> 02:18:23,800
You are the best
Dad in the world

1885
02:18:27,674 --> 02:18:29,517
What type ofa son are you?

1886
02:18:29,873 --> 02:18:33,798
You are murmuring your father's
name for the first time.

1887
02:18:33,914 --> 02:18:37,123
That too on the day, when
he robbed you of your love!

1888
02:18:37,233 --> 02:18:38,394
Iam hurting you

1889
02:18:40,433 --> 02:18:43,482
&even in your dreams
you say I love you Dad.

1890
02:18:46,473 --> 02:18:49,158
You are the best son
in the world!!!

1891
02:18:49,673 --> 02:18:52,244
You are the best son
in the world!!!

1892
02:18:59,034 --> 02:19:00,035
Preetu!

1893
02:19:01,154 --> 02:19:07,355
I won't have enough guts to
apologise when you wake up.

1894
02:19:11,473 --> 02:19:12,474
Please!!!

1895
02:19:14,673 --> 02:19:16,004
Forgive me Preetham.

1896
02:19:17,873 --> 02:19:18,681
Forgive me.

1897
02:19:51,393 --> 02:19:52,440
Hey hi!!!

1898
02:19:53,993 --> 02:19:55,995
You are Nandhini Ponnappa right?

1899
02:19:56,073 --> 02:19:58,952
I vaguely remember you. But
you haven't changed a bit!

1900
02:19:58,953 --> 02:20:00,552
Height, weight, smile &
style, nothing has changed!

1901
02:20:00,553 --> 02:20:02,715
Height, weight, smile &
style, nothing has changed!

1902
02:20:03,313 --> 02:20:06,237
What is the secret of
your eternal beauty?

1903
02:20:08,353 --> 02:20:09,320
Oh!!! Correct!

1904
02:20:09,473 --> 02:20:11,123
Your smile is your secret!

1905
02:20:11,553 --> 02:20:13,476
But why have you come alone?

1906
02:20:13,673 --> 02:20:14,640
Where are uncle, aunt 84 mom?

1907
02:20:14,753 --> 02:20:18,883
They have gone to the city for shopping.
They will join us on the way.

1908
02:20:19,034 --> 02:20:20,035
Ok, Let's go

1909
02:20:33,353 --> 02:20:35,401
Go out on a vacation
for some days.

1910

Your mind will feel refreshed.

1911

Uncle, how is Nandhini?

02:26:27,953 --> 02:26:28,954
Dad

1947
02:26:30,113 --> 02:26:33,435
Shall I see Nandhini for
one last time & come back?

1948
02:26:35,194 --> 02:26:36,116
Yes, go.

1949
02:26:36,193 --> 02:26:38,560
Does love need such
crushing pain?

1950
02:26:43,433 --> 02:26:46,243
Is it necessary for
the heart to burn?

1951
02:26:50,993 --> 02:26:53,234
My life is tired being stubborn.

1952
02:26:55,194 --> 02:26:57,322
It is crying incessantly inside.

1953
02:26:59,233 --> 02:27:03,795
O rain, pourtorrentially and wipe
out what's written on my fate.

Both are close friends.

1969
02:28:34,234 --> 02:28:35,235
Preetham

1970
02:28:36,314 --> 02:28:37,281
Nandhini,

1971
02:28:38,273 --> 02:28:40,196

02:28:41,434 --> 02:28:42,435

Preethaml!

1975
02:28:48,713 --> 02:28:50,556
Nandhini control yourself

1976
02:28:50,833 --> 02:28:51,800
What happenedl]

1977
02:28:51,913 --> 02:28:52,953
Why are you acting like this?

1978
02:28:52,954 --> 02:28:56,242
It is not her you should
be asking the question?

1979
02:28:57,193 --> 02:28:58,194
Ask your uncle.

1980
02:29:03,354 --> 02:29:05,675
You cannot bury the
truth brother.

1981
02:29:06,554 --> 02:29:07,601
Speak it out.

1982
02:29:41,473 --> 02:29:44,397
If Preetham's father
had decided otherwise,

1983
02:29:44,553 --> 02:29:48,683
none of us could have stopped
Nandhin 84 Preetham from uniting.

1984
02:29:48,833 --> 02:29:49,834
But,

1985
02:29:50,913 --> 02:29:53,962
he sacrificed his happiness
for our family's!

1986
02:29:57,033 --> 02:29:58,876
Isn't that true love brother?

1987
02:30:00,113 --> 02:30:07,122
I don't want Nandhini to suffer like
I have been suffering my whole life.

1988
02:30:43,873 --> 02:30:49,164
Sir, both you and your son have proved
that love can be won by love alone.

1989
02:30:50,273 --> 02:30:54,915
Notjust that, you have made it clear
that my doubt was indeed true.

1990
02:30:58,554 --> 02:31:01,000
Tomorrow is our
marriage anniversary

1991
02:31:01,754 --> 02:31:03,961
I don't know how a year passed!

1992
02:31:05,993 --> 02:31:06,721

1993
02:31:07,793 --> 02:31:11,639
I don't know how I got bored
of you in just one year.

1994
02:31:13,114 --> 02:31:14,161
<i>So...</i>

1995
02:31:18,433 --> 02:31:21,721

Why did you give
me a missed call?

2005
02:32:16,794 --> 02:32:18,717
I haven't brought my mobile.

2006
02:32:19,994 --> 02:32:22,998
I thought of giving a
shock on our anniversary

2007
02:32:23,953 --> 02:32:26,001
But you gave me bigger shocld!

2008
02:32:27,153 --> 02:32:29,884
Someday I might get
bored of myself, but

2009
02:32:31,393 --> 02:32:33,919
I will never be bored
of you Nandhini.

2010
02:32:34,473 --> 02:32:35,474
I love you.
