'We are proud of our country.'

00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,219
'We are proud! '

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,432
'We will live in victory
 and die in victory.'

00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,643
'O Country, we will decorate
 your character.'

00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:07,401
'Come, we will guard
 you against evil.'

00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:22,124
'Every drop of my blood
 is for guarding you.'

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,424
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

9
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:19,223
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

10
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,769
Hang Arjun!
 - Hang him! Hang him!

11
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,731
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

12
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:32,277
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

13
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,346
Hang Arjun!
 - Hang him! Hang him!

14
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,599
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,727
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

16
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,605
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
 - He is a murderer!

17
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:13,277
Hang him! Hang him!

18
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,842
Hang Arjun!
 - Hang him! Hang him!

19
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,727
This is ACP Arjun Ranawat.

20
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,812
He barged into the prime
 minister's farm house...

21
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,856
...on the night of 1st November and...

22
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,943
...brutally killed the
 deputy prime minister...

23
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,322
...Badrinath Trivedi, his
 son, Munna Trivedi...

24
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:45,327
...the police commissioner
 Yeshwant's son, Chandrakant...

25
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,332
...Desphande, police inspector
 Avasthi, advocate Kulkarni...

26
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,751
...the six MLAs of the reigning
 political party...

27
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,921
...and counting some government
 and police...

28
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:01,593
...officers, all in all,
 eighteen people.

29
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:14,690
He isn't the guardian of law,
 but the abuser of law.

30
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,734
With this cold blooded massacre,
 not only...

31
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,404
...has he put a blot on the face of...

32
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,532
...the government and police,
 but even humanity.

33
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,576
These are some of the photographs...

34
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:30,914
...taken from the scene
 of crime, your honor.

35
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,090
The police requests the accused...

36
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,760
...to be kept in remand
 to investigate...

37
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,725
...this brutal massacre and the
 reason behind for fifteen days.

38
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:58,734
Do you want to say anything
 about these accusations?

39
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,444
No.

40
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,364
Do you have any lawyer?
 - No.

41
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,828
Would you wish the court to
 appoint a lawyer for you?

42
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,997
No.

43
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,082
The government has accused you...

44
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,754
...of killing eighteen
 innocent civilians.

45
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:23,759
It has asked a remand of fifteen
 days for investigation.

46
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,429
Do you want anything
 during this time?

47
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,474
Do you have the need of anything?

48
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,728
Yes, I do.
 - What is it? - Death.

49
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,535
The accused is put into
 police custody...

50
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:54,873
...for the period of fifteen
 days in remand.

51
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,544
Saying that he was perfectly sane...

52
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,546
...Ranawat says that
 he has committed...

53
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,507
...this massacre in his total sanity.

54
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:07,719
When the judge asked him whether
 he needed anything.

55
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,808
He answered what he
 had before, death.

56
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,816
Is this the charge sheet
 that you've prepared?

57
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,738
Is this it? Just a murderer?
 He isn't a murderer!

58
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,658
He is a demon!

59
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,996
Look at this! Look at this!

60
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,081
He snatched my brother, my son...

61
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,125
...and son-in-law from me! He wiped...

62
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,585
...the vermilion from the foreheads...

63
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,921
...of my daughter-in-law
 and my daughter.

64
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,256
He even ate up your son, isn't it?

65
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,885
Are you not sorrowful about that?

66
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:34,097
He didn't leave anyone to set
 fire to our funeral pyre.

67
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:39,228
He vanquished our line!
 Our lifeline!

68
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,231
Listen to me, lawyer.

69
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,941
Bad character.

70
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,068
Corruption.

71
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,986
Bad thoughts.

72
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,948
Betrayal of the country.
 Even till that extent!

73
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:56,662
Accuse him of every crime
 written in your law book.

74
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:01,625
Put all the sections
 of your law on him!

75
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,834
Open him up.

76
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,842
Sign these documents.

77
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,871
You have killed my only son.

78
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,248
Till the time the court
 doesn't punish you...

79
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,836
...I will give you a new death
 every day in this prison.

80
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,757
He hasn't signed on these documents.

81
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:37,930
He has given his life in death's
 hands. Please come.

82
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,798
Son.

83
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,926
Why did you put your weapons
 down in the court today?

84
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:20,055
Why don't you tell the world
 why you massacred them?

85
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,935
Why are you asking death
 for yourself, son?

86
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,771
Why are you doing it?

87
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,401
Because I performed my last rites.

88
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:40,117
I wish freedom from my
 body and this birth.

89
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,121
Mother.

90
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,874
From today. You and Rakhi, both.

91
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,960
Please don't come to meet me here.

92
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,881
Because in the Hindu religion,
 mothers and sisters...

93
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:58,886
...don't visit the funerals
 and cemeteries.

94
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,266
I'll leave now, mother.

95
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:08,312
This was our companionship
 in this birth.

96
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:14,735
I will be back. Tell your
 God to borne me...

97
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:21,992
...from your womb the next time too.

98
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,847
Respected Mr. Samar Singh.

99
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:49,353
My final greetings to you
 and your principles.

100
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,940
I have walked away from
 your principles...

101
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,027
...this uniform and
 this police force.

102
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,112
I have a final request of you, sir.

103
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:05,202
Please don't say that 'Truth
 Prevails.' ever again.

104
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:10,791
Because the truth is that
 in this eunuch society...

105
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,962
...lies...

106
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,841
...Unlawfulness...

107
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,885
...and injustice is
 victorious always.

108
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,012
I want to tell you, sir.

109
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:29,601
We soldiers are not just
 government machinery.

110
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,236
Outside the police station,
 even we have a life.

111
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:44,032
We don't know where we lost it
 walking on your given path.

112
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,228
So you are here still. You
 haven't gone to the temple.

113
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,272
Didn't I tell you, son?
 - Mother.

114
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,066
What will I do going to the temple?

115
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,110
You have looked after your
 body for too long now.

116
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,198
Come and look at God now too, son.

117
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,451
You want me to go to the
 temple and pray to God?

118
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,996
Yes. I'll be very grateful to you.

119
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:36,335
Where are you taking me?
 - Come here. Sit down.

120
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,172
'Hail the Goddess Jadgamde,
 Hail Goddess Durga.'

121
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,507
'Hail Goddess Kali, Hail
 Goddess Saraswati.'

122
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,008
You crazy boy, what are you doing?

123
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:48,514
Don't you see, mother?
 I am praying to my God.

124
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,142
Someone has said the truth.

125
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,604
Because God can't be everywhere
 at one time...

126
00:14:55,604 --> 00:15:00,025
...therefore, he created the mother.

127
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,530
Mother, you are my temple
 and everyone.

128
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,990
Are you crazy?

129
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,743
A mortal man is not
 compared to God, son.

130
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,286
Is it so?

131
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,330
Do you remember the
 '84 riots, mother?

132
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,085
When a child was crying
 over his dead parents?

133
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,297
God hadn't come at that time,
 you had, mother.

134
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,134
My real mother had just borne me.

135
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,597
You have given me life though.
 My being is because of you.

136
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,310
Only due to you, mother.

137
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,648
I gave birth to Rakhi. But you
 are the piece of my heart.

138
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,570
I didn't ask anything
 after getting you.

139
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,531
Why are you lying, mother?

140
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,575
You pray for brother's well being...

141
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,660
...from morning to evening,
 and yet you say that...

142
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,498
...you don't ask anything from God?

143
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,210
Rakhi, keep quiet. You are jealous.

144
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,547
Because mother loves me more.

145
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:08,093
What? I am jealous of you?

146
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,220
Oh God!

147
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,515
She has come in the
 mood for fighting.

148
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,060
I haven't come to fight.
 I have come to tell you...

149
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,229
...that I am going to college
 and I have taken...

150
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,024
...one thousand rupees
 from your wallet.

151
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,735
Did you see that, mother? Loot
 in a policeman's house.

152
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:28,030
I didn't loot anyone. I have
 taken what is my right.

153
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,074
I have laid out your breakfast.

154
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,160
When you mother and son will...

155
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,245
...complete your tearful reunion...

156
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,541
...please eat it, I will be very
 grateful. I will leave now.

157
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,420
Did you see that, mother?
 Rakhi has grown up.

158
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,758
Yes, son. When the
 daughter grows up...

159
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,885
...a mother has got more
 responsibilities on her breast.

160
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,803
What are you talking about, mother?

161
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,639
Does a cow ever feel that
 her horns are heavy?

162
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,600
You worry about Rakhi's
 marriage, isn't it?

163
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,644
Yes.
 - Don't worry.

164
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:02,105
Your son will marry his
 sister with such pomp...

165
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:08,070
...and splendor, the whole
 world will be stunned.

166
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,411
Greetings, brother!

167
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:23,627
A hero won't be so famous
 as Hakim Lukkha is! - C'mon!

168
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:28,090
What is the hurry, sir?
 I am human too.

169
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,134
Why are you dragging
 me like a beast?

170
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,803
Sir, will I get a fag?

171
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,763
Shut up and walk, you wretch.

172
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,140
Let the judge give you in
 police custody once...

173
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,811
...I will give you nice cigarettes
 in the lock up after that.

174
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:45,148
That will be decided with
 the judge's decision.

175
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,152
When these police
 men were accusing...

176
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,530
...Hakim Lukkha of cutting off the...

177
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,199
...prostitute's nose
 and ears, he wasn't...

178
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:59,830
...in Mumbai city forget
 about Grant Road.

179
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,832
He had gone to Lucknow.

180
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,878
For the party's work.

181
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:11,175
This is the proof of the
 police's wretchedness.

182
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,427
This is the air ticket to Lucknow.

183
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,848
This is the register of
 the Lucknow Guest house...

184
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,184
And your honor, this
 is the manager...

185
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:24,688
...of that Lucknow Guest house.

186
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,818
This lawyer is lying!
 Hakim Lukkha is a pimp.

187
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,322
He whores innocent girls.

188
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:37,326
Did you hear that? Did
 you hear that, mi lord?

189
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,204
This is the respected police
 of our Mumbai city.

190
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:44,666
It is abusing people standing
 in the court.

191
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:50,130
If you use any abusive and vulgar
 language in this court...

192
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,302
...the next time, you
 will be suspended.

193
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:00,307
This time, I warn you and leave.

194
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,392
Please don't waste
 the court's time...

195
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:06,396
...by bringing such matters in court.

196
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,527
The accused is released honorably.

197
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,574
I've told you a thousand times.

198
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,493
Be respectful in the court.

199
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,578
They are ripping our shirts apart.

200
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:26,333
And you say that we
 should respect them?

201
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,878
Didn't you lose your pants
 in the court, Mr. Arjun?

202
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:34,550
I had said it. I had announced it.

203
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,387
That this time too Hakim
 Lukkha will be released.

204
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:42,391
What did you do?

205
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,726
Actually, sir.

206
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,437
An enmity with me is
 dangerous for you.

207
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,692
And dangerous for your sister too.

208
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,906
I have heard that your sister
 is very beautiful, sir.

209
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,952
No, Arjun!

210
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,678
Wait, Arjun!

211
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,700
I tell you, leave him!

212
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,664
Come to your senses! Are you mad?

213
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,584
Hey, Kulkarni, take this pimp away!

214
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,669
Hey, explain it to your hero!

215
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,172
These wrestling antics of his
 will be very expensive for him!

216
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,675
I will have his uniform snatched!

217
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,930
You will have my uniform
 snatched? Come on.

218
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,642
Hey, take him away.
 - I am going.

219
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,685
But explain to this hero.

220
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:14,024
The lawyer says that
 the enmity will prove very costly.

221
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:46,056
Enough, Arjun. It is enough.

222
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:50,394
What is enough? You always stop me.

223
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,980
That bastard son of
 a bitch Hakim Lukkha...

224
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,816
...spat on our face and we
 couldn't do anything.

225
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,569
And you tell me to stop it?

226
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,697
See this, do you see this?

227
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,701
The government has dangled
 a gun on our waist.

228
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,704
But we can't use it.

229
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:13,876
And those rascals shoot in
 the middle of the road.

230
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:19,006
And what do we do? What do we do?

231
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,760
We just take those pimps in
 the magistrate's presence.

232
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,725
That Kulkarni comes
 and releases them.

233
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:35,606
And what do we do? We hold this
 in our hands and stand.

234
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,236
Get up.

235
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,823
That pimp is not worth
 irritating your brains.

236
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:48,911
You go, I will come.
 - Yes, why will you come?

237
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,788
It is time for your heaven to come.

238
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,874
You have started it all over again?
 - You rascal.

239
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,542
Why are you shy of bringing
 to your lips...

240
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,461
...what exists in your heart already?

241
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,130
She has expressed her
 love a lakh of times.

242
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,132
And you...

243
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,467
Please go.

244
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,093
I'll go.

245
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,471
It is bad to suggest anyone
 anything nowadays.

246
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:12,726
And listen, don't drink a lot.
 You will be driving.

247
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,753
'Beloved, my beloved.'

248
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,606
'I am cream and cheese,
 I have come from Delhi.'

249
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:05,529
'I have brought some dessert
 too, please taste it.'

250
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:13,036
'I am Champa, I am Chameli,
 and I am alone.'

251
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:19,042
'I have brought mischief too,
 please taste it,'

252
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:40,564
'My fiery body, my fair
 body, my body burns.'

253
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,610
'It is my youth, this
 world is crazy.'

254
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:50,282
'You be crazy too! Be crazy too! '

255
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:55,681
'I have come on the
 command of my heart.'

256
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,182
'I have come on demand.'

257
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:02,020
'Please come, please come,
 loot my beauty and youth.'

258
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:13,532
'This is my miracle!
 This is my miracle! '

259
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:21,039
'My goods are for free!
 Take some symbols! '

260
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:41,828
'The dress irritates me, it
 tortures me, what do I do? '

261
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:59,888
'Take me in your arms! Take
 me in your arms tightly! '

262
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,057
'Taste it a bit.'

263
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:06,311
'Take a bit of my youth too! '

264
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:27,666
'Beloved, I fall at your feet! '

265
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:28,227
Jannat, did your lover give you
 a flying kiss today too?

266
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,188
Thank you for your sympathy.

267
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:35,317
Jannat, all rich people
 are at your feet.

268
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,569
And you are dying for a policeman?

269
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:41,532
What does he have?

270
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,327
You won't understand, my dear.

271
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:50,415
Rich and generous people
 are found in this bar.

272
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,877
But I can see only lust and hunger...

273
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:58,841
...in the eyes of every man here.

274
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:01,009
But Arjun.

275
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,389
I see respect and conscience
 in Arjun's eyes.

276
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:10,227
You crazy girl, till when will
 you wait for him like this?

277
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,020
For my whole life.

278
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,191
And if that is less, I will
 give my next life to him too.

279
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:21,405
This ring that I wear in my neck.

280
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,908
Only Arjun will make me wear this.

281
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:29,288
She won't understand.

282
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:33,352
Did you recognize me?

283
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:44,154
What are you staring at me?

284
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:49,368
She is so good!

285
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,039
She is a virgin! A virgin.

286
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,129
I have so many good
 girls like these.

287
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:05,634
If you ask me, I will give
 you a new one every day.

288
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:10,597
You will just have to speak
 to me with respect, okay.

289
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,644
Respectable people are
 spoken to with respect.

290
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:20,190
Not with pimps.

291
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:28,365
Who do you call a pimp?

292
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,204
See this street.

293
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,248
It is all alone.

294
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:39,209
Neither a man nor mankind.

295
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:42,629
Look here too. Look.

296
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:46,049
You can't see anyone till afar.

297
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,179
If I kill you here
 right now, nobody...

298
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:54,725
...will get any proof or any witness.

299
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,522
That who killed the
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.

300
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,692
There will only be your photo
 in the newspaper tomorrow.

301
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:08,447
And your sister will be
 in my jeep from tomorrow.

302
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,577
I will leave now.

303
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,704
Think about what I told you.

304
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:24,338
Work for me. Or else,
 an unknown death.

305
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:36,183
He is correct. A Lonely street,
 unknown death.

306
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:41,813
What if I kill him here?

307
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,595
Yes, tell me. What do
 you want to tell me?

308
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:17,599
Thanks for the suggestion.

309
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,478
Suggestion?

310
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:40,390
Look at this, a Lonely street.

311
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:45,437
Look at this. Neither
 man, nor mankind.

312
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,877
And tomorrow in the newspapers...

313
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:12,381
...it won't be my news but yours.

314
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:16,385
An unknown death.

315
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,267
No!

316
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,272
No!

317
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,336
The Mumbai city and the government...

318
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,423
...has been shaken by your
 misdoings yesterday night.

319
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:58,468
Your murdering spree has
 blotted the police force.

320
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,305
Look at this. Look at
 this and look at this.

321
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,348
Someone is calling us
 a uniformed hooligan.

322
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:06,560
Someone is calling us
 a uniformed devil.

323
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,645
You will have to reap
 it's punishment.

324
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,314
Write on that paper.

325
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:14,568
You lost your sanity in
 anger and murdered them.

326
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,279
I didn't do this massacre
 in anger or insanity.

327
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:21,450
I did this in self-defense.

328
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,331
A man doesn't break a person's...

329
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:30,667
...seventeen bones in an
 act of self defense.

330
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,711
He doesn't make him
 lay on his back...

331
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,464
...and empties the whole
 magazine of his gun.

332
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:36,590
This is...

333
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,468
This is the autopsy report.

334
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:43,805
Have you not read
 the procedure code?

335
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:47,309
You should warn a criminal first.

336
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:50,854
Then in the air and later on
 the legs, bullets are shot.

337
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:56,527
And then, you could inform
 the control room too.

338
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,570
I committed a huge mistake.

339
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,531
When his revolver was below my ear...

340
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:03,033
...and he was about to
 press the trigger...

341
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,078
...I should have called
 up the control room.

342
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,372
Then I should have fired
 in the air once.

343
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:13,335
After that, I should have
 fired at his legs.

344
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:17,506
I committed such a huge mistake.

345
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,008
That wretch was talking about...

346
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,052
...killing me and making my sister...

347
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,847
...sit in an courtesan hall.
 At that time...

348
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,890
...I should have told him,
 'Brother, please wait.'

349
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,393
It is a crime to kill
 a police officer...

350
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:33,438
...and make his sister sit
 in an courtesan hall.

351
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,899
I am sorry sir.

352
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,985
But if I had walked on your path...

353
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,070
...my name wouldn't be written here...

354
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,905
...but outside in the
 police station...

355
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,074
...in the list of people
 dead on duty.

356
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:46,535
And you wouldn't be shouting here.

357
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:50,706
You would be shedding tears
 on my bullet-ridden body.

358
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:51,957
Wrapping it in an Indian tricolor...

359
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:55,919
...flag and playing the bugle.

360
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,756
There is a limit to insolence
 and shamelessness.

361
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:06,054
I say, we should declare him
 a killer and set an example.

362
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,935
If you want to clean the good for...

363
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,979
...nothing and useless image
 of the police force with...

364
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:18,400
...the blood of an upright police
 officer, you are welcome.

365
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,529
Nobody has any proof that
 I did these killings.

366
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:27,534
Neither you, you or you were
 present at the incident site.

367
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:35,959
You can only declare me
 a killer, not prove me.

368
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:40,589
And I won't say this, my lawyer
 in court will say this.

369
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:44,718
And nobody will have
 any answer to this.

370
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:54,019
This Hakim Lukkha had
 28 cases against him.

371
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,480
He had started thinking
 the police station...

372
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,565
...to be his house, his house
 to be his whore house...

373
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:01,818
...and a police officer
 like me to be his pimp.

374
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,906
What had he done to him?

375
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,536
In twelve years of this
 police service...

376
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:15,666
...I have died at their
 hands a thousand times.

377
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,836
I had just two ways out.

378
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:23,966
Either I would live on Lukkha's
 throw outs and sell law.

379
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,553
Or else, I'd put down this uniform...

380
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:33,725
...and tolerate everything
 like an eunuch.

381
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:42,693
I refused to be a pimp or a eunuch.

382
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:46,780
Sir, if these criminals
 can be released...

383
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,616
...by the courts and move around
 like innocent civilians...

384
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:56,498
Then why can't I kill
 them and move...

385
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:01,628
...like a innocent civilian?
 Why? Why?

386
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,677
Do you want to say anything else?

387
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,900
He is saying the truth, sir.

388
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,654
But sadly, what can be done?

389
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:31,909
That's what we will have
 to think, Jadhav.

390
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:37,915
What we have to do in
 such a situation.

391
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:49,635
No, sir. Punishing Arjun is not
 an answer to this problem.

392
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:54,389
What is the answer to this problem?

393
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,686
We won't catch them in an clash.

394
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:05,108
We will kill them, we
 will encounter them.

395
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:10,697
When the criminals will see
 us terror on their heads...

396
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,117
...they will see only two
 ways for themselves.

397
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:18,830
Give up or death.

398
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:28,674
And only then will the dream of
 a crime free country be true.

399
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,219
Are you ready for this?

400
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,973
You start the Crime Control Squad.

401
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:40,352
Our government is with you.

402
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:12,676
The police! Run!
 - Shaheen! Take the weapons out!

403
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,300
It is too much now.

404
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,721
The Mumbai police which would
 piss just hearing your name...

405
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:42,808
...that same police has
 killed twenty seven...

406
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,977
...of our boys within thirteen days.

407
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,478
Yes, brother.

408
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,438
This Mumbai Police has
 shaken up this...

409
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,774
...same Mumbai city which we ruled...

410
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:53,777
...sitting here for
 twenty five years.

411
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:56,780
The police has become
 death in today's date.

412
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,324
It doesn't arrest or
 ask to surrender.

413
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:02,035
That commissioner tells
 to kill directly.

414
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,788
That CM has their
 hand on the police.

415
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,457
Therefore the lowliest
 of the officer...

416
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:10,752
...laughs in the face
 of Zafar Supari.

417
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,297
I'll tell you brother.
 Just say the word.

418
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:17,426
I will go and blast that
 commissioner's head right away.

419
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:21,722
I will show the Mumbai police
 not to touch a live snake.

420
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:39,531
Call that opposition
 leader Kashi Trivedi.

421
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,867
Tell him to create a hullabaloo by...

422
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:45,996
...branding the police
 the murderers...

423
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:52,002
...of Dalits, minorities and
 innocents in the Upper house.

424
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,844
Through the accusations
 of fake encounters...

425
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:05,724
...in the press, make life difficult
 for the policemen.

426
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,105
Shake the chair of that CM.

427
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,360
I will show this CM
 and commissioner.

428
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,821
The government on which
 they jump so high...

429
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:26,119
...is worked by this Zafar Supari
 sitting in an foreign country.

430
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,878
Down with the heartless government.
 Down with the uniformed hooligans!

431
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,101
If you want to create
 a hullabaloo here too...

432
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:53,230
...just like the upper house, what is
 the meaning of this meeting?

433
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,274
What is your problem after all?

434
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:59,069
I don't have a problem,
 I have a question.

435
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,071
Till when will this
 police of yours...

436
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:05,868
...play a blood bath on the
 streets of the city?

437
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:10,998
Till the time that the last of this
 city's gangster isn't dead.

438
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:14,918
Till the time we don't achieve
 the objective of a crime free...

439
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:18,213
...state, till that time,
 - Oh, Mr. Chief minister...

440
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:21,008
...please explain it to your
 crazy commissioner.

441
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:24,887
To stop shedding the blood
 of Dalits and minorities.

442
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:30,017
Politicians like you shed blood.

443
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,062
Not the police.

444
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,106
Who created fights in the
 country in the name of...

445
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:39,067
...temples and mosques? You did it.

446
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,236
The Brahmins against
 Yadavs in Bihar.

447
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:43,447
The Thakurs against Dalits in UP.

448
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:45,949
And the Muslims against
 Hindus in Gujarat.

449
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:49,912
Who did all this? You did it.

450
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,998
It is leaders like you
 who make a brother...

451
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:56,001
...kill his brother and
 then warm the bread...

452
00:47:56,001 --> 00:48:00,380
...of rule over their funeral pyres.

453
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,927
Human right's violator!

454
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,890
You are accusing me? Me!

455
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,353
I will topple Satyanarayan's
 government in a snap.

456
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:19,399
I will topple your chair,
 understood?

457
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:24,279
I will make you a constable
 from a commissioner.

458
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:30,118
Whose human rights are
 you speaking about?

459
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:34,289
Those hooligans, who don't
 humans to be humans?

460
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:37,292
Those who shoot at innocent people?

461
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:42,506
Who make their wives widows
 and children orphans?

462
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,968
Are you praying for
 their human rights?

463
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:48,178
They aren't humans.

464
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:53,058
How can we have human
 consideration for them?

465
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,065
They just understand
 one tongue. This one.

466
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,526
Shut up!

467
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:07,114
You are jumping on their
 strength, isn't it?

468
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:10,284
This chief minister's
 days are in air now.

469
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,369
I will transfer this commissioner
 as soon...

470
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,413
...as I become the chief minister.

471
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,039
And about you.

472
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,042
If I don't make you
 salute me everyday...

473
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,045
...my name won't be Kashi Trivedi!

474
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:26,758
Then listen to what I
 say too, Kashi Trivedi.

475
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:30,137
The day that I get some
 proof about you.

476
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:33,056
You won't be sitting on
 the chief minister's...

477
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:37,352
...chair but on your funeral pyre.

478
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:42,691
And I promise you.

479
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:47,779
You won't even get one man
 to shoulder your funeral.

480
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,800
You have made this city a Gestapo.

481
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,803
You have colored the streets
 of this city with blood.

482
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:14,473
What do you have to say about this?
 - Is this not the death of democracy?

483
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,808
How long will you kill in
 the name of humanity?

484
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,393
What is the difference between
 police and hooligans?

485
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:22,814
Is this encounter your
 helplessness of greed?

486
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:27,653
What is the need of murdering
 in the name of encounters?

487
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,282
It is necessary. There
 is a necessary.

488
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,326
What do you think?

489
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,411
When we go to arrest them, do the...

490
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:41,458
...criminals wait with
 garlands for us?

491
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,709
No!

492
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:47,130
They welcome us with a spray of
 bullets and dangerous weapons.

493
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,260
It is our moral right to shoot
 in self-defense at that time.

494
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:55,305
It is our democratic right.

495
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:59,476
Do only criminals and terrorists
 have human rights?

496
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:03,438
Does a soldier not have
 any human rights?

497
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:09,403
Are we soldiers not human?

498
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,492
Zafar Supari has threatened
 to kill...

499
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:19,872
...every person in the
 encounter squad.

500
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:25,210
He has made a hit list of
 the entire encounter squad.

501
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,192
What will that pimp make a hit list?

502
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,277
We have made an hit list.

503
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,864
Look at this.

504
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,283
Do you look at this red marks?

505
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,535
These are with God today.

506
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:03,332
The rest, will be soon.

507
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:07,503
Take this hit list. Print it
 in your newspaper tomorrow.

508
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,214
The next time Zafar
 Supari gives you...

509
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,717
...and interview tell him that we...

510
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:20,599
...have started cutting his
 name from the ration cards.

511
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,009
I have come to drop you till home.

512
00:52:56,009 --> 00:53:01,014
Won't you call me in? I mean,
 tea or something?

513
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,769
Yes, I am your lover, I love you.

514
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:09,231
I have that much right at least.

515
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:12,568
Okay. So come in, Mr. Vivek
 Acharya. Please come in.

516
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,279
You will be made to drink
 tea and with that...

517
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:19,241
...you will be introduced
 to my brother too.

518
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:23,287
Brother is at home...
 I mean, is he home?

519
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:25,956
He is a policeman.
 When he's at home...

520
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:28,000
...when he is in the station,
 when he...

521
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,085
...goes to do someone's encounter...

522
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,338
...even the almighty
 doesn't know that.

523
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:38,343
Okay, Miss Rekha, I mean,
 Miss Rakhi, I will leave.

524
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,513
Why? Don't you want
 any tea or something?

525
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:42,681
Tea?

526
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,975
I won't even be able
 to drink water now.

527
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:49,646
Why? Aren't you scared of brother?

528
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:53,650
Scared? The whole city is
 afraid of your brother.

529
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,822
He speaks less with his mouth
 and more with his gun.

530
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:01,325
You fool!

531
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:06,288
If you don't meet brother, how
 will you ask me for your hand?

532
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:10,876
That is your responsibility.

533
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,631
I will talk to my brother.

534
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,008
But when will you talk to your dad?

535
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:22,763
Leave him to me. Once that
 our marriage case...

536
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:27,351
...reaches in his court, his
 decision will be in our side.

537
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,709
Brother...

538
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:55,087
There is a boy.

539
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:58,382
He studies in your college.

540
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:01,927
The son of Justice Acharya.

541
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:05,347
The two of you love each other.

542
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:09,518
How do you know that, brother?

543
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:14,022
I am a policeman, not a milkman.

544
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:16,066
I keep an eye on the whole city.

545
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:20,404
Won't I know whom my sister
 meets where and when?

546
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:24,116
Do you take me for a fool?

547
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:30,038
Do you love him?
 - No.

548
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:32,708
Yes.

549
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:36,420
Look at me.

550
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,716
Really, brother?

551
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,554
I will talk to his father.

552
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:49,641
It is a matter of pride
 to make your sister...

553
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:55,522
...a daughter-in-law of my house.

554
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,443
But...

555
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:03,363
Remember that we are
 from the boy's side.

556
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:07,951
We have some conditions.

557
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:13,707
This engagement will
 take place tomorrow.

558
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:16,793
Tomorrow?

559
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:21,757
But we need some time
 for arrangements.

560
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:24,760
The engagement should
 take place tomorrow.

561
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,137
But sir...

562
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,097
You are not in a hurry,
 I am in an hurry though.

563
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:31,642
If your sister changes
 her mind tomorrow...

564
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:34,478
...my son won't get such
 a good wife and I won't...

565
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:39,775
...get such a good daughter-in-law
 anywhere else.

566
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:49,493
Therefore, the engagement
 will be done here tomorrow.

567
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,554
'She is so beautiful, she
 seems to be my heart.'

568
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:28,532
'Lf she just opens her eyes
 the heart sputters.'

569
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:34,204
'The lips say that she
 seems to be my life! '

570
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:37,059
'The eyes.'

571
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,937
'Your eyes.'

572
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:44,525
'Your bindiya... '

573
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,611
'Bangles.' 'Your bangles! '

574
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:53,158
'It decorates so well! ' 'Earrings! '

575
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:56,245
'Your earrings! '

576
00:58:56,245 --> 00:59:01,500
'Even the moon will shy away
 looking at your face.'

577
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:06,505
'The star's hearts will break.'

578
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:08,025
'Dreams! '

579
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:10,402
'Your dreams.'

580
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:13,739
'Keep it.'

581
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,741
'Keep it well.'

582
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:19,036
'O dear! '

583
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:26,210
'Your beloved looks so cute! '

584
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:32,007
'You got the procession, I
 will go in the procession.'

585
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:37,179
'I will go from the house
 but not from the heart.'

586
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,592
Sir, your informer no.
 555 wants to meet you.

587
01:01:56,592 --> 01:02:00,262
Send him in.
 - Right sir.

588
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:07,436
Salutations sir.

589
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:10,522
Come in.

590
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,152
Yes, tell me. What news
 have you brought?

591
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:19,031
Sir, I have definite news.

592
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:23,785
That Zafar Supari... he
 has given a contract...

593
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:28,957
...to kill the commissioner.

594
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:33,879
And Zafar Supari's main hit-man...

595
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,882
...is that Pappu Kalia.

596
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:42,012
He has a master plan, sir.

597
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:46,058
And to succeed in his contract,
 he's going to meet...

598
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:51,980
...4 to 5 shooters at the 'Can
 Can' nightclub, tonight.

599
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:57,027
Okay, you can go.

600
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,155
Goodbye sir.

601
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:24,137
'Oh darling! '

602
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:07,347
'The beauty is wearing
 a blouse of flames.'

603
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:19,526
'And yet love has not aroused yet.'

604
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:25,365
'You have robbed me, my beloved.'

605
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:28,076
'I've drowned in the sea of love.'

606
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:30,954
'I won't regret even if I die.'

607
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,332
'I'll be reborn just for you.'

608
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:36,251
'My heart is restless, it
 only wishes for you.'

609
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:38,629
'I don't know what may happen.'

610
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:44,259
'Oh darling! '

611
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,174
'My heart burns and
 its smoke rises.'

612
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:26,301
'When will you know that, my love? '

613
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,345
'Lf the pain rises or
 I loose my sense.'

614
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:30,013
'Even then I gave my
 heart only to you.'

615
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:32,015
'I consumed the poison, I
 swallowed the pain.'

616
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,559
'Even then I didn't take your name.'

617
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:39,523
'I have decided that I'll do
 what I have never done yet.'

618
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,239
'I consumed the poison, I
 swallowed the pain.'

619
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,074
'Even then I didn't take your name.'

620
01:05:49,074 --> 01:06:00,419
'I have decided that I'll do
 what I have never done yet.'

621
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:04,506
'My life belongs to my love, but
 my love is not aware of it.'

622
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:10,512
'I don't know what may happen.'

623
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:58,310
'I have no other wish in
 my heart except you.'

624
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,064
'Your lover is yearning while
 you have fun and frolic.'

625
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:06,068
'You are the God of my love and
 I'm thirsty for your love.'

626
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:12,074
'I see the divine in your eyes.'

627
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:21,291
'You are the God of my love and
 I'm thirsty for your love.'

628
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:32,219
'I see the divine in your eyes.'

629
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:36,723
'You are my pride, you
 are my dignity.'

630
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:42,855
'I don't know what may happen.'

631
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:48,485
'Oh darling! '

632
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,650
Arjun, drop your weapon!

633
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:13,862
Or else I'll kill this girl.

634
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,489
I'm telling you to drop your weapon.

635
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,741
Or else this girl
 will lose her life.

636
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:23,205
I'm telling you for the last time,
 Arjun. Drop your weapon!

637
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:27,584
I'm telling you to drop your weapon.

638
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:40,222
Drop it!

639
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:15,591
Kashi Trivedi! I made you
 a minister from a milkman.

640
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:19,344
I made you an M.L.A. And a
 leader of the opposition.

641
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:22,598
For what? For this day!

642
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,768
So you can give milk sitting
 in the parliament.

643
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:31,356
Hey Kashi! Pappu Kalia is dead.

644
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:35,444
One by one all my lead
 men are killed...

645
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,945
...by that police commissioner
 of yours.

646
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:39,406
My 25 years of rule over
 the Mumbai city...

647
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:42,743
...was all destroyed by
 your Mumbai police.

648
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:45,412
And over there you have
 ruined my name...

649
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:49,875
...in front of the I.S.I.

650
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:53,086
Do something, minister.
 Think of something.

651
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:55,506
Think of a solution to this.
 Relieve us from this problem.

652
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:59,676
I have a solution for this,
 brother Zafar.

653
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:03,805
But it will cost you a hefty price.

654
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:08,101
I was just thinking, when will
 you bark for more money.

655
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,646
Okay then, tell me how much.

656
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,398
Then listen to me carefully, Supari.

657
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:17,402
The government of chief minister
 Satyanarayan Joshi...

658
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:20,489
...is only supported by
 eleven independent MLA's.

659
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:24,826
And from those eleven, nine
 are ready to be bribed.

660
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:30,749
The cost is 60 crores.

661
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:36,588
That means with 60 crores you
 can become the chief minister.

662
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,424
Okay Kashi, over rule
 the government.

663
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:42,761
You'll get the 60
 crores by tomorrow.

664
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:45,430
Then just think as you
 have become the...

665
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,559
...prime minister of Mumbai,
 brother Zafar.

666
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:53,146
Everyone in the government
 will consist of our people.

667
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:59,069
Government will be ours
 and the rule will be yours.

668
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:23,135
Hey Munna! Hey Badri!

669
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:26,138
Didn't I tell you?

670
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,473
We'll fix, we'll break.

671
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,726
We'll fight and make
 others fight too.

672
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:33,061
I'll make the parties
 and break them too.

673
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:37,441
But one day I'll definitely
 sit on this chair.

674
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:41,486
That day has arrived, Munna.

675
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:45,490
Now I'm the king of this state.

676
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:50,621
And the rest all are subjects.

677
01:12:56,793 --> 01:13:00,881
Listen brothers, all you
 ministers', MLAs'...

678
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:05,385
...and officers' honesty,
 that is ho... nes... ty...

679
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:09,640
...is a thing of the past with your
 past chief minister. Understood?

680
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,768
Now whatever I'll say will
 be considered as orders.

681
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:17,689
Whatever we'll decide
 will be the law.

682
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:27,032
Tell me Bhonsle, have you brought
 my transfer orders...

683
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:30,619
...from the chief minister's office.

684
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:33,539
How did you know, sir?

685
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:37,960
I knew, as soon as the new
 government is in rule...

686
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:44,091
...the ministers have an old habit
 of transferring officers.

687
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:48,804
Bhonsle, explain to these ministers.

688
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:52,808
Only area can be changed
 by transfers...

689
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:56,019
...not determination.

690
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:01,024
Tanaji, you take care of yourself...

691
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:05,070
...and keep writing letters to me.

692
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:26,800
So you have also received
 the news of my transfer.

693
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:33,599
So what's there to worry about it?

694
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,018
This sort of things, do happen.

695
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:39,605
But sir, the people who
 changed government...

696
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:43,609
...in 13 hours and transferred
 you in 3 hours...

697
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:47,613
...how can soldiers like
 us who are only paid...

698
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:50,866
...10 to 12 thousand rupees
 fight against them.

699
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:54,953
Avasthi, by putting a price
 tag on this uniform...

700
01:14:54,953 --> 01:15:00,083
...don't insult all our
 country's honest officers.

701
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:06,131
Terrorist fight for money.

702
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:10,010
Soldiers only fight
 for the dignity...

703
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:14,056
...and safety of their country.

704
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:18,852
Son, they can put
 someone else in my place.

705
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:23,357
But they cannot change our
 thoughts and our rights.

706
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:28,862
Sir, from now onwards your
 rights will be our duty.

707
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,575
The fire of your heart is now
 burning within our hearts.

708
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:40,040
Sir, the dream you had
 of a crime free state...

709
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:43,669
...now we'll fulfill that dream.

710
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:47,798
This will be our gift to our master.

711
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:55,973
I have spent 60 crores to break
 and make the government.

712
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:01,687
And for that, not only
 60, not only 600...

713
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:06,525
...but I'll torture 36 thousand
 crores citizens of Mumbai...

714
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:09,152
...to repay all that amount.

715
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,613
From builders to actors...

716
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,949
...and from doctors to producers...

717
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,785
...don't spare anyone.

718
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:21,707
Tell them, if they want to live then
 need to pay the protection money.

719
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:25,002
If they want their
 families to be safe...

720
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:28,672
...then they should
 send money to Zafar.

721
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:31,675
If anyone wants to do
 business in Mumbai...

722
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:34,011
...or even if someone wants to
 breathe freely in Mumbai...

723
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:39,016
...then send brother Zafar
 his salutation money.

724
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:44,980
Yeda!

725
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,150
These police people
 thrashed my men...

726
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,737
...in their own homes.

727
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:54,740
Then threaten their homes too.

728
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:59,745
Their mothers, sisters,
 wife and kids.

729
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:02,664
If someone disagrees
 then chop them up.

730
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:06,919
Tell the police force, to be
 afraid of this father of theirs.

731
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:11,840
From this Zafar Supari.

732
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:39,243
Mom! Where are you?

733
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:06,728
Brother!

734
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:14,111
Leave me!

735
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:51,106
Don't be afraid!

736
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:56,987
I'm not here to kill you but
 to make you understand.

737
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,407
You know Zafar Supari.

738
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:02,784
He lives in a foreign country...

739
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:06,079
...but rules over the
 whole Mumbai city.

740
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:10,876
Officers like your brother
 serve Zafar Supari.

741
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,797
Explain it to your brother.

742
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:20,052
That consider Zafar as father
 and Yeda as elder brother.

743
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:25,057
Always salute him. Be afraid
 of brother Zafar.

744
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:30,812
Next time I won't come here
 to explain anything.

745
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:36,777
I'll chop your mother to pieces
 and kidnap you too.

746
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:45,953
And an ways a hot girl
 does not belong here...

747
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:52,042
...but in the arms of brother
 Zafar. But after me.

748
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:26,535
Who was here?

749
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:31,331
Rakhi!

750
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:39,590
Who was here, Rakhi? Tell me.

751
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:47,306
Yes, tell me.
 - Yeda!

752
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:52,019
One of Zafar Supari's men.

753
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:21,048
So tell me Chopra, how would
 you like to have a bullet?

754
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:29,306
With whisky? With soda?

755
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,603
With water?

756
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:39,650
No brother!
 - Or else... direct!

757
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:43,028
No Yeda Bhai, forgive me.

758
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:47,074
Forgive you? You use
 to fly very high...

759
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:49,618
...when the commissioner was there.

760
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:52,788
No Yeda Bhai. That... I...

761
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:56,083
C'mon. Bring three crores cash,
 the overseas rights...

762
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:59,086
...for your new film,
 and the contract...

763
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:04,591
...for its home video and music.

764
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:06,468
C'mon go.

765
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:10,597
I'll bring it. I'll just
 bring it, Bhai

766
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:19,708
What did you say? You'll chop
 our mothers in pieces?

767
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,212
Kidnap our sisters?

768
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:27,090
No, Haider Bhai.

769
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:35,224
So, pimp of Zafar Supari...

770
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:39,728
...c'mon spread your chaos
 in the Mumbai city.

771
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:43,690
Now threaten the police force.

772
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:45,692
No.

773
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:50,155
So Yeda, now you tell me...

774
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:53,575
...how would you like
 to have a bullet.

775
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,703
With water?

776
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:02,167
With soda?

777
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:09,466
With whisky? Tell me.

778
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,678
Or else...

779
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:17,266
No! - Direct!

780
01:24:17,266 --> 01:24:20,352
No!

781
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:38,537
Chote, its Yeda calling.

782
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:40,205
Yes Yeda, tell me.

783
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:44,877
Brother, these people,
 they have killed Yeda.

784
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:48,005
What?

785
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:50,716
What are you blabbering?

786
01:24:50,716 --> 01:24:55,929
I'm not blabbering. But telling
 the truth, Zafar Supari.

787
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:59,224
Who are you?

788
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:02,436
Ma... Po... Se...

789
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:04,771
Ma... Po... Se...?

790
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:09,484
Yes, Maharashtra Police Service.

791
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:15,324
Zafar Supari, here's an advice.

792
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:20,287
Don't send a group of eunuchs
 to take on real men again.

793
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:27,127
Remember this, Zafar,
 for thugs like you...

794
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:31,798
...there is no other thug greater
 then the police in the world.

795
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:39,223
Zafar Supari, this is
 your final warning.

796
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:41,517
For you there will be
 no charge sheet...

797
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:46,355
...only D-final, which
 mean only death final.

798
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:51,777
Jai Hind!

799
01:25:55,697 --> 01:26:01,328
Brother!
 - Hey Rakhi!

800
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:05,707
You two at the police
 station together.

801
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:08,669
Tell me who is here to
 complain about whom?

802
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:11,004
First of all you write
 down my complaint sir.

803
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:14,550
This sister of yours keeps
 threatening me all the time.

804
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,635
If you don't do this then
 I'll get you arrested.

805
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,887
If you don't do that then
 I'll get you handcuffed.

806
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:22,057
She is doing nothing wrong.

807
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:24,101
Look brother, the government
 is giving him...

808
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:26,270
...a scholarship for higher studies.

809
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,897
And this sir denies on leaving.

810
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:32,776
Brother, not even three weeks have
 passed for our engagement...

811
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:36,613
...and she wants me to go away
 to Canada for three years.

812
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:39,616
No, brother. I won't go.

813
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,702
If I would have been in your place
 then I would have left...

814
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:45,789
...the next day after engagement.
 - Brother!

815
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:48,625
Don't miss it.

816
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,962
You have already got her
 now, don't leave that.

817
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:55,090
And as far as your fiancée
 is concerned...

818
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:59,178
...then my name is Arjun Ranawat.

819
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,523
You betrayer! In your rule that
 inspector Arjun Ranawat...

820
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:16,111
...tortured Yeda and my
 men to death like dogs.

821
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:20,532
And you are just laying eggs sitting
 on the chair of the C.M.

822
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:23,243
Warming the seat, is that all?

823
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:27,623
No brother, the matter is...
 - Don't interrupt me.

824
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:32,419
If you don't take care of
 those policemen soon...

825
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:36,131
...then I'll take care
 of your whole family.

826
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:41,011
But brother I was...
 - Son of a pig!

827
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:45,682
If I can make a government
 with 60 crores...

828
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:50,979
...then I'll just blow your head
 with a bullet worth Rs. 60.

829
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:56,276
And wipe out you and
 your entire family.

830
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:04,785
What happened, Mr. Kashi?
 Who was it?

831
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:10,999
It was my father. My mother's
 lover. Zafar Supari.

832
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:14,294
You idiot Yashwant Deshpande...

833
01:28:14,294 --> 01:28:16,421
...I brought you all
 the way from Pune...

834
01:28:16,421 --> 01:28:18,674
...and made you the police
 commissioner here.

835
01:28:18,674 --> 01:28:23,136
For what? To dance in your
 father's procession?

836
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:26,181
It is not in charity
 but by paying a whole...

837
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,350
...2.5 crores, I have become the
 police commissioner of Mumbai.

838
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:31,353
Look at this. Did you
 hear that Kulkarni?

839
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:34,064
He's crying for his 2.5 crores.

840
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:38,068
Explain your father, those
 encounter specialist...

841
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:42,739
...killed Zafar's men. Were
 you cooking that time?

842
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:45,742
Now go and dismiss this
 encounter team.

843
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:48,245
I don't want to see this
 encounter team again.

844
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:49,746
Understood or not?

845
01:28:49,746 --> 01:28:51,915
I just can't do anything
 like this, Mr. Kashi.

846
01:28:51,915 --> 01:28:56,003
Then what can you do?
 Just ring bells.

847
01:28:56,879 --> 01:29:01,008
Am I the home minister
 of this country?

848
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:04,136
I told you that I just
 can't do anything.

849
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:07,723
Even the D.G. And the central
 government are involved in this.

850
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,808
This anger will give us nothing.

851
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:12,728
Whatever we'll have to do, we
 have to think carefully and do.

852
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:17,274
Mr. Kashi, first think
 of Arjun Ranawat...

853
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:22,196
...and before that think
 of Haider Ali.

854
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:26,658
Haider is the eyes
 and ears of Arjun.

855
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:31,038
He handles all his networking.

856
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:33,749
If you eliminate Haider
 then think that...

857
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:38,754
...you have broken
 the spine of Arjun.

858
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:42,799
Mr. Kashi, I'll take care of Haider.

859
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:45,093
I'll make an issue of his religion...

860
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:47,804
...and try for his transfer.

861
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:53,435
I don't want mere trying.
 Transfer him.

862
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,523
And that too very soon.

863
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:50,200
Mr. Arjun!

864
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,371
Just wait!
 - Yes!

865
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,207
I know that you are the strong
 and the silent types...

866
01:30:57,207 --> 01:31:01,003
...who don't say their hearts out.

867
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:05,174
But what will you do with your eyes?

868
01:31:05,174 --> 01:31:06,884
What are you saying?

869
01:31:06,884 --> 01:31:10,387
I wanted to say that I
 can clearly make out...

870
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:14,975
...from your eyes that
 you love me very much.

871
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:18,020
Anything else?

872
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:21,940
Okay then tell me, should
 the ring be worn...

873
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:25,027
...in the finger or around the neck?

874
01:31:25,027 --> 01:31:28,697
In the nose.
 - Stop joking.

875
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:32,367
Please tell me.
 - In the finger.

876
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:37,247
Then hold my hand and put
 this ring in my finger.

877
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,375
And make me your companion.

878
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,045
Companion?
 - Yes!

879
01:31:43,045 --> 01:31:46,507
First don't let me suffer so much.
 - What?

880
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:52,346
I'll make you wear the ring
 later but first wear this.

881
01:31:57,017 --> 01:32:01,188
Jannat, beauty is adored
 when it's covered.

882
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:40,894
'The heart which falls in love.'

883
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:49,069
'That heart becomes a non believer.'

884
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:56,577
'Then may God be angry with
 you or the world leaves you.'

885
01:32:58,036 --> 01:33:06,879
'Or even if the life deserts you.'

886
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,192
'When the magic of love takes over.'

887
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:33,363
'Then everything seems
 to be unfamiliar.'

888
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:45,000
'Lovers are already crazy, but
 even the world seems crazy.'

889
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,252
'The intoxication takes
 over your eyes.'

890
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:49,421
'The fun of life begins.'

891
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:55,052
'My heart just feels
 to be restless.'

892
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:48,647
'There's a sea of love in my heart.'

893
01:34:57,698 --> 01:35:02,327
'You come and sail on it.'

894
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:12,004
'My heart seems to be drowning.'

895
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:16,216
'You come and save it.'

896
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,640
'My heart is going out of control.'

897
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,143
'My heart just won't
 slow down thumping.'

898
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:30,564
'My heart just feels
 to be restless.'

899
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:05,432
'Love is such a thing.'

900
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:12,481
'It's dearer than life.'

901
01:36:13,273 --> 01:36:20,572
'It would trade your life.'

902
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:32,125
'It is such a nuisance.'

903
01:37:02,155 --> 01:37:04,658
Haider Ali, here is
 your transfer order.

904
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:08,495
You are being transferred from
 the job because of your caste.

905
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:11,707
You hand over charge to
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.

906
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,208
But why sir? - The special
 investigation team will be on...

907
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,210
...an operation to investigate
 the Mumbai underworld's...

908
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:20,465
...link with the ISI and exposing
 some of the ISI agents here.

909
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:26,388
It is their opinion that in this
 operation some of our officers...

910
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:30,934
...may be soft on the
 alleged ISI agents.

911
01:37:30,934 --> 01:37:33,937
Why don't you say it clearly sir?

912
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:38,400
That I'm being transferred
 because I'm a Muslim...

913
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,655
...and hence would be helping
 the Muslim criminals.

914
01:37:52,748 --> 01:37:56,585
Look at this.
 Can you see these bullet marks?

915
01:37:56,585 --> 01:37:59,588
These are marks from bullets
 fired by Muslim terrorists.

916
01:37:59,588 --> 01:38:02,758
The bullets coming
 out of my gun doesn't...

917
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:05,802
...ask a criminal his
 caste or religion.

918
01:38:05,802 --> 01:38:10,724
Whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim.

919
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:14,269
Through this report
 you want to convey...

920
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:17,773
...that my caste, my religion is a
 proof of me being a traitor. - Haider.

921
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:20,734
No Arjun.

922
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:25,489
Even if I cut of my head and give it
 to them, even then this department...

923
01:38:25,614 --> 01:38:30,869
...would not believe that Haider is a
 honest and patriotic police officer.

924
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:43,465
Haider don't do it. Ali don't do it.

925
01:38:43,632 --> 01:38:48,011
I don't want to do this job, Arjun.

926
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:11,368
Commissioner, Haider Ali
 is such a Muslim...

927
01:39:11,618 --> 01:39:13,328
...who can sacrifice his
 life for his country...

928
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:17,332
...his land, even
 without this uniform.

929
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:29,803
This is a mistake on your part sir.

930
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:34,600
They are neither Hindu nor Muslim.
 The traitors have no Caste or religion.

931
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:39,855
The mere fact that I'm a Rajput
 or that you are a Brahmin...

932
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:44,693
...is not proof of us being patriots.

933
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:49,281
Such a cheap criminal thought
 takes youths like Haider Ali...

934
01:39:49,406 --> 01:39:54,661
...to wrong directions,
 distancing them from our country.

935
01:39:54,745 --> 01:39:57,873
Why don't you understand?
 These decisions are not taken here.

936
01:39:57,873 --> 01:40:01,418
They are taken in the offices of
 the Home ministry and DGP.

937
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:07,424
If you have the guts, go there and
 tell them what you just now told me.

938
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:37,829
Shut up. You mean that he,
 who took his belt of and...

939
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:40,666
...walked out abusing the police
 department in front of a Commissioner...

940
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:43,919
...that ill mannered junior
 of yours is correct?

941
01:40:43,919 --> 01:40:47,172
That we are all communal...

942
01:40:47,172 --> 01:40:49,967
...is that what you want to say?

943
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:53,720
If your seniors call you and
 tell you that you are a Sikh and...

944
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,723
...that you would be aiding the
 Khalistani terrorists and hence you...

945
01:40:56,723 --> 01:41:00,894
...are being transferred from Punjab
 then you'd also have not liked it.

946
01:41:02,938 --> 01:41:05,482
Sir, if you were not stopped from
 fighting Sikh terrorists...

947
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:09,486
...then why is Haider Ali Khan
 being stopped from fighting...

948
01:41:09,486 --> 01:41:14,992
...Muslim terrorists and ISI agents?

949
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:16,827
Without any proof or witness...

950
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:19,496
...just on the grounds
 of the religion...

951
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:24,877
...to suspect somebody
 is unconstitutional.

952
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:30,966
Our constitution gives prominence
 to duty. Best man for the job.

953
01:41:30,966 --> 01:41:34,887
It does not give
 prominence to religion.

954
01:41:35,971 --> 01:41:40,934
Haider Ali Khan is such a
 soldier who would like his uniform...

955
01:41:41,643 --> 01:41:46,023
...to be adorned a million times, but
 would never let it be tarnished once.

956
01:41:55,866 --> 01:41:58,702
The dudes have proved
 be to be a traitor...

957
01:41:58,702 --> 01:42:04,166
...now they will knock me of
 in an encounter any day.

958
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:11,048
What is this? My arrest warrant?

959
01:42:11,048 --> 01:42:14,218
Or is it a search warrant
 against a traitor?

960
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:19,765
No. These are orders
 to have to more pegs.

961
01:42:19,765 --> 01:42:23,018
But have it joy. - What do you mean?

962
01:42:23,018 --> 01:42:27,564
Read it and you'll know.

963
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:35,113
Your transfer order
 has been cancelled.

964
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:43,038
You did this for me?
 - No, for myself.

965
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:52,714
Because, the police department
 needs officers like you...

966
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,801
...and I need a friend
 like you. - Is that so?

967
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:58,637
The you must also
 do something for me.

968
01:42:58,637 --> 01:43:01,598
You ask for it. - The listen.

969
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:05,769
An angel like
 daughter in law for the mother.

970
01:43:05,769 --> 01:43:07,855
An angel like
 sister in law for me and Rakhi.

971
01:43:07,855 --> 01:43:11,859
An angel like wife for you.

972
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:55,235
'I'll hide you in
 my eyes in such a way'

973
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:12,211
'How ever you try to escape,
 I'll steal you away'

974
01:44:14,963 --> 01:44:20,677
'In your love my dear'

975
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:29,603
'In your love my dear,
 I'll forget the world '

976
01:44:29,686 --> 01:44:35,943
'How ever you try to escape,
 I'll steal you away'

977
01:45:01,969 --> 01:45:06,765
'The vermillion on my forehead tells
 it The bangles on my hands tell it.'

978
01:45:06,849 --> 01:45:15,899
'The anklets on my feet tell it.
 Listen to it my dearest.'

979
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:27,828
'I'll adorn you forehead with stars
 I'll fill your heart with happiness'

980
01:45:27,911 --> 01:45:35,669
'I'll make you my bride.
 Listen to it my dearest.'

981
01:45:35,878 --> 01:45:41,675
'I've found out my life.'

982
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:46,471
'I've found my happiness.'

983
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:52,352
'I've found my love.'

984
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:58,817
'I'll make love'

985
01:46:02,029 --> 01:46:07,826
'The mirror of love.'

986
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:15,000
'How ever you try to escape,
 'I'll steal you away.'

987
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:13,100
You have entered this house on the
 day of celebrations to our goddess.

988
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:18,355
My fortunes have opened up.
 May you live long.

989
01:47:21,942 --> 01:47:23,819
Dear, this is a special gift.

990
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:26,071
Rakhi had it made so
 as to give it to her...

991
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:30,367
...sister in law when she
 comes to this house first.

992
01:47:31,368 --> 01:47:35,372
Hold this dear.

993
01:47:44,214 --> 01:47:48,552
May you live long dear.

994
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:53,432
May your hands always
 raise to bless me mama.

995
01:47:53,432 --> 01:47:57,936
Hold this mama. Let me show
 you the house Sister in law.

996
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:02,316
Go along dear.

997
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:10,574
She is good. You sit down,
 I'll arrange for some food.

998
01:48:14,536 --> 01:48:16,038
Hey Deshpande.

999
01:48:16,038 --> 01:48:21,001
You are scared like a
 sixteen year old teenager in bed.

1000
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:25,797
Listen, I'm deputy Chief Minister...

1001
01:48:26,173 --> 01:48:30,052
...and when the elder
 brother is the CM...

1002
01:48:30,052 --> 01:48:33,013
...what damage can the report...

1003
01:48:33,013 --> 01:48:36,600
...being prepared by that
 ACP Arjun Ranawat do to us?

1004
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:42,231
Don't you read the newspapers?
 If not, start reading them.

1005
01:48:42,231 --> 01:48:45,943
Because of the leak
 in Jaiswal report...

1006
01:48:45,943 --> 01:48:50,489
...a DGP, a Commissioner and a dozen
 officers are rotting in custody.

1007
01:48:50,906 --> 01:48:55,410
Damage has been done to them,
 you understand?

1008
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:58,121
Listen, Kashiji.
 Arjun is digging into our nexus...

1009
01:48:58,121 --> 01:49:02,501
...with the underworld.

1010
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:06,171
If he succeeds in establishing
 that nexus then...

1011
01:49:06,171 --> 01:49:10,342
...it would dig a grave for
 us and the underworld.

1012
01:49:12,928 --> 01:49:16,557
Try and get that report at any cost.

1013
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:18,600
If that report goes to Delhi...

1014
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,270
...then all of us will be behind bars.

1015
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:25,065
And if...

1016
01:49:25,065 --> 01:49:27,943
Badri, those forged documents
 that are being printed in our press...

1017
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:33,949
...that should be given to
 me tomorrow. - Yes brother.

1018
01:49:34,908 --> 01:49:40,330
Now regarding that
 report by Arjun Ranawat...

1019
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:47,045
...that report would
 be on the table of...

1020
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:51,175
...Chief Minister Kashinath Trivedi,
 tomorrow morning.

1021
01:50:24,499 --> 01:50:30,047
Do you remember something.
 ACP Arjun Ranawat.

1022
01:50:30,172 --> 01:50:35,636
I told you that one day
 I'll occupy this chair.

1023
01:50:38,096 --> 01:50:43,018
And that you'll salute me.

1024
01:50:43,018 --> 01:50:45,687
Do you remember?

1025
01:50:45,687 --> 01:50:48,315
You are mistaken Kashi Trivedi.

1026
01:50:48,315 --> 01:50:52,569
I've saluted this
 constitutional position...

1027
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:56,073
...and not you.

1028
01:50:56,073 --> 01:51:00,494
Those who sit on this
 chair keep coming and going.

1029
01:51:02,204 --> 01:51:04,373
Stay within your status.

1030
01:51:04,373 --> 01:51:08,544
From today I'm your master
 and you're my servant.

1031
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:14,383
I'm a public servant
 and any one else.

1032
01:51:21,139 --> 01:51:24,226
Tell me what did you call me for.

1033
01:51:24,226 --> 01:51:27,229
The listen.

1034
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:30,482
I've kept the Home
 ministry with myself.

1035
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:32,818
The data bank on
 the Mumbai mafia...

1036
01:51:32,818 --> 01:51:36,154
...that you have compiled...

1037
01:51:36,154 --> 01:51:40,617
...give it to me.

1038
01:51:41,243 --> 01:51:42,744
I knew it.

1039
01:51:42,744 --> 01:51:49,084
You'll want this which deals about
 those who helped you reach till here.

1040
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:56,258
Take it. Keep it safe.

1041
01:51:56,633 --> 01:52:00,721
Confidential...

1042
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:04,600
So this is the real stuff?

1043
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,188
You must have worked
 very hard to compile this?

1044
01:52:34,213 --> 01:52:40,260
Saw how it burnt it
 to ashes in a moment?

1045
01:52:42,471 --> 01:52:47,309
You must be feeling
 bad about it. Isn't it?

1046
01:52:47,476 --> 01:52:52,314
No, but you will.

1047
01:52:52,314 --> 01:52:54,650
Maybe you'll have a heart attack

1048
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:58,862
Because one copy of this has been
 sent to the central Home ministry...

1049
01:52:58,987 --> 01:53:03,158
...and the second to
 the Presidents office...

1050
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:10,165
...and the third to
 the Prime minister's office.

1051
01:53:12,334 --> 01:53:15,337
Your Mafia friends can't escape now.

1052
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:20,217
You tout for Zafar Supari.

1053
01:53:20,217 --> 01:53:25,722
What did you say?
 You called me a tout?

1054
01:53:26,515 --> 01:53:28,684
You called Kashi a tout?

1055
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:31,520
You called the CM a tout?

1056
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,190
You small time police officer,
 what is your status?

1057
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:39,236
What do you think you are?

1058
01:53:39,278 --> 01:53:43,657
Kashi Trivedi, when the
 bones break at this age...

1059
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:48,203
...then it is difficult
 to set them back.

1060
01:53:48,203 --> 01:53:52,291
Take your hands of me.

1061
01:53:52,457 --> 01:53:56,545
Now I'll show you your status.

1062
01:54:24,281 --> 01:54:28,869
You beat up the CM! You beat the CM.

1063
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:35,292
No, a patriotic and
 honest public servant...

1064
01:54:35,292 --> 01:54:41,840
...has beaten up a traitor and
 a dishonest public servant.

1065
01:54:45,552 --> 01:54:49,765
Kashi Trivedi,
 my name is Arjun Ranawat.

1066
01:54:49,765 --> 01:54:54,394
To me death is like a pillow
 and a coffin is like a bed.

1067
01:55:01,443 --> 01:55:04,613
Jai Hind!!

1068
01:55:13,038 --> 01:55:15,332
Yes 555, what is the news?

1069
01:55:15,332 --> 01:55:20,254
Who Arjun sir? - No, I'm Haider Ali
 speaking. Tell me.

1070
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:24,341
The young girls
 brought for flesh trade...

1071
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:27,344
...from all parts of India...

1072
01:55:27,344 --> 01:55:32,099
...have been hidden in a place
 behind the railway yard.

1073
01:55:32,099 --> 01:55:36,436
Then they will be sent to
 different brothels in Mumbai.

1074
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:40,816
You please save them sir.

1075
01:55:40,816 --> 01:55:45,946
Don't worry, we'll go
 there and save them all.

1076
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:57,541
Please don't kill me sir. Leave me.

1077
01:56:30,699 --> 01:56:32,409
There is nobody here.

1078
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:35,412
Was news given by 555 false sir?

1079
01:56:35,412 --> 01:56:37,497
Is this a trap? - Yes.

1080
01:56:37,497 --> 01:56:40,959
This is a trap.

1081
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,714
A trap for all of you to die.

1082
01:56:45,714 --> 01:56:48,175
Zafar Supari, You?

1083
01:56:48,175 --> 01:56:53,514
Yes it's me. I'm in India.

1084
01:56:55,224 --> 01:56:58,602
See around you.

1085
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:10,489
Encounter specialist,
 I'll do the encounters today.

1086
01:57:11,406 --> 01:57:14,868
Yours, Your friend Arjun Ranawat's...

1087
01:57:14,868 --> 01:57:18,080
...and that of the whole Mumbai city.

1088
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:23,043
See, I've brought 500 tones of RDX.

1089
01:57:23,544 --> 01:57:27,589
Turn around and see.

1090
01:57:31,885 --> 01:57:36,181
It's good that you have brought
 your own pyre to burn yourself.

1091
01:57:36,473 --> 01:57:39,226
Instead you burning
 the city of Mumbai...

1092
01:57:39,226 --> 01:57:45,566
...you'll be burnt by me,
 Haider Ali Khan.

1093
01:58:47,544 --> 01:58:49,046
We have been trapped sir.

1094
01:58:49,046 --> 01:58:50,839
Five of our colleagues are dead.

1095
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:55,552
We have no option but to retreat.

1096
01:58:55,552 --> 01:58:59,014
This is not the time
 to retreat, friends.

1097
01:58:59,014 --> 01:59:02,518
This is the time to pay back our
 debt to this uniform we wear.

1098
01:59:02,518 --> 01:59:07,731
Today all of us will
 pay back that debt.

1099
01:59:10,984 --> 01:59:14,530
How much ammos are we left with.

1100
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:18,033
Last magazine sir.

1101
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:49,690
Friends, our prime target is
 the RDX brought by Zafar Supari.

1102
01:59:50,065 --> 01:59:54,528
I'm moving towards that direction.

1103
01:59:54,736 --> 01:59:56,196
Any doubts?

1104
01:59:56,196 --> 01:59:58,991
No Sir.

1105
02:01:04,806 --> 02:01:07,142
No.

1106
02:01:07,142 --> 02:01:11,188
Oh God.

1107
02:01:24,993 --> 02:01:28,705
Haider.

1108
02:01:54,898 --> 02:02:00,696
You came to bury Mumbai in the
 ashes of the explosion you planned.

1109
02:02:00,863 --> 02:02:09,830
Now I, Haider Ali would bury you in
 the ashes of the explosion of your RDX.

1110
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:32,019
Awasti you! A traitor!

1111
02:02:32,352 --> 02:02:35,439
Yes.

1112
02:02:40,819 --> 02:02:43,947
Haider Ali.

1113
02:03:19,816 --> 02:03:25,239
Hello.
 - Yes, Maharashtra Police Services.

1114
02:03:27,282 --> 02:03:31,453
Go to old Jassai railway yard...

1115
02:03:32,287 --> 02:03:37,251
...where the corpses
 of your brother Haider...

1116
02:03:38,293 --> 02:03:43,006
...and other colleagues of
 yours are waiting for you.

1117
02:04:52,993 --> 02:04:56,079
Haider.

1118
02:05:19,019 --> 02:05:22,105
Haider.

1119
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:36,537
'The uniform is our pride'

1120
02:05:36,954 --> 02:05:42,209
'The uniform is our faith'

1121
02:05:45,254 --> 02:05:50,259
'The uniform is our identity'

1122
02:05:51,009 --> 02:05:56,306
'The uniform is our God.'

1123
02:05:57,015 --> 02:06:05,274
'I bequeath this birth to my nation.'

1124
02:06:15,242 --> 02:06:20,414
'We are proud'

1125
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:25,460
'of our nation'

1126
02:06:26,128 --> 02:06:30,007
I am very sorry to
 inform the press that...

1127
02:06:30,007 --> 02:06:34,011
...Haider Ali Khan, a brave
 officer the crime control squad...

1128
02:06:34,011 --> 02:06:41,101
...was a secret agent operating for
 Pakistan and the underworld.

1129
02:06:48,775 --> 02:06:53,614
Pakistan and the
 underworld together...

1130
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:58,076
...had planned for a repeat serial
 bomb explosion in Mumbai.

1131
02:06:58,076 --> 02:07:01,997
Inspector Haider Ali
 was helping them...

1132
02:07:01,997 --> 02:07:06,585
...to bring 500 tones
 of RDX into Mumbai.

1133
02:07:13,675 --> 02:07:18,931
Yesterday, Inspector
 Awasti reached the spot...

1134
02:07:19,014 --> 02:07:23,227
...and destroyed the
 dangerous mission.

1135
02:07:23,227 --> 02:07:27,940
Not only did Awasti destroy
 the RDX but also killed...

1136
02:07:28,357 --> 02:07:35,155
...the traitor Haider Ali Khan
 and his accomplices.

1137
02:07:49,086 --> 02:07:54,174
During our raids at
 Haider Ali's residence...

1138
02:07:55,092 --> 02:07:58,554
...we have got some floppies,
 foreign bank accounts...

1139
02:07:58,554 --> 02:08:01,807
...forged passports and visas...

1140
02:08:01,807 --> 02:08:06,603
...and some ISI identity cards.

1141
02:08:07,062 --> 02:08:12,150
These are proofs of his having
 been a Pakistani agent.

1142
02:08:41,430 --> 02:08:46,143
Zafar Supari.

1143
02:08:56,153 --> 02:08:59,156
What am I doing?

1144
02:08:59,156 --> 02:09:04,203
I had vowed not to
 discuss this with anybody.

1145
02:09:04,203 --> 02:09:08,248
But today I've broken my vow.

1146
02:09:08,749 --> 02:09:12,085
No.

1147
02:10:11,562 --> 02:10:15,274
What is this man saying?

1148
02:10:15,274 --> 02:10:19,486
Samar Singh has
 resigned his police job...

1149
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:22,698
...and is going to fight Ranawat's
 case. He has filed a suit in court.

1150
02:10:22,698 --> 02:10:25,951
What is so alarming in this?

1151
02:10:25,951 --> 02:10:29,288
Everybody knows that Samar Singh
 is also a lawyer.

1152
02:10:29,288 --> 02:10:32,541
But he is also an emotional lawyer.

1153
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:35,961
But we are professional lawyers...

1154
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:39,298
...experienced in proving
 true as false and false as true.

1155
02:10:39,298 --> 02:10:43,385
Let it be. - But we should be...

1156
02:10:43,385 --> 02:10:46,305
Mr. Kashi. The false evidences
 that we have and...

1157
02:10:46,305 --> 02:10:49,349
...the charge sheet I've made
 is so strong and fool proof...

1158
02:10:49,349 --> 02:10:54,563
...that leave aside Samar Singh...

1159
02:10:55,355 --> 02:11:01,278
...even God can't save Arjun Ranawat
 from death penalty.

1160
02:11:01,278 --> 02:11:04,823
The game is over.

1161
02:11:08,285 --> 02:11:12,289
You honor, I would like
 to present the officers...

1162
02:11:12,289 --> 02:11:17,878
...who have been working with Arjun
 Ranawat for the past 15 years.

1163
02:11:19,296 --> 02:11:23,091
These witnesses will tell us that...

1164
02:11:23,091 --> 02:11:27,346
...who Arjun Ranawat is and
 what his character is like.

1165
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:29,765
And what the truth is.

1166
02:11:29,765 --> 02:11:33,310
Permission granted.

1167
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:37,356
Your honor, this is
 that Arjun Ranawat...

1168
02:11:37,356 --> 02:11:40,359
...who is considered as
 the lion of Mumbai.

1169
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:44,613
The mafia gangs would just
 pee after hearing his name.

1170
02:11:44,613 --> 02:11:47,699
Sir, he's that Arjun Ranawat
 by whose fear...

1171
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:50,369
...these underworld people
 were not only forced...

1172
02:11:50,369 --> 02:11:54,373
...to leave the city but the country.

1173
02:11:54,373 --> 02:11:57,751
Your honor, if in the police
 force there weren't...

1174
02:11:57,751 --> 02:12:00,838
...officers like Arjun
 and Haider Ali...

1175
02:12:00,838 --> 02:12:03,674
...then these mafias would
 have made the police...

1176
02:12:03,674 --> 02:12:09,012
...their pimps and the Mumbai
 city their whore house.

1177
02:12:10,806 --> 02:12:14,351
But this is the misfortune
 of this country...

1178
02:12:14,351 --> 02:12:17,354
...that one was killed
 by humiliation while...

1179
02:12:17,354 --> 02:12:20,649
...performing his duties
 and the other...

1180
02:12:20,649 --> 02:12:24,778
...is standing in this witness box.

1181
02:12:28,824 --> 02:12:31,660
I would like to call Arjun
 Ranawat's mother...

1182
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:36,832
...that is Shakuntla Devi
 in the witness box.

1183
02:12:36,832 --> 02:12:40,043
Permission granted.

1184
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:45,299
Mrs. Shakuntla Devi, tomorrow
 when the court will declare...

1185
02:12:45,424 --> 02:12:49,636
...your son to be a traitor
 and sentence him to death...

1186
02:12:50,429 --> 02:12:54,516
...then won't you be ashamed
 of being his mother?

1187
02:12:54,516 --> 02:12:58,395
Won't you regret it?

1188
02:12:59,521 --> 02:13:07,696
Regret! I'll regret that why
 didn't I give him birth.

1189
02:13:09,531 --> 02:13:13,660
I'll regret that why didn't every
 mother of this country...

1190
02:13:13,744 --> 02:13:17,414
...didn't give birth
 to a son like Arjun.

1191
02:13:17,414 --> 02:13:22,044
Not regret, but I'll be
 proud of Arjun's death.

1192
02:13:23,003 --> 02:13:26,423
The same pride which Bhagatsingh's
 mother felt...

1193
02:13:26,423 --> 02:13:30,093
...on the day of Bhagatsingh's
 execution.

1194
02:13:30,093 --> 02:13:34,139
Every country men
 would have felt it.

1195
02:13:36,725 --> 02:13:41,480
Your honor, not in this
 life but in every life...

1196
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:46,401
...I would like to live and
 die as Arjun's mother.

1197
02:13:50,572 --> 02:13:55,702
Wow! What a speech! Astonishing!
 Incredible!

1198
02:13:55,911 --> 02:13:58,997
But I would like to remind
 the court that this case...

1199
02:13:58,997 --> 02:14:01,917
...is just a simple murder case.
 And the criminal...

1200
02:14:01,917 --> 02:14:04,545
...has already admitted his crime.

1201
02:14:04,545 --> 02:14:09,341
And your honor, I also want
 my friend to know...

1202
02:14:09,466 --> 02:14:13,470
...that cases are fought with
 evidence and witnesses.

1203
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:17,474
But not with speeches
 and dramatics.

1204
02:14:17,474 --> 02:14:21,478
Then your honor, when his mother
 has already compared...

1205
02:14:21,478 --> 02:14:25,482
...him to be as Bhagatsingh then
 to save the humiliation...

1206
02:14:25,482 --> 02:14:29,903
...to that great martyr I have
 no other choice but to...

1207
02:14:29,987 --> 02:14:34,408
...unveil a truth after which
 each and every mother...

1208
02:14:34,491 --> 02:14:39,079
...and sister of this world would
 like to drown in shame.

1209
02:14:39,621 --> 02:14:42,875
And this mother... she'll
 feel that the ground...

1210
02:14:42,875 --> 02:14:47,880
...has suddenly slipped away
 from under her feet.

1211
02:14:50,549 --> 02:14:52,885
Okay Mrs. Shakuntla
 Devi, tell the court...

1212
02:14:52,885 --> 02:14:55,053
...that on the night
 of 1st of November...

1213
02:14:55,053 --> 02:14:59,850
...where was your daughter Rakhi?

1214
02:14:59,975 --> 02:15:03,812
Answer me, Shakuntla Devi on
 the night of the murder...

1215
02:15:03,812 --> 02:15:08,734
...your daughter and his so called
 sister... where was she?

1216
02:15:15,657 --> 02:15:20,537
Answer me, where was she?

1217
02:15:22,539 --> 02:15:25,667
Then you only tell
 me Arjun Ranawat...

1218
02:15:25,667 --> 02:15:29,546
...on the night of 1st of November...

1219
02:15:29,546 --> 02:15:34,885
...where was your so called
 sister, Rakhi Dixit?

1220
02:15:36,678 --> 02:15:41,892
Answer me, Arjun Ranawat.
 Why are you so quiet?

1221
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:48,690
You can't answer this question
 and neither your mother.

1222
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:53,737
I'll answer this question.

1223
02:15:55,614 --> 02:15:58,617
Your honor, on the night
 of 1st of November his...

1224
02:15:58,617 --> 02:16:01,537
...sister, a slut, a tramp and
 a woman of loose character...

1225
02:16:01,537 --> 02:16:04,540
...was at the chief minister's
 farm house.

1226
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:06,875
Making merry with the
 deputy CM, Munna Trivedi...

1227
02:16:06,875 --> 02:16:08,961
...police commissioner's son...

1228
02:16:08,961 --> 02:16:12,172
...and many such people.

1229
02:16:12,172 --> 02:16:14,550
She was a high society
 call girl, your honor.

1230
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:16,885
She just didn't had illegitimate
 relations with many men...

1231
02:16:16,885 --> 02:16:21,807
...but also with his so
 called brother Arjun Ranawat.

1232
02:16:25,727 --> 02:16:28,897
She was his sister by day
 and her keep by the night.

1233
02:16:28,897 --> 02:16:31,775
Just a filthy keep.

1234
02:16:31,775 --> 02:16:35,612
Tyagi!

1235
02:16:53,755 --> 02:16:57,801
Arjun! No Arjun!

1236
02:17:05,601 --> 02:17:10,314
He has started to beat him up.
 - Someone stop him.

1237
02:17:12,608 --> 02:17:17,779
Hold him! Hold him!

1238
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:27,080
Arjun! No, my son.

1239
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:31,418
Arjun, I'm telling you
 stop it. Leave him.

1240
02:17:31,418 --> 02:17:35,631
You are under my oath.

1241
02:17:51,438 --> 02:17:54,149
Did you see, your honor?

1242
02:17:54,149 --> 02:17:58,445
He doesn't know any other
 way to choke the truth.

1243
02:17:58,445 --> 02:18:01,657
He cannot see anyone else
 having indecent relation...

1244
02:18:01,657 --> 02:18:05,661
...with Rakhi but himself.

1245
02:18:05,661 --> 02:18:09,665
On the night of 1st of November
 when he found...

1246
02:18:09,665 --> 02:18:12,668
...his keep-sister with not one
 but three men on the bed...

1247
02:18:12,668 --> 02:18:15,003
...then he lost his control
 just like this.

1248
02:18:15,003 --> 02:18:19,842
And then he slaughtered
 everyone there.

1249
02:18:28,141 --> 02:18:32,604
Samarsingh, one more inappropriate
 action...

1250
02:18:32,688 --> 02:18:36,733
...from your client like this and
 I'll be forced to stop this...

1251
02:18:36,733 --> 02:18:42,865
...proceeding and come
 to a conclusion.

1252
02:18:46,869 --> 02:18:50,038
Today's proceeding is stopped here.

1253
02:18:50,038 --> 02:18:53,750
Tomorrow's proceeding will be
 held in the presence of...

1254
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:57,754
...paramilitary force and
 the people who are...

1255
02:18:57,754 --> 02:19:01,925
...concerned with this case.

1256
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:13,854
Bastard! Scoundrel!

1257
02:19:13,854 --> 02:19:17,191
If I wasn't obstructed
 by the law today...

1258
02:19:17,191 --> 02:19:21,278
...then I would have shot that Tyagi.

1259
02:19:22,029 --> 02:19:25,741
By presenting Rakhi in
 the court tomorrow...

1260
02:19:25,741 --> 02:19:28,744
...I'll clear all the lies
 Tyagi has put up.

1261
02:19:28,744 --> 02:19:32,414
But Rakhi cannot come to the court.

1262
02:19:32,414 --> 02:19:35,751
Why? Why can't she come?

1263
02:19:35,751 --> 02:19:38,754
She'll have to come to
 the court tomorrow.

1264
02:19:38,754 --> 02:19:44,218
But sir, she is in a deep shock
 due to Arjun's actions.

1265
02:19:44,551 --> 02:19:49,556
Since she got the news she
 just won't react to anyone.

1266
02:19:49,556 --> 02:19:53,810
She is being treated at the St.
 Mary's sanitarium in Khandala.

1267
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:59,983
There is definitely some secret
 that Arjun is hiding from me.

1268
02:20:03,946 --> 02:20:08,825
Don't be so silent. Tell me, Rakhi.

1269
02:20:08,825 --> 02:20:13,163
What was the reason behind
 that manslaughter?

1270
02:20:13,956 --> 02:20:18,460
One of your brother, Haider Ali
 has died a humiliating death.

1271
02:20:18,877 --> 02:20:21,964
And the other one is
 charged with treason.

1272
02:20:21,964 --> 02:20:24,883
Will you be able to bear
 that your brother Arjun...

1273
02:20:24,883 --> 02:20:29,012
...is sentenced to death?

1274
02:20:29,555 --> 02:20:32,307
Will you able to live after
 hearing that your brother...

1275
02:20:32,307 --> 02:20:36,937
...is a despicable and
 disgraceful person.

1276
02:20:38,981 --> 02:20:42,317
Hey, stone hearted woman,
 will you be able to bear...

1277
02:20:42,317 --> 02:20:44,903
...the people's blame that you had...

1278
02:20:44,903 --> 02:20:50,284
...an indecent relation
 with your brother.

1279
02:20:51,034 --> 02:20:54,955
Will you be able to listen that
 you are Arjun's keep?

1280
02:20:54,955 --> 02:20:59,251
No!

1281
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:03,005
Tell me clearly, child,
 what the truth is.

1282
02:21:03,005 --> 02:21:07,885
Maybe I'll be able to
 save Arjun's life.

1283
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:13,891
Tell me, what the truth is.

1284
02:21:13,891 --> 02:21:16,894
I'll tell you uncle.

1285
02:21:16,894 --> 02:21:22,399
I'll tell you what the truth is.

1286
02:22:30,008 --> 02:22:35,055
Your honor, these are some
 documents which I'm going...

1287
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:39,017
...to give to the chief minister
 and the police commissioner.

1288
02:22:39,017 --> 02:22:43,021
Just watch carefully.

1289
02:22:44,106 --> 02:22:48,902
So chief minister, what
 do you have in your hand?

1290
02:22:50,279 --> 02:22:54,157
They are the pamphlets
 of my election propaganda.

1291
02:22:54,157 --> 02:22:59,037
And this is my news paper,
 'Mera Bharat Mahan.'

1292
02:22:59,037 --> 02:23:02,749
Can you tell us where
 are they printed?

1293
02:23:02,749 --> 02:23:07,546
At my own printing press in Nagpur.

1294
02:23:08,005 --> 02:23:11,758
So police commissioner, what
 do you have in your hand?

1295
02:23:11,758 --> 02:23:15,012
This? They are the documents
 from Pakistan which mention...

1296
02:23:15,012 --> 02:23:20,017
...that Haider and Arjun
 are ISI agents.

1297
02:23:22,144 --> 02:23:24,771
According to the reports given
 by laboratory experts...

1298
02:23:24,771 --> 02:23:29,109
...the ink used in printing these
 documents from Pakistan...

1299
02:23:29,193 --> 02:23:32,029
...is the same as the
 chief minister's...

1300
02:23:32,029 --> 02:23:36,533
...newspaper, 'Mera Bharat Mahan.'

1301
02:23:39,161 --> 02:23:43,415
Now only two points can
 be noted out, your honor.

1302
02:23:43,415 --> 02:23:47,586
Either chief minister's newspaper
 'Mera Bharat Mahan'...

1303
02:23:47,669 --> 02:23:51,423
...is printed in Pakistan. Or
 documents from Pakistan...

1304
02:23:51,423 --> 02:23:54,426
...are printed in his
 own printing press...

1305
02:23:54,426 --> 02:23:59,556
...which is in Maharashtra, India.

1306
02:24:02,017 --> 02:24:06,188
Your honor, these two great people...

1307
02:24:06,188 --> 02:24:09,024
...forgot this small point.

1308
02:24:09,024 --> 02:24:12,569
And to prove Arjun and
 Haider to be traitors...

1309
02:24:12,569 --> 02:24:16,073
...in their own printing press
 they printed these...

1310
02:24:16,073 --> 02:24:20,202
...fake documents of Pakistan.

1311
02:24:20,202 --> 02:24:22,412
Arrest them.

1312
02:24:22,412 --> 02:24:26,416
Your honor, he's trying to change
 the direction of this case.

1313
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:30,504
Because this case isn't a case
 of forgery but of murder.

1314
02:24:30,838 --> 02:24:35,342
And no one can change the truth that
 the guilty has killed 18 people.

1315
02:24:36,093 --> 02:24:39,096
Does his lawyer have any evidence...

1316
02:24:39,096 --> 02:24:43,141
...which will prove that this
 murder wasn't a crime.

1317
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:44,810
I have that evidence, your honor.

1318
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:49,606
Then present that evidence
 and prove Arjun innocent.

1319
02:24:51,233 --> 02:24:56,113
Why are you so silent?
 Show us the evidence.

1320
02:24:56,154 --> 02:25:00,659
I have the evidence, but I can't
 present it in the court.

1321
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:07,082
Do you know that this statement...

1322
02:25:07,082 --> 02:25:11,086
...may also result the guilty
 being sentenced with death penalty.

1323
02:25:11,086 --> 02:25:13,547
Yes sir.

1324
02:25:13,547 --> 02:25:16,300
Sentence Arjun to death.

1325
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:20,762
I'm asking you for the last time,
 what was the reason for the murder.

1326
02:25:25,267 --> 02:25:28,270
Answer me, Mr. Samarsingh.

1327
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:33,192
Sentence him to death. I
 can't tell the reason.

1328
02:25:59,301 --> 02:26:03,597
Your honor, I will tell
 you the reason.

1329
02:26:03,597 --> 02:26:08,477
No, Rakhi! You go back.

1330
02:26:10,145 --> 02:26:14,233
I'm telling you, go back Rakhi.

1331
02:26:15,275 --> 02:26:20,155
You under my oath, Rakhi. Go back.

1332
02:26:21,448 --> 02:26:27,329
You are under the oath of your
 mother, back off from this hell.

1333
02:26:30,332 --> 02:26:32,334
No brother.

1334
02:26:32,334 --> 02:26:37,130
Neither any promise nor any
 God can stop me today...

1335
02:26:37,214 --> 02:26:41,343
...from telling the truth
 of our relationship.

1336
02:26:41,343 --> 02:26:44,221
Don't be a fool, Rakhi.
 You'll be ruined.

1337
02:26:44,221 --> 02:26:47,224
Let me be ruined.

1338
02:26:47,224 --> 02:26:52,896
Today I will tell what the truth is.

1339
02:26:56,358 --> 02:27:00,195
Your honor, on the night
 of 1st of November...

1340
02:27:00,195 --> 02:27:03,615
...brother of this CM, deputy
 CM Badrinath Trivedi...

1341
02:27:03,615 --> 02:27:07,786
...underworld don Zafar Supari,
 inspector Avasthi...

1342
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:11,206
...son of this commissioner
 and his men...

1343
02:27:11,206 --> 02:27:15,460
...kidnapped me and took
 me to their farmhouse.

1344
02:27:20,841 --> 02:27:29,474
Your honor, to rape me.
 To gang rape me.

1345
02:27:31,393 --> 02:27:34,271
No, please! Brother!

1346
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:39,651
Come to me!
 - No! - Take Inspector.

1347
02:27:48,285 --> 02:27:51,747
Brother!
 - C'mon, get up!

1348
02:27:51,747 --> 02:27:55,626
Help me!

1349
02:28:37,334 --> 02:28:41,588
I'm Zafar Supari. If you have
 the guts then come to the...

1350
02:28:41,672 --> 02:28:49,429
...CM's farmhouse and stop your
 sister from being raped.

1351
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,968
This is the truth of that night.

1352
02:35:00,968 --> 02:35:07,099
Now you know why my brother
 has kept his silence...

1353
02:35:07,182 --> 02:35:11,687
...and wished for a death penalty.

1354
02:35:11,687 --> 02:35:13,814
Just wait.

1355
02:35:13,814 --> 02:35:18,360
You honor, I'm a soldier.

1356
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:20,863
I don't want a mercy life.

1357
02:35:20,863 --> 02:35:24,992
My only wish is either
 victory or be a martyr.

1358
02:35:26,869 --> 02:35:28,871
Give me a death penalty.

And to save the pride
 of my country...

1361
02:35:34,751 --> 02:35:38,755
...I'll pick up weapons again.

1362

 taken up weapons...

 and the future.

...the chief minister,
 Kashinath Trivedi...

1366
02:35:58,817 --> 02:36:02,988
...and commissioner Deshpande
 on counts of treason.

1367
02:36:05,199 --> 02:36:09,661
And with that, the one who took
 up weapon for the safety...

1368
02:36:09,745 --> 02:36:14,666
...of the society Arjun
 Ranawat is declared...

1369
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:20,088
...free from all charges against him.

1370
02:36:20,756 --> 02:36:25,219
Long Live Arjun Ranawat!
