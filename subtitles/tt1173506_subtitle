1
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,786
Vijayawada - Gandhi nagar

2
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,160
Hubby, you remember it, right?

3
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:24,946
Today is Friday.
- So what?

4
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:28,368
No school bus today, drop him at
school and go to office.

5
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:29,971
How do l appear to you?

6
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,825
Why do you tell me all this
to an office goer?

7
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:34,608
There's a jobless, useless idiot
at home, tell him to do it.

8
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,489
Cool, he came late last night
and is still in bed tired.

9
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,508
lf you work hard, you get tired,

10
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,489
if you over sleep it's laziness.

11
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,310
Wake him up.
- What's that noise sister-in-law?

12
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,232
Can't you lower the volume?

13
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:47,151
l told him dear,
but he never listens to me.

14
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,275
You sleep dear.

15
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:54,378
Bloody lazy bum!
lt's 9 am, get up!

16
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:56,552
What should l do waking up so early?

17
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:58,793
Think sincerely what you should do.

18
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:01,807
lf thinking can getjobs,
people will always think then.

19
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,561
You don't know the value ofjob.

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,702
That's why you gave up
a good job to loiter.

21
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,332
Mother, l'm going to office.

22
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:11,112
Look at our neighbour Pandu,
2 years junior to you,

23
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,804
he's earning Rs.40000 a month.

24
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:15,558
Whenever he tells his mother
about going to office,

25
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:17,545
do you know how happy
l'm hearing it?

26
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,979
You're useless.

27
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,476
Brother, it may be
distasteful to hear,

28
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,563
Rajasekhar Reddy is 4 years
younger than you,

29
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,348
he's CM of the state.
How about you?

30
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,495
We mustn't be jealous
about others' success.

31
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,184
Our fates decide our future.

32
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:30,335
Am l right, sister-in-law?

33
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:32,512
You never say anything wrong.
- You shut up.

34
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,201
Atleast you listen to me and
get first rank this year.

35
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:38,118
As uncle says, if it's in
my fate, l'll get it.

36
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:45,762
Goddess Durga, l'm losing
my sanity in this house,

37
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,668
bless my brother turns new leaf
by next festival Dussera.

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:15,510


39
00:04:59,045 --> 00:04:59,841
What are you looking at?

40
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,172
How beautiful is that girl, brother!

41
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:51,669
You'll lose eyes.

42
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:55,311
Bloody eyes! l don't mind losing it
after seeing such a great beauty.

43
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,853
Uncle is finished today!

44
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:01,680
Take a dip...
- Stop it!

45
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,816
Your actions don't look friendly,
you want to drown and kill me?

46
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:06,353
Bloody dips!

47
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,124
Where is the girl?
l don't see her again, my babe!

48
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,272
Where are you?

49
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,502
Master, can you take care
of this bag?

50
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,421
Master? ln which school
did you see me?

51
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,584
Why are you getting angry?
Master is not a bad word, master.

52
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,599
Master again? One shot and it'll
reverberate all over Vijayawada.

53
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:31,211
Why are you staring at me?

54
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,487
l can't do anything beyond that.

55
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:34,541
l'm a cheat, but you look
more smarter than me.

56
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,490
Brother! What are you doing there?
Come here.

57
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,115
Coming dear...look boy...

58
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:41,316
Call me as master, is any bad word?

59
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,977
You're a schemer.
- Yes l'm a schemer.

60
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:46,340
He's a big trouble.

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,336
Look brother-in-law!

62
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:49,602
You wanted me to take care of bag.

63
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,047
Did you call me as brother-in-law?

64
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,795
l said come brother-in-law.
That girl..?

65
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,368
My aunt's daughter.
- You..?

66
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:56,489
Her aunt's son.

67
00:05:56,682 --> 00:06:00,030
Give the bad.
- No need, l found her. Leave me.

68
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,503
Leave you? No way!

69
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,658
Where did you along with the bag?

70
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,480
l thought of visiting Gudivada
before you finish taking bath.

71
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,434
Gudivada? Why?
- Shut up!

72
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:11,652
How many times will you bathe?

73
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:14,334
You entered the water at midnight,
you were going on taking dips,

74
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,940
go and change.

75
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,382
Finished taking bath?

76
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,508
Look at the girl.

77
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:25,820
She's really beautiful!

78
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,262
Don't we make a great pair?

79
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,719
They say a couple must be
like Lord Shiva and Parvathi.

80
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,921
You both look like servants
of Goddess Parvathi.

81
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,994
Never misuse your position.

82
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:37,949
Give me an idea to talk to her.

83
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,035
lt's very easy.

84
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,857
Throw this ring there,

85
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:44,633
go to the girl and ask her,
if this ring is hers,

86
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,521
she'll say it's not hers,

87
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:48,757
l'll make an entry then
and say it's mine,

88
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,135
you must give the ring to me.

89
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,156
Then l'll say something really
great about you,

90
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,145
l'll say it's impossible to find a better
man than you in Vijayawada.

91
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,330
Would she fall in love with me?

92
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:59,543
She'll think about it.
- Give the ring.- Take it.

93
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,610
ls this ring yours?

94
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,679
No.
- See it again, it may be yours.

95
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:08,816
No need to press it again,
l say it's not my sister's.

96
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,570
You keep quiet, she's thinking.
See it again.

97
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,368
He's giving a great performance.

98
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,421
Why are you refusing?

99
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:16,623
The ring fell at her feet,
she says it's not hers,

100
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,637
is she hesitating?
- No, the ring is mine.

101
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:20,438
Oh my God!

102
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,613
lt suits you well.

103
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:22,861
Excuse me, the ring is mine.

104
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,556
Shut up! How many of you've
swooped on Vijayawada?

105
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,862
Cut it, no more drama after
losing my ring.

106
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,441
Actually, l gave the ring for
him to talk to you,

107
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,270
please tell him to return it.

108
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,703
Why are you hesitating?
Tell her l gave you.

109
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,266
Don't wear it, it may not come out.

110
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,866
Forget about it.

111
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,033
Finding gold on Dussera day
is auspicious,

112
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,121
and the man who gives will
become a relative.

113
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,300
Well said!

114
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,674
Shut up!

115
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:47,944
Let's go.
- My ring!

116
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,527
ldeas mustn't be costly.
- l understood itjust now.

117
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,061
Got it atleast now, bloody fool!

118
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,043
ls my ring lost forever?

119
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,173
Let it get lost,
l'll get a girdle for you.

120
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,181
Once again please.

121
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:03,427
Let's go.

122
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,029
Brother, the queue is very long,
it may take hours to get a glimpse.

123
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,423
Am l not here?
You don't worry dear.

124
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:20,607
l'll take care of it.

125
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:23,942
Minister and his family are
offering prayers inside.

126
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,959
Move...

127
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:28,572
You're an MRO,
won't they give us preference?

128
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,564
How can l misuse my official position?

129
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,093
l don't have my lD card too.
- Forgot it?

130
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:34,945
You always forget the
most important things.

131
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,320
Where did she vanish?
l can't find her.

132
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,590
Once l saw and l lost my ring,
come let's go.

133
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,447
l'll kill if you go away.

134
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:43,545
Look!
- Let's go.

135
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,043
Why are you standing here?

136
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,098
Come with me, l'll take you
inside jumping the queue.

137
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,047
No need, my brother will do it.

138
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,860
No need of brother, come with me.

139
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,912
Why are you looking at slipper?

140
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,478
l think it's going to wear out.

141
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,322
A dog will bark and a slipper
will wear out, that's natural.

142
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,941
lsn't it?- He'll get it mended
and get beaten up.

143
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:09,524
Why are you in this bad condition?

144
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,792
Very crowded, l slipped
and people crushed me.

145
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,259
Your brother has been crushed,
what next?

146
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:19,259
Madam, use that gate to enter,
sir, you use this gate to enter.

147
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:20,977
How will you slip past this crowd?

148
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,521
l'll beat you and
you carry on walking.

149
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:28,690
Move...move...
- You move l'll tell him.

150
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,377
l'm MRO Chandrasekhar's brother,
open the gate.

151
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,731
You go inside.
Come...come...

152
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,419
Thanks, you stay here only.
Close the gate.

153
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:40,853
Hello Sunil!

154
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:42,542
Brother!

155
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:43,474
Where is Krishna?

156
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,321
He took others using your name,
why are you standing here?

157
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,778
Priest, the prayers must be fantastic.

158
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:51,883
Prayers must be offered with
devotion not fantastically

159
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,125
Given a chance you'll sermonize.
Ask their names.

160
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:55,633
Your names and race.

161
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,354
You heard it right,
my name is Bobby.

162
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,555
Strange! Your name?

163
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,864
Though the name is old, l love it.

164
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,278
Goddess, bless me that Sandhya
becomes my wife by next year.

165
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,221
We used to bunk classes
to roam in temple.

166
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:18,438
That's why l know people here.

167
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,005
To offer prayers to Goddess Durga?
- No, for ogling girls.

168
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:24,132
Bobby, you're hurt already,
do you need comedy now?

169
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,918
Why is this hill known
as lndrakeeladri?

170
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,720
Because, lndra film's 100 days
success was celebrated here.

171
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,517
That's why it's known as lndrakeeladri.

172
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,017
lf you know it,
answer it or else leave it.

173
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:38,025
To tell you the truth,
l don't know, you please...

174
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,521
Keeladri means mountain,

175
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:44,291
Goddess on this mountain is prayed
by Lord lndra everyday,

176
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,896
so it's known as lndrakeeladri.

177
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,104
Thank you very much,

178
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,831
though l was born here
l didn't know this till now.

179
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:49,980
can l have your phone number?

180
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:50,631
Why?

181
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:53,376
To know things l don't know.
- Go, get out.

182
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:54,625
Come, let's go.

183
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:00,733
You come.
- Brother...

184
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:02,269
Take down.

185
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,190
Tell me.

186
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:09,793
Oh my God!

187
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:33,052
My heart is asking for more...
Till yesterday bore but now it's gala...

188
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:35,389
l got your phone number...

189
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:40,020
l got your door number...
My heart is all yours...

190
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:44,921
With a ravishing smile
and devastating waist...

191
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,733
You swept the ground off my feet...

192
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:07,309


193
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,892
You made me run all over
Vijayawada for you...

194
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:36,046
You navigated my heart to you...

195
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:39,686
You made me fall for you...

196
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:43,398
You made my heart to race...

197
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:47,078
l saw your mood..
l saw your speed...

198
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,238
But when l came closer,
you look different...

199
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:11,973


200
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,286
You made a mincemeat of me...

201
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:38,649
You took my heart away...

202
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,330
l was a gentleman till l met you...

203
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,009
You turned me into a mad man...

204
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,656
l hate you...
You're troublesome...

205
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:53,849
l'll may get tempted seeing you
coming after me...

206
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:09,106


207
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,171
l saw your wares...

208
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:27,766
lt's okay to me...
l love you...

209
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,316
Nobody is picking it up.

210
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:57,808
You fell for her, she may have
given you a wrong number.

211
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,659
His love is one sided.

212
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:02,854
How much ever the distance be,
the journey starts with one step.

213
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:06,121
Love is also like that, it starts one side
and turns into two sided affair.

214
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,228
No philosophy please,
it won't suit you.

215
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,331
No response, go directly.
- Good idea!

216
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:26,953
Stop...stop it.
Why so many are beating one man?

217
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,512
Who are you to stop us?
- Sandhya's man.

218
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:33,221
lnstead of beating him,
can't anyone of you pick up the phone?

219
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,562
We don't pick phones
while on a settlement.

220
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,353
Great...sir please get up.

221
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,338
What's your mistake?
- l took loan.

222
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,258
Loan? You must repay it.

223
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:42,527
Or else go invisible to
the money lender.

224
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,515
Follow the second rule,
get going now.

225
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,684
Go...go...escape!

226
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,084
Where is Sandhya?
- Upstairs.

227
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:59,170
Who are you to take
pictures of me dressing?

228
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:01,370
l came for Sandhya.
- l'm Sandhya.

229
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,504
Don'tjoke, your name may
be different, try to remember.

230
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,112
Why should l try to
remember my name?

231
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:06,872
Who are you?

232
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,796
Don't get tensed,
Sandhya gave this number.

233
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:09,920
Do you know whose house is this?

234
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,574
Whose?
- Lanka Raju!

235
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,273
Lanka Raju?

236
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:20,318
By mistake l came here sister,
she gave me the wrong number.

237
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:20,957
Please forgive me.

238
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,037
lt's not a small mistake to forgive you,

239
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,531
who is there?
- Sister, listen to me,

240
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,448
l was an accomplished sprinter,

241
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,611
l didn't expect it'll help
me someday. Bye!

242
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:32,407
Catch him!

243
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:35,952
Hey boys! Where are you guys?
- Sister is calling you, go...

244
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:37,780
What were you doing
when he dared come up?

245
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,124
Who sent him up?

246
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:40,915
Don't you now him, sister?

247
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,207
What is your sister doing?
- She's crying boss.

248
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:55,441
lf people come know this,
what would they do?

249
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,566
Laugh at us.

250
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:59,060
You said it right.

251
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:05,617
lf my honour is to be redeemed,
you must do one thing,

252
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:10,029
kill her or kill the intruder.

253
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,563
Who shall we kill?

254
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,100
The intruder.

255
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,476
Where is his house?

256
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,872
People go to him for settling problems,

257
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,493
you picked a problem with him.

258
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:26,063
Shut up, l'm tensed and
don't poke fun at me.

259
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,159
Give me an idea!
- Uncle...

260
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:34,915
What happened?

261
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:37,157
Goons came to our home...
- What did they do?

262
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,244
Mother and father...
- Where are they?

263
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,232
Did you talk to the police?
- They left the place.

264
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,345
They will come back after the job is over.

265
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,958
Do you know why l made
you stand in public?

266
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:58,114
To restrain public from talking about
Krishna taking photographs of my wife.

267
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:01,310
But they need a topic to discuss,

268
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,453
and it must be your brother's death.

269
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,435
Call your brother and
ask him to come here.

270
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,460
l'll believe if you say my brother
lied or did some mischief,

271
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:13,182
but l'll not believe if you say
he misbehaved with a woman.

272
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,650
l didn't call this meeting
to make you believe.

273
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,917
To kill him!

274
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:20,003
Call your brother, where is he?

275
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:26,653
Boss, it was my mistake,
leave my people,

276
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,442
they are innocent,
if you want hurt me.

277
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:29,819
They are not involved in this matter.

278
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:33,465
So, it was you who took
photos of my wife,

279
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:36,190
have they come good?

280
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:40,380
This city wishes to take photos with me,

281
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,743
why did you take my wife's photos?

282
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,564
l didn't enter your home intentionally,

283
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,581
a girl gave me the wrong number,
it lead to this situation.

284
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:48,536
Please forgive me, brother.

285
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:52,661
lf l wanted to forgive you,
l wouldn't have created this big scene.

286
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:55,226
He says it was by mistake,
please leave him.

287
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,900
lntentional or unintentional,
a knife will kill!

288
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:03,984
He'll never do it again,
please leave him.

289
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:05,750
Dear!

290
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,651
Boss!
- Kill him!

291
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:40,328


292
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,233
Come on!

293
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:24,802
Bloody!

294
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:41,531
Bloody idiots! You ate like pigs!
- Boss!

295
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:45,309
You go away boss.
- Don't spare him!

296
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:57,915
What happened here?

297
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,021
Some girl gave him a wrong
phone number...

298
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:13,239
l swear on Goddess Durga who
presides from lndrakeeladri,

299
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:16,251
if you ever dare to touch me
or my family,

300
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:20,347
your blood will flow down
the river Krishna!

301
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,165
Mind it!

302
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:32,398
What's it brother?

303
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,469
Why did you do like that?
- Hubby, take this holy water.

304
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:38,060
Do l need holy water in
these tense moments?

305
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,790
Take it and say it coolly.

306
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:42,379
Give it, you won't budge anyway.

307
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:43,822
What happened brother?

308
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,540
You gave that mischief man
a wrong phone number,

309
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,235
it disturbed his life.

310
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,226
How can life get disturbed
with a phone number?

311
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,754
Do you know whose number
you gave him? Lanka Raju's!

312
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:53,577
Who is he?

313
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,041
Most powerful man in Vijayawada,
most feared man here.

314
00:21:57,236 --> 00:22:00,104
He picked up a fight with him,
how will he survive?

315
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:03,088
Give me his address,
l'll say sorry to him.

316
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,270
Enough of the trouble
already happened,

317
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:06,636
if you say sorry and
if it leads to more problems,

318
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,499
situation will worsen.

319
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,992
Hyderabad

320
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:26,562


321
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,085
Boss.
- What?

322
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,183
The girl is not in Hyderabad.

323
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,483
Don't know about her whereabouts.

324
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:38,340
Where is your wife?

325
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,031
At home.
- Children?

326
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,411
Just now dropped them in school.

327
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:46,496
'Chak De' film is running at Prasad lmax,
book tickets for entire family.

328
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:47,939
l booked it for evening show, boss.

329
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,231
You spend time happily with family,

330
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,820
but you want us to be like eunuchs
at home trusting you guys,

331
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:55,771
we have just two months only,

332
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,596
if we don't get her here in two months,

333
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,349
not one of you will have wife or children,

334
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,418
do something and find her,
go now!

335
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:06,169
Boss!

336
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,128
Nobody other than us must
know we are looking for her.

337
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,531
Mind it.
- Okay boss.

338
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,911
ls it silent film? Scold me!

339
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,761
l've no words to scold you.

340
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,381
l got vexed scolding you
but no change in you.

341
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:26,005
Mother, l'm going to office.
- Go and see Pandu.

342
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,155
l'll see him and come back.

343
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,463
Stop...stop...

344
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,996
To announce everyone
you're working,

345
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,068
you shout, hearing it
my brother is shocked,

346
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,650
do you know when we were
playing cricket as young men,

347
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,274
you were picking up balls
as a little boy, bloody idiot!

348
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:43,378
Are you making fun of unemployed by
shouting that you're going to office?

349
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,288
Only your mother must hear your
voice from tomorrow. Got it? Go.

350
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:50,419
Bloody yapper!

351
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,952
Will you beat people you hate?

352
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:57,940
How many did l beat? Move.

353
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:58,834
Stop.

354
00:23:59,288 --> 00:24:00,531
Somehow you survived till now,

355
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,483
you can't stay here anymore,
go away.

356
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,020
Why he should go away?

357
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,676
Lanka Raju will not allow
him to live here.

358
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,405
What can he do with my uncle?

359
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,395
Uncle will beat him black and blue.

360
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:11,573
Look, he's following your suit.

361
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:13,837
Everyone is Vijayawada is like me
except you.

362
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,377
l was born and brought up here,

363
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:17,459
l can't leave the place
fearing some fool,

364
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,440
don't scare me with others.

365
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,119
Excellent home!

366
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:23,980
My ring is in this home.

367
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:25,905
l'll knock you out.

368
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,592
Okay, your Sandhya is
also in this home.

369
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,470
This is music to ears.

370
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:33,517
What should l do to get
into this home?

371
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,370
There's a tenant in upstairs,
get him thrown out.

372
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:37,094
Who is that fool?

373
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:44,003
Madam may see it, Bobby.

374
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:45,318
Madam has gone to the temple.

375
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:54,824
Bloody fool always rings
the bell at the wrong time.

376
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,447
l'll come back.

377
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:00,329
What's it now?

378
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:02,409
You wanted me to take your blessings
before going to office.

379
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,008
No need of it everyday.

380
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:06,567
Go.

381
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,517
Why is he taking his blessings?

382
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:10,468
lf you seek God's blessings,
it's devotion,

383
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:12,452
if you seek every fool's blessings,
it's fear.

384
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:15,622
lf he loses fear,
his true colour will come out.- Do it!

385
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:33,595
l feel l've met you before also,
what's your name?- Venu.

386
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,289
Venu? Your native place?

387
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,530
Krishna district, Nandigama.
- Nandigama?

388
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,940
Do you remember your childhood friends?

389
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,755
Why not?
- Tell me five names.

390
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:46,617
Hey Venu!
- Hey? Who are you?

391
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:48,507
l'm Hari, your childhood friend!

392
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,459
ls it? Where are the others?

393
00:25:52,991 --> 00:25:54,845
They are our friends.

394
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:57,977
l'm confused.
- Confused? Why?

395
00:25:58,173 --> 00:25:59,962
You gave 5 names,
all the five are here.

396
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:03,539
Number is matching but not their faces.

397
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:08,081
You never changed, same curly hair,
same voice, same complexion.

398
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,112
You look the same old ugly little boy.

399
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:11,511
Shut up! He wasn't an ugly little boy.

400
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:13,652
You mean l'm ugly now?

401
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:16,471
Friendship is blind,
appearance will make no difference.

402
00:26:16,665 --> 00:26:19,414
Generally they say love is blind.
Both are same.

403
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,199
Talk sensibly please.

404
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,855
Try to understand, have a peg
you'll be fine.- Would l be?

405
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:25,550
Have it, anyway you'll foot the bill.

406
00:26:27,895 --> 00:26:29,105
Who is he?
- Our childhood friend.

407
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:30,480
Who is he?
- l'm their childhood friend.

408
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:33,743
Bar is full of childhood friends.
- l too feel the same.

409
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,283
l feel like l know you very well.

410
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:36,621
You stay in the first floor
of Bobby's house, right? - Yes.

411
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:38,992
You seek his blessings
before going to office.

412
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:40,268
ls it?
- Yes.

413
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,186
Bloody, you're shameless.

414
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:43,882
Not for shamelessness
but for homelessness.

415
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,449
You get many, you vacate
the place immediately.

416
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,813
He'll not allow me to vacate,
l'm scared of him.

417
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,090
He has goons support.

418
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,388
You saw me falling at his feet,
but didn't see him holding my collar.

419
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:54,567
What made him do it?

420
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:56,841
He has an affair with the maid servant.

421
00:26:57,488 --> 00:27:00,586
Every night he knocks
my door at night 1 1 pm.

422
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,736
Are you sleeping?
- Sleeping sir.

423
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,014
Sleeping?

424
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,410
l must sleep sir.

425
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,939
Do you need room to sleep?
Sleep on the sofa.

426
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:14,885
l must go to the office tomorrow,
l'll be inconvenienced.

427
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:18,247
You go to office regularly, but her
husband doesn't go out regularly.

428
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:22,819
Why are you staring at her?
l'm standing here!

429
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:24,520
You go inside.

430
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:32,861
l'm a bachelor, so l'm getting
anxious about them.

431
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:35,613
Unable to control my instincts.

432
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,940
Stop...

433
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:46,748
ls it any film show to watch
from the keyhole?

434
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,771
l could see nothing.
- ls it?

435
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,209
Sit infront of me.

436
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,127
You can see very clearly.
- lt won't be nice.- Go.

437
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,794
Get me a bottle of brandy.

438
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:55,737
Liquor on the birth anniversary
of Mahatma Gandhi?

439
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:56,867
Buy whisky then.

440
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,040
The shops are closed.

441
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,766
You know my influence, don't you?

442
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,041
But the shop owner doesn't know.

443
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,505
Retort!

444
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:05,788
Get me my belt.

445
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,643
Why trouble yourself?
l'll leave.- Stop.

446
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,245
Get me a full bottle.

447
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,367
l shouldn't have peeped
through the hole.

448
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,966
What are you murmuring?
- Nothing.

449
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,017
Stop it.

450
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:15,326
You might have the patience
to narrate his harassments.

451
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:16,987
But we don't have the
patience to listen to it.

452
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:18,365
Vacate that house & come here.

453
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:19,638
He won't allow that.

454
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,725
We won't allow you to stay there.

455
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,161
lt will not work for me.
- Why?

456
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:27,320
Till now, he used to beat you.
Now, let's all go & beat him up.

457
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:28,444
At this late hour?

458
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,737
All you need is a man to get beaten up.
Not day or night.

459
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,492
Go & beat him to pulp.
- Get up.

460
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:40,433
l'm still 16 even now.

461
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,356
Why did you ring the bell at this hour?

462
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,073
Kicking the door is wrong.
Ringing the bell isn't.

463
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:46,733
To hell with you.
Fall at my feet.

464
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,206
Put your clothes down.

465
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:51,634
lf you lift your clothes again,
your inner parts will vanish.

466
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,513
What are you blabbering.
Are you drunk?

467
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,025
A great discovery.
Greetings aunt.

468
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,466
You are busy worshiping god.

469
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:11,143
But he is busy romancing
with your house maid.

470
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:17,835
Did you romance with the house maid?

471
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:24,110
Get inside. You get lost.
Get inside Sandhya. Get inside.

472
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,101
Sandhya, she is suspecting me.
How can she suspect me?

473
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:29,546
But he..

474
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,625
He is in love with Mahi.
- She is married.

475
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,707
You know that. But he doesn't.

476
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,623
l'll tell him that & send him upstairs.

477
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:41,378
You do one thing.

478
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,968
Take her inside & screen her the
film ''Greatness of Lord Panduranga''.

479
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:48,580
You shouldn't hear anything from out.
lncrease the volume.

480
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:51,078
No matter what happens.
You shouldn't hear anything.

481
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:55,134
You go inside. Go watch the film.
- Oh God!

482
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,856
Trying to fool your women.
- What?

483
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,422
What?
- Why have you changed so much?

484
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:03,774
Women shouldn't know about man's affairs.
Families will get ruined.

485
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:05,119
Go & sleep.
- He won't.

486
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,099
Who are they?
- My childhood friends.

487
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,858
They are her to beat you to pulp.

488
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:12,253
He is Tendulkar & we are the
rest of team members.

489
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:14,175
l will play cricket with you.

490
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:24,189
Why don't you listen to my cries?
- Open the door.

491
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,750
When in devotion, she even forgets
about her husband.

492
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,155
Open the door.

493
00:30:29,568 --> 00:30:31,292
Open the door.

494
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,372
Who hit on my bald head?

495
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:34,331
Me. So what?

496
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,771
l just wanted to know.

497
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,374
There is something you need to know.

498
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,014
What is that?

499
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:39,995
My friend will vacate the
house in 10 minutes.

500
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,106
Why all of a sudden? Let's think
about it & take a decision.

501
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:44,887
All we need now is
action not planning.

502
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:49,301
l need a van to shift, don't l?
l've booked the van to pickup you.

503
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:50,329
Pickup me?

504
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:51,931
That's innocence, get into the van.

505
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,965
Shall l tell you a proverb?
- What?

506
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:57,530
Lock horns with a man with good
physique or a bad physique.

507
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,184
But not with a man with
childhood friends.

508
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:01,846
Nice one.
- Okay.

509
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,041
Not you. l meant them.
- Come.

510
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:07,286
Can liquor bring such
a big change in a man?

511
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,956
He is finished today.
- Now, you can go leave.

512
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,923
Where should l go now?

513
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,199
Didn't you make any arrangements?

514
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:14,228
What arrangements?

515
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,013
Shut up. Don't make him tensed.

516
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,363
Where were you doing till now?

517
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:19,281
l was following you.
- Hereafter follow our bikes.

518
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,644
Get into the van.
- Follow us.

519
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:28,328
Where to go? - Wherever they go.
They are my role models. Go.

520
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,995
Scapegoat!

521
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:35,913
You take left & l will take right.

522
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:40,456
Whom should l follow now?

523
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:43,111
l don't understand.
- Call them.

524
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:44,490
l don't have their phone numbers.

525
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:45,670
You said they're your friends.

526
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:48,719
They said that too.
- Shit! What now?

527
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:52,075
l'm confused. Let's wait for them.
- They won't come.

528
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,514
Where will you get down?
Where should l unload?

529
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,310
Stop making me tensed.

530
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,972
Calling themselves as my childhood friends,
they got me out of the rented house too.

531
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,147
What about me?

532
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,192
Take me to the banks of Krishna river.
- Why there?

533
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,590
l will take bath and
go to office from there.

534
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:06,951
Why're we shifting our
house all of a sudden?

535
00:32:07,243 --> 00:32:08,487
Vaastu is not right in that house.

536
00:32:08,747 --> 00:32:10,721
That's why Kittu gets
into trouble often.

537
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,733
This house's vastu is good.
He will get settled in life too.

538
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:18,534
Why come here when we are
going for an auspicious function?

539
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,972
He is the house owner.

540
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,048
Sorry sir. l was little tensed.

541
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:22,913
You finished saying it.

542
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:24,453
Sorry.
- You have finished saying it.

543
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,651
Send me pudding after
house warming.- Okay.

544
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,366
Move.

545
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,225
You people say something
and later seek for pardon.

546
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:42,204
Why is he coming here?
Come here.

547
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,025
The one who gave you a ring
in the temple is coming.

548
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:45,721
Should l give him back his ring?
- lt's not about the ring.

549
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,904
Tell him that l'm not at home.

550
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:48,513
lf he inquires about Sandhya,
tell him she doesn't stay here.

551
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:51,327
Why is your face so blank?
Understood or not?

552
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:52,862
l understood.
- Then go.

553
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:59,800
Hello...
- How are you?

554
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,722
Very fine.
Can you lend me a bowl?

555
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,540
He neither inquired about
you nor Sandhya.

556
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,398
He wants a bowl.
So l brought him here.

557
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,357
l'm dead meat.

558
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:17,875
Prayer room is the best one for you.
Get inside.

559
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,289
How could you come inside directly?

560
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,115
Look at me.
- You are very lucky.

561
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:25,717
A wife at home & a lover girl
in the kitchen.

562
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:28,590
lt's a wonderful movie.
lt was a super hit in Alankar theatre.

563
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,352
We both used to go for the
late night shows everyday.

564
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:34,676
Mahi, cover that.
- He is very shy.

565
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:37,554
What brought you here?
- l need a bowl.

566
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:38,928
For what?
- To boil milk.

567
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:40,050
Why should you boil milk?

568
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:40,912
Because it's us who are going
to stay there.

569
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,038
l didn't rent it out to you.

570
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:42,993
But you rented it to my sister-in-law.

571
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:45,553
Hereafter, just remain as
a spectator in this house.

572
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,789
lf you don't, l will inform your
wife about your affair.

573
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:48,751
Where is Sandhya?

574
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,070
You are very beautiful.
- How did you get inside?

575
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,405
l've shifted to upstairs not
inside your house.

576
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,009
For rent. Just for you.

577
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:03,527
You gave me a wrong number,
l went to a wrong place.

578
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:04,973
Now l have come to the right place.

579
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:10,922
Look, what l did was wrong.
l felt bad for it. Leave it.

580
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:14,342
What?

581
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,522
Say ''Alright'' or ''Okay''
when somebody apologizes.

582
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:22,434
How could you say ''l Love you''?

583
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,064
l don't know English.

584
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,579
Brother...

585
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,487
Why did you rent the house to him?
- l didn't.

586
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,706
Yesterday, a woman came here.

587
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,198
We need a house for rent.
- How many family members?

588
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,440
Myself, my husband & 2 sons.

589
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:40,898
Will anyone call him a boy?

590
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,317
First throw him out of the house.
- lt's too difficult.

591
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,458
She got it in writing...
l mean the 10 year agreement.

592
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:51,650
Now that he has come to my house,
God knows the problems l'm going to face.

593
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,585
VlJAYAWADA

594
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:08,542
How many?
- 4

595
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,145
Where are you coming from?
- From Hyderabad.

596
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,378
Whatjob?
- Business.

597
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:15,577
What business?
- Just write it as business.

598
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:19,835
Vijayawada is very crowded
like Hyderabad.

599
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,239
How are we going to find her?

600
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,124
We have to find her till we get her.

601
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:28,381
Your girl is here.

602
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,695
Excuse me.

603
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:36,215
Why did you come out in hot sun?
Your skin may get tanned.

604
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:38,939
Why did you come here?
- Sister's computer...

605
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,019
She is your aunt not sister.

606
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,094
She is angry.

607
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,129
Her computer is not working.

608
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,737
So, you are coming from
a mechanic shop?

609
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,093
People who repair computer are
called engineers not mechanics.

610
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:51,889
Where is the engineer?

611
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:53,016
He said he will come
in the evening.

612
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:57,910
What? No way.
You go home. Just go home.

613
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:04,053
Greetings madam.
- Greetings madam.

614
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,904
Don't you have any job?

615
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:09,809
Job is not food to eat daily.
We need to get a job.

616
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,264
Since you get food on time,
you guys didn't get a job.

617
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,404
Aren't you ashamed to sit idle?

618
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:17,807
One needs patience to
sit idle not shame.

619
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,759
We have a lot of patience.

620
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:21,490
Shit!

621
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:29,451
What are you doing?
That's a computer.

622
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:30,759
Don't disturb me.

623
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,676
Why are you keeping quiet
when he is ruining the computer?

624
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:40,522
l can't handle him.
- You're fit for nothing.

625
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:43,717
When l'm fit for nothing,
it is better to do nothing.

626
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:45,164
Shit!

627
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,408
Sandhya, your system is ready.

628
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:03,809
l did Master in computers.

629
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,634
l am a gold medalist to boot.

630
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:11,294
l'm not a wastrel as you think. Bye.

631
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:24,666


632
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,852
ls everything on the table
or in the kitchen?

633
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,146
On the table.

634
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,712
Stop preparing dhal. l hate it.
- Okay.

635
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,981
Why is he behaving like
a learned man?

636
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,678
lsn't your sister-in-law at home?
- She is in the kitchen.

637
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,324
Looks like she'll fall for me.

638
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:55,547
Greetings.
- You? Welcome.

639
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:58,522
l thought of inviting you.
But l couldn't.

640
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:00,182
What will you have? Pudding?

641
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,354
l don't want anything.
- Nothing doing. Sit.

642
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:03,704
l will do it in no time.

643
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,157
Are you from Hyderabad?
- Yes.

644
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:09,785
l used to come here during
Dussera every year.

645
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:11,697
What are you studying?

646
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:13,684
l am doing Bachelor of Science.

647
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:18,162
ls Krishna an M.Sc. graduate?
- Yes.

648
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:20,822
Why didn't he find a job
instead of being idle?

649
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:22,740
He had a job.

650
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,396
He was working in a software company
and was paid Rs.40000 a month.

651
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:29,036
Did he quit?
- No.

652
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:30,096
He gave it away.

653
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,138
What are you saying?
- Yes sir.

654
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:35,282
My brother will fund
my pocket expenses.

655
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:36,979
And my sister-in-law will
give me food.

656
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,317
But his position is not like that.

657
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,431
He is the only one to look
after his parents.

658
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,665
l want this job.
He badly needs it.

659
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,465
When l could sacrifice my job for his sake,
can't you do this small favour?

660
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,565
Didn't you feel bad when he quit the job?
- No.

661
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:56,652
May be l would've felt that way
if he was my brother-in-law.

662
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,050
But l consider him as my elder son.

663
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:02,732
When children commit any mistakes,
parents won't feel bad.

664
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:20,644
Were you looking for me?

665
00:39:22,762 --> 00:39:24,005
Why you?

666
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,631
l was just going around the house.

667
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:32,804
Don't shake it too much.
lt might fall down.

668
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,363
l meant your waist.

669
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:47,581
Turn back...Turn l say.

670
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:51,809
Enough!

671
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:08,085


672
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:06,601
May your beauty go to hell...

673
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:24,629
Devil!

674
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:29,649
Don't shake too much
lest it may fall down...

675
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,525
Your eyes give up...

676
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,760
Your lips announce...

677
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,911
Your cat walk says...

678
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:48,306
Your swinging waist says it...

679
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:55,026
Why don't you say you love me?
May you go to hell...

680
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:20,069


681
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:29,084
When are we going
to get together?

682
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:48,094
When will you fall in love with me, dear?

683
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:53,889
lf senses lose interest
with old age...

684
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,305
lf there are no more desires...

685
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:00,701
Hair will turn gray...

686
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:03,172
Body will lose grip...

687
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:05,221
Don't be stubborn...

688
00:42:05,446 --> 00:42:07,420
Give me yourself to me...

689
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:09,724
Without doing it...

690
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:32,469


691
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:53,495
Women are like that only...

692
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:09,239
On face they say no
but the heart says yes...

693
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:14,354
Leave me means
hug me more tightly...

694
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,056
Shut up!
- Shut up means kiss me passionately...

695
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:22,035
Get lost!
- lt means come near me...

696
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,268
Refusal is tempting...

697
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,409
Abusing is open invitation...

698
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:28,748
Beating is acceptance...

699
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:30,507
l got you, my dear...

700
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,653
Men die for these looks.

701
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:56,294
What?- She is boarding Godavari express
to come to Hyderabad.

702
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,021
You heard it or did you see
her boarding the train?

703
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,147
l'm seeing her boarding the train.

704
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:05,153
You also get on to that train.

705
00:44:05,355 --> 00:44:06,980
Make sure she doesn't
get down in between.

706
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:08,902
l will take care of the rest.
- Okay.

707
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:12,902
Boys, busy playing cards?
Didn't you switch on the A/C?

708
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:14,982
lt might be very cool.
- lt's alright sir.

709
00:44:15,273 --> 00:44:20,422
You idiots. You guys sleep, play cards
& eat like pigs. You must work.

710
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,215
What should we do now?

711
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:24,033
Sandhya is coming to Hyderabad
in Godavari express.

712
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,334
She must be in our house once
she gets down the train.

713
00:44:26,726 --> 00:44:30,108
Never mind if few lives are lost.
But our plan shouldn't fail.

714
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:32,354
Go now & take you places.

715
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:40,862
Boss. - Take your places.
- Okay boss.

716
00:45:04,926 --> 00:45:11,547
Train No. 2727 the Godavari express
from Vizag to Hyderabad

717
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:14,835
will arrive shortly at platform no. 2.

718
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:18,832
Hey Seenu...

719
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:34,413


720
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:43,907
No. Don't kill me.

721
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:48,784
lf you got my sister, l would've
asked you the same way.

722
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,762
Would you leave her?

723
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,403
When l am alive, no one can dare
to touch my sister. No one.

724
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:19,525
Welcome home.

725
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:24,357
So many of you to receive me?
l'm no Minister.

726
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:25,635
You are more than that.

727
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:28,778
Minister will last only for 5 years.
But sister for all the life.

728
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:30,373
Come.

729
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,128
l told you that girls are like a sea.

730
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,637
When we go to the sea,
we get to see the waves.

731
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,240
When we go to the girls,
we will be left with dreams.

732
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,156
Don't you think you are
talking too much?

733
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:42,912
lf she liked you, why didn't she
tell you before leaving?

734
00:46:43,112 --> 00:46:44,672
He is also right.
- Shut up.

735
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:47,230
To hell with you & his guess.

736
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,117
She really loves me.

737
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,473
Only a lover can understand
his sweetheart's looks.

738
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,675
Forget about her.
What about this girl?

739
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,906
Which girl?
- The one running over there.

740
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,071
Don't you have sense?
What's the hurry to die?

741
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:32,476
Say something.

742
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:36,953
He is my father.

743
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:45,111
lt's all my fate.

744
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:46,899
l get entangled to your
family members.

745
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:49,040
She might be in love l guess.

746
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,223
Will you kill her for that reason?

747
00:47:50,424 --> 00:47:52,246
lf you like it, get her married.
Else try to convince her.

748
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,923
Take care of her. Bye.

749
00:47:57,623 --> 00:47:59,597
Thank god! One threat is gone.

750
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:09,802


751
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:15,115
Where is Bobby?

752
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:12,337
ln the backyard?

753
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,742
Vow of silence?

754
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:15,913
Go ahead. lt's good for Bobby.

755
00:48:16,115 --> 00:48:18,154
You can do ''Vow of blindfold''.
You won't see anything Bobby does.

756
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:27,367
We are getting too close these days.
- What's wrong in it.

757
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:29,192
This is what young people do.

758
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:39,436
Bobby, did anything fall into the well?
- My pot fell into it.

759
00:48:39,629 --> 00:48:41,767
Such a big noise? Let me see.
- Stop it.

760
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,907
lt's my pot. What bothers you?
Just get out.

761
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:45,832
Tell me where Sandhya is.
No Sandhya. Get out.

762
00:48:46,028 --> 00:48:46,889
l'll go.

763
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:51,107
Bobby, get me out quickly.
l'm scared.

764
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:55,267
l'm on it, you're too heavy for me.

765
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:57,794
l'm unable to pull you out.

766
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:08,321
May l help you?

767
00:49:09,223 --> 00:49:13,019
Bobby, get me out.
- Come fast, show your muscles later.

768
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:21,981
Pull...pull...pull..pull...

769
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,424
Pull the rope not me.

770
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:31,420
Pull up...
- Pull...don't leave it.

771
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:34,009
Coming...

772
00:49:34,497 --> 00:49:35,839
Get down!

773
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:40,859
You're very heavy!
Eating the home clean?

774
00:49:41,056 --> 00:49:42,582
She has put on weight lately.

775
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:43,896
You're comfortable, right?

776
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:46,133
l've to talk to you.
- You go carefully.

777
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:49,625
Why did you send away Sandhya
without telling me?

778
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:50,967
Why should l tell you?

779
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:52,026
Don't shout at me!

780
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:54,261
Watch this!

781
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:57,872
We are getting very close.
- What's wrong in it?

782
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:59,224
What's this?

783
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,721
l want to show on local cable.
What's your idea?

784
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,856
Making a serious thing so simple.

785
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:06,480
Her husband will kill me.
He's a rogue.

786
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:08,024
Then take me to Sandhya's place.

787
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:11,120
ls Sandhya Salar Jung museum to visit?

788
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:12,979
lf my brother Shinde knows it,
he'll kill you.

789
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:15,631
l'll give Shinde a run for his money.

790
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:27,373
Auto fare...?
- Pay it.

791
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:28,337
Me...?

792
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:32,077
Sandhya's home is also
beautiful like her.

793
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:34,224
lt appears differently to others.

794
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:36,367
lt's beautiful like Sandhya to you
and appears like death to me.

795
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:37,774
Don't talk silly, let's go in.

796
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,232
Brother!

797
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,609
Bobby! What brings you
suddenly to Hyderabad?

798
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:47,881
Problems also crop up suddenly.

799
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:49,707
You never leave Vijayawada
like a frog in the well.

800
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:51,213
No need of well too, brother.

801
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:54,604
You were handsome,
how come you've grown old suddenly?

802
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,206
l've been afflicted by a disease,

803
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:58,155
neither l can't sit or stand patiently.

804
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,877
Consult a good doctor.

805
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:02,020
lt's a disease that can
afflict doctors too.

806
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:03,815
lt stays next to you
and suck your blood out.

807
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:04,744
Who is he?

808
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:06,435
He's Krishna, stays on my head.

809
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:08,513
l mean he stays on the
floor above mine.

810
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:10,505
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

811
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,693
Good boy...innocent...trying to go
to America writing TOEFL exam.

812
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:16,320
His brother and sister-in-law
gave me his responsibility.

813
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,661
l'm also very innocent,
l brought him here.

814
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,646
Okay, stay in that room.
- Okay sir.

815
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:24,166
Ask him if Sandhya is at home?
- What?

816
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:27,203
Disease...it'll make me shout.

817
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,334
Silly disease, idiot.
Freshen up fast.

818
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,349
Come in.

819
00:51:33,895 --> 00:51:35,618
Want Sandhya!

820
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:38,912
Should l ask about Sandhya?

821
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:41,435
lf you mention the first letter S,
my brother will kill you.

822
00:51:41,637 --> 00:51:43,775
Don't beat me, Bobby...
no, don't beat me.

823
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:46,939
Don't over act,
how can l dare beat you?

824
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:52,985
l'll beat myself...

825
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,573
Why are you looking outside?
Won't you stop me?

826
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,198
l feel like meeting Sandhya.

827
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:03,196
l'll beat myself...
- He may die before Sandhya comes home.

828
00:52:08,415 --> 00:52:10,902
Why are you following me everyday?
- Brother's orders.

829
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,480
He's disturbing me a lot.

830
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:44,397
Enough of watching me,
leave me alone.

831
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:45,357
Okay.

832
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:53,804
Strange! He left immediately.

833
00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:59,563
lt's me! lt's real!

834
00:52:59,924 --> 00:53:00,720
How did you come here?

835
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,020
l can come anywhere,
you'll make me come.

836
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,624
Get out.

837
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,280
You say what you want
and l'll leave.

838
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:07,431
What should l tell you?

839
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:09,902
Don't you know it?
You left the place without informing me.

840
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:10,860
l don't know.

841
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,999
Though you deny,
it means you know it.

842
00:53:13,265 --> 00:53:15,087
Leave immediately,

843
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:16,938
if my brother comes to know
you're talking to me,

844
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:17,866
he'll kill you.

845
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,965
Brothers are always like that and
lovers will always be like me.

846
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:22,669
Say what you want to tell me,
l'll leave the place.

847
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:25,318
l'll not tell.
- l'll not leave.

848
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:33,384
Don't stare at me like that,
may you lose your vision,

849
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,368
my like was flowing smoothly
like river Krishna,

850
00:53:35,564 --> 00:53:37,570
you turned into a turbulent sea,
you know it?

851
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:39,073
He's a pain.

852
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:40,736
When did you come brother?

853
00:53:40,939 --> 00:53:43,808
No need of niceties now,
my brother Shinde is coming,

854
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,024
let's go.
- l'll not come.

855
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:48,324
l showed you just the house
and you entered the rooms.

856
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,698
You're a torture,
l think l'll die in shock.

857
00:53:53,895 --> 00:53:56,546
l'll fall at your feet...
why don't you stop me?

858
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,538
Okay, let's go.

859
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:02,756
l didn't come to go alone,
l'll take you and go.

860
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,924
No need of challenges now,
let's go out.

861
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:08,256
This is from America.

862
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:10,108
This is Rajasthan marble.

863
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:12,217
lt's ltalian marble not Rajasthan,
am l right sir?

864
00:54:12,772 --> 00:54:13,371
Why did you slap him?

865
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:14,749
Notjust slap him,
l must kill him,

866
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:16,440
He says it's ltalian marble,

867
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:17,984
can you find such homes
in Vijayawada?

868
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:19,037
You carry on brother.

869
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:21,879
Come out, l'll show you the lawn.

870
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:28,917
Don't get angry, l slapped you
for your sake only.

871
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,307
Did you get me?

872
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,891
lf you hit back, l'll be dead.

873
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:38,876
What are you looking at?
Hey you!

874
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,449
Your name?

875
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,341
Krishna from Vijayawada.

876
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,578
Young men are crazy guys,

877
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:53,680
they fall in love instantly
on seeing a beautiful girl,

878
00:54:53,882 --> 00:54:56,249
they don't know the dangers
lurking behind the beauty.

879
00:54:56,442 --> 00:55:00,019
What would we do if anyone
eyes our property?

880
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:01,842
Kill them boss.
- This is also the same.

881
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,160
The girl must come to our home,
it's more valuable than anything in this world.

882
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:07,318
Kill him!

883
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,023
Would you like to jog, Bobby?

884
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:12,651
l'm scared of treadmill.

885
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,924
lt'll stay calm and make us run.

886
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,554
Why are you scared of everything?

887
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:18,826
You'll understand
if you're in my place.

888
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:21,962
She's here...where could he be?

889
00:55:24,723 --> 00:55:27,472
Why did you shout now?
- Disease!

890
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:31,920
My heart is beating well but l feel
somebody is squeezing it wantonly.

891
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,965
Strange disease,
never heard about it.

892
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:38,666
Nobody had it before,
let's change the place, brother.

893
00:55:38,864 --> 00:55:42,441
Let's go to another place,
l'll carry the machine for you.

894
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:43,945
Not here please.

895
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,752
Take your problem seriously
and take medicines.

896
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,924
lt'll not get cured for medicines.

897
00:55:50,158 --> 00:55:53,256
So l'm taking belt treatment.
l'm getting relief.

898
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:55,687
Coming brother.

899
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:58,055
No need of her now.
She'll eat after we finish.

900
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,226
Why? She'll eat along with us.

901
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:03,176
Your plate is empty brother,
have some Upma.

902
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:05,318
Eat it with Pesarattu,
it'll be delicious.

903
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:07,718
Whether l eat upma with
pesarattu or omelette,

904
00:56:07,913 --> 00:56:09,637
l find no difference, brother.
- Why?

905
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,872
How can l answer your
every question?

906
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:13,696
He's here!

907
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,407
What?

908
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,487
Can l have breakfast here
or go out and have it?

909
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,752
Have it on my head, won't you allow
me to have breakfast too?

910
00:56:18,952 --> 00:56:20,129
Go out and have your breakfast.

911
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:23,043
How can he have breakfast
outside staying with us?

912
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:24,991
You're terrorizing him too much.

913
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,320
lt may appear like that, only the man
sitting on nails will know the pain.

914
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:30,175
Silly...take your seat.

915
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:33,023
Not here, go and sit there.

916
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:35,293
Okay sit

917
00:56:36,035 --> 00:56:37,758
l liked him at first sight.

918
00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:39,929
First you like him and
then he'll lynch you.

919
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,431
Why do you want to go to America?
- Don't allow him to talk.

920
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,568
Shut up! You tell me.

921
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:49,752
l want to earn well and present my wife
with such a big house.- Shut up!

922
00:56:50,048 --> 00:56:51,292
l'll smash your face.

923
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:54,806
Building and wife...are you
a greatman like my brother?

924
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:56,152
To present buildings.

925
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,260
He's saying something,
what's bothering you?

926
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:01,779
You didn't ask if it'll be love marriage
or arranged marriage?

927
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:02,581
Tell me.

928
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,636
Brother, if you talk to him,
l'll walk out from here.

929
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:05,460
Sit down.

930
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:09,272
lt's not a chair to sit,
it's a hot oven burning under.- Sit down.

931
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:11,098
lt's interesting.
- What?

932
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:11,990
Let him finish it.

933
00:57:12,379 --> 00:57:15,990
Both, l'll love and get my parents'
acceptance, and marry her.

934
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:17,681
What's the girl's name?

935
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:20,696
Sandhya.
- Sandhya?

936
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:22,225
Yes?
- Yes.

937
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:25,807
My sister's name is also Sandhya.
- ls it?

938
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:27,698
ls your name Sandhya?
- Yes.

939
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:30,743
Good, if you need help for
your marriage, l'm ready to help.

940
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:32,691
lf you help, it'll be easy.

941
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:34,130
l'll definitely help you.

942
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:39,178
l thought brother is very intelligent,
he's foolish than me.

943
00:57:41,493 --> 00:57:44,973
Have you gone mad?
Taking my name infront of my brother.

944
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:47,244
l love you so l'll tell your name only.

945
00:57:47,571 --> 00:57:50,353
Enough of it, please leave the place.

946
00:57:50,546 --> 00:57:51,407
Please don't try to cover it up,

947
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:54,544
if you don't love me, you would've told
your brother on seeing me here,

948
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,876
created a scene
when l kissed you,

949
00:57:57,137 --> 00:57:59,854
would've raised a hell, shouted at me
when l mentioned your name,

950
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:03,564
l don't need anymore explanation
that you love me.

951
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:08,044
Fear of your brother is
covering up the love for me.

952
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,956
l'll go away,
l'll never show up again.

953
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:14,916
Remember one thing,
you disturbed me a lot.

954
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:30,400


955
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:15,110
Where will you go?
- l don't know.

956
00:58:44,423 --> 00:58:45,405
What should l do now?

957
00:58:58,691 --> 00:58:59,422
Tell me.

958
00:59:00,196 --> 00:59:01,177
How can l express better than this?

959
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:22,676


960
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:11,306
Alluring bird...

961
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:40,943
l've lost my heart to you...

962
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:48,621
l've gone mad over you...

963
00:59:48,824 --> 00:59:50,613
lf you look at me,
l'm finished...

964
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:52,564
l'm floored by you...

965
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:56,206
l'll come with you to anywhere...

966
00:59:56,407 --> 00:59:58,381
lf you touch, l turn into a parrot...

967
00:59:58,582 --> 01:00:00,305
lf you write, l turn into a slate...

968
01:00:00,502 --> 01:00:03,949
lf you sense, l turn into love...

969
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:13,968
You be mine, my love...

970
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:34,788


971
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:34,046
l like you very much my dear...

972
01:00:56,969 --> 01:01:00,132
l'll place the world at your feet...

973
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:07,582
You're majestic than any
Emperor or his kingdom...

974
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,813
May l flood you like a cyclone...

975
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:15,998
May l become the
man of your life...

976
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:38,806


977
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:40,619
l'll arrest the fearsome
lightning for you...

978
01:02:00,794 --> 01:02:04,176
l'll make stars to shower on you
like a gentle rain...

979
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:11,188
Your heart is more shining
than lightning or stars...

980
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:15,090
May l steal your treasure...

981
01:02:15,288 --> 01:02:19,378
May l arrest you
in my heart...

982
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,366
Best quality, made in Taiwan.

983
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:49,037
Leather?
- Yes sir.

984
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,152
Give me ten pieces.

985
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:51,878
Why do you need ten to wear?

986
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:54,536
Not to wear but to beat myself.

987
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:59,560
When l lash myself, it must be painful
and bring smile on my lips.

988
01:02:59,853 --> 01:03:01,860
l must bleed but mustn't be seen.

989
01:03:02,062 --> 01:03:03,949
Do you need expensive belts for it?

990
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:06,279
My mistake is also very expensive.

991
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,431
Look at him!

992
01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:09,931
Fine?
- Great!

993
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:16,008
He dates and l watch and if my brother
comes to know, he'll lynch.

994
01:03:16,202 --> 01:03:16,704
Are they fine?

995
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:19,110
Anything will be good for
a beauty like you, buy all.

996
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:23,527
You're not any less, a stub of beard
will make you like Chiranjeevi.

997
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:26,403
Are you blind?
Get down and go.

998
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,712
Bloody idiot!

999
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:29,638
Were you hurt?

1000
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:31,325
Why should l?
He didn't mean me.

1001
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:33,501
lt synced with the scene.
You buy it, let's go.

1002
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:55,357
Hey boy! l've much to settle
with her brother.

1003
01:03:55,554 --> 01:03:56,982
You got into it unnecessarily.

1004
01:03:57,313 --> 01:04:01,371
Kill him and get her.
- Okay boss.

1005
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:17,912
What are you doing at home sending
your sister out with Krishna?

1006
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:19,896
lf you hurt my sister...

1007
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:22,546
Nothing will happen to your sister,
she'll get married,

1008
01:04:22,747 --> 01:04:24,153
you needn't worry about her,

1009
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,923
go to bangle market and
find Krishna's body.

1010
01:04:31,322 --> 01:04:33,176
Why are we running now

1011
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,597
Fearing they may kill us.
- What if we counter attack them?

1012
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:43,743


1013
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:44,526
Leave her!

1014
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,014
Leave her!

1015
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:15,535
l left her!

1016
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,365
Brother...what brings you here?

1017
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:33,488
Why did you come here?

1018
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,088
To buy bangles.

1019
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,167
But l bought belts, l need them.

1020
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,221
Where is Sandhya?

1021
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:40,430
Why are you asking me suddenly?

1022
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,313
Sandhya will be at home,
why would she be here?

1023
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:44,932
Am l not here?
Why are you so scared?

1024
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,018
Why did you stop?

1025
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:04,800
What do you see?
- Houses!

1026
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:08,679
You can find burial grounds
and cemeteries also.

1027
01:08:09,033 --> 01:08:12,545
lf anyone plans to marry
an affluent girl and get rich,

1028
01:08:12,744 --> 01:08:15,590
they will be laid to rest
in graves from homes.

1029
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:22,714
How much ever great men may be,
all are confined to 6x3 grave only.

1030
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:25,891
The later you enter it,
the better.

1031
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:29,662
lf we forget about sooner or later,
your philosophy is very old,

1032
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:31,453
Graves will depend on
the power of men,

1033
01:08:31,652 --> 01:08:33,026
NTR's grave is a six acre place,

1034
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:34,713
lndira Gandhi's grave is
a 60 acre place,

1035
01:08:34,915 --> 01:08:37,085
stop your nonsense and
come to the point.

1036
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:38,556
Do you with whom you're speaking?

1037
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:40,575
Anyone is same to me,
you keep quiet.

1038
01:08:40,994 --> 01:08:41,495
You carry on.

1039
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:44,926
Whether you talk mad or silly,
l've soft corner for you,

1040
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,233
so l'm still talking to you,

1041
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:48,155
do you know whose men
you beat up now?

1042
01:08:48,352 --> 01:08:49,780
l don't know.
- Jakka's men!

1043
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:50,932
Who is he?

1044
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:56,211
l don't have enemies, only friends,
but he's my first enemy.

1045
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:13,296


1046
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:26,387
l was fearless and he scared me.

1047
01:09:36,661 --> 01:09:37,839
What happened?

1048
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:02,246
The bridge was built by Jakka.

1049
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:03,657
You don't know about Jakka.

1050
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:06,822
l don't know about him but l know
about the bridge he built.

1051
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,252
That's why Govt. asked me
to report on it, l'll do it.

1052
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,581
l'll make him pay the loss
from his pocket.

1053
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,631
Jakka is a dangerous man sir.

1054
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:18,439
l'm not scared of men like Jakka
but people of this country.

1055
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,608
ls it okay, dad?

1056
01:10:21,803 --> 01:10:23,526
Select a yellow shade,
you're going to be a bride soon.

1057
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,696
Okay dad.
Show me the yellow sari.

1058
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:28,449
Deliver personally, and post these.
- Okay.

1059
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:31,622
Pay advance to the marriage hall.
- Okay sir.

1060
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:36,071
Mr.Seshadri, greetings.
- Greetings, l'm coming.

1061
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,374
Are you from the groom's side?

1062
01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:40,542
No, we are Jakka's men,

1063
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:43,612
l'm Jakka's maternal uncle,
they are Jakka's friends,

1064
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:47,130
They will hack, kill or
do anything on order.

1065
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:50,050
There's nothing for you
here to hack or cut. You can go.

1066
01:10:50,244 --> 01:10:53,986
Look, road will have potholes,
bridges will fall,

1067
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,613
rockets launched in Sriharikota fail,
do we file cases against them?

1068
01:10:59,811 --> 01:11:02,177
lf you don't go now,
l'll file case against you.

1069
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:06,144
Listen and sign this papers
in our favour,

1070
01:11:06,337 --> 01:11:07,864
lf Jakka comes here,
he will handle different,

1071
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:09,625
What will he do?
l'll not sign.

1072
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:10,523
You must sign.

1073
01:11:23,262 --> 01:11:25,171
l'm Jakka, l'm a rogue,

1074
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:27,196
my uncle is much worse rogue.

1075
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:28,248
l swear he's right.

1076
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:31,024
Do you own a car, a house?

1077
01:11:31,323 --> 01:11:35,414
lf a poor man fights the rich,
he'll lose his life too. Sign it.

1078
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,585
lf you've influence,
settle it in the court ofjustice.

1079
01:11:37,786 --> 01:11:38,768
Not in my home.

1080
01:11:39,034 --> 01:11:39,797
Dad!

1081
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,256
Your daughter?

1082
01:11:48,024 --> 01:11:50,228
Where are you running away?
Co-operate with me dear...

1083
01:11:52,535 --> 01:11:54,225
Why are you banging the door?
ls it drums?

Sign this paper.
Your daughter will come out.

1085
01:11:56,758 --> 01:11:59,027
l'll sign as you say.
- Take the pen.

1086
01:12:06,644 --> 01:12:07,145
Daddy!

1087
01:12:07,347 --> 01:12:09,169
Come out, ourjob is done.

1088
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,987
My job is also over.

1089
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:16,301
Let's go.

1090
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,153
97!

1091
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:24,557
l see fear in your eyes, your voice,

1092
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,501
l must see the same fear
in everyone for me.

1093
01:12:57,577 --> 01:13:02,398
God took away everyone from me
for my honesty,

1094
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:04,834
took away my daughter too.

1095
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:11,044
You mustn't be crying,
the man who did this must cry.

1096
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:14,939
l'll not spare them for
doing this to you.

1097
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:16,098
l'll not spare them.

1098
01:13:18,116 --> 01:13:22,849
Engineer has sent a lawyer notice,
we must be in court on the 14th.

1099
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:25,723
Though he lost his daughter,
he still has some pride,

1100
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:28,632
it's been long since
l went to the court.

1101
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,266
Find a good lawyer.

1102
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:35,959
Nothing, you told me all the truths,

1103
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,501
l'll tell lies in the court.

1104
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:39,256
That's why we have come to you.

1105
01:13:39,455 --> 01:13:42,302
You raped the girl on September 1st,

1106
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:47,382
l'll create alibi of you having breakfast
with Abdul Kalam in Delhi.

1107
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:49,686
Would they believe our claim?

1108
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,786
Won't they? Then, let's create alibi of
meeting film stars Salman or Sanjay Dutt.

1109
01:13:52,988 --> 01:13:55,955
They are in jail, for killing deer
and smuggling weapons.

1110
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:57,977
l'll take care of it.

1111
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:01,912
Alibis are easy like creating
wigs for a bald head.

1112
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,250
Will he drink?

1113
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,377
He's my nephew.

1114
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,471
Then, no need to ask,
you have a peg and sleep peacefully.

1115
01:14:17,847 --> 01:14:20,213
His name is Shinde,
a big builder,

1116
01:14:20,406 --> 01:14:22,161
he has filed a case
with his support,

1117
01:14:23,957 --> 01:14:25,812
Are you fine Seshu?

1118
01:14:26,645 --> 01:14:27,572
Though your daughter is dead,

1119
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,705
l can't forget the happy time
l had with her.

1120
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:37,680
You're a businessman,
think about profits not laws.

1121
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:39,662
Every man who threatens is
not a courageous man,

1122
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:42,126
there's justice and truth above.

1123
01:14:49,295 --> 01:14:50,920
Do you've any evidence?

1124
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,828
l swear on God, it's true that the
bridge built by Jakka collapsed,

1125
01:14:55,214 --> 01:14:57,319
it's true l prepared reports on it,

1126
01:14:58,062 --> 01:15:01,225
it's true he raped and killed my daughter
who was about to marry,

1127
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:06,758
there are no evidences other
than the voice of my soul.

1128
01:15:08,299 --> 01:15:11,910
Court wants hard evidence
not the voices of souls,

1129
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:17,954
my client Jakka was in Care hospital
at the time he mentions.

1130
01:15:18,153 --> 01:15:19,713
Medical certificates for it.

1131
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:23,812
Jayaprakash was in Apsara hotel
in Rajahmundry on the same day,

1132
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:25,469
hotel bills of it.

1133
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:36,540
Look, how he's acting innocence.

1134
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:41,499
His nephew is a killer!

1135
01:15:46,787 --> 01:15:49,786
l can get such evidences
for few pennies.

1136
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:54,841
People tell truth with
doctors and lawyers,

1137
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:58,815
l've their statement of accepting
to their crimes in this CD.

1138
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,224
Did anyone see you raping her?

1139
01:16:03,423 --> 01:16:05,495
My nephew closed the
door and raped her.

1140
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:08,698
ls she alive?

1141
01:16:08,893 --> 01:16:10,867
She would've lived,
but he killed her.

1142
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:17,403
On the request of saving the
justice from my friend,

1143
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:19,122
when l'm arguing this case,

1144
01:16:19,548 --> 01:16:25,111
notjust friendship but
l feel proud honouring justice too.

1145
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:29,303
l humbly request your honour
to punish this criminal.

1146
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,729
The accused is found
guilty of the crime,

1147
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:35,373
Jaladangi Kameshwara Rao
alias Jakka,

1148
01:16:35,576 --> 01:16:38,324
is sentenced 6 years
rigorous imprisonment.

1149
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:43,372
Nephew!

1150
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:46,956
Why are you worried uncle?
l'm happy here.

1151
01:16:47,509 --> 01:16:49,680
There's power cut in city but not here.

1152
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:53,036
24 hours power,
Manjira water for bath,

1153
01:16:53,236 --> 01:16:55,657
an egg and half litre milk
everyday at morning 6 am,

1154
01:16:56,115 --> 01:16:59,792
l'm happy spending time watching films,
crime programs and news on TV.

1155
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:01,898
Do you think like that?

1156
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:06,349
They say jail will reform you,
no, l'm seething with rage to avenge,

1157
01:17:07,313 --> 01:17:10,312
those who were responsible for
sending me to jail must die.

1158
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,886
Let's kill them after you come out.

1159
01:17:12,272 --> 01:17:13,613
You got 6 years sentence only.

1160
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:15,911
2 years will be reduced
for good conduct.

1161
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:19,307
Public holidays will take
away another year.

1162
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:22,633
3 years remain.
lt'll be over in a jiffy.

1163
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:26,145
l can't wait for 3 years.
l'll kill them right now.

1164
01:17:26,381 --> 01:17:29,763
Sir, we have arranged for taking
you to NlMS hospital.

1165
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:32,833
You've 30 minutes only,
l'll lose job if it leaks out.

1166
01:17:40,681 --> 01:17:43,996
Hi Seshu! You're reading
newspaper today,

1167
01:17:44,424 --> 01:17:46,944
people will read about you
in tomorrow's newspaper.

1168
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:53,216
What are you doing?

1169
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:57,981
Your Seshu is dead!

1170
01:17:58,502 --> 01:18:00,890
l'm in jail as per the records.

1171
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,841
Killed your friend to avenge.

1172
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:07,195
l'll call you again, wait for my call.

1173
01:18:09,091 --> 01:18:12,090
Spare me...don't harm me...
please forgive me...

1174
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:14,973
Am l judge to forgive you?
l'm Jakka.

1175
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,469
lt's me!

1176
01:18:24,672 --> 01:18:27,453
Are you fine?
- l'm going to die,

1177
01:18:27,743 --> 01:18:31,288
he's coming for you.

1178
01:18:36,509 --> 01:18:38,613
You guessed it right.

1179
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,304
l'll kill your sister in 10 minutes.

1180
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:43,059
What did she do to you?

1181
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,910
l'm rotting in jail leaving my family,

1182
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:49,015
you must bereave for your family.

1183
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:52,020
Where is your sister?
l don't see her here.

1184
01:19:50,604 --> 01:19:51,334
What's it brother?

1185
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,244
Did anyone come home now?

1186
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:56,008
No, nobody came here.

1187
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,475
Why? What happened?

1188
01:19:58,602 --> 01:20:01,951
Nothing happened, don't go anywhere
without my permission.

1189
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:02,688
Why?

1190
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:05,118
Just do as l say.

1191
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,844
Why is your sister so beautiful?

1192
01:20:12,551 --> 01:20:15,366
Listen, generally when l see a girl,
l feel like raping her,

1193
01:20:15,558 --> 01:20:17,500
but l feel like marrying
on seeing your sister,

1194
01:20:17,702 --> 01:20:21,630
with the marriage l can have your
sister and avenge you also.

1195
01:20:22,213 --> 01:20:23,806
lf you try to get her married
to anyone else,

1196
01:20:23,973 --> 01:20:25,380
no groom will you find will live.

1197
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:26,750
l'll kill him.

1198
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,376
Keeping all this secret from my sister,

1199
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:33,757
l had to become a goon myself.

1200
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,514
l got one thing from your flashback,

1201
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:37,536
you're scared of Jakka
hurting your sister,

1202
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,388
give her to me, l'll take care of her.

1203
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,316
What can you do?

1204
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:42,105
What do you've to save
my sister from him?

1205
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:44,759
ls your sister Kashmir border
to fail in saving her?

1206
01:20:45,184 --> 01:20:47,355
l'm sparing you for courtesy.

1207
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,900
Did l come all the way from
Vijayawada to get killed here?

1208
01:20:51,103 --> 01:20:53,524
l'm warning you to leave
my sister and this city.

1209
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:55,321
l'll leave this city but
not your sister.

1210
01:20:55,486 --> 01:20:56,565
Won't you get your sister married off?

1211
01:20:56,766 --> 01:20:58,227
You will, won't you?
Then why not marry her off to me.

1212
01:20:58,429 --> 01:21:00,251
Should l give her to
a useless guy like you?

1213
01:21:00,445 --> 01:21:02,168
lf you earn money,
even a goon is good man,

1214
01:21:02,364 --> 01:21:05,047
even rich will not have
four times of what l have,

1215
01:21:05,244 --> 01:21:06,105
they have the same things
that l have think again.

1216
01:21:06,683 --> 01:21:11,057
Brother....come...come...
- You...bloody...

1217
01:21:11,258 --> 01:21:14,803
Go, Jakka will play with your life.

1218
01:21:15,673 --> 01:21:19,185
lf l take Sandhya from him,
it'll create problems,

1219
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:21,237
what should l do now?

1220
01:21:23,544 --> 01:21:26,161
Jakka is torturing
my brother-in-law Shinde,

1221
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:29,424
what if l start torturing Jakka himself?

1222
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,725
That will solve all the problems.

1223
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:43,470
What if my nephew asks
about these wounds?

1224
01:21:43,603 --> 01:21:44,912
We'll say a man in Sultan Bazaar beat us.

1225
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,016
Tell him the truth and
he'll kill you inside the jail.

1226
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,453
Boss hates lies.

1227
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:52,170
He's not so intelligent to
find it it's lie or truth.

1228
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:55,183
He's a mad man,
he'll believe whatever we say.

1229
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,567
l'll manage, you just keep quiet
- Okay boss.

1230
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:02,408
Nephew, a good news!
You'll be freed day after tomorrow.

1231
01:22:02,606 --> 01:22:03,370
l know.

1232
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:05,162
Why are they hurt?

1233
01:22:05,358 --> 01:22:08,041
We went to bangle bazaar...
- Shut up, you bloody!

1234
01:22:08,813 --> 01:22:13,035
They tried to avoid hitting a boy
and hit a tree,

1235
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:16,577
they fell from the vehicle
and got hurt. That's all!

1236
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,081
Are you surprized how could so many
get hurt in a single accident?

1237
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:21,418
Don't 100 people die in
a single bomb blast?

1238
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,038
Didn't believe us?

1239
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,617
Okay then, come out what you
think it must be.

1240
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:33,566
You went to bangle bazaar for Sandhya
and a lone man beat you all.

1241
01:22:33,767 --> 01:22:36,134
Beat us?
Who can dare do it in Hyderabad?

1242
01:22:40,134 --> 01:22:41,508
He's the man who beat us.

1243
01:22:41,702 --> 01:22:42,268
l know.

1244
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,891
Why are you supporting him
without killing him?

1245
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,434
Why should l kill him?

1246
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:47,523
He loves Sandhya.

1247
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:49,145
l told everything to Jakka sir.

1248
01:22:50,468 --> 01:22:54,396
My family was humiliated in
the process of dating her,

1249
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,351
she cheated after
going steady with me,

1250
01:22:56,547 --> 01:22:57,823
her brother threatened to kill me,

1251
01:22:58,018 --> 01:22:58,749
didn't l tell you now?

1252
01:22:58,946 --> 01:23:00,190
Why did you come here then?

1253
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:01,793
l want someone to succeed,

1254
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:04,090
l want Jakka to succeed where l failed.

1255
01:23:04,385 --> 01:23:07,646
When Jakka takes Sandhya,
l want to see her brother's feelings,

1256
01:23:08,032 --> 01:23:10,104
Jakka sir, you must fulfill my wish.

1257
01:23:10,304 --> 01:23:11,448
l'll fulfill, you may go now.

1258
01:23:11,648 --> 01:23:12,662
Where can l go sir?

1259
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:14,652
l'm scared of going alone,
l fear an attack from Shinde.

1260
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:15,795
l'll stay along with your men.

1261
01:23:15,998 --> 01:23:17,208
Where will you stay?

1262
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:18,268
On my head?

1263
01:23:18,462 --> 01:23:19,477
Jakka sir

1264
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:20,661
Come!

1265
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:30,456
Brother, Krishna beat us all,
why boss is forcing him on us?

1266
01:23:30,651 --> 01:23:35,352
Anyone who praises Sandhya and
hates Shinde is dear to Jakka.

1267
01:23:35,834 --> 01:23:39,990
Why Krishna has come to Jakka?
What could be his motive?

1268
01:23:40,665 --> 01:23:41,679
Call him.

1269
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,982
Called me sir?

1270
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,716
Let's have drinks.

1271
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:48,016
No sir, l speak logic when l'm drunk.

1272
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:50,637
Join me, have it.

1273
01:23:50,839 --> 01:23:51,766
come on just have it

1274
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:53,714
That's too much,
just the bottle cap is enough.

1275
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,706
Bottle cap?

1276
01:23:55,574 --> 01:23:56,555
How much can it hold?

1277
01:23:56,758 --> 01:23:58,001
Cap is enough.

1278
01:23:58,197 --> 01:23:58,928
Pour!

1279
01:24:04,084 --> 01:24:13,640


1280
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:55,616
Why is he shouting like a Godzilla?

1281
01:24:18,673 --> 01:24:19,818
l'll go home, boss.

1282
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:22,285
My wife is getting angry for coming
late to home everyday.

1283
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:26,604
Shall we talk?

1284
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:28,390
We can...

1285
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:29,483
What do you want?

1286
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,826
Why did you come to Jakka?
What's your motive?

1287
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:36,396
Forget about my motives and plans,

1288
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:38,563
you eat, drink and live luxuriously,

1289
01:24:38,764 --> 01:24:40,803
what's your source of income?

1290
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:42,567
Tell him.

1291
01:24:42,763 --> 01:24:43,526
We do settlements.

1292
01:24:43,723 --> 01:24:44,224
Settlement?

1293
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:45,190
You come here.

1294
01:24:46,026 --> 01:24:46,920
Come here!

1295
01:24:48,842 --> 01:24:49,289
Tell me now.

1296
01:24:49,482 --> 01:24:49,929
Settlements.

1297
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:50,884
Sit down.

1298
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,737
Sit down.

1299
01:24:54,345 --> 01:24:55,108
Settlement...?

1300
01:24:55,528 --> 01:24:56,608
We settle things,

1301
01:24:56,808 --> 01:25:00,353
we occupy land, create problems
and then settle the problem,

1302
01:25:00,423 --> 01:25:01,317
and take money for it.

1303
01:25:02,886 --> 01:25:03,617
lsn't it injustice?

1304
01:25:03,943 --> 01:25:07,291
You earn unjustly using Jakka's
name and enjoy drinks,

1305
01:25:07,526 --> 01:25:12,282
and moreover get me also drunk,

1306
01:25:12,517 --> 01:25:13,280
Hey senior man!

1307
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:13,978
Yes boss

1308
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,740
Why are you slipping away without
hearing my motives and plans?

1309
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,459
l've diabetes, l want to eat
and sleep on time.

1310
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:19,706
Don't you want to hear my plans?

1311
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,565
l'll hear tomorrow morning,
you too go home boys.

1312
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:22,940
Hey...

1313
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:25,178
lf you go to sleep and
they go to homes, why did l drink then?

1314
01:25:25,377 --> 01:25:27,264
That's too much,
you had just a cap full.

1315
01:25:27,361 --> 01:25:30,295
Don't worry how much we had but
worry how much kick it gave.

1316
01:25:31,009 --> 01:25:35,285
l'm asking you ignorantly do you need six
Scorpios and so many henchmen?

1317
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,058
Can't you go alone?

1318
01:25:36,255 --> 01:25:37,302
No...

1319
01:25:38,814 --> 01:25:39,261
Where was l?

1320
01:25:39,455 --> 01:25:40,698
You stopped at Scorpios.

1321
01:25:40,894 --> 01:25:42,355
You create traffic jams,

1322
01:25:42,558 --> 01:25:46,266
when you stop at signal, six vehicles
stop in uniform one behind the other,

1323
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:47,706
100 other vehicles stop behind it,

1324
01:25:47,837 --> 01:25:50,520
how public are inconvenienced and
creates problems to them?

1325
01:25:50,716 --> 01:25:51,731
Please leave my boss.

1326
01:25:51,932 --> 01:25:54,615
When did l hold him? Bloody!

1327
01:25:54,811 --> 01:25:58,804
l'm just talking to him.

1328
01:26:00,729 --> 01:26:03,827
l was watching TV, why are you leaving
without hearing my plans?

1329
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:06,992
Don't make nuisance, go to sleep.

1330
01:26:07,192 --> 01:26:09,330
l'll not sleep unless you hear my plans
Get down.

1331
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:12,047
l can't go up and down, l get tired.

1332
01:26:12,247 --> 01:26:16,850
You're weak but were shouting at the top
of voice to kill me and get Sandhya.

1333
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:19,249
No need of those stories now.

1334
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:20,915
Then what stories shall we discuss?

1335
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,970
Stories? ls it time to tell stories?

1336
01:26:25,204 --> 01:26:29,262
You're getting irritated,
l'll have a drink.- l can't take it anymore.

1337
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:33,870
Should l hide my sister
like a coward fearing him?

1338
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:37,065
Your sister is his target
Think of her safety first.

1339
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:42,156
l feel you'll be safe if you send Sandhya
to foreign before he comes out.

1340
01:26:42,352 --> 01:26:43,693
Think again.

1341
01:26:47,248 --> 01:26:50,563
Brother, l'm going,
time to catch the bus.

1342
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:51,497
Where?

1343
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:54,246
You brought a problem from Vijayawada
and rubbed it on me.

1344
01:26:54,446 --> 01:26:55,907
You're confused, brother.

1345
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:58,564
l didn't bring him,
he brought me here.

1346
01:26:58,924 --> 01:27:03,713
l tried my best to avoid him,
but l had to give in for blackmail.

1347
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:04,930
Blackmail?

1348
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:07,016
l can't tell you, brother.

1349
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,323
Enough of what you've told me,

1350
01:27:08,842 --> 01:27:09,987
l'm sending Sandhya abroad,

1351
01:27:10,186 --> 01:27:13,797
till she leaves lndia,
nobody in this home must go out.

1352
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:17,760
You've gone crazy!

1353
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,902
Forget about abroad, you can't send
Sandhya to Ameerpet also.

1354
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,934
Krishna will come and take her.

1355
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:39,897


1356
01:31:35,103 --> 01:31:36,832
l'll kidnap you..

1357
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,156
l'll hug you...

1358
01:27:52,353 --> 01:27:54,109
l'll make you sweat it out...

1359
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:57,688
l'll spellbound you...

1360
01:27:57,887 --> 01:27:59,610
l'll make you swoon...

1361
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,465
l'll make you go crazy...

1362
01:28:03,423 --> 01:28:06,488
O baby, l'll show my prowess...

1363
01:28:06,686 --> 01:28:10,646
O baby, l'll make you go bonkers...

1364
01:28:12,476 --> 01:28:15,890
l'll make desires into a dagger...

1365
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:19,920
l'll pierce into you with vengeance...

1366
01:28:20,154 --> 01:28:23,666
Come Krishna...Radhakrishna...

1367
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:27,280
Useless funny Krishna...

1368
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,365
Go away Krishna...

1369
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,571
Take my youth, Krishna...

1370
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:57,192


1371
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,217
l'll kiss you in sun
and hug you in rain...

1372
01:29:16,174 --> 01:29:19,817
lf it rains in sun,
l'll give myself to you...

1373
01:29:20,077 --> 01:29:23,491
l'll attack from every direction...

1374
01:29:23,693 --> 01:29:27,489
Without worrying about the rules,
l'll take on and have you...

1375
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:31,138
l'll stop your advances...

1376
01:29:31,339 --> 01:29:34,883
l'll never stop my game...

1377
01:29:35,082 --> 01:29:36,707
Boy, l'll make you sweat...

1378
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:38,531
Boy, l'll keep hurdles for you...

1379
01:29:38,729 --> 01:29:41,860
Boy, l'll make you run for your money...

1380
01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:44,226
Girl, l'll make you seek it...

1381
01:29:44,424 --> 01:29:46,147
Girl, l'll take on you...

1382
01:29:46,343 --> 01:29:49,245
Girl, l'll fall on you and have you...

1383
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:57,571
l like you, rowdy Krishna...

1384
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:05,049
Krishna who loves to have me...

1385
01:30:13,057 --> 01:30:22,613


1386
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:30,074
l'll give if you keep quiet...

1387
01:30:36,572 --> 01:30:38,230
l'll give two if you make a wish...

1388
01:30:38,428 --> 01:30:42,202
lf you tie the knot with me,
l'll give my next seven lives to you...

1389
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:45,782
l'll give little if you ask,
l'll much more if you don't ask...

1390
01:30:45,978 --> 01:30:49,720
lf you become my life partner,
l'll give my life...

1391
01:30:49,913 --> 01:30:53,393
l'll leave my home for you....

1392
01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:57,203
Come, l'll make my heart
your residence...

1393
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:04,076
Boy, l'll take on you, l'll give myself
and become your life partner...

1394
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:08,494
Girl, l'll carry you,
l'll make my heart your bed...

1395
01:31:08,693 --> 01:31:11,627
Girl, l'll make you the
mother of my child...

1396
01:31:16,243 --> 01:31:19,919
l like you, naughty Krishna...

1397
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:27,623
Your love is all mine...

1398
01:31:53,068 --> 01:31:53,733
Go!

1399
01:32:02,697 --> 01:32:03,428
Come.

1400
01:32:04,904 --> 01:32:07,359
lt's been long since l saw
you in civil dress,

1401
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,869
no need to kidnap Sandhya
if she sees you now,

1402
01:32:09,064 --> 01:32:10,176
she'll come to you on her own.

1403
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:12,098
Sandhya is not here to accept.
- Then?

1404
01:32:12,295 --> 01:32:16,222
5 minutes earlier Shinde took her
to airport to send her abroad.

1405
01:32:16,422 --> 01:32:18,658
We were out but didn't know it,
how could you know it sitting in jail?

1406
01:32:18,853 --> 01:32:20,478
Fools know only half.

1407
01:32:20,965 --> 01:32:21,531
Give it.

1408
01:32:21,861 --> 01:32:23,355
Sign it.

1409
01:32:23,716 --> 01:32:26,269
Sir, Krishna has sent this
Goddess offering to you.

1410
01:32:26,467 --> 01:32:27,580
He's a schemer!

1411
01:32:27,779 --> 01:32:30,680
He came with us, why did he send
you instead of giving it to us?

1412
01:32:30,883 --> 01:32:33,664
You forced him on us
getting angry with Shinde.

1413
01:32:33,858 --> 01:32:36,639
The scene he created after
drinking a cap full,

1414
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,767
for his wild abuses, l had even toyed
with the idea of killing myself.

1415
01:32:39,969 --> 01:32:41,081
Send him out.

1416
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,149
lf you say it gain,
l'll send you out first.

1417
01:32:50,655 --> 01:32:51,898
Did you get Goddess' offering?

1418
01:32:52,094 --> 01:32:54,330
He got it.
Stop your overacting now.

1419
01:32:54,686 --> 01:32:58,460
ls my eagerness of Jakka coming out
to fulfill my wish is overacting?

1420
01:32:58,652 --> 01:32:59,634
Look at him sir.

1421
01:32:59,836 --> 01:33:02,324
l'll fulfill your wish today itself.

1422
01:33:02,524 --> 01:33:03,255
Come, let's go and bring Sandhya.

1423
01:33:03,451 --> 01:33:05,174
How can you announce it so suddenly?

1424
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,574
l'm not prepared,
l haven't planned anything.- Plan?

1425
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:09,974
l mean plan...for his marriage...

1426
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:12,057
l'm tensed...
- Don't get tensed.

1427
01:33:12,249 --> 01:33:14,038
Come.
- Okay.

1428
01:33:29,046 --> 01:33:32,045
Airport is under our control,
don't try to act smart.

1429
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:49,095


1430
01:38:06,027 --> 01:38:10,862
Are you sending your sister
abroad fearing me?

1431
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:09,478
l'll not break my promise,

1432
01:34:09,676 --> 01:34:12,676
l'll marry your sister...
- No need to discuss with him.

1433
01:34:12,876 --> 01:34:13,803
Get Sandhya, let's go.

1434
01:34:13,996 --> 01:34:19,046
You were after my sister till yesterday,
have you joined his ranks now?

1435
01:34:19,786 --> 01:34:20,484
l'll not spare you both.

1436
01:34:20,682 --> 01:34:22,983
Look at him Jakka, how dare
he warns me in your presence.

1437
01:34:23,178 --> 01:34:24,290
Put your hand my shoulders.

1438
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:28,545
Nobody can harm me
when l'm with Jakka sir.

1439
01:34:28,745 --> 01:34:30,402
Jakka sir.
- What?

1440
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,294
l must tell him something.

1441
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,327
Sir, though l don't know you personally,

1442
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:38,149
l want to tell you something,

1443
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:43,522
the man next to you
is epitome of trouble.- Shut up!

1444
01:34:43,717 --> 01:34:45,855
Get Sandhya, let's go.

1445
01:34:48,324 --> 01:34:51,639
Jakka, don't take away my sister...
- Brother...

1446
01:34:59,425 --> 01:35:00,832
Jakka sir, you mustn't sit here,

1447
01:35:01,025 --> 01:35:02,585
you must sit next to Sandhya,
get down...

1448
01:35:12,703 --> 01:35:15,702
Your countdown has started,
he'll not come back.

1449
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,267
Hail Lord Ayyappa!

1450
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:29,496
Why aren't they following us?

1451
01:37:29,696 --> 01:37:31,551
You want them to follow?
l can't drive anymore.

1452
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:41,551
How long can we run?
They are fast catching us.

1453
01:38:41,808 --> 01:38:43,084
ls it? Come...

1454
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,246
What are you doing?
- You carry on, l'll follow you.

1455
01:39:00,876 --> 01:39:02,021
l can't swim, boss.

1456
01:39:02,987 --> 01:39:05,158
lt's too high, my back is weak.

1457
01:39:10,601 --> 01:39:12,510
You can't your head for
someone losing his nail,

1458
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:13,760
let him go,

1459
01:39:14,057 --> 01:39:17,352
l'll get his entire family
at your feet.

1460
01:39:17,544 --> 01:39:18,951
He'll be forced to come
to you with her.

1461
01:39:19,144 --> 01:39:20,485
You take rest.

1462
01:39:21,159 --> 01:39:26,755


1463
01:43:43,531 --> 01:43:45,089
What are you doing brother?

1464
01:39:28,741 --> 01:39:31,075
That rogue isn't in station,
so l'm eating peacefully.

1465
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:32,610
Enough of eating,

1466
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:35,674
take the entire family and shift
to Alankar theatre centre.

1467
01:39:35,876 --> 01:39:38,112
We are at Mangaldeep,
coming there, let's meet there.

1468
01:39:38,308 --> 01:39:40,576
Any Chiranjeevi film has released?

1469
01:39:40,771 --> 01:39:45,276
No, your brother Krishna
has kidnapped Sandhya,

1470
01:39:45,474 --> 01:39:47,328
there were car chases too,

1471
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:49,855
if you stay at home,
they will lynch you.

1472
01:39:50,529 --> 01:39:53,212
Won't he allow us to live peacefully?

1473
01:39:53,408 --> 01:39:55,099
This is not new to you,

1474
01:39:55,295 --> 01:40:00,116
ask Bobby's wife to leave
for her parent's home.

1475
01:40:00,383 --> 01:40:01,692
Has he involved them also?

1476
01:40:01,886 --> 01:40:04,406
He's capable of involving anyone
with him including PM.

1477
01:40:04,701 --> 01:40:07,319
They are around the street corner,
leave immediately.

1478
01:40:07,516 --> 01:40:09,207
No employee also would've been
transferred so many times.

1479
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:11,706
l'm ready.
- Do you know it?

1480
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,940
l understood when you
mentioned about tension.

1481
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:16,048
Krishna will always do it good only.

1482
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:19,599
Please don't praise him.
- Shall we leave?

1483
01:40:19,802 --> 01:40:21,078
Where are we going daddy?

1484
01:40:21,274 --> 01:40:23,859
lnto the lake.
- You carry on, l can't swim.

1485
01:40:26,393 --> 01:40:27,919
Dad, you didn't take my books.

1486
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,453
No need of it when on a run.
Shut up and come.

1487
01:40:31,415 --> 01:40:33,302
May it's the goons,
if caught we are finished.

1488
01:40:33,495 --> 01:40:34,443
Let's go quickly.

1489
01:40:37,654 --> 01:40:38,483
Hey mister!

1490
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,497
You only...come here.

1491
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,545
l'm dead. What's it sir?

1492
01:40:47,476 --> 01:40:50,192
Where is MRO Chandrasekhar's house?

1493
01:40:50,931 --> 01:40:54,279
Go straight and turn left,
first house on the right side.

1494
01:40:54,483 --> 01:40:55,049
Upstairs.

1495
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,005
You go, you start.

1496
01:40:57,554 --> 01:41:00,455
Bloody....one minute.

1497
01:41:01,809 --> 01:41:03,270
Do you know him well?

1498
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:06,092
We live in the same colony,
so l know him.

1499
01:41:06,288 --> 01:41:07,367
l don't know him,

1500
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:10,982
he may refuse he's not him,
come with me and identify him.

1501
01:41:11,183 --> 01:41:13,287
He's not a man like that.
He is a respectable man...

1502
01:41:13,486 --> 01:41:15,624
What respect?
He is a bloody rascal!

1503
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,324
His brother eloped with our girl.

1504
01:41:17,517 --> 01:41:20,102
We are looking for him.

1505
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:24,555
lf we rip Chandrasekar's skin,
his brother will come out.

1506
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:26,821
Why will he come out?

1507
01:41:27,019 --> 01:41:28,296
l asked you his address
and you told me.

1508
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:31,207
Similarly, if l rip his skin off,
his brother will come out.

1509
01:41:31,402 --> 01:41:34,369
Everything is inter connected.
Get inside the car.

1510
01:41:34,761 --> 01:41:38,470
Actually...
- We are getting late for the bus.

1511
01:41:38,664 --> 01:41:40,420
Come.- l'm coming.
We'll drop you at the bus stop.

1512
01:41:40,616 --> 01:41:41,859
Stop bugging him.
Get inside the car.

1513
01:41:42,056 --> 01:41:43,878
l've a small request.
- What?

1514
01:41:44,071 --> 01:41:46,111
We are one of the decent family
living in this colony.

1515
01:41:46,311 --> 01:41:47,521
Please don't drag us into trouble.

1516
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:50,401
You talk like a gentleman.
Okay, go.

1517
01:41:51,077 --> 01:41:51,841
Sir...
- What?

1518
01:41:52,037 --> 01:41:54,720
A photo of the person you
search would be helpful.

1519
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:56,672
l asked you the address not advice.

1520
01:41:56,869 --> 01:41:58,494
Wouldn't l show you if l had one?
We have nothing.

1521
01:41:58,692 --> 01:41:59,739
Go.
- Okay.

1522
01:42:04,067 --> 01:42:06,455
Looks like there is no one at home.
- Break the lock.

1523
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:08,248
We will get their photos atleast.

1524
01:42:09,825 --> 01:42:12,542
Search every nook & corner.
Make it fast.

1525
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:18,743
There is not even one photo
in the house.

1526
01:42:18,944 --> 01:42:22,205
l doubt the person who guided us to
this address might be Chandrasekar.

1527
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:25,492
Do l look like an idiot?

1528
01:42:25,694 --> 01:42:27,352
l can find a man just like that.

1529
01:42:27,549 --> 01:42:29,687
l'm more powerful than police.

1530
01:42:29,885 --> 01:42:31,924
Boss...- What?
- Look here.

1531
01:42:35,132 --> 01:42:36,789
This is the first time someone
has fooled me.

1532
01:42:36,987 --> 01:42:38,775
You say this everytime.
- l heard you.

1533
01:42:38,971 --> 01:42:40,825
l'll crush your neck.

1534
01:42:41,019 --> 01:42:42,328
lf our boss comes to know this,
he might kill us all.

1535
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:44,977
l won't tell him.
You don't tell him either.

1536
01:42:48,377 --> 01:42:49,042
What? Did you get them?

1537
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:50,833
l found their house.
But l couldn't get them.

1538
01:42:51,032 --> 01:42:51,926
They have escaped.

1539
01:42:53,207 --> 01:42:54,963
Their family seems to be very tricky.

1540
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,232
They fooled us in broad day light.

1541
01:42:57,719 --> 01:42:59,890
What should l do now?
- Go and suck...

1542
01:43:00,886 --> 01:43:01,333
Shit!

1543
01:43:01,526 --> 01:43:03,348
What did he say?
- l can't say that.

1544
01:43:03,542 --> 01:43:05,516
l have to do his job.
ldiot!

1545
01:43:05,749 --> 01:43:07,275
Why stand here? Let's go.

1546
01:43:07,477 --> 01:43:10,346
Your sister escaped from here.

1547
01:43:10,548 --> 01:43:13,068
l'll bring her at any cost.

1548
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:15,662
And l will marry her.

1549
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:17,582
Till then, this is your fate.

1550
01:43:23,793 --> 01:43:27,437
What shall do with him, boss?
- He is good in whistling.

1551
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:32,840
Let's make him whistle.
Whistle once.

1552
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:35,817
C'mon do it.

1553
01:43:37,102 --> 01:43:39,206
l never expected you'll take
this matter so serious.

1554
01:43:39,693 --> 01:43:44,548
When he took away Sandhya,
it looked funny to you.

1555
01:43:44,748 --> 01:43:45,511
This is similar to that.

1556
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,874
Whistle just once.
Do it.

1557
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,794
l can whistle when l am tensed.

1558
01:43:50,987 --> 01:43:53,092
lt's alright. Whistle once.
Try.

1559
01:43:54,538 --> 01:43:55,301
l can't.

1560
01:43:55,498 --> 01:43:56,425
C'mon, whistle.

1561
01:43:57,130 --> 01:44:00,577
lnstead of torturing me, why don't you
buy a whistle for a few pennies.

1562
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,053
Buy it & whistle as you like.

1563
01:44:03,144 --> 01:44:04,770
Please don't stare at me.

1564
01:44:04,968 --> 01:44:10,018
Make him whistle until he
the sound is loud & clear.

1565
01:44:10,823 --> 01:44:13,691
lt must be better than that
at the airport.

1566
01:44:19,908 --> 01:44:22,657
Can a beautiful sister
be so troublesome?

1567
01:44:27,683 --> 01:44:28,576
Open it.

1568
01:44:28,771 --> 01:44:30,593
Why drink early morning?

1569
01:44:30,946 --> 01:44:31,741
Your health will get spoiled.

1570
01:44:31,938 --> 01:44:34,490
lt's not tonic to drink on time.
lt's brandy.

1571
01:44:34,689 --> 01:44:35,255
lf there is someone
to buy one for you,

1572
01:44:35,457 --> 01:44:37,344
drink at anytime & anywhere you like.

1573
01:44:37,536 --> 01:44:39,511
Get me a sprite.
- He won't give me.

1574
01:44:39,712 --> 01:44:40,606
You go & get it.

1575
01:44:41,856 --> 01:44:43,165
Give me sprite.

1576
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:45,334
First give me my dues.
- Add this to my account.

1577
01:44:45,535 --> 01:44:47,836
This is not a god's name to write everyday.
lt's a debt.

1578
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:48,978
A bank must sanction loans.

1579
01:44:49,181 --> 01:44:50,610
A hotel must give credit.
Can't avoid it.

1580
01:44:50,813 --> 01:44:51,347
l won't give you.

1581
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:52,956
Why won't you give me?

1582
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:55,570
Govt. sanctions loans to the
poor at low interest rates.

1583
01:44:55,772 --> 01:44:57,747
America gives loans to Japan
trusting their technology.

1584
01:44:57,948 --> 01:44:59,987
Can't you give me a soft drink
worth Rs. 7?

1585
01:45:00,188 --> 01:45:01,115
No matter how many logic
you try to tell him,

1586
01:45:01,307 --> 01:45:02,255
he won't give you a sprite.

1587
01:45:02,683 --> 01:45:08,726
l can leave a sprite but not liquor.
Get me some water.

1588
01:45:15,608 --> 01:45:16,077
Boy...

1589
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:19,214
Excuse me. He is busy. l'm idle.
Let's talk now.

1590
01:45:19,415 --> 01:45:22,578
Tell me what it is.
- My girl is missing.

1591
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:23,984
Missing or eloped?

1592
01:45:24,406 --> 01:45:25,453
Eloped.

1593
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:28,370
We polishly say that she is missing.

1594
01:45:28,565 --> 01:45:30,158
With whom did she elope?
Tell me the time & the reason.

1595
01:45:30,356 --> 01:45:32,211
A girl whom my nephew wanted to marry

1596
01:45:32,404 --> 01:45:33,746
eloped with a boy from Vijayawada.

1597
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:36,721
lf he could elope with your girl with

1598
01:45:36,916 --> 01:45:37,777
you, your henchmen and
car around you,

1599
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:38,637
he must be a superman.

1600
01:45:38,835 --> 01:45:40,013
l will burn you to death.

1601
01:45:40,499 --> 01:45:41,327
l understood your concept.

1602
01:45:41,522 --> 01:45:42,449
l have to find him and
hand him over to you.

1603
01:45:42,642 --> 01:45:44,234
How much is the deal?
- As much as you like.

1604
01:45:44,434 --> 01:45:45,230
Then, give me his photo.
- l don't have.

1605
01:45:45,425 --> 01:45:46,407
Give me the details.

1606
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:49,260
My daughter is Sandhya,
very cute & beautiful.

1607
01:45:49,456 --> 01:45:51,179
And boys looks like rogue
with uncombed hair.

1608
01:45:51,376 --> 01:45:51,823
How do you know that?

1609
01:45:52,016 --> 01:45:54,056
Such beautiful girls fall
for such guys only.

1610
01:45:54,255 --> 01:45:54,953
You were absolutely right.

1611
01:45:55,152 --> 01:45:57,704
Give me your contact phone.
- Tell him.

1612
01:45:58,415 --> 01:45:59,462
Know that from him.

1613
01:46:01,838 --> 01:46:03,146
Don't cut the phone when you're asleep.

1614
01:46:03,341 --> 01:46:04,966
l will call you when l find them.

1615
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:07,914
We come across only idiots.
Come, let's go.

1616
01:46:08,876 --> 01:46:12,007
Why would someone who eloped
from Hyderabad come here?

1617
01:46:13,675 --> 01:46:15,497
This brandy was manufactured
in Bangalore.

1618
01:46:15,691 --> 01:46:17,479
But it has come here.
Am l not drinking?

1619
01:46:17,674 --> 01:46:19,910
Similarly, if our times are good,
he might come to our place.

1620
01:46:20,106 --> 01:46:21,764
And we will catch him?
- Actually...

1621
01:46:26,184 --> 01:46:27,591
Boss...
- What?

1622
01:46:27,784 --> 01:46:28,864
Look there.

1623
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:37,379
They might be the eloped lovers.
Shall l call them?

1624
01:46:37,574 --> 01:46:39,068
lf you were wrong, they will beat us.

1625
01:46:39,269 --> 01:46:40,862
Don't be tensed.
Let's confirm

1626
01:46:41,093 --> 01:46:42,467
How to go to Vijayawada?

1627
01:46:42,661 --> 01:46:44,416
Where are you coming from?
- Hyderabad.

1628
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,431
Shall l dial the number?

1629
01:46:46,852 --> 01:46:48,673
There is no facilities to
go to Vijayawada today?

1630
01:46:48,867 --> 01:46:50,208
Can l get a hotel to stay?

1631
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:51,810
There is no hotel or food to eat.

1632
01:46:52,002 --> 01:46:52,863
How come you're here then?

1633
01:46:53,058 --> 01:46:54,203
What we said is for the strangers.

1634
01:46:54,402 --> 01:46:55,809
You say that you don't have anything.
But you have a mobile.

1635
01:46:56,002 --> 01:46:57,889
There will be network even
in waterless village.

1636
01:46:58,081 --> 01:46:59,128
Do you know psychology?

1637
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:01,270
lndians can survive without eating
but not without talking.

1638
01:47:01,473 --> 01:47:02,934
Just like you.
- Good guess.

1639
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,392
l have a love house.
l give shelter to lovers only.

1640
01:47:06,591 --> 01:47:07,638
What is bugging you then?

1641
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:10,457
Giving shelter to lovers is my hobby.

1642
01:47:10,782 --> 01:47:12,308
She looks like Goddess Lakshmi.

1643
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,517
ls her name Lakshmi?
- No. Sandhya.

1644
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,944
Shall l call them?
- Go & cook.

1645
01:47:20,252 --> 01:47:22,740
Clothes to wear.
Bindis, rugs to cover yourself.

1646
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:25,328
We don't need them.
We will leave by tomorrow morning.

1647
01:47:26,299 --> 01:47:28,632
You came here to enjoy
and not to irritate.

1648
01:47:28,826 --> 01:47:31,695
Eat, drink & enjoy.
l made these arrangements.

1649
01:47:31,897 --> 01:47:33,304
People invest on land.

1650
01:47:33,498 --> 01:47:35,319
But you have invested on lovers.

1651
01:47:35,513 --> 01:47:37,236
A land can't get you another one.

1652
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:40,045
But lovers can give birth
to thousands of lovers.

1653
01:47:40,312 --> 01:47:43,628
l want love to spread
all over the world.

1654
01:47:43,831 --> 01:47:45,521
Then, it is the population
which will grow not love.

1655
01:47:45,846 --> 01:47:47,471
What?
- Nothing.

1656
01:47:49,877 --> 01:47:51,600
Hey Sunil.
- We met the priestjust now.

1657
01:47:51,797 --> 01:47:52,974
5th seems to be an auspicious day.

1658
01:47:53,173 --> 01:47:53,838
Will you be able to come here on time?

1659
01:47:54,037 --> 01:47:56,786
Will be there on time.
We got a scapegoat here.

1660
01:47:57,204 --> 01:47:59,658
l heard some noise when you turned.
- l don't know.

1661
01:48:00,116 --> 01:48:01,773
When will you send us out?
- Tomorrow.

1662
01:48:01,971 --> 01:48:05,069
We will come tomorrow.
We have to arrange many things.

1663
01:48:05,298 --> 01:48:06,542
The marriage must be very grand one.

1664
01:48:06,738 --> 01:48:07,850
lt'll be sensational!, you come.

1665
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:09,610
Whose marriage?
- Ours.

1666
01:48:10,033 --> 01:48:10,981
You can turn now.

1667
01:48:11,377 --> 01:48:12,522
l heard no sound now.

1668
01:48:12,816 --> 01:48:14,409
Not everytime!

1669
01:48:15,504 --> 01:48:18,537
My marriage is on 5th in Durga temple.
You all must come.

1670
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:21,123
Why are you marrying in that temple?

1671
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:23,044
We first met in that temple only.

1672
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:25,580
So, we want to get married there.
- Superb.

1673
01:48:25,838 --> 01:48:27,812
You lock the door from inside.
l will lock it from outside.

1674
01:48:27,949 --> 01:48:29,640
Why lock the door?
- For safety.

1675
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:32,904
Give me the keys.
- l will lock it.

1676
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,823
Don't you trust me.
- No, l don't.

1677
01:48:35,884 --> 01:48:36,712
Don't get shocked. Come.

1678
01:48:36,907 --> 01:48:39,143
Boss, shall we eat?
Why delay?

1679
01:48:39,338 --> 01:48:43,396
The longer the wine & scotch
are buried, its price goes up.

1680
01:48:43,594 --> 01:48:46,659
The longer we keep these lovers here,
the higher the money is.

1681
01:48:46,856 --> 01:48:48,263
We will get lot of money.

1682
01:48:48,457 --> 01:48:50,115
lf you stay close to me,
l will be disturbed.

1683
01:48:50,312 --> 01:48:51,653
Go & see what they are doing.

1684
01:48:51,848 --> 01:48:54,084
l've locked it.
What bothers us?

1685
01:48:55,015 --> 01:48:56,957
Lovers are more dangerous
than terrorists.

1686
01:48:57,159 --> 01:49:00,158
lf they could fool so many rowdies,
this lock can't stop them.

1687
01:49:00,358 --> 01:49:02,430
No sir...
- Do what l say.

1688
01:49:02,629 --> 01:49:03,938
Take your hand from your cheek.

1689
01:49:10,628 --> 01:49:20,183


1690
01:54:14,261 --> 01:54:19,460
You're my sweet heart...

1691
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:42,004
You're my destiny, O damsel

1692
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:54,744
You're my naughty boy...

1693
01:49:54,938 --> 01:49:57,326
You're my life...

1694
01:49:57,561 --> 01:50:02,775
You're my sweet memory...
You're my lifeline...

1695
01:50:02,968 --> 01:50:07,823
You're my everything...

1696
01:50:09,462 --> 01:50:10,771
First love...

1697
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:13,266
lt's address...

1698
01:50:14,677 --> 01:50:15,855
Lot of guts...

1699
01:50:17,236 --> 01:50:18,545
Help me, O God!

1700
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:41,381


1701
01:55:45,819 --> 01:55:46,979
You're my school of love...

1702
01:51:01,003 --> 01:51:02,050
You're my temple...

1703
01:51:02,251 --> 01:51:03,843
You're my lap...

1704
01:51:04,043 --> 01:51:07,108
You're my left & right...

1705
01:51:07,753 --> 01:51:08,549
You're direction...

1706
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:09,825
You're my lucky charm...

1707
01:51:10,025 --> 01:51:11,617
You're my 7 notes...

1708
01:51:11,817 --> 01:51:15,078
You're my youthful torture...

1709
01:51:15,271 --> 01:51:16,864
You're my thrill...

1710
01:51:17,863 --> 01:51:19,586
lt's you for kisses...

1711
01:51:20,582 --> 01:51:22,786
You're my near and far...

1712
01:51:22,982 --> 01:51:25,665
You're happiness and burden...

1713
01:51:26,022 --> 01:51:30,461
You're the meaning of my life...

1714
01:51:48,001 --> 01:51:57,557


1715
01:57:09,736 --> 01:57:10,760
You're my tresses...

1716
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:22,255
You're my warmth...

1717
01:52:22,456 --> 01:52:24,114
You're my home...

1718
01:52:24,313 --> 01:52:27,214
You're my mischief...

1719
01:52:27,832 --> 01:52:28,846
You're my treasure...

1720
01:52:29,047 --> 01:52:30,062
You're my road to success...

1721
01:52:30,263 --> 01:52:31,888
You're the right match to me...

1722
01:52:32,087 --> 01:52:35,152
You're my real aim....

1723
01:52:35,382 --> 01:52:37,073
You're the knife...

1724
01:52:37,941 --> 01:52:39,796
You're my basket of flowers...

1725
01:52:40,725 --> 01:52:42,928
My heart chants your name...

1726
01:52:43,124 --> 01:52:45,905
You're the machine of pleasures...

1727
01:52:46,099 --> 01:52:50,768
You're my blissful evening...

1728
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:35,784
Did you get them?
- No.

1729
01:53:35,976 --> 01:53:37,405
Then?
- l struggled hard to get them.

1730
01:53:37,608 --> 01:53:39,015
Where are they?
- Over there.

1731
01:53:41,703 --> 01:53:42,434
Who are they?

1732
01:53:42,631 --> 01:53:43,612
People from whom l borrowed money.

1733
01:53:43,942 --> 01:53:45,251
Attitude before getting your
people will not be the same

1734
01:53:45,447 --> 01:53:46,210
after you get them.

1735
01:53:46,406 --> 01:53:47,900
So, before l hand them over to you,

1736
01:53:48,102 --> 01:53:49,476
you must clear all my debts.

1737
01:53:50,021 --> 01:53:51,581
What bloody condition?
- Cool.

1738
01:53:51,972 --> 01:53:52,954
How much?

1739
01:53:54,437 --> 01:53:56,411
How did they give you so much money?

1740
01:53:56,612 --> 01:53:58,041
They didn't give. l took it from them.

1741
01:53:58,243 --> 01:53:59,453
Now, they will take if you give them.

1742
01:53:59,651 --> 01:54:01,538
Give them their money.

1743
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:02,591
David needs Rs.1 lakh.

1744
01:54:02,786 --> 01:54:04,062
Who is he?
- Myself.

1745
01:54:04,322 --> 01:54:05,216
Why Rs.1 lakh for you?

1746
01:54:05,409 --> 01:54:06,587
You will go away once you get them.

1747
01:54:06,785 --> 01:54:08,159
You will not give money after that.

1748
01:54:09,633 --> 01:54:10,135
l will give you.
Show us where they are.

1749
01:54:10,337 --> 01:54:11,319
l will point it out.

1750
01:54:15,552 --> 01:54:17,886
You're the God of these people.

1751
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:18,973
You've lot of money now.

1752
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:20,890
Give me some money...

1753
01:54:21,086 --> 01:54:22,548
l don't trust people who
praise in good times

1754
01:54:22,750 --> 01:54:24,888
and curse in bad times.

1755
01:54:26,269 --> 01:54:28,178
l don't need you.

1756
01:54:28,381 --> 01:54:30,071
When my pocket is full of money,
it gives me courage,

1757
01:54:30,268 --> 01:54:31,512
and bottle of liquor.

1758
01:54:31,708 --> 01:54:33,268
l don't need you guys.
- Please don't say that.

1759
01:54:33,468 --> 01:54:34,580
To hell with you both.

1760
01:54:34,779 --> 01:54:36,023
Show me where they are.

1761
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:42,359
Take them with you fast.
l'm getting late for the cock fight.

1762
01:54:43,545 --> 01:54:45,519
Umbrella please.
- This is too much.

1763
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:46,648
You're inside the house.

1764
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,018
But l want to be under the umbrella.

1765
01:54:49,944 --> 01:54:50,773
My boss wants you.

1766
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,982
What's the problem?

1767
01:54:52,183 --> 01:54:54,190
Are they waiting for my orders?
Let's go.

1768
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:55,606
What's it, sir?

1769
01:54:57,974 --> 01:54:58,803
Mint money as much as you can.

1770
01:54:58,998 --> 01:54:59,827
l will come back after marriage.

1771
01:55:00,021 --> 01:55:01,265
Then we can share it.

1772
01:55:01,813 --> 01:55:04,147
Where did you send them?
- l don't know sir.

1773
01:55:04,341 --> 01:55:05,072
when is the marriage?

1774
01:55:05,397 --> 01:55:07,469
On 5th in Durga Temple.

1775
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:09,610
He might have escaped in Vijayawada train.

1776
01:55:09,811 --> 01:55:11,567
You said you don't know anything
but giving all the details.

1777
01:55:11,763 --> 01:55:13,454
Stop talking logic.

1778
01:55:13,779 --> 01:55:15,720
Take my sincere advice.

1779
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:18,794
lf he can cheat me,
you guys are nothing to him.

1780
01:55:18,994 --> 01:55:20,237
Stop looking for him.

1781
01:55:20,433 --> 01:55:23,596
lt's a waste providing food
to your henchmen.

1782
01:55:23,793 --> 01:55:25,516
And finally, you loose valuable time.

1783
01:55:25,775 --> 01:55:28,458
Stop advising upset people.
They might bury you.

1784
01:55:28,783 --> 01:55:32,361
Don't give them any ideas.
He is fuming.

1785
01:55:35,533 --> 01:55:38,697
This world might not know
about my death.

1786
01:55:39,277 --> 01:55:41,251
Somebody please save me.

1787
01:55:45,291 --> 01:55:47,625
Hope it doesn't see me.

1788
01:55:57,321 --> 01:56:00,222
l don't know where you're
a male or a female.

1789
01:56:00,425 --> 01:56:04,318
l can't even greet you properly.
l can't even run.

1790
01:56:04,519 --> 01:56:07,006
Go & enjoy with anyone you like.

1791
01:56:07,271 --> 01:56:10,270
Are you playing games
with the snakes?

1792
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:13,917
Understand my problem.
And divert the snake.

1793
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:17,025
You said that if you have money,

1794
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:20,220
you will get courage & liquor.

1795
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:23,681
Stop reminding me about the
things l said. Save my life.

1796
01:56:24,451 --> 01:56:27,003
Snakes can be charmed with songs.
Sing any song.

1797
01:56:27,202 --> 01:56:28,412
Here l come.

1798
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:30,236
The bush is on the fire...

1799
01:56:31,842 --> 01:56:33,402
The virgin's heart is seeking desires...

1800
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:37,045
Stop singing. Pull me out.
- Okay.

1801
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,320
lf you give me 500/0 of the
money you got,

1802
01:56:39,423 --> 01:56:40,830
l will save you from head to waist.

1803
01:56:41,023 --> 01:56:42,201
lf you give me everything,
l will pull you out fully.

1804
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:43,992
l will give you everything.
Send it away.

1805
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:46,459
Please save me.
- Thank you Mr. Snake.

1806
01:57:05,401 --> 01:57:14,957


1807
02:02:41,234 --> 02:02:44,692
Take her to our R&B guest house.

1808
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:43,656
Come.

1809
01:57:48,528 --> 01:57:52,618
Vijayawada
15 kms away from Autonagar

1810
01:59:12,861 --> 01:59:14,006
How did you ridicule me?

1811
01:59:14,205 --> 01:59:15,513
Show me once.

1812
01:59:37,176 --> 01:59:37,907
Like this.

1813
01:59:38,455 --> 01:59:39,502
l like you.

1814
01:59:40,311 --> 01:59:42,133
But l don't like you falling
in love with her.

1815
01:59:43,062 --> 01:59:44,109
A piece of information for you.

1816
01:59:45,046 --> 01:59:50,708
l will be marrying Sandhya on the same day,
same temple & the same time.

1817
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:54,892
You die happily.
- To hell with you.

1818
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:44,327
Leave my sister!

1819
02:00:44,521 --> 02:00:47,335
Poor man! Look at your brother.
How he's shouting!

1820
02:00:47,624 --> 02:00:49,631
Why are you stubborn?
Agree to marry me.

1821
02:00:49,895 --> 02:00:52,895
What's your problem?
Why are you insisting on marrying me?

1822
02:00:53,095 --> 02:00:55,964
You want to marry me?
Come on marry me.

1823
02:00:56,391 --> 02:00:58,245
Why are you making
a hue and cry for it?

1824
02:00:59,462 --> 02:01:01,949
Stop discussion and marry me,

1825
02:01:02,564 --> 02:01:06,906
l'll consider Krishna has married me
even if you marry me,

1826
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,725
l'm with Krishna though it's you,

1827
02:01:09,923 --> 02:01:15,040
even after having two kids with you,
if l meet Krishna, l'll elope with him.

1828
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:18,168
l can't hear this nonsense!
Stop it l say!

1829
02:01:18,369 --> 02:01:21,238
He must be alive to elope with him.
Jakka has killed him.

1830
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:22,684
Who? He?

1831
02:01:23,328 --> 02:01:29,972
l can't believe a eunuch like him
killed my Krishna.

1832
02:01:30,175 --> 02:01:31,036
You must believe it.

1833
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:33,783
l killed him with my own hands.
- Big boast!

1834
02:01:34,014 --> 02:01:39,381
Okay, l'll believe if you
show me his body.

1835
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:42,707
l'll happily agree to marry you.

1836
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:07,211
His body is missing, boss.

1837
02:02:13,301 --> 02:02:14,249
Dig further.

1838
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:17,932
They are digging like
ONGC digs for petrol,

1839
02:02:18,132 --> 02:02:19,244
just mud only,
no trace of body.

1840
02:02:19,443 --> 02:02:22,639
Don't get tensed, he'll come
at the time of marriage.

1841
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:26,150
l can't take it any more,
no marriage, rape her.

1842
02:02:26,354 --> 02:02:27,118
That'll be over.

1843
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:29,415
What else can you people do.

1844
02:02:31,217 --> 02:02:34,031
l need just minutes to rape you,

1845
02:02:34,448 --> 02:02:36,106
you said l'm a man only on killing him,

1846
02:02:36,432 --> 02:02:38,122
l'll have you only after killing him.

1847
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:42,596
You keep postponing things like
projects and they will vanish.

1848
02:02:42,798 --> 02:02:44,205
We are not able to chase them.

1849
02:02:45,934 --> 02:02:49,129
Find Krishna's brother,
sister-in-law, his friends,

1850
02:02:49,741 --> 02:02:53,537
l need all them in my guest
house in an hour.

1851
02:02:54,251 --> 02:02:56,226
He'll come for them. Go!

1852
02:02:56,427 --> 02:02:57,888
Don't entrust this trouble again to us,

1853
02:02:58,091 --> 02:02:59,039
we can never find them.

1854
02:02:59,498 --> 04:05:58,598
Find them!

1855
02:03:00,203 --> 02:03:02,374
Find them, can't you hear?
Let's go.

1856
02:03:04,426 --> 02:03:05,440
Greetings boss, tell me.

1857
02:03:05,641 --> 02:03:08,805
All our men must reach
Vijayawada by morning,

1858
02:03:09,064 --> 02:03:10,471
my nephew is marrying here,

1859
02:03:10,728 --> 02:03:12,964
our prestige is at stake.
- Okay boss.

1860
02:03:14,503 --> 02:03:16,258
l've arranged everything,

1861
02:03:16,455 --> 02:03:19,073
our men will hack any
number of people.

1862
02:03:19,622 --> 02:03:22,655
Call our men, find if they got
any of his family members.

1863
02:03:22,853 --> 02:03:25,154
Hello boss.
- Got anyone?

1864
02:03:26,053 --> 02:03:28,441
Where else can we search sir?
Couldn't find anyone?

1865
02:03:28,645 --> 02:03:31,230
Do something but come with
his family or else get lost.

1866
02:03:31,491 --> 02:03:32,222
Didn't get anyone?

1867
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,361
No way, they are super cheats,

1868
02:03:34,563 --> 02:03:35,806
they would've vanished into thin air.

1869
02:03:36,003 --> 02:03:38,141
Boss, 3 people are here to meet you.

1870
02:03:38,338 --> 02:03:40,923
Who will come to meet us here?
Let them in.

1871
02:03:44,576 --> 02:03:45,918
Where is MRO Chandrasekhar's house?

1872
02:03:46,113 --> 02:03:49,690
Go straight, turn left and first house
on the right is his house.

1873
02:03:49,887 --> 02:03:50,748
Upstairs!

1874
02:03:52,447 --> 02:03:53,275
Greetings sir.

1875
02:03:53,471 --> 02:03:54,964
My name is...
- No need to tell.

1876
02:03:55,166 --> 02:03:57,140
Jakka, he's Krishna's elder brother,

1877
02:03:57,341 --> 02:03:59,675
our men are looking for you,

1878
02:03:59,869 --> 02:04:01,624
but you've come to us on your own.

1879
02:04:01,821 --> 02:04:03,315
What's your plan this time?

1880
02:04:03,516 --> 02:04:07,410
No plans sir, we fear your men
may kill us on sight.

1881
02:04:07,611 --> 02:04:09,815
So we have come to Jakka sir directly.

1882
02:04:10,011 --> 02:04:10,993
Don't trust him,

1883
02:04:11,194 --> 02:04:14,325
l didn't tell you in fear how he
had cheated me earlier.

1884
02:04:14,522 --> 02:04:17,969
Why do you always go with
suitcases in hand?

1885
02:04:18,169 --> 02:04:19,183
Have you taken monthly pass?

1886
02:04:19,385 --> 02:04:23,956
Krishna brings home a problem everyday
and leaving home has become habit.

1887
02:04:24,152 --> 02:04:26,453
We can't pack immediately,
so we keep things readily packed.

1888
02:04:26,647 --> 02:04:27,345
Where is your brother?

1889
02:04:27,543 --> 02:04:29,430
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

1890
02:04:29,622 --> 02:04:31,793
lf he's alive, he'll definitely come
to the marriage, kill him.

1891
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:35,437
We'll stay with you till you marry
and leave this place, trust us sir.

1892
02:04:35,637 --> 02:04:39,597
Your brother too said the same
and gave us a shock treatment.

1893
02:04:40,084 --> 02:04:41,229
They will stay here,
show them a room.

1894
02:04:41,428 --> 02:04:44,111
You trusted Krishna because
he abused Shinde,

1895
02:04:44,308 --> 02:04:46,096
you're trusting them because
they are abusing Krishna,

1896
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:47,981
they are up to something.

1897
02:04:48,178 --> 02:04:50,763
Let they have any plan,
l've my own plans for them.

1898
02:04:50,962 --> 02:04:53,001
That's why we are still
at receiving end.

1899
02:04:53,393 --> 02:04:55,465
Go and stay in some room.

1900
02:04:55,665 --> 02:04:59,242
My men are on streets for you,
l'll recall them.

1901
02:05:07,278 --> 02:05:09,667
lt's Bobby! l thought some butler.

1902
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:10,797
Did you think like that?

1903
02:05:10,989 --> 02:05:12,549
Why are you in this condition?

1904
02:05:12,749 --> 02:05:16,610
My life turned worse for your
elder son's deeds.

1905
02:05:17,228 --> 02:05:18,537
What brings you all here?

1906
02:05:18,731 --> 02:05:19,876
Who is your next victim?

1907
02:05:20,076 --> 02:05:22,825
Tomorrow is the marriage,
we came to make Sandhya a bride.

1908
02:05:23,018 --> 02:05:28,734
There will only one cheat in a family,
but your entire family is.

1909
02:05:28,937 --> 02:05:30,344
l think you're frustrated.

1910
02:05:30,537 --> 02:05:32,839
Who? Me? Frustrated?

1911
02:05:33,992 --> 02:05:35,814
Tell me where is Sandhya
without biting teeth?

1912
02:05:36,008 --> 02:05:40,000
l'll tell you, just a whistle brought
me to this condition,

1913
02:05:40,455 --> 02:05:42,396
l can't imagine what would l be
l tell about Sandhya?

1914
02:05:42,599 --> 02:05:44,289
We'll not tell anyone that you told us.

1915
02:05:45,349 --> 02:05:46,756
No.
- Really.

1916
02:05:47,013 --> 02:05:48,507
Swear?
- Swear on you.

1917
02:05:49,317 --> 02:05:50,331
Swear on me?

1918
02:05:51,172 --> 02:05:52,187
Your family trait.

1919
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:55,009
Next gen too is on the block.

1920
02:05:55,363 --> 02:05:56,825
Where is Sandhya?

1921
02:05:57,699 --> 02:06:00,317
lt's room number 5, l don't know.
- 5!

1922
02:06:02,626 --> 02:06:03,673
What's this dear?

1923
02:06:04,418 --> 02:06:06,490
Why are you dull? Tomorrow morning
you're getting married.

1924
02:06:06,721 --> 02:06:08,859
Bride must be happy and bright.

1925
02:06:09,792 --> 02:06:11,864
Bridal sari from us.

1926
02:06:12,223 --> 02:06:14,132
Krishna...?
- He'll be here by morning.

1927
02:06:14,335 --> 02:06:16,701
He'll shake you up!

1928
02:06:23,805 --> 02:06:33,361


1929
02:12:06,999 --> 02:12:12,494
Shake it up...
drive away my timidity...

1930
02:06:45,849 --> 02:06:50,866
Chase out...the sadness...

1931
02:06:51,063 --> 02:06:53,680
May l tie the knot with you...

1932
02:06:53,879 --> 02:06:56,366
May l become your man
and share joy with you...

1933
02:06:56,565 --> 02:07:02,031
ls it enough?
You wanna more...

1934
02:07:51,466 --> 02:07:54,051
Caress my cheeks...

1935
02:07:54,249 --> 02:07:56,737
Caress my heart...

1936
02:07:56,936 --> 02:08:01,572
Be mine always...
Enchant me...

1937
02:08:02,439 --> 02:08:04,860
May l chase out the darkness
in you like a candle...

1938
02:08:05,063 --> 02:08:07,648
May l drive out fear in you...

1939
02:08:07,845 --> 02:08:09,667
May l spread all over you...

1940
02:08:09,862 --> 02:08:12,611
Like the incense stick...

1941
02:08:13,604 --> 02:08:18,840
Be with me always like
the ring on my finger...

1942
02:08:19,044 --> 02:08:21,465
Carry me like a palaquin...

1943
02:08:21,667 --> 02:08:24,285
Hide me in your heart...

1944
02:08:24,482 --> 02:08:30,177
May l be yours and take you
to the world of bliss...

1945
02:08:48,989 --> 02:08:58,544


1946
02:15:01,473 --> 02:15:03,964
Come to me like a golden girl...

1947
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:32,910
Quench my thirst like rain...

1948
02:09:33,107 --> 02:09:38,092
Allow me to taste your love...

1949
02:09:38,610 --> 02:09:43,791
May l pour on you like rain...
May l become yours tonight...

1950
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:48,555
May l fulfill all your desires...

1951
02:09:49,487 --> 02:09:54,788
You're my joy and love fun...

1952
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:57,444
You're the music of my life...

1953
02:09:57,646 --> 02:10:00,231
Come into my life
as my better half...

1954
02:10:00,429 --> 02:10:03,047
May l excite you and share joy...

1955
02:10:03,244 --> 02:10:06,026
May l give myself to you...

1956
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:29,916


1957
02:16:37,069 --> 02:16:41,529
Jakka's men are combing
entire place for us.

1958
02:11:03,807 --> 02:11:05,748
Honeymoon trip is Rs.15000.
- Book it.

1959
02:11:05,950 --> 02:11:06,965
Okay.
- Honeymoon?

1960
02:11:07,166 --> 02:11:10,427
Krishna is marrying Sandhya tomorrow,
planning to send them on honeymoon.

1961
02:11:10,525 --> 02:11:12,826
l'm tensed and you're talking
about honeymoon,

1962
02:11:13,021 --> 02:11:15,442
Jakka's men are out there like
mad dogs to kill us.

1963
02:11:15,644 --> 02:11:17,466
ls it Google network to
find us easily?

1964
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:18,772
What's it buddies?

1965
02:11:19,099 --> 02:11:21,400
You don't get tensed up,
Krishna has a foolproof plan,

1966
02:11:21,595 --> 02:11:22,161
he'll come at the right time.

1967
02:11:22,363 --> 02:11:25,232
Where is Krishna?
How can he plan without seen?

1968
02:11:25,434 --> 02:11:27,321
Was Bin Laden seen when
he struck Pentagon?

1969
02:11:27,930 --> 02:11:31,922
Jakka will get the shock
of his life from Krishna.

1970
02:11:46,325 --> 02:11:49,259
You said he'll be on time,
where is he?

1971
02:11:50,101 --> 02:11:51,955
He'll come, wait!

1972
02:11:55,475 --> 02:12:05,031


1973
02:17:50,409 --> 02:17:51,000
Here he comes!

1974
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:31,466
How dare to come alone!

1975
02:12:31,659 --> 02:12:34,441
You must dare to come to my place,
why should l?

1976
02:12:34,634 --> 02:12:36,674
l'm a local!

1977
02:12:38,057 --> 02:12:38,985
Local?

1978
02:12:39,337 --> 02:12:40,679
Even if the entire city comes,
you can't do anything.

1979
02:12:40,873 --> 02:12:42,760
Jakka, you're crossing limits,

1980
02:12:42,952 --> 02:12:46,181
don't get carried away by your men,
l've a foolproof plan for you.

1981
02:12:47,528 --> 02:12:48,575
What is your plan?

1982
02:12:48,775 --> 02:12:50,204
Your brother and sister-in-law
are with me,

1983
02:12:50,407 --> 02:12:51,683
l can kill them at anytime.

1984
02:12:51,879 --> 02:12:55,140
Can you? l sent them to you,

1985
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:58,622
if you dare touch them,
not a man from here will go alive.

1986
02:12:59,493 --> 02:13:02,591
lf l touch...?
- Don't provoke me!

1987
02:13:02,788 --> 02:13:03,868
lt'll be disastrous!

1988
02:13:04,067 --> 02:13:05,790
Disaster? Come on do it.

1989
02:13:05,987 --> 02:13:06,750
Like to see?

1990
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:08,157
See!

1991
02:13:39,292 --> 02:13:42,073
Where are you running away, Jakka?

1992
02:14:03,382 --> 02:14:05,422
What? What man?

1993
02:14:57,003 --> 02:14:59,686
l think he has aroused local feelings,

1994
02:14:59,882 --> 02:15:03,362
we can face cyclones
but not sewage. Let's go.

1995
02:15:04,169 --> 02:15:10,278
Mafia was born in this place,
trying to teach us hooliganism.

1996
02:15:10,919 --> 02:15:14,334
Bloody idiot!
Do you know about Vijayawada?

1997
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:17,185
This is Goddess Durga's place,
leave Sandhya and be safe.

1998
02:15:17,382 --> 02:15:18,461
Else you'll die!

1999
02:15:20,038 --> 02:15:22,110
The problem is between us,

2000
02:15:22,437 --> 02:15:26,364
let's settle it between us, okay?

2001
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:30,943
l beat to almost death,
you're on the verge of death,

2002
02:15:31,139 --> 02:15:32,121
but still acting brave.

2003
02:15:33,059 --> 02:15:35,775
Okay, l'll accept your challenge.

2004
02:15:52,734 --> 02:15:53,181
Come!

2005
02:16:43,763 --> 02:16:45,137
At last l got the whistle!

2006
02:16:45,394 --> 02:16:47,598
Don't stare at me, change it.

2007
02:16:48,561 --> 02:16:49,489
You knock-him out!

2008
02:17:27,177 --> 02:17:29,697
Get up...get up!

2009
02:17:38,791 --> 02:17:40,929
l'm escaping...manage carefully,

2010
02:17:41,126 --> 02:17:42,336
if Jakka is alive, bring him,

2011
02:17:42,534 --> 02:17:43,810
if he dies, bring his body.

2012
02:17:54,787 --> 02:17:57,306
Sandhya, let's marry.

2013
02:18:19,037 --> 02:18:19,768
You carry on!

2014
02:18:26,236 --> 02:18:35,792
