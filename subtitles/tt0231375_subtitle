00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,360

...as a lead character "Sundar" in the famous Kannada film "Samsara Nauke" directed by Late H. L. N. Simha.

Sita

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
Sita

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,480
Oh! what's all this honour for?

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,640
Did High School opening ceremony happen with all the pomp and glory? -Yes

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Lots of people were present right? -Yes

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,480
You were made the High School Headmaster, right?

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Why do you laugh?

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,520
Nothing. From today, I no more have the job.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
You lost the job?

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,480
Yes

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,040
From tomorrow, taking a pension of 12 rupees, I'll stay happy at home.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
The film "School Master", winning a National award,

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,160
brought honour to the young Kannada film industry.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,480
In Tamilnadu, a freedom fighter who fought against the British...

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,760
Veerapandian Kattabomman, was made into a great film by him.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,720
The film stands as a depiction of Pantulu's patriotism.

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
After having watched the film,

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,800
owner of the famous Gemini Pictures, Late S.S. Vasan,

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,600
praised Pantulu's artistry and courage in making such a big film.

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Pantulu won an award in Afro-Asian film festival for the film, "Kattabomman".

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
Not just that.

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,160
The Kannada film,"Veerarani Kittur Chennamma" about the great freedom fighter from Kannada land...

40
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,040
is another evidence of his patriotism.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Greetings master.

42
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,200
Is your pact with the British done?

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
What pact? We just delivered your message to them.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Councilman, you know that the world do not close its eyes because the cat does while drinking milk.

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,400
Whoever is caught for treason,

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,800
I'll have them flayed alive. Be careful.

47
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,760
We haven't done anything of that sort.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,960
The sweat beads on your face say it all.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,760
You may hide from the sun but not from my eyes.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,360
Live like swans of purity, not like snakes. Go now.

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,480
The credit of making a film for the Kannadigas on the Great Shri Krishnadevaraya goes to...

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,560
none other than Pantulu, the Brahma of film making.

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,800
Your Majesty, I have only one thing to request from you.
- Please tell me, Appaji.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,560
Both my sons are dead.

55
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,400
My wife, who was an embodiment of motherhood, died of the shock.

56
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Your Majesty, there is no one left for me except you.

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Your Majesty...

58
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,640
if you can perform the last rites after my death in place of my son,

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll be ever grateful to you.

60
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,280
Like this,

61
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,760
all of Pantulu's films were...

62
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,760
made to create social awareness and evoke patriotic emotions in the society.

63
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
Shri Pantulu,

64
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,000
always engaged in the film making till his last breath,

65
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,480
was an ascetic in art.

66
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,040
These legs are not wandering without a cause.

67
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,480
They are walking towards the achievement of a great ambition.

68
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,760
To raise money for a big task of building an ideal college.

69
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,400
They're knocking on every door for that.

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
These feet did not collapse of exhaustion...

71
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,040
did not succumb to selfishness...

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,640
and did not stop until the task at hand was over.

73
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
The determination accomplished it.

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
College was established.

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
A man like that...

76
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,360
was not just a man.

77
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
He was a great force.

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
Though this great man is no more,

79
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,360
the college survived and thrived.

80
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,960
Now, the same college is running.

81
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,440
There are hundreds of students.

82
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
There are teachers.

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,240
There is a committee to administer it.

84
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
There is everything.

85
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
But. How are they?

86
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
That...

87
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
is the story.

88
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,480
Title: College Ranga

89
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
How a head is important for a body,

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
a Principal, is as important for a college.

91
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
But...

92
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,040
you know what is important for this Principal?

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,080
With all the power...

94
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,360
and all the things under his control,

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
to misuse them...

96
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,480
and see how it can benefit him personally.

97
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,080
There he comes, Principal Somaiah.

98
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Good Morning, Sir.

99
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
What is it?

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,200
Sir.

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
You may not like what I'm about to say.

102
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,160
But...

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,960
I have to say this.

104
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,840
Lecturer Shantappa of our department,

105
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,120
has been coming late for about two months now.

106
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
He hasn't taken first period at all.

107
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,520
When asked for an explanation,

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,000
he says he'll answer only if the Principal is asking and says who am I to question him.

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Is it so, Sheenappa?

110
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Such a delinquent must be dismissed from our college.

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
When asked why he was late,

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,320
he says he had work at Principal's home...
-Which Principal? Who is that?

113
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
You Sir. He says he had work at your home.

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,640
Ants boring a tree,

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,440
rust on iron...

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,240
and rats in a granary must not be allowed.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,920
Likewise...

118
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
there is a rat in this college too.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
His name, Rangaswamy.

120
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,920
College Clerk.

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,920
That's alright.

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,880
But did I ask you to come late to college everyday?

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,640
What's this Sir? You are washing your hands off like this.

124
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,640
When I'm trapped myself, you want me to drown with you?

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,760
Is what you're doing right?

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm not a fool to ponder over the right and wrong of things when in trouble.

127
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,080
I lifted you up when you were in troubles.

128
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
Ungrateful, ungrateful.

129
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,560
Sir, from tomorrow...

130
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,120
look for someone else for your house work.

131
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
Shantappa.

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,320
If you speak of this anywhere else...

133
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
you won't be in this college, be careful.

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Sir.

135
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,240
Sir, this college got its bad name, in your time,

136
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,760
its now gone.

137
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Should I look for some other teacher in place of Shantappa?

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
Let me think about it.

139
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,520
Rangaswamy.

140
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Send some 100 chairs and tables to my home tomorrow.
-What?

141
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,840
Are you starting a tutorial at home?
-No.

142
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,680
It's my son's birthday tomorrow. These are for the guests to sit.

143
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,840
And...

144
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Send from the Kannada class, they're all new.

145
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,360
Sir, but there are classes tomorrow.

146
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,400
I'll ask that Kannada old senile to cancel the classes tomorrow.

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
You just make arrangements for sending them.
- OK, Sir.

148
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,000
It's only Kannada class, right?

149
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Like rose between the thorns,

150
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,320
like sandalwood among forest trees,

151
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,760
is this professor, Devaiah.

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,240
Students have a great respect for this man.

153
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,080
People think that it's good fortune of this college that this professor works here.

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Good evening, Sir.

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
Oh, good evening.

156
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,280
What is it Ramu, Gauri?

157
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,960
Sir, the book you gave us,

158
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,680
has a lot of Latin and French words. We can't understand.

159
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Ramu.

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
If you want to master Botany,

161
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,520
then you must know a little bit of French, Latin and German.

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,160
Where will we go to learn those foreign languages?

163
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,640
Why do you have to go somewhere else? Come to my house at 9 PM.

164
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,040
I'll teach or my my wife will teach.

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,120
What's happier than to teach students who want to learn?

166
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
Rangaswamy.

167
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Send two reams of white paper from stores to my home.

168
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,160
No one should know.
-Don't I know that?

169
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,320
Sir, I too have children. And they too go to school.

170
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
One ream for me too?

171
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
You seek share in everything.

172
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,440
You taught me all this.

173
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,120
Don't go selling it outside like last time.

174
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Last time, you had asked me to sell and bring the money to you.

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Why bring that up now?
-Forgive me Sir.

176
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,760
You saw the rat.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
You know who's the mouse?

178
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
His name's Cheluvayya.

179
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,720
His words are sweet...

180
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,960
but heart is bitter.

181
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,960
He too is a clerk.

182
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
Sir.

183
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm poor too. My children are poor too.

184
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
I too have need for paper.

185
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,880
I too need one...
-Ream?

186
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Have you both come planned?

187
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,160
Am I not the one who maintains the accounts of stores?

188
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,200
Putting Principal's house in stores and stores in Principal's house...

189
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,160
Making Ka into Bo and Bo into Ka.
-What is it Bo Ka?

190
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
Bo Ka.

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,640
Meaning?

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Nothing bad in it.

193
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,880
Turning Kali(Goddess) into Boli(widow) and Boli into Kali.

194
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Sir.

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,760
I've protected the Principal many times with the accounts.

196
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I've stood as a right hand man.

197
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
You mustn't forget that.

198
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
That's alright.

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,880
Which account will you put this into?

200
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
Don't you understand?

201
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Bo Ka or Ka Bo.

202
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,360
Cheluvayya.

203
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
What's the time?

204
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,560
It's Seven.

205
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
Rangaswamy.
-There's still light ON in the lab.

206
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
For quite some days now.

207
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,360
What work does the Botany professor have in the lab after seven?

208
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Come let's see.

209
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Look. Our problems will be solved in a week.

210
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,000
Be it a week or two. Don't stress yourself.

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,280
No, no. Don't say like that. Look...

212
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,400
...if this problem is solved, then it'll be a big achievement in my career.

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,480
I'll be very happy.

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,800
Then we two can go some place and have a nice time.
- Yes, we shall go.

215
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,440
Lady, Sir. Lady.

216
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,880
Between twenty five to thirty Sir.

217
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,920
Devaiah said the problem will be solved in a week.
-She agreed.

218
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,600
But Devaiah is a married man.
-Sir.

219
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
We are telling you what we saw.

220
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,280
Devaiah is aged forty to forty five.

221
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Will he do something like this at this age?

222
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,960
Sir, how does age matter in things like these?

223
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Sir, my grandfather, in his sixties...

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,960
loved a sixteen year old girl. That's what my grandma used to say.

225
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,280
Sir, there is a similar case in our family too. But I'm too ashamed to tell that.

226
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,160
That case is none other than himself.

227
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
Sir.

228
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,640
You must investigate into this Devaiah's matter sir.

229
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
It's a matter of our college's prestige.

230
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,280
Sir, this college got its bad name, in your time,

231
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,920
its now gone.

232
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,080
Good morning, Sir.

233
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh, come , come.

234
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't get time to read newspaper at home.

235
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,960
Your peon, poor fellow. He too doesn't get time to sleep at home it seems.

236
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,080
Hey, Jawara.

237
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,160
Get up. Lazy fellow.

238
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Go tell Cheluvayya to bring those files.

239
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,680
What brings you here?

240
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Nothing.

241
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,400
This year, I want 2000 rupees to be sanctioned additionally for my department.

242
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,120
Why?

243
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,840
There's a new apparatus.

244
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,480
It's very much needed for research and teaching.

245
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,640
Namaskara Sir.

246
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,800
You sent for files?

247
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,440
The files that need your signature are on your table.

248
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
For one week now.

249
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,520
Week or month, how does it matter to you? Just tell me if they're here.

250
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,680
They're sir. They're on the table.

251
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
What's this? I've a complaint on you.

252
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,320
What is it sir?

253
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm asking you seriously.

254
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm told, in your laboratory...

255
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
at night time,

256
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,800
you romance with a woman.

257
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,840
What do you have to say about this?

258
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,640
You're talking beyond your limit.

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,880
What?

260
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm requesting you for a research assistant for 10 years now.

261
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,840
My request still remains a request.

262
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Sir, that's why a lady is assisting me in my work.

263
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,240
She's none other than my wife.

264
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,640
What? Is she your wife?

265
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,080
Should I prove that in court now?

266
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,720
Don't get angry. Somebody told me about this and that's why I enquired with you directly.

267
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
Sir.

268
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,320
To romance with her...

269
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,120
that too in our laboratory you say.

270
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,440
Are these the words that suit people like you?

271
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
If at all I have to do something like that,

272
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,480
I have a home and a bedroom too.

273
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,040
Come here.

274
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,760
Let that one go now.

275
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,200
You mean you have something else on me?

276
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Don't get angry.

277
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,760
See, you asked for 2000 rupees for a new apparatus right?

278
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,800
Give me a requisition, I'll sanction it.

279
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,520
Please take it.

280
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,160
What is this? You've written the resignation letter.

281
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Sir.

282
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I may be your subordinate.

283
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
But I have self respect too.

284
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,680
To preserve that, this is the only way.

285
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,920
This...

286
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
is the house of the president of the college administration committee.

287
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,120
She's the president's wife.

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
You know how these couple are?

289
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
Pose like good people,

290
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,600
but are cunning like a fox.

291
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,600
They're only concerned with filling their pockets.

292
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,600
Hear them talk now.

293
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,720
Look here. You must take your resignation back.

294
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,800
Forgive me sir.

295
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,920
I can't.

296
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,280
Look here, I'm not asking you to work at my home.

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,240
Look Devaiah, god has given us plenty.

298
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
We don't have to ask anyone for anything.

299
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,680
Even then I'm requesting you.

300
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
You know why?
-Think about it.

301
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,520
You believe everything you're told, truth or lies.
-No.

302
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,960
I believe only when I'm told the truth.

303
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
It's your grace that you believe only truth.

304
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,960
See, to my husband...

305
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
you're the favourite among the college staff.

306
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Yes, tell him that.
-Yes, I'll tell him.

307
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
The way you teach students,

308
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
your knowledge...

309
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,280
and your interest in work,

310
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,880
you know what my husband says having seen all this?

311
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,200
Prof. Devaiah is a magnetic person in the college.

312
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,600
I shouldn't tell you this in front of him.

313
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,720
Look...

314
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
after knowing that you're resigning from the job,

315
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,000
hundreds of students...

316
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,320
have given a memorandum asking not to let you go.

317
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Will you throw their love away and still resign from your job?

318
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,960
Alright sir.

319
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,160
I'll take my resignation back.

320
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Good.Good.

321
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
It's not for you...

322
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,920
but for the love these students have given me.

323
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
I'll take your leave now sir. Bye

324
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,760
Ramu, what are you planning to do after graduation?

325
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,760
Let me graduate first. I'll think of that later.

326
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,240
Our history professor, Adavaiah is said to be lobbying for the post of Principal.

327
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,680
Do you know Ramu?

328
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,160
Adavaiah? Then our college is gone for sure.

329
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,840
We were relieved that Somaiah was gone.

330
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,640
But Typhoid like Adavaiah is coming now.

331
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
Well, it's not very far from happening too because...

332
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,280
Adavaiah is said to be very close to the college president.

333
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,120
What will happen to our college if Adavaiah is made the Principal?

334
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,360
Good morning sir.
Good morning.

335
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,560
Sir.

336
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,680
-Sir.
-Aah?

337
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
-Sir.
-Tell me what is it now.

338
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,320
Sir, there's only one name doing rounds for the post of the principal.

339
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,720
-From students to professor, the opinion is unanimous.
-Then?

340
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,600
What do you think my age is? my service? senior most in both age and service.

341
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Who else has the eligibility to sit on that chair?

342
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,240
-It's not that, sir.
-Then what is it?

343
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,240
-It's not your name.
-Then?

344
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,040
-Devaiah.
-Prof.Devaiah.

345
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,280
Botany Prof.Devaiah.

346
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
What's this injustice?

347
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Leaving aside the fact that he has a doctorate...

348
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,280
what other qualification does he have?

349
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,880
-Yes, sir.
-He's junior to me.

350
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,080
On top of that, he's not even from my community.

351
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,640
Even then, they think he's suitable?

352
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you see now? What an injustice?

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,840
-Tell me now.
-Sir?

354
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,720
That Devaiah...

355
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,680
-is also ambitious to sit on that chair?
-We don't know that sir.

356
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Find that out first.

357
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,800
Look, go to that Devaiah and...

358
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,760
find out subtly what's on his mind.

359
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,040
What?

360
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,120
Sir?

361
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,760
May we disturb you for a while?

362
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,720
What is it?

363
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,320
Nothing. Ex-principal is gone now.

364
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,000
What shall we do about that?

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Principal's chair is empty.

366
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,160
A new principal is yet to be appointed.

367
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,520
-Why don't you sit on that chair?
-Is it possible?

368
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Sir.

369
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,760
-I'm not even eligible to be in this bottle sir.
-He's nothing sir.
-Put it back.

370
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,880
Put it back properly.

371
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,120
Sir, this is not a matter to be taken lightly.

372
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,320
You are the choice in everybody's opinion.

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,360
Who would want to be your principal?

374
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,360
-How can you say like that, sir? Who else is there in our college who can take this job up?
-Who else is there?

375
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,760
There is president and the management to decide on that.

376
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,040
They'll do their job. You do yours. Go now.

377
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,080
So, you're definitely not interested in the principal's job?

378
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
I said, get out.

379
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,160
-What? What happened?
-Sir.

380
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,880
We tried. But he is a slimy snake.

381
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
He didn't even let us talk.

382
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,600
He stopped us in the middle.

383
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,840
He said why do you want to meddle in big people's matters and asked us to leave.

384
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,760
That means?

385
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,520
You couldn't find out what's on his mind?

386
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,800
We got to know somehow.

387
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
What do you mean somehow?

388
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,400
He...

389
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,800
is not interested in the principal's job.

390
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,440
-Is it true?
-We swear on you sir.

391
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,640
What you say is all true.

392
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,760
But your hands are not clean.

393
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,400
These days, who has clean hands? What do you say madam?

394
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,120
But you don't have a good image in student's eyes.

395
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
What if I don't have image? I have courage.

396
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,920
Sir, I'm senior most in both age and knowledge.

397
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm senior to everyone in the service.

398
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
That's alright, Adavaiah.

399
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,040
You trust whatever I say, truth or lies.

400
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,080
Madam...

401
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,840
I don't know the difference between them.

402
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
I'll believe whatever you say.

403
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,120
See...

404
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,200
...in this matter of appointing Devaiah as principal,

405
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,680
-my husband is completely reluctant.
-You tell him that.

406
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,920
-He wants you to be there.
-Thank you, thank you.

407
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,040
But what to do?

408
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,280
Public doesn't have a good opinion about you.

409
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Madam... President...

410
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,600
I belong to your community, yours.

411
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
How can you abandon me like this?

412
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,040
You are from my community, that's true.

413
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,360
But, I'm the college president.

414
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,320
Shouldn't I worry a bit about my image too?

415
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,840
Look here.

416
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,280
For now, let Dr.Devaiah be the principal.

417
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,000
As soon as he makes even one mistake,

418
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,720
-We'll bring him down
-and put you up.

419
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,440
It's not possible. Not in this life.

420
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,320
He's not the kind to make errors.

421
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,680
No matter what job is given to him,

422
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,120
he does it sincerely and honestly.

423
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,760
You do something to keep him from doing that.

424
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,440
You're ours.

425
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,320
Should I teach you all this?

426
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,600
Sir, your encouragement is enough. Namaskara.

427
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm yours. Please remember that.

428
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,280
Madam.

429
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm yours. Please remember that.

430
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,720
What's this?

431
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
You're appointing the reluctant Devaiah as principal on one side...

432
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,200
...and letting Adavaiah go after him on the other.

433
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,560
That is diplomacy madam.

434
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,280
See...

435
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,280
Devaiah is qualified.

436
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,080
If he is not made the principal,

437
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,760
then the press and public will cry over this.

438
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,640
If I make Adavaiah as principal because he's ours,

439
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,960
then the public will howl that I favoured him.

440
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,960
That's why...

441
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,840
we'll make Devaiah the principal...

442
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,880
and let Adavaiah go after him.

443
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,640
How's it?

444
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,960
What a brain you have.

445
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,600
-You teach me some of that to me.
-Why?

446
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,480
I'll also become the president of our college for some years.

447
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,520
What? I don't need to go far in search of my enemies, huh?

448
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,760
You have an eye on my seat?

449
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,680
Look Parvati. From now on...

450
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,920
no matter who comes home to talk about college business,

451
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
you shan't sit with me.

452
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,000
Why? Why shouldn't I?

453
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,560
I'll be there. I'll learn all your business. I'll contest against you. If you can, save your job or leave it to me.

454
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,240
Namaskara, sir. He's inside.

455
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,080
Oh! Come Devaiah, come. Namaskara.

456
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,400
Sit down.

457
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,200
-Is president home?
-Yes.

458
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Rama, come here.

459
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,560
Go tell sir that botany professor has come.

460
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,920
Devaiah, do you now understand my husband's heart?

461
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,040
He got your resignation cancelled.

462
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,280
-Made you principal from professor.
-Madam.

463
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,440
-Will president be late?
-He'll come.

464
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,360
How can the people talk so bad of him?

465
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,480
They say we built this house with college money.

466
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,920
-They say my jewellery is all bought with college money.
-Madam, I'm getting late.

467
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,720
Devaiah, you believe whatever I say, truth or lies. Truly, I brought these jewellery from my mother's home.

468
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,800
Even this sofa set was gifted by my brother.

469
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,200
-I was just explaining to him. He's the only one who understands us very well.
-Namaskara sir.

470
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,720
-What is it?
-Sir.

471
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,880
I beg you. Please don't make me the principal.

472
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,240
-I have no confidence that I can handle that job.
-You're crazy.

473
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,440
You're mad. Why don't you have confidence when we're all behind you?

474
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,720
It's not like that. It's a very responsible position.

475
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm worried that I might not get enough time for my research.

476
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,040
And moreover, this job doesn't suit my temperament.

477
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,320
See, I'm not the only one who has selected you for this job.

478
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,640
This is the decision of the entire committee.

479
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,520
If you refuse this job, you'll be showing disrespect to the whole committee.

480
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,920
And you'll have a black mark on your career. As inefficient.

481
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,440
-Are you inefficient?
-No, no. Devaiah is very efficient.

482
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,560
Alright, sir.

483
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,200
-I respect your words. So, I agree to work as principal for 6 months.
-Good.

484
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,680
-You can appoint someone else after that.
-First work for 6 months, then we'll see.

485
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,560
-What's all this?
-You're like god to us. this is our offering.

486
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Look. I'm not used to being garlanded in all my life.

487
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
So, no.

488
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,720
You mustn't say so, sir.

489
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,280
This is a symbol of our trust.

490
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,600
-Sir. We're your most obedient. You must accept our offerings.
-No. no.

491
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,530
Sir, if you don't accept this...

492
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,350
...you'll be refusing to accept our trust and obedience too.

493
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,460
How can I refuse?

494
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Your trust and obedience...

495
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,480
-...I always need them.
- We'll give them, sir.
- Good.

496
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,970
Now, with the same obedience...

497
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,370
...would you please bring all the files and registers related to stores?

498
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,020
What happened?

499
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,660
What happened?

500
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,880
Nothing sir.

501
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,930
This garland is very heavy.

502
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,440
-Looks like it pulled us to the side.
--Both of you?-

503
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,170
Looks like it.

504
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:04,310
-Sir, those files seem to have been closed.
-Seem to have disappeared for a month now.

505
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,080
If it has disappeared...

506
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,350
...then aren't you both responsible for that?

507
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,110
I don't know all that.

508
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,880
In ten minutes...

509
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
I want those files on my table.

510
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,170
Go.

511
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,620
It's our humble request to the principal to not to audit those files.

512
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,820
-Why?
-Because...

513
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:39,910
-...new principal should have new table, new file and everything new.
-Is it so?

514
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,150
Let me get those old files and then we'll think of doing something new.

515
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,040
Would you please come to the stores? Come.

516
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,280
Come I say.

517
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,820
Look here.

518
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,910
He went door to door...

519
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,910
...and collected funds.

520
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,330
Without caring for sleep or food and working day and night...

521
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,660
...he worked till his last breath.

522
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,460
Isn't this big institution a fruit of all his great efforts?

523
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,400
The garland you've brought...

524
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,330
...put it on this great man.

525
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,950
Your life would be worth something then.

526
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,310
Give it.

527
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,310
Our life is now meaningful sir.

528
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,130
We'll go to the office now.

529
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,310
Hey, come to stores.

530
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,240
What is this?

531
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,240
In stock register...

532
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,640
...you've written that there are 60 [electric]bulbs, right?

533
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,460
Where are the bulbs?

534
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,460
You mean bulb. Where would they go?

535
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,130
Rangaswamy, show him the bulbs.

536
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,370
Here they are sir.

537
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,440
What is this?

538
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,370
I ask you to show me the bulbs...

539
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,950
...you're showing me glass pieces.

540
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,860
Cheluvayya, what's this? Glasses have become like this?

541
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,660
Oh no. Rangaswamy.

542
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,930
How did they become like this?

543
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,260
Sir, bulbs have all broken up because of the heat.

544
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,710
Arrey, it has changed colour too.

545
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,310
Because of the heat...

546
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,620
...bulbs break up,

547
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,660
change colour and...

548
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,370
also change their shape from round to flat like this.

549
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,310
Is it so, sir?

550
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,080
Then...

551
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
these bulbs...

552
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,460
...must have 60 brass holders, right? where are they?

553
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,800
-Metals also melt in heat, wouldn't they, sir?
-You ignorant...

554
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,370
You're teaching science to our principal who's a science teacher himself?

555
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,040
On heating, even stones melt. Do you think he doesn't know that?

556
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,600
-Is it not, sir?
-Correct.

557
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,770
Then, you've recorded in the register that there are 60 bulbs in stock, right?

558
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,640
What would you do about it?

559
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,460
That's no big deal. I'll record it as "no stock because bulbs melted away".

560
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,910
Come here.

561
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,220
White paper, full scape, there should be 20 reams, where are they?

562
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
White paper?

563
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,400
Ah, got it. This is the white paper.

564
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,910
What's this? You're showing me brown paper instead of white paper.

565
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,060
It was white like his turban when it was bought.

566
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,950
-Now it seems to have gone brown because of heat you say?
-Yes, sir. Our stores is affected very much by heat.

567
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,200
OK. Where are the 10 reams of brown paper?

568
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,440
This is the brown paper.

569
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,220
What's this? You're showing me cardboard instead of brown paper.

570
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,950
Because it's old stock, they seem to have stuck together during the winter.

571
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,280
That's alright.

572
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,020
-I could've taken criminal action on both of you.
-Sir.

573
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Now.

574
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,750
Whatever explanation you've given to me orally,

575
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,060
give them to me in writing.

576
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,370
Until the enquiry is over,

577
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,480
you're both suspended.

578
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,220
Incompetents.

579
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,220
Aren't you ashamed?

580
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,220
You shouldn't steal.

581
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,530
Or at least shouldn't get caught.

582
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,880
If you are not even this smart,

583
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
then why should you get yourself into all this?

584
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,400
We couldn't know that he would be checking the stores and all old files.

585
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,480
-Had we got a clue, we would've corrected them.
-Yes, go suffer now.

586
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,640
-If you let us go like this, what would happen of us?
-What shall I do?

587
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,330
-What shall i do?
-What is it?

588
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,110
Madam.

589
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:46,040
Principal Devaiah has suspended us from work.

590
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,060
Sir, please do not let us sink.

591
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,800
We've had only what a fox would have after the lion has had its share.

592
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,640
-Do not punish those who've eaten only the peels of a fruit, sir.
-Why do you fall at my feet?

593
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,020
-Look here. Who suspended you?
-Principal Devaiah sir.

594
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,930
Go catch his feet.

595
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:12,080
Oh, should these hands that have touched your feet go and touch those feet?

596
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,620
-Hey, Rangaswamy. What's more important to you? Job or feet?
-Job sir.

597
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,680
Then go and fall at his feet.

598
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,080
Ask forgiveness.

599
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,930
It's not right for me to interfere in his duties.

600
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,310
Why isn't it?

601
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,080
Why don't you ask the principal yourself?

602
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
-Yes madam.
-Keep Quiet.

603
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,460
That Rama, Sita had only one Hanuman.

604
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,170
We've two Hanumans.

605
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,020
They've so much devotion and respect towards us.

606
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,950
-Please tell madam.
-You won't understand all this, keep quiet.

607
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,240
If I talk in favour of these two, Devaiah will be angry at me.

608
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,910
It would seem that even the president is among those who steal...

609
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,840
and because I'm supporting them I'll be doubted.

610
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,260
That's not diplomacy.

611
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,080
Hey Cheluvayya, Rangaswamy.

612
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,370
First go fall at his feet and save your jobs.

613
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,200
Don't tell anyone that I told you so.

614
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:44,620
One must drink water after one's had salt.

615
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:52,080
One must drink water after one's had salt.

616
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,600
After committing a mistake, O Shiva,

617
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,490
Yes...

618
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,290
After committing a mistake, one must face the punishment.

619
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:12,670


620
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:19,420
One must drink water after one's had salt.

621
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,400
One must never bite the hands that feed.

622
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,080
One must not pour oil on a boulder.

623
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,550
You know that and we too know that.

624
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,170
You know that and we too know that.

625
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,060
Yet we commit these mistakes.

626
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:09,100
One must drink water after one's had salt.

627
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,230
One must not keep a wolf to herd the sheep...

628
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,240
and not trust a cunning fox to keep a relationship.

629
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,840
-This, you know too.
-Yes, we know.

630
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:48,460
-This, you know too.
- Yes, we know.
-[Together] Yet we commit the same mistakes.

631
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:55,000
One must drink water after one's had salt.

632
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:20,040
One shouldn't make friendship with a tiger and let people know.

633
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,640
One shouldn't let a mouse into a granary.

634
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:37,680
-This, you know too.
- We know too.
-[Together] Yet we commit the same mistakes.

635
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,880
One must drink water after one's had salt.

636
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,230
-After committing a mistake, Rangaswamy.
-What?

637
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:54,040
After committing a mistake, one must face the punishment.

638
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,260
Take this.

639
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,920
Drink it.

640
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,820
We don't want this water, sir. Our thirst won't be quenched with this.

641
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,640
What? Even the sacred Kaveri water wouldn't be enough to satisfy your thirst?

642
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,060
Amma, Amma.

643
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,520
This is not a thirst that goes away with Kaveri water.

644
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,860
For this thirst,

645
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,210
we need the elixir of Principal's forgiveness.

646
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,970
Ah, how aptly put Rangaswamy.

647
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,160
Sir,

648
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,920
-My two families...
-Uh?

649
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,300
Our two families have to survive, sir.

650
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,190
What's all this with the costume?

651
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,110
We've come to seek forgiveness and offer our services to god.

652
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,200
To offer to god, you must go to a temple.

653
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,400
Why did you come to Devaiah's house?

654
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,490
How can it be? Devaiah's house is God's place for us.

655
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,520
Ayyo, Rangaswamy. How beautifully you said it.

656
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,320
Devaiah is our god.

657
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,260
Were you both toad eaters in your previous life or what?

658
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,990
We don't have any memory of that.

659
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,120
When you don't remember something from this life itself...

660
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,000
how can you remember from previous life?

661
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,830
Swallow into your stomach, sir... [ask forgiveness]

662
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,680
-Whom? You?
-No, our mistakes.

663
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,440
-You must save us.
-Leave my feet.

664
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,640
Leave my feet, stand up. Stand up.

665
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,000
Listen.

666
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,680
In our college stores,

667
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,880
approx. Rs.1500-1600 worth goods,

668
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,250
have been stolen by you.

669
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,250
That,

670
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,480
every month...

671
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,480
will be deducted...

672
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
from your salaries.

673
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,130
Do you agree to this?

674
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,260
Yes, we agree sir.

675
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,440
Sir.

676
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,680
But, let instalments...

677
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,850
-be a bit smaller, sir.
-Aha!

678
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,120
When you stole, you took it in bulk?

679
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,400
Confessing all the mistakes you've done till now...

680
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,010
...you must write an apology letter. Do you agree?

681
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,400
-OK sir.
-Alright.

682
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,580
Look here.

683
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,600
There is a lot of respect for this[saffron] cloth in our country.

684
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,320
People like you shouldn't be dishonouring it by wearing it.

685
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,600
Remove it. Remove it!

686
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,800
Come and see me in the college.

687
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,360
Hey!

688
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,120
Come here

689
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,940
What is it sir?

690
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,010
Glass.

691
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,220
-Forgot about it, sir.
-Old habits, sir.

692
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,350
-Sir, you sent for us?
-Yes.

693
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,930
-Ramappa.
-Sir?

694
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,690
I was thinking...

695
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,990
What is it, sir?

696
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,710
...that all our college students,

697
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,210
should wear uniform.

698
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,390
-Uniform, sir?
-Yes.

699
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,160
When they wear uniform,

700
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:50,800
among students,

701
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:59,360
there won't be discrimination based on wealth or caste or creed. All will feel equal.

702
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,360
How shall the uniform be, sir?

703
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,980
I'll let you know before this evening.

704
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,380
You two convince the students.

705
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,380
But don't force them.

706
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,850
Those who agree can wear it.

707
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,020
OK sir.

708
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,720
-Namaskara Doctor.
-Namaskara sir.

709
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,060
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

710
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,150
Give me the file.

711
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,070
Day after tomorrow, the commission will visit.

712
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,070
Have you made all the arrangements?

713
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,300
-Need I make any special arrangement for that?
-Then?

714
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,400
Sir, I have a small request.

715
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,750
What is it?

716
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:41,260
I'll have a big cloth banner put up in front of the college.

717
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,160
saying what?

718
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,840
-Welcome to the members of the education commission.
-Welcome to the college President.

719
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,680
President's name should be written in bigger font.

720
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,320
For the members who are coming tomorrow...

721
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,780
you must make arrangements for garlands, tea,coffee and food. OK?

722
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,130
That Principal and us will take care.

723
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,240
Look. This commission has asked all kinds of questions.

724
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,490
What do we do?

725
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:21,320
Let them ask sir. Our principal will throw answers at them like that.

726
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,880
-Sir.
-Uh?

727
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,360
When we're talking about these things...

728
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,360
do we need them here?

729
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,430
-What do you say?
-I say no need.

730
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,030
Get out.

731
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,740
They've asked, 'Does the college have enough space'?

732
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,740
What will you say?

733
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,740
I must say there isn't enough.

734
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,510
You will throw me into a well saying that.

735
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,220
What then, should I say sir?

736
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:03,420
Say that it's satisfactory but still need some more.

737
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,890
What if they don't believe us and ask where is the space?

738
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,940
Who knows if they will ask? Why do you bother?

739
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,920
OK sir.

740
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:21,500
They ask, 'Are there able lecturers to teach post graduate classes?'.

741
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,320
What do you say?

742
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,720
I'm thinking of saying that there aren't any.

743
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,560
Say like that.

744
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,720
College will have a good reputation.

745
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,960
Look, if you say like that...

746
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,180
wouldn't it make many lecturers in our college seem useless?

747
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:47,960
Yes sir.

748
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,510
Many will be seen as useless.

749
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,510
But not all.

750
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,840
Saying like that...

751
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
can you let your college reputation suffer?

752
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,360
Lecturers are appointed by...

753
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,600
management, right?

754
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,140
If management gets the bad name, doesn't the college get the bad name too?

755
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,530
Sir.

756
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,530
Please don't get angry.

757
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,960
Tell me what I should say to them, I'll say.

758
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:26,650
Instead of speaking smartly as the situation requires...

759
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,340
you're speaking as if you want to bring this college down.

760
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,190
They ask, 'How is the relationship between the Principal and the management?'

761
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,430
What will you say?

762
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,430
It's very good.

763
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,200
President always thinks of the college.

764
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,800
He's working all the time for that.

765
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,260
-I'll say he's a good man.
-Ah, very good.

766
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,480
Very good. You...

767
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,580
-speak with smartness sometimes.
-Thanks sir.

768
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,520
But some other times, you speak like a fool and put me in a fix.

769
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,630
Look.

770
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,520
-Just like now, speak with same smartness.
-OK sir.

771
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
-The commission is coming day after tomorrow, right?
-Yes sir.

772
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,360
Look. The whole college should be clean.

773
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,460
-Should be clean.
-I'll do it, sir.

774
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,840
-Did I ask you to do it?
-No sir.

775
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,840
-I said get it cleaned.
-OK sir.

776
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,960
Look, in front of them...

777
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,240
don't show your witty humour or sarcasm.

778
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,040
Act like a responsible principal.

779
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,060
OK sir.

780
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,390
Come here.

781
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,470
When they ask you something...

782
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,320
and you don't know the answer...

783
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,920
I'll be just next to you.

784
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,010
Look.

785
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,080
Just give a nudge like this.

786
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,040
-To them, sir?
-To me.
-OK sir.

787
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,260
They're all coming now.

788
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,370
Be serious and don't be afraid.

789
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,220
Hello, hello, welcome Dr.Rajaram.

790
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,930
How are you? How do you do?

791
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,720
Gangadhar Rao, it's been so many days since we last met.

792
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,940
How are you Devaiah?

793
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,990
This man didn't tell me that he knew these people.

794
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,330
See how ungrateful he is, sir.

795
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,040
Come on Dr.Rajaram.

796
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,760
Rajaram, meet our president.

797
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,760
How do you do sir?

798
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,520
He's the president.

799
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
How do you do?

800
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,040
Members of the education commission are welcome.

801
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,640
Thank you, thank you.

802
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,960
Look here Mr.President,

803
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,460
Dr.Devaiah is very close to us.

804
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,280
He worked with us.

805
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,280
Talented and honest.

806
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,910
Had we known that he was your college principal,

807
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,810
-we wouldn't have had to visit your college at all.
-Oh, come on.

808
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,730
It's an honour for this college that he is the Principal here.

809
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:58,970
Did you see, sir?

810
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,600
Did you see, sir?

811
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,780
You are this college president.

812
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,660
No, you are the president.

813
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,200
What are you saying, sir?

814
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,010
You put your hand out when he said, 'Meet the president'?

815
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,640
Oh, forgive me sir. Force of habit.

816
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,200
In that period,

817
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,200
the most prosperous kingdom was...

818
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,750
Vijayanagara.

819
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,750
Vijayanagara empire.

820
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,410
Who was ruling that?

821
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,810
Shri Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar.

822
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,160
Silence, silence.

823
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,980
Why? Why are you laughing?

824
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,980
Why are you laughing?

825
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,430
Sir?

826
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,280
Would you please come?

827
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,000
What is it, sir?

828
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,950
Come.

829
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,260
My dear students...

830
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,730
Who was ruling the Vijayanagara empire?

831
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,320
Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar.

832
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,750
What are you teaching?

833
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,090
Excuse me sir. This is Adavaiah's class.

834
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,560
He said he had some work and asked me to me manage this class.

835
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,780
Sir, history is not my subject.

836
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,530
OK.

837
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,080
History is not your subject.

838
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,740
But haven't you studied history in any class?

839
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,410
The one who ruled Mysore kingdom was...

840
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,410
Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar.

841
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,050
The one who ruled Vijayanagara empire was...

842
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,540
Krishnadevaraya.

843
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,540
Couldn't you know this small difference?

844
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,490
Mr. Gundappa.

845
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,360
A teacher's job is very sacred.

846
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,810
It has its own honour.

847
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,970
Please don't spoil it.

848
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,300
Mr. Adavaiah.

849
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,720
Oh, please come.

850
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,960
Had you sent for me, I would have come to your chamber.

851
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,670
That's alright.

852
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,400
Doesn't matter how many cigarettes I smoke...

853
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
...it doesn't give the pleasure like beedis, you see.

854
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,110
What's the matter, sir?

855
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,800
Something happened that made me sad.

856
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,410
I came to tell you that.

857
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,840
Why sir? What happened?

858
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,720
That lecturer who is hired on your recommendation....

859
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,400
Yes?

860
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,120
He was teaching wrong things to the students.

861
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,200
Oh, him?

862
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,920
Don't mind him. He's still a novice.

863
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,460
He doesn't have much experience.

864
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,670
Then you should've put him in junior class.

865
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,670
Why did you put him in senior class?

866
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,250
I was a bit late today.

867
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,780
Seems like he has taken the class on behalf of me.

868
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,780
Look Mr. Adavaiah.

869
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,070
We are teachers.

870
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,770
If we are not disciplined...

871
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,770
...how do you think the students would be?

872
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,200
How can we ask them to be disciplined then?

873
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,070
Adavaiah...

874
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,380
You're senior to me in age.

875
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,840
And in service too.

876
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,520
It's my request to not repeat this.

877
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,920
-Alright sir.
-That's alright.

878
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,720
-Sir.
-Yes?

879
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Have you read this book?

880
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,820
-Which one?
-It's called 'College Ranga'.

881
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,160
-It's quite interesting, sir.
-Yes, I've read it.

882
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,490
-They've written what goes on in our college, right?
-Yes, yes.

883
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,490
You're like this even after reading that?

884
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,770
There are no funds.

885
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,970
It will cost some 60-70 thousand rupees if done as per your plan.

886
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,140
Is it a joke?

887
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,210
How can you say that sir?

888
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,180
I can't watch the students suffer like that sir.

889
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,250
When I see the students having their lunch under baking sun, under trees and at every odd place...

890
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,510
...I feel sad sir.

891
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,490
We don't feed them.

892
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,810
At least to let them eat the food they bring from their homes...

893
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:55,000
...it is our duty to provide a proper place. Is it not, sir?

894
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,720
It's our duty, yes.

895
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,100
But we need money too, right?

896
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,440
Sir.

897
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,560
I know that it will happen if you are willing.

898
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,290
Would a building gets built just by will?

899
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,600
You tell me it's not possible.

900
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,100
My students and I'll go beg for charity and arrange a place.

901
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,110
I can't watch them suffer.

902
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,030
Will you at least give permission for that?

903
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,370
Thanks.

904
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,040
You're always like this, doctor.

905
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,710
Alright.

906
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,140
I'll call the committee meeting tomorrow and propose this to them.

907
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,040
Why do you bring the committee up and try to wriggle out of this?

908
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,800
You are the committee.

909
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,590
Show me one member who says no to you?

910
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,380
Keep this matter with you.

911
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,860
Don't go telling everybody.

912
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:53,330
I'll call contractor Lakkappa tomorrow and have a talk with him.

913
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:54,330
Thank you sir.

914
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,110
I'll leave.

915
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:56,720
Sit down.

916
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,000
Rama.

917
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,600
Bring a kolu(stick) for the principal.

918
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:01,860
Kolu(Stick)?

919
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,170
Why sir?

920
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,640
It's Coca Cola.

921
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,020
Everyone calls it Coke.

922
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,340
I always call it Kolu(stick). How's it?

923
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,850
Very good sir.

924
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,290
It has been decided that all the empty sites shall be seized by the Govt..

925
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,860
Rama! Turn the radio off!

926
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,950
What's this?

927
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,520
Namaskara to the president!

928
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,360
Oh, Lakkappa! Please come.

929
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,600
-Amma.
-Rama!

930
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,800
-Put a chair out for Mr.Lakkappa.
-It's alright.

931
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,000
Please sit down.

932
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,460
My third wife told me that you had called.

933
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,060
I came leaving everything at hand.

934
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,990
What's this? I haven't seen you for 6 months now.

935
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,310
I have no time.

936
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,680
I have to look after high school contract at Halebidu,

937
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,990
a hospital contract at Araga...

938
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,270
...and canal work at Kanaga.

939
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:02,730
And over this, two of my buses... you know what happened.

940
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,240
The police have seized two of my lorries.

941
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,600
And there are my family problems too.

942
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,780
I have to find a match for first wife's son...

943
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,040
and a match for second wife's daughter.

944
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,200
I'm saved by the fact that my third wife can't bear children.

945
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,870
Why did you get into so many troubles for yourself?

946
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,620
I didn't. They got me.

947
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:24,950
Lakkappa!

948
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,250
There's a building contract.

949
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,180
I await your orders.

950
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,530
For college students to have their lunch in the afternoon,

951
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,330
a simple mess hall.

952
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,310
80 feet length and 40 feet breadth.

953
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,020
How much do you think the estimate would be?

954
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,810
80 X40. It should be simple.

955
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,550
It may cost about 30-35 thousand.

956
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,120
You make that 50.

957
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,940
Send 10 here.

958
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,230
and the rest 5, you take it for yourself.

959
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,930
Ah! That's not right.

960
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:06,890
You see, let's not do this give and take business.

961
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,260
You see Lakkappa.

962
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,260
You just complete our Jayanagar house.

963
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,670
Amma?

964
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,870
To complete Jayanagar house...

965
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,800
I may have to put in some 10 thousand myself.

966
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,140
Is it so Lakkappa?

967
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,550
-Can't you give this contract to someone else?
-Amma, Amma!

968
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,640
I understood.

969
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:28,840
OK.

970
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,630
Your Jayanagar house must be completed before the mess hall is.

971
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,920
I got it. I got it.

972
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,010
I take your leave, President.

973
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,950
-Amma, Jayanagar!
-House
-Complete

974
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,410
You keep loitering all day. Can't you work fast?

975
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:51,690
Not a single feet of wall has been built since yesterday.

976
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,340
Keep working.

977
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,410
Oh! Namaskara to the Principal.

978
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,100
Namaskara to you too.

979
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,860
How's the work going on?

980
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,090
When will you finish the work?

981
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,950
You may consider the work done once I take it up.

982
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,610
Sir, I will incur loss in this contract.

983
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,440
-Is it?
-I will lose some 5-6 thousand.

984
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,860
It's a place where children come to eat. So, I thought I'll do it thinking it'll bring some good karma.

985
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,980
Good, good.

986
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,280
What are you looking at? Work fast.

987
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,720
Mr. Lakkappa!

988
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,510
In the quotation,

989
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,380
...you've mentioned that you'd use teak for all doors and windows.

990
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,200
I have used teak, haven't I?

991
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,450
-This is teak?
-Yes.

992
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,960
-It's grand teak of Musur.
-Teak?

993
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,370
You're using cheap timber and eating away all the money.

994
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,330
You're telling me about the trees? Is this teak?

995
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:47,440
What's this?

996
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,350
You're using mud for walls when you've mentioned in the quotation that you'd use mortar for walls.

997
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,480
Look Mr. Principal...

998
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,280
...why do you want to know all that?

999
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,530
It's between me and president.

1000
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,380
You go teach your students and...

1001
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,890
...see if other professors are doing their work.

1002
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,090
You go now.

1003
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,150
Mr. Lakkappa!

1004
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,380
I know how to teach the students and...

1005
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,080
...know how to find thieves like you.

1006
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,020
Stop all your work.

1007
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,880
I'll talk to the president.

1008
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,560
Hey! Stop all the work.

1009
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:25,610
OK, then.

1010
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,160
Let's think that I've cancelled the contract.

1011
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,210
How will we complete the building?

1012
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,720
-You leave that to me.
-You mean?

1013
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,990
You will take the contract?

1014
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,370
-There's no need for a contractor, sir.
-How's that possible?

1015
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,040
Funds can be released only if a certified contractor is appointed.

1016
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,910
It's impossible otherwise.

1017
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,360
Then I don't want your fund.

1018
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,430
Then? You will build it with magic?

1019
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,450
Why magic, sir?

1020
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,500
My students and I will go to each house...

1021
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,710
and collect donations.

1022
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:57,890
You'll ask for donations?

1023
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,700
[Sarcastically]You'll build it and your students will eat there.

1024
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,650
You just give me the permission.

1025
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,480
I'll build it and invite you for the inauguration.

1026
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,790
Sure, sure. I'll come.

1027
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,290
Till then I'll also have sent an application to god...

1028
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,870
...seeking an extension to my life by another 60-70 years.

1029
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:19,850
Because...

1030
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,500
I should be alive by the time you invite me, right?

1031
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,850
Please don't joke, sir.

1032
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,010
Who's joking now?

1033
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:26,970
You or me?

1034
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,550
He wants to build it with donations.

1035
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,520
Go ahead and build it.

1036
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:37,600
You want to dig a well with a needle?

1037
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,770
Go ahead and dig all you want.

1038
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,550
This mess hall was completed...

1039
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,530
because of students' charity,

1040
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,840
students' physical labour...

1041
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,860
and...

1042
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,460
with our principal's and teachers' confidence.

1043
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,180
And also because of our college president.

1044
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,450
Just because the construction is finished, it doesn't mean everything is complete.

1045
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:35,080
We still need furniture for students to sit and eat.

1046
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:38,970
We have not enough money left to buy all that.

1047
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,550
Our president's wife is very generous.

1048
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,690
If she opens her heart and...

1049
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,450
...donate all the jewellery she's wearing...

1050
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,900
this job will be complete.

1051
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,360
All the students...

1052
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,360
while having their lunch everyday...

1053
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,170
...will feel thankful to this great mother.

1054
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:07,520
That's why you people are called children[naive].

1055
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,960
You think all that is white as milk.

1056
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,950
Children, children!

1057
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,410
All the jewellery that madam is wearing are not gold.

1058
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,100
Not at all.

1059
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,750
-All of them are fake gold jewellery.
-Shut your mouth!

1060
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,460
Hey Cheluvayya.

1061
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,010
You're trying to disrespect me?

1062
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,640
You say that my wife's jewellery are not made of gold?

1063
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:33,440
You mean to say that I can't buy gold jewellery for my wife?

1064
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:38,030
If anyone can prove that these are not gold jewellery...

1065
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,420
I'll cut my hands off.

1066
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,590
Whom are we giving it to?

1067
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,520
To our children, is it not?

1068
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,560
Parvati!

1069
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,670
Oh god!

1070
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33,910
-What is it, madam?
-Are you god? Get lost!

1071
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,160
At what bad time did I get up this morning?

1072
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:48,110
Why did I have to wear all my jewellery today?

1073
01:08:48,512 --> 01:08:50,751
Oh calm down. Why do you cry?

1074
01:08:50,842 --> 01:08:54,123
Our prestige will increase with this charity.

1075
01:08:54,148 --> 01:08:55,843
Your prestige be damned!

1076
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:57,497
What are you saying?

1077
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,441
Look at the newspaper tomorrow.

1078
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:01,554
I'll become a pauper with your paper craze.

1079
01:09:01,963 --> 01:09:04,280
That Principal. He's Shishupala.

1080
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:08,472
Does he have to snatch my jewellery to make his name?

1081
01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:10,808
With the canteen building contract money,

1082
01:09:10,886 --> 01:09:11,655
even if not for the whole house...

1083
01:09:11,925 --> 01:09:13,909
I thought of getting AC for at least my bedroom.

1084
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:15,288
He spoiled that.

1085
01:09:15,478 --> 01:09:17,050
With money saved from cement and iron...

1086
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:19,185
I thought of completing Jayanagar house.

1087
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:20,678
He spoiled that too.

1088
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:23,223
There's only one thing left for him to do to us.

1089
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:24,317
What?

1090
01:09:24,524 --> 01:09:25,833
Ask me what is it?

1091
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:27,201
What is it?

1092
01:09:27,336 --> 01:09:29,170
Giving you a broom...

1093
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:33,091
and ask you, the president, to clean the premises of the college.

1094
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:36,425
And ask me to carry the garbage to the dump.

1095
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,914
Only this is left for him to say to us.

1096
01:09:40,788 --> 01:09:41,431
Bring him down.

1097
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,864
You bring Devaiah down from the principal post immediately.

1098
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:46,238
Otherwise...

1099
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:47,516
you're dirt...

1100
01:09:47,865 --> 01:09:49,143
he's the broom...

1101
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:50,667
and he'll sweep you out.
