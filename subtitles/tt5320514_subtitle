4
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,816
He "sketched" location, sir.

5
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,882
Make sure the location is correct. Shall I come now! 10 minutes!

6
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:34,970
Finish DRC

7
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,543
- Where are they?

8
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,584
There is a small jungle after this bridge.

9
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,786
They are there, sir.

10
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,753
- Good. Enters.

11
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,530
Stop here, sir.

12
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,961
It's on the left.

13
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,671
- Where to now?

14
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,599
This is an island, sir.

15
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,809
- Madhu, you go through the other side.

16
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,969
- I'll go this way.

17
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,809
- Do not be afraid. Just cover your face with that scarf.

18
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,987
- There! That's your bike, sir.

19
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,792
- They should be around here somewhere, sir.

20
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,094
- There they are, sir!

21
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,663
- See...

22
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,779
- ¡MÚDATE!

23
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,673
- Come here, you !! Do not mess!

24
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,776
Hey, I got it!

25
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,302
Did not I say I'd be in trouble, sir?

26
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,313
One month ago ...

27
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,033
Grown in the fertile soil of Kerala,

28
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,400
this fruit of the coconut palm,

29
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,744
the Kera fruit,

30
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,908
alias, coconut;

31
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,876
It is an instant remedy

32
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,380
for many types of dangerous diseases!

33
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,924
Dominic takes a little!

34
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,788
Those are the coconut candy.

35
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,331
Nice!

36
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,898
Made of coconut, right?

37
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,067
It is very tasty!

38
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,058
This is burfi coconut. And those are the cookies.

39
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,404
I did watching the cooking show on television.

40
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,099
Let's Monachan kids love it!

41
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,200
I do not like all this because I am diabetic.

42
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,006
By the grace of God, so far I have daibetes nor BP.

43
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,215
The you get soon!

44
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,182
What is this!

45
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,250

46
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,252
Grandma, I came here to ...

47
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,776
Kunjumol our wedding has been fixed.

48
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,921
It is 15 next month.

49
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,724
Where is working the groom?

50
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,782
It's in the police, Grandma!

51
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,859
Police?

52
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,061
It is a Subinspector.

53
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,050
That is good.

54
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,732
It is a sense of pride for all of us to have a sub-inspector in the family.

55
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,723
So how do you call? - Biju

56
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,763
Sub Inspector Biju. Nice name!

57
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,931
What is the real name of Kunjumol?

58
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,341
I keep forgetting.

59
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,308
Benitta

60
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,399
What?

61
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,738
Benitta Dominic.

62
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,404
Benitta Dominic.

63
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,015
Invite people to the wedding is so exhausting!

64
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,322
Dad, do not tell you that will form a family group on Facebook,

65
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,381
and publish an invitation there. It's so simple!

66
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,161
Is that grandfather who has one foot in the grave will be on Facebook?

67
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,722
You have no idea, Dad! Grandpa has two Facebook accounts now!

68
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,795
Is not sister? - Yes Dad!

69
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,994
That's not what I asked.

70
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,036
I received a proposal from a police officer long ago.

71
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,338
So why do not you marry him?

72
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,466
In those days, the police used to be so terrifying.

73
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,400
With red eyes, thick mustaches and what not!

74
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,002
He had very afraid of the police!

75
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,949
But our guy is very decent. You can tell that just by looking!

76
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,214
So true!! He is a sweetheart!

77
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,344
I wonder how to deal with bullies and all that!

78
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,153
It's not like an ordinary thug.

79
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,850
A seasoned veteran!

80
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,987
Mattancherry Martin!

81
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,855
He is a very bad temper!

82
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,156
It even has some 26 cases against him.

83
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,524
This morning,

84
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,234
at the junction of Thevara;

85
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,795
a guy parked his bike to the side of the bicycle of this type. I dont like him!

86
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,167
He is a bully, right? He lost his temper!

87
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,807
In the heat of argument, he pulled out his knife and stabbed the other guy!

88
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,513
That guy is in the ICU now.

89
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,448
He is alive. But the poor man lost a kidney!

90
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,142
You heard it, right?

91
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,049
He lost a kidney!

92
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,179

93
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,457

Have you caught any of them? Or should I go to catch myself?

102
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,331
If you can not do it, you're not fit enough to wear this uniform police!

103
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,339
As soon as a robbery case reported,

104
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,364

00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,675
Have people come to this agency?

184
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,379
Yes sir. - Send them.

185
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,381
How long has it been since you stopped going there?

186
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,507
Three weeks ago.

187
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,283
I come from Cherthala, sir.

188
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,683
I stopped when they did not even have money to travel.

189
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,693
This' Fly Overseas Manpower your company, right?

190
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,631
This girl has come here with a complaint that does not have his salary.

191
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,121
After working in your agency.

192
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,101
Sir, our company has some rules and regulations.

193
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,661
According to that, it must issue a notice 3 months ago

194
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,539
resign as the bonus that it has signed.

195
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,707
But she has not done that. That's the problem sir.

196
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,232
Lord, according to the rules and regulations,

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,646
They have to pay my salary properly after a month, right?

198
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,137
What was the salary offered to you? - 10,000.

199
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,549
10,000.

200
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,343
How many days you worked there? - 50 days

201
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,292
We have given 1000 as an advance, right?

202
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,123
(calculating)

203
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,394
Rs.15,000.

204
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,331
This is a very small amount, right? Can I not solve?

205
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,355
But sir, in the middle ...

206
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,734
Lord had gone there many times to ask.

207
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,668
But they said they will present a case.

208
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,738
I had no money to travel.

209
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,229
And I used to borrow money from my neighbor to go there.

210
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,742
My father is dead, sir.

211
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,370
I have only my mother and sister studying in the 12th.

212
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,241
We are in trouble, sir.

213
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,145
Who does not have difficulty, sir?

214
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,917
The company has a law and policy.

215
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,544
She has signed our joint venture agreement.

216
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,288
It makes no sense to speak emotionally as a complaint.

217
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,624
She's a woman, right? Should not we think on your side too?

218
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,717
At least she worked in the business for 50 days, right?

219
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,262
We have done everything correctly from our side.

220
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,196
Let her go to labor court if you want.

221
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,700
Not only that, this is not a case to be resolved in a police station.

222
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,237
Keep your mobile here. - huh?

223
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,538
Keep your mobile here.

224
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,706

00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,353

258
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,651
What happened to the serial number of your bike?

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,687
Your clamp is broken.

260
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,289
Yours? - The screw is gone.

261
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,916
Hey? - The screw is gone, sir.

262
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,015
Get away, you!

263
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,258
Where are you getting? Hey?

00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,795
I ASK what happened to her two plates together!

00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,768
You, cobras 118 in their names.

266
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,362
And put those two bikes in the manure pit in the backyard.

267
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,735
And make them stand on that corner. GET LOST!

268
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,307
Walk...

269
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,841
All papers are there, sir.

270
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,640
That original Kurup Sir .. - Yes, that's there.

271
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,847
Lord, papers ...

272
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,406
Hey, call that girl ...

273
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,724
Lord, all the papers are there.

274
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,698
Does the certificate protector of emigrants?

275
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,962
Lord, the act of the company and corporation certificates are there.

276
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,492
Not the certificate of the corporation. You send people abroad through your company, right?

277
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,774
You need a certificate of protector of emigrants for that. Do you have that?

278
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,072
I think what you are listening for the first time, sir.

279
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,537
Without knowing anything, you rent a room, you'll start a business,

280
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,615
and call the MD to deceive people.

281
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,913
Your! Ask a question about it.

282
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,953
Find out how many people have sent abroad without certificates.

283
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,990
Put the plug in your company. Submit a Flr about it and return it.

284
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,082
Lord, I'll pay your salary.

285
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,921
Do not!! You do not pay your salary!

286
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,587
Lord is my next wedding ... - your wedding to stop!

287
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,993
I will present a case of cheating on you.

288
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,032
And I'll stand here in my underwear.

289
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,796
And ask the media to print those photos. Let your wedding to stop!

290
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,470
At the least this girl will be safe.

291
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,937
Lord, I will pay those 15,000 rupees.

292
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,973
That's not what you said before, right?

293
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,008
I asked decently

294
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,710
to settle their salary.

295
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,007
And you told me?

296
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,847
Going to the labor court?

297
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,981
Lord ... that ... I ...

298
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,074
You should understand one thing!

299
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,648
The district court, the High Court and the Supreme Court of the poor,

300
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,122
It is this police station!

301
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,851
There will be solutions for each case here,

302
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,687
and take all kinds of 'dating'. Do you understand?

303
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,926
You just want your salary, right? - Yes sir.

304
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,827
Get it fixed. Right now!

305
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,530
Thank you very much sir.

306
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,179
THAN?

307
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:54,296
Finish DRC

308
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,394
Subair and tell me.

309
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,137
Lord, the matter is serious.

310
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,038
The call we received was genuine.

311
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,835
The child is seriously injured.

312
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,531
What, sir? - Take the jeep.

313
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,168
We must go to the General Hospital.

314
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,127
You are at the station?

315
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,221
No. I'm going to the general hospital for a case.

316
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,557
Are there other people with you? - yes.

317
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,733
Police.

318
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,768
What is it? Tell me. - Nothing.

319
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,668
If you're busy, call me later.

320
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,102
Where are you? At home?

321
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,141
Yes.

322
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,972
Will you call at night? - Good. I'll do that.

323
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,481
How is the boy?

324
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,895
Doctor, how's that boy with dog bite?

325
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,597
It is a deep wound.

326
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,531
And there is a fracture in his right hand.

327
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,066
That could have happened to the fall as he ran.

328
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,037
When I talked to the parents of the child,

329
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,267
the information we got was that it was not a stray dog,

330
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,566
but a dog deliberately sent someone to bite.

331
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,179
What happened exactly?

332
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,290
Dear Sir,

333
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,626
He had sent her to school in the morning.

334
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,560
And look how is lying here now.

335
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,796
What happened, child?

336
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,027
I pulled a handle I saw the way to school,

337
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:38,904
and then that guy in the house, untied his dog and said 'Catch'.

338
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,599
She was brutally bitten.

339
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,675
By the grace of God, he could save her. Or she would have died on the spot.

340
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,578
Children pluck flowers and throw stones at mangoes,

341
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,273
but how can someone send a dog to bite so?

342
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,915
Did you see the condition of my son?

343
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,849
Subair, take their statements. - Okay sir.

344
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,918
We do not worry you need.

345
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,787
He sat there as if nothing had happened.

346
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,017
At the least he could have checked what happened to the child.

347
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,191
He not even bothers.

348
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,819
It's a guy named Samson Tharakan. The name of your home is 'Kalayil'.

349
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,623
This problem happened in front of the complex. They brought here.

350
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,164
Lord has been doing this often.

351
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,827
Two months ago, he had put his dog in a woman selling fish like this.

352
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,995
It is bold that is rich and powerful, sir.

353
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,766
Sir, this is the house.

354
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,104
There is a crowd gathered here.

355
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,889
I've seen this somewhere fraud.

356
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,356
Sir, this is Pottakkuzhy Jose.

357
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,994
He was the one who made signs saying you hit people with coconuts at the station.

358
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,690
Posters would stick even against his own father.

359
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,837
Have I seen you somewhere?

360
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,040
I am the president of the youth wing of DNC. Pottakkuzhy Jose.

361
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,871
Biju Sl Paulose you know.

362
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,611
People here are making a fuss,

363
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,579
saying the dog bit some children ...

364
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,705
That's a trick to blackmail our brother for money.

365
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,306
Hermano ¿?. - Samson Tharakan.

366
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,142
Is someone very dear to us. This is his wife.

367
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,120
Where is Samson Sir?

368
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,781
Where did he go?

369
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
I do not know.

370
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,693
Give me his number.

371
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,803
It makes no sense to blame the children. Mangoes are ripe.

372
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,878
Not Alphonso Mango, Mini Sir? - No, this Priyoor. You can not see

373
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,038
You must start it before it ripens. O will decompose. I have it at home.

374
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,939
Hola ¿? Tharakan ¿Es Samson?

375
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,282
I Town Sl, Biju Paulose.

376
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,222
I received a complaint against him.

377
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,849
You'll have to come to the station.

378
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:39,891
Complain?

379
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,094
Bangalore?

380
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,220
When you return?

381
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,435
He is in Bangalore, right?

382
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,232
Brother is always so. Always on tour.

383
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,006
3 hours after the morning knowing if we call it,

384
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,701
tell who is in Japan.

385
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,111
JAPAN!

386
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,746
This is your number.

387
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,340
Call the Cibercelda and ask them to track their current location.

388
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,947
Sir, this is your Facebook page.

389
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,281
Samson Tharakan.

390
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,259
-Amazing. - The guy is having a ball!

391
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,162
He has many great contacts!

392
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,770
I'm not in the office at this time. Can you decode it and tell me?

393
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,246
¡Ah, it!

394
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,178
He is in Ernakulam itself.

395
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,277
They said the tower is near Maharaja College.

396
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,846
Lord, there are 2 clubs near Maharaja's. He could be there, most likely!

397
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:57,263
Finish DRC

398
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,504
We'll review the other club. He is not here, sir.

399
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,131
- review the other club, sir.

400
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,240
Okay, let's go.

401
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,512
You go and check.

402
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,878
Are we going by car, sir? - Yeah, well.

403
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,386
For for! Mini sir, that's your car there.

404
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,481
Which one? - There, that red. 999.

405
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,794
There was also a black Audi 999 at home, right?

406
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,921
He has a lot of those cars. - What does this guy?

407
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,765
Who knows! - There is!

408
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,289
With white beard and glasses French sun.

409
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,333
Call to fast Sir!

410
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,136
His bloody shirt florida and French beard!

411
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,908
Sir, he's here. In the club.

412
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,305
He is there? If you try to block them out. In agreement?

413
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,366
We're on our way!

414
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,446
Turn right.

415
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,215
Sir, he's in.

416
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,291
There's the guy.

417
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,188
I will not go anywhere this week.

418
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,519
I'll only be here.

419
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,893
Some small entertainment ...

420
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,057
If you want a good massage,

421
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,497
You should go to Bangkok.

422
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,603
Here everything is false ...

423
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,867
Do you know any place here? - There's a place

424
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,507
A wonderful place!

425
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,804
Who are you? What do you want?

426
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,076
I Biju Paulose.

427
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,043
Town Sl.

428
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,179
I received a complaint saying that he sent his dog to bite a child, sir.

429
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,415
I called to ask about it some time ago.

430
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,349
But you said he was in Bangalore, sir.

431
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,442
Why do I have to tell you where I'm going?

432
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:23,888
Nirbha

433
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:24,922
Start the jeep.

434
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,450
Come, go to the station.

435
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,491
You guys go I will go in my car.

436
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,928
Come here!

437
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,331
His bloody ...

438
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,565
Friend...

439
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,991
GET INN! - What are you doing?

440
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,902
I have to call my lawyer. - defending your damn!

441
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,063
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

442
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,075
Obtener INN!

443
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,635
When I asked you to come to the station,

444
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,240
for sending a dog to bite a poor child, what did you say?

445
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,573
I'm in a meeting. I am in Bangalore '. it's not like that?

446
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:25,310
I'm sending you on a pleasure trip to Bangalore a better place.

447
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,084
For that, there are some procedures more.

448
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,017
There will be many to call it, like ghosts from a bottle.

449
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,353
Remove the phone receiver.

450
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,106
We should return today to present to the Judge.

451
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,472
Lord, what this section will charge dog bite?

452
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,510
How many years have you been in this service?

453
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,477
Twenty.

454
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,604
Have you seen a book called Indian Penal Code?

455
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,681
Yes.

456
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,149
Section 324 read this.

457
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:08,557
Finish DRC

458
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,197
Voluntarily causing pain ..

459
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,164
Why?

460
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:17,565
By dangerous weapons or means ...

461
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,331
What are the other ways?

462
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,673
Gunfight!

463
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,374
Stab or cut!

464
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:35,008
Fire, or by any heated substance.

465
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:46,086
Or by any substance that is dangerous to the human body,

466
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,927
breathing, swallowing, or receive blood.

467
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,499
Now read the last.

468
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,037
That's!

469
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,476
Even if you send a dog to bite someone, it is included in this section!

470
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,510
It is understood?

471
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,633
Other than that,

472
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,170
As your hand has a fracture section 326 is applicable.

473
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,376
We'll have a grildlock!

474
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,182
And there's one more thing.

475
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,593
Hello sir,

476
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,320
I'm in front of Press Club.

477
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,455
There's a human interest story.

478
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,250
Sheesh! Is the MLA.

479
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,455
Hello sir.

480
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,184
Soy KC Varghese, MLA.

481
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,085
Have you arrested someone named Samson Tharakan?

482
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,593
Lord, is a case in which he sent a dog to bite a child from school.

483
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,197
- Do not worry about the case.

484
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,630
Is someone very dear to me.

485
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,091
I did not know I was close to you, sir.

486
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,101
Then you should do what it takes, Sl.

487
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,073
But sir, are their own young people that filed the complaint.

488
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,641
The whole audience was against him.

489
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,541
No solo eso, ya he presentado el caso, señor.

490
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,702
Y ahora los medios están aquí.

491
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,179
Si saben que lo llamó, es malo para usted, señor ...

492
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,285
¡Dios! ¡No no! Nadie debería saber que llamé.

493
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,688
Solo dile que Sansón, sin que nadie lo escuche,

494
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,519
que lo había llamado.

495
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,089
¡No lo lastimes!

496
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,590
¡De ninguna manera! No lo lastimaré, señor.

497
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,160
¡Bien entonces!

498
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,797
Es el MLA.

499
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,469
Esta...

500
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,628
It is a special gift for MLA recommendation for you!

501
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,468
Samson's lawyer has come.

502
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,245
Good. Send it in.

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,588
Lord, I am the lawyer of Samson Tharakan. Jayakrishnan.

504
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,623
Sit down.

505
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,193
Your?

506
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,628
Pottakkuzhy .. Jose Pottakkuzhy.

507
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,221
Stay outside. I'll call you if necessary.

508
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,265
Lord, it's not as if he had unleashed the dog to bite the child ...

509
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,307
Is a dog, right? It broke out in some way.

510
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,508
Not so, lawyer.

511
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,476
There are people who saw what happened exactly.

512
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,876
We have taken statements from the girl, her mother and other witnesses.

513
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,081
What are the sections you collected?

514
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,419
Can you exempt 326? - Impossible!

515
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,819
According to the report of the doctor, the child is seriously injured.

516
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,480
And a fracture in the upper elbow.

517
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,619
This guy is ruthless?

518
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,561
You should see the status of that child.

519
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,396
What if your daughter is facing such a problem?

520
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,363
That's true.

521
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,757
When are you going to court? It would be better if the open court.

522
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,193
Let me think about it. - Good.

523
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,238
They do not call from the office of the MLA?

524
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,412
I am the president of the youth wing here. - yes. We all know!

525
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,347
We can give some compensation and do this,

526
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,712
it's okay?

527
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,546
If necessary, I'll ask the office of the Minister of the Interior to call him.

528
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,745
This is a simple matter, right?

529
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,257
I'll call you. Please stand outside.

530
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,268
Do not let the black and white fraud here under any circumstances!

531
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,929
Under any circumstances! Has anyone else come?

532
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,899
Brother of these 'monsters' has come.

533
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,939
Let them go.

534
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,808
Come here!

535
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,605
Who are you to them?

536
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,783
Brother.

537
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,215
He is the son of my aunt.

538
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,320
Children are good, sir. It's not a problem!

539
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,254
YOU ARE YET MORE PROBLEM THAT THESE TWO!

540
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,957
Now who come to your bond on?

541
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,391
Missing his two enrollments at the same time.

542
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,554
Were not you who wrested a string Panampilly Nagar few days ago?

543
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,427
We do not take these things in size, sir. - huh?

544
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,634
Does taking that size? What is this?

545
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,534
Is this the language in which you talk to a Sl?

546
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,670
What wonder, language? - So you heard?

547
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,973
Are you trying to teach me?

548
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,440
What did you study? - 12th.

549
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,976
After that, lT.

550
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,244
Did you spend lT?

551
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,779
I was not completely, sir. And 12?

552
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,837
I did not spend the 12th too.

553
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,549
So you failed and did not pass 12 lT. Then this is what you do!

554
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,517
I put away the license plates, you'll use helmets,

555
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,712
snatching chains and walk at night, right?

556
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,447
We do not use helmets, sir. - Why?

557
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,285
The hair will be screwed. - huh?

558
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,257
If we use helmets, our hair will be damaged.

559
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,419
Unleash your hair!

560
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:18,701
Finish DRC

561
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,302
Go for a swim, you!

562
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,930
So you need money to keep this aspect 'rare', right?

563
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,374
No sir, we live tiles and with those profits.

564
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,346
How much you win if you place chips for a day?

565
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,404
Around Rs.900.

566
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,277
What is your daily spending?

567
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,709
100 for gasoline,

568
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:33,951
entonces has

569
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,220
food and all will reach about 235 ..

570
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,846
Then, after spending those 235, how will I be?

571
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,724
That..

572
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,927
Is 700 something, sir?

573
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,894
700 something?

574
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,260
You ask me that? You sit there and calculate.

575
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,697
Here? - Not there!

576
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,528
Mini, show him how.

577
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,803
Sit well.

578
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,837
700 ..

579
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,439
Lord, the report detention of Samson is ready.

580
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,817
Should not we take a medical examination? Call him here.

581
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,286
600?

582
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,356
600?

583
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,725
You should have studied well when you went to school!

584
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,558
If you answer this, I'll leave! - 665.

585
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,629
Not 665?

586
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,400
Sir, I'm tense. Can you give me another math problem?

587
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,705
Hello!

588
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,873
Mr. Samson,

589
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,670
Let's see a doctor now.

590
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,744
When you see, the doctor will ask:

591
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,371
If you have any difficulty

592
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,547
It ie when the police hit you.

593
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,514
So what you say, sir? He will say that has not been beaten. Right?

594
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,651
By chance,

595
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,414
if you even try to say you hit or hurt you,

596
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,853
then they do not take the judge's house in the doctor's car.

597
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,721
It will be in the jeep of my apartment.

598
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,527
Inside the jeep, I'll give more doses.

599
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,530
And I will push down the vehicle.

600
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,999
By trying to escape while I'm in custody, I will add more a case for you!

601
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,335
That too,

602
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,605
Only if you're alive then!

603
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,440
It is because he is a heterosexual officer.

604
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,668
You will not hear anyone.

605
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:04,901
What heterosexual?

606
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,874
All this is just a show.

607
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,748
If I work hard, he will not be on that song tomorrow.

608
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,715
And the bond ..

609
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,775
The deposit is not required. If we called the office of the Minister of the Interior now,

610
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,444
We can deal with everything smoothly.

611
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,553
Lord, what about us?

612
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,756
Both plates for their bikes have to manage alone here.

613
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,591
¡Córtate hair and wears helmets! - OK sir.

614
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:30,968
It is understood? - Yes sir.

615
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,663
The lawyer will come there with bail.

616
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,568
What if you send a dog to bite?

617
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,073
People even runs away with murder. Then this is nothing!

618
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,699
It's just playing a trick!

619
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:43,072
I have noticed both. At the moment, you pay the fine and go!

620
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,083
Lord, I have been waiting for quite some time now.

621
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,914
You did not call me. - It is urgent?

622
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,920
Is this great event?

623
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,622
To act so difficult?

624
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,159
However great a policeman;

625
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,492
a politician, that too of the ruling party;

626
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,463
You have to show some respect.

627
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,134
What if you need a transfer, sir?

628
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,002
La gente como nosotros tiene que hacer lo necesario, ¿verdad?

629
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:08,802
Pero eso no significa que te transfiera, ¿de acuerdo?

630
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,165
USTED SCUMBAG!

631
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,178
¡DEBE ESTAR CONSCIENTE DONDE ESTÁ Y CON QUIÉN ESTÁ HABLANDO!

632
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,406
¡¡Transferir!!

633
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,945
¡Arriba el tuyo!

634
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,380
Después de Post Graduation & M.Phil, dejé mi trabajo como profesor universitario;

635
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,751
escribió la prueba Sl, obtuvo el primer rango y vino para este trabajo;

636
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,492
¡No venir y afeitarse (servir) para idiotas como tú!

637
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,084
Cuando me estaba controlando,

638
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,856
quieres ser un dolor en mi trasero, ¿verdad?

639
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,826
Si abres tu boca grande una vez más,

640
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,957
¡Te agarraré de las piernas y te golpearé contra esa pared!

641
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,595
¡No me conoces lo suficientemente bien!

642
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,661
Transferencia ... Sangriento ...

643
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,839
¡MOVIMIENTO!

644
00:35:49,213 --> 00:36:01,592
Temm DrC

645
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,934
Samson Señor, vamos a encontrarnos con el juez ahora.

646
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,535
Con las secciones que he cargado, definitivamente no recibirás fianza.

647
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:21,169
So if you try to annoy me and say something to the judge ...

648
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,015
We will pay all seizures of bail ordered by the Court, sir.

649
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,712
Lawyer, section 326.

650
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,152
I can not allow bail until prosecutors carry out a trial.

651
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:39,963
Samson,

652
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,589
What you understood this?

653
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,969
All your contacts and relationships have ended,

654
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,530
If a proud policeman stands in your way with wide open chest!

655
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,507
Sir, no sir !!

656
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,812
I have fear of the police station, sir!

657
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:37,978
A tight slap ...

658
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,291
He was angry, sir.

659
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,127
Stop crying!

660
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,796
Inspector, what right has to hit someone?

661
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,840
We have received many complaints against you.

662
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,842
Human rights!

663
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,113
Who do you shout from the roof?

664
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,817
The guy who protests that hit him is a criminal born!

665
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,580
Do you have any idea about its history?

666
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,144
Criminal is the police terminology, sir.

667
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,756
You do not have circular PGD to behave decently,

668
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,160
the petitioners and defendants in the police station?

669
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,199
Now that I think about it,

670
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,962
what you say is very true, ma'am!

671
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,694
For example,

672
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,367
Who is he to you? - My husband.

673
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,877
When you and your spouse go out to walk at night,

674
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,116
That means,

675
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,014
Imagine that you grabbed the ass!

676
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,843
Sit down, sit down!

677
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,288
Let me finish..

678
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,286
Your husband saw it, react to it.

679
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,758
I do not know if you react ...

680
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,295
Anybody But you have a mustache under the nose react!

681
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,797
And then that slacker hits her husband who tried to react.

682
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,163
When you come to the police station, I will ask the loafer;

683
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,171
'' Oh 'Alma Noble,

684
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,268
It is not insisting on this noble derrivre who is the wife of another,

685
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,715
a heinous act?

686
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,783
'' Should I assume that you have no objections,

687
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,785
me taking disciplinary action against you?

688
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:19,415
"I think you would not be involved in such vulgar acts from now on!"

689
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,326
Should I ask all this and let him go alone?

690
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,385
Maybe you just want that.

691
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,431
But the common man want the guy get a good shot!

692
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,729
And if I catch those teams, I beat you!

693
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,935
I'll give you a real beating!

694
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,027
You make what you can!

695
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,838
Do not'm a priest!

696
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,072
I'm a POLLCEMAN!

697
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,674
And you should understand one thing.

698
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,701
It is only by the police, and fear of the police strike,

699
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:44,111
Let no one open the door and rape you at night while you sleep!

700
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:57,122
Finish DRC

701
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,778
I hit me when I asked for the money I lent him, sir.

702
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,925
Sit down.

703
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,694
Complains Thomas's wife, Baby.

704
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,435
Who's baby?

705
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,793
I am baby, sir.

706
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,131
And that? - My name is Mary, sir.

707
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,809
I accompanied her because he was afraid of going to the police station.

708
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,878
So you are not afraid, Mary? - I'm afraid, sir.

709
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,973
I'm afraid of the police and the police station since childhood.

710
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,448
But I came because she was there with me.

711
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,787
It does not have to be afraid of the police or the police station!

712
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:03,383
We are here to solve your problems. It is understood?

713
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,992
What is the problem? Kanakambaran? So is?

714
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,394
Kanakambaran es nuestro vecino, señor.

715
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,197
Quiere bañarse por la mañana una vez que mi esposo y mis hijos se vayan.

716
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,736
Bañarse no está mal, ¿verdad? - El baño está bien, señor.

717
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,774
Él no tiene una cerca. No va a poner uno.

718
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,043
Cuando le pedimos que construya un baño, no lo hará.

719
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,034
Quiere venir al lado de nuestra casa y bañarse.

720
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,009
Se baña mostrando todo, señor.

721
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,582
No tienes que mirar a ese lado, ¿verdad?

722
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,584
Si no lo hago, hace un sonido de 'ssshh' y me llama.

723
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,313
When we hear that sound, we'll look, sir.

724
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,444
Is not there anyone at home? Wife? Children?

725
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,421
His wife left him when he was showing everything to everybody.

726
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,924
Are you crazy or something?

727
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,160
How you look the?

728
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,127
SA and ...

729
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,029
Short, dark ...

730
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,020
and looks like a frog! - yes. That's him!

731
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,026
Looks very bad, sir.

732
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,232
So if it looked good,

733
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,860
It would have been fine, right?

734
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:53,004
Finish DRC

735
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,437
Stop joking, sir!

736
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,072
So ... Where is this guy now?

737
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,150
He is at home, sir. He was there when I left.

738
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,152
You, go get this guy.

739
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,881
And action must be immediate!

740
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,357
Do not worry, okay?

741
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,915
At the end of my season,

742
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,993
Do not tolerate any kind of violence against women!

743
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,052
Lord, give him a good shot! - I promise!

744
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,925
Have not you heard of him?

745
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,833
No. I heard.

746
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,802
Well then. I'll call you when necessary.

747
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,000
We will leave your bathroom business!

748
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,374
It is called Mini, sir?

749
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,306
Is it not a female name?

750
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,440
So you're no longer afraid?

751
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,260
How it identified that 1 MO marijuana was found?

752
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,160
From my years of experience, so far.

753
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,194
Sr. Jimmy, puede recordar a Mary v / s State of Kerala,

754
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,870
in that, the division bench had clearly stated:

755
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,464
If a narcotic experienced officer identifies,

756
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,608
It is as an expert opinion.

757
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,906
It is said that you hit the defendant.

758
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:04,141
I say that my client did decent, good, innocent and truthful

759
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,445
He confesses to beating him. It is true?

760
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,313
Do not beat the defendant.

761
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,262
Soy Attingal DYSP, Shahjahan.

762
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,889
Sir namaskar. Good Morning!

763
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,033
My name is Biju Paulose, sir.

764
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:59,491
Lord, worked under you during the trial period in Mavelikkara.

765
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:00,627
Oh. It's you?

766
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,001
How have you been?

767
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,409
Cl Who is there now? - Is Manoj Mathew, sir.

768
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,036
So is? I do not know well.

769
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,545
And yes, I called because,

770
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,081
a criminal defendant in about 40 cases here,

771
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,174
Karate Rajesh, is escaping after he was released on bail.

772
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,242
He is accused in the murder case of Attingal Mercy and in the case of murder of Mottammal Rajan.

773
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,222
He is also involved in snatching and quote!

774
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,713
I have some information that had passed the limit of your station.

775
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,192
We have to catch him.

776
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,591
And it is quite dangerous.

777
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,425
He is also accused of stabbing a policeman in a court complex.

778
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,564
I look for, sir.

779
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,965
Sir, if you have a number or his photo;

780
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,695
You Can Whatsapp for me?

781
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,035
I know, sir. Karate Rajesh.

782
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,368
How do you know?

783
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,076
I met him when I was in jail.

784
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,203
Where is he from? - He is only Kochi.

785
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,081
But he ran away from here during childhood and settled in Trivandrum.

786
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,073
In between, he comes here for certain jobs and returns once over.

787
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,552
We have to catch him.

788
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:51,121
It should not be fixed after giving information, sir.

789
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,247
You will not have any problems!

790
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,359
If you can guarantee it, I get information through our children here.

791
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
How many cases have now? - 12 cases, sir.

792
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:01,325
Después de que me habló, no he creado ningún problema, señor.

793
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:11,063
¡Basta tú! ¡Para! - Piérdete!

794
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,153
¡Movimiento!

795
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:28,792
¡Ven!

796
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:31,795
¡Ven!

797
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,633
¡Aquí!

798
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,600
¡Piérdase!

799
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,797
Usted borracho! ¡La policía ha venido!

800
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,440
¡Policía! ¡Policía!

801
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,314
Hijo,

802
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,716
¡¡Te vas!!

803
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,411
Savarigirigiri .. (imitando a Mohanlal)

804
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,782
¡He visto suficientes policías!

805
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,289
Come and get on the jeep!

806
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,290
What?

807
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,349
Patea that guy and put it in the jeep!

808
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,456
Lord, has had two heart attacks.

809
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,587
- I could die even if you touch it!

810
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:09,433
Lord, should we take this risk? It could become a death in custody.

811
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,400
¡Pegame!

812
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,236
Hit me! I have no problem!

813
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,294
Should I hit him? - Do not!

814
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,067
I have another medicine for him.

815
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,806
Torture-Apply your third grade! Third degree!

816
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,513
Madhu, the plant starts itching.

817
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,172
Ripped man!

818
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,822
Can not you wear underwear?

819
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,627
Your show is where women and others go?

820
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,495
Two strokes and your problem will be solved, sir.

821
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,462
Hit me, sir.

822
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,187
Your happiness is my happiness. I do not care!

823
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,291
Did you stop to undress when you saw the police?

824
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,393
Police to Look!

825
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,403
Do you want to undress in front of the public, right?

826
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,377
I'll meet you itching today!

827
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,639
We are going? - yeah!

828
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,712
Friend!

829
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,679
¿Te pica?

830
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,371
What a show put!

831
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,217
Walk you!

832
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,519
Let pique you!

833
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,397
Lord, it itches a lot!

834
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,796
We'll get rid of your itching!

835
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,230
Lord, it itches a lot!

836
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,735
Come in!!

837
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,270
¡Arrancando, señor! - ¡Vete!

838
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,532
¿Que eres? ¿Caballo?

839
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,669
Ponlo en esa celda.

840
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,714
Señor, ¡pica! Por favor, rasca por mí, señor.

841
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,718
¡Te daré una patada!

842
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,276
¡Tu sangriento espectáculo de striptease!

843
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,594
Señor, por favor, ¡déjame rascarme! - ¡Cállate!

844
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,460
¿Cuál es su nombre?

845
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,230
Shirley, señor.

846
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,796
Siéntate, Shirley.

847
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,907
Kumar

848
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,577
Who is this Kumar? What's your problem with it?

849
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,943
It is a car driver from the station near my house.

850
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,713
I slapped strong on the road today.

851
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,818
Did he give you a slap in the face like that?

852
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,785
So!

853
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,252
What is the connection between you two? How do you know?

854
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,618
Without connection. I used to travel in his car before.

855
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,921
I have not done that in a while. Then he avenged that!

856
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,296
Has he come?

857
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,388
Yes sir. - Call him!

858
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,293
Mini Lord, bring it here.

859
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,264
Come and stand here.

860
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,431
What is your name?

861
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,508
Kumar

862
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,475
¿Solo Kumar?

863
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,577
Only Kumar, sir.

864
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,635
Does slapped?

865
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:35,700
Yes sir.

866
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,508
That is good. Good answer!

867
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,281
Why you slapped?

868
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,918
Because I was angry, sir.

869
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,715
And I know why you were angry?

870
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,321
She did not look up my phone.

871
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,415
To slap her no answer, what relationship do you have? Hey?

872
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:51,358
There is no relationship, sir. I am married and have my husband and my children.

873
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,453
Go outside. Let me talk with him.

874
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:04,264
Finish DRC

875
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,305
Did you see your style, sir?

876
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,852
Why you slapped?

877
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,548
When he got into the car of another boy, I could not stand it!

878
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,723
How old are you?

879
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,325
I have 46 years, this 16.

880
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,384
Love for 46 years.

881
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,261
Your,

882
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,722
It must be buffeted by two things.

883
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,733
One,

884
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,031
WE slapped her face in public!

885
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:33,967
And in second place,

886
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,841
You'd fall in love with this article!

887
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,808
it's not like that?

888
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,477
You mean something else?

889
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,547
Call this woman here.

890
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,919
What should I do? Should I file a case against him?

891
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,858
No need to load a case, sir. - Now that you've filed a complaint,

892
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,349
What should I do? - I should not hurt!

893
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,563
Did you hear that?

894
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,531
She says she does not want to charge a case!

895
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,428
But as you slapped,

896
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,431
Should give you a gift. Come here.

897
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,730
Sir, I am in charge of your expenses.

898
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,008
I buy everything from rice to oil every week.

899
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,999
- Why Lord? My husband is not dead!

You know what she tells me?

902
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,081
His life should not be damaged because of his mother.

903
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,584
Your daughter mom calling you? - yes. Not only that, sir ...

904
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,917

We will stop calling and talking ...

906
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,050
But I will not leave, sir!

907
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,993
So there are calls and chats and all, sir!

908
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,654
He will not slap like that, right?

909
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,390
Lord, free yourself from this trouble somehow!

Si llego a saber que la apoyaste o la lastimaste,

913
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,832
No. Si tú lo dices, la olvidaré.

914
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,999
¡Pero también debes decirle a ella que no se acuerde de mí!

915
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,076

00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:40,915
¡Ve, ve!

1074
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,916
¡Deja ir la ambulancia!

1075
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:49,558
¡Movimiento!

1076
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,296
¿Por qué llevaron a esa mujer sola a la ambulancia?

1077
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,161
¿No encontraron al niño?

1078
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,292
Si ese niño está muerto, será un caso de asesinato contra esa señora.

1079
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,087
¿Por qué nadie llevó al niño al hospital?

1080
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,577
El niño está muerto, señor.

1081
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,915
¿Cómo puedes confirmar que el niño está muerto? ¿No debería decir eso el médico?

1082
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,081
¿Que pasó?

1083
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,050
Una mujer saltó al agua para suicidarse, junto con este niño.

1084
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,956
Hay un ligero latido del corazón. ¡Consigue la succión, rápido!

1085
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,321
Hermana, córtale el vestido. Dale oxígeno, rápido!

1086
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,898
Ella está viva.

1087
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,431
Espero que ella sobreviva.

1088
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:59,746
Temm DrC

1089
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,693
Lo siento, señor. No pudimos revivirla.

1090
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,465
Intentamos nuestro máximo.

1091
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,253
Do not worry we will not find out.

1092
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,242
What is it?

1093
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,584
That kind of Marine who jumped to save is gone now.

1094
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,423
Sir, he's gone!

1095
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,352
The saved!

1096
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,052
Did you receive any information, sir?

1097
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,330
One minute.

1098
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,459
I'm in the hospital.

1099
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,329
The mother is safe. -And the boy?

1100
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,160
The child is dead, sir.

1101
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,034
That's not the problem now. A Navy officer who jumped to save them,

1102
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,506
and his friend needed now is investigating.

1103
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,440
But they did not save them in a pot of CLSF?

1104
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,478
Indagas there. - Okay sir.

1105
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,674
Can not you try to contact your mobile? - Your mobile phone is with me, sir.

1106
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,076
I gave it before you leap.

1107
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,216
Now everyone is asking this.

1108
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,484
I have no idea what to say. - One minute!

1109
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,023
- Do not be uptight!

1110
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,225
¿Puede ella hablar ahora?

1111
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,631
El paciente está semiconsciente. Ella esta respondiendo.

1112
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:21,792
¿Puedes escucharme?

1113
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,605
Cuando saltaste del puente, alguien saltó para salvarte.

1114
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,233
¿Recuerdas haberlo visto?

1115
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,473
Tu hijo está a salvo. No le ha pasado nada.

1116
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,117
El hombre que te salvó está desaparecido ahora. Por eso te pregunto.

1117
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:37,314
¿Sabes algo? ¿No estaba él allí cuando te llevaron en el bote?

1118
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,176
¿Puedes escucharme?

1119
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,687
Mi hijo ... - ¿Te acuerdas?

1120
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,690
¿Nada en absoluto?

1121
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,796
She killed the child and is now screaming his name.

1122
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,400
She should be slapped!

1123
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,586
Tell me the number of the officer CLSF.

1124
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:29,467
They think they saw two hands drowning while saving the lady and the child.

1125
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,542
What did you say, sir?

1126
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,306
You should not worry about getting into a boat somewhere.

1127
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,280
Lord, should be in danger!

1128
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,477
I said jump and requested me to report.

1129
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,211
Or else she had jumped.

1130
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,276
Should we call the Cochin Port Trust, sir?

1131
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,513
Guard have, right?

1132
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,091
Or ... it's been so long ... so ...

1133
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:25,927
Finish DRC

1134
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,655
To speak in this Independence Day,

1135
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,697
We have Deputy Inspector Biju Paulose city with us.

1136
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,924
I cordially invite you to go to the meeting.

1137
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:12,933
Greetings to all.

1138
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,606
First, I wish you all a happy Independence Day.

1139
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,909
You are going through the most beautiful phase of life;

1140
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,450
Esa es tu vida escolar.

1141
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,811
Narraré un recuerdo de mi vida escolar.

1142
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,518
Cuando estudiaba en 5º estándar,

1143
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,326
por hacer algo malo en la escuela;

1144
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,528
mi profesor de clase - profesor de Sicilykkutty

1145
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,928
Me dio una buena paliza en el muslo con un bastón.

1146
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,831
Había una marca en mi muslo por esa paliza y estaba tenso.

1147
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,603
El problema fue que

1148
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,005
Por la noche, era mi madre quien solía bañarme.

1149
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,666
Para que se vea esa marca.

1150
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,933
If the teacher hit me, it must be because I did something wrong;

1151
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,910
then my mother also scolded me and hit me.

1152
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,947
I told him I was sick and not bathe me that day.

1153
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,351
At the next day, the mark had not disappeared, and neither bathed me that day.

1154
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,285
But the next day my mother saw him.

1155
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,987
So to save myself, I said;

1156
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:02,388
everyone in the class got beatings, and less.

1157
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,860
Even if you tell them I got beat up,

1158
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,658
my parents never had asked the teacher Sicilykkutty,

1159
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,425
why she gave him up to his son.

1160
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,398
Even today, when he meets the teacher, my mother says;

1161
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,665
With the blessings of the teacher, only good things will have happened.

1162
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,331
Now times have changed.

1163
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,576
I receive many complaints in my police station,

1164
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,806
saying that students are being beaten by teachers.

1165
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,376
I'm talking about my experience;

1166
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,277
When teachers punish you,

1167
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,977
there is always a protective armor of love,

1168
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,710
But this armor of love will not be there,

1169
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,255
by the punishments given by the police and the public.

1170
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,820
Previously, when we were forced to stand on a bench,

1171
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,553
when friends used to make fun of us,

1172
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,721
We used to get strength and endurance coping,

1173
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,923
some unknown force.

1174
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:45,026
Why do I say this here?

1175
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,029
Even yesterday I saw a suicide.

1176
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,936
A woman jumped into the water from the bridge Venduruthy with your child.

1177
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,061
The child died

1178
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,538
and an intelligent officer of the Navy who jumped to save them disappeared.

1179
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,440
Only when they have the strength to face a crisis,

1180
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,304
People kill themselves.

1181
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,917
The courage to face any kind of situation;

1182
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,086
and strength to fly high and conquer the world;

1183
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,520
It is achieved through your school life.

1184
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,648
I wish that all they do, with the blessings of his teachers.

1185
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,060
Thank you!

1186
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:04,572
We will not drink in bars and liquor stores. (repeat)

1187
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,782
Will you drink at home?

1188
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:07,806
We can?

1189
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,111
Do not you should drink at home too!

1190
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,415
I do not drink at home too. - Now I say all three together!

1191
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,657
We will not drink beverages in shops, bars or homes.

1192
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,624
What is it?

1193
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,750
That car driver Kumar has come.

1194
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,127
¡Oye!

1195
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:20,796
Ahead.

1196
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:22,964
Go stand there.

1197
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:27,662
Sir, I did not ask him this dirty guy who does not follow me and bother me?

1198
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:28,964
And you know what he did today?

1199
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,740
While riding on a bus, he stopped in a style film;

1200
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,139
and he pulled me holding my hand.

1201
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,973
I went to tell him not'll never bother you again.

1202
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,170
He is lying, sir.

1203
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,846
When I sat on the bus, he stood out;

1204
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,851
And so I gave a flying kiss.

1205
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:45,554
Did not I tell the last time not to follow her?

1206
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,689
What's wrong with you?

1207
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,088
I was not giving a flying kiss, sir.

1208
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,124
I just asked: how can you do this?

1209
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,591
Is that how you ask that?

1210
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,992
Not only that, you know what you're saying now?

1211
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,992
There's something between us now ...

1212
01:08:58,567 --> 01:08:59,534
YOU!

1213
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,993
You'd finish today!

1214
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,969
Lord, do not do anything from now on. Promise!

1215
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,006
I swear!

1216
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,142
Your!

1217
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,570
So if you break the promise,

1218
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,044
let my head explode. it's not like that?

1219
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,748
And then, sir ... Shut up bitch!

1220
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,215
Bla bla bla going nonstop.

1221
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,143
The two should leave the limit of my station.

1222
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,588
¡A Kalamasshery, donde Panangad the Sea!

1223
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,749
Never should see you again!

1224
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,423
The wedding is approaching,

1225
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,016
And he is making false promises in my head!

1226
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,594
Get out both!

1227
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:28,962
God, I must be careful!

1228
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,723
There's something wrong with my horoscope.

1229
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,963
"Police, get lost!"

1230
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:42,967
"The police do not care!"

1231
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:52,520
Finish DRC

1232
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,082
Comrades, sit down! Sit down comrades!

1233
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,754
You sit down all of you!

1234
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:04,232
Our march against corruption of this government is a great success!

1235
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,468
Do not think you can knock us down with your police force!

1236
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:18,072
(Chants slogans)

1237
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,151
I'll Kochi tomorrow afternoon.

1238
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,277
Will you be there?

1239
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,144
Hi? I can not hear you!

1240
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,023
"Police, get lost!"

1241
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,150
There is a lot of disturbance. I can not hear you.

1242
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,188
I'll call you back.

1243
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:33,261
Good.

1244
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:38,862
"Long ago a lot, have not you gone on strike?"

1245
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:45,271
"To change shorts for pants, dinos, oh police!"

1246
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:54,512
'' The King of Corruption Johnny KC should resign ''

1247
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,117
'' Minister KC corrupt Johnny ''

1248
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,019
'' Renounce and come back! ''

1249
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,951
- Hey, you are not cool?

1250
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,955
They came in the morning, sir!

1251
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:09,164
Tired after being on the fuss, right? - This is our daily routine man!

1252
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,563
Madhu Lord, do you want a bun?

1253
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,170
Lord, CM will. I have to go down the route.

1254
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,797
Of Aroor, I as a pilot.

1255
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,608
When I called the control room, they said CM had reached Harippad.

1256
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,337
This will end now. I will go once this is done.

1257
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,577
Good.

1258
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,180
Finish DRC

1259
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,856
- Lord, CM has passed Cherthala.

1260
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,993
18 Mobile Alpha 2, I am now in Thevara.

1261
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,722
Look after the death of CM.

1262
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:40,996
All clear, sir.

1263
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,104
As soon as CM Madavana pass,

1264
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,365
I will let you know.

1265
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,043
Thereafter, Nirbhan vehicles should block the Fort Kochi.

1266
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,136
Subair, vehicles blocking the ferry Thevara.

1267
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,338
Set of toll control.

1268
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:01,748
'' You have no control! Who took you to the police force?

1269
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:04,377
¿Eh?

1270
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,678
Did you hear something?

1271
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,025
Who is this?

1272
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,195
All stations, mobile units and CRV;

1273
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:15,130
Take note of all wireless sets.

1274
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,597
A set has been stuck.

1275
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:17,756
Be careful. Over!

1276
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,867
Over?

1277
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,302
Few overs?

1278
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,794
Who's hitting now?

1279
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,040
¿Eh?

1280
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,240
Have you taken any decision on Sreesanth?

1281
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,613
To control. Snake!

1282
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:33,181
¿Cobra?

1283
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,280
Friend, I'm not Cobra.

1284
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:37,885
I am the King Cobra.

1285
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:44,122
Find out from where the current wireless communication is occurring;

1286
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,726
And find out what station has been issued; immediately!

1287
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:49,964
Yes there are,

1288
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,628

1289
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:53,902
I!

1290
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:55,036

1291

Lord, was issued to P18. 4679 set of numbers. Over.

1292
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,176
Hey? Are we missing?

1293
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,445
India,

1294
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,180
India not know through the media;

1295
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:09,183
India poor, hungry and illegal ...

1296
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,009

1297
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,284
illiterat .. Ah! Leave that!

1298
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:18,392
A poor India, prostitutes and pimps!

1299
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,896
Mini, did you miss your wireless connection somewhere?

1300
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,022
To understand that,

1301
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,465
You should make sense;

1302
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,762
sensitivity;

1303
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,457
and censorship !!

1304
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,803
After VVlP duty, Town Sl have to inform me immediately!

1305
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,742
Silence please!

1306
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,239
The Prime Minister will arrive ten minutes late!

1307
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,743
You all are going to have tea! Over!

1308
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,426
All of you are here? - Yes sir.

1309
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,795
Town Cl & Sl

1310
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,137
Los dos grandes hombres, por favor, levántate, ¡déjame verte bien!

1311
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,979
Señor, 5 años.

1312
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,774
¿Sabes cuántos barrios hay en tu jurisdicción?

1313
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,285
8 salas, señor.

1314
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:20,255
¿Cuál sería la población aproximada allí?

1315
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,517
Alrededor de 2 mil rupias, señor.

1316
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,985
Durante tu entrenamiento en la academia de policía,

1317
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,927
¿No te enseñaron cuál es la responsabilidad principal de un inspector secundario?

1318
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:31,394
Señor, para proteger la vida y la propiedad del público.

1319
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,127
Life and? - Property.

1320
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,329
Are all their properties police station instead?

1321
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,531
How many wireless devices you are in your station?

1322
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:39,763
6 cordless sets, sir.

1323
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,874
How many are there today?

1324
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:46,542
You, who can not protect a single wireless set of the police station;

1325
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:52,185
How will protect property around 2 lakh people in your jurisdiction?

1326
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,887
What has to say Cl about this?

1327
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,025
Lord ... that ...

1328
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,424
I asked or report. -I ask!

1329
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:00,860
Completed work!

1330
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,487
And we will receive an explanation soon.

1331
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,327
Yes Yes! Your usual song!

1332
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,195
By Cl,

1333
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,861
It's a serious loss of supervision!

1334
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,931
What police lost?

1335
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,404
How's that guy

1336
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,533
He is decent, sir.

1337
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,109
And you have to catch the one who stole the wireless connection immediately!

1338
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,184
We'll do it, sir!

1339
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,377
Vuelves y compruebas una vez más a fondo,

1340
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,183
para ver si has perdido solo la conexión inalámbrica.

1341
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,918
¡Si eres así, incluso te robaría la ropa interior!

1342
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,825
¡Véalos mirándose sin vergüenza!

1343
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,065
¿Por qué el Comisionado convocó de repente una conferencia?

1344
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,600
¡La discusión fue sobre ti!

1345
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,168
¿Sobre mi? ¿¿Que hay de mí??

1346
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,069
¿No eres la nueva estrella de la ciudad?

1347
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:49,369
¡No tengo idea de dónde perdí esa cosa!

1348
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,307
Madhu Señor, no estabas conmigo ...

1349
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:54,575
Si claro! Ahora él me hará perder mi trabajo también.

1350
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,050
El Comisario me ha pedido que presente un informe especial.

1351
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,087
El problema empeoró porque,

1352
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,857
ese idiota abusó del ministro y comisionado a través de ese conjunto.

1353
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:04,052
Verdadero señor. ¡Esos abusos fueron tan sangrientos!

1354
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,993
Mini, ¿todavía tienes ese cultivo y cultivo de banano?

1355
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,129
Todo eso va bien.

1356
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,666
¡Los plátanos que viste la última vez cuando llegaste allí han madurado!

1357
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,930
From now on, it will be better if you concentrate on that.

1358
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,097
Lord, do not do this!

1359
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,637
I can not handle all this together. Three children go to school!

1360
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,134
They have called for an inquiry. Let's see.

1361
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,073
The commissioner is really angry.

1362
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,906
It makes no sense to talk to him now. Let's all calm down.

1363
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,579
You're on call, right?

1364
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,082
Can not you use your uniform correctly?

1365
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,921
If that AC or commissioner comes and sees you as well,

1366
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,149
You will be suspended on the spot!

1367
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,450
Lord, somehow ...

1368
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,658
Ah Let me see.

1369
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,588
He dragged my name there, as well!

1370
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,423
What to say now!

1371
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,658
During the conference, I was abused and forth in front of everyone.

1372
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,662
How can I be so forgetful?

1373
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,469
Our department is hoping to find a reason to suspend people.

1374
01:16:53,642 --> 01:17:01,139
Finish DRC

1375
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,552
He came to present a petition, sir. Just then, he fired the gun Mini Sir!

1376
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,052
What is this?

1377
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,496
I've no idea what happened, sir!

1378
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,191
Like you said, I was doing my proper dress ...

1379
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,632
this weapon too ..

1380
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,600
I think it's a bad time for me, sir.

1381
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,068
Lord, he is alive!

1382
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,213
Fast Take him to the hospital!

1383
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:37,518
Mr,

1384
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,380
I think that this is flawed!

1385
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,250
COMING TO MY CHEST NOW!

1386
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,159
And so?

1387
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:46,228
And that..

1388
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,957
Fue suspendido! - Suspendido?

1389
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,765
Ambos casos fueron golpeados como un paquete,

1390
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,926
y el Comisionado anunció la suspensión en el acto!

1391
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,193
Sheesh! ¡Pobre tipo!

1392
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,270
¿Fue suspendido por los disparos o por perder la conexión inalámbrica?

1393
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,439
Los disparos fueron el mayor problema.

1394
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,405
No podemos usar armas así como así.

1395
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,201
Cada bala tiene que ser contabilizada.

1396
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,244
Ah, vale.

1397
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,206
Sin quejarse

1398
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,008
but our department has such privileges.

1399
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,682
One may be suspended at any time,

1400
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,087
And you can be unemployed in the next six months!

1401
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,577
We can do a tour then!

1402
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,623
It should be suspended for a tour? Hey?

Shaji Sir, are you not choosing?

All of you are selecting wedding dresses for Sl sir, right?

1446
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,286
Sir, there's a missing woman.

1447

Send it in.

Friend.

One week.

1457
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,804
Why you not give a complaint for a week then?

1458
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,541
I waited a day, two days ...

1459
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,412
I thought she would.

1460
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:03,916
You know where she is?

1461

I do not saw how a friend from within!

1468

I can not sleep ...

1471
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,212
Every day, when I returned after work, I buy something.

1472
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,715
And she's not there now,

1473
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:36,013

I have no problem sir.

1477
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,549
Is there a number where I can reach her?

¿Qué pasa, señor?

1492
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:17,726
He registrado un caso ante la queja de su esposo de que usted está desaparecido.

1493
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:20,729
Then you have to come to the station. Or I'll have to send the police.

1494
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,959
No. Do not send the police here, sir.

1495
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:24,931
I will go to the station. - When can you come?

1496
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,631
Monday ... Monday, sir. - What time?

1497

This gentleman right.

1499
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:32,406
Okay.

1500
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,065
She said come on Monday at 10 am

1501
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,572
We talk to her once she comes.

1502
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,704
I have to hear what she has to say as well.

1503
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,412
I bring my daughter, sir?

1504
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,414
worry not find a solution.

1505
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:44,885
This gentleman right.

1506
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:04,372
Lord, not wearing a seat belt.

1507
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,964
I was approaching.

1508
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,100
So can you not use a seat belt if you are near?

1509
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:10,970
Stop. Park it here.

1510
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,414
Dar Rs.100.

1511
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:18,452
Lord, money ...

1512
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,522
Lord, went to tea. - I'll send you to court then.

1513
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,990
No sir. I give you the money. - Rs.100.

1514
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,562
Lord has no problem when ministers take bribes million.

1515
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,928
Despite paying the tax, the road is full of channels.

1516
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,626
All that is not a problem for you, but we do not carry helmets, right?

1517
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,635
We ask you to wear helmets because the road is full of channels.

1518
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,728
Take this boy away from here ...

1519
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,143
Stop! Stop!

1520
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,411
Park it here.

1521
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,445
What is this? Without helmet?

1522
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,787
Go with the Lord.

1523
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:53,954
Please sir.

1524
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,984
Where's your helmet? - I did not take it, sir.

1525
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:01,851
Say your name

1526
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,497
I was

1527
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,598
¿Eh?

1528
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,666
I was.

1529
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,867
Where's your license? - I did not take it, sir.

1530
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,769
Oh! Without helmet and unlicensed!

1531
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:14,843
Ah Pay 500 rupees.

1532
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,141
Police did not know he was here. My house is right here.

1533
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,703
If you do not trust me, come to my house. You'd show you!

1534
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,115
100 then pays.

1535
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,646
I have 100. I'll give you 50.

1536
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,653
Sheesh!

1537
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:28,148
Take him away from here!

1538
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,679
Sheesh!

1539
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,089
His mustache is very cute! Where is your house

1540
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,525
He has no home. You go!

1541
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,389
Sir, Sir Mini is here.

1542
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,990
Where do you come from, mini sir?

1543
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:42,102
I've been missing at the station.

1544
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,003
How's your agriculture?

1545
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,970
The agriculture is better to watch any day!

1546
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,530
Mini sir, that's better.

1547
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,977
Nobody will then suspend.

1548
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,911
It is shown that happiness in your face, Mini Sir.

1549
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:55,045
I just heard that a suspended police have no respect in the city.

1550
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,548
Now I know it's true.

1551
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:58,916
Sir, this problem will be solved if I buy a wireless computer?

1552
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,419
What about the shooting then?

1553
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,217
That petitioner was in ICU for 3 days!

1554
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,856
Nirbhan my dear sir, it is the weapon of the department.

1555
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,794
It will not trigger when necessary.

1556
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:09,854
Anyway, the guy who stole the wireless connection should be happy in a happy place.

1557
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,564
Madhu, buy a bottle of water. Normal temperature.

1558
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:25,670
A bottle of water

1559
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:54,909
(Kisses)

1560
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:04,079
Actually, with your talent, you should be in a bigger position Sunny!

1561
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,119
You know I'm not flattering kind, right?

1562
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:11,759
I want to see even buying a car and going with it.

1563
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,091
I also want to go with you, Sunny!

1564
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:15,854
What if

1565
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,592
I hid the things you gave me that day.

1566
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,892
Can I melt it and make another with a different design?

1567
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,572
See see ..

1568
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,273
When I said that, you stayed silent.

1569
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:27,608
There!

1570
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,676
Sunny?

1571
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:29,932
Do not be angry!

1572
01:27:31,946 --> 01:28:00,435
Finish DRC

1573
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:02,943
Sunny?

1574
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,178
What's that noise there?

1575
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:16,857
Right!

1576
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,144
¿Tú?

1577
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:46,142
¿Estabas parado aquí y hablando por teléfono?

1578
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,378
Simplemente desperdiciando su saldo móvil.

1579
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,718
¿Viniste a darme una sorpresa?

1580
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,385
Usted pequeño diablo!

1581
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,185
Estuvo hablando todo este tiempo, con este señor.

1582
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:08,876
¡Ajá!

1583
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:16,881
Así es como están las cosas ...

1584
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,156
¿Quién es él para ti?

1585
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,384
¿Es tu esposo?

1586
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:24,625
No.

1587
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:26,260
¡Lo sabía!

1588
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,623
Where? Where are the things that tell me?

1589
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:30,720
What, sir?

1590
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,696
Oh. So you did not understand it?

1591
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:36,033
I were on the phone!

1592
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,006
I'm not that kind, sir. - it's okay. I will search.

1593
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,735
Guys, come and look. - Come!

1594
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,042
No sir. I will give it to you.

1595
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:44,878
¡And!

1596
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,161
That is all? Where is the rest?

1597
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,788
That's all I have, sir.

1598
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,708
It's an old broken mobile, sir.

1599
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,886
Hey? You got it?

1600
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,097
From where? - From the colony Vakki, sir.

1601
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,122
Ah okay. Let me call the Commissioner!

1602
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,769
Your bloody cobra and king cobra!

1603
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,176
Now do you understand?

1604
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,274
The kick of a policeman can bring everything down there!

1605
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,712
(Abuse)

1606
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,751
'' All police pay attention,

1607
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,049
both the public and the accused,

1608
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:02,054
Converse only in a parliamentary language decent! ''

1609
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,198
Phew! He was still abusing and cursing!

1610
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,995
Never in my life have I heard such bad words!

1611
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,892
How was Cl Sir?

1612
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:15,993
Manoj Sir stood there stunned!

1613
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:19,898
Mini Sir I called and told him to find the guy.

1614
01:31:20,374 --> 01:31:24,333
Finish DRC

1615
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:25,879
Follow it!

1616
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:30,984
¡Ve quick!

1617
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:32,786
QUICK!

1618
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:58,836
Let him go, sir.

1619
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,040
If he goes and falls somewhere, we have to blame!

1620
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:02,445
How quickly would!

1621
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,017
Jeep tour.

1622
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,426
Control 18 Mobile,

1623
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:17,922
KL 7 BD - 1238.

1624
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,793
A push bike. Give me your RC address.

1625
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:22,069
This gentleman right.

1626
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,206
The number he gave us is not a Pulsar bike, sir.

1627
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,605
It is the number one innovation.

1628
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:28,240
This must be a false number.

1629
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:32,435
He is going after snatching or other similar work.

1630
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,188
Where?

1631
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:42,422
What hospital?

1632
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,550
OK. I will come immediately. This gentleman right.

1633
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,825
Señor .. yo .. - ¿Qué es?

1634
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,429
¿Puedo entrar a esa celda? - ¿Por qué?

1635
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,465
Tengo cosas que arreglar con él, señor. - ¡Cállate, Mini!

1636
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,298
Ya estás en suspensión. ¿Ahora quieres que pierda mi trabajo también?

1637
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:56,165
Enciende el auto. Tenemos que ir al hospital.

1638
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,310
¿Cuando esto pasó?

1639
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,448
Alrededor de las 6 .. 6.30 ..

1640
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,544
Debe ser 6.30.

1641
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,457
¿Notaste que ese hombre hablaba algo?

1642
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,448
En tamil. ¿Hindi o bengalí o algo así?

1643
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,920
He did not speak to me.

1644
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:24,423
He tried to take away the chain

1645
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,660
and when I shouted;

1646
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:28,094
He hit me in the head!

1647
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:30,637
Do not touch there. Hari No, I'm fine.

1648
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,997
No. The pain is much less now.

1649
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,076
How did he look?

1650
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,338
Dark..

1651
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,102
Very high..

1652
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:39,906
What was he wearing?

1653
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:41,480
That was a ... a ...

1654
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:43,139
It was a shirt.

1655
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,884
Gray..

1656
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,484
No ... It was black ...

1657
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,890
in a dark or brownish tone ...

1658
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,650
I can not remember correctly.

1659
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,327
Had not anyone else at home?

1660
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,325
He was outside.

1661
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,467
My son had gone to school.

1662
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,202
Our son is 12.

1663
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:03,898
When you return after school and instruction, it will be around 8-8.30.

1664
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:06,496
Did you hear the sound of a bicycle? How is the running of a bicycle?

1665
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,608
Yes.

1666
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,577
I felt as if someone started a bike and go.

1667
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:24,021
Can you identify the person if you see her?

1668
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:26,193
See if any of these guys.

1669
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:27,160
No.

1670
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:28,422
None of them.

1671
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,628
Control 18 Mobile.

1672
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,095
I heeded the call informed earlier,

1673
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,174
I have a question if it is a case of theft.

1674
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,110
It had been a message before,

1675
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:44,168
on a black pulsar

1676
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:46,213
I doubt it's him.

1677
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,747
Give reports to all stations.

1678
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,540
If there is any information, pass it to 18 or Control. Over!

1679
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:51,718
This gentleman right. Over!

1680
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:53,553
We have to go home.

1681
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,417
And check the scene of the crime.

1682
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:04,699
Come and check the place in the morning,

1683
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,068
and come to steal at night.

1684
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,229
There are many Bengalis in the city, right?

1685
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:30,654
Finish DRC

1686
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,021
He escaped through the kitchen.

1687
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,425
That's what she said.

1688
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:39,256
Lord, they used to come on bicycles and boot chains;

1689
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,761
Now enter the house, they hit his head and then snatching chains.

1690
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:40,189
Tell me already

1691
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:42,530
Sir, I am in the house of the lady who was hit in the head.

1692
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,657
Sir, I doubt if this case is really true.

1693
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:48,235
There are some contradictions between his statement and the scene of the crime.

1694
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,669
There is an order in Trivandrum Sessions Court.

1695
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:52,763
I'm for that. I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

1696
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,536
Investigate it thoroughly. I'll check the rest once you return.

1697
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:15,095
No.

1698
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:19,365
No charges a case.

1699
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:22,369
None..

1700
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:25,296
No one should know this.

1701
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,768
No charges a case.

1702
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:28,909
Please sir.

1703
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,931
When I asked your mother about the incident,

1704
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:04,369
she told me without any eye contact.

1705
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:07,237
He had a slight doubt at that time.

1706
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:11,612
But she gave me details of another accused of very convincingly.

1707
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:14,811
After that, when I checked your house,

1708
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:16,685
I could guess what had happened.

1709
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,287
Although I'm not so sure,

1710
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:21,554
and despite my question thoroughly,

1711
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:23,494
Your mother tried her best to conceal it.

1712
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:26,357
Finally, she clasped her hands in prayer and said:

1713
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:27,966
that no one should know this.

1714
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,697
No one should know that my son did this.

1715
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:32,606
And you?

1716
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,470
You drugged with marijuana and tore the head of your mother.

1717
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:41,337
Si sus años tienen ahora sinceridad,

1718
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:43,640
si amas a tu madre,

1719
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,643
si sientes que lo que hiciste estuvo mal,

1720
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:47,721
¡Dime!

1721
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,822
¿De dónde sacas estas cosas?

1722
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:51,951
¿Quién suministra esto en tu escuela?

1723
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:55,461
¿Dónde? ¿Dónde?

1724
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:57,722
Señor, cuando corta justo después del puente Kochukadavanthra,

1725
01:38:57,831 --> 01:38:59,822
camino a Panampilly Nagar. - ¡Toma a la derecha!

1726
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:01,559
Cual es el auto?

1727
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:04,295
Ese color rojo Swift.

1728
01:39:04,805 --> 01:39:08,707
Temm DrC

1729
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:11,501
It's the police! Take reverse!

1730
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:18,442
What, sir?

1731
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:19,519
What happens?

1732
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:20,878
Do you have 'stuff' here?

1733
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,478
Things? - Yes. .. Clear!

1734
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:24,554
As if you did not understand.

1735
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:27,825
I came because I have information that marijuana wear.

1736
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:29,486
No sir. - Where are the things?

1737
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,722
No sir. We have nothing.

1738
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:35,735
¡Dog!

1739
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:37,237
Sir, are you?

1740
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:38,632
So it's confirmed!

1741
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:42,266
No sir. I came when they said they'd let me to Kadavanthra.

1742
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,411
Just to go by.

1743
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:46,311
Please come out. Let me get the vehicle.

1744
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:47,937
Lord, we are on our way home.

1745
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,812
I'll leave soon. Out! - Please sir!

1746
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:51,551
I left!

1747
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,047
What, sir?

1748
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:54,321
Move on that side.

1749
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:56,286
Lord, we know nothing.

1750
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,893
Sir, there is nothing there.

1751
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:02,929
Someone must have given false, sir information.

1752
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,399
We know nothing - Did you get anything?

1753
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:07,833
We do all this, sir. Only is my grandmother at home, sir.

1754
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:10,403
Sir, we're late. Can we please go home?

1755
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:11,834
We have done nothing sir!

1756
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:13,566
So what were you doing here in the car?

1757
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,266
Lord, we stopped when I got a call.

1758
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:17,503
Sir, there is nothing there. Mister please.

1759
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:20,043
Lord, do not take it there. Please!

1760
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:21,381
Walk!

1761
01:40:21,749 --> 01:40:23,046
What? Move on this side.

1762
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:25,051
Come here.

1763
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:28,081
Sir, did you see this? - Do not do this again, sir.

1764
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:30,552
I made a mistake, sir. - I faint, sir.

1765
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:32,058
Shut!

1766
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:35,061
What is this? Hey?

1767
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,856
Lord, we know nothing!

1768
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,561
Call the official officer.

1769
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,069
Call the tahsildar. I will tell.

1770
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,498
If they know at home, it will be bad, sir. Let us, sir.

1771
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:51,108
Sir, we have nothing to do with this.

1772
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:53,972
If they do at home, it will be a problem, sir.

1773
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:57,640
Special Tahsildar, Revenue Division, Kanayannur.

1774
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:06,427
Lord caught them on the basis of information.

1775
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,054
I found some marijuana in his car.

1776
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:10,096
So I asked your presence while recorded.

1777
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:11,426
Okay, proceed!

1778
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:15,702
A step forward.

1779
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:20,972
What is this?

1780
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:22,876
Make it happen.

1781
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,542
Get him out, I say!

1782
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:25,679
I'll take it, sir.

1783
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,146
- I swear I did not know, sir.

1784
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:56,409
Did you see this?

1785
01:41:56,577 --> 01:42:00,513
I set the sections to keep you in jail for a less 5-6 years.

1786
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:04,640
Here is the chance to convey this happy news to your parents.

1787
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:05,718
Please sir.

1788
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,187
Do not call my house, sir.

1789
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:09,155
We were wandering around Kadavanthra.

1790
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,150
And just given a ride to Binoy, sir.

1791
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:13,689
So you do not know what it does? - No sir.

1792
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,553
What is your name? - Suhail.

1793
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:19,159
What is your name? - Rizwan.

1794
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:22,862
Did you know him before? - No sir.

1795
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,439
Lord, I swear I did not know these kids. They are not part of this.

1796
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,507
You shut up!

1797
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:30,444
He is the one who spoils all these children.

1798
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:32,810
But he is loyal. He will not betray their customers.

1799
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,807
What is your house number?

1800
01:42:34,882 --> 01:42:36,008
Do not call there, sir.

1801
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,515
You'd ordered the number of your home!

1802
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:46,523
Mister please. Do not call my house.

1803
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,863
Hi? Is this the home of Joel?

1804
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:58,438
Move on this side.

1805
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:00,564
And take off your shirt.

1806
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,576
¡Continued camiseta you !!

1807
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,146
Mr! Do not hit me, sir!

1808
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,615
I had said many times before ...

1809
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:11,015
This is a gift for you! - Lord, I made a mistake.

1810
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,947
Kneel down here.

1811
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:17,553
Lord, do not hit me!

1812
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:19,850
Come here! Kneel down!

1813
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,552
Do not stick me sir. - SHUT!

1814
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:23,596
Your..

1815
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:25,732
You want to sell marijuana in schools, right?

1816
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:29,002
Do not stick me with that coconut, sir. Please!

1817
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,170
I'll leave this city, sir. - Kneel down!

1818
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:37,169
Their sales bloody Ganja!

1819
01:43:41,748 --> 01:43:43,238
Lord, I can not go back to work if you do this ...

1820
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,575
What's your job? Ganja sales, right?

1821
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,242
You, give the rest!

1822
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:50,148
Do not stick me sir. Caere standing!

1823
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:53,023
You have a lot of gangs as well, right?

1824
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:56,123
Providing things ...

1825
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:00,160
Skip! I said jump!

1826
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,972
Lord, please tell!

1827
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:15,676
Lord, do not hit me anymore.

1828
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:24,750
I do not never touch again, sir!

1829
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:35,566
Our beatings not affected. - It's a notorious criminal!

1830
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:43,605
There's smoke in all the photos!

1831
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:46,975
Sir, that's not Ganja. These are pictures of us smoking Hookkah.

1832
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:48,114
Hookka!

1833
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:50,840
I can not even see your face by smoke!

1834
01:44:52,986 --> 01:44:53,953
Mr,

1835
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:55,612
The mothers of these children have come.

1836
01:44:55,756 --> 01:44:56,723
Send them in.

1837
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:04,655
This is my mother, sir.

1838
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:06,998
What did you do, sir?

1839
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,135
I found 2 kilos of Ganja in the car he was driving his son.

1840
01:45:11,171 --> 01:45:13,731
I have not done anything mom. I swear!

1841
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:16,976
Mom!

1842
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:18,771
Make him sit there.

1843
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:22,609
Where's your father?

1844
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:24,308
He is in the army, sir.

1845
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,581
The call was not happening.

1846
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:28,354
I have no idea what to do.

1847
01:45:28,422 --> 01:45:29,719
He is on the border.

1848
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,983
I do not know what would happen if he knows it.

1849
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:33,726
Grandmother!

1850
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,787
Your grandmother? - Yes sir.

1851
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,298
Sit down.

1852
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,300
Where they are their parents - They're in the Gulf, sir.

1853
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,695
Grandma, we call here because ...

1854
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,164
What is it?

1855
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:51,173
I received a call from here.

1856
01:45:51,244 --> 01:45:52,711
Rizwan is my son.

1857
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:54,007
He is in the room Sl.

1858
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:56,010
They left under my responsibility.

1859
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:58,243
Stay here and go to school.

1860
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:01,287
But I do not know what you're doing, sir.

1861
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:03,617
I'm afraid, sir.

1862
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:06,983
What is it? What happened?

1863
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:09,884
What happened sir?

1864
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:13,022
We found 2 kilos of Ganja of the car in which her son was traveling.

1865
01:46:14,267 --> 01:46:16,258
It is a case where you can go to jail for 3 years.

1866
01:46:21,308 --> 01:46:23,105
You have nothing to say?

1867
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:24,334
He's not a baby.

1868
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:27,279
Let him go to jail for some time. Just then he'll learn!

1869
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:33,216
Where is your father? - Your father is dead.

1870
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:35,944
What do you do? - I'm a schoolteacher, sir.

1871
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:38,424
Do you know any of these guys?

1872
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:42,162
I know this guy.

1873
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:43,296
What's your name?

1874
01:46:43,296 --> 01:46:44,263
Binoy

1875
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:46,733
When I saw this guy with a couple of times,

1876
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,201
WE had warned that it was not a friend of this guy!

1877
01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:51,963
And once when I asked, I said

1878
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:54,336
Now there is no friendship, and are not and all that.

1879
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:56,466
But I was always scared inside.

1880
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:58,808
Which will be in danger.

1881
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:00,013
Finally,

1882
01:47:00,013 --> 01:47:01,412
that fear came true.

1883
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:06,945
You see if they have any reaction after hearing all this?

1884
01:47:07,154 --> 01:47:09,782
Do not you want to slap him? - Yes sir.

1885
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:12,788
I just control it in front of all of you.

1886
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,967
Get up!

1887
01:47:24,337 --> 01:47:26,506
When I heard that the police caught him,

1888
01:47:26,506 --> 01:47:29,703
My oldest daughter told me she would die crying for him!

1889
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:31,437
But I decided then and there,

1890
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:33,775
who I will not cry for him anymore.

1891
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:35,948
But..

1892
01:47:42,322 --> 01:47:45,025
Yesterday, a mother surprised her son stealing money to buy Ganja;

1893
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:46,925
and he cracked his skull when she questioned him.

1894
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:49,222
it is only in school. Friend.

1895
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:50,931
Children like

1896
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:52,330
get high with these things,

1897
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:54,229
roam the streets at night,

1898
01:47:54,334 --> 01:47:56,165
and violating even their own sisters in the dark.

1899
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:57,828
Have not you heard of the case of Delhi?

1900
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:59,404
The smallest among them,

1901
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,441
who she was raped that girl more brutally.

1902
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:05,477
They were all very happy when they were kids, right?

1903
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:08,515
You wonder if your daughters do not come home at night.

1904
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:10,142
You should ask about these guys too.

1905
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:12,310
Let's where they go, what they are doing, everything!

1906
01:48:12,853 --> 01:48:14,184
If they stuck in this case,

1907
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:16,518
en el futuro no conseguirán trabajo ni podrán irse al extranjero.

1908
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,182
Su futuro estará terminado!

1909
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,788
¡Los dejo por el momento!

1910
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:26,566
De ahora en adelante, si alguna vez te veo frente a mí en cualquier caso;

1911
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:28,056
viste su condición, ¿verdad?

1912
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:29,793
No puede caminar bien.

1913
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:32,361
Te romperé la columna vertebral y te pondré una dosis de glucosa.

1914
01:48:32,472 --> 01:48:34,440
¿Entendiste? ¡Piérdase!

1915
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:36,201
Toma estos móviles también.

1916
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:38,344
¡Aquí!

1917
01:48:51,925 --> 01:48:52,983
Put him in that cell.

1918
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:54,026
Friend!

1919
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:24,220
Finish DRC

1920
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,474
We have information that,

1921
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:43,965
Narcotic substances as Ganja are spreading among school.

1922
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:47,637
If the SPC Cadets receive such information, please let us know.

1923
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:50,449
Pour one.

1924
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:53,452
Police nabbed the son of our Antappan yesterday with some Ganja.

1925
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,487
Who? Jomy?

1926
01:49:54,688 --> 01:49:56,246
He is in the eighth or ninth, right?

1927
01:49:56,356 --> 01:49:57,323
It is 12 °.

1928
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:00,325
Children are now addicted to Ganja and intoxication.

1929
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:04,997
Mix some water, brother!

1930
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:10,096
Not that. Keep coming right.

1931
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,303
Lord, among the last left turn on the road.

1932
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:14,998
There is a bus damaged there.

1933
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,075
Yes!

1934
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:17,938
Stop there, sir. I can see you.

1935
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:24,039
This place has good water frontage.

1936
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:25,641
Oh. Did you come to buy land?

1937
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,318
Madhu Sir, - Shut up!

1938
01:50:27,487 --> 01:50:29,648
Lord, before running count 1 2.3 ..

1939
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:31,220
There are many people there, sir.

1940
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:33,885
Take off your sunglasses, sir. Or fall while pursuing.

1941
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:36,895
If earlier, police smash into pieces.

1942
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:38,430
Now they are all public officers.

1943
01:50:38,498 --> 01:50:40,100
We can bribe and out easily.

1944
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,567
Who has you afraid of the police these days?

1945
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:43,303
We should be strong if the police come.

1946
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:44,964
Why should we be scared?

1947
01:50:45,238 --> 01:50:46,205
Come run!

1948
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:52,478
Stop right there!

1949
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:57,483
¡No saltes!

1950
01:51:01,421 --> 01:51:07,917
Finish DRC

1951
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:11,697
Stop right there!

1952
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:13,960
You can catch as you please, sir.

1953
01:51:14,067 --> 01:51:15,432
Catch others first!

1954
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:20,061
Run faster than PT Usha, right?

1955
01:51:21,408 --> 01:51:24,377
'Running around the world,

01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:26,504

01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:41,154
I did not play cards, sir.

1962
01:51:41,294 --> 01:51:42,761
It was feeding this cow.

1963
01:51:42,996 --> 01:51:44,258
Have you finished feed?

1964
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:45,598
So, let's go. Come!

1965
01:51:45,598 --> 01:51:47,691

Oye,

1967
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:59,076
Is there a store nearby? Where I can get a soda?

Who is this?

1975
01:52:26,306 --> 01:52:28,206
My dear sir, I have no idea!

1976
01:52:28,274 --> 01:52:30,799
He just came here and sat now begging for food.

1978
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:45,152
It suddenly occurred to me this idea, sir.

1979
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:47,525
You are playing with me?

1980
01:52:48,294 --> 01:52:49,629
You'd take good care!

1981
01:52:49,629 --> 01:52:52,598
Lord, there are some lands for sale here. Good price. You want to see?

1982
01:52:52,665 --> 01:52:54,567
Are you doing real estate business with a cop?

1983
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:55,761
You'd give a kick!

1984
01:52:59,706 --> 01:53:00,673
Come in!

01:53:06,513 --> 01:53:09,175

Do not increase the colestrol of Sl adding all those cashews.

1994
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,403

Equally. Sit down.

2011

She was with him?

Yes.

2013
01:54:45,278 --> 01:54:46,245
Move on this side.

2014
01:54:54,821 --> 01:54:56,584
Do you have something to say?

2015
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:01,455
You all go out for some time.

2016
01:55:02,295 --> 01:55:03,592
Let me talk to this woman.

2017
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:15,406
What is the problem between you and your husband?

2018
01:55:16,476 --> 01:55:18,239
Did you hurt after getting drunk?

2019
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,471
He does not drink.

2020

You do not pay it your expenses? - yes.

2021
01:55:21,981 --> 01:55:23,716

Do you have any other problems?

¡No!

2025
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,910
In short, you do not have any problem!

2026
01:55:28,988 --> 01:55:30,683
And there is no fault on his part.

2027
01:55:31,557 --> 01:55:33,459
Even after they are causing all these problems,

2028
01:55:33,459 --> 01:55:35,484
He said he is ready to accept you if you return.

2029
01:55:35,695 --> 01:55:37,629
Live with it ... That will not work, sir.

2030
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,627
I have no mental or emotional connection with him.

2031
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:44,198
I know what happens.

2032
01:55:44,871 --> 01:55:46,839
You are in love with the other guy. it's not like that?

2038
01:56:15,368 --> 01:56:17,529
She says she can not live with you.

2039
01:56:18,071 --> 01:56:20,505
Lord, I have never done anything wrong so far.

2040
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,742
If she says I've done something wrong,

2041
01:56:22,742 --> 01:56:24,539
I'm even ready to correct me, sir.

2042
01:56:24,677 --> 01:56:25,974
That's not the problem.

2043
01:56:26,346 --> 01:56:28,644
She is in love with him. That's the issue.

2044
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,844
If she is happy living with him,

2045
01:56:34,954 --> 01:56:35,921
All right, sir.

2046
01:56:36,689 --> 01:56:38,247
But I want my daughter.

2047
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:40,522
I can not live without it, sir.

2048
01:56:40,893 --> 01:56:42,360
That's not possible, sir.

2049
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:47,066
Sindhu, you can go with him. But I need my son.

2050
01:56:47,867 --> 01:56:49,926
I can go anywhere for my son.

2051
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:52,061
I have nothing to lose!

2052
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:54,400
I can understand your emotion.

2053
01:56:54,574 --> 01:56:56,633
But do not make any challenge in front of me.

2054
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:58,834
I can not find fault with him.

2055
01:56:58,945 --> 01:57:00,378
Then I will tell my decision.

2056
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:02,641
Monday through Friday, let the child be with you.

2057
01:57:02,749 --> 01:57:04,376
Saturday and Sunday, let him.

2058
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:05,517
I agree, sir.

2059
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:07,609
I can not agree, sir!

2060
01:57:07,754 --> 01:57:09,278
How can you say that?

2061
01:57:09,355 --> 01:57:10,686
Is not this a negotiation?

2062
01:57:10,757 --> 01:57:12,418
So you do not have to think from both sides?

2063
01:57:12,525 --> 01:57:13,958
Why are you talking about mercilessly?

2064
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:16,095
Even he would live with his son, right?

2065
01:57:16,095 --> 01:57:17,653
I'm doing a deal now.

2066
01:57:17,764 --> 01:57:19,857
Monday through Friday, the child is with the mother.

2067
01:57:19,932 --> 01:57:21,422
And Saturday-Sunday with his father.

2068
01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:23,525
Write a statement accepting this, sign it and go!

2069
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:26,731
She's not your daughter, sir.

2070
01:57:31,444 --> 01:57:32,809
She is the daughter of Sanal.

2071
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:06,410
She's trying to trick me, sir.

2072
01:58:07,513 --> 01:58:08,537
Not so, Sanal?

2073
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:11,717
But even if she wants to deceive someone,

2074
01:58:11,717 --> 01:58:13,742
Tell him not to tell anyone that stuff!

2075
01:58:15,221 --> 01:58:29,932
Finish DRC

2076
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:40,739

Is she your daughter?

2078
01:58:54,594 --> 01:58:55,561
Yes.

2079
01:58:57,163 --> 01:58:59,757
And knowing that, you gave the child to breed him for 5 years?

2080
01:58:59,866 --> 01:59:00,833
Scoundrel!

2081
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:04,694

2082
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:06,931
There is a saying that a cow jumping the fence,

2083
01:59:07,006 --> 01:59:09,167
He dies an ill death! Keep it in mind!

2084
01:59:10,443 --> 01:59:11,410
Get lost!

2085
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:13,701
Get out of here!

2088
01:59:30,763 --> 01:59:32,697
I invited the air conditioning. Yet meet the Commissioner.

2089
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:34,864
Well then. All the best! - Thank my Lord.

2090

Goodbye.

2091
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:44,235
She is a graduate of fine arts.

2092
01:59:45,111 --> 01:59:46,874
Sir, please come with your family.

2093
01:59:47,713 --> 01:59:49,237
They have begun preparations for the wedding?

2094
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:50,483
Almost, sir.

2095
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:52,075
How many days of holiday you requested?

2096
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:53,516
Lord, about 1 week.

2097
01:59:58,291 --> 01:59:59,724
Lord, is my wedding!

2098
02:00:08,267 --> 02:00:10,064
Who was there in the house?

2099
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:13,571
¿Son and daughter?

2100
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:15,003
When this happened?

2101
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:31,821
I'll check today, sir.

2102
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,735
When did you discover missing gold?

2103
02:00:43,803 --> 02:00:45,338
Actually, we found missing,

2104
02:00:45,338 --> 02:00:47,738
when he is searching for a function.

2105
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:50,101
I do not use much gold usually.

2106
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:52,144
Only during certain functions.

2107
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,610
Are you two here alone?

2108
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:56,048
Now, we're just us two. Previously, there was a maid.

2109
02:00:56,048 --> 02:00:57,783
But she quit her job and left.

2110
02:00:57,783 --> 02:00:59,011
What she said to quitting smoking?

2111
02:00:59,185 --> 02:01:02,321
The last day, she said she had to meet someone in the afternoon.

2112
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:04,084
Is not she would go to Nettoor said?

2113
02:01:04,156 --> 02:01:06,681
Yes. In fact, she said she would go to Nettoor.

2114
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:09,091
But the next day he sent a message to his mobile phone:

2115
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:10,753
her mother had died.

2116
02:01:10,997 --> 02:01:13,124
After that, there was no contact.

2117
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:17,897
Was it after this lady was, you said you saw gold for the last time?

2118
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:19,198
There's a friend of mine. Tijo

2119
02:01:19,305 --> 02:01:21,671
We use the latter for its function.

2120
02:01:21,874 --> 02:01:26,311
And the maid left her job around the 27th - 27 pm.

2121
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:28,610
What room was kept gold?

2122
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:30,146
master bedroom. - yes.

2123
02:01:30,816 --> 02:01:31,840
Come. Let's see.

2124
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:47,695
Who else has access to this room?

2125
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:50,768
Before the maid used to come here. To clean and everything.

2126
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:52,338
But now there is no maid, right?

2127
02:01:52,338 --> 02:01:54,607
And, occasionally, they are cousins.

2128
02:01:54,607 --> 02:01:56,734
But no one would open the closet.

2129
02:01:58,044 --> 02:01:59,841
Give me the number of the maid. - Good.

2130
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:04,750
This was the last message you sent me.

2131
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,615
His mother died.

2132
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:11,957
Mr. Madhu,

2133
02:02:13,426 --> 02:02:15,792
Yes Yes! Keep coming right

2134
02:02:15,928 --> 02:02:17,725
and then turn right from the dead end.

2135
02:02:17,897 --> 02:02:19,125
We'll be there in two minutes.

2136
02:02:28,441 --> 02:02:29,408
Sir, this is the house.

2137
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:43,356
Who are you?

2138
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:44,414
What do you want?

2139
02:02:44,724 --> 02:02:45,748
I Biju Paulose.

2140
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:46,958
Town Sl.

2141
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,228
You know why I came.

2142
02:02:49,228 --> 02:02:50,252
What, sir?

2143
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:51,726
My husband is not here.

2144
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:53,628
I work in the kitchen.

2145
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:56,794
I did not understand why you came here.

2146
02:02:58,437 --> 02:03:01,406
We do not have come to see your husband or your beauty!

2147
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:04,910
You worked as a maid in 7A, Skyline Aparments?

2148
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:06,444
Yes sir. I did it.

2149
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:09,315
Gold worth 15 sovereigns was stolen from there.

2150
02:03:09,315 --> 02:03:10,983
When we investigated, we found that

2151
02:03:10,983 --> 02:03:12,883
you who has taken it.

2152
02:03:12,952 --> 02:03:14,078
I do not ever made!

2153
02:03:14,153 --> 02:03:16,178
Sir, said they are not interested in a case.

2154
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:17,222
Hark that?

2155
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:20,256
They are not ready for a case or other discomfort.

2156
02:03:20,493 --> 02:03:22,859
Why do you say this about us, the poor?

2157
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:25,996
If you do not find the thief, you blame yourself whoever you want.

2158
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:29,459
What is this! That rice was our dinner.

2159
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:33,233
If you behave, me too.

2160
02:03:33,305 --> 02:03:35,933
If you come home when there are no men,

2161
02:03:36,008 --> 02:03:38,238
and say all this, what can we do, sir? - We'll sit there.

2162
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:40,045
Come on that side.

2163
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,847
And and!

2164
02:03:46,786 --> 02:03:49,050
Sit here.

2165
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:52,216
I'll call you back.

2166
02:03:52,825 --> 02:03:55,055
To the questions I'm going to do now,

2167
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:56,924
You should give your sincere answers.

2168
02:03:57,730 --> 02:04:01,029
When was the last time you worked on this particular floor?

2169
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,897
They should be about 2-3 months ago.

2170
02:04:03,035 --> 02:04:05,697
Did you get out a little early on the last day?

2171
02:04:07,173 --> 02:04:08,140
At noon?

2172
02:04:08,207 --> 02:04:09,174
That day I ..

2173
02:04:09,341 --> 02:04:10,808
I do not remember, sir.

2174
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:13,777
Do you remember having said you were going to Nettoor?

2175
02:04:14,814 --> 02:04:15,781
Yes sir.

2176
02:04:16,015 --> 02:04:17,316
He had gone to Nettoor.

2177
02:04:17,316 --> 02:04:18,783
Now you remember, right?

2178
02:04:19,485 --> 02:04:20,786
Why did you go to Nettoor?

2179
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:24,313
I went to Nettoor to see a friend of mine.

2180
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:26,187
And you saw your friend?

2181
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:27,850
She was not there, sir.

2182
02:04:28,027 --> 02:04:29,153
What did you do then?

2183
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:30,830
Then I went home.

2184
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:32,331
He returned home, right?

2185
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:34,322
Did you go somewhere else? - No sir.

2186
02:04:34,433 --> 02:04:35,901
Try and remember once again.

2187
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:37,102
What if you can remember?

2188
02:04:37,102 --> 02:04:38,160
I did not go anywhere, sir.

2189
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:40,932
You did not go to Nettoor that afternoon.

2190
02:04:41,407 --> 02:04:42,772
No sir. I went there!

2191
02:04:42,908 --> 02:04:44,170
What I say is that

2192
02:04:44,243 --> 02:04:46,541
that day, in the afternoon,

2193
02:04:46,812 --> 02:04:48,302
you went to Marine Drive.

2194
02:04:48,581 --> 02:04:50,249
what do you have to say about it?

2195
02:04:50,249 --> 02:04:52,342
No sir. I went to Marine Drive.

2196
02:04:52,518 --> 02:04:54,884
The police have all the evidence and details,

2197
02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:58,890
about where you went, what you did.

2198
02:05:00,893 --> 02:05:02,019
You do not believe it?

2199
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:03,485
You want to see?

2200
02:05:04,096 --> 02:05:06,462
Madhu, get that his horoscope.

2201
02:05:13,372 --> 02:05:14,771
Sir, this is the number.

2202
02:05:19,278 --> 02:05:21,212
Is not this number, lady?

2203
02:05:21,614 --> 02:05:22,581
Yes sir.

2204
02:05:23,082 --> 02:05:25,175
June 27, 2015.

2205
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:26,551
That is to say,

2206
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:29,287
the last day you went to work at the department.

2207
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:31,880
At 2 pm, you were in Panampilly Nagar.

2208
02:05:32,091 --> 02:05:33,991
At 2:30 PM, on Marine Drive.

2209
02:05:34,059 --> 02:05:37,392
This number received two calls from a jewelry store in Marine Drive at night.

2210
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:40,121
Then you were in Nettoor!

2211
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,061
Should be a double role, sir!

2212
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:45,399
What has to say about this, ma'am?

2213
02:05:45,538 --> 02:05:47,506
I have not taken gold, sir.

2214
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,207
Your!

2215
02:05:49,642 --> 02:05:50,609
Who are you?

2216
02:05:52,978 --> 02:05:54,536
What is hapening here? - We are the police!

2217
02:05:54,613 --> 02:05:55,648
Who are you?

2218
02:05:55,648 --> 02:05:57,449
This is my house, sir. - What's your name?

2219
02:05:57,449 --> 02:05:59,084
Rajendran - Where do you work?

2220
02:05:59,084 --> 02:06:00,219
I work for daily wages, sir.

2221
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:01,186
Then Rajendran,

2222
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:03,082
We have come here because;

2223
02:06:03,255 --> 02:06:05,450
of the apartment where his wife worked as a maid;

2224
02:06:05,524 --> 02:06:07,424
about 15 gold sovereigns were stolen.

2225
02:06:07,626 --> 02:06:08,923
So what do we do now?

2226
02:06:09,061 --> 02:06:11,029
Does the husband and wife are going to return?

2227
02:06:11,163 --> 02:06:12,562
She worked as a maid?

2228
02:06:12,932 --> 02:06:14,263
Is wrong, sir.

2229
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,492
While alive,

2230
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:16,969
There's no need for that here!

2231
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:18,971
Are the two goofing around with the police?

2232
02:06:18,971 --> 02:06:20,905
True, I worked as a maid.

2233
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:22,303
Hey? When?

2234
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:25,133
When did you work as a maid without my knowledge?

2235
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:27,144
While he is working with 'Kudumbasree'.

2236
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:28,474
So you were deceiving me?

2237
02:06:28,614 --> 02:06:29,911
Who gave you permission?

2238
02:06:29,982 --> 02:06:31,210
Hey? You asked me?

2239
02:06:31,317 --> 02:06:33,945
If you had asked, I would not have allowed.

2240
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:35,878
Do not have allowed it!

2241
02:06:36,188 --> 02:06:38,554
"So I went to work as a maid without your knowledge."

2242
02:06:39,258 --> 02:06:41,055
Why she worked as a maid?

2243
02:06:41,126 --> 02:06:42,093
Steal!

2244
02:06:42,995 --> 02:06:47,989
His wife, stole gold from that department and sold at Marine Drive.

2245
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,630
And from the next day, she said her mother died;

2246
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,267
She also left her job!

2247
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:53,338
His mother?

2248
02:06:54,373 --> 02:06:56,637
It's been about 18 years since the death of his mother.

2249
02:06:56,942 --> 02:06:58,170
¡Dog!

2250
02:06:59,645 --> 02:07:01,909
Lord, my children will return to school now.

2251
02:07:02,247 --> 02:07:03,339
If you see this ...

2252
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:05,483
we will go to the station for questioning!

2253
02:07:06,352 --> 02:07:07,546
Let your children see;

2254
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:10,084
Breaks his mother!

2255
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:12,250
We have told the truth!

2256
02:07:12,992 --> 02:07:15,620
Or I'll take you, your husband and your children!

2257
02:07:16,195 --> 02:07:18,322
And I send your children to juvenile home!

2258
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:19,564
'Answer him !!

2259
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:22,163
Tell if you've stolen.

2260
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:23,493
You stole or not?

2261
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:27,663
Take me before my kids come home, sir.

2262
02:07:27,973 --> 02:07:28,940
I stole it.

2263
02:07:29,408 --> 02:07:30,375
That's!

2264
02:07:30,743 --> 02:07:37,080
Finish DRC

2265
02:07:37,349 --> 02:07:39,078
What did you do with that gold?

2266
02:07:39,351 --> 02:07:41,444
I sold in fashion jewelry in Marine Drive.

2267
02:07:41,754 --> 02:07:42,721
And the money?

2268
02:07:43,055 --> 02:07:45,046
I gave my children to pay school fees.

2269
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:46,521
And I bought some clothes.

2270
02:07:47,259 --> 02:07:49,318
I also bought some household items.

2271
02:07:50,396 --> 02:07:52,728
You did not know where I was bringing all this money?

2272
02:07:52,965 --> 02:07:55,024
He had asked, sir. - I said, sir.

2273
02:07:55,367 --> 02:07:57,198
I said I got a loan from Kudumbasree.

2274
02:07:57,269 --> 02:07:58,429
The thing is,

2275
02:07:58,504 --> 02:08:01,564
I have not gone to work in the last 4-5 months.

2276
02:08:02,274 --> 02:08:03,741
A slab fell on my foot.

2277
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:05,406
And a chest pain along with that.

2278
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:08,236
But still, I do not have to steal to make ends meet, sir.

2279
02:08:09,214 --> 02:08:11,478
I did this house, my own hard work.

2280
02:08:12,117 --> 02:08:14,051
You know? KPC Group?

2281
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:19,080
Sir, Biju Paulose.

2282
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:21,453
We found the accused in that case of theft of gold.

2283
02:08:22,094 --> 02:08:23,254
And the accused has confessed.

2284
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:27,562
I worked for 12 years with that contractor.

2285
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:30,257
As they left, they would close the house;

2286
02:08:30,469 --> 02:08:32,232
and give me the keys.

2287
02:08:32,404 --> 02:08:34,463
He not even is missing a safety pin, sir.

2288
02:08:35,574 --> 02:08:36,700
She confessed, right?

2289
02:08:37,009 --> 02:08:38,340
If she did.

2290
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:39,377
Good!

2291
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:42,505
And we were criticized for that theft case Peranallur servants.

2292
02:08:42,614 --> 02:08:44,605
So this is good news. Make recovery correctly.

2293
02:08:44,683 --> 02:08:46,344
This gentleman right. I'll do it today!

2294
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,480
Subair, begin arrangements for the recovery.

2295
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:03,526
These are my children, sir.

2296
02:09:04,737 --> 02:09:06,432
She is part of the student police and everything.

2297
02:09:10,509 --> 02:09:11,999
What to do now, right?

2298
02:09:32,731 --> 02:09:35,393
When used to take us to the celebrations of the temple,

2299
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:37,628
if we were asked if we wanted anything,

2300
02:09:37,736 --> 02:09:40,671
even if we wanted something, he always would say no, sir.

2301
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:44,471
We understand the difficulties in this house, sir.

2302
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:45,768
Whatever it is,

2303
02:09:46,712 --> 02:09:48,612
my dad has always told me that

2304
02:09:48,714 --> 02:09:50,614
Live honestly and sincerely.

2305
02:09:50,883 --> 02:09:51,850
But..

2306
02:09:52,117 --> 02:09:54,176
If we wonder why mom did,

2307
02:09:55,187 --> 02:09:56,381
We do not know, sir!

2308
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:59,621
We can understand your emotion.

2309
02:09:59,892 --> 02:10:03,293
But just follow the correct legal procedures.

2310
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:08,461
So the picture will appear Mother in all the papers, sir?

2311
02:10:10,536 --> 02:10:11,525
Hi? - Tell me.

2312
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:13,332
Sir, the thing is ...

2313
02:10:13,539 --> 02:10:15,871
The daughter of the lady ...

2314
02:10:16,275 --> 02:10:20,507
Shalini is the captain of the squad SH school.

2315
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,271
Children cry too, sir.

2316
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:24,675
It is a robbery case, right?

2317
02:10:24,783 --> 02:10:26,418
She has also confessed.

2318
02:10:26,418 --> 02:10:28,887
We can not afford to think emotionally ...

2319
02:10:28,887 --> 02:10:30,479
Tomás appropriate action!

2320
02:10:35,894 --> 02:10:37,596
Come. Let's get to recovery.

2321
02:10:37,596 --> 02:11:01,148
Finish DRC

2322
02:11:02,688 --> 02:11:07,648
'A dream that came swinging,

2323
02:11:07,726 --> 02:11:12,595
faded into oblivion ...

2324
02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:17,795
'A dream that came swinging,

2325
02:11:17,936 --> 02:11:22,873
faded into oblivion ...

2326
02:11:23,308 --> 02:11:28,769
'As the rain falls on a river,

2327
02:11:28,914 --> 02:11:33,248
My eyes are filled with tears ...

2328
02:11:33,318 --> 02:11:39,291
'As the heavens stained by dark clouds,

2329
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:43,694
my heart has sunk in the dark ...

2332
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:23,661
She has confessed.

2333
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:25,293
Make a record of his statement.

2334
02:12:25,537 --> 02:12:27,437
Call the claimant. - Yes sir!

2335
02:12:48,727 --> 02:12:49,921
And tell me Freddy!

2336
02:12:50,062 --> 02:12:51,962
Lord, Karate Rajesh has landed here.

2337
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:52,826
Where?

2338
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:54,666
If you're ready, I pass it today!

2339
02:12:54,666 --> 02:12:56,001
He "sketched" location, sir.

2340
02:12:56,001 --> 02:12:59,027
Rastreas your location correctly. I'll be there! 10 minutes!

2341
02:13:09,081 --> 02:13:10,241
Where is the?

2342
02:13:10,315 --> 02:13:12,084
There is a small jungle after this bridge, sir.

2343
02:13:12,084 --> 02:13:14,052
They are there. - Okay, go!

2344
02:13:20,559 --> 02:13:21,685
Stop here, sir.

2345
02:13:22,027 --> 02:13:23,289
It's on the left.

2346
02:13:23,862 --> 02:13:24,863
Where to now?

2347
02:13:24,863 --> 02:13:26,353
This is an island, sir.

2348
02:13:26,465 --> 02:13:27,955
There are two ways to enter.

2349
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:31,726
You come out the other side. I'll go this way.

2350
02:13:37,776 --> 02:13:39,676
Shaji, come with Madhu. - OK sir.

2351
02:13:44,883 --> 02:13:46,646
After this turn, sir.

2352
02:13:46,718 --> 02:13:48,083
They're here, sir.

2353
02:13:50,922 --> 02:13:52,048
Should I go, sir?

2354
02:13:52,124 --> 02:13:54,558
If they know I'm the informant, they'll kill me, sir!

2355
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:57,059
Do not be afraid! Just cover your face with that scarf.

2356
02:13:57,329 --> 02:13:59,991
I came here only because I trust you, sir.

2357
02:14:00,565 --> 02:14:04,831
I do not usually fool my kind, sir. It will be a big problem to the end.

2358
02:14:04,903 --> 02:14:06,632
That is what is happening now.

2359
02:14:06,705 --> 02:14:09,674
If I give information about someone, tomorrow the police themselves say they

2360
02:14:09,674 --> 02:14:11,642
I was the one who betrayed them.

2361
02:14:11,843 --> 02:14:14,107
That's why none of the thugs are now becoming informants.

2362
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:18,150
Just because you're a good officer, without corruption,

2363
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,118
WE have given information, sir!

2364
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:23,549
So I trust you will not betray too!

2365
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:30,558
There. That's your bike, sir.

2366
02:14:30,962 --> 02:14:33,487
They must be here somewhere, sir.

2367
02:14:34,466 --> 02:14:35,694
This is your bike.

2368
02:14:44,676 --> 02:14:45,973
There they are, sir!

2369
02:14:46,678 --> 02:14:47,645
See..

2370
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:52,046
I go, sir.

2371
02:14:52,117 --> 02:14:53,516
Okay, you can go.

2372
02:15:03,495 --> 02:15:04,689
It is the police. Come on let's go!

2373
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:06,388
What, sir?

2374
02:15:06,498 --> 02:15:07,732
I'll tell you all about it later.

2375
02:15:07,732 --> 02:15:09,461
Do not mess with us. - Move on!

2376
02:15:09,968 --> 02:15:12,170
Come with me. Do not play!

2377
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:13,137
Walk!

2378
02:15:13,672 --> 02:15:14,639
Get lost you!

2379
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:16,436
What are you doing sir? - you come!

2380
02:15:16,508 --> 02:15:17,776
We'll talk at the station!

2381
02:15:17,776 --> 02:15:19,676
Do not create a scene, sir.

2382
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:21,680
Do not mess with me!

2383
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:24,015
Come to the station first! - You will have trouble, sir!

2384
02:15:24,015 --> 02:15:24,982
¡No!

2385
02:15:27,886 --> 02:15:29,148
Madhu, where are you?

2386
02:15:30,122 --> 02:15:31,089
I have it!

2387
02:15:31,189 --> 02:15:33,749
No, there is not. Spin left and see! Where are you?

2388
02:15:33,959 --> 02:15:35,688
Antappan, corre !!

2389
02:15:40,899 --> 02:15:41,866
Stop!

2390
02:15:57,249 --> 02:15:58,216
Stop!

2391
02:15:59,618 --> 02:16:22,896
Finish DRC

2392
02:16:48,567 --> 02:16:49,534
Let me!

2393
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:04,248
You should not be careful, sir?

2394
02:17:06,017 --> 02:17:08,918
Sunimón, hits the pulp of this man!

2395
02:17:11,856 --> 02:17:13,517
Did you think I was alone?

2396
02:17:13,592 --> 02:17:16,083
You thought you could fuck me?

2397
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:18,527
You want to play with me in my area?

2398
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:21,255
¡Shameer, Suni, lo mataremos!

2399
02:17:21,633 --> 02:17:23,828
Shameer, dig a grave for this pig!

2400
02:17:52,897 --> 02:17:56,094
Did not I say I'd be in trouble, sir?

2401
02:18:12,851 --> 02:18:13,818
DO NOT you move!

2402
02:18:14,185 --> 02:18:15,152
Sit there!

2403
02:18:17,722 --> 02:18:18,689
Sit there!

2404
02:18:19,591 --> 02:18:20,615
You'd end up!

2405
02:18:21,826 --> 02:18:23,623
How many are in your gang?

2406
02:18:23,895 --> 02:18:24,862
Ten?

2407
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:26,590
Or hundreds?

2408
02:18:26,998 --> 02:18:29,091
There are 50,000 policemen here!

2409
02:18:29,834 --> 02:18:32,997
You're walking freely despite having 30 cases with you!

2410
02:18:33,738 --> 02:18:36,605
With the support of politicians and human rights!

2411
02:18:37,342 --> 02:18:39,037
What work "date" was going on here?

2412
02:18:39,878 --> 02:18:41,345
I am also here at work "date"!

2413
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:46,985
After breaking into homes, stealing, raping and killing politicians,

2414
02:18:46,985 --> 02:18:48,748
when you hide in jungles how are you;

2415
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:52,347
Every police take another "appointment" to finish with you!

02:18:52,924 --> 02:18:54,789
Ready to die even doing their job!

2417
02:18:56,761 --> 02:18:59,696
Do not persecuted because you stole my house!

2418
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:01,858
It's because this is my job!

2419
02:19:02,233 --> 02:19:04,292
I take this job because I always wanted!

2420
02:19:05,236 --> 02:19:06,601
Always wanted...

2421
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:08,798
So sons of bitches,

2422
02:19:09,441 --> 02:19:11,102
until the end of my last breath

2423
02:19:11,776 --> 02:19:13,334
I'll be behind you all!

2424
02:19:14,379 --> 02:19:15,744
Move on this side, you!

2425
02:19:15,814 --> 02:19:16,781
¡¡Gatear !!

2426
02:19:17,282 --> 02:19:18,249
¡Gatear!

2427
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:20,381
Do not move !!

2428

Finish DRC

2429
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:46,478
You got scared?

2430
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:47,445
Yes.

2431
02:19:49,314 --> 02:19:51,441
There are so small risks in our work.

2432
02:19:52,484 --> 02:19:54,179
Wedding is just 5 days.

2433
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,711
Think if you want to risk marrying a cop!

2434
02:19:59,357 --> 02:20:00,324
I'm sorry!

2435
02:20:00,892 --> 02:20:03,087
The doctor has asked you not to try.

2436
02:20:03,495 --> 02:20:05,087
Do not think about anything else right now.

2437
02:20:07,432 --> 02:20:09,229
This is the nature of our work ...

2438
02:20:09,901 --> 02:20:13,428
You can not say when, where and who we'd be back running ...

2439
02:20:14,839 --> 02:20:19,299
Sometimes when you want to share your presence my little joys and sorrows,

2440
02:20:20,779 --> 02:20:22,178
Where is Biju, Mom?

2441
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:23,680
You put not tense.

2442
02:20:23,815 --> 02:20:25,373
Your mom is with you!

2443
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:28,111
Your phone is ringing. But he does not answer!

2444
02:20:28,186 --> 02:20:30,950
Paulose is calling. He will be here!

2445
02:20:31,156 --> 02:20:33,852
It is because the date was early, right?

2446
02:20:34,826 --> 02:20:38,125
I should have taken a week off during this time!

2447
02:20:38,830 --> 02:20:40,161
He will come now!

2448
02:20:40,231 --> 02:20:42,927
He's on his way now. He is driving!

2449
02:20:43,001 --> 02:20:44,229
He'll be right here!

2450
02:20:45,003 --> 02:20:46,971
I'm trying. I'm not going to happen!

2451
02:21:51,135 --> 02:22:06,142
Finish DRC

2452
02:22:11,589 --> 02:22:14,490
This young man named Biju Paulose,

2453
02:22:14,592 --> 02:22:16,389
Not a superhuman.

2454
02:22:16,594 --> 02:22:19,392
No wings to fly high.

2455
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:24,034
He's just one of ordinary policemen around us.

2456
02:22:24,969 --> 02:22:30,908
And this is not the last time you chase or fight against lawbreakers.

2457
02:22:31,142 --> 02:22:33,440
He is part of a legacy.

2458
02:23:11,015 --> 02:23:12,448
- How long you've been calling?

2459
02:23:12,617 --> 02:23:14,175
Where the hell are you?

2460
02:23:14,485 --> 02:23:16,009
What kind of job is this?

2461
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:19,553
Then yes! Kunjumol has given birth to a girl!

2462
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:19,553
Then yes! Kunjumol has given birth to a girl!
