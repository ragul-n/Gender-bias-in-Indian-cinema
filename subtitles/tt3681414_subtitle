84
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,208

Everything was Going according to plan.

00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,958
..Suzy's sister Pinky saw everything.

94
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,041
Suzy lost his mind in a frenzy.

95
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,166
And in a effort to console him..

96
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,083

Because as usual, You didn't ask for anything.

196
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,916
Idiot, I called you back, that's all.

197
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,791
Hey...are these Nike. - That's NIKE.

198
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:18,791
What? - Yes.

199
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,000
By the way, guys.

200
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,833
This year there's something special for all of us.

201
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,750
Cowboy hats.

202
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,708
Give me one too.

203
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:28,791
Me, me, me.

204
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,791
Sam, you completed my look.

205
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,125
Take it.

206
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,750
Suzy, is it looking nice?

207
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,791
These are called Cowboy Hats.

208
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,041
It's time to renew the vows, guys.

209
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,083
Come on, guys.

210
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,333
Before pop...comes poetry.

211
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,666
Before the world...comes friendship.

212
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:45,708
Always marry a virgin.

213
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,750
Never touch another cowboy girl.

214
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,041
Always keep a secret...never spill the beans.

215
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,041
Always together since our teens.

216
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,250
Always wear 'Purani Jeans' (Old Jeans).

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,083
Friends Forever!

218
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,666
And to complete it... the Holy Dip.

219
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,666
To the king of Kasauli.

220
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,333
Come on.

221
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,333
Hail God! Glory to Him!

222
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,791
Hail Goddess!

223
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,708
Friends Forever!

224
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:36,666
Are you mad?

225
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,708
At least your jeans got a wash.

226
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,958
It smells so much.

227
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
Are they in mourning?

228
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,083
I just changed two weeks ago.

229
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,791
That makes it completely dead.

230
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,083
Don't laugh, you coward.

231
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,083
It was just water.

232
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,000
But you were scared Like we threw you in acid.

233
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,291
I am not scared.

234
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,625
I belong to the 'Katoch' lineage..

235
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:58,708
..on my mother's side.

236
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,875
Hey, coward, there's Shakaal.

237
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,666
You're in trouble.

238
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,666
Big joke!

239
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,791
Oh no! Run, Sid, run.

240
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,541
Shakaal's coming.

241
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,291
Stupid. - Hello, uncle.

242
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,708
I'll deal with you later.

243
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:19,708
Save me.

244
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,125
Useless. - Sorry, papa.

245
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,708
How dare you take my Maruti?

246
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:25,958
It was a mistake.

247
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,375
I only drove it 20 times since 1989.

248
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,791
I was going to call the police..

249
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,333
..if Pinky hadn't told me.

250
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,583
Sorry, papa.

251
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,500
Useless. - Sorry, papa.

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,708
Where did he go?

253
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,708
Useless. Stop.

254
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,708
Shakaal and Suzy?

255
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,458
So this cat and Mouse game is still on.

256
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,875
You know... he failed this year too.

257
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,708
Hey...keep your guitar.

258
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:09,708
What?

259
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,708
No respect.

260
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,750
And anyway, Suzy cleared The 10th board in two attempts.

261
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,125
So big deal.

262
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,541
Not two, it was three.

263
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,166
You were in London, you don't know. - What?

264
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,208
I doubt Shakaal's dreams..

265
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,666
..of making him a Doctor will ever come true.

266
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,125
Jesus, these guys.

267
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,083
By the way, what about Your dreams of going to MIT?

268
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,750
The engineering results were good.

269
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,083
Just waiting for the scholarship. - Alright.

270
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,708
Until then I am Giving computer tuitions..

271
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,000
..and lending mother A hand in her side-business.

272
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,750
Business?

273
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,791
She ran a nursery school.

274
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,541
What this now?

275
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,625
Mom's started a New side-business of flowers.

276
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,250
Extra-income to send me to the US.

277
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,125
M...man.

278
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,875
You know what..

279
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,666
It's M's dream to send you to US, not yours.

280
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:00,625
I know.

281
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,250
So how's the girlfriend?

282
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,791
Fighting fit, how else?

283
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,041
Come on.

284
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,166
Are you sure?

285
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,750
Won't you go to your home first?

286
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,833
This is my home, boy.

287
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,000
Hold on to my guitar.

288
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,000
Asta-la-vista, baby.

289
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,583
Boo.

290
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,166
Sam!

291
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,791
Is this the way?

292
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,000
Why?

293
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,666
Even Romeo came through the window..

294
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,250
..to meet his Juliet.

295
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,166
No one ever stopped him.

296
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,750
I missed you so Much my Monica darling.

297
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,666

Son...get out.

Can't you see... We adults are a bit busy?

302
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,666
Look at your son.

303
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:59,125
You're the son... I am her boyfriend.

304
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,833
I am really famished, Can I get something please?

305
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,458
If you flirt so hard, you'll get something special.

306
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
Close your eyes. - Okay, okay.

307
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,791
Close it, no cheating.

308
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:08,791
No cheating. No cheating.

309
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,500
Open your mouth.

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
Yummy? - Chocolate cake?

311
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:15,583
Your favorite.

312
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,791

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,625
Our 'Hawa Mahal' (Palace in Air).

316
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,791
I miss it.

317
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,791
So...why did you come last year?

318
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,625
You're coming after two years, you idiot.

319
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,750
Romance in Rome, Siddharth boy.

320
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,708
Didn't I write to you that..

321
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
..I went to Rome with an Opera singer?

322
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,708
Yes...with..

323
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,583
Some Isabella, right? - Yes.

324
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:56,833
Okay.

325
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,125
I could never make out whether she sang or screamed.

326
00:18:59,625 --> 00:18:59,916
You're crazy.

327
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,583
She made be bleed from my ears.

328
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,666
What happened finally? - What else?

329
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,916
With the summer, the romance passed too.

330
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,791
Idiot.

331
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,083
You're a big idiot.

332
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,750
First decide whether I am a idiot or a fool.

333
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,583
Fine.

334
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,958
Idiot fool, so tell me.

335
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,541
What's the scene with the guitar?

336
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,708
It's all about the guitar, silly boy. - I see.

337
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,500
You know what...I am thinking..

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,541
..of making a rock album this year.

339
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,458
Rock album.

340
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,916
You write the songs, I'll compose them.

341
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,458
It's going to be fun.

342
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,958
Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,458
I'll write the songs?

344
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,125
Sam, I can write my engineering exam paper.

345
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,250
Songs..

346
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,250
What?

347
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,875
Mr. Siddharth Ray.

348
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,500
You don't know, but there's an amazing artist..

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,875
..hidden inside you.

350
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,583
Sam knew everything about me.

351
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,833
My dreams to become a writer.

352
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,541
My helplessness for studying engineering.

353
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,541
After all, we were best friends since we were five.

354
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Finally.. Home Sweet Home!

355
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,208
What have you been singing all the way?

356
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,291
It's a Vintage Album of The Doors.

357
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,250
Doors!

358
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,583
That reminds me I've got something for you in here.

359
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,750
Here you go. - Thanks, buddy.

360
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,666
Doors. - Yup.

361
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,625
And who's that on the cover?

362
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,375
Come on, Sid.

363
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,958
I am from the local government school.

364
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
Not Sanavar and Cambridge like you.

365
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,500
Idiot, this is Jim Morrison.

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,958
Lizard king God of Rock.

367
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,625
Writing songs, composing..

368
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,125
This guy was sheer genius. - I see.

369
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,833
And you know what?

370
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,666
He was a poet...just like you.

371
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,333
Bahadur.

372
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,166
I guess everyone forgot you're coming back today.

373
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,208
No, no, no, relax boy.

374
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,666
I did call mama.

375
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,166
And she must be waiting for me like always.

376
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,416
And who knows... there might just be..

377
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
..a surprise party inside.

378
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,375
Bahadur.

379
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,958
Sam sir. - Hi, Bahadur.

380
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,791
Good morning, Sam sir.

381
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,458
I mean goodnight..

382
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,458
No one's at home?

383
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,333
Sir's on a business trip to Delhi.

384
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,583
And madam's at the club. - Club?

385
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,208
Yes, Sam sir.

386
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,875
Okay, take my luggage inside. - Okay.

387
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,916
And Sid, you leave too.

388
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,625
But you did call aunt, didn't you?

389
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,541
Mama's a busy person.

390
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:50,958
And maybe I gave her the wrong date.

391
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,666
You know how I am. - Okay.

392
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:54,958
Now go.

393
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,416
Goodnight. - Bye.

394
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,375
Sam had everything.

395
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,041
After all, he was royalty.

396
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,791
Aunt was the princess of Himachal..

397
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,083
..and uncle was Shimla's Viceroy's grandson.

398
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,166
But although he had everything..

399
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,708
..there was one thing lacking in his life.

400
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,875
And that was a 'Dad'.

401
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,750
When he was a kid, his dad..

402
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,333
..left his family and eloped with a foreigner.

403
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,333
And this affected aunt the most.

404
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,666
Bahadur.

405
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,666
Who is there?

406
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,333
Mama, it's me. - Sam.

407
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:51,583
Sam. You've come back.

408
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,583
I am so happy.

409
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,250
So happy.

410
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,458
When did you return?

411
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,833
I called to inform that I am coming on the 18th..

412
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:02,791
..but maybe you forgot.

413
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,041
Oh yes, I am sorry I forgot.

414
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,875
I am so sorry.

415
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,166
Oops.

416
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,625
So sorry.

417
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,083
Let's go inside. - Yes.

418
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,375
How are you? - I am okay.

419
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,916
It's been so long.

420
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,000
How's London? - London's great.

421
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,041
You know I got straight A's in all my subjects.

422
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,708
I topped my class too.

423
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,875
Oh...I made it to the rowing team as well.

424
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,125
And I am the secretary..

425
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,541
..of the Shakespeare Society in College.

426
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,708
You know.. - Did dad come to see you?

427
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,666
Yes.

428
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,083
Like every year, at the end of my semester..

429
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:50,083
..with that...Catherine.

430
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:57,916
You know they have a child now, right?

431
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,916
Anyway.

432
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,208
You know, this year..

433
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,708
..I took extra piano and guitar lessons.

434
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,958
I was thinking I will have our own band.

435
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,458
Rock album with a proper band name and everything.

436
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,708
I was thinking of calling it Rock Raga.

437
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,291
What do you think?

438
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,541
Mama! - Yes.

439
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,541
Yeah!

440
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,125
This is for super boys.

441
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,916
Super cool, Bobby.

442
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,291
This is for M R Mathur.

443
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,666
And this one's for Sharmila..

444
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,291
..who never gives and never will.

445
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,916
Bloody..

446
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:47,041
And this for the principal from me and Sam.

447
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:52,375
Ladies specialist.

448
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,208
Throw it, Suzy.

449
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,666
He saw you.

450
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,875
Sushil Sharma, I won't let you get away with this.

451
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,666
Save me. I am dead.

452
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,833
Sam, my friend, each time you're here..

453
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,916
..Kasauli turns lush.

454
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,750
All comes for a price, my man.

455
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,625
I see. How much?

456
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:09,916
Hey, showoff. Let it.

457
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,875
Take your hands out of your pocket.

458
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:12,708
Here you go, Sam.

459
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,375
They are fresh. - Now you're talking.

460
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,541
I am going to beat him up. - Why?

461
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:17,750
Did you ever pay for anything?

462
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,208
Freeloader.

463
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,875
I am not a confectioner like you.

464
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,458
You're talking to Patiala royalty, get that?

465
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,583
What royalty?

466
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:27,708
Up my back?

467
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,916
You'll know once I give you a black-eye.

468
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,250
Your father's a PWD Contractor.

469
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,625
Sam here...is real royalty.

470
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,833
His ancestors ruled Shimla for ages.

471
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,958
T man, as usual the fritters..

472
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,208
..from your Punjab Sweets are world class.

473
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,625
Legend. - Legend. - Cheers!

474
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,500
Siddhu, you can write down my dream.

475
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,041
You won't forget.

476
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:49,166
Someday I want the world to taste my fritters.

477
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,625
It suits you perfectly.

478
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,083
Serving fritters as a waiter.

479
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,708
Return the fritters. - Get lost.

480
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,125
Guys, guys, guys.

481
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,583
I just thought of a nice tune. Wait.

482
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:57,625
What tune?

483
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:58,583
Glory to Goddess?

484
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,291
"Glory to Goddess!"

485
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,875
"Ha-ha-ha" shut up.

486
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,208
Very funny.

487
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,416
When I launch my rock album..

488
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,666
..none of you will be invited.

489
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,541
Only Sid will be invited.

490
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:09,708
Why?

491
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:10,625
What do you want from me?

492
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,541
The 'Yaari poem' (Friendship poem).

493
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,375
Sam, that's just boring poetry.

494
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:16,000
It's useless to you.

495
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,375
Guys..

496
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:21,375
And God said...let there be music.

497
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:30,458
"It's a bit sweet...a little salty."

498
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:36,083
"Friendship. Friendship."

499
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:41,083
"A friend's someone who knows you too well."

500
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,083
"Friendship. Friendship."

501
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:56,083
"Life's made of lively friends."

502
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:03,791
"You and me."

503
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,291
"Me and you..."

504
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,291
"Our friendship."

505
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:16,708
"I'll break all my piggybanks."

506
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:22,166
"Count all my coins."

507
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:27,375
"And buy your share of smile."

508
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:32,791
"And you find my smile too."

509
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,958
"Sweeter than tea."

510
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,208
"You know.."

511
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:41,208
"Friendship. Friendship."

512
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,041
"Life's made of lively friends."

513
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,041
"You and me."

514
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,458
"Me and you.."

515
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:05,458
"Our friendship."

516
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:17,958
"Sway under the influence of beer."

517
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:23,458
"Reach new milestones on the road to fun."

518
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:28,583
"If the mind asks for a way back home."

519
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:34,125
"We'll say we were raised in revelry."

520
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,458
"Bunking class and continuing on mountain tops."

521
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,791
"What?"

522
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,791
"Friendship. Friendship."

523
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,375
"Life's made of lively friends."

524
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,708
"You and me."

525
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,958
"Me and you.."

526
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,958
"Our friendship."

527
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,125
Friends forever!

528
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,291
Hello. - Hello, sir.

529
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,041
Bunty Desai. - Yes.

530
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,583
I was really sad to hear about your mother.

531
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,333
Another thing.

532
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,916
Like she said, we need to sell the cottage after her death.

533
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:36,750
Yes.

534
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,708
I've a party, absolutely willing.

535
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,750
You can do whatever you like.

536
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,416
As you know, I don't want to go back to India ever again.

537
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,416
Yes. Bye.

538
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,125
India. After so many years.

539
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,083
Things must have changed drastically.

540
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:04,083
I wonder where everyone is.

541
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:12,458
That summer after Sam arrived..

542
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,625
..time was changing rapidly.

543
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,416
And the most beautiful moment of that time was..

544
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,416
Naintara.

545
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,625
"Love me.."

546
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:25,958
Hi, Elvis. - Hi.

547
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,041
Mother has sent flowers. - Keep it there.

548
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,583
Do me a favor.

549
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,250
Look after the shop for a while.

550
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,166
I'll go fetch Amy.

551
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,166
And dust the place too while you're here.

552
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,166
The movie's called Blackmail.

553
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,333
Best song; song no.3, side B.

554
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,583
'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas'!

555
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,583
It's one of my favorite songs.

556
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,458
It's you, from the station right?

557
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,916
Hi, Siddi. - Siddi?

558
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,458
Your name? - No.

559
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:29,791
Siddi...Siddhu..

560
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,625
Short for Siddharth actually.

561
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,083
Naintara, short for Naintara.

562
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,458
Oh, hi.

563
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:40,875
Nice shop. - Thanks.

564
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,083
Is this your book?

565
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,916
You study architecture?

566
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,875
I just gave the entrance exam for architecture, so..

567
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,125
Let's see..

568
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,541
By the way, how much for this record?

569
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,208
I don't work here.

570
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,375
Oh, I am sorry.

571
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,125
But if you want to hear this record..

572
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,000
..I think I can help you.

573
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,000
Come. - Yeah, sure.

574
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,583
Nice.

575
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,000
One second.

576
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,541
Sorry.

577
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,875
Old songs have a different charm, don't they? - Yes.

578
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,541
There's no such place in Mumbai.

579
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:22,916
So you're from Mumbai. - Yes.

580
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,791
This..

581
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:31,541
Headphones. - Thanks.

582
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,125
You know...my dad used to sing this song..

583
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,416
..for my mom. - Used to?

584
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,125
Not anymore?

585
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,458
He was in the army.

586
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,166
Died on duty. - Oh, I am sorry.

587
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:49,291
It's okay. It was a long time ago.

588
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,458
Mother and I live in Kasauli now.

589
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,166
It's a nice cantonment.

590
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:54,416
You will like it.

591
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:58,208
Sorry. Hear it.

592
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:02,208
Can you hear it?

593
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:08,541
'That evening I was trying to erect a bond with a stranger..'

594
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,500
'..and Sam was trying to strengthen a strange bond.'

595
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,500
Many hearts are going to broken tonight.

596
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:20,833
Where are you going?

597
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,208
I am taking everyone to the Kasauli Club.

598
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:27,208
Club night.

599
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:34,833
I love this song. - I like it too.

600
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,666
It's a beautiful number. - I know.

601
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,666
A dance with the most beautiful woman in the world.

602
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:58,375
You remind me of someone.

603
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:08,875
Mama.

604
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:12,250
Why can't it always be like this?

605
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,208
Just you and me?

606
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:22,500
Sometimes I think... marrying again was..

607
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,916
Sam sir.

608
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,291
Excuse me, Sam sir.

609
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:28,958
Sam sir, your friends are here.

610
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,208
Fine, I'll be there. - Okay.

611
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,708
Sam.

612
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:40,291
We're waiting for you. - Okay, now you go and have a great night.

613
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,916
Welcome to the club night, Cowboys.

614
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,916
Cheers.

615
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,000
Thanks for the drinks, Sam. - No problem.

616
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,208
Always booze for hose.

617
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,416
Hose? Who's that?

618
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:58,416
Your sisters. Did your father tell you?

619
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,583
Holy Mother of God.

620
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,708
Who's that?

621
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,208
The new Collector in town, Sapru uncle.

622
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,416
She's his daughter.

623
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,875
She's a Kashmiri. She studies in Mumbai.

624
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:16,583
Jesus. Praise the Lord.

625
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:17,708
Excuse me.

626
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,500
If you're done with your prayer meeting..

627
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,958
..can I pass?

628
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,791
But before that I'll have to..

629
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:25,833
..baptize you, my lovely.

630
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,291
What is that?

631
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,416
Welcome to Kasauli beautiful nun.

632
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,916
When in need just come to Lawrence Estate.

633
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:34,833
Saint Samuel's doors are always open for you.

634
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,458
Lawrence Estate? - Yup.

635
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,000
Are you Mr. Joseph Lawrence's son?

636
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,666
Samuel Lawrence at your service, madam.

637
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,083
Dad said that I'd meet you.

638
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,458
You know, our dads were best friends..

639
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,125
..since St. Stephen's College.

640
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,833
Really? - Yes.

641
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,958
If that's true then..

642
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,208
..we should continue the tradition. Right?

643
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,208
Hey, sis, where have you been? - Hi, Aisha.

644
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:56,875
I've been looking for you everywhere.

645
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:57,791
Meet Sam.

646
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,916
Or should I say St. Samuel.

647
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,833
Hi, St. Samuel.

648
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,583
Hello, beautiful friends.

649
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,958
Since we've to be friends, meet my missionaries.

650
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,625
Suzy, Tino and Bobby. - Hi.

651
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,416
He's the old uncle of our group.

652
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,458
Sorry. Hi. - Hi, Bobby.

653
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,666
So, do you nuns have names?

654
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,000
Absolutely.

655
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,875
Sister Naintara and sister Aisha.

656
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,875
Already a sister.

657
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,375
Excuse them.

658
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,375
So...a dance beautiful nun?

659
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,625
Yeah, come.

Dance?

661
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:43,208
Okay.

662
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:44,458
This way.

663
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,666
Hi, myself Suzy.. - Dance.

664
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,125
What's your problem?

665
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,750
Come on.

666
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,500
And that Blondie slapped Tino.

667
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,625
It was solid, you should've been there.

668
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,125
You know I never attend it.

669
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,125
See you. - Bye.

670
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:08,750
Who's back?

671
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,000
Sir's just returned by the morning flight.

672
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,208
Oh.

673
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,875
Where's mama? - She's inside.

674
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,583
Okay.

675
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,000
Sam.

676
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,250
Good you're back early.

677
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,166
I was just telling Abhijeet that..

678
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:29,000
..we'll have lunch together.

679
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,916
Full family together.

680
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,666
Family?

681
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,166
He's not family. - Sam..

682
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,250
He's just our estate manager.

683
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,250
And your second husband.

684
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,125
See you at lunch.

685
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,083
Bahadur, where's my gold set? - Coming, sir.

686
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:54,125
Sam...back after a long time.

687
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,125
Sherry, is lunch ready?

688
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:01,875
So...how are things?

689
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,541
With you around...just got better.

690
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,208
Bahadur!

691
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,208
Good you're here boy.

692
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,458
After two years.

693
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,041
You've become taller.

694
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:19,208
How tall are you now?

695
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,458
Son, I was thinking that..

696
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,541
..you should go to Harvard Business School next year.

697
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,750
You can do a specialized MBA program.

698
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,375
Wearing my dad's suit and sitting on his chair..

699
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:36,208
..don't try to become my dad, okay.

700
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't want to do any MBA.

701
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,083
I am going to be a musician, I'll be clear on that.

702
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,833
Yes, of course.

703
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,000
New musician in the family.

704
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,583
Cheers.

705
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:46,583
Bahadur. - Yes, sir.

706
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,375
Refill madam's glass quickly.

707
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:54,041
By the way, are you here on the 6th? - Yes.

708
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:58,750
No, that week we're in Delhi.

709
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,916
Sherry, we've the inauguration..

710
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:02,125
..of our new juice factory on the 6th.

711
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,958
Minister Dave is coming too. You know..

712
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,958
Sir, 6th is...Sam sir's birthday.

713
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:21,791
What gift do you want? - You!

714
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:22,875
I was only joking.

715
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,750
A jeep would be okay.

716
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,125
Anyway, dad's car has become too old.

717
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,708
Anyway, could I be excused from the table?

718
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,458
I got to go.

719
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,166
But...you haven't eaten anything, Sam.

720
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,166
Bahadur, get the main course.

721
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,666
Why don't you try coming from the door sometime?

722
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,708
Doors are for normal people, my child.

723
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:53,375
What are you? - I am God!

724
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,833
Sad!

725
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,458
By the way, your God of Rock's album isn't bad.

726
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,625
I must admit, Morrison is a genius.

727
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:08,166
No, no, no. Was?

728
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:09,041
You know the beauty, don't you?

729
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:09,875
What?

730
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,500
Morrison's part of the 27 club. - What?

731
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,250
It means gone before 27.

732
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,000
James Dean, Jimmy Hendricks, Janice Joplin.

733
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,333
All part of the same club. - I see.

734
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:26,000
Only the good die young, silly boy.

735
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,791
Hey..

736
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,125
You know what.

737
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,666
Someday we'll visit Morrison's grave in Paris.

738
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,208
What say, done? - Done.

739
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,416
So...did you write anything for the Summer Carnival?

740
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,958
You'll get me beaten up.

741
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,666
There it is.

742
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,458
Sam, return it. - Don't be such a rude.

743
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,041
You are..

744
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,250
A love song.

745
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,166
I was just scribbling something. - I like that.

746
00:40:55,666 --> 00:41:00,041
So tell me...what's the best way to impress girls?

747
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,333
You're asking me.

748
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,333
You're the champ.

749
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,458
You know the Kasauli way.

750
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:06,458
It's different?

751
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,041
So...what's the magic?

752
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:14,208
But who's the girl? - Jesus.

753
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,875
Have you fallen for a girl, Sam?

754
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,291
Sam doesn't fall for girls..

755
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,000
..girls fall for Sam. - I know, I know.

756
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,125
We need to rehearse this song.

757
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,166
Let's go to the sets. - Let me take my bag.

758
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:30,333
Take it.

759
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,583
Good job, guys.

760
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:32,875
And good job, Bob.

761
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,166
You're a born drummer.

762
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,041
And Siddi boy, good work with the piano.

763
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,625
Your skills finally came to use. - Thanks.

764
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:39,583
Stop, bro.

765
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,958
Have mercy on Elvis' instruments.

766
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,291
And, guys, at the carnival..

767
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:47,208
..all girls will go crazy for our band.

768
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:48,958
Mine's already impressed.

769
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,666
Just watch, at the carnival all girls will go..

770
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,000
Chill. Chill. Chill.

771
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,333
At the carnival, drinks on me.

772
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,291
Thank you, Sam. - It's going to be a party.

773
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:02,541
Let's meet tomorrow.

774
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,833
Don't touch the drum-set, get it.

775
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,125
Run..

776
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,125
Why you..

777
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:13,625
Blondie! Blondie! Blondie!

778
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,416
Gulabo...how do you do, madam.

779
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:17,333
Blondie! Blondie!

780
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:18,541
That foreigner.

781
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,333
She's a Canada Exchange student.

782
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,583
Have you seen your faces?

783
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,125
She won't give you a second look.

784
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,250
Just wait and watch, stupid.

785
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,125
One day I'll make her your sister-in-law.

786
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,916
Stupid? You called me stupid.

787
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,833
Come on, come on, come on.

788
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,833
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

789
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,625
Nice. Nice, nice, nice.

790
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,333
One day I am going to treat everyone to whiskey on the rocks.

791
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,083
Honestly.

792
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:46,166
Thanks.

793
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:47,125
He's drunk from the whiff.

794
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,166
Don't give him too much..

795
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,541
..or he won't get on stage. - Stage?

796
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:51,541
Of course.

797
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:52,833
Did you forget what I taught you? - No, man.

798
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,750
We remember everything.

799
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,666
Let's go for it. - Come on.

800
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,166
Alpha Beta Gama Theta.

801
00:42:58,666 --> 00:42:59,875
Only the beautiful triumphs.

802
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,833
Who's going to make some noise?

803
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,833
Kasauli Cowboys!

804
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:33,375
"My heart doesn't listen to me."

805
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:39,000
"Doesn't stay with me."

806
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,458
"My heart doesn't listen to me."

807
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:50,041
"Doesn't stay with me."

808
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:55,583
"All it wants is to be with you."

809
00:43:56,083 --> 00:44:01,375
"Talks only about you."

810
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,166
"Are you.."

811
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,291
"Are you the one."

812
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:12,791
"My heart doesn't listen to me."

813
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:16,791
"My heart.."

814
00:44:55,291 --> 00:45:00,375
"It just learnt a new talent from you."

815
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:04,375
"Meets everyone with a smile."

816
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:17,458
"It fights against the world without a care."

817
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:23,125
"And bluntly says to me that I am right there."

818
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:28,791
"It's happened after I met you."

819
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:34,458
"Because you've touched my heart."

820
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,250
"Are you.."

821
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,166
"Are you the one."

822
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,875
"Are you.."

823
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,125
"Are you the one."

824
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:51,666
"My heart doesn't listen to me."

825
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:57,458
"My heart.."

826
00:45:57,958 --> 00:46:02,958
"My heart doesn't listen to me."

827
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:06,958
"My heart.."

828
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,666
And then suddenly love was in the air.

829
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,000
All the Cowboys were in love.

830
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,458
Aisha and Bobby.

831
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:48,333
Tino Roxy and Suzy.

832
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,416
Naintara and me.

833
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:55,416
We were all in love.

834
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,375
Guess who?

835
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,375
Naintara.

836
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:06,208
That's not fair.

837
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,666
So this is your secret place.

838
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,125
Do you come here every day..

839
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,166
..and write alone? - Yes.

840
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:12,666
Just like that.

841
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,625
I try.

842
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,083
By the way, look.

843
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:18,458
Telescope.

844
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:21,291
How's the experience looking through this?

845
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:26,208
You can see a glimpse of heaven. - What?

846
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:27,250
Nothing.

847
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,166
Hello beautiful one. - Sam. Hi.

848
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,250
Hey, how did you get here? - Right now.

849
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,000
From down there.

850
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,666
Come on, guys, we've to get to the shed.

851
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,166
Everyone's waiting there. - Yes.

852
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,666
Do we have to go? It's so beautiful here.

853
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,416
What? You know what?

854
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:47,083
If you don't come... I'll jump to my death.

855
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:48,833
What? Oh my God, Sam!

856
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:49,833
Relax.

857
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:54,833
That's an old trick. Look below.

858
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,125
Siddi, my boy. Get out.

859
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,166
Showoff!

860
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,041
You know what, Sam, you're crazy.

861
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,791
Anyone can go crazy for you, beautiful nun.

862
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:04,958
Not funny, okay.

863
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,166
Come here, give me a hand.

864
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,083
Come on.

865
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,416
That's my girl.

866
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:13,166
I was so lost in my world of love..

867
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,458
..that I completely overlooked..

868
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,333
..Sam was in love with her too.

869
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:18,833
Excuse me, sir.

870
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,833
We're now ready to board. - Thank you.

871
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,750
Back after a long time, sir.

872
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,833
Few years more and you've completed your exile.

873
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,750
Welcome to India. - Thank you.

874
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,750
Next please.

875
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,083
I still remember.

876
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,458
Things began to change that summer with Sam's birthday.

877
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:54,708
Happy birthday dear Sam!

878
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,083
Happy birthday to you!

879
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,625
But my birthday was two day ago, dodos.

880
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,375
The day you gift someone, is his birthday.

881
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,125
Surprise.

882
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:07,125
Alright. Not bad.

883
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:08,541
Nice.

884
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,541
Look at the tires.

885
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,125
Mama's secretary can't even spell my name correctly.

886
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:24,041
Great.

887
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:28,916
Sam, you know aunt's busy.

888
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,666
At least she sent a gift.

889
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:37,416
Aren't you going to take a test ride?

890
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,083
By the way, Sam.

891
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,458
I got you passes..

892
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:45,458
..for Punjabi Rock from Chandigarh.

893
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,791
Alright.

894
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,583
That's my boy.

895
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,250
What?

896
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,500
Give me the concert tickets.

897
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,500
Into the cars, boys.

898
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:27,000
"Free your destiny."

899
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,166
"Speak your mind freely."

900
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,416
"All the girls in the world."

901
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:35,458
"Will live on our conditions."

902
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,833
"The world will be at our feet."

903
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:39,500
"Scream and say."

904
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,916
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

905
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:48,166
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

906
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:52,625
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

907
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,625
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

908
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:22,750
"Having fun is what we're used to."

909
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,666
"We would want to drive a Ferrari."

910
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:31,166
"Having fun is what we're used to."

911
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:35,166
"We would want to drive a Ferrari."

912
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,666
"I know the world's not too sweet."

913
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,916
"But I am completely prepared."

914
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,041
"We don't give or take tension."

915
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,166
"We just beat the drums of fun."

916
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:48,166
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

917
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:52,416
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

918
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:56,708
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

919
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:00,708
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

920
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:26,333
"Free your destiny."

921
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:30,625
"Speak your mind freely."

922
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,791
"All the girls in the world."

923
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:35,000
"Will live on our conditions."

924
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,083
"The world will be at our feet."

925
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,041
"Scream and say."

926
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:43,166
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

927
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:47,375
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

928
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,791
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

929
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:56,291
"Out of control boys." "Boys out of control."

930
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,875
The kings of Kasauli.

931
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,916
Now that's what you call an amazing concert.

932
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:05,875
Everyone's totally wasted.

933
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:07,750
Rocking booze.

934
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,125
Rocking friends.

935
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:10,833
And rocking party.

936
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,125
You know what.

937
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,666
One day I'll rock that auditorium with my songs.

938
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,791
Hey...are you crazy?

939
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:18,875
Listen.

940
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:23,041
They will clobber you if you sing the friendship song there.

941
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,583
I'll sing the most incredible rocking songs.

942
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,541
Just start writing.

943
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,583
Don't include me in your grand plans.

944
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,375
I'll be on my way to the US.

945
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:36,125
You want me to stop studying for this.

946
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,958
What are you doing?

947
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:43,125
I'll write it myself, and better than your poems.

948
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:44,125
Good. Very good.

949
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,291
Write.

950
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,000
My first song would be..

951
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,625
"Our friendship was like old jeans."

952
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:55,708
"But your friendship.."

953
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,958
"But your friendship.."

954
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:03,458
"Yanked the string out of my pants."

955
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:07,458
A new poet has come.

956
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,083
Hey beautiful nun.

957
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,250
Sam. You here?

958
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,291
I haven't seen you for a while.

959
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,166
Missed me?

960
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,291
Anyway, what did you wish for?

961
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:24,750
Someone told me that..

962
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,375
..if I light a candle here I'll be blessed with true love.

963
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:29,416
So I just..

964
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,833
Really? - Yes.

965
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,333
Well, if that's true then..

966
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,166
..I should light a candle too, right?

967
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:39,666
I never imagined you're the 'church type'.

968
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,458
That's an insult to Saint Samuel.

969
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,750
I come here once a year to say thank you.

970
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,375
Oh...how could I forget?

971
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,916
Happy Birthday. - Thank you.

972
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:54,916
By the way, what did you wish for?

973
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,291
Oh my God, Sam.

974
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:02,375
Why did you do that?

975
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,791
Relax, it's okay.

976
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:04,916
It's absolutely okay.

977
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,250
I did sterilize the blade before I did this.

978
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,000
Anyway, the party starts at 8.

979
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:10,916
And if you come..

980
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:14,458
..my birthday will be all the more special.

981
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,791
Oh, God! Jesus.

982
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,666
My sugar-syrup!

983
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,875
Look what I stole from papa's room.

984
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:22,958
Condom.

985
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:27,125
You pack bullets with your gun.

986
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,666
You didn't get it?

987
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,125
What if things get hot between me and Roxy..

988
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,041
..at Sam's birthday party?

989
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,625
Things get hot!

990
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,041
She'll find me hot.

991
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,041
Take a look in the mirror. - Forget it.

992
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,041
Mom says in these glasses..

993
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,666
..I look like Shahrukh from 'Baazigar'.

994
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:48,291
You need 'Complan' not condoms.

995
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,250
Then you keep it, Bobby.

996
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,666
Get lost.

997
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:55,041
Real men are into real things.

998
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,416
Real? What?

999
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,291
Children, what's up?

1000
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,875
Hello, uncle. - Hello, son.

1001
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,958
Listen. - Yes.

1002
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,416
Did you go into my room yesterday?

1003
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:08,416
My stuff's missing.

1004
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:10,750
What stuff, papa?

1005
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,125
Don't touch my things.

1006
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,416
Stupid. - Papa, I'm going.

1007
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:17,666
It's Sam's birthday.

1008
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,125
I've to buy a gift for him. - Where are you going?

1009
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:20,416
And the decorations..

1010
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:21,666
Goodbye, papa.

1011
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,750
God bless. - You're taking the scooter.

1012
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,458
I need to make deliveries.

1013
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,666
Stupid fool.

1014
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,416
You fools, you think it's funny.

1015
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:31,416
Let's go.

1016
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:35,416
Uncle, your stuff's lying on the ground.

1017
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:42,291
How did this get here?

1018
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,041
Oh no, it's closed again.

1019
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,291
Just wait for a while.

1020
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,791
The bakery will reopen.

1021
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,041
Hi. - Hi.

1022
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:59,041
Where have you been the past few days?

1023
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,416
You weren't at your secret spot either.

1024
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:04,375
Actually, I was busy organizing Sam's birthday.

1025
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:05,541
He's throwing a party today.

1026
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,125
You're invited too.

1027
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,791
I don't think I'll come. - Why?

1028
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,666
It's just that Sam's a bit crazy.

1029
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,291
You have to come.

1030
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:15,750
You love the chocolate pastries..

1031
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,458
..from this bakery, don't you.

1032
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,708
Come to the party and I'll treat you.

1033
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,500
But only if the bakery opens.

1034
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,416
Kasauli's really a dormant city.

1035
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:29,958
Dormant men. Closed shops.

1036
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:33,916
Look...even the clock on that tower's not working.

1037
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:39,750
Time's stopped...because you're here.

1038
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,375
What? - Nothing.

1039
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,000
The bakery's opened up. Come on.

1040
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,291
Bobby, I need to say something urgent..

1041
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:48,500
..at the party, okay.

1042
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,916
Fine, fine.

1043
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:52,791
By the way, I got you something from Chandigarh.

1044
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,791
God, you're crazy. Shut up, okay.

1045
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,416
It's serious, and you..

1046
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:00,208
Listen, sister's here... I'll talk to you later.

1047
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:01,791
Bye-bye-bye.

1048
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,375
Hello. - Hey, sister.

1049
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,625
When did you come back from the church?

1050
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,291
Just now. - Cool.

1051
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:13,750
By the way...aren't you getting to close to this Bobby?

1052
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,750
Oh sister, please, I am already quite stressed out.

1053
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,958
Just not in the mood for lecture, okay.

1054
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:20,375
So just forget it.

1055
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,750
You won't get it.

1056
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,791
Those two are already crazy about you.

1057
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,625
And...you're so mature.

1058
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,166
Forget it. Listen.

1059
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:30,791
Wear these earrings.

1060
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,500
They will match your red-party theme.

1061
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Superb. Love you.

1062
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,041
Are you sure you're not coming to the party?

1063
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:41,166
Yes, I am sure.

1064
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,791
By the way, which one do you like?

1065
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,125
I mean...I really like Sam.

1066
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,291
He's so cool.

1067
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,541
But I know you... you must have fallen for that..

1068
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:57,250
..intense poet.. - Get out of here.

1069
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,750
Hey, I am wearing your red sandals, okay.

1070
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,166
'Intense poet type.'

1071
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,750
I like that.

1072
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,041
Thank God you're coming along.

1073
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:09,666
Now I just hope this moped starts up.

1074
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:13,041
Even it doesn't want me to go to the party.

1075
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:15,875
What's your problem? - Sam.

1076
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,041
How many times do I tell you?

1077
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:19,041
Sam flirts with every girl.

1078
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:22,791
But he's a sweet harmless guy, okay.

1079
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:27,750
And...I don't think this moped's going to start today.

1080
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,541
Is it okay if we walk? - Yes, I like walking.

1081
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,166
Sure. - Yes.

1082
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:35,375
Fine, then I'll leave my moped here tonight.

1083
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,375
Come on.

1084
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,416
Wow, look at that.

1085
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:00,958
It's so beautiful.

1086
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,708
Wow.

1087
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,666
"Her laugh...the fragrance."

1088
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,291
"I still remember it."

1089
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,875
"First love...always stays fragrant in your mind.."

1090
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:34,875
"..I wonder why?"

1091
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,333
You've to tell him about us today. Please.

1092
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:58,666
Fine, I'll tell him.

1093
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,166
What's the big deal?

1094
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:01,458
It's a big deal for me.

1095
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:02,791
For my sake. Please.

1096
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:06,250
Come on, Cowboys, party.

1097
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,250
Cheers.

1098
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,458
Hi, Sam, happy birthday.

1099
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,458
Thank you.

1100
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,875
Thank you so much.

1101
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,958
You're looking very, very pretty tonight.

1102
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:34,666
Excuse me.

1103
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,791
Brother! - Happy birthday, dear.

1104
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:39,416
Where were you? - On the way.

1105
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:42,708
Retro guitar, it had to be your idea.

1106
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:44,208
I know a bit about your taste too.

1107
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:45,916
Come on, let's drink.

1108
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,750
How are you, Bahadur? - First class.

1109
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,125
Happy birthday.

1110
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:55,791
Alpha Beta Gama Theta.

1111
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,416
Only the beautiful triumphs.

1112
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:58,833
Who's going to make some noise?

1113
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:03,250
Kasauli Cowboys!

1114
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,083
Idiot...you're drunk.

1115
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,666
Don't stop me tonight.

1116
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:09,000
My night.

1117
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,250
Baby.

1118
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,750
Baby. - What?

1119
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,250
Either kiss me or dance him.

1120
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,458
Forget this.

1121
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,666
Dance me baby.

1122
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,500
Kiss me baby. - No, no.

1123
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,875
Kiss me.

1124
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:21,875
Kiss me. - Come here.

1125
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,875
Dance me.

1126
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,375
What the..

1127
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:34,375
I meant my cheeks, but she had me tongue-tied..

1128
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,666
I had to tell you something important.

1129
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:42,583
I had to tell you something important. - Tell me.

1130
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:47,291
About Nayantara.

1131
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,750
Yes.

1132
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,458
Something about her.

1133
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:58,208
Whenever I see her...my whole world lights up.

1134
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,750
I think I am in love, Siddi boy.

1135
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,750
I think I am in love.

1136
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:12,750
What were you saying? - Nothing.

1137
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,541
Happy birthday.

1138
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,958
Happy birthday to you.

1139
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:21,750
Happy birthday to you.

1140
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:26,875
Happy birthday dear Sam.

1141
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,541
Listen, Bobby, I have to tell you..

1142
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,041
..and it's really serious.

1143
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,416
I've been trying to tell you, but you don't listen.

1144
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:35,875
Come on, babes.

1145
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,625
No serious talks tonight.

1146
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,291
Only party...and dance.

1147
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,416
Come on. Come here.

1148
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:43,875
Bobby, this is not funny. Listen to me.

1149
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,666
Chill out. Smile.

1150
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:49,375
A dance with the most beautiful girl in the party.

1151
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:50,250
I am fine.

1152
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,541
Come on.

1153
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,250
Sam, I am fine. - Come and dance with me.

1154
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,291
I am fine.

1155
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:57,916
You're my favorite girl, come here.

1156
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:01,708
I am fine, Sam. - Come on.

1157
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,750
I think you look so hot in this dress.

1158
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,750
Too beautiful..

1159
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,291
Baby, let's kiss.

1160
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,500
Sam, what are you doing?

1161
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,875
What happened? - What's your problem?

1162
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,416
Sam. Get up.

1163
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:30,416
Get up, it's okay.

1164
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:31,500
Nayantara.

1165
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,750
Get a grip on yourself.

1166
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:34,750
What happened?

1167
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:35,666
Ask your best friend.

1168
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,541
Sid. Let her go.

1169
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,375
She's a bloody tease.

1170
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:41,416
If I say something..

1171
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:43,000
..you'll come up with a thousand excuses.

1172
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,833
And did you tell him about us?

1173
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,041
Sid, let her go.

1174
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:49,750
Let her go.

1175
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,166
I knew it.

1176
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:52,375
Go to hell.

1177
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,000
Sid, come back now.

1178
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,625
Sid.

1179
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,791
Come back, Sid.

1180
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,291
That day fate was asking me..

1181
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:05,250
..whether I wanted love... or friendship.

1182
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,583
But I couldn't decide.

1183
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:13,708
Maybe I was a coward... or maybe just confused.

1184
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,541
By the way, where in Kasauli are you heading?

1185
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:19,541
Lawrence Estate.

1186
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,750
Sam. Sam.

1187
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,916
Listen. - Yes.

1188
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:26,666
I just received my MIT interview call.

1189
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,875
I have to leave for Delhi today.

1190
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,041
Congrats, ma. - Thanks.

1191
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:34,125
Oh my head.

1192
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:38,125
This hangover is killing me.

1193
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,916
By the way, I had to talk to you about something important.

1194
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,916
About last night.. About Nayantara.

1195
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,791
Yes.

1196
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:49,875
I was so stupid.

1197
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,041
I shouldn't have such things.

1198
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,541
I will apologize to her..

1199
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,125
..but let me sleep not, Sid.

1200
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,791
Please. Goodnight.

1201
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,916
Where are you going?

1202
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,416
Go back to sleep.

1203
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,625
What sleep?

1204
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:10,166
She's called 15 times this morning.

1205
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:11,041
Aisha.

1206
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,250
Aisha? - Yes.

1207
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,666
Tell her I am not here.

1208
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:19,791
Hello, Aisha.

1209
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:21,916
He's saying he isn't here. - You..

1210
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:24,291
I mean...I mean..

1211
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,458
He..

1212
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:26,458
Give it to me.

1213
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,500
Bloody idiot.

1214
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,791
Hello, Aisha.

1215
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:31,416
Siddharth here.

1216
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,375
Can I speak to Nayantara?

1217
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,875
Hello.

1218
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,250
She hung up.

1219
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,625
That's girls for you.

1220
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,416
I'll leave too.

1221
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,791
Go home. - Come on.

1222
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,041
She's really troubled me a lot.

1223
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,125
I wonder what she wants.

1224
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:54,125
Let's go.

1225
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:59,583
N...I am really sorry for last night.

1226
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,875
Beautiful nun, can you please forgive me?

1227
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:07,750
Yeah!

1228
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,416
Look, I can't help you.

1229
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:10,250
Okay.

1230
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,791
Keep this..

1231
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:16,166
Keep this money and just get it done somewhere.

1232
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,041
I don't want your stupid money, okay.

1233
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,916
I thought you would come along.

1234
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,458
I am not going anywhere. - Bobby.

1235
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,750
Bobby, please listen.

1236
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,291
Bobby, I haven't even told my sister yet.

1237
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:32,083
God. Just if we had used protection that day.

1238
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:35,458
Look...how long have we known each other?

1239
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:36,750
Three months.

1240
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,333
And how can I be sure whether it's me..

1241
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,000
..or someone else.

1242
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,166
Maybe someone back in Mumbai.

1243
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,416
What? Just..

1244
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,583
How dare you?

1245
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,166
You.. Don't try that again, get it.

1246
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:50,750
Bobby, what are you doing?

1247
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,666
Stay away from this, Sam.

1248
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:54,416
And she's not nave.

1249
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,458
And I didn't rape her, okay.

1250
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:57,916
She came to me willingly.

1251
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,208
Oh, God!

1252
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:00,916
And what do you care?

1253
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:04,250
Are you having an affair with her? - Bobby.

1254
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,541
Stop it!

1255
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:06,916
Stop it, please.

1256
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,166
Stop it, both of you. - Get the hell out of here.

1257
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:09,416
Get out. - Fine.

1258
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:11,375
I'm not too keen on staying here either.

1259
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:12,916
Here's...your Zippo.

1260
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,125
To hell with you and your friendship.

1261
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,666
Just get out.

1262
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:19,416
I'll never see your face again!

1263
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:23,416
Oh, God!

1264
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,250
It's all over.

1265
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,250
It's all over.

1266
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:46,208
And then Sam handled everything.

1267
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,666
He took Aisha to an abortion clinic close to Kasauli.

1268
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,750
He helped her like a responsible brother.

1269
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,125
Sister, I am scared.

1270
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:57,125
It was suddenly as if he grew up that summer.

1271
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,666
And then Nayantara's view towards him changed.

1272
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,625
She saw that Sam's a true friend..

1273
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:30,583
..who helped them in desperate times.

1274
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,541
By the time I returned from the interview..

1275
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,666
..much had changed.

1276
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:37,291
Aisha, didn't you get the joke?

1277
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,791
Santa went for the interview on a Sunday.

1278
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,791
He's telling you the 'Egg' joke.

1279
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:42,875
Santa..

1280
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:43,791
Here. - Thank you.

1281
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,541
Siddhu. When did you return?

1282
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:46,500
Today morning.

1283
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,583
How are you? - How are you?

1284
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:52,708
Did Sam tell you on the phone? - Yes, he did.

1285
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:55,416
Bobby ran away. - I know.

1286
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:58,541
Just a second.

1287
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:00,416
Hi, Aisha.

1288
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:03,416
Sorry I wasn't here.

1289
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:05,875
Aisha, don't worry.

1290
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:09,333
Everything will be fine, okay.

1291
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,291
I don't understand.

1292
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,416
Why me?

1293
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:19,916
Have some water.

1294
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,125
We're with you.

1295
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,416
If it wasn't for Sam..

1296
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,791
..I can't imagine what would've happened.

1297
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,541
Where is he? - He's in the shed.

1298
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,791
I'll go meet him.

1299
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:37,291
I didn't get a chance to say this before.

1300
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:41,250
No one does what you did.

1301
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,750
I am sorry.

1302
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,500
I...misjudged you.

1303
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,666
It's really okay.

1304
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:50,875
Even I am ashamed for my behavior..

1305
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,916
..on the night of the party.

1306
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:53,875
Really sorry.

1307
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:54,916
I was an idiot.

1308
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,166
I just wanted to say that I..

1309
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:00,791
I.. - I love you too, beautiful nun.

1310
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:04,291
I am so happy for us.

1311
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,791
Sid, you're back.

1312
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:10,541
You're back.

1313
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:14,666
I am back, Sam.

1314
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,166
I am back.

1315
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:21,166
But I took too long.

1316
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:29,458
Losing you will be the biggest grief of my life.

1317
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,541
Billo, stop the car.

1318
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:02,625
Stop.

1319
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:05,375
Siddharth sir, stop the car.

1320
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,125
What happened?

1321
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:10,458
Siddharth sir, come.

1322
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,375
Myself Bunty.

1323
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:13,333
It's nice to finally meet you.

1324
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,250
I sent the car for you.

1325
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,000
I thought you would come home.

1326
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,875
But then I learnt that you went straight to the estate..

1327
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:21,208
Yes, I was just returning from Lawrence Estate..

1328
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,500
Yes, your mother.

1329
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,166
She used to talk a lot about you.

1330
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,083
I used to handle all her matters after you.

1331
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,375
You asked me to arrange for a priest.

1332
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:30,541
I've done that.

1333
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:31,875
Just freshen up..

1334
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:33,791
..and then I'll get the priest whenever you want.

1335
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,166
So let's ride on the back of my scooter.

1336
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:36,541
No, I'll take the car.

1337
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,750
Fresh air. - No, I'll take the car.

1338
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,750
Thank you so much. - Fine, as you wish.

1339
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,958
After returning to Kasauli..

1340
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:51,958
..I could still smell the old memories in the air.

1341
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,208
Suddenly it felt like..

1342
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:16,833
..those voices were calling me.

1343
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,625
'Sam!'

1344
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:19,583
'Is this the way?'

1345
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:20,458
'Why?'

1346
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:21,750
'Even Romeo came through the window..'

1347
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,833
'..to meet his Juliet.'

1348
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,333
'No one ever stopped him.'

1349
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,291
Each day in Kasauli was like celebration time.

1350
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,791
I never thought the day would come..

1351
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:36,791
..when that world would fade away.

1352
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,833
I was just checking..

1353
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:48,666
..you didn't bring aunt's death certificate along.

1354
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:50,666
You know she died in New York.

1355
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:52,291
Why didn't you tell me?

1356
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,541
Look sir, we'll find a way out..

1357
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,875
..if we don't have her death certificate.

1358
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,166
Let's do one thing.

1359
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:00,250
Let's ask a high-court lawyer..

1360
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,791
..to make an affidavit.

1361
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:03,083
It'll take around 8-10 days. - 10 days?

1362
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:03,958
Yes.

1363
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,333
Bunty, I don't have 10 days.

1364
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:06,166
I am leaving.

1365
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:07,875
Not again.

1366
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,166
Why are you always in a hurry?

1367
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:11,958
Can I say something, don't mind?

1368
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:13,583
You mother built this property..

1369
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,458
..with such love and care.

1370
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:17,541
So sell it to someone worthy.

1371
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,041
So that her soul rests in peace too.

1372
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:20,291
Right?

1373
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:22,250
Just a thought.

1374
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,500
Fine. 7 days.

1375
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,875
But no more. Okay? - Okay, sir.

1376
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,541
I'll get your work done..

1377
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:32,791
..before the water and food here gets to you.

1378
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,458
Bunty, can I please have my hand back?

1379
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:35,750
Of course, it's all yours.

1380
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,208
Keep it.

1381
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:42,041
There used to be a music store here. - It still is.

1382
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:42,958
Two-in-one.

1383
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:44,666
Music store on the inside and caf outside.

1384
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,916
Sometimes he changes according to his mood.

1385
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:47,791
Sometimes the music store comes out..

1386
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:51,791
..and the caf goes in.

1387
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:01,916
'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas'!

1388
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:06,083
'It's one of my favorite songs.'

1389
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:10,000
'With time the ink on the pages fades away.'

1390
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,791
'But what about the memories etched on the heart..'

1391
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:13,916
'..that torments you every day."

1392
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:16,708
Yo, Siddi boy.

1393
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,458
Look.

1394
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:23,000
This is how you shave.

1395
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,541
See what you did?

1396
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,875
Now I'll have this scar all my life.

1397
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,166
Girls are crazy about scars, Sam.

1398
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:34,625
Idiot...at least this way you won't forget me.

1399
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:36,541
Now stop crying, come here.

1400
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:38,666
'I'll always remember you Sam.'

1401
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:42,666
'The wound of losing you...will never heal.'

1402
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:11,750
I am talking about Lawrence Estate.

1403
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,166
Please ask them to find Sherry Lawrence. - Yes, sir.

1404
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:15,208
Thank you.

1405
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,375
It's not here.

1406
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:19,750
I searched all the records.

1407
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,625
But there's no clue about any Sherry Lawrence.

1408
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,916
All that hard work for nothing.

1409
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:26,583
Tell me something. - Yes.

1410
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,541
Why are you after that particular woman?

1411
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:33,250
Can't you manage with someone else?

1412
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,000
Bunty, thank you.

1413
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,000
You're welcome.

1414
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,125
Bunty. - Yes.

1415
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,583
The watch on the clock tower's stopped?

1416
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,458
It's always been like that.

1417
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,875
I never saw it work for ages.

1418
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:50,416
Some old connection.

1419
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,750
Bunty, please. Mind your own business.

1420
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,166
I hope this week my work gets done in Chandigarh.

1421
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:56,333
Just hold this.

1422
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:58,333
I told you I'll get your job done in a week.

1423
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,208
Just wait.

1424
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,375
Mister..

1425
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:01,250
Closed. - Darn it!

1426
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,458
What happened?

1427
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:04,333
Lunch! - What lunch?

1428
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,458
It means lunch-time.

1429
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,750
What nonsense. - Come after 2pm.

1430
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:08,666
Where's their office?

1431
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:09,625
Their complain office?

1432
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,458
The complaint office must be closed for lunch too.

1433
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:12,875
What nonsense. This is ridiculous.

1434
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,625
This is why I didn't want to come back.

1435
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:15,750
Nothing has bloody changed over here.

1436
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,250
Brother, I have an idea. - So stupid.

1437
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,416
Let's go have lunch.

1438
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:19,375
I don't want to eat anything, Bunty.

1439
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:21,000
It's an A-1 restaurant.

1440
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,125
You'll be licking your fingers.

1441
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:23,000
Take my advice.

1442
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,208
Here's your briefcase. - Yes, it's my briefcase.

1443
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:29,208
Come on. The food's really good. Come on.

1444
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:33,208
I must admit, Bunty, this fritter's really good.

1445
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,666
You know..

1446
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:43,541
It feels like I've tasted this before.

1447
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:47,958
It's very delicious.

1448
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:51,875
My God. And this sweetmeat.

1449
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:56,000
These guys really know my taste.

1450
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,916
There's lot more we know about you.

1451
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,125
Would you like to know?

1452
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh my God! Tino!

1453
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,625
After so many years.

1454
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:04,875
You look just like a Sikh!

1455
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,208
It's the Lord's grace.

1456
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,791
Won't you give me a hug? - Of course.

1457
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,625
How are you? - Fit.

1458
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,416
Suit and all.

1459
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:14,000
Looking like an NRI..

1460
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,708
George Clooney.

1461
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,708
Grandma always wanted to see you wearing a turban.

1462
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,875
You remember? - Of course I do.

1463
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:22,208
After she passed away..

1464
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,125
..I decided I'll be a good boy.

1465
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,458
But you turned out to be a bad man.

1466
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:28,375
You didn't call to say you're in Kasauli.

1467
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,083
That's why I had to devise this scheme with Bunty.

1468
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,583
Thank you, Bunty. - Welcome, sir.

1469
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,625
Shall I get you more fritters? - Of course.

1470
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:36,791
I see.

1471
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:38,583
Now I get your idea of coming to the restaurant.

1472
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:40,125
You've to stay here for the evening.

1473
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:41,250
There's a big party.

1474
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,791
We'll sip whiskeys, eat kebabs.

1475
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,833
Actually, I've to go back to the court, so I..

1476
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:46,833
What court?

1477
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,083
The court closes down here at five.

1478
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:50,458
Don't worry about me.

1479
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,375
I'll catch a bus.

1480
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,375
Would you like to meet your sister-in-law?

1481
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:54,291
Yes, of course.

1482
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:55,125
She's right here.

1483
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:56,791
Mrs. Kathuria, where are you?

1484
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:00,333
Come here. Walk faster.

1485
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:05,125
Roxy. - Hello. How are you?

1486
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:06,333
My, God!

1487
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:09,333
Little Tino. - Hi.

1488
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:10,625
Friends Forever?

1489
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:12,875
Yo!

1490
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:14,125
It looks like someone's wedding party.

1491
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,208
I am not comfortable.

1492
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:16,416
So what?

1493
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,583
Everyone's invited to the wedding.

1494
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,375
You go ahead, I.. - Come on.

1495
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:21,708
Calm down, come on.

1496
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:22,916
Roxy.. - It's okay.

1497
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:24,333
Go on. Go play with Parmeet.

1498
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:25,333
Mummy's coming.

1499
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:26,458
I am not invited.

1500
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,000
Relax.

1501
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,666
Especially in an old friend's wedding..

1502
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,708
..everyone's invited.

1503
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:33,041
Suzy! - Yes.

1504
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,458
Suzy!

1505
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,333
How are you man? - I am fine.

1506
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,166
How are you? - Just fine.

1507
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:39,708
This is your party? - Yes.

1508
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,291
I got married last year. - What are you saying?

1509
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,541
Congratulations. - Thanks.

1510
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:47,041
This is just a small reception.

1511
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,791
Come on. Come in.

1512
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:50,916
Sure, let's go.

1513
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:53,458
How was my surprise? - Superb, Tino.

1514
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:54,416
Really superb.

1515
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:55,750
You want to know something else? - What?

1516
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,458
He's my business partner as well.

1517
01:19:58,958 --> 01:19:59,375
What?

1518
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,333
We're even expanding to USA now.

1519
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,083
Well...it's good to see..

1520
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:07,041
..at least some Cowboys maintained their friendship.

1521
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,666
Anyway, so tell me... who's the bride?

1522
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,125
Bride actually..

1523
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:13,583
She's a blondie.

1524
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,291
What are you saying?

1525
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:17,541
We went to Canada on his honeymoon.

1526
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:18,916
I found Roxy's cousin.

1527
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,416
And we fell in love.

1528
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,416
Sorry, Siddhu, but we still love blondies.

1529
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:24,458
You're just..

1530
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:25,333
Forget it.

1531
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,041
Where is she? Introduce me.

1532
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:29,208
Look.

1533
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,458
Come on, brother.

1534
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,458
Everybody's waiting for you on the dance floor.

1535
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:33,791
Let's get on the dance floor.

1536
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,250
Yes, the in-laws are waiting.

1537
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,791
Come on.

1538
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,000
You wait.

1539
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,625
Someone's waiting for you here.

1540
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:43,625
Turn around.

1541
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:52,916
Hi, Siddharth. - Nayantara.

1542
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,166
We're meeting after so many years.

1543
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,916
Won't you say hello?

1544
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:02,291
Hello. Hi.

1545
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,916
I never imagined... we'll meet after so many years.

1546
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:08,791
Tino and Suzy, we kept in touch.

1547
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,875
Nice to see you. - Yeah.

1548
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,666
Same here.

1549
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,000
Do you stay in Chandigarh? - No.

1550
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,833
Delhi. - I see.

1551
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:23,041
But I am working on the design of a hotel in Kasauli.

1552
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:26,583
Oh...so you became an architect after all.

1553
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:31,125
Nice. - Yes.

1554
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,333
How's Aisha?

1555
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,083
Aisha's in Singapore.

1556
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:39,708
She's married to a banker now. - Oh.

1557
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:44,416
You know...you look just the same.

1558
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:48,041
Anyway, you want to dance?

1559
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:52,041
Sure.

1560
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:12,250
'I never imagined... after all these years...we'll meet again.'

1561
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,541
You know, Siddharth..

1562
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:17,541
..sometimes we should just forget the past and move on.

1563
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:19,500
But I can't.

1564
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,916
Sam's death changed it all... forever.

1565
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:29,250
How can I forget... that I betrayed my best friend?

1566
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:34,958
Maybe life betrayed him, not you.

1567
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,208
Maybe you're right.

1568
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,708
I wish I could meet Sam's mom.

1569
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:45,333
I told you...one day I'll treat everyone to Scotch.

1570
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,291
Cheers.

1571
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:50,291
Cheers. - Cheers, buddy.

1572
01:22:56,666 --> 01:23:00,583
Siddhu.

1573
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:05,000
You really disappointed me.

1574
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,833
I thought after Sam's death..

1575
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,708
..you will look after us.

1576
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:14,291
But you fled yourself.

1577
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:15,166
Forget it.

1578
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,291
Forget the past..

1579
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,708
You're drunk.. - I am not drunk.

1580
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:22,750
I am.. - It's okay.

1581
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,791
I couldn't say anything.

1582
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:31,791
I remember every moment of that summer.

1583
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:35,958
Everything changed after that.

1584
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:37,250
Sid, you're back.

1585
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,583
Come in, come in.

1586
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,583
How was the interview? - I am through.

1587
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:43,750
I've to leave for US next week.

1588
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:44,958
Wow!

1589
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:47,083
Congrats, man. - Thanks.

1590
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:48,958
I am so happy for you.

1591
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:51,666
Aren't you going to wish him or something?

1592
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,125
Guys, guys, guys.

1593
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:54,291
Sid's going to America.

1594
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,916
He's through.

1595
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:57,166
Congrats. Siddharth.

1596
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,916
Let's party.

1597
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:03,916
Sid! Sid! Sid! Sid! Come out.

1598
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,125
Now he will study with foreign girls.

1599
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,041
Lift him up! Lift him up!

1600
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:14,291
Hip hip hurray!

1601
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:16,625
You are going to America..

1602
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:21,333
..and didn't think it was important to tell me?

1603
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:24,791
Everything happened so soon that..

1604
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:28,708
Anyways, what's the point in telling you now?

1605
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,250
Everything has changed.

1606
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33,708
What?

1607
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:35,916
It was all clear at the shed.

1608
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:38,208
You're mistaken, Siddharth.

1609
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:43,041
Look...after what he did for Aisha..

1610
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:47,541
I don't love Sam.. - I can understand that you..

1611
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:52,208
I don't.. - Look...there's no point discussing about it.

1612
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,625
Anyway, I am going to America next week.

1613
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:58,166
There's no point hurting anyone.

1614
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,333
Let us all part as friends.

1615
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:03,875
Goodbye.

1616
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,416
And after that evening..

1617
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:10,125
..everything changed between me and Nayantara.

1618
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,125
I was just counting my days..

1619
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,041
..for going to America.

1620
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,333
Bahadur. - Yes, Sam sir.

1621
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:15,666
Give him the red jacket too. - Yes.

1622
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:17,583
Enough, Sam, my suitcase will explode.

1623
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,208
Let me.

1624
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,625
And...your farewell party's day after.

1625
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:22,666
I hope you remember that.

1626
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:23,791
I remember.

1627
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:24,916
I've to go now.

1628
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:26,333
I still have lots of packing to do at home.

1629
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:28,416
Thanks, Bahadur.

1630
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:32,333
Your phone is ringing. - Someone will answer it.

1631
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:33,375
Thanks for the clothes.

1632
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,750
No problem.

1633
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,708
Why are you ruining the jeans?

1634
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:41,458
Once it's ready you will know how special they are.

1635
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:42,958
The phone's been ringing for so long. Answer it.

1636
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:43,958
I'll take this.

1637
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:47,291
Siddhu sir...I'll get you a bag. - Thanks, Bahadur.

1638
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,958
Hello. - Hello, Abhijeet.

1639
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,291
Dr. Goyal's reports have arrived.

1640
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:53,666
The reports are negative.

1641
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,083
You're not going to be a father after all.

1642
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,750
Excuse me. - What happened?

1643
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,625
Aren't you happy?

1644
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,333
What happened?

1645
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:04,666
Is your wife around?

1646
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:06,416
It's me Sunita.

1647
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:10,291
From the Delhi office.

1648
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,041
What's wrong with you?

1649
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:17,083
Who was it? - Nothing. Wrong number.

1650
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:18,083
Leave now.

1651
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:22,083
Hey nice. It suits you.

1652
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:28,750
When were you going to talk about her to mom?

1653
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,666
About whom?

1654
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:33,583
Abhijeet, stop pretending.

1655
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:37,916
You very well know I am talking about Sunita.

1656
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:40,083
Sunita?

1657
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:41,791
Sunita..

1658
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:44,208
Sunita's the secretary at my Delhi office.

1659
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,583
So? - Come on.

1660
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:52,041
Listen, don't take me for a fool.

1661
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,333
Don't you try and fool me.

1662
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:58,708
Here's the cheque for your tuition fees.

1663
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:01,666
You do your work and let me do mine.

1664
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:03,833
Go on.

1665
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,541
Listen to me.

1666
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:11,416
Either you talk to mom or I do.

1667
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:14,250
No matter how much one does for cheapsters like you..

1668
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,833
..it's never enough.

1669
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:19,250
You fool.

1670
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,041
Learn to behave.

1671
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,041
I am like a father to you.

1672
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,208
You..

1673
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:26,666
What are you doing? - Sam!

1674
01:27:27,166 --> 01:27:28,333
Sherry. - Sam, stop it.

1675
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:29,666
Better tell him.

1676
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,125
What are you doing, Sam?

1677
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:33,625
Why don't you ask your husband?

1678
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,458
He's the fool, I am telling you.

1679
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,958
I've just had enough of this, Sam.

1680
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,208
Apologies.

1681
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:40,708
I said apologies.

1682
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:41,666
Mom, take my advice..

1683
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,041
..and leave him before he ruins us.

1684
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:48,458
I don't need your advice.

1685
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,208
You don't need me either, mom.

1686
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:51,708
Sam!

1687
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:55,875
Sam!

1688
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:59,875
Sam sir..

1689
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:35,375
The tickets will be ready tomorrow.

1690
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,416
Go and collect it.

1691
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:38,625
Mom, my farewell party's the day after.

1692
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:41,250
How many things are you going to make me do before I go?

1693
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:45,458
Come to Chandigarh with me.

1694
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:48,458
No, son.

1695
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:50,041
New nursery batches.

1696
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:51,750
Children.

1697
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,541
Flower orders.

1698
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,750
I can't come. You go.

1699
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:00,208
What happened?

1700
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:03,833
Mrs. Monica Ray, you are very bad with goodbye you know that.

1701
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:05,083
Look at me.

1702
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:08,916
Look at me. - No.

1703
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:11,041
No crying.

1704
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:14,541
Siddhu!

1705
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:18,208
I am going to miss you. - Miss you too, mom.

1706
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:22,208
Look after yourself.

1707
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:26,208
Go, take a look. - Going.

1708
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:27,625
Go.

1709
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,500
Siddhu, open the door. - You two.

1710
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,625
What are you two doing here?

1711
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:34,583
How are you?

1712
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,125
We just came to say bye.

1713
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,041
How are you, Suzy? - How are you?

1714
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,000
Come in.

1715
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,125
Come, let's sit.

1716
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:43,791
Here.

1717
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:46,416
A farewell gift from us.

1718
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:49,125
It's the most expensive pen from the Novelty Store.

1719
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:54,208
You like writing, don't you? - Thanks.

1720
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:59,250
Siddhu. Now you're leaving too.

1721
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,000
Our group's slowly breaking up.

1722
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,333
Why will it break up?

1723
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,000
Sam and I will visit every year.

1724
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,375
And you two will go to the University as well.

1725
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,125
The Cowboys will have a reunion in summers.

1726
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:10,833
Okay?

1727
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,250
Yes, bro, I'll go to the Busa institute.

1728
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,791
And if he doesn't succeed in medical..

1729
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:16,708
..I'll take him along with me to Delhi.

1730
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,250
All the best. - But, Siddhu.

1731
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:20,583
You know something.

1732
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,333
It won't be the same without you and Sam.

1733
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:24,625
By the way, we'll need to..

1734
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,333
..prepone my farewell party.

1735
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:27,375
Actually I've to go to Chandigarh..

1736
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:28,791
..to collect my passport and visa, so..

1737
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:29,958
No problem.

1738
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,541
Just tell Sam.

1739
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,291
He's making all the arrangements.

1740
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:34,291
We met in the morning.

1741
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:35,458
But he isn't answering his phone now.

1742
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:36,583
I wonder where he is.

1743
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,416
Then go to his house.

1744
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:42,416
Yes, good idea.

1745
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,000
Sam.

1746
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:57,833
Sam! What are you doing?

1747
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,458
What's wrong with you?

1748
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,500
Sam. What happened?

1749
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,916
No, Sid. Just leave. - Sam.

1750
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:06,666
Listen, won't you tell me?

1751
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:10,666
What's wrong with you?

1752
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:20,458
Do you know...what's the most overrated emotion in the world?

1753
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:24,000
It's love.

1754
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,541
Because some day it shatters.

1755
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:28,750
I was just six when..

1756
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,750
..father eloped to Paris with that Catherine.

1757
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:38,666
He never looked back.

1758
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:45,625
Parent's love is like the rain, man.

1759
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,916
It's not like that.

1760
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:51,291
Come on. Forget about all this. okay?

1761
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:52,458
Sometimes I feel that..

1762
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:56,750
..everyone's my friend because I do things for them.

1763
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,416
Do you think anyone genuinely loves me?

1764
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:04,416
Do you think even Nayantara loves me?

1765
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:09,666
Everybody loves you.

1766
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,833
We're your friends.

1767
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:14,833
We're always there for you.

1768
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:17,791
I am always there for you. Okay.

1769
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:21,791
Now get up. Get up.

1770
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:29,458
That's my boy.

1771
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:32,000
Come on.

1772
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,166
Thanks, man. - Anytime.

1773
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:40,083
Friends Forever.

1774
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:41,250
Sorry, sorry, sorry. - It's okay.

1775
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:44,875
'I had no idea what was going on in Sam's personal life.'

1776
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,083
'He never discussed this aspect of his life with anyone.'

1777
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:47,916
Sam.

1778
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:49,625
Careful.

1779
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:50,541
M.

1780
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,166
'Except...maybe for my mother.'

1781
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,958
How did you know it was me?

1782
01:32:56,458 --> 01:33:00,291
Mothers always know.

1783
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:02,750
Well, if you're thinking of starting a rock band..

1784
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,875
..then you need to take care of that voice.

1785
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,416
Coffee? - Yes, of course.

1786
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:09,875
Hold this.

1787
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:13,875
I'll get another candle.

1788
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:20,833
Sam!

1789
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:22,458
What happened?

1790
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:25,916
Do you see someone's face in this mug?

1791
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:29,916
Speak up.

1792
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:35,291
M.

1793
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:38,250
Whenever I come here..

1794
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,083
..I fear what I am missing out on.

1795
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:42,750
I wonder what happens to mom.

1796
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,458
First her drinking... and now this...Abhijeet.

1797
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:50,750
Why did she have to marry him, M?

1798
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,250
It's okay.

1799
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,583
It's all a part of growing up.

1800
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:57,250
Okay, son.

1801
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:02,416
Then, M, I don't want to grow up.

1802
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:04,375
Give me a big hug.

1803
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:06,291
Power's back.

1804
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:10,666
You two...flirting again.

1805
01:34:11,166 --> 01:34:13,791
By the way...what's my part in your love story?

1806
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:15,958
You're the villain. Now get out.

1807
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:18,291
When I last checked this was my house.

1808
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:19,541
Come on.

1809
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:20,500
Let's make coffee.

1810
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,875
Hey...this is my house.

1811
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,958
What you guys say.. - Friends forever.

1812
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,083
Yes!

1813
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:30,250
Goodnight, Sam. - Goodnight, M.

1814
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:35,958
Adios amigo. - Bye.

1815
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:38,916
Siddhu.

1816
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:42,000
Can I say something? - Yes.

1817
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,833
Don't ever hurt Sam's feelings.

1818
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:48,666
Don't worry, mom, Sam's my best friend.

1819
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,500
And nothing can ever change that, okay.

1820
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,500
I know.

1821
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,500
By the way, he's throwing a farewell party for me tomorrow.

1822
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:01,291
Only the best for my favorite Cowboy.

1823
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,208
Thanks.

1824
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:02,916
Shampoo.

1825
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:04,208
You all did so much for me.

1826
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:05,208
Shampoo.

1827
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:06,291
Seriously. Thanks.

1828
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:08,416
I've written a small poem dedicated to all of you.

1829
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:11,958
Go for it.

1830
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:15,000
"Each day they'll call out."

1831
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,708
"They'll scream and shout."

1832
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:22,166
"We'll never forget... these good old days."

1833
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:24,041
Sing it.

1834
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:26,333
I can't sing. - There's always a first time.

1835
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:30,333
Come on.

1836
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:36,291
"These fun filled good old days."

1837
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:40,041
"The carefree good old days."

1838
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:46,375
"We'll never forget... these good old days."

1839
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,625
Good song. I like it. Not bad.

1840
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:53,625
"These good old days."

1841
01:35:56,125 --> 01:36:00,416
"Those carefree days."

1842
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:04,125
"Those sweet-intoxicating days."

1843
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:08,125
"We'll never forget... these good old days."

1844
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:26,875
"We never realized.."

1845
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:31,666
"..how soon these days went by."

1846
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:36,333
"Why do all these moments of happiness.."

1847
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:40,333
"..pass away so rapidly?"

1848
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:50,750
"The heart says... don't let this ambience pass-away."

1849
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:55,708
"The days filled with promises to live."

1850
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,250
"Days filled with tall expectations."

1851
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:14,833
"We'll never forget... these good old days."

1852
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:17,208
"I wish these days would last."

1853
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,500
"They always go too fast."

1854
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,416
"Some things you wished would stay the same."

1855
01:37:24,916 --> 01:37:26,500
"The magic that we share."

1856
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,916
"I feel it in the air."

1857
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:32,916
"Why do you have to go away?"

1858
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:41,000
"Happiness in the eyes...and some tears too."

1859
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:45,708
"The ambience is emotional.

1860
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:56,541
"It's not easy to say goodbye to our dear friends."

1861
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:58,000
She's fine.

1862
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,250
Nayantara..

1863
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,416
Aisha. - Are you okay?

1864
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:05,250
What's wrong? - Sorry, Aisha. I made you cry.

1865
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:08,416
It's okay, Sid. It's not your fault.

1866
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,458
Sister, I want to go home. - Are you okay?

1867
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:13,125
Yes.

1868
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,250
You stay, you've come out after a long time.

1869
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,250
You stay.

1870
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,541
Yes, Nayantara, I'll just drop her and come back.

1871
01:38:19,041 --> 01:38:20,458
I'll come too. - No, no, it's okay. I'll just be back.

1872
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:24,458
Sure? - It's okay.

1873
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:41,125
Any news about Bobby?

1874
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:42,583
Aisha.

1875
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,708
I don't think Bobby's going to come back.

1876
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:51,125
You know it's best to forget him and move on.

1877
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:55,875
Yeah. I know. - Hey, you okay?

1878
01:38:56,375 --> 01:39:00,500
Fine.

1879
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,041
Whose gift is that..

1880
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:05,250
Oh no...that's Sid's farewell gift.

1881
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:09,250
I forgot to give it to him.

1882
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:13,458
I think it's going to rain.

1883
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:15,333
Rain and champagne.

1884
01:39:15,833 --> 01:39:17,875
Wow...it's going to be fun.

1885
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:21,708
Where's your sister-in-law? - My sister-in-law or yours?

1886
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:24,166
Don't spoil my mood, Suzy.

1887
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:26,250
What did we decide on Sam's birthday?

1888
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:29,041
One who gets kissed gets the miss.

1889
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:30,416
Come on.

1890
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:34,416
Friends Forever.

1891
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:39,250
Sam, Siddhu and you are close friends, right?

1892
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,375
Best friends since we were five.

1893
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:45,708
And there's nothing to let us change that.

1894
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:49,708
Where's everyone?

1895
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:57,250
Siddharth.

1896
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,250
Where's everyone, Siddhu?

1897
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:03,250
Siddhu.

1898
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:05,750
Siddhu. - Nayantara.

1899
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,250
I just wanted to tell you one thing that day.

1900
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,958
I hate you.

1901
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:13,250
I really-really hate you. - But..

1902
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:17,250
I hate you, just go away. - Nayantara, listen to me.

1903
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,916
I don't want to meet you. Just go to America.

1904
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:23,916
Please.

1905
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:38,041
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

1906
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:43,750
"These days I've lost my heart."

1907
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:49,958
"It wishes to see you only."

1908
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:56,083
"It talks about you only."

1909
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:59,208
"Are you the one?"

1910
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:02,250
"Are you the same?"

1911
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:05,416
"Are you the one?"

1912
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:08,833
"Are you the same?"

1913
01:41:09,333 --> 01:41:14,791
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

1914
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:18,791
"These days I've lost my heart."

1915
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:41,458
"Okay, now where's everyone?"

1916
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:45,458
"Silly boy, where are you?"

1917
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:01,750
Sam!

1918
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,708
Sam!

1919
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:04,750
Sam, listen.

1920
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:06,416
Sam, I am sorry.

1921
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:10,708
I am really, really sorry. - Shut up.

1922
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,458
After all that all you have to say is 'sorry' to me.

1923
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:15,833
Wow, man.

1924
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:18,041
Everyone should have a best friend like you.

1925
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:19,250
Look, Sam.

1926
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,583
I always wanted to tell you..

1927
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:22,625
..about me and Nayantara.

1928
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:26,375
I tried but.. - But what?

1929
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,000
You were tongue-tied.

1930
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,291
Or you thought Sam's so stupid he'll never know.

1931
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:31,416
No.

1932
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:34,208
It's just that I brought it up at the wrong moment..

1933
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:35,250
I never got the chance.

1934
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,875
No, Sid. - And then everything had changed..

1935
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,333
..when I came back from the interview. Please.

1936
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:43,791
You had many opportunities, Sid. And you know it.

1937
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,916
Look.

1938
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:48,833
I made a big mistake not telling you.

1939
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,500
I am fine with any punishment you give me.

1940
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,833
Please.

1941
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:54,833
Please. Please. Please.

1942
01:42:55,333 --> 01:42:56,916
Sam, forgive me.

1943
01:42:57,416 --> 01:42:59,000
Please.

1944
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,291
I want us to stop being friends.

1945
01:43:02,791 --> 01:43:03,833
Look, Sam, you're angry.

1946
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:05,375
Don't breakup our 16 year old friendship for..

1947
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:08,375
You broke this 16 year old friendship, not me.

1948
01:43:08,875 --> 01:43:10,250
That too for a girl.

1949
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:11,916
That too for a girl. - Sam..

1950
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:14,250
I didn't know you were serious about her.

1951
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,166
I thought you would never like a girl like Nayantara.

1952
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:18,875
Why?

1953
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:21,458
Are girls like her meant only for you?

1954
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:23,416
No, try to understand.

1955
01:43:23,916 --> 01:43:26,625
You're my friend and she's my love.

1956
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:28,333
I was confused.

1957
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,750
"Love.. Friendship."

1958
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:35,083
These are just big words written in your diary.

1959
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:36,791
And you know nothing about them.

1960
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:39,041
Friendship's most important for me.

1961
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:40,625
I wouldn't have left her there..

1962
01:43:41,125 --> 01:43:41,666
..and come here otherwise. Please.

1963
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:43,416
Just shut up.

1964
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:46,125
Just shut up.

1965
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:52,333
You know what, for me love is dead. - No, Sam.

1966
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:56,125
For me...this friendship is dead. - No, Sam.

1967
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:58,458
I don't care about her anymore.

1968
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:01,750
And I don't care about you.

1969
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,791
You know what..

1970
01:44:04,291 --> 01:44:05,708
I am ashamed to call you a friend.

1971
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:08,916
I am ashamed to call you a Kasauli Cowboy.

1972
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:11,583
You broke the Cowboy rules.

1973
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:13,958
You broke the rules of friendship.

1974
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:18,000
Friendship isn't made of rules, Sam.

1975
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,708
Kasauli Cowboy!

1976
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:21,208
Cowboy rules!

1977
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,958
What's all this?

1978
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:26,000
Childish rules made by you, that's it.

1979
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,625
You want to stay God..

1980
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:29,833
..and the world follows your rules.

1981
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:33,791
But...I am sorry, that's not done. - Shut up.

1982
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:35,708
Try to look from other's point of view. - Shut up!

1983
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:37,666
Did you ever think I might love her?

1984
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:42,666
Did you? - Shut up, Sid.

1985
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:45,708
Thank God you're leaving, Sid.

1986
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:49,500
Just get out of my life, man.

1987
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,208
Yes, I am going.

1988
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:55,166
Even I want you out of my life forever.

1989
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:59,166
Go.

1990
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,708
Oh, stop!

1991
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:18,666
I want to meet Sam.

1992
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:22,666
Son Sam has warned you not to enter inside. You can't go in.

1993
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:32,125
I'll wait here.

1994
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:54,208
Sam! Sam!

1995
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:56,041
Sam was driving like a berserk.

1996
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:57,541
Amidst the rain and thunder..

1997
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:02,958
..he sped up towards Devil's Point.

1998
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:08,958
But then... he suddenly stopped the car.

1999
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,333
I didn't know what was going on in his mind.

2000
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:17,208
But I could see terror on his face.

2001
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:21,208
Sam! No!

2002
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,500
I saw my best friend die right before my eyes.

2003
01:47:12,916 --> 01:47:16,416
The fate was mocking our friendship.

2004
01:47:26,916 --> 01:47:35,458
Next day Sam and I, we both left Kasauli forever.

2005
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:39,458
You know...till now I haven't forgiven myself.

2006
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:48,083
That's why...I broke all ties with Kasauli and all of you.

2007
01:47:58,791 --> 01:48:03,000
That means... you did attend his funeral.

2008
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,458
Yes.

2009
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:09,166
I am sure even God must have forgiven you now.

2010
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:13,291
Forget it. - How can I?

2011
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:18,041
The other day I went to his house.

2012
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:21,666
It felt like all the walls were questioning me.

2013
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:26,458
"Where were you that night?"

2014
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:29,833
There were so many things he wanted to do.

2015
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:31,208
Visit Paris.

2016
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:33,541
Make a rock album.

2017
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:38,583
All...over. - Yeah.

2018
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:44,708
See. Only we three cowboys left now.

2019
01:48:45,208 --> 01:48:47,708
Sam...died.

2020
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:51,083
Bobby ran away. - Forget it.

2021
01:48:51,583 --> 01:48:53,208
Siddhu, stay in Chandigarh tonight.

2022
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:56,458
Yes. - No.

2023
01:48:56,958 --> 01:48:58,083
I've to go back.

2024
01:48:58,583 --> 01:49:01,541
I felt a strange peace meeting everyone that night.

2025
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:03,541
May be Nayantara was right.

2026
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:07,541
I should just forget the past and move on.

2027
01:49:12,166 --> 01:49:17,666
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2028
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:23,916
"These days, I've lost my heart."

2029
01:49:24,416 --> 01:49:30,875
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2030
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:32,375
Hello.

2031
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:35,791
Hello.

2032
01:49:36,291 --> 01:49:42,000
"It wants to see you."

2033
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:50,125
"It always talks about you."

2034
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:53,291
You did this?

2035
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:58,458
Well, someone said Kasauli's a dormant city.

2036
01:49:58,958 --> 01:49:59,708
Lazy people.

2037
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:01,625
Closed shops.

2038
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:06,583
And...the clock tower's watch too.

2039
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:13,625
And you...are trying to awaken this dormant city?

2040
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:17,625
No.

2041
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:28,458
If you want we... can walk together.

2042
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:32,458
Sure.

2043
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:41,375
Siddharth, there's something I wanted to say.

2044
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:42,958
I..

2045
01:50:43,458 --> 01:50:47,625
Whenever I see this place..

2046
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:51,958
..it feels like nothing has changed.

2047
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:55,541
I...I actually got engaged last year.

2048
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:59,541
It's an arranged marriage.

2049
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:03,500
You know...all these years..

2050
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,041
And you never..

2051
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:10,958
Anyway, see you.

2052
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:14,958
Nayantara.

2053
01:51:17,208 --> 01:51:20,333
That summer..

2054
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:23,000
I am sorry I ran out on you like that.

2055
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:23,958
Don't be, Siddharth.

2056
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:26,875
When two best friends love the same girl..

2057
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:30,958
..it's the girl who always loses.

2058
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:36,500
You never wrote or called me.

2059
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,958
Our paths are separate now, Siddharth.

2060
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:44,833
"It enters through your eyes."

2061
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:50,958
"Even if I call it, it doesn't return."

2062
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:58,291
"It's so nave, it tries to oppose the society."

2063
01:51:58,791 --> 01:52:00,333
Hi.

2064
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:02,958
Hi, Siddharth.

2065
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:07,291
Sorry for last night. - It's okay.

2066
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:11,416
Your behavior was justified.

2067
01:52:11,916 --> 01:52:17,375
But, Nayantara, I just wanted to tell you one thing.

2068
01:52:17,875 --> 01:52:20,916
What?

2069
01:52:21,416 --> 01:52:25,625
In these 12 years... I missed you every day.

2070
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:28,750
Every moment.

2071
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:34,625
These are few letters that I wrote to you.

2072
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:38,625
"These days, heart.."

2073
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:52,333
After meeting Nayantara, I realised what I have left behind.

2074
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:55,583
Maybe that's why I wanted to take..

2075
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:59,583
..all memories of Kasauli with me before going to America.

2076
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:16,500
Don't you think Bobby's different from us?

2077
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,250
You never judge friends, Siddi boy.

2078
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,416
Friends are like these guitar strings.

2079
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:23,541
Once the tuning's done.

2080
01:53:24,041 --> 01:53:25,458
Every string is important.

2081
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:29,458
See.

2082
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:50,625
Excuse me.

2083
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:53,375
Major. Balwinder Shekhawat. - Yes?

2084
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:57,875
I've something that belongs to you.

2085
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:00,666
Siddhu!

2086
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:03,750
Come on.

2087
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,875
How are you? - How are you?

2088
01:54:06,375 --> 01:54:07,416
I am fine.

2089
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:08,666
You look fit, Bobby.

2090
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:10,583
Nice.

2091
01:54:11,083 --> 01:54:14,916
Here. I think this belongs to you.

2092
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:16,666
Lighter.

2093
01:54:17,166 --> 01:54:17,708
Where did you find it?

2094
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:18,708
At the shed.

2095
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:20,291
Cowboy shed.

2096
01:54:20,791 --> 01:54:23,916
Do you remember? - I do.

2097
01:54:24,416 --> 01:54:25,916
But how did you find me?

2098
01:54:26,416 --> 01:54:28,500
You're a Kargil war hero.

2099
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:29,708
I typed your name..

2100
01:54:30,208 --> 01:54:30,875
..and it directed me to the Army site.

2101
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:33,250
And then here.

2102
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:38,458
Did you ever go back to Kasauli? - No.

2103
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:40,625
Since I ran away from Kasauli..

2104
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:42,041
..I've been running.

2105
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:45,625
First Delhi, then the defense academy.

2106
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:48,291
After that Kargil.

2107
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:50,291
You know, Siddhu.

2108
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:56,625
Whenever I look back... I think I was such a selfish.

2109
01:54:57,125 --> 01:55:00,250
I should've been there for her Aisha.

2110
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:01,833
I really want to say sorry to her.

2111
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:04,666
Whenever I meet her.

2112
01:55:05,166 --> 01:55:06,416
Don't worry.

2113
01:55:06,916 --> 01:55:08,125
Eventually we find a way, right.

2114
01:55:08,625 --> 01:55:09,666
Don't worry.

2115
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:12,333
Thank God Sam handled everything. - I know.

2116
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:14,958
You know Sam was the true hero.

2117
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:18,958
That he was.

2118
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,166
Sam was a hero to all of us.

2119
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:30,708
You know...maybe we Cowboys should meet in Kasuali.

2120
01:55:31,208 --> 01:55:34,708
'Sam would've done It had he been alive.'

2121
01:55:44,666 --> 01:55:46,166
Hello, Bunty. - Hello.

2122
01:55:46,666 --> 01:55:49,458
Sorry for calling at this late hour. - No, it's okay.

2123
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:50,625
Actually, I want to rethink my decision..

2124
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:54,000
..about selling this cottage.

2125
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,541
I know you've worked really hard.

2126
01:55:57,041 --> 01:56:00,541
Don't worry, I will definitely compensate you.

2127
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:13,791
Ma'am. - Yes.

2128
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:15,291
Someone here to see you.

2129
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:16,833
And you asked for this file. - Okay.

2130
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:20,833
Yes. - Thank you.

2131
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:27,791
Hi, Nayantara.

2132
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:30,541
All set to go back then?

2133
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:34,333
Yeah. Sort off.

2134
01:56:34,833 --> 01:56:39,833
You know...I feel that..

2135
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:45,458
..I'm being a bit hasty by doing this.

2136
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,083
Having second thoughts?

2137
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:48,875
Yeah.

2138
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:52,583
About everything.

2139
01:56:53,083 --> 01:56:56,333
I think I've fallen back in love with Kasauli.

2140
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:58,708
By the way, Siddhu.

2141
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:00,333
I got something for you.

2142
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:01,708
The other day you said that..

2143
01:57:02,208 --> 01:57:05,666
..you wish you could meet Sam's mom.

2144
01:57:06,166 --> 01:57:06,750
Here.

2145
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:09,625
Aunt Sherry's address.

2146
01:57:10,125 --> 01:57:11,916
But how?

2147
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:15,916
I've been trying so hard to find her.

2148
01:57:18,291 --> 01:57:21,791
Thank you, Nayantara.

2149
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:40,625
Siddhu sir.

2150
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:43,958
Hello, Bahadur.

2151
01:57:44,458 --> 01:57:47,583
Who is it? - Madam.

2152
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:52,416
It's Sam's friend Siddhu.

2153
01:57:52,916 --> 01:57:53,708
Hi, aunt.

2154
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:58,583
I was expecting you a lot earlier.

2155
01:57:59,083 --> 01:58:03,125
Come sit.

2156
01:58:03,625 --> 01:58:07,125
Thank you.

2157
01:58:12,708 --> 01:58:15,541
Actually, aunt... I was trying to meet you..

2158
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:18,958
..for a long time.

2159
01:58:19,458 --> 01:58:21,958
All these years I just wanted to tell you..

2160
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:25,625
..that I am sorry.

2161
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:29,625
I am really sorry.

2162
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:35,916
If I had stopped Sam that day, then maybe..

2163
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:39,041
Sam..

2164
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:43,041
Sam died because of me.

2165
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:48,583
So you don't know what happened that night?

2166
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:54,166
I still remember.

2167
01:58:54,666 --> 01:58:58,166
Sam came back home in a fit of rage.

2168
01:59:04,458 --> 01:59:07,958
Enough.

2169
01:59:09,875 --> 01:59:12,083
I hope that Sid burns in hell!

2170
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:13,208
Sam! - Bahadur.

2171
01:59:13,708 --> 01:59:15,916
Tell the watchman not to let Sid in.

2172
01:59:16,416 --> 01:59:19,000
Sam. Sam. Sam. - I hate that idiot.

2173
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:20,166
What has happened?

2174
01:59:20,666 --> 01:59:21,666
Sid's your best friend.

2175
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,416
He was, mama.

2176
01:59:23,916 --> 01:59:25,916
Best friends don't steal Each other's girlfriend.

2177
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:28,833
What?

2178
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:31,291
He was with Nayantara in the shed.

2179
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:33,125
He was sleeping with her, mama.

2180
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,208
Sam.

2181
01:59:35,708 --> 01:59:37,125
And when I confronted him..

2182
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:39,541
..he says they love each other.

2183
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:43,458
But she loves me, mama.

2184
01:59:43,958 --> 01:59:47,041
If Nayantara loves you..

2185
01:59:47,541 --> 01:59:51,416
..then why is she sleeping with Sid?

2186
01:59:51,916 --> 01:59:53,041
But I know she loves me.

2187
01:59:53,541 --> 01:59:56,750
Come. Sit down.

2188
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,041
That day she hugged me, mama.

2189
01:59:59,541 --> 02:00:03,041
We don't always get those we love.

2190
02:00:10,375 --> 02:00:13,333
I've been such a fool, mom.

2191
02:00:13,833 --> 02:00:14,625
'A love song.'

2192
02:00:15,125 --> 02:00:16,208
'It's just something I scribbled.'

2193
02:00:16,708 --> 02:00:17,708
'I wanted to tell you something important.'

2194
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:19,375
'About Nayantara.'

2195
02:00:19,875 --> 02:00:20,708
'Someone told me that..'

2196
02:00:21,208 --> 02:00:24,583
'..if I light a candle here I'll be blessed with true love.'

2197
02:00:25,083 --> 02:00:27,541
'So I just..'

2198
02:00:28,041 --> 02:00:28,916
'Nothing.'

2199
02:00:29,416 --> 02:00:32,916
'Happy birthday.'

2200
02:00:35,416 --> 02:00:38,916
I am the odd one out.

2201
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:47,833
Madam, you got a call from Delhi.

2202
02:01:09,583 --> 02:01:10,291
Bahadur. - Yes, Sam sir.

2203
02:01:10,791 --> 02:01:14,291
Get the gift. - Yes.

2204
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:16,458
Here you go.

2205
02:01:16,958 --> 02:01:18,333
Listen.

2206
02:01:18,833 --> 02:01:19,625
Yes.

2207
02:01:20,125 --> 02:01:22,125
I've to give this to Sid in The morning at the station. - Yes.

2208
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:24,666
Change the gift wrapping paper.

2209
02:01:25,166 --> 02:01:28,041
And slip this inside it. - Yes.

2210
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:32,041
Now go.

2211
02:01:34,583 --> 02:01:36,291
Sid you fool.

2212
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:37,291
Love you..

2213
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:39,583
Sherry, why don't you.. - Shut up, Abhijeet.

2214
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:41,625
You humiliated me.

2215
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:43,166
You cheated on me.

2216
02:01:43,666 --> 02:01:45,833
She called. She was trying to blackmail me.

2217
02:01:46,333 --> 02:01:47,958
She's demanding me money.

2218
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:50,791
I wish I knew what was going on.

2219
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:52,083
Look at your condition.

2220
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:53,791
Only when you get over your first husband..

2221
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:56,083
..you will know what's going on here.

2222
02:01:56,583 --> 02:01:58,708
Not just me, but no man can tolerate you.

2223
02:01:59,208 --> 02:02:00,000
Do you know that?

2224
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,166
All the time you're drunk.

2225
02:02:02,666 --> 02:02:06,291
You stink of booze all the time.

2226
02:02:06,791 --> 02:02:07,791
I stink? - Yes.

2227
02:02:08,291 --> 02:02:09,666
Office, home, bedroom, bed, everywhere..

2228
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:11,666
..you stink of booze.

2229
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:15,666
And you stink of that...

2230
02:02:16,166 --> 02:02:16,791
How dare you touch me?

2231
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:17,791
Don't touch.

2232
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:18,875
Don't touch me. - Why are you touching me?

2233
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:20,791
Don't touch her.

2234
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:21,791
Stay away from her.

2235
02:02:22,291 --> 02:02:22,750
Sam. Sam.

2236
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:23,833
Sam. Sam.

2237
02:02:24,333 --> 02:02:24,791
Sam...stay away.

2238
02:02:25,291 --> 02:02:25,750
Stay out.

2239
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:26,875
Stay out of this please.

2240
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:27,875
Why?

2241
02:02:28,375 --> 02:02:30,583
Why? Because this is my problem.

2242
02:02:31,083 --> 02:02:32,416
Mama, since the day You brought him home..

2243
02:02:32,916 --> 02:02:33,833
..he's become my problem too.

2244
02:02:34,333 --> 02:02:36,625
Sam...please, leave me alone.

2245
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:39,458
Didn't you hear? - You shut up!

2246
02:02:39,958 --> 02:02:40,708
Just go.

2247
02:02:41,208 --> 02:02:41,708
What did I say to you?

2248
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:45,041
Go. Just go. - No, mama.

2249
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:46,333
I won't go.

2250
02:02:46,833 --> 02:02:50,416
What will you do?

2251
02:02:50,916 --> 02:02:52,833
Do you know what Your problem is, mama?

2252
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:56,875
You always think about yourself.

2253
02:02:57,375 --> 02:03:01,250
You only see yourself.

2254
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:05,500
Have you ever thought about me?

2255
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,791
I've been alone since my childhood.

2256
02:03:11,291 --> 02:03:13,666
Father left when I was just six.

2257
02:03:14,166 --> 02:03:17,791
And instead of supporting me..

2258
02:03:18,291 --> 02:03:22,666
..you got married again.

2259
02:03:23,166 --> 02:03:26,583
You two distanced me from yourselves.

2260
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:32,666
First hostel, then college and then London.

2261
02:03:33,166 --> 02:03:36,791
And you especially wanted to keep me away.

2262
02:03:37,291 --> 02:03:38,416
Because I remind you of papa.

2263
02:03:38,916 --> 02:03:42,666
I remind you of papa.

2264
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:46,291
That's why you never wanted me.

2265
02:03:46,791 --> 02:03:50,166
Nobody's ever wanted me.

2266
02:03:50,666 --> 02:03:54,166
Nobody needs me.

2267
02:03:58,541 --> 02:04:02,041
Not even my friends anymore.

2268
02:04:07,666 --> 02:04:09,458
I am all alone, mama.

2269
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:13,458
I am all alone.

2270
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:19,041
And today when a girl broke my heart..

2271
02:04:19,541 --> 02:04:26,208
..instead of supporting or consoling me..

2272
02:04:26,708 --> 02:04:28,583
..you're pushing me away again.

2273
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:31,708
You're pushing me away.

2274
02:04:32,208 --> 02:04:35,708
You're pushing me away.

2275
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:40,208
You don't deserve a son.

2276
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:41,458
You don't deserve a son.

2277
02:04:41,958 --> 02:04:43,458
You don't deserve anyone.

2278
02:04:43,958 --> 02:04:44,708
You don't deserve anyone.

2279
02:04:45,208 --> 02:04:47,583
Yes, I don't deserve anyone.

2280
02:04:48,083 --> 02:04:49,583
I made a mistake, okay.

2281
02:04:50,083 --> 02:04:50,916
I am trying to fix it.

2282
02:04:51,416 --> 02:04:52,625
That's my mistake.

2283
02:04:53,125 --> 02:04:53,958
Mistake?

2284
02:04:54,458 --> 02:04:57,166
Every man in your life is a mistake.

2285
02:04:57,666 --> 02:04:58,208
Papa was a mistake.

2286
02:04:58,708 --> 02:05:00,833
Abhi is a mistake.

2287
02:05:01,333 --> 02:05:05,708
And I am the biggest mistake of your life, mama.

2288
02:05:06,208 --> 02:05:09,208
You're the biggest mistake of my life?

2289
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:11,541
You're saying this?

2290
02:05:12,041 --> 02:05:12,875
Get out.

2291
02:05:13,375 --> 02:05:14,375
Just get out.

2292
02:05:14,875 --> 02:05:15,708
Go away.

2293
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:17,666
I will, mama. - Yes.

2294
02:05:18,166 --> 02:05:20,083
I will go away from your life forever.

2295
02:05:20,583 --> 02:05:21,208
Then go away.

2296
02:05:21,708 --> 02:05:22,625
Sherry. - Why don't you go?

2297
02:05:23,125 --> 02:05:26,625
Let him go. - Just get out of my life.

2298
02:06:07,125 --> 02:06:10,125
'It's not you.'

2299
02:06:10,625 --> 02:06:11,666
'It's me.'

2300
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:15,375
'I killed my only son.'

2301
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:20,208
'That night when Sam needed me the most..'

2302
02:06:20,708 --> 02:06:24,708
'..I wasn't in my senses.'

2303
02:06:25,208 --> 02:06:33,000
You know...the heaviest body is that of your son's.

2304
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,500
I am so sorry, aunt.

2305
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,458
I am so sorry.

2306
02:06:37,958 --> 02:06:40,291
Your gift.

2307
02:06:40,791 --> 02:06:44,291
Bahadur's still kept it intact.

2308
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:50,333
Hey, Siddi boy.

2309
02:06:50,833 --> 02:06:53,041
So you're leaving Kasauli.

2310
02:06:53,541 --> 02:06:54,125
You're train must be about to leave..

2311
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:55,333
..and you must be wondering..

2312
02:06:55,833 --> 02:06:57,250
..what if Sam was here..

2313
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:58,750
Sam's there, brother.

2314
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:00,125
Sam's there.

2315
02:07:00,625 --> 02:07:02,333
For you, always.

2316
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:06,958
You will always be my favorite Kasauli Cowboy.

2317
02:07:07,458 --> 02:07:09,416
I am sorry for last night.

2318
02:07:09,916 --> 02:07:12,916
I should've seen that my best friend was in love.

2319
02:07:13,416 --> 02:07:15,708
Forgive me.

2320
02:07:16,208 --> 02:07:18,583
You two look beautiful together.

2321
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:21,458
Always stay together, okay?

2322
02:07:21,958 --> 02:07:24,875
And this jeans, it's your farewell gift.

2323
02:07:25,375 --> 02:07:28,875
Because our friendship is like this jeans.

2324
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:32,375
The older it gets, the better.

2325
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:34,625
I've also written a song inspired by this thought.

2326
02:07:35,125 --> 02:07:38,375
The words are mine... but you'll compose the tune.

2327
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:39,416
That's all, bro.

2328
02:07:39,916 --> 02:07:41,208
Oh, and remember Paris.

2329
02:07:41,708 --> 02:07:43,416
I will see you there with Morrison.

2330
02:07:43,916 --> 02:07:47,416
Friends Forever.

2331
02:07:51,833 --> 02:07:54,958
Sam has set me free today.

2332
02:07:55,458 --> 02:08:02,000
Not you...us.

2333
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:06,166
I love you.

2334
02:08:06,666 --> 02:08:10,166
I love you too.

2335
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:12,916
Everyone has to come, I don't care how.

2336
02:08:13,416 --> 02:08:14,416
It's a Cowboy's reunion.

2337
02:08:14,916 --> 02:08:18,416
This is for Sam.

2338
02:08:19,666 --> 02:08:27,166
"Only the fortunate find love and friends."

2339
02:08:27,666 --> 02:08:35,250
"We grow close and touch each others heart."

2340
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:43,125
"Knows every smile, every tear we shed.

2341
02:08:43,625 --> 02:08:50,166
"But one day they leave us alone."

2342
02:08:50,666 --> 02:08:58,083
"Only the fortunate find friends."

2343
02:08:58,583 --> 02:09:06,166
"Only the fortunate find friendship."

2344
02:09:06,666 --> 02:09:14,083
"Friendship is delicate."

2345
02:09:14,583 --> 02:09:18,083
"It's a merit earned by friends.

2346
02:09:31,708 --> 02:09:39,250
"When friendship brims in the eyes as tear."

2347
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:47,291
"Each drop forms a new story."

2348
02:09:47,791 --> 02:09:55,166
"In life we come across many kin."

2349
02:09:55,666 --> 02:10:02,166
"And also separate from our friends."

2350
02:10:02,666 --> 02:10:10,083
"Friendship makes your eyes wet."

2351
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:14,583
"This friendship.."

2352
02:10:15,083 --> 02:10:18,041
Finally, I fulfilled my last promise to Sam.

2353
02:10:18,541 --> 02:10:22,125
"Only the fortunate ones.."

2354
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:26,125
"..get friends."

2355
02:10:26,625 --> 02:10:30,125
"Only the fortunate ones get friendship in life."

2356
02:10:42,458 --> 02:10:44,625
Sam says Hello.

2357
02:10:45,125 --> 02:10:47,583
Now I understood the real meaning Of 'Purani Jeans' (old jeans).

2358
02:10:48,083 --> 02:10:50,083
In life we meet many friends.

2359
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:52,750
But old friends are like old jeans..

2360
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:56,458
..which lets you become free.

2361
02:10:56,958 --> 02:10:59,208
Free to be yourself.

2362
02:10:59,708 --> 02:11:03,208
"What's the meaning of distance?"

2363
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:07,291
"I ask myself."

2364
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:15,000
"Those who are far away, are they really far from me? "

2365
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:23,208
"This heart belongs to one who's rich by words."

2366
02:11:23,708 --> 02:11:30,208
"He's near, I'm still sitting quietly in the corner"

2367
02:11:30,708 --> 02:11:38,125
"Even disappointment breaks friendship."

2368
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:46,000
"Even break ups can lead us to befriend again."

2369
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:54,000
"Fortunate ones gets friendship in life."

2370
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:58,000
"Fortunate ones get eternal friends."

2371
02:12:13,375 --> 02:12:19,041
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2372
02:12:19,541 --> 02:12:25,208
"These days I've lost my heart."

2373
02:12:25,708 --> 02:12:31,333
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2374
02:12:31,833 --> 02:12:37,000
"These days I've lost my heart."

2375
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:43,250
"It wishes to see you only."

2376
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:49,416
"It talks about you only."

2377
02:12:49,916 --> 02:12:55,583
"Are you the one? Are you the same?"

2378
02:12:56,083 --> 02:13:02,166
"Are you the one? Are you the same?"

2379
02:13:02,666 --> 02:13:08,250
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2380
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:12,250
"These days I've lost my heart."

2381
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:32,291
"This is a new talent it has received from you."

2382
02:13:32,791 --> 02:13:38,541
"It meets everyone with smile."

2383
02:13:39,041 --> 02:13:44,625
"It awakens me in the middle of the nights."

2384
02:13:45,125 --> 02:13:50,875
"And asks me why the nights don't pass."

2385
02:13:51,375 --> 02:13:56,750
"It wishes to see you only."

2386
02:13:57,250 --> 02:14:03,250
"It talks about you only."

2387
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:06,333
"Are you the one?"

2388
02:14:06,833 --> 02:14:09,458
"Are you the same?"

2389
02:14:09,958 --> 02:14:12,041
"Are you the one?"

2390
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:15,958
"Are you the same?"

2391
02:14:16,458 --> 02:14:22,000
"These days my heart doesn't listen to me."

2392
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:25,125
"These days my heart.."
