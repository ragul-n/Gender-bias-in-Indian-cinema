1
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:31,208
'In Asia, situated in a corner of India.. '

2
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:37,416
'.. there is small village called Hadbahedi.'

3
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:47,166
 "Every grain of soil preaches.. "

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,333
 ".. that truth resides here."

5
00:01:53,708 --> 00:02:00,375
"Through the lanes of my land, oh, Mother.. "

6
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:08,041
 ".. the holiest of the yogis pass."

7
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:14,125
Hadbahedi is as mystical and as ideal a village as Shangri-La.

8
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,041
 The people here are always happy.

9
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,333
 There's only one grievance.

10
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,958
Outsiders consider our town to be a village.

11
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,583
Having electricity is the first condition in being called a town.

12
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:28,041
Look, we have electricity here. Right, Uncle?

13
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,333
 Yes, dear.

14
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,458
Though we have electricity for just 8 out of 24 hours.

15
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,125
 But at least we have electricity.

16
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,125
We just don't know when power comes.

17
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,916
 But Hadkam is trying.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,166
Someday, we will have electricity for all the 24 hours.

19
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,000
 Everything else is fine here.

20
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:51,833
"A lamp flickers amidst a storm." - "A lamp flickers."

21
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:58,875
"Somewhere the fire of hatred rages." - "The fire of hatred rages."

22
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,958
"Somewhere there is a tempest of injustice."

23
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:08,666
"Somewhere lies a dream, shattered."

24
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,958
Why has it stopped, Uncle? - Just a moment, dear.

25
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,458
Our machine has become very old, Fakirchand.

26
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,458
I have heard Triphala has installed a new one.

27
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,625
They are thieves. They sell tickets in black.

28
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,083
They don't pay money to the distributors.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,750
Don't worry. Someday, we will have a Dolby system here.

30
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,166
 But Hadkam is trying.

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,916
 Everything else is fine here.

32
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,125
 Greetings. I am Arun Bakshi.

33
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:45,375
 I am the editor of Hadbahedi Times.

34
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,291
Greetings, Arun. - Greetings, Ayesha.

35
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,125
 Our newspaper is a weekly one.

36
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,625
 But someday, it will be a daily.

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,500
We'll have correspondents in every corner of India.

38
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,083
 People here like to read.

39
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,958
 And they pay to read.

40
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,125
 Look.

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,750
 "We have no worries."

42
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,625
 "God is kind to our land."

43
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:19,250
 "Everything here is fine."

44
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,166
 "Everything is fine."

45
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,250
Trains from all directions arrive here.

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,041
From the north, the south, the east and the west.

47
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,125
 But only one halts here.

48
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
 Makhanjeet Express.

49
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:35,041
Someday even Shilajeet Express will halt here.

50
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,625
 But Hadkam is trying.

51
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
 Everything else is fine here.

52
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,208
 This is our airport.

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
 Not ours. Triphala's.

54
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,875
Triphala is 5km away. And Hadbahedi is just 4km away.

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,750
 But we send the jaggery.

56
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,250
 That too twice in a week.

57
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,041
Someday, we will own this airport. Just watch.

58
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,416
 But Hadkam is trying.

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,541
 "Everything here is fine."

60
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,000
 Hail Satyakam.

61
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,125
Friends, you all know that our Prime Minister..

62
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:18,375
.. has announced Bharat Nirmal Yojana (welfare scheme).

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,291
We have also found out that people of Triphala are plotting a ruse..

64
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:28,416
.. so that not we, but they reap the benefit of this program.

65
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,125
The people of Triphala are heard by all.

66
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,000
 Because it's a famous city.

67
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,208
 Just because of two personalities.

68
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,583
 One. Raj Malaya.

69
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,875
 He has many big liquor factories.

70
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,333
And second. Mr. Keshav Kanpatimaar. He has committed 13 murders.

71
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,208
And he's preparing to contest the elections from jail.

72
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,708
Because of these two people, Triphala has become famous.

73
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,291
 We don't mind it.

74
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,208
 And we don't want to be famous.

75
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,208
 We are content the way we are.

76
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,625
 Yes.

77
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,541
 I agree with you.

78
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,500
But its Hadkam's true brother Arun's dream..

79
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
 .. that people should know us.

80
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,166
Yes. I want the whole world to know you all.

81
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,041
Every person should have his own identity.

82
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,250
 How?

83
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,333
For this, we will have to use the advertisement principle.

84
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,541
 Advertisement?

85
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,125
Yes. Link your product with a famous personality.

86
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,666
 Your product will become famous.

87
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,333
Like undergarments became famous because of Sunny Deol.

88
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,916
Cold drinks because of Shah Rukh and Aamir.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,291
And God knows what all things have become famous..

90
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,500
 .. because of Amitabh Bachchan.

91
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,041
Like Jhansi because of Rani Laxmibai.

92
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,291
Dandi because of Gandhi's journey on foot.

93
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,791
And Pakistan's small village which became famous..

94
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:48,125
.. as it was the birthplace of our Prime Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh.

95
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,750
Gah. - Wow.

96
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,625
I wish a VIP had taken birth in our town.

97
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,208
He has. He has. A VIP has taken birth here too.

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,500
 Who? Who?

99
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,541
 He's in my bag.

100
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,916
 VIP in your bag? Come.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,041
Come. - Come quickly.

102
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,708
 Come. Come.

103
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,625
 Tell me. Tell me. Who is it?

104
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,041
Look. - Whose snap is this?

105
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,958
This is me. This is Mr. Kapoor. - Okay.

106
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:17,125
And she is his wife Krishna. - Who is in her arms?

107
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,416
Her son. I was the midwife. - His name?

108
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,500
 I named him Chintu.

109
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,708
 Chintu.

110
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,916
He is Raj Kapoor. - Raj Kapoor.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,458
Chintu Kapoor meaning Rishi Kapoor.

112
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,666
 Yes.

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,875
 He was born here.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,083
 Rishi Kapoor.

115
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,375
 Look. Look.

116
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,750
 In 1952, both husband and wife..

117
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,250
.. came to offer flowers at Satyakam's grave.

118
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,416
Incidentally, Krishna got labour pains.

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,375
Coincidently, your uncle and I were there at that time.

120
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,041
We quickly took them to the guest house.

121
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,041
 And there, Chintu was born.

122
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,166
 Friends, did you all hear?

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,541
Today, I will write an invitation letter to Chintu..

124
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,333
.. to quickly come to his place of birth.

125
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,500
 Hail Satyakam.

126
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,583
 This is too small.

127
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:35,333
 Hey. What was that. What went in.

128
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,625
 It's biting me.

129
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,125
 He is the real actor.

130
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,333
Help me out. What's this. It's biting me.

131
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,916
 Sir, it must be a wasp.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,375
 Jaggery is delivered by this plane.

133
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,583
 And the wasp is returned.

134
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,500
What insolence is this. - Sir, one minute.

135
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,000
 Sir, it flew away.

136
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,583
What? That wasp? - Yes, sir.

137
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,166
Stupid village and its lousy insects.

138
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,708
Devika, I am really scared of mosquitoes and insects.

139
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,958
 I don't like it.

140
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,583
I think.. Let's go back. Captain. - Sir.

141
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,958
If you want to enter politics, if you want to become an MP..

142
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,000
.. then you will have to bear some discomforts.

143
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,041
After all, this is your birthplace, sir.

144
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,000
 You are right.

145
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,500
 Now watch what I do.

146
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,041
 Heard the applause?

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
 Come on.

148
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,000
I am Arun Bakshi. Hadkam's general secretary.

149
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,333
She is our chairman. Kanta Mehta.

150
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,250
Greetings, sir. This is our committee.

151
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,666
Mr. Vashisht. - Greetings.

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,375
Mr. Atam. - Greetings.

153
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,208
Mr. Zaidi. - Greetings.

154
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,000
Mr. Chaudhary. - Brother Chaudhary.

155
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,833
 Fakirchand.

156
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,416
 Our treasurer Radheshyam.

157
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
Radheshyam. Wow. Wow. Radheshyam. Radheshyam.

158
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,250
 Oh, no.

159
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
 Wow. This is so romantic.

160
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,416
I am Arun Bakshi. You? - Devika.

161
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,875
Why did my parents have to come to this lousy place?

162
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,583
 Yes, sir. It is.

163
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,666
Kutti. - Yes.

164
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,291
Call up my home and say that I am returning tomorrow.

165
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,500
 Okay, sir.

166
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,708
 Relax, sir. Relax.

167
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,958
 Just remember one thing.

168
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,250
P. - What P now?

169
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,375
P for politics. And D for your dreams.

170
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,041
 And right now, just relax.

171
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,000
Sorry, sir. No network. - Then clean this mess.

172
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,708
Baby Chintu. My photo. What's going on?

173
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,666
 Thank you. Thank you.

174
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
 Thank you.

175
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,958
 Thank you. Thank you.

176
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,041
 Don't overdo it.

177
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,291
 Kutti. Enough. Kutti. Keep this.

178
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,750
 Sir. Sir.

179
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,500
 She is Shakuntala.

180
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
She is the oldest midwife of this place.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,333
She was present at the time of your birth.

182
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,041
 And she had kept your name.

183
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,541
 I see.

184
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,083
She is like a mother to you. Touch her feet.

185
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,750
Come on. Come on. Please. Please. Come on.

186
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,958
Sir. He is our mayor. And Kanta's husband.

187
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,125
 Shambunath Mehta.

188
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,041
Welcome. Welcome home, Chintuji (Chintu). Welcome.

189
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,291
 What is this, Chintuji?

190
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,750
 I don't understand.

191
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,083
My name is Rishi Kapoor. Call me Rishi Kapoor.

192
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,458
But Chintuji sounds so sweet. It sounds so nice.

193
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,000
Right? - Yes. Yes.

194
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,041
Chintuji. - Hail.

195
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,958
Chintuji. - Hail.

196
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,958
Chintuji. - Hail.

197
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,958
Come. Please come this way. Please. - Yes.

198
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,125
 Come. Come.

199
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,791
 Move. Move.

200
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,333
 Come. Please. Please.

201
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,416
 Sir, look.

202
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:42,125
This symbolises how great you are for us.

203
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,208
 Yes. Yes. Yes.

204
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,458
 Sir, press the button.

205
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,000
How high is Amitabh Bachchan's cut-out in U.P? - 25 feet.

206
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,166
And what about Rajnikanth's in Chennai? - 30 feet.

207
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,041
And this? - 35 feet, sir.

208
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,208
 Good. I like it.

209
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,583
Sir, say a few words to your people.

210
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,041
 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

211
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,041
 Ladies and gentlemen.

212
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,083
 Hindi.

213
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,083
 I don't understand what to say.

214
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,166
If I had my way then I would have been born in England.

215
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,375
 Hollywood.

216
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,375
But it was God's will. I was born here.

217
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,666
 Because he wanted your love.

218
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,041
 Yes. Yes.

219
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,166
Chintuji, recite a dialogue from your film.

220
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,041
Yes. Yes. - What dialogue should I recite?

221
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,166
 Please, Chintuji, dance.

222
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,625
 Dance? What's that?

223
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,375
It's done on the screen. Not like this.

224
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,500
VV. VV. - What VV?

225
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,166
 V for voters, sir. Please do it.

226
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,541
 Did you ever love somebody?

227
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,791
 Yes.

228
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,666
Did you ever give your heart to somebody?

229
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,250
 Yes.

230
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
 Me too.

231
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,333
 Did you too?

232
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:29,416
Oh, God. Are you a journalist or a romantic novelist?

233
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,625
 Both. Both.

234
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,958
 It's so hot here.

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,458
 It's so hot.

236
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,833
 Hey. Put this on the hanger.

237
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,958
 Don't you have an AC?

238
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,083
 Yes, sir. But there is no power.

239
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,458
Because a lot of blackouts take place here.

240
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,000
So, buy a generator. How do you people stay here?

241
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,625
 Sir, we are used to it now.

242
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,833
 I am not.

243
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,750
 Sir, try the okra.

244
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,458
I read in a magazine that you love okra.

245
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,541
 I hate okra and I hate everyone..

246
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,166
 .. who likes okra.

247
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,916
 Don't you have chicken?

248
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,333
Sorry, sir. We don't eat non-vegetarian.

249
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,750
And you don't serve it to guests too. Nonsense.

250
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,958
 Why are you kicking me?

251
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,833
 Sorry, sir. It happened by mistake.

252
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,583
Why are you people standing? Please sit.

253
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,125
 Eat your food.

254
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,833
 Can I have a cold drink? Please.

255
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,041
 Yes, sir.

256
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
 Thank you.

257
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,583
 Even your cold drink is not cold.

258
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,625
Sorry, sir. I have sent the guy to get ice. He will be here soon.

259
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,458
 Go find where Dinesh is.

260
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,958
I hope my lodging arrangement is not made here?

261
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,291
No, sir. You are staying at the guest house.

262
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,333
I want to leave right now, Devika. Kutti. Let's leave now.

263
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,541
 Thank you, gentlemen.

264
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,291
 Here.

265
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,291
 Oh, God. I can't endure the pain.

266
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,000
 Oh, my God.

267
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,416
 Someone get me a drink.

268
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,791
I want a bottle of whiskey at this time.

269
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,458
Mariamma. - Yes, sir.

270
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,291
Who was the one who dropped the ice?

271
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,666
 Call that idiot.

272
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,666
I have given the painkiller. He will be fine.

273
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,208
Mariamma? - Yes.

274
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,208
I am Kutti. - Where are you from?

275
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,625
I don't know Malayalam. I was born in Mumbai.

276
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,458
My father was his father's secretary.

277
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,875
And now I am his secretary. - I see. - Ok.

278
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,083
 Kutti.

279
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,500
 Don't worry. Chintuji is fine.

280
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,791
 Hail Satyakam.

281
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,958
Now, you will have to keep Chintuji here for a few days.

282
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,458
 With Satyakam's grace very soon..

283
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,791
.. he will be able to move around in a wheelchair.

284
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,416
 But he won't feel comfortable here.

285
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,291
 Guest house has all the facilities.

286
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,958
 I know. I know, Shambunath.

287
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,000
But he can suffer from spine injury, facture, anything.

288
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,166
After two days, I will get his x-ray done. And I will find out.

289
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
 I have to call at Chintuji's house.

290
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,375
Sorry. We don't have STD. But we will install it tomorrow.

291
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,166
There is a booth at the crossing. - What?

292
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,041
Booth. Booth. Telephone booth. I will show you.

293
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,375
 Come.

294
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,500
 Mariamma, look after the patient.

295
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,041
 No, no. You sit. Sit. Sit.

296
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,541
No problem. I will find out on my own.

297
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,041
 Hang on. I too will come with you.

298
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,083
Greetings. - Sit. Sit.

299
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,416
You sit. - Come. Come.

300
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,083
 Sit. Sit.

301
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,791
Will you have tea? - Surely.

302
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
 I will give it to her.

303
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,791
I am the inspector of this place. Lehra Singh.

304
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,458
 Greetings.

305
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,041
He is my colleague. Jaggi. - Greetings.

306
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,875
 How much for this?

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,416
What? Bear one thing in mind, Devika.

308
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,916
 As long as you are in Hadbahedi..

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,458
.. don't open your purse at all. - Thank you.

310
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,750
 Wow. Delicious tea.

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,250
 Everything here is good, Devika.

312
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,333
 If you stay here for a few days..

313
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,416
.. you will feel as if you belong to this place.

314
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
 Like Arun.

315
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,625
Is that so? You are not from this place?

316
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,875
So, how come you are here? Since when?

317
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,375
 It's a long story.

318
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,458
 Here.

319
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,625
Your town is great. You give free tea to customers.

320
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,708
 And police officers pay for it.

321
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,625
 This is God's and Satyakam's grace.

322
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,458
 You must not have observed.

323
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,625
People don't lock their doors here..

324
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,041
.. because there are no robbers here.

325
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,541
 So, why are you people here?

326
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,791
 We? Just like that.

327
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,041
Hang on, sir. I will just come. - Okay.

328
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,708
 Hello. Greetings.

329
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,541
 Everything is fine here.

330
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,916
Did you hear? They just have to do this task.

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,791
Dawn and dusk, they have to inform their seniors..

332
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,958
 That everything is fine here.

333
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,083
 It's such a beautiful place, Kutti.

334
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,500
And what's great is that police officers pay for things here.

335
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,791
 Yes.

336
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,333
Chintuji's family members must be worried..

337
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,666
 .. after hearing about his accident.

338
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,666
 Why to worry when I am there, madam?

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
Neetu madam said, "Kutti, you handle everything."

340
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,041
"We are going to Switzerland for two weeks."

341
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:08,166
I said, "No problem. Go without any worry. I am there."

342
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't tell Chintuji about this Switzerland thing.

343
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,333
 Arun, here. Your flask of tea.

344
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,166
 Thank you. I will leave now.

345
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,166
See you tomorrow. - Okay.

346
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,583
 Here. Check and mate.

347
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,041
What fate? - Not fate, mate.

348
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,541
 Sir.

349
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,708
 My name is Gajendar Singh Chauhan.

350
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,916
Last week, I was transferred from Delhi to Triphala.

351
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,666
I heard that Rishi Kapoor has come here. - Yes.

352
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,125
 He slipped. He is badly injured.

353
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,500
 Oh. So sad.

354
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,625
 I am a big fan of his.

355
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,583
No problem. I will come some other time.

356
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,875
 Sir, have some tea.

357
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,583
No, no. Some other day. Some other day.

358
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,000
Who was the guy who just left on a bike?

359
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,666
 I think I have seen him somewhere.

360
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,500
He is our newspaper editor. Arun Bakshi.

361
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,458
 I see. I will leave.

362
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,041
 We have to be alert. For Arun.

363
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,208
 Yes. Yes.

364
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,625
 Is somebody there? Hello.

365
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,250
Sir. - Who's singing my song so badly?

366
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,416
 Stop him. Nonsense.

367
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,625
 You want tea, sir?

368
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,291
I will sleep for another hour. Bring tea later.

369
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,166
And breakfast? - I will have eggs for breakfast.

370
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,125
And listen. - Yes, sir.

371
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,750
For lunch, arrange for country rooster. Country rooster.

372
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,416
 Egg? Chicken?

373
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,791
 It will spoil our religion, Kanta.

374
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,125
Refuse him outright. All this is not allowed here.

375
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,500
He is our guest, dear. And guest is akin to God.

376
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,750
Guest is God. Did you forget? This too is our duty.

377
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,250
Yes. But.. - That's it.

378
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:08,166
 Be strong. And listen, you go.

379
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,416
 Cook whatever food he wants.

380
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,333
To atone for this, starting from today..

381
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,000
 .. I will fast for three days.

382
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,083
If you fast.. then I too will fast.

383
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,125
I too will fast. - Me too.

384
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,833
Hi. - Hi.

385
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,041
Shall we? - Yes.

386
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,166
In Karz (movie), Chintuji strummed the guitar so well.

387
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,958
Fabulous. - Fabulous.

388
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,500
 Arun, listen. Arun.

389
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,500
I will meet you later. I'm in a hurry.

390
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,250
Seeing the city girl, he forgot his friends.

391
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,500
He is gone. - Yes.

392
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,958
So, where are you from? - Why?

393
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,375
No. Vashisht was saying you are not from this place.

394
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,291
 Yes. I said it's a long story.

395
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,291
 Hear it some other day.

396
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,666
Where are you from? And what's your relationship with Chintuji?

397
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,791
It's a long story. Hear it some other day.

398
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,208
 Clich�.

399
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,166
Jokes apart. I work in a PR agency.

400
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,500
Chintuji has hired me. - I see.

401
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,458
He wants to enter politics. He wants to be an MP.

402
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,416
And I am writing his biography too. That's it.

403
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,416
 That's very good. And why not?

404
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
When so many film stars have entered politics..

405
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,708
 .. are writing their biography..

406
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:31,958
 .. then why not Chintuji?

407
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,083
 Here, he will win unopposed.

408
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,416
In fact, this could be his launching pad.

409
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,125
Exactly. That's what I said when I read the invitation.

410
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,791
 I think with Satyakam's grace..

411
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,041
.. all dreams of Hadbahedi will come true.

412
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,416
 Who was Satyakam?

413
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,333
A true saint. He established this town.

414
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,333
 Around 300 years ago.

415
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,916
 He had two disciples.

416
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,875
 Devpriya and Satyake.

417
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,666
 Devpriya was jealous of Satyake.

418
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,291
 Because he was dearer to the guru.

419
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,666
 Once Devpriya rebelled.

420
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,625
And he went to another village from here.

421
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,041
 And he named it Triphala.

422
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,666
 Triphala became very rich.

423
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,416
But through lies, deceit and dishonesty.

424
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,166
But Hadbahedi never left Satyakam's path of..

425
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,375
.. truth, non-violence, love and honesty.

426
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,458
The grave of both guru and disciple rests here.

427
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:24,166
And it's a pilgrimage centre for us.

428
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,166
Can we go there? - Yes. Definitely.

429
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,708
But be prepared to come back. - What do you mean?

430
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,958
 I mean whoever goes there once..

431
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,083
 .. always comes back.

432
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,541
Once I went there with my parents when I was a kid.

433
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,166
 And my destiny brought me back.

434
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,291
Greetings. - God bless you.

435
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,791
Greetings. - Greetings.

436
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,250
Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings.

437
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,250
You people don't eat non-vegetarian.

438
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:07,666
So, I have told my wife. She will cook it daily.

439
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,250
 And Ayesha will deliver it here.

440
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,208
 Thank you. Thank you, sir.

441
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,541
 What's in your hand?

442
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,125
 Ayesha and Dinesh are with me.

443
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,791
 Not with you, Father. In your hand.

444
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,958
In my hand. Oh, my God. Telegram. - Oh.

445
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:23,041
For Chintuji. From distant places.

446
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,875
From England, America. - Is it?

447
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,083
Wow. Our town is becoming world famous.

448
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,583
No, no. This is a wrong number. Mehta doesn't stay here.

449
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:37,125
Oh, my God. - Don't call again. Thank you.

450
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,333
 Here.

451
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,500
Why is this AC not working whereas this useless fan is working?

452
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,750
Fan and cordless phone are connected to the inverter.

453
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,291
 That's why they are working, sir.

454
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,916
 Now quickly switch on the AC..

455
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
.. otherwise I will smash your head with this flower vase.

456
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,583
Did you hear? - What?

457
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,458
What is he asking for? Egg? - Not eggs. AC.

458
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,000
Indian eggs. All our hens are Indian.

459
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,458
 We don't like foreign brands.

460
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,666
AC. As there is no power, the AC is not working.

461
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,750
I see. AC. Why didn't you tell me before?

462
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,125
 I will do something.

463
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,208
 Switch it on. It's so hot.

464
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,375
What's going on? Why is Chintuji yelling so much?

465
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,333
Devika, there are many reasons. Which one do I tell you?

466
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,625
 Fine. I will check out.

467
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,708
Sir. Sir. You have raised a commotion here.

468
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,208
I couldn't even take a bath properly.

469
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,750
Sit here and take a bath with sweat.

470
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,125
 Please change the cloth.

471
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,750
You got unnerved by such a small thing.

472
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,375
Look at other Ps. What all things they do for V.

473
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,416
To hell with your P and V. I am fed up of this.

474
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,666
 Kutti.

475
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,875
 Yes, sir.

476
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,166
Are you Kutti? - No, sir.

477
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,541
Then why did you come? Shall I pick up the flower vase?

478
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,833
No. - Kutti.

479
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,291
Yes, sir. - Quickly charter the plane by which we came here.

480
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,291
My family members must be so tense for me.

481
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,583
 They must be missing me so much.

482
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,750
 No, sir. They have gone to Swit..

483
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,166
What? - They have gone to Shirdi, sir.

484
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,583
To pray for you. - Really?

485
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,750
I will just inquire about the plane. Come, Mariamma.

486
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,000
 Beware.

487
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,500
 Thank God.

488
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,250
 Thank God.

489
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,666
 Thank God.

490
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,666
 Don't cry. Don't cry.

491
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,791
How can I stop crying? Uncle, I have committed a sin.

492
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,375
 This is government electricity.

493
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,083
 I have given an illegal connection.

494
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:20,416
But it's for a guest. And a guest is a messiah.

495
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,333
 Even I am the culprit, dear.

496
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,416
You fast for three days. I too will fast.

497
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:29,166
 He'll forgive us.

498
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,500
 Here, Mr. Verma.

499
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:35,750
All people of Hadbahedi have signed on this letter.

500
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,458
You can cut electricity from our houses.

501
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:41,041
But continue with Chintuji's supply.

502
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,291
 He is really in trouble.

503
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,791
 Look, I can understand his problem.

504
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:51,208
But our transformer is very small for a supply of 24 hours.

505
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,250
 I will have to talk to my seniors.

506
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,333
Do something, Mr. Verma. Hadbahedi's reputation is at stake.

507
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:01,083
Even our department's reputation is at stake, Mr. Chaudhary.

508
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,083
 I will talk to my chief.

509
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,416
 Congratulations. Congratulations.

510
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,500
 My chief is Chintuji's fan.

511
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:29,083
And he is ready to give a big transformer to Hadbahedi.

512
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,750
 5.

513
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:36,458
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

514
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,125
5 is there, sir. - 5 is here.

515
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,791
Sir, here. - Here.

516
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,666
Here. - Count from here. 5 is here.

517
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,958
 Sir.

518
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,125
Kutti. - Sir.

519
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,416
Who is right? - I think she is right, sir.

520
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,625
 Shut up.

521
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,125
 Who gives you salary? She or me?

522
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,041
 Oh, God. He cheats.

523
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,500
 Don't talk like that.

524
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,666
 Yes. Come in.

525
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,666
 Yes.

526
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,041
Sir, Mr. Malkani's call from Mumbai.

527
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,708
Malkani. Get the phone. Malkani. Of course. Of course.

528
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,333
Sir. - Thank you. Thank you.

529
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,041
 Go. Come on, out.

530
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:11,875
Malkani, how are you? My plight is really bad.

531
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,208
 I know, Chintuji. But don't worry.

532
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,750
 I am reaching there soon.

533
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,750
Really? When? - As soon as possible.

534
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,541
Get me out of here. I am lying on the bed.

535
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,958
 I am feeling choked.

536
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:26,250
I will get you out. I am there. Okay. Bye.

537
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,458
 Hang on. Hang on.

538
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,375
 Bring my clothes from my home.

539
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,500
 And my other luggage too. Got it?

540
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,708
 Here, you don't get that stuff.

541
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,541
 Yes. I will collect it. Okay.

542
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,041
 I love you, darling.

543
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,333
 I love you too, Chintuji. Bye.

544
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:44,000
 Get lost. I love you too.

545
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,333
 Selfish fellow.

546
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:49,541
Manish. Get two crates. From Ulhasnagar.

547
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:55,250
Because of this man, because of this man, my film is stuck.

548
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,958
And he is lying comfortably on the bed.

549
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,125
Aman. Do one thing. Change the script.

550
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,291
Chintuji should be lying on the bed. Death scene. Finish him off.

551
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,583
 What are you saying?

552
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,750
Mr. Malkani, I am in this film industry for the past 40 years.

553
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,375
 I have written 17 hit films.

554
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,416
I have won three Filmfare and two National awards.

555
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,750
And you are telling me to ruin the script.

556
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,250
 You settle Aman's account.

557
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,083
 And Manish, you call Mr. Bhatt.

558
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,291
He will change any scene into a death scene in two minutes.

559
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,500
 Yes, sir.

560
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,125
Look, I have no objection with the death scene.

561
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,000
But if we add action or suspense..

562
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,041
 .. then the scene will be a hit.

563
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,416
 Tell me. Shall I add it?

564
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,666
 Add anything. Everything will do.

565
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,416
My film's budget has exceeded the limit.

566
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,333
And the release date is fast approaching.

567
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,416
And this man has chosen such an accident location..

568
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,875
.. which is in some Godforsaken place.

569
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:41,458
 Yes. I found it. Look.

570
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,541
Yes. It's there. Quickly find out which flights go there.

571
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,083
Sir, there is only one flight. It goes there twice a week.

572
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,958
But it won't be able to fly for the next 10-12 days.

573
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,541
Because their plane is not functioning properly.

574
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,750
 Train?

575
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,083
Sir, there is one passenger train. - Okay.

576
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,166
It takes 46 hours. Provided the train is on time.

577
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,041
 Fine. Book my ticket for today.

578
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,875
And after two days, book the entire unit's ticket.

579
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,666
 Sir, we are like family.

580
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,625
But junior artists won't be ready to travel by passenger train.

581
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,208
 Their association is very strong.

582
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,791
 Menaka too won't give her consent.

583
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,041
 She has too much attitude.

584
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,375
 So? What can be done?

585
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,583
 Sir, there is one solution.

586
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,083
 What? Tell me. Tell me.

587
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,958
What. Who is that superman? Find him.

588
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,416
There is he, sir. Shall I call him?

589
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,750
 Yes.

590
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,375
 No. It's fine. It's fine.

591
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
My assistant was telling me that you can stop any train anywhere.

592
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes, sir. Provided you give me a role in your film.

593
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,708
 Sir, I have received training.

594
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,041
 To stop train?

595
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,958
No, sir. In acting. Look. My portfolio.

596
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:47,000
To hell with the portfolio. You tell me.

597
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,416
How can you stop any train anywhere?

598
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,208
 Sir, by telling my brother-in-law.

599
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,541
 He is the railway minister, sir.

600
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,958
Railway minister? - Yes, sir.

601
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,041
What's your name? - Paplu Yadhav.

602
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:04,166
You are such a talented man. Where were you till now?

603
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,375
 I was here, sir.

604
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,666
Sir, I have been trying to meet you since the past two years.

605
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,625
 No problem. No problem.

606
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:13,083
I am so sorry, dear. But it's never too late.

607
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,083
 Aman, find a nice subject for him.

608
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,750
I have one. A great subject. With two heroes.

609
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,041
Train to Afghanistan. Shall I narrate it?

610
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,208
 No. You do one thing.

611
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,791
For the moment, concentrate on the scene..

612
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,000
 .. which we have to shoot there.

613
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,375
Hadbadi. Hadbadi. What's the name of the place?

614
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,625
 Hadbahedi.

615
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,541
 Weekly Hadbahedi Times. - Yes, sir.

616
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,750
What's its circulation? - Sir, enough.

617
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:41,416
Besides Triphala, it's read in some 65 villages and small islands.

618
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,791
 Do you use good quality paper?

619
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,541
How will you print my photo in this?

620
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,541
What do you say? You should use.. glossy.

621
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,791
 Pardon me, sir.

622
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,500
I know what kind of useless things..

623
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,041
.. are printed in glossy newspapers.

624
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,041
As it is, sir, paper's quality is assessed..

625
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,375
 .. by the matter printed in it.

626
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,666
I'm sorry, I won't give an interview in this.

627
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,041
 This is all rubbish.

628
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,750
 Well done, Chintuji. Well done.

629
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,000
 What happened?

630
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,916
This is not a newspaper. It's your vote.

631
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,333
 You are throwing it away.

632
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,458
 Shave my beard.

633
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,583
 Arun. Arun.

634
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,708
 Stop, Arun. Listen. Arun.

635
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,083
A cup of tea please. - In a moment, sir.

636
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,250
I think you are coming from a distant place.

637
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,625
 From Delhi.

638
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,416
 Are you a journalist?

639
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,041
Not of a useless newspaper like this.

640
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:10,458
 But of a famous newspaper.

641
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,166
I have come to cover all of Rishi Kapoor's news.

642
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,208
 Where did he break his leg?

643
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:21,041
No, he didn't break his leg. But he needs rest.

644
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,375
It's a small injury. - Sir, tea.

645
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,000
 Will I get a cheap place to stay?

646
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,958
 Yes. Public inn.

647
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,583
You can stay for free for three days.

648
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,000
 And later, pay Rs.5 daily.

649
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,625
 Is that so? So cheap?

650
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,583
Where is the inn? - Inn?

651
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,041
 Bar.

652
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,916
 Here, you won't get any intoxicant.

653
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,625
 Besides this tea.

654
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,041
Is that so? Where will I get it? - Triphala.

655
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,166
Are you from another city? - Yes. Delhi.

656
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,375
What are you doing here in Triphala?

657
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,500
I had come to Hadbahedi. To interview Rishi Kapoor.

658
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:13,041
But you don't get liquor there. So, I came here.

659
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,791
I see. You are a journalist. - Yes.

660
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,458
 Then you are useful to me.

661
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,333
Pratap, get chicken for sir. - Yes, sir.

662
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,875
Vidyasagar. - Chauhan.

663
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,375
One for you. And one for your guest.

664
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,041
Will you do me a favour, Vidyasagar?

665
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,625
 Not just one. I will do five.

666
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,333
 There is a man in Hadbahedi.

667
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,208
 I want all information about him.

668
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,208
 You will get it.

669
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:55,083
 But what will I get?

670
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,833
 A lot. Start the work first.

671
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,583
 Fine. Who is he?

672
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,041
 Arun.

673
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,625
 Come on. Come on.

674
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,250
 Arun.

675
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,125
 Arun.

676
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,458
 What happened?

677
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,125
 Are you badly hurt?

678
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,791
He is badly hurt. Come. - Let's go.

679
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,083
Come - No. - Sit down. - I don't want to sit. I am fine.

680
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,041
You have hurt your head. - Brother, water.

681
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,333
 Have some water.

682
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,750
 Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

683
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,916
 You got hurt because of me.

684
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,791
No, it's okay. It's a small injury.

685
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:50,291
I came here to apologize. For Chintuji's misbehaviour.

686
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,791
Don't take that man's name. He is a pain in the neck.

687
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,416
Mind your tongue. Chintuji is our guest. Apologise.

688
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,625
 Yes. Apologise.

689
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,333
 Okay. Okay. I am sorry, Devika.

690
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,666
 Actually, he is from another town.

691
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,625
He has still not become a Hadbahedi native yet.

692
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,791
Chintuji, listen. Very confidential.

693
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,041
 What?

694
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,541
I've a long time dream that I should become a film writer.

695
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,166
Film writer? - Yes.

696
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,833
I became a doctor because of my parents. I have already written one.

697
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,833
 Wait a minute. Let me check.

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What a coincidence. The script is in my bag.

699
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,041
Is this the script? Or the telephone directory?

700
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,083
 It is my 30 years of hard work.

701
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,625
It has everything. Action. Emotion. Drama.

702
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,041
Physical intimacy? - I'll add it.

703
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,000
 Will you listen to it?

704
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,750
I'll have to create the mood to read a film script.

705
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,000
 How?

706
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,958
 It is done.. with some alcohol.

707
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,541
 Oh, God. What am I listening to?

708
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,708
No. You don't get liquor in Hadbahedi.

709
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,166
 It is impossible.

710
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:56,625
All right. Then you'll have to wait longer.

711
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,458
Tomorrow, I'll try to meet Rishi Kapoor for an interview.

712
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,750
And yes, tomorrow, I'll email some photos from Triphala.

713
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,000
 For the next sessions.

714
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,291
I'll also send a photograph of a man.

715
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,375
You get it checked with other newspapers.

716
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,500
 I think there is something wrong.

717
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,958
 I've seen him somewhere.

718
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,125
 Okay? Okay, bye.

719
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,666
 I heard each word of Vidyasagar's.

720
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,375
 He was talking in a low voice.

721
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,416
He was sending Arun's photograph from Triphala.

722
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,416
 This man is very dangerous.

723
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,041
Yes. If Arun's secret is out then Hadbahedi's progress will stop.

724
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:56,041
 Don't worry at all.

725
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,041
 I've a very good cure for it.

726
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,291
 What?

727
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,375
I'll tell you. But everybody will have to repent for it.

728
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:09,083
 Three days of fast without water.

729
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,250
 Oh, it's that type of work? - Yes.

730
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,166
 All right. Tell us.

731
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,375
Look there. Look there. What a thing.

732
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,500
 What is it?

733
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,375
 You look so funny.

734
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,750
 Oh, I wasn't prepared.

735
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,166
Tea? - Thank you.

736
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,041
 What are you looking at?

737
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,041
Why do you wear a sad look all the time?

738
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,083
 No. Nothing of that sort.

739
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,125
 Come on. Tell me your story.

740
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,541
 Under the pretext of tea.

741
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:31,166
"Let's call out to life once again."

742
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:38,958
"Let's spend some moments together."

743
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,791
 "Under the pretext of tea."

744
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,208
 "Under the pretext of tea."

745
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:50,125
 "Under the pretext of tea."

746
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,750
 "Under the pretext of tea."

747
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:14,458
"Where have those sweet talks disappeared?"

748
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:20,125
 "Lovely days, lovely nights."

749
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:28,250
 "All those old topics."

750
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:34,208
 "All those lovely joyous moments."

751
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:41,500
"The childhood at the banks of a river."

752
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:49,416
"The serene moments spent together."

753
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,083
 "Under the pretext of tea."

754
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:57,000
 "Under the pretext of tea."

755
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,541
 "Under the pretext of tea."

756
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:04,458
 "Under the pretext of tea."

757
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,458
 "Consider me your own."

758
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:40,250
 "Call me close to you."

759
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:46,541
"Let's spend some moments together."

760
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,541
 "Consider me as yours."

761
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,500
 "Call me close to you."

762
00:43:55,583 --> 00:44:01,041
"Let's spend some moments together."

763
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,875
 "These clouds and the rains."

764
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,041
 "The waves of the river."

765
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:14,541
 "All are pointing towards us."

766
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:22,333
"Come, let's cherish these moments."

767
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:29,875
"Let's spend some moments together."

768
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:34,041
 "Under the pretext of tea."

769
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,416
 "Under the pretext of tea."

770
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,208
 "Under the pretext of tea."

771
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:44,875
 "Under the pretext of tea."

772
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:50,250
Chintuji, I brought a bottle for you with a lot of difficulty.

773
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:54,625
Oh, God. - You we going to lose your 30 years of hard work.

774
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,750
Yes. My assistant brought it from the next village.

775
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,333
 Okay. Okay.

776
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:05,000
There is some form of alcohol in allopathic medicine.

777
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,000
So, I'm giving you this alcohol as medicine.

778
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,500
 What's this? Put some more.

779
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:10,708
 Give me a double dose.

780
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,500
So small a peg. - Ok. Here.

781
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,583
 Cheers.

782
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,291
 Oh. It has a horrible stench.

783
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,083
Whatever it is. Something is better than nothing.

784
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,583
 That's very true. Cheers.

785
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:26,125
 So, now, I'll begin. Okay?

786
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:30,833
 Chintuji.

787
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,833
 Please.

788
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:37,208
 Our film starts at Shantiniketan.

789
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,458
 A big tree.

790
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,458
What? - Tree.

791
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,666
Below it.. Mr. Khokon. - Mr. Khokon?

792
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,708
 I mean my hero.

793
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:54,208
He is sitting. And Labonya is sitting in front of him.

794
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,291
Labonya? - The heroine. - Yes.

795
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,083
 Now, they sing a song together.

796
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,916
 Very sweet song.

797
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:11,666
"There was desire. There was love."

798
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,583
 Now, Labonya sings..

799
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,916
"There was desire. There was love."

800
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,125
 What's that band for?

801
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,541
My friend's daughter's marriage. - Yes.

802
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,833
 I didn't go. I sacrificed for you.

803
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,250
 Wonderful.

804
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,458
 The song, okay?

805
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:48,583
 "There was desire. There was love."

806
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:54,291
 "There was desire. There was love."

807
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,458
 Hey, stop the band. Please.

808
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,375
 Stop the band.

809
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,500
 Chintuji is getting disturbed.

810
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,500
Hey, Brother, stop the band. Stop it.

811
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:22,875
 Khokon, I want to live. Khokon.

812
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:29,250
I'm going away. I'm going away. Labonya.

813
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,500
 You marry someone else.

814
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,666
 I'm going away.

815
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,000
No. This cannot happen, cannot happen at all.

816
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:46,750
Khokon. Khokon. The gift of our love.

817
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:52,708
 What will happen to our child?

818
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:01,041
Father. - O dear!

819
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,750
 Khokon, this cannot happen.

820
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:09,291
Our Shantiniketan. Our songs under the tree.

821
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,708
 What will happen to all that?

822
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:16,208
 Khokon. Khokon.

823
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:25,083
 Stop your tragedy now. Please.

824
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:31,583
Chintuji. - He's here?

825
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,375
 He's here.

826
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:41,750
Yes, it is very tragic. Very tragic.

827
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,750
We pushed it for so long. How much further?

828
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,375
 When will it start?

829
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,208
 Push it.

830
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,500
Sister. - Yes.

831
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,333
 Just sniff it.

832
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,250
 72 hours, 45 minutes 31 seconds.

833
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:55,041
 But finally, we reached.

834
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,666
 How much?

835
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,416
No. Sir, how can I take money from you?

836
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,666
 Why?

837
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,625
You are Chintuji's guest. Hence, our guest too.

838
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,416
 Brother, what's your name?

839
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,333
 Antoine.

840
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:08,750
 Antoine Pandey.

841
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,583
Antoine was a famous film director from Italy.

842
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:14,333
 Yes. Once he came to India.

843
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,166
My father drove him around on his rickshaw.

844
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,625
After that, I have you as my passenger.

845
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:21,208
Wow. After Antoine, the next director is Mr. Malkani.

846
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:26,416
Brother, I'd surely thank you in the credit list of my film.

847
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,250
Because this is my film's biggest saving.

848
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:32,041
And this is also the biggest honour. Thank you.

849
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:34,500
 Come on, Manish. Come.

850
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,625
It seems the good days have dawned on us.

851
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,916
Only that Chintuji shouldn't find out that the whiskey is a fake.

852
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,250
Come on. I've given it to many of them.

853
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,250
 After drinking the fakes..

854
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,708
.. I've forgotten the taste of real ones.

855
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,041
Yes. - Mr. Malkani. - Yes.

856
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,541
 Now, my back is somewhat better.

857
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,291
I can travel now. Now, take me away from here.

858
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,791
 No, Chintuji, not at all now.

859
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,708
Why? - I've to complete my film.

860
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:06,916
So, are you here for shooting the film?

861
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,666
Yes, the unit will come within two days.

862
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,000
 You never told me.

863
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,000
But I've just one problem. - What?

864
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,250
 I don't have extras.

865
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,166
That's no problem. I'll arrange for you.

866
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,500
So, how much will I have to pay for it?

867
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,666
Everything is free. My boss has mesmerised everybody here.

868
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,666
Oh, free? - Like the rickshaw driver.

869
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,041
 Then order double extras.

870
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,083
But the savings that you have here..

871
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:28,125
50 percent will go to Chintuji. Who else.

872
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,083
I'll leave now, Chintuji. I've to find a location. - Okay.

873
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:34,041
Let's find a free stay soon. Or it will be night.

874
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,333
 Dr. Ghoshal.

875
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:37,708
Dr. Ghoshal, he is our director Dr. Malkani.

876
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:40,250
 Mr. Malkani, he is writer Ghoshal.

877
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,583
He has written a great script. You must listen to it.

878
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,666
 Sure. Sure.

879
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,833
One can chance upon diamonds amidst glass, like our Paplu Yadhav.

880
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,208
 I'll meet you later sir, okay?

881
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,416
Bye. - Ok, goodnight.

882
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,625
 Ok, bye. Come on.

883
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,833
 Brother. Brother.

884
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,041
 Good news. Good news.

885
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,541
 Is this good news for you?

886
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,500
You'll sit on a wheelchair tomorrow morning.

887
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,166
You can steer this wheelchair so well?

888
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,958
Sir, you steered it so well in the film Chandni.

889
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,208
 Good morning, sir.

890
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:09,375
Sir, you look so well in this chair. Beautiful, sir.

891
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,500
 Wait a minute.

892
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:12,250
Yes, sir. - Where are you going?

893
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,541
 To my office.

894
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,791
 Where are you going from?

895
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,333
 From this door, sir.

896
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:21,166
No. As long as I'm in this house, you can't use this door.

897
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,000
 Nor can you use your car.

898
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,791
 What are you saying, sir?

899
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,416
 Mr. Sinha will tell you the rest.

900
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,083
 Mr. Sinha?

901
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:33,208
My advocate. I'm filing Rs.5 crore lawsuit on you.

902
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:37,708
Compensation for the loss I suffered in your home.

903
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,666
 You are too much. What have I done?

904
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,333
 Who had dropped the ice?

905
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:44,750
 That's it.

906
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,541
Careful. - Careful.

907
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,541
 Listen.

908
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,125
 Thank you.

909
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,041
 Good news. Good news.

910
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,708
 Good news for all of you.

911
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:32,541
Our Hello company is going to build a mobile networking tower.

912
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,750
No, sir. We don't want mobile phones.

913
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,708
 You are strange.

914
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,416
Nowadays, every small village has mobile phones.

915
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,000
 But you are refusing it?

916
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,458
We'll give you the handsets very cheap. For only Rs.250.

917
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:47,625
Mister, we've already told you. We don't want the mobile phones.

918
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,000
 Why don't you want?

919
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,791
Our Chintuji has become immobile without a mobile.

920
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,916
So, Hello has arrived here. And you are sending them away.

921
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,833
 Please allow them.

922
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,875
 All right. You can install it.

923
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,083
Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.

924
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,333
Come on, boys, let's look for a place for our showroom.

925
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,166
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

926
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,666
 Look, don't be angry.

927
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:23,208
This is Chintuji's problem. Please co-operate with us.

928
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:32,083
Do the boys here have an allergy to mobile phones?

929
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,875
 Yes. There is a secret to it.

930
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,250
Secret? - Yes. Come with me. I'll tell you.

931
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,416
 I'm very interested in secrets.

932
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,750
 Sting operation. Let's go.

933
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,750
 Please.

934
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:51,625
The place for relieving stools and piddles.

935
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,708
I know Hindi well. But I don't understand these words.

936
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:56,916
 What does it mean?

937
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,833
 Number one and number two.

938
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,250
 Come.

939
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,375
 You look very happy?

940
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,791
 I think I'm in love.

941
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:41,041
 Oh. But you are very young.

942
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,958
 While I'm already married man.

943
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:46,125
 I know that very well, sir.

944
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,333
 But I'm not in love with you.

945
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,250
 When did I say so?

946
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:55,375
I was just trying to say that I'm a mature and sensible person.

947
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:57,541
 I can give you the right advice.

948
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,833
 Thank you so much, sir.

949
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,833
 I'll ask for it when I need it.

950
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:02,375
 For now, I'm going for an outing.

951
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,000
 My job is over.

952
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:08,541
No. Your job is not over. You've to complete my book.

953
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,291
 Sir, please, sir.

954
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,000
 Sit. Please.

955
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,291
 So where were we?

956
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,041
When you worked for 'Mera Naam Joker' for the first time..

957
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,875
 Yes. I was 15 to 16 years old.

958
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:26,708
I remember when Mr. Raj Kapoor asked my mummy for permission..

959
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:28,500
.. whether I can work for the Joker's part..

960
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:29,958
 Because I was studying.

961
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:39,208
I was so excited that I ran to my room..

962
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:42,791
.. and I began practising my autograph.

963
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,875
 Sir.

964
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,041
There is a phone call from a Delhi newspaper.

965
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,166
That one of their reporter is missing. Vidyasagar.

966
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,750
 They said that he was staying here.

967
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,250
 Yes, in this asylum.

968
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,166
 But he left from here last evening.

969
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,791
 Yes.

970
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:06,000
 Where?

971
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,958
 Sir, we don't know about it.

972
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,500
 We are very sorry, Mr. Vidyasagar..

973
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,666
 .. that we have kidnapped you.

974
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:16,708
And we have tied you in this manner.

975
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:20,958
 We apologise to you.

976
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,375
 You must be very hungry?

977
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:26,250
 Please have some snacks. Please.

978
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:27,958
 Open your mouth, please.

979
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,333
Open your mouth. Moon from far away..

980
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,916
 Prepares dishes for you.

981
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,458
 You eat in the plate.

982
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:37,833
 And serve the kid in the cup.

983
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,000
 Come, let's go to the guesthouse.

984
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,708
 Host, the ritual is complete.

985
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:25,166
 Welcome. Welcome.

986
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,833
A very hearty welcome to you. - Welcome. Welcome.

987
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:35,416
All of you from the Mumbai film world are welcome to Hadbahedi.

988
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:45,250
I'm very happy to tell you that since Chintuji came here..

989
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:50,000
.. Hadbahedi is making great progress.

990
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:54,000
Earlier, there was power supply only for eight hours here.

991
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,500
But because of Chintuji, the electricity department..

992
00:58:56,583 --> 00:59:00,500
.. has provided six extra hours of power supply.

993
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:04,583
And they have promised to give us power supply for 24 hours very soon.

994
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:14,833
Due to Chintuji, there will be a film shooting here for the first time.

995
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:19,625
And just as because of Mr. Yash Chopra Switzerland..

996
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,375
.. is famous all over India, we hope that one day..

997
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:26,666
.. Hadbahedi too will be famous all over India.

998
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,458
 The item here is very good.

999
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:36,625
People like you malign the name of the film industry.

1000
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,125
 Our town is very small.

1001
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,625
For a hotel, we have a small asylum and government..

1002
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:49,708
.. bungalow where everybody cannot be accommodated.

1003
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,708
But there is enough place for all of you in our hearts.

1004
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:54,875
So, for some of you, accommodation..

1005
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:59,166
.. has been made available in our houses.

1006
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:05,791
Hail. - Mr. Satyakam.

1007
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:08,166
The instalment for your Khandala bungalow is due.

1008
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:09,416
 We've received a bank notice.

1009
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,666
If you do not pay Rs.20 lakh within 15 days..

1010
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,083
.. then the bank will seize the property.

1011
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,166
Income tax returns are to be filed.

1012
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,333
 Please do something soon.

1013
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,666
 Yes, okay.

1014
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,333
 Good morning, sir.

1015
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,833
 Sir, my name is Gyan.

1016
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:23,750
 So? What can I do?

1017
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:28,625
Sir, some of us friends are beginning a TV channel service here.

1018
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,250
Sir, we wish that you should inaugurate it tomorrow.

1019
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,125
 Rs.30 lakh.

1020
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,458
 Sir?

1021
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,291
 Rs.30 lakh to cut the ribbon.

1022
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,000
 Why are you staring at me?

1023
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,375
Nowadays, actors get money to attend marriages too.

1024
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,583
Nobody even attends a funeral service for free.

1025
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,041
 By the way, what is your budget?

1026
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,750
 He is Amar Sanghavi from Triphala.

1027
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:18,041
Mr. Kapoor, my name is Amar Sanghavi.

1028
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,500
I'm the political adviser to honourable Raj Malaya.

1029
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:26,875
Who doesn't know you, Mr. Amar Sanghavi? - Yes.

1030
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:30,958
In our society you are so.. You know what I mean? - Yes, I do.

1031
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,000
 Honourable Mr. Raj Malaya has sent..

1032
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:36,125
 .. this whiskey especially for you.

1033
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,625
Please accept it. - Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

1034
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,958
 There's no label on it.

1035
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,500
It's not named yet. He wants to name it.

1036
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,125
 Chintu no. 1.

1037
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,833
 You must be joking, right?

1038
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,333
 No, Mr. Kapoor, I'm very serious.

1039
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,041
 By the way, call me Chintu.

1040
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:58,083
 Chintu no. 1.

1041
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,333
 Good stuff.

1042
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:04,875
Mr. Chintu, every year, you'll get Rs.50 lakh as fee.

1043
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,166
And free whiskey as much as you want.

1044
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,500
 Well, this is interesting.

1045
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,875
 What else?

1046
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:16,583
And agricultural land anywhere you want in Triphala.

1047
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,041
 But I was born at Hadbahedi.

1048
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:21,000
 The district here is Triphala.

1049
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,750
We'll take care of the registration office.

1050
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:26,250
And we'll prove that you were not born here but at Triphala.

1051
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,583
So, tell me, Mr. Kapoor. Do you agree?

1052
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:34,625
I've two conditions. If you accept, I'd agree.

1053
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:35,958
 Please order me.

1054
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,458
 The first condition is about money.

1055
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:43,333
You make Rs.50 lakh into a round figure.

1056
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,750
 Rs.1 crore.

1057
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:47,666
Rs.50 lakh is already a round figure, sir.

1058
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,541
I know, but 1 crore is even more rounder.

1059
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,083
 Okay. Okay.

1060
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,500
 Second condition.

1061
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,791
My nomination for the Rajya Sabha (Upper house).

1062
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,875
 All right. This will be done too.

1063
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:10,750
But I'll have to talk to honourable Mr. Raj Malaya.

1064
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,000
 Mr. Chintu, give me two-three days.

1065
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,750
Meanwhile, keep the people here entertained.

1066
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,958
 No problem.

1067
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:38,208
Don't worry, Mr. Mohan. Our problems are over.

1068
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:41,916
I'll pay the bank instalment, tax liability within three-four days.

1069
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:44,500
 Promise. Okay.

1070
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:49,000
Wow. Look at her. She is looking great.

1071
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:51,791
You asked money to inaugurate Gyan's shop?

1072
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,458
 Yes. Any problem with it?

1073
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:56,750
 There's definitely a problem, sir.

1074
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,208
As your P.R.O., I'm sorry, I cannot allow this.

1075
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,750
Only the people over here can fulfil your political dream.

1076
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,666
 But you are asking money from them?

1077
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,791
My dear, it is not a part of your duty..

1078
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,000
 .. to interfere in my personal life.

1079
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,583
Anyway, I was somewhat upset yesterday.

1080
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:12,791
I must have said something objectionable.

1081
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,000
 But I didn't really mean it.

1082
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,750
And Mr. Amar Sanghavi from Triphala..

1083
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,125
 Why had he come here?

1084
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:23,291
You are forgetting, Devika, sometime back, I was a big star.

1085
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:24,833
 I had thousands of fans.

1086
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:27,458
Amar Sanghavi is one of them. So, he came to meet me.

1087
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,916
 He is a political broker.

1088
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,000
 He is Raj Malaya's special man.

1089
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,250
 I know.

1090
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,125
Mr. Malaya has sent this whiskey box too.

1091
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:39,166
He invited me for dinner too. But I refused point blank.

1092
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,541
 Are you telling the truth?

1093
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:43,083
 Listen to her. Can I ever lie?

1094
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:46,500
 I'd want my heart to die if I lie.

1095
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,666
 Then please come with me.

1096
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,750
And assure the people of Hadbahedi who're waiting outside.

1097
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:54,250
They are waiting outside? - Yes, please come.

1098
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,875
You go ahead. I'll freshen up and come.

1099
01:04:57,125 --> 01:05:02,500
Give me two-three days. Meanwhile, keep the people here entertained.

1100
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:07,875
Friends, believe me. I've refused Raj Malaya's invitation.

1101
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:12,333
I said very clearly that Hadbahedi is my own.

1102
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,375
 And I belong to Hadbahedi.

1103
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:16,833
 I'll bring my plant here.

1104
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,208
 That was the whole issue.

1105
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,458
It seems you don't believe what I said.

1106
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:38,000
 You don't believe me?

1107
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:44,083
 Forget it. What back pain?

1108
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:47,541
The biggest pain is that you don't..

1109
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,333
 Mother.

1110
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:55,041
 Mother, please come.

1111
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,333
 Look at her. Who is she?

1112
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,458
 She is my mother.

1113
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,833
Today, I swear on this mother's head..

1114
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:11,000
.. that I've nothing to do with the people of Triphala.

1115
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:12,541
 I got nothing to do with them.

1116
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:40,500
If I unknowingly have committed any mistake, then please forgive me.

1117
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,916
 I apologise to Arun too.

1118
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:49,208
And Gyan, my brother.. please forgive me.

1119
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,416
 I made a mistake.

1120
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,083
 I'll inaugurate your shop right now.

1121
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:55,083
 And I'll do it for free.

1122
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:58,208
Is that fine with you? - Sir!

1123
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,791
 Hug me, my friend.

1124
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,833
 Okay, let me inaugurate it. Okay?

1125
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,291
 Good luck. Good luck.

1126
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,458
 Applause.

1127
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,500
Long live. - Chintuji.

1128
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,666
Long live. - Chintuji.

1129
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,958
My friend, Jack, is coming to India for the first time.

1130
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,541
 For the shooting of this film.

1131
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,416
 Please welcome him wholeheartedly.

1132
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,916
 Hi. Please come.

1133
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,958
 Welcome. Welcome my friend, Jack.

1134
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,250
 Welcome to India.

1135
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:57,666
 How are you?

1136
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,916
 I'm fine.

1137
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,375
 Thank you.

1138
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:02,791
Your Hindi was not bad and my French wasn't bad either.

1139
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:04,541
 How was your journey?

1140
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:05,916
 I'm thrilled.

1141
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,208
But I couldn't see things because I was in that..

1142
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,125
.. very unique vehicle, what do you call it?

1143
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,458
 Palanquin.

1144
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:15,291
I wanted to see some unique features of your country.

1145
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,708
 Unique? -Yes.

1146
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,333
Well, I'll show you tomorrow morning.

1147
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,875
 The most unique thing of India.

1148
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:27,541
It is very, very unique way of doing potty..

1149
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:31,375
On my haunches. It is called yoga, right?

1150
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:35,208
 Wow. I'm enjoying this.

1151
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:40,291
Open sky. Riverside. Fresh air. The birds flying.

1152
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,875
 And such sweet chirping.

1153
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:49,000
It's divine. And so, the people in the west call India their Guru.

1154
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,083
 I'll try back home.

1155
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:54,625
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

1156
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:58,083
 You are most welcome, Jack.

1157
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,541
 Please come, sir.

1158
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:01,916
This way? - Yes, this way.

1159
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,333
Look at this place. There are many good locations at Hadbahedi.

1160
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,000
 This is one of them if you like.

1161
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,208
Yes. Yes. - Ahead, over there..

1162
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:11,750
No. No. The camera will be here. Shooting will be done here.

1163
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,291
 Malkani, you'll put the set here?

1164
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:16,333
Set? Sir, please come here. - Just a second, sir.

1165
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:19,541
What happened? - Just a second, sir. What are you saying, sir?

1166
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:21,375
I don't have money. Not enough budget.

1167
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:22,833
 So, you are compromising?

1168
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:26,125
This is the most important song of the film.

1169
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,000
 This is the great dramatic moment.

1170
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:32,666
So, I'm bringing eight foreign dancers.

1171
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,458
And I've also included Ms. Menaka in the song.

1172
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,000
Menaka? - Yes.

1173
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:42,708
Menaka? - Yes. Great. That's good.

1174
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:46,125
 Sir, I do so much for you.

1175
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:50,375
But if you too can do something for the set..

1176
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:51,916
 Oh. Oh.

1177
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,500
 Ms. Kanta, I've a request.

1178
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:57,083
Yes, sir. - If Mr. Malkani wants to put a set here, then you..

1179
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,500
 Just order us, sir.

1180
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:01,125
 Enough. Enough. My job is done.

1181
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:02,333
 Thank you, sir.

1182
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,833
 What are you doing?

1183
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,750
 There's a surprise for you.

1184
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:15,958
 What is the surprise?

1185
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,875
 I'll show you. Hold on. Hold on.

1186
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,125
 Come here. See.

1187
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:23,958
 Wow.

1188
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
 Hadbahedi Times in colour?

1189
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:30,875
 And it's a daily?

1190
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,250
 Wow. This is incredible.

1191
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,750
 I'm so happy. Congratulations.

1192
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:37,000
 Thank you.

1193
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,708
 Devika, I owe this to you.

1194
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,958
 Not to me, but to Chintuji.

1195
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:43,500
Yes, I agree. Because of Chintuji, the circulation..

1196
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:44,958
 .. of our newspaper has doubled.

1197
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:47,458
Hadbahedi has become well known everywhere.

1198
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:50,416
 But you are my real media.

1199
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,375
All my dreams have come true because of you.

1200
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,250
 All?

1201
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,208
 No, one is left.

1202
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,250
 Your letter.

1203
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:13,708
There is a registered letter for you from Delhi.

1204
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:15,083
 At the address of the asylum.

1205
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,458
 Your signature is needed.

1206
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,666
I'll do it with my feet. You have tied my hands.

1207
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,958
Oh. Please forgive me. I'll open it right away.

1208
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:28,875
 It is a government affair.

1209
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:32,625
And government affairs should be done properly.

1210
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:39,833
And your signature is needed for this.

1211
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:42,083
 Here. Take this.

1212
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,541
 Where do I keep it? Bend down.

1213
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,125
 Please enter the date too.

1214
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,375
Date? - Yes.

1215
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:54,583
 Okay.

1216
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,000
 Take this.

1217
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:00,458
 Thank you. Thank you.

1218
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,166
 All right. Bye.

1219
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,500
Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

1220
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,500
It seems it will rain the whole night.

1221
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,208
Come on. Tell me your detailed story.

1222
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:45,875
 Why do you want to hear it?

1223
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,791
In a few days, you'll go back from here.

1224
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:51,333
 Please come along with me.

1225
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:54,708
 You are talented.

1226
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,166
There are so many opportunities there.

1227
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:04,291
I agree that Hadbahedi is a beautiful place.

1228
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:09,208
But you know, you can always come back for your holidays.

1229
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:14,083
 You won't understand, Devika.

1230
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,750
 Everything I own is here.

1231
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,875
 This is where I need to be.

1232
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:27,375
You'll go back from here. And you'll forget this place.

1233
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:33,625
But this is my destiny. And I'm here to stay.

1234
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,791
My long story hasn't come to an end as yet.

1235
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,291
 You wanted to hear it, right?

1236
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,791
 You'll be shocked to hear it.

1237
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,750
 But still, I'll tell you.

1238
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:52,000
 My story begins a few years back.

1239
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:55,166
 Year 2001, 13th of December.

1240
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,458
The day there was an attack on the parliament.

1241
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:04,416
 Don't you remember? Devika?

1242
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:20,416
 This is good. It sounds nice.

1243
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,625
Mr. Basu. - Yes.

1244
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,833
 One thing is good.

1245
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:26,833
Our set is ready, almost as Mr. Malkani had wanted it.

1246
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:28,000
Isn't it? - Yes.

1247
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:29,333
 There is one more special thing.

1248
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:33,708
Chintuji has ordered that all of you will have to act in the film.

1249
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:38,916
It means so many revolutionary changes have..

1250
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,875
.. occurred in our Hadbahedi because of Chintuji?

1251
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:45,416
Yes. - That's right. - So much work is being done? - Right.

1252
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:50,625
If everybody thinks in this manner about his birthplace..

1253
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:53,500
.. and things get done in this manner then our youth..

1254
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,000
.. won't feel the need to go to cities.

1255
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,250
 Yes.

1256
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:01,291
Mr. Malkani, what is my motivation?

1257
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:04,500
An actor has only one motivation. Money. Money.

1258
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,083
 So, should I say that money..

1259
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:09,125
No, you say, "Hidimba, I'm boiling."

1260
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,625
Yes. - Sir, watch the rehearsal. - All right.

1261
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:12,833
 Silence.

1262
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:14,833
 Mr. Malkani, my shot..

1263
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:16,125
 Ms. Menaka, just two minutes.

1264
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,000
Serve refreshments to Ms. Menaka, please.

1265
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,791
 Remove the umbrella.

1266
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,000
 Say action.

1267
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,458
 Action. Action.

1268
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,625
 Zingala. Zingala.

1269
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,916
 Bambola. Bambola.

1270
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,875
 Zingala. Zingala.

1271
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,083
 Bambola. Bambola.

1272
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:34,541
 Zingala. Zingala.

1273
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:37,250
 Cut. Cut. -Bambola..

1274
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:38,458
 We'll have a retake.

1275
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,625
Will my father go give the clap there?

1276
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,333
Sir, it was not a take. It was a rehearsal, sir.

1277
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:44,541
So, won't there be a rehearsal of the clap?

1278
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:47,125
Yes. - Come on. Go.

1279
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,000
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1280
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,791
 I'm getting a bit confused.

1281
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,250
When I was narrated the script, I was riding on a horse.

1282
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:56,416
 Now, why have you put me on bed?

1283
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,333
 Ask the director about it.

1284
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,666
 He ordered it. I placed it.

1285
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:06,583
Chintuji, you were sick, so, I didn't want to trouble you.

1286
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,958
 So, I've put you on the bed.

1287
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,583
But I'm fine now. I can ride a horse too.

1288
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:11,958
 Get me down.

1289
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:15,958
You explain the whole scene to me. And motivate me as an actor.

1290
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,875
 An actor has only one motivation.

1291
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:21,083
What? - I'll tell you that.

1292
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,708
What are you looking at? Bring the horse.

1293
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:28,875
Come on. Come on. Sir, the horse is here.

1294
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,833
 What? Is this a horse?

1295
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,000
Yes, sir. - Move.

1296
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,958
 But it is a mule.

1297
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,125
I could find only this in Hadbahedi.

1298
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,250
Doesn't matter. Chintuji, you look so good on the mule.

1299
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:43,125
What are you saying? - Come here when I say action.

1300
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,333
 All right. Action.

1301
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,416
 Chintuji, please come.

1302
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,250
 This mule is not walking at all.

1303
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,333
Then whip it. - No, no.

1304
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,708
 Ms. Menaka will get upset.

1305
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:57,166
 Why would I get upset?

1306
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,166
I am not talking about you. I am talking about that Menaka.

1307
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,791
 Animal welfare activist.

1308
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,041
Okay, okay. Let me think. Let me think.

1309
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,250
But, sir.. - Let me think.

1310
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,791
 Action.

1311
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,500
How was it? Good? - Very good.

1312
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:25,666
 Action.

1313
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:30,875
 Hidimba. I am burning.

1314
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:34,416
 Mobutu. Mobutu.

1315
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,125
 Mobutu.

1316
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,916
Cut. - Cut.

1317
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,208
Very good. - Very bad.

1318
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:07,500
 Why?

1319
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,958
Ms. Menaka said the dialogue all wrong.

1320
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,166
 Take another take.

1321
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,750
 I said what you have written.

1322
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,916
 No, madam, you said it wrong.

1323
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
 What was your line?

1324
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:20,583
 Wrong. Your line is..

1325
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,541
What is the difference between the two of them?

1326
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,750
 There is a lot of difference.

1327
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:28,166
 A huge difference.

1328
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,875
You will have to say the right line.

1329
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:32,583
No. I have already said what I had to.

1330
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,791
 I won't say it again.

1331
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,625
And anyway, all your lines are nonsensical.

1332
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:39,083
 You dare to challenge me.

1333
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:41,708
 You have just entered the industry.

1334
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:43,958
I have been in the industry for the past 40 years.

1335
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:45,666
 I have given 17 hit films.

1336
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,416
I have won three Filmfares and two National awards.

1337
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,625
 And you will teach me how to write.

1338
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,708
Mr. Malkani.. - Whether Mr. Malkani sir calls Mr. Sampat..

1339
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,125
 .. or calls Mr. Bhatt..

1340
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,833
 This time around, I won't budge.

1341
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:57,791
 My association is behind me.

1342
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,750
You will have to say the right line.

1343
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:02,000
 I won't say it. I won't say it.

1344
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:03,208
 I will absolutely not.

1345
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,708
 Just a minute. Just a minute.

1346
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,083
 Both of you have forgotten that..

1347
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,166
.. I am the producerdirector of this film.

1348
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,208
Me. - If you really are, then prove it.

1349
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:12,583
 And ask her to say the proper line.

1350
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,291
What if I give this dialogue to Paplu Yadhav?

1351
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,625
 You can't do that.

1352
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:16,833
 Why can't I?

1353
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,083
I am the producerdirector of this film.

1354
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,958
 My association is behind me too.

1355
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,833
Who will stop me? - I will stop you.

1356
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:24,625
 Because a man can't say this line.

1357
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:26,041
 Why can't he?

1358
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:30,125
 Because it means I am pregnant.

1359
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,625
 Menaka, I am a heart patient.

1360
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,250
 Just say this one line properly..

1361
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,375
 .. I will pay you Rs.50,000 extra.

1362
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:51,750
 Cash.

1363
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,583
 Will you start from the beginning?

1364
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:57,375
No, just this one line.. in close up.

1365
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,916
Okay, ready. - Thank you.

1366
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:05,541
 Roll sound, camera, action.

1367
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,875
 Cut.

1368
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:22,833
 Song.

1369
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,875
 Song.

1370
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,250
 Satyajit Ray.

1371
01:24:33,291 --> 01:24:34,458
 Paplu has found a girl for himself.

1372
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,166
 Find me a girl too.

1373
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,458
 Paplu is very serious.

1374
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:38,708
 What rubbish?

1375
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:42,166
You fool, I travelled six miles to get alcohol.

1376
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,208
 Where can I get you a girl from?

1377
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,125
 There she comes.

1378
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,583
 "Sometimes.. "

1379
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:52,291
 What are you doing?

1380
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,208
 Come on.

1381
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,208
 Leave me.

1382
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,750
 Leave her. Hey, what are you doing!

1383
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:05,458
 If not the girl, her drape will do.

1384
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,083
 That's the limit.

1385
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,125
These people committed theft in your homes.

1386
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,041
 Misbehaved with Ayesha.

1387
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,375
 And all of you are quiet.

1388
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,708
We already told you that we don't need fame.

1389
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:19,333
 We are happy the way we are.

1390
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:22,916
Arun, development has some negative points too.

1391
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,125
 And it always comes along.

1392
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:27,708
I wanted the world to know the speciality of Hadbahedi.

1393
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,208
Anyway, I suggest that we search their luggage..

1394
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:35,375
.. so that we can recover the stolen goods.

1395
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:39,458
And I would like to thrash the boy who misbehaved with Ayesha.

1396
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:43,000
Listen, Arun, they are leaving tomorrow, let them leave.

1397
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,333
No, you don't understand.. - Arun.

1398
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,125
 No.

1399
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:52,208
The house in which I was staying, everyone is crazy.

1400
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,875
 Look.

1401
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,250
 You took it?

1402
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:58,416
 Of course. Who can leave money?

1403
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,375
 Look, I brought this.

1404
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:03,208
Hey, you! - You are all very lucky.

1405
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,458
All I could get my hands on was this.

1406
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,000
 Homemade food for your journey.

1407
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,291
 Our best wishes are with you.

1408
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,625
 Here.

1409
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,583
Eat slowly, the chicken will not run away.

1410
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,666
 That old man ruined my digestion..

1411
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,291
.. by treating me to herbs and fruits.

1412
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:40,375
 I escaped because of this letter.

1413
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:42,041
 My suspicion was correct.

1414
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:44,541
 His real name is Manjeet Singh.

1415
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,250
 The police is looking for him for..

1416
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:50,041
.. the terrorist attack on the Parliament.

1417
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,958
 But what will you do now?

1418
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,625
 Just watch what I do?

1419
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,416
 Hello.

1420
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,208
 Yes.

1421
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:21,291
 Okay, sir.

1422
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,333
 Yes.

1423
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,541
 Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1424
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:30,666
There was a call from the Prime Minister's office.

1425
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,083
Prime Minister. - Yes.

1426
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,166
Our minister of external affairs, Mr, Sanjeev Oberoi..

1427
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,583
.. and the foreign council of Uzbekistan are coming here.

1428
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:40,291
They have some urgent work with Chintuji.

1429
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:43,208
 Good morning, Mr. Kapoor.

1430
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:44,500
 This is my counterpart.

1431
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:48,000
Mr. Nicolagovor! Foreign council of Uzbekistan.

1432
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:56,333
He is saying there is a woman very ill in Tashkent.

1433
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,083
 And she wants to come here.

1434
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:05,000
This woman is the wife of Uzbekistan's vice president.

1435
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:07,750
And, she is in the last stage of cancer.

1436
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:11,041
Yes, but how is this matter connected to me?

1437
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,250
 Let me explain.

1438
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,791
Officially and personally, her husband..

1439
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,500
.. has requested our Prime Minister.

1440
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,333
To aide in fulfilling Lady Sana's last wish.

1441
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,083
There is a protocol between Uzbekistan..

1442
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:24,375
 .. and the government of India.

1443
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,208
 That's why, the Indian government..

1444
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:27,958
.. wants to make every effort possible.

1445
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,666
Before marriage, Marina was an actress.

1446
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:37,791
Years ago, she acted with your father Raj Kapoor in a film.

1447
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,458
 And its name was 'Mera Naam Joker'.

1448
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:45,416
During her tour of India, she had come here once.

1449
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,041
Now, during the last days of her life..

1450
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:49,791
 .. she wants to come here again.

1451
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,250
 She is praying.

1452
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:40,791
 Mr. Kapoor, she is calling you.

1453
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,666
 Oh, my God.

1454
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:10,166
 Hello, Sana, I am Rishi Kapoor.

1455
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,250
Welcome to India. - Thank you.

1456
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,666
You look like your father. - Really?

1457
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,875
 It's true.

1458
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,208
Dada? - Yes, yes.

1459
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,333
 This is for you.

1460
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,083
For me? - Yes.

1461
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,166
 Meeting, separation.

1462
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:08,916
 Separation, meeting.. that's life.

1463
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:31,166
 I came here 40 years ago.

1464
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:36,791
I always dreamed to be Shirwas again.

1465
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:44,375
Your father was a very nice actor.

1466
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:50,416
But he was an even better human being.

1467
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:57,083
 You too should be like him.

1468
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:30,750
 Hello, Manjeet.

1469
01:33:39,125 --> 01:33:40,250
 What happened?

1470
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:45,291
My name is Arun Bakshi, not Manjeet.

1471
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,041
 I knew you'd say that.

1472
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:52,583
That's why I have brought along the evidence.

1473
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,291
 What do you want?

1474
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,750
Rs.20 lakh which the terrorist association..

1475
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:07,458
.. gave you to distribute among your allies.

1476
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:08,875
 I don't have any money.

1477
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:10,250
 I don't care.

1478
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:15,041
If you want to live here peacefully..

1479
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:17,875
 .. then I want that money.

1480
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,333
 I will come again tomorrow.

1481
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,958
 Keep the money ready.

1482
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,166
 So, this is your reality.

1483
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:07,458
Devika, this is not true. - Liar.

1484
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:10,916
 Liar.

1485
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,125
Devika. - I hate you, Arun.

1486
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,291
 I hate you.

1487
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,666
 Don't cry.

1488
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:29,666
 Stop crying.

1489
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,375
 Don't cry.

1490
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,541
 Arun is not a liar, Devika.

1491
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,500
He has been misunderstood as a terrorist..

1492
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:38,708
 .. just because of a SIM card.

1493
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,666
And the person who Arun had lent his SIM card to, Ansari..

1494
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:44,916
 .. he was innocent too.

1495
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,375
And the poor boy is still rotting in jail.

1496
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:50,291
 All of us know that.

1497
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:53,500
 That's why we have hid him here.

1498
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,708
But how do you know Arun is innocent?

1499
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:02,791
 Arun has told us all this himself.

1500
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:05,708
And we believe in our hearts that he is innocent.

1501
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:10,541
And anyway, we people of Hadbahedi listen to our hearts.

1502
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,291
 What should I do?

1503
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:33,041
Please connect me to Mr. Joshi, the chief editor.

1504
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:37,208
Hello, sir, this is Devika Malhotra speaking.

1505
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,625
 Yes, sir.

1506
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,041
Sir, can you mail me all the information..

1507
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:44,958
.. related to the Parliament attack, Ansari case?

1508
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:47,375
 Thank you so much, sir.

1509
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,708
 I will be grateful.

1510
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:52,250
 Mr. Amar Sanghavi sir, how are you?

1511
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:53,625
 I am very well, sir. Thank you.

1512
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,958
 I read the contract.

1513
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,250
 I will sign it in front of you.

1514
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:02,166
 And sir, my small cheque..

1515
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,750
 Thank you, sir.

1516
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,250
 Sir, I had a small request.

1517
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:07,041
 Don't deduct the TDS.

1518
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,250
 Thank you, sir.

1519
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:11,041
Yes, we will leave after a while. Any problem?

1520
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:12,416
 Okay, sir.

1521
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,041
 Excuse me, sir.

1522
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:16,125
 Yes, Devika.

1523
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,791
What conspiracy are you hatching with Amar Sanghavi?

1524
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:23,291
 That's none of your business.

1525
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:24,541
 It is my business.

1526
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:26,583
 You are a liar, Mr. Rishi Kapoor.

1527
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:29,708
I am quitting. And I am going to report this to my agency.

1528
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,125
Damn your agency. I don't need you people.

1529
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,333
And, as far as my political career is concerned..

1530
01:37:34,416 --> 01:37:35,833
 I have made my own arrangements.

1531
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,041
So, go to hell. - You go to hell.

1532
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:47,208
 Here, I have given my initials.

1533
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:50,625
 And here is Mr. Rishi Kapoor.

1534
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,000
 Yes, sir.

1535
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:59,125
Here Chintuji.. your round figure cheque. - 1 crore.

1536
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:02,625
Thank you. - Thank you.

1537
01:38:02,708 --> 01:38:03,833
 All the best.

1538
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:12,708
 I shall take your leave.

1539
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:15,708
 Enjoy the party. What's the hurry?

1540
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:19,750
 There is no trusting actors..

1541
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:21,833
.. they always keep changing their roles.

1542
01:38:23,166 --> 01:38:25,166
Mr. Amar Sanghavi, you people change parties..

1543
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,250
 .. more often than we do.

1544
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:32,000
 Manjeet. Manjeet Singh.

1545
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:41,666
 Manjeet, I have arrived.

1546
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,375
 For the money.

1547
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:45,291
 What happened, Brother?

1548
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:49,000
 We collected as much as we could.

1549
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:54,166
There's some money and my wife's silver jewellery.

1550
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:57,791
 Please take it.

1551
01:38:58,166 --> 01:38:59,291
 Chauhan has arrived.

1552
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:01,750
I have already told you, I don't have any money.

1553
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:03,833
There was a message on Ansari's mobile..

1554
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:05,625
Have received the money, leaving Delhi.

1555
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:08,208
I didn't get the money from Ansari, so, where is it?

1556
01:39:08,291 --> 01:39:09,333
 I don't know where it is.

1557
01:39:09,416 --> 01:39:10,666
 Mr. Chauhan.

1558
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:13,416
 Please spare Arun.

1559
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:16,208
 He doesn't lie, Mr. Chauhan.

1560
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:18,625
He never had any money and he still doesn't.

1561
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:21,250
 You want money, don't you?

1562
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:24,833
We, the people of Hadbahedi, have collected some money.

1563
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:28,791
 Take this and spare our Arun.

1564
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,166
 Don't act smart, Manjeet.

1565
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,625
Give me the bag. - No, I can't let this happen.

1566
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:38,833
 Arun, give him the bag.

1567
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:40,000
 Give him the bag, Arun.

1568
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,833
 Give him the bag.

1569
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,708
 You arrest me, take me to Delhi.

1570
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:53,833
I am ready to rot in jail all my life.

1571
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:55,708
 But I won't give this bag to you.

1572
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:57,583
 Manjeet, give me that bag.

1573
01:39:57,666 --> 01:40:00,291
 Give him the bag.

1574
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:02,833
Manjeet, give me that bag. - I won't.

1575
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,333
 Arun. Arun.

1576
01:40:09,416 --> 01:40:10,583
 Get up. Get up.

1577
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,083
 Are you fine?

1578
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:13,583
Give me the bag. - No.

1579
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,000
 Don't be insane, leave it.

1580
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:19,583
 Here is the money, go away.

1581
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:22,333
 Wait.

1582
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:28,833
 Don't you dare touch that bag.

1583
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:47,416
 Both of you are such idiots.

1584
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,416
The supreme court has acquitted Ansari three months ago.

1585
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:54,958
That's why, Arun's case was dismissed.

1586
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:58,083
 And you are still blackmailing him.

1587
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,291
 Look, here is the evidence.

1588
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:03,458
 Arun is innocent.

1589
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:11,541
 Arun, are you fine?

1590
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:16,166
 I am sorry, Arun.

1591
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,333
 I misunderstood you.

1592
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:24,000
 Shall we go to Triphala?

1593
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:26,500
You know, I want to show you something..

1594
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:28,708
 .. very unique about us Indians.

1595
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:30,166
 Come along, Mr. Amar Sanghavi.

1596
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:32,708
I want to show this man, how Indians..

1597
01:41:32,791 --> 01:41:34,458
 .. worship people like us.

1598
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:36,333
Come. Hey, you, get whiskey into the car. We shall talk in the car.

1599
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:37,583
 Come on.

1600
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:38,791
 Stop the car.

1601
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,166
 Stop the car here.

1602
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,375
 Here we are.

1603
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,083
 Come on, Jack.

1604
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:47,708
 Come, Jack.

1605
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:48,916
 This is me.

1606
01:41:49,416 --> 01:41:53,291
This is how Indian people worship their actors..

1607
01:41:53,375 --> 01:41:56,625
 .. politicians, sportspersons.

1608
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:59,041
 This is how Indian people..

1609
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:01,916
.. want to show their love for their idols.

1610
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,958
 This is a 35-feet me.

1611
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,125
 Cheers to me.

1612
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,625
 My.. my. So huge.

1613
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:10,750
I am standing tall at 35 feet, Mr. Amar.

1614
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:13,500
 But do they live up to their image?

1615
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:16,666
 Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

1616
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,875
 Say again.

1617
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:22,625
I said, do they.. or, do you live up to that image.

1618
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:27,916
He is asking, whether you politicians, actors..

1619
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,250
.. and sportspersons are really that great?

1620
01:42:48,291 --> 01:42:49,416
 Sir.

1621
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:13,708
I haven't seen anyone as cheap and lowly as you.

1622
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:18,166
Since you came here, our town has been cursed.

1623
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:22,000
You brought every vice of your world along.

1624
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:25,000
 Look at them.

1625
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:26,833
 They gave you everything.

1626
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,625
 Love, respect.

1627
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,166
 They worshipped you.

1628
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:33,083
Everybody worked for free in your film.

1629
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,041
 For your meat and alcohol..

1630
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:36,666
.. they broke their religious traditions.

1631
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:41,083
They sent off thieves with love and kindness.

1632
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,750
 And what did you do for them?

1633
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:45,000
 Deceit. Betrayal.

1634
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:48,750
 You called her your mother.

1635
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,916
 And took a false oath on her.

1636
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,625
 We love her more than our lives.

1637
01:45:33,541 --> 01:45:34,666
 Hello.

1638
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,041
Mr. Kapoor. - Yes.

1639
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,541
 There is sad news for you.

1640
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,708
We have just been informed, that Lady Marina..

1641
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:46,625
 .. just passed away in Tashkent.

1642
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,708
 Thank you.

1643
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:56,708
 'You father was a very nice actor.'

1644
01:45:57,375 --> 01:46:01,583
'But he was an even better human being.'

1645
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:05,625
 'Be like him.'

1646
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:27,458
 Forgive me, Chintuji.

1647
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,750
 I am incomplete now.

1648
01:46:34,291 --> 01:46:37,708
Forgive me, as you would your younger brother.

1649
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:18,875
 Chintu.

1650
01:47:28,541 --> 01:47:29,833
 Forgive us.

1651
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:32,083
 Arun is still young.

1652
01:47:32,458 --> 01:47:33,833
 He has made a mistake.

1653
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,750
We don't have any grievances against you.

1654
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:40,750
If you want to go to Triphala, then we will escort you till the border.

1655
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,333
No matter where you are, you will always dwell in our hearts.

1656
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
And we will always love you the same.

1657
01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:55,125
 Shall I show you something?

1658
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:57,916
 Come.

1659
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:37,458
 Pull. Pull.

1660
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:52,083
 Harder. Pull. Pull.

1661
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:00,916
 Pick it up.

1662
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:25,916
 Rishi K, these people are great.

1663
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:28,916
 They have raised you again.

1664
01:50:51,666 --> 01:50:56,333
And this way, the dreams of Hadbahedi were fulfilled.

1665
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:58,000
 And their city got famous.

1666
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:02,208
Now, even Shilajeet express stops at Hadbahedi station.

1667
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:04,791
 Chintuji and Malkani together..

1668
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:09,041
.. upgraded Hadbahedi cinema hall with Dolby system.

1669
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:13,208
 Hadbahedi got an airport.

1670
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:16,000
 People from all over the world..

1671
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:20,291
 .. started visiting Satyakam's tomb.

1672
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:25,375
Chintuji gave up the thought of entering politics.

1673
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:32,000
Devika left her PR job and joined Arun's newspaper.

1674
01:51:32,333 --> 01:51:34,750
 And both settled down.

1675
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,375
 Kutti and Mariamma got married too.

1676
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,083
The elders of Hadbahedi still sit at the same tea stall..

1677
01:51:43,166 --> 01:51:45,416
 .. play chess and gossip.

1678
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:55,083
 "Every grain of soil preaches.. "

1679
01:51:55,625 --> 01:52:01,541
 ".. that truth resides here."

1680
01:52:02,166 --> 01:52:08,916
"Through the lanes of my land, oh, Mother.. "

1681
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:16,791
 ".. the holiest of the yogis pass."

1682
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:31,291
"A lamp flickers amidst a storm." - "A lamp flickers."

1683
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:38,083
"Somewhere the fire of hatred rages." - "The fire of hatred rages."

1684
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:42,833
"Somewhere there is a tempest of injustice."

1685
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:47,708
"Somewhere lies a dream, shattered."

1686
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:52,458
 "We have no worries."

1687
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:57,458
 "God is kind to our land."

1688
01:52:57,541 --> 01:53:02,916
 "Everything here is fine."

1689
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,666
 "Everything is fine."

1690
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:07,041
 "Everything is fine."

1691
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:09,583
 "Everything is fine."

1692
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:11,750
 "Everything is fine."

1693
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:17,083
 "Everything here is fine."

1694
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:21,458
 "Come here and listen!"

1695
01:53:21,708 --> 01:53:24,208
 "Everything here is fine."

1696
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:28,708
 "Come here and listen!"

1697
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:33,541
 "Come here and listen!"

1698
01:53:47,458 --> 01:53:52,125
"Somewhere there's deception in the hearts."

1699
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:59,583
"Somewhere, love brings along pain."

1700
01:54:01,708 --> 01:54:06,291
"Somewhere, there are cracks in the mirror."

1701
01:54:06,375 --> 01:54:11,458
"Somewhere, life is akin to slavery."

1702
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:15,625
 "We have no worries."

1703
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:20,541
 "God is kind to our land."

1704
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:26,000
 "Everything here is fine."

1705
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:27,875
 "Everything is fine."

1706
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,166
 "Everything is fine."

1707
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:35,458
 "Everything is fine."

1708
01:54:35,541 --> 01:54:39,791
"Everything here is fine." - "Come here and listen!"

1709
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:47,500
 "Everything here is fine."

1710
01:54:47,583 --> 01:54:51,833
 "Everything here is fine."

1711
01:54:51,916 --> 01:54:56,666
 "Come here and listen!"

1712
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:01,791
 "Everything here is fine."
