1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,736
evey ship does reach the shore.

2
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,403
those who have no oarsman receive god's help.

3
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,634
''oh, you ungodly man!''

4
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,402
radhe krishna.

5
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,402
ls anyone around? can someone help?

6
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:23,236
Help.
Come quickly.

7
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,635
someone's beating up kunwarji.

8
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,901
beating me up? how dare you?

9
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,235
''but, l'm your servant, sir. - my servant?''

10
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:34,401
you asked me to massage you.

11
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:42,238
''oh yes, so l did. odd isn't it? o_ you go, all of you.''

12
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,068
lt isn't the priest's fault. you know him - a bit of a nut.

13
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,403
''but sir, why do you need massage at this age?''

14
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,071
''lf l don't, won't my wife make life tough for me?''

15
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,733
Your wife?
- Yes.

16
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,403
but your wife left you long ago.

17
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,067
'why, yes, that's true. odd, isn't it?''

18
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,702
but l wasn't talking of that wife.

19
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:14,403
l was thinking of my future wife.

20
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,235
''so, have you found a bride for me?''

21
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,902
''sir, my name is janaki prasad.''

22
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,401
Of the 100 couples in
this town...

23
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,735
...99 have been ruined by me.

24
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,901
'what did you say? - l mean, l brought them together.''

25
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,235
l've brought you an excellent proposal.

26
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,069
not too well o_ but a good family. - how old is she?

27
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,735
she's 1a going on 19.

28
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:43,235
'well endowed, flashing eyes, and...''

29
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,401
''Softly, softly.''

30
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:53,237
'You see, my nephew's in the house.
l'll get rid of him.''

31
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:56,069
wait here. l'll be back.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,737
''up to the age of 25 a man should be a bachelor, celibate.''

33
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,902
from 25 to 50 he should be a householder.

34
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,736
''from 50 to 75... - bhola, it's so hot.''

35
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,403
why are you indoors reading this serious stu_?

36
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,902
you're young. you should be having fun.

37
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:30,904
got to a park. read a mystey or a detective novel.

38
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:33,067
''or a romance, or the premshastra. - uncle!''

39
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,901
you keep telling me such naughty things.

40
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,068
''gosh, odd isn't it? l tell you naughty things.''

41
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,734
but what naughty things did l mention?

42
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,901
why did you recommend the premshastra?

43
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,571
but that's a book all young men read.

44
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,568
don't read it if it doesn't appeal to you.

45
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,901
But get out of this stum room.

46
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,570
make use of the river and gardens nearby.

47
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,736
take in some fresh air.

48
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,901
''but l've just had a full meal, uncle.''

49
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,570
''bhola, your name suits you. you're so innocent.''

50
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,236
exercise will improve your health. - it might ruin my health.

51
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:18,401
No it won't.

52
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:20,901
all right. l'll go because you insist.

53
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,568
'Vey good, vey good.''

54
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,236
''never mind, pandit. take some more.''

55
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,401
so what were you saying?

56
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:56,239
1a or 19...flashing eyes...

57
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,234
do you have a photo of her? - photo?

58
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,236
lsn't she fit to be
your queen?

59
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:10,736
''pandit, you've done vey well this time.''

60
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:40,906
''from 1 to 25 a man should be a bachelor, a celibate.''

61
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:46,904
from 25 to 50 he should enjoy family life.

62
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,734
how old am l now?

63
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,402
gosh l'm already 26.

64
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,067
that's 6 months of grihastashram wasted.

65
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,402
a bite! l've caught a fish! seems like a huge fat one!

66
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:21,404
''oh, my god, a mermaid!''

67
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,903
''oh! you'd cast this line to catch a mermaid, had you?''

68
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:31,403
l came to catch some fish. - he looks like a shameless guy.

69
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,068
shameless? me?

70
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,902
you're the shameless ones. l'm fully dressed.

71
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,902
but you're practically naked in the water.

72
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,069
''girls, l think he's destined to die in the water.''

73
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:46,234
''Come on, let's get him.''

74
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,903
''Stop, don't touch me.''

75
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:56,235
don't you dare. don't think l'm a coward.

76
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,568
''l can hold a girl's hand. l'm 26 years old, you know.''

77
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,569
you sure are proud of it.

78
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,236
why not? look what's written here. it says -

79
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,903
up to the age of 25 a man should be a bachelor.

80
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,901
and from 25 to 50 he should be a family man.

81
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,067
poor thing! a brand new interest in girls.

82
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,401
''so, have you find a girl to start a family with?''

83
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,401
a young man like me won't have a problem.

84
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,901
''oh my! ouite the he-man, isn't he?''

85
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:35,737
watch it! don't tease me. l might lose my temper.

86
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,068
careful! he might just mary you in his rage.

87
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,902
mary her? no way. even my uncle wouldn't mary her.

88
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,404
But if it were you -
l could consider it.

89
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,069
really? right away.

90
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,233
''Look, look.''

91
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:11,403
Bye bye. See you.
- Bye.

92
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:19,236
Yes. This is where we were.

93
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,299
laila said that...

94
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,902
how can he run away? delhi's far away.

95
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:41,906
those are majnu's dialogues. not prithviraj chauhan's.

96
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,735
you've gone crazy.

97
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,234
can't you speak a single dialogue properly?

98
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:51,235
''Sory, l forgot!
- Forgot, did you?''

99
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:56,068
he's wearing laila's costume and speaking jai singh's lines!

100
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,568
''Sory, l forgot!''

101
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:01,569
you keep quiet! remove that cigarette.

102
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,901
do you remember your dialogues? - absolutely.

103
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,233
let's hear them. - shall l?

104
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:05,953
laila!

105
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,234
address the audience. continue.

106
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:16,238
''laila darling, your farhad is having a tough time in mumbai.''

107
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:16,958
great.

108
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,902
''laila is with farhad, is she?''

109
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,904
''and in mumbai? where's my ''''laila majnu'''' script?''

110
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,401
''calcuttiya, come here. - yes.''

111
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,734
just read this. tell them the correct dialogues.

112
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,734
Here it is.

113
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,903
''see, laila calls out to her beloved manju...''

114
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,901
''no, majnu. in the forest.''

115
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,234
kaiz!

116
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,234
gas!

117
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,567
go back.

118
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:24,070
quite a miracle.

119
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,735
you're gassing through your lips.

120
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,234
You idiot.

121
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,068
majnu's real name was kaiz. kaiz.

122
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,401
say it : kaiz. - gas.

123
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,735
kaiz. - gas.

124
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,235
kaiz. - kaiz.

125
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:54,570
got it. he got it finally. - stop laughing. get to work.

126
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,401
''calcuttiya, let's have the tabla.''

127
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,236
''So, where were we?
We were here.''

128
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,736
laila said that - - what?

129
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:12,737
don't throw stones at my lover.

130
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,569
'what's this, bhola? why are you dressed like this?''

131
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:40,070
where have you been? - it isn't raining. how're you wet?

132
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,570
did someone pick a fight with you? - did someone beat you?

133
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:49,236
did someone push you around? - speak up. what happened?

134
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:52,902
lt wasn't a he. it was a she.

135
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,234
She?

136
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,902
'who was she, bhola? she wasn't a vision, was she?''

137
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:18,737
she sure was. l was thrown.

138
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:23,236
but who is this girl who overthrew this bachelor?

139
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,901
A girl.

140
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,567
A girl?

141
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:34,068
what's her name? - where does she live?

142
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,902
l don't know that.

143
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:45,904
''but someday...somewhere... - guru, bhola's done for!''

144
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,571
a beautiful face! a picture of loveliness!

145
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,403
Her eyes seemed to smile!

146
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,903
''sir, you've been gazing at this photo since yesterday.''

147
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,071
some faces make such an impact on you.

148
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:19,070
l've decided to make her my bride.

149
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,905
but if her parents don't agree - - how can they not?

150
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:29,737
''besides, l'm no less than prithviraj chauhan.''

151
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,568
don't l have a horse?

152
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,902
but.. - but what?

153
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,734
suppose bhola objects?

154
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:42,404
odd isn't it? l'll send him on his way.

155
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,402
''uncle, you plan to send me o_, do you?''

156
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,901
'Well, l'm o_ on my own.
- Where to, son?''

157
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,736
to my aunt's house. where else? - which aunt do you mean?

158
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,901
The one who's going to come
to this house.

159
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,067
what are you talking about? what aunt?

160
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,068
''don't treat me like a child, uncle.''

161
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:01,402
l know what's going on. l'm 26 years old now.

162
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,068
you're planning to mary again at this age.

163
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,901
and a young girl at that! you gaze at her picture and sing.

164
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,567
'well, look at this. read what's written here.''

165
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,234
what's written in here?

166
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:13,569
up to the age of 25 a man should be a bachelor.

167
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,901
from 25 to 50 he should lead a family life.

168
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:18,401
all right. - you're an old man of 60.

169
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:22,569
how dare you? l'm only 45.

170
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,068
so you plan to mary for only 5 years.

171
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,401
who's marying again?

172
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:30,235
you are. l'm neither blind nor deaf.

173
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,067
''l hear eveything, l see eveything that goes on.''

174
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,234
what do you want?

175
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,736
''just one thing, uncle. come to a compromise with my aunt.''

176
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,400
ask her to come back.

177
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,734
you want me to come to an agreement with your aunt?

178
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,068
l haven't seen her for 5 years.

179
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:49,569
''l'm a rajput. when l leave someone, it's for keeps.''

180
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,401
but l'm a rajput too.

181
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,737
how can l turn my back on the aunt who brought me up?

182
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,068
l'll live with her.

183
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:00,902
you can mary again if you like. bring a band or whatever.

184
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,569
she'll become a widow the moment she sees your face.

185
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:31,070
''hey, bhola, is that you? how are you?''

186
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:37,906
''l'll take that. ma'am, bhola's here.''

187
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,234
''bhola, it's you.''

188
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,401
''l bow to you, aunt. - may you live long.''

189
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:49,403
'why this luggage? your uncle's well, isn't he?''

190
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:52,735
him? he's getting younger day by day.

191
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,067
what are you saying?

192
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,069
the truth. that's why l've ieft his house and come here.

193
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,235
but who'll look after him?

194
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:04,070
someone's on her way there - to look after him. a new aunt.

195
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,071
oh l see. so he's bitten by that bug again.

196
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:14,236
a young girl at that. how could l stand that?

197
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,402
that my aunt's place be taken by some young witch.

198
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,068
why are you so upset?

199
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:26,906
your uncle's always been that way. but look at you.

200
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,901
your blood relation is with your uncle.

201
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,401
yet you've always supported me.

202
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:38,404
don't wory. l have my share of my father's property.

203
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,736
'you and l can manage just fine on that, like a mother and son.''

204
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,735
''but, aunt, what's got into my uncle? at this age -''

205
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:50,737
forget about him.

206
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:54,402
''come on. go, wash. l'll make some tea for you.''

207
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:55,566
All right.

208
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,234
'wow, madho!''

209
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:17,402
my aunt has kept this room exactly as l left it.

210
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,736
''she always hopes you'll come. let it be, l'll do it.''

211
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,567
madho kaka - yes?

212
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,734
'the house opposite was always vacant, wasn't it?''

213
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,402
yes. but there's a new tenant now. since a month or two ago

214
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,735
a husband and wife. they have a daughter too.

215
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,235
but we haven't much dealing with them.

216
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:47,903
there's a bucket of water. wash your hands.

217
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,233
All right.

218
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:57,069
''hmm. a man, a woman and their daughter.''

219
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,734
what's it to me?

220
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:09,236
''bless you, aunt.''

221
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,567
'what are you listening to, bhola?''

222
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,734
''nothing, aunt. nothing at all.''

223
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,738
that's all she does day and night. she either sings or dances.

224
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,402
''But, Aunt, who is she?''

225
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,067
Some new people.

226
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,402
the parents are simple folk. but the girl is a frisky one.

227
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,068
eternally singing.

228
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:06,234
did you hear what she was singing?

229
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,902
she's a young thing. shouldn't she be preparing for marriage?

230
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:13,569
lnstead she's fooling around this way.

231
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:18,234
why did you cover his face?

232
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,236
let it stay that way. l don't like to see his face any more.

233
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:29,404
''Once you're upset, th,,ere's no
stopping you.

234
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,568
your tea's getting cold.

235
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,234
''Hey, you monkey!''

236
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,072
'yes, nymph? - you've followed me here, have you?''

237
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,234
lt's you who's following me.

238
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,235
why did you rent the house opposite my aunt's?

239
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:11,069
tell me first - why was that old woman criticizing me?

240
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:14,402
she doesn't even know me. how dare she criticize me?

241
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,735
what does she know that the frisky number is you.

242
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,735
Frisky? Me?

243
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,905
''lf you don't like frisky, we could call you fast.''

244
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,735
Listen well.

245
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,234
lf you want to live here you'd better look to your manners.

246
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,401
You needn't peep into my house.

247
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,567
whether l dance or sing - it has nothing to do with you.

248
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,567
as you please.

249
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,068
you can dance or sing. l won't say a thing.

250
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,734
l'll just watch the fun.

251
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,070
''lndeed? so you'll watch the fun, will you?''

252
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,568
okay. then take a look at this too.

253
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,234
what does it look like to you? - a broom.

254
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:58,235
And this?
- Shoes.

255
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:01,735
what use can they be put to? - l don't know.

256
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,568
You don't. l'll tell you.

257
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,403
''lf you dare talk about me, l'll flay you with these.''

258
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:16,404
may god hasten that day. - he will. vey soon.

259
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:26,404
''gosh, she's quite a fireball. but she is one of a kind!''

260
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,233
Guru!

261
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:38,237
''speak, girl. what is your problem?''

262
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:42,070
''guru, this is my husband.''

263
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:46,403
he married me but since that day...

264
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:51,571
l haven't been satisfied.

265
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:56,403
what can l do? my work starts only after sunset.

266
00:31:56,733 --> 00:32:01,404
l understand. you're a thief.

267
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:06,737
you can read minds. you know eveything.

268
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:11,236
what doesn't a man do for the sake of his belly?

269
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:17,069
Who's this troubled child?

270
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,402
l'm a thug from benaras.

271
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:27,070
but l distribute half my loot among the poor.

272
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:32,069
l've even built two temples.

273
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:36,570
gloy to my guru! may he live long!

274
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,701
may you have a long life.

275
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,069
But tell me - why do you
disturb me now?

276
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,235
'what can l say, guru? l had to come and see you.''

277
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:48,068
l see. Tell me -

278
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,068
have you found out anything about that girl?

279
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,903
l found out. And l met her too
- Found her? Where?

280
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:58,903
let's go. we'll go and talk to her.

281
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,069
l'll be ruined. what will become of my play?

282
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:20,402
to hell with your play. - the audience will eat me alive

283
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,235
'Tell me, where did you find
the girl?''

284
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:35,905
''right next door to my aunt. - gosh, you're made!''

285
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:37,567
You met her?

286
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,734
l met her and l quarrelled with her too.

287
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:42,736
she threatened to hit me with a broom and a shoe.

288
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,567
what's so funny about that?

289
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,569
she threatened me but she didn't hit me.

290
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:52,403
things are getting serious. we have to sort them out.

291
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:57,404
until we meet this girl you mustn't fall in love with her.

292
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,901
then why the delay? let's go right now.

293
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:13,234
checkmate. - who says checkmate?

294
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,067
''oh, bindu, you've arrived.''

295
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,901
where did you pick up that piece of wood?

296
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:21,067
this isn't just a piece of wood.

297
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,236
lt's the college trophy for
the music contests.

298
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,901
your daughter won it!

299
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:29,402
vey good. whose daughter are you anyway?

300
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,236
good. no one ever defeats your father in chess.

301
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:37,070
you always win in chess. show me some other victoy too.

302
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,403
'Why? When l won you,
l won the world.''

303
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:42,566
really?

304
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:46,403
l've been married to you for 25 years. isn't that something?

305
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,568
Huh. You'll never improve.

306
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,067
how can you talk like this in front of your daughter?

307
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,569
enough fun. you must think of her marriage.

308
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,236
Don't you see how quickly
she's growing up?

309
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,067
you're right. someone has put it so well -

310
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,735
'when a thing is meant to be, it happens.''

311
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,734
bhola? - guru?

312
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,401
When will this window open?

313
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:30,069
''guru, one has to be patient in love.''

314
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,067
''Guru, there she is.''

315
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,235
''Gosh, how hot it is!''

316
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,068
''radha, open this window.''

317
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:58,904
what are you doing? can't you look where you're going?

318
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,402
go. make me some tea. l'll pick this up.

319
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,234
no work. just airs.

320
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,901
She's lovely.

321
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:16,235
a complexion like peaches and cream!

322
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,402
'what do you think, guru?''

323
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,070
what a girl you've chosen!

324
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:29,736
lf you send her to the battlefield....

325
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,902
the enemy will drop their weapons and surrender.

326
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:52,235
raven black tresses.

327
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,568
beautiful. - what a girl!

328
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,067
Quiet. Quiet.

329
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,734
you mustn't gaze at your future sister-in-law like that.

330
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:02,901
from today you must all be like lakshman.

331
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,066
Yes. Done.

332
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:08,736
Her height suits yours.

333
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,736
''So, we'll look good together,
won't we?''

334
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,569
your master has arrived.

335
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:20,234
Bring him in.

336
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,735
'who's the master? - how do l know, guru?''

337
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:29,568
must be a tailor master come for measurements.

338
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,233
Devi!

339
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,071
'this floor is low in places, high in places.''

340
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:44,069
''lf it were level, l wouldn't have fallen.''

341
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,904
you're early. - early? l'm vey late.

342
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:54,236
l've been waiting for it to be 5 o'clock.

343
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,567
the minute hand just wouldn't move.

344
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,901
didn't you have any other tuitions today?

345
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:04,572
how can l take other tuitions? one tuition keeps me busy.

346
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:09,570
even at home l keep thinking of you.

347
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:14,236
'When l meet other girls,
l see you in them.''

348
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:18,403
even in my mother's photo l see only your face.

349
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:22,235
Even in his mother's photo?
The idiot.

350
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,734
Useless bloke.
- Donkey.

351
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:31,405
''bhola, he's no tailor master. looks like a blu_ master.''

352
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,400
l'll be a match for him.

353
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,736
l'll play the drums on his bald head.

354
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,233
till l make him a band master.

355
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:45,904
this is a serious matter. vey serious.

356
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,568
we'll have to proceed with caution.

357
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,567
Don't you see?

358
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:55,403
how coy bindu is acting with him.

359
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:05,405
when you bite your finger and iook at the sky...

360
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,237
...l remember the time l first saw you.

361
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,903
Do you remember too?
- Yes.

362
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,901
You do?

363
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,404
l'd invited you home for
dinner once.

364
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,571
you asked me to teach you to dance.

365
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,901
then you sang a song.

366
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,070
l taught you the dance gestures for it.

367
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:43,234
''sing that song for me, please.''

368
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,903
''Me? Sing for you?
No, no.''

369
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,567
Why don't you sing?

370
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:55,737
shall l? that song? do you like it?

371
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,235
l like it vey much.
- Oh my!

372
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,066
Bindu.

373
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,234
''Sing, will you?
- Yes. l will''

374
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:55,570
''oh dear, l went wrong. l ought to sing in hindi.''

375
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:51,401
How did you like the song?
- l liked it.

376
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,568
'You liked it?
- Yes, l did.''

377
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,234
Go. O_ with you.

378
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,901
let's eat something.

379
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:17,234
''oh, so he's a dance master.''

380
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:19,902
lt's going to be the dance of death.

381
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:25,237
the one you love is already dancing around with someone else.

382
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:29,737
''lt's a case of ''''house full'' ''already. forget it.''

383
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,904
''guru, won't you say anything? - yes, l surely will.''

384
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,066
then say it.

385
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:42,737
are we accepting defeat at the hands of a dance master?

386
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:46,735
so what if the girl is romantic and forward.

387
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,234
but she comes from a good family.

388
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:54,237
this is the kind of girl one should fall in love with.

389
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:56,567
''bhola, don't lose heart.''

390
00:45:56,567 --> 00:46:00,236
''no, l won't. l'm 26, by your grace.''

391
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,734
lf you say the word -

392
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:05,902
l'll even break a bow if l have to.

393
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,233
Good.

394
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,901
o you 5 jewels of the five jewel theatre company -

395
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,068
'we're all united. - yes, we are.''

396
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:15,903
together we have to defeat this dance master.

397
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,567
we have to - defeat him!

398
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,234
we have to - defeat him.

399
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,735
''devi, allow me to,,recite some verse.

400
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,236
l ask nothing of you. l seek nothing of you.

401
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,736
may your youth be eternal. what don't l feel for you.

402
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:53,402
'these sorromul looks, this pain tinged smile,''

403
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,569
no one else in your group reflects your beauty.

404
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,234
the verse is beautiful.

405
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,234
but do you understand its meaning?

406
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:04,069
yes. l do. it's quite a tiger of a poem.

407
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:07,235
but don't ask the meaning. sit down.

408
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:12,901
Listen.

409
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,067
you are careful to keep your distance

410
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,401
but l am sure of one thing -

411
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,234
lt is l who reside in your heart.

412
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:25,401
Nobody but me.

413
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,401
''Devi, listen.''

414
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,236
'where are you o_ to, bindu? listen to me. listen to my verse.''

415
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:49,735
''master, you're getting too romantic today.''

416
00:47:49,735 --> 00:47:51,401
'you see, the circumstances are such.''

417
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:56,404
l saw a dream last night. - a dream? me too.

418
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,568
did you see me in your dream?

419
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,569
l'll tell you later. first tell me - what did you see?

420
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,570
''bindu, l saw - - master, keep your hands o_ me.''

421
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:08,567
''bindu, l saw -''

422
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:14,237
''far away from the earth, on the horizon...''

423
00:48:14,566 --> 00:48:16,567
A little nest.

424
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,570
A nest? A bird's nest?
- A bird's nest. A little nest.

425
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,568
l was sitting in it.

426
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:25,402
you were sitting in a small bird's nest?

427
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,569
''master, you'd need a bu_alo's stable.''

428
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,901
who laughed?

429
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,234
the gods laughed at your joke.

430
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:37,567
''Bindu, do listen.''

431
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,902
''devi, you must hear about my dream.''

432
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:45,403
l put my head out of the nest and said -

433
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,401
''Bindu, Bindu.''

434
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:53,570
'then, another bird came and perched on the branch.''

435
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:59,403
lt spoke too. do you know what it said?

436
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:03,402
i ''lt said - master pillai master pillai.''

437
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,903
''and l said - l'm here, l'm here.''

438
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:14,072
'then l called to the bird: come, come here.''

439
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:16,567
lt stepped into my nest.

440
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,570
and then a little bit of billing and cooing.

441
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,236
beak met with beak.

442
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:28,569
Like this. Devi -
Ouch!

443
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:33,401
what a ticklish tree! bindu!

444
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,902
''bindu, l'll catch up with you.''

445
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,068
Why do you run?

446
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,567
bhola. - guru.

447
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,905
''do you understand what you saw? - do you want the truth, guru?''

448
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,235
l only saw bindu's face before me.

449
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:05,070
l neither heard nor understood anything.

450
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:09,570
l'll tell you. the master's after bindu with a vengeance.

451
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:13,235
you stupid man. anyone can see that.

452
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:18,236
but the point is - what is it about the master...

453
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:21,402
...that makes her dance to his tune?

454
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,234
Quiet. Quiet.

455
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:35,240
we've concluded that bindu isn't attracted to his looks.

456
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,400
Then?

457
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,402
''lf at all, she's interested in his art.''

458
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:40,152
mR_

459
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:45,235
his music and his dance.

460
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:47,401
''guru, why don't you teach bhola to sing?''

461
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:49,234
''certainly. how about it, bhola?''

462
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:55,069
l'm already 26. l'll learn it in a jim.

463
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,903
why delay a good thing?

464
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,737
'we'll start immediately, in the morning.''

465
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,901
\N__.

466
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,234
Silence. Silence. Silence.

467
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:24,069
''bhola, the first n,o, te in music is sa.

468
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,734
''guru, wait.''

469
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:28,235
''bhola, you haven't given your guru any o_ering.''

470
00:51:28,566 --> 00:51:31,235
''Oh, l quite forgot.
- Give it now.''

471
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:36,904
here you are. - bless you.

472
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,570
''bhola, sing just as l do. get it?''

473
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,234
ready?

474
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:56,902
Go on.
- Don't be shy.

475
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:07,235
''no, bhola. not like that. listen.''

476
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:16,734
wrong at the vey start.

477
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,567
''bhola? - yes, guru?''

478
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:27,239
there's nothing to it. don't be afraid.

479
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:39,735
do you hear that? l'll sing. then you can follow me.

480
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:45,234
Go on. Sing.

481
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,234
''bhola, take it lower down.''

482
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,235
''l told you - lower, lower.''

483
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:14,904
''Lower down!
- Guru, lower down. Here.''

484
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:22,403
what are you doing down there?

485
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,401
you asked me to take it lower.

486
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,070
You fool. Sit up here.
Lower your pitch.

487
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:34,734
come. take it easy.

488
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,901
listen carefully.

489
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,234
Sing it.

490
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:07,902
Not here. It's over there.

491
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,234
what's so funny about it?

492
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:24,070
the donkey has a better voice than he does.

493
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,901
why don't you go and teach him?

494
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,234
'Who me?
- Yes, you. Go on.''

495
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,567
go on. move on. what's so funny?

496
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,235
''calcuttiya, o_ with you.''

497
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,902
''lahori, out! - yes.''

498
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:48,904
ls that better? they've all gone.

499
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:52,067
'yes, guru. - then, shall we start?''

500
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,735
Yes.
- Vey good.

501
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,402
re. not ra.

502
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:24,069
bhola. hold that note. ty to get the right note.

503
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:26,067
again.

504
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:49,402
''bhola! - no, l can't do it. l can't.''

505
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,402
''benarsi, lahori, come here quickly.''

506
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:00,402
get some water. get the pot of water.

507
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,403
put the fan on. give him some water.

508
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,903
'wonde_ul, wonde_ul! l have an idea.''

509
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,402
''bhola, l've got it. l've found the way.''

510
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:52,567
'what, guru? tell us.''

511
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,068
''Silence, silence, silence.''

512
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:58,235
''caluttiya, give me a betel leaf. good.''

513
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:05,070
''bhola, do you remember the words of any film song?''

514
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:07,901
'Yes, l do.
- Go on, sing.''

515
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,234
come on. don't be embarrassed.

516
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:15,069
''o lover about to leave me. - wonde_ul, wonde_ul.''

517
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,567
o lover about to leave me.

518
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:21,735
''bhola, l'll sing this song.''

519
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:23,233
all you have to do is move your lips.

520
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:25,568
Just your lips. As if you
were singing.

521
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:28,401
My voice. Your presence.

522
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:34,402
My voice. Your presence.
Do you get it?

523
00:57:34,402 --> 00:57:36,234
'Yes, l get it.''

524
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,736
''o lover about to leave me,''

525
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,735
come back to me.

526
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:12,402
''are you ready, bhola? - yes. no, just give me a minute.''

527
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,401
Well done.

528
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,735
''bhola, do exactly what l've told you.''

529
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:25,234
'Yes, guru.
- Don't forget.''

530
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:27,401
l won't.
- Come on.

531
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,402
but there's no one at the window.

532
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,734
lf there were someone at the window -

533
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:34,234
would we have to resort to all this?

534
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:35,901
Get it?
- Yes.

535
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:41,237
''My Bindu will come, won't she?
- Yes, she will. Definitely.''

536
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,236
''bhola, has she come to the window?''

537
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:14,067
ls she looking at you?

538
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:22,234
does she want to talk to you?

539
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,402
Then close the shutters.
Close them.

540
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:33,901
No.
- Yes.

541
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,234
You idiot!

542
01:02:37,566 --> 01:02:39,567
get back in. come back.

543
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,401
such arrogance!

544
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,903
l only smiled at him - now he's on his high horse.

545
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,401
l can do what l want - laugh or cough.

546
01:03:01,066 --> 01:03:03,067
that doesn't mean that l -

547
01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:10,067
thinks himself a great singer does he?

548
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:12,568
he's not worth even the dust at my master's shoes.

549
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:18,403
l'll teach you such a lesson that you'll forget your notes.

550
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:23,067
''did you hear that? oh gosh, we've messed things up.''

551
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,568
She'd come to the window so sweetly.

552
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,402
''she gazed into my eyes, wanting to talk to me.''

553
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:33,738
''And you closed the shutters.
Now she's gone o_, sulking.''

554
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:37,133
''60, 70, a0,...''

555
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:44,902
''... 90, 100.''

556
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,569
how many did you count? - a round 100.

557
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:56,738
l can do a 100 push-ups. but l'm still single.

558
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:59,736
Not single. A widower.

559
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:02,736
how can you call me a widower? bhola's aunt is still alive.

560
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:05,735
odd isn't it? l spent 2 years with her.

561
01:04:05,735 --> 01:04:07,234
But there were no children.

562
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,401
''l'm as good as a bachelor, aren't l?''

563
01:04:10,566 --> 01:04:13,402
here he comes. radha krishna.

564
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,568
radha krishna.

565
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:20,070
you keep uttering god's name

566
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,568
why can't you find a decent proposal for me?

567
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:28,071
what do you know? wherever l hear of a young girl -

568
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:33,237
l'm on her track. now after many days l see a ray of hope.

569
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,235
'you are? - in this vey city,...''

570
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:38,235
... lives the daughter of my old client.

571
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:43,070
But l need to show them your photo.

572
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,401
My photo?

573
01:04:46,233 --> 01:04:51,071
''hazoori, go and get that photo of mine.''

574
01:04:51,071 --> 01:04:53,234
'which one, sir? - you know, that one.''

575
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,236
have you only got her address so far?

576
01:04:59,236 --> 01:05:02,569
you can take it the wedding's fixed.

577
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,235
But remember this -

578
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,568
lf it doesn't work out
this time -

579
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:09,667
you'll have to leave this town.

580
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:12,067
say your goodbyes - ram ram.

581
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:13,901
''no, l'm better o_ with radha krishna.''

582
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,569
''Odd, isn't it?
All right. Come here.''

583
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:33,568
bhola. - what is it?

584
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:36,901
''guru, that day you closed the shutters.''

585
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,903
since then he hasn't seen bindu at all.

586
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:48,905
you idiot. get up. why are you so upset?

587
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:51,234
''Look, vey soon you'll see -''

588
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:55,236
the girl will cary her heart on her sleeve.

589
01:05:55,236 --> 01:05:57,401
she'll sigh and fall at your feet.

590
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,069
do you know what she'll say? - what?

591
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,901
''My innocent lover,''

592
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:27,234
''my dear lover,''

593
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,735
Without you my life

594
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:35,904
ls like a lamp without oil.

595
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,069
my life is like a garden

596
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,238
from which the pe_ume has fled.

597
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,235
make me yours.

598
01:06:54,235 --> 01:06:58,237
''bhola, make me yours.''

599
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:05,406
my love is at your feet. my whole world lies there.

600
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,736
''guru, when she says this... how shall l reply?''

601
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:24,734
Reply?

602
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:31,237
'you nut, when you're in love... answers emerge naturally.''

603
01:07:31,566 --> 01:07:33,401
say - anuradha..

604
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:37,736
''guru, not anuradha. it's bindu! bindu.''

605
01:07:38,233 --> 01:07:40,234
''Oh, yes. l forgot.''

606
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,902
say this - - what?

607
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,737
''my dear bindu, my innocent bindu,''

608
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,403
'the bindu on the forehead, the sindoor bindu,''

609
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:57,234
''My Bindu,''

610
01:07:57,566 --> 01:08:01,736
the boat of my love is caught in a whirlpool.

611
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:05,737
help me across.

612
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:18,905
put your arms around me and sway with me in love.

613
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,903
you are the hope of my life. read the love in my eyes.

614
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:36,403
''place me in your heart, conceal me in your eyes.''

615
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:41,904
come quickly. light a lamp in this dark world of mine.

616
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:45,236
make it bright for me.

617
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:53,453
Bindu!

618
01:09:40,566 --> 01:09:42,067
bhola! - guru!

619
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:44,401
You've hit bullseye!
- Guru!

620
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:48,133
how uneasy she is.

621
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:57,235
like a fish out of water.

622
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:04,904
''guru, shall l raise the blinds? - yes, do. let the fresh air in.''

623
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:07,902
wait. listen to me first.

624
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:16,400
ready? - ready.

625
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,567
Then whistle. Go on.

626
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,901
what's this? can't you whistle? l'll do it.

627
01:10:41,066 --> 01:10:42,233
namaste.

628
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:50,402
l addressed you. namaste.

629
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:53,900
''nevertheless, namaste.''

630
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:04,903
''master, where have you been?''

631
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:08,569
l haven't seen you for a week. l've been so upset.

632
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:11,402
you were upset? on my account?

633
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:14,568
l'd gone to rameshwar.

634
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:16,734
''l'm back now. l went to the temple, o_ered some fruit.''

635
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:18,901
what fruit? what kind of fruit?

636
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:23,069
why did you have to go there? - l'm sory. l won't do it again.

637
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:25,401
''lf l ever go again, l'll take you with me.''

638
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:30,070
come. take up the harmonium. l'm in the mood for a song.

639
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,238
why music? let's talk a while. we can sing later.

640
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:39,068
hell with your talk. sing first.

641
01:11:39,068 --> 01:11:44,237
can he sing? send him to the temple to ring the bell.

642
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,068
what bell?

643
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:51,235
my name is bhola.

644
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:53,734
bhola? namaste.

645
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,569
just a minute. close the window.

646
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,235
why? - this guy keeps staring at you.

647
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,570
let him. let him listen too. let him find out what music is.

648
01:12:07,233 --> 01:12:09,234
thinks he's tansen!

649
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:12,401
ls that so?

650
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:16,402
''bhola, come. come and sing.''

651
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,235
No. You go. l sing.

652
01:12:19,566 --> 01:12:24,570
who do you think you are. l'll make mincemeat of you.

653
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:29,236
don't just make noise. l'll show you what music is.

654
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:33,234
come on. get ready.

655
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:48,902
give me the harmonium.

656
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:53,567
turn that side!

657
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,801
there's something wrong here. his pitch has suddenly changed.

658
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,401
Where's the note?

659
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:08,234
l won't give up.

660
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:12,902
this clever woman

661
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,901
l'll hold on.

662
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:20,235
she insinuates herself into my heart.

663
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:22,234
l die for her!

664
01:16:24,233 --> 01:16:27,402
this clever woman makes herself beautiful.

665
01:18:30,066 --> 01:18:31,901
a clever horse? what is this?

666
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:36,235
stick to the lines. either say horse or clever. sing.

667
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,904
a vey good idea to put the radio on.

668
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,568
why are you afraid?

669
01:19:42,233 --> 01:19:44,902
This is our victoy. Our
second victoy.

670
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,736
chess again! when will you think of family matters?

671
01:20:04,736 --> 01:20:06,735
lt is bindu's exam today.

672
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,901
why didn't you call the driver to come early?

673
01:20:09,733 --> 01:20:11,734
Bindu's mother!

674
01:20:11,734 --> 01:20:14,569
'when a thing is meant to be, it happens.''

675
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:17,402
l'm sick of your
philosophising.

676
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:45,568
bad boy. why did you let the cat cross her path?

677
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:50,403
who knows - it might be important work.

678
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:53,569
''lf a cat crosses, it could bring bad luck.''

679
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:57,569
why don't you say anything? l'll give you one.

680
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,735
well done. here are two 25 paisa coins.

681
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:10,236
drink some milk. give some to the cat too.

682
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:44,569
only 5 minutes left. check your papers.

683
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:25,235
''bindu, child! how did today's exam go?''

684
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,234
Bindu!

685
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:34,069
l think bindu will fail this year too.

686
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:37,568
good. at least it will make you think of her marriage.

687
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:39,734
Bindu's mother!

688
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:45,237
l insist we get her married this year. here.

689
01:22:58,233 --> 01:23:02,070
until 25 a man should be bachelor.

690
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:06,402
from 25 to 50 he should be a family man.

691
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,402
50 to 75: vanaprasthashram.

692
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:12,568
75 onwards - sanyas.

693
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:17,237
l can hardly become a sanyasi. l'm only 26.

694
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:20,234
Listen.

695
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:23,901
you? did you call me?

696
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:28,568
Are you studying?
- Yes.

697
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:34,737
how was your exam? - vey good. it was so easy.

698
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:38,569
l need to ask a favour of you.

699
01:23:40,899 --> 01:23:42,234
Me?
- Yes.

700
01:23:42,234 --> 01:23:44,568
can you come down for a while?

701
01:23:46,066 --> 01:23:48,568
Down? To your house?

702
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:54,071
''No. Down - to my door.
You will come, won't you?''

703
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:58,235
Why not? Of course l will.

704
01:23:58,235 --> 01:24:01,903
shall l come right now? - do come. please.

705
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:04,401
All right. l'm coming.

706
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,902
''bindu, here l am. what can l do for you?''

707
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:19,567
Do tell me.

708
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:25,402
shame on you. go drown yourself.

709
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:31,236
''Do you see this, Guru?
Look up.''

710
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:35,236
why are you so low today?

711
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:38,736
you allowed a girl to slap you. aren't you ashamed?

712
01:24:38,736 --> 01:24:42,069
you may as well wear a dress and sit at home.

713
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:44,401
you've demeaned the panchratna theatre company.

714
01:24:44,633 --> 01:24:46,634
Quiet. Quiet.

715
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:56,401
bhola. - guru.

716
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:00,903
you have to respond in kind.

717
01:25:02,566 --> 01:25:04,567
until you give that girl...

718
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,569
an even harder slap -

719
01:25:08,899 --> 01:25:10,901
you can't hold your head up.

720
01:25:11,233 --> 01:25:15,904
''slap bindu? no, guru. l can't do that.''

721
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:17,901
'yes, you can.''

722
01:25:17,901 --> 01:25:23,070
lmagine you're arjun. guru is krishna...

723
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:25,567
... giving you direction.

724
01:25:26,233 --> 01:25:30,737
arjun agreed to take arms against his relations ...

725
01:25:30,737 --> 01:25:32,901
...because krishna told him to.

726
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:36,235
''ln the same way, you will have to...''

727
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:41,404
...mark bindu's tender cheeks with a slap.

728
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:48,736
slap bindu?

729
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,234
with these hands? - yes.

730
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:57,904
''guru, her fair skin will redden with the slap, won't it?''

731
01:25:58,233 --> 01:25:59,233
certainly.

732
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:01,235
''lt'll hurt her too, won't it?
- Correct.''

733
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:03,568
then l won't do it. l can't.

734
01:26:04,233 --> 01:26:08,570
Think it over.
Think well.

735
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:12,735
you have only 2 alternatives.

736
01:26:13,899 --> 01:26:15,901
either you slap bindu.

737
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:18,401
or else our friendship is at an end.

738
01:26:18,401 --> 01:26:20,567
'what do you say, friends? - absolutely.''

739
01:26:20,567 --> 01:26:23,902
''but, guru, what shall l do? l love her.''

740
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,233
but l want your friendship too.

741
01:26:25,233 --> 01:26:30,738
she's one. we're 4. will you forsake 4 of us for her?

742
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:33,234
speak up.

743
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:36,401
speak. bhola?

744
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:44,903
''no, guru. l will slap her. - well spoken!''

745
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:44,134
master! master!

746
01:27:45,466 --> 01:27:48,635
devi! these days l hear your voice in my heart.

747
01:27:48,635 --> 01:27:50,801
ln your heart? l'm here.

748
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:55,637
How do you come to be here?
l'm not dressed.

749
01:27:55,637 --> 01:28:00,137
l'm dying of embarrassment. - forget that.

750
01:28:00,137 --> 01:28:05,304
come into the garden with me. - garden? why? let's stay in my hut.

751
01:28:05,304 --> 01:28:07,134
l'll tell you later. please come.

752
01:28:07,134 --> 01:28:09,635
all right. turn aside. let me get dressed.

753
01:28:09,635 --> 01:28:11,801
go ahead. l'll be with you in a minute.

754
01:28:13,133 --> 01:28:14,634
''Devi.
- Come on, will you?''

755
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:19,134
Come on. Quickly.

756
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:23,302
l'll do whatever you want me to.

757
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:37,305
my parents in heaven will be so happy to see us together.

758
01:28:37,633 --> 01:28:39,301
to hell with your parents.

759
01:28:39,301 --> 01:28:42,635
You're right. They must be in hell.

760
01:28:42,966 --> 01:28:46,969
they committed a lot of sins. l met an astrologer.

761
01:28:46,969 --> 01:28:49,802
he said today would be good for me.

762
01:28:50,133 --> 01:28:51,467
give me your hand.

763
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,135
but he told me l'd have a bad day.

764
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:56,634
why's that? - look behind you.

765
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,968
there's only a fountain behind me. - a thug!

766
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,469
A thug? Where?
- Here.

767
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,802
''oh, him. that's not a thug.''

768
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,134
that's bhola. you've forgotten him.

769
01:29:11,466 --> 01:29:14,302
He lives opposite you.

770
01:29:14,302 --> 01:29:16,801
he sings vey well. he quite defeated me that day.

771
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:22,137
this is the thug who's been stalking me for days.

772
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:25,635
that's why l've brought you here. do something about him.

773
01:29:25,635 --> 01:29:26,595
But how?

774
01:29:28,633 --> 01:29:32,470
l'm a dance master. not a la_er.

775
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,968
lf l take the law into my own hands...

776
01:29:34,968 --> 01:29:37,301
...l'll be thrown into jail for 6 months.

777
01:29:37,301 --> 01:29:41,303
are you a man or not? - a man? of course.

778
01:29:41,303 --> 01:29:46,137
lf someone dares to look upon the girl you love...

779
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:48,634
what would you do? - l'd be happy.

780
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,136
lt's a wonde_ul thing to iook at a beauty.

781
01:29:52,466 --> 01:29:55,135
'what a nut you are. you are a hindu, aren't you?''

783
01:29:57,635 --> 01:29:58,800
'yes, l have.''

784
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,968
'when ravan abducted sita, what did ram do?''

785
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:05,636
ram took hanuman's army to lanka

786
01:30:05,636 --> 01:30:08,469
''he gave him such a beating, such a guillotine chop.''

787
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:10,634
can't you do that to this man?

788
01:30:10,634 --> 01:30:14,637
ls that it? why didn't you say so?

789
01:30:14,637 --> 01:30:16,801
ls he like ravan? - yes.

790
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:18,801

just watch me. l'll give him good.

792
01:30:25,466 --> 01:30:27,801
ravan! come here.

793
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:54,470
''bhola, you defeated me in song. - yes.''

794
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:59,803
can you defeat me in a fight? - l'll break your head.

795
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,801
break my head? - yes.

796
01:31:03,133 --> 01:31:05,134
you'll break my head? - yes.

797
01:31:05,134 --> 01:31:06,467
you'll break it? - yes.

798
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:08,634
but why do you want to fight?

799
01:31:09,633 --> 01:31:12,135
''lt's not good to fight, you know, bhola.''

800
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,867
You're right.

801
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:17,135
''look, a boy and girl are walking in a garden.''

802
01:31:17,466 --> 01:31:21,636
Why should you disturb them?
- Shut up. l'll kill you.

803
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:23,967

Don't come closer.

You will?

''ln that case, l'll move back.''

''how will you move back? l have muscles, you know.''

01:31:34,133 --> 01:31:36,134
l'll throw you back.

810
01:31:39,466 --> 01:31:41,968
'what happened, master? - nothing.''

811
01:31:42,633 --> 01:31:45,802
bhola has a muscular body.

812
01:31:45,802 --> 01:31:49,969
''he's tough. l'm delicate. you know, girls are delicate.''

813

that's how l am. but don't you wory.

01:31:55,466 --> 01:31:57,467
l won't leave him alone. - get lost.

815
01:31:57,966 --> 01:32:00,635
his idli diet makes him a weakling.

816
01:32:00,635 --> 01:32:02,635
you need a man who eats parathas.

817
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:04,634
parathas?

818
01:32:04,634 --> 01:32:07,636

l'll shut you up.
- Get lost.

826
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:19,803
'what happened? bindu, don't cy, bindu.''

l won't slap you. l won't.

828
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,636
what can l do to make you believe me?

829
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:29,634
'what shall l do, bindu?''

830
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,468
'take this, bindu,,, and cut my arm.

831
01:33:43,633 --> 01:33:45,134
you're a strange man.

832
01:33:45,134 --> 01:33:47,135
''sometimes one thing, sometimes another.''

833
01:33:47,135 --> 01:33:50,636
you were bent on slapping me and now -

834
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,301
''Bindu, don't cy.''

835
01:34:04,233 --> 01:34:06,234
''Bindu, the thing is -''

836
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,970
l didn't want to slap you. my friends forced me.

837
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:15,470
Oh? So you criticized me
to your friends?

838
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:19,303
''No, Bindu, l didn't.
l told them how l felt.''

839
01:34:19,303 --> 01:34:21,467
you're always so irritable with me.

840
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,469
one has to share my feelings with someone.

841
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:28,635
name suits you.

842
01:34:29,466 --> 01:34:30,466
really? -yes.

843
01:34:38,133 --> 01:34:39,467
Rs. 50.

844
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,801
you see that man with the girl?

845
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,635
Don't let him go.
Or else l won't let you go.

846
01:34:45,966 --> 01:34:47,467
Go on.

847
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:05,467
Let me go.

848
01:35:07,633 --> 01:35:10,635
you're hitting him too hard.

849
01:35:11,466 --> 01:35:12,800
Don't kill him.

850
01:35:17,533 --> 01:35:19,968
he's dead.

851
01:35:40,466 --> 01:35:42,467
''bindu. - yes, bhola.''

852
01:35:42,966 --> 01:35:46,636
''Bindu, you're vey cunning.''

853
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:50,967
you diverted me with your iove talk.

854
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:54,467
and got me beaten by thugs.

855
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:59,804
''no, bhola, l had no part in this, l swear.''

856
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:13,634
Look over there.

857
01:36:21,466 --> 01:36:26,137
Murder. Murder.
- Somebody's killed him.

858
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:28,467
Pick him up.

859
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:42,635
Why doesn't my child open his eyes?

860
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:47,970
he's hurt. but don't wory. he'll be awake soon.

861
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,135
ls his life in danger?

862
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:52,301
not at all. he's a healthy young man.

863
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:54,534
A little blood lost won't hurt him

864
01:36:54,866 --> 01:36:58,636
he might get a fever. do let me know of his progress.

865
01:36:59,466 --> 01:37:01,467
and give him some space.

866
01:37:01,467 --> 01:37:03,634
Let him rest.

867
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,470
lsn't it strange? he lives in our neighbourhood.

868
01:37:09,466 --> 01:37:11,634
but we've never even heard him raise his voice.

869
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:14,968
how can such a decent person make enemies?

870
01:37:15,633 --> 01:37:17,968
nobody respects decency these days.

871
01:37:20,466 --> 01:37:22,467
''bhola, my child!''

872
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,567
bhola's opening his eyes.

873
01:37:25,133 --> 01:37:27,802
''recognize me, son? look at me.''

874
01:37:34,133 --> 01:37:37,636
tell me : who attacked you?

875
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,301
'Tell us, child, tell us.''

876
01:37:41,466 --> 01:37:44,969
tell us his name. we'll call the police.

877
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:49,971
''No, no. l didn't recognize him.''

878
01:37:51,466 --> 01:37:55,636
l don't know anything.

879
01:38:48,133 --> 01:38:50,301
''daddy, daddy, get up. - what is it?''

880
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:52,134
''mummy. - what is it, bindu?''

881
01:38:52,134 --> 01:38:54,802
l can hear him groaning next door.

882
01:38:55,133 --> 01:38:58,302
''l think he's all alone. - come on, let's go and have a look.''

883
01:38:58,633 --> 01:38:59,633
You're right.

884
01:38:59,633 --> 01:39:02,135
neighbours must help each other in times of need. let's go.

885
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:13,134
what can l do? he's a stubborn boy.

886
01:39:13,466 --> 01:39:16,135
l pleaded with him to let me be near him.

887
01:39:16,466 --> 01:39:19,135
but he wouldn't listen. he sent me away.

888
01:39:21,466 --> 01:39:23,801
he has a high fever. is there a thermometer in the house?

889
01:39:24,133 --> 01:39:27,803
''no. - bindu, child, fetch a thermometer.''

890
01:39:28,133 --> 01:39:30,134
get an icebag too.

891
01:39:32,966 --> 01:39:34,467
has he eaten anything at all today?

892
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,801
just a few sips of water.

893
01:39:38,133 --> 01:39:41,469
the poor thing is feverish. you should call the doctor.

894
01:39:42,466 --> 01:39:44,134
All right.

895
01:39:44,966 --> 01:39:46,467
wait here.

896
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,802
Why do you give me the thermometer?
Put it in his mouth.

897
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,468
Go on.

898
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,801
please open your mouth.

899
01:40:10,633 --> 01:40:12,634
l need to put the thermometer in.

900
01:40:31,133 --> 01:40:33,802
the doctor has come. - how is he now? let's see.

901
01:40:36,633 --> 01:40:39,135
nothing to wory about. he was bound to get fever.

902
01:40:39,966 --> 01:40:44,136
l'll leave some medicine for him. give him one tablet evey two hours.

903
01:40:45,633 --> 01:40:47,634
But...
- There's no need to wory.

904
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:50,469
but he needs nursing. shall l send a nurse?

905
01:40:51,133 --> 01:40:53,635
there's no need. we're all here to help.

906
01:40:53,635 --> 01:40:56,469
our daughter is here. we'll look after him.

907
01:41:22,633 --> 01:41:24,134
Child.

908
01:41:26,966 --> 01:41:30,135
lt's morning. go home and rest.

909
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,801
you've been awake all night.

910
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:35,467
so what? - bless you.

911
01:41:36,133 --> 01:41:38,134
may god give you a wonde_ul husband.

912
01:41:38,466 --> 01:41:40,467
may he give you prosperity.

913
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:44,136
''and so many children, you'll have to take a head count.''

914
01:41:50,633 --> 01:41:52,968
the master has arrived.

915
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,134
what did you tell him?

916
01:41:58,134 --> 01:42:00,802
l told him you might not be at home.

917
01:42:01,133 --> 01:42:03,134
''good, l'm glad you said that.''

918
01:42:03,134 --> 01:42:05,301
this is his third visit since yesterday.

919
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:08,135
''so what? he gets paid, doesn't he?''

920
01:42:08,135 --> 01:42:11,136
tell him l've gone to visit my grandmother for a few days.

921
01:42:12,133 --> 01:42:15,135
all right. l'll tell him to go to his grandmother's too.

922
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,802
''a thousand thanks, krishna.''

923
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,803
the day bhola got hurt he was in a terrible state.

924
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:26,634
he's better today.

925
01:42:26,634 --> 01:42:29,135
'that's the result of your blessing, aunt.''

926
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,801
''Child, is it you?''

927
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:38,467
''He's well now, isn't he?''

928
01:42:38,467 --> 01:42:41,302
'yes, by the grace of god. have a look in.''

929
01:42:41,633 --> 01:42:43,634
he talks a bit now.

930
01:43:22,466 --> 01:43:24,467
l don't accept medicine from my enemies.

931
01:43:24,966 --> 01:43:29,303
lndeed? you've improved because you took medicine from me.

932
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:31,968
false. when did l drink medicine from your hands?

933
01:43:32,466 --> 01:43:34,467
ask your family.

934
01:43:35,133 --> 01:43:39,136
oh. l must have been unconscious.

935
01:43:39,466 --> 01:43:41,801
Yes. You were unconscious.

936
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:46,636
''l see. tell me, who put the icebag on my head last night?''

937
01:43:48,133 --> 01:43:49,467
l did.

938
01:43:50,466 --> 01:43:53,635
and who massaged my feet?

939
01:43:54,466 --> 01:43:55,633
l did.

940
01:43:55,633 --> 01:43:58,302
Who put the thermometer
into my mouth?

941
01:43:59,966 --> 01:44:01,133
me again.

942
01:44:01,133 --> 01:44:04,302
really? l thought it was my aunt.

943
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:08,636
'Well, now you know.
Now drink your medicine.''

944
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:11,301
Then l'd be obliged to my enemy.

945
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,801
how can l pay back this debt?

946
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,469
l'll tell you.
By drinking this medicine.

947
01:44:18,966 --> 01:44:21,301
drink it. or else l'll really be angy.

948
01:48:08,466 --> 01:48:12,303
'when a thing is meant to be, it happens.''

949
01:48:12,633 --> 01:48:14,801
now what? - just this -

950
01:48:15,633 --> 01:48:18,635
bindu's exam result has appeared in the papers.

951
01:48:19,466 --> 01:48:21,134
she's failed. - that's good.

952
01:48:21,466 --> 01:48:23,134
l'll distribute sweets.

953
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:28,471
why are you so upset? l'm glad l failed.

954
01:48:29,133 --> 01:48:31,301
lf l'd passed l'd have to study further.

955
01:48:31,301 --> 01:48:33,968
now l'm free! - really?

956
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:38,302
l don't want her to study further.

957
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,636
find a suitable boy and get her married.

958
01:48:42,466 --> 01:48:45,635
l agree. l'm as eager as you.

959
01:48:46,133 --> 01:48:49,970
but we must find a good match. - gloy to radha and krishna.

960
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:57,971
do you recognize me? - you appear to be a priest.

961
01:48:58,466 --> 01:49:00,467
but why don't you close your umbrella?

962
01:49:03,633 --> 01:49:05,968
ls this your wife?
- Yes.

963
01:49:06,466 --> 01:49:08,467
can l sit down here? - do sit down.

964
01:49:09,466 --> 01:49:11,467
you have nothing to wory about.

965
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,636
your brother-in-law is my client.

966
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:20,637
he told me that you're looking for a groom.

967
01:49:21,466 --> 01:49:23,134
'what? - l mean,...''

968
01:49:23,134 --> 01:49:26,469
... you're looking for a groom for your daughter.

969
01:49:28,466 --> 01:49:32,636
that's why l came to meet you. - l'm so glad you came.

970
01:49:33,466 --> 01:49:35,134
tell us about the boy's family background.

971
01:49:35,134 --> 01:49:37,468
''family? why, he's a thakur.''

972
01:49:37,468 --> 01:49:39,634
and his name is kunwar pratap singh.

973
01:49:39,966 --> 01:49:43,969
what is his age? - he's at the exercise age.

974
01:49:44,466 --> 01:49:47,969
what about his income? - income? it's vast.

975
01:49:47,969 --> 01:49:52,971
even if he spent lavishly he would still have 15-20 lakhs left.

976
01:49:54,466 --> 01:49:57,135
l've brought his photo along.

977
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,969
the photo looks rather old.

978
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:09,138
''lt's been lying in my bag for days, you see.''

979
01:50:09,633 --> 01:50:11,634
let me have a look.

980
01:50:13,133 --> 01:50:14,968
''panditji, do you approve of him?''

981
01:50:14,968 --> 01:50:18,636
don't wory. l know this family well.

982
01:50:18,966 --> 01:50:20,801
ln that case leave the photo with us.

983
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:22,634
let me seek my daughter's approval too.

984
01:50:22,634 --> 01:50:24,134
you're right. - as you please.

985
01:50:24,134 --> 01:50:26,301
l'll return in a few days.

986
01:50:33,633 --> 01:50:35,634
''Bindu, child.''

987
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:42,635
''l wanted to talk to you. - yes, mummy?''

988
01:50:42,966 --> 01:50:45,635
l've brought a photo. tell me how you like it.

989
01:50:45,635 --> 01:50:47,734
photo? - yes. have a look.

990
01:50:52,966 --> 01:50:55,301
l felt like laughing. but l couldn't quite.

991
01:50:56,133 --> 01:51:00,136
you know something? if daddy owned a film company...

992
01:51:00,966 --> 01:51:03,134
...he'd surely cast this guy as a comedian.

993
01:51:03,134 --> 01:51:05,301
lt's come with a marriage proposal for you.

994
01:51:05,301 --> 01:51:07,301
a proposal for me? - yes.

995
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:10,302
what's wrong with you? how can l mary this character?

996
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,969
why are you cying?

997
01:51:16,969 --> 01:51:20,469
l came to ask what your wishes are. - my wishes are otherwise.

998
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,468
will you stay single all your life?

999
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:29,305
why stay single? you can start getting my dowy ready.

1000
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:31,467
sure. but what about a boy?

1001
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,636
l do like someone.

1002
01:51:37,133 --> 01:51:39,635
who is that lucky guy?

1003
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,135
''l won't tell you yet.
- Tell me, child.''

1004
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:49,639
l told you - l like him. he's found a place in my heart.

1005
01:51:52,666 --> 01:51:55,468
but child - what is his family background?

1006
01:51:55,468 --> 01:51:57,634
how old is he? what's his income?

1007
01:51:57,634 --> 01:51:59,801
ls he educated or not?

1008
01:52:01,133 --> 01:52:03,134
family? he's a prince.

1009
01:52:03,466 --> 01:52:05,467
his kingdom is his innocent heart.

1010
01:52:06,133 --> 01:52:08,134
his wealth is his simplicity.

1011
01:52:08,466 --> 01:52:11,135
his age is similar to mine. as for his income -

1012
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,803
Eveyone who comes to know
him loves him.

1013
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:22,635
he has such a good heart.

1014
01:52:22,966 --> 01:52:25,134
what does it matter if he's not too well educated?

1015
01:52:25,466 --> 01:52:30,637
''even great scholars respect such people, don't they?''

1016
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:34,136
a boy of such a good character? then what else can we want?

1017
01:52:34,466 --> 01:52:36,467
''Mother!
- Bindu, child!''

1018
01:52:48,466 --> 01:52:53,637
- bindu. - what is it?

1019
01:52:54,466 --> 01:52:56,134
did you have a fight with your mother?

1020
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:58,301
''no, not at all.''

1021
01:52:59,133 --> 01:53:03,136
she found a match for me and also his photo for me to see.

1022
01:53:04,133 --> 01:53:06,802
let me see who the lucky man is.

1023
01:53:07,633 --> 01:53:09,634
want to see it? - yes.

1024
01:53:23,466 --> 01:53:25,801
what's so funny?

1025
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,803
you must mary him. you and l will still have a relationship.

1026
01:53:32,133 --> 01:53:33,300
what are you saying?

1027
01:53:33,566 --> 01:53:39,138
'yes. if you mary him, l'll be calling you ''''aunt''''.''

1028
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,137
ls this your uncle?

1029
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,802
You bet he is.
He's my mother's brother.

1030
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:51,167
haven't you noticed his photo over here?

1031
01:53:55,133 --> 01:53:56,968
Oh yes.

1032
01:53:56,968 --> 01:54:00,970
l kept wondering where l'd
seen him before.

1033
01:54:05,466 --> 01:54:07,467
My uncle!

1034
01:54:14,633 --> 01:54:20,472
My Bindu invited me to
her house. Bindu!

1035
01:54:22,133 --> 01:54:25,302
sit here. l'll be back. - yes. come soon.

1036
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:33,805
come. l want to place you in my heart.

1037
01:54:36,466 --> 01:54:39,969
''namaste, master. - bindu, l knew it.''

1038
01:54:39,969 --> 01:54:41,467
l knew you would meet me.

1039
01:54:41,467 --> 01:54:43,634
l've been longing to meet you for days.

1040
01:54:43,634 --> 01:54:48,304
l've been like a fish out of water.

1041
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:54,803
l was concerned. l went to the shrine of a saint.

1042
01:54:55,133 --> 01:54:57,468
l went to see an astrologer.

1043
01:54:58,133 --> 01:55:01,302
l went to a mosque on friday to o_er prayers.

1044
01:55:01,633 --> 01:55:03,634
on sunday morning l went to church.

1045
01:55:03,634 --> 01:55:07,136
either a muslim or a hindu or a christian -

1046
01:55:07,466 --> 01:55:09,467
some god will hear my prayers.

1047
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,470
''he's heard, he's heard. thank you, god.''

1048
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,636
''Bindu, how did you
survive so long?''

1049
01:55:16,636 --> 01:55:20,470
didn't you remember your master? tell me. why are you silent?

1050
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:23,969
lf only you'd keep quiet. then l could speak.

1051
01:55:24,466 --> 01:55:27,302
l'm sory. l got excited.

1052
01:55:28,133 --> 01:55:32,470
what are you doing in the evening? - evening? me?

1053
01:55:33,133 --> 01:55:35,468
l'm going to a friend's place for snacks.

1054
01:55:35,468 --> 01:55:37,968
you can think of snacks in my absence?

1055
01:55:37,968 --> 01:55:40,635
that was wrong of me. but l only did it once.

1056
01:55:40,635 --> 01:55:44,636
l only ate idlis. without sambar or chutney. see how thin l've become.

1057
01:55:47,466 --> 01:55:49,467
bindu! - master!

1058
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,301
tell you what - instead of snacks...

1059
01:55:52,301 --> 01:55:54,801
...meet me in the park at exactly 5.30pm.

1060
01:55:55,466 --> 01:55:57,968
why 5.30? that's half an hour too late.

1061
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:01,636
why not 5 o'clock? - no. exactly 5.30.

1062
01:56:01,636 --> 01:56:03,301
not a minute earlier. not a minute later.

1063
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:06,468
don't be annoyed. l'll do what you say.

1064
01:56:06,468 --> 01:56:10,303
''l'll come at 5.30. bindu, shall l change my clothes?''

1065
01:56:10,303 --> 01:56:12,968
'wear a suit, hat, tie? - no, master.''

1066
01:56:12,968 --> 01:56:15,968
You look sweet like this.
- You're right.

1067
01:56:16,466 --> 01:56:18,467
'when you're in love, clothes don't matter.''

1068
01:56:18,467 --> 01:56:19,967
l'll go then.

1069
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,801
go! - namaste.

1070
01:56:30,466 --> 01:56:32,467
''Bindu, this is for you.''

1071
01:56:32,467 --> 01:56:35,635
This is you.
And this is me.

1072
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:41,136
''bhola, sing a really lovely song for me today.''

1073
01:56:41,466 --> 01:56:43,467
Song?
- Yes.

1074
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:47,302
Which song?
- Any song you like.

1075
01:56:54,966 --> 01:56:58,636
''quit, move out, you outsiders india belongs to us!''

1076
01:56:58,966 --> 01:57:01,968
you call that a song? it's a marching song.

1077
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,636
''look, sing a song of love.''

1078
01:57:07,966 --> 01:57:11,803
''don't go my love;,come back to me.

1079
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,636
don't tease me. l won't talk to you.

1080
01:57:17,633 --> 01:57:20,635
''sing, please. a lovely song.''

1081
01:57:21,966 --> 01:57:24,802
'what shall l do, guru? - come on, bhola.''

1082
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:27,301
'The thing is, Guru...
- Guru?''

1083
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:31,803
he's told me to only sing at home.

1084
01:57:32,133 --> 01:57:36,971
''never in a park, by the river or under a tree.''

1085
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,301
he says l'll lose my voice.

1086
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,301
really? - yes.

1087
01:57:41,301 --> 01:57:44,468
lf you want me to forget his life long teaching...

1088
01:57:45,466 --> 01:57:47,634
''All right then, l'll sing.''

1089
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,468
''no, bhola.''

1090
01:57:52,466 --> 01:57:55,635
l can hear your songs all my life.

1091
01:57:57,466 --> 01:57:59,134
bindu. - bhola.

1092
01:58:01,633 --> 01:58:03,634
''bindu. - yes, bhola.''

1093
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:10,635
''bindu, your master's coming.''

1094
01:58:10,635 --> 01:58:14,803
'yes, l called him here. - is that so?''

1095
01:58:15,466 --> 01:58:17,634
do you plan to have me beaten up again?

1096
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:20,134
l have a plan. but something di_erent.

1097
01:58:21,466 --> 01:58:23,801
hide behind a bush. watch what happens.

1098
01:58:24,466 --> 01:58:26,134
Hury up.

1099
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:34,470
master! come here. quickly.

1100
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,468
Devi!

1101
01:58:42,133 --> 01:58:46,637
''look, it's exactly 5.30pm.''

1102
01:58:48,466 --> 01:58:52,136
look what l've got. the whole world.

1103
01:58:52,466 --> 01:58:54,467
around the world. without any dollars.

1104
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:59,471
the astrologer said l'd have a good year.

1105
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,637
l'll mary the woman l love.

1106
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:06,469
''From single,
l'll become double.''

1107
01:59:06,966 --> 01:59:10,302
an astrologer told me the same thing.

1108
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,969
these astrologers are always right.

1109
01:59:13,969 --> 01:59:18,136
you should heed their advice. - he always said that...

1110
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,969
l wouldn't mary the man who ioves me.

1111
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:26,303
these astrologers are frauds. don't listen to them.

1112
01:59:26,303 --> 01:59:29,302
but l took his advice. l've even found a good match.

1113
01:59:30,133 --> 01:59:32,802
shall l tell you? - you're joking.

1114
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:36,802
l'm the boy you mean. how will you tell me about me?

1115
01:59:36,802 --> 01:59:38,967
l'm your future groom.

1116
01:59:40,566 --> 01:59:44,469
''master, l'm the groom, not you.''

1117
01:59:44,469 --> 01:59:49,304
''bhola, you got away last time because of luck.''

1118
01:59:49,633 --> 01:59:52,135
this time you'll have bad luck. you won't survive.

1119
01:59:52,633 --> 01:59:54,468
master. - yes?

1120
01:59:54,468 --> 01:59:57,969
but he's the man l plan to mary.

1121
01:59:58,466 --> 02:00:00,134
Greet him.

1122
02:00:00,134 --> 02:00:03,136
accept my decision and go back to your village.

1123
02:00:03,136 --> 02:00:05,301
l'll pay for your ticket.

1124
02:00:06,133 --> 02:00:09,636
''devi, you don't have to buy my ticket.''

1125
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:15,304
l've heard you out. l didn't want to stay on here.

1126
02:00:15,304 --> 02:00:17,301
l wanted to return to my village

1127
02:00:17,301 --> 02:00:19,467
l stayed only for you.

1128
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:22,135
l taught you all l knew - my art.

1129
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:25,468
''Now you tell me to go.
Yes, l will go.''

1130
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,801
But remember this -

1131
02:00:27,801 --> 02:00:30,135
l will long for you morning and night.

1132
02:00:30,633 --> 02:00:33,969
but l won't be the one to call you.

1133
02:00:41,966 --> 02:00:45,135
''bindu, you broke his heart.''

1134
02:00:45,466 --> 02:00:47,467
He'll mend it elsewhere.

1135
02:00:47,733 --> 02:00:50,135
at least our misunderstandings have been cleared. let's go.

1136
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:02,302
walk softly into the garden.

1137
02:01:03,133 --> 02:01:07,637
''guru, guru, guru. - bhola, how are you?''

1138
02:01:09,633 --> 02:01:13,470
''l'm in a bad state, guru. - now what problem do you have?''

1139
02:01:14,633 --> 02:01:17,635
'what can l say, guru? tomorrow is bindu's birthday.''

1140
02:01:18,466 --> 02:01:22,136
she's asked me to sing. - so what's to cy about?

1141
02:01:23,133 --> 02:01:25,134
l'm the maker of your fate.

1142
02:01:32,966 --> 02:01:36,469
'The thing is, Guru -
Bindu loves me now.''

1143
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:40,803
ls it right for me to deceive
her?

1144
02:01:42,633 --> 02:01:45,469
l wish l could say to her -

1145
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:50,135
''bindu, l can't sing.''

1146
02:01:50,966 --> 02:01:53,635
all l can do is love you.

1147
02:01:54,466 --> 02:01:57,135
''don't say that, bhola. or else you're finished.''

1148
02:01:57,633 --> 02:02:00,969
love and war cannot succeed without deception.

1149
02:02:02,966 --> 02:02:04,967
'what's your advice, guru?''

1150
02:02:05,466 --> 02:02:08,302
what l feel is this -

1151
02:02:10,466 --> 02:02:13,135
''as long as the act,,works, continue it.

1152
02:02:13,466 --> 02:02:14,466
Correct.

1153
02:02:14,466 --> 02:02:16,634
''after you're married, tell the truth.''

1154
02:02:16,634 --> 02:02:18,468
that's right.

1155
02:02:25,466 --> 02:02:27,467
we've wished you a happy birthday.

1156
02:02:27,467 --> 02:02:30,469
we've eaten. where's the surprise item?

1157
02:02:31,466 --> 02:02:33,634
such impatience! - yes!

1158
02:02:34,633 --> 02:02:36,801
''All right, then. Come.''

1159
02:02:41,133 --> 02:02:42,133
Listen.

1160
02:02:44,466 --> 02:02:46,134
where's the cap?

1161
02:02:50,633 --> 02:02:52,134
shawl!

1162
02:02:56,466 --> 02:02:57,186
bhola!

1163
02:03:18,966 --> 02:03:21,468
''oh, bindu. namaste.''

1164
02:03:22,633 --> 02:03:25,969
happy birthday. - thank you.

1165
02:03:26,633 --> 02:03:30,136
you promised to sing on my birthday.

1166
02:03:33,133 --> 02:03:35,802
'You see, l ... Forget the song.''

1167
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:38,468
''no, no, that won't do.''

1168
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,304
'tell him to sing, bindu. - they're impatient.''

1169
02:03:43,304 --> 02:03:46,135
l've given them my word
you'd sing.

1170
02:03:46,135 --> 02:03:47,634
You must sing.

1171
02:03:48,966 --> 02:03:55,806
''bindu, l wanted to tell you something on this happy day.''

1172
02:03:57,466 --> 02:04:00,635
not this way. anything you want to say must be in song.

1173
02:04:04,466 --> 02:04:06,467
go on. what do you wish to say?

1174
02:07:10,466 --> 02:07:12,467
There's something fishy going
on here.

1175
02:07:13,133 --> 02:07:14,467
Fishy?

1176
02:07:15,133 --> 02:07:20,638
who do you think is singing? - him. my bhola. there he is.

1177
02:07:20,966 --> 02:07:26,304
''no, that's vidyapati. - vidyapati? who's that?''

1178
02:07:27,966 --> 02:07:29,967
l know him. he's a famous singer.

1179
02:07:30,466 --> 02:07:31,633
l don't believe it.
It's impossible.

1180
02:07:31,633 --> 02:07:34,469
you have to believe it. come with me.

1181
02:07:35,466 --> 02:07:37,467
l have other words of love for you too.

1182
02:08:52,033 --> 02:08:54,468
your bindu's dead. don't call me that.

1183
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,135
'you liar, cheat, trickster.''

1184
02:08:57,466 --> 02:09:00,969
l swear l'll become your aunt. you can call me your aunt.

1185
02:09:04,466 --> 02:09:08,469
''Guru, Bindu's gone.
She's gone.''

1186
02:09:24,966 --> 02:09:26,467
Mummy!

1187
02:09:28,133 --> 02:09:29,467
what is it?

1188
02:09:29,467 --> 02:09:32,802
remember the photo you showed me? l agree to mary that man

1189
02:09:33,133 --> 02:09:34,968
such a quick decision!

1190
02:09:34,968 --> 02:09:37,134
'well, do you expect me to stay single all my life?''

1191
02:09:38,133 --> 02:09:40,802
kunwarji!

1192
02:09:41,466 --> 02:09:43,467
kunwarji!

1193
02:09:45,966 --> 02:09:48,301
'why are you yelling? what is it, panditji?''

1194
02:09:48,301 --> 02:09:51,302
say radhekrishna! - why should l?

1195
02:09:51,302 --> 02:09:54,135
please. say it. - all right. radhekrishna.

1196
02:09:55,466 --> 02:09:58,135
you're radha and she's krishna. - l'm radha?

1197
02:09:58,466 --> 02:10:00,634
''l mean you're krishna, she's radha.''

1198
02:10:01,133 --> 02:10:03,635
god has made the pe_ect match - you mean the girl has agreed?

1199
02:10:03,635 --> 02:10:06,969
the girl has agreed. her parents have agreed.

1200
02:10:07,466 --> 02:10:09,467
now it's time to organize the wedding music.

1201
02:10:09,467 --> 02:10:11,634
absolutely. - we'll have sparklers.

1202
02:10:11,634 --> 02:10:13,468
we will! - and noisy firecrackers too!

1203
02:10:14,133 --> 02:10:16,134
a beautiful new bride will come to this house.

1204
02:10:16,966 --> 02:10:20,636
ln place of my mud house l'll have a cement house.

1205
02:10:24,466 --> 02:10:28,636
all right. - find an auspicious date quickly.

1206
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:33,303
''odd, isn't it? that's your job, surely.''

1207
02:10:33,633 --> 02:10:35,634
'Yes. You're right. l'll do it.
- Come on, be quick.''

1208
02:10:38,466 --> 02:10:40,134
'Tell me, when should the
wedding be?''

1209
02:10:40,134 --> 02:10:41,300
findanauspiciousdaythat comes soon.

1210
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:44,136
''namaste, uncle. - namaste.''

1211
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:47,467
l bow to you.

1212
02:10:47,467 --> 02:10:50,802
how did l suddenly acquire so many nephews?

1213
02:10:51,966 --> 02:10:55,969
you must be bhola's theatre friends.

1214
02:10:55,969 --> 02:10:57,300
'yes, that's right.''

1215
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:59,801
come. sit down. l'm vey happy today.

1216
02:11:01,466 --> 02:11:04,802
not near the tiger's head. sit near the tail.

1217
02:11:04,802 --> 02:11:06,967
only rajputs sit here.

1218
02:11:07,466 --> 02:11:12,804
''how did you happen to come? - uncle, we respect you as an elder.''

1219
02:11:13,966 --> 02:11:18,470
l seek your opinion. - why call me an elder?

1220
02:11:18,966 --> 02:11:20,967
l'm only a few yers older than you.

1221
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,468
but you're welcome to ask my opinion.

1222
02:11:24,633 --> 02:11:26,134
Uncle.

1223
02:11:28,466 --> 02:11:32,303
suppose you have a young son.

1224
02:11:32,303 --> 02:11:35,135
i ''lf he'd be born at all he'd grow up too.''

1225
02:11:35,633 --> 02:11:39,970
''Suppose he's grown up.
- All right, he is.''

1226
02:11:40,466 --> 02:11:42,801
suppose he's fallen in love.

1227
02:11:42,801 --> 02:11:48,137
with a vey beautiful girl.

1228
02:11:48,466 --> 02:11:50,801
that goes without saying.

1229
02:11:51,133 --> 02:11:55,804
''lf the girl is beautiful, cupid is bound to strike.''

1230
02:11:55,804 --> 02:12:01,971
suppose he's fixed his wedding date.

1231
02:12:02,633 --> 02:12:07,304
he's ready for the wedding. he's even hired his horse.

1232
02:12:10,133 --> 02:12:12,468
why are you telling me all this?

1233
02:12:12,468 --> 02:12:15,969
The poor boy then found out...

1234
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:21,638
...that his uncle is to mary his girl.

1235
02:12:22,966 --> 02:12:26,135
the boy is bhola. the girl is bindu.

1236
02:12:26,135 --> 02:12:29,302
and you are the uncle. you are the uncle.

1237
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,136
''kunwarji, don't listen to them.''

1238
02:12:38,466 --> 02:12:39,800
l've fixed this match with great di_iculty.

1239
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:42,468
''pandit, you're breaking one relationship...''

1240
02:12:42,468 --> 02:12:44,467
...to forge another. that's no good.

1241
02:12:44,467 --> 02:12:47,969
but he's my patron. l always do what's best for him.

1242
02:12:48,466 --> 02:12:52,136
ls this the only girl for bhola? he can get other girls.

1243
02:12:52,466 --> 02:12:55,635
Listen to me.
Throw these fellows out.

1244
02:12:58,633 --> 02:13:02,136
Before l throw them out...
l just might throw you out.

1245
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,801
how could you fix my marriage with this girl?

1246
02:13:04,801 --> 02:13:06,967
you knew bhola was interested in her.

1247
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,801
l should be the girl's father-in-law.

1248
02:13:08,801 --> 02:13:10,967
not make her my wife.

1249
02:13:11,466 --> 02:13:13,634
l'd rather die than do that.

1250
02:13:15,466 --> 02:13:18,969
bhola's fought with me and left. but he's still like my son.

1251
02:13:20,133 --> 02:13:25,471
''Son, you did well to tell me.''

1252
02:13:25,966 --> 02:13:27,967
else l would have made a terrible mistake.

1253
02:13:28,466 --> 02:13:32,636
tell them l cannot accept this proposal.

1254
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,470
''Odd, isn't it?''

1255
02:13:40,466 --> 02:13:42,467
''god, l thank you.''

1256
02:13:47,466 --> 02:13:49,634
''bhola, eveything is all right. - what happened, guru?''

1257
02:13:49,634 --> 02:13:53,470
your uncle heard us out. he was so upset.

1258
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:56,469
''he's decided against marying bindu. - really, guru?''

1259
02:13:56,469 --> 02:14:00,970
''oh, that's wonde_ul! - guru, you're terrific!''

1260
02:14:17,633 --> 02:14:20,802
But my uncle's terrific too.

1261
02:14:21,466 --> 02:14:23,467
don't underestimate him.

1262
02:14:23,467 --> 02:14:27,803
''after all, he is a thakur. l'm the only idiot in the family.''

1263
02:14:28,133 --> 02:14:29,467
l was entrapped by laughter and smiles.

1264
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:31,134
Now we'll see some fun.

1265
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:33,802
a certain girl is going to be left on the shelf.

1266
02:14:38,466 --> 02:14:41,468
you coward! talk to me directly if you're a man.

1267
02:14:41,468 --> 02:14:43,634
don't pretend to be talking to others.

1268
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:46,802
wory about your own marriage.

1269
02:14:47,133 --> 02:14:49,635
l'll find thousands of guys to run circles around me.

1270
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:57,467
calls himself a thakur.

1271
02:14:57,467 --> 02:15:00,135
he asked for my daughter's hand himself.

1272
02:15:00,466 --> 02:15:03,468
we didn't go to his door. where will he find a girl like this?

1273
02:15:03,468 --> 02:15:05,801
'what is it, mummy? - nothing.''

1274
02:15:05,801 --> 02:15:08,134
the thakur changed his mind. maybe it's for the best.

1275
02:15:08,633 --> 02:15:11,469
marriages are matters of destiny.

1276
02:15:11,469 --> 02:15:14,635
l'll find another groom for your daughter.

1277
02:15:14,966 --> 02:15:17,968
his daughter doesn't want a groom of your finding.

1278
02:15:17,968 --> 02:15:19,467
go away. - bindu!

1279
02:15:19,467 --> 02:15:21,801
''daddy, don't interrupt. didn't l tell you to go?''

1280
02:15:22,466 --> 02:15:23,466
Bindu!

1281
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,468
master!

1282
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,801
namaste.

1283
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:39,137
''bless you, master. l was just thinking about you.''

1284
02:15:39,466 --> 02:15:41,634
what could you be thinking about me?

1285
02:15:42,133 --> 02:15:44,969
l'm leaving town - for my village.

1286
02:15:45,633 --> 02:15:48,802
The city doesn't suit me.

1287
02:15:49,133 --> 02:15:52,636
''master, you're so innocent. you're needed here.''

1288
02:15:52,636 --> 02:15:55,469
how can you leave town? l won't let you go.

1289
02:15:55,469 --> 02:15:56,967
Why do you need me?
- Come on.

1290
02:15:57,466 --> 02:16:01,136
Come on.
Sit down here.

1291
02:16:06,466 --> 02:16:09,802
''mummy, l had spoken to you about someone.''

1292
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,801
this is the man. - child?

1293
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:16,302
''daddy, this is my choice, this is my decision.''

1294
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,968
l only need your blessing.

1295
02:16:19,966 --> 02:16:24,804
she did speak to me. if this is your choice...

1296
02:16:25,466 --> 02:16:27,467
And this is your decision...

1297
02:16:27,467 --> 02:16:29,634
then our happiness also lies here.

1298
02:16:30,133 --> 02:16:32,134
Mummy!
- All right.

1299
02:16:33,133 --> 02:16:35,802
'when a thing is meant to be, it happens.''

1300
02:16:36,299 --> 02:16:40,637
what are you talking about? what decision? is it a court case?

1301
02:16:40,637 --> 02:16:43,802
''master, come upstairs with me. l'll explain eveything.''

1302
02:16:43,802 --> 02:16:44,900
why not explain it here?

1303
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:47,001
''Come with me.
- Yes, let's go.''

1304
02:16:51,466 --> 02:16:53,467
''now watch it, pal.''

1305
02:16:54,966 --> 02:16:56,967
''come, master, come.''

1306
02:16:58,466 --> 02:17:02,636
''devi, l'm holding my luggage. it's vey uncomfortable.''

1307
02:17:02,636 --> 02:17:04,801
tell me what you want to say quickly.

1308
02:17:05,633 --> 02:17:08,302
''Now wherever we go,
we'll go together.''

1309
02:17:09,799 --> 02:17:11,801
you're not only my dance master now.

1310
02:17:12,133 --> 02:17:14,802
you're also the master of my fate.

1311
02:17:15,133 --> 02:17:18,135
''no, no. l'm not your master. l'm your servant.''

1312
02:17:18,466 --> 02:17:20,467
you don't understand.

1313
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:22,801
day after tomorrow you're going to mary me.

1314
02:17:24,133 --> 02:17:28,637
''mary you? what did you say, bindu?''

1315
02:17:29,133 --> 02:17:31,301
'what l said is right, master. - how come?''

1316
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:34,802
''for so many days it's been apply apply, no reply.''

1317
02:17:35,133 --> 02:17:37,134
''now suddenly it's ''''no apply, have reply''''.''

1318
02:17:37,466 --> 02:17:39,801
'that's how it is,,in love, master.

1319
02:17:39,801 --> 02:17:41,801
speak softly.

1320
02:17:41,801 --> 02:17:43,634
''lf the enemy hears, there'll be trouble.''

1321
02:17:43,634 --> 02:17:46,969
lf we don't tell the enemy how can we make them envious?

1322
02:17:47,466 --> 02:17:49,968
you want them to burn? leave that to me.

1323
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:52,801
Come with me.

1324
02:17:53,966 --> 02:17:56,301
not like this. let's take the sangam pose.

1325
02:17:56,633 --> 02:17:58,634

1326
02:18:03,133 --> 02:18:05,802
bhola. - what is it?

1327
02:18:06,466 --> 02:18:09,135
eveything's fixed. - what's fixed?

1328
02:18:09,566 --> 02:18:11,968
my marriage has been fixed with bindu.

1329
02:18:12,399 --> 02:18:15,136
and you're stuck in your house. - what nonsense!

1330
02:18:15,466 --> 02:18:18,969
not nonsense! it's the truth. now you can come over.

we'll get married. you can sing. play music. and cy.

1332
02:18:24,466 --> 02:18:28,469
''Bindu, is he telling the truth?
- Yes, he is.''

1333
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:32,970

hury up. it's getting late.

1337
02:20:16,466 --> 02:20:19,969
''guru, do something. the groom's party has arrived.''

1338
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:31,638
''bhola, now there's only one path left.''

1339
02:20:32,966 --> 02:20:36,469
'what, guru? - you have to die.''

1340
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:42,468
''But, Guru...
- No buts.''

1341
02:20:42,468 --> 02:20:44,968
''benarasi, fetch paper and a pen.''

1342
02:20:45,466 --> 02:20:47,134

A rope?
- A rope.

1344
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:50,467
'we'll enact a hanging. bhola, get up.''

1345
02:20:50,467 --> 02:20:53,135
''repeat the name of lord ram. - no, l'll repeat bindu's name.''

1346
02:21:13,299 --> 02:21:16,970
give the horse some water. he's tired carying my weight.

1347
02:21:52,466 --> 02:21:54,801
Well done.
Give it to me.

1348
02:22:03,399 --> 02:22:07,470
''aunt, something terrible has happened. bhola has committed suicide.''

1349
02:22:07,470 --> 02:22:10,135
what? -yes. he's hung himself.

1350
02:22:14,966 --> 02:22:16,967

1352
02:22:24,466 --> 02:22:26,467
O my best friend of friends!

'why did you do this, bhola, my child?''

1355
02:22:42,466 --> 02:22:44,467
Why were you so upset?

1356
02:22:45,799 --> 02:22:47,801
Why didn't you tell me?

1357
02:22:51,566 --> 02:22:53,567
O best friend of friends -

''bhola, you're as inn,,ocent as your name.

1361
02:23:08,466 --> 02:23:13,304
you gave up your life for a faithless girl.

1362
02:23:14,966 --> 02:23:17,301
there will go the bridal procession.

1363
02:23:17,799 --> 02:23:22,638
and here the funeral procession.

1364
02:23:25,466 --> 02:23:31,805
your death is a symbol of true love.

1365

'you're dead, my friend, but you've immortalized love.''

you ask what's happened to bhola?

1368
02:24:10,966 --> 02:24:14,803
See the evidence with your
own eyes.

1369
02:24:18,466 --> 02:24:21,135
''look, bindu, what's happened.''

1370
02:24:32,966 --> 02:24:36,803
''guru, bhola wrote this before he died.''

1371
02:24:39,466 --> 02:24:44,137
''Bindu! Bindu, this is for you.''

1372
02:24:44,466 --> 02:24:46,634
read it.

1373
02:24:50,466 --> 02:24:53,468
''bindu, congratulations on your wedding.''

1374
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:59,137
my heart is full of love for you as l leave this world.

1375
02:25:00,133 --> 02:25:03,135
'your poor spurned lover, bhola.''

1376
02:25:17,133 --> 02:25:19,134
''bhola, what have you done?''

1377
02:25:20,633 --> 02:25:25,137
lf l had known you would die for love...

1378
02:25:25,633 --> 02:25:28,469
l would've never done such a thing.

1379
02:25:29,966 --> 02:25:32,635
did he hang himself because of you?

1380
02:25:33,466 --> 02:25:36,802
God will never forgive you.
Never.

1381
02:25:37,633 --> 02:25:40,135
l entered into this marriage out of sheer stubbornness.

1382
02:25:50,466 --> 02:25:54,136
''bhola, son, what have you done?''

1383
02:25:55,466 --> 02:26:00,470
thakurs give their lives for their county. on the battlefield.

1384
02:26:01,633 --> 02:26:05,636
rajputs don't commit suicide for love.

1385
02:26:05,966 --> 02:26:07,634
my husband.

1386
02:26:07,966 --> 02:26:13,471
what a way to meet you.

1387
02:26:15,133 --> 02:26:17,134
now l have seen the light.

1388
02:26:17,466 --> 02:26:19,634
but the light has gone out of bhola's eyes.

1389
02:26:20,466 --> 02:26:24,469
'why did you leave me, bhola?''

1390
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
bhola.

1391
02:26:27,466 --> 02:26:29,134
''bhola, bhola.''

1392
02:26:48,133 --> 02:26:50,468
''bhola, what have you done?''

1393
02:26:51,133 --> 02:26:53,134
oh god! what a mess!

1394
02:26:53,633 --> 02:26:57,470
''god, give him back his life.''

1395
02:26:59,299 --> 02:27:04,138
see how much he loved you. he gave up his life for you.

1396
02:27:30,466 --> 02:27:33,969
''guru, what happened? - he still has some life in him.''

1397
02:27:34,566 --> 02:27:39,637
''bindu, l have heard that love can breathe life into rocks.''

1398
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,468
''and this is, after all, a man.''

1399
02:27:41,799 --> 02:27:45,637
lf you have even an ounce of iove in your heart for bhola...

1400
02:27:46,133 --> 02:27:48,802
...then express it now.

1401
02:27:49,133 --> 02:27:52,302
Just two words of love
from you...

1402
02:27:52,302 --> 02:27:54,802
...might bring him back to life.

1403
02:27:55,133 --> 02:27:59,136
tell him. tell him that you iove him.

1404
02:27:59,466 --> 02:28:01,634
tell bhola.

1405
02:28:03,966 --> 02:28:06,635
''bhola. bhola, my heart belongs to you.''

1406
02:28:07,466 --> 02:28:09,467
lf you don't come back to life...

1407
02:28:09,467 --> 02:28:13,136
...l won't be able to live without you.

1408
02:28:22,633 --> 02:28:23,353
Bindu!

1409
02:28:26,966 --> 02:28:29,134
''my bhola! bhola, you're alive.''

1410
02:28:35,466 --> 02:28:37,467
Gloy be! Gloy be!

1411
02:28:37,799 --> 02:28:40,302
''bindu, you are like savitri.''

1412
02:28:40,799 --> 02:28:44,637
you've snatched bhola back from the god of death.

1413
02:28:45,633 --> 02:28:47,634
the bride's mother! the bride's father!

1414
02:28:47,634 --> 02:28:49,734
the groom's uncle! come and bless them. the groom's uncle!
