Neither 3 nor 7, settle for 5!

Anything less,we'll go for
another buyer.

Can't you wait 5 minutes for
Rs.5 lakhs? Will you die?

519
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:58,358
Moreover itis business with God.
- Okay.

520
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:01,689
5 means Rs.5 lakhs, right?

521
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:05,195
Did you think it was Rs.5000?

522
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:08,664

You said milk but

547
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,830
Myname is Durga Prasad,
l've killed morethan 40 people.

548
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,566
Nobodybothered about me
when l committedthosemurders.

549
01:06:15,277 --> 01:06:17,711
l wanted to quit everything
and join politics,

550
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:19,847
they've dug up the
old cases to stop me.

551
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:24,576
l'veasked a Minister to withdraw
all thecases against me.

552
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:28,745
He didn'twantmoney
but wantedthatidol as gift.

553
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:32,254
Hebelieves hewould become CM
ifhegets that idol.

554
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:33,689
l thoughtit would be
worth nothing much,

555
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:38,923
but yesterday l cameto know the
idol is worth about Rs.10 crores.

556
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:46,637
l wanted to settle it simply.

557
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:50,810
Buthe brought thesituation
to this stage.

558
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:56,442
Tell me,where's theidol?

559
01:06:56,818 --> 01:06:59,446

So,just lied to him.

569
01:08:14,496 --> 01:08:16,862
Do you tell lies too, Surya?

570
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:51,930
Life is abig chase...

572
01:08:59,141 --> 01:09:01,769
Go to hell...

573
01:09:20,162 --> 01:09:27,432
There's no turn...

01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:35,133
lfcourageis your partner...
dangers wait laying bait for you...

lt's run forthe lifetime...
athiefwould also sacrifice life for love...

577
01:10:40,308 --> 01:10:48,113
Tents pitched in desertwould

01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:56,121
But there's no endto the love

01:11:12,574 --> 01:11:16,135
Escape withoutlooking back to see...

582
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:38,893
What's the idol?
Why did he put itinto mybag?

lfwe complain mymother would die,
ifnot we would die.

593
01:12:04,626 --> 01:12:07,117
lt's like failing in lnter and

Stop thatnonsenseandtalk about
thebumper offer you said about.

640
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:07,089
Theidol you sold for Rs.5 lakhs,

641
01:17:07,295 --> 01:17:09,991
he sold it to two Nigerians
for Rs.10 crores.

642
01:17:10,498 --> 01:17:12,659
Shall we steal Rs.10 crores from them?

643
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:15,559
We've to steal Rs.10
not Rs.10 crores.

644
01:17:15,937 --> 01:17:17,097
What? Just Rs.10?

645
01:17:17,305 --> 01:17:20,934
Yes, that Rs.10 is worth Rs.10 crores.

646
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:23,576
Brother, what you sayis like

653
01:17:35,957 --> 01:17:38,323
Arranging Rs.10 crores here
is difficult.

654
01:17:38,526 --> 01:17:41,689
so they called on phone
for hawalatransfer,

01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,599
Rs.10 note is thecode for
that moneytransaction.

657
01:17:49,971 --> 01:17:52,633
Who ever has that Rs.10,
entiremoenybelongs to him.

Let's share 50-50!

661
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:04,275
5 means Rs.5 crores, right?

662
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:06,112

Our lifeis settled!

673
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,907
The idol must reach mein

674
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:28,319
What happened?

675
01:21:28,589 --> 01:21:29,783
They've kidnapped Swati.

676
01:21:30,892 --> 01:21:33,759
Hethreatens to kill Swati ifwe
