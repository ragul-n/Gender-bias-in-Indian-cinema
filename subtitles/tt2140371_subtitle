1
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:11,171
You were right, Winston.
Kid's got the touch.

2
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,706
Reminds me a little of you.

3
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,883
Think she'll be chief of surgery
when she's 55?

4
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,344
When she's 40.

5
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,453
Suture, please.

6
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,758
She got a sweetheart yet?

7
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,063
No time to date.
The hospital keeps her too busy.

8
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,527
She was always first in her class.
Not like my lazy Raymond.

9
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:40,433
He never opens a book,
only his wallet.

10
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,404
At 29, he's already VP of his company.
What are you complaining about?

11
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:50,640
Yeah, money seems to cling to him,
but what's the use?

12
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,115
He's only 5'8''.

13
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:55,748
Let me tell you...

14
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:00,086
...every Friday, Wilhelmina
comes home for the dance.

15
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,195
Good. See you there tonight.

16
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:08,458
Be discrete. Nothing kills romance
faster than a mother's approval.

17
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,295
Have faith, I know what to do.

18
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:13,837
And make sure his hands are clean.
It's flu season.

19
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,531
I'll wash them myself if I have to.

20
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,472
Okay, bye-bye.

21
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,594
<i>You're late again.</i>

22
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,625
-All the crab is gone.
-This party's a bust. Let's go to KFC.

23
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,734
Cheeky girl.

24
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,937
So thin. You'll catch your death.

25
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,571
I see men's clothes
are still in style.

26
00:03:54,814 --> 00:04:00,411
Let me button that for you.
People are going to think....

27
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,250
Hey.

28
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,391
Raymond!

29
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,291
-Give me that!
-Mother.

30
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:18,835
Wil, I love your outfit!

31
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,034
Don't you think it's too boyish?

32
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,074
Nonsense.

33
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:28,312
I had a pair just like those
during the Revolution.

34
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,710
Sturdy and practical.
Just the thing for war.

35
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,045
Your high heels on the other hand....

36
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,620
Those things will kill you.

37
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,656
It'll be a miracle
if you don't trip and die.

38
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,724
I'm going to get some squid.

39
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,790
Hey, Grandma.

40
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,761
How about it, Wil?
Do me the honor?

41
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,964
Good to see you, Old Yu.

42
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,438
How much did your mom bribe you
to come over here?

43
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,578
So who's the unlucky fellow
this week?

44
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,715
I'm not sure, but I think it's shorty,
next to the punch bowl.

45
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,179
Butch.

46
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,480
-How can you tell?
-Call it a hunch.

47
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,188
-I think he's some sort of stock whiz.
-Does he have stock in Rogaine?

48
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:16,191
I'm glad you weren't this snarky
before our setup.

49
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:17,895
What?

50
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,231
Okay, out with it.

51
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,026
My mother gave me 20 bucks
to dance with you.

52
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:25,204
Yeah, well, you dance like a girl.

53
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,602
Let me say a few words.

54
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:35,574
As the lazy toads
of summer give way...

55
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:38,146
...to the crackling
of autumn leaves...

56
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:43,920
...one's mind naturally turns toward
the demise of our children's education.

57
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:26,128
I give thanks to the woman
who has suffered alongside me.

58
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,996
-I toast you.
-Okay, no more suffering. Let's eat.

59
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,514
Here we go. Signal if you need me.

60
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,044
-Raymond.
-Wil.

61
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,946
Shall we?

62
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:49,846
So, what do you do, Raymond?

63
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:53,548
Well, I do some short selling
on Wall Street. It's a pretty sweet job.

64
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,129
Look at those two.

65
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,230
Don't their faces
reflect good marriage chi?

66
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,866
Depends on whose marriage.

67
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,394
Hey, Albert!
Don't eat too much of that cabbage.

68
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,596
It gives you gas!

69
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:10,367
So I said, ''Listen, fuck-wad,
you early terminate this.''

70
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,101
Then I slammed down the phone.

71
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:15,145
Now I'm on Verizon's national
single-rate plan.

72
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,111
Your Raymond is such a gentleman.

73
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:20,582
Anyone looks good on his arm.

74
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,782
With free mobile-to-mobile
and unlimited nights and weekends.

75
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,686
-I'm sorry.
-Hey there. May we cut?

76
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,155
-Yes.
-Yes.

77
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:31,797
Six minutes.
I believe that's a new record.

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,528
That's my cousin, Vivian.
Big deal ballerina with City Ballet.

79
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,837
Are you into dancers?

80
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,973
Me? No.

81
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,006
Another great party.

82
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,173
My husband and I fought
all the way over here.

83
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,879
But I'm having a great time.
Is there more wine?

84
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,650
You are so into her.

85
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,053
I am not into her.

86
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,525
-That was convincing.
-Shut up.

87
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,530
Poor Jenny.

88
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:10,935
They say her ex-husband has a
new wife 20 years younger than her.

89
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,138
Serves her right.
He made good money.

90
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,569
What's to be unhappy about?

91
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:21,002
Marry a rooster, follow the rooster.
Marry a dog, follow the dog.

92
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:23,705
Why be like those Americans,
divorcing all the time?

93
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,681
She'll never marry again.
Women never do.

94
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,548
She's certainly not meeting
anyone here.

95
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,314
Still...

96
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:34,186
...must be lonely at these parties
without a man.

97
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,591
What do you think those morons
talk about anyway?

98
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,425
The usual ball scratching.

99
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,167
They say he's got a new wife
on the Upper East Side.

100
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,870
I heard she's 20 years younger.

101
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:51,373
My back hurts just thinking about it.

102
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,910
I plan to be married soon myself.

103
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,080
Anyone in mind?

104
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,916
Good luck. You'll have to get
past her father first.

105
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,586
-May I cut?
-Sure, Mr. Cho. Nice suit.

106
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:12,629
Thank you. Hi. Is he your boyfriend?

107
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:14,561
Just plain friends.

108
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,928
He not enough good for you anyway.

109
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,933
I heard that.

110
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,605
You don't want to wait too long.

111
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,800
Forget meat on the grill,
and it will dry out.

112
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,447
-Right. So my ma says.
-Does she?

113
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:30,616
She's quite a woman.

114
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:36,187
Ever since your father passed away,
she's been so delicate.

115
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,155
These 20-odd years
you've been all she has.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,952
Wilhelmina!

117
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,825
Yeah. She's delicate.

118
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,226
Good to see you.

119
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,695
I'm not feeling so well.
Take me home.

120
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:57,400
It's those heels, I tell you!

121
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,787
Thanks, Little Yu.

122
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,689
Home to see your grandparents?

123
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,693
The weekly pilgrimage
to Flushing...

124
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:22,664
-...to swim in the Chinese gene pool.
-Good girl.

125
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,496
How come you never have to go?

126
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,194
I have station duty Friday nights.

127
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,203
Lucky.

128
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,599
From my father.

129
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,368
He still telling fortunes?

130
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:37,038
As long as there are anxious wives
and mothers, he'll be in business.

131
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:38,878
What's this?

132
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,282
Your mother asked him
to give you some herbs...

133
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,752
...to improve your fortitude
for marriage.

134
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,926
You've got to be kidding.

135
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:50,027
It's all natural, no side effects.

136
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,958
-There's my train.
-Hey!

137
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:55,396
Give it a try. Those herbs
are good for your heart anyway.

138
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,072
Go talk to him,
see if we can get the court.

139
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,807
I ain't gonna talk to him.
You go talk to him.

140
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:17,551
Why don't he go play some
Chinese checkers or something? Shit.

141
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,885
Professor, your chi is so potent...

142
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:26,327
...you've managed to hold
the court once again.

143
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:31,235
No fortunes to tell this morning,
Old Yu?

144
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,895
Most people don't want to hear
the truth until after lunch.

145
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:41,579
Fate is for the lazy.

146
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,445
Too true, too true.

147
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,881
But I won't lie,
my only morning customer...

148
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,749
...was your only daughter.

149
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,322
Her?

150
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,516
What does she have to worry about?

151
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,127
She lives safely at home with us.

152
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,326
Her daughter's a doctor.

153
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:02,330
-What more could she want?
-Indeed.

154
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:06,904
But her health may be a bit bumpy
this year.

155
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:10,733
Ridiculous. She's only 48.

156
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,434
Could be menopause.

157
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,505
Menopause?

158
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,582
Nonsense.

159
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,549
Only Americans freak out
about menopause.

160
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,485
The whole relationship is adolescent.
He tells me on the phone...

161
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,387
-...that he wants to break up.
-Again?

162
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,620
And that's not the worst of it.
I was assisting Morgan then...

163
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,595
...so it was over the speakerphone
for all the team to hear.

164
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,565
You know what the sickest thing was?
All I could think of...

165
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,398
...was having the bed to myself,
catching up on sleep.

166
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,904
Game of survival, sleep trumps sex.

167
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,669
You know who I saw
yesterday at the Fulton clinic?

168
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,470
Your mom.

169
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,046
-My mom?
-I waved but she didn't see me.

170
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:54,412
You sure it was her?
You met her once.

171
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,178
Oh, she's pretty memorable.

172
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:59,715
No. She never leaves Flushing.

173
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:19,838
No change?

174
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,385
So...

175
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,089
...are you sick?

176
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,592
No.

177
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,727
I'm here visiting my father.

178
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:44,192
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,368
-Is he sick?
-You could say that.

180
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:50,974
He's-- He's sort of dead
to the world.

181
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,574
-Here.
-No.

182
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,715
-No, I'm-- I'm--
-Really. Really. Take it.

183
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,298
Is that what you're gonna eat?

184
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,496
Yeah.

185
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,208
You really should eat better.

186
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,512
How about this one?

187
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,178
It's packed with peanuts.

188
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:36,352
And a lot of other
satisfying carcinogens.

189
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,520
Sometimes your body
knows what you really want.

190
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,658
See you around.

191
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,888
Ma?

192
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,889
Thank God you're here!
I've been waiting for hours.

193
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,288
What are you doing here?

194
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:19,225
This is a crummy neighborhood.

195
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,195
Take this.

196
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,927
Oh, my God! Are you sick?

197
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,503
Do I look sick to you?

198
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,101
Pick up that bag.

199
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,503
Did Wai Po's heart give out?

200
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:36,270
Don't be ridiculous.
She'll outlive us all.

201
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,910
Are you crying?

202
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:39,243
Do I look like I'm crying?

203
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,012
I can't tell.
You're wearing those sunglasses.

204
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:46,057
Ma, what are you doing here?

205
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,523
You're just going to let me
freeze to death here?

206
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,237
Ma.

207
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:08,341
Ma!

208
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,417
Tell me what happened.

209
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,114
Ma!

210
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,881
All right. I'm calling Grandma.

211
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:24,392
Is that how you speak to your ma
who worked nights so you could eat?

212
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,497
Who stayed in labor
without painkillers...

213
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,395
...so you wouldn't turn dim-witted
like your cousin Jimmy?

214
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,197
Had I known
you would grow so ungrateful...

215
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,567
...I would have held you in.

216
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,575
Has she eaten?

217
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,073
What is she doing here?

218
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,078
She'll need better nutrition now.

219
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,511
She's not that old.

220
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,118
One night without Chinese food
isn't gonna kill her.

221
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,516
Wait, I can't hear. Ma.

222
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,588
Can you pipe down?

223
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,256
It's good for her to stay with you.
You're a doctor.

224
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,690
You can help her...

225
00:16:57,897 --> 00:16:59,888
<i>...maybe get free drugs
from the hospital.</i>

226
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,793
Can you please...?

227
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,899
-Okay.
-You'll pick up her things tomorrow.

228
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:09,268
<i>-I'll bring her back tomorrow.
-I'll prepare herbs from Old Yu.</i>

229
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,466
They'll help her with the baby.

230
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,607
Baby?

231
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,814
-Pregnant!
-At her age!

232
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,648
-It's a scandal!
-A disgrace!

233
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:27,053
-It's better than the soaps!
-More drama!

234
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,352
-More intrigue!
-More eel!

235
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:32,531
Don't eat so much eel!
It gives you gas.

236
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,923
Who's the father?

237
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,033
Who is the father?

238
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,438
-Father.
-Don't call me Father!

239
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,131
You are the biggest disgrace,
the ultimate shame.

240
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,675
What kind of example are you
for your daughter?

241
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:50,679
-You're not pregnant too are you?
-Me? No. No.

242
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,982
No daughter has shamed her parents
more than you.

243
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:58,520
What have we done
to deserve this?

244
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,488
Do you have any idea
who the father is?

245
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,185
Can't bring it up.

246
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:07,293
She just cries and goes on
about how ungrateful I am.

247
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,899
How did you find out she was...?

248
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,799
The receptionist
at the Manhattan clinic...

249
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,338
...is married to one
of Grandpa's former students.

250
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,712
One billion Chinese people,
two degrees of separation.

251
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,646
He's going to banish her
from Flushing. Where will she go?

252
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:29,346
He can't do this to her.
She belongs here.

253
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,724
Who is the father?

254
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,656
You won't tell us? Fine.

255
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,763
Take all the ones
with your mother in them.

256
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,801
She is no longer
a part of this family.

257
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:48,200
Father. Don't be like this.

258
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:53,504
When I think of all we've sacrificed
in the old country...

259
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:58,814
...to give you kids a better life
in the new one.

260
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:04,183
Had I known, I would have left you
behind in the mainland.

261
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,822
Father, please don't feel shamed.

262
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,926
How can I not feel shame?

263
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:13,224
My own rotten flesh has gotten
pregnant without a husband.

264
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:17,930
You don't think people
will laugh at me?

265
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,935
The professor speaks big words...

266
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,904
...but can't control his own daughter?

267
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,543
Old man, this situation won't improve
with yelling.

268
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,178
She wasn't even going to tell us.

269
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,077
She can throw her own reputation
away, but it still comes back to me.

270
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,447
Still crying?

271
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,055
Get out of this house.

272
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:45,125
Don't come back until you have
a husband to match the child.

273
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,338
How long?

274
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:02,708
Who knows?

275
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,247
Till my grandfather takes her back in,
I guess.

276
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,051
-When's that gonna happen?
-When she gets married...

277
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,950
...or proves immaculate conception.

278
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:13,449
Inspiring prospects.

279
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:22,558
Look how cheerful this red is.
We'll put some up here...

280
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,736
...there and there!

281
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,804
That black is just depressing.

282
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,703
You have no oyster sauce.

283
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,742
I don't use oyster sauce.

284
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,141
Since when do you drink beer?

285
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,417
Can we just...?

286
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:45,218
Who's the...? The....

287
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:47,886
How long do you plan on--?

288
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:51,324
You shouldn't keep this stuff
unless you plan to use it.

289
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:56,130
Do you plan to keep the...?

290
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,529
What kind of vegetable is this?

291
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,702
I see you just let my face masks
waste away.

292
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,880
-What's this?
-Herbs from Old Yu.

293
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:13,449
Every week, he has his son
Little Yu give them to me...

294
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,745
...to improve my marriage chi
or something.

295
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,513
I don't know why he bothers.

296
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,691
Don't be rude,
just hiding them here.

297
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,656
I want to have a look.

298
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:26,493
Why can't she get
her own apartment?

299
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,964
Are you insane? Do you know
what kind of karmic hell...

300
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,605
...l'd pay as a Chinese daughter
who didn't take in her own mom?

301
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,775
No, the woman
could never live alone.

302
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:40,771
''Pull this knob''?

303
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,225
Wow, I only ever see you smile
like that during surgery.

304
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,563
<i>-Please don't hold the door....
-Two?</i>

305
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,035
The big one is for your mother.
Morning sickness.

306
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:34,562
Ma?

307
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,462
You're home.

308
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,694
Turn up the TV.

309
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,804
It's just getting to the good part.

310
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,803
She's dumping him.

311
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:50,877
What is that smell?

312
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,381
Smells great, right? Stinky tofu.

313
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:56,154
We'll never get the stench
out of here.

314
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,381
Is that what's for dinner?

315
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:01,218
No, that's just a special treat.

316
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,521
We have chicken, sweet pea stalks,
and fish with bean sauce.

317
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,891
Great. Jay loves fish.

318
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,061
Is he coming?

319
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,935
Ma, you can't give him a paper plate.

320
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:15,834
Safer this way.
Throw it out afterwards.

321
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,269
It's rude.

322
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,410
I'll give him two.

323
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,710
His shoes! His shoes!

324
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,216
Hi, Mrs. Pang.

325
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:30,945
You remember my neighbor, Jay.

326
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,350
His shoes!

327
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:35,693
You don't have to talk so loud.
And leave your shoes by the door.

328
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,636
So I get a call from....

329
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:16,398
Your neighbor is loud and dark
and eats too much soy sauce.

330
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,064
Americans like soy sauce.

331
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,043
I'm going to start eating less
soy sauce...

332
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,110
...so it won't stain the baby too dark.

333
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:30,110
Ma, that's ridiculous.

334
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,482
You eat less too,
so you don't grow spots.

335
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,483
Thanks.

336
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:39,947
Too late for him anyway.

337
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:44,085
Let's keep her.

338
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,634
-So good.
-Thank you.

339
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,103
Thank you for coming.
So, what did you guys think?

340
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:00,404
You were wonderful. So, so fantastic.

341
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,113
-Bye.
-I'll see you.

342
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:12,323
-Bye.
-You did a great job.

343
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,264
Where to now, doctor?

344
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:59,603
-My dad used to come here.
-Mine too.

345
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,069
This one he'd wear.

346
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,070
What does he do?

347
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,267
Judge me, fail me.

348
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:09,678
I can't tell you how pissed
he was when I wasn't promoted...

349
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:11,782
...to principal this season.

350
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:16,580
And now he's just praying I'll get
that gig with the Paris Opera Ballet.

351
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:20,315
Paris? Wow. Sounds impressive.

352
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,027
Gives him something to hope for.

353
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,491
He must be proud of this new show.

354
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,461
He thinks modern dance
was created by...

355
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,635
...a bunch of wild-haired
hippie dropouts.

356
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,338
Yeah, there were some
freaky moments.

357
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,072
But on the whole it was....

358
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:41,802
I'm sure if he just saw the show.

359
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,211
Maybe you could tell him.

360
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,248
He's your boss.

361
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,821
Relax. He's too consumed
by his own life...

362
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,967
...to pay any attention to mine...

363
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:06,827
...as long as he can trot out
his daughter, the prima ballerina.

364
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:12,439
The modern gig is just for fun
while I'm on sabbatical.

365
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,944
I kind of love it, but....
Yeah, whatever.

366
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,976
Maybe he's right. Most girls
would kill for my spot at City...

367
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:25,088
...and here I am
trying to express myself.

368
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,820
I should chuck the distractions...

369
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,222
...focus on being a bunhead.

370
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,660
That would really suck.

371
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:41,736
So...

372
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:46,376
...how come we never met
before now?

373
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:50,075
We did meet. Nineteen years ago.

374
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,847
I was 8, you were 9.

375
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,780
Outside the temple.

376
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,917
I don't remember.

377
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:01,184
The Wong boys were taunting me
about my parents' divorce.

378
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,389
You beat the crap out of them.

379
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:10,123
You were wearing
a Kristy McNichol T-shirt...

380
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:13,395
...tan cords and a pageboy.

381
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:18,102
You spilled your mom's groceries.
We scooped them into a bag.

382
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,006
That's right, and then....

383
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:26,883
And then I kissed you on the nose.

384
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,415
And you ran.

385
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:03,247
Excuse me.
Do you have Chinese movies?

386
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,954
China.

387
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:10,015
My view.

388
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:14,719
It's nice.

389
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,959
I teach down at Arts Alliance.

390
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:29,563
-You like kids?
-No. City Ballet outreach.

391
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:33,270
I'm teaching them how to fall
without hurting themselves.

392
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,742
I'll show you. Here.

393
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,823
Try it.

394
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,000
-No, no, no, really.
-Relax.

395
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,243
Okay, when I say ''fall,''
you totally let go.

396
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:07,934
Okay?

397
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,374
Fall.

398
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:14,050
Fall.

399
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:17,878
Okay, fall!

400
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:23,187
Sorry. I can't do this.

401
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:42,377
That's it. You got it.

402
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:45,473
-You okay?
-That was good.

403
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,311
That was....

404
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,154
That was...

405
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,484
...fun.

406
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,838
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

407
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,600
<i>Yeah, don't stop.</i>

408
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,782
<i>Who's your Asian daddy?</i>

409
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:13,565
<i>I like the sound of the ball
going into the hole.</i>

410
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:17,230
<i>Hi, folks, I'm Fuzzy Zoeller
for the Putting Peg and Pod.</i>

411
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,933
<i>You know, in this great big game
of golf today...</i>

412
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,010
<i>...everybody's looking
for more yardage...</i>

413
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:26,183
<i>...and the best-kept secret is making
those three- and four-footers.</i>

414
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,687
Have you eaten?

415
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,630
How long have you been pregnant?

416
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,813
A couple of months.

417
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:06,513
Married?

418
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,711
Once.

419
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,193
Children are a blessing
just the same.

420
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,825
Number 48.

421
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,936
-We need to see the patient alone.
-I'll be right here.

422
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,775
-Isn't it dangerous?
-Not necessarily.

423
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:36,572
We would monitor her more closely.

424
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:39,807
<i>I didn't think it was possible.
I read those TIME magazine articles.</i>

425
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,885
I can literally feel my eggs atrophy.

426
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:47,046
It's easier to conceive later
if you've had a child before.

427
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,394
She must have all sorts
of weird cravings.

428
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:53,063
She's at home
clawing the cupboards.

429
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:55,391
So she's having the kid?

430
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,295
Don't know.

431
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,294
Who's the father?

432
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:02,864
She won't say.

433
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:10,404
These are good for someone
who's cooped up and depressed.

434
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:14,612
I had to shop for my mom
after the divorce.

435
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:19,788
She wouldn't leave the house, totally
ostracized by those Chinese biddies.

436
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,726
I vowed to get out of Flushing
as soon as I could.

437
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,464
Why didn't your mom get out?

438
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,494
Where would she go?

439
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,195
Thirsty?

440
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:49,343
Don't forget. I invited
the mahjong ladies over tonight.

441
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:52,753
I haven't forgotten.

442
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,152
So don't bring
any of your friends over.

443
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,126
I won't even be home till late.
It's a co-worker's birthday.

444
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,060
You should get home in time
to say hello to them.

445
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,428
You haven't seen them in so long.

446
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,668
Throw it here.

447
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,979
Hey, birthday girl.

448
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,520
Do I get a birthday kiss?

449
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,095
Saved by the fence.

450
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,730
Where were you last night?

451
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,800
Mom was waiting for me again.

452
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,335
I'll definitely be there tonight.

453
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,744
''Definitely'' definitely,
or ''definitely'' maybe?

454
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,612
You know, my friends
are starting to think you don't exist.

455
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:58,778
Trust me.
I'll definitely, definitely be there.

456
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,854
-Six surgeries?
-Goddamn sick people.

457
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:06,394
It's just that I promised Vivian
I'd meet her friends tonight.

458
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,533
You're meeting the friends?
Prepare to be grilled.

459
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:17,099
Vivian, we had some emergencies.
I can't get out of here until 8.

460
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:24,378
Make that 9.

461
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,853
Have the most expensive
birthday floral arrangement...

462
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:32,613
...delivered to this address.

463
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,416
Ten. Ten.

464
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:53,270
Wil, last minute preop.
I have to run. Can you take it?

465
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,719
Everyone's gone home.

466
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,086
Can I come in?

467
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,095
I'm not sure.

468
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:20,599
Okay.

469
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,368
That's it?

470
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:33,247
You didn't want me to stay.

471
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,249
I didn't say you should leave.

472
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,521
Never mind.

473
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:54,962
That one's from you.
That one's from my dad.

474
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,109
I'm an idiot.

475
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,378
What if I stay the night?

476
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:11,612
The whole night?

477
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:18,623
The whole night.

478
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:26,362
Happy birthday.

479
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,448
<i>Hello, Vivian?</i>

480
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,175
<i>This is your mother.</i>

481
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:16,683
<i>Just calling to say hi.</i>

482
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,480
<i>Hope your birthday good.</i>

483
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,179
<i>Did Wil show up?</i>

484
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:23,292
<i>Thought you may wanna talk
after she leaves.</i>

485
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,655
<i>Oh, maybe she's still there?</i>

486
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:28,559
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

487
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:31,291
Oh, my God.

488
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:37,268
You talked to your mother about us?

489
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,875
Yeah. So?

490
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:44,010
''So''? Does she know we have sex?

491
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:47,782
No, Wil.
She thinks we conjugate Latin verbs.

492
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,718
Really?

493
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,656
Did you tell her about this?

494
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,132
You missed the mahjong party.

495
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:06,894
Ma, don't start with me today.

496
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:10,164
You wanna bust on someone,
find yourself a husband to bust on.

497
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:17,972
So marry her off. There's gotta be
someone you can fix her up with.

498
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:20,548
I'll put the word out.
We'll come up with someone.

499
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:23,811
Oh, hey, my landlord's a Chinese guy.

500
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,420
-No wife?
-I don't think so.

501
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:28,956
-He's not very chatty, but he's rich.
-Might as well put him on the list.

502
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,424
What about Mr. Park
over at Smiler's Deli?

503
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:35,395
-Park is Korean. Ma's strictly Chinese.
-Your mom called.

504
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,295
-Oh, God.
-Hey, there's a Mr. Fu.

505
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,332
He's finishing a checkup
with Morgan.

506
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:40,834
Let me see his stats.

507
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:44,932
Fifty-three, unmarried.

508
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:48,703
Thyroid levels aren't where I'd like
to see them, but overall pretty healthy.

509
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:51,882
Okay. Be discrete
but ask him if he's free Friday.

510
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:53,711
Book him, Danno.

511
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,176
I'm not going on a date.

512
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,353
Let your hair down.

513
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,819
Too puffy, better up.
But I'm not going.

514
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:01,857
Is that what you're gonna wear?

515
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:03,617
What's wrong with it?

516
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,693
Maybe you should
wear something brighter.

517
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,529
How about this one?

518
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:12,169
Chinese people cannot wear yellow.

519
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:15,835
On sale.

520
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:23,979
How about this one? It's sexy.

521
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:26,741
No one wants to see a 50-year-old
Chinese woman look sexy.

522
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,314
Ma, you're only 48.

523
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:32,814
Connie Chung's sexy,
and she must be nearly 60.

524
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:35,151
Her show was cancelled.

525
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,326
-Is it a white guy?
-No.

526
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:43,193
An ugly old white guy.

527
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,993
No. He's Chinese.

528
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:50,167
He's nice, very healthy.

529
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:52,103
Pretty healthy.

530
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:56,469
I'm not going.

531
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:01,675
Okay. Okay. Wear that.

532
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:03,979
I'm really not going.

533
00:44:04,188 --> 00:44:05,416
It'll be fun.

534
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:07,215
Then you go.

535
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:14,090
All right, forget it.

536
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:17,466
Forget it. It's already 1 0 till 7.

537
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:24,464
I don't have enough time.

538
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,803
Tell him I'm sick.

539
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,345
Lost my voice.

540
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,076
What am I going
to talk about anyway?

541
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:41,323
Forty-eight and going on a date.

542
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,193
Ma.

543
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,665
It's okay.

544
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:55,668
We have enough time.

545
00:44:56,374 --> 00:45:01,073
Look. This dress isn't bad.

546
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:07,080
We'll just take your hair down.

547
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:13,286
What?

548
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:16,292
What are you looking at?

549
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,285
Ma...

550
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:21,024
...you're beautiful.

551
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,162
Do I tell him about the baby?

552
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:32,066
Save it for the second date.

553
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:41,474
So, Mr. Fu,
what is your line of work?

554
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:43,152
I'm in import-export.

555
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:46,186
-Good business?
-Not bad, not bad.

556
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:50,983
Made enough last month
to go on a singles cruise to Fiji.

557
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,526
Not that I went.

558
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:02,163
-You're an only daughter?
-Yes.

559
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:04,638
I always wish I had kids.

560
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:08,077
No kids? Do you want any?

561
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:12,973
No, it's not necessary.
I'm too old now.

562
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,984
Besides, I'm fixed down there.

563
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:28,598
Hello, my name is Fu Cheng Wen.

564
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,360
Gao Hwei Lan.

565
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:32,468
Can we go now?

566
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:40,736
-What time are you getting back?
-Before midnight.

567
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,046
You're a doctor?

568
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:54,549
I've got a wart on my left calf.
It's driving me nuts.

569
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:57,249
Can you tell me if it's cancer?

570
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:16,179
Fung Ling restaurant.

571
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:24,784
My last wife made me take lessons.

572
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:27,048
The whole year, she would scream:

573
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,692
''Alan! More hip action!''

574
00:47:29,894 --> 00:47:31,384
Shake your ass more!

575
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,160
Now when we see each other...

576
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:38,062
...we don't speak. We just dance.

577
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,261
It's better than marriage.

578
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,441
Fung Ling restaurant.

579
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:51,974
Huge she-crab. So much egg.

580
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:20,837
I think I'm too old to have a child.

581
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,547
What makes you say that?

582
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:28,217
If these are my dating options...

583
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:32,819
...I am definitely too old.

584
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,550
Ma, I gotta get up early tomorrow.

585
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:39,827
There's not much left on this tape.

586
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:42,663
Why are you in street clothes?

587
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:45,994
So I don't have to change
in the morning.

588
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:48,763
I can't believe you came
from my womb.

589
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,634
Is that the good guy?

590
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:58,274
No. He's marrying her for money.

591
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,143
Is that the good guy?

592
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,477
No.

593
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:03,849
That's his brother.

594
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:08,148
Then who's that guy?

595
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,759
He's the most evil of them all.

596
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:13,559
He wants to ruin her family
to avenge a grudge.

597
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:15,722
Who's the loser
they're beating up?

598
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:17,491
That's the good guy.

599
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:23,096
I have found her a husband.

600
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:25,735
She will marry Cho. To the right.

601
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,506
I don't think Ma likes him.

602
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:33,080
What's not to like? Back left.

603
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,518
He's kind of intense.

604
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,050
Who cares?

605
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:40,786
He's a good man
who will take care of your mother...

606
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:44,859
...and give both her
and that child a decent name.

607
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:47,223
Where can you find
a man like that?

608
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:52,391
You will help her see this.

609
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:55,197
I don't think she sees anything
she doesn't want to.

610
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:00,268
She shouldn't be alone.

611
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:06,479
Don't listen to him.

612
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:09,585
Another misunderstanding.
Now they'll never get together.

613
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,755
He shouldn't have slept
with another woman.

614
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:13,946
He didn't really. He was drunk.

615
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:16,922
That's a pathetic excuse.
She should go it alone without him.

616
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:18,594
She'd be lonely.

617
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:22,395
Are you lonely?

618
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,090
No, I have you.

619
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,792
Why?

620
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:30,965
It's too late for me.

621
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:36,945
-What about a father for your child?
-I raised you single-handedly.

622
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:38,341
You turned out all right.

623
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,712
I just think you should give
that Cho a chance.

624
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:45,049
Then you wouldn't be alone...

625
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:48,489
...and it would make
Grandpa happy.

626
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,898
Enough soap opera for today.

627
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:09,673
I'm going to be a terrible mother.

628
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:15,308
What?

629
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:17,884
I don't even like babies.

630
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:23,122
Stephen's always bringing his kid
to the shop.

631
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:27,627
All that drooling. Gross.

632
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,992
You were different.

633
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:35,033
You sprung from the womb
already grown-up.

634
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:40,333
And I had your father
during your early years.

635
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,379
He was really patient.

636
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,046
You have me.

637
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,551
I can hear your stomach.

638
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:56,992
What's it say?

639
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:01,230
''Blub.''

640
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:04,532
''Blub.''

641
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:06,992
It's not very articulate.

642
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,764
Oh, but yours is?

643
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:12,399
Mine sings arias...

644
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,237
...spouts poetry, proofs.

645
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:26,649
My mom used to do that.

646
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:29,291
Put me right to sleep.

647
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,584
Really?

648
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:37,393
I bet she has some great tips
on how to deal with you.

649
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:40,600
We should....

650
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:42,999
We should get together
and compare notes.

651
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:47,066
Thank God that'll never happen.

652
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:55,843
So...

653
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:59,255
...is this all we are?

654
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:04,050
I'm just starting to feel
like we're having an illicit affair.

655
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:09,529
We never do anything.
We never see anyone.

656
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,397
I love holing up with you, but....

657
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:27,006
Sorry.

658
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,414
I'd like to see your place.

659
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:37,191
I have a pregnant mother at home.

660
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:40,361
I'd like to meet her.

661
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:42,397
She's not ready.

662
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,625
It's been weeks.
Just tell her I'm a friend...

663
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:47,861
...a nice Chinese girl.

664
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:51,405
-You're not just a nice Chinese girl.
-I'll fake it.

665
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:53,337
You don't know my mom.

666
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:55,171
Exactly.

667
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,596
Fish is good, Auntie.

668
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:19,701
What do you do?

669
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:23,532
Vivian's a dancer.

670
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:25,301
A go-go dancer?

671
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:34,478
I dance with
the New York City Ballet.

672
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,152
Oh, ballet.

673
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,188
But now I'm...

674
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:45,621
...taking a break to dance modern.

675
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:48,255
Modern?

676
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:54,036
Less classical, more expressive.

677
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:56,501
She's very, very good.

678
00:54:58,308 --> 00:54:59,969
Not ballet.

679
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:06,014
So is the baby good?

680
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,419
She works too hard.

681
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:19,425
I hardly get to see her.

682
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,761
Me neither.

683
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:39,745
So do you have a boyfriend?

684
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:46,122
No.

685
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,948
Pretty girl like you must have
lots of boys ask you out.

686
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:56,522
Wil's black neighbor is single...

687
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:58,792
...always around.

688
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:01,095
You interested?

689
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:02,899
No.

690
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:06,308
-You don't like black people?
-Sure, I like--

691
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,910
-She doesn't like black people.
-Yes, she does.

692
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:11,979
-Then why won't she date them?
-Let's just eat.

693
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:29,522
Ma?

694
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:32,658
You're waiting for me now?

695
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,599
I just want to make sure
my baby gets home safe.

696
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:39,333
Well, what if I have other plans?

697
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:45,311
Hey, Little Yu.
Isn't my daughter beautiful?

698
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:47,115
She is indeed.

699
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,113
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

700
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:50,411
Train's here.

701
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,816
Thank your father.
I'll be calling him tonight.

702
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:58,620
Little Yu's got a solid job
and good benefits.

703
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,691
I'm getting a bridal contact high.

704
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:09,201
I feel virginal, fertile.

705
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,105
Where are my bridesmaids?

706
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,813
Seriously, Wil, why don't
you just tell her?

707
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,152
-She knows.
-She does?

708
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:27,152
She dropped by my apartment
a couple years ago unannounced.

709
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,984
She caught you.

710
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,593
So, what'd she say?

711
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,285
Nothing.

712
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:36,259
She dropped some dumplings
on the table and left.

713
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,525
We haven't talked about it since.

714
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:40,259
She kept setting you up
with guys?

715
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:42,867
That's when it started.

716
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:59,384
-Great crab, isn't it?
-Smells delicious.

717
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:01,853
There's an old tradition
in Shanghai.

718
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:05,516
They pick their son-in-law based on
his skill at extracting his crab meat.

719
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:09,829
What am I saying?

720
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:13,264
You can't have crab
because of the--

721
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:21,839
Your child would be my child.

722
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:26,979
I would make sure you have anything
you want for the rest of your life.

723
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:29,948
I just want you to be happy.

724
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:38,693
There are many women
who would be happy with you.

725
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,830
Wouldn't you rather
have someone younger?

726
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:46,992
Younger people. Today they love you.
Tomorrow, who knows?

727
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:52,400
It's better to stick with someone
who can really understand you.

728
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:54,400
Besides...

729
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,906
...l've liked you for over 1 5 years.

730
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:11,083
I had a lovely time.

731
00:59:12,395 --> 00:59:15,091
You look lovely in this light.

732
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:22,365
-Hey, Mrs. P.
-Hi!

733
00:59:22,772 --> 00:59:25,366
Pardon me. I was just leaving.

734
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:31,641
He's a lumpy-looking guy.

735
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:36,007
Yeah.

736
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:01,176
Are you guys gonna kiss?

737
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,379
No. What?

738
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:07,516
Are you going to French kiss
when you go to Paris?

739
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:11,720
Go play on the jungle gym.

740
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,519
I got the gig
at the Paris Opera Ballet.

741
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:29,962
Four-year contract.

742
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,735
That's great.

743
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:39,714
Wow, what an incredible opportunity.

744
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:43,109
I'm proud of you.

745
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:46,579
When are you leaving?

746
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:54,087
I don't know.

747
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,391
Deadline to accept is next week.

748
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:06,774
Well, congratulations.

749
01:01:40,276 --> 01:01:43,712
Wonder how the gang is doing
over at the salon.

750
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,348
Then why don't you go in?

751
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:57,853
Mrs. Wong's really upset because
Raymond's dating a white girl.

752
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:02,192
And Mrs. Chen,
she's been really bitter...

753
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:05,425
...because her husband lost
a pile of money on the stock market.

754
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:10,937
Carrying one child and sending
the other out to do her dirty work.

755
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:13,632
She never could
take care of herself.

756
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:19,638
Who could the father be?

757
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:25,588
Do you think the father...

758
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,348
...is someone in our circle?

759
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:32,824
No way. Fred is too respectful.

760
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:35,862
Len is too scared.

761
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:38,557
Too lazy.

762
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:43,967
Too busy losing money.

763
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:46,005
Thank God.

764
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:49,406
Good to know we're safe.

765
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:53,446
Hello, Wilhelmina.
How is that mother of yours?

766
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:58,316
Didn't you see her the other day
at her mahjong party?

767
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:01,957
Oh, no. I was busy.
I wasn't able to make it.

768
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:06,060
Me too.
Everyone's so busy these days.

769
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:08,526
I heard no one went.

770
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:17,163
Ma?

771
01:03:20,844 --> 01:03:22,539
Nothing.

772
01:03:29,552 --> 01:03:31,076
Ma?

773
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,084
What?

774
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,316
Do you like Cho?

775
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:41,220
He's a nice man.

776
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:46,092
But do you like him?

777
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:52,073
I just told you. I like him fine.

778
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,674
Do you think Ma should marry Cho?

779
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,015
Does she love him?

780
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:07,915
I don't think so.

781
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,480
Deadline for Paris is Friday.

782
01:04:40,757 --> 01:04:42,816
You must be excited.

783
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,823
Well, it's Paris.

784
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:51,296
It's professional validation.

785
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:53,432
But...

786
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:57,564
...I have new things here...

787
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,202
...new work.

788
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:03,935
l-- I just....

789
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:09,646
I don't know if it'll pan out.

790
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:16,292
It's a pretty big thing to pass up.

791
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:20,694
Yeah.

792
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:47,551
Mr. Cho took you to the hospital?

793
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:50,624
He's a good man.

794
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:55,262
Don't worry, Professor Gao.
Your wife's okay.

795
01:05:55,465 --> 01:05:58,696
Your grandmother's lungs aren't
as strong as we'd like to see them...

796
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,233
...but I believe
she'll pull through fine.

797
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:04,133
I'd like to keep her in here
for another few days.

798
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:08,504
Vivian, what are you doing here?

799
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,145
I couldn't sleep...

800
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:14,544
...so I thought
I'd get some coffee with you.

801
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:20,847
My daughter.

802
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:22,855
Wil.

803
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:24,992
Vivian.

804
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,135
Why don't we get breakfast.

805
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:37,466
After I finish up here, we can
talk about your training in Paris.

806
01:06:38,574 --> 01:06:41,941
Wil, can I grab you for a second?

807
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:54,319
So you're the reason
she's dragging her heels on Paris.

808
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:08,133
She was 6...

809
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:10,965
...the first time I saw her dance.

810
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:14,200
She blew away all the other girls.

811
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:18,144
I haven't missed
a single performance since.

812
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,978
Do you love her?

813
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:35,229
If she doesn't take this job in Paris...

814
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:38,093
...she may never
realize her greatness.

815
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:47,271
I understand.

816
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:56,045
What were you all so worried about?

817
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,117
Haven't I been healthy all these years?

818
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,879
This is nothing compared to war.

819
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:02,591
Don't excite yourself.

820
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:04,383
That's right, Mrs. Gao.
Just relax.

821
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:08,529
You relax. Preferably elsewhere.
I want to speak to my granddaughter.

822
01:08:09,866 --> 01:08:11,356
I'll be back later.

823
01:08:13,636 --> 01:08:14,762
Me too.

824
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,306
Thank God they're gone.

825
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:22,710
Like I'm so bored I have to listen
to his asinine pandering!

826
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:24,441
How's your mother?

827
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:27,110
She's doing well.

828
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:28,816
You're talking to me.

829
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:34,080
She's totally depressed
and humiliated.

830
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,319
Don't tell her about this.

831
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,058
How can I not?

832
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:44,090
She has enough on her mind.

833
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,665
Your grandfather forbids her
to come anyway.

834
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,600
It'll just make her feel bad.

835
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,495
I'll be out soon.

836
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:54,505
Promise you won't tell her
until I'm back home.

837
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,139
Grandma....

838
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,810
Promise me.

839
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,449
You're just in time.

840
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:09,657
She's watching his plane
take off for the States.

841
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,903
Vivian's been leaving messages
out the ying-yang.

842
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:29,009
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

843
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:32,838
<i>I wanted to make sure you're okay.</i>

844
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,981
<i>So are you still coming around
the theater tonight?</i>

845
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:39,848
<i>Yeah. Just let me know.</i>

846
01:09:40,056 --> 01:09:42,183
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

847
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,800
<i>Hey. I'm going into rehearsal
in a few minutes...</i>

848
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:55,869
<i>...so my cell's gonna be off
until after the show.</i>

849
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:59,200
<i>But am I gonna see you after work?</i>

850
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,368
<i>I'll just talk to you later.</i>

851
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,780
<i>And, folks, it will help
if you putt to a smaller object....</i>

852
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:31,367
Your hot dog got cold
so I fed it to the birds.

853
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:34,173
Careful.

854
01:10:34,377 --> 01:10:36,845
We don't wanna train them
to eat flesh.

855
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:49,654
So how's your grandma?

856
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:53,552
Okay.

857
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:57,631
Where have you been
the last couple days?

858
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,035
It's been crazy.

859
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:13,141
Vivian...

860
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:16,378
...there's a lot going on right now.

861
01:11:19,589 --> 01:11:22,251
I'm sorry if I....

862
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:26,590
If this hurts.

863
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:34,001
At least it's not a flesh wound.

864
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,303
Ma?

865
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:16,444
Stupid girl,
he's so obviously right for you.

866
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:19,909
Ma.

867
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,179
We need to talk.

868
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,643
There's not much left on this tape.

869
01:12:26,589 --> 01:12:28,523
I don't think this can wait.

870
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:44,562
Ma.

871
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:52,805
I love you.

872
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:56,084
And I'm gay.

873
01:13:02,558 --> 01:13:05,322
How can you say
those two things at once?

874
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:09,861
How can you tell me you love me...

875
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:12,091
...then throw that in my face?

876
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:16,499
I am not a bad mother.

877
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:18,763
My daughter is not gay.

878
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:29,911
Then maybe I shouldn't be
your daughter.

879
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,975
I can't believe she's gonna do it.

880
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:48,785
Crazy.

881
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:50,285
Who are you, a bridesmaid?

882
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:54,624
I'm not invited.

883
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:58,525
Ma's not speaking to me anyway.

884
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:02,432
So...

885
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:06,769
...you're really not gonna see
Vivian off to the airport?

886
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:11,643
-We broke up.
-So?

887
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:15,851
We broke up.

888
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,088
Hey.

889
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:33,124
My dad said this is for the bride.

890
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:37,705
Jesus.

891
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:47,980
Damn it!

892
01:17:21,216 --> 01:17:22,183
''Hwei Lan...

893
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:25,312
...you keep refusing to see me.

894
01:17:25,554 --> 01:17:28,318
By the time you read this...

895
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:33,689
...you may already be Cho's bride.

896
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:39,993
You've said this is the way
fate would have it...

897
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:46,334
...but if it is your fate
to do your father's bidding...

898
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:51,410
...then it is my fate to try...

899
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:54,104
...and undo yours.

900
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:59,276
Yes, people would talk
about the age difference....''

901
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:04,284
Oh, my God.

902
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,689
<i>It's Old Yu!</i>

903
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:10,395
<i>I may not be what you pictured
as your future.</i>

904
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:14,300
<i>But I know now that I am the one
destined for you.</i>

905
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:15,965
<i>I love you.</i>

906
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:17,570
<i>I know you love me.</i>

907
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:20,071
<i>Shouldn't this be simple?</i>

908
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:22,968
<i>Twenty-nine years ago...</i>

909
01:18:24,046 --> 01:18:27,846
<i>...you married a man you didn't love
to be the perfect daughter...</i>

910
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:31,416
<i>...and now you're doing it again,
all for your father's honor.</i>

911
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:41,824
Dad.

912
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:15,363
Ma!

913
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,133
Wait!

914
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,260
Wait a moment!

915
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:21,929
What's going on?

916
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,735
I read the letter. I know.

917
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:28,204
Wil, quiet! You're causing a scene!

918
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:32,741
You know what? What letter?

919
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,209
Don't marry him!

920
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:36,882
Marry the one you love.

921
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:38,950
Wait a minute.

922
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:41,150
You don't love me?

923
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:42,618
Of course she loves you!

924
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:44,621
Say it! You love him!

925
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,118
No!

926
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:48,459
No, she doesn't.

927
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:50,328
She loves him!

928
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,661
This is a mistake!
It's not me! It's not me!

929
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,062
-Yes, it is!
-No, it's not!

930
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:57,066
Wilhelmina!

931
01:19:57,306 --> 01:19:58,432
It's me.

932
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:04,504
Are you insane?

933
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:08,411
-That woman's karma kills husbands!
-Pa, I love her!

934
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,983
I told you to marry
the Hong Kong movie star!

935
01:20:13,889 --> 01:20:14,856
At least she doesn't have kids!

936
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:18,254
-lf you want a divorce, just say so!
-You want it!

937
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:21,691
-Idiot, I love you!
-Dog fart! I love you!

938
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,704
I am indebted to you...

939
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,712
...but I don't love you.

940
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,412
Dad.

941
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,686
I am so sorry.

942
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,497
I can't.

943
01:20:59,268 --> 01:21:04,729
You have thrown away
a lifetime of my reputation!

944
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:07,839
Father, please.

945
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:49,776
Fantastic! I'll move back in with you.

946
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:54,448
We'll need a bigger bed,
so the baby can sleep with me.

947
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,989
Later, we'll block off the living room
for her crib and--

948
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,454
No, Ma. Wait.

949
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:03,091
We really should repaint.
Rose beige would be nice.

950
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:05,466
It would warm the place up nicely!

951
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:10,728
No.

952
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:29,582
You know what I don't understand?

953
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:33,093
Why did you make us
go through this?

954
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:37,061
Why didn't you just say it was
Little Yu and be together?

955
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,265
He's young.

956
01:22:41,737 --> 01:22:42,931
Handsome.

957
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:45,730
He could have anyone.

958
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:50,009
He's obviously in love with you.

959
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,079
Today he loves me.

960
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:55,515
Tomorrow, who knows?

961
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:05,023
I guess I needed him to declare it.
Not just to me, but to everyone.

962
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:11,896
Besides, I'd never dated before.

963
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:15,031
I may as well see what's out there.

964
01:23:27,015 --> 01:23:28,676
You know...

965
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:30,214
...that Vivian...

966
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,315
...she seems nice.

967
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:39,687
She's leaving for Paris tonight.

968
01:23:43,265 --> 01:23:44,732
You like her, don't you?

969
01:23:49,037 --> 01:23:50,004
Stop the bus!

970
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:03,880
-You stay-- Get--
-Wait! Wait!

971
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:11,182
Vivian!

972
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:16,022
-I gotta catch my flight.
-Don't go. Wait.

973
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:17,721
That's what I do. I wait.

974
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:21,232
I hang around, waiting to catch
a precious moment with you...

975
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,700
...between your mom and your beeper.
I'm sick of it.

976
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:25,964
We'll have more time
after my residency.

977
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:28,665
It's not the time, Wil.
It's how you feel.

978
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:31,345
You're too scared to look
the world in the eye...

979
01:24:31,546 --> 01:24:35,107
...and let it watch you fall in love.
You're off and running without a fight.

980
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:37,114
I'm not the one running off to Paris.

981
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:39,879
Don't flatter yourself.
It's for the ballet.

982
01:24:40,088 --> 01:24:42,079
I thought you wanted to do modern.

983
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,724
What do you fucking care
what kind of dancing I do?

984
01:24:44,926 --> 01:24:47,087
Punish me by leaving. Fine.

985
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:50,731
Don't punish yourself by treating
your dreams like they're for shit.

986
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:00,732
Kiss me.

987
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:05,010
Right here, in front of all these people.

988
01:25:16,024 --> 01:25:17,685
Vivian.

989
01:25:19,594 --> 01:25:21,653
Vivian, I love you.

990
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:46,903
-Working late again?
-Not tonight.

991
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:49,777
-Off to Planet China.
-Thought you didn't have to do that.

992
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:52,579
Ma insisted. I have to be
there tonight for some reason.

993
01:26:52,787 --> 01:26:56,188
-She still goes to those things?
-All the ladies bug her for advice now.

994
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:02,426
You're late as usual.

995
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:03,620
Hi, Ma.

996
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:21,340
Wil, it's been so long.

997
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:24,949
Busy lately? Try some of this jerky.

998
01:27:25,186 --> 01:27:27,780
Yeah, it's been a busy spring.

999
01:27:28,023 --> 01:27:31,049
Well, a full belly conquers all.

1000
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:52,708
It is 4 a.m. in Paris.
Can we please go home now?

1001
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:57,350
I'm not spending my entire break
in Planet China.

1002
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:05,254
You promised she wouldn't be here.

1003
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,087
She hasn't been coming for a while.

1004
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:52,063
Dance with me?

1005
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:55,767
Wil....

1006
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:58,875
Vivian Shing.

1007
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:02,579
I am asking you to dance with me.

1008
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:08,886
I can't.

1009
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:18,431
There's no music.

1010
01:29:56,638 --> 01:29:58,731
So now will you let me move in?

1011
01:29:58,940 --> 01:29:59,929
No way!

1012
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:02,268
This is the first time
I've ever had my own place.

1013
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:04,603
You're gonna cramp my style.

1014
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:08,445
The world is getting too hard
to predict.

1015
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:10,207
It just keeps getting worse.

1016
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:24,224
Revolting!

1017
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:27,128
Let's go.

1018
01:30:27,368 --> 01:30:28,630
One more bite.

1019
01:30:30,605 --> 01:30:32,402
Folks are leaving.

1020
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:41,909
-Fuck them.
-Fuck them.

1021
01:31:30,165 --> 01:31:34,158
Fifteen years is too damn long to wait.
If you like her, go for it.

1022
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:35,836
How's your squab?

1023
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:38,028
Oh, it's good.

1024
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:43,541
You finally saw Vivian's new show.
What do you think?

1025
01:31:45,113 --> 01:31:48,378
-I didn't get it.
-Me neither.

1026
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,608
Well, at least she's marrying a doctor.

1027
01:31:55,456 --> 01:31:58,186
Stop patting that side.
The baby will turn out lopsided.

1028
01:31:58,393 --> 01:31:59,519
Don't be silly.

1029
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,695
Patting isn't bad for the kid,
right, Wil?

1030
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:04,023
Yeah. But disagreeing
with her mother is.

1031
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:05,199
Well said!

1032
01:32:10,038 --> 01:32:13,303
The moment that girl is born,
I'm coming over every day.

1033
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:18,708
God knows how she'll turn out
if she's brought up by you two.

1034
01:32:21,616 --> 01:32:24,380
Nice shirt, Vivian.

1035
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:28,121
Now why can't you wear
something pleasant like that?

1036
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:32,054
-Because I like to be nagged.
-I'll work on her.

1037
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:36,688
So there's only one thing left.

1038
01:32:37,298 --> 01:32:39,766
When are you going to have a baby?
