2
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,816
'My mother always said, never
break anyone's heart.

3
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,589
'So I broke everything else instead.'

4
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,523
'She said, I should always be honest.'

5
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,921
'So, I spent all my life
getting into trouble.'

6
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,932
'But finally, I think
I've met my match.'

7
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,292
He was right here.

8
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,289
Look that way.

9
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:24,933
Greetings. 
- Bless yöu.

10
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,940
Are yöu...going to settle
for that colored drink?

11
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,243
Or would yöu prefer something stronger?

12
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,848
I would prefer something stronger.

13
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,749
Then, that's where yöu will get it.

14
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,284
Om Namah Shivay!

15
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,023
Cheers! 
- Cheers!

16
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,893
I am Rudra.

17
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,656
Nandini's first cousin.

18
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,430
And yöu? 
- Well, actually, I'm the second cousin.

19
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,005
But I'm closer to her than the first cousin. 
- I see.

20
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,032
Everyone knows that.

21
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,841
There's just one temple
of Lord Brahma in Pushkar.

22
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:09,910
Why not?

23
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,073
That's because Lord Brahma
committed a big sin..

24
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,616
That's my uncle's Man Friday.

25
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,708
Lallan Tiwari.

26
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,317
He's been raised in this house.

27
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,845
Cheers.

28
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,820
The heroine's here.

29
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,688
The hero's here!

30
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,548
Amazing. Great.

31
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,160
Can I tell yöu something?
- What?

32
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,955
I'm a gate crasher. I wasn't invited.

33
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,657
I got into trouble this morning.

34
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,429
Some gang was chasing me.

35
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,435
I saw the wedding procession and
just joined in to lose them.

36
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,003
I thought as much after
seeing yöur attire.

37
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,434
yöu didn't look like a guest.

38
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,300
Wow, buddy.

39
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,443
She's seriously flirting with yöu.

40
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,653
I just danced with her. I
didn't do anything else.

41
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,215
And who's stopping yöu?

42
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,781
Go ahead.

43
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,594
Brother Rudra. Aunfs calling yöu. 
- Coming.

44
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,451
I'll be back.

45
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,229
Hello.

46
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,031
Name?

47
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,232
What's yöur name?

48
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,739
Raja.

49
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,945
Raja Mishra.

50
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,575
Raja Mishra!

51
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,244
yöu've been ogling me all day!

52
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,989
If I tell my people they'll thrash yöu.

53
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,284
Go ahead, I am not scared.

54
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,760
yöu're not scared?

55
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,257
Do yöu have a girlfriend?

56
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,504
They don't last too long.
- I don't want to either.

57
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,750
Just a minute, hold on.

58
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,787
First tell me yöur name? 
- What for?

59
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,128
To note it down in my list. Number 155.

60
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,398
yöu're a big hunter.

61
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,465
Hunters kill animals.

62
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,206
I awaken the animal inside us.

63
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,500
I see. 
- Right.

64
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,070
All set? 
- Yes.

65
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,340
We have to finish this job in 30 minutes. 
- Yes.

66
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,107
Our plan is, we barge into the house.

67
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,451
..and kill every member of
the family. Do not hesitate.

68
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,714
But, I will kill Parshuram personally.

69
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,927
Look. We won't get this
opportunity again.

70
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,091
Listen! Hey! There's going to
be an attack on this house!

71
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,729
Lallan Tiwari is on his way
here with 10 to 15 gunmen.

72
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,159
What? 
- Rudra!

73
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,794
Listen.

74
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,031
Get in! Rascals, come on!

75
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,679
Go that way.

76
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,366
Brother. 
- Move back!

77
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,144
Lallan! yöu traitor!

78
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,197
Don't run!

79
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,731
Shoot!

80
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,655
Sir, he's my friend.

81
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,660
I invited him. 
- Fine.

82
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,424
But people say he arrived here
with the groom's procession.

83
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,895
What does that mean? 
- Look..

84
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,197
Sir. I'm neither a guest
nor am I family.

85
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,498
Yesterday I..

86
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,167
I got into a fight.

87
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,533
Some gang was after me in a fight.

88
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,004
I mingled with the procession
to lose them and came in.

89
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,271
Fine. Come with us to the station.

90
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,910
SP sir, we should be showing
gratitude to this boy..

91
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,678
..and yöu're arresting him instead?

92
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,384
I've a question, son..

93
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,290
Why risk yöur life for me?

94
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,655
Rudra and I became friends.

95
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,865
yöu risked yöur life for
a friend yöu just made?

96
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,065
And that traitor Lallan..

97
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,892
I raised him in this house
since he was a child!

98
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,436
I have a question, sir.

99
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,800
If Lallan was yöur loyal Man Friday.

100
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,600
Then, why did he do such a thing?

101
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:38,614
Uttar Pradesh's politics has
wiped out everybody's loyalty.

102
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,209
Now, those who risk
their lives for us..

103
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,186
..are the only loyalists.

104
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,656
I was completely prepared, sir.

105
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,128
Jagjivan's men were with me too.

106
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,266
There was no room for mistake.

107
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:05,639
Yet, those two boys
outmatched yöur army!

108
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,548
Why are there always two?

109
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,348
What do yöu mean? I didn't get it.

110
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,017
There were two in 'Sholay'
as well, remember?

111
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,023
Stop joking, sir.

112
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,661
I've been humiliated, and yöu're
ranting about 'Sholay'.

113
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,526
Hey loser! yöu said yöu will
eliminate that entire family.

114
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,565
But yöu couldn't even kill a fly!

115
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,191
And yöu got four of my men killed.

116
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,396
Sir, if only it wasn't for these two..

117
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,128
Bipin! 
- Yes.

118
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,196
Come here.

119
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,908
Find them.

120
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,476
Sir, I give yöu my word.

121
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,716
yöu will surely reap marijuana..

122
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,717
..in Parshuram's fields.

123
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,255
If not, yöu can behead me.

124
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,987
Anytime yöu want.

125
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,093
And what will I do with yöur head?

126
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,497
Right, it's useless.

127
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,499
I'm more useful alive.

128
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,533
First, I'll take care
of those two boys.

129
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,670
Sir, I never did hotel management.

130
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,103
But I'll learn.

131
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,504
If yöu prefer, yöu can appoint me
on a temporary basis for a month.

132
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,515
He'll wash dirty plates.

133
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,307
Please father, I'm getting a job.

134
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,511
Couldn't yöu find one earlier..
- No, not to yöu.

135
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,843
Not to yöu.

136
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,717
Yes, sir. I already sent
yöu a bio-data yesterday.

137
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,687
Yes.

138
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,919
Thank yöu, sir.

139
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,517
The police are here.

140
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,627
What's wrong?

141
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,366
This is yöu, right? Come down.

142
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,999
Where will yöu take him?

143
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,638
He's finally just found a job.
Everything will be ruined.

144
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,266
We'll just take him down to the station
and get acquainted, that's all.

145
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,777
Tell them we're on the way.

146
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,144
Why did yöu do it?

147
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,879
yöu were inviting trouble for yöurself.

148
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,920
It was just self defense, nothing more.

149
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,456
Come on, now yöu're in
this mess for good.

150
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,817
Come on.

151
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,333
6...7.. 
- May Allah bless yöu.

152
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,735
Keep it. 
- Bless yöur family and children.

153
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,794
Rudra.

154
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,809
Deliver this parcel on the
way. It's on yöur route.

155
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,537
Why did yöu give him all that money?

156
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,411
Because he needed it more than I.

157
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,811
I can always earn more. 
- I see.

158
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:34,913
Sit.

159
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,182
Excuse me.

160
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,429
Does Rudra Tripathi work here? 
- Yes.

161
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,387
We're from his village.

162
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,499
That's him, the one riding that bike.

163
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Rudra.

164
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,932
He left. yöu can meet
him here tomorrow.

165
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,237
Stop. Stop. Stop.

166
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,070
Get down.

167
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,538
Get down.

168
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,946
If it were up to me, I would've
kept yöu in the zoo, not a jail.

169
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,755
But, they called from up high.

170
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,623
Now go. Go.

171
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,916
Leave!

172
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,784
Here yöu go.

173
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,914
Get lost.

174
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,925
Down there. Come on.

175
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,527
Catch him.

176
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:47,077
King Yudhishtir was a righteous king.

177
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,879
King Yudhishtin.

178
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,442
yöu can't go out now.

179
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,952
Son, there's trouble brewing.

180
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,748
I'm fasting for yöur well being.

181
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,355
Pray with me for a while.

182
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,754
How long is it going to take?

183
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,754
We fast for the children.

184
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,533
And then, they try to boss us around. 
- Here yöu go.

185
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,529
Hello, uncle. 
- Hello.

186
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,929
He was the eldest of the Pandavas.

187
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,768
Aren't yöu coming?

188
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,334
Here, take my bike and go ahead.

189
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,003
I'll join yöu soon.

190
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,836
Pun“!

191
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,126
I think that bullet
had yöur name on it.

192
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,191
It was meant for me? 
- Yes.

193
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,030
Two men came looking for
yöu after yöu left.

194
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,270
Hello. 
- Hello, Raja?

195
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,137
Call for yöu.

196
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,207
Hello. 
- Hello, Raja. This is Rudra.

197
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,045
Rudra, I was waiting for yöur call.

198
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,681
My phone's shattered.

199
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,379
I'm using my SIM card
in a different phone.

200
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:04,325
I called to ask, is everything okay? 
- Not at all.

201
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,325
The police attacked me! Did
anything happen with yöu?

202
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,556
Where are yöu?

203
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,426
Uncle, I want this mess to end.

204
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,296
So, we can continue our life normally.

205
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,032
What was normal?

206
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,775
yöu're a postman.

207
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,109
And him. He's looking for a job.

208
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,514
Even if he finds one,
how much can he earn?

209
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,951
Rupees 10,000? 20,000?

210
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,351
So, what do yöu suggest?

211
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:39,054
I suggest that yöu join my gang. 
- yöur gang?

212
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,857
yöu two are made for this.

213
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,025
Stop it.

214
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,897
How many times will I have
to do it? It's paining.

215
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,963
yöu're educated.

216
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,636
It's difficult to find educated
gangsters these days.

217
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,731
Shut up!

218
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,037
Uncle, this isn't possible.

219
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,338
Please find another way.

220
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,574
Fine, then go to jail? 
- Jail?

221
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,312
I've spent few days in there earlier.

222
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,280
When this matter calms
down, yöu can come out.

223
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,853
At least I'm not cleaning dirty plates. 
- No need to tell anyone.

224
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,188
Tell them I've found a job.
And I've gone to Delhi.

225
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,459
And the ambience here is better.

226
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,495
It's not my fault. 
- No danger.

227
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,689
Even/thing's okay.

228
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,658
Better talk to uncle
and explain to him.

229
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,361
The food's warm, eat it.

230
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,937
What a mess we're in!

231
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,536
What? 
- What a mess we're in!

232
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,077
So, would yöu like some entertainment
to be organized?

233
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,775
Another dance, perhaps?

234
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,144
Should I arrange for that?

235
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,783
Should I send yöu some pictures?

236
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,177
Just leave.

237
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,820
yöur wishes can be fulfilled
for just Rupees 5000.

238
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,288
I said leave.

239
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,553
Life's bad enough and..

240
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,689
There's one man that can
solve yöur problem.

241
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,724
My rate's 2000 rupees.

242
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,129
They're really furious.

243
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,598
I suggest that yöu apologize.

244
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
Otherwise.

245
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,266
Will yöu hold on?

246
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,996
This is for yöu.

247
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,098
Yes, sir.

248
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,608
Better take his case, otherwise
he'll get the next date.

249
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,042
Hokum Singh.. 
- Mr. Srivastav.

250
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,276
Yes. 
- This is Rudra and he's Raja.

251
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,680
I'll call yöu back in half an hour.

252
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,212
Thank yöu, sir.

253
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,411
Sit.

254
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,626
Akhand Veer's gang is after us.. 
- Hold on.

255
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,691
Yes, Jaggi.

256
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,364
I know there's an enquiry ongoing.

257
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,732
There was an enquiry against me too.

258
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,668
And I came in here. To follow
High Commands orders.

259
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,269
I became the scapegoat.

260
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,839
I don't want to talk about it.

261
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,036
Don't call me again.

262
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,370
What were yöu saying?

263
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,781
Akhand Veer's men are after us.

264
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,017
Especially, Lallan Tiwari.

265
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,486
I know. Kill those rascals.

266
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,384
Sir, we don't want to resort to
violence. We're not outlaws.

267
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,618
yöu aren't outlaws.

268
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,921
yöu two are...political commandoes.

269
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,059
Just like the army that
protects the country.

270
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,036
Similarly, those running this country.

271
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,030
..need protection as well.

272
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,870
Bureaucrats and politicians,
they also need security.

273
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,967
Do yöu agree?

274
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,102
These days, yöu two are
the talk of the town.

275
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,883
We don't want to be gangsters, sir.

276
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,483
Think about it.

277
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,633
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Welcome, brother.

278
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,265
Why didn't sister come along?

279
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,066
She's still upset because our daughter just left. 
- Okay..

280
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,174
I apologize... for staging
an attack on yöur home.

281
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:53,085
That's okay, but yöu
chose the wrong day.

282
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,256
It was my daughter Nandini's wedding.

283
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,361
It wasn't my plan. It
was Lallan Tiwari's.

284
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,926
I know.

285
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,431
Where is Lallan Tiwari?

286
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,131
Bring Lallan out.

287
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,767
Let me go. 
- Come on.

288
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,797
Let me go.

289
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,937
If anything happens to
me, there'll be a riot..

290
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,082
Brother. This man's a
bigger traitor than me!

291
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,373
Get lost.

292
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,711
Take him away. 
- Forgive me..

293
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,016
Where are yöu taking him'? 
- It's my first mistake. Forgive me.

294
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,188
Leave his punishment up to me.

295
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,518
How about a drink now?

296
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,187
It's getting warm.

297
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,101
yöu still like drinking
sugarcane-juice.

298
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,706
I can have it any time of the day.

299
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,514
Before I leave, I would like
to see Lallan's body.

300
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,085
Yes, of course.

301
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,051
Look, that's him.

302
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,551
Few men stopped Divya at college and..

303
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,980
How many were they? 
- Five.

304
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,847
Around five boys.

305
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,346
What were they asking?

306
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,448
yöur whereabouts.

307
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,652
Thank God, her Professor
saw everything.

308
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,161
..otherwise, I wonder what.

309
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,991
I'll see what I can do.

310
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,305
A few men cornered my
sister in her college.

311
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,236
Are the arrangements okay?
ls everyone there?

312
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,312
So, when do we have
to leave? I am ready.

313
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,479
What's going on?

314
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,811
Are yöu going somewhere?

315
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,786
Lallan Tiwari has killed
uncle and his men.

316
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,785
And, we aren't safe either.

317
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,546
Now?

318
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,987
I know where he is.

319
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,594
He's gone hunting in the jungle with
Akhand Veer and his sycophants.

320
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,091
That's where we'll kill him covertly.

321
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,295
What's the point in killing
them silently now?

322
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,400
It's important that everyone known.

323
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,232
..that Raja and Rudra killed them.

324
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,799
This is my personal battle.

325
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,368
Look, they misbehaved with my sister.

326
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,937
The police barged into my home!

327
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,569
They made me run like a
dog. Tried to kill me!

328
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,476
So, this is my fight too.

329
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,740
Well, I can forget...but
my anger won't let me.

330
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,710
Remember.

331
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,581
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.

332
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,755
Come back here after
yöu finish the job.

333
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,587
I like what I am seeing.

334
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,072
Stop. Stop. Stop.

335
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,386
Have yöu heard the story of Lord Brahma? 
- Do tell us.

336
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,521
yöu see...He's got just
one temple, in Pushkar.

337
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,254
Because he committed a grave sin..

338
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,855
..for which he was cursed.

339
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,839
How did the tyre burst?

340
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,383
Don't run.

341
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,348
yöu need to tell everyone this story.

342
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,752
My name is Raja Mishra.

343
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,960
And, the other gunman is Rudra.

344
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,829
Raja and Rudra.

345
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,563
From today, we'll be notorious.

346
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:05,964
Get up.

347
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,346
yöu killed my uncle.

348
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,748
And my friend too.

349
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,714
Now, it's yöur turn. Say goodbye.

350
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,448
This isn't like the movies where yöur
guns have unlimited ammunition.

351
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,786
Recognize him?

352
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,222
He's Lallan the traitor.

353
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:29,787
So, how are yöu going
to tell this story?

354
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,197
There was once a traitor
called Lallan..

355
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,637
..who betrayed his own benefactor.

356
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,328
Now go, run away.

357
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:36,832
Get lost.

358
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,874
Where are yöu going?

359
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,500
He's all yöurs.

360
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,514
What are yöu doing, Rudra?

361
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,081
Forgiveness is the best policy.

362
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,848
Forgive me. 
- Hold on. Hold on.

363
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,614
Don't yöu tell that story
about Lord Brahma?

364
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,814
Now, finish that story.

365
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,088
Raja, have yöu lost it?

366
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,527
Now, yöu're going to
hear stories from him?

367
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,688
Of course.

368
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,532
Before he dies I want to know
what Lord Brahma's sin was.

369
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,822
Tell us..

370
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,760
Why don't we pray to Lord Brahma?

371
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,434
Lord Brahma's..

372
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,938
And.. 
- And that's why he was cursed.

373
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,412
What. 
- Shoot him.

374
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,947
Now, pray to Lord Brahma.

375
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,423
Say it aloud... Hail Lord Brahma.

376
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,991
Hail Lord Brahma.

377
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,290
Say it louder, Hail Lord Brahma!

378
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,741
I can't tolerate vulgarity
in religious matters.

379
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,608
Right, buddy.

380
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,306
yöu never said anything wrong.

381
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,840
And, what was that yöu said.

382
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,914
Raja and Rudra the notorious.

383
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,476
That's nice.

384
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,046
Get some rest.

385
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,646
We don't want to rest.

386
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,449
We want to kill Akhand Veer next.

387
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,924
Don't get so impatient.

388
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,520
There's a difference between.

389
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,254
..a gangster and a political commando.

390
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,531
yöu two need political protection.

391
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,756
Hello, brother. 
- That's yöur job.

392
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,329
I am not a politician.

393
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,270
I am a political adviser.

394
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,498
A consultant.

395
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,899
To kill Akhand Veer..

396
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,031
...yöu'll need asylum with
an influential politician.

397
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,309
And I know of just such a politician
who needs yöu two.

398
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:24,936
Who?

399
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,477
Rambabu Shukla.

400
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,548
Rambabu is the most influential
Minister of the Opposition.

401
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,049
He's highly respected.

402
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,949
He wants to get rid of Minister
Nathuram permanently.

403
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,517
She's getting married.

404
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,719
Nathuram is a big pervert.

405
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,922
He gave Sumer Yadav, the assassin,
a contract to kill him.

406
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,124
And, Sumer's famously known for..

407
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,725
..never missing a target.

408
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,249
That's how accurate his aim was.

409
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,084
Was? ls he dead?

410
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,324
The police are after him.

411
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,023
So he's playing a charade
of pretending to be insane.

412
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,093
He says "I am Radha". 
- What?

413
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,262
Hare Krishna!

414
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,837
Hare Krishna!

415
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,567
Hare Krishna!

416
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,035
Sumer Yadav is delaying
Rambabu's contract.

417
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,045
So if yöu two can kill Nathuram.

418
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,843
Then, Rambabu will give yöu refuge.

419
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,074
And Akhand Veer's all yöurs.

420
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,778
And the entire security
of Uttar Pradesh.

421
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,745
...will be in the palm of yöur hands.

422
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,284
Make a plan.

423
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,256
We don't need a plan to press
the trigger, we need guts.

424
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,792
And we've no dearth of it.

425
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,590
Just arrange for some Holy Water.

426
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:50,988
Holy Water?

427
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,734
What's this mess outside my house?

428
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,637
Mr. Sharma, when yöu can't
even clean my house.

429
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,839
..how can yöu keep the city clean?

430
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,012
Clean it up. 
- We'll do it now, sir.

431
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,580
It'll be done.

432
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,741
Don't worry.

433
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,587
Watch. 
- Excuse me, sir.

434
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,418
Wait. 
- Sir.

435
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,960
I'm from Delhi, Breaking News TV. 
- Yes.

436
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,258
Yes.

437
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,727
If we can get just 15 minutes
with Nathuram sir..

438
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,164
...we'll interview him for our
TV show 'Walk the Talk'.

439
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,630
And, if yöu want to get anything
done in Delhi, just tell us.

440
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,371
Well, sir. Tell us the point.

441
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,872
..of making a statue of
yöurself and yöur family?

442
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,632
History will remember..

443
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,711
..Nathuram's sacrifices for his state.

444
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,507
Can yöu make a sacrifice? 
- Of course.

445
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,873
I can do anything for the country.

446
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,373
Great.

447
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,420
By the way, where's yöur cameraman?

448
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,656
He's shooting from afar. Wait. 
- Why?

449
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,420
Yes. 
- Bring him back.

450
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,991
The tree's blocking my view.

451
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,488
Sir, we'll head back. 
- Back?

452
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,862
Why back?

453
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,863
yöu see... we passed yöur
sacrificial ground.

454
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,224
What the...

455
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,236
Do one thing...take him
a little further back.

456
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,799
I'll shoot him from a
distance of 100 metres.

457
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,036
What's going on..! 
- I want to break Sumer Yadav's record.

458
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,713
Raja, we can break records later.

459
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,177
Let's just kill him first.

460
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,681
We'll get more chances to make a record. 
- What..!

461
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,809
Just shoot him. 
- This isn't a bad opportunity either.

462
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,180
Raja, what are yöu doing?

463
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,586
Just measure the distance!
- What's going on!

464
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,520
What are yöu doing, Raja? 
- This stick must be around one metre.

465
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,259
Stay there. 
- Yadav shot him from 100 metres.

466
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,885
It'll take us all day to
measure that distance.

467
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,420
Shoot him. 
- No, this'll only take five minutes.

468
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,794
Just count. 
- Raja.

469
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,821
They're firing.

470
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,936
Don't be too loyal for yöur own sake.

471
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,733
For the sanctity of yöur soul. 
- What's this?

472
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:38,472
Holy Water.

473
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,870
No need to sacrifice yöur
lives for this useless man.

474
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,966
Goodbye.

475
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,909
yöu shot him? Oh no.

476
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,307
Come on, come on.

477
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,645
Let's go. Let's go.

478
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,913
We still need to break
Sumer Yadav's record.

479
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,054
Hail Bajrang Bali.

480
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,265
Walk the talk!

481
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,401
yöu two have fantastic coordination.

482
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,166
<i>Ra“ .</i>

483
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,514
Who's it now?

484
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,083
Hello, sir.

485
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,591
Sumer, yöu're truly
good for nothing now.

486
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,028
yöu can pose as Radha forever.

487
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,028
yöu've been replaced.

488
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,567
Soon yöu will hear their names.

489
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,699
Let me tell yöu one thing.

490
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,332
yöu're no longer needed.

491
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,333
My job's done.

492
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,045
Don't ever take this off.

493
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,425
It will protect yöu.

494
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,691
Now yöu've Rambabu Shukla's
permission.

495
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,558
..to kill Akhand Veer Singh.

496
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,396
From today, the entire state
of Uttar Pradesh is yöurs.

497
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,136
The barricade's closed.

498
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,611
It'll take some time.

499
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,947
Stop on the side, under that tree.

500
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,263
Increase that volume.

501
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,933
Make me a glass of sugarcane juice.

502
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,737
Don't forget to squeeze the lime.

503
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,845
Do yöu think we'll be
there in half an hour?

504
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,585
This isn't right.

505
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,586
yöu've shot an unarmed man.

506
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,054
Here, yöu also shoot me.

507
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,859
I am unarmed too.

508
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,725
Shoot.

509
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,056
Shoot!

510
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,154
Rudra, run!

511
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,396
Due to the absence of four
MLA's from the Parliament.

512
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,030
The Reservation Bill
could not be passed..

513
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,543
Madam! We're talking about
the Reservation Bill!

514
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,633
Move aside!

515
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,531
Four MLA's of Ekta Party
have been exposed.

516
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,068
All four were caught with prostitutes.

517
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,503
Raja brother.

518
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,643
Raja brother.

519
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,377
Please include me in yöur gang too.

520
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,185
yöu're an artist, stay that way.

521
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,100
There's a job.

522
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,567
A meeting will be held
in two days time.

523
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,374
..in Sumaria village, next
to Sitapur, at 9pm.

524
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,877
Where Akhand Veer's
marijuana business.

525
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,049
...will be distributed amongst us.

526
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,311
Our job is providing security
to the entire consortium.

527
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:45,322
yöu two will go as my representatives.

528
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,623
This job is under the supervision
of Mr. Bajaj.

529
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,261
yöu...Two will stay quiet,
behave yöurselves.

530
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,269
Everyone knows our agenda tonight.

531
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,970
Seven months from now..

532
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,308
..there will be elections
in four states.

533
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,780
A year later, there's election
in Uttar Pradesh.

534
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:10,908
Correct.

535
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,957
I am a businessman, and
a stingy one at that.

536
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,221
We need a friendly government.

537
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,160
Right, Mr. Yadav?

538
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,235
This is why, I convinced five
of my business friends.

539
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,235
..and brought them to this meeting.

540
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,364
..to donate Rupees 100 crores
each to the party fund.

541
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,371
But, this isn't enough.

542
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,675
We need more money.

543
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,047
And this shortage will be covered by..

544
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,415
..Akhand Veer's marijuana business.

545
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,315
Which will be under
my control from today.

546
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,320
And for that I'll need protection.

547
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,015
Which will be provided
by Rambabu Shukla.

548
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,989
yöu all know Mr. Saxena.

549
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,392
The government will support us too.

550
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,398
And in return, we'll donate
20% to the Police fund.

551
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,262
Mr. Saxena!

552
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,061
So, the opposition. 
- Mr. Saxena!

553
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,626
Hey, sir!

554
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,471
Weren't yöu the Inspector
General in Agra?

555
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,337
My good name is Raja Mishra.

556
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,976
He's Rudra Tripathi. 
- Hello.

557
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,673
If we lose this elections.
- Did yöu recognize him?

558
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,640
Wasn't he caught in that
Agra girl's hostel scam?

559
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,645
Yes, he was!

560
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,217
yöu look healthier than before, sir.

561
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,819
yöu're healthier, aren't yöu?

562
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,412
By the way, what are yöu doing here?

563
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,683
We're in-charge of the security here.

564
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,616
What can the police do here?

565
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,452
Hello! Bajaj sir.

566
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,085
Bali] sir!

567
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,555
yöu haven't even introduced
us to anyone here.

568
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,423
yöu two...

569
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,164
yöu two are here only to show yöur
faces silently, not to give advice.

570
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,107
Bajaj sir, we were just. 
- What?

571
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,407
Are we cracking jokes here?

572
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,580
If yöu want to crack jokes,
then do it someplace else.

573
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,210
Stupid monkeys.

574
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,719
He called us monkeys.

575
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:00,586
I feel insulted too. 
- It's been a long time since I felt like this.

576
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,430
This scoundrel Bajaj.. 
- Go on.

577
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,200
No, yöu go first.

578
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,402
But, I already know what
yöu were going to say.

579
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:12,399
What?

580
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,243
Exactly what I was going to say.

581
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,945
Take the car to the airport
and pick up my wife.

582
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,211
No, I don't need anyone.
yöu can all go.

583
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,786
Hello. Yes.

584
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,148
Speaking. Fine.

585
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,758
Where is she? 
- In the room.

586
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,655
And the room booked under? 
- My name.

587
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,319
I can never make a mistake
regarding that.

588
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,586
Good.

589
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,427
Sir, here's her medical report.

590
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,931
It's absolutely clear.

591
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,172
Sit.

592
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,744
Nice.

593
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,821
Why do yöu look so worried?

594
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,584
I put my faith in yöu
and called yöu here.

595
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,623
And when I saw yöur
photograph, I knew..

596
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,258
..that, yöu're not just beautiful,
but also smart.

597
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,304
Emotional as well.

598
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,330
Aren't yöu?

599
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,843
Yes, sir. 
- Come closer.

600
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,005
Sir, there's not much I can do.

601
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,448
I can just kiss yöur cheeks.

602
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,110
Will that do?

603
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,209
Ok?

604
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,245
Close yöur eyes.

605
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,080
OK ?

606
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,148
Come on.

607
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,494
Who is it? 
- Room service.

608
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,295
I ordered for it. Papaya. 
- I see.

609
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,936
We'll make a huge film with yöu.

610
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,096
Big one.

611
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,113
yöu two? How dare yöu..

612
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,517
Sir, who are they?

613
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,080
Who are yöu?

614
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,547
I don't know him.

615
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,414
I just came here to ask for
work. Please let me go.

616
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,222
yöu chose the wrong time to
be here. yöu can't leave now.

617
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,795
Come on, Bajaj. Get up.

618
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,491
yöu two are venting out yöur frustrations
about the other night?

619
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,692
Have yöu two lost yöur mind?

620
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,001
Who do yöu think yöu are?

621
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,864
yöu don't boss us around anymore.

622
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,041
So listen carefully, Bajaj.

623
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,975
Don't do anything to humiliate us.

624
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,314
Right now we're only kidnapping yöu.

625
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,115
But if yöu provoke us..

626
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,856
...we'll first beat yöu to a pulp.

627
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,321
then kill yöu.

628
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,225
A hungry Brahmin...is gentle.

629
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,597
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.

630
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,862
Hello, Mr. Bajaj. How are yöu?

631
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,698
Hello. Hello. 
- Walk faster. Come on.

632
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,676
Please walk faster.

633
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,644
Come. Come.

634
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,177
Come. 
- Don't misbehave.

635
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,405
Sit.

636
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,475
Please let me go! I promise
I won't tell anyone.

637
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:15,248
We'll decide what to do with yöu
after this operation's over.

638
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,790
Sit comfortably.

639
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,191
Don't misunderstand us.

640
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,085
We respect women.

641
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,930
Do yöu two know what will happen next?

642
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,839
This operation is personal.

643
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,772
No one else is involved.

644
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,171
So, there's no room for compromise.

645
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,336
Get it.

646
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:41,943
Make the call.

647
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,011
Don't yöu play cricket. 
- He sponsors the cricket team.

648
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,987
He just plays all games with his mouth.

649
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,648
How did yöu get mixed up with him?

650
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,914
<i>Useless.</i>

651
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,584
Listen, Dibakar.

652
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,196
The Treasury House ruins.

653
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,266
..behind the Residency, Museum House..

654
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,529
Just listen what I am saying!

655
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,467
Put Rupees 50 million in a bag..

656
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,469
..and leave it there in two hours time.

657
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,164
I want to donate it to someone.

658
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,066
Disconnect the line.

659
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:18,242
yöur silence...could've
cost yöu yöur life.

660
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,121
We're going to collect the money.

661
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:25,826
No, no. I'll go. 
- Why are yöu always competing?

662
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,421
Fine, yöu go. Go on.

663
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,559
Yes, I will.

664
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,901
Don't hit on the girl.

665
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,230
Are yöu accusing me? 
- Let go.

666
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,668
Are yöu accusing me? 
- Rudra!

667
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:53,785
Hey Shaukat. 
- Yes, sir.

668
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,379
Get the fertilizer from
the plant nursery.

669
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,049
And get some new rose plants.

670
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,149
Hey, we're in Kaiser Baug.

671
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,485
That's the Police Inspector
General's bungalow.

672
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,798
What do we do? It's
a bad habit of ours.

673
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,799
We like to sin standing
by the gates of Hell.

674
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,805
Hello. Madam. Are yöu enjoying this?

675
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,772
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it louder.

676
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,296
yöu women watch a lot of TV serials.

677
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,432
They are all the same.

678
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,698
What do yöu watch? 
- Me?

679
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,838
We watch the news.

680
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,471
The Animal Channel.
National Geographic.

681
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,238
All news channels are same.

682
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,044
Animals are not the same.

683
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,211
Did yöu know that a crow
never deceives his mate?

684
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,346
They have the same partner
all their life.

685
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,348
I mean... even crows are better
than the likes of him.

686
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,623
I'm telling the truth..

687
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,005
Take the other car.

688
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,186
Are yöu Bengali? 
- Yes.

689
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,056
I love Bengali sweets? 
- Really.

690
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,250
I can make them.

691
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,791
Really? 
- Yes.

692
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,917
That one... What's it called? 
- Rosogulla?

693
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,256
No. They're smaller? 
- 'Sandesh'.

694
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,799
'Oham-cham, Malai cham-cham',
'Lady Ginni' Misti Doi.

695
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,737
Wow. And yöu too. 
- What?

696
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,210
Stop. That's the car.

697
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,352
Did yöu see anyone get down from this car? 
- No.

698
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,082
Ruby Tailors, Rai Bareili.

699
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,823
It's the Rai Bareili gang.
Let's go to Rai Bareili.

700
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,887
Wrong. It all seems wrong.

701
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,965
The yellow leaves falling in autumn.

702
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,100
The blossoming of flowers in monsoon.

703
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,502
The white drops falling
from the black clouds.

704
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,538
Without yöu, even the moonlight
scorches my body.

705
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,607
And the light.

706
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,404
Hold on.. I'm really sorry.

707
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,486
This is the first time
this has happened.

708
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,790
yöu made me very emotional.

709
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,955
What are yöu both doing here?
- Nothing, just some nonsense.

710
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,557
The man yöu spoke to, Bajaj..

711
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,066
..was very smart.

712
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,190
ls it all here? 
- Yes.

713
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,226
He guessed something fishy
from yöur silence.

714
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,829
And his men were there.

715
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,535
Then? 
- Then what? I played them.

716
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,140
Thank God yöu didn't come along? 
- Why?

717
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,942
Otherwise yöu would've just shot them.

718
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,108
And complicated the matter. 
- Right.

719
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,040
Thank God I didn't go.

720
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,845
Come here.

721
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:22,056
Did yöu "Fire" yet? 
- Yes, But I missed the target.

722
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,486
How do yöu know?

723
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,259
Because, my "Bullets" don't kill..

724
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,959
They awaken the animal inside others.

725
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,594
Fine. Come on.

726
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,031
Heera, take the bag and leave.

727
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,233
I'm leaving yöu two here.. 
- Leaving us?

728
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,006
Why are yöu leaving us? I paid yöu.

729
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,943
Lower yöur voice. 
- I paid yöu..

730
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,002
Quiet.

731
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,440
yöu can leave after an hour.

732
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,078
My man's watching the door.

733
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,888
If yöu leave earlier than
one hour...he'll kill yöu.

734
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,218
Shall we go? 
- Hold on.

735
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,583
Lover-boy.

736
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,059
Go home. yöur mobile's with me.

737
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,489
Buy a new one.

738
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,159
Goodbye.

739
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,608
Listen. 
- Yes.

740
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,646
Can I come with yöu two?

741
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,742
I don't know anyone here.
- yöu can't stay with us.

742
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,115
She didn't ask if she
could stay with us.

743
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,613
And what if I do?

744
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,278
His bullet's hit the target.

745
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,152
There's always danger
in staying with us.

746
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,856
We're dangerous people. 
- That's okay. It'll be fun.

747
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,790
yöu can be a threat to us.

748
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,126
We cannot trust yöu.

749
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,433
If l, as a girl, can trust yöu,
then why can't yöu trust me?

750
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,666
yöu two are such cowards.

751
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,933
We're being decent and yöu're taking offense. 
- Rudra.

752
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,167
Let's take her along.

753
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,172
And if she bungles up I'll
be the first to shoot her..

754
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:45,702
Get lost.

755
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,250
Hello. 
- Hello.

756
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,480
All okay? 
- Yes, go on.

757
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:31,815
So, this is our house.

758
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,554
Go, get some rest. yöu must be tired.

759
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,625
No girl's ever entered in here.

760
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:39,461
I mean...before we did everything in
that department outside the house.

761
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,297
Meaning?

762
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:41,866
Hello.

763
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,300
I'm going to get some sleep.

764
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,373
I guess yöu will take care of
her sleeping arrangements.

765
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,467
No, no it's not like that...she'll
sleep down here.

766
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,907
I don't care.

767
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,604
I'll stay up there..

768
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,120
I wasn't chosen for such a
big mission for no reason.

769
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,857
yöu didn't use yöur brains.

770
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,590
yöu can't even handle the
security of the bungalow.

771
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,297
Did yöu realize how we came in?

772
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,904
Listen. I let yöu in because
yöu're still a friend.

773
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,334
Otherwise, there would've
been a loud bang.

774
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,940
..and yöur body would be..

775
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,337
...lying on the grass somewhere.

776
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,135
What are yöu doing?

777
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,608
Knead the dough properly. 
- Yes.

778
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,102
Pass me a 'Puri'. 
- It's tasty.

779
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,738
Puri's are called Lucchi's in Bengali.

780
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,475
And, we temper the vegetables
with 5 spices.

781
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,247
That's why it tastes different.

782
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,086
This doesn't taste like regular
curry. It's got a special touch.

783
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,822
Let's change our profession.

784
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,359
Open up a Bengali confectionary.
What do yöu say?

785
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:49,328
Get up. yöu can't stay here. 
- What did I do?

786
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,530
yöu didn't do anything. yöu just
can't stay here, that's it.

787
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,767
Come on.
- What're yöu doing? Let go.

788
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,465
What're yöu doing, Raja?

789
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,467
Why do yöu always misbehave?
- What are yöu doing?

790
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,912
yöu don't like her. So,
she won't stay here.

791
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,279
Sorry, okay. 
- No, no, it's completely my fault.

792
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,180
I shouldn't have brought her here.

793
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,652
Why? She's nice.

794
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,245
She likes yöu too.

795
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,355
But, yöu don't like her.

796
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,554
Stan the car.

797
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,192
Come on. - Hey...

798
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,055
Hello...

799
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:20,924
Listen.

800
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,304
yöu just fell head over heels for her.

801
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,336
I thought yöu'd find a girl,
introduce me to her..

802
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,169
..and I would approve of her for yöu.

803
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,900
But that process didn't happen.

804
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,745
So, can't I be a little angry?

805
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,613
yöu sound like a nagging relative.

806
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,708
Listen,
Where are yöu going?

807
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,209
Listen.

808
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,553
No one's going anywhere.

809
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,955
Now, I'm going to treat yöu
to the culinary delicacies.

810
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,286
..of Uttar Pradesh.

811
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:49,191
I don't want it.

812
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,296
I thought yöu two would
make good friends.

813
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,932
We are all good friends.

814
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,396
Raja, apologize.

815
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:58,600
And listen...be decent.

816
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,333
L...

817
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,034
I am..

818
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:08,572
I love yöu!

819
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,416
This is my apology and my promise.

820
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,449
Of love.

821
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,629
It's Rambabu.

822
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,995
What am I hearing?

823
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,600
yöu two kidnapped Bajaj.

824
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,934
Didn't anyone tell yöu how
rudely he behaved with us?

825
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,033
Fine, what's done is done.

826
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,779
He wanted security for
his business, right?

827
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,948
Consider it a demonstration
of our capability.

828
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:42,606
Remember one thing.

829
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,152
yöu never harm a milch cow.

830
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,683
Just scare her. Get that?

831
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,490
She's refusing.

832
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,690
He's said we need to lay low
for a while. Leave town.

833
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,694
Where can we go?

834
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,930
Delhi? 
- Almost everyone knows us in Delhi.

835
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,459
We can't sit holed up in a room.

836
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,368
How about Mumbai? 
- Yes.

837
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:07,864
Mumbai's okay.

838
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:09,772
No one knows us there.

839
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,735
I'll show yöu two around Mumbai.

840
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,437
Just him.

841
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,242
I'll take yöu..

842
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:19,378
I love yöu too.

843
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,895
First time flying.

844
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,836
Small kids are travelling along too.

845
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,267
This is an experience. 
- yöu call this an experience?

846
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,508
Are yöu more experienced than I am? 
- Fine.

847
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,036
If anything happens.

848
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:56,356
Sir, that's the adjoining room, like yöu requested. 
- Yes.

849
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,722
And that's the bedroom.

850
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,317
I'll take a look.

851
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,119
Come in, buddy.

852
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,160
I hope yöu booked me a different room.

853
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,731
That's the first thing I did.

854
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,695
Yes, that's more like it.

855
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,927
Have a nice day, sir.

856
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:16,465
How about we get some food. 
- Get some food?

857
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,543
How about I buy the
entire place for yöu?

858
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,270
Nonsense.

859
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,514
Anything else, sir? 
- No.

860
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,517
Where do yöu hail from? 
- Mumbai, sir.

861
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,219
Vinod Mohite. Maharashtra.

862
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,490
Have yöu heard about Rani Laxmibai? 
- What, sir?

863
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,992
The Queen of Jhansi. 
- What, sir?

864
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,927
She was a Maharashtrian as well.

865
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,695
I didn't know, sir. 
- Yes.

866
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,403
She was born in Benaras.

867
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,942
Benaras? UP?

868
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,404
I didn't know, sir.

869
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,383
A lot of Maharashtrians.

870
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,247
..have been living in Benaras
for the last 300-400 years.

871
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,409
And we all live together like a family.

872
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,090
Keep this. 
- No, sir.

873
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,848
Take it. 
- No, sir. Thank yöu.

874
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,895
Yes, sir. 
- We want to meet, Mr. Mishra.

875
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,864
Raja.

876
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,400
Will yöu keep playing with guns
all day or can we go out?

877
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,509
What's so great about this city? 
- Yeah.

878
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,984
It's our first time here, but it
seems like we've seen it all.

879
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:35,784
Look!

880
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,855
They're shooting a film there! 
- Where?

881
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,585
Which one? 
- Where? Where?

882
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,650
There!

883
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:42,985
Yes.

884
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,525
Emraan! 
- Emraan!

885
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,267
Emraan Hashmi. 
- Emraan Hashmi.

886
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,394
Emraan.

887
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,349
Goodnight. Goodnight.

888
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,186
Now, get lost. 
- Fine.

889
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,565
Goodnight.

890
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,132
Goodnight.

891
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,611
Are yöu going to sleep here?

892
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,648
What will she think?

893
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:54,849
I have a problem.

894
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,445
Problem?

895
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,293
What's the problem?

896
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,725
Look, when I..

897
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,794
Got it. Go on.

898
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,871
I always take a different girl's name.

899
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,738
Few times...we were at the verge of..

900
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,404
Then?

901
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,018
But the girl got up in a rage and left.

902
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,190
I've no regrets about those who left.

903
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,721
But if she leaves, I'll
be really upset.

904
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,889
It's all because yöu close yöur eyes.

905
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,230
Do it with yöur eyes open.

906
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:43,003
And.. 
- Look at her.

907
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,671
yöu won't get distracted.

908
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:48,774
What are yöu saying?

909
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:52,935
Now go.

910
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,081
And listen. 
- Yes.

911
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,913
Keep yöur eyes open. 
- Yes sir.

912
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,789
Hare Krishna!

913
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,585
Hare Krishna!

914
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,021
Hare Krishna! 
- Brother Sumer.

915
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,823
Hare Krishna! 
- Someone's here to see yöu.

916
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:08,984
Hare Krishna!

917
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,119
Fantastic.

918
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,033
The feelings fantastic.

919
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,399
..when I devout my entire day to God.

920
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,230
I don't see the negativity
in this world.

921
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,970
It took me time to recognize yöu.

922
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,570
All okay?

923
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,679
I am just like I've always been.

924
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,611
I'm still a man.

925
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:32,015
But sometimes yöu do get
distracted from God.

926
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:36,180
And when yöu do, yöu feel
like killing someone.

927
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,858
Raja and Rudra have been distracting
yöu a lot these days.

928
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,252
yöu got me. yöu got me.

929
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,766
Bajaj got me. Very good.

930
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,629
Now, what do yöu expect to do with me?

931
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,065
Rape me?

932
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:56,904
Look, yöu came looking for
me because yöu need me.

933
01:08:57,032 --> 01:09:00,013
Sumer Yadav, yöu're an exhausted gun.

934
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,676
No one needs yöu.

935
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,380
Raja and Rudra will kill yöu someday.

936
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,052
And I will decide what
day that will be.

937
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,249
I'm a shrewd businessman.

938
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,384
I know how to utilize a torn note.

939
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,662
Do yöu have any virility left in yöu..

940
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,291
..or is it all gone?

941
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,665
Try me, I'm still the man I used to be.

942
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,970
What's the job? 
- Gather around yöur men..

943
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,872
..and bid goodbye to the Lord.

944
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:34,812
All I need is yöur support

945
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,580
Then, watch how I explode.

946
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,680
Hello. Hello.

947
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,124
Hello. 
- Hello.

948
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:49,191
How are yöu, Mr. Engineer? 
- All good.

949
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,258
Why don't yöu ask Mr. Shukla to
get his son-in-law promoted.

950
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,967
It's due for two years.

951
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,235
Change yöur name and
yöu'll be promoted.

952
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,337
What is everyone doing here
away from the house?

953
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,275
Brother Rudra said..

954
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,444
Yes. 
- Why did yöu send all the boys here?

955
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,282
Divya's getting engaged. yöu
had to invite everyone.

956
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,118
It's a happy occasion, that
doesn't come too often.

957
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,722
I'm leaving now with Mitali as well.

958
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,188
Mitali.

959
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,286
Let's go.

960
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,027
Sudarshan, get the car..

961
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,268
No, no...don't make that mistake.

962
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,636
No, no, no.

963
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:42,114
Small things can do impossible feats.

964
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,582
And Marwaris can go a step beyond.

965
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,082
Looking very handsome.

966
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,379
And let me.. 
- Mister.

967
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,786
How about we talk in Hindi.

968
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,155
I'm still a little patriotic at heart.

969
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,452
Do yöu know him?

970
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,698
Where's the girl? 
- What girl?

971
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,468
The one yöu snatched from me.

972
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,873
These days she's been flying around
like a butterﬂy with yöu two.

973
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,574
Find her. Find my star.

974
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,722
Son, come join us for food. 
- Coming.

975
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,292
yöu've a huge collection of books.

976
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:35,894
What's this?

977
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,995
Keep it back, it's not for yöu.

978
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,533
I can see that.

979
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,935
I only read religious texts.

980
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,637
'Saaya Mein Dhoop.'

981
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,210
What does it mean?

982
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,281
There's no girl here, but
we found this mobile.

983
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:54,812
She's here. She's right here.

984
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,117
Find her. Find her. 
- Hold on.

985
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,385
Hold on. Hold on.

986
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,087
yöu want the money, don't yöu?

987
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,957
I'll give yöu the money,
but let Mitali go.

988
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,298
I will certainly take my money.

989
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:10,196
But today I've come here
only for pleasure.

990
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,836
First I'll taste that Bengali sweet.

991
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,338
And then...send yöu away.

992
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,266
After that, yöur partner.

993
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,743
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.

994
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,777
Deal with him.

995
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,044
Mister, just get it over with..

996
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,012
Forgive me, Bajaj sir.

997
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,557
It was all that Raja's plan.

998
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,056
I really respect yöu.

999
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,826
As much as I respect Bhagat Singh..

1000
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,760
Let me show yöu.

1001
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,660
Watch.

1002
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,397
Watch, sir..

1003
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,004
Rascal.

1004
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,177
Son. Food.

1005
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:56,572
Please come.

1006
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,966
Yes. 
- Raja's just left.

1007
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,071
Sumer. Stop.

1008
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,484
Raja's coming. 
- Let's take care of both today.

1009
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,210
yöu can't even handle one.

1010
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,447
If he arrives, these two
will spell trouble for us.

1011
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,998
He's alone, we'll kill him. 
- He can take yöu on alone. Get in..

1012
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,235
yöu don't understand. 
- yöu will end up dead yöurself.

1013
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,998
Listen to me. 
- Let's go.

1014
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,401
Let's go.

1015
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,441
Stop the car. Stop. 
- What's wrong?

1016
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,780
Hurry up. 
- Come on, Sumer.

1017
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,110
Hurry UP..

1018
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,380
Why yöu.. 
- yöu want to shoot me.

1019
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,852
Shoot me. Shoot me.

1020
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,651
Listen.

1021
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:17,028
Dare to barge into the
house and kill my target.

1022
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,153
Hurry UP...

1023
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:19,755
Then kill me.

1024
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,732
Hurry UP...

1025
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,025
Kill me.

1026
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,823
I'll call Raja! 
- No.

1027
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,657
There comes my friend. 
- Raja.

1028
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,875
Who was it? 
- It was Bajaj, there was another man with him.

1029
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,706
..whose voice I couldn't recognise. 
- They fled.

1030
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:04,900
Heera!

1031
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,477
How was Divya's engagement?
- Forget that.

1032
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:10,584
Heera! Call the ambulance!

1033
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,313
I'm leaving yöu, buddy.

1034
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,479
It was the best time of my life with yöu. 
- What?

1035
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,458
How can yöu leave me?

1036
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:37,675
No!

1037
01:15:41,974 --> 01:15:44,978
Long live Rudra.

1038
01:15:45,044 --> 01:15:48,253
Long live Rudra.

1039
01:16:14,473 --> 01:16:19,149
l, Raja Mishra, son
of Ramsharan Mishra..

1040
01:16:19,912 --> 01:16:24,190
..caste Shandilya, district Azamgarh..

1041
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:30,830
..swear to avenge yöur death,
before sunset tomorrow.

1042
01:16:33,592 --> 01:16:35,697
Otherwise, I'll burn myself alive.

1043
01:16:38,697 --> 01:16:40,233
Get yöurself arrested
for minor felonies.

1044
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,435
Stay behind bars.

1045
01:16:43,302 --> 01:16:44,508
The situation isn't safe outside.

1046
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,081
What about yöu?

1047
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:51,253
I'll take care of this situation.

1048
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:52,889
We won't let yöu go alone.. 
- I must!

1049
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:01,328
What have yöu decided?

1050
01:17:01,553 --> 01:17:03,055
To take care of Bajaj, what else?

1051
01:17:05,824 --> 01:17:09,135
yöur anger is justified. But, not yet.

1052
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,641
Then, when?

1053
01:17:15,234 --> 01:17:18,443
This is personal.

1054
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:21,079
There's no politics in this.

1055
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,079
There was another man who
helped Bajaj kill Rudra.

1056
01:17:26,178 --> 01:17:27,156
I am looking for him too.

1057
01:17:27,212 --> 01:17:30,853
Going against Bajaj means going
against the entire system.

1058
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:34,793
The system, or yöu?

1059
01:17:40,592 --> 01:17:42,094
I've always supported yöu.

1060
01:17:44,596 --> 01:17:46,837
So ask the system to be careful.

1061
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:50,037
Because I've lost my mind.

1062
01:17:51,603 --> 01:17:53,446
And I will strangle the whole system.

1063
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,553
I'm not going to listen to anyone.

1064
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:05,652
This is going to be big.

1065
01:18:08,387 --> 01:18:10,628
Now it is Raja's turn. 
- Move the car.

1066
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:12,391
I'll take care of him for good.

1067
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:14,765
What's going on, Shamsher?

1068
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,303
Hey idiots, get out.

1069
01:18:16,528 --> 01:18:18,371
Who is it? 
- How are yöu, Bajaj?

1070
01:18:18,464 --> 01:18:21,707
Brother, spare me some alms. 
- Get lost.

1071
01:18:44,857 --> 01:18:46,700
Have yöu lost yöur mind?

1072
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:50,430
Stop, Raja. Stop.

1073
01:19:04,476 --> 01:19:05,477
Look.

1074
01:19:06,044 --> 01:19:07,045
No, Raja.

1075
01:19:18,557 --> 01:19:21,060
Look, Raja. Everyone has seen yöu.

1076
01:19:21,293 --> 01:19:23,773
yöu cannot escape. 
- I don't want to escape.

1077
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:31,937
Raja.

1078
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:35,842
Look, Raja. yöu cannot escape.

1079
01:19:36,074 --> 01:19:38,782
Look, Raja. No, Raja.

1080
01:19:40,345 --> 01:19:41,346
Brother!

1081
01:19:44,283 --> 01:19:45,387
Here yöu go.

1082
01:19:47,753 --> 01:19:49,755
Hey...look. No. No.

1083
01:20:04,736 --> 01:20:06,943
The gun should disappear.
- It'll be done.

1084
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:13,315
yöu made a big mistake by killing
the artist inside yöu.

1085
01:20:14,379 --> 01:20:15,790
Keep in touch. 
- Yes.

1086
01:20:16,915 --> 01:20:20,294
The businessman Jatin Bajaj, who
was also called the 'Kuber'..

1087
01:20:20,385 --> 01:20:22,592
..was murdered in broad daylight
at Hazrathganj Square.

1088
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:25,529
This incident has sent waves
through the political world.

1089
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:28,900
Even after the continuous investigations
by the police.

1090
01:20:28,994 --> 01:20:32,203
The people of Lucknow refuse
to speak about this murder.

1091
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:35,678
Mitali, I told yöu.

1092
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:38,572
Go back to Kolkata, back home.

1093
01:20:40,472 --> 01:20:43,009
If I had wanted to leave, I would
have done it a long time ago.

1094
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,684
What's this?

1095
01:20:52,117 --> 01:20:53,221
This is mine.

1096
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:55,360
From today. 
- Have yöu lost yöur mind?

1097
01:21:01,326 --> 01:21:03,272
If anything could measure our anger..

1098
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:05,899
Then we would be at
the same temperature.

1099
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,680
Don't distance me from yöurself.

1100
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:14,916
I cannot replace our friend Rudra.

1101
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:20,781
But I will do anything for
yöu, at any time yöu want.

1102
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:34,600
I'm here to talk to
yöu, not arrest yöu.

1103
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:38,439
yöu killed Bajaj. In public.

1104
01:21:39,364 --> 01:21:40,741
People are so scared of yöu..

1105
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:42,541
..that no one's ready
to testify against yöu

1106
01:21:42,634 --> 01:21:44,671
They aren't scared. They respect me.

1107
01:21:45,404 --> 01:21:46,542
Whatever it is.

1108
01:21:46,838 --> 01:21:48,545
I want yöu to lay low for a while.

1109
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:52,253
Lay low? yöu mean run away.

1110
01:21:52,878 --> 01:21:55,085
If yöu lay low everyone will
think yöu've calmed down.

1111
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:58,220
Otherwise, Bajaj has many well wishers.

1112
01:21:58,517 --> 01:22:00,190
And they are all furious for revenge.

1113
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:03,093
Are yöu threatening me?

1114
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:06,060
Because let me make it clear,
Inspector General sir.

1115
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:07,929
Threats don't scare me.

1116
01:22:08,627 --> 01:22:09,662
And I'm a Brahmin.

1117
01:22:10,329 --> 01:22:11,774
I was born intelligent.

1118
01:22:12,564 --> 01:22:15,306
Tell Bajafs well wishers to
stay in mourning for him.

1119
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:18,003
And not to get too furious.

1120
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,608
Otherwise, all their families
will be mourning for them.

1121
01:22:23,608 --> 01:22:26,111
If yöu leave, it will save the
reputation of the police.

1122
01:22:26,178 --> 01:22:27,589
I am not going anywhere!

1123
01:22:28,246 --> 01:22:31,853
If yöu value yöur reputation,
then arrest me.

1124
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:35,296
Otherwise, employ a sharp shooter.

1125
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:37,860
..that has the guts to aim at me.

1126
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:43,136
Fine. Rambabuji sent me to talk to yöu.

1127
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:47,009
I'll tell him that yöu've
lost yöur mind.

1128
01:22:51,403 --> 01:22:53,383
Tell him...l lost my brother.

1129
01:22:54,673 --> 01:22:57,017
And our tradition is
'an eye for an eye'.

1130
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:58,811
We don't follow corporate culture.

1131
01:22:59,411 --> 01:23:02,017
And cover up our losses
in the next deal.

1132
01:23:02,714 --> 01:23:05,627
The one who makes a mistake has to pay.

1133
01:23:06,585 --> 01:23:08,724
And I won't spare him
till the next deal.

1134
01:23:09,621 --> 01:23:10,895
That's my culture.

1135
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,737
He isn't listening to me.
- yöu try explaining to him.

1136
01:23:14,826 --> 01:23:16,464
Mr. Tripathi, let me talk to him. 
- Let's go.

1137
01:23:16,595 --> 01:23:17,596
Bless yöu.

1138
01:23:18,597 --> 01:23:20,099
We're here to tell yöu that.

1139
01:23:20,232 --> 01:23:22,234
..we won't live for too long.

1140
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:24,441
If anything happens to yöu..

1141
01:23:24,503 --> 01:23:27,347
Son. No one dares to face us
because they're scared of yöu.

1142
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:29,441
But everyone's looking for a..

1143
01:23:32,577 --> 01:23:34,386
What if something happens to yöu?

1144
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,755
yöu two have made a lot of enemies.

1145
01:23:39,684 --> 01:23:41,288
They won't leave us alone.

1146
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,827
If yöu want to see us alive,
then leave town for some time.

1147
01:23:47,626 --> 01:23:49,367
Look, uncle.. 
- Look, son.

1148
01:23:50,295 --> 01:23:53,765
Think about Rudra's family.

1149
01:23:54,499 --> 01:23:56,172
Now, they are yöur responsibility.

1150
01:23:56,902 --> 01:23:58,347
Come with me to Kolkata.

1151
01:24:02,674 --> 01:24:03,550
Sister.

1152
01:24:03,642 --> 01:24:06,316
She went to Mumbai to become a heroine.

1153
01:24:07,712 --> 01:24:08,656
Go. 
- Go.

1154
01:24:08,713 --> 01:24:09,851
We want to go this way.

1155
01:24:09,981 --> 01:24:11,324
Fine, go. 
- Go.

1156
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:14,824
No, it's not possible. Acting is fine.

1157
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:17,193
We encourage talent like
any other Bengali family.

1158
01:24:17,322 --> 01:24:20,360
But marrying outside the
community... Impossible!

1159
01:24:20,525 --> 01:24:21,560
Pardon me.. 
- Mom.

1160
01:24:21,726 --> 01:24:22,830
It's okay.

1161
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:26,507
What do yöu do? 
- I work in a bank.

1162
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:28,733
Assistant Manager.

1163
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:32,780
And salary? 
- A lot.

1164
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,350
yöu want to know his
salary? Bad manners!

1165
01:24:35,407 --> 01:24:37,819
yöu brought a stranger to this
house without informing us.

1166
01:24:37,943 --> 01:24:39,251
Isn't that bad manners?

1167
01:24:39,478 --> 01:24:41,151
Uncle, why don't yöu say something?

1168
01:24:41,246 --> 01:24:42,418
Aren't yöu a communist?

1169
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:43,754
That's surprising.

1170
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:45,828
What has being a communist
got to do with it?

1171
01:24:45,984 --> 01:24:47,554
A communist is a communist.

1172
01:24:47,786 --> 01:24:49,094
Family's family.

1173
01:24:49,688 --> 01:24:51,395
He'll be our son-in-law.

1174
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:53,433
I can tell from the face.

1175
01:24:53,558 --> 01:24:55,367
So what if he isn't Bengali. 
- Greetings.

1176
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,997
My granddaughter will marry only him.

1177
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,841
Mother, what are yöu doing?

1178
01:24:59,965 --> 01:25:03,208
He's my son-in-law. So handsome.

1179
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:21,730
I respect him too.

1180
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,803
That's why I am quiet.

1181
01:29:24,496 --> 01:29:26,840
Everyone please request Rambabu..

1182
01:29:26,965 --> 01:29:29,571
...to stop supporting Raja Mishra!

1183
01:29:30,769 --> 01:29:35,013
Bajaj's death has sent waves through
the business community.

1184
01:29:35,607 --> 01:29:38,645
Look, Bajaj supported us and yöu too.

1185
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,887
Now that he's dead, how am I..

1186
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:44,119
..going to contest in the
elections, and how are yöu?

1187
01:29:44,215 --> 01:29:46,388
Raja doesn't just have
my support alone.

1188
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:48,495
All the Brahmins and Muslims.

1189
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,124
..of the state support him too.

1190
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:53,100
yöungsters idolize him as their hero.

1191
01:29:54,626 --> 01:29:58,130
Look.. 
- Some decisions should be taken.

1192
01:29:58,296 --> 01:30:00,333
..beyond loss and gain, Balram Yadav.

1193
01:30:00,431 --> 01:30:03,708
Fine. Fine. yöu're taking me lightly.

1194
01:30:03,768 --> 01:30:05,179
..so yöu can talk to Srivastav.

1195
01:30:05,303 --> 01:30:07,806
Only he knows where Bajafs money is.

1196
01:30:07,939 --> 01:30:08,940
Talk to him.

1197
01:30:09,007 --> 01:30:10,884
Stan the connection, son. Open it.

1198
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,155
Hello, Srivastav sir.

1199
01:30:15,046 --> 01:30:17,117
This will be our last conversation.

1200
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:19,389
..if yöu don't do something
about Raja Mishra!

1201
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:21,519
No one will get a penny
for the election.

1202
01:30:21,553 --> 01:30:23,590
And, yöu can decide the outcome
with a wrestling match.

1203
01:30:24,055 --> 01:30:27,264
And look, don't try to use force on me.

1204
01:30:27,392 --> 01:30:30,032
Because, I know the secrets
of every VIP in this country.

1205
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:31,731
And the day I expose them.

1206
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,832
President's Emergency Rule will
be applied in the country.

1207
01:30:33,932 --> 01:30:35,912
I've no news about Raja.

1208
01:30:36,267 --> 01:30:39,043
As soon as I find out
I'll send him to yöu.

1209
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,411
He'll apologise to yöu.

1210
01:30:41,539 --> 01:30:42,540
Apologise?

1211
01:30:42,874 --> 01:30:45,480
This isn't a childish
mistake, Rambabuji.

1212
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:47,351
Kuber's been murdered.

1213
01:30:47,445 --> 01:30:48,981
Do yöu understand the
meaning of 'Kuber'?

1214
01:30:49,147 --> 01:30:51,093
'The God of wealth'. Bajaj.

1215
01:30:51,549 --> 01:30:54,359
yöu need to decide how
to deal with Raja.

1216
01:30:55,053 --> 01:30:58,398
I'll read the news in the papers
and release yöur election funds.

1217
01:30:58,556 --> 01:30:59,557
Goodnight.

1218
01:31:09,767 --> 01:31:13,476
At this age, I cannot
change profession.

1219
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,083
Better do the right thing.

1220
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:22,314
Come on, get the car.

1221
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:24,493
Inspector General sir. 
- Yes.

1222
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:28,791
Why don't yöu join politics
after retirement?

1223
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,924
Take advantage of..

1224
01:31:31,055 --> 01:31:32,966
..finishing off an outlaw
gangster like Raja Mishra

1225
01:31:33,124 --> 01:31:35,195
Look, all our betterment lies in it.

1226
01:31:35,326 --> 01:31:36,930
Find a fearless man..

1227
01:31:36,995 --> 01:31:38,804
..who can silence Raja quietly.

1228
01:31:55,914 --> 01:31:58,292
Come on. Come on down.

1229
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,995
When are yöu bringing
sister-in-law home?

1230
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:02,826
I'm going to my in-laws next week.

1231
01:32:02,987 --> 01:32:04,796
I'll see how she's feeling.

1232
01:32:04,956 --> 01:32:07,232
In two months, I'll be
transferred from ltawa.

1233
01:32:07,492 --> 01:32:08,994
I'll be going to London on deputation.

1234
01:32:09,027 --> 01:32:11,974
Give me some good news before I go, Darshan Singh. 
- Yes.

1235
01:32:12,063 --> 01:32:13,565
How much further do we have to go?

1236
01:32:19,437 --> 01:32:20,575
Hail Bhawani!

1237
01:32:22,974 --> 01:32:24,112
Hail Bhawani!

1238
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:27,083
Now yöu know the hardships
we have to face.

1239
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:29,381
yöu had to face a little of it too.

1240
01:32:30,515 --> 01:32:34,224
Did yöu feel it? 
- Yes, I did.

1241
01:32:35,353 --> 01:32:37,299
What are yöur conditions
for surrendering?

1242
01:32:37,689 --> 01:32:39,965
Firstly, yöu disrespect me..

1243
01:32:40,191 --> 01:32:42,330
..and on top of that are
trying to boss me around?

1244
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,135
I hope yöu know yöu're
in Chambal territory.

1245
01:32:44,228 --> 01:32:46,208
Police officers go missing here often.

1246
01:32:46,597 --> 01:32:48,599
yöu're upset.

1247
01:32:49,467 --> 01:32:51,174
So, what are yöur conditions?

1248
01:32:51,536 --> 01:32:55,643
First, my entire gang will
stay in the jail together.

1249
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,241
OK?

1250
01:32:57,275 --> 01:33:00,085
And second, our children back home..

1251
01:33:00,611 --> 01:33:02,522
...should get free education.

1252
01:33:03,081 --> 01:33:04,059
Anything else?

1253
01:33:04,082 --> 01:33:06,494
And one day before we surrender..

1254
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:10,555
..Bipasha Basu will perform
here for us. Right?

1255
01:33:10,621 --> 01:33:12,658
That will be fantastic, chief. 
- Bipasha Basu?

1256
01:33:12,824 --> 01:33:14,462
We're making a big sacrifice.

1257
01:33:14,492 --> 01:33:15,835
Can't we have some fun?

1258
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:19,632
Sir, the government will accept
all yöur conditions.

1259
01:33:19,897 --> 01:33:23,037
But if Bipasha doesn't agree,
we cannot force her.

1260
01:33:23,401 --> 01:33:25,813
Try. Don't try to be a spoil-span.

1261
01:33:27,338 --> 01:33:28,476
We'll try, sir.

1262
01:33:28,573 --> 01:33:30,314
Call us back after two days.

1263
01:33:31,075 --> 01:33:32,418
Let's go, Darshan. 
- Hey.

1264
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,511
He can't leave.

1265
01:33:33,845 --> 01:33:36,291
He'll stay here. And, Bipasha's
going to dance here.

1266
01:33:39,117 --> 01:33:40,528
If that doesn't happen..

1267
01:33:40,651 --> 01:33:45,191
Then a week later yöu can
prepare for his funeral.

1268
01:33:45,623 --> 01:33:48,297
No, no, sir... I cannot stay here.

1269
01:33:48,559 --> 01:33:50,163
Blindfold him.

1270
01:33:50,628 --> 01:33:51,902
Where are yöu going, sir?

1271
01:33:52,263 --> 01:33:54,209
I'll be back. 
- Sir, please don't leave me.

1272
01:33:54,298 --> 01:33:55,641
Sir, please don't leave me here. 
- Hey. Stop.

1273
01:33:55,733 --> 01:33:56,677
Sir.. 
- Stop.

1274
01:33:56,701 --> 01:33:57,475
Stay with us.

1275
01:33:57,568 --> 01:33:59,275
Sir, I cannot stay here.

1276
01:33:59,303 --> 01:34:01,943
My wife's in labor. I cannot stay here.

1277
01:34:02,073 --> 01:34:03,313
yöu aren't delivering the child.

1278
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:06,285
Don't worry. We won't
kill yöu before a week.

1279
01:34:09,414 --> 01:34:10,859
Can I take a leak?

1280
01:35:54,619 --> 01:35:56,997
yöu can consider one
of them as Bipasha..

1281
01:35:57,088 --> 01:35:59,090
..and have some fun in jail. Let's go.

1282
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,297
Come on, enough singing.

1283
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:03,632
yöu're an insult to renegades.

1284
01:36:03,828 --> 01:36:05,330
The real renegades used to
be back in the old days.

1285
01:36:05,363 --> 01:36:08,139
Madho Singh. Malkhan Singh. 
- Paan Singh.

1286
01:36:14,205 --> 01:36:15,707
I've a question for Arun Singh sir.

1287
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,979
Single-handed.. 
- Come, Darshan.

1288
01:36:18,242 --> 01:36:19,243
Come on.

1289
01:36:21,846 --> 01:36:22,847
So, Mr. Arun.

1290
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:25,085
yöu single-handedly and in one day..

1291
01:36:25,216 --> 01:36:26,923
..how did yöu eliminate
such a dangerous gang?

1292
01:36:27,185 --> 01:36:29,859
Because I fight with emotions,
not strength.

1293
01:36:30,054 --> 01:36:31,431
Take America for instance.

1294
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:32,899
They're so strong.

1295
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:34,526
But did they ever win?

1296
01:36:35,026 --> 01:36:37,472
Because, on the other side is emotions.

1297
01:36:38,896 --> 01:36:41,308
That's fine, Arun Singh sir, but.

1298
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,441
Please handle them. 
- Okay, okay.

1299
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:47,641
Were yöu present there? 
- Yes, I was present there myself.

1300
01:36:47,672 --> 01:36:51,449
Yes, sir. 
- We need yöu in Lucknow.

1301
01:36:52,143 --> 01:36:53,417
It's important.

1302
01:36:53,544 --> 01:36:54,784
I'll be there tomorrow.

1303
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:56,348
Not just for a day or two.

1304
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,153
We'll have to get yöu transferred here.

1305
01:36:58,216 --> 01:36:59,820
I've already passed the orders.

1306
01:36:59,951 --> 01:37:02,488
If yöu've already passed the orders
then I'll be there soon.

1307
01:37:02,587 --> 01:37:04,032
Good news, sir.

1308
01:37:04,155 --> 01:37:06,431
In two months, I'm going
to London on deputation.

1309
01:37:06,524 --> 01:37:08,094
Sir, just two minutes. 
- I'm sure..

1310
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,570
..yöu will finish this job before that.

1311
01:37:09,694 --> 01:37:11,230
Sir, we're losing time.
We need to file a report.

1312
01:37:11,329 --> 01:37:12,637
Just give me a minute, sir.

1313
01:37:14,498 --> 01:37:16,239
Sir, what's yöur message for the yöuth?

1314
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,744
Look, yöu're awakening my emotions now.

1315
01:37:18,836 --> 01:37:21,248
If I slap yöu, yöu'll be the front
news for the rest of yöur life.

1316
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:22,749
Do yöu want a message for the yöuth?

1317
01:37:22,873 --> 01:37:24,011
Do yöu want a message for the yöuth?

1318
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:25,349
Sorry. 
- Get lost.

1319
01:37:26,177 --> 01:37:27,622
A demon warrior is afoot here..

1320
01:37:27,745 --> 01:37:30,385
..that only a brave warrior
like yöu can kill.

1321
01:37:30,548 --> 01:37:31,549
Who?

1322
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,454
Raja Mishra.

1323
01:37:33,985 --> 01:37:35,794
Then, I better pay my family a visit?

1324
01:37:35,953 --> 01:37:38,092
Family? 
- Yes. Allahabad.

1325
01:37:38,623 --> 01:37:39,567
Why?

1326
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,399
yöu see, when it becomes necessary
to commit a sin..

1327
01:37:41,425 --> 01:37:43,371
Then one should ask
for forgiveness first.

1328
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:51,845
He's really smart.

1329
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:52,904
He's got yöur mom on his side.

1330
01:37:53,037 --> 01:37:54,311
He's really sly. 
- Enough, dad.

1331
01:37:54,438 --> 01:37:56,611
Don't utter any more
nonsense about Raja?

1332
01:37:56,907 --> 01:37:59,114
Boys look better if they're bad boys.

1333
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:01,121
It's better for this era.

1334
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:02,650
Take a look at yöurself.

1335
01:38:02,747 --> 01:38:05,421
So, I'm unfit for this world
because I am an honest man!

1336
01:38:05,549 --> 01:38:06,721
I can't understand what yöu're saying.

1337
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:07,752
Nonsense.

1338
01:38:07,852 --> 01:38:10,458
I guess yöu couldn't figure me out yet.

1339
01:38:11,822 --> 01:38:14,496
Whether I am good or bad.

1340
01:38:14,959 --> 01:38:17,633
My Mitali's fate would
not be that unfortunate.

1341
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,100
I don't know.

1342
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:21,303
yöu borrowed money from us.

1343
01:38:21,332 --> 01:38:23,505
And promised to return it in 15 days. 
- Slowly.

1344
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:25,339
Slowly, brother. 
- But it's been more than 20 days.

1345
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:27,349
..and I haven't received
a single penny.

1346
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:30,815
Don't just stand here.
Arrange for the money.

1347
01:38:30,908 --> 01:38:32,819
If we don't get the money today.

1348
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,322
...we'll take yöur wife's jewellery.

1349
01:38:35,379 --> 01:38:36,449
He?..

1350
01:38:37,982 --> 01:38:38,983
Listen.

1351
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:42,857
Here.

1352
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:45,222
Pay him.

1353
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:48,759
Pay him.

1354
01:38:57,735 --> 01:38:58,941
Why do yöu interfere?

1355
01:38:59,036 --> 01:39:00,982
yöu can see I was talking to him?

1356
01:39:01,072 --> 01:39:02,483
The daughter's back home.

1357
01:39:02,573 --> 01:39:04,575
He must be her guest.

1358
01:39:05,009 --> 01:39:06,181
What did yöu say?

1359
01:39:06,977 --> 01:39:08,115
What did yöu just say?

1360
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:10,015
What did yöu just say
about my daughter?

1361
01:39:10,114 --> 01:39:12,492
I said yöur daughter's
really beautiful.

1362
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,354
She's back home.

1363
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,563
Now, yöu don't need to
borrow any more money.

1364
01:39:17,621 --> 01:39:18,565
Hey...

1365
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:38,076
Go on, who threw the first punch.

1366
01:39:38,476 --> 01:39:39,819
He did, sir. Sir, he did.

1367
01:39:39,944 --> 01:39:41,514
Hey...boy!

1368
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:43,421
How are yöu two related?

1369
01:39:43,781 --> 01:39:46,318
What did yöu say? 
- yöu aren't Bengali?

1370
01:39:46,417 --> 01:39:48,419
No. I am not a Bengali.

1371
01:39:48,786 --> 01:39:51,494
But, yöu police are all the
same in the entire country.

1372
01:39:52,156 --> 01:39:53,396
Ask him to step out with me.

1373
01:39:53,591 --> 01:39:56,265
Sir. He's trying to bribe yöu. Bribe.

1374
01:39:56,327 --> 01:39:57,806
Bribe won't work. Bribe won't work.

1375
01:39:57,828 --> 01:39:59,171
Sir. Please listen to me.

1376
01:39:59,363 --> 01:40:03,812
This is Bengal. No corruption.

1377
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:06,413
India is a country of migrants.

1378
01:40:06,537 --> 01:40:10,314
The Opposition that
rant about Hinduism.

1379
01:40:10,508 --> 01:40:12,647
Greetings. 
- Where are yöu?

1380
01:40:12,877 --> 01:40:15,790
Ask someone to call Bada Bazaar
police station, Kolkata.

1381
01:40:15,913 --> 01:40:18,154
Kolkata? 
- They arrested me for no reason.

1382
01:40:18,582 --> 01:40:20,960
When are yöu coming back? 
- Soon.

1383
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,258
Still.. 
- When I come back, the temperature will rise.

1384
01:40:24,588 --> 01:40:25,965
Everyone will get to know.

1385
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:33,965
Hello, sir.

1386
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,808
Okay, sir. Okay.

1387
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:41,850
Let's go. 
- I see.

1388
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:43,609
Hold on.

1389
01:40:43,774 --> 01:40:45,253
Hold on.

1390
01:40:48,179 --> 01:40:50,921
Why didn't yöu tell me who yöu work for earlier? 
- It's okay.

1391
01:40:50,948 --> 01:40:53,690
How about a cold drink? 
- No.

1392
01:40:53,751 --> 01:40:56,027
Fine. How about some tea or coffee? 
- No, thank yöu.

1393
01:40:56,153 --> 01:40:57,757
yöu will have to drink some
mineral water, I insist.

1394
01:40:57,788 --> 01:40:58,789
No, it's okay.

1395
01:40:59,457 --> 01:41:00,458
Pachori.

1396
01:41:03,294 --> 01:41:04,398
Call Balwan.

1397
01:41:07,531 --> 01:41:11,502
Yadav. Raja is in Kolkata, but
he can return at any time.

1398
01:41:11,735 --> 01:41:12,736
Very good.

1399
01:41:14,305 --> 01:41:15,807
Inspector General sir. 
- Yes, sir.

1400
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:19,180
Be alert. Raja can come back any time. 
- Yes.

1401
01:41:19,276 --> 01:41:21,381
Glory to.. 
- Sumer Yadav!

1402
01:41:21,712 --> 01:41:23,123
Sumer Yadav! 
- Stop!

1403
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:24,386
Stop.

1404
01:41:24,615 --> 01:41:26,219
Glory to.. 
- Greetings to all of yöu.

1405
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:28,962
Before yöu start asking questions.

1406
01:41:28,986 --> 01:41:32,763
...I would like to say,
I'm surrendering myself.

1407
01:41:32,857 --> 01:41:35,235
Because, my life's in danger.

1408
01:41:35,493 --> 01:41:37,097
There are witnesses against yöu..

1409
01:41:37,127 --> 01:41:38,697
..in the CMO murder case.

1410
01:41:38,963 --> 01:41:40,340
yöu shouldn't say such things.

1411
01:41:40,397 --> 01:41:42,673
..about great personalities, son.
He's here to create history.

1412
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,577
He's surrendering himself,
didn't yöu hear?

1413
01:41:44,602 --> 01:41:45,672
Bring him here.

1414
01:41:45,903 --> 01:41:47,041
The court's right here.

1415
01:41:47,104 --> 01:41:48,139
Bring him in front of me.. 
- Raja!

1416
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:49,718
Who's stopping yöu?

1417
01:41:49,974 --> 01:41:51,544
That's the voice I heard that day.

1418
01:41:51,809 --> 01:41:54,085
Raja! This is the man that
was with Bajaj that day.

1419
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:55,722
I am not crazy.

1420
01:41:56,113 --> 01:41:58,354
I am a religious man, I read religious texts. 
- Sumer Yadav!

1421
01:41:58,983 --> 01:42:00,257
He must have fired the
shot that killed Rudra.

1422
01:42:01,785 --> 01:42:03,389
Bajaj just gave the orders.

1423
01:42:09,827 --> 01:42:11,306
'I am going back, Mitali.'

1424
01:42:11,562 --> 01:42:13,200
'This happiness is futile, because..'

1425
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:14,809
'..the murderer of my friend is..'

1426
01:42:14,932 --> 01:42:17,173
'..is still hiding somewhere
and smiling.'

1427
01:42:17,301 --> 01:42:20,805
'But I promise...l will meet
Sumer Yadav just once.'

1428
01:42:20,938 --> 01:42:22,975
'And we'll meet again soon.'

1429
01:42:23,107 --> 01:42:24,518
'Wait for me.'

1430
01:42:30,447 --> 01:42:31,858
Yes, is everything okay?

1431
01:42:32,116 --> 01:42:33,151
I'm in Lucknow.

1432
01:42:34,985 --> 01:42:36,555
Where are yöu going to stay?

1433
01:42:41,559 --> 01:42:43,334
Hello. 
- Hello.

1434
01:42:47,565 --> 01:42:49,977
Shall we go home? 
- Not home. It's dangerous.

1435
01:42:50,434 --> 01:42:52,345
As long as we don't kill Sumer Yadav.

1436
01:42:52,503 --> 01:42:54,505
I don't want to get entangled
in any petty trouble.

1437
01:43:02,813 --> 01:43:04,190
It's not strong.

1438
01:43:04,415 --> 01:43:06,190
It will blow-up in a single shot.

1439
01:43:09,954 --> 01:43:10,955
Hello.

1440
01:43:12,022 --> 01:43:13,092
Hello, brother.

1441
01:43:17,628 --> 01:43:18,902
This is yöur home.

1442
01:43:18,963 --> 01:43:20,169
yöu can stay here as long as yöu like.

1443
01:43:20,197 --> 01:43:22,438
Downstairs is my family and
up here, is yöur abode.

1444
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:24,278
yöu won't face any problem.

1445
01:43:24,902 --> 01:43:26,973
Do yöu visit the temple?
- Every Tuesday.

1446
01:43:27,938 --> 01:43:30,316
As long as I'm here,
every day's a Tuesday.

1447
01:43:31,308 --> 01:43:33,083
From home to temple, and back.

1448
01:43:33,277 --> 01:43:35,018
No other work will happen.. 
- Yes.

1449
01:43:35,312 --> 01:43:39,624
Listen. I don't want to get caught
for anything foolish yöu do.

1450
01:43:39,717 --> 01:43:40,957
Understand? 
- Yes.

1451
01:43:41,218 --> 01:43:42,720
I'm planning an operation.

1452
01:43:43,087 --> 01:43:44,691
And I will leave as soon as it's done.

1453
01:43:45,689 --> 01:43:47,134
I'll never forget this favor.

1454
01:43:47,257 --> 01:43:53,401
If the yöuth of Uttar Pradesh
protest against Raja's death..

1455
01:43:54,498 --> 01:43:56,637
Then it will be yöur
job to contain them.

1456
01:43:57,334 --> 01:43:59,610
In return, I'll nominate.

1457
01:43:59,703 --> 01:44:02,206
..six of my weakest politicians
to stand against yöu.

1458
01:44:02,306 --> 01:44:06,482
After Raja's death, the people of
Uttar Pradesh won't listen to me.

1459
01:44:06,577 --> 01:44:08,579
Listen to me..

1460
01:44:09,413 --> 01:44:15,056
Politics and prostitution
are really old professions.

1461
01:44:16,086 --> 01:44:20,796
And both include maintaining
peace, carefully.

1462
01:44:22,126 --> 01:44:27,474
The shooter yöu're calling
to kill Raja..

1463
01:44:27,798 --> 01:44:29,573
...will also have to sacrifice
his life later.

1464
01:44:31,268 --> 01:44:33,942
ls that Raja's file or erotic
stories that yöu're reading?

1465
01:44:34,638 --> 01:44:36,640
Raja and Rudra's stories
should be published, sir.

1466
01:44:37,808 --> 01:44:39,378
They have such a colourful past.

1467
01:44:40,978 --> 01:44:42,321
But, one thing is clear.

1468
01:44:42,546 --> 01:44:44,321
They couldn't have done
all this without.

1469
01:44:44,348 --> 01:44:45,793
...the support of someone powerful.

1470
01:44:48,118 --> 01:44:50,189
Who's supponing Raja?

1471
01:44:51,321 --> 01:44:52,629
Rambabu Shukla.

1472
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,296
He's a senior Minister.

1473
01:44:55,092 --> 01:44:59,006
Sir, if yöu want Raja to
be arrested or finished..

1474
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:02,233
..then understand that from now
on I am the senior most here.

1475
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,038
I don't care what yöu've decided..

1476
01:45:07,171 --> 01:45:09,378
But I'll release the election funds..

1477
01:45:09,707 --> 01:45:11,380
...only after Raja's dead.

1478
01:45:11,542 --> 01:45:13,180
Raja's not the only one who will die..

1479
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:14,517
..many others will lose their lives.

1480
01:45:14,845 --> 01:45:15,983
I don't care.

1481
01:45:16,013 --> 01:45:18,584
One of them will be yöur men. 
- Who?

1482
01:45:19,216 --> 01:45:20,217
Sumer Yadav.

1483
01:45:21,151 --> 01:45:22,562
He's in yöur jail.

1484
01:45:23,454 --> 01:45:26,560
Raja will come out of hiding
when he's out in the open.

1485
01:45:28,092 --> 01:45:29,435
yöu couldn't control yöurself either.

1486
01:45:29,493 --> 01:45:30,904
yöu're here to see the match too.

1487
01:45:31,061 --> 01:45:32,904
I am not here to see the match.
I am not interested.

1488
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:36,671
I am here to warn yöu.
- Why? What's wrong?

1489
01:45:37,134 --> 01:45:39,478
Raja is in Lucknow.

1490
01:45:40,537 --> 01:45:41,572
What?

1491
01:45:42,673 --> 01:45:44,675
I heard that yöu're the
only thing on his mind.

1492
01:45:45,743 --> 01:45:47,347
So, what can he do?

1493
01:45:47,811 --> 01:45:49,017
I am in jail.

1494
01:45:49,379 --> 01:45:51,120
He's been in this jail for a long time.

1495
01:45:54,184 --> 01:45:57,631
We don't know who's working for him.

1496
01:46:06,029 --> 01:46:08,031
Catch him. Catch him. 
- Catch him.

1497
01:46:08,165 --> 01:46:09,473
Hold his leg. Catch him.

1498
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,705
Come. Come. Come.

1499
01:46:11,902 --> 01:46:14,007
Come. Come. Come.

1500
01:46:14,104 --> 01:46:16,710
Come. Come. Come.

1501
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,650
Come. Come. Come.

1502
01:46:19,843 --> 01:46:21,652
Come. Come. Come.

1503
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:23,588
Come. Come. Come.

1504
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,853
Come. Come. Come.

1505
01:46:28,519 --> 01:46:31,090
What the... Who was it?

1506
01:46:31,288 --> 01:46:33,859
Who was it? Who was it?

1507
01:46:34,892 --> 01:46:36,462
Who tried to kill me?

1508
01:46:38,128 --> 01:46:39,163
Who was it?

1509
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:41,471
Greetings. 
- Bless yöu.

1510
01:46:41,665 --> 01:46:44,612
There's toothpaste. Oil. And
four packets of biscuit.

1511
01:46:44,701 --> 01:46:46,078
That's what yöur family sent for yöu.

1512
01:46:46,203 --> 01:46:47,204
Stop.

1513
01:46:48,205 --> 01:46:49,411
Stop. Stop.

1514
01:46:49,506 --> 01:46:50,507
Get lost.

1515
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:54,650
Who sent yöu in jail? 
- What are yöu doing, Sumer?

1516
01:46:55,012 --> 01:46:56,423
He's under trial. 
- Who sent yöu?

1517
01:46:56,547 --> 01:46:58,527
He's been sent to jail today.
How can he be yöur enemy?

1518
01:46:58,615 --> 01:47:00,424
He was staring at me.

1519
01:47:00,517 --> 01:47:02,929
yöu're the superstar of this jail.

1520
01:47:03,086 --> 01:47:04,497
He must be a fan following yöu around.

1521
01:47:04,555 --> 01:47:07,297
Right, I am being followed
around a lot.

1522
01:47:07,424 --> 01:47:09,927
I won't spare anyone.

1523
01:47:10,928 --> 01:47:12,066
Get back to work.

1524
01:47:12,162 --> 01:47:13,766
People are questioning yöur courage.

1525
01:47:13,964 --> 01:47:15,910
They think yöu're scared.

1526
01:47:16,667 --> 01:47:18,476
Sir... 
- Media.

1527
01:47:19,169 --> 01:47:22,480
People vote only for those
who are media-friendly.

1528
01:47:23,774 --> 01:47:24,980
Go out of the jail.

1529
01:47:25,542 --> 01:47:27,681
Once yöu do, Raja will come after yöu.

1530
01:47:28,579 --> 01:47:30,718
yöu can finish him off
with Munna's help.

1531
01:47:30,747 --> 01:47:32,249
ls this why yöu called me here?

1532
01:47:32,349 --> 01:47:35,057
yöu cannot kill Raja alone.

1533
01:47:35,519 --> 01:47:37,795
For that, yöu need a intelligent.

1534
01:47:37,855 --> 01:47:39,994
..and strong ally like Sumer Yadav.

1535
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:41,191
Get that.

1536
01:47:43,193 --> 01:47:45,104
I've arranged for yöur bail.

1537
01:47:47,865 --> 01:47:49,208
Sumer Yadav.

1538
01:47:49,266 --> 01:47:51,769
Brother Sumer, greetings. 
- Bless yöu.

1539
01:47:51,902 --> 01:47:52,972
Sumer Yadav.

1540
01:47:53,103 --> 01:47:55,105
Isn't yöur life in danger now?

1541
01:47:55,239 --> 01:47:56,843
I am fearless now.

1542
01:47:57,074 --> 01:48:00,248
Now, I'm connected with
the Lord. Glory to..

1543
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:01,983
Hold on, sir. 
- Get that.

1544
01:48:02,145 --> 01:48:04,125
Sir, have yöu been given
bail or acquitted.

1545
01:48:04,181 --> 01:48:05,717
..of such grave crimes.

1546
01:48:05,949 --> 01:48:07,019
yöu will have to tell us.

1547
01:48:07,117 --> 01:48:08,994
yöu will have to tell the media, sir.

1548
01:48:09,353 --> 01:48:12,493
yöu just saw Sumer Yadav
has been granted bail..

1549
01:48:12,589 --> 01:48:13,863
..and he has left.

1550
01:48:14,391 --> 01:48:15,392
Let's go.

1551
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:34,855
How are yöu? 
- Even/thing's fine.

1552
01:48:34,945 --> 01:48:36,754
All okay. 
- Greetings, chief.

1553
01:48:52,963 --> 01:48:56,604
Welcome everyone to the
cycle competition.

1554
01:48:56,667 --> 01:48:59,238
This year Suresh from
our neighborhood..

1555
01:49:00,070 --> 01:49:02,175
Make a 'Paan' for me.

1556
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:05,051
What are yöu making? 
- Here.

1557
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:06,209
yöu imbecile.

1558
01:49:10,881 --> 01:49:14,055
Make it very spicy.

1559
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:16,394
Beautiful.

1560
01:49:16,853 --> 01:49:18,696
Its too sharp.

1561
01:49:18,956 --> 01:49:20,367
Want one?

1562
01:49:21,058 --> 01:49:23,004
Have it.

1563
01:49:26,296 --> 01:49:27,775
Sumer's really smart.

1564
01:49:27,831 --> 01:49:29,970
He finishes a job and
hides in the temple.

1565
01:49:30,867 --> 01:49:32,813
I've been following him for three days.

1566
01:49:33,103 --> 01:49:34,776
He goes at least twice.

1567
01:49:34,838 --> 01:49:36,408
Sometimes by day, sometimes at night.

1568
01:49:37,341 --> 01:49:39,548
Night's best, brother. 
- No.

1569
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:44,217
We'll kill him during day.

1570
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:46,124
It's very crowded during the day.

1571
01:49:46,183 --> 01:49:47,662
I will let everyone know..

1572
01:49:48,352 --> 01:49:49,922
..that I avenged Rudra's death.

1573
01:49:51,321 --> 01:49:52,959
So what if it's crowded.

1574
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,271
That's where I'm going to kill him.

1575
01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:03,174
It's the tradition of Raghu clan.

1576
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:04,904
Lay down yöur life, but
never break a vow.

1577
01:50:05,002 --> 01:50:06,310
See..

1578
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:18,887
I'll slap yöu.

1579
01:50:45,442 --> 01:50:47,718
Praise the Lord.

1580
01:50:47,844 --> 01:50:49,824
Praise the Lord.

1581
01:50:49,913 --> 01:50:52,189
Praise the Lord.

1582
01:50:52,282 --> 01:50:55,661
Praise the Lord.

1583
01:50:55,786 --> 01:50:58,323
Greetings!...  
- Greetings!...

1584
01:51:41,431 --> 01:51:43,775
Stop. Stop.

1585
01:51:47,804 --> 01:51:49,442
I'll slap yöu.

1586
01:52:09,092 --> 01:52:10,093
Move.

1587
01:52:51,234 --> 01:52:53,714
I had to kill Rudra.

1588
01:52:54,337 --> 01:52:57,409
yöu know this happens
in our profession..

1589
01:52:57,974 --> 01:53:00,716
Just forgive me.

1590
01:53:01,144 --> 01:53:03,715
I swear, I will never
forget this favor.

1591
01:53:04,381 --> 01:53:06,622
I want to kill yöu every
day, Sumer Yadav.

1592
01:53:07,617 --> 01:53:09,221
Three times a day.

1593
01:53:11,655 --> 01:53:13,225
Arrange for something like that.

1594
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:15,428
And I'll be indebted to yöu forever.

1595
01:53:38,215 --> 01:53:39,717
Are yöu completely dead?

1596
01:53:45,822 --> 01:53:47,631
Who are yöu?

1597
01:53:48,692 --> 01:53:50,399
yöu're way too excited on this matter.

1598
01:53:50,994 --> 01:53:52,940
How much did Sumer Yadav pay yöu?

1599
01:53:53,096 --> 01:53:55,303
I'm still on the government pay list.

1600
01:53:55,498 --> 01:53:57,705
The name's Arun Singh Munna.

1601
01:54:00,036 --> 01:54:02,516
Chambars watch guard.
- So, yöu recognized me.

1602
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,984
Look. I did what I had to.

1603
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,712
yöu can shoot me now if yöu like.

1604
01:54:09,813 --> 01:54:12,350
I won't kill yöu. yöu're
a fantastic guy.

1605
01:54:12,382 --> 01:54:17,195
Look. Either yöu let
me go, or fight me.

1606
01:55:06,603 --> 01:55:07,547
Look, there he is.

1607
01:55:45,008 --> 01:55:47,614
Rambabuji, except for the Prime
Minister and President.

1608
01:55:47,877 --> 01:55:50,448
Ministers like us, are not
too secure as we grow old.

1609
01:55:50,547 --> 01:55:52,117
Neither the family nor
the Party supports us.

1610
01:55:52,248 --> 01:55:53,659
The only thing that
supports us is money!

1611
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:55,320
Now all the industrialists
will run away.

1612
01:55:55,418 --> 01:55:57,420
Raja Mishra is.. 
- What can I do?!

1613
01:55:57,587 --> 01:55:58,588
Sir..

1614
01:56:01,324 --> 01:56:02,325
l...

1615
01:56:06,129 --> 01:56:07,904
Yöur aim was bad.
- Sir, I tried.

1616
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,304
That's why he escaped.

1617
01:56:09,566 --> 01:56:11,512
He has become even more popular
after killing Sumer Yadav.

1618
01:56:11,634 --> 01:56:15,480
Just once, tell me.. 
- I don't know where Raja is.

1619
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:18,083
Rambabuji, please.

1620
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:19,551
Just find out once...where Raja is.

1621
01:56:19,676 --> 01:56:21,246
Did yöu call them?

1622
01:56:21,344 --> 01:56:22,345
No, sir. I didn't. 
- Stop.

1623
01:56:22,445 --> 01:56:24,049
Excuse me. 
- yöu fool.

1624
01:56:24,748 --> 01:56:25,920
They are from the press.

1625
01:56:25,982 --> 01:56:26,983
Let them through.

1626
01:56:30,053 --> 01:56:31,726
How are yöu? 
- It's yöur grace.

1627
01:56:33,022 --> 01:56:35,263
It's okay, son. 
- Hello, brother.

1628
01:56:35,358 --> 01:56:37,463
Raja wants to talk to yöu.

1629
01:56:39,662 --> 01:56:40,663
Here.

1630
01:56:43,333 --> 01:56:44,903
Hello. 
- Greetings sir.

1631
01:56:45,969 --> 01:56:48,313
Where are yöu? 
- Do yöu want to know that.

1632
01:56:48,338 --> 01:56:50,477
..or tell the world about it? 
- Meaning?

1633
01:56:50,573 --> 01:56:54,385
I mean, only yöu knew that
I was back in the city.

1634
01:56:55,178 --> 01:56:57,556
So how did Sumer Yadav
get police protection?

1635
01:56:58,348 --> 01:57:01,386
And from that was Chambal
watch guard, Arun Singh.

1636
01:57:01,985 --> 01:57:03,521
Anyway, I took my revenge.

1637
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,895
And the police couldn't
do anything about it.

1638
01:57:05,989 --> 01:57:08,128
I just called to tell
yöu that I am leaving.

1639
01:57:08,558 --> 01:57:10,196
To start a new life.

1640
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:13,873
New address...new name, new profession.

1641
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:16,608
And if I find out, that
yöu were responsible.

1642
01:57:16,666 --> 01:57:19,146
..for sending that police
officer after me..

1643
01:57:19,302 --> 01:57:20,872
Then I'll come back in this form.

1644
01:57:21,604 --> 01:57:23,049
And spread havoc!

1645
01:57:24,574 --> 01:57:26,576
And I won't spare yöu either.

1646
01:57:38,388 --> 01:57:40,800
I never saw yöu in Raja's gang before.

1647
01:57:40,957 --> 01:57:43,096
He met me a little later.

1648
01:57:43,293 --> 01:57:45,569
By the way, these days
he trusts me the most.

1649
01:57:49,432 --> 01:57:50,809
yöu're being loyal to someone..

1650
01:57:50,834 --> 01:57:52,370
..who doesn't have too long to live.

1651
01:57:52,502 --> 01:57:53,503
Meaning?

1652
01:57:54,370 --> 01:58:00,377
I mean...this is the reward
for being loyal..

1653
01:58:03,646 --> 01:58:05,717
..to the Lord's devotion and politics.

1654
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:10,620
Come here. 
- Yes.

1655
01:58:26,936 --> 01:58:29,007
Are yöu coming? 
- Yes.

1656
01:58:29,239 --> 01:58:30,240
Look after yöurself.

1657
01:58:30,273 --> 01:58:31,718
Here's yöur passport

1658
01:58:34,043 --> 01:58:35,716
Ok?

1659
01:58:37,514 --> 01:58:39,221
Please see if it is right or wrong

1660
01:58:40,116 --> 01:58:42,255
I don't always know what's
right or wrong.

1661
01:58:42,452 --> 01:58:44,454
But whatever's happening now is right.

1662
01:58:49,058 --> 01:58:50,867
All of yöu head back to yöur villages.

1663
01:58:53,496 --> 01:58:55,305
Thank yöu for yöur support brother.

1664
01:58:56,566 --> 01:58:58,944
And yöu, Mr. Artist.

1665
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:01,879
yöu won my heart. 
- Don't embarrass me.

1666
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:07,048
yöur gun? 
- I don't need it anymore.

1667
01:59:23,026 --> 01:59:25,302
Why is he coming this way?

1668
01:59:48,985 --> 01:59:51,795
No one can narrate yöur story
better than me, Raja.

1669
02:00:12,408 --> 02:00:14,547
Come on, get out of here.

1670
02:00:40,036 --> 02:00:41,447
The investigation is going on..

1671
02:00:41,471 --> 02:00:43,348
..and the police have been
posted here since morning.

1672
02:00:43,373 --> 02:00:46,650
These images are of a Lucknow highway..

1673
02:00:46,876 --> 02:00:49,823
...where gangster Raja
Mishra is believed.

1674
02:00:49,879 --> 02:00:51,256
..to have died in a car bomb.

1675
02:00:51,514 --> 02:00:52,720
If Raja Mishra's death...

1676
02:00:52,815 --> 02:00:54,317
Where are yöu? At the airport?

1677
02:00:54,384 --> 02:00:55,761
Yes, sir. I'm heading to Delhi.

1678
02:00:55,885 --> 02:00:58,491
Call me when yöu come back from Delhi.

1679
02:00:58,621 --> 02:01:00,191
I'll receive yöu personally.

1680
02:01:00,289 --> 02:01:01,324
What's the occasion, sir?

1681
02:01:01,391 --> 02:01:03,200
The government has allotted
yöu a piece of land.

1682
02:01:03,226 --> 02:01:05,001
Sir, yöu're too kind..

1683
02:01:05,094 --> 02:01:07,802
I'll take yöu to see the land myself.

1684
02:01:08,331 --> 02:01:09,639
Okay, sir, definitely.

1685
02:01:11,834 --> 02:01:12,710
Yes, sir.

1686
02:01:12,735 --> 02:01:15,682
In two days time, I will take
Munna to show him the land.

1687
02:01:16,005 --> 02:01:17,484
He's a smart officer.

1688
02:01:17,607 --> 02:01:18,915
We'll need to be careful.

1689
02:01:19,042 --> 02:01:20,919
Make arrangements for yöurself.

1690
02:01:38,628 --> 02:01:39,504
Thank yöu.

1691
02:01:39,529 --> 02:01:40,940
Good afternoon, Ma'am.

1692
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:01,660
'Mr. Artist. yöu won my heart.'

1693
02:02:01,751 --> 02:02:03,731
'yöu're embarrassing me.'

1694
02:02:05,321 --> 02:02:07,824
'yöur gun'? 
- I don't need it anymore. '

1695
02:02:25,708 --> 02:02:27,915
'So...Rambabu took yöu
under his wing too.'

1696
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,284
'And what did he ask in return?'

1697
02:02:29,378 --> 02:02:35,260
'Mr. Artist, Raja can forgive most
mistakes, but not betrayal.'

1698
02:02:36,219 --> 02:02:39,564
'This is the reward for being loyaL.

1699
02:02:41,023 --> 02:02:43,230
...to devotion and politics.'

1700
02:02:49,899 --> 02:02:51,936
'From today, yöu're responsible.'

1701
02:02:52,034 --> 02:02:55,106
'..for the security of this country.'

1702
02:02:56,906 --> 02:02:59,443
'When yöu leave for the airport.'

1703
02:02:59,675 --> 02:03:02,554
'..Arun Singh will kill
yöu on the way.'

1704
02:03:06,215 --> 02:03:09,594
'And then...l will kill Arun Singh.'

1705
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:12,731
'That's the plan.'

1706
02:03:16,726 --> 02:03:18,672
My yöunger brother, Param.
- Hello, sister-in-law.

1707
02:03:25,468 --> 02:03:29,780
The gun that he keeps waving around..

1708
02:03:30,006 --> 02:03:32,282
'The government yöu're
risking yöur life for..'

1709
02:03:33,242 --> 02:03:35,916
'..is humiliating yöur integrity.'

1710
02:03:38,147 --> 02:03:40,627
'yöu will kill me, and the
public will get enraged.'

1711
02:03:41,818 --> 02:03:44,298
'And to calm them down, yöur
life will be sacrificed.'

1712
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:56,676
'My job was to finish Raja.'

1713
02:03:57,633 --> 02:03:59,408
'And Raja will be finished.'

1714
02:04:07,043 --> 02:04:08,989
'It's not safe for yöu here.'

1715
02:04:10,012 --> 02:04:11,582
'Come with us to Malaysia.'

1716
02:04:11,881 --> 02:04:13,690
'Brother, yöu spared me.'

1717
02:04:19,088 --> 02:04:21,830
'Brother, I will never forget yöu..'

1718
02:04:22,592 --> 02:04:24,902
'It's not me, the Lord's doing it all.'

1719
02:04:37,006 --> 02:04:38,986
'Why is he coming this way?'

1720
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:47,211
This air travel is always the
most challenging for me!

1721
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:48,989
Why are yöu holding my hand?

1722
02:05:51,347 --> 02:05:52,348
Sir, please be seated.

1723
02:05:52,548 --> 02:05:55,552
Don't move, sir. Please. 
- I'm scared, need a window seat.

1724
02:06:01,958 --> 02:06:03,801
Now yöu make my fears go away.

1725
02:06:20,543 --> 02:06:21,544
What the...
