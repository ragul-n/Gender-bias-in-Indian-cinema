Everyone stay indoors.

Oh, haven't you arranged
the money yet?

246
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,119
Shall I sign?

247
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,720
No... no...

248
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,119

(INDISTINCT VOICES)

252
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,640
Hey, dude...

253
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,080
Sir.

254
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,281
- Come here.

255
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,039
Help the Grandma get ready
before the camera arrives.

256
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,360
Okay, sir.

257
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,639
Check whether she speaks right.

258
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,800
- Go.
- Sure, chief.

259
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,359
Grandma, you remember everything,
isn't it?

260
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,639
You must speak as instructed.

261
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,600
You're lucky enough
to speak on Television.

262
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
Tell me once.

263
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,239
I'm residing here,
right from my birth.

264
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,920
The Second one.

265
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,159
Suddenly, they say that new houses
are built for us...

266
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,199
in Gavundanpalayam and ask
to move and settle there.

267
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,479
How to leave my country of birth?

268
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,879
Say this with some emotion.

269
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,520
How to leave my country of birth?

270
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,559
I won't leave my country,
and go anywhere.

271
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,879
I'll stay only here.

272
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,599
- I swear on Tamil Nadu.
- Superb.

273
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,159
I won't go to Gavundanpalayam.

274
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,240
Hi, grandma.

275
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,241
Hi, grandma.

276
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,319
Gavundanpalayam is also
in our state.

277
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,519
It's not an another country.

278
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,559
Sir, will you instruct her
to say anything...

279
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,360
if she is an illiterate?

280
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,999
Hello, I told her as state.

281
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,279
She wrongly says as country.

282
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,759
Yes, if you see an young girl...

283
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,919
what the wrinkled skin said
will become wrong.

284
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,959
You accompany her and enjoy.

285
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,800
Grandma, she said simply.

286
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,319
Grandma, what you said is right.
What bothers me?

287
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,720
Come on.

288
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Grandma...

289
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:18,799
Leave it.

290
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,640
She is doing too much.

291
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,239
You teased her and she left.

292
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,639
What answer will I give him?

293
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
I'll call you.

294
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,239
I'll call you, Kuttima.

295
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,639
Hey, - sir.

296
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,680
What are you doing there?

297
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,039
What are you doing there?

298
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,079
Is the grandma ready?

299
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,040
Grandma!

300
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Sir, she is good than grandma.

301
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,520
Sir, she is good than grandma.

302
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,960
What?

303
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,439
She speaks good.

304
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,479
Is it?

305
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,520
Ask her to tell once.

306
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:41,839
Ask her to tell once.

307
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
Just a minute, sir.

308
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,680
Please, come here.

309
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm calling you.

310
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
Somehow, I must make her accept.

311
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,119
All this while, you were here.

312
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,679
Will you please tell something
about this issue?

313
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,240
Me?

314
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:02,919
Yes, you're the beauty next
to grandma.

315
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,999
Not that, I didn't apply
any makeup for face.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,639
How can I speak before
the camera bare faced?

317
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,039
Your lips and cheeks
provokes me to kiss.

318
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,000
Why do you need makeup?

319
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,119
That's okay...
Don't think too much.

320
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,439
Why am I going to compel you,
if the grandma was here?

321
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,959
He is very much tensed.

322
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,119
Tell something.

323
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,919
Okay, I'll tell.

324
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Sir...

325
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,599
That child is affected
by cerebral vascular disease.

326
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,560
Her nervous system is weakening.

327
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,399
Pity, she is dumb too.

328
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,159
If the surgery is not done now,
her chances of survival becomes difficult.

329
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,559
The bill for the basic tests
is not paid yet.

330
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,599
Her father didn't come yet.

331
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Let's see.

332
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,679
Don't leave the children outside.

333
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,879
The robbers are carrying
deadly weapons.

334
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,440
Everyone be safe.

335
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
Don't go out.

336
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:46,641
Let's go inside the house.

337
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,439
Don't roam out unnecessarily.

338
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,759
Get inside the house.

339
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,359
Go.

340
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Hey, go...

341
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,679
Hey, go...

342
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,280
Here is the voice recorder.
Speak now.

343
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,759
Hello, I am Bhuvana. Speak now.

344
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,159
I'm residing in this slum board
for the past 17 years.

345
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,919
Totally 214 houses are there.

346
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:04,960
At least four people reside
in each house.

347
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,879
At least four people reside
in each house.

348
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,519
Now, we've a problem.

349
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,279
But, we won't get any
solution for that.

350
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,839
Everyone knows that.

351
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,759
The Government which isn't bothered
about the seven crore people of Tamil Nadu,

352
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,119
Will it bother about these 756 people?

353
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,040
What are they doing still,
without coming inside?

354
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,959
What are they doing still,
without coming inside?

355
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,199
I'll tell, sir.

356
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,479
Check immediately.

357
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,400
Thank you very much.

358
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:31,399
Tell me, Kuttima.
Okay, I'll leave, brother.

359
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,120
You mean, brother?

360
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,959
Why did you suddenly
call me as brother?

361
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm of your age.

362
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm of your age.

363
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Then, you haven't said
anything about you.

364
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,599
My age is 23.

365
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,679
My name is Bhuvana.

366
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,559

What's this?

371
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
I just made fun.

372
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,280
Okay.

373
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,318
I did my graduation and I've completed
the teacher's training course.

374
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,719
I did my graduation and I've completed
the teacher's training course.

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,200
Now planning to do
an own business.

376
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Kuttima!

377
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
Hey...

378
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,760
It's going to be
a great day for us!

379
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,720
Hey, come on.

380
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Sir, take care.

381
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Chief...

382
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Good morning, sir.

383
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:31,119
Mr. Thothadiri, where are you now?

384
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,880
That is...

385
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,839
Variety hall.

386
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Gandhi kuppam, sir.

387
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,399
An interview with the slum people.

388
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay.

389
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,759
But, some problem here, sir.

390
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,559
Gun shoot is going on.

391
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,839
Don't know how to come out
of this place.

392
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh...?

393
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,160
You do one thing.

394
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,519
No, you aren't right for that.

395
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:47,558
Who is there with you?

396
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,520
Who is there with you?

397
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,119
Sir, the cameraman Sandy
has arrived.

398
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,399
But, he is yet to come inside.

399
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,039
An assistant is here, sir.

400
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,639
Who, the new recruit?

401
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,600
- Give him the phone.
- To him?

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,319
The chief wants to speak with you.

403
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,000
Add "sir" before and after.
Okay, sir.

404
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,999
Yes, Mr. Balasubramanyam.

405
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,600
Listen Ashwin.

406
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:06,359
A bank robbery has happened
in Gandhipuram.

407
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,960
Okay sir.

408
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,919
We got an information that the robbers
are hiding in the place where you're.

409
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,399
Our camera team
can't come inside.

410
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,999
So arrange someone in the locale
and do the live coverage.

411
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,680
Okay?

412
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,839
Guys, be safe.

413
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
It's a big problem.

414
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,360
Okay?

415
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,080
Sure Chief.

416
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,680
- We'll do.
- Take care.

417
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,200
Thank you.

418
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,359
Sir, we have to arrange someone
in the locale and do the live coverage.

419
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,839
- Live coverage?
- Yes, sir.

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,120
Amidst this cross firing?
Yes, sir.

421
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,399
Jeeva, repeat the WhatsApp videos
shared by the public.

422
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,799
We got the information that 12 people
have died in this robbery.

423
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,759
But, the Police claim only
as four victims.

424
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,680
Anyway, today's exclusive news
must be about the robbery.

425
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,559
Nobody must attend the calls
from the government...

426
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,879
without my permission.
Okay, sir.

427
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,240
Not even a single call.
Okay, sir.

428
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,239
- Ibrahim.
- Sir.

429
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,599
You've done a shootout
in the public place.

430
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,959
Don't you know that you should seek
permission from me, the ADGP?

431
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,199
That was an unexpected accident, sir.

432
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,119
The robbers were heavily armed.

433
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,759
Three of our men died.

434
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,319
Five civilians died.

435
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,999
Thirteen people are critical.

436
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,039
I can't wait to
seek your permission.

437
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,919
You got transferred between two states
because of your foolishness.

438
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,599
Stop this operation.

439
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,839
The DGP will come.

440
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,959
Enquiry will take place.

441
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,319
Please be ready to face it.

442
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,039
Sir, I got permission from the DGP.

443
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,960
What?

444
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,719
Have you got permission
from the DGP?

445
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,839
I'm trying to contact him
from morning.

446
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,239
He is in the PM review meeting.

447
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,439
It'll still take three hours
for the meeting to end.

448
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,279
How did you get permission?

449
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,240
- Doctor.
- Sir.

450
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,280
I've severe pain.

451
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,359
I've severe pain.

452
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,400
Oh, God! I told you earlier
not to strain.

453
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,199
Oh, God! I told you earlier
not to strain.

454
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,160
Did you listen?

455
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,039
I don't care,
if you're a Police.

456
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,479
My patient is more
important for me.

457
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,120
Come on, sir.

458
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,399
Ibrahim be ready
to face the consequences.

459
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,679
You'll be transferred to Gujarat.

460
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
Take rest properly, sir.

461
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,279
Mic 14 calling...

462
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,439
Get inside.

463
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Listen me.

464
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,079
Sir, PC Kumaran,
SC Murugesh got injured.

465
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,720
I'm following them.

466
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,280
Where did they go?

467
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,320
Blood?

468
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Where?

469
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
Yes.

470
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,760
Selva uncle has hit me.

471
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,279
It's not painful.

472
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
It's just for fun.

473
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,720
Why are you afraid?

474
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,959
Is it about the injection?

475
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,039
Okay.

476
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,439
I told the doctor uncle
not to inject.

477
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,439
They won't inject you.

478
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,480
I've told them. Okay?

479
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:26,960
I've told them. Okay?

480
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,080
You must show the doctor the back
side of your head, where you got hurt.

481
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,439
They won't inject you.

482
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,639
Ashok, have you got the money?

483
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,719
The money is ready.

484
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,759
It'll come soon.

485
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,519
Will you come before the surgery?

486
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,999
I'll come immediately.

487
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,359
Take care of the child.

488
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Thank you very much.

489
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,839
Smitu, dad is coming there swiftly.

490
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Okay?

491
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,079
Dad will come soon.

492
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,999
I'll be with you only.

493
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay?

494
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,520
I spoke.

495
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:25,680
Okay?

496
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,559
I'll come soon.

497
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Promise.

498

Come on...

499
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Come...

500
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,960
(INDISTINCT VOICES)

501
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,279
The atrocities of the Police
is unbearable.

502
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,679
They aren't allowing the public
to commute in either way.

503
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,239
Everyone is highly tensed
as their works are spoiled.

504
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,919
Children can't go to schools
and others to jobs.

505
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,719
So, the public is enraged
on the Police.

506
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,639
The situation is going worse.

507
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,639
For Puthiya Thalaimurai news,
Manasvini with Cameraman Velu.

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,839
- Tell me.
- Sir.

510
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,760
Kuberan, sir.

511
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,759
It was said that there
was a problem with a bike.

512
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,799
What's the model and the colour?

513
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,959
Sir, it's Suzuki, black colour.

514
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,439
- What's the number?
- 4811.

515
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,200
- Is it TN 30?
- Yes, sir.

516
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,120
That's the one, sir.

517
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,880
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you?

518
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:31,918
Sir, we got a message that the
house is in this localty.

519
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,959
Sir, we got a message that the
house is in this localty.

520
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,719
But, it doesn't seem to be here.

521
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,319
- Here...
- it's not my bike.

522
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,839
Sir, it's him... It's him...

523
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,039
He is the one who created ruckus
parking the bike on the road.

524
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Hit him, sir.

525
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,840
Go, clear the bike.

526
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Clear the bike.

527
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,239
Stopping the vehicle in the
middle of the road and if asked to clear...

528
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,280
they speak against the Police.

529
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,839
They speak against the Police.

530
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,199
Rascals.

531
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,520
Nowadays, no one is respecting
the Policeman.

532
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,479
Is this a hotel?

533
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,518
It's my house, sir.

534
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,519
It's my house, sir.

535
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,520
They're the tenants.
I've rented it out.

536
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,278
These people supply
the rotis to this entire locality.

537
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,239
These people supply
the rotis to this entire locality.

538
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,399
Roti? Okay.

539
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,479
Have some juice, sir.

540
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,720
- No, it's okay.
- Take it, sir.

541
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,199
Just now, on the way,
I ate chicken biryani.

542
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,120
It's yet to get digested.

543
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,199
You know about
the robbery, isn't it?

544
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,800
Be careful.

545
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,399
Inform the Police,
if you see the robber.

546
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,040
You too.

547
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,800
First, I must go to the ATM
and withdraw the balance Rs.300.

548
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
Kuberan, - yes, sir.

549
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,239
Sir, should I come to
the police station?

550
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,279
Where are you now exactly?

551
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,320
I'm in the spot, sir.

552
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:39,479

Brother, the dog has left.

732
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,600
A policeman was standing here,
Check what he is doing?

733
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,760
Goof.

734
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:34,080
He is doing what the Tamil Nadu Police
will do while on duty.

735
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,839
Dad is near to the hospital.

736
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,079
I'll come soon.

737
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,120
Okay?

738
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,959
Definitely I'll buy,
when I come to see you.

739
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Okay?

740
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,360
You saw?

741
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
How?

742
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:54,600
I didn't buy yet.

743
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:56,000
I didn't buy yet.

744
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Is it visible?

745
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Where?

746
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Is it?

747
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,079
Oh, no! You found it.

748
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,280
Superb!

749
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
Definitely, I'll get you.

750
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Okay?

751
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,280
It's good.

752
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,879
You made it very softly.

753
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,639
If you give me enough curry,

754
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,159
Everyday, I'll buy five packets
for my family.

755
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,960
But, I'll eat everything on my own.

756
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,679
Mic 2, Kuberan calling, sir.

757
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,440
Are you in the spot?

758
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:48,640
Yeah, I'm in the spot, sir.

759
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,959
Sir, the people we're
searching for, are here.

760
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
What?

761
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,960
They're before me.

762
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,960
I'm watching them from
the terrace of a house.

763
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,959
They're next to this house.

764
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,840
They're seen clearly.

765
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,640
Tell the house address.

766
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:05,960
What's this house address?

767
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
The robbers may escape.
Call the house owner soon.

768
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,280
What's the address
of this house?

769
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:11,040
The address is...

770
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm asking only you.

771
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,719
Sir, I forgot it as the old
and new door numbers kept changing.

772
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,319
Don't you know
your own house address?

773
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,360
How many people are there?

774
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:20,959
How many people are there?

775
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,839
Sir, seven people are here
including me.

776
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,239
Sir, we can catch,
if you come this side.

777
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,480
Sir, one of the robbers is running.

778
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,416
Without a single penny being paid,
nothing will happen here.

779
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,960
You have to come.

780
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:31,999
We can catch them,
if you come soon.

781
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,120
Sir, hurry up.

782
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,680
Hey, sit down.
You may die by gun shot.

783
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Mic 2 calling Kuberan, sir.

784
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,719
The DC family felt bad
for not taking them to shopping.

785
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,199
I'm free on the spot now.

786
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,719
I'll come to the Police station
if you say now.

787
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,240
Dhanraj has gone.

788
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,040
You stay on the spot
and see what to be done.

789
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,960
See here.

790
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,760
He can't escape in any other way.

791
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Hey...

792
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Hey...

793
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Catch him.

794
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Who's that?

795
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,560
Go straight.

796
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Hey, come.

797
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,880
Commandos!

798
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,439
Sir, it seems to be a big issue
as commandos are going.

799
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,000
How to find out?

800
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,160
Give me your phone.

801
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:37,399
- My phone?
- Give me, sir.

802
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,478
- My phone?
- Give me, sir.

803
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:38,160
For what?

804
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,240
For what?

805
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:41,399
Switch on the camera and shoot
what the commandos are doing.

806
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:41,478
Switch on the camera and shoot
what the commandos are doing.

807
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:41,880
Why?

808
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,559
You want me to be killed
and earn fame for yourself.

809
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,280
Why, sir?

810
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,959
Shall I go and see?

811
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,640
You!

812
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,239
Why? It's my locale.

813
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,120
Why should I fear?

814
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,640
Right, sir.

815
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:51,576
When the locale girl is with us,
why should we be afraid?

816
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,960
Will you speak Tamil well?

817
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,800
Goof.

818
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:55,880
You speak superb!

819
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,240
Sir, hold this phone.

820
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:57,320
Sir, hold this phone.

821
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,560
She needs a changeover.

822
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,720
Hey, what are you doing?

823
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey, wait.

824
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,360
Here it is. Tie in hand.

825
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,920
What are you doing
with my tress?

826
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240
Take it.

827
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,440
Still something is missing.

828
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Hey.

829
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,720
Sir, just wait.

830
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,680
Something is missing.

831
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,120
Why is that spectacles now?

832
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:32,440
Sir, just wait.

833
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,680
It's perfect.

834
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,160
But, something is still missing.

835
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,040
Sir, give me your ID card.

836
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,360
It's the final touch.

837
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,120
Now she looks like a
perfect anchor.

838
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,080
You mean, anchor?

839
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,000
Our channel anchors
won't be allowed to come in.

840
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,480
Now, she is the anchor.

841
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Give the phone now.

842
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,680
Switch on the camera,
go along this street...

843
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,199
and present a LIVE commentary
on what the commandos are doing.

844
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,800
Okay?

845
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,640
To whom?

846
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,440
What you speak in this phone
will be telecasted in the TV.

847
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,239
You'll be watched in 154 countries.

848
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,919
He may start a channel it seems.
Okay?

849
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,120
He talks about the statistics.

850
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,440
Tell me something now.

851
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,480
Hey, open the door.

852
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,800
How to go upstairs?

853
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,880
I can't understand
what you speak.

854
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,640
Hey, who is that?

855
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,480
Somone is on the terrace
with the gun!

856
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,599
This place has been rounded up
by the commandos.

857
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,159
Not one or two commandos.

858
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,879
Totally 43 people.

859
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,559
Commondos have occupied the terrace
of all the houses.

860
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,999
They've big rifles.

861
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Sir, shall I connect the LIVE telecast?

862
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,960
Connect immediately.

863
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
Okay, sir.

864
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,399
If their aim is perfect,

865
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,439
They can shoot a person,
even at a distance of two kilometres.

866
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,719
As this commondos
have such sniper rifles,

867
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,480
It seems the bank robbers
will definitely be killed.

868
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,759
Hey, come here.

869
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,520
Where are you coming from?

870
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Where is your house?

871
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,200
My house is in Krishnan temple street.

872
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,280
I came to my aunt's house.

873
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:11,880
I came to my aunt's house.

874
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,096
A cop there told me that
the robbers have intruded in this place.

875
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,200
So, I got permission from him
and going home.

876
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,680
Go...

877
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:19,760
Hey, wait.

878
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,240
Hey, wait.

879
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,280
What's that?

880
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,280
Take it.

881
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:24,598
Take it.

882
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,599
Take it.

883
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,080
- Give me.
- That's nothing.

884
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:29,840
Sir.

885
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Give me.

886
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
Give me.

887
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,960
What's this?

888
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,599
It seems like an electronic item.

889
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,240
Who are you?

890
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,440
What's this?

891
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:40,919
I'm an engineering student, sir.

892
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,200
It's a device used for
a high powered wind mill project.

893
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,840
Mic 4 on line.

894
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,320
Come immediately to the gate no.3.

895
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:50,640
Is it to the entry point, sir?

896
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:51,841
Is it to the entry point, sir?

897
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,799
For the past few hours, the police
have surrounded this place.

898
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,480
The entry to this entire area is blocked.

899
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,039
Because of this, the public is suffering.

900
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,079
The office goers and the school kids
are standing out as they are denied entry.

901
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,240
The Policemen are here for security.

902
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,480
The people belonging to this locale is
neither allowed to come in nor to go out.

903
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,640
How this footage went on-air?

904
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:23,559
Sir, four media people have
sneaked in and took this footage.

905
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,920
Don't know how they took this?

906
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,040
Have we come to the department
to sleep?

907
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,719
Ask a sniper to shoot
a media person.

908
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,879
Yes, sir.
If asked, tell as collateral damage.

909
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Okay, sir.

910
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
Hello, Commissioner here.

911
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,800
Order.

912
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,240
Parrot visible!

913
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,640
Sniper 1, ready.

914
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,320
- We'll complaint.
- Yes.

915
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,520
The copy is clear now.

916
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Okay.

917
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,520
Sniper 4.

918
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Receiving.

919
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,480
6 to 7.

920
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
6 to 7.

921
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,600
Sniper 4.

922
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,560
Video check.

923
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,720
Video check.

924
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Take the shot.

925
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,639
Target negative!

926
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Oh...

927
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,159
Target negative!

928
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,520
Code word, I received.

929
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
Code word.

930
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,480
Hey, one of the robbers is here.

931
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,400
What is he doing here?

932
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,720
He is hurt badly.

933
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,120
Hey, yes.

934
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,280
Go and catch him.

935
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:38,679
Your channel will get
a breaking news.

936
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,480
Who? We?

937
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,960
Yes, it's you. Go...

938
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Hello,

939
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,720
Ashok, where are you?

940
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,399
I'm taking right from
the Suryan street.

941
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,960
You guys?

942
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:48,559
Hey, don't go that way.
That's a dead end.

943
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,560
We'll escape.

944
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,560
He might stab with a knife.
Come on, sir.

945
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,440
Hey, you've killed him.

946
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,480
Come, let's go down and see.

947
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Sir...

948
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Sir...

949
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,360
He died.

950
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,160
Is he dead?

951
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:45,880
Dead body.

952
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:45,918
Spot dead.

953
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,640
Spot dead.

954
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,440
It's a breaking news.

955
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:47,760
Here it is.

956
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,080
Shoot the corpse
along with the accused.

957
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,319
You mean, accused?

958
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,319
Yes, if you do a murder,
then you're an accused, right?

959
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,200
Wonder, the corpse is moving!

960
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,360
Thank god! He is alive.

961
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,599
Sir, he is alive.

962
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,119
Damn, the breaking news is missed.

963
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,600
He too...

964
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:07,439
Hello, it's you who robbed the bank.
Isn't it?

965
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,679
Where have you kept the money?

966
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,119
Why did you do the robbery,
and how?

967
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,600
Tell me.

968
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,040
What happened to your accomplices?

969
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,080
Who are you all?

970
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,519
We're reporters, from MDTV.

971
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
Tell me, we'll record your
dying statement.

972
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,360
With that money, which country have you
preferred to go and enjoy with the beauties?

973
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,400
My friend Ashok's child
has to undergo a surgery.

974
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,679
We robbed the money
for that surgery.

975
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,960
Okay, where are your accomplices?

976
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,920
I don't know where they went.

977
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,519
Who is having the money?

978
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,119
That money is with Ashok.

979
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,320
In which hospital is the
child admitted now?

980
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,599
In Jyoti hospital.

981
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,280
Help for the child's surgery.

982
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,199
The money should reach
that hospital.

983
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,400
Only then, the time for the surgery
will be fixed.

984
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,480
Okay, cool.

985
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,959
The Police is coming. Go away.

986
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,479
Save the child.

987
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,280
- Go fast.
- Let's escape.

988
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,280
Come on.

989
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,880
Hey, get up.

990
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,479
Ask to monitor the media persons
who are roaming inside.

991
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:01,760
Okay, sir.

992
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,480
I must know their move.

993
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:03,799
It's an information
regarding Ashok's child.

994
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,520
What?

995
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,800
Who is attending the patient?

996
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,399
A Woman and a girl.

997
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,959
Do you know the doctor
who is attending the case?

998
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,440
Yes, sir.

999
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Dr Ananth Raj.

1000
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,400
Sir, he is the incharge of this floor.

1001
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,560
This child, sir.

1002
00:57:24,561 --> 00:57:25,640
Who are these people?

1003
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,359
Sir, she is my daughter,
Tamilselvi.

1004
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,640
She is my neighborhood girl, Smitu.

1005
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,599
My daughter wish to help others.

1006
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,359
I thought of naming her
as "Mother Teresa".

1007
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,480
Hey, shut up.

1008
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,080
Where did her father go?

1009
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,919
He has gone to arrange money
for the surgery.

1010
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,320
Did he tell you, like that?

1011
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,399
When called in the morning,
he said he'll come by ten minutes.

1012
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,720
Now, he didn't attend the call.

1013
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,319
Aren't they aware of the incident?

1014
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,479
I thought they might know, sir.

1015
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,040
Do you know what he did?

1016
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,279
I don't know, sir.

1017
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,319
He killed many people in the bank
and robbed the money.

1018
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Do you know this?

1019
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Murder?

1020
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,199
What's this?

1021
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,479
Sir, we aren't related
to this in any sort.

1022
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,799
We'll leave.

1023
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,279
Don't bother about her.

1024
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,318
Come we will leave.
Hey, shut your mouth.

1025
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,639
Come we will leave.
Hey, shut your mouth.

1026
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,840
Mom, shut up.

1027
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,039
Sir, I know well about him.

1028
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,519
He is not that kind of a person.

1029
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,280
Some mistake has happened, sir.

1030
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:14,640
Are you his wife?

1031
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:15,760
Are you his wife?

1032
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,440
No, sir.

1033
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
His love lady?

1034
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,480
No, sir.

1035
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,400
He is my neighbor, that's all.

1036
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:21,519
Why are you supporting him staunchly?

1037
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,879
Sir, we'll give in writing
that we aren't related to this.

1038
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,799
Come, we'll leave her here and go.

1039
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,160
Mom, be quiet.

1040
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
What's your name?

1041
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:32,960
What's this?

1042
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,360
Can't she speak?

1043
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,160
She is dumb.

1044
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,599
Why didn't you say this to me?

1045
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,240
Only now, we too know, sir.

1046
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,760
Hey, come here.

1047
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,800
Convince that girl that
I am her dad's friend.

1048
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,640
She shouldn't be dubious about me.

1049
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,879
Go and convey what I said.

1050
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,176
She shouldn't be dubious about me.

1051
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,560
- Sir, me...
- Go.

1052
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,920
Hey,

1053
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,120
Did her father call?

1054
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,520
How is he speaking?

1055
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:21,919
By sign language?
Yeah, by sign language.

1056
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,040
Then, listen to me.

1057
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,320
Call him now.

1058
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,720
Ask her to speak.

1059
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,760
He shouldn't know
that I am here.

1060
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Give the phone.

1061
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,760
"Playing on the banyan tree."

1062
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,480
"Clap your hands, the squirrel."

1063
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,399
"Cuckoo... the cuckoo sings."

1064
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,839
"The adoring parrot,
nod your head."

1065
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,400
"Playing on the banyan tree."

1066
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,799
"Clap your hands, the squirrel."

1067
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,639
"Playing on the banyan tree."

1068
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,599
"Clap your hands, the squirrel."

1069
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,799
"Cuckoo... the cuckoo sings."

1070
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,680
"The adoring parrot,
nod your head."

1071
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
What happened?

1072
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,600
I forgot the next line.

1073
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,999
Yeah, I got it.

1074
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,160
"The jackal, sing a lullaby."

1075
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,320
Smitu! Smitu.

1076
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,199
Smitu! Smitu!

1077
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,679
- Smitu!
- Smitu, what happened?

1078
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,239
Smitu! Smitu!

1079
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,680
Smitu, get up.

1080
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,840
Smitu wants to talk to you.

1081
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,280
Uncle?

1082
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,520
Who!

1083
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,760
Ashok, I'm Commissioner
Ibrahim speaking.

1084
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,320
You're aware that
your daughter is critical.

1085
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,640
She's is going to be
taken to the surgery room.

1086
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,080
Come soon to see her,
for one last time.

1087
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:45,920
We're all waiting.

1088
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:47,000
We're all waiting.

1089
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,520
See you soon.

1090
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Take it. Come on.

1091
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,520
Sir, tell me.

1092
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,480
Did one of the robbers surrendered?

1093
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,080
Okay, sir.

1094
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,600
Come on.

1095
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,400
What about the
other robber, sir?

1096
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,160
He is under target.

1097
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,080
Have you targeted him?
Behind your spot.

1098
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,040
Is it behind my spot?

1099
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:18,800
I'm going there.

1100
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,439
Look he'll be killed in few minutes,
watch in flash news.

1101
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,920
It'll get featured in flash news.

1102
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,479
Sir, he's coming by Manaka street.

1103
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,039
Sir, that street is connected
to this area.

1104
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,960
It seems, he is coming
at a distance, sir.

1105
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,640
Mic 9 calling.
Dasa gowda street.

1106
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,599
Among the remaining two robbers,
one was shot dead by the Police.

1107
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,480
Robbers are being
searched intensly.

1108
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,240
Ashok, stop.

1109
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,960
The Police is on that side.
Come here.

1110
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,040
What are you thinking about?

1111
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,640
Police is there. Oh, no!

1112
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,160
Sir, waiting for your command.

1113
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,640
Parrot visible.

1114
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,520
Hey, look here.

1115
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,960
Is he going to surrender?

1116
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,720
Target surrender.

1117
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
Take shot.

1118
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
What?

1119
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:54,758
Repeat the order.

1120
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:55,759
Repeat the order.

1121
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,920
Repeat the order.

1122
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,120
I said take the shot.

1123
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,520
Oh, no!

1124
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,440
Hey, we'll go down.

1125
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,679
Where does that street
get connected to?

1126
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,959
No, we have to go a long distance
if we go down.

1127
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,960
Come upstairs.

1128
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,720
Vidhya sister, Open the door.

1129
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Vidhya sister,

1130
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,120
Who are you?

1131
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:17,960
I'm Bhuvana.

1132
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:19,120
Is it you, Bhuvana?

1133
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,639
What's this?

1134
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:20,680
I'll tell you later.

1135
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:21,799
I'll tell you later.

1136
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
First, open the door, sister.

1137
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
Go... go...

1138
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Sir, come on.

1139
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,160
Hey, come here.

1140
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,720
This is a dead end.

1141
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:37,960
Anyhow, he must come here.

1142
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,280
Anyhow, he must come here.

1143
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,160
He can't go beyond this.

1144
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,879
Hey, look there.
He is coming from that lane.

1145
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,040
He has come.

1146
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,280
Zoom well.
Take the picture soon.

1147
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,440
Sir, he lost his life for
the sake of money.

1148
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,440
Sir, the other robber must definitely be
near to my spot.

1149
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,680
Yes, sir.

1150
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,240
Pan on the three sides,
and look for the police.

1151
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,919
Be on the same spot. Okay, sir.

1152
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,159
- Shouldn't miss.
- Okay, sir.

1153
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,239
Among the four robbers, Rajan and
Ashok were shot dead by the Police.

1154
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,759
The Police is searching the
other robber, Selva.

1155
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,599
The Indian Army Snipers,
The Tamil Nadu Action Force,

1156
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,640
and The Special Force is involved
in this operation.

1157
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,400
Object is visible.
Shall I shoot him?

1158
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
Everyone stay alert.

1159
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,360
Sir, the other robber came
and took away the money bag.

1160
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,679
Yes, it's not an ordinary thing
as we think.

1161
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,600
Something interesting.

1162
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:14,519
People are dying here
due to cross firing.

1163
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,960
He says something interesting.

1164
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,759
What are you whispering to her?
Nothing, sir.

1165
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,520
Zoom now.

1166
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
Okay, sir.

1167
01:07:19,521 --> 01:07:21,440
It's good if you dispose immediately.

1168
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Sir, ambulance.

1169
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Ambulance!

1170
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,040
Shoot it.

1171
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,479
Sir, the ambulance is simply there.

1172
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,880
Don't know what's happening there?

1173
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,079
Sir, he is not seen.

1174
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,760
I think, he is taken away
in the ambulance.

1175
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,800
Sir, just wait. Please, sir.

1176
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,039
That child is our hold.

1177
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,656
We can catch the other robber
only by using the child as a bait.

1178
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,680
Please, sir.

1179
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,160
Please, sir.
Give me fifteen minutes of time, sir.

1180
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,560
Just fifteen minutes.

1181
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,960
Yeah, Thank you.

1182
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:22,880
- Krishnamurthy, come here.
- Sir.

1183
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,399
- Krishnamurthy, come here.
- Sir.

1184
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,839
It seems the Councillor car
is waiting outside.

1185
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,879
Tell him we can't allow
any vehicle.

1186
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Okay, sir.

1187
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,680
Dude, take the vehicle.

1188
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,480
You can't go in.

1189
01:08:33,481 --> 01:08:35,159
Why, sir?
We've blocked all the streets.

1190
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,239
The robber is hiding inside.

1191
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,319
Take the vehicle in reverse
without any queries.

1192
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,919
It'll take long time, if I go around.
You can't go there, dude.

1193
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,880
The lives of the children
is important.

1194
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,680
Take the vehicle, first.

1195
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:41,799
Already it's late, sir.

1196
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,959
Won't you understand?

1197
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,640
No, sir.

1198
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:45,519
Will you reverse the vehicle or shall I?

1199
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,480
The parents are calling now itself.

1200
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:48,679
If the parents ask, tell them
that you aren't allowed inside.

1201
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,400
Hello.

1202
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:50,841
Take the vehicle.
Yeah, tell me sir.

1203
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:51,238
Hey, hang the call and
take the vehicle in reverse.

1204
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:52,919
Hey, hang the call and
take the vehicle in reverse.

1205
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,159
They aren't allowing inside.

1206
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,839
Kumaresan, get the vehicle key
and take him to the jeep.

1207
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,919
You got caught to me.

1208
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
What?

1209
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,399
Reply me without
turning your neck.

1210
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,000
- How much is this?
- One.

1211
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,080
This one?

1212
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
Two.

1213
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,200
This one?

1214
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,200
Three.

1215
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,400
You are partially blind.

1216
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:14,000
Get me hot rotis. Go.

1217
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,240
The Police is surrounding us.

1218
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,440
Banti is being inquired by the
Head Constable.

1219
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,599
How many houses have you
rented out?

1220
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,240
Two, sir.

1221
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,360
In which locality?

1222
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:24,600
Gandhipuram, sir.

1223
01:09:24,601 --> 01:09:25,879
Gandhipuram, sir.

1224
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,639
Are you getting the rent regularly?
Yes, sir.

1225
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:27,680
I found, why are you panicking.

1226
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:30,919
I found, why are you panicking.

1227
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,680
What's that, sir?

1228
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,279
You've dried up fritters
on the terrace.

1229
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,160
You're feared about the crows.

1230
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,479
The Commandos are on the terrace.

1231
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,080
We can't get the vehicle
to the mall.

1232
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,639
Welcome to the News 7 channel.
What's this sister?

1233
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,959
The other robber is also hiding
in the same street.

1234
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,639
They're going to shoot him.

1235
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,600
The Police will do as they say.

1236
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,039
Driver, don't go by RS Puram.

1237
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,320
In Mumbai's Malcolm area,
a powerful bomb was blasted.

1238
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,920
More than 200 innocent civilians
and 20 Policemen are dead.

1239
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,520
More than 400 people
are seriously injured.

1240
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,360
Hello,

1241
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,319
Sir, got a report that
a bomb threat is in the city.

1242
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,479
What? A bomb threat?

1243
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,960
No, that must be a fake call.

1244
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,080
Slam the phone down.

1245
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,199
The ADGP told to remove
the forces there.

1246
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,920
Hey, are you working for
the department or for the ADGP?

1247
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,640
Hang up the phone.

1248
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,280
- Damn.
- Idiot.

1249
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,239
- Mic 4 calling.
- Murthy,

1250
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,039
Sir, the other robber is hiding
in the car shed.

1251
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,479
Is it?
He doesn't have any way to escape.

1252
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,840
We've surrounded him, sir.

1253
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
Yash,

1254
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,560
Watch the TV to know
what's happening outside?

1255
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,760
The time is over.

1256
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:11,559
Kumaresan, where are you?
Sir, I'm in the same spot.

1257
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,440
The robber was seen crossing that spot.
Is it?

1258
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,039
I can't see anything, sir.

1259
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,080
We got an information
that he was seen again.

1260
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,720
- Be alert.
- Okay, sir.

1261
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,880
How can we go out?

1262
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,920
We aren't going out.

1263
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,320
Then, how?

1264
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,920
The bomb should blast here.

1265
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,520
They told to explode it here.

1266
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,760
Here?

1267
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,600
It's over in all the states.

1268
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,080
Anything might happen, anytime.

1269
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:36,920
Anything might happen, anytime.

1270
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,640
So, don't delay.

1271
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,200
It's the correct decision.

1272
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,640
No time to think.

1273
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,480
Do it.

1274
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,160
Can you do?

1275
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes, brother. I'll do.

1276
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,520
All the known people
will be affected, brother.

1277
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,560
Will it hurt only
the known people?

1278
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,280
Even the unknown people
will be hurt.

1279
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,080
The life is same for all.

1280
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,640
Don't worry.

1281
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,720
They'll die before feeling the pain.

1282
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,000
Not that, brother.

1283
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,039
Banti brother, we've done
so many things for you.

1284
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,559
Still, we'll do more.

1285
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,360
Start the work.

1286
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,600
Mic 4 calling.

1287
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:34,800
- Over.
- Sir.

1288
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,400
Murthy, what's the position
of the snipers in that place?

1289
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,639
Sir, six snipers are there.

1290
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,599
In the North building,
Officer Rakesh Chawan.

1291
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,920
I'm the middle, Raffiq.

1292
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,800
In the West, Mukesh Raj.

1293
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,240
Okay.

1294
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:48,416
Who is in the opposite building?

1295
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,400
The Officer Amit Chowdary
entering, sir.

1296
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,016
Are you sure he is
a competitive shooter?

1297
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,600
Yes, sir.

1298
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,480
Okay, stay on the line.

1299
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:56,600
Yes, sir. Proceed.

1300
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,000
Object visible. Object visible.

1301
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,160
Is he in target?

1302
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,000
Copy.

1303
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,160
Say again.

1304
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:07,278
Proceed.

1305
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:08,279
Proceed.

1306
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,240
Hey, everyone drop your rifles.

1307
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:20,800
At the entrance, sir.
Where are you, Guna?

1308
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Where are you?

1309
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,720
In the fourth entrance, sir.

1310
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,480
What are you doing?

1311
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:25,239
Sir, near the temple
in the fourth entrance.

1312
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:25,720
What are you doing there?

1313
01:13:25,721 --> 01:13:27,056
Sir, the public...
How many of you are there?

1314
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,040
Sir, 13 people.

1315
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,159
Are you feckless?

1316
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,440
Sir, a child came by the school van
has gone inside.

1317
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,896
Where is the child?
Have you missed?

1318
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,520
Yes, sir.

1319
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,719
If this operation doesn't work out,
no one must come to the office.

1320
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,360
I don't want anybody
to come to my office.

1321
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,160
- Uncle.
- Go...

1322
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,200
What happened?

1323
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,120
It's connected.

1324
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,960
We can match the code
and activate it.

1325
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,080
Okay, good.

1326
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,080
Mubarak, - Brother.

1327
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:06,359
We don't have more time.
Hurry up.

1328
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,280
Finish it fast.

1329
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,799
Sheik, do it soon.

1330
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,840
We're running out of time.

1331
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,080
Hey... Who shot me?

1332
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,880
This child's head will be shattered.

1333
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,680
If you raise the rifle again, the child's
head will be shattered into pieces.

1334
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,480
Wait... wait...

1335
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
Come out. Or else, I'll shoot.

1336
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,400
Even though it's a child,
I won't show mercy.

1337
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,720
Oh, no! She is Hasini.

1338
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,520
- Hasini?
- Hasini?

1339
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,799
My daughter!
Waiting for the order.

1340
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,000
Don't shoot. Hold on.

1341
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,880
She is my daughter.

1342
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,480
Go forward.

1343
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,639
Go forward.

1344
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,640
Don't cry.

1345
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,720
Go forward. Go forward.

1346
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,199
I'm tutoring her.

1347
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,440
Her parents talk well with me.

1348
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,919
No, sir.

1349
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,039
Don't do. Stop it.

1350
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,719
That robber has abducted my child.

1351
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,200
Your daughter?

1352
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:37,959
Yes, my child.
She went to the school.

1353
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,640
Don't know how she got
caught in his hands?

1354
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,200
Hey...

1355
01:15:46,201 --> 01:15:47,960
Are you running again?

1356
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'll hit you.

1357
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,200
They're going to drop the rifles.

1358
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,239
If not, I'll slit her throat.

1359
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,279
Sir, I can't convey your instructions
to anyone here.

1360
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,359
He told that it's conveyed.

1361
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,760
I didn't get any instructions, sir.

1362
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,800
- No?
- No, sir.

1363
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
You said that you've conveyed.

1364
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:05,679
Sir, some confusion between them.
What are you doing?

1365
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,680
Sir.

1366
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,599
I want this operation
to be done properly.

1367
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,079
Just follow my instructions.
Sir...

1368
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:11,800
Okay.

1369
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,519
Hey, come back.

1370
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,240
Come...

1371
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,240
- Uncle, leave me.
- Come.

1372
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,999
Hey Bhuvana, do you know
all the details about that child?

1373
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,119
I know well, sir. Just a minute.

1374
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,000
Take that recorder.

1375
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:23,480
If I leave you,
they'll shoot me.

1376
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,399
Hold it.

1377
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,519
Now tell all the details
about that child.

1378
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,119
When speaking, add some fear
and emotion.

1379
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,199
Only then, the viewers will
shed tears and the TRP will raise.

1380
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,200
Is it okay?

1381
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Damn it.

1382
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,200
Are you a human?

1383
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,640
Will you ask me to speak like this
if she is your child?

1384
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,800
People like you will do business
with human lives to telecast in TV.

1385
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,280
What's that doing business
with a child?

1386
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,680
I'll go and talk to him.

1387
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,960
Hey Bhuvana.

1388
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,400
Brother, I'll give back
all the money.

1389
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,440
Don't blast that car.

1390
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,559
Don't blast.

1391
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,719
I did a blunder.

1392
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,239
A big blunder.

1393
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,759
Tell him, brother.

1394
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,520
- Uncle...
- Hey.

1395
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:13,720
Okay.

1396
01:17:13,721 --> 01:17:15,456
I'll discuss with the Commissioner
and tell you.

1397
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,920
She is the child born
out of penance.

1398
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,520
After coming from the school,
she'll come to you calling as Uncle.

1399
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,759
How many times
she played with you.

1400
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,080
Have you forgot all those?

1401
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,680
Brother, please tell him.

1402
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,960
Uncle, leave me.

1403
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,640
Hey, If I leave you,
they'll shoot me.

1404
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,199
Don't shout. Shut your mouth.

1405
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,560
Hey Bhuvana, don't go.

1406
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:34,438
Stay quiet.

1407
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:34,840
Stay quiet.

1408
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:36,799
Shoot now, sir.

1409
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
She's my friend, sir.

1410
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,480
Sir, we might get caught.

1411
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,440
What's this, sir?

1412
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,320
Sir, the reporter girl
went close to the robber.

1413
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
Hey.

1414
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:48,598
Who are you?

1415
01:17:48,599 --> 01:17:49,120
Who are you?

1416
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,040
Did the Police send you?

1417
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,359
No, the Police didn't sent me.

1418
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,240
I'm the reporter.

1419
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,280
Reporter.

1420
01:17:53,281 --> 01:17:54,399
Why have you come here?

1421
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:54,440
Just listen to me for a minute.

1422
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,839
Just listen to me for a minute.

1423
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,079
I'm from the media.

1424
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,960
Go away from here.

1425
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,760
Else, I'll shoot you.

1426
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,920
We've spoken to your
another friend,

1427
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,239
He said, to save your
friend Ashok's daughter,

1428
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,399
You people are doing all these.

1429
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,719
It was us who had conveyed
all these to the public.

1430
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,720
Hey, keep quiet.

1431
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,840
If you want to say
anything in LIVE...

1432
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:09,319
Unnecessarily, you're diverting me.

1433
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:09,880
Go away.

1434
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,120
Who is that girl?

1435
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:13,040
Her name is Bhuvana.

1436
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,799
She is not working in the channel.

1437
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,480
She belongs to that locale.

1438
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,840
Find out her number
and ask to call me immediately.

1439
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,120
You fondly bought her a bicycle.

1440
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,080
Tell him.

1441
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:25,240
Tell him not to do.

1442
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,599
Tell him not to do.

1443
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,120
I'll give all my property.

1444
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,760
Hey, don't blast the car.

1445
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,440
Please!

1446
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,800
Ask Amit to target Selva
through the window.

1447
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,360
Okay?

1448
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,080
I'll convey, sir.

1449
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:34,600
Swamy, - sir.

1450
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:35,839
Come here. Mark what I say.

1451
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,280
She is everything for me.

1452
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,519
My daughter, brother.

1453
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,320
I can save you still.

1454
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:41,600
Hey, look here.

1455
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:42,760
Hey, look here.

1456
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,319
I've killed the Police
and the Public.

1457
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,760
You need not save me.

1458
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,440
Go or I'll shoot the child?

1459
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,719
Message received.

1460
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,799
Check whether is there any other
way to that car shed?

1461
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,800
Yes, sir.

1462
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,319
Brother, don't blast the car.

1463
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,039
I'll give you the entire money.

1464
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,280
How much ever you want,
I'll give you.

1465
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:58,480
Our daughter is our life,
brother.

1466
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:00,519
Our daughter is our life,
brother.

1467
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,440
She is my soul!

1468
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,720
Don't jump.

1469
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,120
I'll shoot you.

1470
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,840
No need to save me.

1471
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,640
If you don't go, I'll shoot you
and this child.

1472
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,079
Hey, go away from here.
Oh, no! Leave that child.

1473
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,719
If anything happens to that child,
you'll be killed.

1474
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:18,760
I'm not worried about my death.

1475
01:19:18,761 --> 01:19:20,040
I'm not worried about my death.

1476
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,719
I want that child to survive.

1477
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,199
Brother, you say that LIVE.

1478
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,239
Hey, don't come close.

1479
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,999
Brother, if you blast the car,
my daughter will shatter into pieces.

1480
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,360
Please, understand.

1481
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:29,520
Please brother, tell them,
not to do so.

1482
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:32,839
Please brother, tell them,
not to do so.

1483
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,400
I beg at your feet.

1484
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,239
Stop it.

1485
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:38,840
Stop it.

1486
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,560
Don't blast.

1487
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,120
Don't blast the car, please.

1488
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,800
It's a complicated situation, sir.
I can't wait, please.

1489
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,000
You take everything.

1490
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:45,599
You take everything.

1491
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,320
Give my daughter, brother.

1492
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,160
To save a child, don't play with
the life of an another child.

1493
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:52,320
Are we playing?

1494
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:53,640
Are we playing?

1495
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,999
The police is playing with
the life of our child.

1496
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,519
If I leave this child,
the Police will kill me.

1497
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:58,960
Be careful.

1498
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,321
Nothing should happen
to the child.

1499
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,599
Target him.

1500
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,919
All are watching you.

1501
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,360
Go...

1502
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:05,040
You must answer the Police.
Go away.

1503
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,599
Run. Run away.

1504
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,360
She saved that child, sir. Stop.

1505
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,480
Hasini, run.

1506
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,280
Sir, come fast. Come on.

1507
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,959
I can't wait anymore.

1508
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,720
Please take your shot. Yes, sir.

1509
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Object disappeared.
Object disappeared.

1510
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,318
Hey...

1511
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:27,319
Hey...

1512
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,880
Don't do anything to her.

1513
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Hasini.

1514
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,680
Come fast.

1515
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,760
Come here.

1516
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,880
Don't do anything.

1517
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,920
Brother said not to do.

1518
01:20:53,921 --> 01:20:55,440
Don't do anything. Wait.

1519
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:04,840
What happened?

1520
01:21:04,841 --> 01:21:05,879
Both the child and the robber
are not seen.

1521
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,640
Don't know what to do?
What are you saying?

1522
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Look there.

1523
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,520
They're shooting there.

1524
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:12,799
- Let's go and see there.
- No.

1525
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,039
More Police has been
deployed there.

1526
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,120
What to do then?

1527
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,280
I've an idea.

1528
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:16,920
What idea is that?
Come on, I'll tell you.

1529
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:17,920
Come on.

1530
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,479
Brother, come.

1531
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,879
You yourself ask him to stop.
Hey, stop.

1532
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,520
For my sake. For my daughter.

1533
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,799
Please, just be patient.

1534
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,559
Somehow, I'll bring my daughter.

1535
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:36,600
Go.

1536
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,000
Go.

1537
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,960
Proceed.

1538
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,240
I told you not to do.

1539
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,520
- What happened?
- Hey!

1540
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,400
Throw him in the store room.

1541
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,200
Please, sir.

1542
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,320
Send me in.

1543
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,800
Better bribe me.

1544
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,160
Show me.

1545
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Is the money safe?

1546
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
Are you hearing?

1547
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,760
Roger, the kid is rescued.

1548
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,079
Hey, nothing will happen
to the phone, right?

1549
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,559
Nothing will happen, sir.

1550
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,959
It'll just break.

1551
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,599
Kuttima bough it for me
with love.

1552
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,040
Leave it, sir.

1553
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,120
Hey, go right.

1554
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,240
Little down.

1555
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,320
Hey, isn't she Hasini?

1556
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,520
She went to the Police.

1557
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:12,519
Thanks to the almighty.

1558
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,960
First, show me the phone.

1559
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,320
Go left.

1560
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,040
Look here, someone is going
inside casually.

1561
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,176
How did he get inside beyond
these many policemen?

1562
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,559
Why is he going into this house?

1563
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,560
Whose house is this?

1564
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,039
This is Hasini's house.

1565
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,200
That child's house?

1566
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:32,880
In Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the
terrorists have planned for a major attack.

1567
01:26:32,881 --> 01:26:37,719
In Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the
terrorists have planned for a major attack.

1568
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,720
Brother.

1569
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,280
Somehow, I escaped from the Police.

1570
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,040
We had three patterns,
Why can't we trigger the bomb?

1571
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,479
That's what, I don't know.

1572
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,320
It's perplexing.

1573
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:49,120
My guy is well talented.

1574
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
Kumar, - yes.

1575
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,240
We'll be back.

1576
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,999
Let's discuss with others and
find a good solution.

1577
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Right?

1578
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Mubarak!

1579
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,160
In Mumbai and Rayalaseema,
the bomb exploded at the right time.

1580
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,159
Five hundred people from the public,
the school children,

1581
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,040
Those who were doing prayers,
everyone is dead.

1582
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,520
But, what happened here?

1583
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,080
We're trying.

1584
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,560
It's becoming very difficult.

1585
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,119
Hakeem was inside the car
where the bomb was kept.

1586
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:17,640
What happened to him?

1587
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:19,600
He made that ready and came out.

1588
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:20,120
But, he didn't come here.

1589
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:21,280
But, he didn't come here.

1590
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,319
Call the Sharma couple.

1591
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,400
I tried, couldn't get the line.

1592
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,519
In bomb blast in Rayalaseema, Andhra,

1593
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:34,480
330 people died and more than
50 people are injured.

1594
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,559
In the gun fire between the terrorists
and the Policemen...

1595
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,039
We must decide, what to do next?

1596
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,319
Somehow, we must cheat the Police,
take the car out,

1597
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,959
And blast the bomb in 10 minutes.

1598
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,439
How to blast the bomb?

1599
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,719
The problems are mounting up
because of the bank robbers.

1600
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:47,760
What happened?

1601
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,240
What happened?

1602
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,840
Some problem in the set up.
It's not working.

1603
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,280
Did you activate the automatic
network modulator?

1604
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,600
Try to overwrite using
the proxy network.

1605
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:00,840
That too isn't working.

1606
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:04,560
My stomach has bulged
due to the lunch that I had.

1607
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,199
Is that Policeman
standing there only?

1608
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,119
For the past two hours
he is standing there only.

1609
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,159
We know that.

1610
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,839
If our sister goes and tells
wrong about uncle.

1611
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,240
Mistaking for everything.

1612
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,559
Who are you?

1613
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,839
Did you come to buy chappati?

1614
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,959
You're the boss
for all these people.

1615
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,119
In mixing the dough.

1616
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:34,439
In North India, even the Parotta maker
looks like a model.

1617
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,840
What, dear?

1618
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,239
Hey, the burglar who
threatened the cops, abducting Hasini?

1619
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,920
He is also going into
Hasini's house.

1620
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,920
Something interesting is going to happen.

1621
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,879
Hey, look the car is shaking.

1622
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,279
Yes. It seems someone is inside.

1623
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,440
We'll look in a closer range.

1624
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:23,078
Oh, no!

1625
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:24,079
Oh, no!

1626
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,040
Oh, no!

1627
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,080
What happened?

1628
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,519
The helicopter has fallen down
and it broke.

1629
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,399
Then my phone bought by
Kuttima with love?

1630
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:36,440
Sorry sir.

1631
01:29:36,441 --> 01:29:37,920
Sorry sir.

1632
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,120
Don't get down.
I'll shoot, if you get down.

1633
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,519
Sir, Mic 21 Kuberan.

1634
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,359
The robber has come
to my place, sir.

1635
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,360
Hey...

1636
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,559
The robber has come here.
I am stuck alone.

1637
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,600
Save me, sir.

1638
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:58,800
Hey...

1639
01:29:58,801 --> 01:30:00,519
Sir, I haven't even got this
month's salary.

1640
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,199
Hey, don't shoot, no...
I've two daughters, sir.

1641
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,679
Sir, please somehow save me.

1642
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,440
- Sir, please sir.
- Hey...

1643
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,120
Kuberan, the police force is on the way.
Hey, drop your rifle.

1644
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,719
Sir, somehow save me.
Which street and which house?

1645
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:11,400
Hey...

1646
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:12,999
Dasappa street,
the same green colour house.

1647
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,400
No...

1648
01:30:13,401 --> 01:30:14,799
Keep the situation
under your control.

1649
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,559
Please, understand my
situation, sir.

1650
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,200
Sir, send the forces immediately.
Listen to me and drop the rifle.

1651
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:19,840
Hey...

1652
01:30:19,841 --> 01:30:21,319
Kuberan, are you able to
receive the Commissioner's order?

1653
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,559
Is the Commissioner speaking?
Okay, sir.

1654
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,319
Hey, if you shoot,
I'll kill you.

1655
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,639
Catch him.

1656
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,240
Why are you standing? Catch him.

1657
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,480
Catch him.

1658
01:30:28,481 --> 01:30:30,879
Sir, is there a way to go out?
Hey, why are you standing? Catch him.

1659
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,799
Hey, don't shoot. If you shoot...
Don't try to escape, I'll shoot you.

1660
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,519
Listen to me.
Hey, I'll kill you.

1661
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,559
Kuberan, Ibrahim here.

1662
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,000
- Mic 21, coming sir.
- Hey...

1663
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,600
Take the shot.

1664
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,560
Sir!

1665
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:43,319
Kuberan, don't be afraid.

1666
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,519
Snipers are around you.
Don't worry.

1667
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,639
Selva is rounded up.

1668
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,920
C 17 in position.

1669
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,680
C 4 in position.

1670
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,120
C 3 in position.

1671
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:51,840
C 9 in position.

1672
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:53,040
C 9 in position.

1673
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,160
Yes, sir.

1674
01:30:56,161 --> 01:30:57,959
Snipers are there.

1675
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:58,000
Shoot him.
Kuberan, take the shot.

1676
01:30:58,001 --> 01:30:59,919
Shoot him.
Kuberan, take the shot.

1677
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,920
Okay sir.

1678
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,720
I said shoot him.

1679
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,999
Sir, please... Don't shoot me.

1680
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,519
Now take the shot.
Sir, don't shoot me...

1681
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,399
Sir, tell him...
Please don't shoot me...

1682
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,799
Don't listen to him.
Kuberan, listen to me.

1683
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,799
I'm taking the money for
the child's surgery. Don't shoot me...

1684
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,319
Sir, tell him, I'm taking the money for
my child's surgery.

1685
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,999
I said not to hesitate.
Please, sir...

1686
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,319
The child's life can be saved only
if I take this money.

1687
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,839
Please, tell him sir.

1688
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,479
Sir, tell him, I'm not a terrorist.

1689
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,800
I'm taking this money, to save a child's life.
- Kuberan, listen to me.

1690
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:32,560
Don't listen to him.
Sir, don't shoot me.

1691
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:34,799
Don't listen to him.
Sir, don't shoot me.

1692
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,399
Sir, tell him...

1693
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,399
Kuberan, don't believe him.
Sir, I'll give you the money, I have.

1694
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,376
He is trying to change by giving money.
- Sir, I'll give you the money. Please sir...

1695
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,280
Take the shot.

1696
01:31:42,281 --> 01:31:44,919
Listen to me, don't believe him.
Brother, please wait. Just a minute...

1697
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,999
He is trying to bribe you.

1698
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,840
Why that Policeman took
a selfie standing here?

1699
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,839
Brother, the Police has come to catch us.

1700
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,480
Selva, take the shot.

1701
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,840
Thank god.

1702
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,600
What happened, Ibrahim?

1703
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:33,080
It's done, sir.

1704
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:34,160
It's done, sir.

1705
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,839
You've done a good job.

1706
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,879
Master plan!

1707
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:37,880
- Thank you sir.
- What.

1708
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,080
Is it a plan?

1709
01:32:39,081 --> 01:32:41,400
The Police has arrived.

1710
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,519
The Police are firing at us.

1711
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,200
Run.

1712
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,200
Run fast.

1713
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,320
Hey, Police.

1714
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,520
Take the weapons. Come fast.

1715
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,760
Shoot the police.

1716
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,640
A report came from IB
in the morning, sir.

1717
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,536
The Police Commissioners of
the three states spoke to me.

1718
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,240
Particularly, Mumbai and Chittoor
city Commissioners spoke to me.

1719
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,359
They told me their decision
to alert the people in that locale...

1720
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,960
and do a stint operation.

1721
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,599
I disagreed with that Idea.

1722
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,039
Because, if we do that operation,

1723
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,840
There will be loss of lives
on both the sides.

1724
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,320
Alert the people also here, sir.

1725
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,240
I've a different stratagem, sir.

1726
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,320
Ashok, the best bomb defuser
in our department.

1727
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,440
Because of some issues,
he has taken 6 months leave.

1728
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,720
I called him and asked for help.

1729
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,936
I convinced him saying
Ashok's batch mate Selva...

1730
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,600
is ready for this operation.

1731
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,559
We need a dog for this plan
to defuse the bomb.

1732
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,680
So, we employed the dog, Dupy.

1733
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,960
We started our scouting.

1734
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,879
Four people are new
to that house, isn't it?

1735
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,680
No sir, they've come for a function.

1736
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,879
A car is standing near the tank
for past 2 days what about that?

1737
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,320
I've checked it. No doubt, sir.

1738
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,360
What about the Nigerian's stay
in that house?

1739
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,080
I went there, they didn't
allow us inside.

1740
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,359
Ashok, we must find the vehicle
where the bomb is placed.

1741
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,679
We must find out
the terrorists place.

1742
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,120
Yes, sir.

1743
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:49,279
We've to wait till
we defuse the bomb.

1744
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:49,800
Okay, sir.

1745
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,080
Only then is the operation.

1746
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:51,880
- It's my order.
- Okay, sir.

1747
01:34:51,881 --> 01:34:53,199
- Who are you?
- What mam?

1748
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,879
That house is locked.
What are you doing there?

1749
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,799
We're searching for a vacant house.

1750
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,519
Are you searching for the house
on the terrace?

1751
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:58,560
Three people are standing
on the terrace of Anbu's house.

1752
01:34:58,561 --> 01:35:01,680
Three people are standing
on the terrace of Anbu's house.

1753
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,320
We created a scene that a robbery
is going to happen in the Access bank.

1754
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,559
We convinced that manager,
went inside and spoke to...

1755
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,440
all the clients and panicked them.

1756
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,520
Ashok and Selva team visited the bank
and changed the securities.

1757
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,800
And made the police
to stay there in mufti.

1758
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,520
We narrowed our
search to six houses.

1759
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,840
As per the IB report we got,

1760
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,320
Six terrorists are staying in RS Puram
and they're setting up one car bomb.

1761
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:10,400
But, we don't know about the car
and the house.

1762
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,120
We've to buy the time.

1763
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,079
We came to know that
the two terrorists...

1764
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,560
are staying separately in a house.

1765
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,080
We encountered both the terrorists.

1766
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,720
The police dog smelled the bomb
in the vehicle.

1767
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,280
Sir, Dupy has found the vehicle
with the bomb.

1768
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:31,678
A blue colour van.

1769
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:32,679
A blue colour van.

1770
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,000
Kuberan identified a terrorist
in a house.

1771
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,319
We came to know that
those two people in the photo...

1772
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,360
was there in the Mumbai attack.

1773
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,719
Sniper sir.

1774
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,720
See here.

1775
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:56,560
A partially blind person is
in the upstairs.

1776
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,120
He is blind.

1777
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,920
Mic C 2.

1778
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,959
One of the terrorist has activated
the bomb in the vehicle.

1779
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,880
So, we're forced to shoot him.
Take a shot.

1780
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,319
To defuse the bomb in the vehicle,

1781
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,919
We made the officer Ashok,
to come near to the vehicle.

1782
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:55,960
We did a mock shoot
on him with the snipers.

1783
01:37:55,961 --> 01:37:58,439
We did a mock shoot
on him with the snipers.

1784
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:03,520
He defused the bomb in the van,
as if he fell down dead.

1785
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,159
What about the blood that oozed out
from Ashok, on shooting?

1786
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,960
That's the artificial blood.

1787
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,160
Am I right?

1788
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,640
You found it, sir.

1789
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,039
To explode that bomb,
they've used three different methods.

1790
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,679
Signal activator, liquid detonation
and the timer.

1791
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,360
But, we couldn't defuse the bomb
within the planned time.

1792
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,960
Sir, it's very complicated.

1793
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,760
They've connected it
to the signal activator.

1794
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,320
Sir, we've sent the child inside.

1795
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,959
We created a drama by kidnapping
the house owner's child...

1796
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,440
where the terrorists were staying.

1797
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,679
By utilising that time,
I can't defuse it.

1798
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,680
What happened?

1799
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:41,838
Hurry up.

1800
01:39:41,839 --> 01:39:42,480
Hurry up.

1801
01:39:42,481 --> 01:39:43,761
Just wait.
Don't leave the child.

1802
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,879
Once the bomb was defused,

1803
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,360
We decided to shoot
all the terrorists.

1804
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,359
We got an information that
one of the terrorist is roaming out.

1805
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,400
I must go urgently, sir.

1806
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,080
The terrorist who couldn't
enter RS puram,

1807
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,840
Bribed the policeman
and came inside.

1808
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,600
It's our plan asking the policeman
to accept the bribe.

1809
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,799
Hey police, you came to our place
and cheat us.

1810
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,640
Hey, I'll kill...

1811
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,640
I won't leave you.

1812
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,120
I'll kill you.

1813
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,879
One more.

1814
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,040
Hey, get up.

1815
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,320
Get up.

1816
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:43,679
Hey Police,

1817
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,880
Go back. Go.

1818
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,440
Go back. Go.

1819
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:49,800
Go.

1820
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,399
Don't come near me.
I'll kill you.

1821
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:52,280
I'll kill him.

1822
01:40:52,281 --> 01:40:55,039
Go back. Go.

1823
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,720
Ashok, Selva don't worry
about my life.

1824
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,520
It's okay, if Kuberan gets killed.

1825
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,280
This operation must be successful.

1826
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,720
Kill all these people.

1827
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,240
Drop your rifles.

1828
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:05,801
Don't worry about me.
Drop your rifles.

1829
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,639
Do what I say.

1830
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:12,239
Tell them to drop the rifles down.

1831
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,679
Hey... Hold.

1832
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:14,720
I'll shoot him.

1833
01:41:14,721 --> 01:41:15,839
I'll shoot him.

1834
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:16,960
Shoot him.

1835
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:19,720
Ask him to drop the rifle down.

1836
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:21,279
Ask him to drop the rifle down.

1837
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,960
Drop it.

1838
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:23,520
Else, I'll kill him.

1839
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,600
- Down...
- I'll explode his head.

1840
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,600
Fast.

1841
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,079
Hurry up... hurry up...

1842
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,920
Ask the army men,
to drop the rifles down.

1843
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,520
Ashok, do what I say.
In all the buildings.

1844
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,120
Hurry, drop the rifles down.
Shoot him.

1845
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,120
Don't drop the rifle.

1846
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:41,560
Drop the rifle down.

1847
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:44,959
Hey Police, by disguising
as thieves,

1848
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,199
You've cheated us.

1849
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Do it.

1850
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,239
I'll die only after killing 10 people.

1851
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,160
Hurry up.

1852
01:41:52,161 --> 01:41:54,080
Else, I'll kill him.

1853
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,000
This is what happened sir.

1854
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,919
Oh, everything is a plan then?

1855
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,719
Then, it's a plan that your hand is hurt.

1856
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,279
Why are you still having
that bandage on your hand?

1857
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,240
Untie it.

1858
01:42:23,241 --> 01:42:25,960
Sir, got the reports.

1859
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,239
There is a tiny crack.

1860
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,040
So, don't move your hand.

1861
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,080
This is not a plan, sir.

1862
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,280
It's a real injury.

1863
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:33,640
In Mumbai and Andhra Pradesh,

1864
01:42:33,641 --> 01:42:35,759
They had attacked the terrorists
directly and killed them.

1865
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,320
But, why do you need
such a drama?

1866
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,279
In the Mumbai operation you mentioned,
250 civilians have died.

1867
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,799
In Andhra Pradesh, 55 school children
and 36 people in the mosque were died.

1868
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:47,000
In our operation, not even
a single civilian is dead.

1869
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,239
If known earlier, I too would've
helped you in this operation.

1870
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,359
No, sir.

1871
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,679
You wouldn't have helped us,
sir.

1872
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:52,720
Sorry, sir.
No secret stays with you.

1873
01:42:52,721 --> 01:42:54,319
Sorry, sir.
No secret stays with you.

1874
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,200
How dare you!

1875
01:42:55,201 --> 01:42:56,240
Stop it.

1876
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,160
If we want to question him,

1877
01:42:57,161 --> 01:42:58,799
We can keep questioning
for the whole day.

1878
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,959
We can have an inquiry on him.

1879
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,199
We can even suspend him.

1880
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,999
But, he had finished this
operation successfully.

1881
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,760
The only respect
we can show him is...

1882
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Sir.

1883
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,160
Hey, lift.

1884
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,200
Sorry.

1885
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:21,880
Sir, slowly.

1886
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,240
Have you come to make rotis?

1887
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,040
Bastards.

1888
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,720
Okay.

1889
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,000
Okay.

1890
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:08,160
Dear, have I tortured you a lot?

1891
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,640
Thank you for your cooperation.

1892
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,560
Good girl.

1893
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,360
Do you like this aunty
very much?

1894
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,559
Really. Very good.

1895
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,679
How happy is she, sir.

1896
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,441
To take care of your daughter,
you won't get a better mother than her.

1897
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,200
Sir.

1898
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Talk to her.

1899
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
Marry her.

1900
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,520
Bye.
