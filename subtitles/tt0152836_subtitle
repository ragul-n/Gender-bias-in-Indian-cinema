1
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:41,781
Make no promises

2
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,961
And should you make a promise...

3
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,469
never break it

4
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,474
Never must you
break a promise

5
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:18,109
Never must you
take someone's hand

6
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:26,868
But when you do...
you must never leave it

7
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:44,427
I wish I could fly
like those clouds...

8
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:51,309
I wish I could fly
like those kites

9
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:02,570
There will come this stranger who
will take you away as his bride

10
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,950
Every norm of society
will I break...

11
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,955
but I will not leave
my father's house

12
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,334
Defy destiny,
you mustn't

13
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,714
Remain quiet;
say nothing

14
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:31,307
Make no promises

15
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,657
If you do promise...

16
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:55,165
If you do make a promise,
you must never break it

17
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,533
Tarababu, the girls have grown up.

18
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,246
You run a school on
government sanction.

19
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,915
Your brother too does nothing.

20
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,710
You are surrounded by old debts.

21
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,048
You sing in every wedding.

22
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,427
Have you given although
to your daughters' marriage?

23
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:55,141
- What should I do?
- You have so many official contacts.

24
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,726
Use them.

25
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,314
The land of many landlords
is under dispute.

26
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,359
Make a killing. Earn something.

27
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,611
You always think like a broker.

28
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,573
I've often told you,
I'm an artist not a broker!

29
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,662
I know my art and will earn
without paying or receiving bribes.

30
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,622
Eat a carrot.

31
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,847
- Good day brother.
- Live long.

32
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,225
How are you? Hello.

33
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,105
Has everyone reached safely?

34
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,235
- Yes?
- What's going on?

35
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,990
We have a contract for 100 acres of
land in Chamba. It's been 5years.

36
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,786
We've run around but the land
is still not in our possession.

37
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,538
It's not like the old times.

38
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,168
Everything changed when
the government changed.

39
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,297
We've already invested

40
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,558
Now if the government doesn't
let us embark on the project...

41
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,561
We'll suffer a loss
of6 billion!

42
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,317
Elder brother has come.

43
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,071
- Come here, my kids!
- Big Daddy is here!

44
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,327
- How are you?
- Very well.

45
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,831
- Hello, brother.
- Hello, brother-in-law.

46
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,044
- Did you like Chamba?
- There's something about it.

47
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,754
Yes.

48
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,306
And you, Janki...?

49
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,145
I won't say anything. This sister is
happy where her brother is happy.

50
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,901
Where is Manav?

51
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,530
- He is in Delhi.
- Why?

52
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,200
- Didn't he come with you?
- We did tell him to.

53
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,538
But he asked us to carry on.
Said he'd reach here on his own.

54
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,665
- Alone.
- That's strange.

55
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,003
He's coming to India for the first
time and will come here on his own!

56
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,424
When he doesn't obey you,
how would he listen to us?

57
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,052
Said he'd see India on the way.

58
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,381
The entire family is searching for
you and you're standing here! Come on

59
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,387
Keep the files in the car.
We have to go to the commissioner.

60
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,264
- Good morning uncle.
- Good morning.

61
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,018
Where were you? Any way now that
you're here, work on this project.

62
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,105
Your father has been waiting for you.

63
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:58,028
How would Manav know how a
father's soul pines for his son?

64
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,450
Welcome, sir.

65
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,753
It's all right.

66
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,591
You apologized and I accepted.

67
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,845
I know that, Your Highness.
I know what you will now say.

68
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,182
- What will I say?
- You'll say, Manav my son...

69
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,645
You should have thought
of yourself if not Daddy.

70
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,692
Such a long journey.

71
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,738
You've come to India from
London for the first time.

72
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,409
You could have got lost.
Somebody could pinch your pocket.

73
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,039
Somebody could have kidnapped you.
Then what would have happened?

74
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,503
But nothing of that sort happened.

75
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,421
Nothing happened, Dad.

76
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,427
- To tell the truth...
- I also know.

77
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,430
What Your Honour
is going to say.

78
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,017
You are going to say...

79
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,691
If you want to see India,
don't travel in a helicopter.

80
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,153
Sit in a second class
railway bogey and see.

81
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:27,158
Sit in ramshackle buses!
Walk through stuff y lanes!

82
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:33,915
Observe the Indian who is
not successful in anything.

83
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,960
Yet he smiles, sings, plays!

84
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,010
And Chamba is the best.

85
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:53,518
That is why I got you the latest
Digital Floppy camera from Singapore.

86
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,936
Take a look.

87
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,743
Brownie...
He missed you the most.

88
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,288
Go on.
He's very annoyed with you.

89
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,626
Did you follow what the
father and son spoke?

90
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,004
- You keep quiet!
- I am silent.

91
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,263
Mad at me?

92
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm sorry I'm late.

93
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,855
Won't you forgive me?

94
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,196
Coming for a walk?

95
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,866
No...?

96
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,536
I'm leaving.
Come along if you want.

97
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,574
Shall we take a picture?

98
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,913
Only the minister can
approve this project.

99
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:04,918
Who can make him do it?
- Just one one, sir.

100
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,172
His childhood friend. Tarababu.

101
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,718
So call him over.
- He's a very self-respecting man.

102
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,723
I tried my best to do him in,
but he wouldn't relent.

103
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,381
Who ever you are...
wherever you are...

104
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,136
Wherever it be...

105
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,806
You are the spring.

106
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,473
My heart is restless

107
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,146
My eyes glued to the path

108
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:57,238
My heart is restless and my eyes
are on the path

109
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:03,495
Life is miserable...
no music appeals

110
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:10,168
So come over, my Love...

111
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:16,424
Let's make music

112
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:25,326
The rains have drenched me today

113
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:31,541
Drowned I am...
in my modesty

114
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:53,688
I have this feeling,
I can't understand

115
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:01,613
I have lost something...
but is it my heart?

116
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:10,372
Don't be quiet; say something;
sway with me...

117
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:16,211
Walk in step whith me...

118
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:30,744
I admit, I do not know you

119
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:37,000
I also know that
you do not know me

120
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,256
That we may get
to know each other...

121
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:52,015
Come closer to my heart...
for the sake of our hearts

122
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:05,195
I'm in the same state
as you are...

123
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:13,328
Come, Let's share our state

124
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,170
Hold the rope!
Tie it to your waist.

125
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,215
We'll pull you out.

126
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,849
Help! Help!

127
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,874
What a place to get introduced!

128
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,254
Can I take a picture of yours?

129
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,327
Just buy vegetables!

130
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:39,886
Uncle...

131
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,840
Brownie, have you ever
seen such a scene?

132
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,971
Neither is this the way to behave
nor is this civilised behaviour!

133
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:26,808
- You'll have to deal with me!
- What is the matter?

134
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,645
What is the matter! His son
was falling off the mountain.

135
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:37,610
My girls rescued him. The cheek
of him! He took their pictures!

136
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:42,532
Brigadier sir, if your daughter
is playing in the rain...

137
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:46,870
Bathing... and a strange boy
secretly takes her photographs...

138
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,329
What will you do?

139
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:51,875
- I'd shoot him!
- That's what I'm here for!

140
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:56,921
As if he's civilised!
Gate crashes uninvited into a party!

141
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,383
And with a stick in hand!
Isn't that like a bully?

142
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:06,890
Madam! You're in Chamba! You
maybe great in your own homes.

143
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,686
- Don't you dare oppose me!
- Sir, Tara...

144
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,193
I am the second brother of
this family, Deep Mohan.

145
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:24,407
If our child has made a mistake,
we apologise with folded hands.

146
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,702
Bring your son here.

147
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:33,375
When the elder of the family
are apologizing, forget the anger.

148
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:40,090
Today is our son's birthday.
Won't you bless him?

149
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,885
- Yes, fine...
- Son, greet uncle.

150
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,971
- Hello uncle.
- Give him a kiss. Come on...

151
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:52,018
Live long. But you must
explain to your son.

152
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:57,816
If he has taken any unflattering
picture, he must return it.

153
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,028
- Now I'll take leave.
- Please attend the party.

154
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:05,031
No, I must move along.

155
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:11,079
He left his stick here.

156
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:32,183
- Good day. I'm Manav Mehta.
- Good day.

157
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:37,105
Your stick...
You left it at our home

158
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,566
Yes... l...

159
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:47,490
- So you're the prince who...
...erred by taking pictures.

160
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,369
I've come to you to
apologise for it.

161
00:31:53,830 --> 00:32:00,754
You seem a good sort. Return
the pictures you'd taken to us.

162
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,802
Here you are.

163
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,264
What in the world is this?

164
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,644
I want the round thing you
put in the camera... reel...?

165
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,980
No, this is a floppy.

166
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,777
I have this camera wherein
you put in a floppy...

167
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,945
- It doesn't have the reel system.
- What?

168
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,157
I'll take a picture of yours.

169
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,162
Forget it...

170
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,664
You may keep this.

171
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,960
We won't understand computers.

172
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:45,799
- But henceforth you...
- There's no need to take pictures.

173
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:50,512
You are such beautiful people
that your picture is in my heart.

174
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,475
May I take leave? Good day.

175
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:01,773
He's a wonderful man.

176
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:14,452
These artists are made that way.

177
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,080
Emotional...

178
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:24,796
- Tarawas angry with us.
- But Deep handled him very well.

179
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:31,594
But keep in mind, the Goddesses of
wealth and learning don't get along.

180
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:36,850
They will gel and
make wonderful music.

181
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,520
- How is that?
- I have an idea.

182
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,401
Take us to Tarababu's
house tomorrow morning.

183
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,278
Then watch me.

184
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:55,744
- This is him.
- Good day.

185
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:01,624
Good day.
You...

186
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,381
I am the eldest brother
of this family. Jagmohan.

187
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,760
And Manav's father.

188
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,349
We've come to apologise
for Manav's impertinence.

189
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:22,145
Good Lord! Don't mention it.

190
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:27,025
I didn't realise the matter
would be dragged so far.

191
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:34,032
I never imagined such wealthy
people could be so humble!

192
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:41,706
It was last night that Rambhajan
said you were so rich yet simple.

193
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:48,922
Do you know this man lunches with
the Prime Minister of every nation?

194
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:54,552
Isn't it? And I've heard your
picture appears on front pages?

195
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,390
How ever famous a disciple of
the Goddess of wealth maybe...

196
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,686
He's still below the disciples
of the Goddess of Knowledge.

197
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:09,275
No, I'm just a petty folk singer.

198
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,614
It is this simplicity of yours
that brings us to you.

199
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:23,164
I am really ashamed to have come
to your house and misbehaved.

200
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:32,882
No. I'll accept your apology only
when you accept our little gift.

201
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,718
Gift...?

202
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:39,931
Lift it.

203
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:25,602
Today you have given a soul
to our ashram.

204
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,646
Son...

205
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,816
It is today that God
has come to my home.

206
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,949
- I am Santram.
- I see...

207
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:44,954
I am Brijmohan...

208
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,601
Raise your right hand...

209
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:14,943
Bend forward.

210
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,030
Right hand down.

211
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,951
Both hands down.

212
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:26,621
Feet together.

213
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,337
So what were we doing?
...Yes, yoga.

214
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,549
Raise both hands.

215
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,636
Bend forward.

216
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,725
Bend fully.

217
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,816
Raise yourself.

218
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,278
Lower your hands.

219
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,574
Coming.

220
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,077
- You take over till I return.
- Okay.

221
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,624
Father... what is it?

222
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,087
Come here, my dear.
I must introduce you.

223
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,427
They have brought us a statue
of Mother Saraswati from Bombay.

224
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,643
She is my only child, Mansi.

225
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,064
She is single but scolds me a lot.

226
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,025
Hello, dear.

227
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,780
I forgot to introduce you
to Balwant.

228
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,450
She is my sister-in-law.

229
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,915
And these are my disciples.

230
00:38:55,251 --> 00:39:00,048
We live together and
make wonderful music.

231
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:10,225
- That's well written.
- The beat is the life of song.

232
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,519
The beat creates music.

233
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:17,524
The rhythm of beat gives life.
It gives rise to love.

234
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,319
- That's wonderful!
- My daughter composed it.

235
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,279
- Mansi...
- Really?

236
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:28,034
- Have you composed this?
- Yes? Yes.

237
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,875
- Yes?
- I have a request.

238
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,295
We're hosting a party tonight.

239
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,881
Important friends of mine from
Delhi will be attending.

240
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:46,720
I'd like you to come. Your presence
will add a feather to our cap.

241
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,015
How can I refuse you?

242
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:53,893
But you have to attend
the wedding of Mania.

243
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,563
Oh yes.

244
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:05,488
You can go there and Mansi and I
will go to their house for dinner.

245
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:22,422
This is Mr. Jindal,
the CEO of Zee TV.

246
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:27,844
Tarababu sings beautifully.

247
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:34,476
I'd like you to showcase his talent
to the world through your channel.

248
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:40,231
Aunt, how much does
my balloon weigh?

249
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,360
Your balloon... weighs...

250
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,170
The blast scared you?

251
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,965
So you were behind this prank?

252
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,343
No, the kids.

253
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,973
By the way, you may
consider me a child.

254
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:15,850
I can see that.

255
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,439
This...? He is my heart.

256
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:24,609
My friend, Brownie.

257
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:27,070
Say Hello.

258
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,242
Don't you have any friends?

259
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,246
No. My relatives are my friends.

260
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,708
I too have enough of them.

261
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,878
I have a grandmother
who lives in Bombay

262
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:48,008
- Would you like to meet her?
- Will you do that?

263
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:50,927
Hold him.

264
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:56,558
Just a minute. Don't go away.

265
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,525
I too will get one picture
taken with the big boss.

266
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:09,654
I'll be privileged to be
photographed with you.

267
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,582
Aren't you Tarababu's daughter?

268
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:26,421
Made friends with the dogs
as soon as you entered?

269
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:30,842
That's called a smart girl!

270
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,473
Sorry, I took awhile.

271
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,773
He's building relations.

272
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:53,406
You must come to Bombay
and stay with us.

273
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:58,411
My second cousin stays in Bombay!

274
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,873
She's a reporter.

275
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,920
The way she speaks! From Bombay.

276
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:12,967
Look at this. She's my grandma.

277
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:19,224
She's my only friend
who truly knows me.

278
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,947
- Have you seen Manav?
- Yes. - Where is he?

279
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,699
There he's gone!

280
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:43,206
You teach yoga very well.

281
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:51,715
Will you teach me?

282
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:57,846
Sure but... you will have
to become my student.

283
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,348
Definitely.

284
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,769
Isn't it a good band?

285
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,608
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

286
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:18,616
My friend, Mania is getting
married. Dad dragged me here.

287
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,787
And you want to attend
your friend's party?

288
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:29,836
Yes because Shanno, ...
everyone is there.

289
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,338
Will you drop me there?

290
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,851
- I'll come to see you.
- To see me? Why?

291
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:47,437
To learn yoga.

292
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:51,900
- Sure.
- Promise?

293
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:54,778
- Yes.
- Sure?

294
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,364
Not sure!

295
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,631
Mansi! We thought you won't come.

296
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,591
- We've been waiting for so long!
- Yes.

297
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,511
- How could I not come?
- You will have to sing today.

298
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,138
- Isn't it? - Yes.
- You sing.

299
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,433
- You first. - No, you sing.
- You sing, I won't.

300
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:29,229
- You must sing.
- Let's go!

301
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:04,097
To what end be death
if not for love?

302
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:12,856
And what is life
without love?

303
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,989
Sweeter than sweet is love;
And sourer than the sourest is love

304
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:27,245
A promise that is kept... love;
a tie between lovers... love

305
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:50,435
To what end be death
if not for love...?

306
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:59,194
And what be life
if not for love?

307
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:45,008
On earth, is love;
in the Heavens is the Lord

308
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:51,890
Everything else is transitory
between Love and God

309
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:11,951
Say a hundred things,
should you wish...

310
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:18,833
The meaning still
remains the same

311
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:28,218
More beautiful than God... is love

312
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:34,474
And God is more
beautiful than anything else

313
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:25,191
More precious than any gem is love;
our only desire... love

314
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:58,391
Who has ever known
what love is

315
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,647
And yet, everyone knows
what love is

316
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:12,781
It's an unknown place,
the beloved's home

317
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:19,037
A long journey for a small life...
whoever has known love?

318
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:26,544
A balm for those suffering?
Is it really love or God Himself?

319
00:51:55,657 --> 00:52:02,872
You have only heard
of love

320
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:11,631
And I have actually loved

321
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:21,057
A garden of roses... love;
strewn with thorns too, is love

322
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,912
What's going on?

323
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:00,925
Did you see that?

324
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,930
Let's go back.

325
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:06,324
Remember last night's promise?

326
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:09,077
You said you'd teach me yoga.

327
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,832
I'm here.

328
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,425
Raise your hand.

329
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:26,428
Raise your hands high.

330
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:31,928
Look, this will never happen.

331
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,099
And this will not happen.

332
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,853
What won't happen?

333
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,608
You well know what I mean.

334
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:52,407
- We're two different people.
- Yes. So?

335
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:58,288
We are different.
And people do meet.

336
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:02,709
Have you ever seen the
mountain meet the valley?

337
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:07,714
- The earth and the sky...
- Do you love me?

338
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,176
- What?
- Love?

339
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:31,404
Listen... hear me out
and understand me well.

340
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:38,161
Girls from our family
do not fall in love.

341
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:45,251
Their circle only consists of
their parents and brothers.

342
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:51,257
- I understand.
- You are different.

343
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:53,760
I am different.

344
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:59,391
I shoulder the
responsibility of my Dad.

345
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:04,062
Only I understand the
sorrow within his heart.

346
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:09,693
And I don't want to be
responsible for giving him sorrow.

347
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,028
- Absolutely.
- That's it.

348
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:19,494
So please believe that
there's nothing between us.

349
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:22,831
How can I do that?
There is.

350
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:28,294
- What?
- That we're falling in love.

351
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:32,841
- You are very stubborn.
- I'm also truthful.

352
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:38,763
So hear my honest answer too.
I do not love you.

353
01:00:47,355 --> 01:00:48,940
I can't believe it.

354
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:52,777
Because I refused out right?

355
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,324
- You got scared.
- Of whom?

356
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:04,789
Of me. I might
cheat you and run away.

357
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:13,840
Look... don't try to
cast a spell on me.

358
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:17,302
So I have the capability.

359
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:21,473
Now I'll never meet you! Never!

360
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,491
Come on... wear this one.

361
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:14,192
Hail the Honourable Minister!

362
01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:18,947
Sir...

363
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:31,001
- Sir...
- Long live Ramprasad!

364
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,898
For the development of Himachal
Pradesh, Mehta and Mehta Company...

365
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:59,779
And his family are
co-operating with us.

366
01:03:00,947 --> 01:03:06,036
First of all we'd like
to thank Tarababu.

367
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:09,539
Who is a childhood friend of mine.

368
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:13,293
Tarababu is the pride of Chamba.

369
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:18,423
He holds on to his Ideals
even when living with the poor.

370
01:04:42,757 --> 01:04:45,468
Son... Manav...

371
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:47,721
Cold drink?

372
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:12,746
See that girl standing there?

373
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,625
- With the grey scarf? - Yes.
- Take this to her.

374
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:26,801
This was possible thanks to you.

375
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:33,683
Soft drinks have been
sent for you.

376
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:35,894
We don't want it.

377
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:41,274
Excuse me...

378
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:48,865
- What happened?
- Give this to me.

379
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:52,660
- You take another one.
- Why? - I'm thirsty!

380
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:56,081
Hold on.

381
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:23,441
What are you doing here?
Come and meet the minister.

382
01:06:25,443 --> 01:06:26,820
I'll be back in a minute.

383
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:56,850
I asked you to come to the stage
thrice. Couldn't you hear me?

384
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,394
- Come on.
- Yes.

385
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,774
Come on.

386
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:26,171
Now have you understood?

387
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:29,257
Yes, I've understood.

388
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:34,512
We'll all leave for
Bombay tomorrow.

389
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:14,969
I knew you'd come.

390
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:18,098
And that you'd come here.

391
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:26,523
Now tell me that
you don't love me.

392
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:32,028
Say it. Go on.

393
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,286
Why are you silent?

394
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,873
It's nothing.

395
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:16,216
I know what you're thinking.

396
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:19,135
What?

397
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,181
The same that happens
in normal Hindi films.

398
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,060
A city bred boy comes and
falls for the mountain girl.

399
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,940
Then he leaves her and goes away.

400
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:37,904
Then he never returns.

401
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,170
But... this will never happen.

402
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:57,757
This is my truth not a film.

403
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:00,468
It's my life.

404
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:05,682
Of course there
will be resistance.

405
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:10,770
I'll have to fight my family.

406
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,024
And you with your family.

407
01:11:19,237 --> 01:11:20,739
But it will work out.

408
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:28,997
I must now leave.

409
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:31,791
Manav, listen...

410
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,838
I was embroidering this for you...

411
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:41,593
But this is mine!

412
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:44,721
Yes but now it's ours.

413
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:47,557
See...

414
01:11:49,184 --> 01:11:50,852
What does Manavsi mean?

415
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:54,731
It means... Like Manav.

416
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,038
Like Manav.

417
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:32,102
Thank you very much. Do
meet us if you come to Bombay.

418
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:36,773
Yes and you must take care of
your health. Understood brother?

419
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,274
You too.

420
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,576
- Okay...
- Good bye.

421
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,026
- See that temple?
- Yes.

422
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:10,825
It is said that the God of
that temple grants everyone's wish.

423
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:14,579
I don't go to temples.

424
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:20,543
I've never been to a temple.

425
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,466
I won't stop you if
you want to go there.

426
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:34,349
- I don't understand.
- When I was 11, my mum died.

427
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:38,978
She always told me one thing...

428
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:42,732
The Lord resides in man's heart.

429
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:47,362
Here. In his subconsciousness.

430
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,909
After all what is God?
A belief, the truth.

431
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,162
Every man sees him in some form.

432
01:14:57,288 --> 01:14:59,040
Some in a book, others in idols.

433
01:14:59,749 --> 01:15:01,167
Some in the flame of a lamp.

434
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,545
I see God in myself. That's all.

435
01:15:06,214 --> 01:15:09,050
Your love too is a belief in me.

436
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:14,973
Yes, it's just a trust.

437
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:21,896
To remind you of that trust, I got
you something from the temple shop.

438
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:31,114
It's cheap. Made of stones.

439
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:35,326
But 100% true.

440
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:39,998
Come. Let's tie it
around your neck.

441
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:16,534
Who gave this necklace to you?

442
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:20,914
Who gave it??

443
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:27,170
You love your Dad a lot,
don't you?

444
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:30,840
- You love him. Don't you?
- Father, wait...

445
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:34,886
Before you say anything...

446
01:16:36,262 --> 01:16:41,184
Or misunderstand, I want
to tell you the truth.

447
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:49,109
- Manav gave this to me.
- Why?

448
01:16:51,277 --> 01:16:53,154
Because he loves me a lot.

449
01:16:57,158 --> 01:16:58,618
And you...?

450
01:17:01,746 --> 01:17:02,956
I too...

451
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:05,917
Are you in your senses?

452
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:10,880
Do you know who he is?
They are very wealthy people.

453
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,800
We have nothing in common!

454
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:17,345
But Manav and I do.

455
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:21,975
- Not with those rich people.
- This is impossible!

456
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:24,102
This is impossible!

457
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:33,319
This is Manav from Bombay.

458
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:40,076
- Father...
- What's wrong?

459
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:43,705
Why do you sound scared?
Is the situation tense?

460
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:48,626
Father... Mansi...

461
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:52,213
So father has found out?

462
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:54,966
Yes...

463
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,472
All right. Give the line to him.

464
01:18:01,264 --> 01:18:04,142
Father, it is Manav.

465
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:13,109
I'm sorry I couldn't
meet you before leaving.

466
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,947
I wanted to talk to you.
But I couldn't.

467
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,328
I'm glad you found out that I...

468
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:27,415
Are you listening?

469
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,669
Yes. Go on.

470
01:18:32,003 --> 01:18:37,634
I wanted to say the promise
I made to Mansi before I left...

471
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:40,053
...that is firm.

472
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,555
I will marry her.

473
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:48,019
I've committed myself to her.
And I will keep it.

474
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:52,107
You are worried because
you are her father.

475
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:58,196
Scolding her... in your shoes
I too would probably do the same.

476
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:05,078
Don't worry. If God is in your
heart, the truth is resolute.

477
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:25,473
Everything will be fine.
Your Dad is an artist.

478
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:28,977
Who can understand love
better than an artist?

479
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:35,483
Call me later.

480
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:52,083
Where have you been?
I've been calling you for so long.

481
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:59,591
- But you don't answer.
- Another twist in Manav's love story

482
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,596
Mansi's father has found out
that Mansi loves me.

483
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:08,475
I mean we're in love.

484
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,729
Forget about love and
look at this photograph.

485
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,900
She's the girl Deepmohan
and Shaku chose for you.

486
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:20,695
But I told her father clearly.

487
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:26,159
And I'll stand by my commitment.

488
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:29,913
But Jagmohan has something
else planned for you.

489
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:34,334
This girl belongs to the
Kurasia family, Nishita.

490
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,170
I too approve of her.

491
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:39,923
The girl has class.

492
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:45,553
After hearing my story too,
you show no sympathy.

493
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:48,682
It's pack up for all these girls.

494
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:53,269
I'll have sympathy
when you obey me.

495
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:59,567
You will have to marry
the girl I approve of.

496
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:05,323
No, grandma. This is not fair.
You're putting me in a tight corner!

497
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:09,869
There's this drama going on and
you're initiating another one!

498
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,712
You're my grandma. How
can you do this to me?

499
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:22,632
First take a look at the picture.

500
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:56,249
Don't fall in love.
Rise, my child.

501
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:13,558
- What are you doing here?
- The girls are worried about you.

502
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:16,895
I went to call Prabha.

503
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,899
- Bombay?
- Bombay.

504
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:24,611
I have just one sister
Prabha in Bombay.

505
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:28,823
Yes. What did she advise?

506
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:36,456
What will she say? She said
bring Mansi over to Bombay.

507
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:38,958
She herself will talk to her.

508
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:43,296
Then she will find an
answer to this problem.

509
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:51,137
She also said to come straight,
not to inform brother Jaggi.

510
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:55,809
I'm worried.

511
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,769
Will you go to Bombay?

512
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:03,650
I can't spend one night here.

513
01:23:07,153 --> 01:23:08,655
I will have to go to Bombay.

514
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:24,671
I'm glad you came to
Bombay under this pretext.

515
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:29,467
- Where is Ashwin?
- I divorced him.

516
01:23:30,927 --> 01:23:33,555
- Why?
- He deserved it.

517
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,393
But I have something
from him. My Tunno!

518
01:24:00,081 --> 01:24:03,418
After listening to your story...

519
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:05,754
I have reached one conclusion.

520
01:24:07,213 --> 01:24:11,009
You must go to Manav Mehta's
house at 7 in the morning.

521
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:13,261
And shock them.

522
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:21,561
I said sir does not
meet anybody today.

523
01:24:22,312 --> 01:24:25,357
Tell him I have come from Chamba.

524
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:29,861
I'm a close friend of his!

525
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:36,326
I don't have orders to telephone
or wake up anyone before 9.30.

526
01:24:36,826 --> 01:24:41,498
Take a seat on this bench.
I'll call at 9.30 or 10.

527
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:45,085
But we won't sit here!!
I'm his friend!

528
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,756
Only his friends
come here. Sit down.

529
01:24:52,258 --> 01:24:53,718
Take a seat.

530
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,097
Father, let's sit.

531
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:06,398
A Tarababu has come from Chamba.

532
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:09,192
- Make him sit out.
- All right madam.

533
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:17,992
Come and sit here.

534
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,290
Sit down.

535
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:29,838
- We won't sit here.
- Why?

536
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:34,718
Can I call up and talk to them?

537
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,178
To the master or their son?

538
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:41,599
The master is sleeping
and his son is not at home.

539
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:46,813
He has gone to his grandma's
house. Since last night. Sit.

540
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,514
Come here.

541
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,437
Do you know him?

542
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:33,068
Yes and he too knows me.

543
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:41,284
Do you see? He knows us!

544
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:44,829
I'll set you right later!

545
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,335
Shake hand, pal.

546
01:26:58,968 --> 01:27:01,596
I'm sure he'll go
and tell Jagmohan.

547
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:07,185
Lock him in the room!

548
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:10,146
Creating a nuisance
since morning!

549
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:51,563
I'll go and talk to him.

550
01:27:56,776 --> 01:27:57,944
Deep...

551
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:07,412
Go inside.

552
01:28:16,838 --> 01:28:19,257
- We have come.
- Tarababu, when did you come?

553
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:24,262
When? We're here since 7.30 AM!

554
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:28,016
That rascal of a guard!
Didn't he tell you?

555
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,061
We've been sitting for 6 hours!

556
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:34,272
And tell me where is Jagmohan?

557
01:28:35,273 --> 01:28:40,111
He's getting dressed. Special
guests have come from London.

558
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:43,782
He meets them over lunch.

559
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:48,203
Please be seated.
I'll inform him.

560
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:53,625
Make them sit in the shade.

561
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:57,712
Come and sit here.

562
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,302
Would you like
some tea or water?

563
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:10,016
- Get us some water.
- Right.

564
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,839
You've made them sit here?

565
01:29:41,965 --> 01:29:46,261
They are not non entities.
He is Tarababu from Chamba.

566
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:48,638
A dear friend of brother.

567
01:29:49,055 --> 01:29:53,643
He's come from a distance.
Make them sit in the lounge.

568
01:29:54,477 --> 01:29:55,687
In air conditioned comfort.

569
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:05,697
- You came without an appointment.
- Sister, we...

570
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,825
You've broken the rules
of this family

571
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:13,955
In this house, no one can meet
anyone without an appointment.

572
01:30:18,835 --> 01:30:20,712
- Yes, madam?
- Seat them inside.

573
01:30:38,855 --> 01:30:42,942
Didn't I tell you
to call them up?

574
01:30:44,235 --> 01:30:46,154
Did you hear what she said?

575
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:53,828
What appointment? Did they take an
appointment to come to our house?

576
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,042
What nonsense!

577
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:37,122
- No, father. Let's go.
- We will leave, my child.

578
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:43,003
We will leave but now
we'll see this drama through.

579
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:45,714
You people who perform
dramas in every street...

580
01:31:47,215 --> 01:31:52,012
Have you come here to perform
for or watch the Mehta family?

581
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:57,517
You have adorned your
daughter well to come here.

582
01:31:58,268 --> 01:32:01,438
To ensnare the prince
of this castle!

583
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:06,735
- Sister...
- I am not a sister to pimps like you!

584
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:10,780
It would be best for
you to return home.

585
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:16,536
I won't leave without
meeting Jagmohan.

586
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:22,876
He's having lunch with the English
What will you do there?

587
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:27,672
Wag your tail like a dog?

588
01:32:29,215 --> 01:32:34,721
Let Jagmohan come. I'll tell
him, the dogs he's tied outside...

589
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:38,224
He should tie this English
bitch along with them!

590
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:40,643
You called me a bitch!

591
01:32:45,523 --> 01:32:48,276
Throw them out of the house!

592
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:54,157
- Brother... we've been...
- Stop right there!

593
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:56,743
Stop right there.

594
01:32:58,411 --> 01:33:00,580
He called me a bitch!

595
01:33:01,664 --> 01:33:04,000
Uncle, did he say it or not?

596
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:06,920
- He did...
- That's it!

597
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:15,887
First you drop in uninvited.
Then you call me sister-in-law...

598
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:20,266
A bitch!
Yes, I called her a bitch!

599
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:26,815
Because your sister-in-law
behaved like a bitch.

600
01:33:28,274 --> 01:33:33,196
Yes, Tarababu from Chamba.

601
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:37,033
Your friend, you brother!

602
01:33:38,368 --> 01:33:42,706
You too may say something against
me if you wish. Go ahead!

603
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:47,711
You're not in the right state
of mind. Go home now.

604
01:33:48,044 --> 01:33:49,838
We'll talk in the office tomorrow.

605
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:54,592
- Finally you too said it!
- Yes I did.

606
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:15,113
Didn't even offer us water!

607
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:18,450
Didn't offer his pal a seat!

608
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:25,957
Terrific! You came to our
house as an important guest.

609
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:30,003
With a statue of
Mother Saraswati!

610
01:34:30,295 --> 01:34:35,508
Lofty talks! Artists
are a form of God!

611
01:34:35,925 --> 01:34:41,181
Greater than us, the wealthy!

612
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:51,608
You are a very sentimental man.

613
01:34:53,985 --> 01:34:56,863
We call every man
in a band, an artist.

614
01:34:57,947 --> 01:35:02,035
They come wagging their tails
once you show them a note.

615
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:05,830
Saraswati means nothing.

616
01:35:06,873 --> 01:35:08,458
You are sycophants of wealth!

617
01:35:09,751 --> 01:35:11,461
You drool at the sight of money.

618
01:35:12,295 --> 01:35:17,217
Only talk big! If you want to be
compensated for your work, sure...

619
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:23,973
- And get lost!
- You are right.

620
01:35:26,726 --> 01:35:31,481
And the fact is that
I want to be compensated.

621
01:35:32,816 --> 01:35:36,653
And I want it right now.

622
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,742
Tell me how much money you want.

623
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:02,804
Don't touch me, you rascal!

624
01:36:04,764 --> 01:36:08,101
You toyed with my emotions!

625
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,021
Now I got paid for it!

626
01:36:14,774 --> 01:36:16,234
What are you doing?

627
01:36:17,485 --> 01:36:18,653
What is going on here?

628
01:36:21,114 --> 01:36:23,283
You hit my father!

629
01:36:25,702 --> 01:36:27,203
Do you know what you've done!

630
01:36:29,164 --> 01:36:33,710
Nobody dared to say one
insulting word to him!

631
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:36,629
And you slapped him!

632
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:41,509
- Son...
- You have turned mad!

633
01:36:42,552 --> 01:36:44,763
Go away from here.

634
01:36:47,223 --> 01:36:49,309
Lest I raise my hand too!

635
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:54,147
Leave!

636
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:07,827
Raise your hand.
Beat my father.

637
01:37:09,245 --> 01:37:10,747
He did not show respect
to my Dad.

638
01:37:10,955 --> 01:37:18,380
Your father has honour
and my father has none?

639
01:37:20,965 --> 01:37:22,926
You are all alike.

640
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:27,263
Only wealthy.

641
01:37:28,723 --> 01:37:32,477
- Rich statues.
- Do you want to leave?

642
01:37:33,103 --> 01:37:40,068
Then leave. But I can't let
anyone insult my father or family.

643
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:45,782
My father means everything to me!

644
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:50,328
Do you understand?

645
01:37:50,912 --> 01:37:54,958
Yes, I understand.

646
01:37:57,544 --> 01:37:59,254
And now you too understand this.

647
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,633
Here is your love!

648
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:07,387
And here is your gift!

649
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,086
What will I tell Prabha?

650
01:39:22,587 --> 01:39:23,755
Father...

651
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:30,136
You don't cry.

652
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:36,393
Let's sit there, father.

653
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:44,859
Sit here.

654
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:34,951
My heart is restless

655
01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:41,583
I eagerly watch the path

656
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:50,425
My heart is restless and I eagerly
look at the path...

657
01:40:51,343 --> 01:40:56,681
Life is miserable...
no music appeals to me

658
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:03,772
So come tome, my Love...

659
01:41:04,147 --> 01:41:10,028
Let's make music together

660
01:41:42,686 --> 01:41:46,356
Let's make music together

661
01:42:48,752 --> 01:42:51,838
I knew they would
treat you this way.

662
01:42:52,505 --> 01:42:55,342
But how could I give
sight to your blind love?

663
01:42:56,593 --> 01:43:01,639
I had just one way
that you see for yourself.

664
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:04,684
The world has really gone places.

665
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,272
Wasn't it better that
everything happened so fast?

666
01:43:13,693 --> 01:43:18,239
Life comes in chapters.
One ends and the other begins.

667
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:29,751
- Where did you find this?
- Father had it.

668
01:43:31,127 --> 01:43:34,047
Whose card is this?

669
01:43:37,967 --> 01:43:40,387
We met this man in a stadium.

670
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:45,642
- You met him? What did he say?
- Nothing. He recognised me.

671
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:51,189
He came up to me and
asked if I was Tarababu.

672
01:43:53,608 --> 01:43:56,027
He had heard a lot of
my songs on the radio.

673
01:43:57,028 --> 01:44:00,490
- My photo had appeared
in the paper... - Last month?

674
01:44:01,116 --> 01:44:02,826
He had seen that.

675
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,787
He was praising me a lot.

676
01:44:06,204 --> 01:44:10,542
He asked me to come to
his studio at 11 on Monday.

677
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,295
- Then?
- I said I'd come.

678
01:44:14,671 --> 01:44:17,507
- But who goes!
- Brother!

679
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:20,635
Do you know who this man is?

680
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:26,558
For me, he's a thief.
Plagiarizing my song!

681
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:32,564
This is Vikrant Kapur.

682
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:36,609
The top star of huge
television industry.

683
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:41,740
Go and wear your clothes first.

684
01:44:42,657 --> 01:44:47,537
Such a big man invites you to his
studio and you want to go to Chamba!

685
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:54,336
You should go to his
studio at least once!

686
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:56,963
Who knows what door
fate might open for you!

687
01:48:07,237 --> 01:48:09,864
The truth is that Vikrant
has 4 eyes, not 2.

688
01:48:10,573 --> 01:48:12,742
Two in front, two at the back.

689
01:48:13,368 --> 01:48:16,621
That is how he sees everything.

690
01:48:17,455 --> 01:48:21,710
Go there. He must have seen you
with the rear eyes and called you.

691
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:26,506
Go ahead. Good luck.

692
01:48:35,557 --> 01:48:37,017
I'm Tarababu's cousin.

693
01:48:38,059 --> 01:48:41,688
I recognised him the
moment I set eyes on him.

694
01:48:43,565 --> 01:48:48,111
I compose my music myself.

695
01:48:49,612 --> 01:48:53,408
But in every corner of this
country is hidden folk talent...

696
01:48:53,658 --> 01:48:55,452
...which my company discovers.

697
01:48:56,828 --> 01:48:59,289
You sing your songs
for Jalandhar radio.

698
01:48:59,706 --> 01:49:01,041
But we hear them here.

699
01:49:01,624 --> 01:49:07,422
We record and remix them.

700
01:49:13,553 --> 01:49:18,475
By remix I mean you catch
a song composed by anyone.

701
01:49:19,934 --> 01:49:25,482
Or steal it. Then add 4
new instruments to it.

702
01:49:26,066 --> 01:49:30,403
Record and remix them
and lay your stake to it.

703
01:49:32,447 --> 01:49:35,950
Art is art whether
it be yours or others'.

704
01:49:36,576 --> 01:49:42,374
The Goddess of Wealth should
be with you. Tip-toes all the way.

705
01:49:47,295 --> 01:49:51,091
Sir Sad bud! How are you, sir?

706
01:49:51,591 --> 01:49:55,762
You're rarely seen! The papers
are full of news about you!

707
01:49:56,596 --> 01:49:58,390
Your name is embedded in my heart!

708
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:03,603
Sure you must meet me.
It is your studio, sir!

709
01:50:04,104 --> 01:50:06,815
Right now I'm
in a board meeting.

710
01:50:07,232 --> 01:50:09,067
Call me in half an hour.

711
01:50:20,412 --> 01:50:24,249
If this scoundrel calls up again,
tell him I'm not in the studio.

712
01:50:31,673 --> 01:50:34,718
You must be thinking
what a fraud I am!

713
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,597
But this is the
language of our business.

714
01:50:40,515 --> 01:50:45,520
We talk with love at our
enemies and fight with friends.

715
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:51,568
They are new so they don't
understand the tongue of Bombay.

716
01:50:52,944 --> 01:50:55,405
Don't you speak?

717
01:50:56,156 --> 01:50:59,409
What can I say?

718
01:51:01,745 --> 01:51:03,163
Say that again.

719
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:05,749
What can I say?

720
01:51:08,668 --> 01:51:11,046
What can I say?
What a phrase!

721
01:51:13,048 --> 01:51:15,342
Good voice too. Do you sing?

722
01:51:15,759 --> 01:51:19,888
She sings better than me.

723
01:51:21,222 --> 01:51:26,186
- And do you dance? - She's a
graduate in dance. And song.

724
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:32,525
I was right in thinking
and my guess was right.

725
01:51:38,907 --> 01:51:42,494
This is my friend, confidante,
secretary, manager, partner...

726
01:51:43,036 --> 01:51:45,497
And the main executor of
this company, Banerjee.

727
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:50,502
Sutarbhai has come from
Baroda for the charity show.

728
01:51:51,252 --> 01:51:53,672
I'll deal with him now.

729
01:51:58,093 --> 01:52:02,597
Tell him we're booked all year.
One show will cost 50 lakhs.

730
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:07,310
No charity. We'll work
only when he pays up.

731
01:52:13,858 --> 01:52:17,570
This charity business
is a fraud!

732
01:52:18,196 --> 01:52:21,366
They make money and ask
us artists for concessions!

733
01:52:22,492 --> 01:52:26,371
I have told him, Tarababu.
I'm a man of the 21st century.

734
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:29,833
Whether it's a marriage,
party or award function...

735
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,585
Pay up and I'll make music!

736
01:52:34,754 --> 01:52:38,675
We artists are priceless!

737
01:52:45,849 --> 01:52:49,853
I'm very happy to know
you respect artists so much.

738
01:52:50,603 --> 01:52:53,773
I wish to respect you
with all my heart.

739
01:52:55,066 --> 01:52:58,778
But honestly, emotional
people scare me a lot.

740
01:52:59,779 --> 01:53:03,450
You must first learn
to be practical.

741
01:53:03,908 --> 01:53:07,120
- That's what I tell them.
- For example, take...

742
01:53:08,204 --> 01:53:12,292
You've always remained poor
and will always remain poor.

743
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:18,131
You sang in the mountains and we
made remixes and earned millions!

744
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:24,929
Take a look. This contains
songs composed only by you!

745
01:53:33,938 --> 01:53:38,193
I'm trying to tell you,
join our company.

746
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,695
Write songs for us,
Mansi can sing...

747
01:53:41,112 --> 01:53:45,700
And be a model dancer in our shows.
Begin a new life. Simple.

748
01:53:52,374 --> 01:53:56,753
Give us 2 days to think.

749
01:53:57,337 --> 01:54:04,469
Sure, think it over. You may
reject our accept our company offer.

750
01:54:09,015 --> 01:54:11,142
Thinking like this won't help.

751
01:54:12,769 --> 01:54:14,771
You are a girl of the 21st century.

752
01:54:15,814 --> 01:54:18,775
Simpering away at home won't help.

753
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:23,738
You've seen what language
the men of today use.

754
01:54:25,281 --> 01:54:27,701
Think with your head.

755
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:32,038
What will you achieve
by returning to Chamba?

756
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:39,379
The burden of marrying 2 sisters?
A heavy with debt school of your Dad?

757
01:54:40,338 --> 01:54:43,299
How will you yourself live?

758
01:54:44,092 --> 01:54:45,802
How? How???

759
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,770
I have no idea of your past.

760
01:54:57,522 --> 01:55:03,069
But it's very essential for you to
experience pain, sorrow for success.

761
01:55:04,029 --> 01:55:06,531
You also seem to have
suffered quite a bit.

762
01:55:12,871 --> 01:55:16,916
I have suffered like the
hero of Hindi films...

763
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:19,961
...whose father left his
mother when he was a child.

764
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,091
My mother sewed and
got me an education.

765
01:55:26,009 --> 01:55:27,469
Taught me music.

766
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:31,431
And then she died.

767
01:55:34,809 --> 01:55:37,479
The same sad story.

768
01:55:39,647 --> 01:55:41,524
This is my mother.

769
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,653
She left behind some
principles of the 20th century.

770
01:55:49,115 --> 01:55:51,076
Principles of the 20th century.

771
01:55:52,327 --> 01:55:53,995
Sacrifice is supreme.

772
01:55:55,121 --> 01:55:59,501
Do good and forget about it.
Do your duty, don't expect rewards.

773
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:04,506
After completing BA, I worked
on these I deals for 5 years.

774
01:56:05,131 --> 01:56:09,552
What was the outcome? I
starved, had no food to eat.

775
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:13,932
I used to play this rattle.

776
01:56:14,474 --> 01:56:18,144
And Banerjee would take photographs.

777
01:56:19,187 --> 01:56:22,565
Then our life took a new turn.

778
01:56:23,566 --> 01:56:26,945
We met a man called Jaidev uncle.

779
01:56:27,862 --> 01:56:31,324
He gave us these 7 tenets
of the 21st century.

780
01:56:34,494 --> 01:56:38,206
He said Kapu,
change these old tenets.

781
01:56:38,581 --> 01:56:41,918
Change into a modern man.

782
01:56:43,253 --> 01:56:47,632
The first rule is love remains
healthy with give and take.

783
01:56:51,177 --> 01:56:54,597
First do good to yourself.

784
01:56:57,767 --> 01:57:00,228
All efforts are useless unless
backed with expectation of reward.

785
01:57:00,478 --> 01:57:04,816
What is the profit?
What is desire? What's the result?

786
01:57:05,734 --> 01:57:08,361
Shop dressing is more
important than honesty.

787
01:57:11,156 --> 01:57:13,575
Envy is essential to
win in any competition.

788
01:57:13,992 --> 01:57:17,537
Jealousy!

789
01:57:18,663 --> 01:57:24,836
Greed is necessary to become rich.

790
01:57:26,171 --> 01:57:30,842
Cut the others down to
size in order to be one up.

791
01:57:36,181 --> 01:57:38,892
I followed them for 7years and...

792
01:57:40,143 --> 01:57:42,854
...turned into Vikrant
Kapur from Kapu.

793
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:46,483
You mean you really
turned out to be practical.

794
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:50,987
This is Bombay.
Everything is a show.

795
01:57:51,613 --> 01:57:53,865
It's called showmanship.

796
01:57:54,699 --> 01:58:01,414
The decoration is publicity and
the dressing is marketing.

797
01:58:02,499 --> 01:58:05,877
Now you will see
where we take Mansi.

798
01:58:06,586 --> 01:58:09,214
Only if she clears the test.

799
01:58:10,548 --> 01:58:13,802
Tell her the company
contract rules.

800
01:58:14,678 --> 01:58:18,515
You have to give
a video test and sing.

801
01:58:19,724 --> 01:58:22,977
- What's the other condition?
- The other condition is...

802
01:58:23,395 --> 01:58:27,857
You can't get married
during this period.

803
01:58:28,525 --> 01:58:33,321
- Pardon...? - No marriage, no
friendship, nor love or romance.

804
01:58:36,324 --> 01:58:42,497
We sell pain not buy it.

805
01:58:47,919 --> 01:58:51,089
Manav, at least listen to
what Deepmohan is saying.

806
01:58:52,257 --> 01:58:57,637
He may say anything but
the staff told me everything.

807
01:58:58,555 --> 01:59:00,557
Shaku Aunt is at fault.

808
01:59:01,766 --> 01:59:04,185
And at issue is the
honour of the family.

809
01:59:05,103 --> 01:59:09,649
I see. So you will teach
us civilised behaviour!

810
01:59:11,026 --> 01:59:18,408
Absolutely. How should a wealthy
man behave with a poor man...

811
01:59:18,867 --> 01:59:21,036
You have to learn that.

812
01:59:24,247 --> 01:59:27,584
The Tarababu who was
treated as a king in Chamba...

813
01:59:28,585 --> 01:59:30,420
He was made to sit with the dogs.

814
01:59:31,588 --> 01:59:33,840
The one they said was
Saraswati incarnate...

815
01:59:34,132 --> 01:59:36,551
was called a slave of Laxmi?

816
01:59:39,846 --> 01:59:44,684
9 hours! For 9 hours, grandma
father and daughter sat in the sun.

817
01:59:46,019 --> 01:59:48,396
Somebody who was humiliated
in this manner...

818
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:51,691
What would he do if not
boil over with anger?

819
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,860
What is your point?

820
01:59:54,694 --> 01:59:56,780
In 2 days Daddy will
return from London.

821
01:59:58,698 --> 02:00:04,245
You will have to clearly tell Dad
of the way you behaved with them.

822
02:00:06,456 --> 02:00:08,083
What do we tell brother?

823
02:00:08,958 --> 02:00:12,170
Somebody slaps him and
he should quietly bear it!

824
02:00:51,418 --> 02:00:56,631
If breaking a glass or raising
your voice proves the truth...

825
02:00:58,925 --> 02:01:00,552
Then I have broken 7 glasses.

826
02:01:02,429 --> 02:01:05,140
That implies my truth is 7
times stronger than yours.

827
02:01:08,601 --> 02:01:11,062
I'll explain the real truth.

828
02:01:12,397 --> 02:01:16,401
When a 21 year old boy
gets blinded by love...

829
02:01:17,736 --> 02:01:20,155
this is just the way he behaves.

830
02:01:21,823 --> 02:01:26,703
Then he wants to change not just
his but the fate of the family.

831
02:01:27,454 --> 02:01:32,667
We won't let you change
the fate of the entire family.

832
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:37,672
Fate has changed.

833
02:01:44,012 --> 02:01:46,097
Your Manav now belongs to another.

834
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:50,185
Take a look if you'd like.
This is Manav's Mansi.

835
02:01:56,483 --> 02:01:58,068
She will be the
daughter-in-law of this family.

836
02:02:00,653 --> 02:02:05,950
And someday all of you'll be taking
a family photograph around her.

837
02:02:08,161 --> 02:02:09,829
That's my promise to you.

838
02:02:12,832 --> 02:02:14,334
To you.
You and you.

839
02:02:24,094 --> 02:02:25,553
Grandma, may I leave?

840
02:02:43,613 --> 02:02:48,451
Oh beloved...

841
02:02:52,372 --> 02:02:57,210
I understand it now...
I understand the feeling

842
02:03:08,722 --> 02:03:14,102
You were confused earlier;
your predicament is now solved

843
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:38,877
She's got something. She's good.

844
02:03:39,794 --> 02:03:42,505
Yes, sign the contract.

845
02:03:53,224 --> 02:03:57,437
Hey man! Man, I'm talking to you.

846
02:03:57,687 --> 02:04:01,691
You are in front of my heroine.
Please move away. You...

847
02:04:03,234 --> 02:04:05,236
Slightly loose nut.

848
02:04:08,031 --> 02:04:11,409
Mister, we're working.

849
02:04:12,285 --> 02:04:15,121
Please stand behind the public.

850
02:04:16,456 --> 02:04:19,250
Look, I must meet Mansi.

851
02:04:19,918 --> 02:04:22,420
Do you know her?

852
02:04:24,339 --> 02:04:26,049
Yes, very closely.

853
02:04:27,384 --> 02:04:28,843
How is she related to you?

854
02:04:30,804 --> 02:04:31,971
Beloved.

855
02:04:35,183 --> 02:04:36,351
Pardon?

856
02:04:47,696 --> 02:04:50,407
Just a minute.

857
02:04:58,289 --> 02:05:03,920
Do you see that boy? He says he wants
to meet you. You're his beloved.

858
02:05:06,256 --> 02:05:10,427
No sir. Neither am I anyone's
beloved nor do I want to see him.

859
02:05:12,095 --> 02:05:14,347
- Shall I tell him that?
- Yes sir.

860
02:05:21,229 --> 02:05:26,693
Brother, she says she
neither wants to meet you...

861
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:30,196
Nor does she know you
nor is she your beloved.

862
02:05:36,244 --> 02:05:37,454
I have to meet her.

863
02:05:42,917 --> 02:05:46,838
Meet her after the shooting.
I'm acting like a gentleman.

864
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:51,134
You too act like one.
Please go there.

865
02:05:52,469 --> 02:05:55,638
Let us work. Please.

866
02:06:17,077 --> 02:06:18,286
Mansi, stop.

867
02:06:26,961 --> 02:06:28,838
I can guess your sorrow.

868
02:06:33,009 --> 02:06:34,469
I have made a mistake.

869
02:06:41,726 --> 02:06:45,480
I respect you even more
after finding out the truth.

870
02:06:47,065 --> 02:06:48,733
Do you know why?

871
02:06:49,651 --> 02:06:58,743
Because a girl who holds the honour
of her parents higher than her love...

872
02:06:59,202 --> 02:07:01,496
Sacrifices her love
for their honour...

873
02:07:02,664 --> 02:07:05,083
Only that girl can be
the wealth of a family.

874
02:07:06,543 --> 02:07:08,670
She can be a good wife to a man.

875
02:07:10,547 --> 02:07:12,048
I've come to apologise to you.

876
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:18,096
Your father should
apologise to my father!

877
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:25,603
Because he slapped him?
No, that was wrong.

878
02:07:26,896 --> 02:07:28,314
Absolutely wrong.

879
02:07:29,524 --> 02:07:33,319
I respect my father
just as you respect yours.

880
02:07:37,157 --> 02:07:38,825
The job is done!

881
02:07:39,325 --> 02:07:41,870
Vikrant says the contract
will be signed today.

882
02:07:42,203 --> 02:07:46,916
Today is an auspicious day. I've
read the contract. Just sign it.

883
02:07:51,588 --> 02:07:55,508
You are Vikrant's heroine
for three years from today.

884
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:00,138
Sign here.

885
02:08:25,997 --> 02:08:27,916
You threw these in my house.

886
02:08:30,377 --> 02:08:32,879
I'll string them into
a necklace once again.

887
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:36,800
And you will have to wear it.

888
02:08:49,062 --> 02:08:53,274
If God resides in me,
I am honest...

889
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:00,782
You yourself will come
running into my arms someday.

890
02:09:04,119 --> 02:09:05,328
You...

891
02:09:07,956 --> 02:09:09,499
On your own.

892
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:30,895
- So, met her?
- Yes.

893
02:09:32,063 --> 02:09:33,231
Decision taken?

894
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:36,067
- Yes.
- What?

895
02:09:38,528 --> 02:09:40,989
She signed you on and resigned me.

896
02:09:42,824 --> 02:09:44,325
She turned you down?

897
02:09:45,827 --> 02:09:47,328
Yes, she turned me down.

898
02:09:51,624 --> 02:09:56,087
Look friend, I don't know your
story but I do know this...

899
02:09:57,630 --> 02:10:02,927
The girls and boys who enter the
world of stardom hang in the sky.

900
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,184
They never come down to earth.

901
02:10:13,021 --> 02:10:15,440
You probably don't know the girl.

902
02:10:16,775 --> 02:10:21,363
She will come and to me alone.

903
02:10:22,739 --> 02:10:28,244
And you will send her to me.

904
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,916
- Me...?
- Yes, you.

905
02:10:39,297 --> 02:10:43,051
You will send her
as a businessman.

906
02:10:44,386 --> 02:10:48,890
One thing is sure,
I love your self-confidence.

907
02:11:31,558 --> 02:11:35,228
Is what you said to Deep true?

908
02:11:37,397 --> 02:11:38,982
Absolutely true.

909
02:11:40,692 --> 02:11:44,696
These people humiliated
Tarababu and Mansi.

910
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:49,826
That was wrong. That is
why he humiliated you.

911
02:11:51,578 --> 02:11:55,457
That too was wrong.
But... it is also true...

912
02:11:58,126 --> 02:11:59,294
Yes, carry on.

913
02:12:01,629 --> 02:12:03,131
I love Mansi.

914
02:12:05,383 --> 02:12:07,218
I've promised to marry her.

915
02:12:14,142 --> 02:12:15,643
What will you do now?

916
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:20,940
Will you leave home?
Call us names?

917
02:12:23,651 --> 02:12:27,280
No. No... that will never happen.

918
02:12:29,157 --> 02:12:32,410
Something that sullies
your family or your name...

919
02:12:34,954 --> 02:12:36,581
I will never do that.

920
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:39,876
No scenes, no pettiness.

921
02:12:44,214 --> 02:12:49,135
I will neither leave you
nor elope and marry Mansi.

922
02:12:52,972 --> 02:12:54,391
That is my promise to you.

923
02:12:59,229 --> 02:13:04,150
If I refuse to let you
marry Mansi...?

924
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:10,031
You won't do that.

925
02:13:17,163 --> 02:13:21,126
The love of Mansi and me
bloomed under your web.

926
02:13:22,502 --> 02:13:23,670
It grew.

927
02:13:26,214 --> 02:13:30,927
The only difference is that you
loved Tarababu like a businessman...

928
02:13:31,928 --> 02:13:36,099
And I loved Mansi like a man.
Like a human being.

929
02:13:37,851 --> 02:13:39,227
This won't happen.

930
02:13:41,062 --> 02:13:44,983
Mansi will not come
to this house.

931
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:49,237
No...

932
02:13:53,575 --> 02:13:57,287
All right.
If my love is not true...

933
02:13:58,496 --> 02:14:01,082
She will never come.

934
02:14:05,045 --> 02:14:09,549
But if God resides in my heart...

935
02:14:10,592 --> 02:14:15,513
If I am honest...
If my love is true...

936
02:14:17,432 --> 02:14:19,726
You yourself will bring
Mansi to this house.

937
02:14:23,146 --> 02:14:24,314
You...

938
02:14:34,824 --> 02:14:38,495
Not anymore...

939
02:14:46,086 --> 02:14:51,007
No, not anymore, my Love...

940
02:15:03,728 --> 02:15:08,566
I can't take it no more

941
02:15:16,157 --> 02:15:19,828
The nightingale sings
in the forests...

942
02:15:53,695 --> 02:15:56,156
A fire breaks out...
I don't care

943
02:15:57,032 --> 02:15:59,492
A snake bites me...
I wouldn't care

944
02:15:59,909 --> 02:16:02,620
Even if the skies fall...
I wouldn't care

945
02:16:03,329 --> 02:16:05,749
I wouldn't care if
any calamity happened

946
02:16:06,332 --> 02:16:11,379
But I'd never be able to bear
the pain of my broken-heart

947
02:16:44,996 --> 02:16:50,794
Come now, my beloved

948
02:16:58,051 --> 02:17:03,765
Do come now, my beloved

949
02:17:47,684 --> 02:17:52,605
The heart sees
no reason

950
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:02,615
Every moment passes by...

951
02:18:02,782 --> 02:18:05,952
but the heartache remains

952
02:18:06,536 --> 02:18:12,208
Even if he has forgotten everything,
I do remember so much

953
02:18:12,834 --> 02:18:18,465
The plant that the vines engulf,
withers away

954
02:18:19,132 --> 02:18:24,721
Where it hoped for roses...
it is left with thorns

955
02:18:25,638 --> 02:18:31,436
No medicine, no prayer can
ever save you from love

956
02:19:21,152 --> 02:19:25,281
Love is unfaithful

957
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:31,538
Without it, however,
you are lonely

958
02:19:32,956 --> 02:19:39,045
Do not give your heart, they advise;
and they give their hearts away

959
02:19:39,587 --> 02:19:45,301
They steal your sleep;
and keep you awake all nights

960
02:19:46,219 --> 02:19:51,558
Happiness and cheer,
they are for someone else

961
02:19:52,308 --> 02:19:57,814
No promise, no effort
works then

962
02:19:58,732 --> 02:20:03,653
This is one of the
worst afflictions

963
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:33,993
An extra-ordinary story of special
success of an extra-ordinary girl.

964
02:21:34,285 --> 02:21:41,042
...Of Mansi Shankar, whom you
will meet at the MTV party tonight.

965
02:21:47,882 --> 02:21:53,513
We're here in search of a star.
The search ends right here.

966
02:21:58,977 --> 02:22:04,315
The day I saw Mansi, in 5
minutes I had understood...

967
02:22:05,233 --> 02:22:07,652
She will be the greatest
star of the world!

968
02:22:17,203 --> 02:22:24,294
I watched MTV but never dreamt my
song would be on top of its' charts.

969
02:22:24,753 --> 02:22:26,421
Then what did you dream about?

970
02:22:29,007 --> 02:22:30,592
That was another dream.

971
02:22:54,949 --> 02:22:56,743
MTV has given us this honour today.

972
02:23:00,038 --> 02:23:02,999
Twice the amount of blood
is pumping through my veins!

973
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:07,921
Manav is here.

974
02:23:18,848 --> 02:23:22,769
Now six times the amount of
blood is flowing in my veins!

975
02:23:27,857 --> 02:23:30,318
Brother...

976
02:23:32,362 --> 02:23:34,698
- You and here?
- Yes, I'm here.

977
02:23:36,032 --> 02:23:39,953
- How come?
- I came just as you came.

978
02:23:41,663 --> 02:23:43,665
Are you too a Ken star winner?

979
02:23:45,041 --> 02:23:47,210
Not yet but maybe I'll be lucky.

980
02:23:47,919 --> 02:23:49,796
May I talk to you for a minute?

981
02:23:54,175 --> 02:23:57,429
Frankly pal, I like you a lot.

982
02:23:57,929 --> 02:24:00,515
I too am fond of you.

983
02:24:05,103 --> 02:24:08,189
But Your Highness, Your Majesty...

984
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:12,861
MTV has thrown such a
grand party in our honour.

985
02:24:14,195 --> 02:24:18,158
And you landed up again to
ruin it in the form of a lover!

986
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:20,368
Do you like this?

987
02:24:21,786 --> 02:24:24,956
Not a form of lover.
I am a lover.

988
02:24:28,626 --> 02:24:31,671
- Whose lover?
- Hers.

989
02:24:38,595 --> 02:24:40,722
Look, this is a business party.

990
02:24:41,765 --> 02:24:44,184
It's the first day of her success.

991
02:24:44,976 --> 02:24:46,519
That is why I have come.

992
02:24:49,272 --> 02:24:52,942
Like a gentleman I request
you to sneak away from here.

993
02:24:58,615 --> 02:25:02,535
I told you Mansi belongs to me
and I belong to Mansi.

994
02:25:03,036 --> 02:25:04,204
That is why I have come.

995
02:25:04,871 --> 02:25:08,792
But she refuses
to acknowledge you.

996
02:25:09,918 --> 02:25:13,672
Sir, she's in a temper!
You do fight in love.

997
02:25:18,093 --> 02:25:22,806
So you are fully convinced
that she will return to you?

998
02:25:26,559 --> 02:25:28,937
Yes and you will send her to me.

999
02:25:34,901 --> 02:25:38,029
He is crazy.
Show him the way out.

1000
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:49,290
Tonight is for Mansi Shankar!

1001
02:25:54,546 --> 02:25:57,507
And the Chief Guest tonight is...

1002
02:26:30,832 --> 02:26:34,878
The only son of the Chairman
of Mehta and Mehta Company.

1003
02:26:35,086 --> 02:26:39,382
He won the maximum awards
in his college in London.

1004
02:26:58,693 --> 02:27:01,571
The MTV guys invited him
here as Chief Guest.

1005
02:27:02,489 --> 02:27:04,032
Where are the drinks?

1006
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:17,379
You don't want to be this.

1007
02:27:19,255 --> 02:27:20,715
You are Manavsi.

1008
02:27:25,512 --> 02:27:29,974
Say it. Say, you don't love me.

1009
02:27:37,065 --> 02:27:38,650
No.

1010
02:27:42,529 --> 02:27:44,531
But don't live this false life.

1011
02:27:48,910 --> 02:27:50,078
Shall I leave?

1012
02:27:52,956 --> 02:27:54,541
I'll wait for you.

1013
02:28:15,979 --> 02:28:19,482
Now my blood is flowing 12
times faster!

1014
02:28:29,743 --> 02:28:31,661
Take a meter reading.

1015
02:28:34,414 --> 02:28:39,502
- Your beloved was saying...
- I don't want to hear it.

1016
02:28:57,270 --> 02:29:00,523
Whatever it be, he has class.

1017
02:29:15,038 --> 02:29:20,919
I met Prabha. She
told me all about Manav.

1018
02:29:22,545 --> 02:29:24,464
You should make friends
with him.

1019
02:29:25,548 --> 02:29:30,387
What's the harm in it? Parents
are always the villains in love.

1020
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:33,098
He's in love with you.

1021
02:29:36,309 --> 02:29:38,353
Enough! Stop it!

1022
02:29:39,354 --> 02:29:42,273
It's very important that
I remind you at this point...

1023
02:29:43,566 --> 02:29:48,530
According to your company contract,
no artist of your company...

1024
02:29:49,531 --> 02:29:53,535
...has the right to make friends,
fall in love or get married!

1025
02:29:55,078 --> 02:30:01,835
You are raising obstacles in my
work and career with your talk!

1026
02:30:03,878 --> 02:30:05,797
I don't like working like this!

1027
02:30:07,048 --> 02:30:10,760
I don't want to work here!
I don't want to work!

1028
02:30:26,401 --> 02:30:29,696
She's a wounded lioness.
Why do you trouble her?

1029
02:30:33,158 --> 02:30:36,911
In today's world you find arrogant
girls not self respecting ones.

1030
02:30:47,213 --> 02:30:48,882
Please give the phone to Mansi.

1031
02:30:53,053 --> 02:30:56,014
There's a call for you.

1032
02:30:57,140 --> 02:30:58,892
From Vikrant's studio.

1033
02:31:03,063 --> 02:31:05,440
Tell him I don't want to work.

1034
02:31:13,073 --> 02:31:15,700
I don't understand what you mean.

1035
02:31:16,576 --> 02:31:21,790
Our company is launching a
new type of bra. Like this.

1036
02:31:22,832 --> 02:31:26,002
And you want a beautiful model
for the advertisement of this bra.

1037
02:31:26,503 --> 02:31:27,962
That too from my company.

1038
02:31:28,505 --> 02:31:33,093
- Yes.
- And you only want Mansi.

1039
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:37,722
- Yes. - Hoardings will be
put up all over the city.

1040
02:31:38,556 --> 02:31:39,724
Right.

1041
02:31:43,561 --> 02:31:50,568
We can pay you any price you demand.
A crore... what ever you say.

1042
02:31:52,946 --> 02:31:57,742
Do you know that
Mansi is a singer?

1043
02:31:58,535 --> 02:32:01,830
- Yes.
- And she's a dancer.

1044
02:32:02,914 --> 02:32:06,918
- Yes.
- She's an artist. A star.

1045
02:32:09,004 --> 02:32:12,340
Today stars stand nude for money.

1046
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:17,971
That is right.
And the money is good.

1047
02:32:20,765 --> 02:32:22,308
You are such a fool!

1048
02:32:22,851 --> 02:32:24,894
You get such foolish clients.

1049
02:32:25,562 --> 02:32:28,189
They don't realise Mansi
comes from a good family.

1050
02:32:28,565 --> 02:32:30,483
She won't do this kind
of modelling.

1051
02:32:31,651 --> 02:32:34,070
Either you're a fool
or they are.

1052
02:32:39,909 --> 02:32:42,954
These days girls from good
background do model like this.

1053
02:32:44,914 --> 02:32:47,459
Then my advice to you is...

1054
02:32:48,293 --> 02:32:52,297
A model better than Mansi
is sitting right next to you.

1055
02:32:53,465 --> 02:32:54,466
What?

1056
02:32:56,676 --> 02:32:59,721
She's beautiful. And healthy.

1057
02:33:00,305 --> 02:33:01,598
An English madam!

1058
02:33:04,559 --> 02:33:08,146
- Mehta and Mehta company...
- I know.

1059
02:33:09,189 --> 02:33:12,901
If they belong to good families
let them learn to respect others.

1060
02:33:14,152 --> 02:33:16,154
You deal with these vile people.
I have enough of work.

1061
02:33:20,492 --> 02:33:23,244
We sell art not
the honour of girls.

1062
02:33:34,881 --> 02:33:38,468
I don't think you have
the sense to judge men.

1063
02:33:39,803 --> 02:33:42,430
The wrong is right in your
eyes and the right is wrong.

1064
02:33:54,818 --> 02:33:57,779
Tarababu composed the song
and sent it through Shaukat.

1065
02:33:59,447 --> 02:34:03,618
- Why didn't he come?
- He's not well.

1066
02:34:05,537 --> 02:34:08,415
- And Mansi...?
- She refused to come.

1067
02:34:11,042 --> 02:34:12,961
I called her6 times in 4 days!

1068
02:34:14,337 --> 02:34:19,592
And she doesn't want to come!
You are such a fool!

1069
02:34:21,094 --> 02:34:24,472
You are my enemy!
You love to humiliate me!

1070
02:34:24,764 --> 02:34:30,311
- What have I done?
- Why did you call her 6 times?

1071
02:34:32,564 --> 02:34:34,566
Don't you know what
Vikrant Kapur is?

1072
02:34:38,111 --> 02:34:40,697
Many girls like her came and went.

1073
02:34:42,574 --> 02:34:46,953
Just because I smiled at her,
she thinks she is Miss World!

1074
02:34:47,579 --> 02:34:49,914
She thinks she is a star!

1075
02:34:50,623 --> 02:34:54,586
Tell Tarababu I don't
want his song!

1076
02:35:09,434 --> 02:35:11,019
So you are hurt?

1077
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:17,525
Who can hurt me? Who?

1078
02:35:18,485 --> 02:35:21,029
I am a tough man! Tough!

1079
02:35:22,238 --> 02:35:25,116
Yet he doesn't' appear
as tough today, isn't it?

1080
02:35:27,118 --> 02:35:31,623
- Where do you find me weak?
- From here. Your heart.

1081
02:35:32,165 --> 02:35:35,418
- What about the heart?
- Weak in the heart.

1082
02:35:36,419 --> 02:35:39,381
For the first time you
speak from the heart.

1083
02:35:40,674 --> 02:35:44,135
Don't you really miss her?

1084
02:35:44,886 --> 02:35:48,640
- Don't bore me. Go away.
- What's the harm I being honest?

1085
02:35:55,188 --> 02:35:56,940
You are missing her.

1086
02:36:12,997 --> 02:36:14,624
What happened?

1087
02:36:15,083 --> 02:36:17,252
What shouldn't have happened.

1088
02:36:18,169 --> 02:36:21,756
- Love?
- No, hatred.

1089
02:36:22,424 --> 02:36:25,176
- Hatred?
- You mean no song today?

1090
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:30,557
Today's session...

1091
02:36:45,572 --> 02:36:47,032
I am... Mansi.

1092
02:36:57,125 --> 02:36:58,710
What you did wasn't right.

1093
02:37:02,464 --> 02:37:03,798
I'll come back tomorrow.

1094
02:37:18,813 --> 02:37:23,735
I do not know
what occurred tome

1095
02:37:25,695 --> 02:37:29,991
I drank in the name of love

1096
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:37,540
I lived it up...
I drank in the name of love

1097
02:37:55,975 --> 02:38:00,063
O devotee of love...

1098
02:38:12,242 --> 02:38:16,371
I drank in the name of love

1099
02:38:21,042 --> 02:38:24,713
In a moment, I lived
through centuries

1100
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:42,230
I drank in the name of love

1101
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:45,984
In a moment,
I lived through centuries

1102
02:38:46,609 --> 02:38:50,155
I drank every drop
there was...

1103
02:38:51,072 --> 02:38:54,743
In a moment, I lived
through centuries

1104
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:59,748
I drank, oh yes, I drank
in the name of love

1105
02:39:08,590 --> 02:39:13,970
A devotee of love,
you are...

1106
02:39:17,307 --> 02:39:22,312
A swaying devotee,
you are...

1107
02:39:32,197 --> 02:39:35,241
You have drunk in
the name of love...

1108
02:39:36,159 --> 02:39:39,829
What was it that
occurred to you?

1109
02:39:43,166 --> 02:39:46,503
You have drunk
in the name of love

1110
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:50,256
What was it that
occurred to you...?

1111
02:39:51,174 --> 02:39:59,057
I have drank all there was;
I've lived centuries in a moment

1112
02:40:53,737 --> 02:40:57,490
What have you under taken
this ritual for?

1113
02:40:57,741 --> 02:41:01,244
What have you invited
this affliction for...?

1114
02:41:11,004 --> 02:41:17,927
I saw this woman somewhere...
and waves whipped up a frenzy

1115
02:41:32,275 --> 02:41:35,028
My heart went out to her...

1116
02:42:47,225 --> 02:42:53,314
I renounced the world...
when the feeling over came me

1117
02:42:55,275 --> 02:42:59,571
I renounced the world
when I fell in love

1118
02:42:59,779 --> 02:43:08,329
He didn't get to know;
my scars remained on my heart

1119
02:43:12,792 --> 02:43:20,884
Not once did I cry out in pain;
so what is it that occurred to you?

1120
02:43:21,593 --> 02:43:25,263
I drank all there was

1121
02:43:25,972 --> 02:43:29,642
In a moment, I lived
through many centuries

1122
02:44:21,361 --> 02:44:25,156
Manav left this house and has gone
to stay in father's cottage across.

1123
02:44:25,448 --> 02:44:31,287
That's fine. Grandpa's cottage
will now be a lover's cottage.

1124
02:44:41,798 --> 02:44:44,134
What do you want to say?

1125
02:44:45,468 --> 02:44:47,887
Vikrant likes Mansi.

1126
02:44:48,888 --> 02:44:51,850
He has sent these
bangles through Banerjee.

1127
02:44:53,727 --> 02:44:58,732
- Meaning? - Meaning?
He's asking for Mansi's hand!

1128
02:44:59,733 --> 02:45:01,901
- But...
- No buts!

1129
02:45:02,652 --> 02:45:05,989
You don't find such boys!
I mean like Vikrant!

1130
02:45:06,781 --> 02:45:10,702
- But... - Vikrant is
a villager at heart.

1131
02:45:11,161 --> 02:45:14,748
Like us. Mansi will
be happy with him.

1132
02:45:15,415 --> 02:45:18,501
I can guarantee that
he will love her a lot.

1133
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:22,630
- But this hurry...
- Finally it's your wish!

1134
02:45:23,548 --> 02:45:26,176
If you want to keep
her home, do so!

1135
02:45:27,552 --> 02:45:30,347
Kick good fortune in the face!

1136
02:45:31,806 --> 02:45:37,437
Think of Mansi. Once she's married,
she'll forget her sorrow.

1137
02:45:40,231 --> 02:45:41,733
What are you saying?

1138
02:45:42,817 --> 02:45:47,238
I once gave you the right
to decide your fate.

1139
02:45:48,239 --> 02:45:53,703
Didn't I? This time
you have to give in to me.

1140
02:45:56,247 --> 02:45:59,292
Lord Shiva gave you success not me.

1141
02:46:01,586 --> 02:46:07,509
A father's success is finding
a suitable groom for his child.

1142
02:46:11,262 --> 02:46:18,645
Look my dear... who knows
when life will cheat on you.

1143
02:46:20,313 --> 02:46:26,403
Before I die I want to see
you married to a good boy.

1144
02:46:29,197 --> 02:46:32,826
Don't... don't turn me down.

1145
02:46:33,576 --> 02:46:35,328
I hold you by oath.

1146
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:44,004
Yes, I sent this proposal
through Banerjee.

1147
02:46:45,714 --> 02:46:50,802
Will you really be able to love me?

1148
02:47:17,704 --> 02:47:23,126
Do you know some people fall
in love and get married?

1149
02:47:24,461 --> 02:47:27,881
And some get married
and fall in love.

1150
02:48:05,335 --> 02:48:11,383
Away from my heart,
which path has she taken?

1151
02:48:19,099 --> 02:48:30,193
Every path leads
to my heart

1152
02:49:08,106 --> 02:49:10,900
Not before me...

1153
02:49:15,405 --> 02:49:17,782
You are not here, before me...

1154
02:49:17,949 --> 02:49:20,910
but that's a different story

1155
02:49:28,793 --> 02:49:34,049
With me, however...

1156
02:49:35,467 --> 02:49:40,305
you are with me

1157
02:51:18,194 --> 02:51:23,825
You are away from me;
yet, you are not separated

1158
02:51:25,326 --> 02:51:30,498
You are angry with me...
but you are not unfaithful

1159
02:51:45,221 --> 02:51:51,811
It's your hand
I hold in mine

1160
02:51:52,729 --> 02:51:59,319
It's only in my hands
that your hand is

1161
02:52:02,197 --> 02:52:06,826
You are with me. Always

1162
02:52:44,572 --> 02:52:48,618
Fortunate are those that die
at the hands of their beloved.

1163
02:52:49,411 --> 02:52:50,578
You seem very happy.

1164
02:52:52,747 --> 02:52:55,875
Sanjay Prabhu from India's top
company BPL just called me.

1165
02:52:56,876 --> 02:53:02,424
He says they want to
send us to Canada.

1166
02:53:02,924 --> 02:53:05,260
For MTV International Awards.

1167
02:53:07,846 --> 02:53:10,265
You've brought me so much of luck!

1168
02:53:27,157 --> 02:53:28,241
It's caught fire?

1169
02:53:54,559 --> 02:53:56,519
- You can't go there!
- My cottage is on fire!

1170
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:58,688
- Can't you see?
- I said, you can't go!

1171
02:54:02,317 --> 02:54:04,110
No, son. You can't go ahead.

1172
02:54:04,569 --> 02:54:08,990
- But my belongings...
- Son of Romeo! You can't go!

1173
02:54:19,501 --> 02:54:23,254
That's my cottage. I have
very precious things in there.

1174
02:54:23,505 --> 02:54:28,218
- Forget this! And come with me.
- But we're told to put this out.

1175
02:54:29,552 --> 02:54:30,970
To Hell with your cottage!

1176
02:54:31,262 --> 02:54:35,308
First we have to save the goods
worth millions lying in the go down.

1177
02:54:38,311 --> 02:54:39,479
Carry on with your work.

1178
02:56:34,219 --> 02:56:35,845
I'm absolutely fine.

1179
02:56:36,262 --> 02:56:42,352
I burnt my hand a little.
The rest is safe.

1180
02:56:43,436 --> 02:56:48,858
I had no Idea that the fire
would be flaming inside.

1181
02:56:50,151 --> 02:56:52,570
Everybody else was trying
to save the go down.

1182
02:56:54,447 --> 02:56:56,366
But I too had some precious things.

1183
02:56:57,242 --> 02:57:00,954
My violin, the digital
camera you gave me.

1184
02:57:01,830 --> 02:57:03,206
My computer.

1185
02:57:13,299 --> 02:57:16,261
Doctor Dilip said
I can go home tomorrow.

1186
02:57:18,304 --> 02:57:19,764
I can play tennis.

1187
02:57:20,890 --> 02:57:23,101
I'll play tennis with you.

1188
02:57:23,518 --> 02:57:25,687
I haven't played tennis
with you for many days.

1189
02:57:46,082 --> 02:57:48,501
One who is not accustomed
to lying...

1190
02:57:50,587 --> 02:57:53,131
He should never lie.

1191
02:58:09,022 --> 02:58:10,815
I am your father.

1192
02:58:32,420 --> 02:58:33,088
What is it?

1193
02:58:33,296 --> 02:58:36,174
You can't enter without
signing the security register.

1194
02:58:36,383 --> 02:58:39,427
I will go in!
You can't stop me.

1195
02:58:43,890 --> 02:58:45,892
He came in without telling us...

1196
02:58:46,142 --> 02:58:48,061
He didn't even sign
the register...

1197
02:58:52,232 --> 02:58:53,817
He says he's your friend.

1198
02:58:58,279 --> 02:59:00,782
You may go, Gopal.

1199
02:59:01,908 --> 02:59:04,411
He is our guest.

1200
02:59:12,669 --> 02:59:15,964
Welcome, Jagmohan.

1201
02:59:18,550 --> 02:59:23,888
Chhaya, get something
cold for our guest.

1202
02:59:35,150 --> 02:59:39,404
Today is the day we
worship Mother Saraswati.

1203
02:59:42,323 --> 02:59:45,577
You do know Mother Saraswati?

1204
02:59:47,787 --> 02:59:49,748
Don't embarrass me.

1205
02:59:54,836 --> 02:59:56,588
I have come to
apologise for my mistake.

1206
02:59:59,424 --> 03:00:01,384
I've come to ask
for my son's life.

1207
03:00:03,887 --> 03:00:13,813
- I come to ask for Mansi's hand...
- Don't say it!

1208
03:00:15,023 --> 03:00:16,566
Don't say it!

1209
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:22,655
When I had come to your door
to plead for my daughter's life...

1210
03:00:24,783 --> 03:00:27,243
No... no. No.

1211
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:34,501
How would you know how hurt my
child was by your behaviour?

1212
03:00:37,128 --> 03:00:39,464
How many nights she has cried!

1213
03:00:40,215 --> 03:00:41,883
How many nights!

1214
03:00:42,842 --> 03:00:44,052
And now...

1215
03:00:49,933 --> 03:00:52,102
Now she belongs to somebody else.

1216
03:00:55,146 --> 03:00:57,399
- Don't say that.
- It is the truth!

1217
03:00:58,316 --> 03:00:59,901
This is the truth, Jagmohan!

1218
03:01:00,944 --> 03:01:04,155
She has gone to Canada
with Vikrant Kapur.

1219
03:01:05,031 --> 03:01:07,617
And they will get married
when they return next week.

1220
03:01:26,261 --> 03:01:30,932
Such a huge stadium!
Thousands of people!

1221
03:01:31,433 --> 03:01:33,685
Singers from all countries
have come, Mansi!

1222
03:01:34,894 --> 03:01:37,647
Such a tough competition!
What will happen?

1223
03:01:38,690 --> 03:01:43,945
It'll be fun. Vikrant is confident
that you'll win the first prize.

1224
03:01:45,989 --> 03:01:48,199
- Yes?
- Did you read Manav Mehta's news?

1225
03:01:49,159 --> 03:01:51,953
Are you sorry?

1226
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:55,248
Go and do your job.

1227
03:01:57,292 --> 03:02:00,420
The wealthiest man of
London, Jagmohan's son...

1228
03:02:01,338 --> 03:02:06,593
...jumped into a raging fire to
save a scarf given by his beloved.

1229
03:02:07,844 --> 03:02:10,430
Nobody knows who the beloved is.

1230
03:02:10,847 --> 03:02:12,932
Why are you telling me
this news repeatedly?

1231
03:02:14,017 --> 03:02:16,144
Read it in the paper!

1232
03:02:16,436 --> 03:02:19,981
I don't' want to see.
You know I'm engaged.

1233
03:02:21,566 --> 03:02:23,777
Has the engagement
finished everything?

1234
03:02:24,944 --> 03:02:30,325
Manav risked his life and
you don't have a tear for him!

1235
03:02:32,994 --> 03:02:36,331
This world has turned you to stone.

1236
03:02:38,917 --> 03:02:40,418
Can't you make him one call?

1237
03:02:45,507 --> 03:02:47,759
He has really loved you.

1238
03:02:48,927 --> 03:02:51,221
Ila, Shannu, come on.
Vikrant has called you.

1239
03:03:35,473 --> 03:03:37,976
My love, may I
appear in front of you?

1240
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:41,563
Just a minute. Please.

1241
03:03:51,489 --> 03:03:53,825
You're not ready?

1242
03:03:54,325 --> 03:03:56,619
The entire orchestra is waiting.

1243
03:03:59,039 --> 03:04:00,498
Shaukat, hurry up!

1244
03:04:01,833 --> 03:04:03,293
You were crying, isn't it?

1245
03:04:05,086 --> 03:04:06,588
You were crying, isn't it?

1246
03:04:12,427 --> 03:04:14,304
Missing him...?

1247
03:04:20,560 --> 03:04:22,062
I know you love me.

1248
03:04:36,910 --> 03:04:38,995
Brighten up with a Coke.

1249
03:04:58,181 --> 03:05:00,433
Love grows with this.

1250
03:05:01,976 --> 03:05:06,356
Drink this. Coke is our
company sponsor. Drink it.

1251
03:05:08,233 --> 03:05:09,651
Drink it.

1252
03:05:11,361 --> 03:05:12,529
Look...

1253
03:05:15,156 --> 03:05:17,867
We have to win this
world competition.

1254
03:05:19,411 --> 03:05:23,164
The person who sings with
his heart and soul will win.

1255
03:05:24,499 --> 03:05:26,292
You just concentrate on the song.

1256
03:05:29,504 --> 03:05:31,214
Excuse me...

1257
03:05:34,217 --> 03:05:39,139
Can I sing a song from our
village in today's show?

1258
03:05:41,683 --> 03:05:46,438
Village song? But we're
all ready with the orchestra.

1259
03:05:47,022 --> 03:05:48,857
Another song now?

1260
03:05:50,775 --> 03:05:58,241
You just said the one who sings
with his heart and soul will win.

1261
03:06:12,088 --> 03:06:14,507
Mansi will sing a new song.

1262
03:06:15,133 --> 03:06:17,635
With all her heart and soul.

1263
03:06:24,601 --> 03:06:33,276
Promises I made in love...

1264
03:06:38,907 --> 03:06:47,082
I have broken

1265
03:06:50,543 --> 03:07:00,220
But my heart and life, I think,
I have left there

1266
03:07:32,961 --> 03:07:36,548
If not for love...

1267
03:07:42,345 --> 03:07:47,183
If not for love...

1268
03:07:57,277 --> 03:08:05,326
What would life be...
if not for love, my Love?

1269
03:08:12,042 --> 03:08:18,340
To what end would death be...
if not for love?

1270
03:08:28,058 --> 03:08:29,768
Love

1271
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:32,896
Love

1272
03:08:38,610 --> 03:08:42,906
Sweeter than the sweetest is love;
sourer than the sour, is love

1273
03:08:43,615 --> 03:08:49,162
A promise kept and a tie
with the lover is love

1274
03:09:24,322 --> 03:09:30,495
So many Lovers before us...

1275
03:09:32,956 --> 03:09:39,879
have already walked
this path

1276
03:09:58,314 --> 03:10:04,320
They are oceans...
not a path

1277
03:10:12,328 --> 03:10:19,336
in which they
have all sunk

1278
03:10:24,716 --> 03:10:29,471
The greatest truth;
the biggest lie

1279
03:10:30,930 --> 03:10:34,976
A promise kept;
a bond between lovers

1280
03:10:38,813 --> 03:10:44,361
Bereft of love, I am...

1281
03:12:08,695 --> 03:12:11,614
What would life be
without any love...?

1282
03:12:15,035 --> 03:12:17,871
To what end would death be,
if not for love?

1283
03:16:05,223 --> 03:16:08,226
Lots of congratulatory calls
have been coming from India.

1284
03:16:18,319 --> 03:16:21,489
Are you happy?
- I'm very happy.

1285
03:16:27,078 --> 03:16:33,626
The tears you shed last night
while singing was a terrific touch.

1286
03:16:38,340 --> 03:16:41,217
This venom of Manav
was to be ejected.

1287
03:16:41,968 --> 03:16:43,928
I'm glad it happened
before we got married.

1288
03:16:45,889 --> 03:16:50,143
Had it happened after marriage,
I would have been very hurt.

1289
03:16:59,652 --> 03:17:03,948
Tomorrow fly back, the next day
we get married and then...

1290
03:17:04,657 --> 03:17:07,077
Do you know the BPL guys
called up...

1291
03:17:07,452 --> 03:17:10,205
And said we'll have a
great reception at the airport!

1292
03:17:11,206 --> 03:17:14,042
Tomorrow will be the
best day of my life!

1293
03:17:18,797 --> 03:17:19,964
Nobody will step forward!

1294
03:17:20,215 --> 03:17:23,385
After today you will
become Mrs. Vikrant Kapur.

1295
03:17:23,718 --> 03:17:27,097
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1296
03:17:28,431 --> 03:17:30,892
Is everything all right?
Did Manav come here?

1297
03:17:31,184 --> 03:17:33,603
- He did come.
- What did he say?

1298
03:17:33,978 --> 03:17:35,730
He wanted to meet Mansi.

1299
03:17:37,857 --> 03:17:41,236
- Then...?
- He just vanished.

1300
03:17:42,362 --> 03:17:44,489
- ACP sir?
- Yes?

1301
03:17:44,739 --> 03:17:46,866
I need security.
Strict security.

1302
03:17:47,242 --> 03:17:49,119
Everything is arranged.

1303
03:17:51,538 --> 03:17:54,040
Mansi is not feeling well.
Can you please...?

1304
03:17:55,166 --> 03:17:57,585
The entire drama is ready.
You'll be married by 4 o'clock.

1305
03:17:58,169 --> 03:18:00,088
Followed by a reception at Leela.

1306
03:18:01,631 --> 03:18:04,134
Don't worry about Manav.
We'll get him out of the way.

1307
03:18:05,260 --> 03:18:07,679
Get him out. If need be.

1308
03:18:08,596 --> 03:18:11,558
- We'll have a great time together.
- Sister...

1309
03:18:27,490 --> 03:18:32,704
- Father, sister needs you.
- Hold this.

1310
03:18:37,751 --> 03:18:41,338
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1311
03:18:42,047 --> 03:18:46,009
- What? - Whom are you
laughing and drinking with?

1312
03:18:47,344 --> 03:18:53,892
I get your point. In this
world, we first make friends.

1313
03:18:54,851 --> 03:18:57,645
Then we like them.
Then we have fights.

1314
03:18:59,022 --> 03:19:02,567
If the friend apologises
after a fight...

1315
03:19:03,610 --> 03:19:05,195
Love grows even more.

1316
03:19:07,113 --> 03:19:09,532
Father, do you know
what you're saying?

1317
03:19:10,784 --> 03:19:14,454
Jagmohan has come to bless you.

1318
03:19:14,913 --> 03:19:16,414
As my friend.

1319
03:19:17,749 --> 03:19:19,459
Let's go in.

1320
03:19:27,133 --> 03:19:28,301
Take this.

1321
03:19:32,097 --> 03:19:33,264
Let her go.

1322
03:19:34,933 --> 03:19:36,101
I'll make a move.

1323
03:19:37,143 --> 03:19:40,480
- Brother, she...
- Apology...?

1324
03:19:40,897 --> 03:19:42,899
Doesn't matter.

1325
03:19:48,697 --> 03:19:49,739
Welcome madam.

1326
03:19:59,124 --> 03:20:03,253
You were drinking Coca
Cola with Mr. Mehta?

1327
03:20:03,461 --> 03:20:07,757
- Is that a crime?
- You know what he is to us?

1328
03:20:08,341 --> 03:20:09,926
He's an old friend of mine.

1329
03:20:14,097 --> 03:20:16,433
Are you trying to
teach me something?

1330
03:20:16,683 --> 03:20:20,270
You are needlessly doubting!

1331
03:20:21,271 --> 03:20:23,565
Mansi is waiting for you.

1332
03:20:42,917 --> 03:20:44,544
Don't be scared.

1333
03:20:44,836 --> 03:20:48,548
I've come to extinguish
not light a fire in your life.

1334
03:20:51,343 --> 03:20:53,928
No, Manav. Not today.

1335
03:20:54,262 --> 03:20:57,724
It has to be today!

1336
03:20:59,726 --> 03:21:02,729
It is essential to remove
your sister's make-up today!

1337
03:21:04,606 --> 03:21:06,483
Mansi, I only come to tell you...

1338
03:21:07,901 --> 03:21:10,987
Marriage is neither a
contract nor a festival!

1339
03:21:11,363 --> 03:21:13,448
If it's a festival,
it's for people!

1340
03:21:14,657 --> 03:21:17,202
Marriage is a union of
two souls and hearts!

1341
03:21:18,870 --> 03:21:22,916
And two human beings live
and die a good life together!

1342
03:21:24,292 --> 03:21:29,881
By marrying Vikrant, you're
deceiving him the most!

1343
03:21:30,924 --> 03:21:33,677
Three lives are
being ruined by it!

1344
03:21:36,388 --> 03:21:41,518
You are marrying Vikrant but
Manav lives in your heart!

1345
03:21:43,019 --> 03:21:46,189
No. Nobody is in my heart.

1346
03:21:47,190 --> 03:21:48,858
You are lying!

1347
03:21:50,402 --> 03:21:53,780
Manav is present in every
tone, every song of yours!

1348
03:21:54,698 --> 03:21:57,742
Because Manav is your
first and last love!

1349
03:22:01,371 --> 03:22:04,040
- Come out, mister.
- Just a minute.

1350
03:22:05,625 --> 03:22:09,963
Look at you. You're crying!

1351
03:22:11,464 --> 03:22:15,135
Your tears say that what
is happening is not true!

1352
03:22:17,303 --> 03:22:19,889
Lovers can die, not love!

1353
03:22:21,641 --> 03:22:25,020
- Forget it, Manav.
- I am yours and will wait for you!

1354
03:22:39,034 --> 03:22:40,201
Control yourself.

1355
03:22:54,341 --> 03:22:58,011
ACP sir. A man came
into the lounge.

1356
03:22:59,054 --> 03:23:02,432
Went in. Then he also went out.

1357
03:23:03,224 --> 03:23:04,893
And you were watching?

1358
03:23:05,393 --> 03:23:07,729
I was told he's
a family member.

1359
03:23:09,481 --> 03:23:12,942
- Is that wrong?
- He's from my father's family!

1360
03:23:14,069 --> 03:23:15,987
He's my enemy! Enemy!

1361
03:23:18,198 --> 03:23:19,741
Enemy!

1362
03:23:41,930 --> 03:23:45,308
- How long will it take?
- About an hour and a half.

1363
03:24:16,172 --> 03:24:20,093
- Yes? - I'm not feeling well.
- May I sit in the car? - Yes.

1364
03:24:23,596 --> 03:24:25,390
Take Mansi to the limousine.

1365
03:24:31,438 --> 03:24:36,026
I don't understand. The marriage
will be in the court and Mandap...

1366
03:24:37,986 --> 03:24:40,280
Nor will you understand.

1367
03:24:41,740 --> 03:24:43,950
This music has no tune. That's all.

1368
03:24:58,214 --> 03:25:01,551
ACP sir? What security is this?

1369
03:25:02,719 --> 03:25:04,220
Do you see that man with the dog?

1370
03:25:05,347 --> 03:25:10,060
He is my enemy?
He has a bomb in his pocket.

1371
03:25:10,643 --> 03:25:12,771
...which will blow up all of us!

1372
03:25:15,565 --> 03:25:17,359
Just wait for a minute.

1373
03:25:25,283 --> 03:25:31,122
- Don't move. - I'm not moving.
- I thought you'd move.

1374
03:25:33,625 --> 03:25:36,586
Why did you think of marrying
in court before the ceremony?

1375
03:25:37,754 --> 03:25:39,089
I'm from Aaj Tak from Delhi.

1376
03:25:39,339 --> 03:25:43,802
Is it fine if I tell
you this tomorrow?

1377
03:25:45,679 --> 03:25:48,264
Come to Hotel Leela for
the reception. Then ask me.

1378
03:25:48,973 --> 03:25:51,267
Right now I'm a bit tense.

1379
03:25:57,524 --> 03:25:59,317
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1380
03:25:59,943 --> 03:26:02,487
The boy is a fan of Mansi's.

1381
03:26:02,862 --> 03:26:10,036
Like normal fans. We found this
picture of Mansi in his pocket.

1382
03:26:11,913 --> 03:26:13,915
No bomb like you said.

1383
03:26:18,169 --> 03:26:21,214
There's a lot of difference
between other fans and him.

1384
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:23,299
Arrest him.

1385
03:26:30,265 --> 03:26:33,893
There has to be a reason.
I can't simply arrest him!

1386
03:26:34,436 --> 03:26:38,148
- You can't arrest him?
- No, I can't.

1387
03:26:38,690 --> 03:26:43,319
Then dance. Come on, dance.

1388
03:27:10,847 --> 03:27:12,891
This public has driven me crazy!

1389
03:27:18,271 --> 03:27:21,483
- How are you?
- Fine.

1390
03:27:22,859 --> 03:27:29,240
Manav is here. The leech!
What does he want from us?

1391
03:27:48,051 --> 03:27:52,972
- Do you know him?
- He is Manav's dog.

1392
03:27:53,890 --> 03:27:56,601
Very loving towards Manav's dog.

1393
03:27:57,894 --> 03:28:00,271
He didn't come himself.
Sent the dog instead.

1394
03:28:03,149 --> 03:28:04,317
Get lost!

1395
03:28:06,611 --> 03:28:08,154
Go back to that rascal!

1396
03:28:20,458 --> 03:28:22,085
My dog will die!

1397
03:28:22,836 --> 03:28:24,004
Hold him!

1398
03:28:27,173 --> 03:28:28,800
Let go of me!

1399
03:28:42,272 --> 03:28:43,773
Hit him!

1400
03:29:05,962 --> 03:29:08,965
Sister! Let's go!

1401
03:29:17,182 --> 03:29:20,226
Manav, your Brownie.

1402
03:30:01,935 --> 03:30:03,520
Tell me something truthfully.

1403
03:30:06,648 --> 03:30:11,569
- Yes? - What did Manav say
to Mansi in the airport lounge?

1404
03:30:15,407 --> 03:30:16,866
Swear by Mansi and answer.

1405
03:30:19,160 --> 03:30:25,625
Manav said, Mansi you
maybe marrying Vikrant...

1406
03:30:27,711 --> 03:30:30,880
But only Manav lives
in your heart.

1407
03:30:35,802 --> 03:30:37,804
Look there...

1408
03:30:47,397 --> 03:30:49,524
Have they come here too?

1409
03:30:55,238 --> 03:30:58,616
- How much longer? - 3 are
registered. Only 2 couples remain.

1410
03:30:59,075 --> 03:31:01,119
Everything is fit.
Will happen fast.

1411
03:31:01,619 --> 03:31:05,957
We've organized everything. The
international press will be at Leela.

1412
03:31:06,207 --> 03:31:11,838
After all Superstar Kapu
marries Beauty Queen Mansi.

1413
03:31:16,968 --> 03:31:23,433
You must take the blessings of 7
disciples of Lord Shiva on Monday.

1414
03:31:23,725 --> 03:31:26,144
You will always be
victorious in life.

1415
03:31:26,978 --> 03:31:28,646
Sorry, I don't have a coin.

1416
03:31:29,981 --> 03:31:31,649
Take this.

1417
03:31:35,612 --> 03:31:39,574
May the groom of your choice
always keep you happy.

1418
03:31:48,375 --> 03:31:49,959
The registrar will
call you in 5 minutes.

1419
03:31:50,585 --> 03:31:54,673
- I'll be there.
- Prabha, bring both of them.

1420
03:32:30,500 --> 03:32:33,253
In 5 minutes, we'll be married.

1421
03:32:37,090 --> 03:32:39,009
Strange is life.

1422
03:32:44,097 --> 03:32:45,765
Will you be honest with me?

1423
03:32:48,101 --> 03:32:49,561
Are you happy?

1424
03:32:51,604 --> 03:32:53,106
Yes, I'm happy.

1425
03:32:54,816 --> 03:32:56,526
Do you love me?

1426
03:33:00,363 --> 03:33:01,865
Do you love me?

1427
03:33:04,117 --> 03:33:05,660
What a question that is!

1428
03:33:09,497 --> 03:33:13,084
The coin that you just
gave that mendicant...

1429
03:33:15,378 --> 03:33:16,963
That reminded me of my mother.

1430
03:33:18,673 --> 03:33:21,217
Mother... Wow!

1431
03:33:23,428 --> 03:33:26,264
Mother would say, do good
and forget about it.

1432
03:33:27,432 --> 03:33:29,642
Do your duty, don't expect rewards.

1433
03:33:30,769 --> 03:33:32,854
True love lies in sacrifice.

1434
03:33:34,522 --> 03:33:36,900
And uncle called it trash.

1435
03:33:37,942 --> 03:33:40,028
Grab! Grab!

1436
03:33:45,992 --> 03:33:49,662
I don't' know why I
feel I'm losing today.

1437
03:33:51,998 --> 03:33:56,920
And that Manav of yours
is trying to defeat me!

1438
03:33:59,714 --> 03:34:03,677
And I'm not used to defeat!
Not at all!

1439
03:34:05,011 --> 03:34:08,598
I want to win. Come what may!

1440
03:34:10,725 --> 03:34:13,603
If you feel indebted to me...

1441
03:34:14,604 --> 03:34:17,524
You have to help me win.

1442
03:34:19,275 --> 03:34:21,111
I...? How?

1443
03:34:23,279 --> 03:34:25,949
Look at my love.

1444
03:34:28,660 --> 03:34:32,122
I only possess arrogance. Envy.

1445
03:34:32,497 --> 03:34:36,084
Anger! Obstinacy!

1446
03:34:37,544 --> 03:34:43,675
And Manav? God lives
in him. Many Gods.

1447
03:34:45,552 --> 03:34:49,222
His love, true love
has hurt me hard.

1448
03:34:51,141 --> 03:34:52,976
Has always hurt me.

1449
03:34:58,023 --> 03:34:59,441
He was right.

1450
03:35:00,567 --> 03:35:03,278
Marriage is no contract
or festival.

1451
03:35:04,404 --> 03:35:06,072
It's a union of two souls.

1452
03:35:08,116 --> 03:35:12,537
Two people live and
die together bound in it.

1453
03:35:14,706 --> 03:35:16,041
He was right.

1454
03:35:16,374 --> 03:35:22,505
Winning the world, wearing western
clothes don't change an Indian girl.

1455
03:35:25,508 --> 03:35:29,220
Her first love remains
her first love.

1456
03:35:33,141 --> 03:35:35,894
Look, I'm a director.

1457
03:35:37,270 --> 03:35:40,857
I know it.
I hear the voice inside.

1458
03:35:43,318 --> 03:35:45,570
Manav lives in every pore of you.

1459
03:35:46,821 --> 03:35:48,573
In every drop of your blood.

1460
03:35:50,658 --> 03:35:53,453
Look at this!

1461
03:35:55,622 --> 03:35:59,626
Silly girl! You fought with
your love and came to me.

1462
03:36:01,086 --> 03:36:02,504
You changed yourself.

1463
03:36:03,213 --> 03:36:04,798
But couldn't change your heart.

1464
03:36:07,467 --> 03:36:10,929
Your heart is there... with Manav.

1465
03:36:14,683 --> 03:36:17,644
Manav is the true music
of your songs.

1466
03:36:19,479 --> 03:36:20,647
Not me.

1467
03:36:22,315 --> 03:36:25,944
Today... you have to
give me victory.

1468
03:36:27,529 --> 03:36:29,239
Do you know how?

1469
03:36:31,241 --> 03:36:33,159
Open this door.

1470
03:36:35,745 --> 03:36:40,959
And run to Manav in
front of everyone.

1471
03:36:48,466 --> 03:36:49,801
For my sake.

1472
03:36:51,428 --> 03:36:53,430
For the happiness
of all three of us.

1473
03:36:56,891 --> 03:36:59,477
Go. Go, Mansi!

1474
03:37:04,983 --> 03:37:09,362
We, I mean you, me and Manav
will always remain friends.

1475
03:37:24,586 --> 03:37:26,546
Come on. Don't think.

1476
03:37:29,591 --> 03:37:30,800
Come on. He's called you.

1477
03:37:31,051 --> 03:37:33,553
No, Mansi will go to Manav.

1478
03:37:35,055 --> 03:37:36,473
Go Mansi.

1479
03:37:55,909 --> 03:37:57,702
Go. Manav is waiting for you.

1480
03:38:08,129 --> 03:38:10,173
Mansi has gone to Manav.

1481
03:38:12,801 --> 03:38:13,968
Yes!

1482
03:38:19,974 --> 03:38:23,144
So now we will hug!

1483
03:40:08,291 --> 03:40:13,296
- We separated you.
- And we're bringing you together.

1484
03:40:14,923 --> 03:40:19,219
You have our blessings.
Hug her.

1485
03:40:24,015 --> 03:40:27,352
How will they?
We're standing here!

1486
03:40:53,294 --> 03:40:57,048
- Is this possible?
- It is happening.

1487
03:41:00,176 --> 03:41:04,848
- What is happening?
- This can happen
