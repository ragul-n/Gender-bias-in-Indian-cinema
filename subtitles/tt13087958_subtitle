1
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,500
See, the thing about love is...

2
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,875
...it's not about how one looks or  
 what work a person does...

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:24,875
...or the age, religion, caste, gender.  
 Nothing.

4
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,541
All that matters  
 is how they make you feel.

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,500
Come on! You got him!

6
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,625
Sir?

7
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,541
Sir?

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,625
Yes.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,041
Sir, are you there?

10
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,291
I've chopped the veggies  
 like you asked me to.

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,958
You sure you don't want me to cook?

12
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,125
No, I told you that I'm cooking.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,375
Whatever you do, don't wash 
the dishes and incur my wrath.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,958
You don't have to tell me every day. 
Get going now.

15
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, right!

16
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,708
You've broken all but three!  
 Soon I'll have nothing to cook in.

17
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,875
-Oh, and listen. 
-Yes.

18
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,666
You don't need to come the next two days.

19
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,083
Why? Off to your daughter's?

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,500
No, I'm going for a yoga retreat 
in Pondicherry.

21
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,833
Pondicherry?

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,750
Are you okay? Why are you all flushed?

23
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,250
Nothing. I'm fine.

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,375
Your age is messing with your memory.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:31,250
Whatever. If you've got the dates  
 wrong, call me. I'll come.

26
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm very sure. You may leave.

27
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,416
But if so, let me know.

28
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,541
Okay!

29
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,708
-I am leaving. 
-Okay.

30
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,708
And don't forget to take your pills!

31
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,791
Okay!

32
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:53,500
Hey, ho! And the good times begin

33
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,958
I'm a lover boy waiting

34
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,541
A rockstar singing a love ballad

35
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,416
And woo-hoo! I now write fine poetry too

36
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,833
Why won't I sing all night?

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,541
I am a prince charming

38
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,208
I feel the butterflies in my gut

39
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,125
And a chorus on my lips!

40
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,833
Hey, ho! And the good times begin

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,208
I am a prince charming

42
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,875
I feel the butterflies in my gut

43
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,666
And a chorus on my lips!

44
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,625
Like I said, all that matters  
 is how they make you feel.

45
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,208
Foolish, happy...

46
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,541
...and most importantly, young!

47
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:34,833
YOUTH, HERE WE COME

48
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:36,958
Come in.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,041
You have a lovely place.

50
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,500
Thank you.

51
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,583
The bag has wheels, you know.

52
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,250
Oh!

53
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,333
Tea?

54
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,500
-Tea? 
-Yeah.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,791
-Sure. 
-Sit.

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,791
Light or strong?

57
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,833
Very little milk and one spoon sugar.

58
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,791
Okay.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,416
-Here, let me. 
-No, no, I can do this.

60
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,750
Superb!

61
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,875
-Come, let's go to the balcony. 
-The balcony?

62
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:45,416
If someone sees us, 
it'll spread like wildfire here!

63
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,166
What if it does?

64
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,208
-My daughter will kill me! Please. 
-Fine!

65
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,625
Is that an antique boiler? Beautiful!

66
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,916
-Was it hard convincing them? 
-Of course. They didn't want me to go.

67
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,500
"Don't be silly, Ma. 
This disease is everywhere.

68
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,166
You're especially at risk at your age...

69
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,791
...and Pondy's full of foreigners! 
Is there need for a yoga retreat now?

70
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,500
What happens if you fall sick ma? 
Think about us and your grandkids, Ma!"

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,416
And?

72
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,416
So, I said "I spent 25 years 
raising you and your sister...

73
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,166
...and 20 years caring for your father.

74
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,750
And my only joy for the 
last five years is yoga.

75
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,833
And you want me to die 
even without that? Okay."

76
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,125
And?

77
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,333
He felt guilty, I guess. He let me go!

78
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,833
What if he realizes you're here 
instead of the yoga retreat?

79
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,125
Feels like the time I told my folks 
I'm off for an interview...

80
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,625
...and partied with 
Loyola college boys instead.

81
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,458
What? Like you never played 
truant in college?

82
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,500
I did.

83
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,833
I just never imagined you that naughty. 
I pegged you for a little saint.

84
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,625
I was naughty but I never got caught.

85
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,250
How's the tea?

86
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,750
Killer!

87
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,666
Oh, my baby

88
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,208
-I love the song! 
-Me too.

89
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,208
Oh, my baby

90
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,125
You make me go crazy

91
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,041
Oh, my baby, I see you  
 And my heart goes crazy

92
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,583
So, what's the plan 
for our "yoga retreat"?

93
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,875
Here's my awesome plan 
for our yoga retreat.

94
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,833
Hey, wait!

95
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,291
-Careful! Don't move! 
-Wait. You don't move.

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,875
Sorry. This happens a lot these days.

97
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,916
Not bad, you clean up well!

98
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:12,208
When you're as clumsy as I am, 
you need to master this!

99
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,791
Anyway, the plan...

100
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,083
Go on.

101
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,125
-Open the fridge. 
-Why?

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,958
Open it and see for yourself.

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,625
I see.

104
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,416
A glass of wine while I cook, 
then over dinner...

105
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,208
...and another glass over a movie? 
 Alai Payuthey is on Prime.

106
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
I like it! Good job!

107
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,083
Want to freshen up?

108
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,208
Yes.

109
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,500
Take any room. All have washrooms.

110
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,875
Which one's yours?

111
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,833
The last one... on the left.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,875
Oh, my baby

113
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,833
You make me go crazy

114
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,875
Oh, my baby, you make me go crazy

115
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:09,708
Oh, my baby, I see you  
 And my heart goes crazy

116
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:15,375
Oh, my baby, let's sail away  
 In this river of love

117
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,333
Is this love?

118
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,708
Have you lit my fire?

119
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:27,208
Is the silver moon our abode?

120
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,208
I went searching for you my baby,  
 And found myself

121
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,416
And when I looked for myself,  
 I found you right there

122
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,416
Oh, my baby

123
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,708
You make me go crazy

124
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,708
Oh, my baby

125
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,750
You make me go crazy

126
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:09,583
Oh, my baby, I see you  
 And my heart goes crazy

127
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:15,416
Oh, my baby, let's sail away  
 In this river of love

128
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Wow.

129
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,541
What?

130
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,250
I just... haven't seen you 
like this before.

131
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,458
Stop staring. You'll burn the food.

132
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,750
With you here looking like that, 
who gives a damn about food?

133
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,625
Well, I do, I don't eat burnt food.

134
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,791
What's the alarm for?

135
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,416
If I had really gone to Pondicherry, 
I would've reached now.

136
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,666
So, I'll call my son 
and tell him I've reached.

137
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,166
Lower the sound, man.

138
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,875
-Smart! 
-Thanks!

139
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,625
To good company.

140
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,250
To good company.

141
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,625
Thank you.

142
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,125
-Wow! 
-What happened?

143
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,375
The food is delicious!

144
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,083
-Good job! 
-Thank you.

145
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,500
What's your alarm for?

146
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,000
The PM's speech is now. 
Shall we listen?

147
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:09,041
Nah! In five minutes, you'll be flooded 
with texts saying he's amazing...

148
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
...or he's wrong. With full analysis!

149
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,541
Told you!

150
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,458
It's my son, Arun calling.

151
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
I've had too much wine.

152
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,375
What if I blabber the truth?

153
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,458
Call him in the morning.

154
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,416
Tell him that you've become old, so you 
got tired and nodded off.

155
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,541
Good idea.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Maybe you should answer.

157
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,041
-Hello.  
-Hello.

158
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,208
Ma! Why didn't you answer my calls?

159
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,208
I did now, didn't I? What happened?

160
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,250
Modi's announced a 21-day lockdown!

161
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,583
What?

162
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,375
-Yes, Ma! It's a lockdown!  
-Lockdown?

163
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
-You've to leave right now, Ma!  
-TV?

164
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,416
-Now? But... 
-Yes, no!

165
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,000
This is serious!  
 You're putting all of us at risk too!

166
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:20,916
BREAKING NEWS

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The PM's announced a 21 day...

168
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,166
-...nationwide lockdown.  
-What am I supposed to do now?

169
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,041
-Wait a minute. 
-What's happening, Ma?

170
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,000
-You can at least come by cab.  
-Oh, no!

171
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,041
I'll ask your yoga retreat  
 to get you a cab.

172
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,875
-Please be packed and ready. Okay?  
-Disconnect the call.

173
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,791
Yes.

174
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,458
How did he get the yoga retreat's number?

175
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,625
There's no yoga retreat! We made that up! 
What's wrong with you?

176
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,208
Good lord. I forgot. Sorry. Right.

177
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,500
What do we do now?

178
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,625
Wait, so, who is he calling?

179
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,208
New number? I'll check in FindCaller.

180
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,208
-It says Arun. Your Arun? 
-Yes.

181
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,625
How does he have my number?

182
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,000
I told him you're the yoga retreat's head.

183
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,750
-Smart. 
-Thanks.

184
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,125
What do we do?

185
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,833
Okay, check if Uber or Ola are available.

186
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
The apps are crashing. 
Everyone must be panicking.

187
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,708
Anyway we'll get one sooner or later.

188
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,833
It's a three and a half hour drive 
from Pondy...

189
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,375
...so, he'll expect you around midnight.

190
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,041
And if we don't get a cab?

191
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,500
-I can't have him pick me up from here. 
-Okay, fine!

192
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,583
Agreed.

193
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,375
What do we do now?

194
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,291
-It's him again. 
-Talk to him.

195
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,208
-Hello.  
-Hello, yoga retreat, how may I help you?

196
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,416
Listen, my mother  
 Lakshmi Rajan is at your retreat.

197
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,000
Please book a cab for her  
 to Chennai now!

198
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,958
-I don't care what it costs.  
-Calm down.

199
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,000
We've made inquiries when the 
lockdown was announced.

200
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
Unfortunately, cabs aren't 
ready to come to Chennai tonight...

201
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,333
...as they'll get stuck there.

202
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:00,041
That's unacceptable! Where will she go?

203
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,958
Keep calm, my friend.

204
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,791
We've arranged for all our participants...

205
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,333
-...to stay here during the lockdown. 
-What are you saying?

206
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,208
We cook our own organic produce 
in our own kitchens.

207
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,875
100% organic!

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,541
Once your mother is back home...

209
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:23,916
-...she will feel good and happy. 
-What?

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,958
And she'll get a free 
21 day yogic cleanse.

211
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,916
Let me talk to her about this.

212
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,791
Your mother is more than happy 
with this arrangement.

213
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,875
-Yes. 
-Oh!

214
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,083
Stay safe.

215
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,916
-We'll be in touch. 
-What?

216
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,291
Hail Lord Shiva. Praise the Lord.

217
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,875
Salutations to the auspicious one.

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,041
-21 days! 
-21 days!

219
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,958
-21 days! 
-21 days!

220
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,833
21 days!

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,666
-21 days! 
-21 days!

222
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh my popsicle!

223
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,791
Your sly peeps make my heart skip a beat

224
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,333
Oh, my tutti frutti!

225
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:33,541
Your naughty ideas turn  
 My greys are black again

226
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:38,208
The night is breezy, time is lazy

227
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,708
And I'm here all hazy

228
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,208
Hey, my lion cub  
 Your words are strong and steady

229
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,916
And my heart is racing away

230
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,250
La di da di teddy  
 Your glances are a li'l dirty

231
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,666
And my cheeks are tingly

232
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:19,083
My heart is longing, let's get going

233
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,666
There's no need for words anymore

234
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,333
Good morning, beautiful.

235
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,500
-I need tea. 
-It's there somewhere.

236
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,375
I'll make us both a cup.

237
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,375
Perfect. Just the way I like it.

238
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:13,958
Thank you.

239
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,125
Yours looks different, 
like in the commercials.

240
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,166
It's how I like it.

241
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,000
So, you didn't like yesterday's?

242
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,541
No, it was nice!

243
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,208
Just different, that's all.

244
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,291
Then teach me how you like it.

245
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,916
We have 21 days. 
I'll teach you everything.

246
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:57,416
Your cheeks, ruby red  
 Tell me a whole new story now

247
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:04,666
Your striking lips  
 Sing a lullaby of love now

248
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,000
Floating in the skies,  
 I want to soar higher

249
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,791
An electrifying passion, pulls me closer

250
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,541
I become stronger when I hold your hands

251
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,250
I melt away when I rest on your shoulders

252
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,166
I have no words to express  
 My heart's desire

253
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,625
How are you, Mom?

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,666
-Who was that?  
-There is no one around.

255
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,250
Ecstasy, runs wild

256
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,833
And lights a fire within

257
00:18:54,125 --> 00:19:00,208
Love brings us closer  
 And so does a bit of lust

258
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,375
Floating in the skies

259
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,416
I want to soar higher

260
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:08,000
An explosive passion, pulls me closer

261
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,916
When I'm beside you  
 I feel like a princess

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,666
I can tell you whatever I want  
 Not just impress

263
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,541
When we get together  
 Let's throw caution to the wind

264
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,875
Why do you always leave 
the spoons in the dishes?

265
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,125
Today I'll cook. 
You can do the dishes.

266
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,541
No need. I'll cook.

267
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,541
You cook every day and 
I end up doing the dishes.

268
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,625
Let me cook today.

269
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,208
If your cooking was edible, 
why would I sweat it?

270
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,250
"Oh, wow, Rajiv! You cook 
better than a five star chef!

271
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,666
What a wonderful cook!"

272
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,208
All lies I see!

273
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,208
Fine! You cook and eat yourself!

274
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,250
-To heck with you! 
-There! Your answer to everything!

275
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,375
Your answer to everything is to shout!

276
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,375
Who's shouting? Me?

277
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,583
Yeah, you!

278
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,083
-Am I? 
-Yes!

279
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,541
Me, shouting? What nonsense!

280
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,208
Yes, even if you ask a 100 times...

281
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,291
What?

282
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,916
How many times to tell you to not 
put your wet towel on the bed?

283
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,208
How many times to tell you to not put 
dishes in the fridge with the spoons?

284
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,958
What's the big deal with that?

285
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
But my towel on the bed is a big deal?

286
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,791
The bed gets damp and uncomfortable. 
It's gross!

287
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,291
It's my side of the bed, and I like 
it nice and cool when I lie down.

288
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,958
Well, I like it when I can take a dish out 
and eat it straightaway.

289
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,166
My fridge, my rules!

290
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,833
Oh, so it's your fridge now? How sexist!

291
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:54,208
What's sexist about that? 
It's my fridge if I've paid for it!

292
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,000
I've not seen this face 
of yours these five years!

293
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,916
I can't have the same face 
for five years, can I?

294
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,166
But that's not the point!

295
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,291
The point is, what's the big deal 
if I leave the spoon in the dish?

296
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:12,208
The spoons keep getting knocked out 
and dirtying the fridge! Yuck!

297
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,125
Then don't knock them out! 
You need to be careful.

298
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,541
Look who's talking!

299
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,375
You break everything 
with your clumsy hands!

300
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,375
What?

301
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,750
At least I keep the bed dry and hygienic 
and not sleep in filth like you!

302
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,041
Then roll around in it yourself, 
you buffalo!

303
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,250
-What? 
-You heard me!

304
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,666
-What? 
-I'll say it again!

305
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,041
-What? 
-I called you a buffalo!

306
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,500
-Hello! 
-Hello yourself!

307
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:23,875
Oh, no!

308
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,250
Oh, no!

309
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,500
-What? 
-My daughter! And her husband!

310
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,166
Oh, no!

311
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,666
Aren't the cops beating 
those who step out at this time?

312
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,666
No idea!

313
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,083
-What do we do? 
-No idea!

314
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,875
Come here! Let's go.

315
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,750
-Not there! This way! 
-You went there!

316
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,291
Where?

317
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,666
-Pick this. 
-Where are you putting the luggage?

318
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,708
Oh, no!

319
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,791
-What is-- 
-Come with me.

320
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,500
-Is there a way out here? 
-Get in!

321
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,333
In a cupboard? Are you trying to kill me?

322
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,416
Hold this!

323
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
-Oh, my God! 
-Hold this.

324
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,833
What are you doing?

325
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,125
Oh, no!

326
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Who's there?

327
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,833
-It's me! 
-What the hell?

328
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,375
She'll get suspicious 
if she sees two cups!

329
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,083
Hi, Pa!

330
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,916
Chitra and Subbu, 
what are you two doing here?

331
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,333
Where's my grandson?

332
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,708
Aunt's with him, Pa!

333
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,541
We got you some basics. 
How are you?

334
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,708
-I'm fine! 
-Pa!

335
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,833
You should have called! Why take the risk?

336
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,083
Can't we just check on you, Uncle?

337
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,291
Are you up to something naughty here?

338
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,500
At this age?

339
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,541
You better pray the police don't catch you 
with those covid curls!

340
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,833
-Pa! 
-Yes?

341
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,708
I'll keep the toiletries in your cupboard.

342
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:58,125
-Okay... wait! 
-What?

343
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,875
The doctors say they must 
first be cleaned and sanitized.

344
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,791
Safety first, right?

345
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,375
Then why is a wet towel on the bed?

346
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,541
-Which one? 
-It stinks!

347
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh... I like it when I lie down. 
It's nice and cool.

348
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,458
-Pa!  
 -Come, I'll make some tea for us.

349
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,125
No, wait.

350
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,875
Are you okay, Pa?

351
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,666
It must be tough for you, 
all alone here...

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,083
...without mom too, must be hard.

353
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,291
Come with us, Pa!

354
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,166
-Oh, no! 
-My bags!

355
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,958
I'll drop off more vegetables 
in a few days.

356
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,541
Please don't. I'll manage.

357
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,916
Okay! Bye!

358
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,333
Tell Aarav his grandpa misses him!

359
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,166
Bye!

360
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,291
Accusing me of being naughty! Jackass!

361
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,916
Thank God they didn't 
take me with them.

362
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:05,791
Lord knows, I can't stand 21 days...

363
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,708
...with that hairy fellow and 
his atrocious cooking!

364
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,166
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,333
I shouldn't have put the 
wet towel on the bed.

366
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,333
I shouldn't have put 
spoons inside the fridge.

367
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,166
I'm sorry too.

368
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,083
How's the tea?

369
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,625
Perfect.

370
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,708
Actually you cook damn well. 
I just hate doing the dishes.

371
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:54,916
I knew it!

372
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,083
But why should I worry 
about dirty dishes?

373
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,166
Your wife's trained you well.

374
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,666
I want to say the same about 
your sainted husband.

375
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,208
-But then I'd be lying. 
-Hey!

376
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,416
-Hey! 
-Hey!

377
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:10,750
Wait!

378
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,958
No problem. I caught it.

379
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,875
Hey! What is it?

380
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,750
Do you not like my tea? 
Or do you not like me?

381
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:38,083
I don't even remember the last time 
someone offered me tea...

382
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,750
...how can I not like you?

383
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,041
What will you tell your daughter?

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,833
Seven years ago when she brought 
that clown Subbu home...

385
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,166
...and said she will only marry him, 
I agreed, didn't I?

386
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,958
Why? Can't I fall in love?

387
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,583
By the way...

388
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,791
...what will you tell your son?

389
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,083
That I love you. Simple.

390
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,625
Ma! Who is that?

391
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,041
Pa!

392
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,000
-Appa.  
-Yeah, kanna?

393
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:53,916
Where is amma?

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,875
I've been calling her. 
She's not answering.

395
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,416
I'm on my way but I don't like it.

396
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,833
Do I really have to go and stay with him?

397
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,708
The agency said they would 
send someone, right?

398
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:09,083
No, kanna. Your amma is  
 not okay with someone unknown.

399
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,958
And kanna, for you to drive everyday...

400
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,500
...to thaatha's place from ours  
 during the lockdown...

401
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,041
...is not advisable.

402
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,583
Why are you so nice?

403
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,375
This man has never accepted you.

404
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,666
It's been so long too.

405
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,333
Never made an effort...

406
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,125
Why are you thinking about  
 all that now?

407
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,541
He has always been nice  
 to my daughters.

408
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,041
Always?

409
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:34,375
You mean, during our annual visits 
for an hour each?

410
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,333
And that too only till we were in school.

411
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,875
Kanna, just let it go.

412
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,125
Have you reached?

413
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,041
Yeah, yeah. I'll go.

414
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,500
Not fair, Dad.

415
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,583
Really.

416
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,041
Akka.

417
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,958
I bet you're doing well in California...

418
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,958
...with your doting husband...

419
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,333
...and appa and amma by your side,  
 during this lockdown.

420
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:41,958
Whereas I...

421
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,458
I'm back here.

422
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,791
Back at this place where it's been ages  
 since we've visited.

423
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,041
And it's the first time that I'm here  
 without you.

424
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,083
All alone.

425
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,583
To stay with him.

426
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,458
Our scientist.

427
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,291
-It's going to be just the two of us.  
-Hi, kanna.

428
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,875
HIM AND ME

429
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,791
Mary, hold that. Push that pillow 
to the other side.

430
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,000
Here, hold this.

431
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,416
Careful!

432
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,458
Turn it and pull it out.

433
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,583
There's a certain physics to all this too.

434
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:20,583
Sure, I get it.

435
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:23,208
But don't irritate her with all this 
when she gets here.

436
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,375
I'll try not to talk to her at all!

437
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,250
Here, place this pillow over there.

438
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,833
The room looks fine, right?

439
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,916
Your face is covered with powder!

440
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,208
-Go easy on it. 
-Is that so?

441
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,416
Allow me, please. 
You just save your breath, okay?

442
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,041
My little girl...

443
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:07,666
...you left me and this home  
 bereft of music...

444
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,750
...when you went away.

445
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:15,041
And today, your little girl,  
 at the same age as you were…

446
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,291
...walks back here, to stay with me...

447
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:21,208
...bringing music back to my ears.

448
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,458
Hi, kanna.

449
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,916
Hello, thaatha.

450
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,791
For some time, it's going to be just...

451
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,125
HER AND ME

452
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,041
This is the bathroom, kanna.

453
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,416
This is your bed, kanna.

454
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,666
You'll find extra bedsheets 
in this cupboard.

455
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,791
The towels too. 
All are 100 percent cotton.

456
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,875
And for hot water...

457
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,291
It's summer. You might not need it. 
In case you do…

458
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,500
...the geyser switch is here, outside. 
Not in the bathroom.

459
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,250
Ten minutes will do. 
Or, the water gets too hot.

460
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,833
And boiling water is not good for 
the skin or hair.

461
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,583
"Don't irritate her with all this  
 when she gets here."

462
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,583
If you need anything, let me know.

463
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,375
Actually... if you need 
anything, you let me know.

464
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,250
I mean, that's why I'm here, right?

465
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,041
I'm going to be pretty much 
in this room.

466
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,625
I'll be working the whole time 
on my laptop. Lots of calls too.

467
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,583
So, just ping me, thaatha.

468
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:39,833
Sorry.

469
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,958
Just... call for me.

470
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:44,625
Right-o.

471
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,333
You have WhatsApp, kanna?

472
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,041
I have WhatsApp.

473
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,041
And won't you need Wi-Fi?

474
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,333
I brought my own portable router.

475
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,583
I wasn't sure if there would be 
Wi-Fi here, so...

476
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,125
I have Wi-Fi.

477
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,750
Anyhow, it would be nice 
to see you work.

478
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,791
Maybe you could tell me 
what you do, sometime.

479
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,041
Sure. Sometime.

480
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:13,833
Right-o.

481
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,333
Let me know if you get hungry.

482
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,250
I've stocked up on a lot of eatables.

483
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,125
Akka, thaatha is doing well.

484
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,708
The man is fit.

485
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,166
And he seems fine.

486
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,583
He could have easily managed by himself!

487
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,166
There is no need for me to be here.

488
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:42,666
I know he is mom's father.  
 That's the only reason I'm here.

489
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,583
I haven't forgotten the stories  
 we've heard growing up.

490
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,791
I mean, he hates appa.

491
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,666
He didn't even turn up at their wedding.

492
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,833
Made amma feel so abandoned all her life.

493
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,541
Severed ties with her completely.

494
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,958
Never once tried making amends.

495
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,583
When we used to visit him for Diwali...

496
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,416
...remember how mom and dad used to  
 wait outside the whole time?

497
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,333
While we brought him sweets...

498
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,208
...and he pretended to  
 ask us questions about school.

499
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,041
And only about science, at that!

500
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,708
Not once did he invite them in.

501
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:17,541
And how is it our fault  
 that he has put himself...

502
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,583
...in a self-imposed exile  
 for the last 30 years?

503
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,708
Not our fault at all.

504
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,083
Serves him just right.

505
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,416
Let him be alone.

506
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,708
I'll be damned!

507
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,166
The old man knows how to use WhatsApp!

508
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,500
Here, please help yourself.

509
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,125
What about you?

510
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,250
-I've kept some for myself. 
-Please eat.

511
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,083
Dentures! This, I forget.

512
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,083
You carry on. I'll eat this.

513
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,250
Come in.

514
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,958
Please come in, kanna.

515
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,500
Yes? 
Is there anything you want?

516
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,333
Could I have the Wi-Fi password?

517
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,291
Got your cellphone?

518
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,583
Just a second.

519
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,208
I've shared the password with you.

520
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,333
Oh!

521
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,916
Okay. Thank you.

522
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,750
Close the door.

523
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,500
Thank you, da.

524
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,958
The corona is spreading--

525
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,375
These people are 
not maintaining social distancing.

526
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,166
Then they wonder how it's spreading.

527
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,208
The Wi-Fi signal is not strong 
in the room.

528
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,083
Looks like I'll have to work from here.

529
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,458
You brought your own router, right?

530
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,000
Some problem. It's not working.

531
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,250
But you're in IT. Can't you fix it?

532
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,000
What's the problem with the router, kanna?

533
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,791
Maybe thaatha can have a look?

534
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,458
Seriously?

535
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,666
It has a manual, right?

536
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

537
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,250
-Boss, everyone has network issues.  
-Sir… Sorry, sir.

538
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,916
Aren't you that guy from Tirunelveli.

539
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,833
-You came with some...  
-Yes, sir.

540
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,125
...very good recommendations.

541
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,083
That's why you're here.

542
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,416
Sir, I'll complete it, sir.

543
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,041
How could you say that today?

544
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,416
What were you doing all these days?

545
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,250
Sorry, sir.  
 I promise I'll complete it by Monday.

546
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,833
It's been two weeks already!

547
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,458
Sir… Please, sir. I beg of you, sir.

548
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,291
-Please, sir. I beg of you, sir.  
-Siva, one second.

549
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,125
Deepika and Chirag are also on this call.

550
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,625
And they can't follow Tamil.

551
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,041
Could we stick to English, please?

552
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:39,541
I sorry, sir.  
 I try, I do Monday, sir.

553
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,583
-Complete work Monday, sir.  
 -Then, why did you promise earlier?

554
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,708
Then, why did you promise on a Wednesday?

555
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,583
Didn't he apologize?

556
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,375
So, why keep going on about  
 the same thing, Mr. Manikandan?

557
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,500
That's your name, right?

558
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,833
Do you have to scold someone this much?

559
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,083
Oh, Deepika and Chirag are there.

560
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,500
So, only in English.

561
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,000
Okay.

562
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,083
He said sorry.

563
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,583
I am also saying sorry on his behalf.

564
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,208
Forgive and move on.

565
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,166
Life is short, make it sweet.

566
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,958
Finally, the work has to happen 
and be completed, isn't it?

567
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,208
Sorry, but who is this?  
 And why are you interrupting our call?

568
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,125
-I'm nuclear physicist, Doctor-- 
-Who is this--

569
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:22,083
The boy is from Tirunelveli. 
My town.

570
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,916
Poor thing. And he apologized profusely.

571
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,625
I felt bad for him. 
That's why I stepped in, kanna.

572
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,375
Sorry.

573
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,125
Don't worry.  
 The call is over anyway.

574
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:37,833
That was beautiful.

575
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,458
And Manikandan was being  
 really annoying anyway.

576
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,416
Who was that?  
 That was your grandfather, is it?

577
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43,958
Please thank him on our behalf.

578
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,083
That was godsent.

579
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,875
Okay, he's calling.  
 I'll call you back.

580
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,250
Why the trouble, kanna?

581
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,958
You are already swamped 
with a lot of work.

582
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,833
You don't have to cook too.

583
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,750
We'll make some other arrangements.

584
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,083
I love to cook.

585
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,916
I have to eat also, anyway.

586
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,750
Sorry, kanna.

587
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,666
I embarrassed you yesterday.

588
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,500
It's okay.

589
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:19,708
It's just that...

590
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,875
...it's been so long since 
I heard so many voices in this house.

591
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,875
It felt like all those people were here...

592
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,208
...sitting in our hall...

593
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,416
...talking, making noise.

594
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,125
So, I got carried away.

595
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,166
I fixed your router.

596
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,458
It's upstairs, in the room.

597
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,833
It's working, I checked it.

598
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,625
Wow, that's incredible.

599
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,041
You know how to fix a router?

600
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,000
Looks like it.

601
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,041
You know, at the Atomic Research Center...

602
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,958
...I've only handled 
radioactive material...

603
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,166
...and some national secrets.

604
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,333
I fiddled with this for a bit 
and it started working.

605
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,125
You can peacefully work 
in your room now.

606
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,541
Without any disturbance.

607
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,166
Most importantly, 
without me disturbing you.

608
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,208
Tomato, Vitamin C.

609
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,666
What happened, kanna? 
The router's not working again?

610
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,416
It works. But I like it here.

611
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,750
That's why...

612
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,750
Unless you want me to 
work in my room.

613
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,125
No, no. Not at all.

614
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:34,916
Please work from here.

615
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,416
In fact, I enjoy the entertainment 
your office calls provide.

616
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,625
Don't bother about the headphones. 
Please speak aloud.

617
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,791
Animal Planet is the only channel  
 that isn't talking about corona.

618
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,458
Yeah, yeah. I'm connecting.

619
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,625
The team video calls is the new Bigg Boss.

620
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,166
Solid entertainment.

621
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:57,708
So says...

622
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,666
...my thaatha.

623
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,958
So, you've played Ludo?

624
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,458
Have I played Ludo? Ha!

625
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,041
I'm a champion.

626
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,750
Actually, it's all about 
the mathematical law of averages.

627
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,083
Apply it and keep winning.

628
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,875
Your amma could never beat me...

629
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,916
She really misses you.

630
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,625
Amma...

631
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,250
You shouldn't have cut her off.

632
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,541
Just because she married a man 
you didn't approve of.

633
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,041
Thaatha, was it because 
he was your lab assistant?

634
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,500
Or because he was 
from a different caste?

635
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,250
I am a scientist, my dear.

636
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,291
Social constructs don't matter to me.

637
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:33,791
Then, what happened?

638
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,916
Why have you made him the villain?

639
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,541
He is a good husband to her.

640
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,166
To amma.

641
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,708
She is happy with him.

642
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,375
Do you know?

643
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,958
There isn't a thing he wouldn't do 
for his daughters.

644
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,458
But he didn't do everything for mine.

645
00:42:58,666 --> 00:42:59,708
Sorry, da.

646
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,666
Sorry.

647
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,375
Kanna, can I come up, da?

648
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,375
Yes, thaatha.

649
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,916
Come, join me for tea.

650
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:25,833
-Sure. 
-Hold this.

651
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,041
Have your tea, kanna.

652
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:40,500
I was working with Kalam sir.

653
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,708
I was in a good position.

654
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:49,041
But, I resigned that job 
and came here...

655
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,083
...to the city.

656
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:55,166
Your grandmother... 
God bless her soul.

657
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,791
...would often joke and say...

658
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:02,541
..."you stop being practical 
only when it comes to your daughter."

659
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,541
My daughter.

660
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,458
Your mother.

661
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,500
She had an amazing voice.

662
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,958
Like the Gods were singing through her.

663
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,416
The voice of an angel.

664
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,416
I would often say that.

665
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,750
Confidently, with pride.

666
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,666
All I ever wanted was 
for everyone to hear her voice.

667
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,375
And I was right.

668
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:47,958
I know.

669
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,208
She was spectacular.

670
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,208
I was a pioneer in my field.

671
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,583
I've received many awards.

672
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,916
But when your mother sang on stage...

673
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:12,291
...watching the audience applaud 
as she wowed them...

674
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:24,125
...I found life's purpose.

675
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,166
I felt relevant.

676
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:31,875
Do you understand?

677
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,833
I wish I had recorded her voice.

678
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,083
I wish I had, back then.

679
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,458
What's your WhatsApp profile 
status, kanna?

680
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,291
"A.R. Rahman.

681
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:59,375
Thank you very much 
for being born in my lifetime.

682
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,166
Thank you for the music.

683
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,375
For, in it is my will to live." 
Right?

684
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,750
What if someone in Rahman's 
life had stolen him from the world?

685
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:16,541
From you.

686
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,958
From the millions of fans that boy has.

687
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:28,625
And the joy you get from his music 
was never to be known or heard.

688
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,041
My dad is a good man.

689
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,250
He loves amma.

690
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:43,208
But he snuffed out my daughter's voice 
with his love.

691
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,250
I know my dad.

692
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:49,625
That's not him.

693
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,791
You may know your dad.

694
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,166
But you don't know the man she married.

695
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:59,916
The family she married into.

696
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,875
They are good people. 
All of them, I know.

697
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:13,708
I know that a girl must eventually 
get married and go to her in-laws'.

698
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:22,041
But why should I have to lose her voice?

699
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:26,000
Why should the world lose it?

700
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,500
Is it right to cage a koel's voice?

701
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:45,958
When I lost her, I lost my will to live 
in the outside world.

702
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,916
So, I locked myself up here.

703
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:53,791
And I've never said that 
I don't want to see your mother, kanna.

704
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,083
But...

705
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,041
...I believe it's your mother 
who can no longer face me.

706
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:09,041
Sorry, kanna.

707
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,083
I don't want to make you cry.

708
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,166
Don't cry, dear.

709
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:16,666
Please don't cry.

710
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,416
Kanna.

711
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,875
Sit here, kanna.

712
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:37,333
The lockdown is over. 
They're letting us step out.

713
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:39,291
I spoke to Mary.

714
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:41,166
She said she will be here on Monday.

715
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:46,041
It was so nice to have you around, kanna.

716
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,375
You are a lot like your mother.

717
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:52,208
And a little like you.

718
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:58,750
I asked her why.

719
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:05,166
She said that given a choice 
between my dad...

720
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,916
...and everything else in the world...

721
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,333
...she would choose my dad. 
Always.

722
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:18,583
I don't know if she said that 
because it was me asking.

723
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,208
Perhaps if you asked her, 
you'd get an honest answer.

724
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,208
But it's also not fair that 
she let us believe...

725
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,500
...you didn't want to be 
a part of our lives.

726
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:36,375
Not fair at all.

727
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:39,041
Your mother...

728
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:44,291
...wants you to believe 
that your father is a good man.

729
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,833
Flawless and perfect.

730
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,875
There's nothing wrong with that.

731
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,291
But I wonder...

732
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:59,666
...where she got that idea from.

733
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,333
Right-o.

734
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,083
Can I make some tea for you?

735
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,375
Actually, I have something for you.

736
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,833
Ready.

737
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,125
Discovering.

738
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:22,083
Pairing successful.

739
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,125
How did you get this?

740
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:21,958
Not important how.

741
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,458
More important why.

742
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,250
Be my messenger, kanna  
 Take this message to my father

743
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:44,750
Be my messenger, kanna  
 Take this message to my father

744
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:50,708
I tried with all my might  
 To touch the vast sky

745
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,750
I stretched out my branches  
 And grew as tall as I could

746
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:56,666
But didn't get uprooted

747
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,458
Yes, I found love

748
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:02,583
Even after time has dissolved

749
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:05,625
Even after the distance has doubled

750
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:09,458
To let him know that  
 My affection has not wavered...

751
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:15,250
...Kanna, be my messenger  
 Take this message to my father

752
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:21,375
Kanna, be my messenger  
 Let him know the truth

753
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,125
Lockdown is over, thaatha.

754
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:29,416
Want to step out into the world?

755
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,916
-Wait, I'll take it for you. 
-No, please don't worry about it.

756
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,500
-No, I'll take it. You talk to thaatha. 
-It's okay, I'll take it.

757
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,541
-You please take care of him. 
-Of course.

758
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,166
-Please take care of him. 
-Sure.

759
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,250
Thank you.

760
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,375
Thaatha's here.

761
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:18,333
Dear, there are some clothes upstairs. 
Didn't you pack fully?

762
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,833
I was thinking of visiting often. 
You don't want me to?

763
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:23,666
Hey, come on! 
Of course, you should.

764
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,416
Especially on Wednesdays.

765
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,125
You see, I don't want to miss 
that sales team call. Okay?

766
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:33,291
I know mom and dad will be back soon. 
But still, stay safe.

767
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,958
I haven't said this to anyone.

768
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,666
But today, I feel like saying it.

769
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,166
God bless you, my dear.

770
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,666
Thank you, thaatha.

771
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,208
Careful. Wear a mask.

772
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,416
Yes.

773
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:01,791
Be my messenger, kanna

774
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:05,541
Let him know my truth

775
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,791
I'll be back soon.

776
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,583
COFFEE, ANYONE?

777
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,375
Surprise!

778
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,250
Hey, Paapu! I didn't know that 
you were coming!

779
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,750
That's the surprise!

780
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,000
You and your childish pranks!

781
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,833
-Hello, Dad. 
-Welcome, Valli.

782
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:02,416
Welcome to India, sister.

783
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,500
Shall we go, Ganapathy?

784
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,791
How did the quarantine go?

785
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,208
Delhi was the quarantine center 
for the London resident.

786
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,458
And Cochin, for the Dubai resident.

787
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:13,791
What are you saying, Dad?

788
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,500
If my sister, Valli opens 
her third eye...

789
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,125
...people in quarantine will run and hide!

790
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,250
What do you mean?

791
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,625
To come home and see my parents...

792
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,041
...I can manage anything!

793
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,708
Shall we go directly to the hospital or 
is it only tomorrow?

794
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,333
What did you say?

795
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:32,708
Mum!

796
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,458
Visiting hours would be over by now.

797
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,625
And there could be restrictions.

798
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:37,916
Then tomorrow, is it?

799
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,458
Let's see.

800
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,500
Where is Ramya? Has she come?

801
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,875
Will she come?

802
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:48,458
It's been a year since Ramya and 
her mother spoke to each other.

803
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,958
And to think she stays the closest, 
in Mumbai!

804
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,791
How can we do this without Ramya, Dad?

805
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:55,916
Don't you call her?

806
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,333
She doesn't answer my calls.

807
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,833
I let her be!

808
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,500
Why is she angry with you?

809
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,666
This is the problem with a late child.

810
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,791
She's been spoilt silly.

811
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,458
She lives like a gypsy!

812
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,625
This fight with mum is unnecessary!

813
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,083
Let her come. I'll deal with her!

814
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,750
Mum's the queen of our house!

815
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,458
Tamil poet! And, an orator!

816
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:19,000
Mrs. Soundara Mahendran!

817
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,083
In a few days, it's her 75th birthday!

818
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:29,291
But now, she is in a hospital. 
Speechless, and unconscious!

819
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,333
She is on life support.

820
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:32,666
I can't bear it.

821
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,208
Also...

822
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:36,916
...how is this possible, Dad?

823
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,000
For two months, 
she has been in the ICU!

824
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,083
Saras.

825
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,166
What is this, Dad?

826
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,666
What have you done?

827
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:41,916
How did they discharge her?

828
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:43,708
Where is her life support?

829
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,458
Where is the ventilator?

830
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:47,666
How will mum survive, Dad?

831
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:52,500
I brought her home ten days back!

832
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:57,541
I set an alarm at 4:00 a.m. 
every day to call you.

833
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:00,291
You told me she had to be in the ICU 
for four more weeks.

834
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,625
Why have you brought her home?

835
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,625
Where is the nasal feeding tube?

836
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,250
Where's the oxygen supply?

837
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,750
I've got an oximeter.

838
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,583
Her saturation levels are fine.

839
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:16,458
The NG tube is not necessary.

840
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,541
I haven't starved your mother.

841
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,250
She is on PEG feeding.

842
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,125
Mum stays with me!

843
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:25,500
No more ICU.

844
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,666
Stay here if you can show her some love.

845
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:34,958
If not, please leave.

846
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,416
I shall take care of her.

847
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,125
Dad's being stubborn.

848
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,041
-Not sure if he'll listen! 
-Tell me.

849
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,958
Caused by brain stem hemorrhage.

850
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:55,416
Two percent recovery rate in the UK.

851
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,500
Yes.

852
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,625
She looks pretty normal, 
her eyes are open.

853
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,208
-But lacks focus. 
-What is it? Pontine, is it?

854
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,916
Pontine stroke? How do you spell it?

855
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,541
-P-O-N-- 
-No, what kind is it?

856
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:09,250
No, it doesn't seem like that. 
They say it's locked-in syndrome.

857
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,041
How could this happen suddenly? 
Could it be due to hypertension?

858
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:13,041
Okay.

859
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,041
Should we take a second opinion?

860
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,541
They are all going to say the same thing.

861
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,541
Not in front of her!

862
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,458
Dad, I'm not raising my voice.

863
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,458
I am not even angry.

864
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,083
I am calm.

865
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,250
Mum should be in the hospital, 
under the care of the doctors.

866
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,041
Home remedies will not suffice.

867
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,875
I followed your advice until now.

868
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:51,375
Enough!

869
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:55,333
Dad, sister and I have 
done our homework.

870
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,750
Look! She has done a complete research.

871
01:00:58,291 --> 01:00:59,791
We have a plan in place, Dad.

872
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,541
Darling, this is not your PhD thesis.

873
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,458
I was there, watching her suffer!

874
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,708
Only after coming home, 
I see my old Soundara.

875
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,458
Mom won't get cured at home.

876
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,500
Please, Dad. This is not right.

877
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:23,916
What is right, what is wrong? 
Who is to decide?

878
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:26,708
And if it were right... for whom?

879
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,916
For you? Me? Or her?

880
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,416
This is how I plan  
 to take care of my wife.

881
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,541
Help me if you can... or just let me be.

882
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,375
SISTER VALLI

883
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:10,500
It's ringing.

884
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,000
Hi, sis!

885
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:38,416
The two of us have reached. 
Why are you not here?

886
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:41,250
Mum asked me to leave, for good!

887
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,541
Why would I come?

888
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,083
Mum's in a coma.

889
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,458
I know. Locked-in syndrome.

890
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,625
-Dad's called you numerous times. 
-I didn't answer.

891
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,750
Why didn't you?

892
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,083
He's your father.

893
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:58,041
What was the need to have me 
at the age of 48?

894
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,375
I was a mistake. 
Just an accident. Just a slip.

895
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,166
I shouldn't have been born.

896
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,583
Don't be melodramatic.

897
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,750
Can you just forget it and let go?

898
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,958
You both are at fault.

899
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,166
You just pandered 
to everything mum said.

900
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,625
It worked well for you. 
Not for me!

901
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,625
Why did you quit your high paying  
 bank job and leave to Mumbai?

902
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:20,916
Because it was bloody suffocating!

903
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I would've died!

904
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,458
But you were brilliant!

905
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,583
By now, you would have reached the top.

906
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:28,583
Yeah! This is exactly what mum said.

907
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,500
I quit my job, she yelled at me.

908
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,916
She humiliated me and 
threw me out of the house!

909
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,083
And so, I left.

910
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,708
I struggled like an orphan in Mumbai. 
Do you know that?

911
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,333
Anyway, if mum can be this adamant... 
I can be too!

912
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:43,916
Ramya, grow up!

913
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:48,916
Well, you grew up. 
Just the way wished for.

914
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,625
All tall and wise.

915
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,333
Are you both happy in life?

916
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:55,333
Sweetie, this is mum's 75th birthday!

917
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,416
And both her favorite daughters  
 are with her.

918
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,625
She does not need me!

919
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:03,083
Enough with the sob stories.

920
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,291
My sister, Valli... it was you who 
brought me up!

921
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,875
If you are down in a coma, let me know. 
I'll stay beside and nurse you.

922
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,666
Ramya, this is not the time to misbehave.

923
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,791
Okay, I have to go. 
I have a recording. Bye.

924
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:22,458
Sweetie, it's okay if you don't come. 
At least call on mum's birthday.

925
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,000
For dad's sake, call.

926
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,333
Okay, bye. 
Bye. I've got to go.

927
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,666
Say that you will call!

928
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:29,958
Okay.

929
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,250
Why are you in such a hurry?

930
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,250
I've got to go. Bye. Bye.

931
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:55,208
No match for your coffee!

932
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,333
What did we name your coffee?

933
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,958
Kalikkam, the potion.

934
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:00,583
So strong!

935
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:03,291
Almost poison!

936
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,166
But the good kind!

937
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,166
The potion that wakes everyone up.

938
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,208
Hot and strong!

939
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:12,833
Just like you!

940
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,583
Sister?

941
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,833
Any issues at Rahul's school? 
Did they call?

942
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,875
-Did Anand pick him up after work? 
-Hold on!

943
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,083
This is Madras. Not Lancaster.

944
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,208
Come, you jet lag queen!

945
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:33,625
Soundara, guess what's happening  
 out in the world?

946
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,166
Thanks to the lockdown, everyone 
is stuck at home.

947
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:40,083
The dogs are rejoicing that the  
 masters are with them.

948
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,625
And the cats are frustrated that 
they're not leaving home.

949
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,625
Both are pets.

950
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,916
But see how different they are?

951
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:05,750
Sister.

952
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,541
My dearest Soundara!

953
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,791
What are your thoughts on becoming 
a grandmother again?

954
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,416
So many years...

955
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,416
...and so many disappointments.

956
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,625
I will be late, but it will be 
a false alarm!

957
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,708
So many Gravindex tests 
and numerous IVF trials...

958
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,000
But now, out of the blue...

959
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,125
Mum, it happened!

960
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,833
I'm going to have a baby!

961
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:12,541
Is this what they call a miracle?

962
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:16,000
You conceived Ramya late. Right?

963
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:21,291
But, isn't she the brightest star 
of us three?

964
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,166
Now, wait and watch.

965
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,833
This late comer will also be a bright one.

966
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,083
Will you?

967
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:56,041
Just the way you used to do 
before my science exams.

968
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,416
Bless us both!

969
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:02,208
Oh, God!

970
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,791
I look hideous!

971
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,083
Mum!

972
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:11,833
Mum...

973
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,458
...can you hear me?

974
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,500
Mum, your hand...

975
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:19,708
Mom, can you hear me?

976
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:22,458
Can you hear me, Mum?

977
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,250
Your hand...

978
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,541
Saras.

979
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:26,833
What's with you?

980
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,916
Mum's hand was there. 
Now it's come down here.

981
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,416
Have you gone mad?

982
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,125
Isn't it enough that dad has 
gone cuckoo, and now you?

983
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,041
What's this on your forehead?

984
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,708
What's with the laughter?

985
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,500
-Why are you grinning? 
-Dad is here.

986
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:45,958
-What? 
-Come.

987
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:47,875
Do you realize what you're doing?

988
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,333
You're talking to mum, just like dad.

989
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,541
What's happened to you?

990
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:54,583
Dad will now happily sit 
on his high horse.

991
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:56,333
I love you, my grumpy sister.

992
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,416
Hey! Stop it!

993
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,625
Two pink lines! Positive!

994
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,666
-Oh, my-- 
-Social distancing!

995
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,750
Oh, my God!

996
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:09,458
One, two, three...

997
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:11,041
Let's celebrate...

998
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,041
You gave us...

999
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:16,791
...the gift of joy and love...

1000
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,500
Let's celebrate...

1001
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,208
You gave us...

1002
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:23,958
...the gift of joy and love...

1003
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,958
Let's celebrate...

1004
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,791
You gave us...

1005
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:31,625
...the gift of joy and love...

1006
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,500
Oh, my child!

1007
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,000
"A street slang names an ancient 
Tamil literature."

1008
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:44,958
The first letter is "I", ends with "T".

1009
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,541
Naladiyar?

1010
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,083
Doesn't match with street slang!

1011
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:53,958
What could it be?

1012
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,291
What? Do you know?

1013
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,625
Inna Narpathu.

1014
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:03,041
See? I cracked it before you.

1015
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,958
We've been doing these crosswords 
together for years.

1016
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,458
A pointless job.

1017
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:12,041
But, we will fight over the newspaper 
to solve it.

1018
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,958
You would read the clues, and 
I'd figure out all the words.

1019
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:20,583
Alright. I'd figure out half of it.

1020
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,416
No? One-third?

1021
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,833
Dad, how's the pudding coming along?

1022
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,083
Sweetly, my daughter!

1023
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:32,916
Hey!

1024
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,875
-Don't add egg in the cake. 
-Oh!

1025
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,833
Mum doesn't like eggs.

1026
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:37,916
Okay.

1027
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:38,958
-Sister. 
-Yes.

1028
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,041
You tell him.

1029
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,458
-Me? 
-You're dad's pet.

1030
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:44,833
How do I do it?

1031
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,250
Dad...

1032
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,416
...Saras and I have spoken to the doctor.

1033
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:55,083
They will send an ambulance 
and take her in.

1034
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:56,083
No.

1035
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,416
Dad, this is not right.

1036
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,333
If something happens to mum...

1037
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:02,708
...the guilt will kill us.

1038
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,208
What do you want to do?

1039
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,666
Plug machines into her body?

1040
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,833
I've given her my word.

1041
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:12,541
She doesn't have to be 
treated like an object.

1042
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,500
I can't watch her suffer!

1043
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:19,375
Are you sure she is not 
suffering right now?

1044
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,708
What if she falls down? Who's responsible?

1045
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,416
We are not equipped for this.

1046
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,916
Sister... your phone.

1047
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,708
-Dad... what she's-- 
-Shut up!

1048
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,333
Hey, Anand!

1049
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,541
What's this, Anand?

1050
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,541
How can they do this suddenly?  
 They're changing?

1051
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,458
I am in India now. Can't you talk?

1052
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,458
Give the phone to the head teacher.  
 I'll talk.

1053
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:46,708
Yes, Ms. Parker.

1054
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,375
Surely the fact that 
I'm a full time mum, should help.

1055
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:51,541
You do have a point.

1056
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,666
But honestly it's too soon 
to take the decision.

1057
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,291
But ma'am...

1058
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,500
...we don't have a choice, do we?

1059
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes, I do. Thank you.

1060
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,000
What happened?

1061
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,166
They called from Rahul's school.

1062
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:22,750
He is not able to focus on anything 
except music and sports.

1063
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,333
He's dyslexic, Dad.

1064
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:30,166
They want to move him to a special school.

1065
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,166
This wouldn't have happened in this house.

1066
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,208
Mum wouldn't have let it come this far.

1067
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,833
She would have sensed it earlier.

1068
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:43,250
I missed it.

1069
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:45,875
We were both busy at work.

1070
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,208
And didn't spend enough time with Rahul.

1071
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,541
We left him with babysitters and 
ruined his future.

1072
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:54,583
Look here.

1073
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm an older version of Rahul.

1074
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,708
My grandson has taken after me.

1075
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,875
I didn't even go to school 
till the fourth grade.

1076
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:04,500
Words made no sense.

1077
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,000
Alphabets would dance out of the page.

1078
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,708
Words would flip around. 
I couldn't understand a thing!

1079
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,208
My education was purely auditory.

1080
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:15,750
I faltered... made blunders, 
but somehow I learnt.

1081
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:17,791
What did you say it was called?

1082
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,458
-Dyslexia. 
-Yes, your father was dyslexic too.

1083
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,083
But they hadn't coined the term back then.

1084
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:27,375
Great scholars were like my 
grandson and me.

1085
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,041
Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking.

1086
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:33,291
Don't worry my, daughter. 
Everything will be alright.

1087
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:34,916
Wait.

1088
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,291
Selfie!

1089
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:38,458
Mum?

1090
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,583
We'll take one more with mum.

1091
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,833
-Yes. Okay. 
-Why you taking so long?

1092
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,458
-Wait. 
-Is mum ready?

1093
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:46,875
Ready.

1094
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,041
Three, two...

1095
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,625
Valli... look here.

1096
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:54,916
Three, two, smile.

1097
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,458
Very good! Superb!

1098
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,458
What a lovely shot!

1099
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,458
I should also be optimistic like dad.

1100
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,333
Can I try talking to you?

1101
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:58,625
Can you hear me?

1102
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:03,750
I can't sleep.

1103
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,250
Can I be next to you for a while?

1104
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:08,375
Do you hear me?

1105
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:11,041
When Saras was taking the selfie...

1106
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,541
...I thought I saw your eyes move.

1107
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,125
Were you aware of us?

1108
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:21,333
I need you.

1109
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,125
We all need you.

1110
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:44,583
Dad.

1111
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,541
Ramya is calling.

1112
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:49,333
I thought she wouldn't.

1113
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,958
-Ramya's on call. 
-Give it to me.

1114
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:54,291
Hello, Dad!

1115
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,875
-Ramya. 
 -How are you, Dad?

1116
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:57,833
Just a minute.

1117
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,833
Dad, I've got to go.  
 Just tell mum that I wished her.

1118
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:01,833
Wait!

1119
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,750
Dad.

1120
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:18,583
Mum.

1121
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,708
Can you see me?

1122
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:27,166
It's 12 o'clock, Mum. 
Happy birthday!

1123
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,416
You don't wish to see me, is it?

1124
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,708
Is that why you're like this?

1125
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,583
Mum, say something.

1126
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,750
Please say something.

1127
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,041
Maybe a poem?

1128
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:56,750
Yell at me. 
Tell me I caused your doom.

1129
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:02,375
It's been so long since I saw you.

1130
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,625
I missed you.

1131
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:08,458
I've missed you my whole life.

1132
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,250
But I'm in a good place now.

1133
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:13,541
I'm happy!

1134
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:15,583
You brought me up well.

1135
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:20,333
You would chase me around with a cane 
and send me to music classes.

1136
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,375
I owe you a lot.

1137
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,166
Because of you, I found my joy in life!

1138
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,125
How did you do it?

1139
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:32,375
You have raised 
all three of us into strong...

1140
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,291
...and independent women!

1141
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,000
It's a miracle!

1142
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:43,166
All three of us 
are different versions of you.

1143
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,958
That's probably why I can't apologize.

1144
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,875
But I say it from within.

1145
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,750
Only you can't hear it.

1146
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:54,500
You're always with me, Mum.

1147
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:06,375
O my lord

1148
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,625
O wanderer

1149
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,041
Mum's hand...

1150
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,708
Sister.

1151
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,333
Did you see?

1152
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,000
Dad, mum's...

1153
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:14,291
Soundara

1154
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,541
My dear, Soundara

1155
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:20,125
Happy birthday to you

1156
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:25,208
It's your birthday today  
 It's a bright day

1157
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:29,125
It's the day when we forget all

1158
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:32,041
Our worries, like children do

1159
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:35,875
Happy birthday to you

1160
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,666
Soundara... where are you?

1161
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:51,791
Dad.

1162
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,083
Dad.

1163
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:05,791
Dad.

1164
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:08,416
Dad.

1165
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:47,583
Is it alright?

1166
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,000
Needs more milk!

1167
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,000
-It needs-- 
-Does it need more milk?

1168
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,125
The aroma is so good!

1169
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,291
Whose coffee is it, after all?

1170
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,791
Mum.

1171
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,875
What's this!

1172
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,291
Coffee...

1173
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,750
Coffee, anyone?

1174
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:50,958
REUNION

1175
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:26,375
Who is it?

1176
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,416
Aunt Bhairavi?

1177
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:29,708
It's me, Sadhana...

1178
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,125
...Vikram's school friend.

1179
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,083
We will rock you!

1180
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,541
You used to sing Western music!

1181
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:39,291
You used to drag Vikram along 
to school culturals.

1182
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:41,875
It's the same Sadhana!

1183
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,625
You have a great memory.

1184
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,458
What's with the surprise visit?

1185
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:48,541
My bike broke down.

1186
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,583
I'm so sorry to barge 
in like this.

1187
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:51,791
Oh, please come in.

1188
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:54,291
-I shouldn't have kept you waiting! 
-Thank you.

1189
01:22:58,083 --> 01:22:59,041
Oh, God!

1190
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,708
I used to tell Vikram's father 
all the time...

1191
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,875
...that you will go places.

1192
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,791
I haven't gone anywhere!

1193
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:09,000
I sing on the weekends 
at the Blue Lotus Hotel bar.

1194
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:09,916
Nice!

1195
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,083
Just trying to book 
a cab, Auntie. Sorry.

1196
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,125
My cab requests are getting canceled.

1197
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,250
Don't worry.

1198
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,458
Vikram will be home shortly.

1199
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:21,916
He will drop you home.

1200
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,291
-Sure? 
-Of course!

1201
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:24,750
Where is Vikram?

1202
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:31,916
Check the vitals.

1203
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,500
Yes, Ma? 
I saw six missed calls from you!

1204
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:39,666
Are you okay now?

1205
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,708
Yes, I am okay.

1206
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,083
I was cleaning up the kitchen.

1207
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:46,750
Why did you have to do it? 
You have domestic help!

1208
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:50,875
All of them have left 
fearing the lockdown.

1209
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,708
Don't worry, I'm on the way. 
Do you need anything?

1210
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:55,083
I don't need anything.

1211
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,166
Your friend is waiting for you though.

1212
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,375
Which friend?

1213
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:06,541
Hey, Sadhana!

1214
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,958
-Vikram! 
-What a pleasant surprise!

1215
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:12,125
Sorry, man. 
My bike just...

1216
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,458
Oh, come on. 
No problem at all!

1217
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,333
Just give me five minutes. 
I'll get ready.

1218
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,375
Sure.

1219
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,416
By the way... you look different.

1220
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:21,625
-Oh! 
-Suits you.

1221
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,958
And you look like a geek, as always!

1222
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,083
Wait, I'll be back.

1223
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:38,833
Sadhana, can I get you 
something to drink?

1224
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,208
No, thanks, Auntie.

1225
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,958
You said you worked at a bar.

1226
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,250
Food and drinks must be 
free for you, right?

1227
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,791
No, Auntie. 
Only snacks and soft drinks.

1228
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,750
We need to pay for other drinks.

1229
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:59,708
They make really good cocktails.

1230
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,041
Mojito...

1231
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:02,750
...cosmopolitan.

1232
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:03,833
Yeah.

1233
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:11,166
Hello, Sister?

1234
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,375
-Doctor.  
-Yes.

1235
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,416
The ulna fixation patient,  
 Jitendra Prasad--

1236
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,833
Yeah, I wanted him to be shifted 
to the government hospital.

1237
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:17,750
Is he okay?

1238
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:19,583
Sir, they called from the hospital.

1239
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,583
The patient has gone into distress.

1240
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,166
They suspect it is COVID-19.

1241
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,625
What?

1242
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:27,416
COVID?

1243
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,000
-Hi, Sadhana. 
-Hey!

1244
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:35,791
I don't think I can come down.

1245
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,541
I just got a call.

1246
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,375
I think I may be exposed to COVID.

1247
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:41,875
COVID?

1248
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:44,458
Oh, shucks! 
I'm sorry to hear that, Viks.

1249
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:45,875
Are you okay?

1250
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:48,083
I think one of my patients got infected.

1251
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:50,083
So, all of us who came in contact 
with him...

1252
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,708
...be it me, the nurses, attenders...

1253
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:55,083
...we have to self-quarantine ourselves 
for 14 days.

1254
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,125
Oh, no!

1255
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,375
What are you saying?

1256
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:58,833
How are we going to manage?

1257
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,750
I'll make some arrangements.

1258
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:01,875
Don't worry. 
Just relax.

1259
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:03,416
Please sit down and rest, Ma.

1260
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:09,125
My mother falls under 
the high-risk category.

1261
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,000
Diabetes. Osteoarthritis.

1262
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,458
I don't know what to do.

1263
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:13,916
Okay.

1264
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,958
Listen, you have enough going on. 
Don't worry about me.

1265
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:17,916
You take care.

1266
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:19,333
I'll get home somehow.

1267
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,375
Where are you going now?

1268
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:24,000
Well, I have to pick up my bags, and...

1269
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:26,375
...I need to catch a bus 
and go to my mother's place.

1270
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,000
All okay?

1271
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,750
Why all of a sudden, 
that too during a lockdown?

1272
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:31,666
It's just...

1273
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,500
...some flatmate issues, rent...

1274
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:36,291
Nothing serious.

1275
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:38,250
My mom also felt...

1276
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:40,750
...it's not safe for me to stay alone 
in Chennai at this time.

1277
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:42,750
So, just going home.

1278
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,875
-See you. 
-Just a thought...

1279
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,250
...why do you have to travel 
on a crowded bus and risk it now?

1280
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,333
Don't do it.

1281
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:55,583
Why don't you...

1282
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,916
...stay here with us?

1283
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,250
Just for a few days!

1284
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,125
Are you kidding?

1285
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:03,291
You are most welcome to stay with us.

1286
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,583
Are you serious?

1287
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:07,125
Come on.

1288
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,333
This is safer than buses and crowds.

1289
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,666
Sadhana, do you want to 
sleep on the bed?

1290
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,208
No, Auntie. 
This is just fine.

1291
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:27,833
Hello, Ma?

1292
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:29,708
I am not coming home now.

1293
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,500
I'm staying at my friend, Vikram's place.

1294
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,958
We are not alone. 
His mother is home too.

1295
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:37,625
Okay?

1296
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:38,958
I'll talk to you later.

1297
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:40,458
Good night.

1298
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:04,625
Auntie!

1299
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:07,250
I'm going to cook some awesome biryani!

1300
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:08,583
-Yes! 
-Oh!

1301
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:10,541
Here are the ingredients.

1302
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,458
No, no. 
Give it to me.

1303
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:14,750
Onion.

1304
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,333
And we chop.

1305
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:18,958
-We both have-- 
-Oh, careful!

1306
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,500
Be careful. 
It's really sharp.

1307
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:27,708
Is that smelling good or what?

1308
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,125
It's ready!

1309
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,583
It looks amazing.

1310
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:45,000
Vikram will love this.

1311
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,000
Let's give it to him?

1312
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:47,708
Okay!

1313
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:48,833
Vikram.

1314
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,208
Viks!

1315
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,416
Your food is here.

1316
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,708
Oh, I'm so famished.

1317
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,250
It smells amazing.

1318
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:08,458
So?

1319
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,916
How is it?

1320
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:12,708
The biryani?

1321
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:14,583
Or the chef?

1322
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,416
Superb!

1323
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:22,416
Hey!

1324
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,000
Your nose is bleeding.

1325
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,875
-What? 
-There is blood.

1326
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:29,750
-Are you okay?  
-Oh!

1327
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,166
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

1328
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,708
I just bumped my head in the kitchen.

1329
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:33,791
Are you sure?

1330
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,791
Enjoy your lunch. 
I'm fine. Seriously.

1331
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,833
Hey... the BP apparatus 
is in the cupboard.

1332
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,208
Just take it.

1333
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:29,041
Auntie!

1334
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:31,833
-Shall we play some rummy? 
-Sure!

1335
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,708
So, did you play cards 
with Vikram's father?

1336
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:40,083
Yeah, right!

1337
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:46,125
His life revolved around patients, 
the hospital, and medical books.

1338
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:48,625
What about romance?

1339
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:51,500
It was nonexistent.

1340
01:30:52,916 --> 01:30:56,625
He would do it almost clinically, 
like giving an injection.

1341
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,333
But...

1342
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,958
...he took such good care of me 
for 35 years!

1343
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:08,458
Do you have no plans 
of getting married?

1344
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:10,416
No, Auntie.

1345
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:12,541
My mother asks me all the time too.

1346
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:14,291
What about Vikram?

1347
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,958
I heard there was a girl in college.

1348
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:20,958
Yes, there was this girl called Sam.

1349
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,541
But I think it wasn't too serious.

1350
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,583
-Oh! 
-He never introduced her to us.

1351
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:31,291
Now, his life is all about 
work, work, and work.

1352
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:35,375
He wants to become a better doctor 
than his father and grandfather.

1353
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:39,125
But no social life whatsoever.

1354
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,666
Neither does he have one, nor do I.

1355
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:43,000
Is that so?

1356
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,750
Back in school, 
he was quite the outgoing guy.

1357
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:51,250
When he used to sing with me...

1358
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,541
...a lot of girls had a crush on him.

1359
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:55,750
Seriously? On him?

1360
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:58,541
You'll be surprised.

1361
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:02,833
He scored 91 percent in some exams.

1362
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:08,166
His father, the great Doctor Ramasami...

1363
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:12,166
...belted him for missing out 
on the 97 percent cut-off.

1364
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,791
He stopped singing after that.

1365
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,416
Now, it's all gone.

1366
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:20,250
Poor Vikram!

1367
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:25,416
Actually, he had written some 
pretty terrific poetry.

1368
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,208
Oh, yeah?

1369
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:30,125
-You didn't know? 
-No!

1370
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,208
You know what?

1371
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:36,083
I'm going to get it for you.

1372
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:44,125
Sadhana, what are you doing, huh?

1373
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,958
You were supposed to give 
my mother company, not gossip with her.

1374
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:51,375
"I stared starry-eyed, 
At the stars in the sky."

1375
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,958
Wow! 
Sam must have loved it.

1376
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,666
-Nothing happened. 
-Oh, my god!

1377
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,666
-My stuff. 
-It's just your bag...

1378
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,958
-What am I going to do? 
-What is it?

1379
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:03,041
It's lockdown. 
I can't even get more stuff!

1380
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,416
-What is that powder? 
-That looks like cocaine, Ma.

1381
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:12,666
Drugs!

1382
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,541
-Auntie, pen! A pen! 
-Pen?

1383
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:24,750
Pen, paper, something.

1384
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:25,958
-What for? 
-Auntie.

1385
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:27,791
-You are awesome. 
-Oh, my god!

1386
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:30,791
Everybody...

1387
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,750
Yes, I got it.

1388
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:36,750
Nothing in this whole world  
 Can make me feel the way you do

1389
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:40,958
Taking me up to heaven,  
 Got me trippin' just on you

1390
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,916
Feeling my body over  
 Just the way you like me to

1391
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:48,833
Doing it your way, my way,  
 Every way that we want to

1392
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:52,916
Don't stop  
 Got me addicted

1393
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:56,875
You know, I like it wicked!

1394
01:33:57,416 --> 01:34:00,958
So smooth, got me hypnotized

1395
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,416
On days, oh yeah  
 You see it in my eyes

1396
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,958
Don't stop  
 Don't, don't, don't stop

1397
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,208
Don't stop

1398
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,708
Don't, don't, don't stop

1399
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:14,041
Come on, sing it with me!

1400
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:17,083
Don't stop  
 Don't, don't, don't stop

1401
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:19,416
Don't stop!

1402
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:21,208
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

1403
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:22,541
Don't stop!

1404
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,916
Don't stop!

1405
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:43,958
Vikram?

1406
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,333
Yeah?

1407
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,458
She has been asleep for such a long time!

1408
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:48,958
Ma, please check on her.

1409
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,666
How do I do that?

1410
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:52,791
She seems okay.

1411
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,541
No, Ma, we need to check her 
blood pressure and pulse.

1412
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,708
Please, you have to do it.

1413
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:01,041
She is your friend. 
You do it!

1414
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,666
You were the one who wanted company!

1415
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,583
Vikram!

1416
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,500
Ma, please. 
I can't come down.

1417
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,625
At least splash some water 
on her face.

1418
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:12,666
Yeah.

1419
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,708
The pulse oximeter is in the drawer.

1420
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:17,250
Yes.

1421
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:19,375
-This thing? 
-That's the one.

1422
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:20,500
Just clip it on her finger.

1423
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,666
Auntie.

1424
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,583
91.87.

1425
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:27,625
Okay.

1426
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:29,208
-Is that fine? 
-That's good.

1427
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:30,375
-Yes. 
-It's good.

1428
01:35:31,083 --> 01:35:32,000
What happened?

1429
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:35,833
Don't worry.

1430
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,250
-Sorry. 
-You are okay. I am here for you.

1431
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,083
I'm here.

1432
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:19,458
Ma.

1433
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:21,833
What?

1434
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:29,458
Negative!

1435
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,208
You don't have corona.

1436
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,416
Thank God!

1437
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,208
Now, I am here for you.

1438
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,333
Sorry, I fucked up...

1439
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,500
...in front of your mom.

1440
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:06,416
It's okay!

1441
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,875
But, how did you get into this?

1442
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,791
You wouldn't understand.

1443
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,750
Because my dreams were just 
too big for me.

1444
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,125
When we started this 
event management company...

1445
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:23,375
...we were working 18 hours a day.

1446
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,875
I just needed the coke.

1447
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,208
It was like fuel.

1448
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:29,625
If I didn't have it, I would--

1449
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,291
You are judging me.

1450
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,333
-I can see it! 
-No.

1451
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:37,583
I know what coke can do, Sadhana.

1452
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,375
Yeah, right! 
What do you know?

1453
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:42,250
It's not like you spent 
your rent money on coke...

1454
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,125
-...and you don't have a home to go to. 
-Hey!

1455
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:45,833
Hey, what do you mean?

1456
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:47,833
Do you think I have no problems?

1457
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,541
I'm sorry.

1458
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,208
It's okay.

1459
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:54,791
Vikram.

1460
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:00,375
Give me something?

1461
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,583
Just diazepam.

1462
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:05,041
-No, Sadhana. 
-Please!

1463
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:07,416
-Just one half! 
-No, I cannot change you--

1464
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,708
I cannot switch you 
from one substance to another.

1465
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:12,125
You're killing me. 
Please, I need it.

1466
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:13,166
No, Sadhana.

1467
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:15,833
I know it's hard. 
But you have to get through this.

1468
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:17,916
Fuck off! 
You stupid nerd.

1469
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:27,833
Even before the corona lockdown...

1470
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:31,583
...this darn arthritis had me 
in a semi-lockdown.

1471
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,166
Hey!

1472
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,125
Why don't you wear a sari too?

1473
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:38,125
Who would want to see me in a sari?

1474
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:39,583
I just came to help you.

1475
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:45,666
If you want to help me, 
go to Doctor Ramasami's bar.

1476
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,666
Get some rum, 
and make me some fresh Mojito?

1477
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:51,416
Really?

1478
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,666
Yeah! It's been a long time.

1479
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,833
Okay, guys. 
Say cheese.

1480
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:00,583
Very nice.

1481
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:02,041
One more.

1482
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,708
Seven days sober!

1483
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,000
-Cheers! 
-Cheers!

1484
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:08,375
Okay.

1485
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:12,166
Sadhana...

1486
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:14,000
...just go easy on the booze, okay?

1487
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:16,833
Stop scolding her, son.

1488
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,541
Like you have never tried 
any of this!

1489
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:21,416
Who, me? 
What do I look like to you?

1490
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:23,958
-Yeah, right! 
-Yeah, right!

1491
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:02,666
No, it's the third left. 
It's a dead-end.

1492
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,916
It's a red brick house. 
You can't miss it.

1493
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:06,708
-Yeah. 
-What's going on?

1494
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:08,708
-I'll call you back. 
-Whom are you talking to?

1495
01:41:08,958 --> 01:41:10,333
-Why are you sneaking up on me? 
-Who was it?

1496
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:11,833
It's a bloody drug dealer, right?

1497
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:14,250
I'm not going to answer that.

1498
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:18,125
Sadhana, it's a fucking chemical. 
It's taken control of you!

1499
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,000
Dude, are you like my savior now?

1500
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:22,333
You took care of me for ten days, 
and you think you are--

1501
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:24,250
You know what?

1502
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:26,541
This is my life.

1503
01:41:26,666 --> 01:41:27,666
My choice.

1504
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,250
I want it.

1505
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:30,416
I'm leaving.

1506
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:31,958
Where will you go during lockdown?

1507
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:33,708
I'll go somewhere. 
Just let me go!

1508
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:41,416
Sadhana, open the door.

1509
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,208
What happened?

1510
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:46,166
-What did you say to her? 
-I didn't do anything!

1511
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,291
I told her to give up her habit. 
Is that wrong?

1512
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:50,416
-Sadhana. 
-Sadhana, come out.

1513
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:52,375
He said it for your own good.

1514
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:54,375
He took such good care of you.

1515
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:55,458
No! I can't do this.

1516
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:58,125
I feel so useless.

1517
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:00,625
I am causing trouble for everyone.

1518
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,500
-Hey! 
-I shouldn't be here anymore.

1519
01:42:02,666 --> 01:42:04,250
Sadhana!

1520
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,750
Sadhana, don't do anything stupid.

1521
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,625
No, please!

1522
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:10,833
No, please let me be. Please!

1523
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,833
Just leave me alone!

1524
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:14,250
I'll get the spare key.

1525
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,458
Sadhana.

1526
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:18,250
Just leave me alone!

1527
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:27,416
In a highland track  
 On a bullock cart

1528
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:34,791
There goes a maiden!

1529
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,375
Why are you singing all wrong?

1530
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:52,750
In a highland track  
 On a bullock cart

1531
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:58,291
There goes a maiden!

1532
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:16,333
On the branch of a mango tree  
 In Manamadurai

1533
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:23,125
Perched was a parakeet which asked me

1534
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:28,083
Are my eyes real pretty?

1535
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:31,125
Are my feathers real pretty?

1536
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:35,666
When posed with this question  
 What would I...

1537
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:37,791
...I sing?

1538
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:52,750
That was superb!

1539
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,041
Your son...

1540
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,875
...he is the real talent.

1541
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:04,875
We must have performed this song 
a hundred times on stage.

1542
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:07,583
And yet, he somehow strived 
to sing it wrong!

1543
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:09,958
You fraud!

1544
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:15,166
But it worked. 
Thanks, I feel better.

1545
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:38,333
Why do you insist?

1546
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,791
You don't trust me.

1547
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:41,708
Of course not!

1548
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,750
You may think you can 
stay away from it.

1549
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:47,041
But with coke, 
a single relapse can--

1550
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,416
Yes, it is hard.

1551
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:49,625
I know.

1552
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:54,208
Look, I don't know what I would have done 
without you and auntie.

1553
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,666
Really!

1554
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:59,708
Despite her arthritis, 
she took such good care of me.

1555
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,333
Physically and emotionally...

1556
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:04,541
...I really needed that support.

1557
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:05,916
Then, why are you leaving?

1558
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,291
Because this is my problem.

1559
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:10,000
I have to face it.

1560
01:45:10,208 --> 01:45:11,833
I'm going to seek professional help.

1561
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:14,375
I've finally found the courage to do that.

1562
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,083
I need to visit my mother.

1563
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:17,625
Reconnect with music.

1564
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:18,875
I have a lot to do.

1565
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:20,416
Auntie!

1566
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:22,333
Hey!

1567
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:27,000
Your music and your laughter 
breathed life into this house.

1568
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:29,250
Can't you stay a little longer?

1569
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:30,250
Oh, no!

1570
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:32,791
Then I'll never be able to say goodbye 
to you and this house.

1571
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:35,458
Viks, you should start singing again.

1572
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:38,083
Auntie, ask him to 
practice a little every day.

1573
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:39,000
Yes.

1574
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,500
His father isn't around anymore. 
So, you can't blame him!

1575
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:44,125
I can't blame my father, fair enough.

1576
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:46,625
-But please don't ruin poetry for me. 
-Oh, buzz off!

1577
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,291
"I stared starry-eyed, 
at the stars in the sky.

1578
01:45:50,916 --> 01:45:52,208
The stars gave me company.

1579
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:53,666
They shone into my eye.

1580
01:45:54,958 --> 01:45:57,416
The stars were foolish, 
they knew not my mind.

1581
01:45:58,666 --> 01:46:00,958
For I was in love 
with the deep blue sky."

1582
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:03,208
That wasn't for Sam.

1583
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:06,250
That was for you, Sadhana.

1584
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:32,833
MIRACLE

1585
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:40,041
Miracle!

1586
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:42,083
When was the last time 
you heard this word?

1587
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,500
With the current happenings...

1588
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:49,458
...you must have given up 
your hope, almost!

1589
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:53,291
Corona is anywhere and everywhere!

1590
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:55,125
Will a miracle happen?

1591
01:46:56,166 --> 01:46:57,166
Can we believe in it?

1592
01:46:58,583 --> 01:46:59,916
Miracles happen.

1593
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:04,166
If you go back to your childhood...

1594
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:07,125
...you might have wanted something...

1595
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:12,083
...and might have cried for it.

1596
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Yeah?

1597
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:16,083
You have got  
 beaten up and slept it off.

1598
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:19,416
When you wake up the next morning...

1599
01:47:20,916 --> 01:47:21,958
So, that's it!

1600
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,166
No way to escape, right?

1601
01:47:24,291 --> 01:47:25,708
That is the power of miracles.

1602
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,958
A relative...

1603
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:33,125
...might suddenly turn up at your house...

1604
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:38,000
...and would have given  
 what you longed for.

1605
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:39,791
Thus, miracles happen!

1606
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,958
Don't share this open secret  
 with anyone.

1607
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:51,125
Neither will they believe you nor  
 will they allow you to believe.

1608
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:02,208
Hidden this open secret within us.

1609
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:07,833
Whoever... finds it...

1610
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,250
...they get all the benefits.

1611
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:14,166
Miracles will happen!

1612
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:19,666
You will see lots of wonders in life,  
 if you believe in miracles.

1613
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:22,750
Miracle! Miracle!

1614
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:25,708
A miracle will happen now!

1615
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:27,875
A miracle will happen today.

1616
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:30,125
A miracle will happen tomorrow.

1617
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:32,125
Miracles happen every--

1618
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:37,458
The corona count  
 in Chennai crosses 500 cases today.

1619
01:48:37,958 --> 01:48:41,166
All necessary precautions are  
 being taken by the government.

1620
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:43,958
The government is extending  
 its full support--

1621
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:48,041
Let's all keep believing in our lives...

1622
01:48:48,125 --> 01:48:52,833
...that a miracle is happening.  
 It will definitely happen.

1623
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:54,458
Miracle! Miracle!

1624
01:48:54,791 --> 01:49:00,458
Hey! That guruji is getting on my nerves.

1625
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:03,708
Switch it off.

1626
01:49:04,875 --> 01:49:05,875
What about you?

1627
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:09,666
You are listening to the COVID updates 
like it is a cricket scoreboard!

1628
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:12,750
You better shut that off 
and prepare lunch!

1629
01:49:14,083 --> 01:49:14,958
Damn you!

1630
01:49:18,458 --> 01:49:19,583
We are left with just 17 bucks.

1631
01:49:20,625 --> 01:49:24,625
Let's hit the streets. Maybe some 
social worker will offer us tamarind rice.

1632
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:31,500
Miracles do happen.  
 If you trust in miracles--

1633
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:32,583
Listen to this.

1634
01:49:32,833 --> 01:49:34,250
You will see lot of wonders.

1635
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:36,041
A miracle will happen. 
Believe it, bro!

1636
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:40,083
Tomorrow our fortune might change 
and shower money upon us!

1637
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,458
Don't push me!

1638
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:46,833
We lie here like a lazy lizard 
and expect money to shower?

1639
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:51,375
What a jerk!

1640
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:57,958
Bro!

1641
01:50:00,333 --> 01:50:02,750
There is a chance of getting 
our hands on some heavy cash!

1642
01:50:04,916 --> 01:50:08,000
I keep telling you but you won't heed me.

1643
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:13,333
What will you do if they find a cure...

1644
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,416
...for corona tomorrow?

1645
01:50:20,583 --> 01:50:21,583
Think about it.

1646
01:50:25,333 --> 01:50:26,208
You're right!

1647
01:50:36,916 --> 01:50:38,250
-Bro! 
-Yes, bro!

1648
01:50:38,333 --> 01:50:40,833
A money launderer.

1649
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,541
He's got loads of black money 
at his office.

1650
01:50:43,916 --> 01:50:45,208
Because of the corona situation...

1651
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:49,333
...he can't stash it at his home 
or in his office.

1652
01:50:49,416 --> 01:50:53,958
So, he split the cash and 
hid it in several old cars.

1653
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:56,541
And parked them across several 
abandoned places in the city.

1654
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:58,750
What? Who told you this?

1655
01:50:58,833 --> 01:51:00,541
A friend of mine!

1656
01:51:01,375 --> 01:51:04,250
The money launderer's business partner's 
close associate's friend!

1657
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:05,875
100 percent true!

1658
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:12,041
Twice a day, 
a person will check on these cars.

1659
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:14,375
Just wait. Someone might come 
to check this car too.

1660
01:51:15,291 --> 01:51:17,041
How much cash is stashed in each car?

1661
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,750
Two to five million.

1662
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:22,041
This is unbelievable! 
Someone has made a fool of you!

1663
01:51:22,958 --> 01:51:26,125
Oh, is that so? Damn you! Let's go back 
to the streets for tamarind rice!

1664
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,750
Silent, bro. Someone's coming.

1665
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:43,833
I told you so.

1666
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:45,375
Idiot!

1667
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:02,125
You're right, bro!

1668
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Bro!

1669
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:08,250
Tamarind rice or biryani?

1670
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:14,000
Only biryani! Always and forever!

1671
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:34,875
Bro, let's begin.

1672
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:52,708
Bro!

1673
01:53:00,125 --> 01:53:01,125
Superb!

1674
01:53:06,041 --> 01:53:06,958
Hey, bro!

1675
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:09,666
Open the back door.

1676
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:42,375
Oh, God!

1677
01:53:47,458 --> 01:53:49,125
Not even a penny!

1678
01:53:50,125 --> 01:53:51,750
Two to five million?

1679
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:53,958
You've been fooled!

1680
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,666
-Bro. 
-Yeah?

1681
01:53:57,041 --> 01:53:59,208
You saw the guy checking the car 
earlier too, right?

1682
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:02,208
That moron might have come 
to steal the tires.

1683
01:54:03,916 --> 01:54:05,125
-Bro. 
-Yeah?

1684
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:07,500
Why don't we steal the tires?

1685
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,500
Four tires and one spare.

1686
01:54:12,166 --> 01:54:13,625
We can make 15 grand easily.

1687
01:54:14,083 --> 01:54:15,083
True that!

1688
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:21,208
All four tires are damaged!

1689
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:25,625
At least the spare tire is intact! 
We can make three grand at least.

1690
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:33,791
Sorry, bro!

1691
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:36,208
That's fine.

1692
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,666
Let's hope for a miracle.

1693
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:41,625
I hope so.

1694
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:49,583
What happened, bro?

1695
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:52,166
Check this building out! 
Full of software companies.

1696
01:54:52,375 --> 01:54:55,000
Let's steal a laptop. 
At least we can watch movies on it.

1697
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,500
Why just one? Let's steal three!

1698
01:54:59,166 --> 01:55:00,875
One for movies and the others for sale!

1699
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:08,583
Oh, no!

1700
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,125
Why are you still carrying the tire?

1701
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:18,250
Considering our current luck, 
I don't want to go home empty handed.

1702
01:55:35,416 --> 01:55:37,541
Is this a software company?

1703
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:40,333
Yes, bro. 
Now, search for the laptops.

1704
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:53,541
I have found the computer. 
Let's take it.

1705
01:55:54,166 --> 01:55:56,666
Bro! We can't carry that home.

1706
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,166
Look for laptops.

1707
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:00,750
To hell with our fortune!

1708
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:17,375
-Bro, come here. 
-Yes!

1709
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:25,041
We found a laptop. Let's leave.

1710
01:56:25,166 --> 01:56:26,875
Just one? 
You said there will be more.

1711
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:29,458
Enough. Let's not be greedy.

1712
01:56:34,666 --> 01:56:35,708
Superb!

1713
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:37,541
Let's move fast.

1714
01:56:40,666 --> 01:56:43,083
Why would they have sacks 
in a software office?

1715
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:52,541
Bro, come here.

1716
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:53,583
What happened?

1717
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,250
Sugar packets.

1718
01:56:58,791 --> 01:56:59,916
Sugar packets?

1719
01:57:04,041 --> 01:57:06,208
Bro, are you out of your mind?

1720
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:08,666
This is cocaine!

1721
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:11,000
-What? Are you sure? 
-Yes, bro.

1722
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:16,875
Bro!

1723
01:57:17,416 --> 01:57:18,833
This sack is full of cash!

1724
01:57:19,041 --> 01:57:22,625
Oh, bro! Loads of cash!

1725
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,875
Oh, yeah! This is the luckiest day 
of our lives, bro!

1726
01:57:41,541 --> 01:57:42,625
Bro.

1727
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:45,625
Is that a ghost, bro?

1728
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:58,041
That is a ghost.

1729
01:57:58,125 --> 01:57:59,125
Shut up!

1730
01:58:01,791 --> 01:58:03,208
Let me check.

1731
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:07,625
Bro.

1732
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,625
Don't leave me alone, bro.

1733
01:58:10,833 --> 01:58:11,833
Shut up and follow me.

1734
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,791
Shall we call an ambulance?

1735
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:36,833
Wait.

1736
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:55,916
Bro, he is dead.

1737
01:59:04,291 --> 01:59:05,333
Looks like suicide!

1738
01:59:07,375 --> 01:59:08,791
He seems to be a big gangster.

1739
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:13,500
Imagine the mess he must have been in! 
Despite having so much.

1740
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:17,333
Look at us! Fighting for tamarind rice 
and biryani.

1741
01:59:21,583 --> 01:59:22,458
Bro.

1742
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,541
Should we forego the money and leave?

1743
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:25,833
Are you out of your mind, bro?

1744
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:27,541
Let's leave with the money.

1745
01:59:29,708 --> 01:59:32,875
Bro! Don't pick up the cocaine sack.

1746
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:35,750
Okay, I'm taking only 
the sacks of cash!

1747
01:59:43,833 --> 01:59:46,250
Bro, why are you carrying the tire?

1748
01:59:46,833 --> 01:59:48,541
Evidence, bro! This is a crime scene now.

1749
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:50,708
This tire will be evidence, 
if left behind.

1750
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:54,833
That's smart, bro.

1751
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:58,291
Let's move out quickly.

1752
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:43,833
Bro!

1753
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:46,083
Bro!

1754
02:00:51,541 --> 02:00:54,708
Bro!

1755
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:59,375
Bro!

1756
02:00:59,458 --> 02:01:01,458
Bro!

1757
02:01:02,416 --> 02:01:03,666
What happened, bro?

1758
02:01:06,291 --> 02:01:09,708
Bro, that's a real ghost.

1759
02:01:11,166 --> 02:01:12,375
Are you out of your mind?

1760
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:16,083
Let's escape before 
he comes to his senses.

1761
02:01:22,166 --> 02:01:23,166
Careful.

1762
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:30,541
Fast.

1763
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:48,916
Bro.

1764
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:51,833
What are we going to do 
with all the money?

1765
02:01:54,041 --> 02:01:55,750
We will get caught 
if we make any moves now.

1766
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:57,083
Let the pandemic end.

1767
02:01:58,166 --> 02:01:59,708
Let the situation get back to normal.

1768
02:01:59,791 --> 02:02:02,208
Till then, let's catch up on 
 Mahabharatham on the laptop.

1769
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:08,875
-Mahabharatham!  
-Mahabharatham!

1770
02:03:25,333 --> 02:03:27,416
Miracle! It is a miracle!

1771
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:30,583
I will finish my movie.

1772
02:03:30,791 --> 02:03:33,083
I don't need anyone's help.

1773
02:03:33,166 --> 02:03:35,375
I will finish my movie. Miracle!

1774
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,875
Yeah!

1775
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,875
Yeah!

1776
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:47,250
Yeah!

1777
02:03:49,416 --> 02:03:52,458
This laptop is not working, bro. 
It's stuck.

1778
02:03:55,416 --> 02:03:56,666
Rowdy lady!

1779
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:01,000
I think we went to 
a film production office yesterday.

1780
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:05,791
I think the guy we saw is the director!

1781
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:15,041
Bro, look at this. Cocaine bags. 
Like the ones we saw yesterday.

1782
02:04:15,541 --> 02:04:17,458
Remember? 
I thought it was original cocaine.

1783
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:19,250
And you said those 
were just sugar packets.

1784
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:23,666
Looks like you were right!

1785
02:04:23,916 --> 02:04:25,875
Everything is fake!

1786
02:04:35,083 --> 02:04:36,416
Are you stupid?

1787
02:05:01,875 --> 02:05:04,375
So, like I said yesterday...

1788
02:05:04,458 --> 02:05:06,458
-Guruji.  
-...how many of you believed in miracles?

1789
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,375
-Guruji!  
-How many of you experienced...

1790
02:05:08,458 --> 02:05:10,416
-...a miracle yesterday? 
-Guruji!

1791
02:05:12,666 --> 02:05:13,666
Come.

1792
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:15,083
What's the matter?

1793
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:17,250
-Guruji... 
-Maintain social distance!

1794
02:05:17,958 --> 02:05:18,958
What happened?

1795
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:23,291
Our goods near the abandoned site 
is missing, guruji.

1796
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:24,375
How much?

1797
02:05:24,583 --> 02:05:26,041
15 million.

1798
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:30,000
Good for nothing, all of you! 
Dumb idiots! Get lost.

1799
02:05:35,583 --> 02:05:36,583
Useless.

1800
02:05:48,166 --> 02:05:50,291
Shift. Action.

1801
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:56,416
So, how many of you 
experienced the miracle yesterday?

1802
02:05:56,791 --> 02:05:59,958
How many of you believed in my words?

1803
02:06:00,041 --> 02:06:01,916
Did the miracle happen?

1804
02:06:04,375 --> 02:06:05,666
-Bro? 
-Yeah?

1805
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:07,875
This tamarind rice is awesome!

1806
02:06:09,625 --> 02:06:13,583
Corona, free tamarind rice 
and guruji talks.

1807
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:14,750
This is bliss, bro!

1808
02:06:15,666 --> 02:06:19,583
True, bro! Bliss! Bliss it is!
