1
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:30,948
Love

2
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,124
Amour

3
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:38,628
Romance

4
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,834
Amidst rocks...

5
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,334
This autumn...

6
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,672
Oh! For a blossom

7
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,342
Amidst these rocks...

8
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,846
in this autumn...

9
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:40,018
Oh! For a flower that blossoms...

10
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:47,356
I have been searching forever...

11
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,694
to find her, if ever

12
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,703
If I find her, ever

13
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:05,715
If I find...

14
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,061
Use the newspaper.
- Forget newspaper

15
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,888
I saw such a lovely dream.
There she was, back...

16
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,236
The queen of your dreams?
Your dream girl, she?

17
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,740
Talked her into it?
- No

18
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,409
No?
- Missed meeting her, by a hairline

19
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,571
Then sahib, I got to do something.
Next time get her name and address

20
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,579
And tell me

21
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,082
What're today's appointments?
- Board meeting at 11:30

22
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:49,087
Afterwards, Mr Yamaguchi from Japan...
lunch with him at the club

23
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,930
At four, meeting with
reserve bank governor

24
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:58,092
Most important, in an hour,
at St Atherton College...

25
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,273
the function where they
give you the scholarship

26
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,109
That's today?
- Yes

27
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,276
Namashkar
(Greetings)

28
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,618
Honourable Minister,
Mr Principal...

29
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,450
guests and students...

30
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,623
at the inauguration of the annual
function of St Atherton College...

31
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:30,458
I, Pramod Mehra,
in capacity of treasurer...

32
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,467
of Sabharwal Students' Welfare Trust,
request the author of our trust...

33
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:38,633
Mr Yash Sabharwal, to come on stage
and inaugurate the proceedings

34
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,145
Mr Yash Sabharwal

35
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,653
As you know...

36
00:04:52,692 --> 00:05:00,656
my late father Paramjit Sabharwal
instituted this award 15 years ago...

37
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:07,666
for able, hardworking graduates
who wish to move up in life...

38
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,342
but those who haven't
the wherewithal

39
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,005
Qualifying candidates will be given
a two-year sponsorship...

40
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:20,016
for specialisation studies
University of Glasgow in Scotland

41
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,179
alongwith a 300,000 cash prize,
and certificate

42
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:39,035
I would like to invite on stage
the student who has secured 98%

43
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,373
The presenter of the new project
which has won this scholarship

44
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,876
First class student,
St Atherton College...

45
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,384
Ms Isha Nair

46
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,076
Your certificate...
and cheque

47
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,916
Honourable Mr Minister,
respected Principal Mr Mehra...

48
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,592
staff members and friends...

49
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,764
I wish research in ways of reducing
costs of heart surgeries drastically

50
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,594
To the extent of the cost
of treating a common cold

51
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,941
In our country, no one must die
for lack of money

52
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,942
This scholarship is the stepping stone
to that goal. For which I thank...

53
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,118
the founder of the trust,
the late Mr Sabharwal...

54
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:07,949
and the present trustee Mr Yash Sabharwal.
Should I succeed, Mr Yash Sabharwal...

55
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,621
and his late father, will share
equal claim to success

56
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,820
At the camera, please

57
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,164
I was sure, our Ishu would bag
the scholarship this year

58
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,674
Mahesh, she's the first from
our family who's going abroad

59
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:07,683
My friend Inder Bhardwaj wanted
to be her sponsor. But Isha refused

60
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:13,514
As luck would have it, you're going
to his country, Scotland

61
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,861
My obeisances, Ma.
- Back from office so soon?

62
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,031
Didn't feel like staying on.
- I know why

63
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,534
What?
- You've taken a liking to a girl?

64
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,375
Hassubhai has told me everything

65
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,548
Is she the one?

66
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,213
Yes

67
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,886
Prettier than a barbie doll.
Dream girl

68
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,552
I'm so happy, Yash.
I thought you'd never marry

69
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,725
At last, the Sabharwal lineage
will continue

70
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,405
But why are you so melancholy?
- It's nothing, Ma

71
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,743
Actually, the problem is...

72
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:13,408
I'm sending away the girl I happen
to like. I gave her a scholarship

73
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,419
Just that? Leave that to me.

74
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,592
I'll make sure you marry Isha Nair

75
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,420
No girl in the world can say
anything but yes to my Yash

76
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,262
She will never find
such a man of honour

77
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,107
Hassubhai, I want Isha's whereabouts.

78
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,608
He must've found out by now, no?

79
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,775
Hassubhai...
- My word

80
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:14,639
"You've hidden from me..."

81
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,813
"but I've found you"

82
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:35,494
"Who you are, where you are..."

83
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:44,507
"I've found in your heart"

84
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:15,205
"You hear nothing? You speak nothing,
you're as still as a picture"

85
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:30,214
"My love, you're my life"

86
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,390
"But you don't even know
who I am"

87
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:44,897
"Is it a stone idol
that I worship?"

88
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:56,241
"You've hidden from me..."

89
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,077
"but I've found you"

90
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:43,459
2 "This fair visage,
or is it a Moon?"

91
00:12:54,006 --> 00:13:03,972
"These lovely eyes,
or deep lakes?"

92
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:13,983
"Oh you don't know,
in those eyes, someone has drowned"

93
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:24,325
"You've hidden from me..."

94
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,004
"but I've found you"

95
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:35,344
"Who you are, where you are..."

96
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,847
"I've found in your heart"

97
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,021
"You've hidden from me..."

98
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,187
"but I've found you"

99
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,549
I can't believe this!
You are so rich!

100
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,884
And you come asking for the hand
of a civil servant's daughter?

101
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,388
Who said we're rich?
We're just the groomspeople

102
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,221
And we stand in supplication.
The bridespeople are the rich ones

103
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,395
But I'd like to ask my daughter.
She's planning on going to Scotland...

104
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,404
for two years. For education.
- Education and marriage...

105
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,077
aren't mutually exclusive.
- Mrs Sabharwal is right

106
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,908
We want to give Isha the best.
- But Kanchan, Isha has her opinion

107
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,075
Isha will never disobey us.
We're her parents

108
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,916
What we intend, is for her best.
Just say yes. Don't be stubborn

109
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,252
I didn't have her wrist size
for the bracelets

110
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,432
The design is Italian.
Isha will surely like it

111
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,101
You have sealed my lips.
What can I say?

112
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,266
Address her as a relative,
and try some sweets

113
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:13,573
For your daughter marriage
is no goal! I want to study

114
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,614
You can continue your education
even after marriage

115
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,280
This is no everyday chance

116
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,953
In this country, can a girl
not write her own destiny?

117
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,122
I'm only proposing to you.

118
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,458
Accepting it or not is upto you

119
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:45,307
Yes Ishu, you're the one who decides
the future course of your life

120
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:52,144
How about selecting a wedding invite?
- Yes, I will

121
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:52,715
Take a look

122
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,149
Who? Isha Nair?

123
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:04,656
Yes, send her in. To the drawing room.
- Here already? Great tuning!

124
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,490
Go on, Hassubhai...
- Going, going...

125
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,172
Welcome, have a seat

126
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,005
I'd like to discuss something personal.
- Sure. Sit. Would you like something?

127
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,012
I've come to return something

128
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,686
Your mother visited us yesterday...

129
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:33,351
she left these wedding bracelets.
I don't want to break her heart

130
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,693
So I'm returning them to you

131
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,191
May I know the reason for refusal?
- I don't feel the need to tell you

132
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,368
This is unjust, Isha.
This is not fair

133
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:52,866
Even the judge cites reasons.
- You cannot use the scholarship...

134
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,538
to force me into a marriage.
- No, you're getting me wrong

135
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,887
For the first time in my life,
I like someone.

136
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,385
Is liking someone a crime?

137
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:17,224
I told my mother that.
Maybe she acted in haste

138
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:23,673
I didn't intend hurting you, I promise.
And this proposition...

139
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,573
has nothing to do with the scholarship.
It's your, you've earned it

140
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:35,014
All I wish to know is why you
negate such a positive approach

141
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,926
So you think marriage is a business
of pluses and minuses?

142
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:50,097
Can't help it, Isha. I'm a businessman.
I can only talk in pluses and minuses

143
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,731
But the truth of it is, life is
a business. Let me tell you how

144
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,102
But please don't misinterpret me
this time. Isha, as we know...

145
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:11,951
there's this human bondage that ties
people together

146
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,084
How do man and woman live together?

147
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,989
How do friends go about friendships?

148
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:26,166
On the basis of what do people in love
build their relationships?

149
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,503
How come, Isha?
And what is this bond?

150
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,750
It's belief, honour. Faith. Trust

151
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:49,156
Agreement. Contract. Be it on paper
or in hearts, contract is contract

152
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:56,527
With a contract begins every business.
So tell me, isn't life a business?

153
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,767
For the rich of your ilk,
life might be a business

154
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,567
But for us, life is a struggle.
- You're cross again

155
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,170
Please, just let me go away

156
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:17,380
I love you truly. Maybe the
way I put it is wrong.

157
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,181
Maybe the timing is wrong

158
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,021
Maybe marriage is farthest from
your mind at this point of time

159
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:33,263
But if ever, remember.
Yash Sabharwal will await you forever

160
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,877
These bracelets will await you,
and my heart too, Isha

161
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:47,076
Mr Yash, we differ. Our paths differ.
How can our goals be the same?

162
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,283
Those bracelets will look better
on a businesswoman

163
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:18,606
Isha made a grave mistake in refusing
you. But you mustn't despair

164
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:25,686
God might've someone else for you.
Now get ready

165
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:34,398
He was your father's close friend.
If you aren't present, he might...

166
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,830
stop the engagement altogether.
You know that, don't you?

167
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,904
Yes, Ma.
- Let's go

168
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,103
Yash, my son!

169
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,572
Had you not arrived,
I would've stopped this ceremony

170
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,514
I always wanted you to announce
my daughter's wedding

171
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,057
Sorry for keeping you waiting

172
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,529
Actually, this was my father's
responsibility

173
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,424
But he isn't amongst us anymore.
When I was still a child...

174
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,003
Mr Mehra placed this responsibility
on my shoulders

175
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:15,623
"Don't leave your memories behind"

176
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,635
"Don't break your promises"

177
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,504
"My darling, I'm crazy about you"

178
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,244
"I was your first love"

179
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,426
"The way you broke my heart..."

180
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,296
"you too will have a heartbreak"

181
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:33,568
"You too will lose someone"

182
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:39,617
"Remember this, my traitor"

183
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:50,790
"Don't leave relationships behind"

184
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:57,034
"Don't break your promises"

185
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,228
"My darling, I'm crazy about you"

186
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,375
"I was your first love"

187
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,864
"After me..."

188
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,163
"who will you now destroy?"

189
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:45,872
"Like me, you too will beg someday"

190
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:51,551
"Remember this, my infidel"

191
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:03,262
"Don't desert your lover"

192
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,806
"My darling, I'm crazy about you"

193
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:20,180
"I was your first love"

194
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:26,450
"Don't leave your memories behind"

195
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:32,694
"Don't break your promises"

196
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,595
"My darling, I'm crazy about you"

197
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,571
"I was your first love"

198
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,091
What are you doing? Helping me out?
Or taking my Anjali away from me?

199
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,227
Ajay... you?

200
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,695
Didn't have the courage
to face your Daddy

201
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,268
So I had to enlist Gaurav.
He's into modelling. Acting too

202
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,007
No breaks on screen.
So I'm into real-life acts

203
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,041
And you put in a nice act

204
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,489
I don't know how to thank you.

205
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,155
But for you, I'd never have
the girl I have loved

206
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,029
Here's your reward. 100,000.
- No...

207
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,360
Keep it, Gaurav.
I know you need the money

208
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:51,900
Give your fiancee her ring

209
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:16,661
Gaurav has become so irresponsible!
Been looking for him all evening

210
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:22,032
But no news of this hero!
I want to make him India's top model

211
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:27,570
But he's always missing.
- Maya, maybe I survived the crash...

212
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:33,411
which killed Gaurav's parents, because
I am to take care of him

213
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,683
But I'm only his uncle,
not his father

214
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,586
Despite all my efforts,
he won't listen to me

215
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:48,527
Told me, he's off to enact a "role".
- And I've made 100,000 out of it

216
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,092
A hundred thousand?

217
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:02,211
Cut out these bit roles.
Concentrate on modelling

218
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:11,050
Be at the studio at ten tomorrow.
I want to take some test shots of you

219
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,255
For a new product from
a multinational

220
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,560
If you're approved,
you get 5 million

221
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,557
5 million?

222
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:23,896
Tomorrow morning, he isn't going to
the studio. He should be in my office

223
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,161
Consider it done

224
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,588
Your model is here

225
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,053
I know

226
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,330
Tell me, why have you called me here?
What can I do for you?

227
00:28:53,865 --> 00:29:00,464
Lots. If you wish,
you can even change my life

228
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,404
Nice humour. I'm neither manufacturer
nor industrialist, nor an MBA

229
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:14,611
How may I help you? You have it all.
- All except your finesse

230
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:26,492
To those whom God has given all,
He has also given certain flaws

231
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,362
You have money, you're sad.
I haven't money, I'm sad

232
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:39,840
No, I'm not sad. I'm disturbed,
I'm restless

233
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,706
There's a girl.
I'm deeply in love with her

234
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:58,225
Her name is Isha. Ever since I saw her,
I seem to like nothing else

235
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:06,394
All this money, this wealth,
is of no use, unless I have Isha

236
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:13,676
Only one wish remains in life.
To have Isha

237
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,611
Come what may, whatever the price

238
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,985
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

239
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,919
I wanted to
I still want to marry her.

240
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,762
But she has refused

241
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,725
Refused?

242
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,629
But why?

243
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,969
All I know is how to make money
out of money

244
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:49,111
But in matters of the heart,
I'm a complete imbecile

245
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,909
I want your help

246
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,749
From what I saw in you last night,
uniting the lovers, I was convinced

247
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,716
You are my messiah, you're the one
who can give me the girl I love

248
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,725
I need your help

249
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,366
This isn't my calling.
I'm just a small-time actor

250
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,647
This job isn't tough for you,
believe me

251
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,213
In matters of love and amour,
you are number one

252
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,083
You know what love, amour, romance is?

253
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,883
Most complicated subject

254
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:42,299
That's why I've called you in.
In this only subject, I'm lacking

255
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,165
Gaurav, make a place for me
in Isha's heart

256
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:55,374
I'll give you more money
than you will ever make

257
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,379
Go on, sounds nice

258
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:05,317
You'll forget acting. I'll put you
ahead by 20 years in one stroke

259
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,357
I'm giving you 100 million

260
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,227
What did you say?

261
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,358
100 million?

262
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,978
You're crazy.
- Crazy about Isha

263
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,605
But Gaurav...

264
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,306
Isha mustn't have an inkling

265
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,254
Have nothing to worry.
Six months from now...

266
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,419
she will be in your arms

267
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,896
Call Gaurav again.
Ask his uncle where he is

268
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,476
I'm doing all this for him,
and he doesn't seem to care?

269
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,671
His costume and make-up are ready.
But he's missing

270
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,319
Is this any time to arrive?

271
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,118
You walk in two hours late
on a big assignment like this?

272
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,384
If you want fame and wealth,
learn how to respect time

273
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,521
May I have a say, Maya?
- Sorry? What else have you to say?

274
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,037
You're taking undue advantage
of my friendship

275
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,038
I'm not interested in becoming
a model anymore

276
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:36,536
I've landed a new assignment.
Here's my resignation letter

277
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,219
Listen...

278
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,563
This one's gone

279
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,233
Yes, gone

280
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,229
But I'll surely get him back

281
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:12,409
When in Scotland, study hard,
keep calling and don't forget

282
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,079
Inder will receive you
at the airport

283
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:24,417
Take care. I'll keep calling

284
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,646
Why are you staring at me?

285
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,154
Here for heart research,
University of Glasgow

286
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,323
My name's Tajinder

287
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,328
I'm Lord Bhardwaj's chauffeur

288
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,994
Why were you hassling me?

289
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,502
How did you make me out?
- From your face

290
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,498
From your innocent eyes,
like Ajanta paintings

291
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,342
From your cherry-red lips

292
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,835
When Lord Bhardwaj described you,
I knew Isha would be...

293
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:57,344
the prettiest girl on this flight.
Only from India comes such beauty

294
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,848
That's why Indian girls always
get crowned Miss world

295
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,688
By the way, I'm Indian too,
though not by birth. By descent

296
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,025
Lord Bhardwaj pays you
for the verbiage too?

297
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,031
Go on. I'll follow you

298
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,871
Now I'm driving you to Lord Bhardwaj's
8000 acre estate

299
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,613
Bless you my child

300
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:35,782
This is the culture, every
Indian father is so desirous of

301
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,456
Learn something, my son.
This is why I tell you...

302
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,626
when it comes to marriage,
it must be an Indian girl

303
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,787
He's your son?

304
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,299
Have you been pulling her leg?
- He was saying he's your chauffeur

305
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,471
And his mother is Lord Bhardwaj's
personal secretary

306
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:01,308
The first statement is incorrect.
The second is one hundred percent right

307
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,644
Yes Rohini, my dear?
- Yes. I'm their secretary

308
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,147
Were it not for me,
neither would have stayed at home

309
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,480
His Lordship would've made home
in his financial institutions

310
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,484
And Taj would've stayed at his bank.
Come, let's go home

311
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,833
Right foot in first.
Consider this your home

312
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,827
Proud daughter of a proud father, would
never visit Scotland on my invitation

313
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:33,507
Thanks to your sponsor, what's his
name? Yash Sabharwal... here you are

314
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,675
Your father Mahesh and I passed
out of Aligarh University together

315
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,514
He wanted to stay on in India.
And I came here

316
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:48,514
I came here with only 5 pounds in
my pocket. 50 Rupees in those times

317
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:54,687
. Mahesh says I'm an Englishman. But
you see, after all these years here...

318
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,033
I haven't forgotten my India

319
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,867
Here's the one and only University
of Glasgow. Magnificent, isn't it?

320
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,040
The Gilby-Scott building
is the oldest edifice

321
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,208
And this is Dr Alam.
- Good morning Taj, my son

322
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,551
I've been expecting you

323
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,721
Allow me to commend your fine choice
of a research topic

324
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:31,057
Students from different countries
are sponsored by the University

325
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:39,398
You have our full co-operation
in your further studies and research

326
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,410
I'll try my best

327
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,747
The introductory meeting
is in ten minutes. Let's go

328
00:39:54,458 --> 00:40:04,766
Your chauffeur will come
to pick you up in the evening

329
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:30,286
Lord Bhardwaj called a while ago.
He's quite concerned about you

330
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,687
He was inquiring whether
his ward is feeling lonely

331
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,626
He's a good friend of my father's.
- He said so

332
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:41,298
Come, let me introduce you
to other Indian students

333
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,980
You won't have any problems here.
Yes Ruby?

334
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,482
No problems

335
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,316
If you don't believe, ask Mini India

336
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:10,661
The whites have named us that. Used
to sound strange. But now it's cool

337
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,334
Nice. It's an excuse
to maintain ties with India

338
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,340
Consider yourself
a part of Mini India

339
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,670
You're all words!
- Ms Nair, before she was born...

340
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:30,342
her mother ate crow.
That's why she keeps cawing

341
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,044
I'll fix him in a trice

342
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,050
What are you doing?

343
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,051
Ancient Indian art of healing

344
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,158
Up

345
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,726
Dislocated his shoulder

346
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,056
Daddy's uncle was number one wrestler
in Uttar Pradesh

347
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,732
He taught me this trick.
Always works

348
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,735
Go on

349
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,011
The healing here would've laid him up
in bed for six months

350
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,741
Got to go

351
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,248
Young man, you work here?
Never saw you before

352
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,748
Who are you?
- My name's Gaurav

353
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,426
I'm a handyman here

354
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:48,663
I've seen you several times.
But why would you notice a janitor?

355
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,100
Nothing like that.
- This is just an accidental meeting

356
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:59,773
I'll get late for my next job.
If I'm late, I'll lose 5 pounds

357
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:00,773
Excuse me

358
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,443
Very hard working

359
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,120
Someday he'll reach his goal

360
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,840
Don't you turn her into
one of your Mini Indians

361
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,511
Beware of Mini India gang.
They'll spoil you rotten

362
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,682
You want to finish the year's course
all in day one?

363
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,522
Come on, it's getting late.
Past seven

364
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:29,029
You're going out to dinner at
Springfield Quay with a prince

365
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,702
Prince of whereabouts, may I ask?

366
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:47,213
The food was very delicious.
I've had more than my fill

367
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,217
Are you complaining?
Or are you complimenting?

368
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,622
Both

369
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,223
Wait, let me get the car around

370
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:19,078
You work in the university canteen?
- Yes

371
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,583
You know him?
- Yes, I've seen him at the campus

372
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,588
But what are you doing here?
- Selling flowers. Side business

373
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,592
Working outside the hotel
till I land a job at the hotel

374
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:33,930
Roses, sir?

375
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,934
Neither it is opportune,
nor is it the occasion

376
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,441
Roses await no occasion
Roses can be given anytime

377
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,607
Round the year, round the clock,
whenever

378
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,114
It delivers a message from the heart.
- Roses? They really say...

379
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,455
what the heart says.
- Choose the right colour

380
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:04,124
That's all you got to do.
Black rose. It signals hatred, angst

381
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,287
White rose. Peace, patch-up.
To woo the angry one

382
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,627
Ties together
broken heartstrings

383
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:18,137
Yellow rose. Exchanged between new
friends. The first step in friendship

384
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:24,306
And the red rose. My favourite.
The colour of the heart

385
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,480
Tells the tale of hearts,
the world over

386
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,656
What does the pink rose say?

387
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,318
I like you a lot

388
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,992
For a special friend

389
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,657
Which rose for you?

390
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,326
Yellow rose

391
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:03,345
Extra change changes a man.
I only take what I earn

392
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,191
This orange rose to both of you.
From me. It'll bring you good luck

393
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,199
I'm already in luck

394
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:38,881
This scene reminds me of the old film.
"One Flower, Two Gardeners"

395
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,558
I have a surprise for you

396
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,059
Take this

397
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:55,064
Keys?
- A small gift for you from the Lord

398
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:04,073
But I can't accept so expensive a gift.
Taj, you must tell him

399
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:09,745
The gift, you must accept. Or do you
want me for your permanent chauffeur?

400
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:15,755
But...
- No buts. How do you like the car?

401
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,096
Go on, you're getting late
for your classes

402
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:27,770
Clam up

403
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,447
Gaurav, what are you doing?
I don't understand a thing

404
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,116
But tell you what, the choice
of the car is fine

405
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,328
You do exactly as I told you.
I'll run into Isha's car

406
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:57,631
And you will cause a diversion.
She looks at you

407
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:58,300
And bang!

408
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:05,472
You'll die! Your planning is
perfectly dangerous

409
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:10,469
My boss is crazy about Isha.
And you're crazy about money

410
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,980
Making 100 million isn't easy.
Got to take risks

411
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:32,998
The car is coming

412
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:18,312
You?

413
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,049
You?

414
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,721
Is your car all right?
- Forget the car!

415
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,550
You're hurt in the arm!
- I'm fine

416
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,390
No, let me take you
to the hospital. Come on

417
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:45,230
It was my mistake. You're worrying
for nothing. I'm perfectly all right

418
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:50,072
Please ask the doctor to let me go.
- You'll be here for a couple of days

419
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,080
You're under observation.
- No, I can't stay in hospital

420
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,587
I have lots of responsibilities.
- Are you married?

421
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:05,255
Two pre-requisites for a marriage.
First, money to run the household

422
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:09,588
The other?
- A girl one likes

423
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,593
I'm not as lucky as Taj

424
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,604
It's Taj who's in luck

425
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,601
Please ask the doctor to discharge me.
I have lots to do

426
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,276
Just keep lying. Two days of rest
won't cause harm

427
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,950
You won't understand.
I'm not destined to rest

428
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,113
How will I put together the money
for my cousin's wedding?

429
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,953
My uncle is awaiting surgery
for ulcers

430
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,960
Babli, my aunt's grand-daughter
has to be sent...

431
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,629
to an English medium school
in Gurdaspur

432
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:48,634
Got to buy two tractors.
- You're providing for so many?

433
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,966
Lord provides

434
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:55,144
I'm the sole male in my family.
Five daughters

435
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,977
Three cousins on my father's side,
two on my mother's side

436
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:03,315
Uncle and aunt are aged.
There are household expenses

437
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,984
And so much more to do. I must
see to it that Babli becomes a doctor

438
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,319
Babli?
- Aunt's granddaughter

439
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:16,324
Very cute. She's ten.
Calls me Ga-Ga

440
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:21,993
Gaurav! What happened to you?

441
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,166
This is Hassubhai

442
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,010
I'm staying with him

443
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,507
It's time for my practicals. There's
a special seminar on angioplasty

444
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:33,341
I'll come again

445
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,017
Listen...

446
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,186
you haven't told me your name

447
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,690
My name...
- I know. Gaurav

448
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,185
You're living up to your name

449
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:53,366
You're a master at acting! How come
you never landed a role in films?

450
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,561
Where are you lost?

451
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:28,727
How do you save a patient
in this condition?

452
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:39,245
But weak pulmonary conditions
makes by-pass surgery risky

453
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,592
Gaurav in hospital?

454
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,252
Accident?

455
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:56,425
How did all this happen?
- It's Gaurav's plan!

456
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,094
No tensions

457
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:06,773
Make sure my job is done.
- Sure, sure. See you

458
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:28,787
Taj's friend is Isha. Yesterday, I ran
into her car. It was my mistake

459
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,130
Poor Isha is going through
a lot of trouble for me

460
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,967
Staying in hospital will only
increase my bills

461
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,812
So I've discharged myself
without telling Isha

462
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,645
Will she understand my compulsions?
I don't know

463
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:48,814
Why won't I understand?

464
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:55,151
Reading someone's personal diary
isn't a nice habit

465
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:05,164
First, why did you get discharged?
I'm here in a fighting mood

466
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:10,165
Fighting in this state will land me
in hospital again

467
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:19,345
Got to get back to work tomorrow.
- You'll do yourself a favour...

468
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,517
if you rest for a couple of days.
- That's true

469
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:29,515
Can I tell you something personal?
You and Taj are a cute couple

470
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,189
Taj and I are just friends.
I'm their guest

471
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,866
Then you have another boyfriend?

472
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:38,200
No

473
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,033
No? There must be someone
who likes you

474
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,038
Nothing like that happening.
- You're lying. I won't accept it

475
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:51,035
You are so beautiful.
Someone must've come into your life

476
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,716
Can we talk of something else?
- Fine with me...

477
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:57,546
if you don't want to tell me.
But why these yellow roses, then?

478
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,886
If you take me for a special friend,
you must tell me

479
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:11,397
There was someone. Yash Sabharwal.
Very rich. He wanted to marry me

480
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,395
But I refused him.
- Why?

481
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,233
Maybe I was expecting someone else

482
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,903
Got to be going. To the library.
Your diary

483
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:33,082
Not my diary. It's my heart.
And I don't want anyone...

484
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,416
to enter my heart without
as much a knocking

485
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:42,094
Many secrets hidden in your heart?
If you take me for a special friend...

486
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:49,929
you got to tell me a few things too.
- As of now, your hands are delicate

487
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:51,941
Like roses

488
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,609
Does Gaurav ever listen to anyone?

489
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,946
He was talking of a big assignment
in Scotland

490
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,289
Says he'll become a millionaire
in a year

491
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:12,951
Maybe he's fed up of India,
like the other boys

492
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:18,290
They think there's lots more money
abroad. But don't you worry

493
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,469
Just give me his address

494
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,810
Memories of motherland

495
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:41,654
In your company, I still feel
I'm at home

496
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:51,664
What I tell every fellow countryman...
what I'm telling you Rubina...

497
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:57,162
and all you Mini Indians. If you marry,
make sure it's a fellow countryman

498
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,010
Who are you telling all this?
They are rotten eggs

499
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,512
Enough! I'm trying

500
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,509
If I find a good Indian, I'll think
about it. Yes Mini India?

501
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,016
Oh I forgot something important

502
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,374
I thought we wouldn't make it alive!

503
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:38,372
Come inside

504
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,237
Pink rose? For me?

505
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,911
I like you too

506
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,423
Greetings.
- Glory to India

507
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,756
Uncle, this is Gaurav.
This is Hassubhai

508
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,256
Your palace is superb!

509
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,928
I'm very impressed
with your handspun

510
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,605
Is there more to it
than meets the eye?

511
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,109
Where are you from?
- India

512
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,812
And your parents?
- From Punjab

513
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,280
Which city?
- Near Jullunder

514
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,281
District?

515
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,279
Greetings, lady

516
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,118
Come on, tell me. I know every
district in Punjab

517
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:53,948
District?

518
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,795
Stop interrogating him.
I know him very well

519
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,465
He works at the university canteen.
Very hard-working boy

520
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,462
Come on, Ruby has something important
to tell you. Come

521
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,638
Let's go inside

522
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:18,144
Isha, I can't. I got to make
a few calls to India

523
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,816
I got to wish folks at home
for Independence Day

524
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,650
I'll see you tomorrow

525
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:29,483
See you

526
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,827
Got to steer clear of the Lord.
Interrogates like a policeman

527
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,000
Lordship, I wish to make
an important announcement

528
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,169
Mini India and I are going to trek
in Switzerland over the long week-end

529
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,841
I'd like you to allow Isha
to accompany us

530
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,011
She's part of Mini India now

531
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,849
Isha may go

532
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:04,853
You must accept Taj
as part of Mini India too

533
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,356
What are you getting me into?
- You hear?

534
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,366
He doesn't want to be
part of Mini India.

535
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,200
I'm not interested in going around
with these folks.

536
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:19,367
Taj, I say you will be part
of Mini India

537
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,380
I'll go to Switzerland with Isha

538
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:34,549
Stop fiddling with the scooter
and think about your mission

539
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:40,059
Taj can spoil our party.
In Switzerland...

540
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:44,563
if he manages to woo Isha,
what will happen to my boss?

541
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,070
Don't teach me my job.
Get me a number ten spanner

542
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,901
Does Gaurav live in this hostel?
- Yes

543
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,908
Can you tell me his room number?
- In my room

544
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:03,912
Gaurav! Is this any place to live?
What are you into?

545
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:10,586
What kind of assignment is this?
- My assignment is a solid one

546
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:17,588
Who's this Gujarati-bhai?
- This is Hassubhai. My agent

547
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,096
Forget him. Let's shake hands

548
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:31,436
I've got you selected as male model
in a big campaign

549
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:35,276
The shooting is in Scotland.
And I'm here with my unit

550
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:39,784
Let me think

551
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:46,284
If you act in her ad-film,
what happens to my film?

552
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,125
Are you doing a Gujarati film?

553
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,967
I'll do your job, Hassubhai.
Once I'm over with Ms Maya

554
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:59,630
You're a master when
it comes to girls

555
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:08,143
I'm willing to do your ad film.
On one condition

556
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:11,653
No tensions about payment.
It's a two-year contract

557
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,649
You get all of 5 million.
- This isn't about money

558
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,494
Look at this place.
I hate it here

559
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,995
If you want me to shoot,
you must do it in Switzerland

560
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,166
What?

561
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,670
Alongsides the adfilm,
we'll enjoy romancing

562
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,840
In the laps of snowy mountains
in Switzerland...

563
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:41,176
we'll do official work,
and some things personal too

564
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:52,191
No! The whole unit is here.
The entire set-up...

565
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,694
will have to be changed.
- Maya, can't you do as much for me?

566
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,866
Then I must go to Switzerland too.
- Why?

567
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,713
My film will stay half-finished

568
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,715
You have your boarding passes?

569
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,718
20 minutes to take off

570
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,732
I think I dropped my boarding pass
at the check-in counter

571
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,097
The flight is about to take off.
But Taj isn't here yet

572
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:03,427
He'll come

573
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,777
What? I'm on the plane?

574
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:00,317
What?

575
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,154
Chances like this don't happen
time and again

576
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,323
Mini India is off on
a discovery of Switzerland

577
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,997
The two of you got to discover
your friendship

578
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,330
Coming Sunday at 10:30.
Don't miss the flight to Scotland

579
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:22,504
Your model Gaurav isn't here yet?
- Relax. Gaurav will be here

580
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:28,679
This seat is reserved

581
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,855
I don't fancy sitting next to you

582
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:40,689
I'm taking this flight under duress.
I didn't choose to take it with you

583
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:47,027
But this seat is ours.
- Yes, ours

584
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,374
Hassubhai, tell him
whose seat this is

585
01:06:55,244 --> 01:07:00,204
Happens to be mine. But our model
has had a stomach upset

586
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,877
So I sold him his ticket

587
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:08,383
Not to worry! He's taking
the next flight for sure

588
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:28,737
Taj, where are you? Isha called.
She's with Ruby and Mini India

589
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,245
If she calls again,
give her my number

590
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,586
Maya, where's the model?
- You shifted the location

591
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:48,756
And your crew is here too.
And your new model...

592
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:51,926
what's his name? Yes, Gaurav.
There's no sight of him?

593
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,431
If this shoot isn't happening,
we've got ourselves...

594
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:02,608
a bad name in the ad world.
- You're shooting. Hundred percent

595
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:12,284
My word. I'm giving you
a far better model. Look

596
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,856
What are you saying? I want
to shoot this ad with Gaurav

597
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:27,299
Shoot another one with him.
Look. Tall. Handsome

598
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:28,963
And smooth.
- Smooth?

599
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,464
Meaning, sexy

600
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:42,980
I'm right, no?

601
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:47,322
Listen...

602
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:53,985
right now, I'm very tense.
I want you to model for me

603
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:03,664
Remember saying that you took
the flight with me under duress?

604
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,008
Will you suffer a little bit more?
For my sake...

605
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:18,677
Dad always tells me to help damsels
in distress. Specially if she's Indian

606
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:22,850
But I don't know modelling

607
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:30,358
I'll teach you all that.
Trouble teaches

608
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,860
Is your name Trouble?

609
01:10:50,579 --> 01:11:03,322
"Love, amour and romance"

610
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,460
"Before you say it..."

611
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,627
"hold your heart"

612
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:23,138
"Just saying it is
making an epoch"

613
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:34,654
"Love, amour and romance"

614
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:42,884
"If I am ever afflicted..."

615
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:50,554
"what if ever?
But why at all?"

616
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:58,396
"Anyone who has given his heart,
anyone who has taken this sorrow"

617
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:05,737
"Ask him not for words,
to describe his long dark nights"

618
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:14,086
"For he has no sleep in his eyes"

619
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:25,598
"Love, amour and romance"

620
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:49,617
"Sweetheart, I'm crazy about you"

621
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:55,123
"I was your first love"

622
01:13:56,832 --> 01:14:02,964
In this place we meet,
flowers have blossomed in our hearts"

623
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,636
"Who knows?"

624
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,967
"What's happening to us?"

625
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,312
"In the midst of words..."

626
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:17,982
"between our eyes..."

627
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,645
"somewhere during
this short friendship..."

628
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:25,482
"sometime during
this brief acquaintance..."

629
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:33,499
"there's a little mischief'

630
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:37,669
"Love, amour and romance"

631
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:45,169
"Love, amour and romance"

632
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,681
"Before you say it..."

633
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,011
"hold your heart"

634
01:14:55,390 --> 01:15:03,354
"Just saying it is
making an epoch"

635
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,718
My boss is going to be exhilarated
when he sees these photos!

636
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,283
You lost your boarding pass?

637
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,788
Good for Isha that she was
in company of Ruby and Mini India

638
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:38,953
I sent you to accompany Isha,
and you end up becoming a model?

639
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:44,455
If you're so careless,
you're going to be left behind

640
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,627
Listen to me.
- Whatever you say...

641
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:50,460
I'll never forgive this Gaurav!
- My boss will never forgive me

642
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:04,315
You know, you've lost a big contract!
- Still, you have him

643
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:09,654
That's if he cares for me!
- Which fool says I don't?

644
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:16,661
There I lay sick in Scotland
with one name on my lips. Maya

645
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,006
I hope you aren't lying?
- Gaurav lying?

646
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:30,671
Gaurav is a model of truth!
- Pronounce it right. Model

647
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:32,013
My word

648
01:17:54,403 --> 01:18:01,536
Isha, today's my birthday.
Today, I'm giving you...

649
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:07,371
my most precious possession. My diary.
For you to look into my heart...

650
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:10,217
whenever you wish.
- Gaurav, where are you?

651
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,054
Where can I be
if my heart is with you?

652
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,059
Isha, you are my love,
to me you're everything

653
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:23,390
So many days we've been together,
yet our hearts aren't sated

654
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,896
Same here

655
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,400
Someone's knocking at the study

656
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,737
Go away. Go

657
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,743
Were you talking to someone?
- Why?

658
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:51,752
I thought I heard voices.
- I was reading aloud

659
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:58,593
I forgot to tell you. Your Dad called.
Make sure you call him tomorrow

660
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,273
It was uncle

661
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,109
I should be leaving

662
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:19,950
I want to give you a birthday gift too

663
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,133
What happened?

664
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,644
I shouldn't be staying any longer

665
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:19,343
Stealing out of Isha's room like
a thief so late at night? Why?

666
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,849
This silence can't cover up
for your malafide intentions

667
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,685
What brings you here?

668
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:35,018
I called Gaurav.
He came to return my diary

669
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:42,526
There's a proper way to enter a house.
Only the bad use the wrong way in

670
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:49,870
And you better heed my advice.
Stop hovering about Isha

671
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:55,213
You better find another prey
for your evil intentions

672
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:02,553
You are getting me wrong.
- And you don't know me either

673
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:07,050
I don't think it's fair of a man
to hold a gun on another

674
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,729
But if you dare play with
the honour of my family again...

675
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:17,061
I will have to do the good deed
of putting a bullet in your head

676
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:40,150
Mr Yash... here in Scotland?

677
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:45,650
Photographs of your romance with Isha
forced me to come here

678
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,491
Very romantic photos, no?

679
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,493
Must commend Hassubhai's loyalty

680
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:03,839
But why this childishness?
You should trust me

681
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:09,517
No on will, after seeing these snaps.
They look real

682
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,184
Are you using the ruse of putting up
an act to have an affair with Isha?

683
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,518
His romance has me all confused

684
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:22,362
Yes

685
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:28,869
You speak of trust, but
you don't know what it means

686
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:35,705
An out-of-job guy like me
is very committed to his job

687
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,880
I'm not in the habit of coveting
what belongs to another

688
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:47,017
So much about trust.
As far as Isha is concerned...

689
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:51,289
the game I'm playing with her,
is just an assignment...

690
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:56,393
a stepping stone
in my life. A job.

691
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:58,394
Job maybe. For you

692
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,830
For me, it's a matter of
life an death, an obsession

693
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,508
I want to marry Isha.
- Be patient

694
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,807
The fruits of fortitude are sweet.
- Ever since I saw Isha...

695
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:17,515
I haven't been able to sleep.
Every minute, every second...

696
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,584
every moment, I see her

697
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:31,456
Anyway, you won't understand

698
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:39,769
Hey! Look at me, look into my eyes.
Feel what's going on in my heart

699
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,436
Try to understand, listen...
- I'm listening

700
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,543
Till I've taken Isha
for my bride...

701
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,874
this pining, this wait, this obsession
will drive me crazy

702
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:57,887
Do whatever you have to do, fast!
- As of now, Isha has fallen...

703
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:03,725
for my act of love.
Now I have to break her heart

704
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:08,235
After the heartbreak, she will be
in your arms, hundred percent

705
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:16,641
Don't ask me now, how and when.
Just watch the last act unfold

706
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,976
The last act is always
the most important

707
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:28,822
Don't forget your 100 million.
- Have nothing to worry

708
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:33,027
I've told you already.
Love, amour and romance is but a game

709
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,458
If it's a game, come to the endgame

710
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:51,173
Break Isha's heart

711
01:25:57,385 --> 01:26:03,187
Uncle has told me not to see you.
- Lord Bhardwaj is like a father to you

712
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:08,184
And every father suspects
his daughter's friends

713
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,491
I want to tell him
everything about you.

714
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,302
Tell no one anything
until I tell you

715
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:21,036
I'm afraid Gaurav, someone
might take us apart

716
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:43,127
Everyone thinks, after this ad,
you're going to become a top model

717
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,225
This is going to be
my first and last ad film

718
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:51,394
Could be my last ad film too.
The entire unit is on location

719
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,536
And Maya is missing.
Gone with that model

720
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,410
Who's that with Maya?
- The unprofessional model

721
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:04,642
The one whom Maya approved. Gaurav.
- So the flower-boy is into modelling

722
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,920
The client and the agency
have both rejected him

723
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,825
Why did you bring him here?

724
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:16,595
Whatever happened
was beyond my control

725
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:23,464
Illness don't knock before coming.
- Gaurav is very upset about the shoot

726
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,605
He's here to apologise to you

727
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:34,645
Congratulations

728
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:39,783
Strange turn of coincidences!
You are where I should've been

729
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,451
I'm very happy for you.
- Better if the coincidence...

730
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:47,822
stays limited to modelling.
I don't fancy taking your place

731
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,795
Do you know each other?
- It's terribly difficult...

732
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,560
forgetting a man like him,
once you've met him

733
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:57,463
That's why I chose him

734
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:07,713
Why?
- If the two of you are so close...

735
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:12,075
why wasn't he in Switzerland with you?
You do have a lot many friends, Gaurav

736
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:19,489
If it's Isha you're referring to,
she's just a friend

737
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,565
The other night your Dad Lord Bhardwaj
started suspecting me for no reason

738
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:30,230
The truth my friend, is,
Isha loves only you

739
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,674
She told me herself.
But she's too shy to tell you

740
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:44,181
What are the two of you whispering?
- Just telling him about you

741
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,351
Well, let me tell everyone

742
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:56,527
I love her very much, and very soon,
we're getting married

743
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:03,396
With those words,
you've changed my life

744
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:07,198
Suddenly, everything starts
looking great

745
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:45,629
"Before I saw you..."

746
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:50,467
"I never thought about it"

747
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:05,149
"There was no one..."

748
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:10,153
"no one was like you"

749
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:15,025
"After I saw you, I realised..."

750
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:25,337
"how beautiful the world is"

751
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:39,356
"Before I saw you..."

752
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:44,523
"I never thought about it"

753
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:49,369
"There was no one..."

754
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:54,370
"no one was like you"

755
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:59,205
"After I saw you, I realised..."

756
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:03,914
"how beautiful the world is"

757
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:09,986
"What a beautiful world this is"

758
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:25,897
"The same place"

759
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:28,407
"The same gardens"

760
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,934
"The same flowers"

761
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:33,339
"The same seasons"

762
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:48,261
"So many times I passed by..."

763
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:53,091
"but where was my heart?"

764
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:57,937
"After I saw you, I realised..."

765
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:02,767
"how beautiful the seasons are"

766
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:08,442
"What a beautiful season this is"

767
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:42,140
"Life was like a puzzle"

768
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:46,976
"My path was so lonely"

769
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:01,661
"I was walking..."

770
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:06,666
"towards some faraway goal"

771
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:11,501
"When I saw you, I realised..."

772
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:16,349
"I don't want to go
anywhere else"

773
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:21,351
"Now I don't want to go
anywhere else"

774
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:26,657
"Before I saw you..."

775
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:31,355
"I never thought about it"

776
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:36,193
"There was no one..."

777
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:41,030
"No one was like you"

778
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:45,903
"After I saw you, I realised..."

779
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:50,708
"How beautiful the world is"

780
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:55,712
"What a beautiful world this is"

781
01:34:56,323 --> 01:35:00,555
"What a beautiful season this is"

782
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:06,222
"Now I don't want to go anywhere else"

783
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,882
Stop, wait, listen, Gaurav

784
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:28,783
Tell me something. Why are you
after both Isha and Maya?

785
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:34,585
Can't fathom your Casanova act.
- If you could...

786
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:36,990
you would've been Yash Sabharwal.

787
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:41,695
Listen, just do what you've been told

788
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:46,106
This parcel should be in place tomorrow

789
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:56,779
Rohini darling, here I am.
What gives? It's been years...

790
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:58,474
since I saw you so excited

791
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:04,483
Who's the girl?

792
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,653
She's Indian. And someone you like.
- He's talking about Isha

793
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:15,799
Call up Mr Nair right away.
- You know I'd like to see Isha...

794
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:20,133
become my daughter-in-law, but...
- Dad, let me clear your doubt

795
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,805
Gaurav and Isha are just friends.
I've found out everything

796
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:28,781
That maybe so. But it's necessary
to know what lies in Isha's mind

797
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:55,267
I wish you came into my life,
I wish I could bare my heart to you

798
01:36:56,877 --> 01:37:01,837
But I don't know why I can't express
my personal feelings before you

799
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:07,009
I'm hesitant. I don't want my words
to hurt you

800
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:18,862
That's why I keep joking. But behind
this comic facade, there's a heart

801
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:21,534
And I'm very serious about you

802
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:36,249
You... here?

803
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:41,018
I came here to ask you something.
But I saw you sleeping

804
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:44,214
And I didn't want to wake you.
- What did you want to ask?

805
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:48,061
Some other time. Now go to bed

806
01:37:57,271 --> 01:38:01,640
What brings you to my bank?
- Good I met you here

807
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:05,070
I was going to come to your place.
- Anything important?

808
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:12,577
Yes and no. If you don't mind,
can you pass on this parcel to Isha?

809
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:17,689
Yes, why not? What's in it?
- Surprise gift from Gaurav

810
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:21,523
But not for your eyes

811
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:48,173
You... here?

812
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:54,684
I didn't know you're at home.
A parcel just arrived for you

813
01:39:55,389 --> 01:40:00,691
From Gaurav. I didn't want to see.
But... sorry

814
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:01,851
Wait, Taj

815
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,763
Taj, you're my best friend

816
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:12,368
Will you help me?

817
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,436
You say I'm your best friend
And you still have doubts?

818
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:20,708
What I'm about to tell you...

819
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:23,715
I haven't told anyone

820
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:32,720
If you've seen these photos,
you must've understood

821
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:39,054
Gaurav and I are very much in love.

822
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:42,896
You have faith in Gaurav?

823
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:45,563
I trust him blindly

824
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:51,175
But he's afraid of Uncle.
He has wrong notions of Gaurav

825
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:58,743
I want you to dispel your father's
notions. Tell him Gaurav is capable

826
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:03,116
He's a gentleman. Please Taj.
- Isha I know love is blind. But...

827
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:07,594
Lord Bhardwaj is never mistaken
when it comes to making out a man

828
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:13,760
I'm your best friend. I'll help you
always. But bad advice, never

829
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:17,760
So think before you do anything

830
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:27,942
Here he comes

831
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:31,112
Taj... you?
- Where's Gaurav?

832
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:35,613
Gaurav's address has changed.

833
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:42,453
He's so amorous of Maya, you will
find him only in Maya's hotel

834
01:43:07,114 --> 01:43:10,208
"Full moon or no moon..."

835
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:13,544
"it's a moonlit night"

836
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:20,554
"I'm with you,
you're with me"

837
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:37,577
"Whatever is or isn't..."

838
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:41,004
"one thing's for sure"

839
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:44,511
"So lovely..."

840
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:47,915
"is our coming together"

841
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:09,265
"What season is this, my love?"

842
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:15,039
"No clouds, no monsoons"

843
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:32,455
"But I feel as if..."

844
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,060
"as if it's raining..."

845
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:42,967
"when you're with me,
when I'm with you"

846
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:46,312
"Whatever is or isn't..."

847
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:49,639
"one thing's for sure"

848
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:53,145
"So lovely..."

849
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:56,820
"is our coming together"

850
01:45:56,049 --> 01:46:02,682
"With these fragile bonds of love..."

851
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:08,885
"let's bind each other"

852
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:29,443
"Our desires will bear fruit
tonight"

853
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:32,744
"So lovely..."

854
01:46:33,019 --> 01:46:36,420
"is our coming together"

855
01:46:36,623 --> 01:46:39,751
"Full moon or no moon..."

856
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,088
"it's a moonlit night"

857
01:46:43,463 --> 01:46:49,595
"I'm with you,
you're with me"

858
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:53,261
"So lovely..."

859
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:57,769
"is our coming together"

860
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,524
Isha... what are you doing here?

861
01:48:29,803 --> 01:48:33,534
Who's that girl?
- Girl? Which girl?

862
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:41,037
Who was the girl in bed with you?
- It isn't what you think, Isha

863
01:48:41,915 --> 01:48:44,713
I'm asking you who
you were sleeping with!

864
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:52,719
She's Maya. An old friend.
She arrived from India yesterday

865
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:57,921
She was alone. She called me up.
I came over to give her company

866
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:05,603
She had one too many a drink.
Whatever happened wasn't intended

867
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:14,246
Shouldn't have happened. Don't know how
I got carried away. Couldn't stop myself

868
01:49:17,417 --> 01:49:20,750
But I have no serious
involvement with her.

869
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:26,419
I'm in love with you
You're the one I'll marry

870
01:49:32,532 --> 01:49:36,263
How can a modern girl like you
think this way?

871
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:40,935
Shamelessness, villainy, nudity,
aren't modernisms

872
01:49:41,975 --> 01:49:44,205
Modern is one who is clean at heart.

873
01:49:46,146 --> 01:49:47,841
You turn out to be rotten, Gaurav!

874
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:50,783
I hate you!

875
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:57,786
Uncle was right about you.
Your intentions are malafide

876
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:01,124
I feel like slapping you,
breaking your face

877
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:08,631
My hatred is enough for you

878
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,665
Out of hatred for me,
you stand to lose, Isha

879
01:50:17,644 --> 01:50:23,981
I took you for a gentleman.
I trusted you. But you deceived me

880
01:50:24,684 --> 01:50:27,312
You're a cheat! A fraud!

881
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:35,821
Enough of this melodrama Isha!
Enough of playing the loyal woman

882
01:50:37,197 --> 01:50:42,499
You are the one who deceived me.
You gave me that spiel...

883
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:46,502
about the millionaire Yash Sabharwal
to make me feel jealous, to seduce me?

884
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:53,176
You took me for what? A naive fool?
You are the fraud

885
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:59,678
For a multi-millionaire, are you
any match? He wants to marry you?

886
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:09,186
And listen...

887
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:16,358
forget all that. Let's shake hands.
Never in your life will you find...

888
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:21,029
a better partner than me. Come on.
- Right you are

889
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:25,873
I'll never find a worse scoundrel.

890
01:51:27,147 --> 01:51:28,546
You are the limit of villainy

891
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:34,714
Good, I found out the truth about you
before introducing you to Daddy

892
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:40,554
Don't you show me your face again.
For me, you're dead!

893
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:27,973
I hope you didn't do any mischief
with me last night?

894
01:52:29,876 --> 01:52:33,778
I'll make mischief after marriage.
- That's what I like about you

895
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:44,455
Maya, I got to go out.
Something urgent. I'll be back soon

896
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:03,903
You don't cry in here.
In here people find succour

897
01:53:05,745 --> 01:53:10,580
You're right. No point weeping
over such scum

898
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:17,315
Forget the past. The future
awaits you. Think of that

899
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:20,992
I'm sure, tomorrow comes
with lots of happiness for you

900
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:26,821
was feeling so lonely.
Were it not for you...

901
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:32,998
I don't know what I might've done.
You're so nice, Taj

902
01:53:37,043 --> 01:53:42,345
Will you drop me to the university?
Dr Alam has called me

903
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:49,083
I happen to be your chauffeur.
- Not chauffeur. My closest friend

904
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:56,685
You wanted to see me?
- Yes, I've been expecting you

905
01:53:58,031 --> 01:53:59,896
Splendid news for you

906
01:54:00,733 --> 01:54:03,201
The chairman of the largest heart
hospital coming up in India, wishes...

907
01:54:03,736 --> 01:54:09,538
to meet you. He wants you to j5215oin his
hospital after completing your studies

908
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:13,045
Don't you refuse. Be there at
the Town Hall tomorrow morning

909
01:54:46,512 --> 01:54:49,242
You? The chairman?

910
01:54:49,515 --> 01:54:50,243
Yes

911
01:54:55,121 --> 01:55:00,650
Dr Alam might've told you about
my new hospital project

912
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:05,597
Yes, you are entrusting me with a huge
responsibility. Do you feel...

913
01:55:06,099 --> 01:55:09,626
you've chosen the right candidate?
- I've only chosen, Isha

914
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,301
The decision is upto you

915
01:55:18,278 --> 01:55:19,609
I want you to succeed

916
01:55:20,613 --> 01:55:25,915
I wish no one dies of heart disease.
Such a dreadful disease

917
01:55:26,486 --> 01:55:29,114
Whatever the disease
it's always dreadful

918
01:55:29,322 --> 01:55:34,954
Yes, but no one ought to get
heart disease. It's fatal

919
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:43,458
After your research, would you like to
join the Sabharwal Cardiac Hospital?

920
01:55:44,504 --> 01:55:47,769
No conditions, to tags
tied to this offer

921
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:51,310
I accept

922
01:55:53,846 --> 01:55:58,306
One small request. On your list
of friends, might there be...

923
01:55:58,918 --> 01:56:01,978
a little place for a little man?
- The space isn't there

924
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:08,827
But I'll try to make place.
I might manage something

925
01:56:11,431 --> 01:56:17,165
Can we begin trying
with a get-together?

926
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:22,668
Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow evening?

927
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:28,413
I'll pay my bill.
- With all your heart?

928
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:31,841
What? Bill.
- I was just joking. I'm sorry

929
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:35,348
But what's this about
splitting bills between friends?

930
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:39,521
I heard from someone,
life is a business

931
01:56:46,966 --> 01:56:51,198
Isha isn't back yet from the library?
Working for the final exams I guess?

932
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:54,873
She came back from the library
and she went out somewhere

933
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:59,374
Went out? Where?
- Off for an important meeting...

934
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:03,037
with her sponsor Yash Sabharwal.
Dr Alam was saying that...

935
01:57:03,249 --> 01:57:06,377
Mr Sabharwal wants her to get involved
with some important project

936
01:57:07,253 --> 01:57:11,747
Isha is a very mature girl, son.
- I know. But...

937
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:16,491
You know nothing. You don't know
what lies in a woman's heart

938
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:19,729
Dad, I'm here to discuss just that

939
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:23,066
Your suspicions about Gaurav
turned out to be completely true

940
01:57:25,304 --> 01:57:29,570
Isha knows the truth about him.
There's nothing between them now

941
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:39,410
If Isha has a close friend now,
it's your darling Taj

942
01:57:42,855 --> 01:57:44,914
Then I should be calling Mahesh
right away

943
01:57:47,427 --> 01:57:48,860
Kanchan and I are coming. Certainly

944
01:57:55,968 --> 01:58:00,462
Inder asks for Isha's hand
for his son

945
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:03,434
He has invited us to Scotland

946
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:12,109
What's on your mind?
Would you like a drink?

947
01:58:17,723 --> 01:58:19,054
But may I celebrate?

948
01:58:29,569 --> 01:58:35,201
You're right. One must never
jump to conclusions about...

949
01:58:35,875 --> 01:58:38,309
a man's character till such time
that one knows him intimately

950
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:44,214
I spoke rashly the other day.
But you display no bitterness

951
01:58:45,685 --> 01:58:47,312
Someone else would've
taken it to heart

952
01:58:49,255 --> 01:58:55,160
To tell you the truth,
I did find your words bitter

953
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:58,094
But after you left, I gave it
another thought

954
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:04,335
And my regard for you increased.
I thought it was vanity

955
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:05,996
But it was actually
your self-confidence

956
01:59:06,839 --> 01:59:07,533
Your philosophy...

957
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:09,341
your confidence...

958
01:59:10,309 --> 01:59:11,173
your principles...

959
01:59:11,944 --> 01:59:12,535
are your wealth

960
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:17,006
Enough Mr Yash! You're praising me
to the skies!

961
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:21,351
Isha, you are as pretty as an angel.

962
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:28,020
And angels belong in the Heavens

963
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:19,577
What happened?
- Nothing. Maya, let's go elsewhere

964
02:00:20,613 --> 02:00:24,640
Why, what's wrong with this place?
Getting a reservation was tough

965
02:00:57,316 --> 02:01:05,951
Strange is the tale of our friendship.
Others might not even believe it

966
02:01:06,525 --> 02:01:09,323
Why?
- Some people imagine...

967
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:12,060
it's impossible for rich men
like you...

968
02:01:12,965 --> 02:01:15,456
wanting to marry a simple staid
middle class girl like me

969
02:01:16,869 --> 02:01:22,034
Life is stranger than fiction, Isha.
- I know

970
02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:29,971
But some fools cannot understand that.
Anyway, I think I should accept...

971
02:01:30,182 --> 02:01:31,342
your proposition.
- Which proposition?

972
02:01:38,691 --> 02:01:41,683
Let's make memorable
our first meeting

973
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:15,017
Yes, but you just said...

974
02:02:17,797 --> 02:02:20,027
Sure, but you just...

975
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:23,527
But...

976
02:02:50,162 --> 02:02:51,390
Turn around and take a look

977
02:02:52,264 --> 02:02:53,629
They look like such a romantic couple

978
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:21,122
Jealous?

979
02:03:26,632 --> 02:03:28,600
Let's dance too

980
02:03:35,307 --> 02:03:37,605
You've cut your hand!
You're bleeding

981
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:41,940
Relax, I'll be back

982
02:03:47,353 --> 02:03:50,447
It's past eleven!
I got to make an urgent call

983
02:03:50,689 --> 02:03:53,453
Be seated. I'll be back

984
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:58,696
Gaurav, how did you cut your hand?

985
02:04:03,169 --> 02:04:07,629
The girl who wouldn't talk to me
comes straight into my arms

986
02:04:10,176 --> 02:04:13,907
You're really the grandmaster
of love, amour and romance

987
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,385
Do you know Gaurav?

988
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:23,979
What Gaurav?

989
02:04:25,024 --> 02:04:30,155
The boy who was sitting here with me.
He saw you and your partner

990
02:04:30,362 --> 02:04:30,987
And God knows what came over him

991
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:38,198
Listen Miss, I don't socialise
with wastrels

992
02:04:38,504 --> 02:04:43,669
Wastrel? What do you mean?
- Bedmates in your parlance...

993
02:04:43,876 --> 02:04:49,746
might be modernistic. But in
my society, they're called wastrels

994
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:55,346
What are you doing here, Gaurav?
If Isha comes to suspect...

995
02:04:56,055 --> 02:04:59,183
that we know each other,
it will all come to a zero

996
02:04:59,959 --> 02:05:03,360
Collect your money tomorrow,
and return to Bombay immediately

997
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:12,431
What rot are you talking?
Are you in your senses?

998
02:05:13,572 --> 02:05:18,475
Maya, what happened?
- She's drunk. And she's blabbering

999
02:05:21,146 --> 02:05:23,239
I told you, the ambience here
is no good

1000
02:05:31,423 --> 02:05:34,915
What happened?
- I shouldn't have taken the drink.

1001
02:05:35,661 --> 02:05:36,559
I just want to go home

1002
02:05:38,964 --> 02:05:40,727
Let me give them a check.
I'll be back

1003
02:05:44,503 --> 02:05:51,238
Gaurav, here's your grand reward.
A check of 1.45 million pounds

1004
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:57,743
100 million Rupees.
- Tax free. What are you thinking?

1005
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:00,278
Wondering.
- What?

1006
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:05,521
How many zeros in 100 million?

1007
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:24,939
We have a new client. He wants to
deposit a 1.45 million pound cheque

1008
02:06:25,578 --> 02:06:28,877
Drawn on the account
of Sabharwal Industries

1009
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:31,606
Sabharwal Industries?
- Yes

1010
02:06:31,817 --> 02:06:33,978
Owned by Yash Sabharwal?
- Yes

1011
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:35,649
Have you cross checked?

1012
02:06:36,722 --> 02:06:39,452
Sabharwal Industries has instructed
us to clear the cheque immediately

1013
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:00,543
And today, big businessman

1014
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:05,580
Like other Indians here, you too
have become very successful

1015
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:12,921
Are you being sarcastic?
- Give me a tip. What business

1016
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:17,090
begets an ordinary man millions
of pounds in so short a while?

1017
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:20,421
You must've sold something precious

1018
02:07:22,635 --> 02:07:24,159
What did you sell?

1019
02:07:26,338 --> 02:07:28,169
Tell me, what did you sell?

1020
02:07:30,376 --> 02:07:35,837
Tell me, what did you sell?

1021
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:49,352
My soul

1022
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:56,033
"I want to give you
a birthday gift too"

1023
02:08:42,414 --> 02:08:46,248
"I was unfaithful"

1024
02:08:46,552 --> 02:08:50,249
"I was uncaring"

1025
02:08:50,622 --> 02:08:54,422
"I broke your heart"

1026
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:58,423
"Broke mine too"

1027
02:08:58,797 --> 02:09:02,756
"You don't know how..."

1028
02:09:03,068 --> 02:09:04,763
"in memories of you..."

1029
02:09:05,137 --> 02:09:09,039
"I shall suffer in silence..."

1030
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:10,936
"all my life"

1031
02:10:01,693 --> 02:10:05,322
"Every rule of love..."

1032
02:10:05,864 --> 02:10:09,163
"I have flouted"

1033
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:21,837
"All my promises I have sold"

1034
02:10:22,214 --> 02:10:30,849
"Every vow I compromised"

1035
02:11:40,259 --> 02:11:43,422
"What love, amour, romance is..."

1036
02:11:44,463 --> 02:11:48,194
"now I know"

1037
02:11:56,775 --> 02:12:04,841
"But how will I get back
time that is lost?"

1038
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:09,111
"Time that is lost"

1039
02:12:44,356 --> 02:12:49,658
Dad, Gaurav came to our bank today,
with a 1.45 million pound cheque

1040
02:12:51,363 --> 02:12:56,733
A 1.45 million pound cheque?
Where did Gaurav land so much money?

1041
02:12:57,703 --> 02:12:59,000
Mr Yash Sabharwal gave it to him

1042
02:13:00,706 --> 02:13:03,675
The one who gave Isha
that scholarship?

1043
02:13:07,312 --> 02:13:10,008
On one hand, he hands out scholarships.
On the other hand...

1044
02:13:10,649 --> 02:13:13,209
100 million Rupees
to a wastrel like Gaurav?

1045
02:13:13,685 --> 02:13:16,210
But why? I don't get this

1046
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:23,318
Get Isha to invite Mr Yash Sabharwal
over for dinner

1047
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:30,035
Yes, I'm coming over to Lord Bhardwaj's
for dinner. Can I ever refuse you?

1048
02:13:31,803 --> 02:13:32,929
See you at eight this evening

1049
02:13:39,978 --> 02:13:43,311
On the other hand, we're thankful.
Were it not for your generosity...

1050
02:13:43,515 --> 02:13:47,713
Isha might never have been in Scotland.
- Were it not for Isha in Scotland...

1051
02:13:47,919 --> 02:13:48,851
you might not have come to our house.

1052
02:13:51,556 --> 02:13:53,786
Somewhere or the other
every episode is connected.

1053
02:13:54,993 --> 02:13:58,053
In a chain of events,
one follows the other

1054
02:13:59,364 --> 02:14:00,991
Right Isha?
- Yes?

1055
02:14:01,666 --> 02:14:07,161
Which chain of events leads you here?
- Must be business, Dad. Yesterday...

1056
02:14:07,372 --> 02:14:12,901
a new client at the bank was cashing a
1.45 million pound cheque drawn by you

1057
02:14:13,445 --> 02:14:18,849
The 100 million Rupees? We transact
millions worth of businesses everyday

1058
02:14:21,787 --> 02:14:25,587
Generally I don't discuss business
in public

1059
02:14:28,293 --> 02:14:30,989
Well then, let's have
something personal

1060
02:14:33,065 --> 02:14:36,762
In the mood of finding out about
my personal and private affairs?

1061
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:43,871
Maybe you don't know.
Alongwith the scholarship...

1062
02:14:45,043 --> 02:14:46,908
I gave Isha my heart too

1063
02:14:50,549 --> 02:14:53,609
Yash, you are embarrassing me

1064
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:59,022
But I got to say it today

1065
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,730
Why have the two of you
fallen silent?

1066
02:15:13,505 --> 02:15:18,306
Lord Bhardwaj, you're like
a father to Isha

1067
02:15:19,578 --> 02:15:21,512
Allow me to seek from you
Isha's hand in marriage

1068
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:23,673
I did it once before too.

1069
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:29,147
Only Isha can answer that

1070
02:15:30,522 --> 02:15:34,481
Isha knows already
that I await her

1071
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:43,233
We'll keep seeing each other
from now on

1072
02:15:53,378 --> 02:15:56,506
Isha, you don't know this.
But it was Yash Sabharwal...

1073
02:15:56,715 --> 02:15:58,512
who gave Gaurav
a 100 million cheque

1074
02:16:08,226 --> 02:16:10,786
Your love story is
ready to roll now!

1075
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:21,199
What are you doing here in Scotland?

1076
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:29,303
I'm here to return your cheque.
- What? You want more money?

1077
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:37,885
No. I was under the impression
that money makes a man. I was wrong

1078
02:16:39,391 --> 02:16:42,588
I don't want to step on
someone's heart to climb

1079
02:16:44,963 --> 02:16:45,588
Now I see

1080
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:54,002
Now I know why you got so worked up
seeing Isha dancing with me

1081
02:16:55,774 --> 02:16:57,867
Have you fallen in love
with Isha for real?

1082
02:16:59,077 --> 02:17:03,673
Not to get tense, Mr Yash. I'm not
standing between you and Isha

1083
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:11,086
I'm sure you will make her happy.
- If that is what you think...

1084
02:17:12,857 --> 02:17:15,587
then keep this money.
You have earned it

1085
02:17:17,295 --> 02:17:17,920
Bravo!

1086
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:21,091
What a trade-off!

1087
02:17:22,234 --> 02:17:25,931
Little did I know that there's
a market for love too

1088
02:17:27,405 --> 02:17:32,308
A market where men sell and buy
a woman's love

1089
02:17:34,212 --> 02:17:38,945
Gaurav! What do you take me for?
A plastic barbie to play with...

1090
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:43,078
till I take your fancy, whereafter
to be sold to someone else?

1091
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:54,465
And Mr Yash! Have you so much money
that you can buy someone's love?

1092
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:58,030
Want to buy a lover for 100 million?

1093
02:17:59,337 --> 02:18:00,998
No Isha, no!

1094
02:18:02,207 --> 02:18:09,340
Whatever I did was for the sake
of your love. I love you dearly

1095
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:15,516
Before the sacred fires, I want to
take you as my wife, as my bride

1096
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:20,083
Relationship between man and wife
is based on respect

1097
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:25,656
What scant respect I had for you,
you have lost

1098
02:18:27,699 --> 02:18:31,829
When I do not respect you, how
can I accept you as my husband?

1099
02:18:32,537 --> 02:18:38,840
Isha, I want you with all my heart.
I had no intention of hurting you

1100
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:46,679
In my obsession with you,
I lost my head. That's it

1101
02:18:47,452 --> 02:18:55,359
Mr Yash, not money.
It takes a heart to win a heart.

1102
02:18:56,728 --> 02:18:58,025
But you won't understand

1103
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:02,531
Because for you,
life is a business.

1104
02:19:03,802 --> 02:19:06,032
But love is not a business

1105
02:19:14,546 --> 02:19:18,209
But she refused Yash Sabharwal
long ago

1106
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:22,946
What a scene Isha is creating!
- Enough of her whims

1107
02:19:24,055 --> 02:19:30,153
Let her come. Let me talk to her.
- Don't force her to marry Taj

1108
02:19:34,699 --> 02:19:39,727
Daddy! Mummy! This is so sudden!
No one even told me...

1109
02:19:40,905 --> 02:19:44,068
You've been springing surprises
on everyone. So we thought...

1110
02:19:44,275 --> 02:19:45,640
why not spring a surprise on you?

1111
02:19:47,545 --> 02:19:52,744
What have you done to yourself?

1112
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:56,719
Why do you look depressed?

1113
02:19:58,256 --> 02:19:59,689
Have you been crying?

1114
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:06,757
Please take me home with you

1115
02:20:09,367 --> 02:20:13,428
I don't want to study anymore.
I just want to go back

1116
02:20:14,305 --> 02:20:15,602
Just take me to India

1117
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:22,204
Take me home, Ma!
- Everything's going to work out fine

1118
02:20:23,648 --> 02:20:29,280
Have you had your whim now?
And what will you do back in India?

1119
02:20:31,122 --> 02:20:33,022
You know why destiny brought you
to Scotland?

1120
02:20:34,826 --> 02:20:36,123
For you to meet Taj

1121
02:20:38,496 --> 02:20:40,964
You will never find such love again.

1122
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:48,128
We want the 25-year friendship...

1123
02:20:48,339 --> 02:20:49,465
between your father and Lord Bhardwaj
to culminate into a relationship

1124
02:20:51,009 --> 02:20:55,139
Our surprise for you is
your betrothal to Taj

1125
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,978
But the final decision
must be yours, Isha

1126
02:20:58,483 --> 02:21:03,079
Isha, ever since you have claimed
your right as our daughter

1127
02:21:04,355 --> 02:21:06,186
We gave you your every whim.

1128
02:21:07,425 --> 02:21:10,826
Today, may I claim my
right as a father?

1129
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:14,826
Daddy... Uncle...

1130
02:21:17,635 --> 02:21:19,762
You've seen more of life
than I have.

1131
02:21:20,672 --> 02:21:23,607
Whatever you decide will be
in the best of my interests

1132
02:21:25,844 --> 02:21:28,836
Your decision will be mine

1133
02:21:54,906 --> 02:21:56,533
What an ad film!

1134
02:21:58,710 --> 02:22:00,041
Will someone even praise me?

1135
02:22:00,912 --> 02:22:06,214
I'll be all praise for you.
You've made a wonderful ad film

1136
02:22:12,223 --> 02:22:12,882
You, here?

1137
02:22:15,059 --> 02:22:17,892
When did you come?
- I got to talk to you, Maya

1138
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:21,227
Let's go to the cafe.
- No Maya

1139
02:22:22,467 --> 02:22:24,059
I want to tell you something
in front of everyone

1140
02:22:26,604 --> 02:22:29,505
Personal matters in public?

1141
02:22:31,543 --> 02:22:33,238
I'm returning to India
on important business

1142
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:38,409
What's this sudden business?
Stay back for a day

1143
02:22:38,716 --> 02:22:39,580
Day after tomorrow,
we'll travel together

1144
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:44,916
We aren't travelling together, Maya.
My path is different

1145
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:49,586
Different path?
What are you saying.

1146
02:22:51,262 --> 02:22:53,025
Don't you rile me
with these fallacies

1147
02:22:54,032 --> 02:22:55,659
Falsehood was what I've been
telling you all along

1148
02:22:57,235 --> 02:23:00,204
But today, I'll tell the truth
before everyone

1149
02:23:02,106 --> 02:23:07,271
And the truth is,
I never loved you

1150
02:23:09,147 --> 02:23:14,050
I came to Scotland to woo Isha,
on Yash Sabharwal's behalf

1151
02:23:15,787 --> 02:23:18,984
What I did with you the other night
was part of the assignment

1152
02:23:21,793 --> 02:23:25,957
In my lust for 100 million,
I betrayed Isha

1153
02:23:27,665 --> 02:23:30,133
I betrayed you,
I betrayed myself

1154
02:23:31,002 --> 02:23:33,402
I can understand what you
might be going through, Maya

1155
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:42,439
For I'm heartbroken too.
I've lost the one I was in love with

1156
02:23:44,148 --> 02:23:44,671
But Maya...

1157
02:23:46,918 --> 02:23:48,385
I don't want to lose your friendship.

1158
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:53,322
Forgive me, please

1159
02:23:57,862 --> 02:24:00,330
Asking me to forgive you
is making another mistake

1160
02:24:04,302 --> 02:24:05,826
You don't ask friends
to forgive you

1161
02:24:08,206 --> 02:24:09,833
Friends are forgiving, always

1162
02:24:14,145 --> 02:24:17,012
The world over, it's custom that
the engagement is held...

1163
02:24:17,281 --> 02:24:20,079
by the bridespeople.
And so it shall be

1164
02:24:21,052 --> 02:24:26,354
That will take us to India.
- Dr Alam, you place us in a quandary

1165
02:24:26,724 --> 02:24:32,526
And I have a solution. Mr Nair,
Isha is like a daughter to me

1166
02:24:33,264 --> 02:24:37,860
Consider my house your home,
and come with me

1167
02:24:38,236 --> 02:24:39,863
But...
- But Dr Alam...

1168
02:24:40,071 --> 02:24:45,771
No excuse will do. Taj and Isha
are getting engaged at my place

1169
02:24:45,977 --> 02:24:47,535
Come on, this brooks no more delay

1170
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:52,811
Congratulations, son. The engagement
has been fixed for the 25th

1171
02:24:55,486 --> 02:24:57,477
A lady has come to meet you

1172
02:25:09,267 --> 02:25:10,234
We bump in again?

1173
02:25:12,737 --> 02:25:16,730
Remember how we bumped into each other
for the first time?

1174
02:25:18,876 --> 02:25:21,572
But maybe this is our last meeting.
- Last meeting?

1175
02:25:23,681 --> 02:25:24,613
Tomorrow I'm returning to India

1176
02:25:26,284 --> 02:25:32,416
Before leaving, I wanted to thank you.
You've helped me a lot

1177
02:25:34,792 --> 02:25:37,260
You must attend my engagement
before returning

1178
02:25:43,468 --> 02:25:44,594
But...
- Don't refuse

1179
02:25:45,636 --> 02:25:47,604
I want to share my happiness
with everyone

1180
02:25:51,309 --> 02:25:52,867
Okay, I'll come

1181
02:25:58,116 --> 02:26:00,949
Why have you brought her here, Ruby?
- I don't know what, but she has...

1182
02:26:01,152 --> 02:26:02,949
something important to tell you

1183
02:26:05,356 --> 02:26:09,952
If you don't listen to me today,
you'll cry for the rest of your life

1184
02:26:13,931 --> 02:26:19,961
Whatever you say that night
was a sham

1185
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:27,141
There's nothing illicit between
Gaurav and myself

1186
02:26:29,847 --> 02:26:34,477
It was for Yash Sabharwal's sake
that he feigned to be in love with us

1187
02:26:37,855 --> 02:26:39,880
He wanted to mould you
in favour of Yash

1188
02:26:42,393 --> 02:26:47,660
But in the course of the game,
he fell in love with you, for real

1189
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:00,841
I'm just a friend

1190
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,839
So much of all this happened,
and you told me not a thing, Isha?

1191
02:27:09,053 --> 02:27:13,012
He regrets deeply what he has done.
Forgive him

1192
02:27:15,226 --> 02:27:19,856
Now it's too late, Maya.
- No Isha! Let me tell Taj...

1193
02:27:20,064 --> 02:27:22,658
all about it. He's a friend of mine.
I'll make him see reason

1194
02:27:24,902 --> 02:27:26,529
You'll do nothing of the sort, Ruby!

1195
02:27:28,606 --> 02:27:30,540
Will you be able to live
without Gaurav?

1196
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:37,074
Let me be

1197
02:27:39,717 --> 02:27:43,118
I've made more than enough
of a spectacle of myself

1198
02:27:46,958 --> 02:27:53,227
I don't want to make a spectacle
of my parents and Uncle

1199
02:27:56,634 --> 02:28:01,071
Maya, will you do me one more favour?

1200
02:28:03,507 --> 02:28:06,965
Gaurav, I just met Isha.

1201
02:28:07,612 --> 02:28:09,079
She sends you a message

1202
02:28:14,785 --> 02:28:18,312
Gaurav, we dreamt too.
But dreams never come true

1203
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:25,923
Tomorrow, I'm getting engaged to Taj.
The beginning of a new life

1204
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:28,426
A new relationship

1205
02:28:31,802 --> 02:28:33,599
Before embarking on
the new relationship...

1206
02:28:35,573 --> 02:28:38,940
for one last time, I wish to see you
to my heart's content

1207
02:28:44,315 --> 02:28:50,777
Isha's engagement to Taj
is confirmed. Forget Isha

1208
02:28:50,988 --> 02:28:53,718
I cannot forget Isha!

1209
02:28:56,027 --> 02:28:57,824
And I won't let this engagement happen

1210
02:28:58,162 --> 02:29:01,928
No use being adamant anymore

1211
02:29:08,506 --> 02:29:10,838
I'm here to invite you to
Taj's engagement with Isha

1212
02:29:11,342 --> 02:29:13,207
Happening at my place.
Make sure you come

1213
02:29:13,945 --> 02:29:18,348
Lots of important folks are coming.
You get to meet all kinds of folks...

1214
02:29:18,683 --> 02:29:21,652
at parties like these. Look at us.
This is how we meet

1215
02:29:26,624 --> 02:29:28,489
But I won't be able to attend
this engagement

1216
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:33,690
You must! You've done so much for
Isha. You gave her the scholarship

1217
02:29:33,898 --> 02:29:35,160
You're getting her involved
in the new project

1218
02:29:36,367 --> 02:29:39,825
You must attend her engagement.
No excuses

1219
02:29:40,705 --> 02:29:46,166
If you won't come, I'll barge in here
to pick you up. You'll come, won't you?

1220
02:29:46,711 --> 02:29:54,174
Don't badger me. I don't want to attend.
- I know why you don't want to attend

1221
02:29:55,386 --> 02:30:01,018
Because you couldn't win Isha's love?
Mr Yash, it was because of you...

1222
02:30:01,225 --> 02:30:06,094
that Isha and Gaurav are heartbroken.
Lovers have been torn apart forever

1223
02:30:06,297 --> 02:30:11,030
Because of you! In the least,
you can attend Isha's engagement?

1224
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:15,037
Won't make any difference to you,
if you don't attend.

1225
02:30:16,741 --> 02:30:20,802
But of you do some
miracle might happen.

1226
02:30:22,246 --> 02:30:23,736
You're the one who started
this game, Mr Yash

1227
02:30:23,948 --> 02:30:25,279
And you're the one who
can put an end to it.

1228
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:28,978
Sorry if I spoke too much

1229
02:30:32,656 --> 02:30:34,715
Of tale's end,
I know nothing.

1230
02:30:36,093 --> 02:30:40,553
But this engagement,
I must bring to an end

1231
02:30:43,601 --> 02:30:47,731
But he's adamant! He won't listen!
Please come over immediately

1232
02:30:47,938 --> 02:30:48,404
Else, everything will go awry.
- Very well, Hassubhai

1233
02:30:49,774 --> 02:30:52,072
I'm taking the morning flight
to Scotland

1234
02:31:51,669 --> 02:31:52,465
What happened?

1235
02:31:55,339 --> 02:32:01,642
You're looking beautiful
except for tears in those eyes

1236
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,474
Let me take your tears, Isha

1237
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:13,313
I can't share them with anyone.
I'm tied to my tears

1238
02:32:14,692 --> 02:32:18,992
What a thing to say. Today's a day for
celebrations. On a day like this...

1239
02:32:19,196 --> 02:32:23,496
you don't talk of these things. I don't
want to see tears in your eyes, ever

1240
02:32:24,568 --> 02:32:27,162
I want you to have every happiness
in the world

1241
02:32:30,875 --> 02:32:33,343
Let sorrow's shadow stay
miles from you

1242
02:32:34,378 --> 02:32:38,838
Gaurav, is this where
our story ends?

1243
02:32:40,584 --> 02:32:43,018
Were we to have been together
only for so long?

1244
02:32:43,587 --> 02:32:46,181
Silly. The One sitting up there...

1245
02:32:47,124 --> 02:32:49,354
takes our lives through
shadow and sunshine

1246
02:32:50,561 --> 02:32:54,019
But whatever He writes
is always for the best.

1247
02:32:55,132 --> 02:32:58,033
Only, we don't understand

1248
02:32:59,270 --> 02:33:04,367
I was just a fellow-traveller, for a
while; not your companion for life

1249
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:08,708
You're lying!
All these are lies!

1250
02:33:09,747 --> 02:33:10,714
Look at these pictures!

1251
02:33:11,282 --> 02:33:16,549
Tell me, are they not true?
- All this was just a sham, Isha

1252
02:33:17,254 --> 02:33:20,712
You can get away lying to me, Gaurav.
But you can't lie to yourself

1253
02:33:21,358 --> 02:33:25,727
How long will you deny loving me
as much as I love you?

1254
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:30,060
You must purge your mind,
your heart of me, Isha

1255
02:33:32,703 --> 02:33:34,898
Because I was your past.

1256
02:33:35,306 --> 02:33:40,744
Taj is your dawning day.
Don't be unjust to him

1257
02:33:41,312 --> 02:33:43,576
I won't live if I lose you!

1258
02:33:44,782 --> 02:33:46,909
Our story is over, Isha

1259
02:33:47,618 --> 02:33:48,915
As of now, we're strangers

1260
02:33:50,988 --> 02:33:55,925
I don't want to get engaged, Gaurav!
Please! Please save me!

1261
02:33:57,127 --> 02:33:59,425
You have a big
responsibility to save.

1262
02:34:00,731 --> 02:34:01,595
Today, you have to save...

1263
02:34:02,333 --> 02:34:06,269
your father's prestige,
Lord Bhardwaj's prestige

1264
02:34:06,971 --> 02:34:09,269
You must save Taj's prestige.

1265
02:34:10,341 --> 02:34:11,603
I have fallen from grace

1266
02:34:13,210 --> 02:34:15,440
I couldn't save myself.
How can I save you?

1267
02:34:17,481 --> 02:34:20,450
If I instigate you, I will be
the worse off for my ill-repute

1268
02:34:21,418 --> 02:34:23,943
And this I'm not going
to let happen. Because...

1269
02:34:24,221 --> 02:34:26,451
I brought you and everyone else
to much anguish

1270
02:34:29,660 --> 02:34:34,962
But I'm certain that
you will save me

1271
02:34:47,845 --> 02:34:49,472
You're right, Gaurav

1272
02:34:53,017 --> 02:34:54,985
The moment Taj gives me the ring,

1273
02:34:57,254 --> 02:35:00,815
I'll be distanced from you, forever

1274
02:35:03,861 --> 02:35:09,322
We will live on,
but never shall meet

1275
02:35:13,037 --> 02:35:14,504
I'm going to belong
to someone else

1276
02:35:17,274 --> 02:35:18,172
Forever

1277
02:35:21,278 --> 02:35:23,007
Now we've really become strangers

1278
02:35:25,716 --> 02:35:27,183
Go away now

1279
02:35:28,485 --> 02:35:30,510
Else, my resolve will weaken again

1280
02:35:38,962 --> 02:35:41,863
Let the pictures be.
- Don't be silly, Isha

1281
02:35:43,734 --> 02:35:45,201
I shall never see you again

1282
02:35:45,769 --> 02:35:47,532
Gaurav! Have pity on me!

1283
02:35:47,771 --> 02:35:48,863
Don't do this!

1284
02:35:54,445 --> 02:35:58,040
What are you doing here?

1285
02:35:58,916 --> 02:36:03,046
I advised you to stay away
from my daughter-in-law

1286
02:36:03,854 --> 02:36:06,220
Isha! What is this man doing here?

1287
02:36:08,258 --> 02:36:08,883
He...

1288
02:36:11,328 --> 02:36:14,889
What's this gesticulating about?
What are you hiding?

1289
02:36:15,799 --> 02:36:19,394
Why are you crying?

1290
02:36:24,108 --> 02:36:24,733
Stop

1291
02:36:27,277 --> 02:36:28,073
Gaurav! I say stop!

1292
02:36:29,279 --> 02:36:31,907
You shall not leave here
before answering Dad

1293
02:36:32,616 --> 02:36:33,913
Step out of my way, Taj. Please

1294
02:36:34,818 --> 02:36:37,753
What are you hiding?
Tell me what you are hiding!

1295
02:36:39,957 --> 02:36:43,256
I beg of you!
Let me go.

1296
02:36:43,961 --> 02:36:45,258
For all of us,
it will be more honourable

1297
02:36:45,462 --> 02:36:52,095
Honour! A cheapskate talking about
honour! I'm going to expose you today!

1298
02:36:56,306 --> 02:36:56,772
Tell me!

1299
02:37:00,978 --> 02:37:02,775
What game have you
been playing with Isha?

1300
02:37:05,983 --> 02:37:07,951
Please let me leave.
- I'm not sparing you, not today!

1301
02:37:08,152 --> 02:37:11,451
Your eyes, your face says,
you are here with evil intent!

1302
02:37:12,156 --> 02:37:13,282
He made her cry!

1303
02:37:14,324 --> 02:37:15,791
Just tell me straight
what you're hiding

1304
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,958
Show me!
What's this?

1305
02:37:33,544 --> 02:37:35,136
This is the honour you speak of?

1306
02:37:37,014 --> 02:37:42,145
He's in the profession of seducing
innocent girls and blackmailing them

1307
02:37:43,854 --> 02:37:45,151
He's a pimp of sorts

1308
02:37:46,523 --> 02:37:50,323
You think you can scare Isha
by showing these photos

1309
02:37:51,028 --> 02:37:54,828
You think you can blackmail her,
scare her into giving in to you?

1310
02:37:55,632 --> 02:37:59,329
Don't you harbour this misconception.
And get this clear

1311
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:02,168
Even if you have these photos
splashed across newspapers...

1312
02:38:02,573 --> 02:38:04,666
it won't make any difference
to me and my son

1313
02:38:07,644 --> 02:38:11,671
We know what kind of a girl Isha is.
She is the honour of my family

1314
02:38:12,583 --> 02:38:15,017
And you want to play with
my family honour?

1315
02:38:19,523 --> 02:38:23,516
I'm not sparing you today.
I'll teach you a lesson

1316
02:38:23,794 --> 02:38:27,696
Never again will you ruin
an innocent girl's family

1317
02:38:41,678 --> 02:38:46,047
100 million isn't enough for you?
How much more do you want? You scum!

1318
02:38:49,586 --> 02:38:51,383
What are you doing Lord Bhardwaj?

1319
02:38:54,258 --> 02:38:56,726
How much will you give him? How much?

1320
02:38:58,428 --> 02:39:03,388
He has refused all my wealth,
in this age of rupees and dollars

1321
02:39:04,101 --> 02:39:07,229
The man who refuses so much,
is either a madman

1322
02:39:08,105 --> 02:39:11,074
Or else, a true lover.
- He's no lover

1323
02:39:11,775 --> 02:39:15,734
He's a blackmailer, Mr Sabharwal.
- No knowing what sin...

1324
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:19,578
He wanted to lead Isha into
using those romantic photos

1325
02:39:19,783 --> 02:39:21,080
No, Dr Alam

1326
02:39:21,952 --> 02:39:24,921
Not Gaurav, I am the sinner.

1327
02:39:26,623 --> 02:39:28,090
His sin is merely...

1328
02:39:29,293 --> 02:39:34,253
being a poor, needy, honest boy.

1329
02:39:35,132 --> 02:39:37,430
If punishment is what
you want punish me.

1330
02:39:37,634 --> 02:39:39,761
If it's someone you want
to shoot, shoot me

1331
02:39:43,307 --> 02:39:47,107
I used them

1332
02:39:48,812 --> 02:39:52,612
I tried to lure Gaurav with
a hundred million...

1333
02:39:53,817 --> 02:39:54,943
into selling Isha's love

1334
02:39:58,488 --> 02:40:05,792
I was convinced that money
is the greatest power on earth

1335
02:40:06,997 --> 02:40:13,300
I thought Yash Sabharwal could buy
anything for money. But I was mistaken

1336
02:40:15,505 --> 02:40:20,636
The two of them have made me realise
that more powerful than money...

1337
02:40:22,679 --> 02:40:27,639
is love, amour, romance

1338
02:40:29,019 --> 02:40:30,316
That, which they possess

1339
02:40:34,524 --> 02:40:41,327
and as long as they have this power,
no one can set them apart. No one can

1340
02:40:44,868 --> 02:40:50,329
Lord Bhardwaj, open your eyes,
feel the love between Gaurav and Isha

1341
02:40:50,874 --> 02:40:53,342
This isn't an engagement.

1342
02:40:54,211 --> 02:40:56,008
This is a compromise, Lord Bhardwaj

1343
02:40:56,880 --> 02:41:01,681
No one has compelled Isha.
- She gave her free consent

1344
02:41:01,885 --> 02:41:03,512
Ask Isha

1345
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:09,181
My child, break your silence now.
- In front of everyone...

1346
02:41:09,393 --> 02:41:13,853
just clarify whether you're
getting engaged of your own volition

1347
02:41:15,399 --> 02:41:21,201
Isha, those in love care for none.
Speak your heart. Tell everyone

1348
02:41:21,571 --> 02:41:22,196
Don't be afraid.

1349
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:25,868
Isha, my personal experience...

1350
02:41:26,410 --> 02:41:28,537
tells me that when you cannot
express your personal feelings...

1351
02:41:28,912 --> 02:41:33,372
if you hide things in your heart
you always stand to lose something

1352
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:37,208
Make known what lies in your heart.
- Before you say anything...

1353
02:41:38,255 --> 02:41:40,052
heed what I have said

1354
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:48,562
Everyone's waiting.
- Isha, reply him

1355
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:53,398
Isha, this is no day to be silent

1356
02:41:56,106 --> 02:42:00,566
What am I to say?
What reply am I to give him?

1357
02:42:01,778 --> 02:42:04,906
From all sides, I'm in a fix

1358
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:13,913
I can never live with having broken
your hearts, yours, Daddy's, Taj's

1359
02:42:17,961 --> 02:42:19,588
I accept this engagement

1360
02:42:24,134 --> 02:42:26,432
No one has coerced me

1361
02:42:30,140 --> 02:42:31,767
It's my decision

1362
02:42:45,155 --> 02:42:48,784
Isha, my child! Don't cry

1363
02:42:49,826 --> 02:42:52,624
Did you hear?
Have you got your reply?

1364
02:42:53,830 --> 02:42:57,288
Don't worry, Inder. Isha will enter
your family as a bride

1365
02:42:58,502 --> 02:43:01,130
This is the problem with daughters
in our country

1366
02:43:01,671 --> 02:43:04,469
Before their parents, they can't
speak their hearts

1367
02:43:05,008 --> 02:43:08,136
This confusion must've destroyed
countless homes

1368
02:43:18,021 --> 02:43:20,990
Life's most important decision
isn't taken in tears

1369
02:43:21,691 --> 02:43:25,491
And don't worry about Taj.
He's like me. Strong at heart

1370
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,826
Wait Gaurav

1371
02:43:34,204 --> 02:43:38,504
The red rose, the colour of the heart.
Tells tales of hearts, the world over

1372
02:43:39,209 --> 02:43:40,836
Go and give it to Isha

1373
02:43:47,217 --> 02:43:49,685
Before I accept the red rose,
I have a condition

1374
02:43:50,387 --> 02:43:54,687
First, you get engaged.
- For which, a girl is needed

1375
02:43:54,891 --> 02:43:59,351
That too, pure Indian.
- If Taj permits me...

1376
02:43:59,729 --> 02:44:04,189
I can propose a very nice,
very pretty Indian girl

1377
02:44:04,568 --> 02:44:07,366
Are you into the matchmaking business?

1378
02:44:08,238 --> 02:44:09,705
I was, from the very beginning

1379
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:16,875
I know this

1380
02:44:18,748 --> 02:44:24,050
You'll never find a better bride.
And there was nothing between us

1381
02:44:24,254 --> 02:44:26,051
It was just a sham

1382
02:44:28,091 --> 02:44:31,219
Say yes, Taj. Else you'll get
left behind

1383
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:38,898
Yash, why are you leaving in a huff?

1384
02:44:42,772 --> 02:44:46,230
Nice of you to have accepted
my invitation and come home

1385
02:44:46,943 --> 02:44:48,570
Because of you, all hearts
have been united

1386
02:44:49,446 --> 02:44:52,074
And now, you're leaving all alone?

1387
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:58,247
Ma... you?

1388
02:44:58,455 --> 02:44:59,922
I've come to know everything, son

1389
02:45:02,959 --> 02:45:07,589
He has always been a loner. And not
a clue to who he's destined for

1390
02:45:08,131 --> 02:45:14,434
Or whom he is waiting for.
- I too am waiting for a lone Indian

1391
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:19,772
I too get a feeling that she's
actually the queen of his dreams

1392
02:45:23,647 --> 02:45:26,946
This journey isn't a compulsion.
It should be a journey of heart

1393
02:45:29,152 --> 02:45:32,451
Isha, this isn't melodrama.
This is real

1394
02:45:41,331 --> 02:45:41,956
What's it?

1395
02:45:42,832 --> 02:45:45,460
Pink rose means...

1396
02:45:53,677 --> 02:45:58,137
Rohini, get three rings!
Three pairs are waiting

1397
02:45:58,515 --> 02:46:00,312
Can someone tell me
which colour of rose...

1398
02:46:00,684 --> 02:46:05,485
do you give when you fall in love
after getting married?

1399
02:46:07,357 --> 02:46:10,326
After the wedding, the wife
can't be wooed with one rose

1400
02:46:11,027 --> 02:46:12,654
You got to give her
a whole bouquet...

1401
02:46:13,029 --> 02:46:14,997
of love, amour and romance
