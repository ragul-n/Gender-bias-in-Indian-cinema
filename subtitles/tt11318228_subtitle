00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
'Let it rain'

2
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,920
Come on!

3
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
I said, come on

4
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Come on

5
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,640
Come on

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,720
Come on, dammit.

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
It's better you move--

8
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,680
--If not I'll make
soup out of your horns.

9
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,480
It's for you own good. 
Come on.

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,400
Come on, damn it.

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
Velusamy uncle is here,

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
he's going to win the
election this time

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
On that day,
you'll be served on a platter.

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,520
- Son, pull it out
- Uncle.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,440
Pull it out, son.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
Come on, pull it out.

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,720
Hurry up,
the tractor is going to leave.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
It's getting late,
please board sooner.

19
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Mmmm...hold this.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
Keep it moving.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,040
Come on, board the tractor.

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,760
Be careful.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,080
Come on, hurry up.

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,480
Bose, I thought you'll
arrange a car for your mother,

25
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
instead you got a tractor.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,240
What if something goes wrong
with me on this rough ride?

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,040
Do you really think,
this will harm you?

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
You'll live a long
life, with no qualms.

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,320
Get on it. Let's finish our prayers
sooner and complete the rituals.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
There's a lot of election
work pending at the moment.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Hey, bolt it up.

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
Where's Selva?
He's been missing for long

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,760
He's never home. He's always lurking
around the fields and the forest.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Where are you coming from?

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,720
Why are you holding a billhook?

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Dad...

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
Uncle...

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
Brother, Brother, Brother...

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
Ey-- lift him up.
Come on lift him up

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,280
Come on, lift him up.
Hold his leg

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,000
Lift him up

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,960
Handle him carefully

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,520
- Who was it?
- Who else do you think?

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Who?!
-Them brothers!

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,480
We were just talking,
they feared defeat and hacked me down.

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
Take him to the hospital.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Hey...hey catch him

48
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
Look, Dad is here.

49
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Dear...

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,160
- Nothing happened, Chandra
- What happened?!

51
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
Hey Selva, come here

52
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,200
- What happened?
- I said nothing happened

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
Oh no!

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Can you please tell
me what happened?

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
Come on, Mangai climb up.

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
- Pray to the deity.
- Almighty...

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
...will you take good
care of our children?

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
What happened?

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
Your shirt is full
of blood stains

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
The opposite party
attacked my brother

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
They didn't want my brother
to win the elections.

62
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
What happened to Brother-in-law?

63
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,120
He survived.

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,080
I got him admitted
at the hospital

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,440
But-- the guys I attacked,

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,400
might not make it alive.

67
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
Hey, stop crying

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,680
it's temporary.
I'll be out of the prison in no time.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
My party will bail me out.

70
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,200
Listen, instead of crying...

71
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
...try and make my
mother understand.

72
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Selva, you will have to take
care of your mother and sister.

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,160
Don't be playful all the time.

74
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,280
Dad, will come back
as soon as possible.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,400
"I'm shattered by
my dear son's loss"

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,000
"He was the life
of this village"

77
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,280
"My dear you've lost
your beloved husband"

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,600
"Our dearest has
left us in despair"

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,120
Please listen to
what I have to say

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
Hey, what's happening?
Hear me out

81
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
- Step aside
- Where are you taking him?

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,920
- Where are you taking him?
- Partner!

83
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
Sir, let go of him.
How can you do this?

84
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,720
Partner, don't you
worry, we're here for you

85
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,120
- Partner...
- Let go of him, damn it

86
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,320
Partner, don't worry 
we're there for you.

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,120
'Central Jail - Madhrai'

88
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,400
How are you dear?

89
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,720
[Overlapping Chatter]

90
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,480
Don't you understand?
Don't speak nonsense.

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Did you come here to
show me your long face?

92
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
Let me know what's
been happening?

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's been long since
I heard your voice.

94
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,840
I can manage without
money, house or a job

95
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
but I'm not sure how to manage
everything without a husband.

96
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm not able to go out
for social gatherings,

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,440
nor I can go out 
to buy anything

98
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
It's become hard to move
around the neighborhood.

99
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,600
The entire town is shaming us.

100
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
Stop whining about it.

101
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm not the first
person to be imprisoned

102
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,160
When they knew about
their defeat in election

103
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,080
rightfully they
should've backed off

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,400
They shouldnâ€™t have
resorted to violence

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Obviously when my brother got
attacked, I had to retaliate

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,800
Listen carefully,
we can't let go of our anger or ego

107
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,240
We'll always follow the
steps of our ancestors

108
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,560
So will be my kids too

109
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Enough!

110
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,840
Just 'cause you couldn't control your
anger, I don't want our kids to suffer.

111
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
Eh-- don't exaggerate now

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,640
You'll be taken care of, once Velusamy
brother is back from the hospital.

113
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
I beg of you...

114
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,680
...It's enough that your
brother brought this on you.

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,440
I'm gonna leave this
town with my kids

116
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
I'll make do somewhere else.

117
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
Where will you go?

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Have you gone mad?

119
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,960
How can you leave
everything behind?

120
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
I don't care!

121
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm just going far from here.

122
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,160
"Darling. Love. Princess"

123
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
"just the sight of you...

124
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,000
What's wrong with you?
Why are you leaving with the kids?

125
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,800
If I stay back,
then he'll do the same as his father

126
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
I had enough. Spare me from it.

127
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,400
How dare you?
How can you take away my grand kids.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,840
You couldn't raise your
sons grow up to be sane...

129
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,280
...I can't do the
same to my children

130
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
Spare us,
we're going far from here.

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
Go and sit there.
- "Trust me on this

anything -"'O' my dear

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,640
I'll come and meet you guys in Chennai

134
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,160

"just the sight of you makes
my heart burn with desire"

137
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,160
"Trust me on this 'O' my dear"
- How are you sister?

138
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,280
"if your name isn't mentioned,
monsoons go dry "-I'm good

139
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:19,240
"Your beauty is nothing less
than a gleam off the full moon"

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,120
"Speak to me with
love 'O' dear..."

141
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,480
Rowther, this the person
for whom I wanted a job

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
- She's from my town
- Vanakkam, Ma!

143
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Father is not living with them.
Moreover he's in the prison for murder...

144
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,320
...how do you expect
me to take him in?

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,560
My son is studying
in this same school.

146
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,720
Please understand and
make an exception.

147

"A speck of anger
in your eyes..."

148
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,080
He's my only son, Ramachandran.

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,320
When we got here first,
everything seemed new to us

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
but now I'm used to it.

151
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,000
Thanks!

152
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
- Uncle!
- Hey, Selvam

153
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
Uncle!

154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
- Mangai!
- Mangai, my sweetheart

155
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,880
- Please come inside
- Come in, mother.

156
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,040
The manager is
calling you inside.

157
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,200
Bose, they won the election with
sympathy votes stating double murder.

158
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,520
Neither our relatives nor
our friends vote for us.

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,640
I've been trying
hard to bail you out.

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,040
They're just giving false hopes

161
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,680
Nothing seems to be working out.

162
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,480
"You're my strength
and guardian"

163
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,040
"no matter what anyone
says, youâ€™re my better half"

164
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,560
"Love, I've been
waiting for your return"

165
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,960
Hey, Selva. 
Let go of him

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Let it go. If mom knows about
it, she'll kill you.

167
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,280
Hey, then don't bother telling her

168
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Ey-- what the hell
are you doing?

169
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,160
I've been asking 50
bucks for a week now

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,920
if you still don't give it to
me, I'll light myself on fire.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Here take it. Come on take it.

172
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,520
I'm going to open the door

173
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,040
If you dare hit me again,
I'll light myself on fire tomorrow

174
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
Hey...!

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Ram, get two 10 rupees tickets

176
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
Mangai, I'm really
scared about doing this

177
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
If you're scared
of your parents--

178
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,480
--you buy me a
ticket and get lost

179
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm only scared of Selva

180
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
If he comes to
know, he'll kill me.

181
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,720
- Mom, It wasn't me.
- Come over here

182
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,920
- It was Ram who made me do it
- I said come...

183
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Mom!

184
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,080
It's morning already,
please wake up dear.

185
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,240
Mangai, wake up and get the
milk, I need to drink coffee.

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,720
It was her turn yesterday.
But today it's Selva's turn

187
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,720
That's right, It's Selva's turn.

188
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,600
Son, looks like you
have to get the milk

189
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,400
He's tired from driving cab all
night, it's not fair to wake him up

190
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,400
Hey Selva! Your mother
is asking you to wake up.

191
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Preetha...

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,920
- It won't work out, Preetha
- Where do you want to go?

193
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,480
Just a long drive. 
Full speed!

194
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,560
You got this complex, Prathap

195
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
don't have negative thoughts

196
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,320
You're smart and a Casanova.

197
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,480
Preetha, I'm getting 
engaged next week.

198
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh-oh!
Hope you're not kidding with me?

199
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,640
Why would I be kidding with you?

200
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,280
Why didn't you say
anything earlier?

201
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
Before you asked me out

202
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
or before you kissed me

203
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Huh?!

204
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,040
Her father is my dad's friend from
Delhi, a successful business family

205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
Your father is nothing
compared to them

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,400
Driver stop the car

207
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,320
No, please keep heading straight

208
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,240
- Driver stop the car
- Driver, keep driving straight

209
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
- Stop the car!
- Why Preetha?

210
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,080
Stop the damn car!

211
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,960
Preetha, don't act 
like a crazy person

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,520
- Promise me, that you'll marry me?
- I can't do that now

213
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,240
What?!

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Hey-- Preetha!

215
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
your dad's business is in trouble

216
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Enforcement, Court

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
I can't do this right
now, come on.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hey!

219
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,200
Please, don't be stupid

220
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
don't get me into
unnecessary troubles

221
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
- Climb up, Prathap
- Preetha!

222
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,840
If you don't, then I'll jump.
Climb up

223
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
Preetha, you know 
that I have Vertigo

224
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,160
if you don't climb up,
I'll definitely jump off the bridge.

225
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,960
Promise, that you'll marry me

226
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,080
- Please understand, Preetha
- You're kidding with me right?

227
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,560
You'll marry me, right?

228
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,040
What did you just do now?

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,440
What did it look like?

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,080
- Does he know swimming?
- How would I know?

231
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,040
- Do you know swimming?
- None of your business

232
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,600
Do you know or not?

233
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
- I know
- Ah...

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
Then go and save him.

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,920
Help!

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Help!

237
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,000
- Help! Help!
- Looks like both can't swim

238
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Everyone at the hospital wants to
know how did this accident happen?

239
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,280
What should I say?

240
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,480
Thanks for saving
us like a hero.

241
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,520
Thousand rupees

242
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,800
You can leave now,
I'll take it from here

243
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,920
Your father, Police
inquiry, attempt to murder

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,400
do these things scare you?

245
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
I said, you can leave now

246
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
Oh, so the respect is receding

247
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Money does change things, right?

248
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,560
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone
that you attempted a murder

249
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
What?!
It was you who pushed me...

250
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,920
Preetha, the boy is ok

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,720
Thank goodness, nothing serious.
Just a tad bit water seeped into his lungs

252
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
Dad, he's the driver 
who saved us.

253
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
My name is not driver

254
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
- Selva!
- Oh...

255
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,080
...what caused this accident?

256
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,600
Umm...Ah...

257
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,320
He had too much to drink at the party.
He slipped and fell

258
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,480
It was her who
jumped in to save him

259
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,400
But you saved my daughter too

260
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,040
- Take this
- Cash?

261
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,440
So, if it's 2500 for a life?

262
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,160
so twice that makes a total of
5000, you're spot on, Sir.

263
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,120
Fine, why don't you tell
me, what's the right price?

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,640
Dad, I already paid him the fare.
Nothing else...

265
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,960
You tell me, Selva

266
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,240
A thank you, and a hand shake.

267
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Thank you!

268
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,880
Please visit us one day.
On a Friday...a weekend. Ok?

269
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,400
- Sure I'll come
- Good!

270
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
Velumani auntie,
your son has kidnapped me

271
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, just shut up.

272
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
Mom started my morning
with a long advice

273
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,560
What did she say?
That you'll be ruined in my company?

274
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,960
It's not that.

275
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,320
It was fine,
when we both were kids and playful

276
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
Mmm...fine?

277
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,400
Umm...you can't be seen
together all the time

278
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
You guys are grown ups now

279
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,160
Hey Ram, turn around

280
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Turn around.
Ram, I said turn around

281
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,600
Selvam, please listen

282
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey-- Selva!

283
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,160
Selva, Selva...let it go.

284
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,040
Stop fighting.
Aren't you guys friends?

285
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,880
If mom comes to know,
you'll be in trouble.

286
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,200
Then don't tell her anything.

287
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,760
Stop staring,
come and help me stop him.

288
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
Selva, come on let him go.
Please let him go

289
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,480
Let him go. Let him go, dammit!

290
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,080
Selva...!

291
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,280
- Fine, I let him go
- That's enough, Thiyagu bro

292
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
What's wrong with you, Selva?

293
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
Always picking
fights with people.

294
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm tired of your antics

295
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,040
- You really don't have sense.
- Hey!

296
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,320
Just 'cause your father is in prison,
that doesn't make you a gangster

297
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,240
how dare you lay hands on me?

298
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,400
You heard him right?

299
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,520
How can I keep my cool?

300
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,040
Selva-- Selva, don't do it

301
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,800
He's inside, you can meet him.

302
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,920
Who's your son?

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
Sir, she's Selva's mother.

304
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,400
If he repeats this act,
I'll definitely file an FIR.

305
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,320
Write down your address and sign it.
Then you can take him home.

306
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
Scoundrels like him don't belong at
home, let him rot here

307
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,320
Mom!

308
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
What's it? Tell me?

309
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,240
I had enough with your
father going to the prison

310
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
and now you're
following his footsteps

311
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,080
I came this far, 'cause I didn't
want you guys to have a violent life.

312
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,080
The entire bloodline is cursed.

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,920
Agreed, we'll discuss this later

314
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Sign the papers and get me out of here.
I'm hungry.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
Mangai, make her understand

316
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,080
Hey, I really don't
care about you anymore

317
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
- Stay right here...
- Mom!

318
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Mom...!

319
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,320
Mom!

320
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,160
Hey, stop screaming.
They'll let you out by evening.

321
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,320
If not I'll make arrangements

322
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
As if you're capable of it.

323
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Go and get mother

324
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,760
Mom! Mom!

325
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,200
Mom, why are you so
outraged about it?

326
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,080
- Hi, Uncle!
- Mangai!

327
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,560
That's great,
can't get any worse

328
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
Seems like your head was ringing

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,880
you're here at the right moment.

330
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,760
I came down to Koyembedu
to collect some cash

331
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Where's Selva?

332
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Oh him?
He's a freedom fighter right?

333
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,600
So he's been locked up at the
Police station for beating up a guy.

334
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
Police Station?

335
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,560
Where else? I thought moving
away would be good for them

336
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,920
But my ill fate, I'm still making
rounds to the Police station

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,080
Let him rot out there.

338
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,640
I did warn your father

339
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
not to get married but to stay
single and be happy like me

340
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
He never listened

341
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,120
It was you who got him married
to keep the family tree growing

342
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,520
Now see what you've done

343
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't keep blaming
me for everything

344
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,560
First, you go and get him!

345
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,920
Take this.
Police stations are not new to me

346
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,120
Come on, let's go.

347
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,200
Have your meal and then go

348
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
- You can finish it instead
- Hey...!

349
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
If it was the Police station from our
place, I would've got you out in a jiffy

350
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,320
the Police officers
here are too arrogant.

351
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,360
Hey Selva, please for God sake stay
calm and don't get into fights.

352
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,280
Selva and Mangai,
this is the Koyembedu Plantain Market.

353
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
It's fortune as good as
Tirupathi's donation bank

354
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,120
people make millions out here.

355
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,200
If you go wrong with accounts,
I'll beat you to pulp

356
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
- Paramasivam!
- Welcome, Boss!

357
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,560
You guys go and load the stock.

358
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
You've arrived with no notice

359
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
You never answered my
calls for past 2 days.

360
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,720
It's not easy to run a
business at Koyembedu

361
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,160
There are one too many
issues to be resolved.

362
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,120
Please sit down.

363
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,920
Are they your children?

364
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,520
They're my brother's.

365
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Oh your brother who
is in Madurai's prison

366
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,200
Hey Augustine, get me 3 teas

367
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,360
So, tell me boss,
who's your new vendor?

368
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,400
You refused to take it further,
so I'm trading locally at Theni.

369
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,400
I just came to visit my family
and also to settle the accounts.

370
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Accounts?
What are you talking about?

371
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,040
I listed down everything during the last
consignment and settled the account.

372
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,000
There's a pending
balance of 80,000 rupees

373
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,800
Boss, our previous deal
incurred me a loss of 2 Lacs

374
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,360
If I take the rotten bananas into
account, it'll add up to a truck's load

375
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
As this was our first deal

376
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,920
I didn't want to burn bridges

377
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,160
that's why I listed everything
and settled the account.

378
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,320
It's not fair that you're here
asking for another 80,000 rupees.

379
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,760
Look here Paramasivam,
I don't like foul play

380
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,080
In spite of my
partners warning me,

381
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
I took the risk of doing
business outside Theni.

382
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,120
Donâ€™t try to be over smart.

383
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm particular about the accounts.
Make the payment of 80,000.

384
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,360
Boss, this is not your village,
you can't talk to me like that

385
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
We follow our own
technique down here

386
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,160
Listen, I'm being calm,
'cause it's your hood

387
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,240
If it was my village,
you would've lost your hands and legs

388
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
Fine, you can do it
when I'm over there

389
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,560
Now, please get out.

390
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,520
Hey Augustine, cancel the Teas.

391
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,680
Hey! Can't you fix the vehicle?
Start the bloody vehicle

392
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,320
Oi, why the hell are
you following me?

393
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,280
Ey-- Ey-- what happened?

394
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
He punched me in the face

395
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,000
- Who?
- That's him, look he's coming

396
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Hey, hey, who the hell are you?

397
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,320
Hey, hey,
hey...what the hell are you doing?

398
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,680
Hey...hey...

399
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,800
Hey, how dare you...?

400
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,240
Sit down, damn it!

401
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,320
Just 'cause you own
a shop at Koyembedu

402
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,440
and dress like a rogue
doesn't make you a gangster

403
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,480
I'll kill you damn it.

404
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Uncle, take this. Let's go.

405
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,880
Uncle!

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Just one drink dear,
it'll help me sleep through the journey

407
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
can't stay awake for
10 straight hours

408
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,520
That's how it is.

409
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,120
That's it.

410
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,680
C'mon, let's go.

411
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,240
Come on.

412
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,360
Don't you know I was leaving town?
Where were you all this while?

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,560
Paramasivam, had a change of heart.
Returned it with interest.

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,720
Count it. I didn't count.

415
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
How the hell did you managed
to take this from him?

416
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,800
You nailed it!

417
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,840
Don't worry, we'll talk to her

418
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
Chandra...Chandra!

419
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,560
Don't you call me by my name.
I'll whack you right on the street

420
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,160
My dear mother,
we came down to get an opinion from you

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Please don't curse us

422
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,200
- Something's fishy, sister
- Velumani, auntie

423
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,720
Read my hand and let me know if
I'll be a successful businessman?

424
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,680
It reads, that you're a hooligan

425
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,840
You're absolutely right

426
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,920
He's a hooligan

427
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,040
Our idea is to change
that course of his fate

428
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,160
Mom,
you just have to say yes to it

429
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,560
What happens when I say, yes?

430
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,840
Instead of hunting for a job

431
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,920
also he'll stop renting
car from Kathir uncle

432
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,600
Then what else?

433
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,040
I'm going to start a business

434
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,440
Business? And that too, you?

435
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,320
- Yes
- That's a good joke

436
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
Ma! Your daughter
is a smart advocate

437
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,160
I'll take care of it.

438
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
Firstly, you pass your exams.

439
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
Oi Chandra, stop right there!

440
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
Better say, YES!

441
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Fine, Yes!

442
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,200
Mom, it's not enough
that you said "Yes"

443
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
help us get some funds
from Rowther Uncle.

444
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,200
- You heard them right?
- We can start our business

445
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,680
They're trying to destroy me now

446
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,640
Get me as a loan,
I'll return it with interest

447
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,880
Chandra sister,
didn't you come down to start a new life?

448
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,760
Why are you stopping them,
when they're about to start something new?

449
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
You're asking me to
trust them on this?

450
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,800
They'll drag me down
like a dead weight.

451
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Uncle!

452
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,600
Uncle! Wake up!

453
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,280
Hey-- how come you
guys are already here?

454
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,680
Uncle, we came down to
discuss something important.

455
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
What's so important?

456
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,240
Did you find a suitable
match for your sister?

457
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,360
Uncle, first listen to
everything what we have to say

458
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Fine, tell me

459
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,840
We're planning to start the
Plantain business at Koyembedu

460
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,280
I thought you were smart kids

461
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,960
but you guys sound
like the dumb ones.

462
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,080
What do you guys even
know about Plantains?

463
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
Agreed, we don't know
anything about Plantains.

464
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,640
How many varieties?
how to check quality?

465
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,160
It's business or
how much it yields?

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,440
We have no idea about it.

467
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,520
But I'm sure this is my business

468
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,920
I'll learn

469
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,760
I may be rusty in the beginning.
But will work my way up.

470
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
- Here, hold this.
- Hold it.

471
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,040
Welcome!

472
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,520
Surprised to see you here.

473
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,440
What's the matter?

474
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,960
Rajendran,
your partner attacked me

475
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,760
and my brother
attacked your partner

476
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,400
We've been living our
lives full of grudges

477
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
I think, it's enough

478
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
My nephew and niece
are here to do business

479
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,640
You're the only successful
businessman in this area

480
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,800
Give us 30,000 plantains a year

481
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,840
you'll make a profit and as
well as they'll make some money.

482
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,720
What do you expect me to say?

483
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,840
That's my partner's son.

484
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
What do I tell him?

485
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,680
Chinnaiya!

486
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,080
Our grudge is with their
father, not with them.

487
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,960
"You're the king of
this deserted forest"

488
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,080
"If you meet the God,
ask him about it"

489
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,680
"I flipped the coin and bent
over to see how it landed"

490
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,080
"I tried to buy him out,
but there's been no response"

491
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,920
"Oh my God, Oh my God,
please talk to me"

492
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,200
"Please point us to a heart
which bears no worries"

493
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,760
"On an unfortunate night,
I got destroyed a bit"

494
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,520
"also cursed myself
asking, Why was I born?"

495
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,000
"but later I saw
a ray of hope"

496
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,840
"Got a clarity and my
heart got fired up"

497
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,600
"When I started looking
for unanswered questions"

498
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,520
"a path which I never
wanted to pursue, opened up"

499
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,520
"Show me the right direction
so that I can go head on"

500
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,080
"Roll the dice and see if
it lands on a hard number"

501
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,000
"You're the king of
this deserted forest"

502
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,640
"It doesn't matter
whom it belongs to"

503
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
"without a perspective,
you can't find answers"

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,840
"Take small steps
to achieve success"

505
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,840
"The end and beginning
are two faces of a song"

506
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,240
Fool, are those 10's and 500's?

507
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,360
Uh? When you can't
why do you bother?

508
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,560
Why are you indulging in it?

509
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,280
Ey-- don't fight you guys!

510
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,960
As if you're a genius?
-Wonder how they got you to study law?

511
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,320
"Come on!
Listen to a fantastic idea"

512
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,960
Come on kids, let's have lunch

513
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,720
This is for your
hard work with farming

514
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,520
and this is the profit
from our business.

515
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,240
Fine, either ways I'm going
to save up for you kids.

516
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,360
Bose, don't waste a lot of water

517
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,800
the lands have gone dry.

518
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,280
Brother Bose...

519
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
There's still time
for the visiting hours

520
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,480
Doesn't matter,
anyways I'm not such a busy person

521
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,560
Hey buddy, how are you?

522
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,680
Chandra!

523
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,200
Chandra!

524
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
I thought you didn't come

525
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,560
For a moment,
my world was in darkness.

526
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,920
I thought God once
again disappointed me,

527
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,720
but you're here now.

528
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
You never used to be so
sweet when we were together.

529
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,440
Now that you're behind bars,
your love is shining on me.

530
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,160
- Hope the kids are doing good?
- They're doing good

531
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,120
and have grown up
to be wise people.

532
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,520
You could've brought them along.

533
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
It's been ages,
since I've seen them.

534
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,160
They don't like to visit their
father in the prison? Am I right?

535
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,960
Fine, forget about that

536
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,440
How are you managing things?

537
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,680
You look younger than
our previous meet.

538
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
How's that even possible?

539
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,800
Look,
half my hair has turned Grey

540
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,160
It's all 'cause of our children

541
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,800
they literally made
my life difficult

542
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
But everything is good now

543
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,080
Our son took me to a Bank
and opened an account for me

544
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,880
He deposited 25,000 rupees

545
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Also asked to quit my job.

546
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,640
I said no to him.
Why should I quit my job?

547
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,760
I was never dependent on them.

548
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,760
Ah...ah...tell me more

549
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
They've started plantain business

550
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,800
they've been working
hard day and night.

551
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,800
Our daughter goes to college during the
day and to the market in the evening

552
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,320
to help out her brother.

553
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,680
The time is running out

554
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
try and tell me
everything you can

555
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,240
that'll be my only solace
until we meet next.

556
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,160
It's time, please come out.
Come on, come out.

Please go. Come on get out.

558
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,960
I said leave, it's time.
Come on, leave.

559
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,120
I told you to get out.
Go, go, go...

560
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,520
Time's up, everyone leave.

561
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,640
Get out!

562
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Keep it moving. Go!

563
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,200
Hey, who the hell are you?
It's time, why are you still here?

564
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I said get out!

- He did say that will come for the ritual

569
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,560

he never picked up the phone

Why didn't you come
for work yesterday?

573
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,200
You take a day off every week
without informing in prior

574
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,040
and I'm here stuck
with less manpower.

Get lost.

Hey, you should've
come for the ritual.

577

Did you buy me a saree?

Looks like there's a
function at their place

593

let's not disturb them.
We'll come back another time.

I wanna meet him and
ask him few questions

Sir, that's fine.
Can you please give me your phone?

Sir, give me your phone.

Who are you?
Are you an Income Tax officer?

- They threaten us for no reason

but we shouldn't get scared.

You're right,
we shouldn't be scared.

it does feels like calling out to you

633
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,040
To put it in one word, "Loss".

60 years ago when Britishers left India, my
Grandad Cyril Thomas bought mills from them

637
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,200
they were huge Cotton mills.
But my father destroyed everything

638
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,040
Club, Drinks and Women

639
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,640
on top of it,
enmity with everyone

640
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,960
Even my father was
a clubbing freak.

641
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,480
Then it was me,
I lost everything.

642
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,880
Dad-- Is this the time?

643
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,200
Time for what?

644
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,000
Having drinks and
that too with a driver

645
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,840
Is it necessary?
-Hey, mind your words

646
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,000
that's Selva,
who saved you from drowning

647
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
He's well educated

648
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
Selva, please enjoy your drink

649
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,360
I'll go downstairs and
check up on the officers

650
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,040
Hello, I think it's
better you leave now

651
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
I don't want to see you
anymore in my lifetime.

652
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,800
Is that so?
Your love failure, squabble

653
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,080
then you pushed
him into the water

654
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
Everything is still
fresh in my mind.

655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,960
But whenever I see you father,
it's right at the tip of my tongue

656
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,720
Not surprised. For a moment I
thought you were a good person

657
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,280
I don't believe in good or bad

658
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
I believe in just one thing

659
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,680
What is that?

660
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,240
Selva!

661

"Come on! Just listen to your
heart, nothing else"

662
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,120
"Why?!
Violence has no bounds..."

663
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,640
Uncle, the load from
Andhra is going to Mumbai

664
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,840
If we turn that around to Chennai

665
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,200
You'll be the King,
he'll be the Prince and I'm the Princess

666
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm a King?
Sounds really good though

667
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,200
"Dreams do kill you,
but you can't escape its streak"

668
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,920
"There's no one here
to judge your actions"

669
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,240
...make sure everything is in order.
- Sir!

670
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,160
Sir, we're looking for the
owner of this Plantain farm

671
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,600
Why do you want to meet him?

672
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
Huh, to ask his
daughter in marriage

673
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,400
- His daughter?
- Yes, to marry her

674
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,240
- Who's the groom?
- Of course, it's me

675
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,880
I never got married,
looking at this farm I wish to get married

676
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,440
Uncle, if you're done with your
wits, can we get this done sooner?

677
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Son, don't be scared.
I'm here right, don't worry.

678
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,600
Follow me!

679
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,960
His attitude is not right.
Did I mess it up?

680
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,680
Shall we quickly
scoot from here?

681
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,720
They can't find us.

682
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,840
You wanted to get married right?
Shut up and come.

683
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,360
Selva, they're coming with a gun

684
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,600
Now tell me, who's the groom?

685
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,760
Here, that's him.
Six feet tall, my son

686
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,880
he's a good person,
please consider.

687
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Uncle?

688
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,320
Sir, we're from Chennai.

business at Koyembedu.

690
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,920
It's a small one though,
but makes more profit than here.

691
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,000
If you send us 150 trucks loaded
with plantains, this season

692
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,440
we can fetch you good profits

693
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,120
First, we'll take 5% commission

694
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,960
send 20 trucks loaded

695
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,360
if you find it viable,
then raise our commission to 10%

696
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,840
I'll take care of Transport,
Toll gate and Police commission

697
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,400
Oh...

698
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,600
So, you came down from
Madras to talk business?

699
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,800
Fine, come in.

700
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,800
Uncle, let's go.

701
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,720
- Shall I serve you more?
- Please serve the guests

702
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,720
Please server them rice

703
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,600
- Please eat
- Have more dear...

704
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,400
If you add them both and
eat, it'll be delicious

705
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,000
Velusamy,
eat your hearts' content

706
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
I'll serve you too

707
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,040
I'm enjoying the feast

708
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
Come on take more,
don't feel shy son

709
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,800
Oh no, that's enough!

710
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,200
I was about your age,
when I started my business

711
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,320
I just had 5000 rupees
and my brothers with me

712
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,080
This year I'm planning to get 500
acres of land and raise plantains

713
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,000
My grandfather had 300 acres

714
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,960
My father and I
sold it all in vain

715
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,240
Kalyan come on, take a seat.

716
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,760
That's my son, Kalyan Reddy.

717
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,320
He's an Engineer.
Going to do his masters at Madras.

718
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,040
Oh!

719
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,520
I never expected that
Mr.Reddy will help us out

720
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,680
With blind faith,
you came down to Andhra

721
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,920
and requested to do business with
me, that confidence

722
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,400
and your courage

723
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,200
I liked it a lot.

724
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,400
Never let that go.

725
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,760
Oi!

726
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,200
So, you're stealing a smoke?

727
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,560
Scared of your parents?

728
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,200
They know,
but they pretend not to...

729
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,600
I don't want to spoil that

730
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,760
Stealing a smoke
is a fun of its own

731
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,840
This is nothing,
I've smoked during my childhood

732
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,718
- Oh Brother - Oh Dad!
- We don't own a shop at Koyembedu

733
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,580
But we earn good commission
-Sounds good

734
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,360
First get a shop,
later we'll take care of the rest

735
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:33,502
The reason being, a shop at
Koyembedu will take you to heights.

736
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,377
You're right, but it's not
easy to get one at Koyembedu.

737
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,400
Kalyan?!

738
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,600
- Kalyan, where are you?
- Now, it's my mother

739
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,800
- Ma! I'm out here
- Hey, don't call her

740
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,280
It's not right if
she sees us together

741
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,840
- Where are you?
- I'm right here

742
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,720
I can hear you,
but can't find you

743
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,840
- Shut up!
- where are you?

744
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm gonna whack you.

745
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,720
- Did you get scared, ma?
- I got scared dammit

746
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,920
Where did you go
after the dinner?

747
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,000
We'll distribute Andhra's stock
all over Chennai - Mangai!

748
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,480
- Haan..Garu?
- One moment

749
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,360
I found out something last night

750
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,680
Oh...

751
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,680
I don't like when people cheat

752
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Garu...

753
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,560
Your brother told me everything

754
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,600
- What did he say?
- Yes, regarding your father

755
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
He told me everything

756
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh!

757
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,400
- What happened and where he is
- Oh...

758
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,160
I spoke to my brothers about it

759
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,240
They were little hesitant--

760
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,440
--in how to go ahead
doing business with them?

761
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,320
Garu, at times your mind will stop
you, but your heart will long for it.

762
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,520
What will be your take, Mangai?

763
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,480
I would like to
listen to the mind

764
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,920
but I will be a winner,
only if I listen to my heart.

765
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,000
Koyembedu is the
hub of everything

766
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,440
Selva, Mangai is a
very intelligent girl.

767
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,040
She should've born
as my daughter

768
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,080
Let me know once you
get a shop at Koyembedu

769
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,600
the first load will
be from Andhra.

770
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,000
Thanks Garu!

771
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,480
Do you know how hard is it
to get a shop at Koyembedu?

772
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,440
As if you're a
successful cinema heroine

773
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,280
'cause your one smile will make the
CMDA officer melt and sign the papers.

774
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,840
I've inquired,
heard he's an honest officer

775
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,120
but please don't break his nose.

776
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,360
Hey-- stop ranting nonsense.

777
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,360
Just pray to a God or Satan
so that we'll get the shop.

778
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,080
Go!

779
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,640
"On an unfortunate night,
I got destroyed a bit"

780
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,360
"also cursed myself
asking, Why was I born?"

781
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,200
- Ey, come with me
- I'm not coming

782
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,800
Come on, dammit
-I won't come, you carry on

783
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,640
Get lost!

784
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,360
- Excuse me, Sir.
- Please come in

785
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,200
So, it's you who has come
from the Audit Bureau?

786
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,200
Sir, only if I lie
they're letting me inside.

787
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,840
I don't know how to explain

788
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,880
Everyone warned me
before I got here

789
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,040
and asked me not to pose as
Audit Bureau to meet you.

790
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,080
but this is pertaining
to our future and lives.

791
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,800
Sir, our future entirely
lies in your hands.

792
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,920
Please consider.

793
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,600
"I'm the king of
this deserted forest"

794
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,080
"It doesn't matter
whom it belongs to"

795
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,440
"without a perspective,
you can't find answers"

796
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,240
"Take small steps
to achieve success"

797
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,320
What happened?

798
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,480
Idea Flopped?!

799
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,520
I told you right.

800
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,680
Get lost, don't irritate.

801
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,240
"restart from where
you have begun"

802
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,160
"restart from where
you have begun"

803
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,680
"Come on!"

804
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,480
Hello!

805
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,040
I'll finish talking
before you get angry

806
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,840
We're from around Theni.
Our father is in prison for a murder

807
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,600
our mother was the sole
bread winner and raised us

808
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,040
Brother is running
a Plantain business

809
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,760
as we don't have a shop,
it's hard for us to grow in the business

810
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,040
So, we've registered the shop
allotted to us by the Govt.

811
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,000
Our application number is 140

812
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,800
It's highly impossible for us to
compete with the rest of 139 candidates

813
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
Sir, the others are affluent

814
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,360
I know there are applications
recommended by Politicians

815
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,600
We can't afford such
recommendations.

816
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,960
That's why we came
looking for you.

817
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,440
If you consider and get
that shop sanctioned for us

818
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
we'll manage to survive
the competition.

819
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,360
Sir, please sir.

820
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,480
Please don't take me wrong

821
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,640
A small gesture from us.
Thank you, Sir.

822
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,760
Yay!

823
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,600
We have a shop in
Koyembedu, it's confirm.

824
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,280
Can you hire an Ola auto

825
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,703
Why? - I have to go
to the Police Station

826
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,720
Why are you going there?

827
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
I have to file a complaint.

828
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,680
Oh! Is it regarding the bribe
I offered to the CMDA officer?

829
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,800
During my childhood,
I used to hang out with a girl.

830
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,680
She hold hands and will be coy

831
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,200
she has even kissed me

832
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,920
- What else?
- She has even proposed to me once

833
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,600
As I grew up,
she seems to be missing

834
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,720
I'm gonna ask them
to find her for me.

835
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,840
Hey Ram! That was a very good joke.
Can we go now?

836
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,360
- Mangai?
- What is it?

837
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,720
Nothing!

838
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,440
If Selva comes to
know, he'll be pissed.

839
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,520
Hey, hey, hey...

840
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,320
Hey!

841
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960
Mother, I passed!

842
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,600
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Yay, I passed

843
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,560
Put me down. Have you gone mad?

844
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,600
The shop has been
sanctioned in Koyembedu

845
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,240
Miss Future Supreme Court Judge

846
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
she challenged me,
it won't work out until we bribe them

847
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,920
Take a look, madam

848
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,040
Without any bribe nor
any recommendation

849
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,040
I'm happy,
if everything is going good.

850
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,040
Mom, we'll be soon successful

851
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,120
The shop is confirmed right?
Hope it's not wait listed

852
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,720
I'm getting my hands
on it next month.

853
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,520
Listen,
I called you so many times

854
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,920
it was not reachable,
where were you lurking?

855
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,920
Is it? Did you call?

856
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,200
- Hey, where's the phone I got you?
- I have it

857
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,880
Did you lose or break it?

858
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,520
Ma! Look how irresponsible
your daughter is

859
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,880
I gave it to my boyfriend

860
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,960
- What?!
- He's really handsome

861
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,680
Are you talking about
the chicken, Ram?

862
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,800
Your rotten arrogance is...

863
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,880
Hey, don't you dare
lay your hands on me

864
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,040
Look, in business we're partners

865
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,840
in other matters,
we're on our own.

866
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,160
- Understood?
- Hey...!

867
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,360
- Get lost!
- Stop damn it, Hey...

868
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,760
Annachi, Annachi...There are more
stems inside, please take them. - Ok

869
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,120
Here, count them all

870
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,280
You'll park the vehicle
and sleep in a corner

871
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,360
if you come late, how the hell
do you expect us to do business?

872
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,400
You can leave with your truck.

873
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,240
Sir, I've been carrying the
load through a long route

874
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,640
Hey, where are you from?
Huh? Where are you from?

875
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,720
Brother, Brother...

876
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,760
- I don't wanna see your face
- Brother, don't mind him

877
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,400
Hey, go. I said go from here.

878
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,240
- Where's my father?
- What?

879
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,160
I've searched everywhere,
he's missing since yesterday

880
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,280
- He was speaking to you...
- Brother, your load didn't arrive today

881
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,400
But I have the green ones, they're good.
I have 20 stems of it

882
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,240
Hey Bala,
get those stems to him.

883
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,200
He was drinking with you yesterday.
What did he say to you?

884
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,560
Where did he go?
Or did he mention when he will return?

885
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,600
He swore at all the
living beings in the city

886
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,400
He kept repeating that he'll
teach everyone a lesson

887
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,640
- How much is here?
- There's 40,000

888
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,320
Don't worry, he'll return once
the problems are resolved.

889
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,280
- Take this
- I'll pay them, Brother

890
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,000
Brother,
shall we check the stock?

891
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,120
Sure, let's go.

892
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,840
Mr.Victor, you can go to hell.

893
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,320
I'm not hiding my
father in the kitchen

894
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,880
I have no idea where he is...

895
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,080
- Is she upstairs?
- Ya!

896
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,480
- Is she on phone?
- I said I don't know

897
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,760
What can I do if you were foolish
enough to give my father a loan?

898
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,160
Huh?

899
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,080
If you wanna take me to the
court, be my guest.

900
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,680
You can't scare me with threats.

901
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,200
Ok, goodnight.

902
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,560
Goodnight.
Hang up the phone dammit.

903
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,960
Dad, I'm going to kill you.

904
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,840
I swear, I'm going to kill you.

905
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,920
Can you hear me?

906
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,360
How long have you been
enjoying my misery?

907
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,440
I arrived when you were
screaming over the phone

908
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,960
If you come over,
I need to know you're here

909
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,480
How dare you sneak in,
when a girl is alone in a room?

910
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,680
Why? Did I disturb
your screaming session?

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,760
Hey what are you drinking?
Whiskey or Brandy?

912
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,880
Oh, it's wine.

913
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,960
Obviously you're not a saint

914
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,360
not saint enough unlike you

915
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,680
You're determined to
kill your own father.

916
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,240
Flight passenger list,
Train passenger list

917
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,440
Hotels, Hospitals

918
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,200
nothing though,
what If he met with an accident?

919
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,280
I've checked everywhere.

920
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,200
Final option is social media, so I came
down to check with you If I can proceed?

921
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,440
Do you think something
bad would've happened?

922
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,680
Nope. He's in hiding leaving
you in-charge of things

923
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,560
Are you calling him a fraud?

924
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,720
Are you saying he defrauded
everyone and ran away?

925
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,360
If rich people decide
to commit fraud,

926
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,120
they'll do it on a
very large scale.

927
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,160
You-- You're a banana vendor

928
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,320
who screams out loud
to make his sale.

929
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,400
What do you know
about rich people?

930
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,120
I think youâ€™re too drunk.

931
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,960
This is the only thing my
dad has left behind for me

932
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,720
Have you ever had
alcohol before?

933
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,160
Sir, I can take care of myself

934
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,680
Thanks for your
concern, you can leave.

935
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,320
Go!

936
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,800
Bank, Taxes etc...

937
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,480
...will you take care of everything?
- Yes, everything.

938
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,680
Everything.

939
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,520
Bloody Rascals!

940
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,920
None of them look into
my eyes while talking

941
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,600
this is where they look.

942
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,960
Perverts!

943
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,480
Why are men like this?

944
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,080
What is their problem?

945
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,840
What is your problem?

946
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,680
Hey, hey...

947
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,480
- Hey!
- Let go...

948
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,800
I asked you to get out

949
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,920
Go!

950
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,480
Fine, I'll leave once
I empty this bottle.

951
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,640
- Reddy Garu, come on
- Velusamy

952
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,720
Look we finally got
a shop at Koyembedu

953
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,760
Madam, everything is done.
Please take this file.

954
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,600
That's awesome.

955
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,520
Hey, Kalyan come over here.

956
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,520
Are you going to stay
here the entire day?

957
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,200
Or shall we hang
out in the city?

958
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,680
I have to pay fees and
registration has to be done.

959
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,080
Sir, everything is done.

960
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,640
Madam said that Mahesh
Babu is your relative

961
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,520
I am Mahesh Babu's fan.

962
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,600
"Asteroids and Neptune
shining over the rainbow"

963
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,360
"the golden streak and the entire
milky way is within your palms"

964
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,280
"The mighty sun will surge
through your stellar appearance"

965
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,600
"the sweet scent of first rain,
takes a solace in Mangai's heart"

966
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,000
"Hey...!"

967
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:41,720
"Holding hands when we march ahead,
the world will pave way for us"

968
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,360
"even highest tide will
recede at our sight"

969
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,520
"The blooming paths
laid in front us"

970
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,400
"there's no one to tie
us down with force"

971
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,920
"So put aside any
worries you've got"

972
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,440
"Easy come, easy go.
Take whatever you want"

973
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,640
"Easy come, easy go.
Sustain, if you like it"

974
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,560
"Easy come, easy go.
Take whatever you want"

975
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,520
"Easy come, easy go.
Sing your heart's desire"

976
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,160
Correct, that's 500

977
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,240
- Does this have 500?
- Ya, it's there, sister.

978
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,680
Fine, then it's in order.

979
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,880
So, then what's in this?

980
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,720
- Check if this has got, 350?
- Ma!

981
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,840
- Ma?!
- Hmmm...

982
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,840
Please call her

983
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,760
- Sister, someone's here to meet you
- Who?

984
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,400
What happened?
Is something wrong?

985
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,400
Did you provoke Selva
and get him into a fight?

986
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,800
This is from
Kabaleeshwaran Temple

987
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,480
If you drop in,
like this unannounced at my work place

988
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,200
what am I supposed to think?

989
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,040
Bose is getting
released this month.

990
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,160
I thought...

991
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,880
...I thought there's
6 months to go

992
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,520
He's getting released earlier
'cause of his good behaviour.

993
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,240
"'O' dear you're
the love of my life"

994
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,080
It's 'cause of me,
he's in the prison.

995
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,800
I'll bring him back myself.

996
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,280
"...you're my better half"

997
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,163
"Love, I've been
waiting for your return"

998
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:31,640
"Don't mind anymore"

999
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,600
"take me along ashore"
- Be careful, when you tell Mother-in-law

1000
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:38,495
So that she doesn't get a shock

1001
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,320
Fine, I'll bring him home.

1002
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,320
"You're my shoulder
to lean on..."

1003
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:55,760
"Give me some space in your heart
and lap to rest for a while"

1004
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,920
Bose!

1005
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,880
- Finally, I'm free now
- Hey...!

1006
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,120
There's no police nor the
bars in between us now

1007
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,320
hug me tight, brother.

1008
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,680
Hey, Bose.

1009
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,280
It's been ages,
since I hugged you.

1010
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,840
I'm quitting the job.
Please settle my account.

1011
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,480
What?
Did you say you're quitting?

1012
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,680
It's not that simple
to quit your job here

1013
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,560
you gotta find a
replacement for you

1014
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,520
he should be able to understand
how the company works

1015
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,160
only then,
you can quit your job.

1016
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,000
Go and load the goods.

1017
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,360
Helped them to learn the job
and now they're acting too smart

1018
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,680
What the hell are you doing?

1019
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,840
I've been working
hard day and night

1020
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,600
I have another job to tend to,

1021
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,200
settle my account.

1022
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,120
Hey, let go. Have you gone mad?

1023
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,760
I won't kill you here

1024
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,120
but the minute you
step out of the company

1025
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,960
I will slit your throat.

1026
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,680
Mom, it's getting late.
I'll eat at the shop

1027
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,280
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1028
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,720
I'm a working woman,
still I manage to cook for you guys

1029
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,360
but you always leave
without having food...

1030
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,918
"Darling. Love. Princess"

1031
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,679
"Just the sight of you makes...

1032
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:18,231
Mother, look who has returned
-...my heart burn with desire"

1033
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,200
It's your son

1034
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,200
- My dear son...
- Mother!

1035
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,600
How are you mother?

1036
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,600
My son has returned after ages.

1037
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,640
Thank God I didn't die
before your return.

1038
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,400
I don't mind,
even If I die right away

1039
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,760
Mother, prepare a feast
and feed him well

1040
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,560
and bring back his
health to form.

1041
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,360
You just wait here,
I'll come back

1042
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,600
My wife

1043
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,120
The wife who I always
took good care of

1044
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,320
Not sure...

1045
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,200
...how to talk to you now?

1046
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,920
Should I maintain a distance

1047
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,560
or not sure If I
can even hug you.

1048
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,640
"My dear Queen,
Kali and guardian angel"

1049
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:16,080
"just your glance fills
my heart with warmth"

1050
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,000
Do you recognize them?

1051
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,000
They're your children.

1052
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,560
Look, this is Selva

1053
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,880
and this is Mangai.

1054
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,520
I saw them as kids

1055
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,440
Now they look so grown up.

1056
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,800
Dad has returned

1057
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
Did you take good
care of your mother?

1058
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:45,600
"I swear... I am your slave"

1059
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,080
Stay blessed my son.

1060
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,720
Ok dear, you guys get home safe.

1061
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,800
Uncle, did Dad decide
to stay back in Chennai--

1062
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,000
--or is he planning to return
Chinnamanur along with you?

1063
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,400
I don't get it?

1064
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,320
Uncle, I meant to say he's
familiar with lot of people out there

1065
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,960
Start the car

1066
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,640
It's better you
start the car now

1067
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,200
Uncle!

1068
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,080
Look, I won't think twice

1069
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
will whack you right over here.

1070
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,280
It's not a good idea to
leave Bose with you guys

1071
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,280
you siblings might say
something and chase him away

1072
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,920
Sir, come on,
the bus is about to leave.

1073
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,000
Ey-- I'm not coming.
You can leave.

1074
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,760
Sir,
Sir...one minute he'll come.

1075
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,520
Uncle, if he's gonna live with
us, people will gossip about us

1076
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,200
It'll be the same
at the market too

1077
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,160
it's inconvenient for everyone.

1078
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,800
Don't forget that
he's your father.

1079
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,280
Just 'cause someone attacked me,
he murdered them and went to the Prison.

1080
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,520
Exactly, he's been in the prison

1081
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,360
Don't try to be a smart lawyer, have you
ever done something for your brother?

1082
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,720
But my brother
sacrificed his life

1083
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,720
Now he has returned
to his family

1084
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,640
it's your responsibility
to take care of him.

1085
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm warning you guys...

1086
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,080
Hey, start the vehicle.

1087
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,800
[Classic Tamil Movie Song on Tape Recorder]

1088
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,880
I bought this tape recorder
when we got married

1089
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,200
It's still working fine.

1090
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,880
It's you who used to listen
to it the entire night

1091
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,920
As if you never listened to it.

1092
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,120
Moreover you used to
sing along with Susila.

1093
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,680
She has sung a beautiful song.

1094
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,800
Where are you off to?

1095
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,720
I can't be sitting
ducks at home.

1096
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,320
Don't take me for an old man.

1097
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,000
Only if I get out,
I'll get used to the place.

1098
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,120
What's this?

1099
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,280
It wasn't me.

1100
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,320
Hey Mangai! Come on.

1101
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,720
- It's getting late...
- Who left money in my pocket?

1102
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,920
No one can leave,
until you've answered my question.

1103
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,680
Fine, I won't go to the college

1104
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,920
and you don't go to the market

1105
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,080
So, shall we sit down
and gossip instead?

1106
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,680
Hey-- are you asking me to discuss
about the stories from the prison?

1107
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,800
Look, I noticed something
since I've arrived

1108
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,160
you guys have been looking
at me like a stranger

1109
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,120
you kids don't speak to
my face and now this.

1110
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,200
Do I look like a charity to you?
'Cause I returned from prison

1111
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,480
Don't do this outside,
people might mistake us

1112
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,880
Let's go inside
-Ey-- don't make me slap you

1113
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,160
What's with this violence?

1114
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,320
The woman you're disrespecting now,
do you know the hardship she went through?

1115
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,920
You went away to the Prison

1116
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,240
right from feeding us
until our education...

1117
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,160
Hey, hey...hold your horses

1118
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,760
How dare you raise your voice?

1119
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,120
Don't show off
your arrogance here

1120
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,800
You're concerned about
my hardship right?

1121
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,680
Have you ever contributed
to make it better?

1122
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,520
Aren't you the same
person who threatened to

1123
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,440
burn himself if I didn't
give you 50 rupees?

1124
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,720
You don't have
the right to talk.

1125
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,960
Where's that brat?

1126
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,680
- Let it go
- Hold on

1127
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,720
Do you know what she did?

1128
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,320
Once I was sick worried
looking for her the entire day

1129
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,760
but she bunked school and was
watching movie in a theater

1130
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,960
I should've ended
her life on that day

1131
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,640
You guys don't deserve to talk.

1132
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,440
What makes you speak
with such arrogance?

1133
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,400
If you dare speak to
us like this once again

1134
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,400
Come on dear, let's go inside.
Come on.

1135
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,040
Don't you know, if you load 'em
this way it'll spoil the fruit?

1136
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,920
Separate the Poovai
and Rasthali Bananas

1137
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,880
Hey, unload them.
You heard the man.

1138
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,960
What is he doing over here?

1139
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,720
I offered tea and asked him
to sit inside the office

1140
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,280
Children have been
working hard day and night

1141
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,200
How can I sit idle?

1142
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,600
It's not advisable to
be late for business

1143
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,120
If you want to succeed

1144
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,760
then make it a point to
be on time in the morning.

1145
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,080
- Hmmm, load 'em up
- Can I get 36 of Rasthali?

1146
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,360
Here, take this, come on.

1147
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,720
This is an old
pillar, quite broken

1148
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,520
no one stays over here anymore

1149
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,000
Everyone prefers the Hotel

1150
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,000
The owner wanted to demolish
this and build an hotel

1151
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
This is the canteen.

1152
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,160
You'll get idlis
for 20 bucks here.

1153
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,560
Your room is upstairs

1154
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,520
Here you go.

1155
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,480
Hey give me the ball

1156
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,520
Uncle

1157
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,080
are you Selva's father?

1158
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,480
- Yes dear...
- I'm here to meet, Selva

1159
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,960
- Selva!
- He's on the terrace

1160
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,240
Thank you. 
Thank you, uncle.

1161
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,040
Who is this girl?

1162
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,960
How would I know?
Ask your son that question.

1163
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,800
It doesn't feel right.

1164
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,200
- Selva!
- What is it?

1165
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,120
I'm checking accounts,
there's a deficit of 12,000 rupees

1166
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,080
- Is it so?
- Stop kidding with me

1167
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,680
How much did you spend
on booze last month?

1168
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,960
I'm gonna kill you.

1169
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,400
If I question you're getting angry
but the accounts doesn't tally

1170
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,920
If you add the truck
rentals, it should tally

1171
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,120
Hello?

1172
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,800
Who are you? - I need to talk to
Selva, it's an emergency.

1173
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,640
- I am Preetha
- Oh!

1174
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,480
Selva! Preetha is here.

1175
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,480
It's an emergency,
she wants to speak to you.

1176
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,000
In private

1177
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,360
She wants to speak in private

1178
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,080
Ask her to wait for 5 minutes.

1179
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,160
You can discuss with
me, not an issue.

1180
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,360
I'm in need of a favor

1181
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,440
What kind of favor?

1182
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,840
I need to arrange for funds

1183
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,840
as a Bank Guarantee.

1184
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,651
Selva, she expects you
to arrange some cash

1185
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,073
as a Bank Guarantee.

1186
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,245
Really? That too from
a Plantain businessman?

1187
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:45,549
I don't have any friends or
businessman I can trust at the moment

1188
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,160
that's why I need him...
- How much?

1189
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:48,307
It's not much

1190
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:49,329
Not much as in?

1191
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,440
Ah...Two?

1192
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,280
Two thousand?

1193
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,800
2 Lacs?

1194
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,600
- Two crores
-Two crores?

1195
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,880
TWO CRORES?!

1196
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,698
Two crores?

1197
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,720
Two crores?

1198
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,245
- What's happening out here?
- Now that you're here...

1199
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,000
You take care of things now,
I can't handle it anymore.

1200
01:09:08,088 --> 01:09:10,408
I'm not expecting as cash,
just as a bank guarantee.

1201
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,960
Two Crores is it?

1202
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,440
Yes.

1203
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:23,159
If I don't get it,
everything will be auctioned.

1204
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,880
To get the Bank manager to agree on 2
Crores, I literally had to flirt with him

1205
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,240
You're a fast growing
businessman at the moment

1206
01:09:32,886 --> 01:09:36,455
Whenever you rich people want something,
that is when you will flash your smiles.

1207
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,840
I'm in a situation where
nothing will offend me

1208
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,680
Can you help me?

1209
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,240
I'll think about it.

1210
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,840
Two crores, it seems

1211
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,040
It's better we remain
as middle class people.

1212
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,120
Sir!

1213
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,800
Sir!

1214
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,040
Umm...you look like Mangai.

1215
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:11,949
- What?
- I meant, Mangai resembles you

1216
01:10:12,027 --> 01:10:13,160
She's too straight forward

1217
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,880
But she never speaks to my face

1218
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,920
Ah...Sir?

1219
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,600
We need to take right
for the printing press.

1220
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,840
We're related,
so call me, uncle.

1221
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,520
- Is this the place?
- Yes

1222
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,200
You're young and must be
busy, so you can leave.

1223
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,640
- Sir?
- Thank you for your service

1224
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,400
I too have some work to finish

1225
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,720
- Vanakkam
- Vanakkam...

1226
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,160
I'm Bose Kalai,
Chandra's husband.

1227
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,160
Is that so? Nice to meet you.

1228
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,280
Sister, looks like your
husband has come here!

1229
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,200
- Where is he?
- Out there...

1230
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,800
"Don't you talk dear "

1231
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,720
"words will be wasted "

1232
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,640
"donâ€™t run... "

1233
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,440
"...my sweetheart "

1234
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,200
"It ain't enough... "

1235
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,480
"...to celebrate my Tamil "

1236
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,880
"Please don't leave... "

1237
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,800
"...you don't have an option "

1238
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,520
"I'm drenched with nectar of life "

1239
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,840
"doesn't recede when
it stops to rain "

1240
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:39,480
"your pretty lips
are irked with anger "

1241
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:46,000
"Will the droplet landing on the
tip of the leaf reach the root? "

1242
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,280
"Won't I get lucky to
fall head over heels "

1243
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,600
"Every day in and out "

1244
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,880
"Every day in and out "

1245
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,840
"Every day in and out "

1246
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,680
Acho...I'm doomed

1247
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,040
The villain has spotted me

1248
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,720
I'll call back later. You carry on

1249
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,760
- Oh Damn, it's Selva
- I'm a dead meat

1250
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,680
Hi!

1251
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,600
Sister take a look at this.

1252
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,840
Pick a striking red saree
for our 60th wedding ceremony

1253
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,560
New bike...saree...

1254
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,160
...how did you
manage to buy them?

1255
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,040
Hey, this is my hard
earned money from Prison.

1256
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,400
Pick the red one.
Do you like it?

1257
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,280
"Will the droplet landing on the
tip of the leaf reach the root? "

1258
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,240
- Hey!
- Ah...!

1259
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,640
Hey, hey, hey...stop right there.
Hey!

1260
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,600
Hey!

1261
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,920
What's your business
with Reddy's son?

1262
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,480
What's your business
with Preetha George?

1263
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,520
Did I ever question you?

1264
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,200
Get lost!

1265
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,800
Then what do you make of Ram,
who always hangs out with you?

1266
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,160
First let him propose...

1267
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,920
...then I'll think about it.
- Damn you woman!

1268
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,480
We're heading home

1269
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,880
come home for lunch

1270
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,320
We're going out,
you guys have lunch at a hotel

1271
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,080
What was that?

1272
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,600
"Don't you speak dear... "

1273
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,320
Hey!

1274
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,640
Move aside.

1275
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,200
Oh no!

1276
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,680
Ey-- stop the bike
- What happened?

1277
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,440
- Ride faster, ride faster
- Oh no...

1278
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,960
If I get hold of
you, you're doomed.

1279
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,440
Get lost you jealous chicken.

1280
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,680
Hey, why aren't you guys
cutting down the crops?

1281
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,440
Only if you get it done by 5pm,
it'll reach Koyembedu on time.

1282
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,280
Thevar, the owner of the farm
asked us not to cut it down

1283
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,440
- Rajendran uh?
- Yes.

1284
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,040
Rajendra, what happened?
Why are you stopping them?

1285
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,040
It won't work out, uncle.
Let's settle the account.

1286
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,960
Settle the accounts?

1287
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,240
Didn't we agree on
30,000 plantain?

1288
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,200
And you're asking to
settle the account

1289
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,080
I heard Bose is
out of the prison

1290
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,200
Agreed that you didn't want
to mix enmity and business

1291
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,480
back then Bose was in
the prison and I agreed.

1292
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,080
Now that he's out of the prison

1293
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,480
this won't work out, uncle.
Let's not proceed.

1294
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,920
Let's settle the account
and part our ways.

1295
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,280
Don't be upset that the load
didn't arrive from your village

1296
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,960
let's take this
as a positive sign

1297
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,120
- It's monsoon and the crops will get spoiled
- Hello, Bose Kalai speaking

1298
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,000
What does he think of himself?

1299
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,360
Look here--

1300
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,360
--doesn't matter,
if they're refusing to send him the stock

1301
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,960
I know how to get
the stock for my son.

1302
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,600
Ya, let him know about it.

1303
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,360
That's not how business is done

1304
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,160
Won't send in the
stock it seems.

1305
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,920
Selva, did you happen
to see your father?

1306
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,080
I didn't see him at
the market today.

1307
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,360
He left in the morning,
hasn't returned yet.

1308
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,320
Not sure,
if he knows his way back here.

1309
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:23,440
Selva, did Dad mention
about going anywhere?

1310
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,840
Selva,
first ask where is her jewelery?

1311
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,280
I never saw him today

1312
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,720
She gave him all of her jewelry

1313
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,560
Did he inform anyone
at the market?

1314
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,360
Mom! All your rage
is out only on us

1315
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,400
but in front of your
husband, you're a kitten.

1316
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,320
You gave him all your
jewelry once he asked for it

1317
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,440
he must've sold them

1318
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,040
don't worry, he'll be back
once he runs out of the money.

1319
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,000
I'll break your bones

1320
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,800
don't you dare accuse my son.
What do you really know about my son?

1321
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,080
Mom! Where are you going?
Stop right there.

1322
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,960
Ey-- it's my husband
who's been missing

1323
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,520
My children are not going to
bother, looking for him

1324
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,840
I'll go to the Police
station and see what I can do

1325
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,040
- Let go off my hand
- Mom, you're overreacting

1326
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,360
- Let go off my hand
- Mom!

1327
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,040
You stay back,
I'll look for him.

1328
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,080
Where were you since yesterday?

1329
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,560
We were looking
for you everywhere.

1330
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,680
Mom and granny are
relentless without sleep.

1331
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,960
I'm here now, right?

1332
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,720
Show your brother the
stock I brought in

1333
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,560
Mom-- he's back.

1334
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,680
He's right here.

1335
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,880
Mom wants to talk to you.

1336
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,040
Hello, where will I go?

1337
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,320
Don't start screaming now

1338
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,280
Brother said load won't be coming
in, so I went to Bangalore

1339
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,680
I'll explain when I meet
you, hang up now.

1340
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,080
Ya. Take this.

1341
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,440
Go and take a look.

1342
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,600
You can't recognize
the fruit right?

1343
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,000
Look closer,
it's the same plantain

1344
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,680
Nothing much,
they cut them down in batches

1345
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,560
and have been ripened inside
a air conditioned room.

1346
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,400
My boys took me to Bangalore.

1347
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,800
It's called Golden
Fruits it seems.

1348
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,320
They're turning the plantains
into ripe fruit and making money

1349
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,960
We'll be the first in
this city to do so.

1350
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,880
Please don't take me wrong

1351
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,880
he got fruits which will
get spoiled in a day

1352
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,600
and that too loads of it.
What do we do about it?

1353
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,840
We're not running a
street retail business

1354
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,040
we're wholesale
retailers in the market.

1355
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,640
If someone looks at
it, they'll mock us.

1356
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,160
How do we explain this
fruit and sell them?

1357
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,120
Mom's jewelry is
going to rot forever

1358
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,480
Giveaway the fruits to our
customers in the market

1359
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,040
Tell them it's a gift

1360
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,360
Let's not leave them to rot.

1361
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,800
If I knew you'd be coming over,
would've prepared meat for you people

1362
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,160
In jail, the three of us used
to eat together all the time.

1363
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,040
In these 10 years, whenever brother
comes to know there isn't enough food

1364
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,480
he used to share his
food with all of us.

1365
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,680
Brother, come on feed him.

1366
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,840
Guys don't embarrass me

1367
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,200
Are you feeling awkward
'cause sister is here?

1368
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,560
- You don't have to be...
- Change up and join us for dinner

1369
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,600
Were you able to
sell all the fruits?

1370
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,000
How much did you make of it?

1371
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,520
Hey, hey, hey...Selva stop.

1372
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,320
I have to dump them
all in the sewer

1373
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,320
Did I ever ask him for his help?

1374
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,880
Over enthused!

1375
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,200
I gave away the
entire load for free

1376
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,120
He should either stay at home or
should've returned to the Village.

1377
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,840
Shouldn't be messing
up our lives like this.

1378
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,200
How dare you?
How dare you speak to him like that?

1379
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,120
Ey-- instead of
talking to your mother

1380
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,960
Be a man and talk to my face

1381
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,680
I don't have any issues
talking to your face.

1382
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:04,960
Now listen--

1383
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,920
--you can stay if you won't
interfere with my business

1384
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,960
If not, are you asking me
to get out of the house?

1385
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:09,600
Listen...

1386
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,880
C'mon tell me, are you asking
me to get out of the house?

1387
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,280
I'm asking you not to
interfere with my business

1388
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,480
Ey-- save your tactics
for the business

1389
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,760
don't try and use them on me.

1390
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,520
If you're going to be
interfering with our lives,

1391
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,040
we don't need you.
It's better you return to the Village

1392
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,600
Ey-- what's wrong with you?

1393
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,040
- Chandra!
- How dare you say that?

1394
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,840
Hold on!

1395
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,480
He's been ranting nonsense

1396
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,960
and you've been leading him on

1397
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,640
I asked you to stay
calm, dammit!

1398
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,640
Brother!

1399
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,320
Are you a fool?

1400
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,120
I clearly explained it to you

1401
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,920
Bose, please don't do it.
Please don't

1402
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,840
Bose, listen to your mother

1403
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,480
- Bose!
- Dear, what's wrong with you now?

1404
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,040
He's being childish and
you're taking it seriously

1405
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,000
I thought of taking
you along with me

1406
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,200
We have a daughter,
so please take care of her.

1407
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,520
Please listen...

1408
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:06,160
Bose, where are you going?
Take me with you.

1409
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,680
Dear...

1410
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:14,400
"no matter what anyone
says, youâ€™re my better half"

1411
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:14,880
Dear!

1412
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,480
"Love, I've been
waiting for your return"

1413
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:24,360
"Don't mind anymore,
take me along ashore"

1414
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:34,720
"You're my shoulder to lean
on, when I'm lonely"

1415
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,680
"Give me some space in your heart
and lap to rest for a while"

1416
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,880
Are you leaving 'cause you were
hurt from the fight last night?

1417
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,560
Don't you like to
live with us anymore?

1418
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,360
Your son is short
tempered just like mine

1419
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,920
But I'm sure, he's a good soul

1420
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,000
I have two sons

1421
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,880
the eldest never got
married and lived his life

1422
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,480
But Bose, in spite of having a
family couldn't live with them

1423
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,040
Anyways, with God's grace--

1424
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,040
--I was expecting everything
will fall into place

1425
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,120
Wonder who cast an
evil eye on our family?

1426
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,200
Once I reach our village, I'm gonna
offer sacrifice for Deity Karuppusamy

1427
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,480
I took an oath when
Bose went to the prison

1428
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,920
may be the Deity is angry
for not keeping my word.

1429
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,160
May be that's why
this is happening.

1430
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,440
Sir, this is my brother.

1431
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,120
He ran away from Tirupur
and is now in Madras

1432
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,880
can you please help me find him?

1433
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,760
Chennai is a hugely
populated city--

1434
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,720
--how do you expect
me to find him?

1435
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,960
It's better you consult an astrologer,
he'll find him for you. Get lost.

1436
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,120
Sir the problem is,
he's a little mentally disturbed.

1437
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,360
Before something bad happens

1438
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,480
it's better we find him.

1439
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,560
Brother, please come over here.

1440
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,200
Mom, Mom, Mom...

1441
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,680
Why are you so
bloody angry with me?

1442
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,040
You won't speak to me
nor will look at me?

1443
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,880
For a moment,
think from my perspective

1444
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,520
Trust is very
important in a business

1445
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,560
If they don't trust me,
I won't have return customers

1446
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,880
That's it,
business will be ruined.

1447
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,920
Mom, the truck load
of stock he got us--

1448
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,920
--was a huge loss,
as we couldn't sell it.

1449
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,480
What is it dear?

1450
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,320
How are you?
And how's business?

1451
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,920
The machines are running,
I'm sailing through

1452
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,960
Any update on the
whereabouts of your father?

1453
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,240
I think he's way
far off overseas

1454
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,000
not able to find him.

1455
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,440
How are you managing things?

1456
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,080
Factory, Business, Loan sharks...

1457
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,040
I'm trying my best
to be strong like you.

1458
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,920
You're my inspiration.

1459
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,040
- Selva...
- Aunty!

1460
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,560
I didn't come to meet Selva.

1461
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,400
I came to meet his father
and I have something for him

1462
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,520
I went to your house,
as no one was there, I came over here.

1463
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,480
I've paid half of the guaranteed
amount, Selva had signed for

1464
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,920
I want to inform the
same to Bose uncle

1465
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,400
I want to tell him that I don't
know how to flirt or cheat his son.

1466
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,480
Him? When did you meet him?

1467
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,120
He's not in Chennai.
He returned to the Village yesterday.

1468
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,480
He had come over to the
Factory this morning

1469
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,320
Today?

1470
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,680
He insulted me in
front my entire staff

1471
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,000
accused me of luring
you to borrow money

1472
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,000
What he said was not
entirely wrong though

1473
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,280
half of it may be true.

1474
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,760
I'll make sure to clear the debt so
that you won't be in any kind of problem

1475
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,160
please inform him the same.

1476
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,600
Selva--

1477
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,240
--I won't disturb you anymore.

1478
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,840
If he didn't return to the Village.
Where is he now?

1479
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,680
Listen, don't be thinking too
much about the issues at home

1480
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,520
try to move on,

1481
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,920
only then,
you'll find a solution.

1482
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,760
Ey-- master of advice

1483
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,400
I was bugged with your ranting,
that's why I agreed to come to the movies

1484
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,240
Go!

1485
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,120
Come on, let's go.

1486
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,600
Oi!

1487
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,040
- Hey...!
- Bunked college is it?

1488
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,160
How can I not,
when Mangai asks me out for a movie?

1489
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,600
Did you hear that Ram?

1490
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,560
This rich dude will
do anything for me.

1491
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,320
Listen, if you sleep off
again during the movie

1492
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,520
I'll definitely kill you.

1493
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,160
You keep blaming me for it

1494
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,760
Why do you bring me
to English Dramas?

1495
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,960
There will be subtitles
Ram, look at them.

1496
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,280
So, do you want me to watch the
movie or read the subtitles?

1497
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,840
- It's a lame logic bro
- Correct!

1498
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,840
Only you can reply to her
nonsensical questions.

1499
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,320
Ey-- get lost and shut up

1500
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,120
Excuse me. Ssshh!

1501
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,800
Excuse me. Ssshh!

1502
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,440
Excuse me. Ssshh!

1503
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,760
Hello?

1504
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,120
Who's that?

1505
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,400
Dad?!

1506
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,880
This is the first time,
you've called me Dad.

1507
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,840
Son, please come.
We need to talk.

1508
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,280
Not to worry, please come.

1509
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,680
You sit down.

1510
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,600
Please come.

1511
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,600
Uncle!

1512
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,960
Son, we have great
respect for your family.

1513
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,600
Please don't spoil it.

1514
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,960
Uncle,
I think you've misunderstood.

1515
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,920
It's not wrong to go out for
movies or ride together on a bike.

1516
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,640
Agreed that you're a good kid.

1517
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,880
That's why you
invited Ram as well.

1518
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,280
But I'm not a fool
to believe everything

1519
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,360
I'm sure where these
things will lead to

1520
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,640
Kalyan, you're not
obligated to speak to him

1521
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,480
Mangai, please be patient.
Let him talk.

1522
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:54,320
Son, what would've your father
said if he was in my situation?

1523
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,800
He would've definitely
said it's wrong.

1524
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,240
Not you,
but would've blamed my daughter

1525
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,680
It's 'cause you own a farm

1526
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,560
you're filthy rich.

1527
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,440
We elders know what's
right for our children

1528
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,640
Please don't rush into things.

1529
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,040
- I beg of you
- Uncle...

1530
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,560
You're calling me uncle, right?
Then listen to what I have to say

1531
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,760
I'm a villager,
and quite egoistic

1532
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,640
I've been in prison for years

1533
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,360
Please don't put
me back in there.

1534
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,280
Uncle, I'm confused if this
is an advice or a threat?

1535
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,520
It's up to you to
make that decision.

1536
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,360
Tell me Annachi

1537
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,480
You're well aware of
the market's situation

1538
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,200
everything is going good.
Please tell me.

1539
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,480
Golden Fruits is it?

1540
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,400
They were from Bangalore

1541
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,640
Keep talking.

1542
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,600
Yes,
I got them as sample to test

1543
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,960
You're right,
Karnataka is filled with them.

1544
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,880
Yes, that's why I had sent my
father to pick up a stock of samples

1545
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,960
Selva!

1546
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,440
Tell me what's the matter?

1547
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,800
Our father will never change,
he's going to destroy us.

1548
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,040
- You just wait and see
- What?!

1549
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,080
200 boxes for
Pazhamudhir Chozai?

1550
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,440
For just one customer, I can't even
afford the transportation charges

1551
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,560
You were right about him

1552
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,560
we were at peace when
he used to be in prison.

1553
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,280
Why don't you speak
to Nilgiris as well?

1554
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,880
I can do it if two
customers places the order

1555
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,080
Selva, what does he
really thinks of himself?

1556
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,320
Sir, even if the profit is
less, there'll be no loss.

1557
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,040
He literally insulted
me in front of everyone.

1558
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,360
As if I committed a crime.

1559
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,480
What did I do wrong?

1560
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,720
Was it him or it was me?

1561
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,880
He committed a crime
and went to the prison

1562
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,600
But he's accusing me of
doing something wrong

1563
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,960
Look, I don't want him
to be controlling me

1564
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,600
- I've said it
- Sure, we can do it

1565
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,240
Today is Friday

1566
01:30:36,298 --> 01:30:37,756
we'll start
delivering from Monday

1567
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:40,365
- Ok, Sir. - I'm talking to
you, but you're not bothered.

1568
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,680
Selva, you just come and
speak to him about it.

1569
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,320
Come and support
me as a brother.

1570
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,400
2400 boxes,
the Bengaluru fruits are in demand

1571
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,920
the boxes of fruits
we thought was useless

1572
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,120
are in demand now.

1573
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,240
Now think,
how to make this a big hit.

1574
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,680
Selva, this is my life

1575
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,000
Put your life on hold

1576
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,240
I'll speak to the
guys at Bengaluru.

1577
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,640
Ey-- don't leave me
hanging with a problem

1578
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,720
Hold on, I'm coming too.

1579
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:08,600
"This that hunnid dolla bill; thatâ€™s
on my mind that's how Iâ€™m feeling"

1580
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,280
"Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m feeling.
Iâ€™m in the building, talking my shot"

1581
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,440
"Walk and I get it.
Imma go get it and pass to my kids"

1582
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,000
"Yeah!"

1583
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:16,360
"Hunnid rims. Hunnid goons.
Hunnid mill."

1584
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,760
"When you're in trouble,
you know what's the deal"

1585
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,560
"It'll be blazing,
shot is a film"

1586
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,000
"Homie, let it rain money"

1587
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,600
"And Iâ€™m breaking the
bank for my Family"

1588
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,520
"the money too Long
not an issue anymore"

1589
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,520
"Hit it!"

1590
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,600
"This that hunnid dolla bill; thatâ€™s
on my mind that's how Iâ€™m feeling"

1591
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,320
"Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m feeling.
Iâ€™m in the building, talking my shot"

1592
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,520
"Walk and I get it.
Imma go get it and pass to my kids"

1593
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:37,120
"Yeah!"

1594
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,400
"Hunnid rims. Hunnid goons.
Hunnid mill."

1595
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,800
"When you're in trouble,
you know what's the deal"

1596
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,480
"It'll be blazing,
shot is a film"

1597
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,120
"Homie, let it rain money"

1598
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,600
"And Iâ€™m breaking the
bank for my Family"

1599
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,640
"the money too Long
not an issue anymore"

1600
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,480
This looks like
Laila-Majnu's love story

1601
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:03,920
You leave from here.

1602
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,280
I was able to bear
it for 20 years,

1603
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,800
but in these two days,
you made me cry a lot.

1604
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,120
Why should you cry?

1605
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,360
What else do you expect?

1606
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,640
Then,
I have to be angry with God.

1607
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,680
You'll do things which
you feel is right,

1608
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,200
and the kids do the same
what they feel like.

1609
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,840
But I'm stuck in
between you guys.

1610
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
You take your bike
and come back home.

1611
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,320
I can't do that,
I have a lot of work to do.

1612
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,920
What job?
As if you're a Collector.

1613
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,000
They asked me to
get out of the house

1614
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,520
I won't return,
until they come looking for me.

1615
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,040
But I'll come over here.

1616
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,000
I'll come and spend
time with you.

1617
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,480
Ey!

1618
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,240
Listen carefully--

1619
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,160
--Mom has been calling
out your name relentlessly

1620
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,080
She doesn't think
of anything else.

1621
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,920
I've come down to take you home.

1622
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,520
There's no time for revenge now

1623
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,560
Let's make do and move
on with our lives.

1624
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,160
If you don't forget about it--

1625
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
--you can never be at
peace in your life.

1626
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Do you understand,
what I'm saying?

1627
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,520
I'll head home and
cook something for him

1628
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,320
Mom-- Mom,
don't leave me alone over here

1629
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,960
Dad!

1630
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,400
Dad!

1631
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,335
Yes, I went to a movie yesterday 
it was average.

1632
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:46,156
Sister

1633
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,780
- Hold on, one minute 
- He's coughing, I think it's hurting him

1634
01:35:47,843 --> 01:35:49,600
Call me later -Doctor had asked
to give an injection at 4pm

1635
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,640
- Please check what's wrong with him
- They'll come and do it

1636
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,960
- When was this?
- Sister, it's time

1637
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,120
It's 4:15 now, please check what's
wrong, please sister.

1638
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,520
Didn't we mention that,
they'll come and do it?

1639
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,720
He's suffering out there,
and you people are so irresponsible.

1640
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,120
Will you move only if he's dead?

1641
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,240
Is someone's going to attend him
or shall I complaint to the Doctor?

1642
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,040
Sorry!

1643
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,120
Hey!

1644
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,560
Come on, start the vehicle.

1645
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,000
Naatraya, hey Naatraya!

1646
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,920
Naatraya! Hey, Naatra...

1647
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,840
She's lying there like an orphan

1648
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,960
are you here to gloat?

1649
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,480
Listen, you're going to
lose your grand children

1650
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,840
My brother has returned
from prison after 16 years

1651
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,400
They don't seem to move on

1652
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,800
Why are you screaming on
top of your voice now?

1653
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,760
Ask your grandson
what he has done

1654
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,600
Ask him to stay in the limit.
Or else he'll be dead.

1655
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,120
What's this?

1656
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,800
To help you move

1657
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,560
Not required, I can walk

1658
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,680
Be careful

1659
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,280
Are you angry with me?

1660
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,280
I'll come straight to the point

1661
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,400
Are you in love
with Reddy's son?

1662
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,200
No!

1663
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,960
Daughters have never been
honest with their fathers

1664
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,440
Hello-- Hello, Selva...

1665
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,960
Hello, I'll call you back

1666
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,520
Hello Selva, they found my Dad.

1667
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,240
Oh, where was he?

1668
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,840
Now he's at home.

1669
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,560
But they brought him as a corpse
and he's lying here lifeless

1670
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,320
What happened?

1671
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,360
Preetha's father is no more.

1672
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,480
"Oh God, the creator and the
redeemer of all your faithful people"

1673
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,880
"Grant to the souls of
our faithful departed

1674
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,840
your mercy light and peace"

1675
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,840
"Lord we pray to those we love

1676
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,360
who have gone
before us in faith."

1677
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,480
"I know you've forgiven their sins,
of the blessings of everlasting lives

1678
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,960
"We're so grateful that,
you have made us all...

1679
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,280
"Thank you for all that love...

1680
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,080
What happened?

1681
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,160
He was staying at a Beach
resort in Pondicherry.

1682
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,240
He was drinking out
there, day and night.

1683
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,680
This morning his body was
found washed away at the shore

1684
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,920
Fishermen found him...

1685
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:44,880
"Unfulfilled desires has
been swept away by the winds"

1686
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,880
"Tell me why?!"

1687
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:57,920
"Why does the horizon
shrink day by day"

1688
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,200
"Tell me why?!"

1689
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,000
Will it work out between us?

1690
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,240
Short tempered,
Fighter cock, Arrogant

1691
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:17,760
"I'm filled with sorrow,
please come to me dear"

1692
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:22,720
"Wonder why there's
a silence between us"

1693
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,000
"Not sure what I've sinned?"

1694
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,560
"Tell me 'O' dear!"

1695
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,360
Bose, why have you been
toiling yourself in this state?

1696
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,960
You should've stayed
back in Madras.

1697
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,640
After our father died,
you're the one who raised me

1698
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,560
You always used to
carry me around.

1699
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,840
You could've been a
little strict with me.

1700
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,080
Also you could've
imparted a little wisdom

1701
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,280
Bose, what are you talking about?
What's wrong?

1702
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,360
I'm not sure

1703
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,600
I've been in the
prison for 16 years

1704
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,320
I was unaware how
times have changed.

1705
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:35,360
From that day at the
Karupusamy Temple till today,

1706
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:41,400
I havenâ€™t been able to hold
them and speak to them.

1707
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,480
I'll stay back with you.

1708
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,440
Let my children be at peace.

1709
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,160
You're children
are just like you

1710
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,120
they'll come looking for you.

1711
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,960
Come on, let's go home.

1712
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,040
It's better that you came over

1713
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,440
that guy couldn't kill
you in an accident

1714
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,280
has brought his cousins down
to Madras in order to kill you

1715
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,040
I was anyways going to call
you, before something happened.

1716
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,200
He's got his cousins to kill me?

1717
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,040
Don't worry, we'll discuss with
head of the village and sort it.

1718
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,560
Where are they in Madras?

1719
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,880
I'll take care of it, Bose.
Don't worry about it.

1720
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,720
What if they don't find me
but instead harm my children?

1721
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,200
Rajendran knows their place

1722
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:30,120
it was him who made
all the arrangements.

1723
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,680
Where's Rajendran at the moment?

1724
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:47,200
Bhaskara,
we've discussed among us

1725
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,160
They'll handle the legal matters.

1726
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,080
We won't stop until we slit
that Bose Kalai's throat

1727
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,200
Don't worry.

1728
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,360
Please come inside.

1729
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,960
- Reddy Garu!
- Selva...

1730
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,560
...just like you came to me
with your business proposal

1731
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,040
I've come here with a proposal.

1732
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,360
I'm here to ask Mangai's
hand in marriage for my son

1733
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,400
Ah-- Aiyoo-- how can I ?

1734
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:32,040
I can't take a decision
without Selva's father.

1735
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:35,160
You please come inside. We'll
discuss the matters inside the house.

1736
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,560
Where are you running off to?

1737
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,240
I'm scooting off to Dubai

1738
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,480
Once I get there I'm going
to start a company like Uber.

1739
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,040
Reddy Garu is here to
ask my hand in marriage

1740
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,080
I've found a potential
partner out there

1741
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,200
he's filthy rich.

1742
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,680
What do I tell him?

1743
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,240
I won't return if I go to Dubai.

1744
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,960
Where are you going?
Stop right there

1745
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,040
So, that's it?

1746
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,320
Mangai, you're meant to fly high

1747
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,560
I'm an ordinary man

1748
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,520
You should marry
someone like Kalyan

1749
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,640
I canâ€™t offer anything to you in
compared to what Kalyan can offer you.

1750
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,640
But I'll find a girl very soon.

1751
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,520
Unfortunately,
I'm not over you yet.

1752
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,000
I'm going to Dubai, for good.

1753
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,360
Fine, go.

1754
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,400
Mangai, I--
Mangai I wanted to...

1755
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,560
...I always wanted
to tell you something

1756
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,200
but never got the
courage to express it

1757
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,440
I was scared you'll laugh it off

1758
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,600
- What?!
- Just hold on...

1759
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,920
Let me just tell you now

1760
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,920
Iâ€™ve been in love with you
since I was a child, Mangai.

1761
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,040
when we used to fight,

1762
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,520
or when we used to play

1763
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,320
or when we rode on
the bike together

1764
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,800
You're truly precious to me.

1765
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,600
Oh, really?

1766
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,800
You may wonder,
why am I blurting this out now?

1767
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:55,520
But at least once,
I wanted to express my feelings

1768
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:59,680
If I don't then this
feeling will eat me alive.

1769
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,240
Mangai!

1770
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,240
If you think I was
wrong, please slap me

1771
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:13,880
"I've thought
about it 'O' dear"

1772
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:18,120
"hold my hands 'O' my love"

1773
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:24,520
"'O' dear I'm
drowning in poetry"

1774
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,920
"...I'm withering"

1775
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,880
"shall I drown into
the river of dews"

1776
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,800
There's no time
left for hugging now

1777
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,360
go and tell my father about Ram.

1778
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,400
Go!

1779
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,720
Go.

1780
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:46,080
Let's go

1781
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,000
Reddy Garu,
Kalyan is a very good friend of mine

1782
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,440
And I'm his good friend too.

1783
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,680
But Dad misunderstood about us.

1784
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,320
I hope you'll
understand the situation.

1785
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:04,320
That's him.

1786
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,000
- Hey, come over here
- Hey...!

1787
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,000
This is Ram.

1788
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:12,040
He's been my everything
since my childhood.

1789
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,160
Neither my mother nor
Selva knows about it.

1790
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,320
But now you've made me say it

1791
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,360
...please forgive me Reddy Garu.

1792
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,600
Mangai,
you should've been my daughter.

1793
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,360
Fine, I'm leaving.

1794
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,480
Hey, please don't dear...

1795
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,360
Selva, hear me out...

1796
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,160
Selva!

1797
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,960
Didn't you make an attempt to kill my
dad by running him over by a truck?

1798
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,760
You're making a mistake, Selva

1799
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,960
That wasn't me

1800
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,520
Selva, that wasn't me.

1801
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,920
- It's a lie
- I'm Naatrayan

1802
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,080
Hey!

1803
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,720
Don't you understand,
what I'm trying to say?

1804
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,520
He's mentally unstable.

1805
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,280
We have to save your father.

1806
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,200
I don't want my brother
going to the prison

1807
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,400
Check where's your
father right now?

1808
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,360
Ask him!

1809
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,280
My cousins have come
down from the village

1810
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,080
they would've caught
your father by now.

1811
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,240
We have to somehow save him.

1812
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,440
Where the hell is your brother?

1813
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,440
Which way is it?

1814
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,960
Keep driving straight

1815
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,160
Naatraya, he's so bloody naive

1816
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,560
I spoke like you
and he believed me.

1817
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:01,400
Now that you're here--

1818
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,240
--even your father
will be here soon.

1819
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,200
Your father will
come for you right?

1820
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:25,880
Don't do it, Bhaskara

1821
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,200
Please listen to me,
forget about everything

1822
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,720
Throw away the
hatred in your heart

1823
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,800
Why should I?

1824
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,040
Tell me?

1825
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:38,000
Do you want me forget how my
father's head rolled on to my feet?

1826
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,360
You've been spoiling
your life obsessed with it

1827
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,200
Hey!

1828
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,520
Ssshh!

1829
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,240
Cousin, he's talking too much

1830
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:52,440
take him far off,
so that I don't hear him speak

1831
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:56,240
- Bhaskar, please don't do it
- Hey, come on get up

1832
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:57,960
Ey-- don't do it Bhaskara
-I said come with me

1833
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,920
Hey, don't do it. Let me go.
-Get inside damn it

1834
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:03,040
Bhaskara don't do it.
Damn it Bhaskar.

1835
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,400
Now tell me, Selva

1836
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,840
how shall I kill your father?

1837
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,680
Shall I beat him to
death, in front of you?

1838
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:16,240
Or shall I just decapitate his
head like my father was killed?

1839
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,320
Selva!

1840
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,840
Your father is here...

1841
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,240
Selva!

1842
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,760
Hey, Selva

1843
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,520
Selva!

1844
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,120
Bose, you're right on time

1845
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:22,960
Selva!

1846
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,400
- Selva!
- You go!

1847
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,240
Hey Selva! -How do you expect
him to leave without you?

1848
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,280
Ey-- let him go.

1849
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,000
He'll always try to save you.

1850
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,000
Selva!

1851
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,280
Selva!

1852
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,480
Don't do it, Selva.

1853
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:39,480
- I asked you to leave
- Selva let him go

1854
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,080
Selva, please let him go

1855
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,640
Hey!

1856
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,560
Dad!

1857
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,040
Can't you hear me?
Dad, please leave from here.

1858
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,800
Hey, you're calling
me Dad, after ages

1859
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,840
As a father, I've never done
anything right for my children

1860
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:00,240
It's all my fault. All my fault.

1861
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:01,160
Dad!

1862
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,160
- Dad!
- Hey...

1863
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,840
Don't do it son, don't...

1864
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,640
- Listen to me, don't do it
- Bose...

1865
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,240
..I've been waiting
for this moment

1866
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,960
Ey...Arghh

1867
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,480
16 years...

1868
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,360
...It's been penance for 16
years, Bose

1869
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,920
Hey!

1870
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,760
Hey, don't destroy yourself
with this rage for revenge

1871
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:56,440
Hey, only after your death,
I can hear humans speak

1872
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,800
Selva! Selva!

1873
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,320
Selva!

1874
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,160
Selva! Selva!
Don't do it, let him go

1875
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,640
let him go,
let this end with me.

1876
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,360
Let him go damn it.

1877
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,040
Don't stop me Dad.
We can live peacefully only if he's dead.

1878
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,160
Listen to your
dad, put that down

1879
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,120
Put that down!

1880
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,120
Put that down, dammit.

1881
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,840
Do you think everything
will end if you kill me?

1882
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:54,080
A minute of my rage,
killed your father.

1883
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,160
Since then I'm burdened
with that guilt.

1884
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,720
Do you want to
burden yourself too?

1885
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,320
Don't even think
about the prison.

1886
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,160
It's hell out there.

1887
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,800
I'm not saying
this to stay alive

1888
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,800
I'm pleading for your sake.

1889
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,720
If you could forgive me for
your father's death, please do.

1890
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,440
If you can't, then kill me.

1891
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:22,680
Kill me!

1892
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,400
Come on, Kill me!

1893
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:24,600
"'O' dear,
my love and my guardian angel"

1894
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:31,000
"no matter what anyone
says, youâ€™re my better half"

1895
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,800
"Love, I've been
waiting for your return"

1896
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:40,880
"Don't mind anymore,
take me along ashore"

1897
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:50,840
"When I'm lonely,
you're my shoulder to lean on"

1898
01:55:51,040 --> 01:56:01,120
"Give me some space in your heart
and lap to rest for a while"

1899
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,640
"Darling. Love. Princess"

1900
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:12,080
"just the sight of you makes
my heart burn with desire"

1901
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,920
"Trust me on this 'O' my dear"

1902
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:21,840
"if your name isn't
mentioned, monsoons go dry"

1903
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:31,800
"Your beauty is nothing less
than a gleam off the full moon"

1904
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:36,920
"Speak to me with
love 'O' dear..."

1905
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:42,160
"My heart fills with music"

1906
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:46,680
"My dear Queen,
Kali and guardian angel"

1907
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:53,680
"just your glance fills
my heart with warmth"

1908
01:56:54,320 --> 01:57:02,800
"A speck of anger in your eyes,
sends shivers down my spine"

1909
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:12,800
"I've no one but
you in my life"

1910
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:23,400
"I swear... I am your slave"

1911
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:31,320
"Princess"

1912
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:33,440
"Princess"

1913
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:38,160
"Princess"

1914
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,720
"'O' my dear"

1915
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,600
"'O' my dear"

1916
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,080
"Princess"

1917
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,520
"Princess"

1918
01:57:54,720 --> 01:58:00,000
"Princess"

1919
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:04,720
"'O' my dear"

1920
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,720
"Darling. Love. Princess"

1921

"Darling. Love. Princess"
