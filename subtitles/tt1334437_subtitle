1
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,226
Shalini, slow down. Slow down.
- Kevin, it's no useto stop me.

2
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,166
Slow down. Slow down.
- Kevin, don't be boring.

3
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,104
Slow down.
- Wow! Oh, it's fun!

4
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,686
That's nice.

5
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,288
Shalini Chauhan.

6
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,020
Congratulations, Shalini.

7
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,324
Thank you so much. Thanks.

8
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,960
Thanks a lot. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

9
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,091
Thanks.
- Congratulations, Shalini.

10
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,497
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

11
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,027
Thank you.

12
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,517
Smile.

13
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,561
Kevin, l've been sitting
here for the last hour.

14
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,696
lt's hurting now.

15
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,165
Two minutes.

16
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,404
What?.
- Nothing.

17
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,081
What will you do after l go?

18
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,023
l will find someone else
who won't move so much.

19
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,054
You won't find
anyone better than me.

20
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,687
lt's what you think.

21
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:36,632
Wll you miss me?
- Wll you marry me?

22
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,076
Why? Because l'm a Christian?

23
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,046
Or because you have
a wealthy father..

24
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,451
..or now you have officially
become abetter painter than me.

25
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,419
Doesn't dad approve of you?

26
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,492
Religion is very important for him.
And he will never allow me..

27
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,260
And you?
- l don't believe in religion.

28
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:13,699
Then? - l am used to a
certain lifestyle, Kevin.

29
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,409
l've got whatever l wanted
right from my childhood.

30
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,703
And the best of it.

31
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,948
Perhaps it won't be possible
for meto leave that lifestyle..

32
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,018
..all of a sudden now, Kevin.

33
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,972
lf you wanted this then why did
you make those lofty promises?

34
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,140
What are you doing?

35
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,314
Washing my sins off.
- What sins?

36
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,388
l lied to you. l wash my
sins off when l lie. Always.

37
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,267
Kevin. What do you do, Kevin?

38
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,061
l am an artist.

39
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,566
Shalini is an artist too.
What do you do for a living?

40
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,307
People buy my paintings too.
- Really?.

41
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,675
Come with me. l'll show
you something interesting.

42
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,013
Come. Follow me.

43
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Do you see these paintings?

44
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,433
This is for Rs.75,000.

45
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,332
And this one is for Rs.1.5 lakh.

46
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,338
Andthis painting is for Rs.3 lakh.

47
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,039
And none of these is a masterpiece.

48
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,646
The masterpieces are
hanging in my bedroom.

49
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:41,017
You know, the Thakurs, the Roys,
Shreshtas and Desais.

50
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,447
Tell me one thing, Kevin.

51
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,053
How much do the people
pay for your paintings?

52
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,942
Kevin, let's elope.

53
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,983
What?.
- We will run away somewhere else.

54
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,142
Karim, click a photo ofthat spot.

55
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,220
Sir, barrister has come.
- Send him in.

56
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,229
Good morning.
- Good morning, Nilesh.

57
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,105
lt's been a long time.
Five months and 21 days.

58
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,500
Please.
- Thank you.

59
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,006
Tell me, what can l do for you?

60
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,275
Yes. lt's my daughter's wedding.
- Oh! Congrats.

61
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,409
Thank you.

62
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,453
When is it? - Tomorrow.
Sorry for the short notice.

63
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:02,686
l see. So, now tell me the
real reason for coming here.

64
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,695
Kevin Toraso case.

65
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,061
That's an open and shut case.

66
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,966
There are the fingerprints,
motive, he has been..

67
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,062
..arrested from the murder spot.

68
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,707
lt's all there. So, hang him.

69
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,969
That's the problem, it's too simple.

70
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,980
2006 Roy, 2007 Thakur,
everyone knows..

71
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,675
..he is responsible for those fakes.

72
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,342
There is no evidence, he got free.

73
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,614
What are you thinking?

74
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,118
What do you exactly want, Dixit?

75
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,491
l told you, Nilesh.

76
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,631
lt is the duty of the
police to arrest the suspect.

77
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,261
lt is work of the court to release
him or accuse him as a criminal.

78
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,532
So, you have done your job.

79
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,575
They don't call you
for nothing, Nilesh.

80
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,343
You must have read
the witness statements.

81
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,142
Mr. Ramprasad, when
do you open your shop?

82
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,681
Sir, l run a dairy business.

83
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,951
lt opens at 5am and shuts at 8-9pm.

84
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,324
Can you tell us who
would come to meet madam?

85
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,989
The customers did come
to purchase the paintings.

86
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,397
But Mr. Kevin had come that night.

87
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:27,343
Around 9pm, l saw him
entering the house with madam.

88
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,949
Then in the evening when
he started to go home..

89
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,451
..that time too he
didn't leave the house.

90
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,311
And in the morning?

91
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:42,587
l saw sir entering
the house at 7am again.

92
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,464
l too entered the house
five minutes later, sir.

93
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,964
'Murder!'

94
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,007
Did anyone else visit
madam's house often? - Mr.Aditya.

95
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,242
He would come often and
he came that night too.

96
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,706
But then he left.

97
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,042
Ramprasad is right, sir.

98
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,579
l've often seen Aditya
visiting Shalini's house.

99
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,255
What did you hear a
night before the murder?

100
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,531
l heard Shalini's screams too.

101
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,031
''l will kill you. l will kill you.''

102
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,398
l heard her cries too.

103
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,605
Can you tell us who was
upstairs at that time?

104
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,033
He was there.

105
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,670
Anyone else?

106
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,581
And Aditya would visit her.

107
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,951
Okay, tell me, who else
visited madam's house?

108
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:47,387
Yes, sir. The one who drives
the plane would also come.

109
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,958
You mean a pilot?

110
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:55,058
Yes, sir. One man would
come wearing such a uniform.

111
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,970
On Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday.

112
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:04,542
Around 7am in a blue Maruti car.

113
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:10,972
But sir, that was a Friday,
but he did come.

114
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,214
He came at 7am and left at 7:15am.

115
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,511
Do you remember that car number?

116
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,148
Car number?

117
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,495
7546? No.

118
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:33,699
6574. lt was something
like that, sir.

119
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,970
Can you tell us
which airlines is it?

120
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,049
What did you find
out about that pilot?.

121
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,248
He was my brother, Anurag.

122
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,959
How do you know?
- He told me himself.

123
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,391
His car number is 4756.
lt's a blue Maruti.

124
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,705
Have you told that to anyone yet?

125
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,703
lf this matter is revealed, his
family will fall apart, Nilesh.

126
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,077
He did love Shalini
but he didn't murder her.

127
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,414
He had not gone to
meet her that day too.

128
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,009
Are you sure?

129
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,218
No. That's whyl'vecometo you.

130
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,216
lt's evident from his words
that he is telling the truth.

131
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,252
l've been in this
field since last 25 years.

132
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,158
l've seen so much that
l really don'tknow.

133
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,528
The search for the
pilot is still on.

134
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,599
You know, it's like looking
for a needle in ahaystack.

135
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,041
l know that, Nilesh.

136
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,617
But one day, the secret will
be revealed. l need your help.

137
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,950
Thank you so much, Nilesh.
-Anytime.

138
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,955
Thank you once again.
- You are welcome.

139
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,306
No one can win this game except me.

140
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,474
Don't be over-confident.

141
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,017
Come on, stop the game. Come on.

142
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,947
Buddy, are you weaving a
sari for sister-in-law?

143
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,316
Where were you since the morning?

144
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,491
Work, Buddy. l have to work.

145
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,965
Actually, whatever l've
earned by working hard..

146
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,092
..l have to give it to someone.

147
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,693
What do l want?

148
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,505
Kevin, someone has come to meet you.

149
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,033
l never thought that
l will meet you here.

150
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:05,678
Here? l never
expected to meet you again.

151
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,317
l had read in the newspapers.

152
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,987
l came to Mumbai
yesterday for some office work.

153
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,485
You are looking beautiful.

154
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,362
Did you do it, Kevin?

155
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,265
No.

156
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,982
No, l did not. l didn't
meet Shalini that day.

157
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,309
Where were you that day?

158
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,544
l am telling you, l had a flight.

159
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,985
Try to understand, Anurag.

160
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,958
One pilot was spotted
visiting her house at 7am..

161
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,961
..and he left from
there after 15 minutes.

162
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,087
That's impossible.

163
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,288
That's alie!

164
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,538
l was caught in
traffic at 7am on that day.

165
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,305
l had a flight. l am telling you.

166
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,640
No smoking, Anurag.
lt's a government office.

167
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,019
Did you notice any change in
Shalini during the last few days?

168
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,187
Yes, she seemed
fearful due to some reason.

169
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,024
She was fearful? Any reason?

170
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,189
l don't know that.

171
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,334
She never told me.

172
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:40,144
And she had started
drinking a lot from last few days.

173
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,308
Does your wife know about Shalini?

174
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,182
No, she doesn't know that.
She shouldn't know this please.

175
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,686
How did you meet Shalini?

176
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,134
At one painting exhibition.
Uma was along with me.

177
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,403
And she purchased
Shalini's painting too.

178
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,471
What did you want from her, Anurag?

179
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,949
Aman visits the other
woman after marriage..

180
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,047
..only for two reasons.

181
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,391
Physical intimacy or love.

182
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,688
Which was it for you?

183
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,102
You didn't want to be together?

184
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,068
l couldn't leave Uma.
- Why?.

185
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,706
They don't have any children.

186
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,310
She suffers from acute depression.

187
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,550
And Shalini?
- What?

188
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,948
Didn't she want you
both to be together..

189
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,990
She never spoke about it.

190
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,128
What do you know about her past?

191
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,068
She would stay in Delhi.
She was a painter.

192
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,072
She had come to Mumbai
two years ago. That's it.

193
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,076
Tell me something, Anurag.

194
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,014
Didn't you get any official
transport or car from the airlines?

195
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,676
l prefer to drive my own car
when l part from the airport.

196
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,967
'So, what is it?
- What?.'

197
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,597
'A birthday, some anniversary?'

198
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,001
'Or any quarrel because
of these two reasons?'

199
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,702
'What is it?'

200
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,037
'But how do you know that?'

201
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,078
'Did you see anyone else
therein these clothes?'

202
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,688
'l was waiting for my husband here.'

203
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,388
'lt's our first anniversary today.'

204
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,561
'We will have dinner together.
But as usual.'

205
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,965
'As usual, Akshay called
up at the last moment..

206
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,467
..that he has some urgent work
and he has to go to Bangalore.'

207
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:20,055
'Kevin? Kevin?'

208
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,026


209
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,263


210
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,604


211
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,214
What do you think, Nilesh?

212
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,220
Strange. She was a
professional painter.

213
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,058
She was earning well. Good clients.

214
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,958
But still there is
no one except Kevin..

215
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,333
..who knows more about her.

216
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,960
Nilesh Bhargav.

217
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,407
Kevin, l want to help you..

218
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,176
..if you are innocent.

219
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,452
l'd like you to tell
me the entire truth.

220
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,956
You said in the court
that you know Shalini..

221
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,548
..from last eight years.

222
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,493
You loved her. You
were going to marry her.

223
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,693
But she didn't come, l
mean she didn't turn up.

224
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,393
'Kevin, let's elope.'

225
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,584
Am l correct? So you have a motive.

226
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,247
Although not a very strong one
but still, you have a motive.

227
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,960
You came from Calcutta
to Mumbai on August 24th..

228
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,255
..and you met Shalini that night.

229
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,056
And shewas murdered
thenext morning.

230
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,026
l am not entirely convinced.

231
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,971
You want to saythat
from last eight years..

232
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,268
..you were not in
terms with each other?

233
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,970
And suddenly after eight
years you clashed with her..

234
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,946
..in an unknown city
on the first night.

235
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,551
And the next morning
she was murdered. - Yes.

236
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,959
Tell me something,
Kevin. Where did you meet her?

237
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,260
And what exactly
happened that night?

238
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,694
l have said this many
times in the court, sir.

239
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,695
Please say it once
again for my sake.

240
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,013
'Kevin?'

241
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,023
'All the trolleys drowned
in the storm that night.'

242
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,050
'Dad's business was finished.'

243
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,054
'He was devastated. He fell sick.'

244
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,227
'l couldn't have left
him in that condition.'

245
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,703
'l visited your
house on the next day.'

246
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,696
'But you had already left.'

247
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:53,610
'l kept on waiting.
Then we shifted to Delhi.'

248
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,675
'Dad wanted to get me
married in arich family.'

249
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,950
'l had not reason to refuse too.'

250
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,146
'My husband was settled in Dubai.'

251
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,053
'The only thing he was interested
in was physical intimacy.'

252
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,219
'Dad passed away after two years.'

253
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,959
'There was nothing left in Goa,
so, l stayed at Delhi..'

254
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,998
'..for two more years.'

255
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,392
'Then l shifted to Mumbai.'

256
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,165
That place?

257
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,710
l didn't go. l waited for you.

258
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,278
Kevin, you have changed a
lot in these eight years.

259
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,316
You even look so different.

260
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,987
Total corporate types, right?

261
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,050
Or you would've own a
chain of saloons. Sorry.

262
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,557
Dad would've probably approved
if he would've seen you now.

263
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,701
l never heard your
name till eight years.

264
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,507
Do you still paint?
- No.

265
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,544
Aditya, this is Kevin.
He is my old friend.

266
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,684
Can you imagine, we have
met after eight years!

267
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,955
Kevin, this is Aditya.

268
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,323
Well, he is studying Engineering.

269
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,523
Heis a bright young boy.

270
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,628
Aditya, why don't you join us?

271
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,968
You had an appointment
with Dr. Sushila today.

272
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,977
l know, Adi, actually l met
Kevin after so many years..

273
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,103
Yes. Right.

274
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,637
Bye.

275
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,222
Why did you have an
appointment with the doctor?

276
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,997
Traction. As old-age symptom.

277
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,164
Didn't you get prone to it till now?

278
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,101
Where l've kept the money?
Where is the jewellery?

279
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,704
l don't remember anything.

280
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,377
l wonder where l misplace
my earrings and bangles.

281
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,511
Then l never find them again.

282
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,677
l think l'm just losing it.

283
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,618
And Aditya? Why does
he visit the doctor?

284
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,955
He just drives me there.

285
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,685
You loved to drive, didn't you?

286
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,590
There is no joy of
driving in Mumbai.

287
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,432
You are stuck
in traffic for hours.

288
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,667
l'll get it.

289
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,955
Kevin, he is just a
wealthy father's son..

290
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,149
..who just wants to
sleep with me, but l don't.

291
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,616
l haven't.

292
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,690
l think l'll make a move.
l've an appointment.

293
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,502
You still hold it
against me, don't you, Kevin?

294
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,639
lt was not easy for me.

295
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,241
l visited your house
but you were gone.

296
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,208
You didn't even give me that chance.

297
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,276
lt is an eight years old matter,
Shalini. Let's move on.

298
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,611
No, Kevin.

299
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,953
lt was very difficult for
me to ignore that person..

300
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:30,323
..who had done so much
for me after my mother.

301
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,088
lt was a very difficult
decision for me to make.

302
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,424
But that you didn't realise.

303
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,964
Because for you, everything
had to be in black or white.

304
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,628
Do or die. Everything had to
beat the press of a button.

305
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,303
You must be feeling very happy..

306
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,146
..to seeme in this condition,
don't you?

307
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:56,216
An alcoholic. No life. And
still holding on to my past as if..

308
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,380
Look, Shalini.
- Don't look Shalini me, Kevin.

309
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,955
Your ego was hurt
because l was unable..

310
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,219
..to take a decision right then.

311
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,952
Because how can
anyone but your lordship..

312
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,689
..ever use any decision, right?

313
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,572
Good night, Shalini.- Yes, Of
course. Of course, good night.

314
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,968
You will say this because you
must be feeling that you are..

315
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,978
..standing in front of a whore,
to whom young boys..

316
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,570
..come late in the night
for a bang.

317
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Enough, Shalini!

318
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,262
l wasn't feeling well.

319
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,036
l returned to my hotel,
and after that..

320
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,040
..l was at the bar the whole night.

321
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,003
That's true. The bar
manager had given this statement.

322
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:03,519
And you came to meet Shalini
in the morning again, right?

323
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,466
'Shalini! Shalini?'

324
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,702


325
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,542


326
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,549


327
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,084


328
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,153


329
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,031
'Murder! Murder! Murder!'

330
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,296


331
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,066
Two head injuries were
detected in Shalini.

332
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,969
According to the post
mortem report..

333
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,048
..one was an old wound and
other was a fresh injury.

334
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,579
Can you tell us anything
about this old injury? - No.

335
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,390
Did Shalini ever tell you
anything about her fear?

336
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,017
She was completely changed.

337
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,229
l wouldn't have known
even if she had any fear.

338
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,390
Why did you come to Mumbai?

339
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,605
Why, Kevin? Why?.

340
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,570
For a painting assignment.

341
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,603
And who is Rati Bose?

342
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,402
She is my friend.

343
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,481
What did you do after you left Goa?

344
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,950
l would work for a
clearing and furbearing company.

345
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,486
Where?
- Trizona. Delhi.

346
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,263
Then?
- lt was not a fixed job, sir.

347
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,400
And why.. abroad or Paris?

348
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:09,002
Scholarship. A painter
was selected every year..

349
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,605
..and Shalini was
selected that year.

350
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,013
According to the
post-mortem report..

351
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,053
..Shalini was murdered
between 7-8am in the morning.

352
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,292
Kevin was presentat
the bar the whole night.

353
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:36,300
lt's possible that he returned
and killed her in the morning.

354
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,039
But l am just not convinced,
you know.

355
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,676
Adita has a ticket for Kochi.
And it is not used so..

356
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,079
And Rati Bose. We don't
know anything about her.

357
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,684
And Anurag? Anurag has no LMl.

358
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,020
The injury which
Shalini got at night..

359
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,033
..it was possible only
in Kevin's presence.

360
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,068
And Kevin is lying, Nilesh.
He is lying.

361
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,295
The blood was fresh, Dixit.

362
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,497
Yeah, l know. l know.

363
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,973
But it is possible that Kevin had
come there in the morning to check..

364
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,705
..and he found that Shalini
is alive and that time he..

365
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,215
lt's possible. Deception in love.

366
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,251
An old wound. Revenge.

367
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,589
lt's possible. He can do it.

368
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,386
Aditya can do it too
out of jealousy.

369
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,597
And Anurag..
- Blackmail?

370
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:45,164
Yes, sir.

371
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,503
Guru, what are you thinking?

372
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,950
l'm thinking why do they
both want to save me..

373
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,078
..today all of a sudden?

374
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,691
Remember my advice.

375
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,259
Never trust a woman.

376
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,977
How long has it been
since someone has come here?

377
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:09,675
l guess a month. Right?
- Yes, about that time.

378
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you have anyone from
the forensic department..

379
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,585
..who can work of fthe record?

380
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,220
Yes, l have.

381
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,695
Get this grill scanned.
And match it.

382
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,093
l will.

383
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:42,571
''Come to my place for
sometime, my darling.''

384
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:50,680
''Come here for some time.''

385
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,006
Ramprasad!

386
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,950
He is Mr. Bhargav.
He wants to make enquiries.

387
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,278
Hello.

388
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:05,295
l'm always at your service.
Legally yours, sir.

389
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:13,493
Mr. Ramprasad, how many such
packets do you prepare everyday?.

390
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,165
Sir, this is a whole day's work.

391
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:17,631
lt goes on.

392
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,943
The day Shalini was murdered here..

393
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,281
..had you seen the pilot
and Kevin coming here?

394
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,551
Yes, sir.

395
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,349
And you had also told about a
blue Maruti carin the court?

396
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,428
Yes, sir.

397
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,697
Where was it parked?

398
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,227
Over there, sir.

399
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,974
Actually, that parking
place is Mrs. Malkani's.

400
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,946
She leaves in the morning to
drop her children to school.

401
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,952
Mr. Ramprasad, there
are thousands of..

402
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,284
..blue Maruti cars in this city.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,482
So, perhaps it might
be somebody else's car?

404
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,957
lt might not be of that pilot?

405
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:15,155
Sir, l had seen them
going inside the house.

406
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,157
And while going back?

407
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,030
The blue Maruti?

408
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,634
Sir, l didn't see it. l
did not pay attention.

409
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,225
Sir!
- Yes.

410
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,158
Mrs. Dixit has come to meet you.

411
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,291
Dixit?!

412
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,944
Mrs. Dixit?

413
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,353
Mrs. Anurag Dixit.

414
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,548
What can l do for you?

415
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,351
Mrs. Dixit?

416
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,227
Anurag did not kill Shalini,
Mr. Bhargav.

417
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,436
Did you know about both of them?

418
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,969
l'm his wife.

419
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,102
How can you say
confidently that Anurag..

420
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:38,147
l've told you that l'm his wife.

421
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,277
Anurag can do anything but..

422
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,687
He cannot kill somebody.

423
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,963
Please don't cry.

424
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,025
He is innocent.

425
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,036
Please don't cry. l
become very uncomfortable.

426
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,630
l just become nervous
when women cry.

427
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,572
Please..
- Heis innocent.

428
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,979
Yes, l'm sure, he is, but..

429
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,269
How can you know this?

430
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:18,147
Look, Mrs. Dixit. A
girl has been murdered.

431
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:24,950
Your husband Anurag is
just a suspect as of now.

432
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,961
Nobody knows abou tit.

433
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,964
Nothing has been proved yet.
You know!

434
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:39,971
Mr. Bhargav, just a
small request. Please.

435
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,143
Nobody should know that l
had cometo meet you today.

436
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,143
Sure. l promise you.

437
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,280
Thank you.

438
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,960
Please allow me.

439
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,488
Thank you.

440
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,560
Good night, Mrs. Dixit.

441
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,360
Good night.

442
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:16,107
Mrs. Dixit, l know that
you are Anurag's wife.

443
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,947
But how did you think
of coming to me?

444
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,085
l heard him talking
to commissioner.

445
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:48,635
For the first time in his life, your
papais slightly confused, dear.

446
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,544
Papais smart, right?

447
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,964
Blue Oranges.

448
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,306
The very quest for
happiness leads us away from it.

449
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,947
lt takes us to many a shore to
getaway from the real goal.

450
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,157
A real happiness lies within
the confines of our own selves.

451
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,960
Seek not in the world what lies..

452
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,353
What not..

453
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,970
''To the conflicting thoughts.''

454
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:53,975
''To wayward paths.''

455
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,409
''What is your promise to them?''

456
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:02,949
''What is your promise?''

457
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,947
''Oh, life, tell me.''

458
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:13,028
''What is your intention?''

459
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,963
''What is your intention?''

460
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:34,347
''Even in crowd
everybody is walking lonely.''

461
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:44,961
'Everybody is
burning in their own fire.''

462
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:49,961
''What is the fault?
What kind of punishment?''

463
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:55,966
''Why do we lose even after winning?''

464
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:04,937
''Oh, life, tell me.''

465
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:11,151
''What is your intention?''

466
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,615
Can l drop you somewhere?

467
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,284
Yes, sure.

468
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,020
Thanks.

469
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,354
How much?

470
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,023
What?!

471
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,157


472
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,232
You are giving a wrong
person a ride, sweetheart.

473
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,967
l'm not a strumpet.

474
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,970
First left and straight.

475
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,974
''Tell me, O life..

476
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:40,347
..what's your intention?''

477
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,351
How long was Shalini
staying with you?

478
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,626
Around one and a half years.

479
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,219
Can you tell something about her?

480
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:59,166
She was a good girl. She
would pay the rent on time.

481
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,961
She was a pleasure seeking girl.

482
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,704
Drinks, many men.

483
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,972
Even on that night, there was a
sound of a drink bottle breaking.

484
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,604
Sir, we are ordinary people.

485
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,209
Rent is very important for us.

486
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:21,481
With this court and polic matters,
l'll be finished.

487
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,022
Mr. Goel, can you tell me
something about that night?

488
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,364
There was sound of fighting.
Two-three times.

489
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,223
Two or three?
- Four.

490
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,504
The fourth scream was heard
15 minutes after the third.

491
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:43,239
You've told in thec ourt
that you heard Shalini saying..

492
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,279
''l'll kill you.''

493
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,952
Fourth scream. There
was a male voice too.

494
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,613
l'll kill you.

495
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,951
There was a man's voice
after the third scream too.

496
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,696
But 'l'll kill you' was
after the fourth scream.

497
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,292
Who was upstairs?

498
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,369
Must be Kevin. We
didn't see him going out.

499
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:17,007
Mr. Goel, you didn't
see him while coming in?

500
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,942
Ramprasad told that in the court.

501
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:25,087
When you heard Shalini
saying 'l'll kill you..'

502
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,546
Didn't you go up and check?

503
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,082
Check?

504
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:34,555
Sir, Shalini would
scream even when alone.

505
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,092
There was sound of
her crying many times.

506
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,231
On that night we had
dinner and wereon bed to sleep.

507
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,966
Who else stays with you?

508
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,138
Our son Hari. He is studying inside.

509
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,946
Graduation. B.Com.

510
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,548
Third time. He has failed twice.

511
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,014
Hari also heard the sound of fights.

512
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,350
Would you like to meet him?

513
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,950
Why not?

514
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:05,618
Please come.

515
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,304
Hari! Dear Hari!

516
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,239
Open the door, Hari.

517
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,405


518
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,607


519
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,946
Hari, please open the door.

520
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,412


521
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,282
Hari, what happened?

522
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,417


523
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,089


524
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,960
Son, he is Mr. Bhargav.

525
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,696
He wants to talk about Shalini.

526
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,095
l won't take much of your time.

527
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,612
What were you doing?

528
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,619
l dosed off while l was reading.

529
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,429
You were sleeping?
- Yes.

530
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,960
Where?
- What do you mean?

531
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,629
l mean, on the bed or on
the table while reading.

532
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,098
Here?

533
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:32,272
Good.

534
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,290
Did you hear anything
on that night, Hari?

535
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,092
Yes. Thesound of fighting.

536
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,635
How many hours do
you study in a day?

537
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,569
12 to 15 hours.

538
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,634
On this table?

539
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,481
You were reading here
on that night.

540
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,618
Did you see somebody
coming and going?

541
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,684
No. That side is blocked.

542
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,485
Do you know Shalini?

543
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,419
No..

544
00:53:55,265 --> 00:54:00,362
After waking up from sleep,
firstly, you comb your hair.

545
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,169
Because your hair are
not dishevelled at all.

546
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,501
Let's go. Thank you.

547
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,036
My pleasure.

548
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,961
Jailor!

549
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,485
Such mistakes should
not be repeated again.

550
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,626
Your case can get
weakened with such reports.

551
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,300
Why do you both want to help me?

552
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,972
Just a lack of occupation.

553
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,684
When you left
Shalini's house on that night..

554
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,952
..had you closed the door?

555
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,682
Perhaps, l did.

556
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:35,289
Tell me something, Kevin.

557
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,966
Did you really not know
anything about that old injury?

558
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,296
No.

559
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,276
Nilesh, some information has
been obtained from Rati Bose.

560
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,213
ln the last onea nd a half months..

561
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,157
..she had come to Mumbai twice.

562
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,961
She had come on 25th too.
The day Shalini was murdered.

563
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,959
She had come for just one day.

564
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,625
She is coming again today.

565
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,963
l want to know why
l've been brought here.

566
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,633
ls this a way?.

567
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,304
Madam, why do you get angry at me?

568
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,974
You talk to the boss.

569
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:25,203
Call your superiors now. l
want an explanation now.

570
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,339
Boss has arrived.

571
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,945
Rati Bose?
- Yes.

572
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,544
Weare talking about Kevin Toraso.

573
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,356
You know him. Heis in
our custody right now.

574
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,555
We want to get some
matters clarified. That's all.

575
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,958
So to get some matters clarified,
you bring..

576
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,033
..people here in this manner?

577
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,967
l'm sorry. We apologise for that.

578
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,495
When this incident occurred, madam..

579
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:54,568
On Friday 25th last month.
You were in Mumbai?

580
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,239
You came to Mumbai
by the first flight.

581
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,946
Yes. l had a meeting
with SCM bank chairman.

582
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,276
This incident occurred
early in the morning.

583
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,944
l don't think bankers have
their meeting early in the morning.

584
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,685
Even the ones that don't sleep.

585
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,482
What time was your meeting?

586
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,282
At 11 o'clock.

587
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,154
Your flight had landed at 6 o'clock.

588
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:17,228
l had a room booked
in hotel Continental.

589
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,561
You can check their records.

590
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,966
And office always
books a room for methere.

591
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,299
How did you find out
about themurder?

592
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,035
l read in newspapers.

593
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,007
Right. Thank you.

594
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,079
Thank you. Can l leave now?

595
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,346
Of course, you may leave.

596
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,552
When we need you, l'll call.

597
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,357
And when you need to be summoned,
you should come.

598
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,226
Of course, l understand
your anxiety.

599
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,966
But you should have told
once what you areup to?

600
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,029
We'll call our witness.

601
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:11,214
Dear, papa is a bit confused.
Can you help?

602
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,016
You think this will help?

603
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,610
Shewas suffering from sciatica.

604
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,011
That's why l had
advised traction to her.

605
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,354
Was it very painful?

606
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:55,561
Sometimes, yes.And to
add her alcohol problems.

607
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,091
That only added to them.

608
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:05,105
Did someone usually accompany her?

609
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,302
Aditya Mehra.

610
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:16,679
On that day, you had gone to
Kochi by a flight, Aditya.

611
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,613
Am l right?
- Our branch officer..

612
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,951
Aditya will reply, Mr. Mahra.

613
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,957
Tell me, Aditya. The
night before when Kevin..

614
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,966
..left from Shalini's
house at about 11 :30 at night.

615
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,697
You were standing outside then.

616
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,501
Near your red Mercedes. Right?

617
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,074
l know that you have said
something else in the court.

618
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,410
But l think this is the truth.

619
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,414
Mr. Bhargav, Aditya was at home.

620
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:59,951
Aditya! Did you know Shalini?

621
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,023
Yes.

622
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,964
Thank you for being honest.

623
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,028
Mr. Bhargav, we are
honourable and responsible citizens.

624
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,630
Aditya, a fight before murder
you had gone to meet Shalini.

625
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,634
Correct?

626
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,349
Why?

627
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,078
She had an appointment with doctor.

628
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,294
How did you both
meet for the first time?

629
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:44,131
She could not get an auto or a taxi.

630
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:49,634
l was passing from there.
l offered her lift.

631
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:59,046
Your son is respectable,
responsible and helpful person.

632
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,957
Tell me Aditya, was
Kevin there on that night..

633
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,961
..when you had gone to
meet Shalini?

634
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,688
Yes.

635
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,688
Had you met him before that?

636
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,259
No.

637
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,027
Did Kevin know you?

638
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,631
How?

639
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,976
You have a red Mercedes, Aditya?

640
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:28,575
Then how did Kevin Toraso find
out that you've a red Mercedes?

641
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:34,545
Tell me, Shalini's bedroom
window opens towards the factory.

642
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,956
How did Kevin see you
near the car, Aditya?

643
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,620
Let me tell you..
- How? Please.

644
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,160
l was not there at that time.
l had gone home straight.

645
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:57,469
l got embarrassed
today because of you.

646
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,672
Only because you got
involved with a woman, who..

647
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:08,023
Aditya, l just hope
you are not telling lies.

648
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,291
No, dad. l swear.

649
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,684
He is lying.

650
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,320
How do you know?

651
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,124
Where was Anurag on that night?

652
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,257
l didn't ask.

653
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,001
Perhaps Aditya had returned.

654
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,973
But he said he was in Kochi.

655
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,145
That's what his manager says.

656
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,538
And he was the only
one at the branch.

657
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:39,281
But how did Kevin find out
that Aditya has a red Mercedes?

658
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,284
Shalini's bedroom window
doesn't open towards the road.

659
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,963
Nilesh, is it possible that
Kevin knew before hand that..

660
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,554
..Aditya has such a car.

661
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,694
lt's possible. l
didn't think about it.

662
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:00,972
When is the next hearing?

663
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,201
Thursday.

664
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,072
l think perhaps he'll get abail.

665
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,629
Your magic is great.

666
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,030
Good morning, sir.

667
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:48,114
Sir! That woman!

668
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,488
She used to come to Shalini.

669
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,561
Today sheis in veil.

670
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,097
l had not seen her in a veil before.

671
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:24,617
Who killed her, Kevin?

672
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:28,687
l don't know.

673
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,230
You still love her, don't you?

674
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,968
8 years before.. yes.
Nothing else mattered.

675
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,978
And after 8 years?

676
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,204
l just feel sad.

677
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,346
So? What is your plan now?

678
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,081
l'll hire a good lawyer who
will keep me away from that place.

679
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,217
l don't understand why
they want to help me.

680
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,964
First they had put
me in jail and then..

681
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,966
..the same people want to save me.

682
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,633
But why are you getting
involved in this along with me?

683
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,182
Meeting with you just on one
night has changed my life, Kevin.

684
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,953
And whatever has
happened between us..

685
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,215
..l've told Akshay
everything about it.

686
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,130
lt is anew life for me.

687
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,061
So, yes, l owe that to you.

688
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,703
Good. l could be of
use to you for something.

689
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,630
When are you going back?

690
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,475
l'm not going back.
l've taken 15 days leave.

691
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,034
Hey! What do you want?

692
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,001
l want a packet.

693
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,137
Who has sent you?

694
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,940
Dixit. Commissioner Dixit.
- Why?.

695
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,948
l'm a poor man, sir.

696
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,946
l had sent it last month
to the police station.

697
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,152
Mr. Promod and Kini
had come together.

698
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:12,955
Both took it, sir.

699
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,696
What do you sell? What?

700
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,694
Narcotics? Drugs? Brown sugar?

701
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,225
What do you sell?

702
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,094
Drugs.

703
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,326
Follow the blue car.

704
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,027
Hurry up. Quick.

705
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,470
500,000.

706
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,944
lt is not possible for me
for less than 1 million.

707
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,952
What are you saying?
Mr. Qasim had told me..

708
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,683
..that you'll
co-operate with us fully.

709
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,492
l had agreed to come to
Mumbai at Qasim's instance.

710
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,619
Otherwise..

711
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:59,399
l understand. Mr. Kevin, you've
asked for 1 million. l agree.

712
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,260
But when?

713
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,011
lt is very late at night,
Mr. Mahta.

714
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,547
Now you should leave.

715
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,192
Yes, it is very late at night.

716
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,684
Yes.

717
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:35,961
Before l go, here
are 100,000 as advance.

718
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,971
And this is the reference.

719
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,600
When?

720
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,338
l'll phone you.

721
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,251
When, Mr. Kevin?

722
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,017
One month.

723
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,962
Thank you. Thank you so much.

724
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,677
What do you do, Kevin?

725
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:03,024
Art agent. l had told you before.

726
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,020
l had come to Mumbai
for this assignment.

727
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,255
You get 1 million
for one assignment?

728
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,090
lf you are an art agent,
why these photocopies?

729
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,030
Why do you get involved with
some thing which you don't know?

730
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,534
l'm sorry.

731
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,182
You make fakes. Don't you?

732
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,417
You make fakes, right?

733
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,355
This is the last one.

734
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,692
l promise.

735
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:50,295
Trust me.

736
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,101
Yes.

737
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:02,016
Where were you the night
before the murder, Anurag?

738
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,954
l was at home. Uma was with me.

739
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,321
l'll have to ask Uma about this.

740
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,956
What time was your flight?

741
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:17,155
8:15.

742
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,632
l had enquired. Your flight had got
delayed on that night. Am l correct?

743
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,334
l've to repeat the same
thing again and again.

744
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,369
Haven't you seen the
airport crossing signal?

745
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,041
lt's a nightmare. l
was stuck in the traffic.

746
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,133
l've already told you.

747
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,280
Did Uma know about you and Shalini?
- No.

748
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,081
Anurag, let's stop playing
this cat and mouse game.

749
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,211
l want to know the truth.

750
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,345
l'm not playing any games.

751
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:45,559
When something happens a
family member tries to save.

752
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,629
l've not done anything,
but you are so mean?

753
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,561
Shut up! That's enough.
This is not home.

754
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,690
This is office. That's enough.

755
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,002
What's the matter?
What's your problem?

756
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:32,466
What's my problem? You
have the answer to it.

757
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,967
You've caused it.

758
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,203
What do you want to say?.

759
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,006
Don't try to act innocent.

760
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:42,244
What do you think? Am l a fool?

761
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,949
lf l stay at home, it
means l don't know..

762
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,021
..what you are doing outside home?

763
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,146
What am l doing?

764
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,190
Come on, stop it,
Anurag. l know everything.

765
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,551
About Shalini and you.

766
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:53,685
Don't talk nonsense.

767
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,354
What was it? Was she pregnant?

768
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:58,558
Enough! Not a word more, otherwise..

769
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,568
Otherwise what will you do?
You'll kill me, right?

770
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,694
Shut up.

771
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,011
Grill.

772
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:20,010
Liar. How did he get the money!

773
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:25,627
Stealing! lt is possible.

774
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,024
Stealing from the dead?

775
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:32,393
Only one window in Shalini's room.

776
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:39,700
Mrs. Goel heard screams four times..

777
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,975
Twice..

778
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,473
Hello.

779
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,947
Hariprasad Goel.

780
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,354
Okay.

781
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,037
We have got your fingerprints.

782
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,701
You had entered Shalini's house.

783
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,375
No. l don't know.

784
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,947
You had given a statement
that you had not gone to..

785
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,209
..Shalini's room since
last one and a half year.

786
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,614
So how is it possible that
your fingerprints are there?

787
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,085
You've murdered Shalini,
darn it. You did.

788
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,951
l didn't.
- You did! - No.

789
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,546
Shut up. You've murdered Shalini.

790
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,150
How these
fingerprints were found there?

791
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,491
You've broken the lock ofher house.

792
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:36,086
Heis lying, Nilesh. He is
lying through his teeth.

793
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,226
Hari!

794
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,999
You used to go out from your window.

795
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:52,006
You used to climb up and you
used to enter Shalini's house.

796
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,541
She thought she has
begun losing her things.

797
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:01,352
She was not losing them.
You used to steal.

798
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,215
You used to steal.

799
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,958
lf you tell the
truth and help us then..

800
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,500
..perhaps l'll be able to help you.

801
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,705
Otherwise.. the decision is yours.

802
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:24,011
Tell them, son. Tell them.

803
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,676
He will help you in some way.

804
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,074
Tell him.

805
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:37,220
Yes, l had cut the grill.

806
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:44,030
You used to steal. You still steal.

807
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,562
Money, jewellery, etc.

808
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,026
Yes.

809
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,601
You had gone to
Shalini's room to steal.

810
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,037
l've not murdered anybody.

811
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,471
What else did you
notice on that night?

812
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,100
l don't know.

813
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:05,509
You used to watch the street
from your bathroom window.

814
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,686
You've watched the
street many times from there.

815
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,957
When Shalini used to
come and leave..

816
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,394
When the house was empty..

817
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:22,963
Had you seen
somebody coming or going..

818
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,629
..after Kevin had left?

819
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:29,974
l don't know anything. l
have not seen anything.- Sir!

820
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,443
The car has been identified.

821
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,013
lt belongs to Mr. Anurag Dixit.

822
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,475
Airline Pilot.

823
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,607
Hey! Hari!

824
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,244
Catch him.

825
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,145
Hari, don't run away!

826
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,689
Hari, listen to me!

827
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,350
Hari!

828
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,120

830
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:57,401
He's running! Hey, stop! Catch him.

831
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,633
Where are you running away?

832
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,944
Dixit! Dixit!
- Yes.

833
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,071
Hari has not killed Shalini.

834
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,115
What do you mean, he didn't? - Just
tell you guys not to frighten him.

835
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,476
Heis justa drug addict.

836
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:10,608
What do you mean?

837
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,153
Dixit, if he had done it, it
would have been an impulsive act.

838
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,279
Nilesh, heis..

839
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:15,413
Otherwise his
fingerprints would have been found..

840
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,548
..on the murder weapon also.

841
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,023
He has admitted the crime, Nilesh.

842
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,684
This murder was planned, Dixit.

843
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,695
Don't let him escape!
- Catch him.

844
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,610
Sir, l swear, my son is innocent.

845

Where is Anurag?
- Sir has already gone.

01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,470
You take her to the hospital.

868
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:55,149
Dr. Chopra. His number is written
in a dairy kept in that drawer.

869
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:01,280
Uma knew about
Shalini and Anurag, Nilesh.

Why am l stopped? Why are they..
- Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

Why? What's wrong with her?

876
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,704
Don't try to pretend, Anurag.

877

879
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,939
But why?
- Shut up!

880
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,277
Stop!
- Come on, take him.

881
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,477
But what have l done?
- Shut up! Get in.

882
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,950
You will have to tell me
what l've done, Brother.

883
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:07,078
l say go and sit in the van.

884
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,212
But why?
- Go!

885
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:09,620
Because your car has
been identified.

886
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,693
Go in, l said. Anurag, l don't
want to listen to anything.

887
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:59,702
Mr. Goel, l want to see
Hari's room once again.

888
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,503
Uma, what happened? Did Anurag..

889
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:41,004
No.Anurag is innocent.

890
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:52,357
l had extra pills by mistake.
- Why, Uma? Why?.

891
01:23:54,462 --> 01:24:01,300
The night before the murder..
was Anurag at home? - Yes.

892
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:06,972
Did you ever go to meet Shalini?

893
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:18,084
Yes. Once or twice.
To buy the paintings.

894
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:21,680
Why did you come to the court?

895
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,359
Because l was concerned
about Anurag.

896
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,557
Tell me something, Uma.

897
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,431
Did you know about
Anurag and Shalini?

898
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:45,207
Yes. After her death.

899
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:50,945
Take care, Uma.

900
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,699
l know which difficulties
you are undergoing, Kevin.

901
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,500
But that's over now.

902
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,678
Nothing is over yet.

903
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:05,793
Our Mumbai news-reporter
Shishir Joshi has just reported..

904
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:09,957
Our Mumbai news-reporter
Shishir Joshi has just reported..

905
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,964
..that the police have
arrested the pilot..

906
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:15,627
..which they were hunting
for the Shalini murder case.

907
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,967
This pilot is Anurag Dixit,
the younger brother of..

908
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,972
..the police commissioner of Mumbai.

909
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,975
After this breaking news,
it is possible that now..

910
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,942
..the major suspicion
will be shifted from..

911
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,606
..the main suspect Kevin
Toraso to Anurag Dixit.

912
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:30,946
Kevin Toraso was released on bail.

913
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,953
Please pay attention,
Anurag Dixit's wife..

914
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:37,616
..is admitted to the ICU
ward of City Care hospital.

915
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:41,491
So,the police are unable to
take any statement from her yet.

916
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:45,157
And Anurag Dixit too has
not given any statement yet.

917
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,961
The sources have informed that..

918
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,366
..Commissioner Dixit
already knew about it.

919
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,494
l love you, Kevin.

920
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:55,440
We tried to ask him, but
he refusedt o speak to us.

921
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:59,613
We'll be back again with the
news related to this case.

922
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:07,944
Hello? Yes?

923
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,017
Yes.

924
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,023
Okay.

925
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:25,029
Yes. Okay. Bye.

926
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:41,952
Sir, thereis a fax for you.

927
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,943
Dixit, what is the
date on the day wecame..

928
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:17,957
..to know about that
fake Roy painting?

929
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:26,961
Fine.

930
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,427
Okay. Thank you.

931
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:09,700
Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh!

932
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:16,015
Hello. Her Majesty, Ms.
Rudra Bhargav..

933
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:18,017
..wishes you a very good evening.

934
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:20,214
She is not in a mood to
have a drink right now..

935
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,017
..so she shall join
us in a cool fizz.

936
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,617
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

937
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:32,497
To which school do you go to?

938
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:37,970
She is addicted to
this junk, here you are.

939
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,573
She can't talk. Please come.

940
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,542
Here we are, Your Majesty.

941
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:46,613
Your chocolate..

942
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,607
Chocolate.

943
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,282
l've never seen such a wheel chair.

944
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:54,944
l have personally designed it.

945
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:00,955
How did it happen?

946
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,563
lt was a car accident.

947
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,566
My wife, you can see her photograph.

948
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:14,103
She was killed, my in-laws
were killed, Rudra was paralysed.

949
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:17,268
And l managed to escape
with just a broken arm.

950
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,942
That's why you stopped practicing?

951
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:25,011
What option did l have? Who
would have taken care of her?

952
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:26,950
Her studies. Schooling.

953
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:29,420
But that was not the only reason.

954
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:34,551
So? - l loved being a
detective in my childhood.

955
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:37,222
l was the monitor of my class.

956
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:40,360
So, when the
interclass plays were held..

957
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,561
..l would always
choose detective stories.

958
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,228
And l would play the
detective's role.

959
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,969
But when l went up to the
stage for the first time..

960
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:50,339
..l became so nervous that
l accused the wrong person.

961
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:52,946
My father almost
disowned me for that.

962
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:58,947
Kevin, some whiskey.
- Yes. Thank you.

963
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,483
Water?
- Yes.

964
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:05,548
Rati, a drink for you?
- No, thanks.

965
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,958
Some juice?
- Yeah, sure.

966
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:13,557
Okay. Orange juice. Coming up.

967
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:16,427
Blue oranges?

968
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:22,234
This is Rudra's favourite book.

969
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:29,677
lt says that if we believe
in something, it happens.

970
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:35,421
lf we want to do something
whole heartedly, we do it.

971
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:43,093
Ultimately wha twe want to see,
what wet hink happens.

972
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:49,959
So, Rudra and l are
convinced that she will..

973
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:55,031
..definitely walk on
her legs some day.

974
01:31:57,712 --> 01:31:59,009
Of course, you will.

975
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,341
Why have you called me here?

976
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:11,288
To play the game of detective.

977
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:17,221
Mahadev is just not a cook,
he is a chef, you know.

978
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:24,433
What's wrong, Kevin?
Didn't you like the food?

979
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,633
Oh! lt was great.

980
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:32,076
But you didn't tell me yet, sir,
why have you called me?

981
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,944
lf you remember,
Kevin, you were implicated..

982
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,951
..in the case of a fake
painting two years ago?

983
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:41,011
My innocence was proved.

984
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,146
Yes, l know that.

985
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:46,159
Butl also know that you did it.

986
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:49,958
You escaped because
technically you were..

987
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,622
..not present where
you should have been.

988
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:56,234
Because you had a strong alibi.

989
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:00,969
Mohammed Kasim in Delhi.

990
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:06,679
He said in the court that you
were in Delhi and not in Mumbai.

991
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,677
There was a railway strike that day.

992
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:16,953
And every passenger
travelling by flight was scanned.

993
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:22,954
So? - So? So, l want to
say that day you were..

994
01:33:23,064 --> 01:33:25,692
..notin Delhi but Mumbai, Kevin.

995
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:28,634
And you reached Mumbai very fast.

996
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:34,098
Not by train, not by
plane but byroad.

997
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:40,939
You said you worked for
some Truzor company at Delhi..

998
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:44,609
A clearing and
forwarding company. Am l right?

999
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:52,086
Theday that painting
was delivered in Mumbai..

1000
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:57,360
..Truzor company of Delhi
had made one more delivery.

1001
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:02,360
Mr. Sunil Mahra had
made the delivery.

1002
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:07,700
The item of the
delivery was ared Mercedes.

1003
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:16,950
You knew, Kevin. You knew
that Aditya has a red Mercedes.

1004
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,417
Neither did l know
Aditanor his father.

1005
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:21,948
Someone else had taken
that delivery.

1006
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:26,083
Because you had
a strong alibi. Right?

1007
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,024
Mohammed Kasim.

1008
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,963
And Mohammed Kasim was the owner..

1009
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:33,625
..of the Truzor company, Kevin.

1010
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:52,618
Shalini had a painting
of Krishna and Sita.

1011
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:56,686
Does it mean anything to you?

1012
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:07,691
No.

1013
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,476
Did you know Aditya, Kevin?

1014
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,550
Did you know Adita or not?

1015
01:36:05,659 --> 01:36:08,685
What's wrong with you,
Rati? l didn't know him.

1016
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:11,293
Then what's the mystery
of your car and Kasim?

1017
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,365
l want to know!

1018
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:16,026
l want to know!

1019
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:19,368
l was here. l was in Mumbai.

1020
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:21,565
l was involved in that racket.

1021
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,941
Butl didn't know that
Shalini is here in Mumbai.

1022
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:28,414
l don't even remember that the
car belonged to Sunil Mehra.

1023
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:30,946
l don't even remember
that Shalini was in Mumbai.

1024
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:33,952
Oh, no! l can't kill,
Rati. l can't ditch Shalini.

1025
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,478
'Washing my sins off.'

1026
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:07,079
'You loved to drive, didn't you?'

1027
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:10,290
'There is no joy of
driving in Mumbai.'

1028
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:13,954
'You are stuck in
traffic for hours.'

1029
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,692
'l lied to you.'

1030
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,970
'l always wash my
sins off when l lie.'

1031
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,670
'l always wash my
sins off when l lie.'

1032
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:38,947
'Shalini, slow down. Slow down.
- Kevin, it's no use to stop me now.''

1033
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:41,351
'No! Slow down.
- Kevin, don't be boring.'

1034
01:37:41,455 --> 01:37:44,015
'Slow down.
- Wow! What fun!'

1035
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,955
'There's no joy
in driving in Mumbai.'

1036
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:49,423
'You are stuck
in traffic for hours.'

1037
01:39:01,735 --> 01:39:05,967
Yes, Kevin?
- Why did Anurag kill Shalini?

1038
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:14,603
Anurag didn't kill anyone.

1039
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:18,007
That photograph is of Delhi, right?

1040
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:25,082
Right. My wife and my
in-laws were from Delhi.

1041
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:27,685
When did this accident take place?

1042
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:29,286
Four years ago.

1043
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:33,029
Shalini was also in
Delhi four years ago.

1044
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:36,967
She always washed her
sins off when she lied.

1045
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,039
And that night she lied to me.

1046
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:42,440
Who was driving the other car?

1047
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:52,075
Who was driving the other car,
Nilesh? - Shalini Chauhan.

1048
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:57,421
Very smart, Kevin.

1049
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:08,626
lt was just an accident.

1050
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:12,703
Just an accident!

1051
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:18,537
Just an accident? You
call it an accident?

1052
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:22,272
That accident killed my wife.

1053
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,008
She was pregnant.

1054
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,423
And she died. My child
also along with her.

1055
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:38,164
Do you see Rudra? Do
you see her condition?

1056
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,292
She can't talk at all.

1057
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,165
She is restricted from
the bed to the wheelchair.

1058
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:48,037
That's it. Day in and day out.

1059
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,941
You don't have any dear
one who is handicapped..

1060
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,948
..with whom you have
to spend your life.

1061
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:58,075
That's why you won't realise it.

1062
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:06,619
Yes. Alas, if only
you had some dear one.

1063
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,622
They had suppressed this case.

1064
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:13,963
Just swept it under the carpet.

1065
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:16,426
Brake fail? Brake fail, my foot!

1066
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,968
She was drunk. She was irritated.

1067
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,942
They were wealthy. They had a
contact with the higher authorities.

1068
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,278
Someone took the blame
upon himself for money.

1069
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:30,941
That's it. Finished.
The case was closed.

1070
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:32,676
And l was unable to do anything.

1071
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:34,077
l was helpless.

1072
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:37,681
Barrister Nilesh Bhargav
was made to look like a fool.

1073
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,956
And you call it an accident?
An accident?

1074
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:44,360
lt was not an accident,
it was a crime. A murder.

1075
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:58,404
What is the real reason of
calling me that time, Nilesh?

1076
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:06,618
To introduce you to Rudra.

1077
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:17,020
How did Shalini get
her firsti njury?.

1078
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:20,090
Didn't you hear the sound
of the breaking of glass?

1079
01:42:25,272 --> 01:42:28,036
No.
- Never mind, it happens.

1080
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:32,402
'Enough, Shalini.'

1081
01:42:36,049 --> 01:42:38,142
Why were you inquiring
about Shalini's painting?

1082
01:42:41,722 --> 01:42:44,623
Shalini's father's
namewas Janakraj Chauhan.

1083
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:51,563
Think. Think, Kevin. Think.

1084
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:58,435
She had to be for it,
Kevin. She had to be for it.

1085
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:03,937
Hari's death was not
just a mere accident.

1086
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:55,020
'Hello! Excuse me.'

1087
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,091
'Hi. l've never seen
you here before.'

1088
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:05,494
'There is a strange feeling
in my stomach. - Excuse me.'

1089
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:08,504
'lt seems l'm hungry
or l am in love.'

1090
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:12,944
'And the only way l can find out
is by taking you out for dinner.'

1091
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:15,945
'Are those your lines?'

1092
01:44:17,117 --> 01:44:19,950
'No. Actually from some film.'

1093
01:44:41,008 --> 01:44:42,976
'You must be feeling very happy..

1094
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,271
..to seeme in this condition,
don't you?'

1095
01:44:46,713 --> 01:44:49,944
'An alcoholic. No life.'

1096
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:24,072
Mahadev.
- Yes, sir?

1097
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:31,089
Send this to the commissioner.
- Okay.

1098
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:36,960
And send this other one to
that boy Kevin. Kevin Toraso.

1099
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:39,089
Kevin?
- Yes.

1100
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:57,006
'Papa?'

1101
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,208
'Oh my God.'

1102
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:01,949
'Rudra?'

1103
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:08,551
'Call Kevin. - Please calm down.'
- 'Call Kevin.

1104
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,220
Okay, we'll call him.
We'll call him.'

1105
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:12,958
'Where is Kevin? - Doctor,
you will have to do something.'

1106
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,368
'Doctor, don't worry about money.'

1107
01:46:15,736 --> 01:46:17,363
'She is bleeding profusely.'

1108
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:19,234
'What are you doing?
lt's paining badly.'

1109
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:20,567
'Yes, dear. l am here. l am here.'

1110
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:22,164
'Doctor, please do something.'

1111
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,266
'l can't do anything, Mr. Chauhan.'

1112
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:26,144
'Her alcohol level is very high.
lt is a police case.'

1113
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:28,146
'Call Kevin.
- Yes. Yes, dear.'

1114
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:29,272
'Call Kevin! - Yes, l'll call him.

1115
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:30,407


1116
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:31,950
'Doctor, you will
have to do something.'

1117
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,281
'Don't worry about money
at all. Savemy daughter..'

1118
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,482
'lt is not the  matter
ofmoney, Mr. Chauhan.'

1119
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:59,542
'Look at the game of destiny,
Dixit.'

1120
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:03,611
'You had to come to me for
this case in this entire Mumbai.'

1121
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:08,952
'The system before
which l had found myself..'

1122
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,956
'..so weak and
helpless four years ago..

1123
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:15,960
'..today it has come to me to
become the puppet of my hands.'

1124
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:20,690
'Police. Law. Criminal. Evidence.'

1125
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:25,233
'Perhaps l can't express
this feeling in words.'

1126
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:29,102
'lt was a sensational game for me.'

1127
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:32,941
'l could change
its rules as l liked.'

1128
01:47:33,713 --> 01:47:35,340
'l could control anything.'

1129
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:37,207
'l could convict anyone.'

1130
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:38,677
'l could acquit anyone.'

1131
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:42,350
'l was the criminal.
l was the judge.'

1132
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:45,553
'l felt like the Almighty.'

1133
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:50,958
'But this was a
chance for me as well.'

1134
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:56,158
'To know that person more
personally whom l've killed.'

1135
01:47:57,404 --> 01:47:59,964
'You know and God is the witness..

1136
01:48:00,073 --> 01:48:03,509
..that l didn't know Anurag.'

1137
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:07,947
'At that time, l could
see only one face..'

1138
01:48:08,048 --> 01:48:10,073
'..in the passion of
hatred and revenge.'

1139
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:11,674
'Shalini.'

1140
01:48:12,452 --> 01:48:14,010
'l was so confident of my plan.'

1141
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,157
'l didn't know that Kevin will
also get involved in this case.'

1142
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:21,550
'All the evidences
were against him.'

1143
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:26,960
'To prove Kevin and
Anurag innocent..'

1144
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:29,695
'..it became more important for
meto get involved in this case.'

1145
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,967
'As for that pilot, l had
purposely chosen a Friday..'

1146
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:39,273
'..with the hope that the
pilot must have some alibi.'

1147
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:43,950
'But unfortunately, Anurag
didn't have any fool proof alibi.'

1148
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:50,156
'My opinion regarding this case
completely changed with these two.'

1149
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:54,957
'Now my intention was
to prove them innocent.'

1150
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:58,961
'More characters were
involved during this period.'

1151
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:05,432
'Hari's reality, Aditya's lie.'

1152
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:09,507
'This case became more
interesting for me with them.'

1153
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,942
'They raised so many
questions for me..'

1154
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:15,139
'..that l was unable to
control myself..

1155
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:17,148
..from finding answers to them.'

1156
01:49:17,717 --> 01:49:19,685
'lt was more than
just a game for me now.'

1157
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,614
'l got involved in my
investigation with them.'

1158
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:25,957
'The thrills of
unanswered questions..'

1159
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:28,357
'..momentarily took me
away from my main objective.'

1160
01:49:30,664 --> 01:49:31,961
'During this, one more accident..'

1161
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:34,966
'..changed the
direction of this case.'

1162
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:37,026
'Hari's death.'

1163
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:42,297
'Perhaps, Mr. Goel has paid
the biggest price in this case.'

1164
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,668
'He has lost his son.'

1165
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:49,277
'There is a cheque for
him in this envelop.'

1166
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:57,956
'l know this amount can never
compensate him for his loss..'

1167
01:49:58,058 --> 01:50:01,152
'..but right now, l can't do
anything for him except this.'

1168
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:06,294
'Dixit, please tell him to
change the lock of his house.'

1169
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:11,368
'That lock is the root
cause of all the problems.'

1170
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,370
'l still don't trust that Aditya.'

1171
01:50:16,476 --> 01:50:20,276
'l'm sure that he was standing
out of Shalini's house that night.'

1172
01:50:22,048 --> 01:50:24,482
'lt doesn't seem strange to me
now that the circle oflife..'

1173
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:25,949
'..is always completed.'

1174
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:28,948
'The very theory with
which l would convince..'

1175
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:31,489
'..so many people
during my days of practice..

1176
01:50:32,325 --> 01:50:34,156
'..was finally
applicable to me too.'

1177
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:40,098
'A criminal always
returns to the scene of crime.'

1178
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:52,678
Kevin, why did Nilesh
mention about that painting?

1179
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,940
Shalini's father's name
was Janakraj Chauhan. - So?

1180
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:58,940
The name of Sita's father in
Ramayan was Janak too.

1181
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:01,547
Shalini was fearful.

1182
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:04,949
Sita was going to her mother.
To her motherland.

1183
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:08,084
Shalini had the fear of death.

1184
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:10,958
Since she had
spotted Nilesh in Mumbai..

1185
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:13,089
..she could see death in her eyes.

1186
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:15,700
She had started begging for pity.

1187
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:23,339
And Lord Krishna?

1188
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:27,408
Lord Krishna has many names.
Nilesh is one of them.

1189
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:36,281
You needn't have done this, Nilesh.

1190
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:37,953
No one would have come to know.

1191
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:43,556
How is Rudra?
- Good. She is happy.

1192
01:51:44,731 --> 01:51:46,426
Kevin has returned to Goa again.

1193
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,960
He had a meeting with
some alternative therapist..

1194
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:51,970
..who is doing Rudra's
treatment now.

1195
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:58,337
Kevin thinks she will walk again.
- Oh,that's wonderful.

1196
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,613
Can l do anything for you?

1197
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:11,681
There are some cases which
needs a good lawyer. So..

1198
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:19,622
All right, Nilesh.
- Thank you.

1199
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,024
You are always welcome.

1200
01:53:48,521 --> 01:53:49,545
'Shalini?'

1201
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,287
'Shalini, what happened?'

1202
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:53,620
'Aditya, didn't you leave yet?'

1203
01:53:55,261 --> 01:53:57,092
'Shalini, blood?
- lt's nothing.'

1204
01:53:57,197 --> 01:53:58,221
'You have gotan injury, Shalini.'

1205
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:01,095
'No. l slipped and
the glass pierced me.'

1206
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:04,565
'Nonsense! That Kevin
has done this, right?'

1207
01:54:05,338 --> 01:54:06,498
'Kevin has done this to you.'

1208
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:08,970
'That's it! l'm going to kill him.'

1209
01:54:09,209 --> 01:54:11,006
'l'll kill him for what he
has done to you.- What?'

1210
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:12,602
'l will kill that idiot!'

1211
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:13,940
'Go away from here.'

1212
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:15,947
'How did you dare to say this?'

1213
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:17,949
'l will kill you.
Go away from here.'
