1
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:34,891
Mother, see I have
passed in my engineering.

2
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,824
Look at this mother..

3
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:41,289
Oh my God. I am sorry,
madam. I am sorry.

4
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,524
You rich guys when you drive
you think you own the road.

5
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:49,324
Couldn't you see who
is coming in front?

6
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,395
Madam, I didn't do it on purpose.

7
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,651
And.. and the fault is yours, madam.

8
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,596
At the turning.. turning you
were crossing the road.

9
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:58,894
And I had.. I had honked, right?

10
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,893
So should I have taken my
vehicle up in the air..

11
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:02,927
..as soon as I heard your horn?

12
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,957
And would you have taken
your car from below?

13
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:07,127
Your car has brakes, right?

14
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,324
It takes time to apply brakes
on a cycle, right?

15
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,399
I am sorry. I am sorry.

16
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,383
What are you saying
sorry for everything?

17
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,651
My clothes have become dirty.
How am I going to clean it?

18
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:19,758
I had to go to the market.
How will I go like this?

19
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,715
Madam, we will do one thing.

20
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:25,347
You sit in my car. I will drop
you wherever you tell me.

21
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:32,316
Please come.
- Okay.

22
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,932
I will be in the car. You wait.

23
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:40,674
I will sit in the car. Then you
will start the car. Won't you?

24
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:44,511
Yes. - Then you will ask
me to forgive you.

25
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:48,339
I am sorry.
- Sorry. - Okay I have forgiven you.

26
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:54,567
Then you will tell me I
am so nice, so beautiful.

27
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:56,116
Then I will feel shy.

28
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:04,403
I will feel shy then you will
ask me what is your name.

29
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,547
Please ask.
- What is your name?

30
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:10,334
My name is Gloria.

31
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:15,066
Then you will stop the
car in a remote place.

32
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,838
No.. - Why are you saying,
no? First listen to me.

33
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,346
You will stop the car
in a remote place..

34
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,784
..and say Gloria, I love you.

35
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,942
No.. - It is no problem. Say
it. What does it matter?

36
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:32,341
I love you. After that you will
slowly bring your hand here.

37
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,626
No. - No, not here. - No..
- Here. No, here.

38
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,097
No.. please bring it.
- No.. - Bring it.

39
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,387
What are you doing?
- You come.

40
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,069
Then you know what I will do?

41
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,073
I will come slowly near you.

42
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,002
And then I will catch hold of
your face and give you one..

43
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,529
I don't know whose face
I saw in the morning.

44
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,208
You fool! You fool! Where are
you going? Come outside.

45
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,106
Idiot.

46
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:11,935
Where are you going? MH01-730.
Police! Police!

47
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:20,804
Ram Prasad.

48
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:24,165
Sir, I am coming with your luggage.

49
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,868
Ram Prasad, all this decoration.

50
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,931
Decoration? There was
no ration in the car.

51
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:33,266
From where should
I bring the ration?

52
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,245
I am asking you whether you
have decorated the hall.

53
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:42,631
Where Ram Prasad and where
this English decoration.

54
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,971
All this decoration
is done by madam.

55
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,829
Who is this madam?
- The one who stays here.

56
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,889
She stays here?
- Yes, she stays here.

57
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:53,359
Sir, one day senior sir
came from out of town.

58
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,017
To improve the village.

59
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,822
He opened a hospital, a school here.

60
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:01,553
He did a lot. And then
one day he fell ill.

61
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,136
He expired, the poor thing.

62
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,491
What is all this rubbish
you are telling me?

63
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,497
Listen to my whole story.

64
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:11,681
Then his daughter took the
responsibility to carry on his work.

65
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:15,016
One day the villagers
came and told me that..

66
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:19,727
..must allow this madam
to stay in your bungalow.

67
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,854
I saw the love of
the villagers and..

68
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,659
..told her pay Rs.400 and
stay in the bungalow.

69
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,823
She agreed to pay. From
then she is staying here.

70
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:29,511
What nonsense! A girl
in my bungalow?

71
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:31,570
Now she is not just a girl.
She is my sister.

72
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,393
On whose order have you
kept her here? - Sir.

73
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:35,901
I don't know anything.

74
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,829
Tell her to take her things
from here and leave.

75
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:46,167
Oh God! Ram Prasad that
girl who is coming here.

76
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:49,100
Get rid of her fast.
- Oh God!

77
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,849
Fool! I don't know from
where they come.

78
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,545
Why are you in this condition?

79
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,965
What do I tell you? 
I met a fool on the way.

80
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:00,299
He dashed my cycle.
I fell in the muck.

81
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,880
lf I see that fool then
I will break both his hands.

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,598
And send one to Uttar Pradesh
and one to Madhya Pradesh.

83
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,904
Who is that scoundrel, that fool?

84
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,357
Tell me. I will feed
him to the dogs.

85
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,029
I don't know who that fool was.

86
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,579
Madam. Madam, listen.

87
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,429
The fool spoiled all my clothes.

88
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,587
Now sit and wash your clothes,
Gloria darling.

89
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:38,137
Ram Prasad. Ram Prasad.
- Sir.

90
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,436
That girl is in my bedroom?

91
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,228
Sir, what do I know? 
She sleeps in that bedroom.

92
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:43,584
In my bedroom?
- Yes.

93
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:46,171
In my bedroom?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:48,746
lf you ask so many times,
then will I say no?

95
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:52,717
You think, sir. You don't show
me your face for 6 months.

96
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,406
I am living alone.

97
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:57,747
The wind howls. 
The walls make noises.

98
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,802
I became mad. Madam..

99
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:03,601
To hell with your madam.
Tell her to leave.

100
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:06,150
Just look at her condition, sir.

101
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,811
Some scoundrel dashed her cycle.

102
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,680
The poor girl went and
fell in the muck.

103
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:19,468
lf I see that scoundrel, sir,
I will break him into pieces..

104
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,468
..and feed it to the
eagles and crows.

105
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:22,810
Ram Prasad.

106
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,478
You! What are you doing here?

107
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:35,401
Ram Prasad, this is the same
man who had dashed my..

108
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,425
..cycle and put me
in the muck. Fool!

109
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:41,851
Oh my god!

110
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:47,614
Sir, I take back whatever
bad I said about you.

111
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,763
Forgive me, sir. I made
a mistake, sir. - Sir!

112
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:52,477
Forgive me, sir.

113
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,149
He is my master. He is the
owner of this bungalow.

114
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,668
Ram Prasad, tell her to..
- I am in a very grave situation.

115
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,065
You are my master. She is my sister.

116
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,147
You both are standing face to face.

117
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,313
You both decide.

118
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:12,088
Ram Prasad, you know that 
I am a decent person, right?

119
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:12,783
Yes, yes.

120
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:15,193
Yes, you showed your
decency on the way.

121
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:18,247
I didn't purposely dash your cycle..
- People like you..

122
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,420
See, I am not like what
you are thinking.

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,741
Then what are you?

124
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,412
See, madam. I am a decent person.

125
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,736
I am very concerned
about my dignity.

126
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:30,550
I mean I am young and you are alone.

127
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:33,993
In my bungalow and that too
if you stay in my bedroom..

128
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,548
..what will the world say?

129
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:39,597
That is why it would be better if
you find some place else to stay.

130
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:43,583
Sir, if she doesn't stay then
I will also not stay in this house.

131
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:47,350
I will come in the morning.
Cook for you and leave.

132
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,183
In the night if your leg pains,
I will massage it and leave.

133
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,077
Ram Prasad, why don't
you understand?

134
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:56,083
I don't want to understand.
You don't say anything.

135
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,762
You fool! Do whatever you want to.

136
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,344
Did you see my position?

137
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:09,897
Madam. My sir is a very
kind and nice person.

138
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,428
Ram Prasad.
- Sir, you? - Where are you going?

139
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,009
Just going for a walk.

140
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:22,209
The loneliness of the bungalow
is eating at me.

141
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,147
You go. I am coming.

142
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,609
Ram Prasad, where did
that madam of yours go?

143
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:32,524
She left, sir.
- What? Why did you allow her to go?

144
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,818
What if something happens to her?

145
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,141
Where must the poor girl have gone
alone at this time of the night?

146
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:41,761
I made a big mistake.

147
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:44,277
Sir, can I say something?
- Yes.

148
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:51,468
She said your sir is very nice.
I don't feel about anything he said.

149
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:56,443
Really?
- Sir, you know that baker, Fatides?

150
00:09:56,523 --> 00:10:00,616
Fernandes. - She has gone for
her daughter Julia's wedding.

151
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:06,280
She has gone to Julia's wedding?
- Alright.

152
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,014
That sir who has come
in the blue shirt.

153
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:29,145
We have to tease him today. Go.

154
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:35,594
Who are you?
- I am Avinash.

155
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,690
Why have you come here?
- I am looking for a girl.

156
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,907
You are searching for a girl. Why?
- No. No.

157
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,016
Please, at least listen to me.

158
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:45,974
Alright. 
Okay, we will listen to him.

159
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:47,427
Tell us what is the matter?

160
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:50,136
I didn't say I am searching
for a girl.

161
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,758
I had said that I am searching
for one girl.

162
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:54,479
I am looking for a particular woman.

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,073
Particular girl. 
You mean a special girl?

164
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,616
No, not a girl. A woman.

165
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,774
Which woman? What is her name?

166
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,589
I don't know her name. But..

167
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,283
Okay. At least you may know
what she looks like, right?

168
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:08,610
Yes.
- Tell us.

169
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,140
She is very beautiful. 
Her face is like a flower.

170
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,978
Her hair is golden. And her eyes..

171
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:31,006
Shall I tell you who the girl is?

172
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,408
Who is that girl?
- Shall I tell you?

173
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:40,342
"There is a face like a flower."

174
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:47,913
"There is a face like a flower
whose eyes are deep."

175
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:51,601
"Whose eyes are deep."

176
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:57,435
"There is a face like a flower
whose eyes are deep."

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,335
"Whose eyes are deep."

178
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:06,216
"Her lips are red. Her hair is golden."

179
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:13,868
"Whose eyes are deep.
Whose eyes are deep."

180
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,885
"There is a face like a flower."

181
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:53,009
"That beautiful girl
is mad after me."

182
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:57,239
"But friends, she is scared
of telling me."

183
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:10,380
"Quietly shying away.
Her smile will not let me live."

184
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:21,817
"There is a face like a flower."

185
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:28,829
"There is a face like a flower
whose eyes are deep."

186
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:33,148
"Whose eyes are deep."

187
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:37,802
"Her lips are red. 
Her hair is golden."

188
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:45,812
"Whose eyes are deep.
Whose eyes are deep."

189
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:50,355
"There is a face like a flower."

190
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:24,212
"I am mad about her.
She is mad about me."

191
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:28,439
"I am her target. She is my target."

192
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,750
"I am her tale. She is my story."

193
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:42,059
"If she smiles and tells me
I will give her my life."

194
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:54,139
"There is a face like a flower."

195
00:14:55,793 --> 00:15:00,802
"There is a face like a flower
whose eyes are deep."

196
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,682
"Whose eyes are deep."

197
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,622
"Her lips are red.
Her hair is golden."

198
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:17,954
"Whose eyes are deep.
Whose eyes are deep."

199
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:21,491
Stop! Come on let us dance.

200
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,777
I am sorry.
- Why?

201
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,994
Because I removed you
from your house.

202
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,360
So what? The house is yours.

203
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,028
That is true.
- Then why say sorry?

204
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,916
I am just an unwelcome visitor.

205
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,261
Then become a welcome visitor.
- Why?

206
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,516
Just like that. Think that
my heart desires it.

207
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,393
Don't listen to your heart.

208
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:12,524
These tenants are like ice-cream.
They get set.

209
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,265
Then they don't ever think
of leaving the house.

210
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:17,259
Is that so?
- Yes.

211
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:20,925
Then we will do one thing.
I will take the rent from you.

212
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,720
Actually I have two houses.
- Two?

213
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,389
You can take possession of both.
- Possession?

214
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,330
Yes, possession.

215
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:33,263
One is that house
and one.. my heart.

216
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:38,560
What are you doing?
- Catch me, catch me.

217
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,866
Look Gloria, look Gloria, 
I am telling you to stop. You..

218
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:44,591
Gone, gone! Avi, thorn.
- What happend?

219
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,652
I fooled you. I fooled you.

220
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:51,255
You, naughty girl! Wait,
I'll show you. Wait.

221
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,477
Come on. Wait. Wait.

222
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,006
No I cannot wait.

223
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:09,566
My love.
- Avi, Avi, Avi.

224
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,594
Avi, why does this happen?

225
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,860
All of a sudden you like
someone more than others.

226
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,031
You feel like talking to him.

227
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:21,390
You feel like spending
more time with him.

228
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:24,224
And feel like spending one's
life with that person.

229
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:59,860
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

230
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:05,203
"It is difficult to
live without you."

231
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:13,131
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

232
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:17,661
"I have just one desire. Be mine."

233
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:26,568
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

234
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:30,122
"It is difficult to
live without you."

235
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:39,082
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

236
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:42,699
"I have just one desire. Be mine."

237
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:12,617
"Your dreams are in my eyes.
Your name is on my lips."

238
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:19,527
"Your dreams are in my eyes.
Your name is on my lips."

239
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:26,958
"Loving you always, beloved,
is my work."

240
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,694
"Living without you now
has become difficult."

241
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:42,700
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

242
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,460
"It is difficult to
live without you."

243
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:54,802
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

244
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,328
"I have just one desire. Be mine."

245
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:43,662
"I only desire you beloved whether
it is night or day."

246
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,906
"I only desire you beloved whether
it is night or day."

247
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:58,350
"This shadow of your love
is always with me."

248
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:05,282
"Even after dying I will not
be separated from you."

249
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:13,033
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

250
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:18,391
"It is difficult to
live without you."

251
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:27,400
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

252
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,727
"I have just one desire. Be mine."

253
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:39,229
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

254
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,657
"It is difficult to live without you."

255
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:53,093
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

256
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:57,548
"I have just one desire. Be mine."

257
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:05,593
"Come, come, come, come.
Please come."

258
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:26,588
From today your name is Pooja.
- Pooja? Why?

259
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,661
Because now I will be adoring
you all my life.

260
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:32,964
But our wedding in a temple?

261
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:37,983
Yes, because I have no one else
in the world other than God.

262
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,143
And to become husband and wife..

263
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:41,494
..we have to come
to His feet, right?

264
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,381
That is why I brought you here.

265
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:45,390
And these two are our witnesses.

266
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,931
Mr. and Mrs. Ram Prasad.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,921
Bless us, God.

268
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:05,682
Okay, Ram Prasad.

269
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:08,197
I congratulate you on your marriage.
And us on our marriage.

270
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:09,580
Bye, Ram Prasad.

271
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:15,782
I love my beloved.

272
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,794
Here Pooja. This is your
house from today.

273
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,717
Avinash!
- What happened?

274
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,547
Who is this Vimal?
- Why?

275
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,974
He has written let me know
as soon as you reach.

276
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:45,690
So that I can kill you.

277
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:50,299
Vimal is my cousin brother.
- Cousin brother?

278
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,080
Yes. Cousin brother and friend.

279
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:57,462
When we were small our parents
died in a plane crash.

280
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,400
Grandpa brought us both up.

281
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,414
He is a spendthrift.

282
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:04,986
That is why grandpa passed
all the property to me.

283
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:08,064
Now I have to take on
all his expenses.

284
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,816
lf I want to I can keep him quiet.

285
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:14,012
But today he is going
to shut me up. - Why?

286
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:16,035
I will tell you just now.

287
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:19,888
Hello? - Hello. 
- Avi! Avi Avi, where are you?

288
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,111
I am here.

289
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:23,484
Where are you? At the farmhouse.
What are you doing there?

290
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,003
I found a girl, dear.
- Girl. Girl, and you. Impossible.

291
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,747
And such a beautiful girl.
Don't ask me.

292
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:36,426
Face like the moon. Red lips.
- Red lips?

293
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:38,502
Big eyes.
- Big eyes?

294
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:42,277
And such big eyes that you
feel like drowning in them.

295
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,151
From when has this coward
become a poet?

296
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:45,549
From the time I have met her.

297
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:48,708
Is she so beautiful? Then why
did you bring her with you?

298
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:55,983
She is in my eyes, in my heart,
in front of me. She is here.

299
00:24:56,802 --> 00:25:00,109
I am just telling you one
thing and disconnecting.

300
00:25:00,189 --> 00:25:01,358
Yes, tell me.

301
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:02,589
I have got married.

302
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,851
What!? You got married?
You scoundrel, you fool!

303
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,283
You got married without telling me!

304
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,770
I will give you all the
bad words of the world.

305
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,613
In Hindi, English, French,
Punjabi, Marathi and..

306
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,737
..whichever other language
I give you bad words.

307
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:17,510
I.. this marriage cannot happen.

308
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,005
Avi, have you not heard this
dialogue in Hindi films?

309
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,457
This marriage cannot happen.

310
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:23,913
Tonight I will kill you.
No, I will kill myself.

311
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,748
I will kill both of us. 
How can you do this to me, Avi?

312
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,375
I cannot believe you.

313
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:34,380
Cheers, Avi. Avi, Avi.

314
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:40,817
Avi, I know you don't drink.
But this is not champagne.

315
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:43,342
It is my happiness.

316
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:48,480
Ladies first.
- I also don't drink.

317
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:52,192
I also don't drink. I also don't
drink. I also don't drink.

318
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:57,548
Avi, you have brought a wife
like you. - Certainly.

319
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,272
I love you. Doesn't matter.
No problem.

320
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,212
I will drink for all three of us.

321
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:17,625
Cheers to my brother.
Avi, I love you.

322
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,381
Cheers.. to my bhabhi.

323
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:32,290
Avi, may I dance with my bhabhi?
- Yes, sure.

324
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,477
Bhabhi, may I?

325
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,217
There you are. Safe and sound, Avi.

326
00:26:53,793 --> 00:27:00,488
Avi, you both dance. I..
- Okay. Come.

327
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:19,154
Avi, I love you. I love you.

328
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,711
Vimal. Vimal. What happened?

329
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:39,153
I am so happy.. happy.

330
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:52,722
I am not drunk. I am not drunk.

331
00:27:54,913 --> 00:28:00,190
I am sober. I love you.
- Come on.

332
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,972
I love you.
- I love you. - I love you too.

333
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:28,216
I love.. you.
- Come on, Pooja. - Come.

334
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:30,272
Goodnight.

335
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:37,979
Avi, Avi. I love you.

336
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:47,518
I am so happy.

337
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:51,765
Avinash.
- Yes.

338
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:55,070
In our Hindi films when the
hero and heroine are..

339
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,926
.. together then hero tells the
heroine I wish the time would stop.

340
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:06,485
Here. The time didn't stop.
But the car did stop.

341
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,928
Pooja, just open the bonnet.

342
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,076
Pooja, not the trunk, bonnet.

343
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:39,780
The car has got spoilt. 
And the cabbies are on strike.

344
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:42,185
Our house is very far.
You will have to walk.

345
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:43,740
You will walk with me, won't you?

346
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,720
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

347
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:53,909
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

348
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:57,551
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

349
00:29:57,886 --> 00:30:03,112
"My beloved will walk
with you my beloved."

350
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:08,019
"Every step the shadow of my love."

351
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:13,212
"Every step the shadow of my love."

352
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:22,318
"Is now with you my beloved.
My beloved is now with you."

353
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,079
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

354
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,203
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

355
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:35,720
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

356
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:41,670
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

357
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,270
"The shadow of love
- The shadow of love."

358
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:53,289
"The shadow of love
- The shadow of love."

359
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:26,959
"Your love feels.."

360
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,156
"..deeper than the sea."

361
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:38,255
"Without you the garden.."

362
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:42,268
"..feels like a desert to me."

363
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:48,866
"If you are with me every.."

364
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:53,380
"..colour feels vibrant."

365
00:31:54,963 --> 00:32:00,172
"If you are with me every.."

366
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,386
"..colour feels vibrant."

367
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:09,771
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

368
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,403
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

369
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:20,056
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

370
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:25,782
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

371
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:59,872
"I will bind your heart.."

372
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:03,769
"..to mine in such a way."

373
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:11,106
"I will not leave your side,.."

374
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:15,401
"..beloved, for many years."

375
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,804
"I will not leave your hand.."

376
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:26,372
"..even after dying, my love."

377
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:31,814
"I will not leave your hand.."

378
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:36,821
"..even after dying, my love."

379
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:42,787
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

380
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:49,323
"Every moment the
shadow of my love."

381
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,545
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

382
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:58,337
"My beloved, will walk
with you, my beloved."

383
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:03,672
"Every step the shadow of my love."

384
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:08,352
"Every step the shadow of my love."

385
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:17,485
"Is now with you, my beloved.
My beloved, it is now with you."

386
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,154
"The shadow of love
- The shadow of love."

387
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:28,950
"The shadow of love
- The shadow of love."

388
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:34,773
"The shadow of love
- The shadow of love."

389
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,169
Is there anyone? Is there anyone?

390
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:10,738
Help!

391
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:13,236
Open, please.

392
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,886
Someone is hitting my husband. Help!

393
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:22,445
Is there anybody? 
Open, please. Please.

394
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:28,448
Someone please come. 
Someone is hitting my husband. Help!

395
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:33,581
Help! Someone come down.
Atleast someone come.

396
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,900
Help!

397
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,589
Listen. Avinash. Help, please.
- Pooja. My body?

398
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:06,936
Have I died?

399
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:10,643
Listen. Is there anyone?

400
00:36:14,562 --> 00:36:17,803
Avinash. Avinash, get up.

401
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:20,837
Is there anyone?

402
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:25,905
Avinash, Avinash, get up.

403
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:31,202
Someone listen, please.
Avinash get up, please.

404
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:32,800
Someone listen.

405
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:37,035
I can't touch her.
- Avinash, don't go.

406
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:40,370
Pooja can't see me. 
Have I become just a soul?

407
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:45,641
Avinash, don't go. Avi, Avi.
- Oh God! What has happened?

408
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:49,668
Avi, get up once. Please.
- I am a soul.

409
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,404
Avinash, what should I do?

410
00:36:54,657 --> 00:37:01,609
Someone listen.
Avi, get up. Avi.

411
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:12,472
No, not now. I can't come now.

412
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,089
Can't you see my wife is sitting
and crying on my body?

413
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:19,402
She is crying for help.

414
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:23,142
But in this city of crores is
there no one hearing her?

415
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:26,129
Avinash please get up.
- God, if you were in my place..

416
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:29,995
..would you leave her with
a dead body and go?

417
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:38,879
No, no. Till my Pooja is not
safe I will not come to you.

418
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:53,805
Pooja.
- How has all this happened?

419
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:57,703
Be brave, Pooja.
- I don't have any courage left.

420
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:01,543
Look at me. Avi was my brother.

421
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:03,110
Even I am left alone.

422
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:08,262
You can cry. 
But tears have also left me.

423
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:10,562
You had come to give Pooja
courage, brother.

424
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:13,942
lf you break down then who
will look after my Pooja?

425
00:38:14,022 --> 00:38:19,668
Sir has called you.
- I am just coming, okay?

426
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,075
Don't cry, Pooja. Don't cry.

427
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,575
I am near you. I am with you, Pooja.

428
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:44,539
Avi.

429
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:32,343
Avinash. Avinash. No.

430
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:39,135
Pooja, let him go. Pooja.
Pooja. Pooja.

431
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:44,827
Avi, Avi. - Pooja, let him
go. Pooja, let him go.

432
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:06,443
Avi, why did you leave
me and go away so far?

433
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:11,714
I can't live without you.
Avi, I want to die.

434
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:13,923
I want to die.

435
00:40:14,855 --> 00:40:20,072
What are you talking, Pooja?
Cowards ask for death.

436
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:25,451
And you are my love. 
My love cannot be such a coward.

437
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:30,463
I am absolutely lonely without you,
Avi. Absolutely lonely.

438
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:35,099
Avi. - You are not alone,
Pooja. I am with you.

439
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:39,165
I will always be with you.
Be brave, Pooja.

440
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,007
Pooja.. Pooja, what are you doing?

441
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:44,009
Listen to me, Pooja.

442
00:40:45,272 --> 00:40:47,581
God she cannot even listen to me.

443
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:50,311
Vimal. Vimal, look brother.

444
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,233
She will go mad crying.
Try and make her understand.

445
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:57,712
Pooja, you are crying again?

446
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,612
What should I do, Vimal?
What should I do?

447
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:02,982
These tears don't stop.

448
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,264
But Pooja, by crying is
Avi going to come back?

449
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:07,434
He is right.

450
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:12,237
lf that were possible then I would
have told you Pooja cry, cry.

451
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:16,310
Look, I know a woman's
life is her husband.

452
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,225
But no one can do anything
against God's wish.

453
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,985
Perhaps no one may take Avi's place.

454
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:28,645
Avi's love, his companionship
was a support.

455
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:32,581
He was a friend, a guide,
everything to me.

456
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,251
Even though I was only a cousin..

457
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:37,357
..he has given me more love
than a real brother.

458
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:40,378
Now there is no recourse
but to be brave.

459
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,870
Come. You wash your hands and
face. I will lay the food.

460
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,453
No, I am not hungry.

461
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,776
Look brother, if she doesn't
eat she will become sick.

462
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:53,095
Pooja, if you smile, be happy..

463
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:55,654
..then Avi's soul will
rest in peace, right?

464
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:56,814
Certainly.

465
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,979
Come, Pooja. Get up. 
Go wash your hands and face.

466
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,177
See what I have brought. See.

467
00:42:02,024 --> 00:42:08,356
Come on, Pooja. Come.

468
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:20,381
Thanks, Vimal. You are dearer
than a real brother.

469
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:25,987
You made Pooja understand.
I love you.

470
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:50,888
Darling, oh my darling. You sit.
I will open the door.

471
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:56,242
Oh my darling.

472
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:01,137
lf I knew you drink so much 
I wouldn't have looked at your face.

473
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:04,687
But what do I do now? 
Now I am bound by your love.

474
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:07,546
Love.. thread.. love..

475
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,645
Let me bind you with my love.

476
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,377
Don't touch me. I hate drunkards.

477
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:15,763
I have nothing to do with you.

478
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,409
Wait. All this was just a drama.

479
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:20,509
I have never drunk till today.

480
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:24,577
Drama? You were fooling with me?

481
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:26,998
You are playing with my feelings,
my emotions?

482
00:43:27,078 --> 00:43:30,974
Am I joke for you? 
I hate you. I hate you.

483
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:32,928
I have no relation to you.

484
00:43:33,008 --> 00:43:36,278
We both are very closely related.

485
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,453
What? - You are my love,
my heartbeat, my desire.

486
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:31,670
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

487
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:41,437
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

488
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:46,737
"I can't tell you the
condition of my heart."

489
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:51,447
"I also cannot live
without you now."

490
00:44:51,816 --> 00:45:01,282
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

491
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:06,478
"I can't tell you the
condition of my heart."

492
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:11,283
"I also cannot live
without you now."

493
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:16,210
"You are my love, my heartbeat,.."

494
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:21,559
"..my desire, my life."

495
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:52,413
"My youth is for you."

496
00:45:57,726 --> 00:46:02,144
"My youth is for you."

497
00:46:02,714 --> 00:46:07,588
"For you is this life of mine."

498
00:46:07,668 --> 00:46:12,254
"When I see you, my mind wanders."

499
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:17,118
"When I touch you, my
body gets a fragrance."

500
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:21,985
"You are my beloved."

501
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:31,425
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

502
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:36,581
"I can't tell you the
condition of my heart."

503
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:41,917
"I also cannot live without you now."

504
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:51,485
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

505
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:36,640
"There is heat in your breath."

506
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:46,454
"There is heat in your breath."

507
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:51,386
"Your lips are soft."

508
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:56,446
"Taking you in my embrace."

509
00:47:56,834 --> 00:48:01,571
"My restlessness goes after
being in your arms."

510
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,219
"My heart cannot do without you."

511
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:16,322
"You are my love, my heartbeat,
my desire, my life."

512
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:20,817
"I can't tell you the
condition of my heart."

513
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:25,787
"I also cannot live
without you now."

514
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:30,787
"You are my love, my heartbeat,.."

515
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:35,981
"..my desire, my life."

516
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:41,086
"You are my love.
- My heartbeat"

517
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:46,092
"My desire.
- My life."

518
00:49:04,602 --> 00:49:07,100
You! I will not leave you alive.

519
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,867
After killing me you have come to
kill my Pooja. Scoundrel, go.

520
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,171
Go, go. Go.

521
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:18,632
Pooja, get up. Get up.
That killer has come.

522
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:20,800
The same killer who murdered me.

523
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:23,137
Now he has come for you.
Pooja, get up.

524
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:41,527
Caesar, Caesar. Caesar.
Jump, Caesar.

525
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,167
Caesar, Caesar, jump. Jump, Caesar.

526
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:48,360
Caesar, jump. Jump. Caesar,
jump. Come on.

527
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,642
Caesar, jump. Come on, Caesar.

528
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:44,834
My name is Raghav. 
This is my locality. Go back.

529
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,536
You.. you can see me?
You can touch me?

530
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:52,771
Are.. are you also a soul?
- Yes, I am a soul. Go away.

531
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,460
But I am following my killer, 
Mr. Raghav.

532
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,727
You spoke again. I said go away.

533
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:59,135
No, I am following him.

534
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,076
She looks very good.

535
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:03,592
You scoundrel! If you touch
my Pooja, I will kill you.

536
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:22,648
Om Shanti Shanti.

537
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:29,142
Do you have faith in our power?

538
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:31,460
Faith? Full faith.

539
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,915
That is why I brought
a Rs.100 note..

540
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:36,372
..and have to come to meet 
Ms. Maya the 2nd time, right?

541
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:39,500
Your name is as beautiful as you.

542
00:52:41,098 --> 00:52:42,250
What do you want to say?

543
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,820
On top of that business
also is down nowadays.

544
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,831
And my wife pushed me out
of my life and went.

545
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:55,667
And I am getting very angry at her.

546
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:58,493
I don't know in which bank she
has kept the money and gone.

547
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:00,493
How much is the bank's interest? 2%.

548
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:03,542
lf she would have given me I would
have invested it in films.

549
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,559
Would have got 3.5% interest.
2, 4, 5, 5, 10.

550
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,569
Ten lakhs would have accumulated.
- Ten lakhs!?

551
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:14,204
The way to the river is very tough.

552
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:17,113
How should I fill the
pot from the Jamuna?

553
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,617
Fill the pot with hundreds.

554
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,460
Otherwise you will remain
empty handed.

555
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,599
Your wife's life is stuck mid-way.

556
00:53:23,288 --> 00:53:25,489
Take this Rs.15.
- She is fooling you.

557
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:29,468
What did you say? I am fooling you?
- She can hear me.

558
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:36,335
Come, come. Your love
is calling you. Come.

559
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:41,798
P.D. Shroff is eagerly waiting
to meet you. Come, come.

560
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:49,654
Foul wind is blowing.
- Foul?

561
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:53,432
The winds of hell.
Your wife is in hell.

562
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,477
Last time she was in heaven.

563
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:59,027
Because of your sins she has
been transferred to hell.

564
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:01,776
Don't talk in between
or she will go back.

565
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:04,617
The matter is of ten lakhs.

566
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:07,098
There are lots of them in my account.

567
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:10,598
Lightning is striking.

568
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:14,029
The frogs are croaking
in the gutter.

569
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:18,359
Butcher is breaking the bones
of human beings with his teeth.

570
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:23,860
What is that?
- A lute.

571
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,860
Snakes and serpents are
hanging upside down..

572
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,701
..on the electric pole and hissing.

573
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,171
There are electric
poles even up there?

574
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:30,314
These are modern times.

575
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:32,038
Then Lilavati's door opens.

576
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,762
The lightning is striking.

577
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:38,301
Snakes and serpents are hissing.

578
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:43,175
Frogs are croaking.
Butcher is biting the bones.

579
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:44,160
There are shackles on her hands..

580
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,589
..flame in her hair..
- Enough. I am getting scared.

581
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,966
Do one thing. 
Transfer her to heaven.

582
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:53,257
It is Rs. 250 for transfer.
- She is openly fooling you.

583
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:59,115
Who spoke?
- I am Avinash's soul.

584
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:04,393
Soul! Soul! How did he get in? Mad.

585
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:07,456
Look, you can hear my voice.

586
00:55:07,694 --> 00:55:09,162
You will have to do
something for me.

587
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:12,443
Look, I don't want to do any work.
Go away from here. Go.

588
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:15,928
lf you don't do my work.
I will not stop following you.

589
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,248
I beg and fall at your feet.
I don't want to do any work.

590
00:55:20,328 --> 00:55:22,036
Go away. Help! Help!

591
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:23,965
I will not stop following you.

592
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:34,536
I am a disco dancer. 
I am a disco.. - Stop! Stop!

593
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:38,362
Stop this rubbish! What do you want?

594
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:44,477
Maya, the man who had killed me
had come to kill my wife today.

595
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:51,647
Kill. Murder. This is a murder case.

596
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:54,488
What are you doing here?
Go to the police.

597
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:59,573
Maya, please. Maya, you call my
wife and tell her to be cautious.

598
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:01,896
That killer can kill her any moment.

599
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,333
But why would your
wife listen to me?

600
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:06,542
Tell her that Avinash has told you.

601
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:13,799
What is your number?
- 6460602.

602
00:56:15,893 --> 00:56:17,758
What is your wife's name?
- Pooja.

603
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:20,308
Your name?
- Avinash Saxena.

604
00:56:20,388 --> 00:56:23,334
Hello?
- Hello. Are you Mrs. Avinash Saxena?

605
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:27,267
Who are you? - I am the medium
between life and death.

606
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:30,153
That means I make the
souls talk to humans.

607
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:34,675
Whoever you are I don't
want to talk to you.

608
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:37,270
I too don't want to talk to you.

609
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,928
But your husband is
sitting on my head.

610
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:43,743
Mr. Avinash Saxena, whose
soul has not yet reached..

611
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:48,662
..heaven has made his
residence in my house.

612
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,941
And he wants to tell you..
- Shut up!

613
00:56:54,337 --> 00:56:57,461
Oh God! Oh God!
- What happened?

614
00:56:58,376 --> 00:57:01,726
Your wife has told me..
me to shut up.

615
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:05,474
Till today no one has dared
to tell Maya to shut up.

616
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:08,167
See I am saying sorry
on her behalf. Please!

617
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,792
You go away from here, please.

618
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,783
Listen she must have not believed
you on the phone.

619
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:17,641
You will have to come
with me to her.

620
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:23,053
I won't go. - Maya. - I won't go.
I won't go. - Maya, please.

621
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,109
I told you I will not go.
And I am not your servant.

622
00:57:27,189 --> 00:57:28,755
Go away from here.
I am feeling sleepy.

623
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:35,133
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

624
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:36,902
See if you don't come with me..

625
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:38,654
..I will count till 100 crores.

626
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:40,863
And if you still don't come then I..

627
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,993
I will not go. 
I will not go. I will not go.

628
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:45,793
100, 200, 300, 400..

629
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:50,130
How can I thank you enough?

630
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,135
With the same mouth with which you..

631
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,235
..troubled me the whole night.

632
00:57:53,315 --> 00:57:55,039
I am sorry I didn't do anything
the whole night.

633
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,098
Is there a chance tonight?
- Shut up!

634
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:01,585
Why were you murdered?
- Murder? - I don't know.

635
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:03,068
That's strange. You were murdered..

636
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,532
..and you don't know.
- What is the matter, madam?

637
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:07,279
Brother, this is between us.
You will not understand. Go.

638
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,374
I understood.
- What? - You are mad.

639
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:13,429
Did you hear that 
Mr. Avinash Saxena?

640
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:15,612
From now on, you will not
say a single word to me.

641
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,102
Everyone is thinking I am mad.
- Okay.

642
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,468
I have met different
souls in my life.

643
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:25,502
But I have not seen a soul that
sticks like a leech like you.

644
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,768
You are in the pain of love
and the problem is for me.

645
00:58:28,848 --> 00:58:30,244
This time you have met me.

646
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:32,483
After this, if you meet
me then just see.

647
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:35,209
Why are you quiet? 
Why don't you say something?

648
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:36,903
What can I do but stay quiet?

649
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:39,419
Yes, your work is being done, right?

650
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:43,082
The bell is in front.
- I know and I will ring it.

651
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,583
Don't give me orders from now on. 
Understand?

652
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:55,236
Are you Pooja?
- Yes.

653
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:57,676
I am Maya. 
I had called you last night.

654
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:58,773
You had called?

655
00:58:58,853 --> 00:59:01,236
I don't want to talk to you.
- Hold on.

656
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:03,075
Listen to me. I have something
important to tell you.

657
00:59:03,155 --> 00:59:05,507
I told you Avinash is
no more in this world.

658
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:07,676
Madam, Avinash is in this world.

659
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,930
And he wants to tell something
important to you.

660
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,603
I mean he wants to give you an
important message. - Shut up!

661
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:18,002
Oh God! Oh God! Did you see
the result of pitying you?

662
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:22,576
Your wife.. your wife shut
the door on my face.

663
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:28,324
She insulted my dignity.
Now why are you quiet?

664
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:31,607
Yes, you will be quiet taking
your wife's side, aren't you?

665
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,480
You be with your wife. I am going.

666
00:59:34,703 --> 00:59:36,743
Maya, Maya, please listen to me.

667
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,668
I don't want to listen
to anything you say.

668
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:41,371
Maya, on first meeting how
Pooja can believe you?

669
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:42,937
lf she doesn't, she can go to hell.

670
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:45,002
Maya, I will tell you
something that..

671
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,208
..was only between Pooja and me.

672
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:51,426
No one other than us knows
about this. - What?

673
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:53,649
Maya, she has a spot here. Here.

674
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:58,152
What are you saying here
and there? Can I see you?

675
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,213
Now how do I make you understand?

676
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,251
Yes, look. Your top button.

677
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:06,751
This first button.
- No, below that.

678
01:00:07,427 --> 01:00:09,988
This one.
- No, no. Even below that.

679
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:13,568
This.. tell straight away that
it is the 3rd button. And then?

680
01:00:13,648 --> 01:00:18,997
On the left. - Left? 
- Yes, there is a spot there. Up.

681
01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:22,168
Here?
- No, a little below. - Here?

682
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:28,420
No, a little more below.
- Here.. yes, I understood.

683
01:00:29,153 --> 01:00:32,084
What are you all doing here? Go, go.

684
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:34,169
This man who is standing behind me..

685
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:36,774
..is trying to tell me where
his wife's spot is.

686
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,117
Go from here.

687
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:43,474
Such a strange place to find a spot.

688
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:47,960
When we went for a honeymoon
I had told her..

689
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,805
..all the world's beauty
was in that spot.

690
01:00:52,755 --> 01:00:54,840
The distance between the spot
and heart is only that..

691
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:56,582
..much as the distance between us.

692
01:00:57,304 --> 01:00:58,870
And I had kissed the spot.

693
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:03,946
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja. Pooja.

694
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,340
Pooja! The spot which is at
the wrong place..

695
01:01:10,525 --> 01:01:12,803
I mean which is somewhere here.

696
01:01:12,883 --> 01:01:13,945
Which your husband had kissed..

697
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:15,196
..during your honeymoon.

698
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:18,284
And he had said that.. 
what did you say tell me fast.

699
01:01:18,364 --> 01:01:19,701
The distance between the spot
and heart is only that..

700
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:21,935
..much as the distance between us.
- Yes, the distance between.

701
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,591
..the spot and heart is only that
much as the distance between us.

702
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:27,276
I mean between Avinash
and you, isn't it?

703
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,208
And after that I had
recited this poem.

704
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:35,335
From the time I have
seen this spot..

705
01:01:36,118 --> 01:01:37,950
..I feel like living more.

706
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,135
And then I had recited
a poem to you.

707
01:01:40,215 --> 01:01:43,052
I mean Avinash had recited
a poem for you.

708
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,616
From the time I have
seen this spot..

709
01:01:45,696 --> 01:01:48,549
From the time I have
seen this spot..

710
01:01:48,937 --> 01:01:51,049
What was after that?
- I feel like living more.

711
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:53,135
Yes, I feel like living more.

712
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:55,435
Very good. - Very good.
Very good. - What a poem!

713
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:57,574
Very good.
- What else?

714
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:03,211
You tell her that if she
doesn't meet you..

715
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:05,828
..then I will tell you
many such things.

716
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:06,717
Please don't tell me.

717
01:02:06,797 --> 01:02:08,590
Even if you are not worried
about your dignity..

718
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,168
..I am concerned about my dignity.

719
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:12,506
Maya, please. For the last time.

720
01:02:12,586 --> 01:02:16,579
Look, Pooja.
If you don't agree to meet us.

721
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:19,007
Then Avinash will tell
me more secrets.

722
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:22,201
And I will have to tell you all
that in front of all these people.

723
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:26,855
Your bedroom talk will become
very common on the streets.

724
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:30,226
Shall I say? Shall I say?

725
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:32,920
Now I will say, you see.

726
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:39,283
She has not come. 
My throat has dried up shouting.

727
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,772
But your Juliet has not come down.

728
01:02:53,316 --> 01:02:56,606
Hello? - Hello, I am Pooja.
- Yes, tell me Pooja.

729
01:02:56,843 --> 01:03:00,557
Vimal, can you come here for
10 minutes? - Now? - Now.

730
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:03,150
Pooja, right now I am a little busy.

731
01:03:03,434 --> 01:03:05,489
Why don't you do one thing?
Can you come here?

732
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,528
Okay, I will come.

733
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:14,144
Vimal.
- Pooja.

734
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:17,217
I want to tell you something
important. - Come sit.

735
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,815
Even I am here, Vimal.

736
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:22,149
Pooja, why are you looking so tense?

737
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,751
lf you hear it, 
even you will become tense.

738
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:28,388
I don't get tense so easily, Pooja.

739
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:31,543
lf you listen to her then you
will also become tense, Vimal.

740
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:34,592
lf I tell you that I have met
Avinash, then? - Now say.

741
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:42,626
I meet our Avi everyday, Pooja.

742
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,870
There has not been a single night..

743
01:03:45,213 --> 01:03:47,042
..when he has not come in my dreams.

744
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:50,492
Don't love a dead brother so much.

745
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:53,000
I am not talking about dreams, Vimal. 
- What?

746
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,349
See, now even you are
tense, aren't you?

747
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,645
Last night I met a woman.

748
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:00,726
She told me that she has
contacted Avinash's soul.

749
01:04:00,806 --> 01:04:03,480
Impossible!
- She is right, Vimal.

750
01:04:03,946 --> 01:04:05,239
I had gone with that lady.

751
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:06,734
Listen to me, Vimal.

752
01:04:06,937 --> 01:04:10,271
She really made me believe that
Avinash' soul is with her.

753
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:12,585
Pooja, if Avinash's
soul it will come..

754
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:13,781
..to me because I am his brother.

755
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:17,536
Or it will come to you because
you are his.. I am sorry.

756
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:19,824
But why would he go to that fraud?

757
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:23,782
But Avinash was with her.
- Really, how do you know?

758
01:04:24,002 --> 01:04:25,515
Because she told me something..

759
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,155
..that only I and Avinash knew.

760
01:04:28,235 --> 01:04:30,530
Oh come on, Pooja. This is a racket.

761
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:33,002
Look, you are a sensible woman.

762
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:35,923
Pooja, don't forget that after Avi..

763
01:04:36,003 --> 01:04:37,578
..you are going to be a rich lady.

764
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:39,417
And to cheat you people
will tell you anything.

765
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:42,655
And that lady must have done a
lot of enquiry and come to you.

766
01:04:42,972 --> 01:04:45,954
Anyway, who is that lady?
- I don't know.

767
01:04:46,746 --> 01:04:49,657
lf she tries to meet you
again, then call me.

768
01:04:49,737 --> 01:04:51,866
And look. There is no need to worry.

769
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:54,259
Neither your life is
in danger nor mine.

770
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:58,148
You go home and rest. Relax.

771
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:01,825
Oh God! Vimal, listen to me.
Her life is truly in danger.

772
01:05:01,905 --> 01:05:04,676
I had seen the killer coming in
search of her to the house.

773
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:09,842
Vimal, Vimal, listen to me. Vimal.

774
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:16,545
Look Mr. Avinash, 
this is not my problem.

775
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,079
It is my problem. But you
only have to solve it.

776
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:21,542
Because only you can hear me..
- Only you can hear, right?

777
01:05:21,622 --> 01:05:23,152
I will still not go.

778
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:30,541
Which music director's song
would you like to hear?

779
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:35,086
Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad,
Kalyan-ji Anand-ji.

780
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:39,394
Bappi Lahiri, Nadeem Shravan,
Ghulam Ali?

781
01:05:39,474 --> 01:05:43,879
Please I hate songs.
Don't sing for me.

782
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:51,896
I am a disco dancer.

783
01:05:56,555 --> 01:06:00,796
Yahoo! Yahoo!

784
01:06:11,495 --> 01:06:15,155
Maya, please. Tell Pooja
not to be sad like this.

785
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:17,971
She doesn't look good
in these black clothes.

786
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:20,276
Tell her to wear nice clothes.

787
01:06:21,534 --> 01:06:23,749
Listen, your husband says that..

788
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:25,589
..you don't look nice
in these black clothes.

789
01:06:25,669 --> 01:06:27,868
Wear some nice clothes.

790
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:29,946
And yes. Also don't
be sad like this.

791
01:06:30,462 --> 01:06:31,552
You have come again.

792
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,924
What do you think that
I am happy coming here?

793
01:06:35,153 --> 01:06:38,985
But this husband of yours
does not leave my side.

794
01:06:39,255 --> 01:06:41,242
He has forced me to come here and..

795
01:06:41,322 --> 01:06:43,508
..give you his killer's address.

796
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:48,283
I don't know whether I should
believe in you or not.

797
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:51,849
Vimal says you are a fraud.

798
01:06:52,616 --> 01:06:57,436
Fraud!? I am a fraud? Which
fool has called me a fraud?

799
01:06:57,516 --> 01:07:00,585
I will cut his legs and
hang it in the skies.

800
01:07:01,016 --> 01:07:02,742
Did you hear that? 
Did you hear that, Avinash?

801
01:07:02,822 --> 01:07:06,884
Doing your work I have got one
more degree. Of a fraud.

802
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:08,653
Maya, please.
- You keep quiet!

803
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:11,476
Look Madam, if I were
a fraud then how much..

804
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:14,816
..money have I taken from you
till now? Tell me. Tell me.

805
01:07:15,048 --> 01:07:18,808
The taxi fare upto here
Rs.37.75 paise.

806
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:20,398
I have paid from my pocket.

807
01:07:20,478 --> 01:07:23,055
Rs.37.75 paise is
not a small amount.

808
01:07:23,135 --> 01:07:26,242
I charge for even contacting souls.
Money, money.

809
01:07:26,322 --> 01:07:29,766
To hell with your killer
and his address.

810
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,466
I am going. Oh God! Oh God!

811
01:07:32,546 --> 01:07:36,351
Maya. Maya, don't worry.
I will pay all your money.

812
01:07:37,727 --> 01:07:39,179
You will pay me!

813
01:07:39,885 --> 01:07:43,370
For that I will have to either
die or get myself murdered.

814
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,367
Maya, please.
- You keep quiet, or else..

815
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:46,976
What I am going to tell you now..

816
01:07:47,056 --> 01:07:49,917
..will make Pooja believe
you in completely. Please.

817
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:51,485
Tell me.

818
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:53,216
The day she had gone
to Vimal's house.

819
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:56,175
Vimal had told her that
if my soul comes..

820
01:07:56,255 --> 01:07:58,849
..it will come to him because
he is my brother.

821
01:07:59,645 --> 01:08:03,249
Or to Pooja because she is my wife.
Not to a fraud like you.

822
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:07,108
The day you had gone
to Vimal's house..

823
01:08:07,188 --> 01:08:09,675
..he had told you that if
Avinash's soul comes..

824
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,927
..it will come to Vimal because
Vimal is his brother.

825
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:15,085
Or to you because you are his
wife or his widow or whatever.

826
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:17,187
Why would it come to me? I am..
I am.. I am a fraud, right?

827
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:21,542
How did you know this?
- Because I was there with you.

828
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:23,152
Because Avinash was there with you.

829
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,840
I cannot understand anything.

830
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,964
Maya, you only note the killer's
address and give it to Pooja.

831
01:08:31,188 --> 01:08:33,208
Why should I note it?
Am I your secretary?

832
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:36,163
And who gave you the right
to order me? Fool!

833
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:38,413
Maya, Maya, please.
- Say sorry.

834
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:41,115
I am sorry. I am begging.

835
01:08:41,804 --> 01:08:44,308
You are saying sorry
I can hear that.

836
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:47,118
But you are begging,
how can I see that?

837
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,246
Anyway, give me his address.

838
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:53,121
House No.9, Koliwada.
- Just a minute wait. Say it again.

839
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:55,951
House No.9, Koliwada.

840
01:09:00,332 --> 01:09:02,408
This is your Avinash's
killer's address.

841
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:07,080
And tell her to tell Vimal and hand
over the killer to the police.

842
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:09,646
Tell Vimal to hand over
the killer to the police.

843
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:11,587
I am leaving, okay? I am going.

844
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,812
You can't say thank you.
Atleast give me my fees.

845
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:16,396
Okay don't give the fees.
Just say thank you.

846
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,689
No, if you don't want to say
thank you then I.. - Pooja!

847
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:21,349
Maya, call the doctor.

848
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:39,173
Congratulations, Pooja. You
are going to be a mother.

849
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,590
What happened, Pooja?
Don't cry, Pooja.

850
01:09:57,023 --> 01:10:00,216
This is good news. 
We will give the child a nice name.

851
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:04,617
lf it is a girl, then Shraddha.
And if it is a boy..

852
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:12,582
Pooja, why are you crying?
This is good news.

853
01:10:13,378 --> 01:10:15,055
That is what I am also
saying, doctor.

854
01:10:16,352 --> 01:10:20,719
No, doctor. Can there be
anything more unlucky?

855
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,455
I am going to be the mother
of Avinash's child.

856
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:27,319
And he is only not with me.

857
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:30,255
No, Pooja. I am near you.

858
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:37,755
But Pooja, this is life.
And a child is a child.

859
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:43,020
lf you.. I mean If you cannot
bring up the child..

860
01:10:43,469 --> 01:10:45,489
..then you can give
it up for adoption.

861
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,138
Abortion is of course
another way out.

862
01:10:47,218 --> 01:10:51,686
No, doctor. This child is
a gift from my Avinash.

863
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:55,215
I will give birth to this child.

864
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:57,322
I will bring it up.

865
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:00,682
I will give it so much love that..

866
01:11:01,098 --> 01:11:03,975
..a mother and father
both would give.

867
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:07,991
That's the spirit! 
Oh, I have become a father.

868
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:11,422
Thank you.
- I have become a father. Be careful.

869
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:19,388
Are you blind? Can't you see?

870
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:22,241
Pooja, you should
also look and walk.

871
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:24,313
You are going to become a mother.

872
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:27,835
lf you were hurt then what
would happen to the child?

873
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:29,787
Be careful and walk, Pooja.

874
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,184
There is only this child that
is the gift of our love.

875
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:38,085
Take care, Pooja. Pooja. I
love you, Pooja. Take care.

876
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:11,475
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

877
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:20,855
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

878
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:26,987
"It is my bad luck, my love.."

879
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:31,578
"..I could not get your love."

880
01:12:31,658 --> 01:12:40,700
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

881
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:50,738
"It is my bad luck, my love.
I could not get your love."

882
01:12:51,389 --> 01:13:00,626
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

883
01:13:01,115 --> 01:13:06,340
"From your friendship I have.."

884
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,529
"..got one gift of love."

885
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:43,325
"I am not there but my
shadow is with you."

886
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:53,410
"In your arms my love, is my gift."

887
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:58,811
"I am eager to meet you now.."

888
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:03,720
"..every minute, my love."

889
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:09,246
"From your friendship I have.."

890
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:13,397
"..got one gift of love."

891
01:14:13,477 --> 01:14:22,415
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

892
01:14:47,297 --> 01:14:55,828
"It feels like a jungle of
thorns this world to me."

893
01:14:56,869 --> 01:15:01,706
"You are in my thoughts."

894
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:05,675
"How can I forget you?"

895
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:15,669
"I cannot live my life
without you, my love."

896
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:25,488
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

897
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:34,858
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

898
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:40,806
"It is my bad luck, my love."

899
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:45,407
"I could not get your love."

900
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:54,158
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

901
01:15:55,208 --> 01:16:04,366
"From your friendship I have
got one gift of love."

902
01:16:04,446 --> 01:16:09,063
"One gift of love."

903
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:14,264
"Yes, one gift of love."

904
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:17,975
But Pooja I had told you that
the woman is a fraud.

905
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:19,410
Don't get involved with her.

906
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:23,394
Anyway, when she had come then..

907
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:24,934
..why didn't you phone me?

908
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:26,799
That woman could be a fraud, Vimal.

909
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:28,928
But she will not cheat Pooja.

910
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:33,653
She has told me about the
killer of Avinash. - What?

911
01:16:35,094 --> 01:16:38,623
She was saying that the killer
had come to my home to kill me.

912
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:43,673
But Avinash followed the killer
and found about him.

913
01:16:43,753 --> 01:16:44,632
Ok, give me the details.

914
01:16:44,712 --> 01:16:46,019
I will go to the police
station and come.

915
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:04,047
But how will the case be proved
with soul's witness?

916
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,931
But I have seen him, Vimal.

917
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:09,415
I can identify him in the
line up if he is arrested.

918
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:12,326
Pooja, I will go to the police
station and come back. Ok?

919
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:13,804
Even I am going.

920
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:21,687
Once that Robert is arrested,
then my Pooja will be safe.

921
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:26,851
Vimal, this is the police station.

922
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:32,217
Vimal, why are you going ahead?

923
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:35,666
Vimal, the police station
is left behind. Vimal!

924
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:38,966
Vimal, where are you going?

925
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:41,094
But here the killer stays, Vimal.

926
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:55,780
Vimal, Robert stays here.
What do you wish to do?

927
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:57,954
Listen to me, my brother.
Don't be emotional.

928
01:17:58,198 --> 01:17:59,780
I know how much you like me.

929
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,123
Don't do anything rash.

930
01:18:01,203 --> 01:18:03,151
You don't know this killer
is a very dangerous man.

931
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:04,181
He has killed me.

932
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:06,072
Vimal, come let's go back. Vimal!

933
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:11,780
Robert! I had stopped you
from going out of here..

934
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:15,609
..till the matter of Avinash
is cooled down.

935
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:20,290
You Mr. Vimal! I am not used
to listening in high tone.

936
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,528
Understand?

937
01:18:21,608 --> 01:18:24,230
Talk in a lower tone.
What is the matter?

938
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,875
A woman had come to Pooja.

939
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:28,111
And she gave your address..

940
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:30,362
..and said this is the address
of Avinash's killer.

941
01:18:30,442 --> 01:18:31,101
What?

942
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,362
Thank God that Pooja
gave me that address.

943
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:35,297
If she had given to someone else..

944
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,368
..then he would put you in the
police station straight away.

945
01:18:38,456 --> 01:18:39,875
And you would be in jail now!

946
01:18:43,841 --> 01:18:45,891
How did she get my address?

947
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:46,903
How did she get.

948
01:18:46,983 --> 01:18:48,537
You are never in your senses.

949
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,031
You must have drunk liquor
last night at some den..

950
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:53,256
..and boasted about your
bravery to some woman.

951
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:55,370
What else? - I never went
to any den, understood?

952
01:18:55,896 --> 01:18:58,034
You told me to kill Avinash.

953
01:19:01,016 --> 01:19:02,537
I have done your work.

954
01:19:04,298 --> 01:19:06,200
You had given me 50,000 rupees..

955
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:08,869
..give me the rest 50,000,
then I will go away from here.

956
01:19:10,836 --> 01:19:12,599
When I will get the money,
I will give you then.

957
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:15,033
But when?
- In a few days.

958
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:20,304
When I get my hands on the
property of Avinash. Then!

959
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,080
Pooja, you don't know
these policemen.

960
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:27,128
They unnecessarily try
to confuse matters.

961
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:29,724
That Superintendent of Police.

962
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:32,495
He says I tell the soul to come
personally to lodge the FIR.

963
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:34,304
Then I went to the Police
commissioner.

964
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:36,121
Even he was laughing at me.

965
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:38,134
He was saying that Mr. Vimal sir..

966
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:40,053
..how did you get involved
in this matter of souls?

967
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:42,128
And then he said, if the police
get hold of a soul..

968
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:44,953
..then all their murder cases
would be solved easily.

969
01:19:45,191 --> 01:19:49,079
Anyway. I told him
to arrest that man.

970
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,635
Pooja will identify him.
She will testify.

971
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:55,644
But, no one took me seriously.

972
01:19:56,539 --> 01:19:58,598
It means that no report was written?

973
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,483
Pooja, can I get a cup of tea?

974
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,639
You sit, I will get it.
- Thank you, Pooja.

975
01:20:07,027 --> 01:20:09,295
Pooja, he is a liar.
He is speaking lies.

976
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:10,467
Forget police commissioner..

977
01:20:10,547 --> 01:20:11,760
..he did not even go to
the police station.

978
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,691
He got me killed, and now he is
planning to get you killed.

979
01:20:14,938 --> 01:20:16,759
Pooja. Listen to me, Pooja.

980
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:18,404
Pooja.

981
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,228
Why are you speaking lies,
Vimal? Accept even now.

982
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:34,758
That you had not gone to
the police commissioner.

983
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:38,858
Say! What did you get
from this drama?

984
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:41,524
Why are you after my Pooja?

985
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:45,387
What is her fault? What
harm did she do to you?

986
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:48,000
What did you get from
getting her widowed?

987
01:20:48,554 --> 01:20:52,257
Man, there was no dearth in my love.

988
01:20:52,732 --> 01:20:54,395
Why are you punishing us?

989
01:20:55,469 --> 01:20:59,066
My mistake is that I loved
you as a blood brother.

990
01:21:00,816 --> 01:21:03,235
I trusted you more than myself.

991
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:05,717
And you betrayed that trust!

992
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:15,409
Pooja, you forget your past life.

993
01:21:16,451 --> 01:21:21,018
Forget that Avi had ever
come into your life.

994
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:28,627
Leave Pooja's hand, you scoundrel.

995
01:21:28,707 --> 01:21:31,089
Pooja, you start your life again.

996
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:35,381
You are not alone in this
world, I am with you.

997
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,975
Did your husband have a
habit of talking? Forget.

998
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:48,629
I have called his soul.

999
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:51,771
Listen he is coming.

1000
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:57,463
Stop talking! Now you talk
one-by-one. One-by-one.

1001
01:21:59,302 --> 01:22:01,395
I need to talk to my husband.

1002
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:03,500
Put 50 rupees here. 50 rupees.

1003
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:05,697
Take this 50 rupees.

1004
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:07,985
Ask my son-in-law..

1005
01:22:08,065 --> 01:22:13,703
..where has he kept the
papers of my Udupi hotel?

1006
01:22:13,783 --> 01:22:18,779
Ask him. - In which bank has
he kept my ornaments? Ask.

1007
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:22,094
He was supposed to gift me
a diamond necklace on my..

1008
01:22:22,174 --> 01:22:25,016
..birthday, he told me at noon..

1009
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:28,440
..but died in the evening.
Where has he kept it, ask!

1010
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:32,678
See brother, these
people are selfish.

1011
01:22:32,758 --> 01:22:35,204
They are asking only about money.

1012
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:36,928
Money. Only money, money.

1013
01:22:37,263 --> 01:22:38,942
I will not give to her mother, her..

1014
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:45,074
..father, her whole family
a single penny.

1015
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:47,592
Deven says he will not give
you a single penny.

1016
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,564
What? He cannot do that.

1017
01:22:49,644 --> 01:22:53,961
What do we do now?
Get up, let's go from here.

1018
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,791
Don't say like that.

1019
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,673
You are greedy of the first order.

1020
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:00,533
You are greedy of the first order.

1021
01:23:00,613 --> 01:23:01,879
What?

1022
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,834
I am not saying it, your
husband's spirit saying.

1023
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:08,261
Ms. Maya, she is very cunning.

1024
01:23:08,341 --> 01:23:10,928
The moment my eyes closed,
and my soul lifted up..

1025
01:23:11,008 --> 01:23:16,026
..down she was with Iyer,
I know everything.

1026
01:23:16,106 --> 01:23:17,876
But since I cannot
do anything alone..

1027
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:22,683
..I brought my brother and
assistant with me, ask her.

1028
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:27,195
Yes, ask her.

1029
01:23:27,275 --> 01:23:31,261
Stop.
- Who is here?

1030
01:23:31,624 --> 01:23:33,523
Maya.
- Who is it?

1031
01:23:33,603 --> 01:23:34,818
Avinash.

1032
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:38,118
You came back again?
Go away from here.

1033
01:23:39,367 --> 01:23:40,775
But we have paid to come here.

1034
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:43,028
No, no. Not you people,
you people sit here.

1035
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:44,743
Maya, please listen to me.

1036
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,028
I don't want to hear anything.
Go away from here please.

1037
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:51,044
You go. And stop your nonsense.
Listen to me.

1038
01:24:14,277 --> 01:24:20,488
You Savitri! What you do with
Iyer, I know everything.

1039
01:24:21,825 --> 01:24:23,800
That Iyer told you to
bring the ornaments..

1040
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,107
..and you will give
my ornaments to him.

1041
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:30,562
I will not tell you.

1042
01:24:33,588 --> 01:24:37,424
And you old woman, your
days are over..

1043
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:42,149
..even then you want a set,
of diamonds?

1044
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:43,627
I will not give.

1045
01:24:43,707 --> 01:24:46,364
I will make a fool of you.

1046
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:56,961
And you old man, you want the
papers of the Udipi hotel.

1047
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,795
I gave it to my uncle's son.

1048
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:02,860
Present! Gift! Any objection?

1049
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:07,734
I will give nothing to you all.

1050
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:13,118
Get out. Get out of me.

1051
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:17,921
Get out, out, out.

1052
01:25:33,486 --> 01:25:34,788
What? What? What happened to me?

1053
01:25:34,868 --> 01:25:37,744
That fat man's soul had
entered your body.

1054
01:25:40,497 --> 01:25:41,270
In my body?

1055
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:43,109
This is a great gift from God.

1056
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:47,351
I don't want this gift,
I was choking.

1057
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:51,361
You people are still
sitting here, go. Go!

1058
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,290
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

1059
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:05,719
I can understand your pain, Avinash.

1060
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:07,954
But I cannot become the
cure to this pain.

1061
01:26:08,034 --> 01:26:10,736
Only you can cure. You go to
Pooja and tell her to go to..

1062
01:26:10,816 --> 01:26:13,425
..the police station and lodge
a complaint against Vimal.

1063
01:26:13,505 --> 01:26:14,728
But how can you be sure that..

1064
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:17,868
..Vimal is involved in
the death of Avinash?

1065
01:26:17,948 --> 01:26:22,071
My husband's soul contacted
a woman. She told me.

1066
01:26:22,151 --> 01:26:26,673
Oh I see. Will his soul
testify in the court?

1067
01:26:28,468 --> 01:26:32,728
By the way, which woman did
the soul of Avinash approach?

1068
01:26:32,808 --> 01:26:34,070
Maya Gangadhami.

1069
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,641
Oh, is it Maya Gangadhami?

1070
01:26:36,922 --> 01:26:38,664
I should have already known.

1071
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:41,171
She is a very cunning
woman, Ms. Pooja.

1072
01:26:41,426 --> 01:26:44,426
There have already been 3 cases
of cheating against her.

1073
01:26:44,506 --> 01:26:48,236
I myself have investigated
against her once.

1074
01:26:49,995 --> 01:26:52,036
But we could not sentence her..

1075
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:54,068
..since the judge's wife
was her disciple.

1076
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:55,728
But inspector, she told
me some things..

1077
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:58,960
..between me and my husband..

1078
01:26:59,717 --> 01:27:01,881
..that only me and Avinash knew.

1079
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,598
And I also sense that
Avinash is around me.

1080
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:10,467
I am sorry. I cannot do anything.

1081
01:27:20,347 --> 01:27:22,591
Pooja! Where had you been?

1082
01:27:22,775 --> 01:27:24,702
Police station.
- Police station?

1083
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:28,581
Maya says that you have
got Avinash killed.

1084
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:32,382
But the police say that
Maya is a fraud.

1085
01:27:34,151 --> 01:27:38,005
And there are 3 cases on her.

1086
01:27:43,142 --> 01:27:44,576
I had already told this before.

1087
01:27:45,113 --> 01:27:47,760
lf Avi's soul will come it
will come to me or you.

1088
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,057
Why will it go to Maya?

1089
01:27:51,482 --> 01:27:56,207
And, I got Avi killed. Or someone
else got him killed.

1090
01:27:56,594 --> 01:27:57,887
What difference does it make?

1091
01:27:58,591 --> 01:28:00,095
My brother is no more.

1092
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:03,333
Grief is for 3 days or 13 days.

1093
01:28:03,703 --> 01:28:05,164
Not for whole life?

1094
01:28:06,008 --> 01:28:09,431
See Pooja, forget your past.
Come out of it.

1095
01:28:10,478 --> 01:28:12,422
You don't have any control
on the past..

1096
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:15,854
..because what is done is done.

1097
01:28:17,008 --> 01:28:18,705
The present is the reality.

1098
01:28:19,418 --> 01:28:24,574
No, Vimal. I can never
forget Avinash.

1099
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:29,642
Until I am alive, I will
stay as Avinash's wife.

1100
01:28:29,801 --> 01:28:32,810
Avinash's wife. Yes I agree
that you are Avinash's wife.

1101
01:28:33,663 --> 01:28:36,917
But the law does not believe me,
the law asks for proof.

1102
01:28:37,762 --> 01:28:40,524
And you don't have any proof
that you are Avinash's wife.

1103
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,399
Avinash's wife?

1104
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,602
I myself had gone today to the
registrar of marriages..

1105
01:28:46,682 --> 01:28:49,420
..and there is no proof
of your marriage.

1106
01:28:49,983 --> 01:28:52,755
The two witnesses, they are dead!

1107
01:28:52,835 --> 01:28:54,981
They are dead?
- Yes, they are dead.

1108
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:01,095
Pooja, you have a long life ahead
of you, and that too alone.

1109
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:03,947
What will you do with your life?
- Vimal, what has happened to you?

1110
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:07,176
Vimal! - I have lost my senses.
Come on, Pooja.

1111
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:10,994
Vimal, leave me.
- Come on. - Leave me please, Vimal.

1112
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:19,793
Vimal, I beg you to
not touch me, please!

1113
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:26,391
I am going to be the mother
of Avinash's child.

1114
01:29:26,893 --> 01:29:28,556
Mother of Avinash's child?

1115
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:32,488
Come, we will also solve
this problem of yours.

1116
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:36,039
Where is the child? Here?

1117
01:29:36,825 --> 01:29:41,901
No, Vimal.
- No. No. No.

1118
01:29:42,095 --> 01:29:45,420
You scoundrel.
- No, no, no.

1119
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:51,877
So then, I will give him my name.

1120
01:29:51,957 --> 01:29:54,092
I don't want your name.

1121
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:56,213
Come on, Pooja.
- No, no, no.

1122
01:29:57,823 --> 01:30:00,261
What is the problem
in that? Come on.

1123
01:30:07,808 --> 01:30:09,058
Leave me, Vimal!

1124
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:13,939
No! No! No!

1125
01:30:14,134 --> 01:30:15,436
Leave me.

1126
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:23,863
No! No! No!

1127
01:30:23,943 --> 01:30:26,362
No! No! No!

1128
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:29,028
Leave me.

1129
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,628
No.

1130
01:30:34,191 --> 01:30:35,863
Leave her, Vimal. Leave her!

1131
01:30:40,755 --> 01:30:43,746
Hit him, Pooja. Hit him.

1132
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:59,512
Inspector!
- You are Mister?

1133
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:01,844
I am Vimal Saxena.
- Come sit down. - Thank you.

1134
01:31:03,025 --> 01:31:04,649
Mrs. Avinash Saxena..

1135
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:06,127
You tried to rape Mrs. Pooja Saxena.

1136
01:31:06,207 --> 01:31:07,483
Isn't it what you
were trying to say?

1137
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:10,966
This woman is wrongly accusing me.

1138
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:14,740
First thing, she is not
Mrs. Avinash Saxena.

1139
01:31:15,144 --> 01:31:16,046
What do you mean?

1140
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:17,424
I mean to say that this woman..

1141
01:31:18,177 --> 01:31:21,815
..was a servant of my brother
Avinash. - It's a lie.

1142
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:24,849
He is telling lies, Inspector.
I am Avinash's wife.

1143
01:31:24,929 --> 01:31:27,752
lf you are the wife of Avinash,
what proof do you have?

1144
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:29,722
Any witness? Any certificate?

1145
01:31:31,428 --> 01:31:33,257
Ask her, Inspector, ask her.

1146
01:31:33,337 --> 01:31:34,481
Do you have any proof?

1147
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,562
Why Ma'am, why are you quiet?

1148
01:31:38,642 --> 01:31:40,055
Inspector sir, tell me one thing.

1149
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:42,970
A brother has to be present
in a brother's wedding.

1150
01:31:43,683 --> 01:31:45,759
Was I present in her wedding?

1151
01:31:48,072 --> 01:31:51,213
I was not there, because the
wedding never took place.

1152
01:31:52,304 --> 01:31:53,889
Inspector sir, the real matter
is that, this woman Pooja..

1153
01:31:53,969 --> 01:31:58,392
..is a very poor and helpless woman.

1154
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:01,627
And my brother Avinash was a kind
and compassionate person.

1155
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,807
He took a pity on her poverty..

1156
01:32:05,497 --> 01:32:08,826
..and appointed her as
a servant at his home.

1157
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:11,886
And this woman, from being
a servant she started..

1158
01:32:11,966 --> 01:32:16,724
..dreaming of becoming
a owner of the house.

1159
01:32:17,252 --> 01:32:19,117
I did not need her so
I told her to leave.

1160
01:32:19,197 --> 01:32:21,010
Did I do any wrong
- What rubbish are you talking?

1161
01:32:22,549 --> 01:32:24,335
I am saying what an
owner should say.

1162
01:32:24,891 --> 01:32:30,318
I have the right, to appoint a
servant, or dismiss if he likes.

1163
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:32,746
Am I right, Inspector?
- Yes, you are right.

1164
01:32:33,213 --> 01:32:37,242
And when I told her to leave,
she attacked me, see this.

1165
01:32:37,453 --> 01:32:39,996
He is speaking lies, Inspector.
- You keep quiet.

1166
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:43,198
And now she has come to you,
like a devoted woman..

1167
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:46,979
..and says that I tried to rape her!

1168
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:50,852
Mr. Vimal, you lodge a
complaint against her.

1169
01:32:51,195 --> 01:32:52,611
I will put her behind bars.

1170
01:32:52,946 --> 01:32:56,869
No, Inspector sir. 
I don't want to file any complaint.

1171
01:32:57,705 --> 01:32:59,490
Leave her to her own fate.

1172
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:03,863
Take this, your salary for
a month. 500 rupees.

1173
01:33:05,341 --> 01:33:07,373
I don't wish to snatch your rights.

1174
01:33:08,059 --> 01:33:11,254
You dirty, shameless scoundrel.

1175
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,744
You call your brother's
wife a servant.

1176
01:33:14,263 --> 01:33:17,983
As Avinash is not alive today,
so you are degrading me.

1177
01:33:18,063 --> 01:33:19,576
I will not leave you, not leave you.

1178
01:33:19,656 --> 01:33:22,029
Inspector! Inspector she is mad.
- I will not leave you.

1179
01:33:22,109 --> 01:33:24,903
I will not leave you.
- I say stop it.

1180
01:33:28,716 --> 01:33:33,235
Hey! Did you see?
He is an honest man.

1181
01:33:33,411 --> 01:33:36,545
He is allowing you to
go even after all this.

1182
01:33:37,132 --> 01:33:38,245
Go away from here.

1183
01:33:38,325 --> 01:33:41,745
And listen, if I see
you again in my area.

1184
01:33:42,305 --> 01:33:45,077
I will put you behind bars,
understood? Go away.

1185
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:52,415
Sorry Mr. Vimal, 
I had to trouble you.

1186
01:33:52,643 --> 01:33:54,477
No inspector sir, it's alright.

1187
01:33:54,557 --> 01:33:57,096
You have done your duty. No problem.

1188
01:33:57,421 --> 01:33:58,824
Ok, good luck!

1189
01:33:59,183 --> 01:34:00,491
Hello?

1190
01:34:04,124 --> 01:34:05,903
Listen to me and sit in the car.

1191
01:34:05,983 --> 01:34:08,310
Because this not the
Draupadi's period..

1192
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:10,170
..that you will remain
draped in your sari.

1193
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:13,792
And anyhow, Lord Krishna
has stopped helping.

1194
01:34:14,014 --> 01:34:15,653
And what are you worried about?

1195
01:34:16,055 --> 01:34:18,386
You must be having lots of
sari's in your wardrobe.

1196
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:21,879
You can wear another sari
and become Draupadi again.

1197
01:34:22,777 --> 01:34:24,360
So what if Avi is not there with me?

1198
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,420
I have his support of
memories with me.

1199
01:34:26,814 --> 01:34:31,428
And the day that support goes
away, I will kill myself.

1200
01:34:33,078 --> 01:34:34,621
It's ok, as you wish.

1201
01:34:56,493 --> 01:34:58,337
Oh Mother of Lord Jesus!

1202
01:34:59,472 --> 01:35:02,225
Which crime are 
You punishing me for?

1203
01:35:04,354 --> 01:35:08,384
I had not even begun the journey
of a married woman..

1204
01:35:10,029 --> 01:35:16,337
..and You made me a widow.
Helpless, all alone.

1205
01:35:17,287 --> 01:35:22,170
Mother, I wish this
child to be born.

1206
01:35:23,489 --> 01:35:30,079
Because this child is not only his
existence, but his dream also.

1207
01:35:31,521 --> 01:35:33,344
Mother, grant me strength.

1208
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:36,501
Strength so that I can
bring up this child.

1209
01:35:39,299 --> 01:35:45,353
Mother! Mother, Avinash used
to say that the shadow of his..

1210
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:51,567
..love will be with me forever.

1211
01:35:53,453 --> 01:35:56,549
But today the shadow
has also been lost.

1212
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:59,674
Where has it gone?

1213
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:31,078
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1214
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:38,193
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1215
01:36:38,517 --> 01:36:42,353
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

1216
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:48,302
"Will walk with you, my beloved."

1217
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:53,827
"Not me, but the shadow of my
love is with you my love."

1218
01:36:54,241 --> 01:37:02,995
"Not me, but the shadow of my
Love is with you, beloved."

1219
01:37:03,496 --> 01:37:08,959
"Beloved, it is with you."

1220
01:37:09,548 --> 01:37:13,410
"The shadow of love."

1221
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:19,515
"The shadow of love."

1222
01:37:46,891 --> 01:37:57,528
"The wounds of wounded heart,
when will they heal."

1223
01:37:59,181 --> 01:38:10,288
"The withered flowers, when
will they blossom?"

1224
01:38:11,377 --> 01:38:21,956
"The thirsty hearts,
when will they meet?"

1225
01:38:22,682 --> 01:38:27,972
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1226
01:38:30,347 --> 01:38:35,185
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1227
01:38:35,515 --> 01:38:39,390
"Will walk with you love, my love."

1228
01:38:39,617 --> 01:38:45,453
"Will walk with you love, my love."

1229
01:38:45,823 --> 01:38:49,061
"The shadow of love."

1230
01:38:51,964 --> 01:38:56,484
"The shadow of love."

1231
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:39,590
"The river of tears
flow from your eyes."

1232
01:39:41,723 --> 01:39:51,752
"The drop of this tear
says something to me."

1233
01:39:53,831 --> 01:40:04,048
"The desire to meet is yet
there after meeting."

1234
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:10,394
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1235
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:17,515
"Every moment, the
shadow of my love."

1236
01:40:17,902 --> 01:40:21,905
"Will walk with you love, my love."

1237
01:40:21,985 --> 01:40:27,693
"Will walk with you love, my love."

1238
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:30,425
"The shadow of love."

1239
01:40:30,992 --> 01:40:33,782
"The shadow of love."

1240
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:38,080
"The shadow of love."

1241
01:40:42,118 --> 01:40:46,332
Pooja darling! Pooja darling!

1242
01:40:46,412 --> 01:40:47,942
Pooja darling!

1243
01:40:49,157 --> 01:40:50,441
Hi.

1244
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,466
Hey mister! Who are you?

1245
01:40:53,546 --> 01:40:55,077
Good morning, father.

1246
01:40:55,587 --> 01:40:56,819
Why have you come here?

1247
01:40:58,543 --> 01:41:05,090
I am a human, the same that
a man does with a woman.

1248
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:07,091
What? You don't have any shame?

1249
01:41:07,535 --> 01:41:09,365
To behave in this manner
in a Church's compound.

1250
01:41:09,998 --> 01:41:13,092
Shame? And me? Why should
I be ashamed?

1251
01:41:13,948 --> 01:41:15,479
This woman should be ashamed.

1252
01:41:16,209 --> 01:41:20,670
She is misbehaving in
this pious ground.

1253
01:41:22,977 --> 01:41:28,334
I have loved her, but I have
paid money too. Money.

1254
01:41:28,918 --> 01:41:31,240
Get out! I said get out.

1255
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:08,407
Raghav! Raghav!

1256
01:42:10,652 --> 01:42:17,244
Raghav! See buddy, she is Pooja.

1257
01:42:18,612 --> 01:42:20,740
She is my wife, my widow.

1258
01:42:22,598 --> 01:42:28,777
She is pregnant. My child is
in her womb. She has fever.

1259
01:42:28,857 --> 01:42:30,608
But what is she doing
in this subway?

1260
01:42:31,707 --> 01:42:33,753
My brother drove her
out of the house.

1261
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:35,965
Why don't you kill such a brother?

1262
01:42:36,218 --> 01:42:41,004
I wish to kill him, but my
hands are passing through.

1263
01:42:42,306 --> 01:42:44,045
The power that is in your hands,
the power to touch..

1264
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:49,351
..give me that power.

1265
01:42:50,533 --> 01:42:53,328
So that I can help my wife.

1266
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:58,234
I can save this helpless woman
from her destruction.

1267
01:43:00,338 --> 01:43:03,322
Please, help me. Please.

1268
01:43:06,377 --> 01:43:07,559
Come with me.

1269
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:12,845
Can you see that can?

1270
01:43:13,415 --> 01:43:15,927
Think that you have to kick it.

1271
01:43:16,643 --> 01:43:20,505
Go and kick it, go.

1272
01:43:42,057 --> 01:43:43,915
Hey, are you a soul or a man?

1273
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:45,541
You can't even think.

1274
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,517
Imagine this is not a can, but
your cousin brother's shadow.

1275
01:43:50,763 --> 01:43:52,778
And then hit. Think and kick.

1276
01:43:53,623 --> 01:43:58,046
Think and kick. Think and kick.

1277
01:43:58,533 --> 01:44:02,536
Think and kick. Think and kick.

1278
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:17,640
Hit at my hand.

1279
01:44:18,907 --> 01:44:23,658
This is not a hand, but your
cousin brother's face.

1280
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:27,933
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

1281
01:44:38,862 --> 01:44:44,828
Raghav, you have given me the
power to touch. Thank you.

1282
01:44:59,037 --> 01:45:01,096
It looks like my time
to go has arrived.

1283
01:45:01,729 --> 01:45:03,040
What do you mean?

1284
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,652
We are wandering spirits.

1285
01:45:07,042 --> 01:45:09,990
Because of some desire, some wish,
or some attachment..

1286
01:45:10,254 --> 01:45:16,589
..or to finish some unfinished
work, we wander.

1287
01:45:17,925 --> 01:45:19,412
It seems my spirit was wandering..

1288
01:45:19,492 --> 01:45:21,585
..to give you the power to touch.

1289
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:24,234
My work is finished today.

1290
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:26,706
Now I will get my freedom.

1291
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:29,899
Thank you, my friend, thank you.

1292
01:45:31,378 --> 01:45:34,967
Go. Go with the power I gave you.

1293
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:39,252
And get your wife her rights,
but also remember..

1294
01:45:40,342 --> 01:45:42,059
..with the powers I gave you,
you can protect anyone..

1295
01:45:43,141 --> 01:45:49,168
..but you cannot harm
or kill at all!

1296
01:45:58,572 --> 01:46:01,824
Hey thief, thief. Catch him.

1297
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:22,422
What is this?
- Run. Run.

1298
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,141
Avinash, you have come back.

1299
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:48,746
Avinash! Avinash,
you have come back.

1300
01:46:50,373 --> 01:46:54,595
Vimal has tortured me,
Avinash. A lot.

1301
01:46:56,296 --> 01:46:59,093
Yes, come let's go home.

1302
01:47:00,993 --> 01:47:02,216
Come, Avinash.

1303
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:19,512
So Draupadi has come to
get her robes stripped?

1304
01:47:19,592 --> 01:47:20,867
I had already told you..

1305
01:47:20,947 --> 01:47:24,845
..the concept of Indian woman
is very old and outdated.

1306
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:28,196
It needs to be changed
everyday like clothes.

1307
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:29,525
Needs to be up-to-date.

1308
01:47:29,605 --> 01:47:30,817
Why? Isn't it?

1309
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:32,700
Come on, baby, come on.

1310
01:47:47,313 --> 01:47:50,973
Agree that you are involved
in Avinash's killing.

1311
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:55,762
Agree that Maya's information
was true.

1312
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:14,981
Hit him, Avinash, hit him more.

1313
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:16,450
Just kill him!

1314
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:31,896
Kill him, just kill him.

1315
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:44,644
Listen to me, Vimal. Pooja is mine.

1316
01:48:44,724 --> 01:48:46,640
She is the mother of my child.

1317
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,094
I will not go from here unless
she gets her proper rights.

1318
01:48:49,174 --> 01:48:52,955
Don't come in her way, listen,
you scoundrel.

1319
01:48:53,438 --> 01:48:55,691
Robert! Robert!
- What happened?

1320
01:48:56,725 --> 01:48:58,246
The spirit of Avinash exists.

1321
01:48:58,326 --> 01:48:59,449
What are you saying?

1322
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:01,166
I myself have felt it.

1323
01:49:01,246 --> 01:49:05,446
You do one thing. Go to Mayas
home and finish her.

1324
01:49:05,526 --> 01:49:08,011
So that the path of calling
Avinash's spirit is not there.

1325
01:49:08,196 --> 01:49:09,920
And then we stay in peace.

1326
01:49:20,178 --> 01:49:25,388
Open the door. Come out, fast.

1327
01:49:28,570 --> 01:49:30,013
What will I do with these three?

1328
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,864
Who is it?

1329
01:50:50,096 --> 01:50:51,557
This guy is falling himself!

1330
01:51:17,276 --> 01:51:19,185
Get lost.

1331
01:52:13,123 --> 01:52:14,319
Come on.

1332
01:52:28,387 --> 01:52:30,517
Yes.
- Excuse me. - Give.

1333
01:52:33,032 --> 01:52:34,185
Twenty five lakh!

1334
01:52:45,507 --> 01:52:47,662
Twenty five lakh?
- Yes.

1335
01:52:47,742 --> 01:52:51,829
Twenty five lakh!
- Maya, please control yourself.

1336
01:52:53,209 --> 01:53:00,766
Control? Please hurry up.

1337
01:53:03,342 --> 01:53:05,045
You sign here please.

1338
01:53:09,549 --> 01:53:10,942
Ma'am, my pen.

1339
01:53:12,425 --> 01:53:15,661
When will I get this money?

1340
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:17,806
You wait for 5 minutes,
you will get them.

1341
01:53:18,389 --> 01:53:19,691
You please hurry.

1342
01:53:21,266 --> 01:53:26,695
Avinash! Avinash, you
please be next to me.

1343
01:53:27,192 --> 01:53:29,112
I am going to get 25 lakhs!

1344
01:53:29,192 --> 01:53:30,944
Maya, try to control yourself.

1345
01:53:31,024 --> 01:53:32,589
How will I control myself?

1346
01:53:40,762 --> 01:53:42,636
The rifle is ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

1347
01:53:43,094 --> 01:53:45,415
There are bullets in it?
- Yes, ma'am.

1348
01:53:45,495 --> 01:53:49,721
Keep it ready, because
there are many thieves.

1349
01:53:49,801 --> 01:53:51,715
Ma'am, you don't be scared.

1350
01:53:52,526 --> 01:53:54,418
I won't be scared. You
know it is 25 lakhs.

1351
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:02,288
5 lakh!

1352
01:54:02,541 --> 01:54:03,906
6 lakh!

1353
01:54:09,648 --> 01:54:16,672
18 lakh.
- Maya be fast.

1354
01:54:18,249 --> 01:54:21,445
20 lakh.
- Maya, please

1355
01:54:22,318 --> 01:54:23,290
22 lakh.

1356
01:54:24,415 --> 01:54:28,820
23 lakh, 24 lakh, 25 lakh.

1357
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:34,398
You gave me 25 lakh in one stroke.

1358
01:54:34,732 --> 01:54:36,879
May God make you successful.

1359
01:54:37,134 --> 01:54:38,718
May God make this bank successful!

1360
01:54:39,008 --> 01:54:42,994
I wish you all the very
best. Thank you.

1361
01:54:43,074 --> 01:54:45,762
Maya, come soon.
- Yes, I am coming.

1362
01:54:50,995 --> 01:54:52,212
25 lakh!

1363
01:54:52,292 --> 01:54:54,426
Sorry. Hope you didn't get hurt.

1364
01:54:55,613 --> 01:54:57,927
You have eyes or potatoes.
- What?

1365
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:01,331
Do you know the fine of banging
into a princess? - What?

1366
01:55:01,411 --> 01:55:03,883
Maya, he..
- You keep quiet.

1367
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,808
You look fit enough.

1368
01:55:05,888 --> 01:55:08,359
lf you were handicapped, then
I would have excused you.

1369
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:09,889
But now you will say sorry again..

1370
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:12,371
..and I will forgive
you again, ask why?

1371
01:55:13,092 --> 01:55:15,170
Because I am worth 25 lakhs.

1372
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:17,275
Maya, you don't know whom
you are talking to?

1373
01:55:17,355 --> 01:55:19,284
Let him be, but I am
no less than him.

1374
01:55:19,364 --> 01:55:21,398
Let him know that
I am worth 25 lakhs.

1375
01:55:21,601 --> 01:55:24,277
Maya, he is my brother.
- So what?

1376
01:55:24,357 --> 01:55:27,909
Let him be. I said I am worth
25 lakhs. Let him know that.

1377
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:29,514
Maya, he is the killer.

1378
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:40,280
Maya, don't say anything more,
leave from here, please.

1379
01:55:43,181 --> 01:55:45,617
I am sorry.
- Maya. Maya.

1380
01:55:51,373 --> 01:55:52,445
She appears mad.

1381
01:55:58,102 --> 01:55:59,334
Good morning, manager sir.

1382
01:55:59,414 --> 01:56:01,681
Good morning. Please sit down.

1383
01:56:01,761 --> 01:56:03,055
How are you?
- I am fine.

1384
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:05,834
Manager sir, these are
the court order's..

1385
01:56:06,221 --> 01:56:08,515
..I am the legal heir
of Avinash Saxena now.

1386
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:10,251
I see.

1387
01:56:11,948 --> 01:56:14,117
Mr. Vimal Saxena..

1388
01:56:14,197 --> 01:56:16,717
..you did not need a order to
get 100 rupees. - 100 rupees?

1389
01:56:16,893 --> 01:56:19,646
As far as I know, there should
be 25 lakhs in this.

1390
01:56:19,726 --> 01:56:22,312
Of course there were, but
just now, a princess..

1391
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:23,958
..from Meghalaya withdrew the money.

1392
01:56:24,183 --> 01:56:27,881
What? And you gave away?
- I had to give.

1393
01:56:27,961 --> 01:56:31,416
Avinash Saxena had sent a
bearer check, I had to pay.

1394
01:56:31,812 --> 01:56:32,833
Avinash?

1395
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:37,103
Such a nice spirit you are!

1396
01:56:37,183 --> 01:56:38,869
25 lakhs just like that?

1397
01:56:38,949 --> 01:56:42,285
I never thought that you
could be so generous.

1398
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:44,113
I had thought that day,
if I helped you..

1399
01:56:44,193 --> 01:56:46,990
..then one day I will
get a good in return.

1400
01:56:47,070 --> 01:56:49,479
And today, you gave me
really a good return.

1401
01:56:49,559 --> 01:56:51,396
I know what you will say to me now?

1402
01:56:51,476 --> 01:56:52,442
What will I say?

1403
01:56:52,522 --> 01:56:55,103
You will say that Maya, you
stop doing all these petty..

1404
01:56:55,183 --> 01:56:59,449
..things from today, 
but I have already stopped that.

1405
01:56:59,529 --> 01:57:01,109
I swear on God, 
I swear on my mother..

1406
01:57:01,189 --> 01:57:02,436
..I have stopped everything.

1407
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:04,485
Ok. Ok, shall we leave from here?
- Yes, come.

1408
01:57:07,183 --> 01:57:08,445
Who?

1409
01:57:11,096 --> 01:57:13,280
Pooja, Avinash has come.

1410
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:16,911
Avinash? Where is he?

1411
01:57:16,991 --> 01:57:18,448
I am beside you, Pooja.

1412
01:57:19,763 --> 01:57:21,610
Avinash is next to you, Pooja.

1413
01:57:22,138 --> 01:57:23,379
Next to me?

1414
01:57:27,043 --> 01:57:29,210
I am afar even though
I am next to you, Pooja.

1415
01:57:30,914 --> 01:57:37,556
Pooja, though Avinash is near you,
but he is too far from you.

1416
01:57:40,031 --> 01:57:44,672
Avinash, it is enough for
me that you are near to me.

1417
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:50,028
Do you know I am going to be
the mother of your child!

1418
01:57:50,468 --> 01:57:51,864
I know, Pooja.

1419
01:57:52,238 --> 01:57:53,921
Avinash knows, Pooja.

1420
01:57:58,342 --> 01:57:59,749
I love you, Pooja.

1421
01:58:00,574 --> 01:58:04,620
Maya, ask Pooja, what
else can I do for her?

1422
01:58:04,851 --> 01:58:08,711
Avinash is asking, what else
can he do for you, Pooja?

1423
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,395
I want my Avinash.

1424
01:58:14,308 --> 01:58:16,983
I wish to touch him,
get near him again..

1425
01:58:18,256 --> 01:58:24,239
..and feel the smell
of his presence.

1426
01:58:27,132 --> 01:58:29,001
I wish this could
be possible, Pooja.

1427
01:58:31,179 --> 01:58:32,916
This is possible, Avinash.

1428
01:58:36,292 --> 01:58:40,691
I have a way to reduce the
distance between you.

1429
01:58:41,977 --> 01:58:43,312
What?

1430
01:58:45,727 --> 01:58:47,805
You can enter my body and..

1431
01:58:49,499 --> 01:58:53,491
..reduce the distance
of your love, Avinash.

1432
01:58:55,514 --> 01:58:59,198
Come Avinash, come.

1433
01:59:22,545 --> 01:59:28,337
"I am a little far you from you,
a little next to you."

1434
01:59:28,417 --> 01:59:31,419
"Come near and more near me."

1435
01:59:31,499 --> 01:59:39,403
"Oh my lover, Oh my beloved."

1436
01:59:39,483 --> 01:59:45,045
"I am a little far you from you,
a little next to you."

1437
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:48,083
"Come near and more near me."

1438
01:59:48,163 --> 01:59:55,932
"Oh my lover, Oh my beloved."

1439
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:25,722
"How near we are, and yet so afar."

1440
02:00:29,927 --> 02:00:36,517
"How near we are, and yet so afar."

1441
02:00:37,432 --> 02:00:44,145
"Two hearts are so desperate to meet."

1442
02:00:45,342 --> 02:00:54,359
"I wish to merge into you, my beloved."

1443
02:00:54,439 --> 02:00:59,989
"I am a little far you from you,
a little next to you."

1444
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:02,998
"Come near and more near me."

1445
02:01:03,332 --> 02:01:11,277
"Oh my lover, Oh my beloved."

1446
02:01:37,737 --> 02:01:44,660
"How can I show the
wounds of my heart?"

1447
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:55,692
"How can I show the
wounds of my heart?"

1448
02:01:56,466 --> 02:02:03,248
"I may die with my restlessness."

1449
02:02:04,392 --> 02:02:12,599
"Come my beloved; let me
embrace your shadow."

1450
02:02:13,329 --> 02:02:19,197
"I am a little far you from you,
a little next to you."

1451
02:02:19,277 --> 02:02:22,203
"Come near and more near me."

1452
02:02:22,283 --> 02:02:30,010
"Oh my lover, Oh my beloved."

1453
02:02:30,352 --> 02:02:35,992
"I am a little far you from you,
a little next to you."

1454
02:02:36,072 --> 02:02:38,781
"Come near and more near me."

1455
02:02:39,027 --> 02:02:46,926
"Oh my lover, Oh my beloved."

1456
02:02:47,287 --> 02:02:52,793
"I am a little far you from you.
- A little next to you."

1457
02:02:52,873 --> 02:02:55,802
"Come near and more near me."

1458
02:02:55,882 --> 02:03:03,888
"Oh my lover!
- Oh my beloved!"

1459
02:03:27,731 --> 02:03:28,892
Run, Pooja.

1460
02:03:31,856 --> 02:03:33,141
Come soon. Soon.

1461
02:03:58,688 --> 02:03:59,867
Run, Pooja, run.

1462
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:40,904
Run!

1463
02:04:43,494 --> 02:04:45,205
Where is the money?
- I don't know.

1464
02:04:45,285 --> 02:04:47,061
Tell, where is the money?
- I don't know.

1465
02:04:50,016 --> 02:04:52,242
Tell where is the money?
- I don't know.

1466
02:04:53,104 --> 02:04:55,286
Tell where is the money?
- I don't know.

1467
02:04:55,875 --> 02:04:57,160
Tell where is the money?

1468
02:05:00,265 --> 02:05:01,699
Tell where is the money?

1469
02:05:02,262 --> 02:05:03,485
Tell..

1470
02:05:28,122 --> 02:05:29,592
Come in front.

1471
02:06:02,264 --> 02:06:04,023
You have broken my trust.

1472
02:06:04,613 --> 02:06:06,390
This is the return of my love?

1473
02:06:09,179 --> 02:06:11,347
Being a brother you stabbed
me in my back..

1474
02:06:11,427 --> 02:06:12,997
..I will not spare you.

1475
02:06:31,939 --> 02:06:33,953
What less did I do for you..

1476
02:06:34,261 --> 02:06:36,988
..that you turned my Pooja a widow?

1477
02:06:38,669 --> 02:06:40,622
By closing the eyes after
committing a crime..

1478
02:06:40,702 --> 02:06:43,095
..don't think the world
cannot see you.

1479
02:07:31,409 --> 02:07:32,692
Avinash.

1480
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:34,408
You are dead now, Vimal.

1481
02:07:34,488 --> 02:07:35,719
No.

1482
02:07:35,799 --> 02:07:39,447
Now you will realize that
death is so scary.

1483
02:07:39,527 --> 02:07:41,461
No, this can never happen.

1484
02:07:44,543 --> 02:07:46,020
You are dazed, Vimal.

1485
02:07:47,322 --> 02:07:50,288
When the heartbeats of life are
trapped in the cage of death..

1486
02:07:50,956 --> 02:07:53,473
..a person is dazed,
just as you are now.

1487
02:07:53,553 --> 02:07:54,780
No.

1488
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:57,371
See there lies your dirty
and dead body, Vimal.

1489
02:08:15,917 --> 02:08:17,078
Pooja!

1490
02:08:19,366 --> 02:08:21,020
Pooja!
- Avinash.

1491
02:08:46,016 --> 02:08:48,189
Now I can see you, Avinash.

1492
02:08:48,374 --> 02:08:52,659
The depth of your love
has even forced God.

1493
02:08:54,497 --> 02:08:57,752
I love you, Pooja, I love you.

1494
02:09:22,636 --> 02:09:26,549
Maya, I cannot forget you forever.

1495
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:28,573
Even I won't forget you, Avinash.

1496
02:09:29,506 --> 02:09:33,236
By helping others, the
feeling of happiness..

1497
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:36,826
..you have given me that happiness.

1498
02:09:37,521 --> 02:09:40,001
I am giving you one more
responsibility, Maya.

1499
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:45,499
Promise me. Promise me,
after I leave..

1500
02:09:46,651 --> 02:09:48,675
..you will take care of my Pooja.

1501
02:09:49,044 --> 02:09:50,637
I promise you, Avinash.

1502
02:09:54,736 --> 02:09:56,241
Bye, Pooja.

1503
02:09:57,394 --> 02:10:00,974
Wait Avinash, even I
will come with you.

1504
02:10:01,942 --> 02:10:04,450
I cannot live without you, Avinash.

1505
02:10:05,277 --> 02:10:09,544
No Pooja, you will have to live.

1506
02:10:11,796 --> 02:10:14,179
You will have to live, for this
little symbol of our love.

1507
02:10:20,276 --> 02:10:21,492
Avinash.

1508
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:23,492
Avinash.

1509
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:35,167
Avi. Avi. Avinash. Avi! Avinash!

1510
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:58,799
Mother, mother. Don't leave
me and go, mother.

1511
02:10:59,715 --> 02:11:02,432
You cannot leave me and go, mother.

1512
02:11:02,811 --> 02:11:04,139
Don't do this to me, mother.

1513
02:11:04,219 --> 02:11:06,911
You cannot leave me and go, mother.

1514
02:11:10,254 --> 02:11:11,492
Mother.

1515
02:11:12,771 --> 02:11:15,058
Pooja has gone to Avinash, Rakesh.

1516
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,035
She wanted to you to
reach your goal..

1517
02:11:19,765 --> 02:11:21,674
..and today you have
achieved that goal.

1518
02:11:22,844 --> 02:11:25,809
I wanted so much to talk
to mother. So much.

1519
02:11:26,822 --> 02:11:27,929
Don't worry.

1520
02:11:28,827 --> 02:11:33,842
Whenever you feel like talking
to your mother, you come to me.

1521
02:11:35,874 --> 02:11:35,874
I am there for you!
