00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,348
Lakshmamma... 
-Why are you yelling?

175
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:31,442
Lower your voice, man. 
-Can't you make anything other than upma?

176
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,636
I made that for myself. 
I made roti for you.

177
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,340
Here you go.

178
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,848
Are you going to eat 
upma your whole life?

179
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,699
You're always hogging on upma.

180
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:46,079
All my teeth are gone. 
What else do you expect me to eat?

181
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,598
Upma is an easy-to-cook dish.

182
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,488
Whoa! Really?

183
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:58,863
You're not hurt from the 
war this morning, right?

184
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,063
A tiger is never hurt hunting pigs.

185
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:02,621
I don't get it, man.

186
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:05,660
What was that pledge with the kids? 
Something like 'We're orphans!'.

187
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:08,184
For sympathy sakes? 
-For self respect actually.

188
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,043
Whoa! Self respect, huh?

189
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,575
You're all grown up. 
You don't think of saving up.

190
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,776
But you talk about self respect, eh?

191
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:21,566
Blah! Blah! Blah! 
-Oh, seriously?

192
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:28,017
Do I look like I give a damn? 
-I wish I could smack you down.

193
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,176
I would do the same to you if I could.

194
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,053
Who's going to cook for you then?

195
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:33,442
Eat it.

196
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,505
When you're jobless, this society 
treats you like a misfit.

197
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,620
Birds are supposed to fly in the sky. 
Not the auditorium.

198
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,831
Similarly,we're supposed 
to live to the fullest.

199
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:45,534
It's not all about the money. 
Something you told me, Master.

200
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,573
I also remember you mentioning a poem.

201
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,503
'Money that...' 
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

202
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,980
Try to uphold Telugu 
literature if you can.

203
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,511
Don't ruin it, okay? 
This is a request.

204
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:58,614
Got it?

205
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,536
Bah! He eats so little.

206
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,083
[water running]

207
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:09,477
[grunts]

208
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,515
Lakshmamma... 
-Yeah?

209
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:15,484
Didn't I ask you to post this 
book to where it's addressed?

210
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,796
Yes, you did.

211
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,412
But there's no address on it. 
-Really?

212
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,641
Look. If you bring home all 
kinds of stuff you find...

213
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:27,265
Someday, you'll find these 
things take away the real you.

214
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,172
Yeah, right. I've heard enough. 
-You never listen to me anyway.

215
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:35,342
'Again and again I saw'

216
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:37,993
What did she see?

217
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,594
By Swapna Swaramanjari.

218
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,375
Kind of a nice name.

219
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:47,157
'A life without freedom is 
like a war without an enemy.'

220
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:48,852
What was that?

221
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,521
A life without freedom is 
like a war without an enemy?

222
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,232
I don't get it but it sounds good.

223
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:57,724
'Goutham...'

224
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,405
That's me.

225
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,540
'Goutham. He's a multi-millionaire.'

226
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,915
Whoa! Not me!

227
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:09,087
By the way, why can't it be me?

228
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,439
How would I look as a 
multi-millionaire?

229
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,479
[dramatic music playing]

230
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,050
I look good.

231
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,487
[peppy music playing]

232
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:41,501
[dramatic music playing]

233
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:27,005
Sir...

234
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:29,466
Sir... 
-Hmm?

235
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,519
[clears throat]

236
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:31,893
Can I tell you something?

237
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,496
It's my anniversary today.

238
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,261
Me and my wife want to visit the temple.

239
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:38,291
If you could give me a half day 
off, I'll be back in no time.

240
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:40,518
Why? 
-I just told you, sir.

241
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,510
We'll visit a temple.

242
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:43,986
That is what I'm asking you. Why?

243
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:47,011
[sighs] Err... Why would 
we visit a temple, sir?

244
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,075
For the Lord's blessings.

245
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,715
Please give me a half day leave, sir.

246
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,836
They say 'Work is worship'. 
First learn to love your work.

247
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,430
You wouldn't need blessings.

248
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,555
Who said 'Work is workshop', sir?

249
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,825
Ah! Don't look at me like that, sir.

250
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,926
I'm sure someone great 
must have said that.

251
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,247
Have some water. 
You'll cool down.

252
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,096
Thank you, sir. 
Love you. Happy birthday.

253
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,177
This guy is such a weirdo.

254
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:15,145
Oh! Maybe this is how 
multi-millionaires are.

255
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,427
'Goutham has everything in life 
and yet, something is missing.'

[heart pounding]

257

something wonderful happened.;

[instrumental music playing]

267
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:49,377
Just like Goutham, I wish I 
had a miracle in my life.

268
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,228
Swapna Swaramanjari!

269
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,673
Are you the miracle?

270
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,607

[clicks tongue] Bah!

273
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:34,602
You're doing it wrong. 
Follow me, you guys.

[vocalization]

275
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:03,409
Sis, mom will be bowled over 
if she sees you in this dress.

276
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:08,836
Let me tell you what she really thinks.

277
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:09,657
Come on.

278
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:14,030
Hmm. You look so nice.

279
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:16,257
Awww! So cute!

280
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:19,320
'You look so sexy. So many guys 
are going to flirt with you.'

281
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,922
Be a little careful in college.

282
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:24,314
You know how guys these days can be.

283
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,453
'Don't roam around with 
random guys in college.'

284
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,783
'You know how guys these 
days are looking for fun.'

285
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,242
What are you two gossiping about? Huh?

286
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,359
I'm just asking her to be safe, mom.

287
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:37,134
Hmm. Look. She's so smart.

288
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:38,993
Learn from her.

289
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:42,319
She's from the 4G era, mom. 
She's ought to be fast.

290
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,842
Alright. Now drink your 
milk before leaving.

291
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,273
Okay? 
-Hmm.

292
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,569

address on the book.'

What's up, man?

301
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:32,475
It's just one shock after another, huh?

302
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,203
You haven't gone insane, have you?

00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,079
[grunts]

304
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,546
You're hooked to the book. 
What's so interesting?

305
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,506
Love!

306
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:51,965
I thought you'd live 
strong like a soldier.

307
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,090
But you're living like a loser.

308
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:58,813
Don't say loser, Master. 
The word is lover.

309
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,667
In this generation, a 
lover is code for loser.

310
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,863
Master, even a soldier is 
a lover to his country.

311
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,941
And every lover in this 
world is a soldier.

312
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:13,891
So you won't be waging wars on 
countries and bodies anymore.

313
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,707
It will be hatred, huh?

314
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,200
Good. Good. Carry on.

passing right through his body?

She's not some ghost, is she?

323
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:58,314
What the hell is written in here?

324

is all dressed up.

Where is the soldier headed?

331
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:41,445
Out to wage a war again? 
-Out for an answer actually.

332
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,640
You, your words and actions...

333
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:45,234
Think about it, man.

334
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:48,152
Things might go downhill. 
-I know what to do, Master.

Hey, badly! Whoo-hoo!

Joker!

348
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:58,062
Who are you calling 'Joker', huh?

349
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,001
[upbeat music playing]

350
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:09,724
[wood creaking]

00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:13,802
[laughing] 
-[thud sounds]

352
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:22,861
Bro, let him go.

353
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
[creepy music playing]

354
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,210
[thud sounds]

355
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:00,874
[upbeat music continues]

356
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,779
I'm trying to figure out why 
she was holding a fish.

357
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:23,888
And you call me a joker, huh? 
[thud sounds]

358
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:35,060
Joker, my foot!

359
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
[phone buzzing]

360
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:50,095
Bro... 
-Hey! Job done?

361
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:52,204
I couldn't hit him, bro.

362
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,118
But he smacked me well.

363
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:59,449
I heard you went looking for answers 
and returned with a torn shirt.

364
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,996
What's the matter?

365
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,754
[sighing]

366
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:07,382
Let's put it aside, Master.

367
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,273
I'll read out a poem for you.

368
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,366
Tell me how it is. 
-A poem?!

369
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,773
I can't take that risk. 
Don't get me involved.

370
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:16,758
Give it a hear, Master. You only 
asked me to save Telugu literature.

371
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:18,251
Hmm. Okay.

372
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:20,852
'You're the love that loves love.'

373
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:23,235
'You're the heart that 
surrenders a heart to heart.'

374
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:26,453
'I'm the melodies heard in 
the foaming waves ashore.'

375
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:29,516
'I'm the silence heard in the 
sacrifices of fantasies about love.'

376
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:30,396
Wow!

377
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,486
What's wrong, Master? 
Is it bad?

378
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:37,344
I can't believe you wrote a poem.

379
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:41,322
Unbelievable! 
-You have to believe it, Master.

380
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:45,210
When there's love in your 
heart, every man is a poet.

381
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,312
Now you've completely 
turned into a loser.

382
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,859
You're writing poems as well.

383
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:53,860
You don't get it, Master. 
-Like I said, lovers are losers. Go!

384
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,766
Miss Swapna, your story 
influenced me greatly.

385
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,930
I've become a fan of yours.

386
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:05,219
I'm eagerly waiting for your reply.

387
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:08,625
I hope you will respond 
to my mail this time.

388
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:10,998
[snapping fingers]

389
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:20,056
Psst! Why doesn't she reply 
to any of my messages?

390
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,039
Sis, you've got mail.

391
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:32,725
Why don't you reply? 
You'll get your book back.

392
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,663
He seems like a nice guy.

393
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:37,703
Even a black hen lays a white egg.

394
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,789
Likewise, all men seem 
nice in the beginning.

395
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,564
Anyway, he's a total stranger to me.

396
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:49,986
How do you think I can trust him? 
-Ask him to send a picture of his then.

397
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,066
Basically, I'm not dying 
to get that book back.

398
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,511
'I just tried to write a story.'

399
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,636
And it turned out to be messy.

400
00:34:58,122 --> 00:34:59,605
I didn't like it that much.

401
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:06,213
But he's giving false praise about 
being influenced and becoming my fan.

402
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:09,041
Anyway, I'm damn hungry.

403
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,598
[sighs] Let's go. 
-Come on.

404
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:21,334
[phone beeps]

405
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:29,081
Keep your mobile aside 
and finish dinner.

406
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:35,409
Kids these days don't even have 
the data capacity of a mobile.

407
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:37,230
They keep texting each 
other all the time.

408
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,951
Not everyone has a daddy like 
you who's giving out messages.

409
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:43,284
Shut up and eat your food.

410
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:46,095
Err... -Don't ask me how you 
can eat with your mouth shut.

411
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:48,455
Be silent and eat. 
-[mumbles] Sandhya!

412
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,861
Stop blabbering and pass me that curry.

413
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:55,828
A great poet once said 'The greatest of 
political arguments begin in the kitchen'.

414
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,320
If he were born in this 
house...

415
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:00,008
He'd rewrite it as 'All shitty 
things are born in the kitchen'.

I'm sorry.

423
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,875
Actually, I'm scared of the thunder.

424
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:33,625

What's up, man? You look colorful. 
-Me?

448

[mumbles] I should be asking you that.

Sir, it's my wife's death day today. 
Sorry. Birthday. -Oh, is it?

Why are you trailing me? 
You said it's your wife's birthday.

452
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,087
Take a day off. 
Celebrate with her.

It's me. 
-What?

00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,369
Remember it was raining. 
There was thunder.

465
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:04,200
You hugged me tightly out of fear.

466
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,067
Oh, it's you!

467
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:09,559
I was pretty clear about 
this the other day.

468
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:13,012
I only hugged you out of fear.

469
00:41:13,452 --> 00:41:14,452
I have no feelings for you.

470
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,692
Can I talk to you for 2 minutes?

-Please!

472
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:19,653
No! 
-Please!

473
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:24,550
Tell me.

474
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,847
This might sound like a lie to you.

475
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:29,610
But you're the miracle I 
ever witnessed in my life.

476
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:33,876
My heart starts pounding 
whenever you're close to me.

477
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,805
It happened each and 
every time I saw you.

478
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,261
Even now, I knew you were around 
because my heart was pounding.

479
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:44,386
Are you done yet?

480
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,230
I'm telling the truth. Seriously!

481
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,293
Then listen to my side 
of the story as well.

482
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:52,395
This whole thing about your heart 
pounding and you falling in love...

483
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:56,323
It may sound good but doesn't 
work out practically.

484
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:00,706
If possible, write a fantasy story 
out of this and make a movie.

485
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,518
It will be fantastic! 
-No, listen...

486
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:06,136
[sighs] Sorry. Your time is up.

487

Wow! What a story!

490
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:22,630
We should believe it when a girl 
says she hugged out of fear.

491
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,240
But when we speak our 
heart out genuinely...

492
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:27,724
They don't believe us.

493
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,435
They think we're cooking up stories.

494
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:33,097
[scoffs] Maybe this is why girls 
are often portrayed as dumb.

495
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:39,753

to respond too late.'

'But I'm not interested in 
giving you my address.'

500
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:57,346
'Even though you wanted 
to return my book.'

501
00:42:58,346 --> 00:42:59,080
What?

502
00:42:59,972 --> 00:43:02,690
'I don't want to give away my address.'

503
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:06,989
'Don't tell me then.'

504
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,332

intelligent and clever.'

if you're okay with it.'

to the place I say.'

'I'll send you the location 
in the form of a code.'

509
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:28,815
'Don't even mail me until 
you reach that location.'

510
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:30,980

00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,821
This is my contact number.

519
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,407
Send me yours.

520
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,121
[Girl] 'First you come here.'

521
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:09,870
She literally just asked me to shut up.

522
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:17,693
Do you think he'll come? 
-Only if he has common sense.

523
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:20,021
Anyway, it wasn't a code. 
It was a clue.

524
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,769
When did you lose that book, huh?

525
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,253
I went on a vacation to 
Vizag last month, right?

526
00:44:28,014 --> 00:44:30,637
'I wanted to write a story as 
soon as I explored that place.'

527
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:33,402
'I wrote whatever I felt like.'

528
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:35,526
'Thinking about that story deeply...'

529
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,542
'I sat down on a rock for a long time.'

530
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,658
'I must've forgotten the book there.'

531
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:43,940
'I went back the next day and looked.'

532
00:44:44,355 --> 00:44:45,370
'But I couldn't find it.'

533
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:55,749
Don't show off like it's 
the most awaited book.

534
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:57,964
[sighs] Whatever. Let's go inside.

535
00:45:07,933 --> 00:45:10,565
Hey, Goutham. Where are 
you headed so early?

536
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,595
Hush! Master is asleep. 
I'm going to Hyderabad.

537
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,986
I'll be back soon. 
Keep this money with you.

538
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:20,129
Take care of Master and 
the house while I'm away.

539
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:22,355
Why are you even going there?

540
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:26,301
I'm going there to kill someone. 
-[gasps]

541
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:27,573
Yes!

542
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:30,737
He said something.

543
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:33,558
I didn't get a word of that.

544
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:36,230
What the hell!

545
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:43,669
[traffic noises]

546
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:47,831
Lift. Lift, please.

547
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,306
Psst! Damn!

548
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:52,985
Lift, please.

549
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:55,941
If it were a girl, you 
would've offered a lift.

550
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,027
Bloody womanizers!

551
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:03,884
Wow! Charming guy!

552
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:08,150
[mumbles] Who's this? I 
didn't even ask for a lift.

553
00:46:08,456 --> 00:46:10,893
Hi! Do you want a lift? 
-Yes, please.

554
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:12,433
Get in.

555
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,190
Hi! I'm Chaitra. 
-Chaitra?!

556
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:26,378
I was born in the season 'Chaitra'... 
-So your dad named you after that.

557
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:29,143
Err... I actually named myself. 
-Oh!

558
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:31,511
Your good name? 
-Goutham.

559
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:33,658
Goutham! Wow!

560
00:46:33,683 --> 00:46:36,035
[mumbles] Chaitra and Goutham. Nice!

561
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,073
[awkward smile]

562
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:51,510
Can you drop me at Vizag 
bus stop, please?

563
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:54,607
Where are you headed?

564
00:46:54,742 --> 00:46:57,572
Hyderabad. 
-Oh, Hyderabad!

565
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:01,107
[sultry tone] I'm also going 
somewhere closer to Hyderabad.

566
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,079
Okay.

567
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:04,900
Err...

568
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:09,087
Why don't you come to bed with me? 
-Eh? What?

569
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:13,005
I mean, why don't you come to 
Hyderabad with me? -Oh, okay.

570
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:15,771
[Goutham] Never mind. Drop me 
at the bus station. I'll go.

571
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,955
I don't really mind, Goutham.

572
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:20,924
You're single and so am I.

573
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,713
So let's mingle.

574
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:26,635
Loosen up, Goutham. 
-Okay. Okay.

575
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:29,025
I'm really lucky to have found you.

576
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:30,518
No one was bothering to stop the car.

577

578
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:33,987
I feel the same.

579
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:36,170
You look like an apple.

580
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:38,252
[mumbles] Bah! What's wrong with him?

581
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:48,634
Whoa!

582
00:47:49,387 --> 00:47:52,759
I like your pants zip. 
-[gasps]

583
00:47:54,034 --> 00:47:55,446
[awkward smile] 
Thanks.

584
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:59,431
There's something on your cheek.

585
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,254
Where? Is it gone?

586
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,090

589
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:11,134
[mumbles] What's wrong with you? 
-It's gone now.

590
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,613
Goutham, what do you like the most?

591
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:18,684
Umm... I don't know about that.

592
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:23,199
But I do know whom I like the most. 
-Oh, who is it?

593
00:48:23,673 --> 00:48:25,439
I love my Master so much!

594
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:29,480
Oh! So you're also into men.

595
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:32,048
[chuckles] 
-Whom do you like anyway?

596
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:32,926
Me?

597
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:36,676
I don't know whom I like.

598
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,441
But I do know what I like the most. 
-Oh. What do you like?

599
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:41,675
Rubik’s Cube.

600
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:43,613
Rubik’s Cube?!

601
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:47,918
Rubik’s Cube turns so hard 
when you play with it.

602
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,281
That is why I like it.

603
00:48:58,014 --> 00:49:00,451
Umm... What's in that book? 
You've been staring at it.

604
00:49:01,653 --> 00:49:02,265
A story!

605
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:07,475
Oh. It's a story book? 
I really love stories, Goutham.

606
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,553
Who's the author? 
Chalam?

607
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:12,412
No. It's a girl named Swapna.

608
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:14,328
Yewww! It's a girl?

609
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:17,492
I just hate girls.

610
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,486
[mind voice] It's him, right?

611
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:37,973
Let me check.

612
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:40,579
Hmm.

Did you heart tell you I was here?

624
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,272
It was pounding really hard.

625
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:01,858

Thank you, Chaitra. 
See you again.

Excuse me, bro.

Could you tell me where 
this address is?

702
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,970
Take the first right. 
-Hmm.

703
00:59:55,995 --> 00:59:58,454
Then take the second left. 
-You mean this right?

704
00:59:58,478 --> 01:00:01,478
Yeah. It's the third 
building on the second left.

705

Okay. Thanks, bro. 
-Is this book yours?

706

Not actually. I found it.

707

-Come, baby.

-Yeah, it's mine.

Right. Don't make that habit now.

mistake of your life.

Not all losers are bad.

And not all big shots are good.

797
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:17,912
Similarly...

01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:20,638
Not everyone that 
drinks is an alcoholic.

799

Not everyone that's 
sober is the ideal man.

You're a love guru, right? 
What's your opinion on love?

810

Love is like a valley. Hmm.

You mean like a well? 
-Yeah.

812
01:07:01,373 --> 01:07:03,662
Okay. 
-Some people slip and fall into it.

813

Some people turn blind with 
lust and fall into it.

814

Similarly, some people get lost in 
dreams and fall into it for fun.

when I read the book.

but not a young girl.

-Yeah. I'm alert. I'm alert.

-Yeah, tell me.

Friendship is greater than love.

A friend is greater than a lover.

832
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:02,941
If you fall in love, 
you'll end up hurting.

Hey, dude.

01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:51,589
[chuckles] 
-What happened, dude?

873
01:10:53,693 --> 01:10:55,514
Dude! Hey, dude!

874
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:57,889
You said you're going back home.

875
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,847
Why are you chuckling 
like a crazy person?

876
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:03,016
What? -You're not the face I want 
to see first thing in the morning.

877
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:06,120
What's wrong, dude? 
Did you see something scary?

878
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:08,618
No, Chitti. I actually fell in love.

879
01:11:08,824 --> 01:11:10,824
Love? Are you serious?

880
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,227
Yes, Chitti. I saw a girl last night.

881
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:15,230
No. No. I actually saw an angel.

882
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:17,008
Where? 
-Right here.

883
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,230
Here? What did she do?

884
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:20,386
Did she sing a song?

885
01:11:20,511 --> 01:11:22,081
Yes, Chitti. How do you know?

886
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,154
Silly, dude.

887
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:25,722
It wasn't an angel that you saw. 
It was danger.

888
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:26,938
Her name is Swapna.

889
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:29,620
Swapna?! 
-Just Swapna.

01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,415
Not Swapna Swaramanjari.

Why would I care about that old lady?

892
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,768
This angel Swapna is far more 
dangerous than your old lady Swapna.

893
01:11:37,181 --> 01:11:38,620
She stays on the 3rd floor.

894
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,237
You wouldn't want to mess with her.

895
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,742
She feels she's multi-talented.

896

She writes stories, sings, dances.

897

She'd happily be an actress 
if you gave her the chance.

She's crazy, man. A rebel!

899

Loving her and digging your 
own hole are no different.

Why'd you make the introduction 
so irritating, Chitti?

901
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:01,472
Facts, dude. She's very complicated.

902
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:03,109
A tough nut. 
Forget her, dude.

903
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:06,838
If you want to achieve something in life, 
hard work must become your obsession.

904

Just watch the game. 
-Whoa! What a statement!

What is this, Swapna?

906
01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:15,049
You came, sang a song and 
bowled my friend over.

He says I just have to watch the game.

No. Off to college.

Whoa! You're off to Swapna's college. 
-Yeah.

-But why are you 
dressed like this?

914
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:44,628
This is bare minimum when 
you want to grab attention.

There's no fun otherwise.

-Hmm.

What do I do now, Chitti? 
-Not possible.

Cool, bro. I know the 
Principal really well.

921
01:12:59,051 --> 01:13:01,659
In fact, I was from the same college. 
-Really?

You go to college. My friend 
Pandu will meet you there.

01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,145
It's one crazy world, I tell you.

1039
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:16,520
[exhales deeply]

1040
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:20,919
If there's anything good, it's the lady 
lecturer wearing a sleeveless blouse.

1041
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:23,067
Oh! So you got eyes on her.

1042
01:23:23,317 --> 01:23:24,902
What do you think of me?

1043
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:26,911
I'm just saying she's beautiful.

1044
01:23:27,489 --> 01:23:30,231
Anyway, I only got eyes on my Swapna.

1045
01:23:30,914 --> 01:23:32,364
I wonder what she's doing right now.

1046
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,609
[scoffs] She's a crazy woman.

1047
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:37,270
She must be singing and dancing 
somewhere like a mad person.

1048
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,067
[laughs] Err... I meant 
she's multi-talented, bro.

1049
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,333
I need to use the restroom, okay?

1050
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,810
[serene music playing]

1051
01:24:11,193 --> 01:24:11,997
[grunts]

1052
01:24:27,737 --> 01:24:28,791
Where's sister?

1053
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:30,581
[gasps]

1054
01:24:31,432 --> 01:24:33,182
[gasps] 
-Hey! Where are you going?

1055
01:24:33,207 --> 01:24:36,675
Sis, it's my close friend's 
birthday tomorrow.

1056
01:24:36,816 --> 01:24:41,964
We planned a small celebration 
for her at midnight.

1057
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:45,738
So... -Do you realize what 
would happen if dad found out?

1058
01:24:45,844 --> 01:24:48,995
But if I have restrains, I can't 
achieve anything in life.

1059
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,855
You talk like you're headed to some war.

1060
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,160
Forget about me. 
Tell me if I can go or not.

1061
01:24:54,313 --> 01:24:56,464
Will you help me out or not? 
-Be careful.

1062
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:59,449
If anything goes wrong, you're 
going to have to pay for it.

1063
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:00,816
[kisses] Thank you so much!

1064
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:11,933
[phone buzzing]

1065
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:17,243
Hello... 
-[Sis] I'm home. Open the door.

1066
01:25:17,337 --> 01:25:18,370
Hmm. Coming.

1067
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:22,928
[door creaking]

1068
01:25:24,392 --> 01:25:26,308
[grunting] 
-Hey!

1069
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:29,003
[laughing] 
-What's happening?

1070
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,746
What's wrong with her?

1071
01:25:31,145 --> 01:25:32,667
[door creaking] 
-Watch out!

1072
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:34,769
[whispers] Come on. Get up.

1073
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:37,682
[door creaking] 
-[gasps] Get behind me.

1074
01:25:40,378 --> 01:25:42,378
What are you two doing 
here so late? Huh?

1075
01:25:42,632 --> 01:25:46,361
Does the Constitution say anything 
about not leaving the room at night?

1076
01:25:47,278 --> 01:25:51,230
Err... It's nothing, dad. We were thirsty. 
We couldn't fall asleep, so...

1077
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:53,316
We wanted to catch some fresh air.

1078
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:57,737
Yes, dad. I'm damn thirsty from 
catching fresh air outside.

1079
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:05,388
Hey! Don't drink too 
much water at night.

1080
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,520
Not good for you.

1081
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,543
I didn't mix water at all, dad.

1082
01:26:09,568 --> 01:26:10,982
It was all Sprite.

1083
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:13,286
What the hell is she talking about?

1084
01:26:13,295 --> 01:26:14,982
I mean I was out...

1085
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,779
Let's not talk about it, dad.

1086
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:21,143
Looks like she's out of her mind, dad.

1087
01:26:21,324 --> 01:26:22,693
You guys go to sleep, dad.

1088
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:24,635
I'll look after her.

1089
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:27,302
Yes, dad. She said she'd 
manage everything.

1090
01:26:27,996 --> 01:26:29,925
Don't be crazy. 
Come with me.

1091
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:35,896
Hey! Looks like she had a nightmare. 
Be with her.

1092
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:37,763
Let's go.

1093
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:40,982
[grunts] 
-Have you gone mad?

1094
01:26:41,365 --> 01:26:42,669
Why are you acting crazy?

1095
01:26:43,842 --> 01:26:45,010
We were almost caught.

1096
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,910
Dad would've killed you.

1097
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:51,286
What'd you do at this party anyway? 
-I had three pegs.

1098
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:55,669
I'm really sorry, sis. 
I'll never drink again.

1099
01:26:55,818 --> 01:26:57,607
I love you, sis! 
-[scoffs]

1100
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,295
That won't calm me down.

1101
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:07,521
Hi! 
-Look. Goutham's here.

1102
01:27:07,717 --> 01:27:09,279
Bro, come sit with us.

1103
01:27:09,404 --> 01:27:11,375
Wait. 
-What?

1104
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,055
Whoa!

1105
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:20,045
Good morning! 
-Good morning, ma'am!

1106
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,015
Ma'am...

1107
01:27:30,805 --> 01:27:32,695
[indistinct chatter]

1108
01:27:32,742 --> 01:27:34,280
Excuse me. I have a small 
announcement to make.

1109
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:35,773
Students won't be having 
any classes today.

1110
01:27:35,843 --> 01:27:37,828
[squealing]

1111
01:27:38,148 --> 01:27:39,803
Hush! 
-Stop it!

1112
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:42,241
Why the hell are you 
cawing like crows?

1113
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:43,577
[mumbles] You look more 
like a crow actually.

1114
01:27:43,664 --> 01:27:45,219
This doesn't mean the college is off.

1115
01:27:45,515 --> 01:27:48,304
It's 'Swachch Bharat' day. 
Step out and clean Te entire college,

1116
01:27:48,438 --> 01:27:50,195
Cleaning? I can't do it.

1117
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,460
[indistinct chatter]

1118
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:55,734
[mocking]

1119
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:02,758
Black coffee!

1120
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:07,430
'Drink black coffee for 
dark, glowing skin!'

1121
01:28:07,477 --> 01:28:08,601
[laughs]

1122
01:28:09,195 --> 01:28:11,078
I saw that in a TV ad yesterday.

1123
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:16,289
Oh. Is that why all the handsome guys 
in our college are into black coffee?

1124
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:18,325
[laughing]

1125
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,653
[mumbles] These devils 
can prep all they want.

1126
01:28:21,919 --> 01:28:23,919
But I'm going to fail them in labs.

1127
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:27,223
I'll make sure they're never 
allotted the certificates.

1128
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:29,411
[Guy yelling] Principal incoming!

1129
01:28:29,436 --> 01:28:30,841
Whoa! Let's get out of here.

1130
01:28:33,956 --> 01:28:35,439
Are you here to pass time in the canteen?

1131
01:28:35,904 --> 01:28:37,473
Go out and participate 
in 'Swachch Bharat'.

1132
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:38,708
[All] Okay, sir. 
-Go!

1133
01:28:38,825 --> 01:28:40,207
[mumbles] Getting all 
dressed up won't cut it.

1134
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,192
Hello, Mr. Narayana... 
-Sir...

1135
01:28:43,307 --> 01:28:46,787
Are you drinking black coffee to preserve 
your complexion? -Err... Yes, sir.

1136
01:28:46,934 --> 01:28:49,598
You also come participate in 
'Swachch Bharat'. -Sure, sir.

1137
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,356
Let's go!

1138
01:28:57,928 --> 01:29:00,966
Hey, is she looking? 
-Hmm. She is.

1139
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:04,302
Is she staring deeply? 
-Yeah. Quite deeply.

1140
01:29:04,864 --> 01:29:07,981
Is she staring intensely? 
-Yeah. So intense!

1141
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:10,419
What is she looking at? 
-Me!

1142
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:17,690
You idiot! I was asking about my girl.

1143
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:20,270
But I meant my girl. You think 
you're the only handsome one here?

1144
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:21,505
Give it a rest.

1145
01:29:24,731 --> 01:29:26,574
What girls, man? 
-I already told you.

1146
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:27,872
[awkward smile]

1147
01:29:29,302 --> 01:29:32,169
Aren't you supposed to just clean? 
-I mean, sir...

1148
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,238
Give me a minute. 
I'll show you what I'm made of.

1149
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,559
Give me those. 
-[mumbles] Help me out here, man.

1150
01:29:41,332 --> 01:29:42,052
Turn around.

1151
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:43,419
The other way, sir? 
-Quick!

1152
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,317
[grunts] 
-Hey!

1153
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:51,552
Get to cleaning now.

1154
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:54,520
Always trying to flirt with girls.

1155
01:29:55,568 --> 01:29:56,786
I can't see anything.

1156
01:29:56,935 --> 01:29:59,239
Pandu... 
-Pandu left.

1157
01:29:59,372 --> 01:30:01,098
Where are you, man? 
-Pandu left long back.

1158
01:30:01,154 --> 01:30:04,534
You idiot! Come here. 
-[grunts]

1159
01:30:05,237 --> 01:30:07,237
[traffic noises]

1160
01:30:09,687 --> 01:30:12,019
Geeta! Geeta! No!

1161
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,183
Don't go, Geeta! No!

1162
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:17,418
Don't go, Geeta! You'll die! Don't go!

1163
01:30:17,925 --> 01:30:20,032
Geeta, no! 
-[water splashing]

1164
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:21,829
Don't go, Geeta! No!

1165
01:30:22,133 --> 01:30:24,751
Don't go in, Geeta! 
-Let go, man.

1166
01:30:25,868 --> 01:30:28,813
What's wrong, dude? 
-That old lady killed Geeta in the book.

1167
01:30:29,235 --> 01:30:32,217
I'm really sad. What shall we do? 
-Shall we bury her properly?

1168
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,600
[sobbing]

1169
01:30:38,419 --> 01:30:40,809
What's wrong, Chitti Babu? 
Are you sad too?

1170
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,169
I have tons of work at office tomorrow.

1171
01:30:47,668 --> 01:30:49,661
I had a roommate named Ravi earlier.

1172
01:30:49,966 --> 01:30:54,005
He would do the same. Never 
let me sleep when I had work.

1173
01:30:54,067 --> 01:30:56,794
Why do you guys trouble me 
in the name of your love?

1174
01:30:58,802 --> 01:31:01,192
Whatever. You go to sleep 
and keep dreaming.

1175
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,458
I'll go and sleep upstairs. 
-No need.

1176
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:05,223
You sleep here. I'll go...

1177
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:07,082
Whoa!

1178
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:14,061
[serene music playing]

1179
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,498
[grunts]

1180
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:24,966
[clicks tongue]

1181
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,865
Damn! That old lady's story 
is haunting me in my sleep.

1182
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,198
She gave such a bad 
ending to the story.

1183
01:31:33,426 --> 01:31:35,157
I want to give it a good, 
alternative ending.

1184
01:31:37,136 --> 01:31:38,714
I should save Geeta at any cost.

1185
01:31:47,512 --> 01:31:50,176
Psst! [paper rustling] 
This is bad too.

1186
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:52,428
Crap!

1187
01:31:52,996 --> 01:31:54,667
It needs a much better ending.

1188
01:31:55,653 --> 01:31:57,164
Geeta... Goutham...

1189
01:31:57,571 --> 01:32:00,149
I should keep their love alive.

1190
01:32:02,188 --> 01:32:03,391
Umm... This might be good.

1191
01:32:08,485 --> 01:32:10,726
Ah! This is not right.

1192
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:12,562
Ugh!!!

1193
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:15,458
What do I do?

1194
01:32:23,256 --> 01:32:26,114
What if I replaced Geeta with Swapna?

1195
01:32:28,912 --> 01:32:30,286
This will definitely work out.

1196
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:34,331
Love/Lover X Life.

1197
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:36,815
Equals to a beautiful love story.

1198
01:32:37,503 --> 01:32:39,776
Love/Lover X Life.

1199
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:41,792
What does it mean? 
-Love is a science.

1200
01:32:42,511 --> 01:32:43,512
Lover is art.

1201
01:32:44,035 --> 01:32:45,004
Life is a gift.

1202
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:48,519
In this world, there's no 
greater science than love.

1203
01:32:48,746 --> 01:32:50,641
No bigger art than love.

1204
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:57,203
What does love mean? 
-You can't give it a definition.

1205
01:32:57,352 --> 01:32:58,188
It's a wonder.

1206
01:32:58,774 --> 01:32:59,695
Tell me one thing.

1207
01:33:00,969 --> 01:33:05,833
Whose love story is the greatest 
in this whole wide world?

1208
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:09,398
Every lover who prefers 
love to liking.

1209
01:33:10,478 --> 01:33:11,719
You like someone beautiful.

1210
01:33:12,407 --> 01:33:13,578
But you love your mom.

1211
01:33:14,866 --> 01:33:16,348
Your likes keep changing.

1212
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:17,874
But not love.

So what he was saying was [Love/ Lover 
X Life] is what it's all about.

1227
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,550
He's a creative guy.

1228
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,144
Don't decide yet, sis.

1229
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,293
It's just a trick to impress you.

1230
01:35:58,762 --> 01:36:01,272
I don't think so because...

1231
01:36:01,616 --> 01:36:04,936
I'm a 65 year old lady 
according to him.

1232
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,670
So...

1233
01:36:08,296 --> 01:36:10,350
So he's good. He's creative.

1234
01:36:10,936 --> 01:36:11,834
He's lovable.

1235
01:36:13,084 --> 01:36:15,334
[laughs] Don't worry, dude.

1236
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:19,083
You should plant a tree to impress her.

1237
01:36:19,388 --> 01:36:22,778
Eat one leaf every day.

1238
01:36:23,129 --> 01:36:28,798
And then, any girl in the world 
would be impressed by you.

1239
01:36:29,499 --> 01:36:30,529
Send 500 bucks.

Hmm... What's up, dude? 
-Chitti Babu...

1241
01:36:34,803 --> 01:36:36,709
You have to do me a favor. 
-Okay.

1242
01:36:37,366 --> 01:36:39,204
I want Swapna to fall 
for me at any cost.

1243
01:36:39,744 --> 01:36:41,642
Let's drop a banana peel. 
She'll slip and fall.

1244
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:44,037
Don't give me shitty ideas. 
Go tell your 'Love Guru' audience.

1245
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:46,697
Cool, dude. You want to 
impress that girl, right?

1246
01:36:46,722 --> 01:36:48,439
Is that enough? 
-Yes, bro.

1247
01:36:48,612 --> 01:36:51,908
You can't find a better 
expert than me in the city.

1248

I'm the best!

1249

Stop bragging about yourself, Chitti Babu. 
-I'm not bragging, dude.

You just believe me and follow me.

1251

I'll use the master trick that 
I've been treasuring since ages.

Sir! I've heard this voice before.

This is one and only 
'Love Guru' Chitti Babu.

Sir! You're the 'Love 
Guru' from radio, right?

1267
01:40:33,145 --> 01:40:36,270
Yeah, you got it. 
I'm 'The' Chitti Babu.

1268
01:40:36,746 --> 01:40:40,274
Sir, why are you posing as a beggar?

1269
01:40:40,299 --> 01:40:42,681
Dude, everything is fair 
in love and friendship.

1270
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,462
I'll do anything for friendship.

1271
01:40:44,852 --> 01:40:47,984
Sir, if you're doing 
so much for love...

1272
01:40:48,578 --> 01:40:50,368
Your name will remain in 
the pages of history.

1273
01:40:50,407 --> 01:40:52,704
Hats off! 
-Thank you, dude. Bye.

1274
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:57,695
Ma'am, please give one rupee. 
-I don't have change.

I have paytm, ma'am. 
Scan the code and send one rupee.

You seem like a hi-tech beggar. 
-Yes, ma'am. Updated version.

Dude, I just got her number. 
Will send it in 5 minutes, okay?

1281
01:41:19,626 --> 01:41:21,813
Oh no! I'm caught.

1282
01:41:22,032 --> 01:41:22,821
Hang up.

1283
01:41:23,305 --> 01:41:24,485
Actually, ma'am...

01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,586
I'm a multi-millionaire.

1285
01:41:27,079 --> 01:41:29,079
My mother had a brain tumor recently.

1286
01:41:29,733 --> 01:41:32,047
For her recovery, I must take the 
disguise of a beggar for 30 days.

1287
01:41:32,072 --> 01:41:33,757
No. 40 days, I guess.

1288
01:41:34,023 --> 01:41:37,015
A saint told me that will 
help her get well soon.

1289
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,129
Today is the 39th day. My mom will 
recover completely by tomorrow.

1290
01:41:40,324 --> 01:41:42,207
That saint asked me not 
to reveal this to anyone.

1291
01:41:43,191 --> 01:41:45,230
Oh shit! I told you.

1292
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:46,988
Now my mom is going to 
die because of you.

1293

Mom, please don't die.

-Okay.

1297

Wait. Wait. 
-Action!

1298
01:42:04,597 --> 01:42:06,613
What is your name? 
-Chitti Babu.

1299
01:42:07,269 --> 01:42:10,089
Your full name! 
-'Under the Tree' Chitti Babu.

1300
01:42:10,293 --> 01:42:12,160
'Under the Tree'? Seriously? 
-Yes, ma'am.

1301
01:42:12,387 --> 01:42:14,341
But there is no tree. 
[awkward laugh]

1302

1306

I'm from down south. 
-Hey! Don't irritate me.

1307
01:42:28,104 --> 01:42:29,885
Be honest. 
-Please understand.

1308
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:34,253
What is your mission? 
Who do you think you are?

1309
01:42:34,582 --> 01:42:35,964
Why did you pose as a beggar?

1310
01:42:36,928 --> 01:42:39,217
You're into some scan with these codes.

1311
01:42:40,693 --> 01:42:43,662
Sorry, ma'am. I'm not 
supposed to tell you this.

1312
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:46,108
You think you're Abhinandan?

1313
01:42:46,429 --> 01:42:47,686
He was a great man.

1314
01:42:47,952 --> 01:42:49,616
You're trying to imitate him, huh?

1315
01:42:49,804 --> 01:42:52,210
What are you trying to do? Tell me! 
-Take a break, ma'am. Please!

1316
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:54,569
[phone buzzing] 
-One minute.

1317
01:42:54,937 --> 01:42:59,280
Yeah, Srujana! I just had 
a Thai massage done.

Hi, dude! 
-[spits]

1321
01:43:11,413 --> 01:43:13,960
Give me one last chance. 
I have a terrific idea.

1322
01:43:14,218 --> 01:43:16,218
Don't make me smack your face.

1323
01:43:16,593 --> 01:43:17,897
Listen to me first.

1324
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:20,178
Okay. Tell me.

1325
01:43:20,546 --> 01:43:22,123
Err... Pandu just called.

1326
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:24,459
Didn't his dad call? 
-Ah, funny.

1327
01:43:25,314 --> 01:43:28,110
He has his exams next month. 
-So what?

1328
01:43:28,344 --> 01:43:30,118
There's some guy from your 
college called Bhargav.

1329
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:34,663
Come to the point, Chitti Babu. 
-If you hit him, Swapna will be impressed.

1330
01:43:34,726 --> 01:43:37,645
It's a very old idea but 
it will work 100 percent.

1331
01:43:38,574 --> 01:43:40,676
Shame on you! 
-Dude...

1332
01:43:40,833 --> 01:43:42,473
Listen to me first.

1333
01:43:43,114 --> 01:43:43,856
Hmm.

1334
01:43:45,068 --> 01:43:48,198
He's been troubling so 
many people since years.

1335
01:43:48,378 --> 01:43:49,839
Want me to trouble him?

1336
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:53,596
Ugh, dude! Please listen.

1337
01:43:53,885 --> 01:43:55,143
Cool down.

1338
01:43:56,557 --> 01:43:59,978
Remember you told me about your 
beautiful lecturer Madhuri.

1339
01:44:00,212 --> 01:44:02,994
He ragged her as well.

1340
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:05,244
You just hit him hard.

1341
01:44:05,471 --> 01:44:08,007
I can't hit a cheap guy 
like him, Chitti Babu.

1342
01:44:08,351 --> 01:44:10,975
No, dude. He's a dirty fellow.

1343
01:44:10,999 --> 01:44:13,444
He was my classmate at one point. 
-Really?

1344
01:44:13,499 --> 01:44:17,227
He's still in the same college. 
Just imagine what a loser he Si.

1345
01:44:18,024 --> 01:44:20,665
According to him, girls are puppets.

1346
01:44:20,915 --> 01:44:23,180
He'll drool over anyone, 
as long as it's a female.

1347
01:44:23,242 --> 01:44:27,916
So there's nothing wrong in you hitting him. 
-What do you want me to do finally?

1348
01:44:27,941 --> 01:44:31,002
You just hit him hard. 
-You think that will impress Swapna?

1349
01:44:31,026 --> 01:44:33,550
Not just Swapna. 
Even her friends would be impressed.

1350
01:44:33,807 --> 01:44:37,908
It'd be a pity if so many girls are 
impressed. -Ah! I pity myself. Shit!

1351
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:42,309
Hey, Bhargav! I'm coming.

01:44:53,401 --> 01:44:54,690

[intense music playing]

1356
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:16,963
Bhargav!

1357
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,119
Did you misbehave with Madhuri ma'am?

1358
01:45:22,999 --> 01:45:23,827
I did.

1359
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:27,084
So what?

1360
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,426

[Guy] Principal's coming. 
Get out of here, guys!

1366
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:51,232
I didn't know I could scare them.

1367
01:47:54,443 --> 01:47:55,607
[clicks tongue]

1368
01:47:57,404 --> 01:47:59,457
He said she'd be impressed if I fought.

1369
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:01,755
But she looked at me 
like I'm some goon.

That is why I call him Master.

It's a person.

What's your problem?

It's not a problem. 
It's love.

You joined the same

someone and impress me.

-Yes.

But I don't love you.
