1
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,411
<i>This is Hindustan!</i>

2
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,344
<i>History is witness to many...</i>

3
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,515
<i>...dynasties who have
ruled with sword and blood,</i>

4
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:21,217
<i>Since 1011 AD, countless invaders...</i>

5
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:25,922
<i>...have ravaged and plundered this land,</i>

6
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,369
<i>And then came, the Mughals,</i>

7
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:38,941
<i>They made India their home,
giving it love and respect,</i>

8
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:46,720
<i>Founded by Babur, the Mughal Dynasty
passed from Humayun to his son, Akbar,</i>

9
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:51,086
<i>Among all the Mughal Emperors,
Akbar achieved the greatest heights -</i>

10
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:54,922
<i>Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!</i>

11
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:01,033
<i>The first Mughal Emperor
to be born on Indian soil...</i>

12
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>...Akbar was born in
a Hindu Rajput home,</i>

13
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,036
<i>And there was Princess Jodhaa...</i>

14
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,006
<i>...who was also born in Rajputana,</i>

15
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,015
<i>In Amer,</i>

16
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,247
<i>Daughter of King Bharmal...</i>

17
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:26,990
<i>...and Queen Padmavati,</i>

18
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,087
<i>Jodhaa was betrothed...</i>

19
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:34,362
<i>...to Prince Ratan
Singh of Ajabgarh,</i>

20
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:45,778
<i>The Rajputs - were taught
the art of combat from childhood...</i>

21
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>...to protect their
families and homes...</i>

22
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,975
<i>...and kingdom!</i>

23
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,483
Maan Singh!

24
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,824
Brother Sujamal!

25
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:02,826
<i>Among the warriors,
was Prince Sujamal...</i>

26
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:04,889
<i>...Jodhaa's cousin,</i>

27
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,658
<i>Sujamal loved Jodhaa like a sister,</i>

28
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,804
<i>He was by her side
whenever she beckoned,</i>

29
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,265
You can make a better painting!

30
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:21,108
<i>Bharmal was crowned King,
following the demise of Sujamal's father,</i>

31
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:24,046
<i>Sujamal was left isolated...</i>

32
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:29,089
<i>...because his destiny
would take him far from Amer,</i>

33
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,453
<i>Princess Jodhaa's future
too would lead her...</i>

34
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:37,357
<i>...away from
the Rajputana provinces,</i>

35
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:43,364
<i>And now, the year is 1555!</i>

36
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:49,309
<i>The Mughal dynasty
had almost ended...</i>

37
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:52,444
<i>...following Emperor Humayun's
accidental death,</i>

38
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:59,077
<i>Taking advantage of the situation,
King Hemu seized the Delhi throne,</i>

39
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:06,650
<i>A great battle ensued... in Panipat!</i>

40
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,170
<i>On one side was King Hemu...</i>

41
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:21,933
<i>...with an army twice the size
of the Mughal army,</i>

42
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,140
<i>On the other side...</i>

43
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,875
<i>...was Bairam Khan,
Emperor Humayun's loyal general...</i>

44
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:36,388
<i>...who was training the 13 year-old
Jalaluddin to take on his father's mantle,</i>

45
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:37,489
You must consolidate Hindustan!

46
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,555
Your courage will lead to victory.

47
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,662
I, Bairam Khan, loyal servant
to the Mughal dynasty...

48
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,266
...remind you once again...

49
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,741
...the future of the Mughals
is in your hands.

50
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:05,881
Until he breathed his last, your father
Emperor Humayun, had only one dream -

51
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,784
To see the Mughal flag
flying over Hindustan.

52
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:13,725
God willing, it will be you,
who will fulfill his dream!

53
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,467
Long live Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad!

54
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:42,088
Prepare to attack!

55
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:53,262
If we can kill King Hemu,
his army will scatter.

56
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,561
Hemu's eyes alone are exposed,
unprotected by armour.

57
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,901
Appoint an archer who must
strike him in the eye.

58
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:29,865
Soldiers and riders! Charge!

59
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:48,106
Prepare to charge!

60
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:52,969
Your glorious Majesty!

61
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,568
For the first time, today,
allow your sword to prove its worth.

62
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:03,007
Behead the traitor...

63
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,609
...and bring glory to the Ghazi name!

64
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:11,022
He is worse than a dead man, Khan Baba.
How can I strike him?

65
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:15,889
If you do not, the army will take it amiss...

66
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,955
...and not believe you are a true Ghazi.

67
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,334
Do as I bid!

68
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,205
Soldiers!

69
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:48,027
My brave Mughal soldiers!

70
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,028
Like his ancestors...

71
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:57,337
...our Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad too,
is a true Ghazi!

72
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,498
A glorious future to the young Emperor!

73
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:16,246
<i>This is how Bairam Khan regained
the Delhi throne for the young Emperor,</i>

74
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,721
<i>For the next six years, Bairam Khan
tried consolidating Hindustan...</i>

75
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:29,165
<i>...by sending emissaries with
proclamations to neighbouring provinces,</i>

76
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,969
This decree has been sent by
Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad!

77
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:45,350
Align your kingdom,
within a month to the Mughal Empire!

78
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:52,282
And as a loyal subject,
pay the Jaziya tax and other taxes.

79
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:56,387
If you reject the Emperor's decree...

80
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,557
...then you will face Jalaluddin's wrath!

81
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:03,735
This disobedience will be deemed a crime.

82
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:11,138
Offenders and their kingdoms
will be annihilated.

83
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:14,946
By decree of the Emperor of Hindustan...

84
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,345
...Jalaluddin Mohammad!

85
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,885
Tell your Emperor,
he will not have my kingdom!

86
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:32,557
We, Rajputs, are unused to such orders.

87
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,026
I need some time.

88
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,001
I...

89
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:41,700
...accept!

90
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,367
But... we too have certain conditions.

91
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,442
I won't give Ajabgarh!

92
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:53,776
Throw him out!

93
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:04,925
Prepare to attack!

94
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,340
Have all preparations
been made, Khan Baba?

95
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:55,143
Jalal, the Mughal army awaits your signal.

96
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,847
Was a last chance for peace given?

97
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,984
- Chughtai Khan!
- Your Majesty...

98
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,117
...our peace proclamation
has been returned.

99
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:20,419
O great and magnificent Emperor,
behead him!

100
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,735
No, Khan Baba.

101
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,333
A king in captivity is at our mercy.

102
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,343
He should be forgiven, not beheaded!

103
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,409
Forgive me, Your Majesty...

104
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,315
...as loyal custodian...

105
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,442
...I will have to preserve the glory
of the Mughal Empire.

106
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,486
Enough, Khan Baba!
No more.

107
00:18:58,662 --> 00:18:59,890
Jalal!

108
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:04,965
Do not forget you are the future
of the Mughal Empire.

109
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,229
I, Bairam Khan, have created you,
O Protector of the World!

110
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:14,933
I have built the Empire so carefully...
and now you destroy it.

111
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:19,777
Loyalty can make a man impertinent.

112
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:26,454
I have seen rebellion
clouding your sight, Khan Baba.

113
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,456
This is the first time,
I have stopped your sword.

114
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,329
Do you know why?

115
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:40,432
Because from now on...
I will make my own decisions!

116
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:46,240
From now on, following any battle...

117
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,678
...I want mercy to be shown
to prisoners of war.

118
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,478
Today I declare...

119
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,214
...prisoners of war will not
be enslaved. It is inappropriate.

120
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,351
Yes, I want to rule this land.

121
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,894
But rule it with,
humanity and compassion.

122
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,709
I misunderstood you.

123
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,244
Had I known...

124
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:33,548
...I wouldn't have had any reservation
in ruling under your sovereignty.

125
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,551
- Chughtai Khan!
- This way, Your Highness!

126
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:57,045
It is now my desire, that you
unburden yourself of responsibility...

127
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:02,008
...and devote your life to Allah!
Go on pilgrimage to Mecca.

128
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,228
Your Majesty!

129
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,773
One more province
is now under Mughal rule.

130
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:27,943
What about Rajputana?

131
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,576
Your Majesty,
their borders are unyielding.

132
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,313
The kings of Rajputana
have rejected our sovereignty outright!

133
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,450
The Rajputs!

134
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,295
Devotees of the sword,
the bravest of the brave!

135
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,882
Your Highness!

136
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,734
What's the reason for this interruption.

137
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,101
Forgive me. The Queen
is asking for the Princess.

138
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,402
Tell the Queen mother,
I'll join her shortly.

139
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,867
As you wish.

140
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,281
Jodhaa, this isn't fair!

141
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:17,378
I was about to win when
the attendant distracted me.

142
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,713
Victory is victory, brother.
I have defeated you!

143
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,927
Brother Sujamal, remember -

144
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:34,195
a moment's distraction
can change the duel's outcome.

145
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:38,972
A slight distraction
can bring defeat... or death!

146
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:43,878
- It is you who taught me that!
- Yes, I know.

147
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,514
Now the student teaches the teacher.

148
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,683
Not teaching, only reminding.

149
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:56,147
Let me tell you.
Your skills are impressive.

150
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,322
A good student absorbs knowledge
swiftly and well.

151
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,162
Like you, Jodhaa!

152
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:11,435
Really? So I am a good student.
Thanks to a wise teacher like you.

153
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:15,338
- Your new teacher is wiser.
- A new teacher? Who is that?

154
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,873
The Queen.

155
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:23,477
Your mother will teach you,
what women must know.

156
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:25,885
You will soon be carried away
in a palanquin.

157
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:29,149
But I have a condition!

158
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:33,151
I will not marry, till father
appoints you the Crown Prince!

159
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:35,093
- But...
- My last word!

160
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:38,793
Jodhaa, you must not make
unreasonable demands.

161
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:43,562
But it's true!
I have heard father praise your skills.

162
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:48,577
He speaks of your bravery.
And the many tournaments you have won...

163
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:51,310
...you are proficient in warfare
deserving to be crowned.

164
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,210
Now there's nothing
to be worried about. Am I right?

165
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:04,686
<i>Let the prayer begin -
In the name of Lord Surya...</i>

166
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,885
On this auspicious day of Dassera...

167
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,754
...it is time for
important announcements!

168
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,233
My first announcement is:

169
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:50,733
The reins of Amer will be
in Bhagwan Das's hands.

170
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:54,943
The second:

171
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:02,079
Sujamal... will be subordinate
to Bhagwan Das.

172
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:14,153
And now for the news,
you've long awaited.

173
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:21,367
Within the year, on an auspicious day,
with Goddess Jamvai Mata's blessings...

174
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:25,873
...Princess Jodhaa
and Prince Ratan Singh...

175
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,202
...will be joined in holy matrimony!

176
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:33,511
Congratulations!

177
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,875
Feign some shyness!

178
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,255
A fruitful union!

179
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:51,392
Where are you going?
They must be looking for you.

180
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:55,401
Give me your veil.

181
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:04,880
- Go and take my place discreetly.
- Yes.

182
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:12,914
Brother, it grieved me to hear...

183
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:17,423
...perhaps... father was helpless!

184
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:18,919
Helpless?

185
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:22,258
More like selfish and greedy.

186
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,390
I am not hungry for power.

187
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,095
I never eyed a thing that isn't mine.

188
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,767
I don't mind sharing the kingdom
with Bhagwan Das and Maan Singh.

189
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:36,942
All I want is, my self-respect and
honour. And what is rightfully mine.

190
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:40,045
And if I am denied this...

191
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:47,752
...then, remember Jodhaa,
the setting sun will rise again!

192
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:00,495
Brother!

193
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:31,590
I will speak to the Emperor
at an opportune moment...

194
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:36,569
...and request him to ask
King Bharmal...

195
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:40,467
...to give you a share
of the Amer throne.

196
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:47,447
I will be indebted to you,
Sharifuddin Hussain!

197
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,416
What will I get in return?

198
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:53,547
What do you want?

199
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:56,489
To invade Delhi!

200
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,760
Invade... Delhi?

201
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,935
Once you have your share of Amer,
you will have to help me...

202
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,528
...to invade Delhi.

203
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,437
But are you not
the Emperor's brother-in-law?

204
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:19,275
Yes, I did marry Bakshi Banu Begum,
Jalaluddin's sister.

205
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:25,550
Due to that alliance, I was appointed,
the Governor of Ajmer, Nagor and Mewat.

206
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,085
Let me tell you something Sujamal.

207
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:36,566
Water and ambition have one thing
in common - they are ever-swelling.

208
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:42,099
Now I want all of Hindustan!

209
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:50,246
Very well. I will help you.

210
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:55,182
But no blood must be shed
in my accession.

211
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,954
What we dreaded has happened!

212
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:05,319
Sujamal has asked Sharifuddin
for help to annex my throne.

213
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:11,161
If a war is waged,
our kingdom will be ruined.

214
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:15,762
Thousands of women will be widowed.
Children orphaned.

215
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:19,670
The very thought makes me tremble.

216
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:25,910
It does not make any sense to let
innocent people get slaughtered.

217
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:32,113
Chandrabhanji...

218
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:36,484
...wouldn't it be wise to make peace
with the Mughals...

219
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:41,393
...and offer Jalaluddin
a hand of friendship?

220
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:49,296
- Do that and be branded a traitor!
- An alliance with the Mughals?

221
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:51,530
No greater example of treason.

222
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,672
You'll surely be regarded a traitor.

223
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:59,447
It pains me too.
But let me tell you...

224
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,610
...I will be saving my people from
defeat, death and disaster...

225
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,817
...by accepting the Mughal treaty!

226
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,925
Very well, King Bharmal...

227
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:17,323
...let me warn you and
the people of Amer...

228
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,693
...because of your decision...

229
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:24,102
...no alliances will take place
between our families...

230
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,768
...for present and future generations!
- Not only Ajabgarh!

231
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:37,575
All of Rajputana will cut ties with you!

232
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,188
Rajaji, welcome to Sanganer!

233
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,793
His Majesty has seen
Chandrabhanji's message.

234
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:57,201
He will meet you here,
in the elephant arena.

235
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,279
- Where is His Majesty?
- His Majesty? Right there.

236
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:23,125
Taming wild elephants and horses
is the Emperor's favourite pastime.

237
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,242
This is no longer a sport!

238
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,022
Your Majesty,
King Bharmal of Amer...

239
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:05,151
...Head of the Kachhaawaas -
a great Rajput dynasty, awaits you.

240
00:35:05,695 --> 00:35:06,719
Welcome!

241
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,253
Greetings, Your Majesty!

242
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,299
We praise your courage.
A truly amazing feat!

243
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,038
I invite you to my royal tent.

244
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,737
I will be pleased
to welcome you there, Rajaji.

245
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,944
As you wish!

246
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,347
On your guard!

247
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:32,246
The Crown of the Mughals...

248
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:35,246
...the Emperor of Hindustan...

249
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:38,350
...Jalaluddin Mohammad approaches!

250
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:49,389
Welcome. I am honoured
you have traveled so far to see me.

251
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,592
May I know the purpose of this visit?

252
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:58,442
I wish to include the kingdom of Amer
under Mughal sovereignty.

253
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:04,982
I am pleased and proud to hear
you are entrusting Amer to us.

254
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:10,688
I wish to discuss... one more matter...

255
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:12,547
Please go ahead.

256
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,652
In private...

257
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,591
Disperse!

258
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:33,836
Pray speak.

259
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:41,648
You must accept the hand...
of my daughter, Princess Jodhaa!

260
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:48,923
And this will be a marriage of
alliance between the Mughals and Amer.

261
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:03,540
I can understand...
the reason behind your silence...

262
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:06,667
- Probably...
- Don't misunderstand.

263
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:11,473
I appreciate your courage
in speaking your mind.

264
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:16,884
I am honoured by your proposal.
And I thank you for it.

265
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:19,552
Let me give it some thought.

266
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:23,119
Only after visiting
the shrine of Saint Moinuddin Chisti...

267
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:25,386
...will I send you my response.

268
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:28,730
As it befits you!

269
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:38,833
Help me, Khwaja! Help me.

270
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:42,541
I have come to Your sacred shrine
with a dream -

271
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:48,713
The dream of a consolidated Hindustan
under the Mughal sky.

272
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:55,885
Pray to Allah to help me
fulfill this dream, O Saint!

273
00:37:57,696 --> 00:37:59,095
Ameen!

274
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,841
May peace be upon you!

275
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:15,240
- Sharifuddin, all well?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

276
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:16,841
Yes, Khan Baba?

277
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:22,019
Jalal, there was almost
a riot on my way to Ajmer...

278
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,454
...when some Hindu Rajputs...

279
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:28,053
...stopped Muslim pilgrims
from coming to this shrine.

280
00:38:28,627 --> 00:38:30,754
Due to that, the unrest is spreading.

281
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:36,596
Such religious riots,
can cause disaster some day.

282
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,900
Will more security
on the Ajmer route help?

283
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:42,802
Your Majesty, orders will be issued!

284
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:46,171
Many more places
need surveillance, Sharifuddin.

285
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:51,378
Apart from Ajmer, there is...
looting and plundering on the route...

286
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,311
...leading to the Gujarat ports.

287
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,085
That is causing problems
for the Haj pilgrims.

288
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,720
Whom does the Ajmer province fall under?

289
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,153
King Bharmal of Amer.

290
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:13,963
Khan Baba! Kindly get my message
sent to King Bharmal.

291
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:19,805
I accept his proposal of a
marriage of alliance with his daughter.

292
00:39:21,146 --> 00:39:22,773
And especially mention -

293
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:26,616
To ensure peace and unity
in the province...

294
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:30,488
...I will be pleased
to accept this marriage!

295
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:36,885
But consider that she is a Rajput.
A Hindu. How is this marriage possible?

296
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:39,488
Kindly reconsider your decision.

297
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:44,096
Sharifuddin, I have
thought it over carefully.

298
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:50,039
It was the respected Bairam Khan Baba...

299
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:56,938
...who held the reins of
the Mughal rule in my name for years.

300
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,216
For all these years...

301
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:03,782
I have often wondered...

302
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:08,492
...why our forefathers
failed to take over all of Hindustan.

303
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:15,661
Until now I have been in a quandary,
how to make this dream come true.

304
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:22,166
The goal was clear,
but the path was unknown!

305
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:30,877
A marriage of alliance. A new bond.
A divine signal from Allah.

306
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:35,910
I thank you, Almighty Allah,
for showing me the way forward.

307
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:41,418
Khan Baba,
convey my message of acceptance.

308
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:44,485
But father, he is a Mughal!

309
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:52,528
Earlier too, I did not have a choice...

310
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:58,841
...when I was betrothed to
Prince Ratan Singh of Ajabgarh.

311
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:05,844
I convinced my heart to accept him.

312
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,052
But now I am being married to a man...

313
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:17,655
...who belongs to a different religion.

314
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:23,064
Jodhaa, as your father, I understand
what you're going through.

315
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:26,763
Your heart had set out
to marry Prince Ratan Singh.

316
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:31,570
But it is them
who have broken the alliance!

317
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:39,479
It pains me to ask.
If not for your father...

318
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:43,280
...then for the sake of your people...

319
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,214
...for the province of Amer...

320
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:50,553
...you will have to sacrifice
your happiness.

321
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:14,010
I hear you have a message from Agra.
Is brother set to marry?

322
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:18,916
I wonder why
it has been decided so quickly.

323
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,358
Mother is away on a provincial tour.

324
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:27,993
- We must go at once. A lot needs...
- Control your emotions, Begum!

325
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:32,196
Do you have any idea who he is marrying?

326
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:35,239
The Princess of Amer.

327
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,308
A Hindu!

328
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:44,537
Listen carefully!
I will not attend this impure ceremony.

329
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:47,717
And neither will you!

330
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,048
Please listen...

331
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:02,728
Brother, forgive me.

332
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:11,202
<i>Dear brother, I need your help,
Please rescue me, Yours, Jodhaa,</i>

333
00:43:12,544 --> 00:43:16,446
No. How can I send
this letter to Sujamal?

334
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:21,611
- When I know that he's suffering.
- Forgive me, Jodhaa.

335
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:25,280
What if Prince Ratan Singh
reconsiders marrying you?

336
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,123
If you just tell him you are
opposed to this marriage. Then...

337
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:33,560
No, Madhavi. In doing that,
I'll be hurting father.

338
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:39,134
He is convinced this alliance
will safeguard our kingdom.

339
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:41,735
Disperse!

340
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:48,737
There is a way out.

341
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:58,646
Why not send a companion
in your place to marry him?

342
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,759
He has never seen you.

343
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,861
No, mother. If the Mughal Emperor
discovers the truth...

344
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:13,693
...Amer will have to face his wrath.

345
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,568
They will definitely get to know.

346
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,179
Then, my dear...

347
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:32,223
...keep this vial of poison...

348
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:40,554
...drinking poison is better than
losing your honour!

349
00:44:57,815 --> 00:45:02,980
<i>O enchanter of the heart</i>

350
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:09,024
<i>O enchanter of the heart</i>

351
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,425
<i>My beloved Krishna, heed me</i>

352
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:15,130
Lord, why me?

353
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,303
<i>How will I find peace without You?</i>

354
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:26,199
<i>Night and day I pine for You</i>

355
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:35,782
<i>Abandon Your sacred
cities of Kashi and Mathura</i>

356
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:47,129
<i>Come and dwell in my eyes</i>

357
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:51,124
<i>How will I find peace without You?</i>

358
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:57,237
<i>My beloved Krishna,
night and day I pine for You</i>

359
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:17,451
- Yes, Princess?
- I have come to a decision.

360
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:22,550
I wish to meet the Emperor
before I consent to marry.

361
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:25,422
I have certain conditions.

362
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,100
And for that, she has requested...

363
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:36,139
...Your Majesty's presence
in her royal tent.

364
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,221
What are these conditions?

365
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:57,656
They are unknown to me!

366
00:47:58,863 --> 00:48:02,799
I am sorry, she has refused to tell me.

367
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,165
I welcome you...

368
00:48:39,303 --> 00:48:43,296
...I cannot find the words
to express my appreciation...

369
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,370
...that you agreed
to come and hear me out.

370
00:48:47,645 --> 00:48:50,239
I have two conditions -

371
00:48:50,481 --> 00:48:53,917
Only if these are met,
will I marry you.

372
00:48:57,121 --> 00:48:58,588
And what are they?

373
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,690
My first condition -

374
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:07,124
I will be allowed
to keep my religion, my faith...

375
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:10,897
...follow my customs and traditions...

376
00:49:11,636 --> 00:49:15,902
...and under no circumstances,
will I be coerced into conversion!

377
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:22,443
Do you accept?

378
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:25,880
And?

379
00:49:30,588 --> 00:49:33,887
I will be allowed to bring
an idol of my God with me...

380
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:39,861
...and for Him, a temple
will be built in my chamber!

381
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:46,431
These are my two conditions.

382
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:12,061
King Bharmal's daughter
has put two conditions before me.

383
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:15,162
Only if I meet them...

384
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:20,770
...will she consent to marry me.

385
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:24,572
Her first condition:

386
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:31,945
She would like to keep
her religion and traditions.

387
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,252
And the second:

388
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:45,424
A temple should be built in her palace
inside the Mughal fort.

389
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:04,139
This the first time I have experienced
the legendary Rajput pride and dignity.

390
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:12,722
I salute the Princess of Amer's
fearless courage and candour!

391
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:18,823
Let me tell her that I, too...

392
00:51:19,563 --> 00:51:23,795
...am born on the same soil as her.

393
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:29,805
And I, too, have
the same courage and candour!

394
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:35,843
I have decided that the alliance
with Princess Jodhaa of Amer...

395
00:51:39,483 --> 00:51:41,917
...is acceptable to me!

396
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:49,722
Allah willing, her demands
will be met to her satisfaction.

397
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:37,986
Congratulations!

398
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:39,823
Your Majesty, congratulations!

399
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:47,033
Your marriage has given the pilgrims
of Ajmer Sharif new reason to rejoice.

400
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:54,542
A group of Sufis would like to perform
in honour of Khwaja Gharib Nawaaz.

401
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:03,019
<i>Khwajaji, O Saint</i>

402
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:12,463
<i>Khwajaji! O Master</i>

403
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:25,573
<i>O Benevolent Heeder of the poor</i>

404
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:48,732
<i>O Moinuddin</i>

405
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:29,574
<i>O my beloved Khwaja!
Abide in my heart</i>

406
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:37,177
<i>O King of Kings, O beloved of Ali!</i>

407
00:55:53,901 --> 00:56:00,067
<i>O my beloved Khwaja!
Abide in my heart</i>

408
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:17,188
<i>You restore the destiny of the helpless</i>

409
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:41,574
<i>O Saint, I have seen
divine light in Your court</i>

410
00:56:53,660 --> 00:57:01,192
<i>O Saint, men of God
lower their heads in Your court</i>

411
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:09,307
<i>You are the Peer of the realm of Hindal
You are the Pinnacle</i>

412
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:14,479
<i>In yearning for You,
beloved Khwajaji...</i>

413
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:17,812
<i>...we have found the Prophet,
the Chosen One</i>

414
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:06,096
<i>My master has lead me to You</i>

415
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:25,945
<i>My master has led me to You
I have found refuge in You</i>

416
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,761
<i>All my troubles have ended</i>

417
00:58:37,865 --> 00:58:41,801
<i>Now I am one with You</i>

418
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:49,638
<i>No matter how proud I am to be
one with You, it is but little</i>

419
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:57,213
<i>I shall never leave the place
where Your feet rest</i>

420
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,319
What is the reason
for this sternness?

421
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:29,028
Does this marriage displease you?

422
01:02:42,242 --> 01:02:45,075
Islam gives women equal rights
to dissolve a marriage.

423
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,980
If you do not want this marriage...

424
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:55,420
...choose the path of the 'khulla' and
absolve yourself from this marriage.

425
01:02:55,756 --> 01:02:57,121
It is your right!

426
01:02:58,225 --> 01:03:01,023
You can break this bond and be free.

427
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:04,961
Your customs may permit 'khulla',

428
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,832
But for us,
marriage binds us for seven lifetimes.

429
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:16,241
I am grateful to you,
for accepting my demands.

430
01:03:18,779 --> 01:03:23,478
I don't know,
why my mind is filled with doubt.

431
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:30,388
My mind hasn't made
peace with this marriage.

432
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:39,525
Perhaps, it is because our religion
and cultures are so different.

433
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,031
I did give my consent
to this marriage...

434
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:54,904
...yet, my heart does not
allow me to be close to you!

435
01:04:02,956 --> 01:04:05,254
I respect you.

436
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,028
I value your feelings.

437
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,123
I will not force myself on you.

438
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:30,906
I will be close to you when,
God willing, your heart permits.

439
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:37,515
May Allah give you peace!

440
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:13,654
Where's the Emperor?

441
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,489
He is leaving for Malwa
on urgent business.

442
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:33,971
Is everything alright, Jodhaa?

443
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:40,950
Yes.

444
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:41,375
The Empress Hamida Banu Begum,
mother of the Emperor!

445
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:45,017
Welcome, my dear.

446
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:08,373
May Allah protect you from the evil eye
and keep you well and happy!

447
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:14,077
Ameen! So be it!

448
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:20,115
Let me introduce you.
This is Maham Anga...

449
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:26,419
...Jalaluddin's wet nurse.
She is like a mother to him.

450
01:07:27,093 --> 01:07:29,857
She is also a Minister
in the Mughal Court.

451
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:46,101
Remember one thing,
Maham Anga has special status.

452
01:07:46,546 --> 01:07:48,980
Jalal regards her above all the others.

453
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:53,715
More than me.
I have been away most of the time.

454
01:07:54,888 --> 01:08:01,760
She nurtured Jalal
during my 15-year absence.

455
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:09,200
He may ignore my word,
but never hers.

456
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:14,531
Do not be apprehensive, Princess.

457
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:17,733
This is your home!

458
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:22,773
Salima, escort the Princess
to her royal chamber.

459
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:24,177
Yes, Your Majesty.

460
01:08:26,486 --> 01:08:28,920
Wait! A ritual is yet to be done.

461
01:08:29,422 --> 01:08:34,257
<i>Rajput Folk Song about a New Bride</i>

462
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,583
Walk this way, Empress,
with your pretty coloured feet.

463
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:16,399
The wind is blowing in the wrong
direction. Watch her every step!

464
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:23,031
Come, my Empress!
The women's palaces, the royal harem!

465
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:30,514
This is your royal chamber.
It has five sections -

466
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,579
The first is for meetings,
the Goshay Mulaakaat!

467
01:09:33,853 --> 01:09:37,949
Meet Shaak and Shurukh.
They learn quickly...

468
01:09:38,491 --> 01:09:41,358
...and repeat every word they hear.

469
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:48,624
This is your sleeping chamber,
the Khwabgah...

470
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,010
...your changing room,
the Toshak Khana...

471
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:08,181
...your gallery, the Jharokha
and your prayer room, the Tasbih Khana!

472
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,814
But... you won't need the Tasbih Khana.

473
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:17,596
I will, Ni'mat.
I will have my Krishna temple here.

474
01:10:17,697 --> 01:10:22,862
So now we'll hear Hindu devotional
songs echoing in the Mughal fort. Right?

475
01:10:23,036 --> 01:10:25,004
Ni'mat!

476
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:32,872
We did hear of your conditions.
You merit all praise, Empress!

477
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:39,407
Rest assured, these are the Mughals.
A magnificent temple will be built.

478
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:44,989
Not magnificent.
A small temple is what I desire.

479
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:48,291
Kindly pass on this message
to the Emperor.

480
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,424
Yes, Empress!

481
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:18,749
Attention! Silence!

482
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:23,858
Let everyone know!
Fold your hands!

483
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:31,390
Lower your eyes! Crown of the Mughals!
Lord of his subjects!

484
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:38,536
Heir of Timor! Jewel of Babur!
Son of Humayun!

485
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:43,039
Merciful Protector!
Renowned in the Universe!

486
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:45,806
The Emperor of Hindustan!

487
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:53,517
Jalaluddin Mohammad,
graces this court with his presence!

488
01:12:02,064 --> 01:12:06,364
Long live
Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad!

489
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,765
Finance Minister, Todarmalji...

490
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,685
Your Majesty, war raises
taxes and causes inflation...

491
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:30,453
...hitting the common man the hardest.
War destroys the economy!

492
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,694
You are so right, Todarmalji!

493
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:35,794
This needs special attention.

494
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,930
We'll discuss it in the Diwan-E-Khas!
(Private Audience Hall)

495
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,068
Let's proceed.

496
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:46,241
Your Majesty, we've got news
that your brother-in-law...

497
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:51,505
...Sharifuddin Hussain, has taken over
the governance of Ajmer.

498
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:55,884
And he did this
because he is displeased...

499
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,254
...with your marriage
to the Rajput Princess.

500
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:05,588
Silence, Adham Khan! We will
speak of family quarrels in private.

501
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:10,295
No, Khan Baba.
Let Adham Khan continue...

502
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,058
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

503
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:18,806
Sharifuddin doubts your abilities
and intelligence as Emperor.

504
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,399
He even dared to say...

505
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:26,648
because of this marriage you will
cause the ruin of the Mughal dynasty.

506
01:13:27,817 --> 01:13:33,084
He has crossed all boundaries
of respect by spreading this to all.

507
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,551
Sharifuddin!

508
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:39,121
Your Majesty...

509
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:45,858
...ignore him.
A frog can only leap so high!

510
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:53,040
But Sharifuddin has a point,
Madam Maham Anga.

511
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:57,505
Your Majesty...

512
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:02,815
...was this the only way
to consolidate the Empire?

513
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:06,111
Pardon my impertinence...

514
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:10,849
...but may I suggest that your heart
is taking control of your mind.

515
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:16,155
What compelled you to marry a Hindu?

516
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:21,033
It was an administrative decision, Head
of the Ullemas. Of benefit to everyone.

517
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:24,336
Measures taken
for the country's welfare...

518
01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:26,608
...shouldn't be construed
as anti-religious.

519
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:31,374
You are right.
But our sore point is...

520
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:34,348
...why was a temple built in the fort?

521
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:36,482
It is a blow to our hearts!

522
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,178
Shaikh Mubarak Sahib...
Saadir Adaasi Sahib!

523
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:45,490
Circumstances compelled me
to do what I did.

524
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:50,997
The well being of the kingdom
is utmost in my mind!

525
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:58,297
Very well, what do you expect
from me, respected Sirs?

526
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:01,406
Forgive me for saying this,
Your Majesty...

527
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:08,608
...the Empress must be kept out
of all the common areas in the fort.

528
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,783
And no Islamic tradition should be
changed on account of her.

529
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:25,765
<i>O enchanter of the heart</i>

530
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:32,038
<i>My beloved Krishna, heed me</i>

531
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:37,077
<i>How will I find peace without You?</i>

532
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,715
<i>Night and day I pine for You</i>

533
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:52,522
<i>Abandon Your sacred
cities of Kashi and Mathura</i>

534
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:03,670
<i>Come and dwell in my eyes</i>

535
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,607
<i>How will I find peace without You?</i>

536
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:13,940
<i>My beloved Krishna,
night and day I pine for You</i>

537
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,870
Disperse!

538
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:49,710
The Royal Court of Public Proceedings
is adjourned for the day!

539
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:37,794
<i>O Divine dancer who resides
in Gokul in Vrindavan</i>

540
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:43,269
<i>Radha, your handmaiden,
yearns for the sight of You</i>

541
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:52,475
<i>O beautiful dusky son of Nanda,
beloved Krishna</i>

542
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:57,615
<i>O forest-dweller, beauty is Your form</i>

543
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,921
<i>I have surrendered
body and soul to You</i>

544
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:15,262
<i>O enchanter of the heart!</i>

545
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:36,249
Vermilion.

546
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:45,843
<i>I belong to You,
my life belongs to You</i>

547
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:56,388
<i>I see only You
In every reflection</i>

548
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:06,240
<i>I shall become Your flute
And belong to Your lips alone</i>

549
01:21:08,043 --> 01:21:18,476
<i>My heart is flooded with dreams</i>

550
01:21:31,133 --> 01:21:36,628
Why was Shamsuddin Atka Khan
appointed Prime Minister, and not me?

551
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:39,368
It is now clear to me.

552
01:21:40,242 --> 01:21:43,769
You consider
Shamsuddin Atka Khan as a father...

553
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:46,604
...and hence you made him
the Prime Minister.

554
01:21:47,116 --> 01:21:51,280
Who addresses the Emperor
in such a raised tone?

555
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:52,920
That is not true!

556
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,587
I believe in his political abilities.

557
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,155
After all, Adham Khan is
the Emperor's foster and older brother.

558
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:05,023
He dares to challenge the Emperor's
authority without crown or throne...

559
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,327
- Ni'mat!
... through deceit and injustice!

560
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,901
A thousand scoundrels rolled into one!

561
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,902
I want to know how capable
are you, of ruling the kingdom?

562
01:22:14,743 --> 01:22:19,737
You were nothing. But a puppet
who danced to Bairam Khan's tune.

563
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:25,544
Don't forget it was my mother,
who guided you.

564
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:30,089
I too am as capable as you!

565
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:35,562
Mother, on what grounds could
I have appointed him the Prime Minister?

566
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:40,758
He has committed
inhuman and shameful crimes.

567
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:47,801
He has plundered Malwa!
Raped women!

568
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,907
When I declared no prisoner of war
be made into a slave...

569
01:22:52,214 --> 01:22:56,810
...or forced to convert,
Adham disobeyed my orders!

570
01:22:57,553 --> 01:23:00,181
He has done everything I abhor!

571
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:04,354
Actions I detest!

572
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:10,393
He has brought disgrace to
the Mughals through his deeds.

573
01:23:10,799 --> 01:23:14,792
And does marrying a Hindu,
bring great honour?

574
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,665
Beware, Adham!

575
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:20,200
Take the Princess's name with respect!

576
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:24,101
Don't forget she is now
the Empress of Hindustan!

577
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,842
I won't tolerate any disrespect to her.

578
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:35,989
Your Majesty!

579
01:23:46,869 --> 01:23:47,995
Disperse!

580
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:53,398
<i>It is said that bad times
come without warning!</i>

581
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,400
<i>Failing to get Sharifuddin's help...</i>

582
01:23:56,712 --> 01:24:00,409
<i>...Sujamal knocked on other doors
to regain his share of the throne,</i>

583
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:05,480
<i>Prince Ratan Singh of Ajabgarh
offered him help,</i>

584
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:08,989
<i>And so did King Rana
Uday Singh of Udaygarh,</i>

585
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:13,687
To match the military might
of Jalaluddin Mohammad...

586
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,524
...we must forget our
differences and join hands.

587
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:22,869
<i>They agreed to help Sujamal,
But decided to wait for the right time,</i>

588
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:26,898
I will wipe out the names...

589
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:30,439
...of Jodhaa and Jalaluddin
from Rajputana's memory!

590
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:33,246
No. Don't say that, Ranaji.

591
01:24:34,216 --> 01:24:37,208
Jodhaa's plight after marriage,
worries me.

592
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:41,188
What she must be going through.

593
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:44,552
I know her well.

594
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:48,989
She must be unhappy. Very unhappy!

595
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,061
Your Majesty,
this is a difficult question.

596
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:59,406
I'd like to reply
through an anecdote...

597
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:01,298
Pray speak!

598
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:06,609
Your Majesty, the angels were
once asked: 'What is heaven? '

599
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:12,948
They answered: 'Every heart
where love dwells is heaven itself'!

600
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:14,179
Well said!

601
01:25:14,589 --> 01:25:17,581
The angels were then asked,
'What is hell? '

602
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:23,487
They replied: 'A heart
without love is hell itself'!

603
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:25,031
How true!

604
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:27,865
Well spoken!

605
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:33,232
Today's session is over.

606
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:56,158
<i>People may imagine spring is here
Love, too, is bewildered</i>

607
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:09,571
<i>Fragrance upstages
the flowers in the garden</i>

608
01:26:10,312 --> 01:26:15,215
<i>Hidden in the veil of nature
is a touch of sorrow</i>

609
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:23,448
<i>The world around us is mellow
Time is slumbering</i>

610
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:29,489
<i>Lost and forgotten
memories fill my heart</i>

611
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:34,732
Rebels must be dealt with severely.

612
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:40,600
If a ruler is weak,
his kingdom will soon be in disarray.

613
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:56,454
When it comes to Sharifuddin...

614
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:03,497
...you will have to exercise caution.

615
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:09,601
He is beyond, even my control!

616
01:29:23,305 --> 01:29:25,239
Curse my luck! Lost again.

617
01:29:25,607 --> 01:29:30,169
Never mind. Those who lose
in this game, win in love.

618
01:29:30,712 --> 01:29:34,204
Me? And love?
My luck fails me there too.

619
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:37,509
Tell me something...

620
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,456
- Have you ever fallen in love?
- Why this sudden question?

621
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:44,655
It's alright, Neelakshi.

622
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:50,554
To tell you the truth Ni'mat,
I'm not sure what love is.

623
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:55,728
Love? A rainbow of feelings!

624
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:58,438
But you're unlucky in love.
How do you know?

625
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:03,636
As the palace's Head Eunuch,
do you think I spend my time clapping?

626
01:30:03,945 --> 01:30:04,843
Your Majesty...

627
01:30:06,414 --> 01:30:07,642
I have good news.

628
01:30:08,183 --> 01:30:13,086
The Emperor has ordered a Rajput feast
in your honour on the day of the Pir.

629
01:30:14,356 --> 01:30:17,120
A Rajput feast? In my honour?

630
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:19,792
Not mine for sure!

631
01:30:20,762 --> 01:30:21,694
And...

632
01:30:23,598 --> 01:30:25,930
...he has sent you this gift.

633
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:31,805
It is beautiful!

634
01:30:34,576 --> 01:30:37,977
Kindly tell the Emperor,
I like it very much.

635
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,645
Yes, Your Majesty!

636
01:30:40,548 --> 01:30:44,450
This means only one thing.
He's trying to woo you.

637
01:30:46,688 --> 01:30:50,385
If that be so,
I won't be indifferent either.

638
01:30:51,259 --> 01:30:53,454
What do you... propose to do?

639
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:57,024
I will cook for the feast.

640
01:30:58,633 --> 01:31:04,435
Hear this! Her delicate hands
will grind spices and stir pots.

641
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:06,340
That will be the day!

642
01:31:07,242 --> 01:31:08,607
You can't do that.

643
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:09,967
Why not?

644
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:13,874
Because you are
the Empress of Hindustan!

645
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:21,552
Then I shall cook as a wife,
not an Empress!

646
01:31:22,424 --> 01:31:23,789
My! My!

647
01:31:37,105 --> 01:31:40,006
Mir Bakawal, why are you gawking?

648
01:31:41,009 --> 01:31:46,504
It's the first time an Empress
has entered the Royal Kitchen.

649
01:31:46,848 --> 01:31:49,078
Your Highness,
does our cooking displease you?

650
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:52,449
She fears you'll make
mincemeat of the peas!

651
01:31:54,122 --> 01:31:56,386
At your service...

652
01:31:57,892 --> 01:31:59,450
Prepare the ingredients...

653
01:31:59,794 --> 01:32:03,230
Come on! Hear the menu of the day!

654
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:11,804
Your Majesty, we got the vessels
cleaned, as per your instructions.

655
01:32:15,173 --> 01:32:19,041
What's going on here?
Why aren't you preparing lunch?

656
01:32:19,711 --> 01:32:21,042
Weren't you given the menu?

657
01:32:21,112 --> 01:32:25,276
- We have been given the day off.
- The day off? By whom?

658
01:32:25,883 --> 01:32:27,316
The Empress of Hindustan.

659
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:32,614
She will cook a vegetarian
Rajput meal with her own hands.

660
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:46,065
The respected Maham Anga
enters the kitchen!

661
01:32:53,711 --> 01:32:55,872
Keep your distance!

662
01:33:08,059 --> 01:33:11,460
There is a difference in
dreaming and fulfilling dreams.

663
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:15,631
Do not fool yourself into believing...

664
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:18,697
...that you have become
an Empress, Princess!

665
01:33:19,337 --> 01:33:21,100
What wrong have I done?

666
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:23,407
First you had a temple
built in Agra fort...

667
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:26,240
...now you take
charge of the kitchen...

668
01:33:26,944 --> 01:33:28,639
...I am understanding everything!

669
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,944
What do you mean?
I have taken charge of the kitchen?

670
01:33:34,552 --> 01:33:36,611
Isn't that the right
of every married woman?

671
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:41,223
Never forget...

672
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,559
...your marriage to Jalal
is just an alliance.

673
01:33:46,164 --> 01:33:47,995
In exchange for peace.

674
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,628
It might be so for you.

675
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:58,470
For us marriage is a sacred bond,
which ends only in death.

676
01:33:58,576 --> 01:34:01,306
Don't explain the
meaning of marriage to me.

677
01:34:02,347 --> 01:34:04,315
What marriage are you talking about?

678
01:34:04,882 --> 01:34:06,782
Which is not yet consummated?

679
01:34:10,555 --> 01:34:12,750
A marriage is complete...

680
01:34:13,558 --> 01:34:15,788
...only when there's an heir.

681
01:34:16,994 --> 01:34:20,486
And since Jalal won't
even touch you, an heir?

682
01:34:23,201 --> 01:34:28,070
So Princess Jodhaa,
enjoy the world of the Mughals.

683
01:34:28,673 --> 01:34:31,904
But do not try to be part of it.

684
01:34:33,745 --> 01:34:34,575
I...

685
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:38,346
I can't believe you're saying this.

686
01:34:40,685 --> 01:34:44,815
How do you claim to be
like a mother to him?

687
01:34:45,523 --> 01:34:46,615
Yes!

688
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,384
I am his mother!

689
01:34:51,362 --> 01:34:53,626
I have fed him my milk.

690
01:34:54,499 --> 01:34:58,094
Dedicating every waking hour
to his well-being.

691
01:34:58,936 --> 01:35:03,270
I have protected him from all harm.

692
01:35:04,242 --> 01:35:07,700
Thanks to me no one has touched him.

693
01:35:08,946 --> 01:35:12,712
An arrow was aimed at him
when he was a boy...

694
01:35:13,117 --> 01:35:16,416
...I took it on my chest
and saved him!

695
01:35:17,455 --> 01:35:22,859
If anyone tries to come between
Jalal and me, I will destroy them.

696
01:35:24,262 --> 01:35:26,822
I have always kept
him from harm's eye.

697
01:35:28,032 --> 01:35:31,695
You think I'll leave him exposed to you?

698
01:35:33,037 --> 01:35:34,470
Never!

699
01:35:49,787 --> 01:35:53,655
<i>Rajput Folk Song about Feasts</i>

700
01:36:34,432 --> 01:36:39,062
Your Majesty, the menu
today is dal bati churma...

701
01:36:39,203 --> 01:36:45,733
...ker-sangri, pithode, gatte,
til-papdi and panchmel sabzi.

702
01:36:46,344 --> 01:36:51,509
For dessert, we have
ghevar and sohan halwa.

703
01:36:52,717 --> 01:36:54,309
Well done, Mir Bakawal!

704
01:36:54,952 --> 01:36:56,579
Pardon me, Your Majesty...

705
01:36:56,821 --> 01:37:02,589
...the Rajput Empress
has prepared the feast today, not me.

706
01:37:08,099 --> 01:37:11,159
But Mir Bakawal, this feast
was supposed to be in her honour.

707
01:37:12,403 --> 01:37:14,633
He is not at fault.

708
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:19,906
I asked him to let me cook.

709
01:37:20,611 --> 01:37:21,908
Why did you take the trouble?

710
01:37:22,179 --> 01:37:26,343
It's no trouble.
I consider it my good fortune.

711
01:37:28,653 --> 01:37:32,680
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Let me remind you...

712
01:37:33,157 --> 01:37:38,026
...according to the law,
food served to the Emperor...

713
01:37:38,696 --> 01:37:40,891
...must first be tasted by the cook.

714
01:37:42,233 --> 01:37:45,634
Only then, is it safe
for the Emperor to eat.

715
01:37:46,804 --> 01:37:51,332
Since Empress Jodhaa
has made the feast today...

716
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:54,505
...let her say 'Bismillah' and begin.

717
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:02,875
Matters of security
must be respected.

718
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:07,350
Even the Emperor cannot object.

719
01:38:11,195 --> 01:38:16,223
Taste the food, Empress!
Please do the honours.

720
01:39:58,703 --> 01:40:01,638
Your Majesty, the food is safe
to be served!

721
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:08,842
Your Majesty...
you may now enjoy the repast.

722
01:40:14,785 --> 01:40:17,618
Bring me the dishes
the Empress has tasted.

723
01:40:20,124 --> 01:40:23,025
I wish to eat from the same plate!

724
01:40:44,148 --> 01:40:45,308
Wait!

725
01:40:49,086 --> 01:40:50,678
Do not eat that!

726
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:53,515
Why not?

727
01:40:53,858 --> 01:40:54,790
It has...

728
01:40:55,159 --> 01:40:57,354
...less salt.

729
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:36,691
The food is exquisite.

730
01:41:38,803 --> 01:41:41,328
Every morsel deserves praise!

731
01:41:43,641 --> 01:41:45,472
I have enjoyed it so much...

732
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:52,107
I declare on the day of the Pir,
I will only eat vegetarian food...

733
01:41:52,516 --> 01:41:55,007
...from Empress Jodhaa's kitchen!

734
01:41:59,824 --> 01:42:03,021
<i>It is hard to describe this affliction</i>

735
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:06,161
<i>I wonder to myself</i>

736
01:42:06,297 --> 01:42:12,065
<i>Does she belong to me?</i>

737
01:42:13,737 --> 01:42:19,903
<i>We walk side by side
but distance separates us</i>

738
01:42:20,244 --> 01:42:26,149
<i>Like two shores of
the ocean that never meet</i>

739
01:42:27,618 --> 01:42:30,678
<i>She is near yet so far</i>

740
01:42:30,988 --> 01:42:33,980
<i>I cannot endure this yearning</i>

741
01:42:34,425 --> 01:42:40,455
<i>A wall of glass keeps us apart</i>

742
01:42:42,032 --> 01:42:47,868
No one should be allowed
to trade in grain without our consent.

743
01:42:48,472 --> 01:42:49,871
Another suggestion -

744
01:42:51,242 --> 01:42:54,336
In certain provinces
people are suffering from drought.

745
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:57,780
Their taxes should be waived!

746
01:42:59,316 --> 01:43:00,749
You are right, Khan Baba.

747
01:43:02,353 --> 01:43:05,550
Ensure both the policies
are implemented immediately.

748
01:43:05,856 --> 01:43:06,948
Your Majesty!

749
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:22,998
O my God!

750
01:43:23,707 --> 01:43:29,509
<i>I heard a song
My heart chose her</i>

751
01:43:29,813 --> 01:43:35,513
<i>What is this story
that time tells me?</i>

752
01:43:37,388 --> 01:43:42,849
O Allah! If the Emperor hears
about this, he will free me too!

753
01:43:44,228 --> 01:43:47,823
Their freedom is more
important than yours.

754
01:43:54,638 --> 01:43:57,698
<i>If I am filled with sadness</i>

755
01:43:58,008 --> 01:44:00,943
<i>She is forlorn too</i>

756
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:06,913
<i>Loneliness casts a shadow
on our encounters</i>

757
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:15,124
<i>We meet and yet we do not meet,
Flowers bloom and yet they do not</i>

758
01:44:15,559 --> 01:44:21,464
<i>Spring in our eyes,
autumn in our hearts</i>

759
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:30,070
Jodhaa, I do not want to go on
this provincial tour, but duty calls.

760
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:41,908
The Empress sits in the palanquin.

761
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:46,879
- In the name of Allah!
- In the shelter of Allah!

762
01:45:15,719 --> 01:45:17,880
You did well!

763
01:45:18,789 --> 01:45:20,757
Now I will trap her with this.

764
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:22,188
Trap?

765
01:45:22,493 --> 01:45:26,327
But Mahambi, she wrote this letter
before she was married.

766
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:30,496
- How do you know that?
- Neelakshi told me.

767
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:36,896
Remember! You know nothing.

768
01:45:38,475 --> 01:45:41,706
And don't you dare
talk to anyone about this!

769
01:45:42,546 --> 01:45:44,446
Or else...

770
01:45:46,517 --> 01:45:53,753
Princess Jodhaa!
Trying to be too clever, is she?

771
01:45:58,495 --> 01:46:03,057
I implore you. I have tried hard
to contact you. There's still time.

772
01:46:03,834 --> 01:46:10,239
Come and protect me, my brother.
Yours, Jodhaa.

773
01:46:18,282 --> 01:46:24,744
Sujamal, she reminds you of your
brotherly duty. You must go!

774
01:46:25,522 --> 01:46:30,516
Have you lost your mind?
It's a trap!

775
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:34,898
Why would she call you
to a lion's den?

776
01:46:36,533 --> 01:46:41,061
Entering the Agra fort means,
inviting death.

777
01:46:43,674 --> 01:46:47,542
Ranaji, at the cost
of losing my life, I will go...

778
01:46:48,078 --> 01:46:50,308
You have indeed lost
your mind, Sujamal!

779
01:46:51,115 --> 01:46:54,551
Go if you wish.
And spend the rest of your life...

780
01:46:54,885 --> 01:46:57,547
...admiring the dungeons of Agra fort!

781
01:46:58,856 --> 01:47:00,346
I will go.

782
01:47:04,589 --> 01:47:07,183
Sharifuddin, I'm sensing trouble.

783
01:47:07,592 --> 01:47:10,026
I'm in danger of being found out.

784
01:47:10,595 --> 01:47:13,621
The Prime Minister
Shamsuddin Atka Khan...

785
01:47:14,666 --> 01:47:18,329
...has discovered that
I've embezzled tax money.

786
01:47:20,839 --> 01:47:24,036
Adham, my brother,
there's only one way out.

787
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:31,078
Before Shamsuddin
unravels the truth to Todarmal...

788
01:47:32,284 --> 01:47:34,445
...he must be stopped!

789
01:47:36,254 --> 01:47:38,154
Can I be of any help?

790
01:47:40,425 --> 01:47:43,588
After all, I am indebted
to you and your mother...

791
01:47:44,496 --> 01:47:46,657
...for my position in the Mughal army.

792
01:47:47,933 --> 01:47:48,957
No.

793
01:47:50,302 --> 01:47:52,634
I will act alone!

794
01:47:53,104 --> 01:47:56,938
Adham, my brother, be cautious...

795
01:47:57,709 --> 01:48:01,372
...whatever you do,
don't leave it unfinished.

796
01:48:06,618 --> 01:48:10,384
Taxes have been embezzled
in the province of Malwa alone.

797
01:48:11,122 --> 01:48:16,389
Tally the figures in these documents
and you will see for yourself.

798
01:48:18,263 --> 01:48:21,289
But Malwa comes under Adham.

799
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:24,591
- You mean...
- I have always suspected him.

800
01:48:26,638 --> 01:48:28,162
Today I have proof too!

801
01:48:28,773 --> 01:48:30,934
Shamsuddin Atka Khan Sahib!

802
01:48:32,711 --> 01:48:36,545
I must praise your auditing
and revenue collection skills.

803
01:48:37,015 --> 01:48:38,915
How well you count!

804
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:41,946
But when it comes
to my province Malwa...

805
01:48:42,287 --> 01:48:46,053
...you will have to ignore
certain figures.

806
01:48:46,758 --> 01:48:48,089
Consider them a concession.

807
01:48:48,693 --> 01:48:51,890
You forget your responsibility
as the Emperor's elder brother.

808
01:48:52,797 --> 01:48:55,823
Moreover you happily extort
your province to fill your pockets.

809
01:48:56,935 --> 01:49:00,666
- This is sheer cheating!
- Not cheating, a privilege!

810
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,067
I advise you, Khan Baba...

811
01:49:04,643 --> 01:49:09,774
...to not interfere in my affairs or else...
- Adham Khan!

812
01:49:10,582 --> 01:49:16,020
Challenging a Prime Minister is
no less than challenging the Emperor.

813
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:33,828
Disaster, Your Majesty!

814
01:49:33,938 --> 01:49:36,202
Adham Khan has entered
the women's palace with a sword.

815
01:49:36,341 --> 01:49:38,741
He murdered the Prime Minister!

816
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:57,054
You insolent, ungrateful wretch.
How dare you!

817
01:49:57,862 --> 01:50:00,422
You killed a man,
who was like a father to me.

818
01:50:05,003 --> 01:50:07,335
Arrest this miserable wretch!

819
01:50:10,975 --> 01:50:13,705
Today you have crossed all limits!

820
01:50:14,145 --> 01:50:17,171
You killed Khan Baba
to hide your heinous crimes!

821
01:50:17,549 --> 01:50:21,110
Not only was he loyal
to the Mughal Empire...

822
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:24,015
...but also a man of God!

823
01:50:24,923 --> 01:50:27,050
I considered him a father.

824
01:50:30,295 --> 01:50:31,956
His punishment is...

825
01:50:32,363 --> 01:50:33,762
...throw him down...

826
01:50:34,299 --> 01:50:35,323
...head first!

827
01:50:36,401 --> 01:50:38,892
No, Jalal!

828
01:50:51,216 --> 01:50:52,274
Carry out the order!

829
01:51:00,091 --> 01:51:04,425
- Is he dead?
- No, Your Majesty. He is alive.

830
01:51:05,363 --> 01:51:08,093
Then bring him up.
And throw him down again!

831
01:51:53,044 --> 01:51:54,068
Your Majesty...

832
01:52:05,056 --> 01:52:06,546
Keep your distance!

833
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,185
Elder Mother...

834
01:52:40,424 --> 01:52:43,860
...I had to kill Adham
for the terrible crime he committed.

835
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:50,560
Justice demanded his life,
Elder Mother.

836
01:52:52,936 --> 01:52:54,460
I understand.

837
01:52:56,006 --> 01:53:01,467
Adham was wrong and
had to pay for his crime.

838
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,148
That is why I forgive you, Jalal!

839
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:15,149
I know that nothing can come
between you and the throne.

840
01:53:18,729 --> 01:53:20,253
And in my view...

841
01:53:22,132 --> 01:53:26,068
...Jodhaa too, should not
make any such attempt!

842
01:53:26,737 --> 01:53:27,761
Jodhaa?

843
01:53:29,973 --> 01:53:31,497
Why do you speak of her?

844
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,647
Do you know what this is?

845
01:53:42,619 --> 01:53:44,314
A vial of poison!

846
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:48,515
It was found in Jodhaa's belongings.

847
01:53:53,764 --> 01:53:57,256
My greatest fear is now coming true.

848
01:53:58,936 --> 01:53:59,960
Fear?

849
01:54:01,104 --> 01:54:06,838
Don't forget, even
priceless brass turns black!

850
01:54:08,645 --> 01:54:12,741
Find out whom she writes to,
besides her family.

851
01:54:17,888 --> 01:54:20,482
What are you insinuating?

852
01:54:21,859 --> 01:54:26,262
She was betrothed
to the Prince of Ajabgarh.

853
01:54:27,598 --> 01:54:30,260
Then she married you. Why?

854
01:54:31,768 --> 01:54:36,967
She is an assassin sent by the Rajputs
in disguise of a beautiful wife.

855
01:54:46,483 --> 01:54:48,383
Are you saying that...

856
01:54:49,219 --> 01:54:52,120
...she sent a message
to the Prince of Ajabgarh?

857
01:54:53,223 --> 01:54:55,748
You are no longer a child, Jalal.

858
01:54:57,427 --> 01:54:59,156
She's your wife!

859
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:02,997
Yet why does she resist intimacy?

860
01:55:05,502 --> 01:55:06,764
Because...

861
01:55:07,137 --> 01:55:12,336
...she's still in love with
that Rajput Prince of Ajabgarh.

862
01:55:14,211 --> 01:55:15,838
Someone is coming to see her soon.

863
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:25,215
No matter how much light,
a mirror reflects, it has a dark side.

864
01:56:14,171 --> 01:56:15,502
How is my Jodhaa?

865
01:56:16,607 --> 01:56:20,566
I was worried about you.
Why did you want to meet me in secret?

866
01:56:21,278 --> 01:56:24,645
You mentioned in your letter that
you're coming to take me away? But why?

867
01:56:24,915 --> 01:56:29,318
I knew you were unhappy.
I read your letter and came at once.

868
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,356
- Letter? What letter?
- The one that you sent.

869
01:56:34,157 --> 01:56:35,749
I sent no letter.

870
01:56:37,194 --> 01:56:38,684
What do you mean?

871
01:56:40,797 --> 01:56:43,994
- Here it is and your rakhi too.
- This rakhi...

872
01:56:51,808 --> 01:56:55,972
I did... write this letter
before I got married.

873
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:01,745
But never sent it,
thinking you had your own worries.

874
01:57:02,886 --> 01:57:04,513
How are you, brother?

875
01:57:05,722 --> 01:57:08,520
Me? I am well.

876
01:57:09,292 --> 01:57:11,760
Just wandering about
without kingdom or home.

877
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:15,791
Never mind me.
I was worried about you all along.

878
01:57:18,802 --> 01:57:21,862
Brother, I am happy here.

879
01:57:22,472 --> 01:57:24,804
Happy? What do you mean?

880
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:27,540
You were forced to marry
and you say you're happy?

881
01:57:27,878 --> 01:57:30,005
It's not as you think.

882
01:57:30,614 --> 01:57:35,017
The Emperor did not convert me.
He even built a temple for me.

883
01:57:35,886 --> 01:57:36,853
What?

884
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:40,588
I knew nothing of this.

885
01:57:42,025 --> 01:57:47,122
I am saddened by
what you have endured, brother.

886
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:16,653
One thing still bothers me.

887
01:58:18,328 --> 01:58:21,923
If you didn't send me the letter,
then who did?

888
01:58:24,701 --> 01:58:27,135
Arrest him!

889
01:58:30,507 --> 01:58:32,168
The Emperor?

890
01:58:42,252 --> 01:58:44,220
So this was a trap set up by you!

891
01:58:46,423 --> 01:58:47,890
You betrayed me, Jodhaa!

892
01:58:48,325 --> 01:58:49,553
No, brother.

893
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,957
That is why you sent the letter.

894
01:58:53,363 --> 01:58:56,799
Don't misunderstand.
I have nothing to do with this.

895
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:02,902
Jodhaa, this rakhi will
always stay on my wrist...

896
01:59:04,374 --> 01:59:06,501
...it will be a reminder
of your treachery!

897
01:59:08,879 --> 01:59:10,369
Brother!

898
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:28,320
Your Majesty!

899
01:59:57,661 --> 02:00:00,459
For his treachery against
the Mughal Empire...

900
02:00:01,264 --> 02:00:03,528
...arrest the traitor Ni'mat!

901
02:00:03,967 --> 02:00:07,698
No, Your Majesty!
Save me, my Empress!

902
02:00:08,805 --> 02:00:13,105
He isn't to be blamed.
He was only following my orders.

903
02:00:18,248 --> 02:00:19,977
May I know...

904
02:00:21,384 --> 02:00:22,715
...what was so important...

905
02:00:25,021 --> 02:00:27,854
...that you saw it fit
to hide it from your husband...

906
02:00:28,892 --> 02:00:34,262
...and sneak out in the
middle of the night to meet a stranger.

907
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:39,163
Who was he?

908
02:00:40,203 --> 02:00:41,693
The Prince of Ajabgarh?

909
02:00:43,974 --> 02:00:45,498
The Prince of Ajabgarh?

910
02:00:45,742 --> 02:00:49,803
- But...
- You have betrayed me!

911
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:53,080
- Betrayed?
- Yes!

912
02:00:55,018 --> 02:00:57,384
Elder Mother had warned me.

913
02:00:58,521 --> 02:01:01,422
It is not me, but Maham Anga,
who has betrayed you!

914
02:01:02,259 --> 02:01:07,026
How can she ever betray me?
She has nurtured and raised me.

915
02:01:07,864 --> 02:01:11,356
Probably that's the reason,
I too have shown her respect.

916
02:01:12,969 --> 02:01:17,736
But the same Maham Anga
has tried to keep us apart.

917
02:01:18,975 --> 02:01:22,411
She planted a vile seed of doubt
in your mind against me.

918
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:26,381
- What would you call her, Your Majesty!
- Silence!

919
02:01:28,852 --> 02:01:31,685
I will not tolerate
a word against Elder Mother.

920
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:36,657
Just as you will not entertain
a word against her...

921
02:01:37,894 --> 02:01:41,955
...I too cannot hear a word
against my integrity and honour.

922
02:01:47,904 --> 02:01:49,701
How unfortunate I am!

923
02:01:50,473 --> 02:01:55,433
Just when I had started to find
love, trust and happiness...

924
02:01:56,947 --> 02:01:58,938
...why did this have to happen?

925
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:07,886
Since I am accused of treason, you may
as well let me know my punishment.

926
02:02:09,492 --> 02:02:12,290
You will go back to your family!

927
02:02:18,501 --> 02:02:21,299
Since love must be based on trust...

928
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:25,399
...it would be best...

929
02:02:26,576 --> 02:02:28,043
...that I go.

930
02:02:29,212 --> 02:02:33,478
Prepare the Empress of Hindustan's
departure at once!

931
02:03:01,631 --> 02:03:07,731
<i>People may imagine spring is here</i>

932
02:03:21,431 --> 02:03:26,431
<i>Love too, is bewildered</i>

933
02:03:30,631 --> 02:03:40,931
<i>Fragrance upstages
the flowers in the garden</i>

934
02:03:43,131 --> 02:03:53,731
<i>Hidden in the veil of nature
is a touch of sorrow</i>

935
02:03:56,231 --> 02:04:01,731
<i>The world around us is mellow</i>

936
02:04:03,031 --> 02:04:08,531
<i>Time is slumbering</i>

937
02:04:09,031 --> 02:04:18,031
<i>Lost and forgotten memories
fill my heart</i>

938
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:24,331
What have you done?

939
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:29,631
You consider him your son,
and yet tried to wreck his marriage?

940
02:04:29,831 --> 02:04:32,031
I was only doing my duty.

941
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:36,231
Duty? I tolerated your misdeeds,
you pass off as duty.

942
02:04:36,431 --> 02:04:38,931
I have never interfered.

943
02:04:39,231 --> 02:04:42,631
But enough is enough!
This is a limit!

944
02:04:43,231 --> 02:04:45,531
He wasn't the Prince of Ajabgarh...

945
02:04:45,831 --> 02:04:47,731
...but Jodhaa's brother, Sujamal.

946
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:49,831
What?

947
02:04:52,131 --> 02:04:53,331
What about that letter?

948
02:04:53,631 --> 02:04:56,331
Are you even aware of
what was written?

949
02:04:56,931 --> 02:05:00,831
Jodhaa wrote it before she got married,
but never sent it.

950
02:05:01,331 --> 02:05:05,931
And Maham Anga used the letter
to poison your mind against her.

951
02:05:08,631 --> 02:05:10,531
I can't believe it, Mother!

952
02:05:14,331 --> 02:05:15,831
Elder Mother, is it true?

953
02:05:17,231 --> 02:05:21,131
This is a blatant lie.
I have been wrongly accused!

954
02:05:22,031 --> 02:05:24,031
I'm innocent, Empress!

955
02:05:24,231 --> 02:05:26,531
Silence, Maham Anga!

956
02:05:27,731 --> 02:05:31,731
Lower your voice
when speaking to my mother!

957
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:40,231
Answer my question.

958
02:05:42,431 --> 02:05:45,231
Is it true or not?

959
02:05:48,431 --> 02:05:50,631
Salima will answer this question.

960
02:05:51,531 --> 02:05:52,631
Salima!

961
02:06:00,731 --> 02:06:01,931
Speak up, Salima.

962
02:06:09,531 --> 02:06:11,431
Have no fear. Tell us the truth!

963
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:18,131
Your Majesty, I brought it to
respected Maham Anga's notice...

964
02:06:18,931 --> 02:06:21,731
...that the letter was written
before marriage...

965
02:06:22,331 --> 02:06:28,331
...but she threatened me and
used the letter for her own ends.

966
02:06:31,931 --> 02:06:33,631
O God!

967
02:06:35,131 --> 02:06:37,331
I have made a terrible mistake...

968
02:06:38,831 --> 02:06:40,731
What have I done?

969
02:06:41,631 --> 02:06:43,131
What have I done?

970
02:06:49,631 --> 02:06:52,031
I gave you the status of a mother...

971
02:06:56,631 --> 02:06:59,531
...and you poisoned my mind
against Jodhaa?

972
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:06,131
You have broken my trust in you.

973
02:07:07,931 --> 02:07:12,931
You have erased all the good memories...
I had of you!

974
02:07:16,931 --> 02:07:20,031
Is this why I called you 'EIder Mother'?

975
02:07:27,731 --> 02:07:29,931
You have nurtured me all my life.

976
02:07:31,531 --> 02:07:33,931
Only for that, I forgive you!

977
02:07:35,331 --> 02:07:36,831
Nevertheless, from now...

978
02:07:38,431 --> 02:07:41,131
...I will never see your face again.

979
02:08:20,331 --> 02:08:22,631
Bring her back, Jalal!

980
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:26,231
I don't know...

981
02:08:29,031 --> 02:08:30,431
...how I shall face her.

982
02:08:30,931 --> 02:08:34,731
Admitting a mistake
only makes love grow deeper.

983
02:08:35,131 --> 02:08:38,031
I am convinced that Jodhaa will accept.

984
02:09:25,031 --> 02:09:29,331
- Didn't I tell you, he'd come?
- I still can't believe it!

985
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:34,031
Welcome!

986
02:09:35,131 --> 02:09:39,831
It is an honour and a privilege
to have you here in Amer.

987
02:09:51,031 --> 02:09:57,031
May this vermilion mark signify a
strong bond between Mughals and Rajputs!

988
02:09:59,331 --> 02:10:02,931
No matter what he says,
I will not go back.

989
02:10:03,631 --> 02:10:05,831
But are you not going to welcome him?

990
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:09,631
Now wipe the frown off your face
and draw the veil.

991
02:11:02,231 --> 02:11:04,931
Whom do my son-in-law's eyes seek?

992
02:11:07,531 --> 02:11:09,131
We have a custom in Amer.

993
02:11:09,631 --> 02:11:13,531
When a son-in-law
visits for the first time...

994
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:18,731
...he must find his bride
among the women of the palace.

995
02:11:19,231 --> 02:11:24,631
If he succeeds,
he gets to stay in his wife's chamber.

996
02:11:25,531 --> 02:11:29,631
And if he fails,
he has to sleep under the open sky...

997
02:11:30,031 --> 02:11:32,031
...counting the stars!!

998
02:11:35,231 --> 02:11:37,231
Come! Welcome, son-in-law...

999
02:12:54,131 --> 02:12:56,831
So you finally found your Jodhaa!

1000
02:13:13,431 --> 02:13:17,631
- Will you come back with me?
- No, I'm not going anywhere!

1001
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:29,131
I have come to take you home.

1002
02:13:30,131 --> 02:13:31,631
Why do you now refuse?

1003
02:13:32,931 --> 02:13:35,431
I will not go back to Agra!

1004
02:13:44,331 --> 02:13:49,831
It feels strange being here,
alone with you, in this chamber.

1005
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:52,731
It is strange!

1006
02:13:53,631 --> 02:13:55,331
But I have a solution...

1007
02:13:56,831 --> 02:13:58,331
And what might that be?

1008
02:14:08,931 --> 02:14:11,131
This is too harsh a punishment.

1009
02:14:14,031 --> 02:14:16,231
Now I cannot see my face...

1010
02:14:17,931 --> 02:14:20,231
...reflected in your eyes!

1011
02:14:23,331 --> 02:14:24,531
This is unjust!

1012
02:14:26,431 --> 02:14:27,531
Jodhaa...

1013
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:47,531
Jodhaa, I have expressed regret.

1014
02:14:48,731 --> 02:14:51,231
You can't win me
by just expressing regret.

1015
02:14:52,131 --> 02:14:53,931
But you will never understand this.

1016
02:14:58,131 --> 02:14:58,931
I don't understand?

1017
02:14:59,631 --> 02:15:01,131
No, you don't!

1018
02:15:02,931 --> 02:15:07,231
You know how to wage war and conquer.
But do not know how to rule.

1019
02:15:07,831 --> 02:15:08,831
What did you say?

1020
02:15:09,231 --> 02:15:13,831
That you have only conquered me...

1021
02:15:14,431 --> 02:15:16,031
...but not won my heart yet.

1022
02:15:18,031 --> 02:15:22,231
This is unfair.
I have fulfilled your every wish...

1023
02:15:23,531 --> 02:15:25,631
...I have respected
every demand of yours...

1024
02:15:26,431 --> 02:15:28,431
...I have carried out
my duties as a husband!

1025
02:15:29,431 --> 02:15:30,731
If that were true...

1026
02:15:31,331 --> 02:15:35,031
...you'd never have sent me away
without hearing my side.

1027
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:37,231
But this...

1028
02:15:39,031 --> 02:15:42,431
But try and understand that
considering the circumstances...

1029
02:15:42,731 --> 02:15:44,931
...a misunderstanding was inevitable.

1030
02:15:48,331 --> 02:15:51,631
But you should have at least tried
to know what really happened.

1031
02:15:54,231 --> 02:15:57,631
But the truth is that,
you are far removed from reality...

1032
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:01,131
...you do not know how to win hearts.

1033
02:16:01,931 --> 02:16:05,831
To do that, you need
to look into their minds...

1034
02:16:06,831 --> 02:16:10,931
...discover their
little pleasures and sorrows.

1035
02:16:11,631 --> 02:16:15,031
And win their trust.
Be one with their heartbeat!

1036
02:16:15,731 --> 02:16:19,531
And the day you will
succeed in doing that...

1037
02:16:20,231 --> 02:16:22,731
...you will rule my heart!

1038
02:17:10,431 --> 02:17:12,431
Forgive me, Jodhaa.

1039
02:18:48,031 --> 02:18:49,031
Excellent!

1040
02:18:51,131 --> 02:18:53,131
Now, if you defeat me...

1041
02:18:55,331 --> 02:18:57,631
...you can gladly stay back in Amer.

1042
02:19:03,531 --> 02:19:05,431
And if I win...

1043
02:19:06,831 --> 02:19:09,231
...then you will have
to return with me.

1044
02:19:12,531 --> 02:19:13,531
Raise your sword!

1045
02:19:18,631 --> 02:19:20,031
Raise it!

1046
02:19:38,731 --> 02:19:39,931
Excellent!

1047
02:20:17,031 --> 02:20:18,331
Allah be praised!

1048
02:20:34,131 --> 02:20:35,631
Empress of Hindustan...

1049
02:20:37,031 --> 02:20:39,031
...do not forget,
I am your husband!

1050
02:20:59,631 --> 02:21:01,331
Disperse!

1051
02:21:06,031 --> 02:21:07,731
O Allah...

1052
02:21:11,231 --> 02:21:13,531
There is a saying in Persian:

1053
02:21:14,731 --> 02:21:19,331
<i>'Why seek Paradise?
It is before me now! '</i>

1054
02:22:35,531 --> 02:22:37,331
I will not go back!

1055
02:23:24,631 --> 02:23:25,731
Princess!

1056
02:23:28,731 --> 02:23:29,731
I won!

1057
02:23:31,831 --> 02:23:35,431
This is unfair. Gira interrupted...

1058
02:23:35,831 --> 02:23:40,731
Regardless! I won and you lost.

1059
02:23:43,631 --> 02:23:47,831
Gira, could you not have waited?
You made me lose.

1060
02:23:48,231 --> 02:23:51,931
Forgive me. An envoy brings
a message for His Majesty.

1061
02:23:53,431 --> 02:23:55,131
Ask him to wait.

1062
02:23:57,931 --> 02:23:59,731
Forgive her, Jodhaa.

1063
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:04,531
Remember, a moment's distraction can
prove fatal in battle and can bring...

1064
02:24:04,631 --> 02:24:08,231
'... defeat or death.' I know!

1065
02:24:12,131 --> 02:24:14,431
Where did you learn to duel so well?

1066
02:24:16,631 --> 02:24:18,531
My brother Sujamal taught me the art!

1067
02:24:19,031 --> 02:24:20,931
He has taught you well.

1068
02:24:21,931 --> 02:24:23,931
I was lucky to have won.

1069
02:24:26,031 --> 02:24:27,831
Now prepare to leave.

1070
02:24:32,831 --> 02:24:34,331
I will not go.

1071
02:24:36,531 --> 02:24:38,531
Now this goes against your protocol.

1072
02:24:39,031 --> 02:24:41,331
Being the Empress of Hindustan,
you cannot go back on your word.

1073
02:24:41,531 --> 02:24:43,731
I do as I please.

1074
02:24:44,131 --> 02:24:47,031
- I will not go!
- And now, I won't force you.

1075
02:24:47,631 --> 02:24:49,331
Do you know why?

1076
02:24:53,831 --> 02:24:56,931
My heart says,
you will come on your own accord.

1077
02:25:00,531 --> 02:25:02,131
You will come.

1078
02:25:03,031 --> 02:25:07,231
Because by then...
I would have won your heart!

1079
02:25:27,631 --> 02:25:30,331
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

1080
02:25:30,831 --> 02:25:34,031
Roaming in the bazaar
without guards is dangerous.

1081
02:25:34,131 --> 02:25:36,331
Do not worry.
No one will recognize me.

1082
02:25:36,831 --> 02:25:40,331
I'm doing it since there's a difference
between conquering and ruling!

1083
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:43,531
To win the hearts of people,
one must look into their minds.

1084
02:25:44,131 --> 02:25:47,731
Another thing... do not address me
as 'Your Majesty'.

1085
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:50,231
Then what do I call you?

1086
02:25:50,831 --> 02:25:52,631
Call me Jalal.

1087
02:26:09,831 --> 02:26:12,031
Where do we start, Mahesh Das?

1088
02:26:17,531 --> 02:26:20,831
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1089
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:36,731
Will your eyes only feast or
do you even intend to buy anything?

1090
02:26:37,431 --> 02:26:41,531
- How much is the grain?
- Three coins for a pound.

1091
02:26:43,131 --> 02:26:47,131
- The barley?
- Two coins for a pound. Shall I pack it?

1092
02:26:47,631 --> 02:26:50,231
We'll buy wheat instead.

1093
02:26:50,731 --> 02:26:55,531
- Wheat? Two coins for a pound.
- Two coins for a pound?!

1094
02:26:56,131 --> 02:27:00,431
What can we do?
The landowners decide the price.

1095
02:27:00,731 --> 02:27:02,331
His prices are sky high.

1096
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:05,531
Looks like you too
have dropped from the sky!

1097
02:27:05,731 --> 02:27:09,131
You're pockets are empty and
you want to buy Agra bazaar?

1098
02:27:09,231 --> 02:27:11,731
Take it or leave it!

1099
02:27:12,331 --> 02:27:15,031
Insolent fool! Do you know with whom
you have an audience?

1100
02:27:15,431 --> 02:27:17,831
An audience? Move on!

1101
02:27:18,031 --> 02:27:20,631
Let's go. We'll try the next shop.

1102
02:27:23,531 --> 02:27:24,631
Move on!

1103
02:27:26,531 --> 02:27:29,631
Get your fresh tobacco here!

1104
02:27:33,231 --> 02:27:35,631
Silence! Arrest him!!

1105
02:27:40,531 --> 02:27:41,731
What's going on there?

1106
02:27:44,231 --> 02:27:45,431
Master, forgive me.

1107
02:27:45,631 --> 02:27:48,631
- We must go back.
- No, wait.

1108
02:27:49,631 --> 02:27:50,631
This is what I've come to see.

1109
02:27:50,731 --> 02:27:55,531
- This Mughal officer is unjust.
- Yes, indeed! Too much atrocity!

1110
02:27:56,631 --> 02:27:58,831
But he is a loyal officer
of the Mughal Court...

1111
02:28:00,731 --> 02:28:02,831
- Are you new here?
- Yes.

1112
02:28:03,331 --> 02:28:05,931
Another blind man
in the land of the blind!

1113
02:28:06,231 --> 02:28:08,731
Can't you see how these foreigners behave?

1114
02:28:09,131 --> 02:28:12,031
- What foreigners?
- These Mughals!

1115
02:28:12,131 --> 02:28:14,231
They are all outsiders.

1116
02:28:14,531 --> 02:28:16,731
The Emperor's court is full of them.

1117
02:28:17,931 --> 02:28:20,931
I have heard that,
the Emperor is a very good man.

1118
02:28:21,831 --> 02:28:26,131
He is doing a lot for the common man.
Why not complain to him directly?

1119
02:28:26,431 --> 02:28:29,331
Forget it, Mister!
We can only complain to our near ones.

1120
02:28:29,731 --> 02:28:31,431
And we do not believe that
the Emperor is a Hindustani.

1121
02:28:31,831 --> 02:28:35,331
The Mughals or any others,
they are all outsiders!

1122
02:28:35,631 --> 02:28:39,931
Did you know our Emperor
was born in Amarkot...

1123
02:28:40,231 --> 02:28:42,731
...in a Hindu Rajput home?
And raised here too?

1124
02:28:43,131 --> 02:28:46,431
So how can you call him a foreigner?
He is as much an Indian as you are.

1125
02:28:46,631 --> 02:28:51,131
Really? If he is an Indian then
what has he done for the common man?

1126
02:28:52,631 --> 02:28:55,831
If this Emperor cares so much then...

1127
02:28:56,431 --> 02:28:58,531
...why doesn't he abolish the Pilgrim Tax?

1128
02:28:58,931 --> 02:29:00,131
The Pilgrim Tax?

1129
02:29:00,931 --> 02:29:04,031
Looks like you're new
not only to Agra but to the country!

1130
02:29:04,631 --> 02:29:08,331
Don't we all Hindus have to pay
Pilgrim Tax when we go on pilgrimage?

1131
02:29:10,831 --> 02:29:13,131
It does not worry the rich.

1132
02:29:13,831 --> 02:29:20,531
But the common man can't pay
such taxes. So we suffer...

1133
02:29:21,431 --> 02:29:24,531
...but what's the use?
Nobody pays any attention.

1134
02:29:26,531 --> 02:29:29,231
Let's go!

1135
02:29:34,231 --> 02:29:37,531
Coming here incognito has proved
most useful, Your Majesty.

1136
02:29:37,931 --> 02:29:40,831
Now we know how people
perceive the Mughal rule.

1137
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:43,431
What is this Pilgrim Tax?

1138
02:29:45,631 --> 02:29:50,031
When the Hindus go on pilgrimage
to pray to their Gods...

1139
02:29:50,831 --> 02:29:54,031
...they have to pay a tax
to the Mughal Treasury.

1140
02:29:55,231 --> 02:29:56,731
Do you also pay this tax?

1141
02:29:58,431 --> 02:30:01,531
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- So why didn't you object?

1142
02:30:03,831 --> 02:30:08,331
This is outrageous.
A tax to offer prayers to God?

1143
02:30:09,131 --> 02:30:13,931
I never thought about it.
This tax has been collected for years.

1144
02:30:16,331 --> 02:30:18,231
How do we change this?

1145
02:30:38,831 --> 02:30:40,131
To all those present!

1146
02:30:41,231 --> 02:30:43,731
I want to make an important announcement -

1147
02:30:45,431 --> 02:30:49,231
After much deliberation,
I have come to realize...

1148
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:53,731
...that asking Hindus to pay
a tax when they go on pilgrimage...

1149
02:30:54,831 --> 02:30:57,731
...is akin to weighing God's glory
in coins.

1150
02:30:59,831 --> 02:31:04,331
Therefore, I have decided that
from today...

1151
02:31:05,631 --> 02:31:08,331
...the Pilgrim Tax will be
abolished forever!

1152
02:31:12,731 --> 02:31:15,831
Your Majesty, it is
a wonderful thought.

1153
02:31:17,231 --> 02:31:20,731
May I be permitted to comment?

1154
02:31:22,031 --> 02:31:23,331
You may.

1155
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:25,431
What is this injustice?

1156
02:31:27,631 --> 02:31:29,331
Have you forgotten us?

1157
02:31:30,831 --> 02:31:33,831
We, too, have worked hard
to build the Mughal Empire.

1158
02:31:35,331 --> 02:31:40,031
Our sweat has also cemented
the bricks to build the Empire.

1159
02:31:41,531 --> 02:31:47,431
We are also your advisors.
This is an astonishing decision!

1160
02:31:48,831 --> 02:31:51,731
Before deciding, why
wasn't our counsel taken?

1161
02:31:52,131 --> 02:31:55,231
I felt no need,
respected Saadir Adaasi!

1162
02:31:57,831 --> 02:32:04,031
Imposing or abolishing a tax is a
ruler's decision. The throne decides.

1163
02:32:06,031 --> 02:32:08,231
I'm not taking any step against Islam.

1164
02:32:09,631 --> 02:32:13,731
It is an administrative decision.
Not a religious one!

1165
02:32:15,031 --> 02:32:17,231
If that be so...

1166
02:32:18,831 --> 02:32:21,431
...then could the Finance Minister...

1167
02:32:22,831 --> 02:32:25,731
...Todarmalji kindly explain
the impact on the Royal Treasury?

1168
02:32:30,431 --> 02:32:34,431
Your Majesty, this decision will
definitely impact the Royal Treasury.

1169
02:32:34,931 --> 02:32:36,531
The Royal Treasury!

1170
02:32:38,531 --> 02:32:41,431
I'd like to know what
is this Royal Treasury?

1171
02:32:44,031 --> 02:32:45,631
What is this Treasury?

1172
02:32:47,331 --> 02:32:53,231
We, Mughals,
are not like the other invaders...

1173
02:32:54,131 --> 02:32:55,931
...who plunder and loot
Hindustan of its riches...

1174
02:32:57,631 --> 02:33:00,031
...and fill the coffers.

1175
02:33:02,031 --> 02:33:03,931
This is my country.

1176
02:33:04,831 --> 02:33:07,431
And I will not allow anyone
to ravage it!

1177
02:33:10,731 --> 02:33:12,931
I want my people to know...

1178
02:33:14,931 --> 02:33:19,131
...that regardless of their religion,
I will embrace them.

1179
02:33:21,431 --> 02:33:26,031
A coin rings out only when it falls,
not when picked up.

1180
02:33:27,131 --> 02:33:31,431
I request you not to be emotional
and make unwise decisions.

1181
02:33:36,131 --> 02:33:38,031
Ever since I was a child...

1182
02:33:39,731 --> 02:33:42,731
...others have made decisions for me.

1183
02:33:44,531 --> 02:33:47,231
I've always been told what must be done.

1184
02:33:48,931 --> 02:33:51,131
I want to be free now...

1185
02:33:53,731 --> 02:33:55,831
...and do as I see fit!

1186
02:34:00,931 --> 02:34:02,331
Todarmalji!

1187
02:34:02,931 --> 02:34:04,631
Let it be known...

1188
02:34:05,031 --> 02:34:08,831
...that from today,
the Pilgrim Tax is forever abolished!

1189
02:34:10,231 --> 02:34:12,831
Let the order be carried out!

1190
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:17,231
Long live!

1191
02:34:37,931 --> 02:34:40,231
<i>O great and magnificent Emperor</i>

1192
02:34:42,631 --> 02:34:44,831
<i>O great and magnificent Emperor</i>

1193
02:34:45,131 --> 02:34:47,031
<i>Ruler of Royal Decree</i>

1194
02:34:47,531 --> 02:34:50,531
<i>May your life be everlasting</i>

1195
02:34:52,231 --> 02:34:56,831
<i>Words alone cannot praise you
You are the cornerstone of Hindustan</i>

1196
02:34:57,031 --> 02:35:01,231
<i>Hindustan is your life
And you are the life of Hindustan</i>

1197
02:35:01,831 --> 02:35:05,931
<i>We welcome you in our hearts!</i>

1198
02:35:11,031 --> 02:35:14,631
Kingdom of Virat's salutation!

1199
02:35:15,831 --> 02:35:18,031
<i>O great and magnificent Emperor</i>

1200
02:35:18,131 --> 02:35:20,231
<i>Ruler of Royal Decree</i>

1201
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:24,831
<i>May your life be everlasting</i>

1202
02:35:25,131 --> 02:35:27,431
<i>Words alone cannot praise you</i>

1203
02:35:27,631 --> 02:35:29,831
<i>You are the cornerstone of Hindustan</i>

1204
02:35:30,031 --> 02:35:32,331
<i>Hindustan is your life</i>

1205
02:35:32,531 --> 02:35:34,331
<i>And you are the life of Hindustan!</i>

1206
02:35:34,631 --> 02:35:39,031
<i>We welcome you in our hearts</i>

1207
02:36:09,131 --> 02:36:12,231
The kingdom of
Shimalgarh's salutation!

1208
02:36:24,031 --> 02:36:26,031
<i>In every town</i>

1209
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:28,031
<i>In every courtyard</i>

1210
02:36:28,831 --> 02:36:30,531
<i>Love abounds</i>

1211
02:36:31,231 --> 02:36:32,831
<i>In every heart</i>

1212
02:36:52,431 --> 02:36:54,131
<i>Our victory...</i>

1213
02:36:54,731 --> 02:36:56,631
<i>... lies in the Emperor</i>

1214
02:36:57,131 --> 02:36:59,031
<i>A wind of peace...</i>

1215
02:36:59,531 --> 02:37:01,331
<i>... blows across the land</i>

1216
02:37:11,331 --> 02:37:15,531
<i>We welcome you in our hearts</i>

1217
02:37:20,631 --> 02:37:25,031
<i>O great and magnificent Emperor
Ruler of Royal Decree</i>

1218
02:37:27,731 --> 02:37:34,131
Empress of Hindustan,
Jodhaabai has arrived in Diwaan-E-Aam!

1219
02:38:08,831 --> 02:38:12,331
I am overwhelmed with
happiness to see you here.

1220
02:38:13,031 --> 02:38:14,631
I had to come.

1221
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:18,331
After all, you have won my heart!

1222
02:38:37,631 --> 02:38:38,831
Your Majesty...

1223
02:38:39,231 --> 02:38:43,331
...today your people have
wholly accepted you in their hearts.

1224
02:38:44,831 --> 02:38:48,431
And hence, your subjects, most humbly...

1225
02:38:48,931 --> 02:38:50,431
...wish to bestow on you...

1226
02:38:50,931 --> 02:38:52,931
...the title of... 'Akbar'!

1227
02:38:53,531 --> 02:38:56,031
Jalaluddin Mohammad 'Akbar'!

1228
02:39:03,031 --> 02:39:05,531
The title pleases me very much.

1229
02:39:07,031 --> 02:39:09,731
I accept it with gratitude.

1230
02:39:11,031 --> 02:39:15,831
- Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!
- Long live!

1231
02:39:16,231 --> 02:39:17,631
Akbar!

1232
02:39:18,531 --> 02:39:23,031
<i>Every heart bears witness
to our Emperor's generosity</i>

1233
02:39:23,331 --> 02:39:30,231
<i>Wherever he treads,
he showers gold on his path</i>

1234
02:39:39,731 --> 02:39:44,231
<i>We welcome you in our hearts</i>

1235
02:40:07,931 --> 02:40:11,531
<i>Your religion is love</i>

1236
02:40:12,731 --> 02:40:16,331
<i>You rule many hearts</i>

1237
02:40:26,831 --> 02:40:30,431
<i>No praise can describe you</i>

1238
02:40:31,531 --> 02:40:36,331
<i>You are the confluence of all traditions</i>

1239
02:40:50,531 --> 02:40:54,831
<i>We welcome you in our hearts</i>

1240
02:40:59,631 --> 02:41:01,931
<i>O great and magnificent Emperor!</i>

1241
02:42:47,531 --> 02:42:49,531
The Emperor has been struck by an arrow!

1242
02:42:53,431 --> 02:42:54,931
There he is!

1243
02:44:12,831 --> 02:44:17,831
Allow His Majesty to rest. We will
keep you informed of his progress.

1244
02:44:49,231 --> 02:44:52,631
'I am very pleased. No praise
will do justice to your work.'

1245
02:44:52,931 --> 02:44:55,731
'Delhi is within our reach now.
Saadir Adaasi'

1246
02:45:00,031 --> 02:45:04,031
The arrow's poison is spreading.

1247
02:45:05,431 --> 02:45:07,931
His temperature isn't coming down.

1248
02:45:21,831 --> 02:45:24,631
Who could have attempted
to kill Jalaluddin?

1249
02:45:25,031 --> 02:45:29,931
- Never mind! My concern is Rajputana.
- Meaning?

1250
02:45:30,531 --> 02:45:33,531
If Jalaluddin survives...

1251
02:45:34,731 --> 02:45:38,631
...the Mughal army will spare no one.

1252
02:45:39,831 --> 02:45:41,031
And if he dies...

1253
02:45:41,931 --> 02:45:45,331
...the Afghans and Uzbeks
won't let this opportunity slip by.

1254
02:45:46,331 --> 02:45:48,231
That's so true, Ranaji.

1255
02:45:48,831 --> 02:45:51,331
It will be wise to ignore
the needs of others...

1256
02:45:51,731 --> 02:45:53,631
...and safeguard our own provinces.

1257
02:45:54,231 --> 02:45:55,531
Sujamal...

1258
02:45:56,831 --> 02:45:58,631
...we would've helped you...

1259
02:46:00,231 --> 02:46:02,231
...but circumstances have changed.

1260
02:46:03,631 --> 02:46:07,931
And anyway,
your struggle is no more political...

1261
02:46:08,331 --> 02:46:10,131
...it has become a family feud.

1262
02:46:11,931 --> 02:46:15,331
You must work alone to regain
your share of Amer's throne!

1263
02:46:16,631 --> 02:46:20,631
We can only offer you
our best wishes, nothing more!

1264
02:46:34,731 --> 02:46:37,231
Jodhaa, his condition is worsening.

1265
02:46:51,131 --> 02:46:52,831
O Lord Krishna...

1266
02:47:23,331 --> 02:47:25,731
The Emperor has
regained consciousness!

1267
02:47:42,331 --> 02:47:44,231
May His Majesty live long!

1268
02:47:48,231 --> 02:47:50,331
May God give you a long life!

1269
02:47:50,831 --> 02:47:53,331
- Please rest.
- The Emperor is well again.

1270
02:47:53,731 --> 02:47:56,731
The Emperor is well again?
The Emperor is well again!

1271
02:48:03,531 --> 02:48:08,931
Jalal, countless thanks to Allah
for giving you a new life.

1272
02:48:10,431 --> 02:48:11,531
Mother...

1273
02:48:12,331 --> 02:48:16,331
Don't strain, son. You need rest.

1274
02:48:51,931 --> 02:48:55,831
Turn the nib and draw a thicker line...

1275
02:49:06,631 --> 02:49:08,331
Why did you call me here?

1276
02:49:09,131 --> 02:49:11,431
I will show you why.
Disperse!

1277
02:49:12,831 --> 02:49:14,331
Please be seated.

1278
02:49:26,731 --> 02:49:28,631
I have made something special for you.

1279
02:49:29,431 --> 02:49:31,231
I'm learning calligraphy.

1280
02:49:31,631 --> 02:49:35,031
These are the first words
I have learnt to write.

1281
02:49:36,931 --> 02:49:40,431
Allah be praised. It is beautiful!

1282
02:49:43,431 --> 02:49:45,831
This calligraphy... this writing...

1283
02:49:47,031 --> 02:49:49,731
...whatever is written, is beautiful.

1284
02:49:51,631 --> 02:49:55,331
Since its your writing,
why don't you read it aloud.

1285
02:49:56,131 --> 02:49:58,631
No, you must read it yourself.

1286
02:50:04,231 --> 02:50:06,331
There's something
you must know, Jodhaa.

1287
02:50:08,431 --> 02:50:10,031
The truth is...

1288
02:50:11,431 --> 02:50:13,531
...I cannot read or write!

1289
02:50:15,431 --> 02:50:21,131
The battlefield never allowed me
to learn, how to read or write.

1290
02:50:24,831 --> 02:50:26,331
So now will you read it?

1291
02:50:30,431 --> 02:50:32,231
You won't agree this way.

1292
02:50:35,831 --> 02:50:37,131
It's an order!

1293
02:50:40,131 --> 02:50:41,031
Read it!

1294
02:50:41,931 --> 02:50:44,531
A wife does not take
her husband's name.

1295
02:50:51,531 --> 02:50:53,231
Look into my eyes and say it.

1296
02:50:58,531 --> 02:51:05,531
Jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar.

1297
02:51:14,231 --> 02:51:16,031
I want to ask you something...

1298
02:51:17,731 --> 02:51:19,031
Please do...

1299
02:51:20,231 --> 02:51:23,731
Not here. Come with me.

1300
02:51:49,931 --> 02:51:52,531
What was it that you wanted to ask?

1301
02:51:54,331 --> 02:51:56,531
I am waiting for the right moment...

1302
02:52:23,131 --> 02:52:24,831
Do you love me?

1303
02:52:38,431 --> 02:52:39,931
Yes, I do.

1304
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:42,231
And you?

1305
02:52:43,431 --> 02:52:45,831
I love you deeply!

1306
02:52:55,531 --> 02:52:59,631
<i>In the folds of these moments</i>

1307
02:53:01,931 --> 02:53:06,631
<i>Is a relationship so pure</i>

1308
02:53:08,331 --> 02:53:15,931
<i>Like a prayer of
love the angels recite</i>

1309
02:53:18,031 --> 02:53:23,031
<i>The earth is silent
The sky is perplexed</i>

1310
02:53:24,631 --> 02:53:29,631
<i>There is light shining from earth to sky</i>

1311
02:53:33,431 --> 02:53:40,931
<i>Songs fill the stillness.
There is beauty in your every gesture</i>

1312
02:53:41,631 --> 02:53:45,931
<i>There is love floating in the air</i>

1313
02:54:39,631 --> 02:54:42,331
<i>What love is this?</i>

1314
02:54:42,831 --> 02:54:45,031
<i>What dream is this?</i>

1315
02:54:46,331 --> 02:54:52,231
<i>What flood of feeling is this?</i>

1316
02:55:05,431 --> 02:55:14,631
<i>The days have changed. And nights
too. The meaning of life has changed</i>

1317
02:55:16,531 --> 02:55:22,031
<i>In the folds of these moments...</i>

1318
02:55:54,931 --> 02:56:02,131
<i>What has time done to me?
Changed my very being</i>

1319
02:56:04,531 --> 02:56:11,831
<i>You have won me I found you</i>

1320
02:56:14,131 --> 02:56:20,031
<i>Melting like two gentle melodies</i>

1321
02:56:20,531 --> 02:56:26,531
<i>A rhythm, not slow, not fast</i>

1322
02:56:27,031 --> 02:56:29,531
<i>In the flame of fire</i>

1323
02:56:29,831 --> 02:56:38,731
<i>Our bodies and souls
burn in the flame of love</i>

1324
02:56:58,531 --> 02:57:04,331
<i>In my garden of dreams</i>

1325
02:57:06,031 --> 02:57:12,831
<i>Spring came only because of you</i>

1326
02:57:14,031 --> 02:57:20,531
<i>The flowers had my colours</i>

1327
02:57:21,531 --> 02:57:29,631
<i>But their fragrance has come from you</i>

1328
02:57:32,431 --> 02:57:38,531
<i>What desire and emotion is this?</i>

1329
02:57:39,231 --> 02:57:44,731
<i>Why is the heart so restless?
Why is the heart so impatient?</i>

1330
02:57:58,331 --> 02:58:07,331
<i>The days have changed. And nights
too. The meaning of life has changed</i>

1331
02:58:09,431 --> 02:58:14,131
<i>In the folds of these moments...</i>

1332
02:59:00,531 --> 02:59:05,531
We missed our last chance.
That incompetent marksman!

1333
02:59:07,031 --> 02:59:11,431
- You mean?
- Yes! It was I, who sent the assassin.

1334
02:59:12,531 --> 02:59:15,331
Be gone! Our efforts have gone waste.

1335
02:59:17,331 --> 02:59:19,731
I'm glad my sister is not widowed.

1336
02:59:20,431 --> 02:59:24,531
Sujamal! What's with you? You don't
even know whose side you are on.

1337
02:59:25,531 --> 02:59:26,931
Greed has blinded you!

1338
02:59:27,531 --> 02:59:31,731
I want my rightful share of Amer!
You don't know which side to take!

1339
02:59:32,731 --> 02:59:35,231
The Emperor is your brother-in-law,
Sharifuddin Hussain.

1340
02:59:35,731 --> 02:59:38,831
Personal relations cannot
interfere with my goals.

1341
02:59:39,931 --> 02:59:42,831
You will soon discover
I am on your side...

1342
02:59:43,831 --> 02:59:46,131
...I want to see you
on Amer's throne...

1343
02:59:47,231 --> 02:59:51,631
...and you will see me
on Delhi's throne. Our pact is firm!

1344
02:59:52,831 --> 02:59:55,231
We have only one option now.

1345
02:59:55,931 --> 03:00:00,031
Attack Amer at once!
We won't get a better opportunity.

1346
03:00:02,731 --> 03:00:04,231
Are you with me?

1347
03:00:09,931 --> 03:00:10,931
Yes.

1348
03:00:16,631 --> 03:00:18,231
Sharifuddin Hussain!

1349
03:00:32,831 --> 03:00:35,831
Jalal knows you were behind
the assassination attempt.

1350
03:00:36,331 --> 03:00:41,031
He is furious.
Soldiers are coming for us!

1351
03:00:42,231 --> 03:00:44,231
Have no fear, Saadir Adaasi Sahib.

1352
03:00:45,431 --> 03:00:48,631
Before Agra, we must seize Amer!

1353
03:00:49,131 --> 03:00:50,331
Amer?

1354
03:00:51,931 --> 03:00:54,631
Will Sujamal help you once he is crowned?

1355
03:00:56,731 --> 03:01:00,831
Once Amer is in our hands,
we will finish Sujamal.

1356
03:01:05,331 --> 03:01:08,431
Sharifuddin has planned
an attack on Amer.

1357
03:01:09,031 --> 03:01:11,131
With Sujamal taking on his side.

1358
03:01:12,131 --> 03:01:16,131
End this conflict and
give Sujamal his rightful share.

1359
03:01:19,131 --> 03:01:20,531
Have no fear!

1360
03:01:21,331 --> 03:01:22,331
Yes.

1361
03:01:25,431 --> 03:01:26,831
Now about Sharifuddin...

1362
03:01:29,531 --> 03:01:33,631
...he must be stopped in Merta,
before he reaches Amer.

1363
03:01:58,731 --> 03:01:59,731
Banu?

1364
03:01:59,831 --> 03:02:04,431
Time is scarce.
My husband can kill Sujamal anytime.

1365
03:02:06,431 --> 03:02:09,531
Jodhaa, stop this battle!

1366
03:02:10,331 --> 03:02:13,531
Or else three families
will drown in their own blood.

1367
03:02:16,631 --> 03:02:18,031
We have to go!

1368
03:02:19,531 --> 03:02:22,431
The battlefield is dangerous.
Do not go!

1369
03:02:25,831 --> 03:02:31,231
Todarmalji, my mind is made up.
I must go. Do not worry.

1370
03:02:38,931 --> 03:02:39,831
Halt!

1371
03:02:56,631 --> 03:03:00,931
Your Majesty, dust is rising
on the northern horizon...

1372
03:03:18,631 --> 03:03:19,931
How far are they?

1373
03:03:21,231 --> 03:03:23,331
About three miles.

1374
03:03:28,131 --> 03:03:30,831
Two miles...

1375
03:03:34,231 --> 03:03:36,531
He has arrived too soon.

1376
03:03:40,131 --> 03:03:42,731
One mile!

1377
03:03:50,631 --> 03:03:52,131
Halt!

1378
03:04:14,831 --> 03:04:18,831
Your Majesty,
the archers await your command.

1379
03:04:20,231 --> 03:04:21,331
No!

1380
03:04:23,431 --> 03:04:25,131
I want peace, not war.

1381
03:04:26,431 --> 03:04:29,931
Chughtai Khan! Raise the peace flag!

1382
03:04:32,531 --> 03:04:34,131
Pardon me, Your Majesty...

1383
03:04:34,331 --> 03:04:37,831
...Sharifuddin will misunderstand.
He might assume we are weak.

1384
03:04:39,031 --> 03:04:40,731
That's precisely what I want.

1385
03:04:41,431 --> 03:04:44,531
He must get the wrong idea
and commit a mistake.

1386
03:04:45,431 --> 03:04:47,731
I understood. Raise the peace flag!

1387
03:04:57,831 --> 03:05:01,531
I knew Jalaluddin
would want to negotiate.

1388
03:05:02,231 --> 03:05:03,831
- Manjum Khan!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1389
03:05:04,231 --> 03:05:06,631
Raise our flag in acceptance.

1390
03:05:08,131 --> 03:05:11,331
And set camp here!

1391
03:05:12,231 --> 03:05:14,131
Allah, protect us!

1392
03:05:26,631 --> 03:05:28,431
He deliberately did
not use elephants.

1393
03:05:28,731 --> 03:05:30,831
Because they would
have slowed down his pace.

1394
03:05:30,931 --> 03:05:34,931
Their army has much food.
They can survive a long time.

1395
03:05:35,431 --> 03:05:37,831
They can extend the battle
longer than us.

1396
03:05:42,331 --> 03:05:46,031
Many of our soldiers have been
misguided to join Sharifuddin's army.

1397
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:49,931
We have to bring them back!

1398
03:05:51,831 --> 03:05:56,431
A great battle is won
without shedding a single drop of blood.

1399
03:06:21,931 --> 03:06:23,731
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1400
03:06:24,131 --> 03:06:25,531
Make no mistake.

1401
03:06:26,231 --> 03:06:30,631
You will infiltrate the Emperor's
army and find a way into his tent...

1402
03:06:31,731 --> 03:06:35,831
...and at the opportune moment,
kill the Emperor!

1403
03:06:37,531 --> 03:06:39,731
Also, Jalaluddin has told Bharmal...

1404
03:06:40,331 --> 03:06:43,931
...to grant Sujamal
his rights to Amer's throne.

1405
03:06:44,331 --> 03:06:47,531
Make sure Sujamal
learns nothing of this.

1406
03:06:49,431 --> 03:06:53,931
Once we get rid of the Emperor,
Sujamal comes next.

1407
03:07:03,131 --> 03:07:04,131
Don't ask questions!

1408
03:07:06,131 --> 03:07:07,831
We are withdrawing
our support of Sharifuddin.

1409
03:07:08,231 --> 03:07:09,431
As you command.

1410
03:07:12,031 --> 03:07:15,831
Take our men and fight alongside
Jalaluddin's army.

1411
03:07:17,031 --> 03:07:18,631
Hurry! There is very little time.

1412
03:07:18,731 --> 03:07:20,331
As you command...

1413
03:07:31,031 --> 03:07:32,731
What is the meaning of this?

1414
03:07:36,031 --> 03:07:40,431
- Kumbhaa?
- What happened? Surprised?

1415
03:07:42,331 --> 03:07:46,031
Wasn't he the one you sent to warn Jalaluddin?

1416
03:07:46,531 --> 03:07:49,131
Yes. Because I wanted to stop you.

1417
03:07:50,131 --> 03:07:53,931
If you're a true warrior, then fight
Jalaluddin on the battlefield.

1418
03:07:54,831 --> 03:07:56,131
Not by conspiracy!

1419
03:07:56,631 --> 03:07:57,831
Not by conspiracy?

1420
03:07:59,431 --> 03:08:01,931
When you asked me
to help overthrow King Bharmal...

1421
03:08:02,331 --> 03:08:03,531
...wasn't that a conspiracy?

1422
03:08:05,031 --> 03:08:06,131
Where was your loyalty then?

1423
03:09:21,931 --> 03:09:24,131
On your guard!

1424
03:09:26,231 --> 03:09:27,531
Horsemen approaching!

1425
03:09:30,431 --> 03:09:31,831
It's Sujamal!

1426
03:09:38,131 --> 03:09:39,231
Sujamal!

1427
03:09:59,931 --> 03:10:01,031
Warn the Emperor!

1428
03:10:01,431 --> 03:10:04,331
Bhagwan Das, pull out the arrows!

1429
03:10:23,831 --> 03:10:24,931
Is this Sujamal?

1430
03:10:25,931 --> 03:10:27,031
Yes, Your Majesty.

1431
03:10:31,831 --> 03:10:37,431
Sharifuddin has sent an assassin
disguised as a Royal Guard to kill you.

1432
03:10:44,731 --> 03:10:45,931
Take him away!

1433
03:10:59,131 --> 03:11:01,431
Thank you, Uncle. I am grateful to you.

1434
03:11:02,331 --> 03:11:04,331
You agreed to offer me my share...

1435
03:11:06,131 --> 03:11:10,931
I made a mistake... in judging you

1436
03:11:14,531 --> 03:11:15,531
O Allah!

1437
03:11:17,931 --> 03:11:19,631
Jodhaa will be distraught!

1438
03:11:20,031 --> 03:11:21,931
She betrayed me!

1439
03:11:23,531 --> 03:11:25,631
No, Sujamal. You are mistaken.

1440
03:11:26,631 --> 03:11:29,731
It was I, who mistrusted her,
and wanted you arrested.

1441
03:11:30,631 --> 03:11:33,231
- Jodhaa is not at fault.
- What?

1442
03:12:10,731 --> 03:12:16,731
Jodhaa, I misunderstood you
and doubted your integrity...

1443
03:12:22,231 --> 03:12:23,731
...forgive me...

1444
03:12:25,831 --> 03:12:27,231
Don't say that!

1445
03:12:28,031 --> 03:12:29,831
I misunderstood you...

1446
03:12:31,931 --> 03:12:34,031
...I hurt your honour...

1447
03:12:38,131 --> 03:12:39,631
No, brother!

1448
03:12:45,331 --> 03:12:47,631
May you stay forever happy!

1449
03:12:56,131 --> 03:12:58,931
You are... a great man!

1450
03:13:00,231 --> 03:13:04,031
I was wrong...
to have not understood you.

1451
03:13:05,031 --> 03:13:07,331
What you have done for Jodhaa...

1452
03:13:07,831 --> 03:13:15,631
...will make future generations
honour and respect you...

1453
03:13:45,431 --> 03:13:46,431
Banu...

1454
03:13:47,731 --> 03:13:49,431
...Sharifuddin is a rebel.

1455
03:13:52,131 --> 03:13:55,631
He has committed treason against me.

1456
03:13:57,931 --> 03:14:02,631
The only punishment
for such a man is death.

1457
03:14:04,931 --> 03:14:06,931
Justice demands that I kill him.

1458
03:14:07,531 --> 03:14:11,131
I don't know if he is right or wrong.

1459
03:14:12,331 --> 03:14:15,331
But the need of the hour is...

1460
03:14:16,731 --> 03:14:19,731
...to let your spirit of forgiveness
guide your decision.

1461
03:14:21,231 --> 03:14:24,831
O Allah, what must I do?

1462
03:14:26,731 --> 03:14:29,031
First Adham and now Sharifuddin...

1463
03:14:31,031 --> 03:14:36,531
...why do my close ones have
to fall under the shadow of my sword?

1464
03:14:56,631 --> 03:14:58,431
I expected this behaviour from you...

1465
03:14:59,431 --> 03:15:02,031
...but it is your misfortune
that I survived.

1466
03:15:02,931 --> 03:15:05,931
I could have made you Governor
of other provinces besides Ajmer.

1467
03:15:07,631 --> 03:15:11,831
Rebellion results in only one thing...
and that is bloodshed.

1468
03:15:12,231 --> 03:15:17,031
Didn't you think of 'bloodshed'
when you mercilessly killed Adham Khan?

1469
03:15:17,231 --> 03:15:19,131
That was a different matter,
Sharifuddin.

1470
03:15:19,731 --> 03:15:20,931
How unfair!

1471
03:15:21,631 --> 03:15:25,631
You can't state the 'rules of the game'
and make the moves too.

1472
03:15:26,831 --> 03:15:29,231
This time I decide the rules.

1473
03:15:31,431 --> 03:15:32,231
I am listening.

1474
03:15:32,631 --> 03:15:36,431
If you want, we can prevent bloodshed.

1475
03:15:37,931 --> 03:15:38,831
And how is that?

1476
03:15:39,431 --> 03:15:41,331
Fight me!

1477
03:15:42,831 --> 03:15:44,931
In an arm-to-arm combat.

1478
03:15:46,331 --> 03:15:48,731
If I win,
then Hindustan will be mine.

1479
03:15:52,031 --> 03:15:56,431
And if I lose,
I will leave this country forever!

1480
03:16:01,331 --> 03:16:03,031
I accept!

1481
03:16:06,731 --> 03:16:11,431
This is no way to crush a revolt.
Why did you accept?

1482
03:16:12,431 --> 03:16:14,131
To prevent bloodshed.

1483
03:16:14,631 --> 03:16:20,131
Forgive me, Your Majesty, you forget
Sharifuddin is fierce and vicious.

1484
03:16:21,131 --> 03:16:22,431
I'm aware of that.

1485
03:16:24,131 --> 03:16:25,531
He is a strong man.

1486
03:16:27,131 --> 03:16:30,031
But I won't let Hindustan
fall in the wrong hands!

1487
03:22:10,331 --> 03:22:11,931
Sharifuddin!

1488
03:22:14,931 --> 03:22:17,631
If you were not my brother-in-law...

1489
03:22:19,031 --> 03:22:21,231
...this spear would
have gone through you!

1490
03:22:26,231 --> 03:22:28,431
Only for my sister's sake...

1491
03:22:29,731 --> 03:22:31,431
...I forgive you!

1492
03:22:44,531 --> 03:22:47,131
I am taking back
your provinces from you.

1493
03:22:52,131 --> 03:22:55,631
You will not be allowed to take any
administrative decisions from now on.

1494
03:22:56,631 --> 03:22:57,931
As you command.

1495
03:23:00,831 --> 03:23:05,931
And all your life...
you will remain loyal to me!

1496
03:23:08,031 --> 03:23:09,131
Yes, Your Majesty!

1497
03:23:12,031 --> 03:23:18,831
- Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!
- Long live!

1498
03:23:52,831 --> 03:23:55,231
Respected Saadir Adaasi Sahib...

1499
03:23:56,931 --> 03:23:59,031
...the happiness of life...

1500
03:24:00,231 --> 03:24:03,231
...cannot be divided
on religious grounds.

1501
03:24:10,131 --> 03:24:13,431
I am a follower of Islam... a Muslim!

1502
03:24:14,931 --> 03:24:18,631
And yet, I bow my head,
in respect for every religion.

1503
03:24:21,731 --> 03:24:24,131
The people of my Empire are free...

1504
03:24:25,631 --> 03:24:28,131
...to worship and practice
their religions.

1505
03:24:31,831 --> 03:24:36,631
But it is a shame
you failed to understand me.

1506
03:24:40,331 --> 03:24:42,231
Now it is my wish.

1507
03:24:44,031 --> 03:24:49,131
You dedicate your life to
Allah and travel to Holy Mecca!

1508
03:25:09,831 --> 03:25:12,631
Now I request
the Rajput Empress of Hindustan...

1509
03:25:13,331 --> 03:25:15,231
...to join me here.

1510
03:25:23,531 --> 03:25:27,231
To all present and the Mughal empire,
I say this for the last time -

1511
03:25:29,631 --> 03:25:31,831
Queen Jodhaa is a Hindu Rajput.

1512
03:25:33,531 --> 03:25:34,931
She is my wife.

1513
03:25:35,831 --> 03:25:38,331
And the Empress of Hindustan!

1514
03:25:39,531 --> 03:25:43,231
Any act against her, is an act
against the Mughal empire.

1515
03:25:46,631 --> 03:25:48,931
Let one more thing
be known to one and all!

1516
03:25:50,031 --> 03:25:55,131
Respect and tolerance
of every religion...

1517
03:25:56,231 --> 03:25:58,831
...will make the future
of Hindustan glorious!

1518
03:25:59,631 --> 03:26:01,731
So be it!

1519
03:26:06,231 --> 03:26:07,731
Anything else for the day,
Chughtai Khan?

1520
03:26:08,331 --> 03:26:10,531
Only a prayer for your good health.

1521
03:26:13,831 --> 03:26:16,231
<i>This was the story of Jodhaa Akbar.</i>

1522
03:26:18,131 --> 03:26:20,631
<i>Their love story is
not a part of folklore.</i>

1523
03:26:21,731 --> 03:26:24,031
<i>Nor is their love ever discussed.</i>

1524
03:26:25,531 --> 03:26:29,631
<i>Perhaps, it is because...
history never gave them any importance.</i>

1525
03:26:30,631 --> 03:26:32,431
<i>But the truth is...</i>

1526
03:26:32,931 --> 03:26:35,931
<i>... that Jodhaa and Akbar, together...</i>

1527
03:26:36,431 --> 03:26:37,631
<i>... silently...</i>

1528
03:26:38,131 --> 03:26:40,631
<i>... made history!</i>
