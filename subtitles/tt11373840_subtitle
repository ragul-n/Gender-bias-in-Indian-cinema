1
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,375
'I am crying my heart out,
my dear'

2
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,458
Saajan, come.
We'll have a couple of drinks.

3
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:52,416
'I shall not touch your beautiful body'

4
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,000
'With my hands that
have written stories of sins'

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,583
Dude, did you get anything?

6
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,416
Got some great fish.
We'll fry it.

7
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:12,791
'I shall not kiss you'

8
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,208
Saajan!
- Yes!

9
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,166
Enough of you bathing!
Come and have a drink!

10
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,583
Throw that towel here.
It's lying there.

11
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,833
You've been asking for
'forgiveness' since the afternoon.

12
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,208
I am hesitant to ask
for forgiveness directly.

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,375
That's why I am singing.

14
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,916
Listen to this.

15
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:39,333
[Singing another old Malayalam song]

16
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:48,833
[Continues singing]

17
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,833
Which movie is this from?
- I don't know.

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:56,125
'O Goddess who turned
my heart into a lotus flower'

19
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,875
'Forgive me'

20
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,208
'Forgive me'

21
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,000
Dude, everything is
a confession, right?

22
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,291
Confusion?
- Not confusion. Confession.

23
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,458
Confessing the truth.

24
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,125
Dude, going by the way
he's singing these songs,

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,458
I think Saajan's export business'
confession has gone for a toss.

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,708
Hey! Hey!

27
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,708
Watch out after this election!

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,541
Who will you be once
the election is over?

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,625
Yes. Who, Saajan?

30
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,500
He had to stand in the scorching sun for
7 hours when he went to meet the MLA.

31
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,416
And did anything
happen after that?

32
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,375
Aren't you going to
Thiruvananthapuram, Saajan?

33
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,833
Even though I was
stuck in the sun there,

34
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,708
you guys had enough
to eat and drink, right?

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,375
To listen to your song...

36
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,166
Not just food and drinks...
You will have to offer us money as well!

37
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,166
That's correct.

38
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,000
First return the money you
already owe me, you rascals.

39
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,041
Rascal is your dad!

40
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,708
Punnamoottil Samuel.

41
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,791
At least I have someone
whom I can call my dad.

42
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,125
But who knows who made you guys?

43
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,000
You scoundrel...

44
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,416
You scoundrel!
- Don't get drunk & speak nonsense!

45
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,333
Move!

46
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,833
Saajan, aren't you ashamed?
- Kochumon!

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,875
If you dare intervene...
- Leave me!

48
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,750
Let me see what the hell he'll do.

49
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,583
I'll knock you out.

50
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,333
Try doing that. We'll see.
Got one already, right?

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,458
Leave me, you scoundrel.
Or I'll hit you too!

52
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,208
Saajan, I've been wanting
to hit you since long.

53
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,500
Just because I hang out with you, don't
try to boss me. I'll thrash you!

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,750
Don't show off your Punnamoottil
family's arrogance here.

55
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,833
Get going!
Go!

56
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,166
After being with me all this while...

57
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,500
Didn't I trust you guys...

58
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,125
... as my friends all this while?

59
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,250
You were waiting for
this Saajan to fall, right?

60
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,291
Bloody dogs!
- Saajan!

61
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,833
Stop your stupid drama and go home!

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,208
Get going!

63
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:46,916
It won't be sweet.

64
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,166
I don't think anyone can have coffee here,
if we wait for you to buy sugar.

65
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,791
It's like you're coming here only
because you can't go home drunk.

66
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,541
Shall I get hot water
for Saajan to bathe?

67
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,583
I'll drown Saajan in hot water!
- Oops! She's angry!

68
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,583
Out in the streets,

69
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,958
one can hear only
Saajan's gambling stories.

70
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,875
I'm fed up!

71
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,583
During my childhood,

72
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,458
due to the debt that
my father had created,

73
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,125
my mother led a disgraced life in
front of our family and the townsmen.

74
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,208
I never respected your father. And you?
- Don't talk ill of my father!

75
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,875
But I don't want such a life.

76
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,958
I know how to take
care of both my kids.

77
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,875
They don't need a
father, just for namesake.

78
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,416
If you repeat this,
I'll call all the townsmen here.

79
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,291
Then I'll say that Punnamoottil Shamely's
son is staying in his wife's house now,

80
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,958
since he's petrified of facing
his dad when he's drunk.

After six months...

93
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,625
I'll fly away from here.

94
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,333
Uncle, have you
seen the movie 'Irakal'?

95
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,375
It was shot somewhere
around this area.

96
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,041
Through the right and then...

97
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,500
That's how I should say it, right?

98
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,291
I'll give you the proof.
Over here.

99
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,250
It won't go missing without
your knowledge, right? Give it!

100
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,375
Here you go.
- 2000 is fine for now.

101
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,458
Go and play with your kind!

102
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,125
Haven't I told you to wear a cap?
- Ruining my hair, you devil?

103
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,666
I'll grill you!
- Uncle!

104
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,375
What are you doing, kids?
- Uncle!

105
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,375
Leave me!

106
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,583
If you won't let me sit at the counter,
I'm not sitting anywhere.

107
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,958
Ask your husband to
distribute stuff to people!

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,541

115
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,750
See you.
- Okay.

116
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,791
Let's go.

117
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,125
I'll serve it hot.
I'll serve it hot.

And get the money too.

Give them in plenty!

Over here.

00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,083
Fritters shop.
Come closer and we'll give you in plenty.

122
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,708
Come closer and we'll give you in plenty.
We'll serve them hot.

123
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,083
Oh no!

124
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,750
Get down!

125
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,958
Why are you fumbling?

126
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,583
I'm not from this town at all!
I'm leaving!

127
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,250
See you!

128
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,166
Where were you?

129
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,625
I was coming from Manimala
through Chunkappara...

130
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,916
I had some onions.

131
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,375
Where's Bobin?
- I don't know.

132
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,666
O dear Lord of Parumala,

133
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,583
don't make that John curse
me in the morning itself.

134
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,208
Phew! I'm relieved.

135
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,625
Hello!
Is everything ready there?

136
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,583
Achaya, I've been trying you for so long.
Where are you?

137
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,916
Dude, what do I say?

138
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,750
The alarm didn't ring in the morning.
I woke up late.

139
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,125
Is everything ready there?

140
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,791
I've mixed the drinks.
If you come fast, we can do the rest.

141
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,333
Okay.
I'll be there now.

142
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,750
What is it?
- Halwa.

143
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,708
You spread it at the base.

144
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,791
Don't give oily stuff to the people
who're coming from Chengannur initially.

145
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,708
Just give them our cakes
and the mixed squash drinks.

146
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,291
Or they'll blow up their tummies
with gas and curse us in vain.

147
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,583
Achaya, Betsy Chechi is calling.
- Oops. Don't pick up!

148
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,166
She's been calling me since morning.

149
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,833
That Bobin must have stolen
money in the morning itself.

150
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,208
I'll listen to her
curses once I get there.

151
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,583
You do your work.
- Okay, Achaya.

152
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,375
It's good to have a
banana in the morning.

153
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,458
Had you come for Chunkappara
Sam's daughter's wedding?

154
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Stop gossiping and keep
that banana bunch there.

155
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,000
Kids, all of you go out.
- You get lost!

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,458
Oh my God! These
damn kids are so strong.

157
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,916
What's this flavour?
- Mango.

158
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,958
Give it to everyone inside & outside.
It's good.

159
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,250
John!
- Cheriyachan!

160
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,750
Did you take out all the stuff?

161
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,000
Give me the money.
Let me go quickly.

162
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,041
Or else, Betsy will come here.

163
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,291
Let her come.
I've invited her also for the function.

164
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,541
Oh! She doesn't go for
any celebration nowadays.

165
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
Only for deaths.

166
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,666
It's been 8-10 years since
she got married, right?

167
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,416
Did they avoid having children,
or is there any other issue?

168
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,708
Give me the money.
We'll do the talking later.

169
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,750
Then hold the baby.

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,125
I should hold the baby?
- Yes.

171
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,583
She won't pee, right?
- No.

172
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,625
She has diapers.

173
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
She's crying.
- There's 5000 Rupees.

174
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,500
Hold the baby.
It's okay.

175
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,000
It's totally fine.
- She's crying.

176
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,166
It's Betsy!.
- Don't pick up! Don't!

177
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,333
You picked up?

178
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,458
Hey! We were just talking about you.

179
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,541
He's here.
I'll put him on.

180
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,958
Here you go.

181
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,791
Hello dear...

182
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,666
Well, that...
The cash must be in the counter itself.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Where else would it go?

184
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,833
Okay. Hang up!

185
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,791
You bloody rascal of a nephew!

186
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,500
How many kids do you have in total?

187
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,083
This is the fourth one.

188
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,708
Four kids!
You should remember that!

189
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,708
She'll make my life miserable today.

190
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,083
Hello! Why do you have to shame
me calling on other's phones?

191
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,500
You didn't pick up, right?

192
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,208
I was very busy there.

193
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,833
There were so many
things in my hand.

194
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,500
Uncle, don't be all sentimental in the
morning itself.

195
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,875
Bring the car here.
- Say that properly.

196
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,166
If you are with me,
it will be a moral support for me.

197
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,750
My dear Bobin...
- What is it?

198
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,333
I'd met her last week at Thiruvalla
junction to talk about this divorce.

199
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,875
She sneered at me asking if I was
going to start a matrimonial service.

200
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,000
I get really scared
as soon as I see her.

201
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,541
This time I am with you, right?

202
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
My bad luck that I was
born as your cousin.

203
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,541
Hey bro!
Will anything happen anytime soon?

204
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,125
Even my uncle would do a
better job at washing the car.

205
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,958
Hey! I'll give you only half the money.

206
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,541
You can talk to the manager, Madam.

207
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,666
Then call him here.

208
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,791
Let me ask him where he
brought this dirty water from.

209
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,083
[Inaudible cursing]
- She is angry.

210
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,375
The lawyer is here to
talk about the divorce.

211
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,416
Enough!
Antony, start the car.

212
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,083
Chechi, it's said that
'Life must go on', right?

213
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,458
What?

214
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,625
I got this as a Whatsapp message
and Bobin liked it when I sent him.

215
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,666
You need to take a
decision about this!

216
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,916
How long has it been?
The sooner, the better.

217
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,625
Right?
- Yes. That would be very good.

218
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,958
I have lots of work to do.

219
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,458
Chechi (Elder Sister)...

220
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't trouble the lawyer further.

221
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,875
Please tell him your final decision.

222
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,791
Are you going to run,
or are you coming with me?

223
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,833
This is your third set of
spectacles this month.

224
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,458
Now don't forget this also at some
bar and come back here again!

225
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,833
Here! Try it!

226
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,250
Read and see if it's clear.

227
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,125
Let someone come to this
shop at least like that, Philipose.

228
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,375
I didn't say anything!

229
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,250
It's clear, right? - Okay.
- Then get going.

230
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,541
Take this cover as well.

231
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,750
Go! Go!
- Okay.

232
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,458
Uncle, did she come here?

233
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,875
She came, vented out all
her anger towards you and left.

234
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,041
Now you can start.

235
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,541
That's why I'm sitting here
keeping this shutter open, right?

236
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,458
Hey! I had stopped talking.

237
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,916
That phase is over.

238
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,625
But I'm serious now.

239
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,333
You people should
intervene and talk to her.

240
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,541
Either she should
go back to Michael.

241
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,500
Otherwise, she should
grant him divorce.

242
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,958
How long has this been going on?

243
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,625
My dear kiddo, calm down.

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Your dad Saajan was
even more short-tempered.

245
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,958
We never got scared
seeing his temper.

246
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,208
And you're trying to scare me?

247
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,916
If you are so brave,

248
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,916
say all this directly to your sister.

249
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,500
Can you do that?

250
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,541
So you won't support me, uncle?

251
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,583
Did I mean it that way?

252
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,625
In a family, there would be
disagreements and arguments.

253
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,416
Should you call for a
divorce immediately?

254
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,166
It's been a year since
she came back home now.

255
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,625
When she was sent to college,
she should have studied.

256
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,625
There weren't any men here or what?
To bring someone from Theni?

257
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,083
She doesn't call
Michael at all now?

258
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,666
She has blocked him.

259
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,125
So they have really
decided to separate?

260
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
That's what I'm also suspecting.

261
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,625
I need to migrate to some place,
after she starts living a proper life.

262
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,333
I'll do one thing then.

263
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,666
I'll try talking to her.

264
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,333
You should talk!
Okay then!

265
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,666
Hey! Hey!

266
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,833
Give it back.
- This?

267
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,666
It's quite expensive.

268
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,958
It's quite old, right?
- Yeah, get going.

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,416
This shop has been
around since my dad's time.

270
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,125
You've also been around
since your dad's time.

271
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,916
Sitting there jobless!
- Trying to steal my stuff in the morning?

272
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,083
I should tie this on a thread
and hang it on her neck.

273
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,541
Hello!

274
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,166
Hello?

275
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,791
You rascal!
It's you?

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,166
Okay, I'll put her on.

277
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,791
Is it snowing there now?

278
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,833
Or is it really hot?

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Cheriyachan!

280
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,166
Come here.

281
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,875
Huh?
- Come fast.

282
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,416
Hold on, kiddo.
I'll put her on now.

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,916
I saw her sitting like she was lifeless,
on the sofa outside.

284
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,833
What is it, Betsy?
What happened, dear?

285
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,583
I just dozed off while
I was resting there.

286
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,541
I got really scared
seeing her sitting like that.

287
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,125
Then?
- Then I got up and came here.

288
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,708
No. She woke up when I
shook her and woke her up.

289
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,000
How are you now?

290
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,416
Who's on the phone?

291
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,458
It's Reethamma's son.

292
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,625
Here.
- Cut the call.

293
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,666
Cheriyachan!

294
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,583
This is not child's play.
Take her to some hospital.

295
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,583
Or else, she will have the
same fate as our Mary.

296
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,708
All of you get back to work!
Go!

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Do whatever you want!
Why should I care?

298
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,208
Don't be so angry, dear.

299
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,875
Your mother also
had the same disease.

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Fatigue. When I said that then,
no one listened to me.

301
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,583
Finally, when she
was tested in the ICU,

302
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,791
she had cholesterol 100, sugar 100,
pressure 100.. Everything 100/100.

303
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,791
Finally she suffered at
Pushpagiri hospital for six months.

304
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,958
So?

305
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,500
Let's go meet Dr. Paraykkal.

306
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,125
Who? That blind guy?

307
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,333
He can immediately say what the
disease is once he checks with this steth!

308
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,083
Then you don't need
any test or anything.

309
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,625
He's the best!

310
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,791
Uncle, he came and ate
buns during my dads' death.

311
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,625
Lucky that he's still alive, right?

312
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Sit down, Saajan.

313
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,250
There you go!

314
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,333
That's not Saajan.
It's Bobin.

315
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,291
Medicines to get rid of this shivering
haven't been invented or what?

316
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,375
Shut up!

317
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,625
Get everything checked.

318
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,916
I've written everything in it.

319
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:09,958
Okay.

320
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,833
Does it make any noise when
you go above 80 kmph?

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,333
It must be the wheel cup.

322
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,833
Use an alloy wheel.
It will go away.

323
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,250
Alloy wheel would
reduce the mileage.

324
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,291
That's rubbish.

325
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,333
What happened?

326
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,416
We couldn't catch her
vein while taking her blood.

327
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,458
Very good.

328
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,416
Will you make me paralyzed?

329
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,416
This happens sometimes, Chechi.

330
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,416
What happens sometimes?

331
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,875
Chechi, this is Puthuchottil
Pappachan's daughter.

332
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,791
How does it matter who she is?

333
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,375
She joined just one month ago.

334
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,458
It's been one month and
you haven't learned this?

335
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,125
She got only my hand
to learn her job or what?

336
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,083
She pricked all over my hand!

337
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,250
Enough! I don't
need any damn test!

338
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,833
Her attitude is
like she's a doctor!

339
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,833
She said all that just because
a needle moved a little.

340
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,166
They are from the Punnamoottil family.

341
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,458
It's been a year since this elder one
came here, after fighting with her husband.

342
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,041
She waits to find someone
to curse every morning.

343
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,541
The younger one is no different.

344
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,541
Can you switch on the AC?

345
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,750
I'm not sad because
she shouted at me.

346
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,208
That Bobin knows me.

347
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,208
You can leave early
today if you want to.

348
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,583
Maybe he would
have forgotten me.

349
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,416
[Singing a prayer song]

350
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,958
Why are you so late?

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,875
- What?
- Why are you so late?

352
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,708
[Continues the prayer]

353
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,916
Merin, tea for everyone, please.

354
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:13,083
[Prayer song continues]

355
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,375
Didn't you buy milk today, dear?
- No.

356
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,666
Isn't there anything to eat, Merin?
- No.

357
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,541
Praise the Lord!
Dear brothers and sisters of the Lord...

358
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,208
Today we have got black tea.

359
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,708
That's because
Merin got late today.

360
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,875
Also, because Lord Jesus
didn't grant us the blessing...

361
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,791
of getting milk from the shop.

362
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:44,458
So let's pray hard that Jesus would bless
us to have milk tea in the coming days.

363
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:51,208
[Prayer song]

364
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:10,250
You can't figure this out so easily.
It's quite difficult.

365
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Yes!

366
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,166
Switch off the motor!

367
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,333
Anyone can switch it off.

368
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,833
Are you going to
turn it off or not?

369
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,666
Didn't he switch
off the motor yet?

370
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,333
The water is still spilling.

371
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,625
Didn't I ask you to
pluck curry leaves?

372
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,125
Hello?

373
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,375
Hello?
Who's this?

374
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,541
Betsy, tell me what I should
write on the Bishop's birthday cake.

375
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,416
They've sent it on WhatsApp
to our bakery's number. Check it.

376
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,958
Who was supposed to send it?

377
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,833
I've saved the number on it.

378
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,625
No. Nothing has come.

379
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,041
Give it to me.
Let me check.

380
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,625
I checked.
Nothing has come.

381
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,583
Shucks.
What is this?

382
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,708
Okay.
I'll write 'Happy Birthday Bishop' then.

383
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,041
Send a case of Cola.

384
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,583
Rusk...

385
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,333
We have rusk here.

386
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,583
Send it after two days.

387
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,291
Ever since mom lost her teeth,
she loves having rusk.

388
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,791
Ask her to have it after dipping it in tea.
Or it would hurt her gums.

389
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Shall we leave?

390
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,416
Uncle, do you have anything
else to tell Shaji?

391
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,500
Uncle?

392
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,291
Merin, shall we go
for a noon show?

393
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,958
What's wrong with him?

394
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Come.
You can go in this.

395
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,000
Isn't she on Facebook now?

396
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,541
Deepthi, you know what?
After that incident of theirs,

397
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,875
that Saji and team were almost
about to erect a flex at the junction.

398
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,958
They spread such disgusting
stories about her all around town.

399
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,333
You went for further studies
to Secunderabad, right?

400
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,500
I was in IHD here in that period.

401
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,166
Ajeesh's girlfriend was with me there.

402
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,416
Janet from Thekkel...

403
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,291
- That Philadelphia girl?
- Yes. The same one.

404
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,708
She told Ajeesh one day...

405
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,958
... that some video clip of Merin
& Abhilash has come out.

406
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,958
I asked her once when I
saw her at the auto stand.

407
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,833
'I heard you got a clip.
We didn't get any!', I said.

408
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,333
She left with an
embarrassed face.

409
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,250
Good that she went to Philadelphia.

410
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,000
Otherwise I would
have killed her.

411
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,625
Keep reading the magazine.
Don't do any work!

412
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,625
Pay up!

413
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,708
Here.
Drink this.

414
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,416
It's the 'Saudi Shake'.
This is full of dry fruits.

415
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,791
What happened today?
You seem to be in a good mood.

416
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:07,708
Hey! That Bobin has been
talking about migration for long.

417
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,458
- Is he serious?
- Of course.

418
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,458
How does he think that...

419
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,666
... the Australian Government
would let him stay there?

420
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,875
You don't know, Chechi.

421
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,250
Bobin knows more about things abroad,
than about things happening here.

422
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,875
Just that he doesn't have the looks.
He's quite something.

423
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He has great knowledge.

424
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,083
Yeah, right! Is that why he
got stuck here after college?

425
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,416
That's pure bad luck.

426
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:31,208
We sent him with a visiting visa to Oman,
to Michael's cousin's place.

427
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,875
He came back after two weeks!

428
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,875
Maybe he didn't
like the climate there.

429
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,791
Now he's after me...
pestering me to get divorced.

430
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,000
Will any younger brother in this
world do this to his elder sister?

431
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,875
If he wants me to get divorced,

432
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,958
get me married to Shijo in Georgia
and send me away from here,

433
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,250
and sell the house & property
in Chunkappara for his migration,

434
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,541
he won't go anywhere
in this lifetime.

435
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,416
Well, how's the Saudi shake?
Shall I get you one more?

436
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,750
I needed to go somewhere urgently.

437
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:07,458
I forgot.
I'll leave now, Chechi.

438
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,166
Drink this and go!

439
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,208
Oman shake was superb, Chechi.

440
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,166
I should've known when she
offered it to me, that she'd turn violent.

441
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,000
Did you see that movie in
which the aliens dry up the sea?

442
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,208
No, man.
I ran out of data.

443
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,041
I'll check tomorrow.

444
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,666
Dude, there's more poverty in
America than in India or what?

445
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,333
Here we get 2 GB for free daily.

446
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,125
But it gets over at 4 AM.
You know?

447
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,333
Just don't die ****kin off.

448
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:48,708
'Appear before me, O Messiah'

449
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,791
What do you want?

450
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,166
The Church youth wing is conducting
a youth march tomorrow at Kottayam.

451
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,666
I have to go for that.

452
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,208
So I need to check
the train timings.

453
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,708
What will you do during
a youth march, uncle?

454
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,250
It's for the youth, right?

455
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,333
All unmarried people
are part of the youth, dear.

456
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,000
Don't you know that?
- Yeah, right!

457
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,625
Give it to me.

458
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,666
Why?
- To check Venad express' time.

459
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,375
Venad express always
comes on the same time.

460
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,916
It doesn't keep
changing every week.

461
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,125
This is such a nuisance.

462
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,916
I'll check in the
morning and tell you.

463
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,041
If you want to eat something now,
go and grate the coconut.

464
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,291
I should grate the coconut?

465
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,458
Even though I'm a youth,
I'll also be hungry, right?

466
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,833
Get going, youth icon.

467
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:30,708
'I shall grate the
coconut, O Messiah'

468
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,041
Is your discussion done for the day?

469
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,208
What's happening in Philadelphia?

470
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,125
Winter has started.

471
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,416
Gibin takes one hour to move
the ice from the road every morning.

472
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:50,291
I was discussing with him
about a snow shovel machine.

473
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,291
A business of renting out those machines.

474
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,666
There's great scope
during the winter.

475
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:58,375
Then ask him to start a franchise
of your 'Bob Ceramics' over there.

476
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,500
Even if the people of Ranni
don't buy your commodes & bathtubs,

477
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,708
Philadelphians would buy.
For sure!

478
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,416
If the last flood hadn't happened,

479
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,666
there would have been 2 branches of
Bob Ceramics at Thiruvalla & Kozhenchery.

480
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,666
Yeah, right!

481
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:14,291
As if your commodes & bath tubs
would be damaged in rising water.

482
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,666
Even after water rising
to 2 stories height here,

483
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,541
and losing everything we had,

484
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,000
didn't we bring our bakery
back to normal from scratch?

485
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,333
It's a commercial space which
can get a rent of Rs.6000 per month.

486
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,208
Stop holding on to your commodes,
and vacate that place.

487
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,500
Rajan is looking for a shop
to store his rubber sheets.

488
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,541
Or give it to her.

489
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,083
She has some plans in mind.

490
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,375
Embroidery, boutique
or something like that.

491
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,583
Oh! So she has no
plans of going back?

492
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,083
Everyone else can
start all sorts of things.

493
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,041
No one here
understands my passion.

494
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,833
I'll sell it.
I'll sell everything.

495
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,666
In that case, when you sell it,

496
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,583
sell everything
except that bath tub.

497
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,250
If we keep it on
top of our terrace,

498
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,291
the next time a flood hits,

499
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,125
we can get inside
that, row it and escape.

500
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,125
Instead of a life boat?

501
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,083
Where's the fish fry?

502
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,625
There were only two.
I ate both.

503
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,875
What will I eat then?

504
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,500
Hey! If you have a fish fry,
give it to him.

505
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,041
He needn't turn into a naxal
because of that.

506
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,333
There's no more fish fry.
- Bring it.

507
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,750
Eat these thorns if you want.

508
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,416
Get lost.
- You get lost.

509
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,458
Here.
You can eat this.

510
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Just one?

511
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,291
What's she doing all
the time on that phone?

512
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,000
It's been 2-3 days now.

513
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,791
She is in some kind of trouble.

514
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,250
There's no trouble.

515
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,291
Someone is sending
messages to my phone.

516
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,250
To your phone?
- Not mine. The bakery's phone.

517
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,916
Do one thing. Change the
number on the bakery's board.

518
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,250
Nobody..
- Nobody....

519
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,791
Nobody does it better.

520
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,583
Hey Bobin!
- What is it?

521
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,416
What are you doing there?

522
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,666
Nothing.

523
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,708
Give me that phone.

524
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,541
Why?
- To check if Venad express has left.

525
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,708
Venad express has left.

526
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,416
That's not possible!

527
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Who's she talking to?

528
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,041
Hello? Is it Michael Vasanth?
- Yes?

529
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,875
I'm calling from Guntur near Andhra.

530
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,333
Listen, Michael.

531
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:48,208
Your wife Betsy has gotten
into some extra marital affair,

532
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,125
and has been talking
all night to someone,

533
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,500
and going around
like a mad woman.

534
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,208
If you want to save
your marriage life,

535
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,958
this is your last chance.

536
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,500
Bobin, even if you change your voice,
I can recognize you.

537
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,958
Listen, if you want to ask something
to your sister, ask her directly.

538
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,208
Don't do this bullshit.
- Okay.

539
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,625
So it's not him.

540
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,083
These are all orders.

541
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,666
These are orders.
Keep it there.

542
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,250
Devil!

543
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,958
Betsy, dear..
- Huh?

544
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,583
Come here.

545
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,375
I'm coming.

546
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,083
Check the weight
of the second batch.

547
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,125
Yeah, I'll check.

548
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,458
There was a difference
in weight yesterday.

549
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,333
Isn't that her purse?

550
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,916
Won't let me be decent?

551
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,833
Come.

552
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,083
Come here.

553
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:47,125
Annamma, cup cakes are running
out at the counter. Bring some.

554
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,791
The economy is dull.
That's why.

555
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,166
Don't hurt me.
- No. We won't hurt you.

556
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,125
Oh God! Slowly!

557
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,250
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
Oh God!

558
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,583
It's over.
- Oh God! Oh Jesus!

559
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,291
Haven't you taken it?
- Yes, it's done.

560
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,500
Oh God!

561
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,208
Oh God!

562
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,041
It's done, right?

563
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,708
I have to do it once more.
I didn't get any blood.

564
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,875
I'll be right back.

565
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,041
Hello?

566
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,458
Who is this?

567
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,583
Can you go there, please?
- Hello?

568
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:37,958
Hello?
- Just a minute.

569
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,708
Who is this?

570
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,583
Hello?
- It's me, Merin.

571
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:44,791
Merin?

572
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,250
Which Merin?

573
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,541
The one who studied in MSH.

574
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,916
Oh! The one who used to
hang out with Jisha in school.

575
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,625
From the last classroom?

576
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,375
Yes.

577
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:56,708
Hey!

578
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,541
Did you call or message to
the shop's number recently?

579
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,083
Well, I had only that
as your number, Bobin.

580
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,125
That's why I messaged
on that number.

581
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,958
Oh! That's my old number.

582
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,416
Yes, I got that.

583
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,250
I also figured that
it's with your sister now.

584
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,333
Oh! So you messaged
by mistake, right?

585
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,916
Has it been long since you
joined this diagnostic centre?

586
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,208
It's almost a month now.

587
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,875
Okay then.
- Just a minute.

588
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,416
Can we meet tomorrow?

589
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,750
What happened?
- I have to tell you something.

590
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,208
Tomorrow, I am...

591
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,125
Bobin spoke to me for the first time,
when we went for a tour during High School.

592
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,625
The coffee I had in hand spilled on to
Bobin's shirt while we were in Thekkady.

593
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,333
He shouted at me.

594
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,333
He was always
very short tempered.

595
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,958
Why did you ask me to come?

596
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,125
Are you in a hurry?

597
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,125
A little bit.
I'm going to migrate to Australia.

598
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,500
Now?
- Not now.

599
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,916
Next year.

600
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
In this Ranni,

601
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,000
these jobless Christian guys have
a small hobby, and that's migration.

602
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:14,500
Who's this James?
- Who is James?

603
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,416
When I sent a Whatsapp
forward, Betsy replied,

604
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,458
'Is this James?'

605
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:20,833
James?

606
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,166
There's no one like that...

607
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,833
... as far as I know.

608
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,166
What's your sister's husband's name?
- Michael.

609
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,333
Do you meet your
old friends now, Bobin?

610
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,958
Did she send anything else?

611
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,583
No.

612
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,500
Shall I leave then?

613
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,916
I need to go to Erumakkad.

614
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Nothing else, right?

615
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,375
No. I called you to say this.
- Okay then.

616
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,125
Hey! Can you do me a favour?

617
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,625
What?
- Can you message her often?

618
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,291
I want to know
who this James is.

619
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,625
Nothing else.

620
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,041
Have the fruit salad.

621
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,291
I had only one spoon.

622
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,958
Chetta, do you have cream buns?

623
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,625
Ask at the next bakery.

624
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,375
Why have you kept
this shop open then?

625
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,041
Do you have a headache?

626
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Bro!

627
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,583
Huh?
What?

628
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,208
Come here.
- This guy is just showing off.

629
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,791
Bro, don't humiliate me.

630
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,916
You come here only once a week.
They come here daily.

631
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,916
It's really tough.
See!

632
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,583
Might be because you
come to the gym daily...

633
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,208
You have a 'Jim Carrey' look.

634
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:26,541
Jim Carrey?

635
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,708
Who's that?

636
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,541
I need to build
some more muscles.

637
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:31,625
Come on!
Hurry up!

638
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,625
Come on! Ten more!
Hard! Hard!

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Encourage me too.
- Okay! Come on, hurry up!

640
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:42,208
I hope I can get a six pack
before I go to Australia.

641
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,291
Delusions while exercising!
- Dude!

642
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,166
Shall we leave early today?

643
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,541
A new English film has
released in Upasana theatre.

644
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,166
It's full of aliens.

645
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,916
All the aliens would
be in America, right?

646
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
No! They would be
at Mamukk Junction.

647
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,541
Why does Ranni need
an alien from outside now?

648
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,416
Also, I have a party
to attend tonight.

649
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,125
The guy who runs
Cherupushpam nursery?

650
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,875
James of Thadiyoor?
He has come from Bahrain.

651
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,291
Who?
- There will be single malt whiskey.

652
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,583
Hey! Which James?
Tell me.

653
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,708
Do you have his photo with you?

654
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,708
Photo? - Yes.
- Why do you need a photo?

655
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,500
Tell me if you have it.
It'd be useful.

656
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,583
I don't have his photo.

657
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,000
Ugh! It's so heavy!

658
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,583
Check, man!
- He has a WhatsApp DP.

659
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,500
Show me! - You want to see?
- Show me.

660
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,833
Take it fast.
- I'm taking it.

661
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:31,791
Here.

662
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,208
See!
- Give it to me.

663
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:37,000
Not this one.

664
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,333
Not this one.
- Not this one?

665
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,875
This is James.
- No.

666
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,333
Do you already know James?
- No.

667
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,750
But this is not how I
imagined James to be.

668
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,375
Not this?

669
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,916
So he isn't the one
who came from Bahrain?

670
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,958
[Pastor James Palaykkamannil
conducting a prayer meet]

671
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,875
James Palaykkamannil?

672
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:31,541
[Priest offering prayers]

673
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,250
How did you come?
- In my tempo van.

674
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,375
So you're not in Australia now?
- No. I'm in New Zealand.

675
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,750
Is it?
- Betsy!

676
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,750
See you!

677
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,583
Biju?

678
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,541
It's been so long since she stepped
out and talked to someone like this.

679
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,125
There are some
changes, after all.

680
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:05,416
That's Biju from Omaloor, right?
He's in New Zealand.

681
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:07,875
They are old friends.

682
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,833
Looks like they are talking about me.

683
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,000
About you?
- Yes. Watch!

684
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,041
Hey! Where do you work now?

685
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,208
At New Zealand.

686
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,125
By the way, what does
your brother do now?

687
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,958
He's planning to
migrate to Australia now.

688
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,458
Smart boy.
It's okay even if it's New Zealand.

690

Yes, I've heard so.

691
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:31,625
Can you get him a job at
the Indian Embassy there?

692
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,500
Even a job at a petrol bunk
or supermarket would do.

693
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,958
He will be happy anyway.

694
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,625
Isn't that your own sister?

695
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,166
Yeah, right!
She would definitely say all that.

- Bye.

No.

No?

704
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:07,875
Okay then.

705
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,916
Wait and watch.
He'll call back right away.

Do you sleep early?

709
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,458
No. I go to sleep late.

710
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,250
I was just asking.

711
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,583
I also sleep very late.

712
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,250
Oops.

713

What is it?

714
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:04,083
There's a place where we can get
some fresh air and nostalgia.

You go ahead.

I should have tried fainting.

told this to anyone in my life.

became the happiest.

minds that me and Abhilash...

... had come there
for some hanky panky.

863
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,958
If that was the case, we could
have gone somewhere else, right?

864
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:55,291
Because of that, dad sent
me away from town for 2 years.

865
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:58,208
So what happened? I lived my life,
just like I wanted, over there.

866
00:57:58,666 --> 00:57:59,791
I watched good movies,

867
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,125
wore clothes I liked..
It was great fun.

868
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,791
Well...

869
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,750
Don't you have any other job?
Still talking about all that?

870
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,083
That was very cheap.

871
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,333
Well.. I was kidding.

872
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,791
In our relationship,

873
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,666
I have that freedom, right?

874
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,333
So? He thinks he can
ask any nonsense?

875
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,500
Chechi, bill please.

876
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:38,416
You went to the theatre to watch a movie.
We can't do anything about it now.

877
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,625
But you shouldn't
have gone on the bike.

878
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,375
When there are buses
and auto rickshaws...

879
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:48,625
Then... when it comes to marriage...

880
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,791
I don't like my girl checking
for other men's veins,

881
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,958
and rubbing here and there
after giving injections.

882
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,333
That's not such a good feeling.

883
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:02,583
Merin, you know, right?
I'm planning to migrate to Australia.

884
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,458
I don't think it would happen now.
That rascal is over there, right?

885
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,208
That Abhilash!

886
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,625
How can I go for work confidently,
leaving you at home?

887
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,416
What if you guys go
for a movie?

888
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,041
Look how cheap he is!

889
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:22,500
Bobin, stop the bike.
- Why?

890
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,791
Stop the bike, Bobin.

891
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,208
Even my dad is better than this.

892
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,250
Get going, Bobin.

893
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,958
I'll walk back home.

894
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:39,625
Run!

895
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,833
Bobin, will you come with
me to Theni tomorrow?

896
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:52,208
Don't tell uncle now.

897
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:55,291
[You should be tied to
this pillar and beaten up]

898
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,291
[Are you even a human?]

899
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:01,541
'Whatever this King does,

900
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,458
it never goes wrong'

901
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,125
'Whatever this king does,

902
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,750
it never goes wrong'

903
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,125
[Prayers in progress]

904
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:28,291
[Prayers continue]

905
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:43,333
Hey! Pappachan's
daughter has a video phone!

906
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,416
It's an android phone, mom.

907
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,291
'Whatever this king does...'

908
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:54,708
Video call?
- Hello?

909
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:58,541
Hello? What is it? Your dad is also
there? I'm not wearing a shirt.

910
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,416
That's okay, Bobin.
You needn't wear a shirt.

911
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:02,750
But, in such a circumstance...
- Isn't it?

912
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:04,958
Did you have food?

913
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,583
I will have food. You hang up!
- Don't hang up!

914
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,291
Why is she like this?

915
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,625
Shucks! He hung up!

916
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,208
Rahael!

917
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,958
I will call Bobin once more.

918
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,583
Hello?

919
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,625
Hey! What did you do yesterday?

920
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,416
That too, in front of your parents.

921
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,750
My parents found out everything.
- Found what?

922
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,375
They asked me not
to stay here anymore.

923
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:57,958
What did you say then?

924
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,500
I'm going to Bangalore.

925
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,875
Bangalore?

926
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:01,916
What are you doing?

927
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:04,083
We're about to go to
Theni to meet Michael.

928
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:08,666
If our plan works out, I'll give you
an awesome treat after coming back.

929
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,791
We won't meet again, Bobin.

930
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,083
We don't have to talk anymore.

931
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,291
If it's urgent, can't you
go after I come back?

932
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:16,750
No.
I'm going today itself.

933
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:17,958
So when will we meet next?

934
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,875
Some day!
Bye!

935
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:24,000
Hey! You won't get me if you
call me on this phone again.

936
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,625
Bobin!

937
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,041
He will learn only like this.

938
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:37,041
It won't be right if
I don't leave now.

939
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:38,166
Merin...

940
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,875
Don't talk to me, dad.

941
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,416
Shall we go?

942
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:02,708
Is Michael here?
- What?

943
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,916
Is Michael here? (in Tamil)
- Sir is in the office.

944
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,333
Hey! I'll go check and come.

945
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,333
Betsy?
When did you come?

946
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:27,625
Were you sleeping?

947
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,333
No. I was just lying down.

948
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,750
Have you come alone?
- No. Bobin has come with me.

949
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,958
How's Bobin?

950
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,166
So you're not asking
how I am doing?

951
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,416
You still smoke?

952
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,708
No. It's been long since I quit.

953
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,541
Don't you go home nowadays?

954
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,833
How is business?

955
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:49,916
Renovation is going on at home.
That's why I asked you to come here.

956
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,000
Business and all is fine.

957
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53,833
This new year's harvest was great.
So, all good.

958
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,833
I don't feel good at all,
sitting at home.

959
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,041
I feel like I should
move somewhere else.

960
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,375
Bobin is trying to get me
out of the house all the time.

961
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:04,583
He's crazy.

962
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,458
So, what have you got planned?

963
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:10,166
You should do something.

964
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,750
This year, just like you, I am also...

965
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,416
slowly and steadily...

966
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,708
I'm trying, you know?

967
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,083
We all have to move on, right?

968
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:27,666
Then? Are you into something?
Or someone?

969
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,500
Hey! I was just kidding.

970
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,583
I said it, just like that.

971
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,541
Isn't that what
both of us wanted?

972
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,291
Because we couldn't
take it anymore.

973
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,791
Eventually, everything
will be all right.

974
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,291
What happened?

975
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:53,625
So you weren't the one who
sent that message to me?

976
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,708
What message?

977
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:58,916
I'm sorry.

978
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,208
I...

979
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,083
I wished at some point...

980
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,250
.. that it would be you.

981
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:04,875
What?
- I'm sorry.

982
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,166
Betsy!

983
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,250
Where is Bobin?

984
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:08,541
He's at the farm.

985
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,291
So those messages?

986
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,083
Don't talk about it again.

987
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,333
Even if you say that
it was you who sent it,

988
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,708
it won't affect me in any way.

989
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,041
We both have decided.

990
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:39,125
It's over, Bobin.

991
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,416
What's gone won't come back, right?

992
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,333
You know?

993
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:44,625
Don't treat her differently.

994
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,208
She doesn't want
any kind of sympathy.

995
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,666
That's not what she wants, Bobin.
Okay?

996
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,750
Just talk to her normally.

997
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,875
This is just a bad phase,
and it will be over soon.

998
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:12,750
Dude, get yourself a job, man.

999
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,000
If you sit at home jobless,
you will lose all respect.

1000
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:18,083
Men are created to
provide for their families.

1001
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
It's over.

1002
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,416
Tell Uncle as well.

1003
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:36,791
'The eyes are disappearing,
at a distance that can't be seen'

1004
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:44,500
'Even silence is going away slowly'

1005
01:07:54,041 --> 01:08:00,875
'Whom are you searching for,
in the dark?'

1006
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:08,708
'Whom are these paths waiting for?'

1007
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:17,666
'Forms are changing
and disappearing'

1008
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,833
'Like an invisible wind,
far from my reach'

1009
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:34,666
'O heart, where are
you wandering about?'

1010
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:42,583
'O heart, you are
going away slowly'

1011
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:20,041
'Like the sorrow of the sky,
showering endlessly'

1012
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:27,791
'You are the pain that is
sobbing silently within me'

1013
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,500
'Always with me,
like a lullaby'

1014
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:48,583
'You are waiting like a
cloud far away, to rain'

1015
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,500
'Waiting every day'

1016
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:58,041
'Drenched in sorrow'

1017
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:06,666
'O heart, where are
you wandering about?'

1018
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:14,333
'O heart, you are
going away slowly'

1019
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,916
Bobin bro, it's true
that you are elder to me.

1020
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,333
But what you did was really...

1021
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,250
Great!

1022
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,333
This smile of yours when
you have no answer?

1023
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,875
I know what it means.

1024
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:24,875
A scoundrel who will go to any length
to send his own sister away from home.

1025
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,375
I'm not saying this
because I'm drunk, bro.

1026
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,916
Or consider that I'm saying
this because I'm drunk.

1027
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,000
You are absolutely selfish.

1028
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,458
Heard that, you fool?
- Fool?

1029
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,750
Yes, fool.
So what?

1030
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,625
That's mine.
- So?

1031
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,291
Nothing.

1032
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,083
Are you leaving?
- Yes, I'm leaving.

1033
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,208
You're toxic!

1034
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,708
Advocate, you stopped?

1035
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,541
He left.
- You and him can have fun!

1036
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,916
He is leaving angrily.

1037
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,791
What do I say?
Kids these days...

1038
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:02,000
... have no respect
for our generation.

1039
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,291
Hey kiddo!
Come here.

1040
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,750
Isn't there a time to
come to an institution?

1041
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,750
Have you bothered about this
bakery after coming back from Theni?

1042
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:27,041
Not just me.
She also hasn't come, right?

1043
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,375
So?
You won't come here?

1044
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:32,708
I've been going berserk here
for the past one week.

1045
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:34,666
Do you even have some empathy?

1046
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:37,291
I've taken care of you since
the time you peed in your pants.

1047
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,375
Show that gratitude at least,
you scoundrel.

1048
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:43,875
Will you burn me
down with your stare?

1049
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,416
Hey! It's only out of the love and
respect towards Saajan and me,

1050
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:50,000
that all those shopkeepers are
buying stuff from here even now.

1051
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,541
You've been going up and down
this verandah for 5-10 years now, right?

1052
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,916
Are you even worth a penny?

1053
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,291
Son...

1054
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:05,500
This institution is in your father's name,
not mine.

1055
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,541
Don't make people curse him.

1056
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,833
Bro! Shelley?
- Tell me, dude.

1057
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,083
I'm waiting downstairs.

1058
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,041
Will you come downstairs?

1059
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,250
You wait there.
I'll come.

1060
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:51,000
I hope he doesn't remember me beating
him up behind the Church long back.

1061
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,166
Bro!

1062
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:56,458
Long time!

1063
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,708
What's happening?
- How are you doing, bro?

1064
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,416
I'm doing good.
- What's this unusual visit for?

1065
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:02,916
It's a small thing.

1066
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:08,000
Will you take some puffs and cake
items from our place to your bakery?

1067
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:09,958
Bro, are you mocking me?

1068
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,166
No, dude.
- Kozhenchery, Kumbanad, Pullad, Elanthoor

1069
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,250
We supply to all bakeries in all
those places. And to our bakery,

1070
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,375
we have to get stuff from
your lousy Saajan bakery?

1071
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,291
Yes!
- Tell me something that's possible.

1072
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:21,541
Dude...

1073
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,333
It will be a huge
help for me if this happens.

1074
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,416
Things are not
going very well now.

1075
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,625
Will you try
talking to your dad?

1076
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,083
I will talk to dad.
That will be difficult.

1077
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:32,291
It's okay.
I'll manage.

1078
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,333
But...
- What is it?

1079
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,166
Back in the day, at the
Church ground, you..

1080
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,958
My dear Shelley...
Dude...

1081
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:38,916
A Marthomite,

1082
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,125
should help a Jacobite
when he's in trouble.

1083
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,125
Isn't that what the
Bishop has taught us?

1084
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,333
You haven't forgotten
your old tricks, huh?

1085
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,708
Okay.
Call me in the evening.

1086
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:10,875
'I trust in God'

1087
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,416
Ah! Saajan Bakery!
- Hey!

1088
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:14,166
Tharakan Achayan has
started a new venture.

1089
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:16,250
First class, packed...
- I'll tell her, son.

1090
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:19,958
From Tharakan's farm in Mysore,
hand-picked by experts,

1091
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,833
brewed from first rate
Alphonso mangoes...

1092
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:25,958
Not brewed.
Extracted!

1093
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,291
Mango juice.
Here.

1094
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,291
Look!
Mamba Mango Juice.

1095
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,166
What a great name!

1096
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:35,958
Hey! As an introductory offer,

1097
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,041
he has promised to give us
250 half liter bottles for free.

1098
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,958
Per bottle, we'll get 6 Rupees
more than our current rate, as well.

1099
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:44,708
There won't be any
problems for 18 months.

1100
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:45,958
How will it have a problem?

1101
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,166
You must be mixing some potent stuff in it.
- What?

1102
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:51,083
Ever since you were a child..
- Do you need to say that here?

1103
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:53,833
Ever since you were a child,
our special item has been lime juice.

1104
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:56,166
There's a taste that
people here remember.

1105
01:16:56,375 --> 01:17:00,291
When you say Saajan Bakery, for those who
have had lime juice and egg puffs together,

1106
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,208
it's an emotion in their minds.

1107
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,583
If you bring this pesticide stuff here,

1108
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:06,125
I'll throw it all away.

1109
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,708
You and your Tharakan!

1110
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:10,125
Weren't you arrested for
brewing illicit liquor?

1111
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:12,208
Achayan is on the path of God now.

1112
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,333
Yes. How wonderful is God's love,
how beautiful is it. Isn't that correct?

1113
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,541
I'll call uncle.

1114
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,291
Kiddo, Tharakan sir is leaving.

1115
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,333
That would be better.

1116
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,041
Your ideas will shut down
this bakery some day.

1117
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,625
What should I do then?
- Then you run this place. I'll go home.

1118
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,416
Ah! You'll say that immediately!

1119
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:29,958
You won't let
me sit at the counter...

1120
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,166
... or let me migrate either.

1121
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:32,333
Devil!

1122
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:42,166
She didn't hurt him physically, right?

1123
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,958
When I am around?
Yeah, right!

1124
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:47,041
Saying that the cumin
soda had less gas,

1125
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,833
what she did to that Plamoottil
Raghu one day. Phew!!

1126
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,791
She's a psycho!
- Well...

1127
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:53,166
What happened today?

1128
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:57,458
I introduced a new brand so
that we can make some profit.

1129
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:00,833
From her attitude, it would seem like I
was asking her to marry that Tharakan.

1130
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,666
After all, that bakery
belongs to me as well, right?

1131
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:06,041
I can also decide what to
place on the shelves there, right?

1132
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,083
What you said is 100% correct.

1133
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:10,166
I agree to you in this topic, uncle.

1134
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:14,750
Well.. Actually, has this Tharakan
stopped brewing illicit liquor?

1135
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,750
What?

1136
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:19,250
The spirit that he makes...
Just that it burns our insides a bit.

1137
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:21,541
Once we drink it, we'll
be on fire from head to toe!

1138
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,500
That's how..
- This is why Sicily Chechi dumped you.

1139
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,833
No consistency.

1140
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,500
What's wrong with him?

1141
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,625
If you're planning to do business
with Tharakan, inform me in advance.

1142
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,166
I'll go stay at Mercy
aunty's house.

1143
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,125
We won't know when the
police would turn up here.

1144
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,625
If that can get rid
of your nuisance,

1145
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:41,541
I might start brewing with him!

1146
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,875
If you come up in
life at least like that,

1147
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,125
I'll buy a chain worth 4
sovereigns of gold for you.

1148
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:48,416
Then I'll keep that chain on
your chest for your funeral.

1149
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:51,166
Hey! Ask this
nuisance to shut up!

1150
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:52,666
Or I'll smash
her on to the wall.

1151
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,708
Yeah, right! To smash me on to
the wall, who are you? Superman?

1152
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,416
Get lost!

1153
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,375
Do you have any sense?
- It's time to switch on some music.

1154
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:01,708
You keep bringing these
troublesome guys to the bakery!

1155
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:04,500
You should understand something.
That bakery belongs to both of us.

1156
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,791
I'll do whatever
I like over there.

1157
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:07,416
I'll bring whoever I want.
Whom are you to oppose?

1158
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,958
You're not doing what you like.
You will get that bakery to shut down.

1159
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,500
I'll shut it down, run it,
or do whatever I want.

1160
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,375
Why are you staying here?
- This is my house as well.

1161
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,208
Uncle, make her understand.

1162
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:20,708
It's not enough to say you know what to keep
in the shelf. You should be in the bakery.

1163
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,833
You come there only to steal egg puffs.
- Are you studying for IELTS?

1164
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,166
Get lost, you dog!

1165
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,833
Look at him leaving
when he has no answer!

1166
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,791
Scaredy-cat!
- Your husband is the scaredy-cat!

1167
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:30,541
What did he say earlier?

1168
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:31,916
He'll get me
married to Tharakan?

1169
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,125
Don't open your
mouth when required!

1170
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:36,875
You keep supporting him!
- Praise the Lord!

1171
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:38,916
Can you reduce its volume?
- No!

1172
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,583
Get lost, you useless prick!

1173
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,375
Prick is your uncle!
- You bloody frog!

1174
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,500
Get lost!
- I...

1175
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:46,625
Come out of your
room if you dare.

1176
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,916
You're lucky that I got a call.

1177
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:49,458
Yeah, right! Otherwise?
- Hello?

1178
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,500
Hey! Shall I call you back?

1179
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,083
Dude, wait.
It's something urgent.

1180
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,083
Tell me, Shelley.

1181
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,916
Do you guys still
make cream buns?

1182
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,625
Cream buns? I think we
stopped it some 10-12 years back.

1183
01:19:58,625 --> 01:19:59,625
Oh! There goes!

1184
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,791
My dad and your dad were friends.

1185
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:05,375
He's saying that if you guys are still
making cream buns, he can try it out.

1186
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:09,666
You do something. Make some 5-6
cream buns and go and meet him tomorrow.

1187
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,333
Cream buns...

1188
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:13,791
Do it if you want to.
I can't be too involved in this.

1189
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:16,041
Hey! I can hear a song there.

1190
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,625
What's happening?
A fight?

1191
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,208
Can you stop that song?

1192
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,083
Don't shout in your own house, man!

1193
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:23,625
I'll call you back.
- Okay.

1194
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:25,333
Bobin, there's no rice for you today.

1195
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,916
Then you'll sleep in the well tonight.

1196
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:32,791
Back in the day, Saajan Bakery used
to make the best cream buns in town.

1197
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,541
I've eaten a lot of them
during my childhood.

1198
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:36,416
Then I don't know why...
I haven't seen them much.

1199
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,166
Maybe they stopped it
because demand went down.

1200
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,208
Sad!

1201
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,125
Dear, please co-operate.

1202
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,291
It's for our bakery after all, right?

1203
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:51,750
You don't have to beg her, uncle.

1204
01:20:57,375 --> 01:21:01,291
Showing off so much to make
five cream buns in this night?

1205
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,250
Why do you need raisins?

1206
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,083
Cream buns don't need raisins.

1207
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,958
Tell her that we don't
need much innovation.

1208
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,166
An ordinary cream bun will do.

1209
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,458
Uncle, I had
asked him to shut up.

1210
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,875
Who's talking to you?
- Keep quiet.

1211
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,125
Uncle!

1212
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:18,041
From her attitude, it seems like
Saajan Bakery invented the cream bun.

1213
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:20,541
Uncle, I'll stop this and go.
- Stop it and go!

1214

Hey! Let her work, or you make it.

1215
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,166
I'll make it.
Then what?

1216
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:27,291
She's throwing attitude like she's the
only reason why this shop is running.

1217
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,958
Who else is running it?
- You and Betsy.

1218
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,625
Dear, just because he's
mad, if you also start...

1219
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,083
It's a business he brought, right?

1220
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,166
Let him make it himself.

1221
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,375
See you!

1222
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,541
Let her go if she wants to.

1223

Uncle? You shut up!
- But why, uncle?

1230
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:44,125
For a moment, I wished in
vain that you'll be successful.

1231

1232

1236
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:08,875
Uncle!
- Oh! What is it?

1237
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,791
Shouldn't we deliver
the items by 10 AM?

1238
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,083
Deliver it.

1239
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:18,541
I did only one mistake.

1240
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:21,291
When Betsy left from here,
I stood by your side.

1241
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:27,291
Don't make people say that you killed
your uncle by feeding him cream buns.

1242
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,125
It's all for our bakery, uncle.

Hey!

01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,458

Only if she won't...

1259
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,875
How is it bad?
There's a logic behind everything, uncle.

1260
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:05,541
Valiya Veedan would never dislike
cream buns from Valiya Veedan's.

do some manipulations on this.

Does it?

Though it's made in my company,

bun in this Kozhenchery town.

the Traders' union in Pathanamthitta.

name among people.

since we made this.

What we made
yesterday didn't work out.

1307

It's because I saw Saajan's son sitting
in front of me, in such a circumstance.

01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,416
Oh!

1374
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,125
See! Don't ask her
anything, it seems.

1375
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,833
She shouldn't be
allowed into this house.

1376
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:34,291
Bobin, don't talk nonsense.
You keep quiet.

1377
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:35,750
What about the
nonsense she's doing?

1378
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:37,625
She can do as she
pleases with you.

1379
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,750
Not with me.

1380
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,958
After roaming around with
random guys as long as she wants,

1381
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,416
I can't go and open the
door silently when she comes.

1382
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:44,750
My father's name is Saajan.

1383
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:46,500
I'll knock your teeth off!

1384
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:49,125
Your father Saajan hasn't
shouted at me like this.

1385
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,750
Mind your words!

1386
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:53,375
Uncle.

1387
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,500
He doesn't know if his problem is
me going around with random guys,

1388
01:33:56,583 --> 01:34:00,333
or being humiliated in
front of Benjamin sir again.

1389
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,083
Come, uncle.

1390
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,583
[Saajan Bakery]

1391
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:35,333
Where are you going?
- To help her...

1392
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:37,041
No.
You wait here.

1393
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:38,375
Let her make it somehow.

1394
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:39,833
You get going.

1395
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:03,458
Dear... I'm not asking
you where you went.

1396
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,250
Your problems with Michael...

1397
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,375
All these years that passed...

1398
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:13,208
With all that, I know that you
are under a lot of pressure.

1399
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,000
When your Mommy used to
complain about Saajan to me,

1400
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,291
I could only console her.

1401
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:28,500
But that didn't reduce
her suffering in any way.

1402
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:34,541
I know that what Bobin did
to you today, was not right.

1403
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:40,250
But that's because
he cares for you.

1404
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,333
Care?

1405
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:47,166
My dad got me married to Michael,
while he was at Pushpagiri hospital,

1406
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,541
after his second heart attack.

1407
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,833
While conducting the wedding
without knowing the truth, dad thought...

1408
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:54,958
he was fulfilling his
daughter's wishes.

1409
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,375
Even then, no one asked me...

1410
01:35:57,791 --> 01:35:59,416
... what my relationship
with Michael was.

1411
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:02,458
We were good friends, uncle.

1412
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:05,333
It took us 10 years
after our wedding,

1413
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:08,125
to realize that we would
always be just good friends.

1414
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,333
Dad always troubled Mommy
in the name of this 'care'.

1415
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:18,375
Tolerating my dad and suffering,
Mommy left us.

1416
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,583
Soon, dad also followed her.

1417
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:24,250
What I need from my
home is not care, uncle.

1418
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,125
I just want to open up
my mind to someone.

1419
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:35,083
I have only considered whatever he did
so far, as my younger brother's mischief.

1420
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,375
But the way he's behaving now...

1421
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,125
I pity him!

1422
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:42,541
Saajan and his stubbornness
hasn't gone anywhere.

1423
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,500
Not just his looks,
even his character is the same.

1424
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,916
My father, whom I do not
like somewhere or the other.

1425
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,375
I was watching the
CCTV in the morning.

1426
01:37:27,416 --> 01:37:30,250
To see if you had come
there to buy these buns.

01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,916
What else do you want, son?

1429
01:37:57,666 --> 01:37:59,541
Can you give me
one more cream bun?

1430
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:24,791
It does have that old taste.

1431
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:26,458
And the cream is amazing.

1432
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:30,416
We'll do one thing.
We'll keep some buns in our bakery.

1433

Let me see if they get sold.

1434
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:35,833
I didn't go anywhere near it,
so that it doesn't get messed up this time.

- Betsy? - My sister.

She has got 'that' from my father.

01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,583
What? Honesty?

1438
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:43,875
Culinary skill.

1439
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:47,166
If we boil honesty,
we won't get this taste, right?

01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:50,458
Hey kiddo!

1441
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,500

You also have it.

Do you know that?
- Culinary skill?

1444
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Honesty.

from this damn house.

Because of you?
- No! No!

Your father. He had
troubled my dear Mary a lot.

1451
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:53,708
Don't bring out that
father's same character.

Betsy like this?

fit of anger. Forgive me.

I'm the one who's wrong now?

01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:18,125
Uncle, do you think I'm not sad?

1462
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,625
After all, she is my own sister, right?

1463
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:24,500

out for a long time, late in the night?

old guy, James from her college.

James.
- What's his full name? Give me a clue.

1473
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,916
James.
James Bond.

01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:53,416
You're getting naughtier by the day.

1475
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:55,166
James!
- Uncle!

01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:58,416
Uncle!
- Nephew!

1477
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,666
James!

1478
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:05,166
I had lied about James
to Bobin that day.

1479
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:08,208
He had so much attitude when
he called me for the first time.

1480
01:41:08,666 --> 01:41:10,708
'Are you Merin, who used
to hang out with Jisha?'

1481
01:41:10,791 --> 01:41:13,291
I wasn't hanging out with Jisha.
She was hanging out with me.

1482
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:15,875
And when he came to meet me?

1483
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:17,166
Not even one minute had passed.

1484
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:18,916
That buffalo wanted
to go to Erumakkad.

1485
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,416
You!

1486
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,208
Bobin doesn't trust anyone in this world.
Not even his own sister.

1487
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:20,833
But I didn't think that this would
go into a James Bond zone.

1488
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Uncle!

1489
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:32,166

01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:36,041
All problems of Saajan
Villa will be solved today.

1492
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:37,041
I'll solve it.

1493
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,666
When I come in the evening,
you'll be fully surprised.

1494
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:43,916
If you're buying a full bottle, Betsy
shouldn't know. She'll scold me.

1495
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:47,375
Okay then.

1496
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,625
Bye.
- Bye.

1497
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:27,375
I am Bobin.

1498
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:30,375
Betsy P Saajan's...
I had called you.

1499
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:31,958
Come in.

1500
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:38,333
Well, Mr. James...

1501
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:40,666
She has only me.

1502
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:43,416
I know that you
meet and talk often.

1503
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:47,000
She's going through
a rough phase now.

1504
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:51,291
Everyone needn't think as
progressively as us, right?

1505
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,666
You're not like what
Betsy described, Bobin.

1506
01:43:55,833 --> 01:43:57,500
We both are very close.

1507
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,041
That's why I came
myself to talk about this.

1508
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:03,166
I know that she came here to
meet you day before yesterday,

1509
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,000
and that you were
together in college.

1510
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,708
Since you've understood everything...
- Let me complete.

1511
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:10,750
Since I don't want to approach
this in an uncivilized manner,

1512
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:12,041
if you are interested...

1513
01:44:12,541 --> 01:44:15,041
I am talking about your
affair with Betsy, James.

1514
01:44:17,833 --> 01:44:19,541
Or... are you married?

1515
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:20,875
I'm not married.

1516
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:23,541
By the time I reached this
stage looking after my business,

1517
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:25,416
a lot of time had passed.

1518
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:26,416
Then...

1519
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,750
Since you're talking so openly,
I'll tell you the truth.

1520
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:34,125
I'm only happy to have
a stepmother like Betsy.

1521
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,750
And an uncle like you, Bobin.

1522
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:39,083
So James?
- He's my father.

1523
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:41,250
He was a Professor.
Now he's retired.

1524
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,000
Since it has been around
16 years since my mom died,

1525
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:46,791
Betsy would be a great
company for dad, in this old age.

1526
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:50,750
It was my dad who taught history
to Michael and Betsy in college.

1527
01:44:51,458 --> 01:44:52,833
I wasn't aware of that history.

1528
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:58,625
I knew it from the beginning that you
came here without knowing anything.

1529
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:03,833
Betsy and Michael have been
thinking about divorce for long.

1530
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:07,583
They came here to meet my dad,
to discuss about that, day before.

1531
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:09,958
They have taken a decision as well.

1532
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,083
Before jumping the gun,

1533
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:19,375
if you had spoken privately
for 5 minutes to your own sister,

1534
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,958
did you have to be embarrassed
by coming here like this? - No.

1535
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,041
I'm not embarrassed.

1536
01:45:23,125 --> 01:45:24,708
Admit it, dude.

1537
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,291
Who's that?
Are they people asking for donations?

1538
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,125
No! It's a marriage proposal
for you from Ranni, dad.

1539
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:18,833
When did you come?

1540
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,333
What I said the other day...

1541
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:23,958
Do you have
something else to say?

1542
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:29,041
I'm not feeling good.

1543
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:33,083
Then don't say anything.

1544
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:34,875
Then...

1545
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,125
... you say something.

1546
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:43,375
I have also gone through such
situations in which I didn't feel good.

1547
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:46,541
We don't feel like talking
to anyone about it then.

1548
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:50,916
Even if there's nothing to say,
it's good to have someone with us.

1549
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:55,291
And your behaviour is
like the bun we make...

1550
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:57,083
It will get expired in two days.

1551
01:46:57,458 --> 01:47:01,166
Be it happiness or sorrow,
your feelings last only that much.

1552
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:05,208
Only the bun would know the tension
it goes through, for those two days.

1553
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:09,375
It doesn't know if it would expire, or if
someone would dip it in tea and eat it.

1554
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,500
Hello?

1555
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:01,458
Bobin, it's me.

1556
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:02,875
Yes, uncle.
I have your number.

1557
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:05,000
Hey! I don't think
they would get sold.

1558
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:06,541
People are not buying it.

1559
01:48:07,625 --> 01:48:09,708
Uncle, can you keep
it for some more days?

1560
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:13,333
I've kept it, kiddo.
But no one's buying it.

1561
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:17,000
People don't like the
old cream bun now.

1562
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:19,291
It's shape is so round and...

1563
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:22,708
Okay then...

1564
01:48:26,541 --> 01:48:28,625
Can you at least
lock this shop, son?

1565
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:59,666
'A river is born on this earth'

1566
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:04,666
'The moment streams join'

1567

to flowing together'

1568
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:14,208
'Together, even if the seasons change'

1569
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,250
Hey! Careful!

1570
01:49:15,666 --> 01:49:16,875
To this side.

1571
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,875
'The love that's healing the
wounds within you and me'

1572
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,083

that we forgot to share'

1573
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:35,916

1574

1575
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:50,833

1576
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:57,458

minds of each other'

1577
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,833
'Little sweet nothings'

1578
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:07,000
'Like two sweet hearts
coming together, on their own'

1579

'An autumn to shed leaves,
a spring season to flower'

1580
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:16,500

1613
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:28,500
This is good.

1614
01:54:30,875 --> 01:54:32,125
Awesome shape.

1615
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:33,208
Try it.

1616
01:54:44,958 --> 01:54:50,000
'Then, now and forever,
this place is our own, o dear heart'

1617

'You and I are like day and night'

1618
01:54:56,875 --> 01:54:59,083
Merin, do you like Upma (food item)?

1619
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:01,291
Did you say something, Josh Prakash?

1620
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:03,416
Well, I have brought Upma today.

1621
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:04,625
So?

1622
01:55:04,958 --> 01:55:08,333
Well, since it got burnt a little,
shall we eat out?

1623
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:09,833
Won't that be good?

1624
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:11,166
No, Josh.

1625
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:14,833
True.
Why should I waste the Upma?

1626
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:20,125
Bobin is coming to meet me today.
He's planning to surprise me.

1627
01:55:20,583 --> 01:55:23,125
But he has put up a status on Facebook.

1628
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:24,416
Fool!

1629
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:33,708
'Then, now and forever,
this place is our own, o dear heart'

1630
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:38,708

1631
01:55:38,791 --> 01:55:42,833

1632
01:55:43,333 --> 01:55:48,000

1633
01:55:57,875 --> 01:56:02,500
'Then, now and forever,
this place is our own, o dear heart'

1634
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:06,916
176.
176 calls.

1635
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:09,541
More than 40 messages.
Forwards too.

1636
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:13,041
Did you reply to even one of them?

1637
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:14,125
I want to know.

1638
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:16,083
Merin, what is this?

1639
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:17,958
Did you come all the way here to say this?
- Yes.

1640
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,333
I'm not planning to let you go.

1641
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:21,125
I've come with clear cut decisions.

1642
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:22,125
When are you coming to Ranni?

1643
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:24,833
I'll call the security.
- Do you have badminton socks?

1644
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:25,875
3rd stand.

1645
01:56:26,666 --> 01:56:28,583
What?
- I can get socks in Ranni too.

1646
01:56:29,166 --> 01:56:31,583
Hey! I'm not able to concentrate.

1647
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,125
I'm not able to focus
on my business either.

1648
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,416
Merin, when I am alone...

1649
01:56:37,458 --> 01:56:39,125
When you're alone?
- I'm really sad.

1650
01:56:39,458 --> 01:56:41,833
Am I not sad?
But I'm not switching on my phone, right?

1651
01:56:41,875 --> 01:56:43,000
That's exactly my problem.

1652
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:45,416
Will your problem be solved if I switch on my phone?
- You should pick it up too.

1653
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:46,958
I won't.

1654
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
This is what...

1655
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:50,208
You have no intention of being better?
- Don't say that.

1656
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,250
Then what should I say?

1657
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,166
Bad luck, Josh.
Bad luck!

1658
01:56:54,458 --> 01:56:56,916
What I said that day,
was out of a frustration.

1659
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,916
I know that I was
not politically correct.

1660
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,708
But now I am better.
A change was really necessary for me.

1661
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:04,708
So I've been watching feminist movies off late.
- Big deal!

1662
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,666
Didn't you go for any
movie after coming here?

1663
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:08,750
Get lost!
- I didn't mean anything else.

1664
01:57:08,875 --> 01:57:11,083
Merin, wait.
- Bobin, leave my hand.

1665
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:13,583
Leave my hand, Bobin.
- Did you see the movie 'Thappad'?

1666
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:15,208
In that...

1667
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:17,583
Why did you slap me now?
- I hate you.

1668
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:29,291
Nothing is in its place here.

1669
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:53,041
Uncle!

1670
01:57:54,291 --> 01:57:55,500
Where's the nail cutter?

1671
01:57:56,291 --> 01:57:57,291
Nail cutter!

1672
01:57:57,791 --> 01:58:00,166
Find it yourself.
You're quite old now, right?

1673
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:03,541
Don't cut nails in the night.
- Get lost.

1674
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:05,958
He wants a nail cutter at midnight.

1675
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:14,666
Hello?
- Where's your nail cutter?

1676
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:16,916
What?
- Nail cutter.

1677
01:58:18,083 --> 01:58:21,041
Check in my bathroom.
- I checked there.

1678
01:58:21,625 --> 01:58:23,541
Check properly.

1679
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Check again!

1680
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:26,125
I'll check.

1681
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:29,875
Learn to listen to me first.
Or don't bother asking.

1682
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:32,916
There's nothing here.

1683
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:35,500
Here...

1684
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:36,833
It's here.

1685
01:58:37,416 --> 01:58:38,958
See!
Who's the fool now?

1686
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,291
No.
Not me.

1687
01:58:41,083 --> 01:58:43,708
Instead of troubling me asking
for your underwear and nail cutter,

1688
01:58:43,791 --> 01:58:45,291
why can't you take
care of yourself?

1689
01:58:46,291 --> 01:58:49,291
What happened after you spoke
to Merin's dad? Will it happen?

1690
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:54,875
After all our fights, if there's
any love left, we'll see next year.

1691
01:58:55,625 --> 01:59:00,083
Nothing else. We need to understand each
other much more, before bringing her here.

1692
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:02,750
That's what she also wants.

1693
01:59:03,291 --> 01:59:06,041
So my kid brother has
learned to be responsible.

1694
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:08,958
Get lost.

1695
01:59:09,416 --> 01:59:11,250
Okay then.
- Hey! Hey!

1696
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:14,833
Since I'm not there, are the
uncle and nephew boozing daily?

1697
01:59:15,708 --> 01:59:16,833
A little.

1698
01:59:18,375 --> 01:59:19,375
Okay.

1699
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,208
I won't drink again.

1700
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:05,166
Forgive me.
