1
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,705
This woman was going
to deliver, wasn't she?

2
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,364
Yes, she did deliver the baby but
it died the moment it was born.

3
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,040
Does she know about it?

4
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,207
No, she has not yet
regained consciousness.

5
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,886
- Has this woman delivered twins?
- Yes.

6
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,055
- Does she know about it?
- She is still unconscious.

7
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,389
We will tell her about it when
she will regain consciousness.

8
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,733
There is no need for it.

9
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,406
Shift one of the twins
from that room to this room.

10
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,903
How will a poor rickshaw driver
nurture both the kids?

11
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,579
One will surely remain a Pauper.
Atleast let one become a Prince!

12
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,246
Sir, you are just great! Not all can
understand the method of your treatment

13
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,752
What will they understand
anything about the treatment?

14
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,250
'Wife knoweth not the
worth of thine hubby.'

15
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,428
You know my worth because
you are a sensible man.

16
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,094
What is a treatment?
The patient should get better.

17
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,927
And in it, l am superbly,
superfluously successful.

18
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,434
Tell me! Tell me, who l am?
WHO AM l?

19
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,106
What is my name?
l do not remember anything!

20
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,444
lsn't she the same girl
who had been brought here...

21
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,603
... in an unconscious state
from the sea shore?

22
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,450
l remember nothing.
Who am l?

23
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,610
What is my name?
What is my identity?

24
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,948
- What is your room number?
- Nineteen.

25
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,790
ls Cabaret going on inside?
Go back to your room!

26
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,467
She is pretty!

27
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,465
l cannot bear it anymore, doctor.
My head will surely blow up...

28
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,131
Listen, you have lost your memory
because of this accident.

29
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,811
You are suffering from an amnesia.
But, don't worry.

30
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,140
You will soon be all right.

31
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,249
All right, l understand
that l have lost my memory.

32
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,318
But in this wide world, have l
not a single soul to recognize me?

33
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,487
Why has anyone not
come as yet to meet me?

34
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,654
The world of the silent is
better than my world of solitude.

35
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,328
l do not wish to live.

36
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,829
Please kill me!
Kill me!!

37
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,169
Hey Daya, what are you doing?

38
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,165
Now just wait and watch
what wonder my idea works.

39
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,512
Silence, my dear!
Silence!!

40
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,341
Who are you? Where do you stay?
What is your name?...

41
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,678
We've found out all about it. Just a
few minutes ago your husband visited us

42
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,187
- My husband! - That is right!
Your dear, darling husband!

43
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:41,697
NO! l cannot remember
that l have been married.

44
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,202
When you don't
remember your name,...

45
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,209
... how will you ever remember
anything about your marriage?

46
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,214
You have already been married and
you have even led a married life!

47
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,052
Daya, what is this you are doing?
- Tell me later whatever you have to.

48
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,215
Her husband has told me something
very relevant about her...

49
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,553
... and which is very important
that l inform her about it.

50
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,718
Please all of you,
step outside the room!

51
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,564
Please go.

52
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,567
Where is he right now?

53
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,070
l have sent him out to
get some necessary medicines.

54
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,242
He will be back by 5 in the evening.

55
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,570
But all these days,
why didn't he come to meet me?

56
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,249
He was under a false impression that
maybe you had eloped with someone.

57
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,580
Because of that shock,
he tormented himself...

58
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,747
... by remaining isolated in
a closed room for 10 days.

59
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,424
NO! lt's not like that!

60
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,427
Then his conscience aroused him
that his wife is loyal to him alone.

61
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,599
She can never do such a thing. She
must have surely met with an accident.

62
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,929
He went on a quest
in search for you...

63
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,266
... not in one, but in all the
hospitals of the city did he seek you.

64
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,432
And then finally,
he landed up here.

65
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:54,606
No... l...
l don't seem to understand anything.

66
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,280
Slowly and steadily, you
will grip everything, Asha!

67
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,446
Actually, your husband had
called you by this very name!

68
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,623
Seeing you in this condition,...

69
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,282
... the tears went on streaming
from the poor fellows eyes non-stop.

70
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,294
Dr.Moorti, please come here!
You were watching, weren't you?

71
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,625
Tell her how her husband was
streaming bucket full of tears.

72
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,800
HUSBAND!!
- Which husband??!

73
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,466
The same man who was dressed up in
a worn out coat was speaking to me...

74
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,973
You were watching him, weren't you?
His lamenting cries were so doleful!

75
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,304
- How true! How true...
- See for yourself, Asha.

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,640
Watching your husband on the rack,
his eyes are still watering.

77
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,315
- Take this.
- What is it?

78
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,147
lt is a new saree.

79
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,823
Seeing you clad in a hospital gown
it was very distressing to your hubby.

80
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,993
That is the reason why he has
bought you a brand new saree.

81
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,162
Now, change into it and get dressed.

82
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,330
He is coming in the
evening at 5 to collect you.

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,831
Here, keep it!
Wear it.

84
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,672
What is it?
Keep quiet!

85
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,670
Listen,...

86
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,675
As soon as she will step
out in that new saree...

87
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,006
- No sir, l cannot do that.
- Why?

88
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:10,185
Hey you blockhead.
Haven't you yet grasped the concept?

89
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,181
Doctor is asking you to click the
photograph of the girl's visage...

90
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,361
.. and not to chop it.

91
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,699
l will not leave you!
l will not leave you!!

92
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,868
Till the end,
l will not leave you alone!

93
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,874
Why, when, where...
Do not ask me such silly questions.

94
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,714
Just tell me as to how much percent
chance does an amnesia patient has?

95
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,554
The patient could or could
not regain back their memory.

96
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,882
And hitherto, no one has
yet come to meet her.

97
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,551
Presume that, if she were
never to regain back her memory...

98
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,728
... then, what will
become of her life?

99
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,386
That is for later.

100
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,897
But, when she will inquire
at 5 about where her husband is...

101
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,560
... whom you will present then
before her as her husband?

102
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,240
There is one such man.
'Mr.Bechaara'.

103
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,754
Come on, sonny.
Say, ''Hail, Lord be praised!''

104
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,257
''Hail, Lord be praised!''

105
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,427
Now, greet your mother!

106
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,436
Now, pick up the keys!
Come on! That's a good boy!!

107
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,951
STOP!
l was on my way to your house.

108
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,797
Dr.Dayanand has sent for you.
Right now. At this instance.

109
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,467
You can keep your
sympathy to yourself.

110
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,968
Do not pull me into this mess.
l cannot pull this act.

111
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,805
Hey, what is this you are saying?

112
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,134
Just like that you announced your
verdict like a Supreme court's judge.

113
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,811
l was a fool to have told that
girl that she has a husband...

114
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,980
... who is going to come to
meet her at 5 in the evening.

115
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,308
Now, whom should
l present before her?

116
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,643
Do whatever you want to.
What have l got to do with it?

117
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,479
Why in the world are you taking
me for a sacrificial goat?

118
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,818
You are not a goat but a father
and you even have a ready-made child!

119
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,925
- So what?
- And, you don't even have a wife!

120
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,994
- Yes, so what?? - Thus, you are a
perfect candidate for the vacancy.

121
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,163
Come on, man!
Do not try to make a fool of me!

122
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,821
There are many other relationships
existing in this world.

123
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,830
Why in the world did you ever pick
out a husband and a wife relationship?

124
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,161
You could have made me
her brother, couldn't you?

125
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,829
lt is not the question of relations.
lt is the question of intentions.

126
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,835
Take for example, Dr.Moorti.
What a gentleman he looks, doesn't he?

127
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,671
l had a female intern
training under him.

128
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,347
l had asked her to learn the
job from her brother Moorti.

129
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,507
Now, that female is
carrying his child.

130
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,018
And him?!... lf l were to
relate his deeds to you then...

131
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,852
... Moorti will fall short to the
heights this fellow has reached.

132
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,020
But, you are not like anyone of them.

133
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,194
Even after becoming a husband, you
will still be maintaining your dign...

134
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,300
You can gladly keep your
dignity to yourself, doctor.

135
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,028
l am not going to
give in to your blarney.

136
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,137
You go and seek someone
else for the role.

137
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,365
- Sir, it is already 5!
- Hey mister! STOP!

138
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,043
Never in my life have l ever come
across such a selfish man as you.

139
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,376
Tell me. Was it not you who had
admitted that girl in my hospital?

140
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,220
- Yes! - What yes?
Why don't you answer him?

141
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,719
What else was l supposed to do?

142
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,380
That poor female was lying at
the beach in a wounded condition.

143
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,890
l therefore felt pity for her
and thus brought her here!

144
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,391
Why did you not take
her somewhere else?

145
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,894
Why did you have to bring her
9 kms. afar to my hospital, tell me?

146
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,224
Well, if l had taken her
to another hospital,...

147
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,964
... they would have
demanded the fees and then...

148
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,728
- Then what?
- Then...

149
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,235
lf she would have to be operated,
they would have taken my signature.

150
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,907
And if anything were to happen to
her it would've become a police case.

151
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,065
And, my neck would have
been in the halter's noose.

152
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,905
That is just great! Just to
save your neck from the noose,...

153
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,070
... you are writing a
death warrant on our name.

154
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,416
l put all the rules and
regulations to one side...

155
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,745
... performed a major operation
on that girl just for you.

156
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,580
l am treating her and you cannot
even give me a little help?

157
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,424
l... What can l do?

158
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,593
lf you wish, you can do everything.
But! You don't wish to!!

159
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,523
lt is not enough just
to be born as a human.

160
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,926
A human should also have
self-conscience within him.

161
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,261
And a man without a conscience
is not a man but a beast!

162
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,267
A man who recoils from his
responsibilities is none but a coward.

163
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,166
You will never prosper in your life.

164
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,273
You will never improve!
You are an ungrateful person!

165
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,284
Why don't you button up your coat?
You are dressed up like a roughneck.

166
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,635
This is Anand.
Your husband!

167
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,642
Your wife is now
absolutely fine.

168
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:13,656
No, l do not seem to remember
to have ever seen him before.

169
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,997
See for yourself how he is
stealing his gaze from me.

170
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,099
As if, like a thief, he was
concealing something from me.

171
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,995
You are absolutely right!
He does have shifty eyes!!

172
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,338
That is the reason why when l
had asked him in the morning that...

173
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,667
... when you are persistently
calling her as yours...

174
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,676
... if like you, other's too came
forward and called her as theirs...

175
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,837
... l would surely fall into
a lot of trouble, won't l?

176
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,006
But then he said something so
touching that l had to believe him.

177
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,185
Hey, why are you so quiet?
Why don't you say it?

178
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,517
Why don't you say what you had
told me about her in the morning?

179
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,693
Go on, say it!

180
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,358
He has become somewhat nervous
because you called him a thief.

181
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,034
Now, l will tell you.

182
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:01,367
He told me that, ''Doctor, there is a
black mole on my wife's right thigh.''

183
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,543
And then he asked me that,...

184
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,045
''Could anyone else know about a
wife's secret apart from her husband?''

185
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,213
His question truly
left me dumbfounded.

186
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,894
Yes Asha?

187
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,394
l will go into my room and
check it and see how true he is.

188
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,396
Don't you let him
out of your sight.

189
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,569
lf this mole business
turns out to be a lie then...

190
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,737
... hand this fraud
over to the law...

191
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,733
... so that all his life,
he may remain behind bars.

192
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,078
Don't you worry!

193
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,744
l had chanced to see that black
mole while operating on her.

194
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,074
Doctor, whatever you are
doing is not right!

195
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,921
Maybe, it may not be
right for me, Mr.Anand.

196
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,588
But for this girl! This is the
perfect thing for her. Let's go.

197
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,928
What happened? There is no
mole on your thigh, right?

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,761
Shall l hand this
fraud over to the law?

199
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,928
What he said is absolutely right.

200
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,440
This means that
the problem is solved!

201
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,104
Congratulations!
You have now become a husband!!

202
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,210
Means that now you can
go home with your husband.

203
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,609
Congratulations!!
Come on man, move along now!!

204
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,279
- Anand, give me your purse.
- Purse!

205
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,797
Here, take this tip.
You have served me very well.

206
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,804
Distribute it amongst
yourselves. Take this.

207
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,810
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

208
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,142
l had taken this loan of
thousand rupees from someone...

209
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,645
... to pay for the
rent of the press.

210
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,147
And this Princess gave
it away as a TlP!

211
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,477
How will l ever
survive with her?

212
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,314
l will solve your financial
problem. But remember one thing.

213
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,480
Don't you dare try to reveal her the
truth else she will commit suicide...

214
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,319
... and then you will be
held responsible for it.

215
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,494
Anand, let's go!

216
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:18,675
You have already begun the story
but what will be its climax?

217
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,178
How dare you?

218
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,391
l do not seem to remember that l
have ever seen this house before.

219
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,898
Everything here is new for me.
When did we have this photo clicked?

220
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,909
- l... l myself don't know.
- What? You too don't know!

221
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,246
l mean to say, l don't remember
when we had this photo clicked.

222
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,582
All right then, tell me.

223
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,241
ln this photograph, you seem
to be so happy and smiling.

224
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,420
But, why am l standing
with a drawn face?

225
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,089
- Tell me!
- Oh yes, l remember now!

226
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,918
To have your photo clicked, you
had made a request for a new saree.

227
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,584
But l told you that when
you had so many old ones,...

228
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,252
... why not put one of them on?

229
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,364
And just for this insignificant
matter, you made a long face.

230
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,598
Where is the sound of
the baby coming from?

231
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,942
- ls there a baby in the house?
- Yes.

232
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:04,445
What? Do we even have a baby??
Tell me!!

233
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,448
- Am l a mother of a baby?
- l am a father of a baby.

234
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,298
Listen, l can forget
everything in the accident.

235
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,302
But, can l even forget that
l have given birth to a child?

236
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,801
l don't seem to understand anything!
l will surely turn crazy.

237
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,980
My condition too is just the same.

238
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,976
All right l understand
that l can forget the baby.

239
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,319
But the baby
cannot forget me, can he?

240
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,647
Even after coming into my arms,
he is still going on crying.

241
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,988
Maybe he is hungry.
l will be right back.

242
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,993
Come... come...
Good babies don't' cry!

243
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,826
Don't my child!
My baby!! My child!

244
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,164
My darling is hungry, isn't he?
Come... come... Just wait!

245
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,005
Just a minute!
Just a minute, dear!

246
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,012
What?... What happened?
No,... Don't!

247
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,190
- Oh my God!
- What happened?

248
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,189
The way you got surprised as if
you had seen something quirky.

249
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,362
No, it is nothing like that.

250
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,028
Okay tell me.
Has the baby completed a year?

251
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,197
There is still 2 months left.
- Usually, the babies breast feed...

252
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,303
... till the age of 1 and
a half years, don't they?

253
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,372
That is right. And some babies
even breast feed till they are 2.

254
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,033
l was suckling till l was 3.
- Then, why is the baby not suckling?

255
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,379
The baby will suckle only if
you are capable of, won't he?

256
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,549
l mean to say, some complications
must've been created in the accident.

257
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,378
What nonsense?!! Don't tell me that
such things even happen in accidents.

258
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,716
Your case is a very strange one.
Anything can happen in it.

259
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,891
And Sonu has got used to
feeding from the bottle.

260
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,559
Like a squirrel, he has even
grown two teeth in the front.

261
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,559
For no reason at all, don't take
any risks and quietly bottle feed him.

262
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,891
- The doctor has said that today
you will be discharged. - l know.

263
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,405
Here is your bill.

264
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,075
What? Sixteen thousand six
hundred and seventy five rupees!!

265
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,747
Who am l?
What is my name?

266
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,582
What is this place?
Oh no! l have lost my memory!!

267
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,911
l have got an amnesia!
l have got an AMNESlA!

268
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,917
What? Has another patient
got an amnesia? Who is he?

269
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,027
The patient from Room number 19.

270
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,099
Who am l?
What is my name?

271
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,597
Where was l born?

272
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,104
ln London... ln Russia...
ln Rome... Oh my memory...

273
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,101
Who are you?
Are you the owner of this hotel?

274
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,775
l do not seem to remember anything.
l have got an amnesia.

275
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,115
Nurse, nowadays what is the rate
of the kidneys in the market?

276
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,613
Approximately, it is
around 50 thousand rupees.

277
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,446
Never mind if he is refusing
to clear his accounts.

278
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,451
ln lieu of the bill, we will operate
and extract one of his kidneys...

279
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,285
Doctor, don't do this. l've already
sold off one of my kidneys.

280
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,291
l will surely kick a bucket if
you were to extract the other one.

281
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:08,125
Hotel's bi.. l mean, where do l
have to clear the hospital's bill?

282
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,468
Downstairs.

283
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,137
Seems to be too cunning!

284
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,825
Why has she put all these on
display so late in the night?

285
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,892
Whatever the reason.
What have l got to do with it?

286
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,997
lf l asked her one question, l
will have to answer hundreds of hers.

287
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,991
Oh! So, she is in the bathroom!

288
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,660
Before she comes out,
l should better slip away from here.

289
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,186
You... Bathroom...

290
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:16,189
Now l know how much love,
affection and respect you hold for me.

291
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,196
You were all right in the morning!
Suddenly, what happened to you now?

292
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,539
l have learnt about
your true identity.

293
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,542
What the doctor had said in the
morning was absolutely right!

294
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,873
- What did that crazy man tell you?
- Not he but you are crazy.

295
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,545
That is why when l had vanished,
you had assumed that l had eloped!

296
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,651
What are you saying?

297
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,723
You must have been too cruel to me.
You truly must have had me enthralled.

298
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,227
That is why in all these sarees there
is not but one saree of my choice.

299
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,226
And these jewellery!
All of them are old fashioned.

300
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,396
You must have surely encumbered
me with your substandard choice.

301
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,731
And tired of all this,
l must have tried to commit suicide.

302
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,568
That is why today
my condition is such.

303
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,404
No, it is nothing like that.
- What is nothing like that?

304
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,579
Then, what is the reason of you
coming here and sleeping alone?

305
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,252
Well... the doctor said that you
have not yet recovered completely.

306
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,758
We should therefore sleep separately
on separate beds for a few days.

307
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,931
No, l don't believe you.

308
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,259
Was our marriage an arranged
marriage or was it a love marriage?

309
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,999
Were we at a cordial
relationship with each other...

310
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,603
... or were we fighter cocks
like how we are now?

311
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,602
Until and unless you don't answer
these questions of mine truthfully...

312
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,608
... l will not step into this house.
- Hey... Atleast listen to me!

313
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,285
Listen, you are
already not keeping well.

314
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,281
You will fall sick if you
got wet in the dew drops.

315
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,283
Please, come and sleep inside.

316
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,016
Until and unless you don't tell
me anything about our marital life...

317
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,129
... l will not step into the house.

318
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,314
My beloved, the sweetness of
our union will grow...

319
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,317
... only when we will sit and have
a friendly chat for about an hour.

320
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,654
Will you have any objection...

321
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,756
... if there is a delay in
consummating our marriage?

322
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,825
Your Asha.

323
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,845
Dear Asha, to proliferate the
sweetness of our life,...

324
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,845
... what is an hour but a month
l am ready to chat with you.

325
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,526
Your Anand.

326
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,703
Yes, l am listening.
Go on!

327
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:20,377
Why are you quiet?
Tell me! Go on!!

328
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,679
You are finally awake!
Come.

329
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,174
See, l have
prepared your breakfast.

330
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,018
l have prepared sizzling 'Puris'
and delicious 'Choles'.

331
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,348
l will serve you your tea and you
have your bath and freshen up.

332
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,191
ln the meantime, l will
even prepare your lunch.

333
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:32,025
l should be doing all this!
Why are you doing it?

334
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,192
The doctor has asked you to take
a complete rest for 3 months.

335
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,197
No work at all! Just rest.
- You are so nice!

336
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,699
Without even thinking
what l was saying,...

337
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,209
... God knows what not
l told you last night.

338
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,879
Doesn't matter.
Here, hold this.

339
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,388
lf this is the way to thank
then, what about other things?

340
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,217
Be careful Anand!
You are done for.

341
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,569
Hey you Dum-Dum. You are just sitting
here and dawdling and killing flies?

342
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,906
lf there is no work the least you
can do is dust the machines, right?

343
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,240
Hey boss, what will happen
by dusting the machines?

344
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,907
Why don't you dust our lady luck
that has become so sick in fortune?

345
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,086
Shut up!
You have started to talk a lot.

346
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,744
Hasn't any customer
come since morning?

347
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,256
Many has come; but not hither.
Look thither!

348
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,922
My boss should be
here any minute.

349
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,427
ln the meantime, what would you like?
Hot or cold?

350
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,601
Did you see? They please their
customers with so much...

351
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:48,434
love and respect and etiquette.
But you are of no use at all!

352
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,774
Do you have the tongue in your
mouth or has the cat got it?

353
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,934
Boss, what will the tongue alone do?

354
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,271
The machines in there
are all of a new model.

355
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,107
Absolutely in a fine condition.

356
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,944
And moreover, there are
beautiful ladies to work on them.

357
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,119
Boss, how many times
have l told you that...

358
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,448
... why don't you too hire some
beauties to work in our press?

359
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,454
But, will you believe me?

360
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,286
How much you back answer me.
Why don't you announce to them that...

361
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,122
... the printing at our place
will be done in half the rate.

362
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,957
Come on, speak up before them!

363
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,132
Hear ye! Hear ye!!
Brothers!!!

364
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,295
Every type of printing at our
press is done at half the rate.

365
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,301
Benefactors!... Appreciators!...
Come one... Come all!

366
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,133
Was that okay boss?

367
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,310
What half rate?
We don't want it even for free!

368
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,646
Yes, we don't want it!

369
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,140
Hey you Dum-Dum.
Why don't you call the passer-bys?

370
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,480
lf you dared to lure our customers
then see what l will do to you.

371
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,653
Hey you! Taking me to be a child,
you dare to hector me!

372
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,993
No matter how small
the spear is in size...

373
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,662
... it does keep the larger mammal
like the elephants in control.

374
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,161
- Am l not right, boss?
- l am just a kid before you.

375
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,664
How would l know any
of these things?

376
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:14,016
Who are you?
Why are you crying?

377
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:18,184
When a daughter inquires
her father as to who he is...

378
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,695
... then what else
can he do but cry?

379
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,356
What?
You are my father?!!

380
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,530
Yes.
Your one and only father.

381
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:34,701
Sorry. l have lost all
my memory in an accident.

382
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,710
l know it.
l know all about it.

383
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:42,208
That is the reason why your father
has so lovingly come to meet you.

384
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,723
Here you are my child!
Have these bananas.

385
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,393
Sit.. Sit down.

386
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,231
You are alive and well.

387
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,730
Then, why did my husband
tell me that you were dead?

388
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,561
WHAT?!!

389
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,068
Did your husband tell you
that l was dead?

390
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,571
YES! Why did he ever
tell me such a big lie?

391
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,239
What do l say dear? The amount of
gold l had promised to give you...

392
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,247
in your dowry... l fell short with
just 20 grams of gold.

393
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,085
Well, my son-in-law got annoyed
on something so trivial.

394
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,914
Do you know as to what he told me?
That he didn't even wish to see me.

395
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,090
''From today on, you are
as good as DEAD for me.''

396
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,751
He behaved so rudely with you!
Let him come.

397
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,421
- See what l will do to him.
- No! Don't do anything silly.

398
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,102
My child, is your
burden not enough for him?

399
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,272
lf he came to know that his
father-in-law had come here...

400
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:40,433
he will be shocked. Child, l had
come to meet you and so l met you!

401
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,105
l will take your leave now.
- How can you leave just like that?

402
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,283
You will have to have lunch and
then only can you leave. Okay!

403
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,954
Daddy, do you always pray to the
Lord in this way before eating?

404
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,130
l am not saying my prayers to
the Lord but to my Son-in-law.

405
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,299
A son-in-law who is more greater
to me than the Lord Almighty.

406
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,458
Who is the Giver of Food!
Hail, my son-in-law!

407
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:09,470
- What should l start with?
Yes, this... - Slowly...

408
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,810
Every grain of food bears
the name of its consumer.

409
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,307
Wait dad, have the beetle nut later.
First, drink up this almond syrup.

410
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,160
Oh Lord!
Have mercy!!

411
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,329
ls this cursed silver kettle
still present in the house?

412
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,158
- Cursed kettle?
- Dear, you don't remember anything!

413
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,335
lt is because of this kettle
that this house is jinxed.

414
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,834
lt is all because of this!
Throw it away! Throw it!!

415
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,673
Wha... What have you done?
Why did you ever throw this kettle?

416
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,173
Child, this cursed kettle was
responsible for your accident.

417
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,345
Goodness gracious!
What a terrible accident that was!

418
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,004
Just the thought of it makes me
shiver with fright. Lord, have mercy!

419
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,351
''Romeo is my name and
Stealing is my game.''

420
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,196
What is the matter?

421
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,032
Does money mean everything
for a man in this world?

422
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,042
- When did l say this?
- When did you say this??

423
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,875
A man demanding dowry should
drown himself in shame.

424
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,039
l didn't take a single
penny in the dowry.

425
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,378
To conceal a lie, one has to go on
fabricating more lies to cover it up.

426
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,385
Why are you beating around the bush?
Why don't you come clear?

427
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,217
- My daddy had visited me.
- What is that?

428
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,222
Your daddy had come by?
Thank God!

429
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,558
Where is your daddy?
Where is he?

430
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,403
lf you do not even
wish to see his face,...

431
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,562
... do you think that he will
stand here waiting for you?

432
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,074
What do you mean?
- What you fell short of some...

433
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,906
trivial amount of gold in the dowry
you declared my living father dead!

434
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,247
What rubbish are you talking?
Gold... Dowry....!

435
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,906
You may detest my father
but he truly loves you dearly.

436
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,417
That is the reason why he
had bought us two bananas.

437
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,249
- One for you and one for me.
- B A N A N A S!

438
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,924
One for YOU and one for ME!
There sure is something wrong.

439
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,424
Madam, after your father came
and till the time he left...

440
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,587
... tell me all about it in detail.

441
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,263
l have been Mugged!
l am Ruined!!

442
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:25,431
That con-man carried off my cent
pure silver ware. That thief, mugger!

443
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,771
Anand, shut up! Dare if you
called my father a thief!

444
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,608
That fellow... That fellow was
not your daddy but a swindler.

445
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,115
He just gifted you 2 bananas and in
return you gifted him a silver ware!

446
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,622
Well, what's happened has happened.

447
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,451
Don't you speak a word
about this to anyone.

448
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,287
Else, the people will think
that by just gifting two bananas...

449
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,621
... this stupid girl will
give away anything in return.

450
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,287
Then the people will not
just bring 2 bananas but...

451
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,956
a whole banana tree to gift it to you

452
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,463
l do not wish to hear any excuses.

453
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,469
l must have been crazy to have given
you the loan of such a big amount.

454
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,641
While taking the loan, you had sworn
to pay it back in a month's time.

455
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,642
lt has been so many months now. l
think, you've gone back on your word.

456
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,974
Listen, please speak softly. From the
next month, marriage season will begin

457
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,141
- l will anyhow...
- Shut up! Don't make any excuses!

458
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,479
Marriage cards are too far-fetched.
ln this jinxed press of yours,...

459
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,816
... no one will even come to have
the cards for the last rites printed.

460
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,151
Hey you!
Mind your language!

461
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,327
- Dum-Dum, please be quiet!
- How do l remain quiet?

462
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,496
You too owe me 3 month's
salary, don't you?

463
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,155
But, am l shouting my lungs out
and making an issue about it?

464
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,334
Hey you! lf you speak another
word, l will give such a tight slap...

465
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,163
... that all your baby teeth
will fall out one by one.

466
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,497
What is that you just said? You will
break my teeth! Come on, BREAK lT!!

467
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,334
Dum-Dum, what are you doing?
- Boss, you be quiet!

468
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,668
Listen mister, l may be scared of
you as l am younger to you.

469
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,505
But, this dagger won't be afraid
of you. lt will slice you up!

470
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,510
- Dum-Dum, what are you doing?
- Boss, you be quiet!

471
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,615
Right now, all that l can
think of is Blood! Come on!!

472
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:44,017
Pay my loan later but first,
get rid of this imp.

473
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,189
What was that?

474
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,187
What are you thinking boss?

475
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,857
That you owe me 3 month's salary
and that l may again use the blade!

476
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,195
But, don't you worry about it.
l am true to your salt.

477
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,371
l will never behave this way with you!

478
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,534
l am thinking that it is
better to shut down this press.

479
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,871
This too is right! There's not a
single amount of profit from this press

480
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,547
But then, what will you do?

481
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,546
Will you again get back to
the same old job by the beach?

482
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,550
No Dum-Dum. l do not wish
to go back there again.

483
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,715
That very job took away
everything of mine.

484
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,892
Then what?

485
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,391
Some old jewellery of my wife is
just lying idle in the house.

486
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,064
l will sell them off and start
a new venture, a new business.

487
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,576
- This is our house, isn't it?
- l too am thinking just the same.

488
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:55,081
lsn't it beautiful? And did you see?
l modernized the whole house!

489
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,260
This is nothing! Why don't you come
inside and have a look!!

490
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:06,262
Boss you seem to be such a simpleton
but in fact you are not what you seem!

491
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,267
- What rubbish are you talking?
- What is all this?

492
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,441
- Where did you find her?
- Listen, this is a very long story.

493
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,269
l will tell you all
about it later, okay!

494
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,106
Boss, the wise guys have
already got the message.

495
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,611
The ones who didn't
are but the fools.

496
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,615
But boss, whatever.
''You'r... Simply lrresistible!!''

497
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,786
Listen, stop shaking
and remain silent.

498
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,287
See, l brought so
many toys for Sonu.

499
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:31,458
See how he is enjoying.
And these are all Sonu's dresses.

500
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,630
Come this way.

501
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,300
Absolutely modern.

502
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,305
Did you notice something in this?

503
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,805
l myself designed these sartorial
attires and got them stitched.

504
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,983
From where did you get
the cash to buy all these?

505
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,310
Hadn't l told you that all my
jewellery had become out of fashion?

506
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,422
That is why, l did not keep even
one. l disposed off all of them.

507
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,820
''Come, let's go back
from where we had begun.''

508
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,834
What's this, Anu? Have we come here
for a picnic or to attend a funeral?

509
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,341
Why are you standing here
with a sullen, blown up face?

510
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,684
Tell me, what happened?
What happened!!?

511
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,689
Look at them.
How well they are enjoying.

512
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,021
You don't know how
to enjoy life at all!

513
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,030
- l myself am ruined now.
- All right, atleast let me enjoy!

514
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,211
- Can l join your party?
- Welcome!!

515
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,718
l didn't have a beer since long.
Looks imported!

516
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,403
Let me tell you something, pal. lt's
not as strong as our lndian beverages.

517
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,065
One gets inebriated only after
imbibing around 3 to 4 cans of beer.

518
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,079
The guitar is just lying idle around
here and no one is playing it?

519
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,581
- Because Rocky didn't turn up.
- Our friend!

520
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,425
He sings and plays
the guitar very well!

521
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,427
Look over there!

522
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,430
Ladies special has arrived.

523
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,759
lf Rocky had been present here now
then, seeing these beauties...

524
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,426
... he would have sung and played
so well that what do l say?

525
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,772
ls that so?

526
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:01,441
l too am not less than Rocky.
Now watch what l do.

527
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,781
Let me wet my tongue a bit.

528
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,325
NO... NO... NO...

529
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,992
Now, l can no longer squander
away my wealth for that girl.

530
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,331
Doctor, she sold off
all my jewellery.

531
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,503
And what did l get in return?

532
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,337
This shirt bearing
the trade mark of AA!

533
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,002
l am roaming around with this same
trade mark not only on my clothes...

534
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,341
... but my underwear too
bears this trade mark.

535
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,348
By keeping that girl with me,
what difficulties l am facing...

536
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,454
... l cannot even
describe it to you.

537
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:10,021
Once... Just once again please
put up the advertisement...

538
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,685
... in the media to find out
the whereabouts of her family.

539
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,699
Didn't l tell you that now l can
no longer spend a penny for her.

540
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:23,362
You don't spend your buck
but l will spend my brains off...

541
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,368
... and find out
everything about her.

542
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,535
Just a minute!
Do you have brains to spend?

543
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,715
You will soon know
about it when from here,...

544
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,818
... l will go straight to
the Azad police station.

545
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,886
What ever will you do on
reaching there, Mr.Anand?

546
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,555
What will l ever do???

547
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,384
l will hand over her photograph
to the lnspector and say that...

548
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:45,892
... this girl has forgotten
everything of her past.

549
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,554
She is suffering from amnesia
and right now, she is with me.

550
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,234
lf you will be kind enough to please
find about her past whereabouts.

551
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,404
Then by hook or by crook,...

552
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,735
... they will have to unearth
her past from the lost time.

553
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,742
- Anand, atleast listen to me!
- Now, l will hear nothing.

554
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,079
The waves have already become
turbulent and frenzied.

555
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,909
Try to stop it and you
yourself will drown in it.

556
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:25,090
- Hello, l am Dr.Anand speaking.
- Doctor!

557
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,597
ls the burning sensation
still prevailing?

558
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,999
Has the pain subsided or not?

559
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,936
The burning sensation
has ceased completely.

560
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,435
And the pain too has
subsided to much extent.

561
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,607
lt is all by the miracle
of your medicine.

562
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,771
Well, a patient left our hospital
before being completely cured.

563
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,449
He is the owner of a press.
His name is Anand Verma.

564
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,788
Just a minute, doctor.

565
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,294
He is suffering from amnesia.
He has lost his memory.

566
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,790
Yes, the poor chap has been affected
so badly because of this illness...

567
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,900
... that, he cannot even
seem to remember his own wife!

568
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,470
He visits every police
station of the city and...

569
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,139
... and handing his wife's
photograph, enters a report that...

570
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,470
... his wife has lost her memory and
requests them to seek out her family.

571
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,805
This is such a difficult case!

572
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,815
Now, if that patient happens to come
to your station to lodge a complaint..

573
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:18,479
- ... don't take him seriously.
- l will handle everything.

574
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,495
Greetings to you, lnspector.

575
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,155
My name is Anand Verma.

576
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,512
l am coming.

577
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,854
Oh Lord!
Come...

578
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,195
How is your press doing?

579
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,858
Sir, how did you know
that l own a press?

580
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,035
We cops know everything
about everyone.

581
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,871
You must have surely
got a photograph too.

582
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,606
Well, the image of the law in the
eyes of the public is somewhat...

583
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,144
... Bad!
- But seeing you l felt that,...

584
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,215
... before you the cops from
the Scotland Yard too will...

585
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,045
... fall short of my esteem!
- Here, look at this.

586
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,225
- This girl is...
- ... A patient of amnesia, right?

587
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,558
She has forgotten all
about her past life, right?

588
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,058
l have to seek out her family, right?

589
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,734
Sir, you are not
an lnspector but a Magician!

590
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,730
Look over here sir!
See, l have got goose-pimples!!

591
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,896
l saw them.

592
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,065
l don't know what words do
l use to sing your praises.

593
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,243
You don't have to do anything.

594
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,254
The responsibility of finding out
her family now lies on my shoulders.

595
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:03,585
Llsten, you shouldn't roam around bare
headed in this sweltering afternoon.

596
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,422
lt has bad effect on the mentality.

597
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,257
- You just go home and relax.
- Sir, that is a very nice thing.

598
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,366
But, the sooner you seek them ou...
- Didn't l tell you that...

599
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,435
...now the responsibility is mine?
Don't you worry.

600
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,102
And listen!
One more thing.

601
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,764
You should rub lemon very hard
on your head and have a bath.

602
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,604
Why so?
- The heat of the brains subsides...

603
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,680
and the mind becomes more cooler.

604
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,118
Well that l...

605
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,295
l will make a move, sir.

606
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,335
Hadn't l told you last night that

607
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,495
... you will be waking up late in
the morning? Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,171
l have just come out fresh
from a bath. Let go of me!

609
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,503
That is good even more!

610
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,342
- How come you are over here?
- l had come to do some shopping.

611
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:39,183
- Really!
- Thief! Thief!!

612
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:43,519
Someone stop him!! Help!! Help!!!
- Hey Asha, what happened?

613
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,355
Asha, what are you doing?

614
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,862
l am going to follow that
chain snatcher and try to catch him.

615
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,033
What's that?
You will follow that thief?

616
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:54,032
That too in a car?!
-You've never seen me driving, have you

617
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,705
Witness today how
fast l race the car.

618
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,374
No! l cannot take this risk.

619
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,375
l will take Sonu with me and
then do whatever you wish to.

620
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:06,375
Hey, what are yo...
Hey, have you gone nuts?!!

621
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,212
You are so scared!
- Shut up and stop the car.

622
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,549
Will you please keep quiet?!
- How can l? Oh no...

623
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,723
Asha...
Asha, you will surely kill us both.

624
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,900
STOP THE CAR!!

625
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,573
What are you doing?

626
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,416
Son seems like...

627
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,575
... today we are surely going
to become the food for the worms.

628
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,855
Dear Lord, help us!!

629
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,434
Hey, why are you pulling him?
He will die!!

630
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,432
Oh no!
He has had it now!!

631
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,962
Now tell me Anu.
How did you find my driving?

632
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,630
To hell with your driving.
Don't know whose car this is.

633
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,461
And see what condition
you have brought it into.

634
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,126
Now, what will we tell its owners?
Look at what this is.

635
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,302
Don't you worry at all about it.

636
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,306
This car and that necklace
both belong to me.

637
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,308
l don't care about
the damages to the car.

638
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,641
We will have to praise
both you husband and wife...

639
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,751
... for courageously
following those muggers.

640
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,483
Sir, the Superintendent of Police
would like to meet you.

641
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,656
- Who me?
- Yes you.

642
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,492
- Please hold him.
- lsn't the baby cute?

643
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,160
Have you ever taken part
in a car race before?

644
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,003
To have chased such a notorious
gang and have them nabbed?

645
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,503
Sir, not me but that
girl had driven the car.

646
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,846
- Yes sir! - There is a photograph
lying in the dashboard of the car.

647
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,514
Get it.

648
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,532
Mister, someone had
lodged a complaint...

649
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,692
... in the Sunder Nagar police
station of her being missing.

650
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,030
How are you related to this girl?

651
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,367
No sir, l am not related
to her in any way.

652
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,702
She...She is suffering from amnesia.
She has lost her memory, sir!

653
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,879
Sir, she is holding onto me
for no reason at all!

654
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,981
Sir, take her away from
me somehow or the other.

655
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,050
Take her away, please!

656
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,722
Sorry for interrupting but, could
you please come here for a minute?

657
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,887
For what?
- l've to tell you an important thing

658
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,225
Don't you see that here too l
am going for an important work?

659
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,557
Sir, l wish to tell you
something about that only!

660
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:16,572
What is it?

661
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,241
Sir, the man whom
you were questioning...

662
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,401
... in fact, he himself
is suffering from amnesia.

663
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,579
- WHAT?
- He is a local man.

664
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,738
l know him very well.
He owns a printing press.

665
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,917
Then, who is that girl?

666
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,086
This girl is not
a girl but his wife!

667
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,188
Didn't you see the baby
she is carrying in her arms?

668
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,593
All that is fine but
someone has lodged a complaint...

669
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,594
... of her being missing in the
nearby Sunder Nagar police station.

670
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:45,094
Who must have lodged that complaint?
- Who else? He must've lodged it.

671
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,599
He visits every police
station of every city...

672
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,602
... and leaves back a
photograph of his wife there.

673
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,001
He himself is an amnesiac but...

674
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,268
... declares that his wife
is suffering from it.

675
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,603
He has even given me a photograph.
Look for yourself.

676
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,713
The Chief minister too
must be having a copy of it.

677
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,282
l mean, the Prime minister
too must be having one.

678
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,119
Oh no, what are you thinking sir?

679
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,017
This is the case of my precinct
and l shall solve it.

680
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,784
Don't you worry. You may go.
Just a minute, sir!

681
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,622
Sir, l would request you to stay
at a distance from that man.

682
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,463
He becomes very vicious and violent
when he suffers a seizure.

683
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,470
- Sir, that girl...
- Dare if you come near me!

684
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:22,968
- Sir, but that girl is...
- l am warning you!

685
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,802
l will shoot you otherwise!
Constable, quickly get into the car!

686
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,977
Move aside!
l said, move aside!!

687
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,972
Sir,... Sir, where are you
going? Atleast, listen to me!!!

688
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,152
Dum-Dum, what are you staring at
just standing over there?

689
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,484
Come and lend me a hand.
Stand right here.

690
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,656
Why have you stopped
the car over here?

691
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,318
You had said that today
is Munni's birthday...

692
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,828
... and that we will be
going to the temple!

693
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,328
We have reached the temple.

694
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,433
- Munni
- Yes daddy?

695
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,661
You will find uncle in the press.
Go to him and take his blessings.

696
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,168
Okay daddy.

697
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,074
- Munni, you over here!
- Give me your blessings, uncle!

698
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,179
Long may you live
and happy may you be.

699
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,345
Take this uncle.
Today is my birthday.

700
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,344
ls it really?
Happy birthday dear.

701
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:20,689
- l had completely forgotten.
- ls this something to forget?

702
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,027
That scene has frozen into the
depths of my heart like a picture.

703
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,895
To swim in this condition
is very dangerous.

704
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,250
My Sonu looks so handsome
with this cap on!

705
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,420
Hey, are you not a bit ashamed?
This is not our house!

706
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,424
No matter where we are, l can
lovingly feed my wife anywhere.

707
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,773
Be careful Munni.

708
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,450
Will you be having something?
No!

709
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,115
Will you be having it after 2 months
when you will have grown your teeth?

710
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,306
- Asha, what happened to you?
- ls anyone there!

711
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,307
- Help!
- Someone help!!

712
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,639
- Someone save my child!
- HELP!!

713
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,807
Someone quick, save my child!
HELP!! What do l do?

714
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,992
Shyamu, a child is drowning.
l will go and save her.

715
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,094
ln the meantime, take care of Asha.

716
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,846
Thanks a million, Dear Lord!

717
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,693
Don't you worry.
She has just consumed some water.

718
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,522
Beat her lightly on her back.
She will be quite all right.

719
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:07,596
My child!

720
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,377
What happened doctor?
How is my Asha?

721
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,715
You were late in bringing her in.

722
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,047
lf only you had brought her
10 minutes earlier then maybe...

723
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,892
NO...

724
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:58,411
Master, his job is of a coast guard.
He saves the wretched drowning souls.

725
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:03,248
A few minutes ago, Munni had
gone for a swim in the waters.

726
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,588
She got caught in the
turbulent, surging waves.

727
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:11,081
At that very instant,
his wife suffered an attack.

728
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:16,762
The poor female was suffering in
agonizing pain but he didn't care.

729
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,602
And leaving her in pain,
he jumped into the waters...

730
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,705
... to save Munni for
the sake of his duty.

731
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,107
Munni's life was saved but...

732
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,945
Savitri, l have always
been weak in maths.

733
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,442
But, l do know this much that if
we were to unite two negatives...

734
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,622
... it becomes a positive.

735
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,956
Here, Anand has lost his wife and
there Asha has lost her memory.

736
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,625
Both are all alone in this world.

737
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,632
l united them both thinking that
maybe both would support each other.

738
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,975
What, again bananas?!!
Who had visited you today?

739
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,085
And this time,
what did you give him away?

740
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:14,986
l am not a child to give
away anything to anyone.

741
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,158
Today again my daddy has come.

742
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,487
That means, that same
fraud has come back again...

743
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,663
... who had carried off my
silver ware the other day?

744
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:27,002
What's this? My silver kettle!
Where did you find it?

745
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,001
You didn't searched it properly.
lt was lying somewhere in the bushes.

746
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,504
My dad found it lying outside
so he brought it inside.

747
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,176
Where is he?
Where is your daddy?

748
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,519
What is this?
That is strange!

749
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,526
He had come in just now.
Where did he disappear?

750
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,693
Did he disappear? First see what
else has disappeared with him.

751
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:04,703
- What?!! - l had such big brass
lamps right there! Where did they go?

752
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:08,707
''Romeo is my name and
Stealing is my game.''

753
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:11,205
''l steal wares and lamps...''

754
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,879
l don't know anything.
Don't ask me anything man!

755
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,053
Why shouldn't l? You are always
stuck with him, aren't you?

756
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,052
Whenever l ask him for money for
shopping or ration he clearly tells...

757
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,715
me that he hasn't any or
he tells me to take a loan.

758
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,561
Furthermore, whenever l asks him for
money to buy something for Sonu...

759
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,391
... he postpones it
for the next month.

760
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:31,726
Sister-in-law!
The ant goes where there is sugar.

761
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,069
There is a Beauty press
next to ours.

762
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,398
The owner of that press,
Beauty Aunt is...

763
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,752
Well Beauty aunt!
What are you staring at?

764
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,248
This is what you call
'Tit for Tat!'

765
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,926
What kind of a miracle is this?

766
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,258
The flies are swarming
around in the Beauty press.

767
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,768
And customers are swarming
around my press!

768
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,763
Seems like, lady luck
has finally smiled upon me.

769
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,269
That is right.
Totally!!

770
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,771
How many cards do you
wish to get printed?

771
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,276
- One thousand.
- Thanks a million, Dear Lord!

772
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,280
Let us make it two
thousand, shall we?

773
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,450
As you please.

774
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,948
But our rate is a bit higher
than our neighbouring press.

775
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,781
l hope you don't have
any problem with that.

776
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,117
No, l don't have
any problem at all!

777
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,792
One doesn't see the price
when the quality is good.

778
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:36,120
There is a vast difference
between their quality and ours.

779
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,808
You have come!
Come inside.

780
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,136
l will take the order.
You start with the printing.

781
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:54,141
- Two men can enter.
- No one will enter.

782
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,807
- NO ONE will ENTER!
- Why so?

783
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,977
- We are going in a queue!
- We don't need your order.

784
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,155
We are not giving the
order to you but to the girl.

785
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,154
Didn't l say, we don't need
your order! Get lost from here!

786
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,988
Move aside!
- What did you do?

787
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:11,997
You scared away all the customers.
- Who told you to... Hey, get lost!

788
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,659
- What are you doing? - Who
asked you to make a show over here?

789
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,838
Show!
What kind of a show?

790
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,340
Were you not ashamed to
wear this prurient outfit?

791
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,511
Why?
What is wrong with this dress?

792
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,839
l am not wearing a two-piece
swimming costume, am l?

793
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,182
Come on, go home!

794
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,181
You cannot make a penny worth
of profit from this press.

795
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,183
Because, those beauties
from that Beauty press...

796
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,845
... entice the customers
with their sensuality.

797
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,015
Did you not see? How a long
queue was formed...

798
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,193
... outside our shop when l
too showed my voluptuous beauty.

799
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,852
Henceforth, l will handle this press.
- Are you going back home or not?

800
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,305
First of all,
you are exhibiting your body...

801
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,204
... and secondly, you are back
answering me!! Go back home?

802
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,043
- ls anyone home?
- What do you want?

803
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,049
l have come from
the Electricity Department.

804
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,882
l want to take the meter reading.
Please give me your card.

805
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,057
All right, please
wait for a minute.

806
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,568
- Please give me the card!
- Collect it tomorrow. Go now.

807
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,592
Who is she?

808
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,093
l found it inside the
table-drawer of our very own house.

809
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,092
Therefore, don't you dare try
and tell lies that you know nothing.

810
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,769
Tell me, who is she?
- Listen, you are taking me all wrong.

811
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,872
What l am thinking
is absolutely right!

812
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,940
She is your MlSTRESS!!

813
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,608
Why did you stop?
Why don't you go ahead and hit me?

814
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,283
HlT ME!

815
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:15,450
l stayed in the hospital for so
long and not once did you visit me.

816
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,118
Even after coming back home,
you made some or the other excuse...

817
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,295
and kept me at a distance from you.

818
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:23,294
Now l know that
between you and me,...

819
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,400
... it is not my illness
but this GlRL!

820
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,305
You used to say that
the press is not doing well.

821
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:34,472
Now l know as to why your
work was going on well.

822
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,304
l hadn't thought in
my wildest of dreams that...

823
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,471
... you would turn out to be
so disloyal and unfaithful to me.

824
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,981
lf you love this witch so much
then, get her into this house.

825
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,154
l will go away somewhere
with my son, Sonu.

826
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,657
Listen Anand,
l can bear everything.

827
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,318
But, l can never bear this.

828
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,659
Anand is completely innocent.

829
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,503
He is not to be
blamed for this at all.

830
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,605
Actually, l am the
root cause of all this.

831
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,835
Watching you both fight, l don't
wish to conceal anything from you.

832
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,345
l therefore wish to
tell you everything about it.

833
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,505
Actually, this girl
in the photograph is...

834
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,014
... a nurse, Kamla who
works in my hospital.

835
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,189
ln order to give
you a shock treatment...

836
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,348
... l intentionally had
this photo kept in your drawer.

837
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,689
l had thought that maybe this shock
would bring back your lost memory.

838
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,694
This poor chap doesn't
know a thing about it.

839
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,361
You are a stupid,
foolish and a fatuous doctor.

840
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,025
ls such a type of a shock
treatment ever given to a patient?

841
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,364
- But, l had thought that...
- But what?

842
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:39,031
ln this shocking business of yours,
our happy home would have shaken up.

843
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,049
Anu, please forgive me.

844
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,548
Please Anu, forgive me!

845
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,551
Oh! The zipper of your pant
has unzipped!! Fasten it!!!

846
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,557
l was justjoking
to enliven your mood.

847
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:45,106
Anu, the doctor had prescribed that...

848
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,769
Hey, hadn't l told you to keep a
continent forbearance from me?

849
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,936
Then, why did you come close to me?
- Hey, what is wrong with you now?

850
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:52,613
Why are you shouting at me so much?
- QUlET!

851
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,773
What if something were to happen?

852
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:59,948
Why are you being so tensed about it?
- Don't you dare TOUCH me!

853
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,790
MURDER.. M U R D E R... Help!
- QUlET! Else l will break you head!

854
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,460
lt is now a matter
of my life and death.

855
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,626
You come with me to my house
right now and get that bombshell...

856
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,738
- ... A bombshell!
- Yes, that girl is a bombshell.

857
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,137
Come with me right away. Get that
girl and keep her in your house.

858
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,138
First wait and tell me
as to what has happened.

859
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,646
What is there to say? What was never
supposed to happen has happened.

860
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,480
Today, l committed
a very big mistake.

861
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,151
Mistake!
You already committed it!!

862
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,333
- Yes!
- Why are you calling them?

863
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,163
What is the occasion that you
are singing and dancing around?

864
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:50,497
Today is really a
very auspicious day for us.

865
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:54,837
Savitri arrange for a fabulous party
for all the staff of our hospital.

866
01:11:55,878 --> 01:12:01,339
- Party, for what?
- Doctor you are taking me all wrong!

867
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,008
There is only one meaning of a mistake
committed between a man and a woman.

868
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,688
Remember that movie, 'Ek Hi Bhool!'
- No doctor!

869
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,189
The thing is that, l was
sleeping on my bed in the morning.

870
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,361
All right.
- She came and stood just next to me.

871
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,190
- Then!
- Taking her to be my wife...

872
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,357
in my sleep l pulled
her into my arms.

873
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:21,195
This is the starting
point of a creation.

874
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,362
- What happened next?
- Nothing happened next.

875
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,870
l woke up and
jostled her away from me.

876
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,885
Useless fellow!

877
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,223
Doctor, just think
about it carefully.

878
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:46,724
The dignity of an unmarried girl is
more precious to her than her life.

879
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:52,393
lf anything was to happen today,
l would have never forgiven myself.

880
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,398
Get up doctor. You come with
me right now to my house.

881
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,733
And tell her the truth
that her name is not Asha.

882
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,241
She has lost her memory.
And just for her treatment,

883
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,575
you made me her fictitious husband.
Tell her that she is a spinster.

884
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,739
We both have not been married.
She and l are not related in any way.

885
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,851
Come and tell her everything.
Told her.

886
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,253
What have you told her?

887
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,774
Please forgive me.

888
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,270
l am not less to be blamed for
the pack of lies the doctor told you.

889
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:41,446
lf possible then, take this
all as a dream and forget it.

890
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,279
We both are not related at all.

891
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,791
All my hard work went into vain.
l lost everything anticipating a gain.

892
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,302
Hey, why don't you draw the curtains?

893
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,309
- Did that girl go?
- No, she is standing right here.

894
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,152
- Did she have anything?
- She didn't even have water.

895
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,834
Has any doctor in
this whole wide world...

896
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,993
... ever done such a foolish
treatment of his patient?

897
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,333
A Jackfruit may seem to be
very prickly from its exterior...

898
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,841
... but from within, it is as
much sweeter and savoring to taste.

899
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,671
My treatment was...

900
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:52,346
This is your girl, isn't she?
lf she too were to lose her memory...

901
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,855
will you give her away to any Tom,
Dick or Harry, how you gave me away?

902
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,693
Tell me!
Answer me!!

903
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,364
Shall l tell you something?

904
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,863
l took you too as my own
daughter and did such a thing.

905
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,370
l swear by my daughter.

906
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:18,877
You remembered nothing and your
loved ones had forgotten you.

907
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,875
Then, l started
to worry about you...

908
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,049
... not as a doctor but
as a father of a girl.

909
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:29,713
How could l have let a homeless,
unmarried, amnesiac lass...

910
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,886
... out into the world
to wander alone?

911
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,397
l therefore handed you
over to Anand.

912
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,735
Anand is not any layman.

913
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,729
ln the line of his duty, while
saving the life of someone...

914
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,409
... he put the life of his wife
into the pyres of sacrifice.

915
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,412
He is a gentleman of
a very noble character.

916
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,412
This is the very reason why though
staying in the same room with him..

917
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,413
... till today your chastity
has remained unblemished.

918
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:04,756
Child, you did not and still don't
remember anything about your past.

919
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,929
But, between that
past and the present...

920
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,431
... a new story has taken
birth in the twilight zone.

921
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,935
Think about it with a
cool mind and then decide.

922
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,438
Do you wish to
carry on this story further...

923
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,774
... or do you wish
to end it right here?

924
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,684
What is the matter? You seem
to be jumping with excitement!

925
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,857
ls it because you
have seen your mother?

926
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,040
You have come back again!

927
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,868
Didn't l tell you that we
both are not related in any way?

928
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:50,704
Then, why have you
come back again over here?

929
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,711
lf you calmed down a bit...

930
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,043
... only then will l have
the guts to tell you something.

931
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:59,216
You gave a homeless girl like me
a place in your house to stay.

932
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,722
l am very grateful to you for it.

933
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,718
And, l sold off all
the jewellery of your wife...

934
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,893
... and called her names.
l am very sorry for all that.

935
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,732
- Please forgive me!
- Anything else?

936
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,902
- Oh yes! One more thing.
- Speak that out too.

937
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,399
l am in...
l am in love with you.

938
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,577
W H A T??!
- Yes Anand.

939
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:24,745
l have come to you
to be your real wife now.

940
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,075
The day and the time both seem to
be quite auspicious for the moment.

941
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:31,411
Why don't you take me
as your wife before God?

942
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,924
Quiet!
Why are you getting so excited?

943
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,253
Listen, l cannot
fulfill this wish of yours.

944
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,764
Let me live as l am
and go away from here.

945
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:47,097
No Anand, don't say this.

946
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,104
Staying together since so many days...

947
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,763
... l have created an affection and
an affinity towards you and Sonu.

948
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,110
Now l cannot live
away from you both.

949
01:21:56,311 --> 01:22:01,271
Listen, time is the best teacher.
You are an educated girl.

950
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,619
And by your conduct it looks
like you come from a rich family.

951
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:08,281
Have some patient and you will
soon gain back your lost memory.

952
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,625
Then, better men than me from
the aristocratic families...

953
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,454
... will come seeking
your hand in marriage.

954
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,619
l just need your
hand for my marriage.

955
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,467
You won't understand this way.
Come with me.

956
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,795
Now you will not stay in my house
for even a minute. Come on!

957
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:24,801
Let go of my hand! One does not
even throw a dog out in this manner.

958
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,467
l myself will walk out. But before
l leave, give me back my virginity.

959
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:32,476
- What??
- Yes, give me back my chastity.

960
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,809
Your chastity!
Whatever have l done with you?

961
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,315
What again?! Have you forgotten
what you did to me yesterday?

962
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:44,824
- What had l done? - Weren't you
going crazy holding me in your arms?

963
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:47,821
lt was all your mistake.
When l was in the arms of slumber,...

964
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,487
... why did you ever come
and stand next to me?

965
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,997
lf unknowingly,
just for two seconds l..

966
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,495
Listen mister. l don't care
how many seconds that was.

967
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,672
First of all, you say that
l should marry someone else.

968
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,502
Then, how dare you touch
the property of someone else?

969
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,837
What was so precious
that l took away?

970
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,842
Now, you will even say that you are
going to be the mother of my child.

971
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:08,182
Come on...
Get out...

972
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,341
- Let go of m...
- GET OUT from my house...

973
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,013
l will go nowhere.
This is my house.

974
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,850
As long as you don't call me,
l will sit right here...

975
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,587
and go on a hunger strike.
- l don't care what you do...

976
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,697
but l am not going back on my decision.

977
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:40,377
Mother... l will certainly go
crazy with hunger... MOM!...

978
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,889
Hey, what happened?
Did you eat anything since morning?

979
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:01,228
Not even a drop of water.
- All right.

980
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:02,903
Come inside and have something.

981
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:06,733
What difference will it make if l
went in just once and had something?

982
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,910
Call me in the house for ever.
- ln that case, you are better off here

983
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,247
Call her inside!
What does she take me to be?

984
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,248
lt is not good to take the
curse from a helpless lass.

985
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,248
l have been starving
since last night.

986
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,752
l did not have anything either in
the morning nor in the afternoon.

987
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:22,923
Think about it.

988
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:46,446
- How are you my child?
- Come daddy.

989
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,946
You were the only person missing.
Come!

990
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:51,785
- Daughter!!
- Father!!

991
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:54,113
What is the matter dear?
Why are you sitting here outside?

992
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:56,950
- Are you waiting for my son-in-law?
- That is right. Come, have a seat.

993
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:02,956
Seems like today you are bubbling
with excessive love towards me.

994
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,066
Why?
Why do you say that?

995
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,301
The size of these
bananas clearly shows that.

996
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,962
Oh these!
Nowadays, they are in season.

997
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:15,305
Daddy, you love your son-in-law
more than me, don't you?

998
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:19,310
ls this something to ask?
l love him so much that...

999
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,314
he feels the pangs of hunger here
and l drop unconscious over there!

1000
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:25,486
How sad! Today, you are going
to drop unconscious right here!!

1001
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:28,982
ls my son-in-law at home?
l will make a move then.

1002
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,158
No daddy, you sit down.
Anand, come quickly.

1003
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,486
Actually, l have to attend to
an urgent work. l have to go.

1004
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,322
Hey you charlatan!
l will throw you down from here.

1005
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,929
- My child!
- Shut up, you impostor!

1006
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,827
Hey, what are you doing?
Who is he?

1007
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,160
Why are you strangling him?
Let go of him!!

1008
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,335
How do l let go of him?
He is the same impostor...

1009
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,334
... who used to fake as my father
and bring me bananas and...

1010
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,995
... walk off with
our household belongings.

1011
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,165
Don't you get deceived by his looks.
He is a thief of first order.

1012
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,002
Please forgive me son.

1013
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,179
- Please forgive me! - You are
not worthy of being forgiven.

1014
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:54,344
l am a heart patient.
- You will soon be fine once...

1015
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,507
you get beaten up by the cops.
- Greetings to you sir.

1016
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:01,184
What happened now?
- Sir, l don't even know this man.

1017
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,016
l have never even seen this man!
But he...

1018
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,683
So, l will have to find
his whereabouts too!

1019
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,193
No sir! This man feigned as my
father-in-law and entered my house...

1020
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,697
...and all my belongings...
- That is enough! l got it!!

1021
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,203
My name is lnspector Chaturvedi.

1022
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:20,370
My name is Mr.Natwarlal.

1023
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,375
But till today,
l have not cheated nor duped anyone.

1024
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,374
Tihar, Nasik and Arthur road
all come under my sovereignty.

1025
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,041
But, all these are penitentiaries!
- No, these place holds my palaces.

1026
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,049
This man is a number one fraud and
you are shaking your hands with him!

1027
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:40,057
Quiet... QUlET!!
You are an amnesia patient.

1028
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:43,723
Dr.Dayanand has told me
everything about you.

1029
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:46,066
You don't consider your
wife as your wife then...

1030
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,226
... how will you ever
recognize her father?

1031
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:52,065
You amnesiac!
- The doctor must have told you...

1032
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,233
not about me but about that girl.
You have misunderstood everything!

1033
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,741
What? Am l misunderstanding you?

1034
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,740
Do you take lnspector Chaturvedi
to be stupid?

1035
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,407
- Just a minute l will show you.
- lnspector never mind! Let him go!

1036
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:06,746
- He is my son-in-law after all.
- Son, go home and have the bananas.

1037
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,413
Else, he will have you for sure.
Go home sonny.

1038
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:14,091
Mr.Natwarlal, l will see you!
That l will!

1039
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,197
Make a move son!

1040
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,933
lnspector, what about
my cigarette packet?

1041
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,602
Have you gone insane?
Once taken, police never return.

1042
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,440
He turned out to be
too smart for me.

1043
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:34,938
You are leaving a young girl all
alone in such chilly dark night!

1044
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:37,117
Don't you have even a tiny bit
of sympathy in your heart for me?

1045
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,454
lf you wish for compassion then
go over to Dr.Dayanand's house.

1046
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,453
Shall l reach you there right away?
- No!

1047
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,558
l prefer to turn into an
ice-cream in this freezing night...

1048
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:47,287
- .. but l will go nowhere.
- Then, remain where you are.

1049
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,797
My Anu... Please!

1050
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:55,132
Man, your party was superb but
we would have really enjoyed...

1051
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,795
... if only you had arranged
for some women with the wine.

1052
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,474
Hey man... Look no further.
There is our woman.

1053
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:06,139
- Let's go and woo her.
- Oh! That we will have to.

1054
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:16,490
What are you doing
sitting here all alone?

1055
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:21,495
Nearby, there is a park.
Will you come alongwith us?

1056
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,998
You will pass your time very well.
Just for an hour!

1057
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:31,828
l don't mind at all!
Do you see that house?

1058
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,508
My man stays in there.
Go and have a talk with him.

1059
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:38,175
Seems like that we will have to fix
the rate and give the advance to him.

1060
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:43,347
- All right, we will give it to him.
- A party has come to meet you.

1061
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,678
Don't you try to
make a fool of me.

1062
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,855
He does not seem to
believe my words at all!

1063
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,186
Mister,...
We really wish to meet you!

1064
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:53,360
Yes, we wish to discuss
something very important with you.

1065
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:55,352
Go on!
Get along now!

1066
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:58,363
No one came when the press
was open the whole day.

1067
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:01,194
And now in the dead of the night,
they are knocking at my door!

1068
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,537
Has to be some urgent
order for certain!

1069
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:10,032
Come inside and make
yourself comfortable.

1070
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,703
We don't have the time to sit and chat
- Quickly, tell us about the rate.

1071
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,048
Sir, we always charge nominal rates.

1072
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,218
We do not charge double the rate
like our neighbours Beauty does.

1073
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,055
Did you hear that?
There is a beauty next door too!

1074
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:24,215
We didn't know about it! Even about
you we learntjust a while ago.

1075
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:26,556
Before l was
a celebrity in this area.

1076
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:31,221
But, since the time my neighbour,
Beauty has hired new young girls...

1077
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,400
... my business has
somewhat slackened.

1078
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:36,903
And moreover, all her machines
are of a latest model.

1079
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,573
But my machine has
become a bit old and rusty.

1080
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:41,571
Not at all!
lt didn't look old by its looks!

1081
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,734
lt looked quite fresh!
- Sir,...

1082
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,574
how would a beholder know about it?
Ask the person who uses it.

1083
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:48,916
Whatever man! Quickly,
let's wind up this business.

1084
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,585
First, l will show you the album.

1085
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:53,754
Decide amongst yourselves as
to which type you wish to have.

1086
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,583
We will fix the rate later.
That is right!

1087
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,417
lt is only after you look at the
album that you will get the idea.

1088
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:59,253
Listen friend, there is no
need to look at the album.

1089
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,362
We have seen the girl
with our very own eyes.

1090
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:04,590
Seen the girl!
What do you mean?

1091
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:08,098
Man, the girl who is sitting there,
has sent us to you to fix the rate.

1092
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:12,265
Until now, you were all
talking about that other rate?

1093
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,772
- Then what?
- Damn you! You filthy curs!

1094
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:17,945
You all completely
changed my profession!

1095
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:21,114
- l will show you right now!
- Take to your heels man!...

1096
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:22,612
Hey, where are you running off to?

1097
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:26,776
Damn you, you are still a baby
yourself and you need women!

1098
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:29,789
You need women!
- The girl had sent us to you to talk

1099
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:40,631
lf this girl was again to step into
my house, l will leave this city.

1100
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:56,816
- What is all this?
- Don't be angry, son!

1101
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:58,986
First listen to what l have to say.

1102
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:01,314
l knew that this girl
had lost her memory.

1103
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,987
Therefore jokingly
l became her father...

1104
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,990
... and started visiting
your house.

1105
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,095
And thus started to
pick these picayune things.

1106
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,664
But son, now l have truly...

1107
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,823
... felt an attachment
for her like my own daughter.

1108
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:17,330
l beg you to please
accept my daughter.

1109
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:22,331
Not only me Anand. Daddy loves
you too as his own son-in-law.

1110
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,840
Look at that! He has brought
that car to gift it to you.

1111
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,116
That too, air-conditioned.

1112
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:32,011
You both board that tin piece
ofjunk and get lost from here.

1113
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,678
Son, l have so lovingly...
- l do not wish to hear anything!

1114
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,691
Get out of my way!

1115
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:40,019
Didn't you hear what l just said?
Move aside!

1116
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,196
What is this Anand?
Daddy has so lovingly...

1117
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:48,862
How many times have l told you
not to come over to my place?

1118
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,701
And still you don't seem to
understand! Get lost from here!

1119
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,039
Come on, remove your legs.
And, BE QUlET!!

1120
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:14,724
Why did you pick him up?
- Anand, l promise you...

1121
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,731
that from today on
l will never come here.

1122
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:23,066
Let Sonu stay with me...
Just for today!

1123
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,906
l will leave him
back in the evening.

1124
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:30,073
Tomorrow again, l've to take care
of him. Then, why not today?

1125
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:33,410
Today he has seen me,
that is why he is crying.

1126
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:37,413
From tomorrow on, he will
neither see me nor will he cry.

1127
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:39,745
Listen, don't vex me and
hand over the baby back to me.

1128
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:46,754
l beg you. Let Sonu stay
with me! Just for today!!

1129
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:25,792
Mr.Anand, now did you get it?

1130
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:28,629
The Lord Almighty too want
you to be married to Asha.

1131
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,804
Therefore, you escaped
such a terrible accident.

1132
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:34,305
Next time, nothing will happen to
you even if you crash against a plane.

1133
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:42,479
- M... My baby!
- The baby is with Asha.

1134
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:44,651
She has gone to the temple
to pray for your well-being.

1135
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:50,816
All right, excuse me.
l will attend to other patients.

1136
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,495
Usually you used
to ride your cycle...

1137
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,655
... by hanging your baby
on it like a kangaroo.

1138
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,663
Today some clairvoyant must have
surely boded you about your accident.

1139
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,769
Therefore you did not take him along.

1140
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:15,171
Let Sonu stay with me...
Just for today!

1141
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,519
Shall l send it away?
Shall l?

1142
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,858
See, it has flown back again!

1143
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:28,194
Anand, the dinner is ready.
Come and have it.

1144
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:30,523
- Yes, l am coming.
- What is this? Do come now!

1145
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,858
Come... come...
Come on!

1146
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:36,032
- Hey Dum-Dum, who is he?
- He is your father-in-law.

1147
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,373
- Father-in-law!
- Come, will you?

1148
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:42,542
Let's go.

1149
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:46,880
Why are you so afraid?

1150
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:48,982
Whatever there is, clearly
tell everything to the boss.

1151
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,550
There is nothing to say.
You be quiet!

1152
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:52,378
What is this going on?
Dum-Dum, you speak up.

1153
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,048
Boss, when you were in the hospital
that cursed moneylender of ours...

1154
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,887
... brought a court order
for the auction of our press.

1155
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:03,063
l thought that now we are done in.
But at that moment,...

1156
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:08,066
this gentleman sold off all his
properties paid off all your dues.

1157
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:16,235
Please don't take me wrong, son.
God has bestowed me with affluence...

1158
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:18,912
... but he took away my loved ones.

1159
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:21,911
Last year,
the earthquake of Latur...

1160
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,918
... engulfed my entire family.

1161
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,581
l am now all alone
in this whole wide world.

1162
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,258
lf something were to happen to me...

1163
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,593
... l have not a single soul
to even cry over my dead body.

1164
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:37,926
Therefore, l wander around you.

1165
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:41,601
Son, believe me!
l have nothing more to gain.

1166
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,769
Come inside.
Come inside dad!

1167
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,945
We will have dinner together.

1168
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:59,608
Sonu, sit right here and play.
l have some work to do. Okay!

1169
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:01,955
Anand, take care of Sonu.

1170
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:31,651
Oh no...
A Scorpion!

1171
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:26,895
Sonu, greet the Lord!
Join your hands...

1172
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:32,564
Anand, where had you gone?

1173
01:43:37,778 --> 01:43:39,746
Put it on with your own hands.

1174
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:51,090
Seems like your treatment
has finally met with success.

1175
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:58,928
You were praying for quite long.
What did you pray for?

1176
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:02,101
What did you ask for?

1177
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:05,434
You tell me first and
then l will tell you.

1178
01:44:07,808 --> 01:44:09,776
l prayed that...

1179
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:16,105
Oh Lord, never return
my lost memory.

1180
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:19,452
l am made for Anand.

1181
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:23,946
And till l breathe my last,
l wish to remain his.

1182
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:29,795
- Now you tell me.
- l said to the Lord that...

1183
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:36,129
... you had taken away my Asha
and left me and my Sonu all alone.

1184
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:43,473
Now, l have found another Asha.
l hope you don't take her away too.

1185
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:47,476
Wow, what do you know?

1186
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:49,479
Seems like the Cupid has finally
succeeded in hitting his target.

1187
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:51,311
lt is good that
l found you right here.

1188
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:56,319
We were about to come to you.
Asha and l have decided to marry.

1189
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:00,659
Since when my ears were anxiously
waiting to hear this good news.

1190
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,489
- One should not delay
auspicious moment. - Absolutely.

1191
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:04,664
l will go right away and fetch
everything for the wedding.

1192
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:07,494
We will, without more ado get you
both married in this very temple.

1193
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:10,496
No doctor. The priest said that day
after tomorrow will be most auspicious.

1194
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:12,839
We will have our
marriage cards printed...

1195
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:14,941
... and get married according to
the proper customs and traditions.

1196
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,343
l too am going to the
neighbouring city to inspect a house.

1197
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:19,502
l will be back by evening.
Then in this temple we will...

1198
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:21,614
execute your wedding with
pomp and ceremony.

1199
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:24,843
Listen, only 24 hours are left.

1200
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:26,685
lf you wish to do any rehearsals
before going about it then do it.

1201
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,015
lt shouldn't be that
in the last minute you...

1202
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:32,859
Else, any problem could arise.

1203
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:39,528
Seems like, you have decided
to walk into the jaws of death.

1204
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,709
This way, l cannot see
anything from outside.

1205
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,878
What is this?

1206
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:59,382
l cannot see anything.
Are you an estate agent or an oaf?

1207
01:45:59,586 --> 01:46:01,884
l have driven 40 kms
and come so far...

1208
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,547
... and you say, the owner is out!
You don't even have the keys!

1209
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:07,223
Will l be buy a bungalow worth lacs
by just peeping into it's window?!

1210
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,896
Sorry! What is this?

1211
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:14,897
- Are all the bungalows of this
colony the same? - Yes sir.

1212
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,570
Then, do one thing. Go and take
the permission from that gentleman.

1213
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:19,228
l will look at his bungalow and
thus get a fair idea about this one.

1214
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,739
That man is very cynical.
Does not talk to anyone.

1215
01:46:25,445 --> 01:46:28,243
What is this? 'With Love' is
written behind his blue Maruti van.

1216
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:30,416
You dare to call such
a loving person cynical!

1217
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:32,414
Why don't you say that
you don't wish to ask him?

1218
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:34,749
All right, l will take
the permission myself.

1219
01:46:40,127 --> 01:46:42,095
You wish to see the bungalow,
don't you? Go ahead and take a look.

1220
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,598
So, you overhead our
entire conversation.

1221
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,098
Though inebriated, you
are still quite conscious!

1222
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:25,297
Have you seen that girl from
the photograph anywhere?

1223
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:30,473
N... No!
l have not seen this girl anywhere.

1224
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:33,305
Then, why were you observing
that photograph so carefully?

1225
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:37,305
N... No! l was just saying that...
this is such an artistic photograph.

1226
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:41,817
Wow, what photography!
Anyway, who is this girl?

1227
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:44,650
You quickly finish off with the
inspection of the bungalow and move.

1228
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:56,335
Hello friend!

1229
01:47:56,703 --> 01:47:59,672
Upstairs, the photograph of the girl
which is adorning the bedroom...

1230
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:02,502
- ... do you know as to who she is?
- Her name is Anita.

1231
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,836
The man, Ajay who went upstairs
right now, she is his inamorata.

1232
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:08,177
One day, she suddenly disappeared.
Since the time she vanished,...

1233
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:10,681
he is spending his days
like a mad man. Why?

1234
01:48:10,884 --> 01:48:15,184
Have you seen that girl somewhere?
- NO! l don't much watch girls anyway.

1235
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:18,357
But seeing his dismal features
and a goblet in his hand...

1236
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:21,518
... l immediately understood that a
love story is involved in all this.

1237
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:31,704
Mr.Bechaara's way has
finally cleared up.

1238
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:35,374
But, l should do something good
about this Romeo's life too.

1239
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:43,375
Listen son, age wise
l am older than you.

1240
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:47,713
Therefore, it is quite evident
that l am more experienced in life.

1241
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:52,054
- Shall l tell you something?
- Yes, speak up.

1242
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:54,894
lt is said that, there are
other miseries in this world...

1243
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:56,552
... apart from the anguish of love.

1244
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:59,391
Love is butjust a page
in the book of life.

1245
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:02,564
lf that page was to get torn,
one does not throw away the book.

1246
01:49:03,436 --> 01:49:05,404
You should flip over the pages
further and see what they hold beyond.

1247
01:49:05,605 --> 01:49:07,732
Therefore, l am telling you that
if you did not find that girl...

1248
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:09,842
since the last 3 months then what
will you find her now? Could be that...

1249
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:12,571
Anita is lost since the last 3
months, how did you know about it?

1250
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,741
Oh no! l have had it now!!

1251
01:49:15,882 --> 01:49:17,907
The thing is that,
l have an evil tongue.

1252
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:20,416
l had just made an assumption
and seems to have hit the target.

1253
01:49:20,787 --> 01:49:22,755
You really don't
know anything about Anita?

1254
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:25,083
Will l have to swear
now to prove to you?

1255
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:27,250
You are after me like anything man!

1256
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,761
My God! That is why l always
tell you to talk less Dayanand!!

1257
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:34,934
Today, because of your garrulous
blabbering, poor fellow Anand...

1258
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:37,093
would've surely met with his climax.
You would better scram from here now.

1259
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:46,438
Come on my son,...
Sonu, call me 'Ma'!

1260
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,448
Call me 'Ma'!
Sonu, look over here.

1261
01:49:49,816 --> 01:49:52,284
Just once, call me 'Ma'.
Please!!

1262
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:56,444
Just once, call me 'Mummy'.
l will give you lots of kisses.

1263
01:49:58,658 --> 01:50:01,456
Just once, call me 'Ma'.

1264
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:04,797
Call me 'Ma'.

1265
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:09,958
Hey, go to daddy later. Look
over here. First call me 'Ma'.

1266
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:14,136
What is this Anand?
Sonu is going to be a year old

1267
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:16,299
And he has still not
learnt to say 'Ma'.

1268
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:19,808
The thing is that,
we boys are being very patient.

1269
01:50:20,013 --> 01:50:22,311
We do everything with
much careful thoughts and ease.

1270
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:24,983
And you girls! You are being
very talkative and impatient.

1271
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:28,485
You are always chattering non-stop.
- lt is nothing like that.

1272
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,652
Girls are like a camphor ball.

1273
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:33,485
They are fast thinkers and thus
spread their knowledge all around.

1274
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:36,158
And you boys are being
like a tube-light.

1275
01:50:36,363 --> 01:50:39,491
You are being so dim-witted people.
- You are absolutely right.

1276
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:41,826
We are like a tubelight
and take time to light up.

1277
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:45,493
But, once we start to light up
our power is something to be noticed.

1278
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:58,010
What is it man?
l was blowing my horn.

1279
01:50:58,551 --> 01:51:00,519
What if this is a police van.
Will you drive right over me?

1280
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:02,855
Fine, l will take it in reverse.

1281
01:51:06,893 --> 01:51:08,861
The Romeo of blue van
is following me!

1282
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:12,691
Mr.Bechaara, l have dug your
grave with my very own hands.

1283
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:14,867
Now this climax has already started.

1284
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:17,036
There is no turning back.
l will have to move ahead now.

1285
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,867
Seem like he has seen us.

1286
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:36,377
- Hey man, come here.
- What is it sir?

1287
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:37,886
Shut the gate at once!!
- Why?

1288
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,549
The train hasn't arrived yet.
- But isn't this bill coming your way?

1289
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:42,662
- Take it.
- All right sir.

1290
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:54,073
- Open the gate!
- Bottle! Wow!!

1291
01:51:54,274 --> 01:51:56,572
- Quickly, open the gate!
- Oh no!

1292
01:52:05,618 --> 01:52:07,916
Hey, stop the car!
STOP THE CAR!!

1293
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:20,933
Oh no, l am dead for sure!

1294
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:36,949
- You look over there.
- Okay.

1295
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:47,289
''Move hither your bed...
l am shivering.''

1296
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:49,793
- Daddy, what are you singing?
- l was singing a lullaby.

1297
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:51,964
Oh Great!!

1298
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:55,968
Asha, this is not the time
to have tea and coffee.

1299
01:52:56,102 --> 01:52:58,297
Have a cold glass of almond milk
in the night. Let's move on quick.

1300
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,633
We all have to go to the temple
and complete the marriage ceremony.

1301
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:03,641
- But, the wedding is tomorrow!
- Don't ask me anything.

1302
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:04,969
That priest turned out
to be a dim-witted fool.

1303
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:07,807
He started to say that he goofed up
while finding an auspicious moment.

1304
01:53:08,014 --> 01:53:09,982
Tomorrow is a very ill-fated day.
Today is the most auspicious day.

1305
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:13,984
You should be married within an hour.
That is why, l have come prepared.

1306
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,145
- Where is Anand? - He has
gone to Azad Police station...

1307
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:18,824
... to give the wedding invitation
to lnspector Chaturvedi.

1308
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:22,984
Listen Mr.Natwarlal. l'm taking Asha
straight to the Shiv Temple...

1309
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:25,154
on the hill top. What you do...
- l got it!

1310
01:53:25,365 --> 01:53:27,333
l head straight for the
Azad Police station,...

1311
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:29,662
... pick up the groom and
reach the Shiv temple, right?

1312
01:53:31,037 --> 01:53:33,005
Greetings to you, lnspector.

1313
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:39,011
- What is it?
- Sir, take this.

1314
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:41,677
- Now, what is this?
- This is my wedding card.

1315
01:53:43,383 --> 01:53:45,351
- Your wedding?
- Yes sir!

1316
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:47,851
lt is tomorrow morning at exactly
7:30 in the temple on the hill top.

1317
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:50,022
Then, what will become
of your first wife?

1318
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:54,354
Sir, she has passed away.
- Then, who is this girl?

1319
01:53:54,727 --> 01:53:57,025
Sir, she is the same girl whose
photograph l had given to you.

1320
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:59,698
You are getting married
again to your wife!

1321
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:03,701
No sir, she is a maiden.
- Just a minute. Wait!...

1322
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:08,204
The first wife is already dead and
he is getting married to her again.

1323
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:11,536
The second is a maiden girl.
Hey, how can this ever be possible?

1324
01:54:11,744 --> 01:54:14,042
The first wife is dead and
he is getting married to her...

1325
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,375
... the second is a spinster...
l will go CRAZY!

1326
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:18,708
No sir! l will
explain everything to you.

1327
01:54:18,918 --> 01:54:21,045
l don't wish to understand anything.
Brother, excuse me!

1328
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,213
You do anything you wish to do.
All right, tell me one thing.

1329
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,392
Have you distributed this
card all over the city?

1330
01:54:26,526 --> 01:54:28,050
No sir, you are the first
person l have started with.

1331
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:30,059
l get it! That means, others are
left to be made a fool by you.

1332
01:54:30,196 --> 01:54:33,222
Sir, you are misunderstanding me.
- What is it?

1333
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:36,563
Now, what problem do you have?
l was driving my car and...

1334
01:54:36,769 --> 01:54:39,897
this tape recorder fell
from the car that was ahead of me.

1335
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,408
l have to find the
owner of that car somehow...

1336
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:44,237
... and return his
tape-recorder to him.

1337
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:46,742
The license number
of the car is, MP6 1 16.

1338
01:54:46,946 --> 01:54:49,414
Hey man, does this look
like a R.T.O office to you?

1339
01:54:49,616 --> 01:54:55,077
This is a police station, get it!
- Was it a white Contessa?

1340
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:58,423
Hey, this is the license
number of Dr.Dayanand's car!

1341
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,082
Whosoever's car that is!
What have l got to do with it?

1342
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:02,921
l am on my way to his place.
Why don't you too come along?

1343
01:55:03,129 --> 01:55:04,756
And sir...

1344
01:55:04,964 --> 01:55:06,261
The auspicious time has been
fixed for 7:30 in the morning.

1345
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,094
- Don't you forget about it, please!
- l won't... l WON'T!!

1346
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:10,098
And, you too don't forget that
lemon thing l had prescribed to you.

1347
01:55:10,236 --> 01:55:11,760
How can l ever forget it sir?
l apply it everyday.

1348
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:13,939
And still no change!

1349
01:55:14,974 --> 01:55:17,772
Dr.Dayanand is waiting for you
in the temple at the hill top.

1350
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:20,270
Temple at the hill top?
For what??

1351
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,105
Don't know. He just said
that it is very urgent.

1352
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:26,118
- lt is very urgent!
- Doesn't matter!

1353
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:28,287
We will go and
meet him there itself.

1354
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:48,641
l am DEAD!!!
- What happened?

1355
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:50,800
Nothing! Come with me.

1356
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:54,146
What is it? Doctor, atleast
tell me what the matter is?

1357
01:55:56,015 --> 01:55:57,141
- Go inside.
- Why?

1358
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:59,308
l will tell you. lt is
something very important. Get in!

1359
01:56:01,354 --> 01:56:03,322
''You're... Simply lrresistible.''

1360
01:56:04,524 --> 01:56:06,651
Why have you brought me in here?
There is nothing in here!

1361
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:08,986
Don't talk like an atheist
You will be sinned for it.

1362
01:56:09,195 --> 01:56:12,164
This is the most divine, sacred
and invincible place of this temple.

1363
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:14,159
Close your eyes and immerse
yourself in the benediction.

1364
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,666
And till l don't come back, don't
open your eyes and come out, get it!

1365
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:19,167
Now, shut your eyes!
Join you hands!!

1366
01:56:23,876 --> 01:56:25,844
Where is that damn doctor gone?

1367
01:56:26,212 --> 01:56:28,339
He called us all here
and himself disappeared!

1368
01:56:28,881 --> 01:56:32,180
That nincompoop! That fool has no
sense of time at all!

1369
01:56:32,552 --> 01:56:34,520
lf l could lay my hands on him,...

1370
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:36,849
... l will give him such a
powerful kick on his back that...

1371
01:56:37,223 --> 01:56:39,191
l have not told you sonny!
l was talking about the doctor!!

1372
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:41,293
He will remember it for
the rest of his life.

1373
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:48,530
Did you find the doctor?
- No, l searched for him everywhere.

1374
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:50,693
He is nowhere. l will go and
look for him downhill.

1375
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:54,202
Mr.Ajay, the doctor's
car is parked below.

1376
01:56:54,407 --> 01:56:55,874
That means, he has to
be somewhere around here.

1377
01:56:56,075 --> 01:56:58,873
Till the doctor does not come back,
we will stay put and wait for him.

1378
01:56:59,912 --> 01:57:03,871
Oh no! The fool will bring his own
destruction by his own hands!

1379
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:06,051
He will not marry but mar his life.

1380
01:57:08,588 --> 01:57:10,556
Enough of praying now.
You may come out now.

1381
01:57:13,259 --> 01:57:15,056
- This temple has another tradition.
- What is that?

1382
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:17,560
As soon as you have finished your
prayers, you should get, set and GO!

1383
01:57:17,764 --> 01:57:18,890
- Till where? - You should
run till your house.

1384
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:20,224
There is no need to
ask any more question.

1385
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:22,334
One... Two... Three...
R U N...

1386
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:26,736
Usually, the doctor
is very punctual but...

1387
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:32,745
Hey, that is the
doctor's car driving away!

1388
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:34,906
After calling me here,
where is he running off to?

1389
01:57:35,114 --> 01:57:38,413
He must have certainly
seen me coming here.

1390
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:40,916
- That is why he ran away.
- Ran away!

1391
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,746
What was the need for him
to run away on seeing you?

1392
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:48,089
The fact is, the doctor had come
to my house today in the morning.

1393
01:57:58,304 --> 01:58:00,431
The doctor most certainly
knows something about that girl.

1394
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:02,941
And that he wishes to conceal
that information from me.

1395
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,777
But...

1396
01:58:11,651 --> 01:58:14,779
Mr.Ajay, do you have any
photograph of that girl?

1397
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:16,284
Yes.

1398
01:58:37,844 --> 01:58:41,473
Her name is Anita. We loved
each other more than our lives.

1399
01:59:15,715 --> 01:59:19,014
YOU!
What happened now?

1400
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:28,691
- Tomorrow is not my wedding.
- Then!

1401
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:32,519
Could you please kindly hand
over my wedding card back to me?

1402
01:59:36,068 --> 01:59:38,036
You are the first man
in the world...

1403
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:41,373
... who has come back to take back
his wedding card after giving it.

1404
01:59:44,076 --> 01:59:46,044
l am getting it back.

1405
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,377
Why are you hitting me?

1406
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:56,215
Who asked you to buy a saree worth
Rs.2000 to attend that fool's wedding?

1407
02:00:00,426 --> 02:00:02,394
Here, take this card of yours.

1408
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:10,391
Here is the lemon.
Everyday... Rub it!

1409
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:22,907
Anand, what a fool you are!

1410
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,414
l had called you
alone in the temple.

1411
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:28,247
- Why did you bring him along?
- Why did you run away on seeing him?

1412
02:00:28,554 --> 02:00:30,522
Well l... What else would l have
done if not take to my heels?

1413
02:00:30,623 --> 02:00:33,091
l had taken some loan from him
which l was not able to pay back.

1414
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,423
What did he ask for?

1415
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:37,425
He was asking for your
residential address.

1416
02:00:37,563 --> 02:00:40,088
- l gave it to him.
- All right, l will deal with him.

1417
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:42,934
- Was he asking anything else?
- No.

1418
02:00:43,302 --> 02:00:45,270
Asha is not in.
She is sitting over there.

1419
02:00:47,306 --> 02:00:49,274
Tomorrow morning,
reach the temple on time.

1420
02:00:49,475 --> 02:00:51,443
We will celebrate the marriage
with much fanfare and festivity. Okay!

1421
02:00:52,311 --> 02:00:53,437
Okay.

1422
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:13,121
- Asha come, let's go home.
- When did you come?!

1423
02:01:13,499 --> 02:01:15,797
Just a while ago.
Let's go.

1424
02:01:16,502 --> 02:01:19,471
Anand, sit for sometime.

1425
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:22,140
l want to discuss something
very important with you.

1426
02:01:22,341 --> 02:01:24,468
We will discuss back at home.
Sonu must be all alone.

1427
02:01:24,677 --> 02:01:28,135
No... Sonu is sleeping.
l have daddy sitting beside him.

1428
02:01:34,186 --> 02:01:37,155
Anand, we will be
married tomorrow, won't we?

1429
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:44,656
- Why are you asking this?
- Don't know why?

1430
02:01:45,531 --> 02:01:47,499
Since morning,
my right eye has been twitching.

1431
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:52,159
Dad says that a girl's right eye to
twitch is portentously foreboding.

1432
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:56,664
And, after that, the doctor
came and completely confused me.

1433
02:01:58,544 --> 02:02:00,512
Anand, l am very scared.

1434
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,178
That is the reason why l have asked
for a boon from the Goddess Durga.

1435
02:02:03,716 --> 02:02:06,184
After our marriage, we will
go directly to Vaishnav Devi...

1436
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:08,287
... to offer our prayers
to the Goddess.

1437
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:16,187
What happened Anand?
Why do you look so out of spirits?

1438
02:02:16,562 --> 02:02:18,530
lt is nothing.

1439
02:02:19,231 --> 02:02:24,533
Anand, tomorrow we will
surely be married, won't we?

1440
02:02:26,072 --> 02:02:28,870
Yes Asha. Tomorrow morning,
a wedding will certainly take place.

1441
02:02:37,583 --> 02:02:39,881
Excuse me, sisters. This is
a wedding and not a funeral.

1442
02:02:40,252 --> 02:02:43,221
Seeing your mournful faces,
the guests will all go back.

1443
02:02:47,593 --> 02:02:50,562
Doctor, is everything ready?
- Yes. where is the bride?

1444
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,554
Look thither!

1445
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:51,029
Did you see, Anita!
Love is so powerful!!

1446
02:07:51,897 --> 02:07:53,865
We had separated at the
time of our wedding itself.

1447
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:57,035
And today, our love has...

1448
02:07:57,136 --> 02:07:59,195
... again got us back together
at the time of the wedding.

1449
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,888
Tie the marriage cord
around her neck.

1450
02:08:24,263 --> 02:08:27,061
Brother please...
N O...

1451
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:36,074
Brother!...
STOP THEM!!

1452
02:08:36,442 --> 02:08:38,410
Don't do anything to him!
N O...

1453
02:09:11,143 --> 02:09:13,611
Will you again dare
to look at my sister?

1454
02:09:14,646 --> 02:09:17,945
Say that you won't!
SAY that you WON'T!!

1455
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:44,468
Anita WAlT!

1456
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:48,976
Anita, listen to me!

1457
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:55,980
Anita WAlT!!
Don't be crazy! W A l T...

1458
02:09:57,189 --> 02:10:02,650
You can kill us and finish
us off but not our LOVE!

1459
02:10:17,042 --> 02:10:21,342
Seeing your brother beating me up,
the priest had notified the police.

1460
02:10:22,214 --> 02:10:24,512
The police arrested your
brother and took him away.

1461
02:10:25,217 --> 02:10:27,185
Because of an injury on my head,...

1462
02:10:27,319 --> 02:10:29,287
... l remained unconscious
in the hospital for 15 days.

1463
02:10:30,556 --> 02:10:32,683
You had jumped into
the water to commit suicide...

1464
02:10:33,725 --> 02:10:35,693
... l learnt about it only
after gaining consciousness.

1465
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:39,697
But, your dead body was never found.

1466
02:10:40,065 --> 02:10:43,034
Therefore, l always believed in the
depth of my heart that you were alive.

1467
02:10:46,738 --> 02:10:48,706
Today, my belief turned
out to be true.

1468
02:11:12,598 --> 02:11:18,230
Now, l have found another Asha.
l hope you don't take her away too.

1469
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:42,092
What happened, Anita?
Why are you crying?

1470
02:11:43,128 --> 02:11:45,096
What l was afraid of
has finally happened.

1471
02:11:45,297 --> 02:11:46,764
l believe that
after sacrificing,...

1472
02:11:46,899 --> 02:11:48,093
... you will be called
a great sacrificer; a hero.

1473
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:50,768
But, have you ever thought what
this poor female will go through?

1474
02:11:50,969 --> 02:11:52,766
Time is the greatest healer.
Everything will turn out to be fine.

1475
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:55,439
The hell it will! Now, l myself
will have to straighten things out.

1476
02:11:56,308 --> 02:11:59,766
Be quiet! Be quiet!!
- Tell me Anita!

1477
02:11:59,978 --> 02:12:02,105
She is not Anita but
now she has become Asha.

1478
02:12:02,814 --> 02:12:04,441
That is right!
And you do one thing.

1479
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,949
Forget that old love story
and answer a question.

1480
02:12:07,152 --> 02:12:09,279
What need have l to answer
any of your question?

1481
02:12:09,488 --> 02:12:11,456
Well, you will have
to answer me because...

1482
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,558
.. not me but this critical situation
has put forward this question.

1483
02:12:13,825 --> 02:12:16,953
- ls you mother still alive?
- No. She died some years back.

1484
02:12:17,162 --> 02:12:20,290
l mean to say,
did you cry on her death?

1485
02:12:20,499 --> 02:12:22,296
What preposterous question is this?

1486
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:24,969
Superficially, my questions
sound very preposterous...

1487
02:12:25,103 --> 02:12:26,798
... but within, they
have a very deep meaning.

1488
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:29,806
Now, answer me. When your mother
died, had you cried or not?

1489
02:12:30,175 --> 02:12:32,143
Yes, l had cried.

1490
02:12:32,277 --> 02:12:34,802
Now, remember the death of your
mother and again shed your tears.

1491
02:12:35,847 --> 02:12:37,144
lt has been ages since
the death of my mother.

1492
02:12:37,349 --> 02:12:42,480
How can l remember her now and cry?
- What you said is absolutely right!

1493
02:12:42,854 --> 02:12:44,822
The virtue to Forget that 'Man' has
been bestowed from the heavens...

1494
02:12:44,957 --> 02:12:46,925
... is the biggest
gift from the Lord Almighty.

1495
02:12:47,192 --> 02:12:49,820
When the mirror of memories gets
dusty by the sands of time...

1496
02:12:49,962 --> 02:12:51,930
... the images seen in
them becomes obscured.

1497
02:12:55,367 --> 02:12:58,495
Look at this girl. She had
estranged from you 3 months ago.

1498
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:00,167
But today, on meeting you...

1499
02:13:00,305 --> 02:13:03,172
... she has neitherjumped with
joy nor has she run into your arms.

1500
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:05,172
But, she has become doleful
and is shedding her tears.

1501
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:07,278
Do you know why?

1502
02:13:07,379 --> 02:13:09,847
Because, she is more
depressed about the fact that...

1503
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:12,849
... after kindling a ray of hope
in the life of this man...

1504
02:13:13,218 --> 02:13:15,186
... she will finally have to leave
him back into the dismal darkness.

1505
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:20,858
Remembering your mother
who died years back,...

1506
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:22,858
... you cannot shed
your tears today.

1507
02:13:22,995 --> 02:13:25,020
Because your wound is not fresh now.

1508
02:13:25,897 --> 02:13:28,365
But, this poor lady's dreams
are crumbling right at this moment.

1509
02:13:29,568 --> 02:13:32,196
The grief of separating from this
man is fresh in her memory now.

1510
02:13:32,904 --> 02:13:35,202
What you should do
to eradicate her anguish...

1511
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,308
... l leave this decision to you.

1512
02:13:40,645 --> 02:13:44,206
Doctor now l will ask you
a question. Answer me.

1513
02:13:44,416 --> 02:13:46,043
My answer is that when
my mother had died,...

1514
02:13:46,151 --> 02:13:47,709
... l had neither cried
then nor will l cry today.

1515
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:49,878
Doctor, that is not my question.
- Hey man, when this boy...

1516
02:13:49,988 --> 02:13:51,956
came into the mood of moving out from
here listening to me then...

1517
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:53,216
... and when the climax is
meeting its end then...

1518
02:13:53,358 --> 02:13:55,883
... why are you trying to ruin
whatever l have done so far? Let's go

1519
02:13:56,928 --> 02:13:59,226
No doctor.
First you tell me.

1520
02:13:59,931 --> 02:14:02,559
You bring back a dying patient
to life from the portal of death.

1521
02:14:03,101 --> 02:14:06,070
And when that patient
thanks you in gratitude...

1522
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:09,240
... what do you tell him then?
- l... l say that...

1523
02:14:09,441 --> 02:14:11,739
Answer me!
What do you tell him?

1524
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:14,078
Just that, my friend,
l have done nothing!

1525
02:14:14,179 --> 02:14:16,409
l have just fulfilled
my duty as a doctor; that is all.

1526
02:14:16,948 --> 02:14:21,578
You are absolutely right. This girl
was lying unconscious near the beach.

1527
02:14:21,953 --> 02:14:25,582
l found her and as a humanitarian
act, brought her to the hospital.

1528
02:14:25,957 --> 02:14:27,925
That was my duty.

1529
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:32,919
As a doctor, you saved her life.
That was your duty.

1530
02:14:33,298 --> 02:14:35,266
Now, both our duties are over.

1531
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:38,936
- No Anand... - Didn't l say
that both our duties are over now?

1532
02:14:43,308 --> 02:14:45,606
lt is said that...
''Love is Great.''

1533
02:14:46,311 --> 02:14:48,279
Love is truly invincible.

1534
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:52,279
That same power saved her from the
jaws of death and gave her a new life.

1535
02:14:53,318 --> 02:14:56,617
Doctor, their meeting once again
is the will of the Almighty.

1536
02:14:57,155 --> 02:14:59,123
We should approve of it.

1537
02:14:59,658 --> 02:15:01,785
And, we should let them
be together in wedlock...

1538
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:04,629
... and gladly bid them farewell.

1539
02:15:10,836 --> 02:15:13,464
Come and sit.
Come inside all of you.

1540
02:15:23,348 --> 02:15:25,316
You get the bride
to the wedding hall.

1541
02:16:18,737 --> 02:16:21,035
Now, tie the marriage
cord around her neck.

1542
02:16:25,744 --> 02:16:27,712
'MA'.

1543
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:31,048
'M A'.

1544
02:16:36,588 --> 02:16:38,886
Call me 'Ma'.
Come on quickly, call me 'Ma'.

1545
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:13,420
Could be, your duty
must have got over.

1546
02:17:14,793 --> 02:17:19,253
But, my duty has not got over yet.

1547
02:17:32,644 --> 02:17:37,604
Mr.Anand, you had said
that Love is lnvincible.

1548
02:17:38,817 --> 02:17:42,116
But, more invincible than
that is 'Mother's Love'.

1549
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:47,117
There is nothing
as great as a Mother.

1550
02:17:48,326 --> 02:17:50,123
There is no bond of relation
that is as much stronger.

1551
02:17:50,262 --> 02:17:52,230
There is no emotion that
is as much sentimental.

1552
02:18:04,175 --> 02:18:06,143
Well, did you see!
Hadn't l told you that,...

1553
02:18:06,278 --> 02:18:08,974
... my treatment is always
superbly, superfluously successful.

1554
02:18:09,347 --> 02:18:13,147
You marry today, tomorrow or enjoy
your life as it is. No Problem!

1555
02:18:29,701 --> 02:18:33,501
- Sir, tomorrow is my wedding!
- No...
