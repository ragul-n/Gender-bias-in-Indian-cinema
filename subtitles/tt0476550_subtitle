00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:09,958
People call me the creator and the almighty God. 

4
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,541
I was happy when I created a human being. 

5
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:22,125
I created all those things in the world for a human being to be happy. 

6
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,833
But humans are not happy in.. 

7
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:29,083
..this beautiful world created by me. 

8
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,083
He feels that he has something less.. 

9
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,833
..than some other human being. 

10
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,666
Before the time and beyond the fate neither anybody.. 

11
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,875
..has got anything nor will he get it. 

12
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,166
Many people are angry with me without understanding this logic. 

13
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,583
Here is a person who.. 

14
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,916
..is the most upset with me. 

15
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,041
Welcome to the first episode of the show 'Mano Ya Na Mano'.. 

16
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,833
..with your host, Arun Prajapati. 

17
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,833
In this programme, we'll show you some.. 

18
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,000
..mind-boggling things, which will surely amaze you. 

19
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,875
So today, in our first episode, we have with us.. 

20
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,916
..Mr. Loha Singh! 

21
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,666
Yes, this is Mr. Loha Singh. The one who pulled.. 

22
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,125
..a motorcycle with his teeth when he was ten years old. 

23
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:59,375
A bus when he was fifteen and a train when twenty. 

24
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,583
And today, he'll prevent a helicopter from flying.. 

25
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,291
..by just using his teeth. 

26
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,750
The Guinness record for this feat is 40 seconds. 

27
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,375
And he'll hold it for 20 seconds more.. 

28
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,083
..which makes it one whole minute! 

29
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,833
And your time starts now! 

30
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,833
Come on, Loha Singh! 

31
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,625
I know you can do it. Come on, Loha Singh! 

32
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:31,291
Glory to Loha Singh! Stop him if you can! 

33
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on! You can do it! 

34
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,166
Hey! What happened? 

35
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,666
I broke my teeth. - You've just broken two, there are thirty left. 

36
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,875
Try once more. - No! It's paining badly. 

37
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,541
It's a question of my prestige! The whole world is laughing at me. 

38
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,166
This is my first episode, pal. Try again once! - No! I can't do it. 

39
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,125
You pulled this and that.. Shall I pull a hard one on your face! 

40
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,541
Don't touch the phone! All the sponsors and media persons.. 

41
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,083
..are calling up to abuse us. 

42
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,791
Just lift the receiver and keep it back. 

43
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,666
Sir, where do you think from? - From where that AP doesn't think. 

44
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,708
Where's he? I won't spare him. AP! 

45
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,958
Hello, sir. - Please come! Welcome! 

46
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,708
Please come, Mr. Arun Prajapati. AP, the great! 

47
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,291
Please sit on my chair. 

48
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,041
Sir. I'm sorry, sir. But why do you say so? 

49
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,333
I'm saying the right thing. 

50
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,791
Because I'll be kicked off that chair because of you. 

51
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,291
Isn't it, secretary? - Sir, I'm not able to understand anything. 

52
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,625
Sir, the one who brushes his teeth with margosa twigs.. 

53
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,375
..everyday, Loha Singh, if he breaks his teeth in my show.. 

54
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
..then what's my fault in this? 

55
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,583
It's not your fault. It's my fault that I gave you the show. 

56
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,000
Believe it or not, if you continue working like this.. 

57
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,375
..then I'll have to shut down my channel. 

58
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,250
The end! Isn't it, secretary? - No, sir! 

59
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,041
No, sir! I won't ever let this happen. 

60
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,208
For the next show, I have a guy called Puchi Kapoor. 

61
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,750
Puchi Kapoor can smooch his girlfriend for 48 hours.. 

62
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:06,791
..non-stop in the marketplace. Sir.. - Enough! Enough! 

63
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,166
Out.. Get out! 

64
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,708
Get out! 

65
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,625
AP got scolding again. 

66
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,375
Don't know, when this poor guy was born? - Poor guy. 

67
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,833
Here is the host of 'Mano ya Na mano.' 

68
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,875
He is not a host, but a ghost. 

69
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,083
What? What are you grinning for? 

70
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,541
I'll knock out all your 40 teeth with one punch. 

71
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,583
You'll break his teeth?! But he has only 32 of them. 

72
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,458
The other eight are yours.. 

73
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,625
..because I knew that you'd interfere. 

74
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,791
But pal, it won't be so much fun breaking our teeth.. 

75
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,666
..as it was breaking Loha Singh's teeth. 

76
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,500
Hi. 

77
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,666
Listen. Forget all this.. let's go to the corner.. 

78
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,083
I have to talk to somebody. - To whom? 

79
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,166
The one who turned my show into a flop. 

80
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,958
Laugh! Laugh! When the whole world is laughing.. 

81
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,708
..then why isn't the creator doing so? 

82
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:21,958
Loha Singh, the one who pulled a bus, a train.. 

83
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:26,208
..a plane.. his teeth never pained then. 

84
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,708
But he had to break his teeth only in my show. 

85
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,333
Early in the morning, my mother checked,. 

86
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,583
..the predictions in the newspaper and told me.. 

87
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:41,916
..that today will be a great day. But you must've read it too. 

88
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:46,541
And how could you tolerate me having a good day. 

89
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,750
Am I the only one in this world whom you trouble.. 

90
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,375
..or is there someone else too? 

91
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,333
What has happened to him? - He suddenly complained of chest pain.. 

92
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,625
..and then fell unconscious. 

93
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,541
When? - An hour ago. 

94
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,708
An hour.. Don't worry, everything will be fine. 

95
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,291
Take him to the ICU, hurry! 

96
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,250
Don't worry, ok? Everything will be fine. 

97
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,541
Look, madam, you are very lucky. 

98
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,875
Heart specialist Dr. Khurana is present here. Don't worry. 

99
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,291
No use. He's dead. 

100
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,708
Doctor, how's my father? - A major heart attack. 

101
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,666
Don't worry. Deposit Rs. 1 lakh immediately. 

102
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,250
What have you brought for lunch today? 

103
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,666
Ask your wife to cook lunch for you at times. 

104
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,375
He's been cooking up stories for his wife all these years. 

105
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,333
65000! 

106
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,583
Thank you. 

107
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,958
You're the first doctor to give medicines to the dead. 

108
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,541
Not just medicines, we also give him.. 

109
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,958
..injections worth Rs.60000. - Is it? Go and return it. 

110
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,125
It's been long now. We've even had our meal. What to do now? 

111
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,833
Nothing. Have some dessert and then give her the news. 

112
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
Doctor, how's my father? 

113
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,541
We tried our best but we couldn't save him. 

114
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,625
Have courage. 

115
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,708
Go and clear the bills while I prepare the death certificate. 

116
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,083
Ok? Come, doctor. 

117
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,583
You've already paid Rs.1 lakh. Just pay Rs. 40000 more. 

118
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,083
All the details are in the bill. You can check it. 

119
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,125
Here's your father's death certificate. 

120
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,958
Very good! Very good! 

121
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,708
Here's his death certificate. 

122
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,250
This man had died at 10 am in Sanjivani hospital. 

123
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,583
Huh?! - What?! 

124
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,833
I had just brought his corpse to you. - Corpse?! 

125
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,583
Yes. I'm Alia Kapoor from Channel one. 

126
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,125
This was a sting operation of ours. 

127
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,708
What? Sting? - There! - Hey, move the camera. 

128
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,916
That is my team. 

129
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,583
Madam, please don't do this to us. - Hey back off! 

130
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:35,500
back off! - Hey, close the camera! - Don't go. Somebody, stop them! 

131
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:40,208
Oh God, camera! - Look, how can you do like this. This is cheating. 

132
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,333
Look... - Hey, shut down the camera. 

133
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Our reporter Alia Kapoor.. - Fantastic! 

134
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,916
Fantastic! - Corruption takes place in hospitals too. 

135
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
Keep the receiver back on the phone. 

136
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,625
Yes, sir. - Let the calls come in. Let the sponsors praise us. 

137
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,916
But boss, I'm not able to understand anything. 

138
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,208
I knew it the very day I appointed Alia.. 

139
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,458
..that she'll make the TRP of my channel shoot up. 

140
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,166
Welcome Alia! - Here she comes. 

141
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,333
Welcome, Alia the great. - Sting operation. - Alia.. 

142
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,416
Stop! Beware! 

143
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,208
You rabbit! And you, the tortoise too! 

144
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,083
I'll bash you with this bouquet. 

145
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,458
Only AP will congratulate Alia. 

146
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:44,041
Only AP! Who? - AP! AP! A.. 

147
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,250
Congratulations, Alia. 

148
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,541
Thanks, AP. 

149
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,583
You love flowers, don't you? 

150
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,791
And I like you too. - Me too. 

151
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,958
I love you. - I love you too. 

152
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,125
Congratulations, Alia. Give her a big hand. 

153
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,125
You've done a wonderful job. - Thank you, sir. 

154
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,541
I can't believe that.. 

155
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,916
..you've done such a fantastic job. - Really! Really! - What say? 

156
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,333
What say? - Thanks. 

157
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,666
Sir, all the credit goes to you. - Brilliant job, Alia. 

158
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,041
I can't believe it. 

159
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,166
I hope no one is watching. - The next job should be even more wonderful. 

160
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,958
Ok! Everybody back to work. - 100%, sir. 

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Back to work everybody. - Bye. 

162
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,958
Yes. - Yes. 

163
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,375
Good job, madam. - Thank you, Murari. 

164
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,250
Just thank you won't do. Tell the boss to get me a motorcycle. 

165
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,166
I always travel too far. 

166
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,375
I'll surely try. By the way, where's AP? 

167
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,291
Hi! These flowers are very good. 

168
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,875
But if you have given it to me in person, it'd have been better. 

169
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,583
How do you know that I had brought them. 

170
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,875
Because you're the only one who knows.. 

171
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,625
..how much I love blue orchids. 

172
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,166
I had brought it for you but then you never have time for me. 

173
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,958
That's your problem. You're the best in this office. 

174
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,958
Yet you let others overtake you.. 

175
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,583
..and end up being at the last. 

176
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,375
You're upset about your show, isn't it? 

177
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,208
But I'm even happier that your show was a hit. 

178
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,208
Just a second. 

179
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,208
Good Lord! He'll never agree. Yes.. - Who is it? 

180
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,875
An old friend of mine from Delhi. 

181
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,083
The poor guy might be willing to congratulate you. 

182
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,625
This guy wants to marry me. - What?! 

183
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes. The last time when I went to Delhi. 

184
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,916
He said, 'I love you'. 

185
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,791
What did you say? 

186
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,666
I refused of course. 

187
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,958
I hate such Romeos who don't know their limits. 

188
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,916
If you're a friend, just be one. 

189
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,416
Why do you have to become my lover? 

190
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,125
That's why I like you. 

191
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,250
You're not like that. You're well aware of your limits. 

192
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,916
You can't even look at a girl in the wrong manner. 

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,125
That's for sure. 

194
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:13,083
If I can have her for a day, then every eye will be on me. 

195
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,000
I hope I hit the jackpot today, O' Lord! 

196
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,000
Hey Rangila! Give me a lottery ticket. - Yes. Take it. 

197
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,000
I got it! I got it! 

198
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,625
But the lottery is for Rs.2 crores. 

199
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,541
Why are you giving me Rs.500? 

200
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,625
I'll give the rest after the draw. Keep this for now. 

201
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,916
If the draw isn't over yet, then why are you giving me this? 

202
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,291
Someone might hear it. 

203
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,666
Because I've fallen in love with you. 

204
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,708
Scoundrel! Rascal! Fool! I'm married and have two kids. 

205
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,000
It doesn't make any difference to me. 

206
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,083
Just agree and you'll get Rs.500 everyday. 

207
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,625
My husband is a million times better than you. 

208
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,875
I love him a lot and you want to buy me for Rs.500?! 

209
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,041
Give me your hand with love. 

210
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,666
These hands are meant to wash vessels not beat me up. 

211
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,416
Accept it! A third hand?! - It's mine. Rascal! Punk! - No, sir. No! 

212
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,666
How many times do I have to tell you.. 

213
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,291
..to curb this cheap habit of yours? - I'll never do it again. 

214
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,708
It seems you'll never improve yourself. - I'll never do it again. 

215
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,875
I'm sorry. - Apologise to her. - I'm sorry. I Please forgive me. 

216
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,750
If you repeat it I'll throw this tin box of yours outside the area. 

217
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,083
No, sir. I'll never do it again. I promise. 

218
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,166
Please let go off my hair. You're spoiling my hairstyle. 

219
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,875
This was the only shop you could choose? 

220
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,458
C'mon! - Go! - You! 

221
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,166
Where's the Rs.500 bill! 

222
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,333
It was a very good family. Please remember, Lord. 

223
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,125
If the alliance is fixed this time.. 

224
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,083
..then I'll offer you One kg and 250 gm of sweetmeat. 

225
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,500
Even if you offer 250 quintals of sweetmeat instead of.. 

226
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,000
..one kg and 250 gm. 

227
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,083
Your daughter will still remain unmarried. 

228
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,791
LP! How many times have I told you not to talk like that?! 

229
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,583
If my talking right would've made a difference.. 

230
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,666
..then your daughter would be having fun at her in-laws' place. 

231
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,791
And your son would be well settled. 

232
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,250
Here comes the problem! 

233
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,916
You've returned, dear. - Here's the smart-alecky guy of the house. 

234
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,125
People finish their stories in hundreds of episodes. 

235
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,041
He finished his in just one. It's a world record. 

236
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,416
He has returned very tired from work. 

237
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,833
Let him rest in peace for some time. 

238
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,166
If I rest in peace, then how'll he do the same? 

239
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,125
He has studied so much. 

240
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,083
But has never been able to win any race in life. 

241
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,791
The day I run a race, I'll win the Derby directly. 

242
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,875
I've told him a hundred times to stop running after these channels. 

243
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,916
Join the municipality like me. So what if I've retired? 

244
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,083
I can still get you a job there. 

245
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,666
I've told you a hundred times to forget the municipality. 

246
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,041
I want to do something different. 

247
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,208
In the process of doing something different.. 

248
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,375
..you've ended up doing nothing. 

249
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,166
Stop it. Enough. 

250
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,166
Here, dear. - It's better that I read the newspaper.. 

251
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,291
..at least it doesn't answer back. 

252
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,666
In Gujrat, a storm.. 

253
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,958
Son, Misha's neighbours had come to see your sister today. 

254
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,375
I feel that they liked her a lot. 

255
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,750
How can those who didn't like the snacks made.. 

256
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,666
..your daughter, like her? 

257
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,250
You couldn't find a better alliance than him? 

258
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,708
What could I do? My parents fixed it. 

259
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,708
I can give it to you in writing that she'll never get married. 

260
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,958
Hey, what happened? Did you feel bad about what dad said? 

261
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:14,166
AP, ever guy wants a wife as radiant as the moon. 

262
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,791
But even the moon has dark spots on it. 

263
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:22,916
Oh dear, I know one such guy! - Who? How's he? 

264
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,333
Just like our dad. 

265
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:32,625
I can burn or rot to death but a guy like dad.. 

266
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,166
Thank you so much. 

267
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:48,250
Mom! Dad! - AP, who's the one in our colony.. 

268
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,625
..whose son is so rich? 

269
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,458
How are you? - How are you? 

270
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,666
Doesn't he look like Tinu? - How are you, son? 

271
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,750
Hi AP! - It's Tinu. 

272
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,041
100% - Hi Tinu! 

273
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,500
Hi AP! - Hi Prasad! 

274
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,875
Hi. - Did you hit the jackpot in Jeddah? 

275
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,250
You can call it that. I'm a loader in the Jeddah airport. 

276
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,083
Wow. - I earn upto Rs.1 lakh in Indian currency. 

277
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,541
A lakh! What are you saying? 

278
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,125
Tinu, haven't you studied only upto the 10th standard? 

279
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,916
By God's grace. What are you doing, AP? 

280
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,541
You're just how I had left you. 

281
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,958
Even the car is the same. - It's not his. It's mine! Mine! 

282
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,083
Not yours, but your dad's. 

283
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,166
Come along with me, I'll get you a job. You'll earn well. 

284
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,208
I'm not going to be a loader. - He won't be a loader. 

285
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,041
He'll be the owner of an airport. 

286
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:38,041
Or he'll buy oil wells in Saudi and will expect us to drown in it. 

287
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,833
Earlier, my mom used to thrash me and tell me.. 

288
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,666
..that AP ranks first in class. It's just God's grace.. 

289
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,125
..that I've risen up and you all have remained where you were. 

290
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,000
God is great! Bye! See you later. 

291
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,000
Is this how you do justice? You do good for the bad.. 

292
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,083
..and never do good for the good. 

293
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,916
Look! Look! He stands in the center of the colony.. 

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,333
..and abuses his dad! 

295
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,250
I'm not telling you, I'm telling the one above. 

296
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,291
I'm the one standing above. - There's one above you, too.. 

297
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,916
..and he's my enemy. 

298
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,416
Sir, sometimes I feel that you're right. 

299
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,791
Even God doesn't listen to the poor. 

300
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,166
I didn't win anything even today. 

301
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,875
Then who did? - Someone called Yash Chopra. 

302
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,375
Don't ever give money to those who need it. - Yes. 

303
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,125
Give it to those who don't need it. 

304
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,625
Where do I give you money from? 

305
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,625
If you want money, then tell your mom to sell this house.. 

306
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,625
..and bring your parents to the streets at this age. 

307
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,541
"Beloved, I am crazy." 

308
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:59,583
"Listen to the poor, he'll listen to you." 

309
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:03,916
"If you give Re.1, he'll give you Rs.10 crore." 

310
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,666
Give me just Re.1, sir, in the name of the Lord. 

311
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,458
God doesn't listen to me, how he will listen to you. 

312
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,708
He doesn't have the time to shift attention from.. 

313
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,708
..Napean Sea road, Warden road to listen to your pleas. 

314
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,875
Do you want to earn money? - Of course. 

315
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:22,291
Then sing a remix. "Kaanta Laga.. Chadti Jawaani.." 

316
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,833
Sing it for me once. 

317
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,583
"My blooming youth, my enchanting gait.." 

318
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:34,500
"You never could value it, Rama. O Rama.." 

319
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,625
Did you get the secret now? Yes. Very nice. - AP. 

320
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,833
Will leave now. - Come on. 

321
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,041
Go. 

322
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,416
"A thorn pricked me." - Everybody is useful here. 

323
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,125
What's wrong with him? - Nothing, just like that. 

324
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,875
That beggar was suddenly singing such weird songs, isn't it? 

325
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:56,000
I taught him to. If he sings movie songs, he'll earn well. 

326
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,375
Else he'll starve to death. 

327
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,333
Do you want to eat? - No. 

328
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:05,291
Why will you? You must be having food cooked by your mom. 

329
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,250
Yes, but dad had cooked today. 

330
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,583
Even your dad cooks? 

331
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,541
Yes, If you eat the food cooked by him.. 

332
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,250
..then you don't feel hungry all day. 

333
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,541
I understood. Here, have a sandwich. Eat it. 

334
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,541
Why was he angry today? 

335
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,458
He doesn't need a reason to be angry. 

336
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,500
Dad scolded me at home, now the boss will scold me. 

337
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,875
AP! Arun Prajapathi, the great. - Thank you, sir. 

338
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,375
Thank you. There's a good news for you. 

339
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,958
Thank you, sir. - Believe it or not. We've shelved the programme. 

340
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,208
Sir, what will I do then? 

341
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,083
Whether you like it or not, you'll read the weather report. 

342
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:52,708
Weather? Weather report?! Me?! 

343
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:57,208
A storm is expected on the western coast of Goa. 

344
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,458
Here. 

345
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,666
No, sir. I'm a very creative person, sir. 

346
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,166
I can't handle these weather forecasts. 

347
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,791
I've told you. You can manage my position. 

348
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,000
Sir, listen to a new idea of mine. 

349
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,791
I don't want to. - Sir, it's a wonderful show. 

350
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,125
It'll be the best one. We'll beat every other show. 

351
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,583
I don't want it. 

352
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,083
This is not a show about long beards, moustaches and kisses. 

353
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,083
It's ten times better than all that. 

354
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,000
Not me, explain it to Alia. - Alia? 

355
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,500
If she approves of it and gives an assurance.. 

356
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,041
..then I have no problem. 

357
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,958
I'll talk about the show later. 

358
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,708
Alia, I've to tell you something. - What? 

359
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,583
Alia.. 

360
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,250
I love you a lot. 

361
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,208
You are the first girl whom I am telling this to. 

362
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,250
I love you. 

363
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,541
Why are you staring at me? 

364
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,000
This is my show. 

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,416
How will you find out if I'm speaking the truth or not? 

366
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,041
Ok, that wasn't funny. Tell me seriously, what is it? 

367
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,666
Have you heard of a lie detector? - Yeah. 

368
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,125
It's now available even with.. 

369
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,541
..the Indian police, the RAW and IB. 

370
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,750
We'll import a lie detector. 

371
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,833
And invite people, for eg, policemen, politicians, etc. 

372
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,250
We'll make them sit on the chair and question them and.. 

373
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,458
..if they're lying then it'll blink red.. 

374
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,250
..and they'll be caught red-handed. 

375
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:30,000
Fantastic idea! Start working on this idea right away. 

376
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,875
But AP, I've given a personal assurance for this show. 

377
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,750
I hope nothing goes wrong. 

378
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't worry. This show is of utmost importance to me. 

379
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,625
I'll put my life at stake for it. 

380
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,041
All the best. 

381
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:51,541
Son! Shall I get tea for you? - Mom, haven't you slept yet? 

382
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,541
I've been noticing that you're working all night these days. 

383
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,041
I've got a new show, mom. 

384
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,750
Work with complete dedication.. 

385
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:03,000
..and I fully believe that you'll be a rage. 

386
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,166
You'll beat everybody! - Is it? 

387
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,750
Just assume that the shot has been fired. 

388
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,208
All the other channels have been floored. 

389
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:15,291
Once my show becomes a hit then respect, wealth.. 

390
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,958
..cars, bungalows, MP's wedding in UP. 

391
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:22,166
MP has to get married but so do you. 

392
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,833
Did you speak to Walia or not? 

393
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,958
Not Walia, mom. It's Alia. 

394
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:32,541
Yes, Alia. Talk to her soon. 

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,750
I'll talk to her once my show becomes a hit. 

396
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:40,666
You're very slow and the girls these days are fast. 

397
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,041
If a guy as fast as her comes into her life then.. 

398
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,125
Sir, it's the staffs' parking space. 

399
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,458
Alia, I've thought about the name of the show. - What? 

400
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,750
Liars, Liars pants on fire. - Nice. 

401
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:00,958
Parking full. 

402
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,875
Who has parked in my space? 

403
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,458
Sir, a star has come to the office. 

404
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,791
A star? 

405
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,375
Wonderful! Wonderful! 

406
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
You've added to our channel's strength. 

407
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,250
Do something that might get our channel the highest TRP.. 

408
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,250
Alia! Alia, please come. 

409
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:23,333
Meet him. Our channel's new creative head. Rakesh Sharma. 

410
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:28,083
Rocky! - Oh my God! Rocky! 

411
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,041
Alia. - I can't believe it. 

412
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,708
How's life. - Great, dear. 

413
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,541
Didn't I surprise you? - Big time. 

414
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:39,000
Do you know each other? - Since long. 

415
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,875
Sir, you all know her as Alia. 

416
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,375
I've known her since she was called Alu. 

417
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:45,458
Stop it. - Okay, Alu.. Sorry Alia.. - Sir! 

418
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,833
Explain everything to him. 

419
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:49,416
Of course, sir. - Alright, everybody, get to work now. 

420
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,250
Just a moment. AP, this is Rocky. Rocky, this is AP. 

421
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,666
Alright. - I recognized him. 

422
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,166
That show, 'Mano Ya Na Mano'?! 

423
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,666
That teeth breaking episode.. very funny show, man. 

424
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,250
Believe me, the funniest show I've seen. - Shall we go the office? 

425
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,666
To discuss the show. - Very funny show. - Yes. 

426
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,625
Rocky has come just now. Will talk to him.. 

427
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,500
..and then come to your cabin. - Congrats. Great show! 

428
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,416
It's been rightly said that if you've unfortunate.. 

429
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,125
..even a short man sitting on a camel.. 

430
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,791
..gets bitten on his knee by a dog. 

431
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,916
When you couldn't find somebody in India.. 

432
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,000
..you sent someone from London. Did you hear me? 

433
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:33,000
No? Just last night, mom told me that someone else.. 

434
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,458
..might come into Alia's life. 

435
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,833
And you sent that guy today itself. 

436
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,708
You pushed me?! 

437
00:29:56,958 --> 00:30:01,416
You won't ever come down. But the day I come up.. 

438
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,041
..I'll teach you a lesson. 

439
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,750
But I won't come there so soon, understood?! 

440
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,000
Sir, little bit. - No. 

441
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,000
Listen, I wanted to ask you something. 

442
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,291
Everybody in the office was happy to see me. 

443
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,000
Why did AP turn pale? 

444
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:22,041
Sir, if you love a girl and she hugs somebody else.. 

445
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,208
..then won't your face turn pale? 

446
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:26,541
Is it? Who is it? - Alia. 

447
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,750
Alia?! Does Alia love AP? 

448
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:34,625
No! No. AP loves Alia. 

449
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,041
Ok, fine. 

450
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,208
"Somebody is hero here." 

451
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:42,833
Where will you sit? 

452
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,041
Here. - Ok 

453
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,833
Tell me something. This Rocky. What is he? 

454
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,125
He's a wonderful guy. We were doing a course in Delhi, right? 

455
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,208
Yes. - You never realize how the day passes by with him. 

456
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,458
He's such a funny guy. Like that. 

457
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:01,041
I think he's a very boring guy. Very boring. 

458
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,041
Brother, get into the habit of listening to praise about me. 

459
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,000
Because henceforth, you're only going to hear them. 

460
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,500
Will you have coffee, Rocky? - No need. 

461
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,458
I think big brother is in a hot mood today. 

462
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,791
And one shouldn't have coffee when he's hot. 

463
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,041
Its not good for health. - Right. 

464
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,416
That's why I'll drink it. 

465
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,333
I'm sorry. 

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,625
Alia got this coffee for me. 

467
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,041
Do you want to drink the coffee because you want to.. 

468
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,583
..or because Alia brought it? 

469
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,083
You know.. 

470
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,375
Alia, look at his expression. We should do a show with him. 

471
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,083
Angry with the world. 

472
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:39,125
I had told you, he has a mind blowing sense of humor. 

473
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,041
Why are you laughing so much? 

474
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,583
Sorry. - I don't find him funny at all. 

475
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,583
AP, you don't know to laugh, do you at least know to play pool? 

476
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,416
Of course I can. - C'mon! 

477
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,833
Let's play pool. - No.. no.. 

478
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:56,041
The one who loses will pay all the canteen bills today. 

479
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,125
AP, don't play with him. He's very good. 

480
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:03,083
Come to pap, dear.. - But I'm very, very, very good. C'mon! 

481
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:09,125
Let's toss. You've to tell me which ball is in which hand. 

482
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,333
Ok. 

483
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,916
Black ball in the right hand. 

484
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,041
Ok. 

485
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:23,708
I've won the toss and I'll win the game too. 

486
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,708
The guy plays well. Great shot! - Great shot! 

487
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,250
Seeing you he is not feeling well. Good one, dear. 

488
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,500
What is this? 

489
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,500
You wait and see, AP is not going to win this. 

490
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:43,666
Good shot! Nice photography! - Now, see this shot. - Shot? 

491
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,000
Show-off! Let my chance come. 

492
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,208
Wow, what a shot. 

493
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,625
AP's done for. 

494
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,166
All of them have gone because they were easy. 

495
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:01,416
Don't feel too happy. Let's see if you pot the black one. 

496
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,958
Just see how I pot the black one. 

497
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:24,083
I told you it won't go! - It did. - Oh no.. 

498
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,208
I knew Rocky was going to win. 

499
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,000
Thank you, brother. You helped me win. 

500
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,125
Ladies and gentlemen, the drinks are on the house.. 

501
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,041
..because of the loser. 

502
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,666
You didn't even get a chance to show.. 

503
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,916
I warned you because I knew he was the champion in Delhi. 

504
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,791
Tell me now that he's the champion from Delhi. 

505
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,000
Play with me now. - C'mon! - I won't play. 

506
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,375
And listen all you greedy people of channel One. 

507
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:55,791
Whoever eats will vomit blood just after talking forty steps.. 

508
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,375
..and then breathe their last. 

509
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,541
Breathe their last. 

510
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,500
Loser! Loser! - What are you doing? Come on. 

511
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,666
Loser! Loser! 

512
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,041
Does Alia know that AP loves her? 

513
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,625
AP never dares to tell her. - Is he a chicken? 

514
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,958
A complete chicken. 

515
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,208
How far has he reached? - He has reached nowhere. 

516
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:17,541
He has become a driver. He just gives her lift from home to office and back. 

517
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,916
I'll do the same from now. From home to office and back. 

518
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,333
Even you? 

519
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,458
What? - Driver. - Lover! 

520
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
My formula guy is here! 

521
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,458
What are you doing? 

522
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,500
Couldn't you find any other car to commit a suicide? 

523
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,333
May my enemies commit suicide! 

524
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:37,708
I want to live now. Your idea is brilliant. 

525
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:41,666
To sing remix songs. For 15 years now, I was tired of.. 

526
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,375
..begging in the name of the Lord. 

527
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,708
I wouldn't even get two rolls of stale bread. 

528
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,916
Nowadays, I only eat burger. 

529
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,458
Go and beg else you'll have to get back to stale breads. 

530
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:54,125
Yes. "I'll build a house opposite yours.." 

531
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,375
What are you doing here? 

532
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,458
I'm returning after collecting the lottery from the head office. 

533
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,250
But I see you honking from here and that lady waving out.. 

534
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,208
.. from there, everyday. - What's your problem? 

535
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,208
If you do it, then it's disco and if I do it it's a striptease. 

536
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,083
If you do it then it's love, if I do it, it's flirting. 

537
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,291
You beat up anybody who talks to a girl. 

538
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,916
And you, yourself park your junk.. 

539
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,291
..outside a girl's house to tease her. 

540
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,541
You piece of junk! - You won't leave unharmed, isn't it? 

541
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,916
What can you do to me? 

542
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,000
Listen, you piece of junk! 

543
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,166
If there's a God and if he's listening to me.. 

544
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,375
..then I curse you that that girl won't go with you. 

545
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,250
Who's this new guy? 

546
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,416
What are you doing here? 

547
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,583
A problem with your car? - This car? 

548
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,000
If I sell one wheel of this car.. 

549
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,916
..I can buy three junk boxes like yours. 

550
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,625
Laugh now. 

551
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,791
Why have you come here? - To pick up Alia. 

552
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,208
Alia will come with me. 

553
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,083
Aren't you ashamed? How can you give a lift.. 

554
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,958
..to such a pretty girl in such an ugly car? 

555
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,833
How arrogant! 

556
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,625
Hi AP! - Hi Alia! - Rocky! 

557
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,666
What are you doing? - What are you doing? 

558
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,625
Careful, you'll soil your jeans. It's rusted. Its a dirty car. Stay away. 

559
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,958
What are you doing here? 

560
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,125
I came to pick you up. - But I go with AP everyday. 

561
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,583
Come with me today. - C'mon, it's getting late.. 

562
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,750
AP won't like it. - Even I won't like it. 

563
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,875
C'mon Alia, it's getting late for office. 

564
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,291
Sorry Rocky. I'll see you at work, okay? 

565
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,916
Bye Rocky.. 

566
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,083
C'mon! 

567
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,791
God bless you. - God bless you. 

568
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,666
Oh God, he always gets into some problem. 

569
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,958
Not just the clutch, the whole car is a problem. 

570
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,916
What now, Alia? Shall we go? 

571
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:15,166
I'm sorry, AP. It'll get very late for office. 

572
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,958
Shall I go with Rocky? - Okay. 

573
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,500
You don't mind? - No. 

574
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,333
C'mon Alia. You'll be late. 

575
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,208
Call for a mechanic. - From a dirty car.. 

576
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,041
..to a good car. 

577
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,625
Bye, come soon. 

578
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:35,666
Sell this car and buy a secondhand cycle with that money. 

579
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,291
At least there won't be a starting problem. 

580
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,000
Only manpower. 

581
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:54,000
You listened to Rangila! But you'll never listen to me. 

582
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:58,625
From among a population of 111 crores.. 

583
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,625
..you couldn't find anybody except me?! 

584
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:04,041
From among so many cars in the world.. 

585
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,083
..you could find only mine?! 

586
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:09,416
From among so many girls in the world.. 

587
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,208
..you found only mine?! Alia! 

588
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,958
Why?! What is the problem that you have with me? 

589
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,833
When will you leave me alone?! 

590
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:23,625
What's this? You want to burn me with the rays of the sun? 

591
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,083
I won't burn. 

592
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,083
What are you doing outside my cabin? 

593
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,875
You tell me what you are doing. 

594
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,333
Where's Alia ma'am? 

595
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,125
She came with Rocky two hours back. 

596
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,541
Has she come or will she be coming? 

597
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:41,000
What are saying? She left two hours earlier, right in front of me. 

598
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,875
She's left. She has left you. 

599
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,500
Do you remember what I said? 

600
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,750
When unfortunate, even a dwarf.. 

601
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,750
.,.atop a camel gets bitten by a dog. 

602
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,791
You keep sitting. They must now be in some hotel.. 

603
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,000
Shut up! Alia didn't go anywhere with him. 

604
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,916
What are you saying? Didn't you see that day.. 

605
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,375
..she hugged him a.. s if she had rediscovered her lost love. 

606
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,375
Now sit with folded hands.. 

607
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:05,083
..she's not going to let go of this opportunity. 

608
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,708
She's not going to let go of this opportunity? 

609
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,125
What are you doing? - Love. 

610
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,500
No! - I've waited four years for you, I won't let go .. 

611
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,916
..of this opportunity today. 

612
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,416
No! No! Alia is not that kind of a girl. 

613
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,250
But Rocky.. he's a rascal. He won't let go of this opportunity. 

614
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,958
For God sake, let go off me, Rocky. 

615
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,333
What are you doing, Rocky? - Love. 

616
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,750
I've been thirsting for your love for four years. 

617
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,916
I won't let go of this opportunity today. 

618
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,625
You don't know my AP. If he comes to know.. 

619
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,625
..he'll not spare you. - I don't care. 

620
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,291
You're right, Alia. I'm coming. 

621
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,750
Idiot, I won't spare you alive! 

622
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,833
Where are you going? 

623
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,250
Alia is in danger. I'm going to save her. 

624
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,166
No, no. She's not in danger but in love. 

625
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,625
They must be roaming around hand in hand. 

626
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,833
Singing duets at the beach. 

627
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:33,500
"I'll take you to Aksa beach. Are you coming?" 

628
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:43,375
"I'll take you to Aksa beach. Are you coming?" 

629
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,291
"I'll buy you tea, are you coming?" 

630
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:51,458
"I am tired hearing all this." 

631
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,916
"I am tired of roaming with you." 

632
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,833
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 

633
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:03,125
"I'll take you to meet Bachchan, are you coming?" 

634
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,166
"I'll ask Adnan to lift too, are you coming?" 

635
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,916
"Don't you dare create obstacles in my path!" 

636
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,375
"I'm the elder one, you're younger." 

637
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,916
"You're a B.A., I'm an M.A." 

638
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:56,666
Listen, elder one. There're are better ones waiting for her." 

639
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,208
"People are queuing up for her." 

640
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:01,791
"You are messing up with me unnecessarily." 

641
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,541
"I'm tired of listening to you." 

642
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,041
"I'm fed up of roaming with you." 

643
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,833
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 

644
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:17,291
"I'll make you talk to the Don, are you coming?" 

645
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:27,250
"I'll teach you Gandhi-ism, are you coming?" 

646
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,875
"Give me, give me, give me some." 

647
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,333
"Give me some tonight." 

648
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,791
"Give me, give me, give me some." 

649
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,458
"Give me some tonight." 

650
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:41,125
"Learn the lessons of love." 

651
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,666
"My heart is a school for you." 

652
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,166
"I'm the teacher and you're my student." 

653
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,916
"Listen teacher, I'm a student of yours, I'll serve you." 

654
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,500
"Teach me the lesson of love." 

655
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,958
"Why didn't you start when I was born?" 

656
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,958
"I'm tired of listening to you." 

657
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,333
"I am tired of roaming with you." 

658
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:07,208
"Let it be. Let it be. Don't show me such dreams." 

659
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:11,666
"I'll make you his sister-in-law, are you coming?" 

660
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:21,541
"I'll make you his sister, are you coming?" 

661
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,875
I searched the whole city. I am tired of sitting here. 

662
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,083
Has she come? - Not yet. 

663
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:07,583
Don't know where he took her. - If you don't tell her about.. 

664
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,125
..your feelings soon, then he'll take her forever. 

665
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,833
I'll give her this today. I'll tell her in a few days. 

666
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,250
Even now you want to wait for a few days? 

667
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,833
Do today what you want to do tomorrow! 

668
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:21,000
How many times have I told you not to sit here? 

669
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,041
He gets scared on seeing you. 

670
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,208
And what's this? You've even brought your brother?! 

671
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,958
Brother? - Now you'll invite your entire family here. Great! 

672
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,708
Don't worry, baby! Don't get scared. They're just humans. 

673
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,750
Let's go. 

674
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,333
If only God had made me a dog instead of a human.. 

675
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,583
..I would've been in her lap instead of being with you. 

676
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,000
She would've been kissing me! 

677
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,791
Forget it, pal. 

678
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:49,166
It's time for my dinner. Do you want to eat anything? 

679
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,500
Don't know what will he have. No, thank you. 

680
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,708
I am not hungry. 

681
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,791
Hello, China Garden. Yes. 

682
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,458
Sweet corn soup. One vegetable fried rice. 

683
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:03,458
Manchurian gravy and one cup fruit salad. 

684
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:09,333
Fast! Ghansu! The beggar. Remember? 

685
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,583
Send it fast. Yes. 

686
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,000
The car has come. - Alia is there. - Yes, she is there. 

687
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,833
What are they doing? - Getting out of the car. 

688
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,875
And? Is Alia happy? - Very happy. 

689
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,500
They're hugging now. - Hugging?! - Yes. 

690
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:26,916
Okay goodnight, Rocky. Bye. - Bye. 

691
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,291
She's going, swaying her hips. Yes. 

692
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,458
What's he doing? - He's jumping around like a monkey. 

693
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,416
Has taken off his jacket. He's dancing his way home. 

694
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,458
He went. Come on, hurry up. 

695
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,583
Brother, are you playing hide and seek. 

696
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:56,500
"My heart isn't at rest without my beloved." 

697
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,916
What are you doing outside Alia's house? 

698
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,833
If you're keeping an eye on Alia.. 

699
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,791
..then I'm also keeping an eye on you. 

700
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:11,541
Aren't you ashamed of spying on her in the garb of a beggar? - No. 

701
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,833
You chameleon! 

702
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:16,208
She's your friend and you love her. 

703
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,791
You chameleon! 

704
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,000
Shall I tell her? - No. - She'll feel so bad. - Don't do that. 

705
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,666
What's this? What's this? 

706
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,416
What's this? - Gift. 

707
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:31,583
It's not a gift. It's a bribe to get love. 

708
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,541
You're surely going to make her cry. 

709
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,041
Rocky. Why did you come back? 

710
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,083
I had bought a gift for you. I forgot to give it. 

711
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,625
What was the need for that? 

712
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,208
I mean.. - Please. 

713
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:53,625
Thanks. 

714
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,083
What happened? 

715
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,125
What happened? 

716
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,916
I'm shivering. - What? 

717
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:08,125
I'm scared a little. Feeling uneasy. - Why? 

718
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,791
A dengue mosquito stung me. 

719
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,708
Oh my God! Come inside. I'll check your temperature. C'mon! 

720
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:22,791
Oh God! God! God! 

721
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,166
When you're done worshipping God.. 

722
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,416
..then you can worship your husband also. 

723
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,750
I've been asking for bitter gourd juice since two hours. 

724
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,541
But nobody is bothered. 

725
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,541
This is what happens after retirement. 

726
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:40,541
Madhu, give your dad a glass of bitter gourd juice. 

727
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,333
Give him some honey along with it. 

728
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:44,041
He might start talking sweetly. - Shut up. 

729
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,375
Pray with me. 

730
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,541
Mother, for years, you've offered.. 

731
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:54,625
..fruits, flowers, oil. Whatever has been offered to him. 

732
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,583
Had you saved that money, your son would've.. 

733
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,166
..owned a new car today, mom. 

734
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,000
Don't say such things, God will be offended. 

735
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:06,166
When was he pleased? What has he given us anyway? 

736
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,375
What hasn't he given us? 

737
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,458
He has given me good children. 

738
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,791
What else does one need? 

739
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:16,000
He gave you good children but never did anything for them. 

740
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:19,708
No! An unemployed son killed his father.. 

741
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,750
..and also managed to get acquitted? 

742
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,000
If only.. - His mother committed a suicide. 

743
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,625
C'mon, dear. Let's have breakfast. 

744
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:34,500
Father. - Who are you? - Madhu! Madhu! Madhu! 

745
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,583
What's that smeared on your face? 

746
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:41,000
It's not smeared. I've applied crushed berries on my face. 

747
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:45,833
What does that do? - It clears all the marks on one's face. 

748
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,166
You had said the same thing after smearing.. 

749
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,875
..gourd, cucumber and orange. 

750
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:55,416
How many times have I told you to use a spoon not your fingers? 

751
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,583
You never listen. - He likes fingering everything. 

752
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,250
I have ten of them. - Stuffed cauliflower bread. 

753
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,416
Wow, mother! I wanted to eat stuffed bread. 

754
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,916
Eat, son. Eat! You ate from my salary earlier.. 

755
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,041
..now eat from my pension. Eat! Eat! 

756
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,875
Son, you're getting up without eating your breakfast. 

757
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,750
Enough mother. I am full. - Son, have your breakfast. 

758
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,166
I'll start drinking now. 

759
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,000
You'll have to pay heavily. 

760
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,125
Ma'am, how do you tolerate it? 

761
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:24,875
Sir is at home all day. My Dagdu sits at home.. 

762
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:28,916
..but he still loves me a lot. He doesn't sit at home and complain. 

763
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,166
Go and do your work. - I'm going. Going. 

764
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,958
Oh god! 

765
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,541
He left without eating. 

766
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:39,625
What's your problem? He's working. 

767
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:42,875
What work does he do? His show flopped. 

768
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,500
These are all temporary jobs. 

769
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:47,458
He should work in the municipality like me. 

770
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:51,208
You'll get a salary till your sixty and a pension till you die. 

771
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,500
God knows what work he does. 

772
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:56,166
Wait and watch! My son will become famous someday. 

773
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,375
Understood? 

774
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,833
Finally all done! 

775
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,250
Son, you're working very hard this time. 

776
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,291
See, this time God will surely make you a success. 

777
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,375
Mom, bring in anybody but not him. 

778
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,208
See, I've got an allergy. 

779
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,541
Shut up! Your work never gets done because you talk like this. 

780
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:27,541
See, I've made this amulet for you with a lot of devotion. 

781
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,708
Wear this and see how all your work gets done in a jiffy. 

782
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,750
I'll wear it because you're telling me to, mom. 

783
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,750
But if I ever have to face an obstacle after wearing this.. 

784
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,041
..there'll be none more worse than me. 

785
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:42,000
Nothing bad will happen. You can see it today. 

786
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,958
AP, does this chair really work? 

787
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,208
Alia, I want you to sit on this chair first. 

788
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,916
But what do I say? 

789
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:56,458
Whatever you feel like. 

790
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:08,458
AP, I'm very happy. And my heartfelt wishes that.. 

791
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,083
..your show becomes a success. 

792
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,666
The green light is glowing. 

793
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,125
It's straight from the heart. For AP. 

794
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,166
I can see two chairs. Wedding chairs. 

795
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,541
AP on one and Alia on the other. 

796
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,250
I'll surely go to congratulate them. 

797
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,583
This is great. - Yes, I'll go to congratulate them. 

798
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:32,666
This is amazing. This show will be sensational. 

799
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,833
You just watch! - The show hasn't begun yet. I won't let it begin. 

800
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,458
"Party all night. Let's party." 

801
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,000
"Party all night. Let's party." 

802
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,208
"Party all night. Let's party." 

803
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:48,958
"Party all night. Let's party." 

804
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,291
"Party all night. Let's party." 

805
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,750
"Party all night. Let's party." 

806
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:16,500
"Whatever we've thought today." 

807
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,166
"That'll happen tomorrow." 

808
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:23,708
"Whatever is our dream today.." 

809
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:26,375
"It'll come true tomorrow." 

810
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,833
"We believe that it's our world." 

811
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:34,500
"Let's dance with joy." 

812
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:40,833
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

813
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:48,625
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

814
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,791
"Whatever we've thought today." 

815
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,583
"That'll happen tomorrow." 

816
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,958
"Whatever is our dream today.." 

817
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:05,416
"It'll come true tomorrow." 

818
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:18,416
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

819
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:26,000
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

820
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,708
"There should be a gathering. There's should be fun." 

821
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:38,250
"The world should be having fun." 

822
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,041
"Every heart should be crazy." 

823
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,791
"Every moment should be joyous." 

824
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,958
"There should be such reasons to celebrate." 

825
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:48,791
"If there's an opportunity and if there's a mate.." 

826
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:52,500
"..then why won't every heart go crazy?" 

827
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,333
"Eyes in the eyes.." 

828
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,166
"Arms in the arms.." 

829
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,625
"Hearts should mingle with hearts." 

830
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:03,250
"We believe that it's our world." 

831
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:07,000
"Let's dance with joy." 

832
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:13,375
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

833
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:21,125
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

834
00:54:53,083 --> 00:55:00,125
"It's said that none in this world have been able to ignore love." 

835
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:07,208
"Even I wanted to. But I've seen that I've never found anybody." 

836
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:14,333
"It happens. It's the world. Not everybody has got everything." 

837
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:17,958
"You only get as much as you are destined to.." 

838
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,458
"..there's nothing to complain about." 

839
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:25,041
"We believe that it's our world." 

840
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:29,833
"Let's dance with joy." 

841
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:35,458
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

842
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,958
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

843
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,000
"Whatever we've thought today." 

844
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,791
"That'll happen tomorrow." 

845
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:55,083
"Whatever is our dream today.." 

846
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,833
"It'll come true tomorrow." 

847
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:02,208
"We believe that it's our world." 

848
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:06,166
"Let's dance with joy." 

849
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,708
"C'mon everybody, let's party." 

850
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:34,333
"Let's party! C'mon everybody, let's party." 

851
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,916
"Let's party." 

852
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:44,541
Ladies and gentlemen, may I've your attention please. Thank you. 

853
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:48,125
It's now time to announce our.. 

854
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:54,000
..new program, "Liar, liar pants on fire." 

855
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,625
All the best to you. - Thank you. 

856
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,916
Look. - I think, this is the right thing. 

857
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,333
Everybody's waiting. What are you doing? 

858
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,833
Did you connect it properly? - What's happening? 

859
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,958
Hurry up, please. - I am trying. 

860
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,541
Why isn't it working? - AP, I had told you. 

861
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,916
There isn't any scope of mistake this time. - What do I do.. 

862
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,125
..if his laptop is faulty? - Faulty laptop? 

863
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,666
No, sir. His DVD is corrupted. - DVD? 

864
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,416
No, sir. Your luck is bad. You're ruined. 

865
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,958
The sponsors, the media and the guests are outside. 

866
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,666
Oh God. - What have you done, AP? 

867
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:41,166
Sir, don't listen to him.. - Shut up! Shut up! 

868
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,333
Rocky, please do something. Save me and my channel.. 

869
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,916
..from this embarrassment. 

870
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:48,333
Sir, Alia had told me about the concept. 

871
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,875
So I had prepared a presentation. - Yes. 

872
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,250
Shall I play that? - Please. Please. 

873
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,333
Play anything as long as it saves me from being disgraced. 

874
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,041
Please! Put it on. 

875
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,375
That's like it. Well done, Rocky! Well done! 

876
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:15,916
Well done, rocky. What a presentation. fantastic! 

877
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,333
You prepared this presentation? You prepared? 

878
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,958
You made this? - Hey! What kind of behavior is this? 

879
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,791
Sir, I prepared this presentation. I made it! - What? 

880
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,625
Brother, such a blatant lie! 

881
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,208
He saved the channel from disgrace.. 

882
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,500
..and you caught him by his collar? 

883
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,458
Sir, this presentation.. - What? 

884
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,416
Sir, I don't want any credit for this program. 

885
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,458
He's afraid that I'll replace him in his own show. 

886
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Sir.. - Brother, this show will remain yours. 

887
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,833
No way! Now, Rocky will do this show. 

888
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:45,250
Sir.. - And you get out of here. Get out! 

889
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:47,291
I said, get out of here. 

890
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:50,083
And don't ever dare to show your face here. 

891
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:53,625
Sir, give AP an opportunity to clarify his stand. 

892
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,708
I had given him this opportunity only on your behest. 

893
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:56,958
What difference did it make? 

894
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:10,000
Thank you! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. 

895
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:13,375
Thank you! The creator of the show you viewed just now.. 

896
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:18,750
..is Rakesh Sharma, your Rocky. - Thank you everyone. 

897
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:05,125
Why do you break the car? Beat me. Kill me. 

898
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,791
Why did you send me to this world? 

899
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,958
To trouble me? 

900
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:15,666
This amulet was given to me by mom with so many expectations. 

901
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:19,333
A mother is given the same respect as.. 

902
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:22,750
..God but you can't tolerate her blessings. 

903
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,666
My mother is naïve. Naïve. 

904
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:32,333
She worships you despite all the problems you create. 

905
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:37,458
This amulet was blessed by you, isn't it? 

906
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:43,416
Take it back. 

907
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:20,875
AP. You have come. I couldn't sleep as I was so happy. 

908
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:24,166
I was thanking God all night. 

909
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,916
It has been launched, isn't it son? 

910
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,041
Is everything alright, son? Arun? 

911
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:39,333
What is it? What happened? 

912
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:49,541
Everything's over. I've lost my job too. 

913
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,708
Dad is right. 

914
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,250
I'm good for nothing. 

915
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,041
Hello! - Hello! Arun Prajapathi? 

916
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:46,000
'I heard that you've quit your job with the channel.' 

917
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,750
I didn't quit, I was kicked out. 

918
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,375
'If you want a new job then come to the Hyatt hotel.. 

919
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,041
..18th floor, 1801. Come there.' 

920
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:58,541
I'll wait for you. - Thank you. I'm grateful to you. 

921
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:04,041
'The car is broken. He lost his job last night.' 

922
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,791
Who knows what he is avenging? He'll ruin us. 

923
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,541
'You please keep quiet. He is already tensed.' 

924
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:14,416
Father, the good thing about bad times is that.. 

925
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,458
..it passes away. 

926
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,083
You're the only one who doesn't. 

927
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,416
Come in, Arun Prajapati. 

928
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:02,333
Anybody here? 

929
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:05,833
Arun Prajapati. - Yes, sir? - Please sit. 

930
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:15,208
Sir, I can hear you but you're nowhere to be seen. 

931
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,833
Humans aren't allowed to see me hence I'm invisible. 

932
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:26,708
Oh! Invisible? Invisible! 

933
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:28,708
What kind of a joke is this? 

934
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:31,958
You called me up and asked me to come. 

935
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,958
And now that I've come, you tell me that you're invisible? 

936
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,916
Who are you? - I'm God. 

937
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:40,250
Hey! You don't become God by calling yourself one. 

938
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,541
Look, I don't like such jokes. 

939
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,500
Just last night, I have lost my job. 

940
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,125
I'm already upset. Don't upset me more. 

941
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:51,583
You are cracking jokes at such a sad time! 

942
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't want your job. I'm leaving. 

943
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,416
Excuse me. Who's staying at 1801? Who's he? 

944
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,625
Sorry, sir. There isn't any 1801 room here. 

945
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:10,458
The room on the eighteenth floor. On the right. 

946
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:13,875
Sir, this hotel has only 15 floors, not 18. 

947
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,708
Are you sure? - Yes, sir. 

948
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,458
Thank God! God! 

949
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:29,041
Come in, Arun Prajapati. 

950
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:53,125
Arun Prajapati, you wanted to see me, right? 

951
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,291
See me! 

952
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:32,250
Who are you? - God. 

953
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:36,125
God? In the form of a man? 

954
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:40,791
I had to take the form of a man to appear before you. 

955
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,291
How do I believe that you're God? 

956
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,458
You had thrown this amulet at me last night. 

957
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:55,291
So you were there last night. 

958
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:58,875
You picked up my amulet, heard all that I said.. 

959
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:03,250
..and gave me a call asking me to come here if I wanted a job. 

960
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:06,958
And now that I've come here, you're making me hear voices.. 

961
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
..making rooms disappear and even telling me that you're God. 

962
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:12,000
How do I believe that you're God? 

963
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,041
Why should I believe that you're God? 

964
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,833
What noise is this? It sounds familiar! 

965
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,625
Don't worry! Don't worry, you won't fall. 

966
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,000
It's solid right? - Absolutely solid. 

967
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:33,666
Don't leave my hand. 

968
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,250
I am scared of height. 

969
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,666
Do you believe me now? - Yes. 

970
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,875
That's the problem with you, humans. 

971
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:44,791
You don't believe unless I perform miracles. - Correct. 

972
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,458
But shall I ask you something? - Yes. 

973
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,333
Neither did I meet with an accident.. 

974
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:54,083
..nor did I fall sick. Then why am I up here and the world down? 

975
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,833
Tell me, God, have I passed away from the world? 

976
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,875
No. - Then why did you call me up so high? 

977
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:01,083
What do you want from me? 

978
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:04,291
Not me, what do you want from me? - Me?! - Yes. 

979
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,208
Since the day I've created this world.. 

980
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:08,208
..I've created millions of humans. 

981
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,666
All of them like me, love me and worship me. 

982
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:15,458
Sometimes when there's a calamity they get upset with me. 

983
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,125
But then you're the only one who shouts at me.. 

984
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:21,500
..even when you break the windshield of your car. 

985
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:24,833
That's right. All the problems in my life are because of you. 

986
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:27,250
Whenever things are going right for me, you do something to spoil it. 

987
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:29,041
God, shall I tell you something? 

988
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,291
Please don't feel bad. 

989
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:34,041
Not just me, nobody in this world is happy with you. 

990
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,708
They say that you created the world and forgot about it. 

991
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:38,625
I forgot about my own world? 

992
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,583
There are just two fathers in this world.. 

993
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,291
..who gave life and forgot about us. 

994
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:44,833
One is my biological father and the other is you. 

995
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,666
You sit high up and watch the world. 

996
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,125
Be among the humans and see their world. 

997
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,416
Live amidst them and feel their pain and problems. 

998
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:56,291
See how it feels when his sister sits unmarried at home. 

999
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,125
When he doesn't get the girl he loves. 

1000
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,916
When he loses his source of income. 

1001
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:02,916
You say that we're your children. 

1002
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,625
You trouble your children, aren't you ashamed? 

1003
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,000
If everybody had a house, a car and a bungalow.. 

1004
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:11,458
..then everybody would've worshipped you. 

1005
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:13,958
Whatever I've given one is, what is good for him. 

1006
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,875
His well-being lies in it. 

1007
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,041
But whose well-being lies in problems and pain. 

1008
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,041
But you won't understand this. 

1009
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,041
Because you're God, not human. 

1010
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:25,625
You don't have a human heart in you. 

1011
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:29,083
And only a human can understand one, not God. 

1012
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:32,125
You mean to say that if a human instead of me had.. 

1013
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,375
..reigned over the world, he would've done a better job? 

1014
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,625
Of course. 

1015
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,916
Ok. 

1016
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,916
I'll give you all my powers. 

1017
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:44,083
You shall rule the world for the next 10 days. 

1018
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:47,375
I shall definitely do a better job than you. 

1019
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,958
What noise is this? 

1020
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,458
They're prayers and requests that people all over.. 

1021
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:00,583
..the world are asking me. Now that you've become God.. 

1022
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:02,041
..you're able to hear them. 

1023
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,208
Stop it! 

1024
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,333
Now make me hear them only when I ask you to. 

1025
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:13,916
Remember one thing. Don't tell anybody that you're God. 

1026
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:18,041
Else you'll lose all your powers. - Ok. Done. 

1027
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:56,291
Now whatever I am, however I am, it's me for the next ten days! 

1028
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,250
Sorry. 

1029
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,041
Bless you. 

1030
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:17,250
Listen, you wouldn't be wearing underwear. 

1031
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:19,875
If you are wearing one, then apart from.. 

1032
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,083
..it take off everything else. 

1033
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,375
Tuck your shirt in like me. 

1034
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:32,916
Good morning, sir. 

1035
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,875
What are you doing, baldie? Get the car. 

1036
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,041
Sir, the car didn't get started. It is right where it was. 

1037
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,833
Sir, you changed your clothes. Now change the car too. 

1038
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,541
Oh smarty! 

1039
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,083
I'll make hair grow on your ears. 

1040
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,708
Did you hear? In your world, it was like this. 

1041
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:57,041
In my world.. just watch. 

1042
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:19,875
"I run faster than life." 

1043
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:23,500
"Time is behind me. I am ahead." 

1044
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,791
"I was something yesterday.." 

1045
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:33,291
"I'm something else today. I won't stop for anyone now." 

1046
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:40,208
"I run faster than life." 

1047
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,666
"Time is behind me. I am ahead." 

1048
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,958
"I was something yesterday.." 

1049
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:48,041
"I'm something else today. I won't stop for anyone now." 

1050
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:52,791
"If I wish I can turn day into night and night into day." 

1051
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,041
"Into day.." 

1052
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,333
"Into day.." 

1053
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:59,333
"O' God! O' God!" 

1054
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,958
"O' God, you're great." 

1055
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:05,416
"O' God, you're great." 

1056
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,958
"O' God, you're great." 

1057
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:10,708
"O' God, you're great." 

1058
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:25,666
"I can touch the sky by stretching my hands." 

1059
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:30,708
"The moon and the stars play near me." 

1060
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:35,291
"Morning walks holding my finger." 

1061
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:40,791
"In my control are the two worlds." 

1062
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:46,083
"The key to luck and the rein of life are in my hands." 

1063
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,625
"I can make whoever I want to dance to my tunes." 

1064
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:53,500
"I've the power in my words." 

1065
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,291
"I'm the master of the universe." 

1066
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,375
"I can do whatever I want to.." 

1067
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,875
"I can do whatever I want to.." 

1068
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:04,958
"O' God! O' God!" 

1069
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:08,541
"O' God, you're great." 

1070
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:11,000
"O' God, you're great." 

1071
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:13,541
"O' God, you're great." 

1072
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:16,791
"O' God, you're great." 

1073
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:00,333
"I'm the nature, I'm the power." 

1074
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,333
"Then why did you give me this problem?" 

1075
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:04,416
"I'm the earth and the heaven." 

1076
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,708
"Then grant every prayer." 

1077
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:10,916
"I hold the highest place, there's none higher than me." 

1078
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,208
"If we weren't there then who would pray to you?" 

1079
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:19,083
"I'm so omniscient that I grant before being asked for." 

1080
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:21,125
"If you're such an ocean of mercy.. 

1081
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,333
..then why don't you grant us our wishes? 

1082
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:27,000
"I agree that you gave us brains, but see how we used it." 

1083
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:31,500
"Just use your brains and tell me what did you achieve?" 

1084
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:35,291
"We invented computers, robots and satellites." 

1085
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:44,000
"You speak of yourself, fool! Who made you?" 

1086
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:46,333
"Me!" 

1087
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:51,875
"Your life is in my hands, you tell me what do I do?" 

1088
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,875
"What do I do?" "What do I do?" 

1089
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:07,000
"O' God, you're great." 

1090
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:09,500
"O' God, you're great." 

1091
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,958
"O' God, you're great." 

1092
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:14,958
"O' God, you're great." 

1093
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,833
Calm down! Calm down! Let us do our job! 

1094
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:28,291
Hey, shut up! Why are you making noise? 

1095
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,875
The police aren't agreeing to our demands. 

1096
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:33,416
Rascals! Let's take them out one by one and finish them. 

1097
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,250
Do one thing, bring all of them here. 

1098
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:38,208
Let me go inside. Please, let me go. 

1099
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:41,333
Children are a form of God, only God can save them now. 

1100
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,500
"Oh God!" 

1101
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,958
You can't go in. - Why? What happened? 

1102
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,791
There was a birthday party going on at King's Burger. 

1103
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,041
Some terrorists barged in. 

1104
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,041
Every child's life is endangered. 

1105
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,750
They're even firing at us. 

1106
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,000
Send some commandos. 

1107
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:05,333
What will those commandos do, when this commando is here? 

1108
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,291
Hello children! 

1109
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:27,000
Hey! Have you come here to die? 

1110
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,000
No, to kill. 

1111
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,875
Do you know who we are? 

1112
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,875
You can't be God and you don't look human. 

1113
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,750
And I hate demons. 

1114
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:39,875
Take him on. 

1115
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:45,208
Roast him! 

1116
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:54,750
"Oh God!" 

1117
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,083
"Oh God!" 

1118
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:12,833
Get him! 

1119
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,458
"Oh God!" 

1120
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:30,208
"Oh God!" 

1121
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,625
Kill the children. 

1122
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:38,500
What's going on? How is it going up? 

1123
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,875
"Oh God!" 

1124
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,291
"Oh God!" 

1125
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,875
"Oh God!" 

1126
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:11,458
Hey, throw it or it'll explode! 

1127
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,208
Hey! - Back off! 

1128
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,375
Hey kids! - What? 

1129
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:22,000
These bad uncles troubled you a lot, isn't it? - Yes. 

1130
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,875
It's our turn now. - Yes. 

1131
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:27,500
We'll make them cry now. - Yeah! 

1132
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,041
Go! 

1133
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:41,333
Let go off me! 

1134
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:42,833
Spiderman, stick to it. 

1135
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,333
Pull him! Pull him! 

1136
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,583
C'mon, Superman! 

1137
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,041
There he is hiding. 

1138
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:02,291
Praise be to Lord Hanuman! 

1139
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,708
Praise be to Lord Hanuman! 

1140
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,000
Hey Krish! 

1141
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,625
Batman! 

1142
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,833
Hit him and turn him into a ball. 

1143
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:13,625
Shaktiman! 

1144
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:22,458
He looks like a magician. Casts charms with his eyes. - Yes. 

1145
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,583
I'll blindfold him. - Yes, boss. 

1146
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,166
Come on. 

1147
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,250
You took it back. - "Oh God." 

1148
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,708
You took back the powers. 

1149
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,458
You took back the powers. 

1150
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,375
You took back the powers. 

1151
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,875
God! 

1152
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:50,916
What did I say? - What? 

1153
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,625
That nobody should know that you've God's powers. - Yes. 

1154
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:56,958
And you're showing off in front of everybody. 

1155
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:58,333
Sorry God! 

1156
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:00,708
Actually I was just testing the powers. My mistake. 

1157
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:03,125
I'll never do it again. Let me go back. 

1158
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:06,250
It's a question of the children's lives. Please. 

1159
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,625
Ok. But keep it in mind henceforth. 

1160
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:11,000
Ok, boss. Sorry.. God. 

1161
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,458
Save me! 

1162
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,125
Save me! 

1163
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,875
Hey, please help me from these demons. 

1164
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:21,375
Look at my hands.. my legs. - Enough! 

1165
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:22,750
My father! 

1166
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:29,958
Fools! Learn to love your country, not betray it. 

1167
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,125
Understood? 

1168
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:34,958
Wow! 

1169
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,208
Move! Move.. back! 

1170
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:39,375
'All the kids are out escaping from the terrorists.' 

1171
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:42,375
'We have to yet to see whether all the kids are out are not.' 

1172
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,750
'And we have to see..' 

1173
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:45,250
Where are the terrorists? 

1174
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,833
Patriots, come out. 

1175
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:50,166
Hail Mother India! 

1176
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,041
We'll lay down our lives for our nation! 

1177
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,250
Hail Mother India! 

1178
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,458
Hail Mother India! 

1179
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:59,125
We'll lay down our lives for our nation! 

1180
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,750
How did you manage to do all this? 

1181
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,625
Get those channel people away from here then I'll do it. 

1182
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:05,500
Come on, let's go. 

1183
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,125
The one who should've been only on my channel.. 

1184
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:10,458
..he's on every channel except mine. 

1185
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,041
I want AP! 

1186
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,291
Sir, I know AP. He's a chicken. A coward! 

1187
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,083
He must've fought out of fear for his life. 

1188
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:19,166
He's not a hero. 

1189
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,416
He'll ensure the closure of our channel. 

1190
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,208
He's become the public hero in a day. Think of it. 

1191
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,166
How much our channel can profit from him. 

1192
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,083
Sir, where do you think from? - I.. 

1193
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:29,875
Sir, you've insulted him so much. Why would he come back? 

1194
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,166
I'll plead before him. I'll fall at his feet. 

1195
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,125
I'll say, AP I've forgiven so many mistakes of yours. 

1196
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,166
Please forgive me for once. 

1197
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,791
He won't come. - He won't come. 

1198
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,791
He'll agree if Alia requests. 

1199
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,208
A son confiscates father's property. 

1200
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,666
Hello! Excuse me.. 

1201
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,291
Just a moment. Are you an LIC agent? 

1202
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:53,416
No. - Have you come to sell credit cards? Car loans? 

1203
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,083
Or if you've come to talk about buying the house.. 

1204
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,250
..then talk to HP. 

1205
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,791
No, sir. No. You're mistaken. 

1206
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,208
Just a moment. You tell me. 

1207
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,750
Sir, he's Mr. Keval Chandani, the CEO of Channel One. 

1208
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,791
That's right. - And I'm Alia Kapoor. - Oh, yeah. 

1209
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:07,625
Alia?! I'm AP's sister, MP. 

1210
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:09,833
And he's my father. - Father?! 

1211
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:12,083
Hey! What are you doing?! At least consider your age! 

1212
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:15,208
Sir. - Father, you're great. You've given birth to AP. 

1213
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:17,291
Ok, fine. Fine. Sit here and talk. - Okay. 

1214
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,666
I'll give you a suggestion. Give up this channel job. 

1215
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,916
You can be kicked out any day. 

1216
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,875
I still have a say in the municipality. 

1217
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,291
I can get you a job here. 

1218
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,375
I'll give you an application right away. - Right away! 

1219
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:28,375
Alia dear, you? - Hello, mummy. 

1220
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,041
Greetings, aunty. - Greetings - God bless you. 

1221
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,833
I've seen you on TV quite a lot of times. 

1222
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:35,041
But you look much more beautiful in person. 

1223
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:37,791
Isn't it? - Like me. 

1224
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:41,666
You are right. - Is AP there? - Yes, in his room. 

1225
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:44,166
Where will you go leaving your God, madam? 

1226
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,208
Beat no.8. Beat no.9. 

1227
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:52,000
Welcome to your Lord's abode. 

1228
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,625
Hi AP. Hi AP! 

1229
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,000
Boss, you?! 

1230
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:09,416
Your room is so nice. 

1231
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:13,750
I imported all the furniture recently. 

1232
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:17,875
Won't you ask about my grandparents? 

1233
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,250
How are they? - They're fine. 

1234
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,750
They passed away 150 years ago. 

1235
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:29,166
Let me listen to what she's thinking about me. 

1236
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:31,583
He must be thinking that I should apologise to him. 

1237
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,458
But he should also know that there're no apologies.. 

1238
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:37,583
..and thanksgivings in love. But he's so cute. 

1239
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:42,458
I'll apologise. - No need to apologise. 

1240
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:46,541
How did you know that I was going to apologise? 

1241
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:53,166
Look, a girl in your place won't turn around and punch. 

1242
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:59,291
She'll either say 'sorry' or 'I love you'. 

1243
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:05,083
I felt really bad for what happened in the party. 

1244
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,500
Even the boss is sorry about it. 

1245
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:10,916
And I don't like it in office without you. 

1246
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:14,833
I've come to take you, will you come along? 

1247
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:20,875
Can I ever refuse you? - So you'll come? 

1248
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:22,250
Obviously Alia. 

1249
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:26,666
Keval sir! What bravery and what honour! 

1250
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,041
Sir, that.. - What was the need for him to barge in there? 

1251
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,083
But! - That's the work of the government! - Yes. 

1252
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,291
The police! - Yes. 

1253
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:33,791
The force! - You are absolutely right! 

1254
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,416
Thankfully he survived! 

1255
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:39,208
Son, is that the way to behave with guests? 

1256
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:41,958
Look, your father is boring your boss! 

1257
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:46,083
I have raised my son with such difficulty! 

1258
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,416
Yes. - What if he had died? 

1259
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:49,125
Am I saying something wrong? 

1260
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:51,000
You are absolutely right! - Am I right? 

1261
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:53,041
You are absolutely right! 

1262
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:55,666
What are you nodding to everything! Saying yes for everything! 

1263
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,375
Sir this.. - Was there anyone as brave.. 

1264
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:58,791
..as my son there? - No! 

1265
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,750
He risked his life and saved those children! 

1266
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:02,958
You are absolutely right! 

1267
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,416
I had raised him for such a day. - Yes! 

1268
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,875
He has made me so proud! 

1269
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:10,166
You are so right! - Sir! - There comes my son! 

1270
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:14,000
AP! I am sorry, forgive me! 

1271
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,291
Sir, AP has forgiven you and he has.. 

1272
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,541
..agreed to join the channel again. 

1273
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:21,125
Fantastic, AP! Thank you! 

1274
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,833
AP has become so famous that.. 

1275
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:27,250
..channel TRPs are to the roof. It's amazing. - What amazing! 

1276
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:28,875
He considers himself to be a star only by taking mere.. 

1277
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,000
..two to three interviews. - Hey! - Hi! 

1278
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,583
Get used to hearing praises! 

1279
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:37,125
Because, now you will only hear my praises in this office! 

1280
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,958
You are repeating my line to me! 

1281
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,166
Be original, dear? 

1282
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:44,125
Will you play? - Come on. 

1283
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,750
Set it! Warm up! 

1284
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:48,541
Please AP, the last time I had told you that he's Delhi's champion. 

1285
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:51,000
Don't play. - No matter where he is from? 

1286
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:52,958
I will win! 

1287
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,125
Toss! 

1288
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,166
Tell me. 

1289
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,000
Black ball in the right hand! 

1290
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:08,000
You've lost again. 

1291
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:11,083
Look. - See the ball. 

1292
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:16,083
I have won the toss and I will win the game too. 

1293
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:39,791
Quiet! 

1294
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,166
How did that happen? 

1295
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,333
It's not possible! How did you do that? 

1296
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:46,208
You blind man! Didn't you see how it happened? 

1297
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,375
Who are you? 

1298
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,541
Where is AP? 

1299
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:51,958
The one who used to lose was AP! 

1300
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:54,083
You are not AP! - Come on, Rocky! 

1301
01:29:54,166 --> 01:29:56,333
AP was like this before, and still he is the same. 

1302
01:29:56,625 --> 01:30:00,500
Loser! Loser! - Bye! 

1303
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,208
He left and you were left with the ball. 

1304
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,000
Look at Alia! She never leaves AP for a minute! 

1305
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:13,416
But I know AP! He cannot propose! 

1306
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,833
I feel Alia will propose to him! 

1307
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,291
Really! - Yes! 

1308
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,708
Then I will propose to her right away. 

1309
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:21,000
Do one thing.. when it is lunch break.. 

1310
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,000
..bring a bride's attire for me. 

1311
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,875
Shall I go right away and get my wife's? 

1312
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,041
Second hand? - Yes. 

1313
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:27,333
No. Brand new. 

1314
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:30,958
Bride's attire for my Alia. - It's very beautiful. 

1315
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,041
Why are you hitting me, sir? 

1316
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,375
It's worth 20,000! 

1317
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,416
At this rate, I can buy a motorcycle in India! 

1318
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,958
Bride's attire. 

1319
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,916
You take it to Alia! 

1320
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,833
If she says yes.. 

1321
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:46,083
..then I will buy you a car instead of a motorcycle. 

1322
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,125
Here! 

1323
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,833
God, now everything is in your hand. 

1324
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:57,041
Absolutely. 

1325
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:08,583
"Rocking." 

1326
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,791
Hey, stop! 

1327
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,458
Come here. 

1328
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:40,583
"O God." 

1329
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,041
Who has sent it? - Rocky.. sir! 

1330
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:52,500
Lust for you. - "O God." 

1331
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:54,083
Go! - Ok. 

1332
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:19,041
Hello! - Alia, did you get my sms? 

1333
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:22,791
I did! - And my gift too! - Yes. 

1334
01:32:23,041 --> 01:32:25,416
You know, whenever I think about you.. 

1335
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,583
..you are dressed in these clothes! 

1336
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,875
I want to take you around the whole world in these clothes! 

1337
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:34,583
I want to take you home in these clothes! 

1338
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:37,125
Of course! Surely! 

1339
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,208
Right now, I am coming to meet you. 

1340
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:45,083
Well done, Alia! Beat him black and blue! 

1341
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:48,250
Rocky, how dare you send me such a cheap sms? 

1342
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,708
Really! Show me! 

1343
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,958
Such a cheap sms! 

1344
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:56,791
And the clothes he had sent, that were even more disgusting. 

1345
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:57,958
Shall I show you that! 

1346
01:32:58,416 --> 01:32:59,625
I had sent love! 

1347
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:00,916
And not lust! 

1348
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,208
Oh yes! This is not an sms but a letter.. 

1349
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,500
..which was switched! 

1350
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:06,750
I swear, Alia, I can't understand anything! 

1351
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:08,250
I thought so high of you, Rocky.. 

1352
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,458
..but you turned out to be completely the opposite! 

1353
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:11,875
You know, Alia used to praise you so much! 

1354
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:14,750
But you turned out to be such a cheap, dirty man! 

1355
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:16,625
You chameleon! 

1356
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:18,416
I know Alia is very upset with you! 

1357
01:33:18,708 --> 01:33:20,250
Never show your face again to her! 

1358
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,291
Because she won't see it! - No I won't! 

1359
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,250
Just because you are a friend, I will forgive you! 

1360
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:25,958
Never talk to me again! 

1361
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:27,166
You chameleon! 

1362
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:29,125
I had sent her a marriage dress! 

1363
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:30,291
Not a bikini! 

1364
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,833
Do one thing, send her a bikini this time! 

1365
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,208
This love changed to lust! 

1366
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:38,291
Do you have to do something with it? - No, no. 

1367
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:43,916
Only me, I am completely involved in it. Leave my hand! 

1368
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,041
Take my advice, take an off for 30-40 years! 

1369
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,375
Stay at home at and think about it! 

1370
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:53,333
But never show your face to Alia again! Understood! 

1371
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,750
"Oh God." 

1372
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:57,166
Fine sister, we are leaving again! 

1373
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,833
Greeting. But you didn't have anything! 

1374
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:00,458
Today is our fast! 

1375
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,333
You have arrived at the right time son. 

1376
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:05,333
They have come for Madhu's alliance! 

1377
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:07,625
Greeting. Greeting. Yes, yes. - This is my son, Arun! 

1378
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,333
Who doesn't know him? 

1379
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,583
He is a star! 

1380
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:13,083
How did you find my sister? 

1381
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:17,125
That.. - We will revert to you after sometime. - Yes! 

1382
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,125
Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye! Goodbye! 

1383
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,000
Goodbye! - Goodbye! 

1384
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:24,208
You don't worry this time! 

1385
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,458
They will definitely say yes this time. 

1386
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:28,500
They won't revert back to us, they have thought about it! 

1387
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,833
That he will marry any girl in the world, but not her! 

1388
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,083
Where are you going? 

1389
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:44,875
If my face is ugly! It has so many marks! 

1390
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,125
Then what is my fault in it! 

1391
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:51,333
Come with me! I will turn you into a fairy! 

1392
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:52,916
See there, the star is taking his sister.. 

1393
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,708
..to turn her into a fairy! 

1394
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:56,375
Just a minute, Mr. Star! 

1395
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:59,125
Tell me, which factory are you taking your sister.. 

1396
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:01,666
..to turn her into a fairy! 

1397
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,458
Come on, speak up. Speak up! 

1398
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:08,333
What are you staring at? 

1399
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:12,000
"Oh God." 

1400
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,250
What happened? 

1401
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,500
Shall I bring water? 

1402
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:18,916
Tea! 

1403
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,166
What has happened? Chavanprash! 

1404
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:24,208
Tell me, what has happened to you! 

1405
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:27,958
Come.. - Hello. 

1406
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:30,375
Yes please, what do you want to do? 

1407
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,333
I want to get her a full change of look! 

1408
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:34,750
From the colour of the hair to scars on her face. 

1409
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:37,083
Full denting, painting and scrubbing! 

1410
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:39,166
Look, these are natural marks! 

1411
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:41,000
Only God can cure them! 

1412
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:43,958
God! - We will do as much as we can! 

1413
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:45,125
No problem! 

1414
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:51,500
"Happiness, I can see that you believe." 

1415
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:58,416
"Yes, I know you can see what I can be." 

1416
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:01,125
"Once you know and I know.." 

1417
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,291
.."..you will change forever." 

1418
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:21,583
What a girl! 

1419
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:24,708
Where did this damsel come from? 

1420
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:35,666
I have to entice her now. 

1421
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,958
Get lost! - AP 

1422
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,166
AP! 

1423
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,833
C'mon! - Brother! Greeting, how are you? 

1424
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,583
Hey, today you are talking very sweetly! 

1425
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:55,250
Come, let us have tea! 

1426
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:56,583
You never come! 

1427
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,208
Bring her along too! Who is she? 

1428
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:01,166
My sister, Madhu! - Madhu! 

1429
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:04,541
Earlier she looked so ugly, and now she looks so great! 

1430
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:07,041
Come brother, let us have tea! Please! - Hey! 

1431
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,875
And whom are you looking towards? - Oh no! - Whom are you talking to? 

1432
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:11,916
Do you want a beating? Do you want to get beaten up? 

1433
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,166
Talk sweetly today! 

1434
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,333
Hi AP! 

1435
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:17,000
Who is she? - She is Madhu! 

1436
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:20,000
Wow Maddy, you are looking gorgeous! Thank you! 

1437
01:37:20,041 --> 01:37:21,333
You didn't go to Saudi! 

1438
01:37:21,416 --> 01:37:23,875
I have to go.. but mother was saying that.. 

1439
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,291
..I should first get married and then leave! 

1440
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:30,875
Just think, the girl I will marry she will be so fortunate! - Yes. 

1441
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:32,458
I wear so much of gold. 

1442
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,750
Just think how much gold I will give her! 

1443
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:35,458
I have found a girl for you! Look! 

1444
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:39,416
You wash it and she will sweep! Nice couple, isn't it? 

1445
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,041
Brother, she is from our neighbourhood! 

1446
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:42,375
She will get married in our neighbourhood! 

1447
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:43,750
And she will stay in our neighbourhood! 

1448
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,833
She can meet her mother whenever she wants! 

1449
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:47,958
She can meet her father! Meet her brother! 

1450
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,791
Come here, come here! - Yes brother! Give me order! 

1451
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:56,791
Take this. - Mother. 

1452
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:58,208
Did you recognise her? 

1453
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,041
Hey, Madhu. - Dear. - Mother. 

1454
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:07,666
My daughter has really become a fairy! 

1455
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:10,000
May no one cast an evil eye on her! 

1456
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:11,583
The entire city has! 

1457
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,000
Keep her at home! 

1458
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:16,208
Or else I will have to thrash the entire neighbourhood! 

1459
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,666
She is looking so beautiful. - Father! 

1460
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,750
Mother! 

1461
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,958
What are you doing here? 

1462
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:29,333
Why? - What happened? 

1463
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,750
You were getting very angry in the neighbourhood outside! 

1464
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,125
Someone was staring at my sister! 

1465
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,041
Won't the brother get angry? 

1466
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:38,000
You humans are very unthankful! 

1467
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:40,333
What? - Yes! 

1468
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:42,250
When nobody looked at your sister.. 

1469
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:43,416
..you were angry then! 

1470
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,375
Now that the entire city is looking at her, you are worried again! 

1471
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:48,000
Look! Look! 

1472
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,125
Mischievous! 

1473
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,666
Why do you give birth to such a mischievous person? 

1474
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:55,000
I made him a human! 

1475
01:38:55,041 --> 01:38:57,166
Now he became mischievous here on earth then what can I do? 

1476
01:38:57,583 --> 01:39:00,916
Hey! What are you doing here? 

1477
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:03,250
Changing the bulb? - No, no. 

1478
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:04,666
Have you come to measure the pole? 

1479
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:07,500
Then? 

1480
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,208
I have come to see your sister, you fool! 

1481
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:15,291
Sorry boss! 

1482
01:39:24,791 --> 01:39:26,625
Please, have it, Simba. 

1483
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,416
I've brought your favorite biscuit. 

1484
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,541
O God! I wish you would have made me a dog! Then.. 

1485
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:36,791
Second hero's entry. 

1486
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:40,666
O wow! He has arrived 15 minutes earlier! 

1487
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,875
Baba! - Come. 

1488
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:45,416
Didn't you take a bath since childhood? 

1489
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,250
I had taken a bath, I just don't remember! 

1490
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:49,291
I will have to endure even this for you! - What? 

1491
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:52,166
Baba, yesterday she got angry with me! - Yes. 

1492
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,875
So I want appease her! - That's very nice! 

1493
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:56,916
So when she arrives, then sing a romantic song! Sure, I will! 

1494
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,666
Here is the money! - Yes, I will sing! 

1495
01:39:58,750 --> 01:39:59,916
Tell me, which song! 

1496
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:02,041
Until when will you hide your youth.. something.. 

1497
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:03,166
Fine, I will sing it! - Okay! 

1498
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,750
But I can't remember it! Sing it for me. 

1499
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,000
You! - Please.. 

1500
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:09,791
"Until when will you hide your youth?" 

1501
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,791
"Until when will you hide your youth?" 

1502
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:16,250
"How much will you trouble us bachelors?" 

1503
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:20,708
"Someday you will become someone's bride!" 

1504
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,958
"Will you marry me?" - "Will you marry me?" 

1505
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:26,041
"Will you marry me?" - Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! 

1506
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:28,791
Nadeem-Shravan! Sajid-Wajid! On screen! 

1507
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,458
And your team on the streets! 

1508
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:36,458
After being so slandered, this is what a man should do! 

1509
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:40,791
And.. what a life partner you have chosen! 

1510
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:44,000
But.. - He is not my life partner! 

1511
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:46,083
She is my partner! 

1512
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:48,000
Alia.. my life partner! 

1513
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:50,791
You know, you are very shameless! 

1514
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:53,166
After what she did with you yesterday.. 

1515
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:55,958
..if it would have been someone else.. - Then! 

1516
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,125
Left the job! - Yes. - Taken a flight back! - Yes! 

1517
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,041
Hidden my face! - Yes! 

1518
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:08,625
AP, I am a very sadist, foolish, pervert type of a man! 

1519
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:11,208
Stay like this! 

1520
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:13,083
And she will be mine! 

1521
01:41:13,166 --> 01:41:14,791
If she really belonged to me.. 

1522
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:18,083
..then by now she would have been in your house! 

1523
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:21,708
God has sent me from London.. 

1524
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:23,041
..to shower my love on her. 

1525
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:25,500
Right! - So let's go along with God! 

1526
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,666
"O God!" - Why are you laughing? 

1527
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:33,041
Because God has already decided! 

1528
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,750
Come. - Come, dear. 

1529
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:39,375
Hey, I got humiliated waiting for you. 

1530
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:41,416
Rocky, what are you doing? - I didn't do anything! 

1531
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,875
Please, don't worry. I will explain everything to you on the way! 

1532
01:41:44,125 --> 01:41:45,833
I don't want to hear anything. Let's go AP. 

1533
01:41:45,916 --> 01:41:47,875
"O God!" 

1534
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,333
Stepney! 

1535
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:55,291
I have a Stepney! Just a minute! 

1536
01:41:55,375 --> 01:42:00,416
Come on, change it. - "Oh God." 

1537
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,000
"Oh God." 

1538
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:07,666
Shut up! - "You will marry me!" 

1539
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,541
Hey! - You asked me to sing! 

1540
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:12,083
Look Mr. Chandani. - Yes, sir. 

1541
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:15,125
I don't go to any program! 

1542
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:17,708
But, do you know why I have come here? - Why sir? 

1543
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:19,541
Because the people will say.. 

1544
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:23,583
..that only Bholaram Saccha dared to sit in the lie detector! 

1545
01:42:23,666 --> 01:42:24,958
You are something. - You are absolutely right! 

1546
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:26,708
And you know what that will mean! - I don't know, sir. 

1547
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:31,166
And that will mean, that there is no other true and honest.. 

1548
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:34,416
..politician like me in the world! - No sir. - How nice! 

1549
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,041
But ask only those questions which I have written down! - Yes sir! 

1550
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:39,875
Yes sir, I have reminded Rocky of all your questions! 

1551
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,083
Ladies and gentlemen! 

1552
01:42:48,291 --> 01:42:51,458
Welcome to the first episode of "Liar, liar pants on fire." 

1553
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,166
Friends, your host Rocky! 

1554
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,416
And this is the chair. 

1555
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:59,000
Meaning the machine which catches your lie. 

1556
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:01,208
And today our state's Chief Minister.. 

1557
01:43:01,291 --> 01:43:05,250
..Mr. Bholaram Saccha will dare to sit on it. 

1558
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:08,958
A big round of applause to Mr. Bholaram! - Welcome, sir. 

1559
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:10,666
Greetings. Thank you. 

1560
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:13,125
You had thrown me out of my shows. 

1561
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:15,041
Look, now how I get you fired. 

1562
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:18,083
You will say what I will make you say. 

1563
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,000
Bholaram! 

1564
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:25,666
Let me tell the audience that the questions which I will ask you.. 

1565
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,625
..you have given me those questions beforehand. 

1566
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,708
Say yes or no! 

1567
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:37,291
No! The red light is blinking! 

1568
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:39,666
He is lying. 

1569
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:43,125
Look, our country's famous minister.. 

1570
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:49,833
..must have killed so many people to roam in cars! - What?! 

1571
01:43:52,416 --> 01:43:54,250
What nonsense! 

1572
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:57,708
Sir, I don't know what I am saying! Sorry, sir! 

1573
01:43:57,791 --> 01:44:00,166
Good. - Why should I say sorry? 

1574
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:04,375
Fatso! Hippopotamus! 

1575
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:07,791
Your name is Bhola! But you are a troublesome man! 

1576
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,833
Is he mad? - I won't spare you! 

1577
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:12,041
"Oh God." - I will lock you in prison! 

1578
01:44:12,541 --> 01:44:13,916
You will rot in mental asylum! 

1579
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,541
What will you do, stupid! 

1580
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:18,583
Alia! We will have to stop him! 

1581
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:21,000
I will throw rotten eggs on you! 

1582
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:23,333
And I won't miss a single target! - Rocky! 

1583
01:44:23,416 --> 01:44:25,416
Are you mad? Are you nuts! 

1584
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,333
What has happened to you! - Sir! - What are you doing? 

1585
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:30,375
I don't know what I'm saying all this. 

1586
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:31,916
Okay, no problems. Apologize to him! 

1587
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,541
Shut up! You lizard! Remember the bikini! 

1588
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:37,083
I will make you wear it and make you.. 

1589
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:39,458
..dance in front of everybody! - Rocky! Rocky! 

1590
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:41,500
So many people are here! Please think of that! 

1591
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:44,458
People! They are transvestites who just clap! Transvestites! 

1592
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:47,166
What is he saying? 

1593
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,791
Rocky, have you gone insane. 

1594
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:52,416
Please! Please! Please! Security! - 'Leave me!' 

1595
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,041
This guy insulted me. I tolerated it. 

1596
01:44:55,333 --> 01:44:58,041
But I can't tolerate people's humiliation. 

1597
01:44:58,625 --> 01:44:59,833
Red light! 

1598
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:02,000
Rocky, are you out of your mind? - He is lying. - Leave me! 

1599
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:04,916
What nonsense! - Stand there! 

1600
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:09,208
Minister, I know you want.. to send me to prison! 

1601
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:11,041
And you want to fire me! - No! 

1602
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:14,125
And lizard! I know you hate me! 

1603
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:18,666
And transvestites, I even know that you people will bash me! 

1604
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:21,791
So forget this job, I am leaving this city! 

1605
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:23,208
You can even leave this world! 

1606
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:24,875
Rocky, what are you doing? 

1607
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:27,125
Take this! - Rocky, please. 

1608
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:32,208
"Oh God." 

1609
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,791
What has happened! How did it happen? 

1610
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,708
How did I do all this? 

1611
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:40,000
This.. - No, no! His skin is very dark! 

1612
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,958
O my God! Earlier guys used to reject you! 

1613
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,000
And now you reject guys! 

1614
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:47,875
You are fortunate! 

1615
01:45:47,958 --> 01:45:51,625
Now, you go and finish your work. - Here, massage it. 

1616
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:54,208
Did you take your medicine? 

1617
01:45:58,166 --> 01:46:00,166
What do you want? You want water? 

1618
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,708
Coffee? 

1619
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:04,708
Then? What do you want? 

1620
01:46:05,166 --> 01:46:07,250
Son, hang on. 

1621
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,250
Yes, mother. - Son, look at your father's state. 

1622
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,583
He can't speak. 

1623
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:19,291
Son, he is really worried. Show him to some doctor. 

1624
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,791
Mother, since the time he has stopped talking.. 

1625
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,750
..there is so much peace in this house. 

1626
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:25,041
You should be happy. 

1627
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:26,541
What are you saying, son? 

1628
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:29,541
Now I am used to his cribbing. 

1629
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:32,375
Now if he doesn't talk then I feel bad. 

1630
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:34,666
Show him to a doctor. Yes. 

1631
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:42,541
'Father must be abusing me a lot.' 

1632
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:44,916
'In the old age, a person lives for his children's happiness.' 

1633
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,416
'My son has become a star.' 

1634
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,833
'My daughter is receiving good alliances.' 

1635
01:46:47,916 --> 01:46:49,750
'I don't have any worries even if I die tomorrow.' 

1636
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:52,916
Wow! Father is so nice! 

1637
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:55,458
His voice should be returned. 

1638
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:03,416
I will be liberated! 

1639
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:09,916
Hey! - HP! MP! 

1640
01:47:12,416 --> 01:47:15,000
People! I have got my voice back! 

1641
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:18,291
You must be sad that I got my voice back! 

1642
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,458
You got your voice back! And I got my show! 

1643
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:23,833
It will go back! It's just temporary! - Thank God. 

1644
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:25,833
People! - Truly, son? - Yes! 

1645
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:27,833
What are you waiting for? 

1646
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:30,125
Everything is going right nowadays. 

1647
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:33,916
Now go and tell Alia that you love her. 

1648
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,250
Hello! - Hello, Alia! - Hi, AP! 

1649
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:44,250
Alia, counting from tomorrow, 28 years ago I had taken birth.. 

1650
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:47,291
..and I had done a favour on this earth and humanity. 

1651
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,958
Won't you meet me tomorrow to thank me for this favour? 

1652
01:47:53,125 --> 01:47:54,291
Where? 

1653
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:58,916
Hyatt! 18th floor. 1801! 

1654
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:03,833
Alia. 

1655
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,125
Come inside. 

1656
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:47,958
"I've been waiting for you. I've been looking for you." 

1657
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:59,000
"I had seen you in my dreams, beloved." 

1658
01:48:59,875 --> 01:49:08,083
"I had seen you in my dreams, beloved." 

1659
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:17,750
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 

1660
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:19,875
"I have been just waiting for you!" 

1661
01:49:19,958 --> 01:49:22,250
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1662
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:24,625
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1663
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:27,000
"Hold me. Just hold me, beloved." 

1664
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:30,000
"Just hold me, beloved." 

1665
01:49:38,166 --> 01:49:42,041
"I have been waiting.. waiting for you, girl." 

1666
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:47,000
"I have been waiting, waiting, waiting for you, girl." 

1667
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:52,333
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1668
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:55,750
"I have to express my feelings." 

1669
01:49:56,166 --> 01:50:02,166
"Hear it, beloved." "Hear it, beloved." 

1670
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:06,791
"My heart has been affected." 

1671
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,583
"How did it happen? I don't know." 

1672
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:17,250
"Never before had it beaten like this." 

1673
01:50:21,083 --> 01:50:25,166
"Let me do what my heart says." 

1674
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:29,791
"Let me make some mistake." 

1675
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:37,583
"My heart is just yours." 

1676
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:46,791
"You have struck the chords of my heart, beloved." 

1677
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:48,125
"O baby!" 

1678
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:56,791
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 

1679
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:58,625
"I have been just waiting for you!" 

1680
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:03,333
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1681
01:51:03,416 --> 01:51:08,125
"Love me. Just love me, beloved." 

1682
01:51:36,333 --> 01:51:45,000
"When I see your face I feel." 

1683
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:51,375
"The moon dwells beneath dark tresses." 

1684
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:59,125
"The intoxication of your talks." 

1685
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,666
"Have influenced me." 

1686
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:12,041
"How do I believe in your love?" 

1687
01:52:12,583 --> 01:52:21,333
"With your eyes, read my eyes, beloved." 

1688
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:30,458
"My heart says, embrace me, beloved." 

1689
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,791
"I have been just waiting for you!" 

1690
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:37,500
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1691
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:40,416
"Tell me. Just tell me, beloved." 

1692
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,208
"I have been just waiting for you!" 

1693
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:46,916
"Beloved, I am crazy for you." 

1694
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:54,875
"Love me. Just love me, beloved." 

1695
01:53:11,166 --> 01:53:12,333
You! 

1696
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:14,375
You behave so foolishly! 

1697
01:53:14,666 --> 01:53:16,375
What? - Cities are flooded! 

1698
01:53:16,458 --> 01:53:18,041
Countless people die! Do you know? 

1699
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:20,083
Hang on! Hang on! What did I do? 

1700
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:23,166
You know! For the past hours hours I was with Alia! 

1701
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:25,458
You changed the position of the moon. 

1702
01:53:25,916 --> 01:53:27,125
The sea level increased. 

1703
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:29,958
If I had not interfered then the entire city would have been flooded! 

1704
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:32,833
Sorry! I didn't know! 

1705
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:35,250
You should never play with nature. 

1706
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,875
As it is, because of you people, pollution has increased so much. 

1707
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:40,000
When I look from above, I can't see the world. 

1708
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,166
What have you done to the moon? 

1709
01:53:45,541 --> 01:53:47,125
The colour has totally changed. 

1710
01:53:47,833 --> 01:53:50,375
This is not the moon. - Then? 

1711
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:52,708
It's the world. - World? 

1712
01:53:57,166 --> 01:54:00,291
So where is the moon? - You are standing on it. 

1713
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:10,625
Unbelievable! The moon looks like Ladakh. 

1714
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:14,208
You saw the moon, dear. Now tell me. 

1715
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:15,541
What have you done till date? 

1716
01:54:15,625 --> 01:54:17,416
I didn't do anything. 

1717
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:19,666
Number one, I have become a star. 

1718
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:23,916
Rocky has been fired. Alia has started loving me. 

1719
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,708
My sister has become the most beautiful girl in the city! 

1720
01:54:26,791 --> 01:54:29,625
And she is receiving such good alliances, I can't tell you! 

1721
01:54:29,708 --> 01:54:31,708
My life is perfect! I am really happy! 

1722
01:54:31,958 --> 01:54:34,083
You did all this for yourself. - Yes. 

1723
01:54:34,458 --> 01:54:36,083
That day you were telling me about the world's sorrow. 

1724
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:37,500
What did you do for the world? 

1725
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:39,250
You forgot the world when you received the power! 

1726
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:43,000
Frankly speaking God, I didn't get the time. 

1727
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:45,916
But from tomorrow, I promise! I will do many things. 

1728
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,791
Tomorrow is your last day. - What! 

1729
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:52,250
Good days pass so soon. 

1730
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:54,250
No problem. 

1731
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:56,416
A single day is enough to bless this world. 

1732
01:54:56,708 --> 01:54:58,916
After all, I am God! 

1733
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:03,125
Let's see! 

1734
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:05,333
The task which I couldn't do in a millions of years.. 

1735
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:07,291
..how will you do that in a single day! 

1736
01:55:09,375 --> 01:55:13,416
Sir! Wait. Today my lottery's result will be declared! 

1737
01:55:13,625 --> 01:55:15,958
Pray to God that I win the lottery! 

1738
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:19,541
I guarantee you! Today you will win the lottery! 

1739
01:55:19,625 --> 01:55:21,166
Hi Alia! - Hi. - Hi AP. - Hi. 

1740
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,708
What happened to you? Why are you crying? 

1741
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:27,333
You said you were going to get me a motorcycle but.. 

1742
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:30,875
Don't cry. You will get it! 

1743
01:55:30,958 --> 01:55:32,958
By God! - By God! Now leave! 

1744
01:55:36,125 --> 01:55:40,833
In this world.. whatever you want.. 

1745
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:43,875
..tell me! Tell me! 

1746
01:55:43,958 --> 01:55:46,250
'God, my husband drinks too much.' - What? 

1747
01:55:47,041 --> 01:55:48,750
What? What? 

1748
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:53,916
Patience! Slow down! Slowly! - Hey, God, my.. - What? 

1749
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,500
What happened to my.. - What? - My God.. 

1750
01:56:02,708 --> 01:56:05,375
What are you asking for, I don't understand anything. 

1751
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:07,041
Hey stop. 

1752
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:29,125
Enough! Stop! Silence! Silence! 

1753
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:38,416
In this world people don't have any other work besides asking! 

1754
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:42,625
My children, I don't understand anything. 

1755
01:56:43,083 --> 01:56:46,958
Please say it one by one. What do you want? - Madhuri Dixit. 

1756
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:51,083
Somebody else's wife! Is this something to ask for? 

1757
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:53,458
You tell me! - 'Oh God, make me a dog.' 

1758
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:54,708
Hang on! One second! 

1759
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,375
One by one! One by one! One by one! 

1760
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,708
I don't have time to hear all that! 

1761
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:06,500
In this world people should get whatever they want.. 

1762
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:11,666
..what can be better than this? 

1763
01:57:12,166 --> 01:57:14,833
My happiness lies in their happiness. 

1764
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:19,666
So I accept everybody's wishes! 

1765
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:24,625
I accept it! I accept it! 

1766
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:38,208
You have blessed this world! 

1767
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:39,833
Sir! - Yes! 

1768
01:57:39,916 --> 01:57:41,708
God heard your prayer! - Yes! 

1769
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:44,583
Look, sir gave me the bike's key. - Is that so? 

1770
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:46,083
Now give a ride to your children. 

1771
01:57:46,166 --> 01:57:49,333
And listen, bring sweets on your way back. - Yes! Yes! 

1772
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:55,083
Saw that! Solace! Contentment! 

1773
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,208
Satisfaction! 

1774
01:57:58,208 --> 01:58:00,541
What will you understand? 

1775
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,125
God bless you! 

1776
01:58:03,416 --> 01:58:05,000
Today you came to meet us. 

1777
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:07,250
Now quickly come in this house forever. 

1778
01:58:07,833 --> 01:58:11,291
Listen, she is my sister. She is elder to you. 

1779
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:13,458
Her name is MP. Touch her feet. 

1780
01:58:13,541 --> 01:58:17,041
You made her touch your mother's feet, your sister's feet! 

1781
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:19,833
Now make her touch the neighbour's feet! 

1782
01:58:19,916 --> 01:58:21,666
But don't make her touch your father's feet! 

1783
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,333
Have patience! Have patience! She will touch it! 

1784
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:25,333
He is my father, touch his feet. 

1785
01:58:25,708 --> 01:58:28,000
God bless you! Hang on! 

1786
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:31,708
May God make you both stars of channel! 

1787
01:58:31,791 --> 01:58:34,083
If there is any problem, come to me! 

1788
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:35,875
I still have contacts in municipality! 

1789
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:38,125
I will get you a job there! Okay! 

1790
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:42,250
Look at this! - Dear, this is the wedding veil for you. 

1791
01:58:42,541 --> 01:58:47,500
Wear it on the wedding day. God will bless both of you. 

1792
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:49,000
Madam! - Look! 

1793
01:58:49,041 --> 01:58:50,875
Gangu.. - Madam! - Where were you? 

1794
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:52,583
You are missing for the past 4 hours! 

1795
01:58:52,666 --> 01:58:54,916
Do you know? Today my future daughter-in-law has come home! 

1796
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,333
Look at the way she has got decked up. 

1797
01:58:56,416 --> 01:59:01,333
My God! Junior madam is so beautiful! 

1798
01:59:01,416 --> 01:59:04,083
Sir, you said that about my lottery. 

1799
01:59:04,166 --> 01:59:09,166
I won 2 crores lottery! 2 crores! - No! 

1800
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:11,833
From tomorrow, I won't come for work! 

1801
01:59:11,916 --> 01:59:14,708
Yes! I am going to Juhu to see a house! 

1802
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:17,416
I will buy a car! 

1803
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,875
My child will go to convent school! 

1804
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:22,208
And I will give him foreign brand liquor! Dagdu! 

1805
01:59:22,291 --> 01:59:25,250
What do you say, Dagdu? 

1806
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:28,375
If I invite you people to my new house for lunch.. 

1807
01:59:28,458 --> 01:59:31,083
..then will you all come? - No! 

1808
01:59:31,166 --> 01:59:33,291
We will come, Gangubai! We will surely come! 

1809
01:59:33,375 --> 01:59:36,750
Fine! Now I will leave! I have so much work to do! Fine! 

1810
01:59:37,375 --> 01:59:43,000
Listen! If you keep a new maid then find one for me too! 

1811
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:45,916
What is she saying? - Dagdu, wait. - Saw that, son? 

1812
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,875
For years we were craving for our wealth! 

1813
01:59:48,958 --> 01:59:51,916
She found her wealth! And I got mine! 

1814
02:00:01,875 --> 02:00:04,041
"The moon is hiding." 

1815
02:00:04,125 --> 02:00:06,250
"The stars feel shy." 

1816
02:00:06,333 --> 02:00:10,708
"Look at the damsel's face." 

1817
02:00:10,791 --> 02:00:12,916
"The sky bowed down." 

1818
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,125
"Time came to a standstill." 

1819
02:00:15,208 --> 02:00:19,541
"Look at the damsel's face." 

1820
02:00:28,833 --> 02:00:37,375
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 

1821
02:00:37,791 --> 02:00:46,375
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 

1822
02:00:46,708 --> 02:00:55,458
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 

1823
02:00:55,541 --> 02:01:04,041
"My beloved too says that I have become useless." 

1824
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:12,708
"Since the time you wore the red veil of your beloved." 

1825
02:01:13,166 --> 02:01:22,125
"Since the time you wore the red veil of your beloved." 

1826
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:30,791
"Your beloved too says that take it in your name." 

1827
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:40,125
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 

1828
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:04,041
"I paid a heavy price for falling in love." 

1829
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:08,750
"Friend, I couldn't make any excuse." 

1830
02:02:08,833 --> 02:02:12,875
"The bangle says. The bracelet says." 

1831
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:17,583
"You have to go to your beloved's house." 

1832
02:02:17,666 --> 02:02:26,625
"Beloved, now who cares about the outcome of love?" 

1833
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:35,041
"Your beloved too says that take it in your name." 

1834
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:44,583
"Since the time I wore the red veil of my beloved." 

1835
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:15,125
"Henna is being applied on the damsel's hands." 

1836
02:03:15,208 --> 02:03:19,625
"Bride looks so beautiful." 

1837
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:24,041
"Moon is the guest.. stars are the guest.." 

1838
02:03:24,083 --> 02:03:28,833
"We have become companions for life!" 

1839
02:03:28,916 --> 02:03:37,791
"Now my days are fortunate!" 

1840
02:03:37,875 --> 02:03:46,375
"My darling has started saying, I have turned useless!" 

1841
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:55,375
"Since you have immersed in the colour of the beloved!" 

1842
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,625
You are feeling bad about going back! 

1843
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:24,625
Yes! I am feeling bad! 

1844
02:04:24,875 --> 02:04:26,166
It was good power. 

1845
02:04:27,041 --> 02:04:28,333
But no matter! 

1846
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:30,916
I have done my work in 10 days! 

1847
02:04:31,333 --> 02:04:32,958
Just wait for tomorrow! 

1848
02:04:33,166 --> 02:04:35,250
Tomorrow will be a unique day! 

1849
02:04:35,833 --> 02:04:39,208
From tomorrow, no one will be sad, worried! 

1850
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:41,791
Because tomorrow, everyone will have everything.. 

1851
02:04:41,875 --> 02:04:43,375
..and everyone will be very happy! 

1852
02:04:44,291 --> 02:04:45,958
And they will thank only you! 

1853
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,875
Because only you get the credit! 

1854
02:04:49,666 --> 02:04:52,208
Fine! I will see it too! 

1855
02:04:52,958 --> 02:04:54,875
What tomorrow brings to the world! 

1856
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:04,375
Hey! Stay quiet. Don't shout. 

1857
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:08,000
What are you doing? 

1858
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:09,416
He has turned into a dog, sir! 

1859
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:10,958
He has bitten four people since morning! 

1860
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:12,500
We are taking him to the mental asylum! 

1861
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:14,041
Come on, lift it. 

1862
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:18,875
Dajju! Dajju! 

1863
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,333
It's me, AP! 

1864
02:05:25,416 --> 02:05:26,583
Pick him up! 

1865
02:05:26,666 --> 02:05:28,333
Careful. Careful. 

1866
02:05:28,416 --> 02:05:32,083
Move back! Move back! Move back! 

1867
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:37,041
What have you done, AP? 

1868
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,750
You've ruined him by accepting his prayers. 

1869
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:45,875
Alia, thank God. Sorry. 

1870
02:05:45,958 --> 02:05:47,166
I know it was so important. 

1871
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:49,666
Manoj.. 

1872
02:05:49,916 --> 02:05:52,041
Has Alia arrived! - No, she still hasn't come! 

1873
02:05:52,083 --> 02:05:55,125
She isn't at home. She isn't here. Then where did she go? 

1874
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:57,375
AP, you know what has happened? 

1875
02:05:57,458 --> 02:05:59,000
An explosion! 

1876
02:05:59,041 --> 02:06:02,041
The boss has thrown Chandani out.. 

1877
02:06:02,625 --> 02:06:06,541
..and now his secretary Rajesh has become the boss! 

1878
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:09,291
I know that fool very well! 

1879
02:06:09,666 --> 02:06:12,541
He would always wish to God to make him the boss! 

1880
02:06:12,625 --> 02:06:14,833
And there, God heeded to him! 

1881
02:06:14,916 --> 02:06:16,583
The fool became the boss! 

1882
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,333
I cannot understand anything! 

1883
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:22,500
Oh, so you are saying my dialogue to me! 

1884
02:06:22,583 --> 02:06:25,041
No! There is no need to understand anything! 

1885
02:06:25,083 --> 02:06:26,375
Know only one thing! 

1886
02:06:26,458 --> 02:06:28,583
I am the boss here now, and you.. 

1887
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:33,875
You are nothing here now! 

1888
02:06:33,958 --> 02:06:35,500
Has this happened because of me! 

1889
02:06:35,583 --> 02:06:37,041
No! No chance! 

1890
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:39,166
What? - When did this happen? 

1891
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:41,125
Oh! Oh! 

1892
02:06:41,833 --> 02:06:43,000
What happened? 

1893
02:06:43,041 --> 02:06:44,791
That Murari! - Yes! 

1894
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:46,375
The boss gave him a bike yesterday! - Yes! 

1895
02:06:46,458 --> 02:06:48,541
On that happy note, he was driving the bike drunk.. 

1896
02:06:48,625 --> 02:06:49,875
..and that too without a license! 

1897
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:51,875
An old man came in front of him and.. 

1898
02:06:52,125 --> 02:06:54,125
The old man died and Murari was jailed! 

1899
02:06:54,375 --> 02:06:55,833
He will be sentenced for life! 

1900
02:06:55,916 --> 02:06:58,000
God is so strange! 

1901
02:06:58,041 --> 02:06:59,750
He was happy without the bike! 

1902
02:06:59,833 --> 02:07:01,666
Now that He wanted to get someone killed by him.. 

1903
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:06,833
I didn't think trying to do good for one will be bad for the other. 

1904
02:07:08,166 --> 02:07:09,708
If one or two have become bad.. 

1905
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,041
..then at least the whole world should get their wishes. 

1906
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:14,791
Monty, I can't believe this. - What happened? 

1907
02:07:14,875 --> 02:07:17,125
AP, all the horses won in the racecourse. 

1908
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:18,541
What?! 

1909
02:07:18,625 --> 02:07:20,333
Oh, no! - What happened? 

1910
02:07:20,416 --> 02:07:23,125
AP, all the students have stood first in the examination! 

1911
02:07:23,208 --> 02:07:24,791
There is a uproar in the college for admission! 

1912
02:07:24,875 --> 02:07:28,083
And the college principal has locked himself in the bathroom! 

1913
02:07:32,583 --> 02:07:34,875
Let's go to Thane. - What happened now? Where are you all going? 

1914
02:07:34,958 --> 02:07:36,291
The government has given the order.. 

1915
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:37,666
..to release all the prisoners! 

1916
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:39,750
Don't know what all crimes they will do. 

1917
02:07:39,833 --> 02:07:42,041
Hurry up! - It's happened because of me! 

1918
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:51,708
Yes, mother! - Son, there is a very big problem! 

1919
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:53,125
What happened? 

1920
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:55,208
Come home quickly, then I will tell you! 

1921
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:57,208
You are needlessly giving me a heart attack! 

1922
02:07:57,291 --> 02:07:58,708
Its urgent. - Fine, I am coming! 

1923
02:07:58,791 --> 02:08:02,541
I am ruined. 

1924
02:08:04,333 --> 02:08:07,583
What had I done to you, that you did this to me! 

1925
02:08:07,666 --> 02:08:09,958
Why did you do this with me? 

1926
02:08:10,166 --> 02:08:14,625
Why did you do it, sir? 

1927
02:08:14,708 --> 02:08:16,333
What has happened to you? Why are you crying? 

1928
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:19,791
I am ruined, sir! 

1929
02:08:19,875 --> 02:08:22,041
Gangubai, yesterday you won a lottery worth two crores! 

1930
02:08:22,125 --> 02:08:25,000
He ran away with all of it, the fool! - Who? 

1931
02:08:25,041 --> 02:08:27,541
My husband, Dagdu! - Dagdu! 

1932
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:30,416
He ran away with the money.. 

1933
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,333
..and my neighbour, the vegetable seller! 

1934
02:08:32,708 --> 02:08:35,500
What about my children now, sir? 

1935
02:08:35,583 --> 02:08:38,583
What about my children now? 

1936
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:42,958
O Lord, I was better of without the money! 

1937
02:08:43,375 --> 02:08:47,541
Why did you give me the money? Why? 

1938
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:49,625
Chaos! 

1939
02:08:49,708 --> 02:08:51,125
Look what's happening in the world? 

1940
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:52,583
There is going to be chaos in the world! 

1941
02:08:52,666 --> 02:08:54,583
And it has already come in our world! - You please keep quiet. 

1942
02:08:54,666 --> 02:08:56,166
Son, a terrible thing has happened! - What happened? 

1943
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:58,000
Madhu has eloped from home.. 

1944
02:08:58,041 --> 02:08:59,500
..and she has left this letter! 

1945
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:01,333
What's written in it? - That she is getting married! 

1946
02:09:01,416 --> 02:09:03,083
She used to sit quietly in the house.. 

1947
02:09:03,166 --> 02:09:04,291
..when she was ugly! 

1948
02:09:04,375 --> 02:09:06,041
By making her beautiful, you have tarnished.. 

1949
02:09:06,125 --> 02:09:07,333
..our family honour! 

1950
02:09:07,416 --> 02:09:09,291
And she has run away! - No! 

1951
02:09:11,041 --> 02:09:12,250
Whom did you marry? 

1952
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:15,083
Me. 

1953
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:23,041
Fool, you! 

1954
02:09:23,875 --> 02:09:25,041
Behave with him! 

1955
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:27,291
He is my husband, and your brother-in-law! 

1956
02:09:27,375 --> 02:09:29,333
He won't understand anything properly! 

1957
02:09:29,416 --> 02:09:30,625
Hey! - Hey fool! 

1958
02:09:30,708 --> 02:09:32,583
You dare abuse me! - No! No! 

1959
02:09:32,666 --> 02:09:34,041
What did you do with my sister? 

1960
02:09:34,125 --> 02:09:35,500
I didn't do anything! 

1961
02:09:35,875 --> 02:09:37,083
How did she marry you? 

1962
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:39,208
She has become so gorgeous! 

1963
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:42,125
Since I have seen her, I wish for only one thing.. 

1964
02:09:42,208 --> 02:09:43,583
..that she marries me! 

1965
02:09:43,666 --> 02:09:44,791
God listened to me today! 

1966
02:09:44,875 --> 02:09:46,166
She came to me herself in the morning.. 

1967
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,958
..and said, let's get married! - So we got married! 

1968
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,583
Suicide! - Run away! 

1969
02:09:50,083 --> 02:09:51,416
Let it be, son! 

1970
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:52,791
Now they are married! 

1971
02:09:52,875 --> 02:09:54,500
The God wanted that! 

1972
02:09:54,791 --> 02:09:56,208
What can we do? 

1973
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:58,125
Mother, this is not God's wish. This is too much! 

1974
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,583
It is good that the government has forgiven you. 

1975
02:10:16,666 --> 02:10:18,750
My son came back after 25 years. 

1976
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,416
God, thank you so very much. Oh God, he escaped hanging. 

1977
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:24,250
My son has gone thin. 

1978
02:10:31,166 --> 02:10:35,375
"Thorn pricked me! Beloved, dear.." 

1979
02:10:35,458 --> 02:10:38,083
Brother, it is not good to waste money. Stop it. 

1980
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:40,750
Why isn't Alia picking her phone? 

1981
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:53,875
Latest news.. latest news! 

1982
02:10:53,958 --> 02:10:55,208
Rabri Devi became prime minister! 

1983
02:10:55,291 --> 02:10:57,333
Snowfall in Rajasthan! Storm in Kashmir! 

1984
02:10:57,416 --> 02:10:59,708
Latest news.. latest news! 

1985
02:11:02,041 --> 02:11:03,916
Hello? - Hello, AP? 

1986
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,125
Alia has called you to hotel Hyatt immediately. 

1987
02:11:06,208 --> 02:11:08,750
The whole world is in chaos and she's partying? 

1988
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:11,375
Not partying; Alia is marrying. 

1989
02:11:11,458 --> 02:11:12,541
What? 

1990
02:11:16,083 --> 02:11:18,083
Marrying; whom? 

1991
02:11:21,291 --> 02:11:22,708
Keep it down. - Yes. 

1992
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,166
'Alia?' 

1993
02:11:54,416 --> 02:11:55,625
What are you doing? 

1994
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:58,208
Wedding, marriage; with me. 

1995
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:02,416
Just yesterday you took my parents' blessing for wedding? 

1996
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,916
And today you pulled away ground beneath my feet. 

1997
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,125
I'm really sorry, AP. 

1998
02:12:07,833 --> 02:12:10,791
Rocky was even leaving the city for ever yesterday but.. 

1999
02:12:10,875 --> 02:12:13,750
And before going I thought to make a last try. 

2000
02:12:15,041 --> 02:12:17,958
I prayed to God that Alia accepts me. 

2001
02:12:18,958 --> 02:12:21,791
And yesterday when he proposed me.. 

2002
02:12:22,583 --> 02:12:24,041
..I could not refuse. 

2003
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:27,083
I'm sorry, AP. 

2004
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:30,916
You know, how upset Alia is with you? 

2005
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:33,625
If she gets married to you, she's supposed to be upset. 

2006
02:12:33,833 --> 02:12:35,291
No, not for that. 

2007
02:12:35,375 --> 02:12:37,041
But because there was nobody.. 

2008
02:12:37,125 --> 02:12:38,583
..from Alia's side in this wedding. 

2009
02:12:38,833 --> 02:12:40,208
You don't worry, Alia. 

2010
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:43,375
Older brother has come; he'll do your rituals. 

2011
02:12:43,791 --> 02:12:44,916
Shut up! 

2012
02:12:47,166 --> 02:12:48,625
Think once again, Alia. 

2013
02:12:48,916 --> 02:12:51,208
We make such a perfect couple. 

2014
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:53,541
If you want then ask anyone. - Get off! 

2015
02:12:53,625 --> 02:12:56,291
Came to my wedding and misleading my bride? 

2016
02:12:56,375 --> 02:12:58,833
Priest, get started! Come, darling. 

2017
02:12:58,916 --> 02:13:00,291
'Come.. come, Be seated.' 

2018
02:13:01,208 --> 02:13:02,375
Alia.. 

2019
02:13:06,125 --> 02:13:10,000
Loot everyone! Loot! Nobody moves from their places. 

2020
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:12,333
Remove their jewelry. Don't spare anyone. 

2021
02:13:13,291 --> 02:13:16,958
You rat, they've come, it's over; now you marry. 

2022
02:13:17,041 --> 02:13:19,250
Alia, he called these goons! 

2023
02:13:19,333 --> 02:13:21,916
Man, did any mad lizard bite me that I'll call them here! 

2024
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Don't spare anyone. You smarty! 

2025
02:13:26,125 --> 02:13:28,166
Why are you getting so scared? 

2026
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:29,958
Why fleeing leaving the task? 

2027
02:13:30,333 --> 02:13:32,625
Come on, take everyone's belongings! 

2028
02:13:32,875 --> 02:13:34,750
'And take off the jewellery of that bride!' 

2029
02:13:34,833 --> 02:13:36,833
No, boss. Here's much tension, boss! 

2030
02:13:36,916 --> 02:13:38,916
You fool, what's the tension? 

2031
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,833
Now the court has released us! Now, we rule over this place. 

2032
02:13:43,041 --> 02:13:45,541
Boss, this man does magic with his eyes. 

2033
02:13:45,625 --> 02:13:47,000
'He hits with eyes!' 

2034
02:13:47,041 --> 02:13:48,333
Who? - This.. 

2035
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,625
This fellow!? - Yes. 

2036
02:13:50,166 --> 02:13:53,125
Does magic!? He's magician!? - Yes. 

2037
02:13:53,208 --> 02:13:55,166
I'll see to him right now! 

2038
02:13:55,458 --> 02:13:57,250
Boss.. boss, be careful. 

2039
02:13:58,541 --> 02:14:01,458
I see, so you are magician? 

2040
02:14:01,958 --> 02:14:05,875
Come on show me; show me your magic quickly. 

2041
02:14:06,416 --> 02:14:10,791
Come on, hurry up; or else I'll show you my magic. 

2042
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:13,958
The bullet shot here and there ends your life. 

2043
02:14:15,666 --> 02:14:17,916
Snatched away power and started playing with me again? 

2044
02:14:18,875 --> 02:14:20,000
'History!' 

2045
02:14:20,041 --> 02:14:21,625
Beloved's wedding anniversary. 

2046
02:14:21,875 --> 02:14:23,083
And lover's death anniversary! 

2047
02:14:23,166 --> 02:14:25,041
Even Romeo was not so lucky! 

2048
02:14:25,916 --> 02:14:30,833
You want to see magic. Then shoot him. - Hey! 

2049
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,208
Because of my magic the bullet will stop.. 

2050
02:14:33,291 --> 02:14:34,666
..just one inch away from his chest. 

2051
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,166
Hey you! Neither I'm Spiderman.. 

2052
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:38,500
..nor Superman and not even Rajnikant! 

2053
02:14:38,583 --> 02:14:40,000
You'll shoot and I'll be over! 

2054
02:14:40,083 --> 02:14:42,541
That you'll come to know after shooting. You shoot! 

2055
02:14:42,625 --> 02:14:43,791
'Hey you!' 

2056
02:14:43,875 --> 02:14:46,333
Alia, look he wants to make you widow on wedding day. 

2057
02:14:46,625 --> 02:14:47,916
You don't worry for Alia. 

2058
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,666
As soon as you die, I'll make Alia a bride again. 

2059
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,791
And I promise you; on our wedding anniversary.. 

2060
02:14:53,875 --> 02:14:56,166
..we'll certainly celebrate your death anniversary. 

2061
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:58,833
What are you looking at? Shoot - Hey you! 

2062
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,750
Hey, shoot! 

2063
02:15:03,458 --> 02:15:04,791
Beat the fools! 

2064
02:15:31,458 --> 02:15:32,666
Come on! 

2065
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:36,208
Hey, where are you running? - Let go off me! 

2066
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,958
Hey, let me hit you. 

2067
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:55,125
Alia, come on, move from here. Hurry up! 

2068
02:16:01,958 --> 02:16:03,375
Hit these fools! 

2069
02:16:10,833 --> 02:16:15,500
You fool! You'll hit me? 

2070
02:16:16,458 --> 02:16:18,750
I'll kill you! 

2071
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Alia! 

2072
02:16:46,041 --> 02:16:48,333
Boss.. boss the girl is hit, boss! 

2073
02:16:48,416 --> 02:16:50,333
Let's flee from here, boss! - Yes, come. 

2074
02:17:07,041 --> 02:17:08,250
Alia.. 

2075
02:17:09,541 --> 02:17:10,666
Alia.. 

2076
02:17:20,333 --> 02:17:21,541
Alia.. 

2077
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:30,750
I will not let this happen. 

2078
02:17:31,458 --> 02:17:32,791
I will not let this happen. 

2079
02:17:34,333 --> 02:17:36,000
I will not let this happen. 

2080
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:42,583
I won't let this happen. No. 

2081
02:17:44,083 --> 02:17:47,250
No! No! 

2082
02:17:49,125 --> 02:17:51,208
No! 

2083
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:54,458
Why are you shouting at me now? 

2084
02:17:58,375 --> 02:18:01,708
Did you see, how they killed my Alia? 

2085
02:18:04,833 --> 02:18:10,041
Not those goons; you killed my Alia. 

2086
02:18:10,083 --> 02:18:13,791
Because life and death is in your hands. 

2087
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:18,875
Don't blame me now. You are responsible for Alia's death. 

2088
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:22,791
I? Will I kill Alia? 

2089
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:25,333
You accepted the prayers of the whole world. 

2090
02:18:26,041 --> 02:18:27,875
Because of that so much mess up.. 

2091
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:29,416
..and destruction is happening. 

2092
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:31,666
Because of that Alia lost her life. 

2093
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,791
I was doing well to the world. 

2094
02:18:34,166 --> 02:18:37,000
How could I know, that will become.. 

2095
02:18:37,041 --> 02:18:38,291
..the reason of my Alia's death? 

2096
02:18:38,375 --> 02:18:41,000
For you only Alia died and you're crying so much. 

2097
02:18:42,333 --> 02:18:45,583
Think of this; for so many years thousands of my children.. 

2098
02:18:46,041 --> 02:18:51,791
..created by me are killing each other. How much I've cried. 

2099
02:18:57,208 --> 02:19:01,625
Greed, hatred, enmity; I didn't create these in this world. 

2100
02:19:01,708 --> 02:19:03,000
You people created. 

2101
02:19:03,541 --> 02:19:07,291
Neither I made bomb, arms, bullets; you people made. 

2102
02:19:09,166 --> 02:19:13,375
Glass of your old car gets broken; you shout at me. 

2103
02:19:15,958 --> 02:19:21,333
You broke and destroyed the beautiful world I had made. 

2104
02:19:22,875 --> 02:19:26,541
I made one world, you made hundreds of countries. 

2105
02:19:27,208 --> 02:19:30,000
Have you ever thought what I've gone through? 

2106
02:19:30,416 --> 02:19:34,000
And you? I gave you so much power. 

2107
02:19:34,291 --> 02:19:35,958
What's it that you couldn't have done? 

2108
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:39,750
But you didn't use it in the right way. 

2109
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,041
You had the power of God. 

2110
02:19:44,041 --> 02:19:48,000
But your heart and brain remained that of humans. 

2111
02:19:48,666 --> 02:19:52,125
You remained Arun Prajapati; not God. 

2112
02:19:52,750 --> 02:19:56,500
I have realized, that whatever you've given to.. 

2113
02:19:56,583 --> 02:19:57,958
..an individual, that much is well enough for him. 

2114
02:19:59,041 --> 02:20:00,708
One must stay happy with that. 

2115
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:05,875
Only you can run this world; humans cannot. 

2116
02:20:07,583 --> 02:20:08,791
Forgive me. 

2117
02:20:09,208 --> 02:20:10,625
Okay, I forgive. 

2118
02:20:12,833 --> 02:20:14,583
The destruction that happened because of me.. 

2119
02:20:15,708 --> 02:20:19,416
Please set it all right. - That is the past. 

2120
02:20:20,541 --> 02:20:22,708
It's gone; it can't be set right. 

2121
02:20:23,416 --> 02:20:27,000
You are God; what's there that you can't do. 

2122
02:20:27,916 --> 02:20:29,500
Otherwise kill me as well. 

2123
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:32,125
Because I won't be able to live with this load. 

2124
02:20:33,333 --> 02:20:35,000
Because of me Alia died. 

2125
02:20:36,125 --> 02:20:40,166
The city got doomed, the country got doomed. 

2126
02:20:41,916 --> 02:20:45,208
Please, God, do something. 

2127
02:20:46,375 --> 02:20:50,000
All right; I'll take the world 10 days back. 

2128
02:20:51,125 --> 02:20:54,416
The world will start again from the time I phoned you. 

2129
02:20:55,916 --> 02:20:59,500
But think about it; everything will become the same. 

2130
02:21:00,583 --> 02:21:03,333
Once again you'll be a zero man expelled from the channel. 

2131
02:21:04,625 --> 02:21:06,291
Alia wouldn't have met you. 

2132
02:21:07,208 --> 02:21:10,208
Your sister, will be like before. 

2133
02:21:11,583 --> 02:21:13,250
Everything will be the same. 

2134
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,125
I agree. 

2135
02:21:17,333 --> 02:21:18,916
It'll be good for me. 

2136
02:21:19,916 --> 02:21:21,000
All right. 

2137
02:21:31,791 --> 02:21:36,333
Time is back there. Take this. 

2138
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,333
This is not my blessing; it's mother's blessing. 

2139
02:21:40,833 --> 02:21:43,041
Always keep this tied around your neck. 

2140
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:52,375
Mr. God. 

2141
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,250
If I have to talk to you? - You call me, I'll hear. 

2142
02:22:01,625 --> 02:22:03,000
I hear everyone. 

2143
02:22:03,541 --> 02:22:07,583
And if I've to see you again? - I'm within every human. 

2144
02:22:07,958 --> 02:22:09,541
Only the will to see me is needed. 

2145
02:23:15,416 --> 02:23:19,583
Answer me! Lost job, broke the car! 

2146
02:23:19,666 --> 02:23:21,375
What do you intend to do now; break this house!? 

2147
02:23:27,375 --> 02:23:31,208
I know that you love me a lot. 

2148
02:23:32,375 --> 02:23:36,958
Say it. - Who told you this!? Buttering me!? 

2149
02:23:37,208 --> 02:23:40,791
Do you want to serve in the municipality? - No. 

2150
02:23:41,916 --> 02:23:45,125
Tell me one thing; when did you laugh the last time? 

2151
02:23:49,583 --> 02:23:51,000
Two months after retirement. 

2152
02:23:51,458 --> 02:23:53,041
When did you laugh the last time? 

2153
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,583
That day you lost laughter, that day I too lost my laughter too. 

2154
02:24:02,208 --> 02:24:03,666
First you laugh and show me. 

2155
02:24:22,958 --> 02:24:24,166
You don't worry, son. 

2156
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:26,750
We'll sell this Hawa Mahal of your mother.. 

2157
02:24:26,833 --> 02:24:28,708
..to some builder and start life all over again. 

2158
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:30,208
Everything will be alright. 

2159
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:35,125
No, papa. I will work there only. 

2160
02:24:36,416 --> 02:24:38,250
Last night I got humiliated a lot. 

2161
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,708
I want back my repute. 

2162
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:44,333
Welcome to the first episode of 'Jhoot Bole Kawwa Kaate.' 

2163
02:24:44,416 --> 02:24:47,750
Your friend, your host, Rocky. This is a lie detecting chair. 

2164
02:24:47,833 --> 02:24:49,541
Means the lie detecting machine. 

2165
02:24:49,833 --> 02:24:53,625
And today the chief minister of our state will dare to sit on this. 

2166
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:55,416
Mr. Bholaram Sachha! 

2167
02:24:55,666 --> 02:24:57,541
Come, sir please.. please. 

2168
02:24:58,375 --> 02:24:59,583
Wait. 

2169
02:25:02,333 --> 02:25:04,375
I sacked him yesterday, he came again? 

2170
02:25:04,458 --> 02:25:06,750
Hello. - Gentleman, how come you are here? 

2171
02:25:06,833 --> 02:25:09,000
I want you to sit on this lie detecting machine first. 

2172
02:25:09,041 --> 02:25:10,375
Who is he? - Sir, he.. 

2173
02:25:10,458 --> 02:25:12,541
I'm here to make the game, not to play. 

2174
02:25:13,208 --> 02:25:16,041
I want to say that this chair is full of wires. 

2175
02:25:16,125 --> 02:25:18,666
It can give an electric shock; which can even.. 

2176
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:20,083
..put the chief minister's life in danger. 

2177
02:25:21,416 --> 02:25:23,083
So don't you wish that Mr. Rocky.. 

2178
02:25:23,166 --> 02:25:25,708
..sits on this chair first? - Yes.. yes.. yes! 

2179
02:25:25,791 --> 02:25:26,875
The boy is right. 

2180
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:30,416
I too will see how this machine works. - Yes, sir. 

2181
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:32,458
Alia! - Yes, sir? - Go, go! - Yes, sir. 

2182
02:25:33,666 --> 02:25:36,000
Excuse me. Two minutes. Sorry. 

2183
02:25:36,375 --> 02:25:38,083
Rocky, Mr. Bholaram is also saying and now even.. 

2184
02:25:38,166 --> 02:25:40,416
..the people are saying. Please sit on the chair. 

2185
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:42,041
Go! - But I'm the host of this show. 

2186
02:25:42,125 --> 02:25:45,416
If I sit on the chair then who will question me? - I. 

2187
02:25:46,375 --> 02:25:47,541
He? - Please, sit. 

2188
02:25:48,750 --> 02:25:51,083
Sorry. - He is doing the right thing. 

2189
02:25:51,166 --> 02:25:52,250
What is this fuss? 

2190
02:25:55,666 --> 02:25:57,791
Who had brought the gift for Alia that night? 

2191
02:26:00,625 --> 02:26:02,625
Hey, this is a personal matter between me and Alia. 

2192
02:26:02,708 --> 02:26:03,833
Who are you to ask that? 

2193
02:26:03,916 --> 02:26:06,250
No, Rocky; tell him that you had brought the gift. 

2194
02:26:06,708 --> 02:26:07,875
Yes, I had brought it. 

2195
02:26:11,166 --> 02:26:12,250
He is lying! 

2196
02:26:12,333 --> 02:26:14,250
Who had stolen my DVD in yesterday's launch party? 

2197
02:26:14,333 --> 02:26:16,000
Hey! I will beat you! 

2198
02:26:16,041 --> 02:26:18,000
I am from a good family! I hadn't committed a theft! 

2199
02:26:22,083 --> 02:26:24,791
Had you made the presentation that was shown yesterday? 

2200
02:26:25,041 --> 02:26:26,791
No, Salim Javed had made it! 

2201
02:26:26,875 --> 02:26:28,708
Of course, I had made it! 

2202
02:26:28,958 --> 02:26:31,500
Rocky, I can't believe you told me so many lies! 

2203
02:26:31,833 --> 02:26:36,000
Alia, trust me and not this chair! It's a machine! 

2204
02:26:36,333 --> 02:26:38,041
I'm the man who loves you! 

2205
02:26:38,458 --> 02:26:39,666
Shut up?! 

2206
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:42,041
Lies and more lies! He can become a politician! 

2207
02:26:42,375 --> 02:26:43,500
Stop! 

2208
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:46,000
By proving someone else to be a liar.. 

2209
02:26:46,083 --> 02:26:48,291
..you can't prove that you are truthful. 

2210
02:26:50,333 --> 02:26:52,500
You will have to answer a few of my questions. 

2211
02:26:54,250 --> 02:26:55,333
Go, sit on the chair. 

2212
02:27:00,125 --> 02:27:02,208
Have you ever loved anyone till now? 

2213
02:27:02,583 --> 02:27:03,750
No. 

2214
02:27:07,041 --> 02:27:08,791
He is telling a very cute lie! 

2215
02:27:10,166 --> 02:27:13,833
Is there a girl in your heart whom you love? 

2216
02:27:13,916 --> 02:27:15,000
No. 

2217
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:19,583
He is telling a true lie! 

2218
02:27:20,041 --> 02:27:22,000
So you don't love me. - No. 

2219
02:27:30,625 --> 02:27:31,750
Liar! 

2220
02:27:34,666 --> 02:27:37,583
I didn't know that you would love a liar. 

2221
02:27:48,625 --> 02:27:51,750
Where has Rocky gone? I won't spare him! 

2222
02:27:54,541 --> 02:27:58,333
'I dwell in every human being. You just need the eyes to look.' 

2223
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:08,916
Don't be upset with him. 

2224
02:28:09,958 --> 02:28:14,250
He was the angel who brought us together. 

2225
02:28:17,083 --> 02:28:18,375
Sir, what happened? 

2226
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,791
Chandani, I got everything in life, but I never got true love. 

2227
02:28:23,875 --> 02:28:26,916
Sir, I didn't understand! You do have a wife, don't you? 

2228
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Oh, God. - I am talking about love. 

2229
02:28:37,375 --> 02:28:42,166
Well, I had a long chat with Arun Prajapati.. 

2230
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:44,041
..now I would like to talk to you too for a minute. 

2231
02:28:45,416 --> 02:28:47,750
You do not know each other, still you are sitting together. 

2232
02:28:47,833 --> 02:28:49,041
I liked it. 

2233
02:28:50,416 --> 02:28:54,000
On seeing you sitting together, unity is strengthened. 

2234
02:28:54,333 --> 02:28:56,041
Strengthen unity in the world too. 

2235
02:28:56,583 --> 02:28:58,375
The world will become a more beautiful place. 

2236
02:28:59,375 --> 02:29:01,875
Love your self. Love people. 

2237
02:29:01,958 --> 02:29:03,041
And be happy. 

2238
02:29:03,750 --> 02:29:05,583
If you remain happy, we too will be happy. 

2239
02:29:06,541 --> 02:29:08,583
God is not great. 

2240
02:29:09,291 --> 02:29:13,000
He is great because of his believers; because of his devotees. 

2241
02:29:13,458 --> 02:29:17,875
So I will say that, humans, you are great. 

2242
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:03,791
"Oh God." 

2243
02:30:04,625 --> 02:30:06,000
"Oh God." 

2244
02:30:06,541 --> 02:30:07,875
"Oh God." 

2245
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:09,916
"Oh God." 

2246
02:30:10,625 --> 02:30:12,916
"Oh God. You are great." 

2247
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,750
"Oh God. You are great." 

2248
02:30:14,833 --> 02:30:16,916
"Oh God. You are great." 

2249
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,083
"Oh God. You are great."
