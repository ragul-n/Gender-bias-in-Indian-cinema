1
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,582
I‘m frustrated.
‘Tasneem‘ wont let me touch her

2
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,324
You must relax or
‘Little Johny‘ wont rise!

3
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,460
She says she wont
entertain ‘Little Johny‘

4
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,055
Do I have to marry for that?

5
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,762
Oh, she‘

 entertain ‘Little Johny‘.
All girls want it!

6
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,766
No. This girl isn‘t like that.

7
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:34,236
Listen. ‘Sakeena‘ was
once at the college fee counter

8
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,771
Said to the collector ‘Sir,
take mine, take it quickly‘

9
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,383
The guy got excited, said ‘wait
2 minutes, <i>
‘

</i> take it properly‘

10
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,081
An impatient ‘Sakeena‘ said

11
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:47,455
‘Sir, take it quickly
or my period will begin!‘

12
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,461
Wake up ‘Little Johny‘

13
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,325
So they‘re still at it, eh?

14
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,601
Move quickly.

15
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,699
Anuj.
- Hmmm.

16
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,965
Who do I talk to
for a news source in Aligarh?

17
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,207
- The PTI correspondent.

18
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,042
Do you have the number?
- Why?

19
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,409
I want to talk to
him about this story.

20
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,315
Your job is to select stories,
not write them.

21
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,656
Number, please.

22
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,354
You maybe clearing the slums
for the Commonwealth Games"

23
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,193
but you‘re creating
dumping grounds elsewhere.

24
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,755
Namita, I want to
talk about something.

25
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,092
No, no, sir..

26
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:47,428
Sir, we are not here
to ruin your reputation

27
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,770
You have enough people
doing that for you.

28
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,210
Thank you very much for your time.

29
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,438
First of all, you‘re looking
very pretty in this sari.

30
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,605
Stop sucking up...get to the point.

31
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,147
I have a breaking story.

32
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,012
Did you have to break
my conversation for that?

33
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:03,019
Some TV journalists barged
into a professofs home, in A
igarh..

34
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,420
..and they filmed him having
sex with a rickshaw-puller.

35
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,422
Okay.

36
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,949
Give it to Arpit,
he‘s good with sex scandals.

37
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,461
You think this is a sex-scandal?

38
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,725
The University suspended
that professor for being gay

39
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,466
What do you think this is?

40
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,965

t‘s a Human-story, my beat.

41
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,264
Please.
- Deepu...

42
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,134
...you‘ve been working
here for only 4 months.

43
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,970
You‘ve got to climb the
wire like everyone else.

44
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,543
I was a topper in my college.

45
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,009
I got a scholarship
to study journalism.

46
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,104
Deepu, please.
- Give it to Sonali.

47
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,705
I need someone with
experience on this.

48
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,278
Sonali?
- I think she failed high school.

49
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,579
Deepu, stop being a drama queen.
- Okay, sorry. Listen...
‘

 do a better job.

50
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,415
Trust me...just this one story.

51
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,977
Deepu, get back to work...and
stop disturbing me please.

52
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,250
Namita! Namita!
- Deepu, stop it.

53
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,622
Horrible sari.
- Thank you.

54
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,207
Hello aunty.

55
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,458
Sorry?

56
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,059
You forgot to switch the motor on.

57
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,438
Yeah, sorry, I came in late.

58
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,570
10pm.

59
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,412
Tenant must turn on the motor.
Or there‘

 be no water.

60
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,318
Turn it on again tomorrow at 7 am.

61
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,293
She really needs to get laid man.

62
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,771
Down with gay professor Siras!

63
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,173
Down with Siras!

64
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,838
Throw him out!

65
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,678
Throw him out!

66
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,541
Professor Siras.

67
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,248

68
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,060
Open the door.

69
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,024
Who is it?

70
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,037
Who?

71
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,232
Sridharan!

72
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,213
Sit. Sit.

73
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,054
The mosquitoes kept
me awake all night.

74
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,289
Didn‘t let me sleep all night.

75
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,330
Some tea?
- No need for tea.

76
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,229
<i>
‘

</i> be late.
Did you write the letter?

77
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
Why should I write it?

78
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,374
Whatever happened that night...

79
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,043
Whafs done is done. 
t‘s the past.

80
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,213
Think about your future.
Write the letter.

81
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,056
What should I write?

82
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:12,494
That you‘re ashamed for
whatever happened that night.

83
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,031
Thafs it.

84
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,520
Give me an envelope.

85
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,020
Okay.

86
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,531
You call this an envelope?

87
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,297
<i>
‘

</i> take one from my home.

88
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,031
One more thing.

89
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:59,143
Siras...things are
really bad on campus.

90
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,979
Stay away from the campus for a while.

91
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,174
Did you hear me?

92
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,544
Stay away from the campus!

93
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:49,788
“You found me worthy of love.“

94
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:59,596
“O heartmstop beating so fast,

‘ve found my destiny.“

95
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:05,041

“Yes, I accept yourmdecision.“

“Yes, I accept yourmdecision.“

98
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:37,525
“With every glance,
O beloved I say thank you.“

99
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:52,387
“You gave me a place in your life.“

100
00:16:52,545 --> 00:17:02,262
“O heartmstop beating so fast,

‘ve found my destiny.“

101
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:07,031
“You found me worthy of

“lam your destiny, and you are mine.“

104
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:41,028
“Why should I be
scared of the storm.“

105
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,508
“when you are my shore?“

106
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:50,537
“Someone tell the storm...“

107
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:55,245
“...

115
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,187
Good morning Deepu.

116
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,691
This isn‘t a hammock, ifs my desk.

117
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,226
You want my feedback?

118
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,328
What if I say no?

119
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:59,542
Your article feels like some gay-rights
protest statement, not a story.

120
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,079
Too bad your opinion
has never mattered.

121
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,376
Karan.
- Take your feet off my desk.

122
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:10,612
Namita.

123
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,151
Namita.

124
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,321
I need conveyance to go to Aligarh.

125
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,225
Deepu, I can‘t send you without
the senior editor‘s sanction.

126
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,422
You know how these things work.

127
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,021
Namita, please. I really need this.

128
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,033
Do this for me. Please.

129
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,433
You‘re looking so pretty
in this sari!

130
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,030
Say something like
research or something..

131
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,477
We cou
d‘ve taken the car, but no..

132
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,678
Why did we take your bike?

133
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,681
We‘

 buy booze with
the money we save.

134
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,199
Excuse me..

135
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,497
Where can lfind Prof. Siras?

136
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,265
He doesn‘t come here anymore.

137
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,367
Since when?

138
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,538
Since the scandal.

139
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,476
He did come once.
He packed his stuff and left.

140
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,176
Where can we find him now?
- I don‘t know.

141
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,375
She doesn‘t know anything.

142
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,187
Why is the department so empty?

143
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,616
Who cares about regional
languages around here?

144
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,385
We hardly get 2-3 students a year.

145
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,055
Professor‘ is just
a mere title!

146
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,197
Thank you.

147
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,101
Lefs go.

148
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,304
Excuse me, sir.

149
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,743
Where can lfind Prof. Sridharan?
- I am Sridharan.

150
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,241
Hello, I am Deepu Sebastian.

151
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,679
..from Indian Post Newspaper.
- So?

152
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,411
I wanted to talk about Prof. Siras,
for a story I am doing,

153
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,315
I have no time.

154
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,682
Sir, sir...on
y two minutes.

155
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,053
You think his suspension is justified?
- I don‘t want to talk to the media.

156
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,649
Sir, pleaseml want to help him.

157
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,591

t‘s best you don‘t help him.

158
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,129
This matter has already escalated
out of control.

159
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,758
But, sir, there was no action taken against
the two who conducted the sting operation.

160
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,433
Don‘t you think he‘s being victimized?

161
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,472
I request you,
please don‘t pursue him..

162
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,565
"otherwise he won‘t
have any place to even hide.

163
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,634
Please understand.
Excuse me...sorry.

164
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,775
Thank you, sir.

165
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,246
Later we‘

 eat some meat curry here.

166
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,344

‘ve heard a lot about it.

167
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,054
Cheapo, you‘

 pay the bill.

168
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,491
Deepu smile!

169
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,687
His house is completely locked

170
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,332
Looks like Siras has fled.

171
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,534
No, look the lights are on.

172
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,298
So what?

173
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,338
He musfve left the
lights on and fled.

174
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,203
He must be somewhere nearby.

175
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,243

‘m sure he‘s just scared.

176
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,447

‘ve been sitting here for 1% hours"

177
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,653

‘ve been sitting here for 1% hours
when is my turn?

178
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,360
Did you register your
name with the nurse?

179
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,525
Yes.

180
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,463
Then come tomorrow.
Because the nurse has left.

181
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,596
I think my Blood Pressure is high...

182
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,303
What the..

183
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,075
Delhi wasn‘t this cold.

184
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,704

t‘s really cold out here.

185
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,443

t‘s not that bad today.

186
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,120

Shall I call a doctor?

Give me your bags.

192
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,186
Are you okay, sir?

193
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,328
I was out in the sun all afternoon.

194
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,632
Mondays I do grocery shopping.

195
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:43,040
Must be a little bit of sunstroke.

196
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,675
Yes, the sun was out this afternoon.

197
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,552
What grade are you from?
- Huh!

198

campus compared to ours.

Don‘t come back here!

234
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,407

Shove the camera up your backside.

Don‘t yell at me.

243
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,038

I didn‘t know you

Go.

249
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,157
You‘

 get a direct
bus to Delhi from here.

250
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,702
You go, I am going
to try again tomorrow.

251
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,331
Go on, <i>
‘

</i> see you in Delhi.

252
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,705
Lend me some money.

Come on.

Thafs 2000.

What a cheapster.

See you day after.

258
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,122
Bye.

259
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,387
The University is charge-sheeting"

260
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:31,693
..Prof. Srinivas Siras for the incident
that took place on 8th February.

261
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,504
His immoral conduct..

262
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,434
..is unbecoming of a teacher
at Aligarh University (AU).

263
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:43,305
Prof. Siras will be
sent a legal notice today.

264
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,714
And he‘

 have to vacate
his allotted quarters.

265
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,546
..21 Medical Co
ony..

266
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,383
..within 7 days.

267
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,322
(OIS) Sir, can you tell us who the
other person with Prof. Siras was?

268
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,327
But, sir...what about the
two people who made this tape?

269
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,056
I mean...was there no
action taken against them?

270
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,689
No.
- But why?

271
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,289
Because they are not our employees!

272
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,266
But isn‘t it true that..

273
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,270
..this videotape was made
without Prof. Siras‘ permission?

274
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,704
You think this is funny?

275
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,202
A journalist is asking
me this question?

276
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,140
Do you take permission before
shoving your cameras anywhere?

277
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:22,713
Remember,
the issue here isn‘t the camera...

278
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,116
The issue is its content.

279
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,680
Whafs the reason
behind leaking this tape?

280
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,783
No more questions!

281
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,721
Well done.

282
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,360
Thank you.

283
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,664
No other reporter wou
d‘ve
raised this question.

284
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,069

t‘s my job.

285
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,503
Do I know you?

286
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,542
Tahir Islam, Philosophy Department.

287
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,513
Deepu Sebastian,
from Indian Post Newspaper.

288
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,344
Siras is a good friend of mine.

289
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,520
lam glad he has a friend.

290
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,156
You cannot disconnect my electricity.

291
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:07,356
This notice clearly states
that I have seven days.

292
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,366
You‘

 get electricity
for only 4 hours.

293
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,999
From 7am to 11am.

294
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,670
You cannot disconnect e
ectricity..

295
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,740
"as long as l‘m still living here.

296
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,699
I will lodge a complaint
with the police.

297
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,334
Go ahead, go to the police.

298
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,410
ls it done?
- Yes.

299
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,177
How about we settle this some
other way? Give me some more time.

300
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,387
What time did you say?

301
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,514
7am to 11am.

302
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,391
My father was a professor at AU.

303
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,064
I studied at Oxford.

304
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,330
But I came back here to teach..

305
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,539
..because of what
the University stood for.

306
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,373
What exactly did it stand for?

307
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,041
After the Mughal ru
e..

308
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,809
..it was the Aligarh University
that shaped..

309
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,743
..the outlook of the Muslims.

310
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,585
It imparted a...

311
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,714
A scientific and progressive
world view to Indian Muslims.

312
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,284
And of course, it was the
nursery for freedom fighters.

313
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,395
But the sad part is..

314
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:19,363
..
 can‘t use these
words for AU anymore.

315
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,502
Why?

316
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,140
This place is terribly politicized.

317
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:32,471
Back in time, differences
were settled through debates.

318
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,347
..these are now settled
through bloodshed.

319
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,479
You think Prof. Siras is
a victim of internal politics?

320
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,114
Oh yes, definitely.

321
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,095
He‘s been intentionally disgraced.

322
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,490
Sugar?
- Yes, one spoon.

323
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,230
Sir, can you tell me
about this in more detail?

324
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,236
About what could have happened...

325
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,172
Look, I want to help Siras..

326
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,039
..and I will do what I can.

327
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,544
But I can‘t rock the boat too much.

328
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,748

t‘s okay.

329
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,412
Thank you.

330
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,060
Hello, sir.

331
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,498
Who?
- Deepu Sebastian...

332
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,035
Dr. Islam must have spoken to you.

333
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,661
Yeah...he did.

334
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,103

335
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,200
Whafs wrong?

336
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,170
Something wrong with the meter?

337
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,440
Trying to reconnect
my electricity.

338
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,382
The University had my
Electricity disconnected.

339
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,417
So this is your meter?

340
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,020
No, thafs my neighbofs!

341
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,582
He‘s gone out.

342
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:54,262
That won‘t do it, sir.
Thafs the earth wire.

Please stand back.

345
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,236
No...
 mean you might get a shock.

346
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,977
Hmm...this one‘s the earth wire.

347
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,552
What happened?

348
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,585
Just joking, ifs done.

349
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,020
Done!

350
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,395
Shut it.

351
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,329
Take those.

352

- No...thank you.

355

356
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:12,404
Sir, 
‘m not after

357
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,001

t‘s none of my business, of course.

358
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:21,213
But I do know...they had
no right to barge into your home.

359
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,150
This was a conspiracy against me.

360
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,282
By Au?

361
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,391
By some people in AU.

362
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,465
They are jealous of me.

363
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,300
Why?

364
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:44,264
lam considered an outsider here.

365
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,198
An outsider.

366
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,308
lteach Marathi in
a city that speaks Urdu.

367
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,081

‘m a bachelor amongst married people.

368
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:01,186
Yet I was appointed the chairman
of the linguistics department.

369
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,990
You know, this morning when
they disconnected my e
ectricity..

370
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,195
..
 wanted to jump to my death
from the University‘s clock tower.

371
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,437
But I stopped.

372
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,445
Thank God I stopped!

373
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,114
Yes, sir.

374
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,014
Now I can drink!

375
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,080
Sir, do you mind ifl record?

376
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,450
Thank you.

377
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,757
You were saying something?

378
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,299
Last January a colleague...

379
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,739
...threatened that he
wou
dn‘t let me remain...

380
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,506
..the chairman of the Linguistic
department for too long.

381
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,946
And a week later this
incident took place.

382
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,450
ls it because you‘re gay?

383
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,632
I don‘t understand this word.

384
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,469
So you‘re not gay?

385
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:31,538
How can someone describe
my feelings in three letters?

386
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,381

t‘s like poetry..

387
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,521
...that is deep within.

388
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,556
A burning desire"

389
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,657
that cannot be controlled.

390
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:56,434
An uncontrollable urge.

391
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,676
Which poets have you read?

392
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,007
Poets?

393
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,272
Oh my..

394
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,545
I haven‘t read too many.

395
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,510
Tennyson is too confusing for me.

396
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,455
Too many words make my head spin.

397
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,288
As if poetry is in the words?

398
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,793
Poetry is found in between the words.

399
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
In the silencesmthe pauses.

400
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:29,267
People can interpret
it in different ways.

401
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,365
According to their age,
their maturity...

402
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:35,067
Understand?
- Understand...yes..

403
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,246
That book of yours,
“Grass Under my Feet“

404
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,544
I looked everywhere for it,
but cou
dn‘t find it.

405
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,282
Naturally,
who buys poetry these days!

406
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,591
And your generation has no
understanding of poetry at all.

407
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:55,758
They want to put
a label on everything.

408
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,161
Fantastic!

409
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,663
Fabulous!

410
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,294
Super! Superb!

411
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,361
Cool.
- Awesome!

412
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,769
Awesome!

413
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,376
So why did you join AU?
- I love AU.

414
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:13,314
No, I mean there‘s not
much demand for Marathi here..

415
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,682
I got a lot of respect here.

416
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:23,693
Now see...there are thousands
of Marathi teachers in Maharashtra.

417
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,223
But in Aligarh, there is only one.

418
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,357
Professor S R Siras!

419
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,464
Only one.

420
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,332
Yeah...on
y one.

421
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,277
Sir...can we talk about that night?

422
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:48,042
Those people who barged in,
did you know them?

423
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,480
How did they get in?

424
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,554
I don‘t know.

425
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,625
You think they broke in?

426
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,497
Or you did you leave the door open?

427
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,386
Pleasemtalk to me, sir.

428
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,361
You have to help me to help you.

429
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,161
Please sir.

430
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,370
Me and my friend...

431
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,041
...Wé..

432
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,275
..were in this bedroom.

433
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:01,516
Two people came in.

434
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,024
One was holding a camera...

435
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,464
...and the other was holding a stick.

436
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,700
They pounced on us.

437
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,100
They were hitting us with the stick.

438
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,075
Especially my friend.

439
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,649
They didn‘t let me
wear my clothes either.

440
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,384
They took off my clothes.

441
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,688
I kept pleading...

442
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,198
...not to hit my friend.

443
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,539
Just...

444
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,772
.. just so shameful.

445
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:10,221
When sudden
y...four of my
colleagues came in my bedroom.

446
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,425
Your colleagues?

447
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,726
What were they doing here?

448
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,542
Its okay, sir.

449
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,396
Am I drunk?

450
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,798
Not yet.

451
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,072
Then <i>
‘

</i> have one more.

452
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,204
Sure.

453
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,324
My book.

454
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:23,029
‘Paya Khali Hirwal.‘

455
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,667
Grass Under my Feet!

456
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,205
If you ever feel like reading poetry.

457
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,370
Thank you, sir.

458
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,213
Oh. But I can‘t read Marathi!

459
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,314

‘ve a translated version as well.

460
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,446
But it is very poorly translated.

461
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:48,722
I was thinking...l should
translate it myself someday.

462
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,282
So you can give me that cOPY. sir.

463
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:53,192
No... this is a souvenir.

464
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,426
Okay...thank you.

465
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,996
In that case, can I get an autograph,

466
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,298
No, <i>
‘

</i> do it with my pen.

467
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,174
Signed copy.

468
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,378
Love...

469
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:22,390
...S R Siras.

470
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,490
Okay?
- Yeah...perfect.

471
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,758
Okay, <i>
‘

</i> take your leave, sir.

472
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,430
Be careful, ifs quite late.

473
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,127
Pleasure meeting you.

474
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,459
<i>
‘

</i> see you soon.

475
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,698
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

476
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:03,130

‘ve switched on the motor.

477
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,609
This story has got
nothing to do with..

478
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,178
..him being gay or straight.

479
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,990
The question is...how did six peop
e..

480
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,291
..barge into his home
without his permission.

481
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,695
On 2nd July, 2009..

482
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:20,698
..De
hi High Court
declared section 377...

483
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,740
was unconstitutional.

484
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:27,014
Prof. Siras‘ suspension
and charge-sheeting..

485
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:30,676
..is a harsh blow
to the judicial decision.

486
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,120
Today...we need to..

487
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,721
..unite and challenge that decision!

488
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,258
For the first time in Indian History"

489
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,234
..the law is in our favor.

490
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,359
Justice for Siras!

491
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:52,135
Justice for Siras!

492
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:02,518
Look, Mr. Siras...
if you decide to challenge AU..

493
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,017
..we will support you entirely.

494
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,952
You don‘t realize it...but
your case is very strong.

495
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,515
Due to the amendment of section 377.

496
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,690
Pardon me,
but 
‘ve no interest in activism.

497
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,062
Mr. Siras, this isn‘t activism.

498
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,265

t‘s fighting for our rights.

499
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:26,035
Let me show you something, sir.

500
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,540
Take a look at this
signature campaign.

501
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:34,140
30,000 people have
signed in your support.

502
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,248
You must have heard
about Vijay Grover.

503
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,422
The same lawyer that
argued against section 377.

504
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,717
He wants to represent
you in this case.

505
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,254
I see.

506
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,022
Siras, you‘ve been
working here for so long.

507
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,697
Do you really think they will
revoke your suspension so easily?

508
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:59,139
You have to fight it out, Mr. Siras.

509
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,249
What will I have to do?

510
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,390
We‘

 have to write in
our petition that you‘re gay.

511
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,457
What?

512
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,334
We‘

 have to write in
our petition that you‘re gay.

513
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,227
Will you be alright?

514
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,037
Do we have your permission?

515
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,599
No. No. No...

516
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,272
No.

517
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,819
Excuse me, professor, please.

518
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,591
Put the luggage down.

519
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,256
What?
- Keep the bag there...please..

520
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,731
.. only for a minute.

521
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,193
Switch it on.

522
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,564
Sir, how does it feel?

523
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,498
What?

524
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,701
How are you feeling
leaving your old home?

525
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,409
Please tell us, sir.

526
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,635
Let me go.
- Please, sir.

527
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:12,510
Lefs go.

528
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,571
Please, sir.

529
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,264
Take the suitcase up.

530
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,502
The books.

531
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:30,309
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“

532
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:48,667
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“

533
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:55,647
“I will lovemworship you.“

534
00:52:56,073 --> 00:53:01,284
“Make you my God.“

535
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:10,489
“
t‘s a desire of a restless heart.“

536
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:33,184
“As long as you didn‘t..“

537
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:38,694
“..inhibit my forlorn dreams.“

538
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:44,261
“Happiness was unknown to me..“

539
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:49,771
“..and sorrows were like a stranger.“

540
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,160
“I even hid my heartbeats from me..“

541
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,613
The problem with 377
was nobody could speak up.

542
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,044
If you said you were gay..

543
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,387
..you were directly
seen as a criminal.

544
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,684
I applaud your courage.

545
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,455
It must not have
been easy coming here.

546
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:16,464
No, sir. You‘re the courageous one.

547
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,031
You‘re fighting for people like you.

548
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,069
I don‘t think he‘s gay.

549
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:30,773
He‘s not a gay?

550
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:34,644
We don‘t say ‘a‘ gay?

551
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,742
What?
- 
t‘s just “He‘s Gay“.

552
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:39,749
He‘s Gay?

553
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,583
Getting late. Come.

554
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:42,783
Lefs go.

555
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,659
According to the Times
Asia Higher Education Body..

556
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:50,563
..A
igarh University is ranked
no.3 amongst Indian Universities.

557
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:54,431
Clearly such eminent universities.

558
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,767
...have a strict code of conduct.

559
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,140
Mr. Siras didn‘t just
violate these rules"

560
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:05,973
..in fact, he has also violated
the moral code of his employees.

561
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:10,510
Due to his obscene behavior
within the University premises..

562
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:14,053
..he has tarnished the image
of the teacher community.

563
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:17,257
The victim here isn‘t Mr. Siras..

564
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,691
..the victim here
is Aligarh University"

565
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,730
"because their great reputation
has been tarnished.

566
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,364
By suspending Mr. Siras..

567
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,465
..the Aligarh University
has abided by its rules.

568
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:31,104
And ifs not illegal to
follow rules and regulations. ls it?

569
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,036
THANK YOU.

570
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:40,441
Thank you.

571
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,244
Your lordship.

572
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,150
You said AU followed ‘their‘ rules.

573
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,320
‘Their‘ rules. Not the
rules of the Indian Constitution.

574
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,425
You‘re forgetting that..

575
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:58,761
..in the court we argue
within legislatures and laws.

576
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:00,701
Article 21 clearly states.

577
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,029
..every citizen of
this country is entit
ed..

578
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,073
..to the right to
privacy and dignity.

579
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:08,334
Which means,
every citizen of this democracy..

580
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,569
..is equally entitled
to solitude and boundaries.

581
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,345
On the night of 8th February..

582
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,510
..my client was deprived
of his constitutional right.

583
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,686
Some people forcefully
entered his home..

584
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:22,519
..and filmed him
in his private moments.

585
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,550
When the University officials.

586
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,991
Proctor Zuber Khan,
deputy proctor Feroz Majid..

587
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:31,022
..PRO Shadab Qureshi and
Media Advisor AK Murtuza arrived..

588
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,069
..they cou
d‘ve stopped
this violation, your lordship.

589
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,602
But instead of reprimanding
those two reporters"

590
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,664
..the University officials
persecuted my client.

591
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,442
They humiliated him.

592
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:47,538
And the next day, without any
inquiry...AU suspended Dr. Siras.

593
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,309
Without giving him a
chance to even appea
..

594
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,317
..he was charge-sheeted.

595
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:56,319
He was given only 7
days to vacate his home..

596
00:56:56,547 --> 00:57:00,324
..during which the electric supply
to his home was also disconnected.

597
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:06,030
Your lordship, my client
is a 64 year old senior citizen.

598
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,332
He had only 3 months
to go before retirement.

599
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,269
Aligarh University"

600
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,738
"has blatantly violated
my clients Constitutional rights.

601
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,275
We appeal to the honorable court..

602
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,211
..that Prof. Siras‘
suspension be revoked.

603
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,611
And his home, 21 Medical Co
ony..

604
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,975
..be immediately
returned to him.

605
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,348
Thank you, your lordship.

606
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,155
Sir, can you hear them now?

607
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,758
Can you hear them
from the studio? - Okay.

608
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,163
Yeah..
- Okay...we‘re ready to go.

609
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:42,670
Yeah.

610
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,069
Okay. Good luck, sir.

611
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,164
(OIS) Good evening and welcome
to India Fights Back..

612
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:49,068
a professor of
the Aligarh University"

613
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,443
..on the verge of retirement,
has been fired for being gay.

614
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,715
This new controversy has reignited..

615
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,751
..the homosexuality debate
on the University campus.

616
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,544
And both Students and
Teachers stand divided.

617
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:06,255
Prof. Siras,
were you sacked because you are gay?

618
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:14,101
lam very disturbed,
because after years of service..

619
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:18,264
..the University decided
to take such a step.

620
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,568
lam very much upset.

621
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,239
Those people entered
my house without..

622
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,337
(OIS) Society requires punishment
when there is an offence..

623
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,609
Nobody should be allowed to
devalue our system.

624
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,452
It is not about being gay or anything.
This is about morality.

625
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,752
(OIS) We teacher community,
in any University are..

626
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,721
..to teach moral values.

627
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:44,158
(OIS) So nobody should be a

owed...to
devalue our own system.

628
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,166
They are not asking me any question.

629
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,208
Islam is against
any sex outside marriage.

630
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,604
And anybody who is
coming in the way of..

631
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,478
..the survival of
humanity as well as..

632
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,482
..the advancement of the humanity.

633
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:05,284
He

o..

634
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:07,553
Listen...
- He wants to pee...

635
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,181
He wants to go to the loo.

636
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:10,224
Can you put him on loop?

637
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,221
Yes, put him on loop please.

638
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,391
Yes, okay..

639
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,610
So tell us Mr. Qureshi.

640
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,680
The proctor and I were having dinner..

641
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,986
..at a guesthouse close-by.

642
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:48,396
We heard that, someone was filming
something at the Medical Colony.

643
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,629
As the Public Relations Officer,
ifs my duty..

644
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,566
..to be present if there is
any filming on campus.

645
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,629
I called up Deputy Proctor Dr. Majid..

646
00:59:56,693 --> 01:00:02,644
..and Media Advisor Prof. Murtuza,
and asked them to accompany me.

647
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,604
What did you see when you got there?

648
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,278
I saw that...

649
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:14,018
...Siras and his partner
were sitting on the bed.

650
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,288
Siras was in his undergarments.

651
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,785
..and he was apologizing
to those reporters.

652
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:23,221
I immediately demanded
to see the videotape.

653
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:28,592
And what I sawmwas completely
vulgar and shameful.

654
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,636
What did you see?

655
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,531
It was embarrassing.

656
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,068
He was involved in an immoral
act with that rickshaw-puller.

657
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,475
So was it sexual in nature?

658
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,208
Homo-sexual.

659
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,654
Practicing homosexuality
within the University premises..

660
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:50,282
"is totally immoral
and is forbidden.

661
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,661
He was suspended under the AU rules.

662
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,196
Thank you.

663
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,165
No more questions.
Please.

664
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:12,273
Mr. Qureshi, what were you and Proctor
doing that night in the guest house?

665
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,014
Like I said, we were having dinner.

666
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,279
Just dinner?

667
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,622
Was it just the two of you?

668
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,749
Where were your wives?

669
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:24,787
What do you mean?

670
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:30,130
I mean did they know you
two were alone in the guest house?

671
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,495
What kind of a question is that?

672
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:34,035
Two peop
e...a

 alone in a empty
guest house. Anything is possible.

673
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,297
I object.
- Sustained.

674
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,108
Mr. Qureshi, how did you find out..

675
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,146
..that some people were filming
at 21 Medical Colony?

676
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:49,516
It got an... anonymous phone call.

677
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:52,452
Anonymous phone call? Convenient.

678
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:55,615
Did they have permission to shoot?

679
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,117
No.

680
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,122
So when you saw them
shooting without permission..

681
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,167
..did you take any action?
Did you call the police?

682
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,099
No.

683
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,659
Why didn‘t you call the police?

684
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:14,005
When I arrived, I saw that Siras
was apologizing to the reporters.

685
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,031
He was embarrassed.

686
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,372
He admitted his mistake.
- Thafs alright.

687
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:17,639
Why didn‘t you call the po
ice..

688
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:19,146
..because they were
shooting without permission?

689
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,478
But Siras could‘ve
called the police as well.

690
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:24,616
But...he didn‘t.

691
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,489
There was no doubt that he was guilty.

692
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,025
Didn‘t you feel that Prof. Siras
was mortified..

693
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:34,120
..by the violent and aggressive
behavior of those reporters?

694
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,325
Thafs why I demanded
to see the videotape.

695
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,093
He did not seem ‘mortified‘
while in the act.

696
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,462
Why did you call those
reporters to another room?

697
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:48,469
What was the need for a private
conversation at that moment?

698
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:54,577
Because I personally requested
them not to air the tape.

699
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:59,282
I didn‘t want the University‘s
reputation to be maligned.

700
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,021
Really?

701
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,385
Times!

702
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,684
Herald!

703
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,289
Daily!

704
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,221
Exactly two days 
ater..

705
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,993
..you were giving interviews
to every newspaper.

706
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:14,058
Didn‘t you think about
the University‘s reputation then?

707
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:18,368
The prosecution is trying
to mislead the court your honor.

708
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,237
Thafs not true your honor.
- That is true.

709
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,506
The question isn‘t
how my clients got there.

710
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:27,240
The question is about...
Mr. Siras‘ gross misconduct.

711
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,409
And anyway, why are we
sermonizing about his innocence?

712
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,655
When he has already accepted
that he was wrong.

713
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,155
Thafs not true, your honor.
- That is true.

714
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,193
This is just a..
- Can I just show something to you?

715
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,487
Allow me.

716
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:43,097
This is a letter
that was written by him.

717
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,564
It is signed by him, and..

718
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:48,068
..it is addressed to the
vice-chancellor of the University.

719
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,729
lam sorry, your lordship,
we don‘t have a copy of that.

720
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,795
<i>
‘

</i> give you a cOPY. Mr. Grover.

721
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,132
Please.

722
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,545
He‘s clearly accepted in this 
etter..

723
01:03:57,801 --> 01:03:59,246
..that he‘s wrong.

724
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:04,048
Why did you write that letter?

725
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:06,083
Sridharan asked me to.

726
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:10,488
He tried talking to
the Vice Chancellor for pardoning me.

727
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:12,385
ls he your friend?
- Yes.

728
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,151
You will have to talk to him.

729
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,286
This letter doesn‘t look good.
He will have to depose.

730
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,353
lwill try.

731
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,559
Look, Siras...

732
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,326
...no one from my fami
y..

733
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:55,165
"has ever been to
a police station or court.

734
01:04:55,592 --> 01:05:00,132
Don‘t humiliate us. Please.

735
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:04,476
Sridharan, I am feeling bad too.

736
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:09,439
But they are using
that letter against me.

737
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,745
Who asked you to go to the court?

738
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:20,455
I told you...this matter
would die down in a few months.

739
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,754
What else could I do, Sridharan?

740
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,597
Now this has become
a public issue, Siras.

741
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:33,198
Sorry, you will have
to endure it alone.

742
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,372
Dinner‘s ready.

743
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,475
Okay?

744
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,045
Fine.

745
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,219
Fine, fine.

746
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:53,786
Fine.

747
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,163
Hello, aunty.

748
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,028
How are you back so soon today?

749
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,333
I finished work early.

750
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,408
One second, <i>
‘

751
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,116

You‘re back early today.

01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:53,645
So can‘t I come to my room whenever..

My diary!

755
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,486
Whose kids are these?
Whafs going on here?

756
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,151
Tuitions...
- With whose permission?

757
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,396
I don‘t need your permission.

758
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,391
<i>
‘

</i> talk to aunty.

759
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:06,133
Aunty.

Aunty.

761

Maggfs taking tuitions in my room.

Don‘t be so na'
've.

764
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:17,175
Then do it in your room.

765
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,713
Your room is always empty"

766
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:23,417
..you often come late.
So I let her give tuitions there.

767
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,748
What do I do now?
I want to change? Where do I go now?

768
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,717
You‘re always such a mess anyway!

769
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,015
Go mind your business!

770
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,029
What..
- Sorry.

771
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:45,370
Tenants these days think
They own the house.

772
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:53,177
Deepu..

773
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,483
Deepuy
Wake up!

774
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,150
Wake up!
Were you working late?

775
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,588
Did you not see your email?
- What happened?

776
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:07,025
Siras‘s video..
with the rickshaw-puller.

777
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,360
What happened?

778
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,226
Lets go to the conference room.

779
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:25,643
Catch him! Catch him!

780
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:29,309
What have I done?

781
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:32,012
Let me go, sir.
I haven‘t done anything.

782
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,749
No, I haven‘t done anything.
Let me go.

783
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,522
Do it! Do it now!

784
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,287
I haven‘t done anything.

785
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:42,455
Why did you stop?

786
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:45,689
Look here.

787
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,428
We weren‘t doing anything.

788
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,163
Let me go.

789
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,295
D0 it!

790
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,275
Take that off.

791
01:08:57,567 --> 01:09:01,174
Whafs your name?
- lrfan

792
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,224
Excuse me.

793
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,556
Do you know where lrfan lives?

794
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,324
The rickshaw puller.

795
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:23,164
Do you know where lrfan lives?

796
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,273
He‘s a skinny boy, pulls a rickshaw.

797
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,398
I don‘t know.

798
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,310

t‘s okay. Thank you.

799
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,418
Do you know where lrfan lives?

800
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:43,279
lrfan?

801
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:47,524
Where does lrfan live?

802
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:49,661
This is 
rfan‘s house.

803
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:54,626
ls he at home?
- He isn‘t.

804
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:56,733
Where did he go?

805
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:59,269
The police gave him a sound thrashing.

806
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,104
And we don‘t know where he is now.

807
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,668
Any address.

808
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:08,477
Stop bothering me..
- No, no...
 am not bothering you.

809
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:09,710
Please go away.

810
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:13,049
Just two minutes.
- Please go away. I said go away.

811
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:14,012
Go away.

812
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,386
Please...if you have any address.

813
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:18,426
I said I don‘t want to
talk about lrfan. Go away.

814
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:19,551
Salim!

815
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,187
Salim!

816
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:22,195
Yes aunty..

817
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:24,698
Salim, this boy‘s troubling me.

818
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:30,434
Why are you bothering her.
- No, no, I am not bothering her.

819
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:55,721
Deepu.
- Sir.

820
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,162
How are you?

821
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,297
Fine, thank you.

822
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:03,629
I was told that I have a visitor"

823
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:07,539
..and I was thinking
who this person is.

824
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,337
I was crossing through this town.
I knew you were here.

825
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:14,143
So I thought I should look you up.

826
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,008
Crossing all the
way through Allahabad?

827
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,449
No, actually I wanted to know
how the court case was going..

828
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,453
..and ifs been a while.

829
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,353
I thought I must come and see you.

830
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,152
Actually I was going to have lunch.

831
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,364
Will you join me?
- Yeah, of course.

832
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:34,463
As long as you‘re paying for it..
- Sure. why not.

833
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:36,470
lam kidding sir. Of course.

834
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,177
How did you get that bruise?

835
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,080
This one.

836
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,411
This?

837
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,348
Oh, this.

838
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,647
This was during World War 1,
with the Germans.

839
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,519
very funny.

840
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:57,683
Some more lentils?
- No.

841
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,055
Just a little.
- No.

842
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,584
Why?
- No.

843
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,426
You touched it.
- So?

844
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,733
You‘re eating meat,
we‘re Brahmins.

845
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:11,470
Oh my... sorry sir, I didn‘t know.
- 
t‘s okay.

846
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:16,007
I don‘t understand
all this religious stuff!

847
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,411
Religion isn‘t
something to understand.

848
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,249
The minute you start rationalizing,
you sacrifice faith.

849
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:28,221
I did see “Aastha“ (faith)
on television! I understand!

850
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,257
How‘s the court case going?

851
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,290
Are you taking my interview, Deepu?

852
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,633
No, no, sir.

‘ve just come to meet you.

853
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,634
So, how‘s the court case coming along?

854
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:50,703
Very boring.

855
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:54,105
I go crazy with boredom!

856
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:59,719
But I blame my father
for this.

857
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:00,418
Why?

858
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,149
He was a lawyer.

859
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:09,992
I grew up hearing about sections,
petitions, arguments...

860
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:12,724
But I didn‘t understand it then..

861
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:16,162
And I still don‘t understand it!

862
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,205
lcan imagine.

863
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:23,769
I have a strange relation
with law as well.

864
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:27,175
When I was a kid,
I would argue with everyone

865
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:29,183
People would say
“He will become a lawyer.“

866
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,474
I even prepared for Law school.

867
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:32,679
I managed to get admission too.

868
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:36,023
But fortunately I changed my mind.

869
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:42,056
But dad...who paid
100,000 rupees as fees.

870
01:13:42,285 --> 01:13:44,060
..he still taunts me about it.

871
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,728
Dads are all the same really.

872
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:51,330
ls he happy with your job now?

873
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:59,070
Either be a doctor, or a engineer...or
go abroad and mint money.

874
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,306
Nothing else matters.

875
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,485
And your family members?

876
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,658
Two brothers, in Nagpur.

877
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,593
Do you talk to them?

878
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,760
We don‘t get along.

879
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,702
We‘ve been living apart for 3O years.

880
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,334
But their children
are very close to me.

881
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:32,212
Children don‘t judge you.

882
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,276
Never.

883
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:56,068
Didn‘t your parents pressurize you
for marriage?

884
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,098
I mean it normally
happens in small cities.

885
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:02,404
The family pressurizes you
for marriage after a certain age.

886
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,143
I did get married.
- You did?

887
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,982
Back when I got a job as a professor.

888
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:18,055
She did come to Aligarh as well.

889
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,620
But it did not work out.

890
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:26,432
Because you are gay?

891
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,537
No, it wasn‘t that.

892
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,767
Then?

893
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:40,540
I was too busy with
my books and my old film songs.

894
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,347
She got bored of me and left.

895
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:58,031
Now tell me honestly,
how did you get that bruise?

896
01:15:58,621 --> 01:15:59,793
This!

897
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:06,097
Actually I went to Jamalpur,
to meet lrfan.

898
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,599
That place is really rough.

899
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,338
lrfan doesn‘t live there anymore.
He ran away.

900
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,980
His mother said that
the police thrashed him up.

901
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:28,724
Why are they harassing the poor man?

902
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,132
You think lrfan was involved too?

903
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:41,602
Meaning?

904
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:45,342
Your door wasn‘t damaged
from the outside.

905
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:47,640
So someone might have
left it open from within.

906
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,782
Maybe I didn‘t shut it properly.

907
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:58,056
There are three latches on your door.

908
01:16:58,314 --> 01:16:59,793
And you forgot to lock all of them?

909
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:10,400
Sir, I am sorry but..

910
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,099
..you will have to be
comfortable talking about lrfan.

911
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:15,733
Otherwise these people
will drive you crazy.

912
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:23,142
We knew each other for just 8 months.

913
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:33,025
At my age, people often get lonely.

914
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,257
Was he your lover?

915
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:51,069
You people are so obsessed
with the word ‘
over‘..

916
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:59,252
..at least try to
understand ‘
ove‘.

917
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:02,947
Its a beautiful word..

918
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:08,392
You‘re making it
sound like a dirty word.

919
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,590
I have a problem with this.

920
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,004
Can I take a picture with you?

921
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,443
With me?
- Yeah.

922
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,711
Look.

923
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:41,057
Nice.

924
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:44,690
lam looking so bad.
- No, you‘re looking very good.

925
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,130
You are a very good looking man.

926
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,327
Oh, God!

927
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,766
Thank you.

928
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,602
Alright, sir.

929
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,147
See you next time,
after you win the case.

930
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,547
Thank you for coming.

931
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:06,052

t‘s an honor, sir. Goodnight.

932
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:08,647
Deepu.

933
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,561
My book.

934
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,731
Sir, I still know
just one word in Marathi.

935
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:19,693
‘Marathif

936
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:24,467
No, no...
 translated this in English.

937
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:28,033
I had nothing to do in the court.

938
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:31,101
So I thought 
‘d
translate this for you.

939
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:33,410
Wow!

940
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,078
Thank you so much, sir.

941
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:40,348
My English is not as
good as you peop
e‘s English.

942
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,319
Thank you, sir, really.

943
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,220
Welcome.

944
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,258
Goodnight, sir.

945
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:07,606
“O beloved moon,
fear not the dawn that separates us.“

946
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:15,184
“For we will meet again,
when the world goes to sleep.“

947
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,254
“In the light of day, I am unseen.“

948
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:28,126
“It is in your light,
my heart awakens.“

949
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:34,200
“We will dance as shadows dance..“

950
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,770
“..to the songs of nightingales.“

951
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,674
“We will touch as shadows touch..“

952
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:48,049
“..becoming one in the midnight sun.“

953
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:58,257
“O beloved moon,
fear not the dawn that separates us.“

954
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:05,130
“For we will meet again,
when the world goes to sleep.“

955
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:41,140
Keep it on tonight.

956
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:43,806
Why?

957
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,746
I feel cold in the dark.

958
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,247
I feel hot.

959
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,585
I feel scared.

960
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,765
Of whom?

961
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:31,624
I did not realize that two
people had already entered my flat.

962
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:36,486
They claimed to be
from News 100 channel.

963
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:40,532
They pounced on us and one of them...
started beating us with a stick.

964
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,091
Especially...

965
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,502
My friend.

966
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,408
They didn‘t let me
wear my clothes either.

967
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:57,513
lmasked why they‘re doing it,
they said"

968
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,551
..“We‘ve received a complaint“.

969
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,520
“How dare you behave so
obscenely in a family society?“

970
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:09,086
And then they made us
stand in a corner..

971
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:12,696
..and took our pictures
in embarrassing positions.

972
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:27,743
I kept requesting them to stop"

973
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:33,050
..and thafs when four
of my University colleagues.

974
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,355
..came into my bedroom.

975
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:39,081
Can you tell the names of your
colleagues to the honorable court?

976
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:40,388
Yes.

977
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:50,628
University Proctor, Dr. Zuber Khan.

978
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:55,370
Deputy Proctor, Dr. Feroz Majid.

979
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:03,711
University PRO, Dr. Shadab Qureshi.

980
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,743
Professor AK Murtuza.

981
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,683
I was surprised to see them.

982
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:16,458
Because I neither called
nor asked anyone for help.

983
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:22,594
Prof. Siras, you didn‘t call them?
- No, I didn‘t.

984
01:24:24,026 --> 01:24:28,600
They stood there
and kept staring at me.

985
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,772
And they did not let me
wear my clothes...

986
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,210
Then, they took the reporters
to the adjoining room..

987
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,218
..where they had a conversation.

988
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:46,052
Later the reporters left.

989
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:49,562
Shadab Qureshi returned to my room..

990
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:58,528
..and I pleaded with him
that he keep this under wraps.

991
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:04,505
And he assured me
that he has the tape..

992
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,206
..and he will ensure
it remains private.

993
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:15,611
But next day...this story was
published in every local newspapen.

994
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:18,055
..a
ong with my photograph.

995
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:23,529
And then I was suspended.

996
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:34,607
Mr. Siras, what was your relationship
with the rickshaw-puller?

997
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,114
I asked, what was your relationship
with the rickshaw-puller?

998
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:42,575
He was a friend.

999
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:43,412
Friend.

1000
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,577
Will you tell the court
about your exact relation with him?

1001
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,621
Your lordship,
this has no connection with the case"

1002
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:50,020
Fine, I will change my question.

1003
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,453
You‘re such a senior professor,
Mr. Siras..

1004
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:57,122
..and you mingle with
a lower-class Muslim from the slums?

1005
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:58,688
What kind of a friendship is this?

1006
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:00,529
We would listen to music.

1007
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:02,193
Listen to music? What else?

1008
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,634
Watch movies together.
- Watch movies?

1009
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:05,501
And you would pay
him to have sex with you.

1010
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:06,733
Your lordship,
she‘s asking ridiculous questions..

1011
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:09,238
Tell us, Mr. Siras.
- She‘s only talking about the sex!

1012
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,368
Fine, okay...
‘

 change my question.

1013
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:12,639
Whafs your age?

1014
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:14,180
63? 64?

1015
01:26:14,236 --> 01:26:16,682
64. 64 is your age, right?

1016
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,218
Even at 64 you have
the strength to have sex.

1017
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,345
Your lordship, such questions
cannot be a

owed.. - Speak up.

1018
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,548
Why don‘t you speak up?

1019
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:23,681
Tell us, Siras sir.

1020
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,589
lthink you cannotjust.
- 
...
 don‘t want to talk about this.

1021
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,389
Why don‘t you want to talk about it?

1022
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:31,192
You‘ve pressed charges against
such an esteemed University.

1023
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:32,698
You will have to
answer my questions.

1024
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:34,256
..but I will change my question.

1025
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,358
Tell me...who was the ‘man‘ in bed?
You or the rickshaw-puller?

1026
01:26:36,425 --> 01:26:38,462
What is she talking?
- Tell us, Mr. Siras.

1027
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:52,551
Whafs wrong?

1028
01:26:53,142 --> 01:26:56,715
You have to vacate
the house right now.

1029
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:00,058
Why?

1030
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:02,322
Bachelors aren‘t allowed here.

1031
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,129
Why did your agent lie?

1032
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:07,690
You‘re not married.
You lied.

1033
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,400
No, I am married.

1034
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:14,037
I was...
 mean...
 still am.

1035
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:15,234
Fine. Then...

1036
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:16,632
Where is your family?

1037
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,372
I have a family.
- Where?

1038
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:23,712
My family is in Nagpur,
and I live here.

1039
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,645
You can stay here when
you bring your family.

1040
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,709
Take your luggage and get out.

1041
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:28,977
Why?

1042
01:27:29,044 --> 01:27:31,422
If the others living
here are ‘familiesﬂ.

1043
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,983
..did I bother anyone?

1044
01:27:34,216 --> 01:27:35,593
No, you didn‘t.

1045
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:36,721
But you 
ied..

1046
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,362
That you‘re a family.

1047
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,058
-I lied?

1048
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:40,759
Yes.

1049
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,993
Didn‘t you take security fees?
- Yes, I did.

1050
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:46,061
Didn‘t you take a deposit from me?
- Yes, I did.

1051
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:48,074
Didn‘t you take registration?
- Yes, I did.

1052
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,541
Why?
- For renting my apartment.

1053
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,407
So I am staying in this apartment.

1054
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:53,105
I don‘t care.

1055
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:56,672
We have families living here,
Bachelors are not allowed.

1056
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,651
Are bachelors terrorists?
- Maybe.

1057
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:02,052
Vacate the room.
- Why should I?

1058
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,612
Rasca
...ba§~~~

1059
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,215
Who do you think you are?

1060
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,384
What?

1061
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,554
Did I pick a fight? Or trouble you?

1062
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,459
What do you think you are?
- What are you saying?

1063
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,966
Why did you take security fees?
- I did.

1064
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:16,196
Why did you take deposit?
- I did.

1065
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,292
Why did you take it?

1066
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,100
I took it because
I rented the apartment to you.

1067
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:21,232
This is your apartment?
- Yes.

1068
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,401
Then stay in your apartment.
- What is this?

1069
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,569
Rascal!

1070
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,442
What are you all staring at?

1071
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:33,010
This is a peaceful neighborhood.

1072
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:35,646
There‘s a stainless
steel factory close-by..

1073
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:37,588
..and they make really good locks.

1074
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:40,684
How many locks will I need?
- Sir, I would advise two.

1075
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:43,059
You have to be careful. Right?

1076
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:45,223
Did you talk to the owner?
- Yes.

1077
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,766
The owner stays out of town mostly.

1078
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,530
Just keep in mind,
too many ‘guests‘ are not allowed.

1079
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:52,265
Stop here.

1080
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:55,500
Just a bit ahead.
Take a look.

1081
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,635
Does this look alright?

1082
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:00,644

t‘s a well maintained room.

1083
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,181
Here‘s the key.

1084
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,648
And... registration charges.

1085
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,947
I won‘t vacate this
place before one year.

1086
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,288
Only then will I pay.

1087
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:18,429
Even the owner won‘t ask
you to leave before a year.

1088
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:22,158
Swear on your kids?
- Yes, I swear.

1089
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,207
Bring the luggage in.

1090
01:29:48,283 --> 01:29:51,526
Every society, every institution"

1091
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:54,294
"has the right to
filter ifs members.

1092
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:57,527
Will you allow immoral
characters in your premises.

1093
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,697
..where you are raising your children?

1094
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:00,762
No!

1095
01:30:01,163 --> 01:30:07,239
Mr. Siras lied about being married
and duped his neighbors.

1096
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:10,076
And when his neighbors found out..

1097
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:14,450
..that random men visit him
at untimely hours, they complained.

1098
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:18,787
Why should such immoral
acts impact our children?

1099
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:24,157
Was Prof. Siras carrying
his business out in the playground?

1100
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,361
Why were these people
peeking in his house?

1101
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:30,766
What business do neighbors
have looking into someone‘s bedroom?

1102
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:33,630
And who‘s morality are
we talking about, your lordship?

1103
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:37,206
Because the definition of
morality is open to interpretation.

1104
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:41,078
Those who are vegan,
might consider meat-eaters immoral.

1105
01:30:41,336 --> 01:30:45,716
Married people might
consider divorcees as immoral.

1106
01:30:46,308 --> 01:30:48,754
What is the boundary of morality?

1107
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:52,049
If someone strays out
of one‘s moral boundaries.

1108
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,390
"should he be punished?

1109
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:58,087
Because if that‘s the case,
then every citizen of this country..

1110
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:01,134
..should be in prison for violating
someone else‘s moral boundaries.

1111
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:06,002
We‘re not talking about any
one person‘s morality, Mr. Grover.

1112
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:09,607
We‘re talking about
the collective morality..

1113
01:31:09,665 --> 01:31:12,544
..of the 175 year
old Aligarh University.

1114
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,444

...
...
 understand.
-Yes.

1115
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:15,777
Collective morality.

1116
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:18,073
I would like to tell
my learned friend..

1117
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,587
..that no institution has the right
to invade someone‘s personal life.

1118
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,419
I would like the honorable
judge to refer to..

1119
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,187
..De
hi High Courfs
historic July 2009 judgment..

1120
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:30,253
..in the NAZ foundation
Vs Government of NCT De
hi..

1121
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:34,789
..where Delhi High court
decriminalized homosexuality.

1122
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,566
Even in that case, the opposition‘s
main line of defense was morality.

1123
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:44,200
We argued...that there has to be
a constitutional boundary to morality.

1124
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,142
It must have
constitutional limitations.

1125
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:50,049
Because if we leave it ambiguous.

1126
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:53,650
..peop
e can misuse it
to further their vested interests.

1127
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:58,247
It took us 1O years,
but we won the battle.

1128
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:01,256
While de-criminalizing homosexuality"

1129
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,523
..the division bench stated.

1130
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:06,255
If there is one constitutional tenet..

1131
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,334
..which can be said
to be the underlying theme..

1132
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:12,998
..of the Indian Constitution,
it is that of inclusiveness.

1133
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,141
I beg your pardon, Mr. Grover.

1134
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:20,606
But the section 377 amendment
that you‘re talking about..

1135
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:23,015
"is applicable only in the
Delhi High court.

1136
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:25,348
And this is the Allahabad High court.

1137
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:29,182
And here homosexuality
is still illegal.

1138
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:30,279
It is a crime.

1139
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:32,359
lam very sorry that my
learned friend doesn‘t rea
ize..

1140
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,485
..that the Indian constitution
is equal for everyone.

1141
01:32:34,616 --> 01:32:36,289
Whether its Delhi or A

ahabad..

1142
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:40,197
..any High court order applies
to all the states of India.

1143
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:45,034
Until...it isn‘t challenged in
a particular state, and overruled.

1144
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,034
Therefore the Delhi High court order..

1145
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:52,136
..decrimina
izing homosexuality...is
binding on this court too.

1146
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,374
Thank you, your lordship.

1147
01:33:07,616 --> 01:33:09,220
Namaste!

1148
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:12,427
Prof. Siras, meet Mehmood Naqvi.

1149
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:14,467
Very well known artist from Delhi.

1150
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,337
Thafs Abhilash Tripathi.

1151
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:20,737
Mr. Tripathi is a renowned poet.

1152
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,100
And thafs Prathamesh Sharma.
He‘s a lawyer.

1153
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:27,045
You and me are mere illusions.

1154
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:30,614
Victory and defeat are mere words.

1155
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:33,515
There is no beginning,
nor is there an end.

1156
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:36,019
This moment is the only truth.

1157
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,554
Because...

1158
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:42,618
O beloved moon,
Fear not the dawn that separates us.

1159
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:46,430
For we must meet again,
when the world sleeps.

1160
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:49,362
Thafs my poem.
- I see.

1161
01:33:49,424 --> 01:33:50,630
Really?
- Yes.

1162
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:51,727
Wow.

1163
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,273
I read your book.

1164
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:56,803
It was hard to find.
- Yes, It is very difficult.

1165
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:59,273
Very difficult to get it.

1166
01:33:59,601 --> 01:34:02,172
How did you like the translation?

1167
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,642
English wasn‘t too good.

1168
01:34:06,408 --> 01:34:08,547

‘m a Hindi lawyer, sir.

1169
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:28,765
They are the same people
who signed the petition..

1170
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,237
..and supported you.

1171
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:18,251
Today, I lost myself to ‘Him‘.

1172
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:20,223

t‘s in Marathi, okay?

1173
01:35:21,616 --> 01:35:28,090
Today, I lost myself to ‘Him‘.

1174
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:31,599
Today, I lost myself to ‘him‘.

1175
01:35:33,161 --> 01:35:39,373
At the crack of dawn
‘He‘ came a
ong..

1176
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:45,608
At the crack of dawn
‘He‘ came a
ong..

1177
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:51,150
..and stole my heart.

1178
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:54,682
This morning, Lord Krishna appeared
in my dreams and stole my heart.

1179
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:55,727
Wonderful.

1180
01:35:55,784 --> 01:35:56,785
Wonderful.

1181
01:35:57,018 --> 01:36:03,333
In the midst of my
sweet morning sleep"

1182
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:09,737
In the midst of my
sweet morning sleep"

1183
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:15,615
‘He‘ lifted me gently,
like a fallen flower.

1184
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:18,176
Thafs all"!

1185
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,742
Wonderful.

1186
01:36:24,345 --> 01:36:26,018
This is so embarrassing.

1187
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:27,219
Come on sir!

1188
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:29,352
Have another drink, sir?

1189
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:35,361
Then, who will carry me back
home tonight?

1190
01:36:35,557 --> 01:36:38,231
We‘

 take you, sir.

1191
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:43,542

t‘s quite late, isn‘t it?

1192
01:36:54,776 --> 01:36:56,551
No, I am alright.

1193
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:58,750
lam alright.

1194
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:14,266
Don‘t you have a home?

1195
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:17,505
Not really.

1196
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:21,012
Want to have a drink?

1197
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,115
Now?
- Yeah.

1198
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:27,443
Here?
- You ask too many questions.

1199
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:28,385
Come on.

1200
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:30,614
Come.

1201
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:46,302
So...what‘s wrong?

1202
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:50,639
You look worried.
You rarely go home at night.

1203
01:37:51,099 --> 01:37:52,305
Whafs up?

1204
01:37:54,269 --> 01:37:55,543
No, 
..

1205
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,311

‘m fed up of living as a tenant.

1206
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:02,612

sn‘t this the last
month of your probation?

1207
01:38:03,111 --> 01:38:04,089
Yeah!

1208
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:07,992
So maybe next month
you can rent your own home.

1209
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:11,053

‘m sure you‘

 find something
reasonable here.

1210
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,731
I don‘t know.

1211
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,432
Actua

1212
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:20,496
Money that I borrowed from my father.

1213
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,573
But ifs your dad.
You can return it a few months later.

1214
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:26,510
What difference does it make?
He‘s your dad after all.

1215
01:38:33,975 --> 01:38:36,546
What if someone sees us?
- No one comes here.

1216
01:38:36,611 --> 01:38:38,352
Thafs why I come here.

1217
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,152
There are no cameras here,
So relax!

1218
01:38:43,218 --> 01:38:45,494
Have a sip, you‘

 feel more relaxed.

1219
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,498
My editor Namita..

1220
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:49,535
..she‘

 be really
furious if she finds out.

1221
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:54,096
Your editor Namita, she‘s so boring.

1222
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:56,432
Really. She doesn‘t have a life.

1223
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:58,773
She‘s always in the office.

1224
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,239
Thafs true.

1225
01:39:01,636 --> 01:39:03,411
Sure?
- Go for it.

1226
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:04,506
Thank you.

1227
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,056
You‘re okay, right?

1228
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,531
What happened?

1229
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:24,329
Have you..

1230
01:39:25,593 --> 01:39:28,005
..never been with a woman before?

1231
01:39:58,727 --> 01:40:02,470
