1
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:37,399
- I did it in fun.
- Is he of your age?

2
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,276
Nobody's of my age here.

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,337
He's being a pest!
Keep him with you. Go now!

4
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,347
- You forgot me, eh?
- How can anyone forget you?

5
00:01:58,037 --> 00:02:03,906
You don't look a mother of a six
year old boy. You look sweet 16!

6
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,037
This is your son, right?
My dear darling child...

7
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:15,531
Now give a kiss to Aunty.
Come on.

8
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,057
He bit me!

9
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,849
Haven't you taught him
any manners or etiquettes?

10
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,499
An absolute brute!

11
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,709
Your son here, bit my cheek!
He should be thrown out!

12
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:38,969
Send him to a Reform-school.

13
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,838
- Apologise!
- No!

14
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,871
What if somebody forces
you to kiss?

15
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:51,245
Hey! He's just a kid.
Does one hit a kid like this?

16
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:56,731
- Shut up! Is this your upbringing?
- Hush! I didn't teach him to be rude.

17
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:02,255
- A kid's conduct is a mother's job.
- When have you let me be a mother?

18
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:16,487
Two woolens coats.

19
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:20,669
6 vests.

20
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,118
6 underwears.

21
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,333
3 coloured jerseys.

22
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:38,123
Convince the Master, Madam.
How will he stay without his parents?

23
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:44,107
Didn't you think of this before?
We trusted you with him...

24
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,135
... and he got spoilt.
We never realised that you...

25
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:52,930
... that you're a servant here,
and not his mother.

26
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,920
I may not be his mother,
but I was like a mother to him.

27
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,485
And if that's the case,
excuse me for being blunt...

28
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,127
But you didn't even breast-feed him.
Are you a mother?

29
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,813
Today I'm really very happy,
but very sad too.

30
00:04:54,271 --> 00:05:00,217
Sad because you've been with me for
so many years, and I love you all.

31
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:05,473
But today, my heart is
heavy to bid you goodbye.

32
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:11,955
I'm also glad to see you all step
in this world in the real sense.

33
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:16,789
From today your life is your own.
I'll remind you once more...

34
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:20,434
... that you've to find your ways
and your goals, yourself.

35
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:25,075
Take your decisions, yourself.
Believe me...

36
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,949
... success is simply impatient
to come to you.

37
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,834
What's your programme?
Staying back for the function?

38
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,248
I want to and I've sought my
parent's permission. Let's see.

39
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:53,156
There's our principal who tells
us to take our own decisions...

40
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:57,222
... and here's Mama's boy, who has
to seek permission to enjoy them?

41
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,132
These are our fun days.
Why seek permission to enjoy them?

42
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:21,083
You're very late. How was the party?
- Very nice.

43
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:26,262
- Are you staying up for me?
- No. I had some work to finish.

44
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,024
Go and sleep.
I'll come later.

45
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:33,665
There are some letters for you
on the table. Take them.

46
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,629
- It's from Raja.
- What says he?

47
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,315
That his papers have gone well.

48
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:55,646
And asks, "Can I stay back for
our farewell function on the 24th?"

49
00:06:56,376 --> 00:07:00,787
24th? When is his birthday?

50
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,194
- On the 23rd.
- 23rd? Then how can he stay back?

51
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:12,027
No. I'm going to celebrate
his birthday very grandly.

52
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:16,861
It's a good excuse to invite
my clients and business friends.

53
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:23,114
Also, he'll come to know the ropes
by socialising with people here.

54
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,452
Inform him to come
back immediately.

55
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:32,359
Well, Mama's boy...
All packed and ready to go, eh?

56
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:37,077
Yes. My parents wish that
I reach home by the 23rd.

57
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,760
- It's my birthday.
- Really?

58
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:43,369
How old will you be?
- 18!

59
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,504
Don't be funny.
You still have your milk-teeth!

60
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,491
- I'm doing some work.
- Must be penning a poem.

61
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,363
People go out in the evenings to
seek a muse for their poetry.

62
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:06,040
And this guy here...
Come, I'll show you something.

63
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,143
To hell with you!
I've brought a poetry in motion!

64
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,135
One look, and you'll pen
ten odes to her!

65
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:23,073
I'll burn that diary of yours!
Can't you spare me a moment?

66
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,096
Come on.

67
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,198
Look towards the gate.

68
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,686
- There's a limit to...
- Listen, will you?

69
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:44,249
Cool it. You've your whole life
to pen poetry. But a girl like...

70
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:49,657
Aren't you ashamed?
What if your parents find out?

71
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,455
Don't get worked up now.
Are our parents losing sleep over us?

72
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:58,634
I tell the truth, that's why
people get disturbed.

73
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,931
Tell me the truth. Do you
love your parents? Be honest.

74
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,457
I don't lie!

75
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:16,856
Shall I tell you? You don't love
them, because they don't love you!

76
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:22,456
Love begets love. They had you,
and then dumped you here!

77
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,830
Who has the time nowadays to
hold their kids to their hearts?

78
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:31,050
The world is moving fast, and,
we all have to keep up with it.

79
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,461
I want to be with the world.

80
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,758
I must find a friend a, who
won't ditch me when eed arises.

81
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:00,243
- I'm home.
- Hello, sir.

82
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:01,356
Where's my Mummy?

83
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,501
She had a meeting to attend.
She asked me to look after you.

84
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:08,721
- And Daddy must be in his office.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,864
Bless you. How you've grown!
A chip of the old block!

86
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:23,372
Happy? I was worried that the party
is tomorrow and still no sign of you.

87
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,595
- Thought we'd have to cancel it.
- That would've been a problem.

88
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,315
Okay son, I'll go now.
I've some important work pending.

89
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:36,607
Listen, I too left the meeting
half way. They'll wait for me.

90
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,602
- I'm late as it is.
- Come along then.

91
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,581
Okay, take a wash and have lunch.
See you in the evening.

92
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,037
And if you need anything,
beckon Ramdhin.

93
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:02,003
Love begets love. They had
you and dumped you here!

94
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,644
Who has the time nowadays to
clasp their kids to their bosoms?

95
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,633
- You're all dolled-up.
- Why?

96
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:27,628
Waiting for someone, eh?

97
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:33,228
- Your son's not to be seen.
- I was about to say the same.

98
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,873
He's a bit shy. There were
no girls in his class, you see.

99
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:42,781
Please go upstairs and call him.
I've to attend to my guests.

100
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,568
- Which room?
- The one on your right.

101
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,682
- What is it?
- Nothing.

102
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,674
- Has he bathed?
- Sure...

103
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,357
What's all this? I'll get him.

104
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,117
No, I'll call him myself.

105
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:54,019
You're knocking my door now?
Didn't you know it earlier?

106
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,309
I knew, but...
Well, I didn't know that...

107
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,724
... you'd treat your home,
like your boarding school.

108
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:06,870
Pass me that gown, please.

109
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,142
Who are you and what are
you doing here?

110
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,252
I'm Neema.

111
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,472
I'm a dancer and
run a dancing school.

112
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:31,152
- I'm your mom's Bridge partner too.
- My mom, and the party's downstairs.

113
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,756
I know. Your mom has called
you downstairs immediately.

114
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,746
At once? Like this?
You go ahead. I'll come later.

115
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:56,817
Wait here.
I'll just come.

116
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,845
Excuse me for coming uninvited.
Congratulations for today.

117
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:03,335
Raj, I've baked a cake for Raja.
A sponge cake. His favourite.

118
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:06,519
Take this from her.

119
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,904
- Happy Birthday, Sonny.
- Congratulations.

120
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,637
Congratulations...
Happy birthday.

121
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:10,238
Now come along.
Give a kiss to your Aunty.

122
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,724
Hold on. You won't
bite my cheek, will you?

123
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:19,752
Why are you gaping at him?
When you were a kid...

124
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,933
you had bitten my cheek.
And I had screamed...

125
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,922
Help! He bit my cheek.

126
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:32,181
He's not a kid any more.
Just gave his Senior Cambridge.

127
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:37,129
Is that so? Then it's okay.
Come along then. Give me a kiss.

128
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,947
Naughty boy! Anyway...
It's okay you did it to me.

129
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:53,241
But don't try it on a girl, else,
she'll give you a sound beating.

130
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,231
I won't beat you!

131
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,804
I know a secret about Raj...

132
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:20,017
which is not known by anybody.
And I'm happy to share with you all.

133
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:25,811
And the secret is that Raj doesn't
just have a beautiful body...

134
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:30,567
- What are you doing?
... but a wonderful heart too.

135
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:36,667
And this is proved by the fact
that Raj is a good poet...

136
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:40,848
... and pens lovely poems.
On all your behalf...

137
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:45,797
I now request him to recite
a song, a poem, a couplet...

138
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,824
No... I don't know any poem.
I've never penned any couplet...

139
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:56,269
- Have you taken over my life?
- Recite or sing it.

140
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,108
If I say I can't sing,
You'll get some proof that I can!

141
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,290
- You mean you can sing too?
- Yes. He sings and I dance.

142
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,226
"I'm no poet"

143
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,482
"I'm no poet"

144
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,543
"But my pretty one... "

145
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:15,102
"ever since I have seen you... "

146
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,322
"poetry has just come to me"

147
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,104
"I'm no lover either"

148
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,860
"But dear lovely one... "

149
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:54,615
"ever since I set eyes on you... "

150
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,259
"I've become a lover"

151
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:03,323
"I'm no poet"

152
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:28,910
"I had heard of love, no doubt"

153
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:33,935
"But I didn't know
what it was"

154
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:47,937
"I remained confused
as confusions generally are... "

155
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,001
"and remained an enemy
in friends"

156
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,183
"But I'm no foe... "

157
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:06,543
"but dear pretty one... "

158
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:09,765
"having seen you... "

159
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:15,865
"I have learnt to make friends"

160
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:20,890
"I'm no poet"

161
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:55,262
"Had I really prayed... "

162
00:22:55,914 --> 00:23:00,288
"and lifted my hands...
what would I have asked for?"

163
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,983
"But ever since I've fallen
in love with you... "

164
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:19,277
"I've begun to pray"

165
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:23,573
"But I'm no atheist"

166
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,754
"I'm no disbeliever in God"

167
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:32,626
"But dear lovely one... "

168
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:38,304
"Ever since I have seen you... "

169
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,641
"I have come to believe"

170
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,322
"I'm no poet"

171
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:51,309
"But my dear pretty one... "

172
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:56,602
"ever since I have set
my eyes on you... "

173
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:00,324
"poetry just came to me"

174
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,888
"I'm no poet"

175
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:22,688
See? All the richie-rich had
come to celebrate your birthday.

176
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,793
See the presents? There's no room
to keep them! Where are you going?

177
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:30,629
- To bed! I'm fagged out.
- So am I.

178
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,046
You also relax, son.

179
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:00,704
The same aroma...
Exactly the same.

180
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,747
I know Aunty,
but who's this Bobby?

181
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,604
He has gone out, Master Raj.
What can I do for you?

182
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:28,440
- Do you know where this Aunty lives?
- Which Aunty?

183
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:32,928
Mrs Braganza, who was my
governess when I was a baby.

184
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:37,647
I came here later. Ramdhin must
be knowing. Shall I call him?

185
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,600
No, don't bother.
I'll find out for myself.

186
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,204
- Who is it?
- It's me.

187
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:02,428
Me? Who's me?

188
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,451
Well?

189
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:22,108
- Well, say something.
- You, and here?

190
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:27,977
Me? Where else will I be?
But, you?

191
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:33,003
Aunty...
Aunty lives here, doesn't she?

192
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:37,491
- Aunty? Yours or mine?
- Mine. Mrs Braganza.

193
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,480
- Yes, she stays here... so?
- Well... I just...

194
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:44,472
What 'just'? Hurry up.
My oil's burning.

195
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:49,459
Who is it?
- God knows. Some nephew of an Aunty!

196
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,521
What do you want?
Tell me. Whom do you want?

197
00:26:56,556 --> 00:27:00,508
I won't. You tell me, why
didn't you meet me on my birthday?

198
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,917
Raja? My darling child?!

199
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:15,430
Such a small bundle of joy
grew up to be so big? Bend down.

200
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,883
I can't see you properly.
Dear Lord...

201
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,530
Save him from my evil eye.

202
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:27,629
A mother never looks at her kids
with an evil eye, Aunty.

203
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:34,573
You call me Aunty and mother in
one breath, eh? Sit down now.

204
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:39,867
- I had left a cake for you. Eat it?
- That's why I ran here for more.

205
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,552
- Is there any left?
- Of course.

206
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:46,082
You mean you came for my cake?

207
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:50,339
But of course.
To eat the cake, and...

208
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:53,370
... and, make friends with
your son, Bobby.

209
00:27:55,595 --> 00:28:02,769
My son? He's of your Dad's age.
His name is Jack. And Bobby...

210
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,246
Want to be friends with me?

211
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:19,417
- A bin!
- What?

212
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:24,712
Nothing. There's a fat girl in
our class. We call her a "Bin".

213
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:27,934
Actually her name is Jyoti.
Like yours is Raja.

214
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:33,343
- Be polite. Call him Master Raja.
- It's all the same, Gran.

215
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,029
- Isn't it?
- Yes, yes it is.

216
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,212
She's very naughty.
She's always asking about you.

217
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:42,434
Who? Where? How?

218
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:45,887
And that cake I made for you...
She signed her name on that too!

219
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:51,641
- Yes, I had seen it.
- Do you still draw?

220
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:58,892
Gran says you had used a man's
black coat as a black board once.

221
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:02,651
You had drawn a big figure on it.

222
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:06,372
There was a woman...
What was her name?

223
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:14,658
- Do you remember biting her?
- Yes, and she had screamed...

224
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:19,645
No wonder you were
punished so severely!

225
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,556
- Punished?
- Yes. Your Daddy thought...

226
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,899
you unfit to stay at home.

227
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,466
- So he sent you to a boarding.
- What nonsense, Bobby.

228
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,304
Don't listen to her, son.
She just blabbers.

229
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,837
Is this true?

230
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,906
- Why you haven't eaten any cake.
- Don't avoid the issue.

231
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:41,013
Was I sent to the boarding school
as a punishment?

232
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:47,688
Yes, son.
I tried my best to stop them.

233
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:53,097
But I was a servant after all.
Nobody listened to me.

234
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:59,426
Anyway, today you've become
such a smart boy.

235
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:01,459
Makes you happy, doesn't it?

236
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:10,359
Listen, won't you have tea?

237
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:15,346
What for?

238
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,032
You told me something I didn't know.

239
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:30,730
- Okay then, I'll go now.
- How long will you be in London?

240
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:34,067
It's a business trip, so I'll be
away for at least 2-3 weeks.

241
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:37,980
That reminds me, I've decided
to send Raja to zzzLondon too.

242
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,394
- What are you punishing me for now?
- Punishing you?

243
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,006
Yes.

244
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:46,918
I've heard that I was sent to the
Boarding School as a punishment.

245
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:50,332
- Who told you?
- Aunty Mrs Braganza.

246
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,977
- Is it a lie?
- So! You've begun...

247
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,741
to sit with the servants already.

248
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,347
She's not a servant, I look
up to her as a mother.

249
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,641
You didn't bring me up.
She did!

250
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,167
Hear that?

251
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:31,878
A bin!

252
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,949
Our books got exchanged.

253
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:57,542
Yes. My book has a cover just
like this one, you see.

254
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,654
My book, stupid.

255
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,502
Will you get lost now?
Only members are allowed here.

256
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:33,832
- Then make me a member too.
- People come here to study, not chat.

257
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:37,361
Then where does one go to chat?

258
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:43,997
- Outside the library.
- Then come on outside.

259
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:18,444
- Why did you flash a mirror?
- You weren't getting up, that's why.

260
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:22,970
- Do nice boys do such a thing?
- Am I a nice boy then?

261
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:26,270
- No, a very bad boy!
- Okay, let's do one thing.

262
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,952
Let's have some tea. I'm told,
hot tea, cools one down in summer.

263
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,942
No! We'll eat some
roasted gram first.

264
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,788
Won't you sit inside?

265
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:54,005
Gran says good girls don't sit
there when out on a first date.

266
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:02,330
- Why don't you say you're scared.
- What! You think I'm scared?

267
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,012
Look at these... my teeth?
How are they?

268
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:10,117
They're nice; which toothpaste
do you use?

269
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:11,996
Dummy! They're sharp.

270
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:15,794
They can cut a raw guava
in half, in one bite!

271
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:18,365
- So?
- See these nails?

272
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:20,014
They're very pointed.

273
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:24,004
- So?
- Times have changed Dummy!

274
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,806
I'm a girl of the 21st Century.

275
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:29,988
- But it's still the 20th!
- That's history. I'm from the 21st!

276
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:33,364
I know how to defend myself.
Nobody can touch me!

277
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:36,203
- Why not?
- Let him just try it!

278
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,033
Oh! Where did she drop here from?

279
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:06,701
Let go of my hand!

280
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,460
Hadn't you said something
about biting a cheek...

281
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:13,068
What! I said something about
biting a cheek?

282
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,332
Softly...

283
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,472
Hadn't you told me I was punished
for having bitten a woman's cheek?

284
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:25,075
- That's her out there.
- Really? I want to see her...

285
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,096
Have pity on your Dummy.
If she sees me with you...

286
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:34,244
... I'll be punished for
the rest of my life too!

287
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,495
Go away! Go on.

288
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,642
- Lift your legs.
- What!

289
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:00,100
My goodness!

290
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,782
Why should I lift my legs up?
I'm not scared. I'm leaving!

291
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:06,928
Listen...
Listen to me Bobby.

292
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:36,160
You! Mr Nath's son?

293
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:40,955
- Who was that girl?
- Which girl?

294
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:44,177
- The one that left just now.
- Can't recall.

295
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,670
Just went up.

296
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,471
- Towards the beach.
- She's...

297
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,156
Go and enjoy yourself then.
Go on...

298
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,997
- Well, see how I fooled you?
- You're great Bobby.

299
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:13,217
- I've never seen a girl like you.
- How many girls do you know then?

300
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:16,209
Me? Hundreds of them.

301
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:25,722
Well, if not hundreds, I know
at least a dozen very well.

302
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:35,083
Actually... I know just one.

303
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:41,336
You, Bobby.

304
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:39,337
You, and here?

305
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:45,359
Why did you run away while playing?
Because you saw me?

306
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:50,116
Shall I tell you the truth,
or make some excuse?

307
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:55,985
- Those who lie are bitten by a crow.
- Then I better tell you the truth!

308
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:03,926
Do you know why I ran away
from the badminton court?

309
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,077
Why?

310
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:10,102
I got nervous when I saw you.

311
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,974
This heart...
It is on the left side, isn't it?

312
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:17,813
I felt as though it had come
in my throat.

313
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:21,343
I got very scared.

314
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:26,559
But why did you get scared?

315
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,276
I don't know.

316
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,410
Think, and tell me.

317
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,121
We're being watched.

318
00:43:59,852 --> 00:44:04,532
"I want to say something.
- So do l"

319
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:10,210
"I want to tell you something.
- So do l"

320
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:12,052
"You first
- No, you first"

321
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:16,539
"You, you, you, you...
- You, you, you you... "

322
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:22,562
"Look, just like those two men,
who, by saying... "

323
00:44:23,252 --> 00:44:26,552
"you first", "no, you first"
had missed the train... "

324
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:33,035
"like that, we too may miss
this beautiful season"

325
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,562
"Okay, I'll say it"

326
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:42,127
"Like any other girl
in this situation... "

327
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,574
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16... "

328
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:54,249
"That's what I want
to say to you"

329
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:58,200
"Like any other boy
in this situation... "

330
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:02,305
"would say to a girl
of 16... "

331
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:08,596
"that's what I want to
say to you"

332
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:46,038
"I can't sleep,
nor is my heart at peace... "

333
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:51,638
"I wait for you...
I simply wait for you"

334
00:45:52,674 --> 00:45:57,123
"Nothing seems nice
without you... "

335
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:02,073
"It all seems so false...
so untrue"

336
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:06,676
"I don't feel at ease at home,
nor out anywhere"

337
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:12,123
"I'm sitting at one place,
and lost somewhere else"

338
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:17,686
"But not to say anything and
just keep silent... No! No!"

339
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:22,673
"It's so difficult now
to keep silent"

340
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:29,616
"I've to tell you something.
- So do I... "

341
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:56,354
"I've nothing to do
the whole day... "

342
00:46:56,776 --> 00:47:01,456
"but to think of you,
or to call out to you"

343
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:06,865
"All the colours in this world
seem so dull"

344
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:11,737
"Only your words sound so sweet"

345
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:16,724
"I live, so I can adore you"

346
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:21,711
"I live only for your consent"

347
00:47:22,747 --> 00:47:27,388
"But not to say anything and
just keep quiet... No! No!"

348
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:32,375
"It's difficult now
to keep silent"

349
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:39,549
"I want to say something...
- So do l"

350
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,776
"Where there are no thorns... "

351
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:15,801
"let's go and stay there"

352
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:21,786
"Where there is no fear
for us to meet"

353
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:26,811
"Where there's no home for me,
but you, my beloved"

354
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:31,184
"Is there such a place
on this earth?"

355
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:36,785
"Let's leave the matter here,
and now... "

356
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:42,693
"but not to say anything now,
and keep quiet... No! No!"

357
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:46,797
"It's difficult now
to keep silent anymore"

358
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:53,894
"Like any other girl
in such situation... "

359
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,846
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16... "

360
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:04,827
"Say to him...
- That's what I wish to say"

361
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:10,735
"When a girl...
- When a boy... "

362
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:14,840
"Like any other girl...
- In such a situation"

363
00:49:54,237 --> 00:49:55,656
Look, the boss is here.

364
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:04,671
He's a workaholic.
Else, where's the need to?

365
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:21,090
I've got first class fish.
Make good money.

366
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,509
Right, Boss.

367
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:26,920
Boss, my foot! I'm Jack.
You dare forget it!

368
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:35,935
Shall I keep this in Papa's room?

369
00:50:37,778 --> 00:50:40,922
- What are you thinking about?
- I feeling very uneasy.

370
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:44,912
- What about? Papa won't refuse.
- I don't mean Jack.

371
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:47,560
- Then?
- I meant Mr Nath.

372
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:50,129
He's a rich man, dear.

373
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:53,429
Don't know whether he'll approve
of you and Raja mixing like this.

374
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:58,185
Oh Gran! Why should he mind?
Nonsense.

375
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:15,679
- Bobby's going to Kashmir, eh?
- No, she doesn't want to go.

376
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:18,633
- Why not?
- She doesn't want to.

377
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,241
Okay, but what's all this then?

378
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:24,808
- Raja is coming to pick her up.
- Which Raja?

379
00:51:26,612 --> 00:51:29,987
Mr Nath's son.
He's taking her to a movie.

380
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:31,982
He is coming to take
permission of you.

381
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:39,655
That wee thing has become big
enough to date my Bobby?

382
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,680
- You don't mind, do you?
- Does he want permission, or you?

383
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:50,703
- I've pressed your suit for you.
- Suit? What for?

384
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,004
What's the occasion?

385
00:51:56,035 --> 00:52:01,559
You know I wear a suit only twice.
For weddings and funerals. Why now?

386
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,011
You'll look very nice, won't you,
wearing that in Raja's presence!

387
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:09,883
I see.
He's a rich man's son, eh?

388
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,446
Can't wear this in front of him, eh?
These are my working clothes.

389
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:19,666
I work, so I earn and keep
the hearth burning!

390
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,770
He'll feel ashamed to see me
in these clothes, eh?

391
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:28,297
And you'll go to a movie
with my permission? No!

392
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:36,276
I told you I won't come.
Don't worry.

393
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:38,041
Your dad's away.

394
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:41,647
If I go away too, you'll be
all alone and get bored here.

395
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:44,025
- Come with me.
- No, Mom.

396
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:47,286
You go. I'll prepare for college.

397
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:54,804
I was coming to see you,
and you're running away?

398
00:52:56,455 --> 00:52:57,912
I've some important work.

399
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,709
Promise. You'll come and
I'll let you go.

400
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:04,587
- What's the occasion?
- A party.

401
00:53:05,585 --> 00:53:06,888
You'll come, won't you?

402
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,344
- Yes he will.
- Oh, Mom...

403
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:30,097
Master Raja?
Come in. Sit down.

404
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:33,550
Bobby, Master Raja's here.

405
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:42,756
- He's here, Jack.
- I heard.

406
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,167
This is Master Raja.

407
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,159
Get a glass, Mom.

408
00:54:48,432 --> 00:54:50,158
Want to say something to me?

409
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:56,602
- Well... I want to see a movie.
- Go ahead.

410
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:02,434
- Well I... Aunty...
- Talking to her, or me?

411
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:09,991
I'm talking to you, sir.
If you allow me to...

412
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:14,901
... I'd like... Aunty... I'd like
to take Aunty to the movies!

413
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:18,431
You'll take my Mom out
to the movies?

414
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:23,686
No sir.
What I meant was...

415
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:29,785
I'd like to take Bobby out.
If you permit me, of course.

416
00:55:37,343 --> 00:55:40,489
- No, you may not!
- Why not papa.

417
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:45,782
Because if he takes you out,
he'll show you a movie, dine out.

418
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:48,353
Spend money. Right?

419
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:52,918
That's why I'm against it.
Understand?

420
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:55,066
If you want to date her...

421
00:55:55,296 --> 00:55:58,902
you'll go Dutch.

422
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,235
- That's not necessary, son.
- It is, Mom.

423
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,835
Look Mom, you worked
in his house. Fine.

424
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:15,666
But I didn't. If he's rich, fine.
I've my place too.

425
00:56:18,888 --> 00:56:24,298
I've collected enough money
for my daughter's happiness.

426
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:27,290
- Why discuss all this?
- No need.

427
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:30,972
Give us a kiss, dear.

428
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:39,297
You'll both share the cost.
Accounts must be clear.

429
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,941
See that he doesn't cheat you.
Understand?

430
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:16,047
- I can read.
- So?

431
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:17,850
So, we go back home.

432
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:22,301
I've taken your Dada's permission.
Do we go back without enjoying?

433
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:27,172
- What do you mean?
- Sit. We'll go to a party.

434
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:57,516
- I'm finding this all weird.
- Aren't you a 21st century girl?

435
00:57:58,398 --> 00:57:59,779
This is common in a party.

436
00:58:09,102 --> 00:58:10,367
- Come, let's dance.
- No...

437
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,902
We'll meet again then.

438
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:15,930
- Didn't recognise me?
- No.

439
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,999
I'm Chanda. Your B-day party...

440
00:58:25,827 --> 00:58:29,394
You're looking all lost.
Looking for Neema?

441
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:31,773
- Yes, can't see her.
- Must be around here.

442
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:39,407
Where were you all this time?
I was waiting so eagerly for you.

443
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:48,690
Where did you pick up such
a lovely girl?

444
00:58:49,419 --> 00:58:50,800
She's Bobby.

445
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,949
- Who asked her name?
- I told you myself.

446
00:58:53,485 --> 00:58:57,974
Anyway... I can't bear to see you
with somebody else tonight.

447
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:03,038
Come.

448
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,751
Standing all alone at
this beautiful moment?

449
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:15,735
Great style, beloved!

450
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,341
- One coke...
- Why not champagne?

451
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:20,953
Shut up! Be polite.

452
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:27,244
Polite, eh? It's an insult if one
doesn't tease a beautiful girl.

453
00:59:27,935 --> 00:59:30,312
But I'm not impolite either.

454
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:36,183
- Looking out for Raja?
- Do you know him?

455
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:40,478
Very well. We were together
in the hostel. One scotch, please.

456
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:46,309
I used to lure many girls...
And him! Old Scrooge! Miser!

457
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:51,488
But how much has he given you?
I can offer you much more.

458
00:59:54,596 --> 00:59:58,164
Will you come with me tonight?
You dare do this?

459
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:03,495
- Let go! I'm not of that sort.
- If not, then why are you here?

460
01:00:04,454 --> 01:00:07,485
- Didn't he tell you before?
- He didn't know it himself!

461
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:12,664
He knows everything. One comes here
with one, and leaves with another.

462
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:16,308
- See how he entered her bedroom?
- He's not like that.

463
01:00:16,577 --> 01:00:18,533
Come and see.

464
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:22,523
I'm up to my gills in love.
And...

465
01:00:23,213 --> 01:00:26,512
And I don't want to come out.
I want to sink deeper in it.

466
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:32,228
I'm telling you the truth.
I want to marry.

467
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:39,901
Why bring marriage into this?
It's all nonsense.

468
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:44,312
And I'm much older than you.
How can you marry me?

469
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:47,535
But yes, we could be lovers.

470
01:00:55,591 --> 01:01:02,572
You're mistaken, I meant Bobby.
I love her very much.

471
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,836
I want to marry her.

472
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:26,623
How dare you behave so cheaply
with an innocent girl like that?

473
01:02:26,853 --> 01:02:30,804
What I do is cheap and when you
take him to your room is morality!

474
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:55,931
- You're back, my dear?
- Yes, Gran.

475
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,691
So soon? It was well, wasn't it?

476
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,685
Yes, Gran.
It was just fine.

477
01:03:45,763 --> 01:03:48,525
Didn't you go to leave Bobby
at the station?

478
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,709
- To Leave Bobby?
- Yes, she's gone to Kashmir.

479
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,307
But she had said she won't
be going.

480
01:03:58,537 --> 01:04:00,570
I don't know.
Last night she said...

481
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,714
she wanted to go.
The train leaves at noon.

482
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:07,629
- How will you reach the station?
- I'll reach.

483
01:04:08,742 --> 01:04:12,155
Be careful, son.
You may fall.

484
01:04:26,272 --> 01:04:30,761
Don't be angry with me.
It wasn't my fault. Please...

485
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:43,761
Listen to me.

486
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,123
Tell me, what's the matter?
At least tell me what I've done!

487
01:06:52,123 --> 01:06:56,382
You've played with my feelings.
You're rich...

488
01:06:56,957 --> 01:07:00,908
For you love may be a game,
But I wasn't from your lot.

489
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:03,785
Why did you do this?
Why?

490
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:08,581
Don't touch me!

491
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:14,181
Let go of my hand!

492
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,445
Let go of my hand, I say!

493
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:22,736
- What happened, dear?
- Nothing...

494
01:07:25,537 --> 01:07:29,104
He has teased her!
She was yelling "Let me go!"

495
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,528
Eve-teaser, eh?
Shameless being!

496
01:07:43,988 --> 01:07:48,438
You manhandle a guest?
Rascal! Cad! Tease a girl?

497
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:50,970
You cur!

498
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,957
How did you come here?

499
01:07:59,754 --> 01:08:05,548
Shameless rascal! Cur!
Don't ever come here. Get lost!

500
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:10,228
"Break down temples and mosques,
if you wish"

501
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:16,366
"So says the Sufi Saint Buleshah"

502
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:38,730
"But do not break a heart
full of love... "

503
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:44,370
"for it is the heart
in which the beloved lives"

504
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:54,036
"The scales in which you
have weighed love... "

505
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:58,026
"the scales in which you have
weighed your love... "

506
01:08:59,062 --> 01:09:02,667
"never weigh your
wealth in it"

507
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:06,849
"God forbid...
I shall not talk about it"

508
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:08,940
"I shall never... "

509
01:09:35,544 --> 01:09:37,222
"There's fire within
both concerned"

510
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:51,541
"But fire can be doused
with water"

511
01:09:52,960 --> 01:10:05,082
"But when tears flowed
down the beloved's cheeks... "

512
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,492
"it fanned the fires even more"

513
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:19,123
"I'd rather sit in front
of you and cry... "

514
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:27,102
"I sat and cried in front of you.
But didn't express my sorrow"

515
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:38,112
"No, I won't open my mouth!
Not say a word"

516
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:48,162
"God forbid...
I won't say a word"

517
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:54,147
"I won't say a word"

518
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:58,175
"I too won't say anything"

519
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:00,093
"No, not a word"

520
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:38,876
- Madam, this horse is frisky.
- Then I won't ride it!

521
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:42,635
This horse is very temperamental.
If you're a good...

522
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:44,017
I know!

523
01:12:10,563 --> 01:12:13,862
Bobby!
Stop, Bobby.

524
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:19,693
Stop!

525
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:52,339
- I want to die.
- Open your eyes... you're okay?

526
01:12:52,684 --> 01:12:56,022
I don't want to live.
I don't wish to come in your way.

527
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,937
You are my way, and,
my destination too!

528
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:00,817
Liar!

529
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:04,308
If I hadn't seen with my own eyes,
I'd have still fell for this line.

530
01:13:05,037 --> 01:13:08,029
I'd have believed you've never
expressed your love to anybody else.

531
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,131
- But don't you want to marry Neema?
- Enough!

532
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,118
I respect her. I was talking
to her about marrying you!

533
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:24,985
But not anymore. You believed
what you saw, but...

534
01:13:25,713 --> 01:13:28,475
Did you think what would've
happened to me, had you died?

535
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:32,695
I'd have just committed suicide,
what else?

536
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:37,989
Forgive me, Raju.

537
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,045
- What's this, Raju?
- Say that again.

538
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:52,681
Nobody has called me
'Raju' before.

539
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,364
I'll call you 'Raju'
Always...

540
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:18,959
Nothing serious. Just
knocked out. Please help me.

541
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:24,560
- She's lucky to be saved.
- It was a 1,000 feet drop!

542
01:14:27,437 --> 01:14:29,087
Just superficial abrasions.

543
01:14:32,808 --> 01:14:37,833
- She's still out cold however!
- Lucky that he was there, else...

544
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:42,168
He's valiant, no doubt.
What a man!

545
01:14:43,587 --> 01:14:47,385
My pony refused to bolt! Else,
wouldn't he have saved me too?

546
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:52,066
Had he saved me,
I'd have... just died!

547
01:14:53,753 --> 01:14:59,086
- What are you talking about?
- You! you've really obliged us.

548
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:03,727
Not at all...
It was my duty.

549
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:11,438
- Where am I?
- Don't panic.

550
01:15:11,668 --> 01:15:13,432
You're in your bed. Hale and hearty.

551
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,335
- Who are you?
- He only saved your life.

552
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:23,445
Endangering his own.

553
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,698
How can I ever thank you, Mr...

554
01:15:30,465 --> 01:15:33,918
Raj Nath.
Pet name, Raju.

555
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:44,275
- Let me see you out.
- Why do you bother?

556
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:46,079
No bother.

557
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:51,487
- Trying to be a hero to them, eh?
- You're unnecessarily...

558
01:15:52,408 --> 01:15:54,671
- What am I worth?
- Worthless!

559
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,012
- I'll show you tomorrow.
- What time?

560
01:15:57,012 --> 01:15:58,776
- It's 12 O' clock.
- What?

561
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:00,464
Didn't you just ask the time?

562
01:17:23,594 --> 01:17:26,586
That girl over there in red.
One in the centre.

563
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:32,570
With long hair.
Go give her this chit.

564
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:37,596
Bobby, see what I bought.

565
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:48,605
- Your letter, Miss.
- What?

566
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,582
Listen everyone, come here.
See what this says.

567
01:17:58,195 --> 01:18:02,761
"Meeting like this is futile. Dump
these girls and come to the club".

568
01:18:03,643 --> 01:18:05,984
This is the same boy
who saved you yesterday.

569
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:07,479
No, can't be him.

570
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:10,279
It's written right here.
"Yours, and only yours, Raju".

571
01:18:12,697 --> 01:18:15,228
He was a gentleman yesterday,
and being Romeo today, eh?

572
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:20,637
- Such guys should be thrashed.
- Come, let's give him a hiding!

573
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:24,320
- Forget it! Why bother?
- What do you mean?

574
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:29,307
- Come alone, eh? Sure I will!
- Let's beat him up. You too Bobby.

575
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:32,376
No, I can't bear to see
thrashings. You all go.

576
01:18:32,683 --> 01:18:33,642
Coward!

577
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:36,212
- Come girls, let's go
- Yes, come on.

578
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:36,977
There he is!

579
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:40,737
Wait, you scoundrel!
I'll show you yet.

580
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:47,718
- You!
- If you want to live, let's run!

581
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:31,758
- Must be here somewhere.
- Yes. He has lured Bobby at last.

582
01:20:33,599 --> 01:20:36,514
Where will he go? He'll forget
his madness once we catch him.

583
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,767
- There's nobody here.
- She's innocent.

584
01:20:43,035 --> 01:20:46,373
- We must protect her.
- Yes, let's go find them.

585
01:20:47,524 --> 01:20:50,785
- What's the matter, girls?
- A cad has kidnapped a girl.

586
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:53,009
- Here? No...
- He came here.

587
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:57,152
- I saw with my own eyes.
- Nonsense! I'm a watchman here.

588
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:03,598
Now go along. Don't pester me.
I've to lock up now.

589
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:11,270
What are you peering in for?
I've to go to the market.

590
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:14,799
It takes me 3 hours, to and fro.
It'll be late when I return. Go...

591
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:24,735
The watchman said it'll take
3 hours to come and go.

592
01:21:26,346 --> 01:21:28,494
Oh God! I think I'll die.

593
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:33,827
- What will I tell my teacher?
- Your friends will tell her that!

594
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:39,043
Don't tease me.
Think how to get out of here.

595
01:22:05,896 --> 01:22:08,045
All the doors and
windows are locked!

596
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:15,909
What are you laughing about?
Think of something.

597
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,466
- That's what I'm doing.
- What?

598
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:27,610
"Nobody can come in...
from the outside"

599
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,750
"Nobody can go out...
from the inside"

600
01:22:34,438 --> 01:22:37,430
"Think what would happen
in such a situation"

601
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:44,910
"You and I... "

602
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:50,933
"Both locked in a room"

603
01:22:54,578 --> 01:22:56,573
"And the key gets lost"

604
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:13,911
"Then I too will get lost
in the charm of your eyes"

605
01:23:16,674 --> 01:23:20,318
"You and I...
both locked in a room... "

606
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:23,924
"and the key gets lost"

607
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:53,961
"It's pitch dark ahead...
- I'm very scared"

608
01:23:54,422 --> 01:23:57,951
"With a robber behind you!
- Why are you scaring me?"

609
01:23:58,258 --> 01:24:00,943
"Darkness ahead"

610
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:04,971
"And a robber behind you"

611
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:09,958
"You can't climb up... "

612
01:24:10,495 --> 01:24:12,950
"nor can you climb down"

613
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:21,006
"Think what would happen
in this really happened"

614
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:23,960
"You and I... "

615
01:24:27,757 --> 01:24:30,098
"are going somewhere"

616
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:35,890
"And we lose our way"

617
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:51,504
"In your loving arms, my love"

618
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:55,263
"I'll swing to and fro"

619
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:59,905
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

620
01:25:01,094 --> 01:25:03,358
"And the key gets lost"

621
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,721
"Far away from the madding crowd,
behind the mountains"

622
01:25:41,028 --> 01:25:44,672
"Lost in each other
under thick trees... "

623
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:48,662
"A place unseen and
unknown to anyone"

624
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:52,422
"Just you and I, and
the breeze for company"

625
01:25:52,997 --> 01:25:55,453
"Think what it'll be like
if this happens"

626
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,319
"You and I... "

627
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,573
"are passing through a forest"

628
01:26:12,178 --> 01:26:14,019
"and encounter a tiger"

629
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:29,057
"I'll ask it to spare you... "

630
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:33,008
"and devour me instead"

631
01:26:33,929 --> 01:26:37,497
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

632
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,026
"And the key gets lost"

633
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:25,525
"Why are you so lost?"

634
01:27:26,447 --> 01:27:29,285
"Why pretend to be asleep,
when awake?"

635
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:33,121
"Who knows what will
happen tomorrow"

636
01:27:34,272 --> 01:27:36,957
"That's worrying me a bit"

637
01:27:38,108 --> 01:27:40,908
"Think, what if something happens"

638
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:47,545
"You and I... "

639
01:27:51,343 --> 01:27:53,567
"we're frolicking around"

640
01:27:57,251 --> 01:27:59,667
"and suddenly our eyes
are filled with tears"

641
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:12,556
"I swear on your head... "

642
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:16,853
"I'll just drop dead"

643
01:28:18,886 --> 01:28:22,569
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"

644
01:28:24,027 --> 01:28:25,868
"And the key gets lost"

645
01:28:27,748 --> 01:28:33,655
"Then I too will lose myself
in the charm of your eyes"

646
01:28:35,573 --> 01:28:37,185
"You and I... "

647
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:41,635
"both locked up in a room"

648
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:46,239
"And the key gets lost"

649
01:28:48,885 --> 01:28:52,644
"And the key...
- gets lost"

650
01:29:15,508 --> 01:29:17,925
- Has Raja returned?
- I was going to ask you that.

651
01:29:19,268 --> 01:29:22,566
Had he told me before going,
to inform me of his arrival?

652
01:29:23,334 --> 01:29:26,633
You talk as though I asked him
to go with that girl!

653
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:32,273
Of course not. You're not at fault.
You were busy with your social life.

654
01:29:33,078 --> 01:29:35,265
How will you know
what your son is up to?

655
01:29:35,533 --> 01:29:37,106
Ask yourself that!

656
01:29:37,451 --> 01:29:40,175
He's been here for quite some
time. Have you ever sat with him?

657
01:29:41,517 --> 01:29:47,195
Why him? Have you had the time to
sit with your wife for 20 minutes?

658
01:29:47,809 --> 01:29:52,067
What do you mean? Do I neglect
my business and follow you around?

659
01:29:52,796 --> 01:29:55,328
No. Neglect your family
and make money.

660
01:29:56,057 --> 01:30:00,277
Whom do I earn it for?
You and Raja...

661
01:30:00,277 --> 01:30:02,195
Don't take his name! Have you ever
given him love?

662
01:30:03,383 --> 01:30:05,339
As if you have!

663
01:30:05,339 --> 01:30:12,053
Thanks to you! You sent him away.
When he came back he was grown up!

664
01:30:12,398 --> 01:30:16,158
Yes! He didn't miss anything
by not being hugged by you!

665
01:30:23,561 --> 01:30:26,899
Neither he missed it,
nor did you lose anything.

666
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,351
Only I felt childless.

667
01:30:48,996 --> 01:30:50,798
Brought flowers from Kashmir, eh?

668
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:56,783
Yes, the season was loverly.
Spring! Full of flowers.

669
01:30:57,627 --> 01:31:02,575
- But we're ablaze here!
- It's hot, but I see no fire...

670
01:31:02,882 --> 01:31:05,798
You don't, but
I'm feeling the heat.

671
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,908
I don't understand.

672
01:31:08,368 --> 01:31:11,821
I'm ashamed to say it.
One doesn't know when my son...

673
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:15,541
and that slut-of a-daughter
of a servant...

674
01:31:29,966 --> 01:31:34,761
But Bobby's not a slut.
No doubt. Aunty was my governess...

675
01:31:35,643 --> 01:31:39,748
But everybody has a lean period.
Today they're well settled in life.

676
01:31:40,937 --> 01:31:46,422
Who all will I tell this to?
Everyone knows she was our servant.

677
01:31:47,152 --> 01:31:52,637
Was! Today they have servants.
Mr. Braganza has some status today.

678
01:31:56,934 --> 01:31:58,238
What does he do for a living?

679
01:32:01,652 --> 01:32:06,985
And Dad, Bobby is a good and
a decent girl. If you meet her...

680
01:32:07,483 --> 01:32:09,172
Can you call them over?

681
01:32:12,508 --> 01:32:17,534
Invite them for dinner tomorrow.
I don't want to delay this issue.

682
01:33:19,603 --> 01:33:22,864
Will you have dinner with us?
My father wants to meet you.

683
01:33:23,094 --> 01:33:24,053
Why?

684
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:26,087
- To see Bobby.
- What for?

685
01:33:29,654 --> 01:33:36,405
I'll come. For my daughter's sake,
I can bow at anyone's door...

686
01:33:36,636 --> 01:33:40,241
- But I won't kneel! Know why?
- Why?

687
01:33:40,817 --> 01:33:44,999
"I don't want any gold or silver;
I seek not diamonds and pearls"

688
01:33:45,804 --> 01:33:48,220
"Of what use are
they for me?"

689
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:55,586
"I won't ask for a bungalow, nor
a carriage driven by horses"

690
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,578
"They're all just
for name sake"

691
01:34:01,072 --> 01:34:05,330
"Instead, give me your heart
in exchange for mine"

692
01:34:11,314 --> 01:34:15,649
"So take it...
it's all yours, sir"

693
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:18,987
"There's no bargaining
in love"

694
01:34:52,092 --> 01:34:56,696
"I don't know about maulvi or kazi,
or even Mecca or Varanasi... "

695
01:34:57,004 --> 01:34:59,727
"I'm just thirsting for love"

696
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:06,709
"Dear Queen of my dreams...
you'll be thunder-struck to know"

697
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:09,893
"that I'm just mad about you"

698
01:35:12,578 --> 01:35:16,721
"So will you swap hearts
with me?"

699
01:35:17,258 --> 01:35:21,708
"Go on, give me your heart
in change for mine"

700
01:35:22,744 --> 01:35:27,155
"Take it, sir...
It's all yours"

701
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:30,147
"No bargaining with love"

702
01:36:01,028 --> 01:36:07,243
"If you lie, a crow will peck you.
So beware!"

703
01:36:08,048 --> 01:36:12,844
"I'll go to my mother's
while you stand and watch"

704
01:36:21,091 --> 01:36:26,808
"You're lying!
So a black crow will peck you"

705
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:29,839
"Beware now...
I'll go to my mother's... "

706
01:36:29,839 --> 01:36:34,288
"right under your nose!
I'll go to my mother's... "

707
01:36:34,518 --> 01:36:36,782
"while you just stand and gape"

708
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:06,858
"If you go to your mother's,
I'll pick up a stick"

709
01:37:07,586 --> 01:37:09,888
"I'll come with a stick"

710
01:37:10,425 --> 01:37:14,875
"If you come with a stick,
I'll jump in the well"

711
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,862
"I'll pull you up with a rope"

712
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:22,394
"Then I'll climb up a tree"

713
01:37:22,394 --> 01:37:24,925
"I'll cut it down
with a saw"

714
01:37:27,994 --> 01:37:33,327
"Will he love me, or use a saw?
Better beware of such a lover... "

715
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:38,927
"I'll go to my mother's!
Just you watch!"

716
01:37:44,221 --> 01:37:49,898
"You lie and be pecked by a crow.
But beware!"

717
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:54,349
"I'll go to my mother's...
right under your nose"

718
01:37:55,308 --> 01:37:59,643
"I'll go to my mom,
just you wait!"

719
01:38:20,012 --> 01:38:22,430
"If you go to your Mom's... "

720
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:27,340
"I'll get married again
to some other woman"

721
01:38:27,953 --> 01:38:32,979
"You'll marry another girl?
Get a rival for me?"

722
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:40,421
"Then I won't go to my mother's... "

723
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:51,047
"I'll stick to you...
I won't go to my mother's"

724
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:55,996
"I'll keep all my promises,
but I won't leave you... "

725
01:38:56,610 --> 01:39:01,405
"Honestly, I won't go
to my mother's now"

726
01:39:04,589 --> 01:39:07,466
"Remember, you lie and the
black crow will peck you"

727
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:13,489
"Beware!
I'll get you a rival"

728
01:39:13,719 --> 01:39:20,471
"And you can't do anything!
I'll marry again, just you wait"

729
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:26,455
"Liar! And may the crow peck you.
So beware!"

730
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:31,481
"I won't go to my mother's... "

731
01:39:58,142 --> 01:40:00,750
Welcome, sir.
Come in, Aunty.

732
01:40:20,315 --> 01:40:22,118
How about some whisky?

733
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:26,606
I don't drink whisky.
I prefer Rum.

734
01:40:28,217 --> 01:40:30,902
And I've a permit for it too;
shall I show you?

735
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:34,470
Serve him Rum. Come, sir.

736
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:37,539
Have a seat.

737
01:40:38,728 --> 01:40:41,337
So how's your fishing business?

738
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,173
First class.
There's lot of money in fish, sir.

739
01:40:46,209 --> 01:40:48,165
And there's lot of fish
in the sea too, Ma'am.

740
01:40:54,342 --> 01:40:58,139
- Where do you export your fish?
- What export?

741
01:40:58,676 --> 01:41:01,208
What she means is which
countries does your fish go to?

742
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:06,003
What are you saying, sir?
I sweat all day and catch fish.

743
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,495
I can't supply this city,
how can I export it?

744
01:41:10,454 --> 01:41:14,059
Shall I tell you something?
If we sell a fish for Re. 1...

745
01:41:14,059 --> 01:41:18,394
when it comes on your table, it
costs Rs. 8. Middlemen make profit.

746
01:41:19,353 --> 01:41:24,954
But don't worry, I'll give you a
basket full, of fresh fish, daily.

747
01:41:31,361 --> 01:41:34,199
Raja, won't you show
your room to Bobby?

748
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:49,812
They make such a lovely pair.
How happy the kids look!

749
01:41:50,273 --> 01:41:54,070
Yes, they're kids.
... Your rum.

750
01:41:55,337 --> 01:41:57,024
Water, or Soda?

751
01:41:59,518 --> 01:42:05,732
I'm a fisherman; I take it neat.
Dilution weakens it. Fill it up.

752
01:42:06,385 --> 01:42:09,262
Till I take my full quota,
I can't think properly.

753
01:42:19,351 --> 01:42:25,259
My father can't talk with style.
I hope your father understands.

754
01:42:27,215 --> 01:42:31,473
I understand only too well,
what you're after.

755
01:42:31,818 --> 01:42:35,463
I'm a God-fearing man, sir.
I really tell you.

756
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:40,104
I only want my daughter's happiness.
God has given me everything.

757
01:42:40,104 --> 01:42:45,514
- She's my only daughter.
- Raja's my only son too.

758
01:42:46,664 --> 01:42:49,963
There's nothing more valuable
than his happiness, for me too.

759
01:42:50,347 --> 01:42:56,332
He's naive. Doesn't realise that
what seems joy is in fact danger!

760
01:43:05,998 --> 01:43:09,144
Actually you dreamt a lofty dream.

761
01:43:11,139 --> 01:43:13,517
I'm sorry, that it won't
come true however.

762
01:43:15,205 --> 01:43:20,346
You see where you live,
and the way you live.

763
01:43:21,382 --> 01:43:24,565
Just think where you are,
and where we stand.

764
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:36,343
How did you think that your
daughter will come here as...

765
01:43:42,366 --> 01:43:43,784
What did you say?

766
01:43:44,053 --> 01:43:48,388
- I planned all this? Me?
- Isn't it possible...

767
01:43:49,692 --> 01:43:53,566
that your mother could've thought
of this when she worked here?

768
01:43:54,411 --> 01:43:58,401
That one day Raja will grow
up and so will your daughter.

769
01:44:02,429 --> 01:44:06,303
Yes! He's my heir to all
my wealth. But still a kid.

770
01:44:07,453 --> 01:44:10,446
A stupid bird sees the grain,
but not the trap!

771
01:44:11,405 --> 01:44:13,400
And with the kind of
beautiful trap you've laid...

772
01:45:02,733 --> 01:45:04,076
Hold on.

773
01:45:08,794 --> 01:45:12,476
Cherish this.
I'll think that my love is safe.

774
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:31,197
We'll not stay here a minute
longer. Come, mother.

775
01:45:32,578 --> 01:45:36,108
- I'll never forget this meeting.
- I'll leave them to the taxi-stand.

776
01:45:39,483 --> 01:45:41,478
Your Daddy's rum is not strong...

777
01:45:41,478 --> 01:45:45,161
enough to make me lose my way.

778
01:45:48,345 --> 01:45:52,372
I had told you, for the sake
of Bobby's happiness...

779
01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:57,015
I'll bow at anybody's door,
but I'll not kneel!

780
01:46:40,056 --> 01:46:43,624
How come a richie-rich bothered
to come to my humble hut?

781
01:46:55,133 --> 01:47:00,426
Last night you got angry and
returned home. Later I realised...

782
01:47:00,695 --> 01:47:05,374
my way of saying things was wrong.
- Let alone ways, sir.

783
01:47:05,682 --> 01:47:07,408
What you said was wrong.

784
01:47:09,058 --> 01:47:13,469
I owe you yesterday's rum.

785
01:47:16,807 --> 01:47:20,106
I don't drink in the mornings.

786
01:47:20,911 --> 01:47:26,473
And I drink 24 hours, sir.
You big-wigs keep a schedule.

787
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:31,652
If you have anything worthwhile
to say, carry on.

788
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,182
Indeed! It is worthwile for you.

789
01:47:36,755 --> 01:47:40,667
I've come to ask you,
how much money do you want?

790
01:47:43,736 --> 01:47:47,380
How much money do I want?
What did you say?

791
01:47:48,339 --> 01:47:52,061
- I didn't hear you properly.
- You heard me alright.

792
01:47:53,749 --> 01:47:57,700
You are an excellent angler!
You net good fish!

793
01:47:58,697 --> 01:48:01,306
And this time,
my son has been caught in it.

794
01:48:02,764 --> 01:48:04,720
I don't wish you
to undergo any loss!

795
01:48:06,369 --> 01:48:09,746
Tell me, what's your
price to set my son free?

796
01:48:10,781 --> 01:48:12,738
Rs. 20,000, Rs. 50,000.

797
01:48:16,766 --> 01:48:20,563
You brought a cheque-book?!
You wait.

798
01:48:21,101 --> 01:48:24,975
Hold on, man.
I'll show you.

799
01:48:32,647 --> 01:48:35,486
Comes with a cheque-book!
Dangles money at me!

800
01:48:43,273 --> 01:48:46,342
You think only you have money?
Even I have it. Look!

801
01:48:47,149 --> 01:48:51,790
You rich have just money,
cars, bungalows...

802
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:55,128
You've just wealth,
but not hearts.

803
01:48:56,585 --> 01:48:59,654
And we poor, have honour,
hearts, and happiness.

804
01:48:59,961 --> 01:49:03,221
And we don't sell these
things, understand?

805
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:06,943
You don't sell, but make
business out of it!

806
01:49:08,823 --> 01:49:12,620
People with honour don't turn
their daughters into bales of hay...

807
01:49:12,851 --> 01:49:16,418
and offer them to sons
of millionaires. Get me?

808
01:49:42,849 --> 01:49:48,181
Had Mr. Nath come?
Go inside, dear.

809
01:49:49,985 --> 01:49:53,974
Why are you just standing?
Tell me. Why was he here?

810
01:49:54,895 --> 01:49:58,117
Why?
To tell me that...

811
01:49:58,117 --> 01:50:04,447
you're a whore.
And that I'm a bastard...

812
01:50:04,677 --> 01:50:07,132
That I force my daughter
to sell herself.

813
01:50:09,894 --> 01:50:15,917
Do you know why that friend is
trampling our prestige like this?

814
01:50:16,339 --> 01:50:19,600
Because you fed his son!

815
01:50:35,404 --> 01:50:36,747
Raju had given me this.

816
01:50:36,978 --> 01:50:41,581
I'll drown you if
you take his name!

817
01:50:42,117 --> 01:50:46,721
I'll pack off both of you.
Go to Goa at once.

818
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:48,755
- Why?
- If you speak...

819
01:50:48,755 --> 01:50:50,250
I'll have your tongue!

820
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:55,967
I don't want that boy to
come here and meet my baby.

821
01:50:55,967 --> 01:50:57,539
Off you go!

822
01:51:14,457 --> 01:51:20,556
- How dare you come here!
- I've come for Bobby.

823
01:51:21,438 --> 01:51:27,000
I don't want to hear her name
on your lips, do you hear?

824
01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:31,259
She's dead to you!

825
01:51:45,222 --> 01:51:49,174
I beg of you...
Before I do something to you...

826
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:53,355
Please go from here.

827
01:51:58,304 --> 01:52:01,027
You've made life one big hell
for my daughter.

828
01:52:05,209 --> 01:52:11,078
She'll never laugh again. You've made
a living corpse out of her.

829
01:52:18,098 --> 01:52:21,052
"My heart broke... "

830
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:27,075
"into a thousand pieces... "

831
01:52:29,262 --> 01:52:30,758
"in my heart"

832
01:52:39,658 --> 01:52:40,809
"Let me hug you and die"

833
01:52:46,525 --> 01:52:47,868
"What's the point in living"

834
01:52:57,688 --> 01:53:01,102
"Let our eyes see
each other, at least"

835
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:13,531
"Let our eyes be
in each other's view"

836
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:16,523
"So that even from afar... "

837
01:53:16,792 --> 01:53:21,587
"we can quench our
thirst for each other"

838
01:53:22,661 --> 01:53:29,566
"Let us be close enough
to see each other"

839
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:37,584
"So that even from a distance
our thirst can be quenched"

840
01:53:38,505 --> 01:53:41,574
"So let our eyes at least
see each other"

841
01:54:06,585 --> 01:54:08,235
Where had you been?

842
01:54:14,104 --> 01:54:15,716
I asked "where had you been?"

843
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:21,239
- You know where I had been.
- Why?

844
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:29,679
- Answer me! Why?
- You know why.

845
01:54:30,369 --> 01:54:33,784
- That's no answer.
- Okay. I had gone to meet Bobby.

846
01:54:35,241 --> 01:54:40,727
I can't live without her.
I... I love her.

847
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:44,679
Love, my foot!
You're not old enough for love.

848
01:54:45,484 --> 01:54:48,399
Do you know what love is,
and who is worthy of it?

849
01:54:49,435 --> 01:54:55,266
First you brought scum here and
now I'll just stand and watch?

850
01:54:55,803 --> 01:54:59,792
Hear me good, son. The prestige
of this house is no toy.

851
01:55:00,445 --> 01:55:04,742
This is my house. One who doesn't
obey me has no right to stay here.

852
01:55:06,506 --> 01:55:08,309
Where are you going?

853
01:55:08,309 --> 01:55:10,419
Sir, I had wrongly thought
this was my home too.

854
01:55:13,642 --> 01:55:16,940
What childishness is this?
Where will you go?

855
01:55:18,858 --> 01:55:22,273
Can't I be a shoe-shine boy,
or work as a labourer?

856
01:55:23,155 --> 01:55:26,339
Let him go, dear.
He'll be back in two days.

857
01:55:27,452 --> 01:55:32,554
He doesn't know about those boys
who become old men straight away.

858
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:37,080
- Who don't know what's youth!
- If that's my destiny, so be it.

859
01:55:37,732 --> 01:55:41,185
Even if I've to starve. At least
I'll be with the one I love.

860
01:55:43,487 --> 01:55:45,635
So you're seeing that mirage, eh?

861
01:55:46,671 --> 01:55:51,620
Even the law doesn't permit
you to do this.

862
01:55:52,502 --> 01:55:57,412
Because you're still a minor.
If you marry, you'll land in jail.

863
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:03,358
Your father's right, son.
Become 21 years old...

864
01:56:03,588 --> 01:56:05,391
and then do what you like.

865
01:56:21,196 --> 01:56:25,799
- He has begun to talk back!
- You also scold him like a kid.

866
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:31,132
- Why don't you convince him?
- What do today's kids think we are?

867
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,817
Do today's parents understand
their kids?

868
01:56:35,428 --> 01:56:36,387
Meaning?

869
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:41,106
Just that modern kids want
to see, with open eyes.

870
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:45,402
It's not necessary that their view
should match their parents view.

871
01:56:46,783 --> 01:56:50,543
A 19 year old boy
isn't a kid, Mr. Nath.

872
01:56:51,464 --> 01:56:55,223
It's just 2 years. I'll be 21,
and you'll be 19 years old.

873
01:56:56,028 --> 01:56:59,903
Then no power on earth can stop us.
The law, or our parents.

874
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:04,430
Never mind. I've found a way.
I'll get Raja married.

875
01:57:05,466 --> 01:57:07,882
- Without asking him?
- Will he agree if I ask him?

876
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:12,409
Thanks to Ms. Pestonji we've got
a decent proposal from Mr. Sharma.

877
01:57:14,633 --> 01:57:17,281
Welcome, sir.
We were just talking about you.

878
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:21,309
Yes Bobby, we'll have a
sweet home after we marry.

879
01:57:21,999 --> 01:57:26,104
I promise I'll give you
the house of your dreams.

880
01:57:26,832 --> 01:57:32,740
Since our children will wed soon,
this house is ine and vice versa.

881
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:37,957
Now that you both are related,
how about sealing it with a hug?

882
01:57:42,485 --> 01:57:45,821
I'm having a New Year Party
and you're all invited.

883
01:57:46,282 --> 01:57:49,657
We'll have a drink together, and
the boy and the girl can meet too.

884
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:59,095
We'll never keep our kids away
from us. We'll love them a lot.

885
01:58:00,859 --> 01:58:03,238
Without love, kids become
very insecure, Bobby.

886
01:58:04,926 --> 01:58:06,537
There's a difference in dreams
and reality, Raj.

887
01:58:07,573 --> 01:58:09,030
What?

888
01:58:13,595 --> 01:58:15,322
Of what use is such innocence?

889
01:58:15,974 --> 01:58:18,122
That you can't even hear
your dream being shattered?

890
01:58:22,764 --> 01:58:24,720
This is not the
House of Your Dreams.

891
01:58:25,564 --> 01:58:28,710
Run away, Raj...
Run away from them all!

892
01:58:35,883 --> 01:58:37,188
Anything special?

893
01:58:37,188 --> 01:58:40,526
No, the usual.
Music, dance, drinks etc.

894
01:58:40,986 --> 01:58:44,591
But for us it'll certainly be special.
We'll start the year on a new note.

895
01:58:49,809 --> 01:58:53,568
Looks as though he has invited
the whole who's who! Come!

896
01:58:56,522 --> 01:58:58,364
Look, they've come.

897
01:58:59,552 --> 01:59:03,504
- Our future son-in-law...
- How he has grown!

898
01:59:09,603 --> 01:59:11,559
- Yes?
- Introduce Raja to my daughter.

899
01:59:19,999 --> 01:59:22,608
Look after your special guest.
This is Raja.

900
01:59:26,674 --> 01:59:30,012
You took so long to come.
Made me wait so much...

901
01:59:38,643 --> 01:59:40,408
I didn't recognise you.

902
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:47,160
No?
You didn't recognise me?

903
01:59:48,694 --> 01:59:50,650
I'm Alka...

904
01:59:52,339 --> 01:59:55,483
So, you're Mr. Sharma's daughter.

905
01:59:56,136 --> 01:59:59,052
Yes, I'm the one.

906
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:01,852
This house is mine. Nice, eh?

907
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:10,061
My daddy built this house
just for me. Only me.

908
02:00:10,867 --> 02:00:17,350
I'm his only child, so I'll be
inheriting all this one day.

909
02:00:17,887 --> 02:00:20,381
That's why everybody
loves me so very much.

910
02:00:22,912 --> 02:00:27,976
Everybody calls me by my pet name,
Nicky. You also call me Nicky.

911
02:00:28,245 --> 02:00:29,817
I prefer Alka.

912
02:00:35,495 --> 02:00:38,448
I'll tell everybody now
to call me Alka, Okay?

913
02:00:39,983 --> 02:00:42,937
- Your doll's very nice.
- Yes, isn't she?

914
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:47,732
I've a room full of dolls.
Come, I'll show you.

915
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:52,450
I know I've grown up
and become tall too.

916
02:00:53,334 --> 02:00:56,134
But mentally, I'm still a kid.

917
02:00:57,706 --> 02:01:01,542
So what? The doctor said
when I get married...

918
02:01:01,773 --> 02:01:05,149
everything will be fine.

919
02:01:08,447 --> 02:01:13,895
- You will marry me, won't you?
- Me? Marry you?

920
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:18,115
You will, won't you?

921
02:01:22,795 --> 02:01:28,587
You're not like the others.
You will marry me?

922
02:01:30,505 --> 02:01:36,107
- Who told you this?
- My Dad. Your Dad.

923
02:01:36,797 --> 02:01:41,094
My Dad said he'd give your Dad
a whole lot of business.

924
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:46,464
And they'll send us abroad
for our honeymoon.

925
02:01:47,807 --> 02:01:53,484
My dad's wealth is all mine and
then yours after marriage.

926
02:01:58,816 --> 02:02:03,765
You will marry me?
My dream will come true?

927
02:02:04,839 --> 02:02:06,834
I will become a bride, won't I?

928
02:02:09,903 --> 02:02:13,087
I will be a bride...

929
02:02:27,281 --> 02:02:32,690
What's this? You asked me to wait
till I was 21. Why am I cheated?

930
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:39,863
I didn't do anything. This proposal
was good so your father decided.

931
02:02:46,653 --> 02:02:48,648
This is my life. Who are you
to take decisions about it?

932
02:02:52,868 --> 02:02:58,584
Your father! The decision is final.
It's for your own good and progress.

933
02:02:59,006 --> 02:03:01,614
You've sold me for money,
by making this deal.

934
02:03:03,302 --> 02:03:06,908
Learn to be polite, son.
No use arguing about it now.

935
02:03:07,675 --> 02:03:09,901
Mr. Sharma is going to make it
official tomorrow.

936
02:03:11,934 --> 02:03:14,350
"Trapped"

937
02:03:17,419 --> 02:03:20,334
"He who has left home,
has no roof over his head... "

938
02:03:20,565 --> 02:03:26,319
"and made a home
in someone else's heart"

939
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:31,575
"He's now trapped!"

940
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:31,419
"This one year between
boyhood and manhood... "

941
02:04:31,419 --> 02:04:35,447
"is very traumatic.
This one year... "

942
02:04:36,023 --> 02:04:42,007
"of youth, of innocence,
and madness"

943
02:04:42,428 --> 02:04:49,410
"This one year between boyhood
and manhood is ad"

944
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:55,433
"The good name of the lover
is tarred"

945
02:04:55,433 --> 02:04:59,461
"And the world laughed"

946
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:04,065
"He's trapped"

947
02:05:04,486 --> 02:05:07,440
"One who has no home
or a roof over his head... "

948
02:05:08,093 --> 02:05:13,501
"and instead made a home
in someone else's heart... "

949
02:05:16,762 --> 02:05:19,064
"is totally trapped"

950
02:06:14,804 --> 02:06:18,563
"Better that today itself
with a cage and all... "

951
02:06:18,563 --> 02:06:22,514
"the bird flies away.
It might save his life"

952
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:28,614
"Through some opening...
by seeking a proper chance"

953
02:06:29,189 --> 02:06:32,565
"Even by deceit...
better today... "

954
02:06:33,908 --> 02:06:38,127
"that the bird flies off
with the cage and all... "

955
02:06:38,703 --> 02:06:41,580
"Life has become unbearable"

956
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:47,603
"because somebody has bitten
through and through... "

957
02:06:51,247 --> 02:06:53,203
"See... he's trapped!"

958
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:56,618
"He who has left home
has no roof over his head... "

959
02:06:56,886 --> 02:07:02,602
"and made a home in
someone's heart"

960
02:07:05,249 --> 02:07:07,205
"Is trapped"

961
02:07:46,104 --> 02:07:50,784
You're responsible for this.
I told you to take his consent.

962
02:07:51,321 --> 02:07:56,960
I did say he can't be forced.
He ran away! My son has gone.

963
02:08:07,894 --> 02:08:13,341
Look, if I find my son
with your daughter...

964
02:08:13,609 --> 02:08:17,714
I won't spare you.
I'll finish you!

965
02:08:18,366 --> 02:08:21,933
Don't threaten me, man.

966
02:08:22,356 --> 02:08:24,888
If you have the guts, do it.

967
02:08:28,186 --> 02:08:34,094
Go find your son. Must be playing
around with some innocent girl.

968
02:08:34,478 --> 02:08:37,163
Else, must be lying in a gutter!

969
02:08:53,352 --> 02:08:55,347
- Who do you want?
- Does Aunty live here?

970
02:08:55,347 --> 02:08:57,916
Who?
She's inside

971
02:09:01,446 --> 02:09:02,789
Master Raja?

972
02:09:07,546 --> 02:09:10,423
I've left everything
behind, Aunty. Forever and ever.

973
02:09:12,110 --> 02:09:15,371
You've come without your
anyone's permission?

974
02:09:16,446 --> 02:09:21,394
Whose permission would I have taken?
A mom who never had time for me.

975
02:09:21,931 --> 02:09:25,000
Who doesn't and never will.
That father, who never loved me?

976
02:09:25,729 --> 02:09:27,877
I've left that home.

977
02:09:31,483 --> 02:09:35,435
You've come.
I always knew you'd come.

978
02:09:35,819 --> 02:09:39,232
Stop right there, girl.
I won't let you meet him.

979
02:09:40,806 --> 02:09:44,565
- But why?
- Because you ran away from home.

980
02:09:45,485 --> 02:09:46,752
You've done wrong.

981
02:09:46,981 --> 02:09:50,242
What's right and what isn't, Aunty?
Was my father right?

982
02:09:50,588 --> 02:09:52,467
He was selling me. Selling!

983
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,454
He was getting me married to a
mentally handicapped girl for money.

984
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:00,485
Is he's right?

985
02:10:02,288 --> 02:10:03,823
Must've thought of a good future.

986
02:10:04,513 --> 02:10:09,692
I've also thought about my life.
Who's he to finalise my marriage?

987
02:10:10,766 --> 02:10:14,141
- The law has given him the right.
- What law?

988
02:10:14,372 --> 02:10:17,517
It's my life and someone
else decides about it?

989
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:20,202
Don't stop us, Gran.

990
02:10:20,548 --> 02:10:23,655
He has left his home far behind.
Hasn't he come for me?

991
02:10:24,538 --> 02:10:29,064
- I order you. Go upstairs!
- No, Gran, no!

992
02:10:29,448 --> 02:10:31,020
I've listened to you before,
but I'll not obey you now.

993
02:10:36,430 --> 02:10:39,843
- Take her up and lock her!
- What are you doing, Gran?

994
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:47,363
The right thing. When the time
will prove that ou were wrong...

995
02:10:47,363 --> 02:10:51,544
you both will say,
"Why didn't you stop us...

996
02:10:52,119 --> 02:10:57,375
- when there was still time?
- No! Who are you to stop me?

997
02:11:06,736 --> 02:11:12,221
What do you want?
Haven't we suffered enough?

998
02:11:12,757 --> 02:11:16,095
Do you know how your father
has insulted my son?

999
02:11:16,556 --> 02:11:19,587
If he comes to know you're
here, he'll...

1000
02:11:27,643 --> 02:11:31,095
- Take her up and lock her.
- I'll die, Gran.

1001
02:11:31,632 --> 02:11:33,627
I can't stay without him.

1002
02:11:38,652 --> 02:11:42,719
Please Gran...
I'll die without him.

1003
02:11:50,889 --> 02:11:54,955
Release Bobby.
Don't be so cruel to her.

1004
02:11:57,027 --> 02:12:01,593
You know how much we love each other.
We're not committing any sin.

1005
02:12:02,704 --> 02:12:07,654
- We want to get married.
- You can't! You're under age.

1006
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:12,641
Do you know what can happen.
Jack can be jailed.

1007
02:12:12,641 --> 02:12:15,978
I can be jailed and,
Bobby will become homeless.

1008
02:12:16,706 --> 02:12:20,696
- Her life can be ruined.
- No, no...

1009
02:12:20,696 --> 02:12:22,653
Not when I'm alive.

1010
02:12:28,713 --> 02:12:30,670
I've come with great hopes.

1011
02:12:32,397 --> 02:12:37,345
I've looked to you as a mother.
And thought you'd give me shelter.

1012
02:12:39,723 --> 02:12:41,642
Only you love me, Aunty.

1013
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:47,741
Because I love you, I'm stopping
you from committing a mistake.

1014
02:12:53,073 --> 02:12:56,219
- Till I come back, sit over there.
- Where are you going?

1015
02:12:57,753 --> 02:13:01,053
To wire your father
to take you home!

1016
02:13:01,513 --> 02:13:02,472
No!

1017
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:07,498
That's betrayal! Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

1018
02:13:07,766 --> 02:13:14,709
Wait! Don't do this.
Don't go, Wait!

1019
02:13:15,016 --> 02:13:20,310
Listen to me. Don't go.
don't do this. Wait!

1020
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:26,410
Don't lie! You sent Raja to Goa
and now show an empty house.

1021
02:13:27,369 --> 02:13:31,090
You! You're back again?

1022
02:13:32,624 --> 02:13:36,422
Got the police with you
to scare me, eh?

1023
02:13:36,921 --> 02:13:40,566
I told you to go and seek
your son in some gutter!

1024
02:13:41,486 --> 02:13:44,402
No need to do that.

1025
02:13:45,284 --> 02:13:48,506
He's lying in a dirty gutter
at your place in Goa.

1026
02:13:52,802 --> 02:13:56,753
Your mother has sent this wire.
Raja is at your home.

1027
02:13:57,904 --> 02:14:02,432
You told me your daughter's in Goa.
You didn't tell me...

1028
02:14:02,432 --> 02:14:05,424
... you've sent Raja
with her to flirt around.

1029
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:07,725
Mind your tongue.

1030
02:14:08,569 --> 02:14:13,019
This is a clever move from you.
It costs just Rs. 2/-.

1031
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:15,052
It can be sent from anywhere.

1032
02:14:17,047 --> 02:14:23,952
Hadn't I told you that if I find
my son with your daughter...

1033
02:14:23,952 --> 02:14:29,821
then I'll chop her to pieces!
I'll chop her up and throw her!

1034
02:14:30,205 --> 02:14:33,811
Else, I'll send you to the jail.
Inspector, you wait here.

1035
02:14:33,811 --> 02:14:35,806
You come with me to Goa now.

1036
02:14:37,072 --> 02:14:41,828
You insult us poor, Mr. Nath.
I swear by Jesus.

1037
02:14:43,363 --> 02:14:46,394
If I find your son
with my daughter...

1038
02:14:46,394 --> 02:14:49,884
then I'll mince her.
Else, I'll send you to jail.

1039
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:53,414
Come to Goa with me.
Inspector, I'll be right back.

1040
02:17:34,379 --> 02:17:37,257
- Yes, Gran?
- It's very late.

1041
02:17:38,139 --> 02:17:40,363
- Go to sleep now.
- Okay, Gran.

1042
02:18:01,233 --> 02:18:04,071
Why did you risk your life?
What if you had slipped?

1043
02:18:04,685 --> 02:18:09,135
Better I die than live without you.
If you can't stay without me...

1044
02:18:10,171 --> 02:18:13,431
- Neither can I.
- I know.

1045
02:18:14,927 --> 02:18:19,109
But what can we do? Tomorrow
your Dad will take you away.

1046
02:18:20,183 --> 02:18:23,520
- And, we'll be separated...
- Never!

1047
02:18:24,978 --> 02:18:26,435
No way!

1048
02:18:27,165 --> 02:18:29,121
But we can't afford
to give in either.

1049
02:18:31,653 --> 02:18:34,491
Look at me.
And answer me.

1050
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:38,327
Will you be with me always?

1051
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:43,698
In joy and sorrow,
good times and bad?

1052
02:18:44,849 --> 02:18:48,340
In death?
Will you be there with me?

1053
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,944
- Always?
- Always Raju. Forever.

1054
02:19:13,428 --> 02:19:16,881
This is my house.
Search for that boy.

1055
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:21,523
- You and here, son?
- Thanks to this richie-rich!

1056
02:19:22,559 --> 02:19:25,973
Ask Mr. Nath. He's accusing us
of a new crime now.

1057
02:19:26,241 --> 02:19:31,228
Says I've hidden his son here.
Look at this false telegram.

1058
02:19:31,228 --> 02:19:34,719
Says you sent it!
Tell him it's a hoax.

1059
02:19:36,253 --> 02:19:38,248
I sent the telegram, son.

1060
02:19:41,356 --> 02:19:44,693
Come, sir. Thank God you came.
Raja is in this room.

1061
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:48,261
I didn't let those two meet.
I sat out here the whole night.

1062
02:19:49,834 --> 02:19:54,936
Raja's still a kid.
And kids do err. Forgive him.

1063
02:20:07,557 --> 02:20:09,283
Sorry, but nobody here.

1064
02:20:14,423 --> 02:20:18,912
Stop playing Blind man's Buff,
and tell us where Raja is!

1065
02:20:19,334 --> 02:20:22,671
Isn't he inside? He was there.
I've been out here all night.

1066
02:20:23,323 --> 02:20:28,963
Don't ham, Madam. I didn't
bring the police for nothing.

1067
02:20:29,308 --> 02:20:30,420
I can get you arrested
right this minute.

1068
02:20:33,336 --> 02:20:37,632
They've changed their spots now.
Can't demand money in your presence.

1069
02:20:40,317 --> 02:20:42,773
I've locked Bobby upstairs.

1070
02:20:43,348 --> 02:20:45,304
- Master Raja, could be...
- Give me the key.

1071
02:21:15,035 --> 02:21:19,216
Nath! Come and see this!

1072
02:21:19,485 --> 02:21:23,129
Go and see Inspector.
Now let me tell you something.

1073
02:21:23,513 --> 02:21:28,078
Your son has kidnapped
my 16-year old minor daughter.

1074
02:21:29,152 --> 02:21:34,407
Inspector, arrest him at once...
and ask where my daughter is!

1075
02:21:34,715 --> 02:21:37,169
- Don't blabber!
- I'm not blabbering.

1076
02:21:37,630 --> 02:21:42,924
Just warning you that Bobby
didn't go to your house.

1077
02:21:43,422 --> 02:21:49,407
Your son came here!
Let me tell you another thing.

1078
02:21:49,868 --> 02:21:53,396
If anything happens to my girl
your son...

1079
02:21:53,396 --> 02:21:56,158
will be personally chopped up
and fed to the dogs!

1080
02:22:01,452 --> 02:22:02,872
No, Jack! No!

1081
02:23:22,933 --> 02:23:24,544
Stop! Stop!

1082
02:23:26,654 --> 02:23:31,257
Get that paper with the message
that a boy has kidnapped a girl...

1083
02:23:31,257 --> 02:23:35,938
and check the motor-cycle number.
Are you Mr. Raj Nath?

1084
02:23:37,548 --> 02:23:42,267
No, it's Vishnu Rastogi.

1085
02:23:42,881 --> 02:23:47,638
- And are you Bobby Braganza?
- No. Her name is...

1086
02:23:49,056 --> 02:23:52,433
- Mrs. Vimla Rastogi.
- Correct.

1087
02:23:53,852 --> 02:23:56,345
- Where's the paper?
- Under that drawer.

1088
02:25:50,126 --> 02:25:51,814
Did you see a yellow
motor-cycle carrying my Bobby...

1089
02:25:53,118 --> 02:25:55,880
I mean a girl and a boy go this way?

1090
02:25:56,456 --> 02:25:58,681
- Yes, how did you know?
- Got the news from the Police H. Q.

1091
02:26:48,819 --> 02:26:51,082
Brave girl!
Don't worry. All will be well.

1092
02:26:53,767 --> 02:26:56,952
Thirsty? Hungry?
Come on.

1093
02:26:59,638 --> 02:27:06,312
This is done by your son to stop us
from chasing him further.

1094
02:27:10,647 --> 02:27:13,294
Look over there.
Your photograph.

1095
02:27:23,422 --> 02:27:26,835
Why your photograph in the papers?

1096
02:27:27,871 --> 02:27:29,866
Boss, saw this photograph?

1097
02:27:31,861 --> 02:27:35,850
Dad has given an ad. that whoever
finds us will get Rs. 25,000!

1098
02:27:36,695 --> 02:27:40,301
- 25,000/-.
- Let's go, Bobby.

1099
02:27:44,788 --> 02:27:48,126
I'm Prem.
Prem Chopra!

1100
02:27:49,392 --> 02:27:52,998
Very glad to have met you.
Your paper, Sir. Come Bobby.

1101
02:27:57,141 --> 02:28:01,016
- Will you drop us at the next stop?
- Okay, get in.

1102
02:28:03,471 --> 02:28:06,310
Aren't you getting late?
Roll the truck. Come on!

1103
02:28:12,792 --> 02:28:15,517
This is your snap, isn't it?
See? It's him.

1104
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:18,892
- The girl's not bad either.
- The boy's worth Rs. 25,000/-!

1105
02:28:26,948 --> 02:28:30,247
You're bullying these two?
Lock horns with me.

1106
02:28:39,416 --> 02:28:43,598
Where do you want to go?
I'll take you in my vehicle.

1107
02:28:43,981 --> 02:28:46,704
- Much obliged.
- It's my duty.

1108
02:28:46,973 --> 02:28:48,699
No obligations. Come.

1109
02:28:54,147 --> 02:29:00,744
It's not a sedan, but a small tempo.
But you can try it out. Come.

1110
02:29:02,049 --> 02:29:03,736
See this photograph.

1111
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:15,974
They've come again...

1112
02:29:19,005 --> 02:29:22,304
Don't worry.
We'll reach you safely.

1113
02:31:06,762 --> 02:31:11,097
Prem... Prem Chopra is my name.

1114
02:31:13,284 --> 02:31:14,780
Let me go!

1115
02:31:19,767 --> 02:31:22,107
Let me go!

1116
02:31:25,407 --> 02:31:29,281
No... ! Stop it!
How has he harmed you?

1117
02:31:30,623 --> 02:31:32,963
- Leave him alone!
- Shall I?

1118
02:31:34,497 --> 02:31:40,137
If I leave him, he'll run.
and with him that reward too!

1119
02:31:41,096 --> 02:31:44,127
So why not break his legs?

1120
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:06,683
Break his leg, eh? Bastard!
I'll beat you to pulp!

1121
02:32:07,374 --> 02:32:12,016
Fatso! You've come to share
the reward eh? Catch him.

1122
02:32:16,657 --> 02:32:21,146
Talk of money! You rascal.
Don't you know they're my kids?

1123
02:32:49,073 --> 02:32:52,871
Whoever you are, fatso,
you seem to be their friend.

1124
02:32:53,293 --> 02:32:56,630
But remember,
if you act too smart...

1125
02:32:56,860 --> 02:33:00,236
this knife will go through him!
- No!

1126
02:33:02,729 --> 02:33:07,563
You can skin me alive.
But don't harm him. Let him go.

1127
02:33:07,870 --> 02:33:10,939
Catch him, and skin him alive.

1128
02:33:25,362 --> 02:33:26,629
Help! Help!

1129
02:33:33,343 --> 02:33:36,104
Beat me as much as you like.

1130
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:40,976
But don't do anything
to that boy.

1131
02:33:44,351 --> 02:33:45,694
Don't harm him...

1132
02:33:49,799 --> 02:33:54,517
- Catch the hooligans!
- Stop! Don't come any further.

1133
02:34:05,374 --> 02:34:09,978
Come Bobby, let's run.
Daddy's here to separate us.

1134
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:14,389
He won't let us live together.
But nobody can separate us now.

1135
02:34:14,811 --> 02:34:18,724
Nobody!
Hadn't you said...

1136
02:34:19,299 --> 02:34:22,560
You'll be with me in joy,
sorrow, life and even death?

1137
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:25,207
- Yes.
- Come with me.

1138
02:34:41,434 --> 02:34:44,733
Raja! Bobby!
Stop!

1139
02:35:12,430 --> 02:35:14,809
Raja, don't go further,
please, son.

1140
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:21,406
- Don't go further. There's danger.
- There's danger ahead and behind too.

1141
02:35:21,906 --> 02:35:25,358
- Why be scared of it?
- If you take one more step...

1142
02:35:25,358 --> 02:35:27,046
you'll die.

1143
02:35:27,046 --> 02:35:31,304
- If we return, will you let us be?
- How childish?

1144
02:35:31,688 --> 02:35:34,257
This is not childishness.
It's love.

1145
02:35:34,757 --> 02:35:39,169
But unfortunately you didn't realise
your son has his life, his own sense.

1146
02:35:39,436 --> 02:35:42,467
They know what's good and bad.
You think we are child.

1147
02:35:43,197 --> 02:35:44,462
Come back, son.

1148
02:35:44,462 --> 02:35:46,879
To their parents, kids always
remain kids, son.

1149
02:35:47,262 --> 02:35:51,176
Who's denying it? But I'm not
a piece of your property.

1150
02:35:51,981 --> 02:35:55,779
Your society and law think that
our lives belong to you.

1151
02:35:56,623 --> 02:36:00,881
Okay, Our lives may be...
But not our death!

1152
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:04,525
No...
How do I convince you now?

1153
02:36:05,024 --> 02:36:06,865
Come back, Both of you.

1154
02:36:08,016 --> 02:36:09,973
We weren't meant to live together.

1155
02:36:11,545 --> 02:36:13,386
But we can die together,
can't we?

1156
02:38:50,017 --> 02:38:51,974
Your son is alive.

1157
02:38:53,010 --> 02:38:58,073
Thank God! My daughter's alive too.
My daughter!

1158
02:38:58,610 --> 02:39:00,759
- Papa!
- Yes, my dear.

1159
02:39:03,866 --> 02:39:08,354
My dear, when we nearly
lost you both today...

1160
02:39:09,697 --> 02:39:15,259
I realised how invaluable
kids are to their parents.
