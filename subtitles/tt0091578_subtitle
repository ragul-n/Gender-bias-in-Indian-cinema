1
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,080
Hell.

2
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,290
We're moving out.

3
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,580
Got a fire?

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,210
Too early in the morning.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,340
All right.

6
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,230
Get out of there. Come on.

7
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,380
Come here, come here.

8
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm fixing you up with a job...

9
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,550
with your uncle.

10
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,470
Work now, till you go back to college.

11
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,310
If your face gets any longer
here, you'll overbalance...

12
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
or I'll commit suicide.

13
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,740
Bilquis?

14
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
Good.

15
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,620
And Tania and the other girls?

16
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,670
I say...

17
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,260
can't you give Omar some work
in your garage for a few weeks?

18
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh come on, yaar.

19
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,270
The bugger is your nephew, after all.

20
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,690
He's on dole...

21
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,650
like everyone else in England.

22
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,320
He sweeps the dust from
one place to another...

23
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,990
he squeezes shirts...

24
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,740
and he heats soup.

25
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,280
I mean, that hardly stretches him.

26
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,580
His food stretches me.

27
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, come on, yaar. I'll send
him to college in the autumn.

28
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,090
Oh, one thing more: try and
fix him up with a nice girl.

29
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,460
I'm not sure his penis
is in full working order.

30
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,190
Yes, we've got one parking space.

31
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,650
Â£25 a week.

32
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,490
And from this afternoon...

33
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,660
we're offering a special
on-the-premises...

34
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,370
clean-the-car
service.

35
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,710
New thing.

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,670
Is that your car?

37
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,720
Why you feeling it up, then? Come here.

38
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,720
Here, I said.

39
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,610
And this bastard who almost
beat you up is Salim.

40
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,070
You'll be seeing a lot of him.

41
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,320
I've heard many great
things about your father.

42
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,570
Oh, I must see him, but my God,
where have I got the time?

43
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,200
You're too busy keeping this damn country
in the black. But still, someone's got to do it.

44
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,870
So, your papa got thrown out of
that clerk's job I fixed him with?

45
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,620
Pissed, was he?

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,750
Can you wash a car?

47
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,130
Have you washed a car before?

48
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,590
Your uncle can't pay you very much...

49
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,220
but at least you'll be able
to afford a decent shirt...

50
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,600
and you'll be with your own
people, not in a dole queue.

51
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,390
And Mrs Thatcher will be happy with me.

52
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,440
It's easy to wash a car.

53
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,690
You just wet a rag and rub.

54
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,990
You know how to rub, don't you?

55
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,450
I'd do this one first.

56
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,360
Carefully...

57
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,490
as if you were restoring
a Renaissance painting.

58
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,410
It's my car.

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
- Hi, baby.
- My love.

60
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,930
Here.

61
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,070
What do you think I am, your trampoline?

62
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
Speak my language, damn it.

63
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,540
I'll do nothing else, Nasser.

64
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,330
- Do you think we'll ever part?
- Not at the moment.

65
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,790
I'm serious.

66
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,670
Just keep moving.

67
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,340
Just there.

68
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,800
I love you.

69
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,470
Darling.

70
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,010
Christ, you move like a niner.

71
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,310
I love you, too. Can
we go away somewhere?

72
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,480
- Yes, I'm taking you.
- Where?

73
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,230
- Campton Park. Saturday.
- Really? Great. Can we take the boy?

74
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,490
- I've got big plans for the boy.
- You aren't gonna make him work.

75
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,210
By the way, Rachel is my old friend.

76
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,420
Hello.

77
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,080
How's Auntie Bilquis?

78
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,540
At home with the kids.

79
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,170
Papa sends his love.
Uncle, if I pick Papa up...

80
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,300
Have you ever been to a
high-class place like this before?

81
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,680
I suppose you spend most of the
time in your black-hole flat.

82
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,430
- If I pick Papa up, Uncle...
- He is one of those underprivileged types.

83
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,770
...and squeezed him,
squeezed Papa out like that...

84
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,150
I often imagine I'd get...

85
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,690
Two fat slaps.

86
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,030
Two bottles of pure vodka
and a kind of flap of skin.

87
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,530
Like a French letter.

88
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,450
What are you talking, madman?

89
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,625
I love my brother like I love you.

90
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,160
- I don't understand how you can love me.
- Because you're such a prick.

91
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,910
You can't be sure that I am.

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,160
Nasser.

93
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,750
She's right.

94
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,250
Don't deliberately
egg me on to laugh at you...

95
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,090
when I've brought you here to
tell you one essential thing.

96
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,090
Now, move closer.

97
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,510
Get up.

98
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,230
In this damn country,
which we hate and love...

99
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,230
you can get anything you want.

100
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,730
It's all spread out and available.

101
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,150
That's why I believe in England.

102
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,860
Only you have to know how to
squeeze the tits of the system.

103
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,120
He's saying that he wants to help you.

104
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,160
What do you want to do with me?

105
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,330
What am I going to do with you?

106
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,130
Turn you into something damn good.

107
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,420
Now your father can't do it, 
can he?

108
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,930
Here, damn fool.

109
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,260
Take it.

110
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,720
You're like a son to me.

111
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,270
To both of us.

112
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,030
You like the work?

113
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,290
Now come on, for Christ's sake.

114
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,920
Help me with my accounts.

115
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,820
Kiss Rachel.

116
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,210
I said give her a kiss, not a shower.

117
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,090
- I'll finish your paperwork tonight, Uncle.
- Such a good worker.

118
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,880
- I'm going to promote him.
- What to?

119
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,220
You come to my house next
week, and I'll tell you.

120
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,270
- It's a long way. How will he get there?
- I'll give him a car, damn it. That one over there.

121
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:52,890
The keys are in the
office. Anything he wants.

122
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,860
I've got a real challenge
lined up for him.

123
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,730
You must be getting married.

124
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,770
Why else do you dress like
an undertaker on holiday?

125
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,610
I'm going to Uncle's house, Papa.

126
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,940
He's given me a car.

127
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,900
Brakes must be faulty.

128
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,450
Look, tell me one thing...

129
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,545
'cause this is something I don't
understand. It must be my fault.

130
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,210
How is it that scrubbing cars could
make a son of mine look so ecstatic?

131
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,920
It gets me out of the house.

132
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,510
Look, don't get too involved 
with that crook.

133
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,880
You've got to go to college.

134
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,950
This is my nephew, Omar.

135
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,920
Auntie Fasia.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
Auntie Farida.

137
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,090
Auntie Salma.

138
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,180
And this is Cherry, Salim's wife.

139
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,520
Of course you remember our
three naughty daughters.

140
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,650
He has his family's cheekbones, Bilquis.

141
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,530
I know all your gorgeous
family in Karachi.

142
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:00,820
You've been there?

143
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,530
You stupid.

144
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,490
What a stupid.

145
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,370
It's my home.

146
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,330
How could anyone in their right mind...

147
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,080
call this silly little
island off Europe their home?

148
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,250
Every day in Karachi...

149
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,710
your other uncles and
cousins come to our house...

150
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,090
for bridge, booze and VCR.

151
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,220
Cherry, my little nephew knows
nothing about that life there.

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
God, I'm sick of hearing
about these in-betweens.

153
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,010
People should make up
their minds where they are.

154
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,060
Your uncle's next door.

155
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,360
Can you see me later?

156
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm so bored with these people.

157
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,200
Games room, okay?

158
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,050
I presume my brother, the boy's papa...

159
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,680
was out screwing some
barmaid, somewhere.

160
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,430
So, when these damn things went on...

161
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,730
I got out of bed, went to the
balcony and opened the door.

162
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,230
And there was my brother, he was
standing outside with some woman...

163
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,570
and they were completely
without clothes.

164
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,820
Blue with cold, like two bars of soap.

165
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,500
This I refer to as my
brother's blue period.

166
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,500
- But what happened to the woman?
- He married her.

167
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,130
Oh, come along, come along.

168
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,100
Now, your father is a good man.

169
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,310
Ah, so this is the famous Hussein's son.

170
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,060
The exact bastard.

171
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,770
My blue brother was also a
famous journalist in Bombay.

172
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,600
And a great drinker.

173
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,360
He was to the bottle what Louis
Armstrong is to the trumpet.

174
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
But you are to the bookies what
Mother Teresa is to the children.

175
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,320
Your brother was a clever one.

176
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,620
You used to carry his typewriter.

177
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,240
Isn't he coming tonight?

178
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,700
- What ever happened to him?
- Papa's lying down.

179
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,500
- I meant his career.
- That's lying down, also.

180
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,050
What chance would an Englishman give
a leftist, communist Pakistani...

181
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,510
- on newspapers?
- Socialist.

182
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,390
What chance would an Englishman
give a leftist, communist socialist?

183
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,310
What chance a racist
Englishman has given us...

184
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,020
that we haven't taken it
from him with our hands?

185
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,530
Best phrased, yaar?

186
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,530
Zaki, you need a stiff
drink, man, that good port.

187
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,870
Nasser, please, God.

188
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,450
I'm on the verge already.

189
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,540
Can I make you a drink?

190
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,170
Make him a man first.

191
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,630
Give him a drink, Zaki. I like him.

192
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,010
He's our future.

193
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,360
It's been years.

194
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,190
And you're looking really good now.

195
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,160
I think we understand each other, eh?

196
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,170
Were they being cruel to you
in their typical men's way?

197
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,000
You don't mind?

198
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,420
I think I should harden myself.

199
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,010
Wow. What are you into?

200
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,430
Your father's done well.

201
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,270
Has he?

202
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,240
He adores you.

203
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,120
I expect he wants you to
take over the businesses.

204
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,040
He wouldn't think of asking me.

205
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,880
But he is too vicious
to people in his work.

206
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,170
Doesn't want you to take over
that shitty laundrette, does he?

207
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,970
What's wrong with it?

208
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,220
And he has a mistress, doesn't he?

209
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,600
Rachel.

210
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,140
Yes.

211
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,390
I can tell from your face.

212
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,730
Does he love her?

213
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,890
Yes.

214
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,780
Please, Tania, can you come and help me?

215
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,990
Families.

216
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,820
I hate families.

217
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,290
Take care of him.

218
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,380
Good night, Uncle.

219
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,220
Take my advice. There's money in muck.

220
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,720
What is it that the gora
Englishman always needs?

221
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,850
Clean clothes.

222
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
Go on.

223
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,770
Pick it up.

224
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,150
Drive us back, will you?

225
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,030
You can pick your own car up tomorrow.
Salim's not feeling very well.

226
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,330
Hello, darling.

227
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,620
Fucking nice, man, I want to see it!

228
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,750
Get off the car, will you?

229
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,420
Get off the fucking car!

230
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,000
It's me.

231
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,510
I know who it is.

232
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,800
How are you? All right? Working?

233
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,810
What are you doing now?

234
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,100
This kind of thing.

235
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,905
Omar, come back! Come...

236
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,110
What are you now, a chauffeur?

237
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,150
No, I'm onto something.

238
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,990
What?

239
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,740
I'll let you know.

240
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,030
Still living at the same place?

241
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,250
No, I don't get on with my mom and dad.

242
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,750
You?

243
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,605
She died last year, my mother.

244
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,590
Jumped onto the railway lines.

245
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,720
Yeah, I heard.

246
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,260
All the trains stopped.

247
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,140
I'm still there.

248
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,310
Got my number?

249
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,520
Like my friends?

250
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,780
Ring us, then.

251
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,490
I will.

252
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,920
Leave them there.

253
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,090
We can do something now.

254
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,750
Just us.

255
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,340
Can't.

256
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,540
What are you doing?

257
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,670
I want to pee.

258
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,880
Can't you wait for me to take you?

259
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,340
My tool will drop off before
you show up, these days.

260
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,590
You know who I met? Johnny.

261
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,890
The boy who came here dressed as a
fascist with a quarter-inch of hair?

262
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,980
He was a friend once, for years.

263
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,400
There were times when he didn't
deserve your admiration so much.

264
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,410
Christ, I've known him since I was 5.

265
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,740
He went too far.

266
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,300
They hate us in England.

267
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,470
And all you can do is
to kiss their asses.

268
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,510
Think of yourself as a little Britisher.

269
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm being promoted...

270
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,150
to Uncle's laundrette.

271
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,780
Illustrate your washing methods.

272
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,440
It's nothing but a
toilet and a youth club.

273
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,940
A constant boil on my bum.

274
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,320
How's your foot, then?

275
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,360
Is it? Good.

276
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,200
Do you fancy coming for a walk, then?

277
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,210
- Where did you get those?
- Church.

278
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,510
You little bastard. That's
how machines get buggered.

279
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,590
What?

280
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,180
I'll come round then, shall I?

281
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,390
All right, see you in a minute.

282
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,480
All right, get started.

283
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,200
- You have the broom, move it.
- I don't only want to sweep up.

284
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,860
What are you, Labor Party?

285
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,030
I want to be manager of this
place. I think I can do it.

286
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,950
Please let me.

287
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,040
Here I was thinking how
to tell your father...

288
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,330
how four punks nearly drowned
you in a washing machine.

289
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,090
On the other hand, a little water on
the brain might clear your thoughts.

290
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,550
Okay, I'll charge you basic rent.

291
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,930
Above that, you keep.

292
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,720
You're everything to me.

293
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,520
Of course I prefer you to Jenny.

294
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,690
Get up.

295
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,270
Please, Salim.

296
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,860
I don't know how to make this place work.
I'm afraid I've made a fool of myself.

297
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,200
Never make a penny here. Your
uncle's given you a dead duck.

298
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,870
That's why I've decided
to help you, financially.

299
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,790
Go to this address near the airport.
Pick up some videocassettes...

300
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,580
and bring them straight back to my flat.

301
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,170
That's all.

302
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,660
Go and sit down.

303
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,670
- You're okay? No problems?
- No.

304
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,810
It's one of the best collections
of modern Indian paintings, Omar.

305
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,900
I patronize many painters.

306
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,960
Right.

307
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,330
I won't be a minute.

308
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,460
Make yourself comfortable.

309
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,970
Watch something, if you like.

310
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,800
You're one of us now, Omar.

311
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,170
Hello, can I speak to Johnny, please?

312
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,430
Right. Well, do you know 
where he's staying?

313
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,310
Are you sure?

314
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,480
No, I just wanted to help him.

315
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,730
Look, if you see him...

316
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,650
ask him to ring Omo.

317
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,625
Is that the tape playing?

318
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,040
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just watching something, Salim.

319
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,710
Not these. Who gave you
permission to touch these?

320
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,380
It's just a tape. What are you doing?

321
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,840
What business, Salim?

322
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,220
Nasser tells me you're ambitious.

323
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,680
But you've failed your exams twice.

324
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,190
You've done nothing with the laundrette,
and now you're trying to screw me up.

325
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,070
Become like those white
assholes that call us "wog", Omar.

326
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,740
Your family, rich and powerful
back home, has been let down by you.

327
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,830
Go on, fuck off.

328
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,590
Have you seen Johnny?

329
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,510
Piss off back to the jungle, wog-boy.

330
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,780
These people, they're too tough for you.

331
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,410
I'll tell Nasser you're
through with them.

332
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,040
Hello?

333
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,590
Why did you do that?

334
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,300
Useless fool.

335
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,850
- Hello?
- Now look!

336
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,930
- What?
- Bloody ass.

337
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,100
- What?
- You've amputated my entire fucking foot!

338
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,820
Didn't I say you
should've been a doctor?

339
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,690
- Hello?
- Typical, you know that?

340
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,740
Johnny.

341
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,410
Yeah, see you later, 
Johnny-boy.

342
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,990
I'll throw you out of this flat...

343
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,750
if you ever bring that
bum-liability friend of yours here.

344
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,130
I'm dead impressed by all this.

345
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,430
You were the one at
school, the one I liked.

346
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,020
All the Pakis like me.

347
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,650
I've been through all that,
with my parents and that...

348
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,650
and with people like you.

349
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,320
But now there's some pretty
big things I've got in mind.

350
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,740
I need to raise money
to make this place good.

351
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,370
And I want you to help me with that.

352
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,080
I want you to work here with me.

353
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,210
What kind of work is it?

354
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,540
A variety.

355
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,630
Variety of menial things.

356
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,050
Cleaning windows kind of thing, yeah?

357
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,075
Yeah, sure.

358
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,380
And you can start by
cleaning those bastards out.

359
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,340
Now?

360
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,570
I want everything done now.

361
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,000
That's the only attitude, if
you want to do anything big.

362
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,430
Christ.

363
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,020
Sorry, what happened before.

364
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,770
Too much to drink.

365
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,400
Just go on another little
errand for me. Same as before.

366
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,530
For 50 quid.

367
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,860
You little bastard.

368
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,510
All right.

369
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,200
Come on.

370
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,920
I saw Salim's game. This is
going to finance our whole future.

371
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,460
Cut him out.

372
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,420
You know where to sell
 this stuff, yeah?

373
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,130
Don't you?

374
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,640
I wouldn't be working for you now
if I wanted to go on being a bad boy.

375
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,260
This means more.

376
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,390
Real work. Expansion.

377
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,440
Salim will kill us.

378
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,690
We'll resell it fast, tonight.

379
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,440
Oh come on. I couldn't be doing
any of this without you.

380
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,490
Do you want some red?

381
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,070
Will you excuse me a moment?

382
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,320
Let's have a private chat, uh?

383
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,410
You can go.

384
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,910
You haven't paid me.

385
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,830
I'm not in the mood.

386
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,420
Nothing happened to you on the way here?

387
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:19,460
No.

388
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,890
Something may happen
to you on the way back.

389
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,460
She's nice.

390
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,680
Gosh.

391
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,360
Tell me a about the beach
in Bombay, Uncle. Juhu Beach.

392
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,360
Or the house in Lahore...

393
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,610
when Auntie Nina put the garden
hose in the window of Father's bedroom...

394
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,570
'cause he wouldn't get out of bed,
and Papa's bed started to float.

395
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,750
You look beautiful.

396
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,070
What about my laundrette?

397
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,490
Damn these stories about
places you've never been to.

398
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,410
- What are you doing, boy?
- What am I doing?

399
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,500
ItÂll be going into profit any day now,
partly because I've hired a bloke...

400
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,290
of astounding competence and
strength of body and mind...

401
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,380
to look after it with me.

402
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,760
Yasmeen, fiddle with my toes.

403
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,100
What bloke?

404
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,930
He's called Johnny.

405
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,310
And how are you going to pay him?

406
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,720
Nasser, sahab.

407
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,140
Zaki!

408
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,850
Everything is good.

409
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,310
But...

410
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,070
- Speak in English, so that the boy can understand you.
- Doesn't he understand his own language?

411
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,640
Not only that, I've given him that
pain-in-the-ass laundrette of mine to run.

412
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,190
I know.

413
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,280
But this is the point. He has
hired someone else to do the work.

414
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,310
Typically English, if I can say that.

415
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,420
You haven't fucked your uncle's 
laundrette, you little fool?

416
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,930
I don't think you should
talk to him like that, Uncle.

417
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,200
- Why, is he royalty?
- No. I don't like it.

418
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,750
She's a hot girl.

419
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,170
In my small opinion, much
good can come of fucking.

420
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,470
Your mouth has become very big lately.

421
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,050
Well?

422
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,220
All right.

423
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,390
Let's all take it easy.

424
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,190
Who is that sitting in the
drive? It's bothering me.

425
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,270
Some friend of yours?

426
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,280
- Zaki, please go and see who it is.
- It's only Johnny.

427
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,280
My friend. He works for me.

428
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,280
No one works without my permission.

429
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,330
Tania, bring him in.

430
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,380
How much good would come of
us fucking, later tonight?

431
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,550
I know why you put up with them.

432
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,720
'Cause there's so much you want.
You're greedy, like my father.

433
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,440
He's a great man.

434
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,690
Why did you leave him sitting out here?

435
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,900
He's lower class. He won't
come in without being asked.

436
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:43,870
Unless he's doing a burglary.

437
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,830
My father wants to see you.

438
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,660
- How's Salim today?
- Wearing too much perfume.

439
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,120
Eyelash.

440
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,930
I said to Miss Street, "I'm
the law. I create the world. "

441
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,180
Tania, please.

442
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,810
- You like Tania?
- Oh, yeah.

443
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,520
I'll see what I can do.

444
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,900
And now on to business.

445
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,150
I've been to see the laundrette.

446
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,030
You boys will make a
beautiful job of it, I know.

447
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,200
You need nothing more there.

448
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,070
But in exchange...

449
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,910
I want you to do something.

450
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,330
You look like a tough chap.

451
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,790
I've got some bastard tenants in one
of my houses that I cannot get rid of.

452
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:37,630
No. I don't do nothing rough no more.

453
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,010
I'm not looking for a mass
murderer, you bloody fool.

454
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,430
- What does it involve, please?
- Unscrewing.

455
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,390
Your favorite subject, Salim.

456
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,270
For Christ's sake.

457
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,480
What's this "unscrewing"?

458
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,900
You're getting into some
family business, that's all.

459
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,440
What the hell else is there
left for you in this country now?

460
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,280
Send him to the garage and call
Tania. Ask her to bring some champagne.

461
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,620
We'll drink to Thatcher and
your beautiful laundrette.

462
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,750
- Do they go together?
- Like dal and chapattis.

463
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,500
- To us.
- Cheers.

464
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,390
Timber's coming tomorrow
morning. Getting it cheap.

465
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,890
I've had a vision of
how our place can be.

466
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,020
Why don't people like laundrettes?

467
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,810
Because they're like toilets.

468
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,940
This could be a Ritz among laundrettes.

469
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,360
A launderette as big as the Ritz.

470
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,700
Oh yes.

471
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,690
Clean it out.

472
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,360
Why are you working for these people?

473
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,570
Pakis?

474
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,200
It's work, that's why.

475
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,360
I want to do some work, for a change,
instead of all this hanging around.

476
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,330
- What, you're jealous?
- No, I'm angry, Johnny.

477
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,950
I don't like to see one of
our blokes groveling to Pakis.

478
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,500
Look, they came over here 
to work for us.

479
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,340
That's why we brought them over. Okay?

480
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,020
Don't cut yourself off
from your own people.

481
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,060
There's no one else
who really wants you.

482
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,770
Everyone has to belong.

483
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,040
I can't ask you in.

484
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,460
You better get back to your father.

485
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,080
I didn't think you'd ever mention him.

486
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,130
He helped me, didn't
he, when I was at school?

487
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,010
Yeah.

488
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,220
And what did you do but hurt him?

489
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,140
I want to forget all of them things.

490
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,860
I passed by the laundrette.

491
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,610
So, you gave them the money to do it up?

492
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,580
Where did they get it from, I wonder?

493
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,910
Government grant. Almost
just like us, yaar.

494
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,830
It's your bloody family.

495
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,130
So, like you, God knows
what he does for money.

496
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,760
Come on in.

497
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,680
That joker's a bad influence
on Omar, I'm sure of it.

498
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,220
There's some things between
them I'm looking into.

499
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,020
So they let you out of
prison. Too crowded, was it?

500
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,310
Unscrew.

501
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,570
He's changed the lock.

502
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,690
You better take off the whole
door, in case he changes it again.

503
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,070
He's only a poet with no money.

504
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,160
I ain't hurting nobody, okay?

505
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
That door you've just
taken off, hang it back.

506
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,970
Excuse me.

507
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,100
I'm just a poor man. This is my
room. Let's leave it that way!

508
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,360
Thieving Uncle Tom
parasite! I will kill you!

509
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,200
Glory of God!

510
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,710
Throw this bugger out!

511
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,970
Filthy, imperialist swine! Working dog!

512
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,010
Enemy of the Third World!

513
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,970
You and your kind,
your days are numbered!

514
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,320
Doesn't look too good, does it?
Pakis doing this kind of thing.

515
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,650
Why not?

516
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,360
What would your enemies
have to say about this?

517
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,870
Ain't exactly integration, is it?

518
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,990
I'm a professional businessman,
not a professional Pakistani.

519
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,540
And there is no question of race
in the new enterprise culture.

520
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,130
I'll forward your mail!

521
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,440
Do you like the room?

522
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,190
Omar says you have nowhere
to live. I won't charge.

523
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,950
- Why not?
- You can unscrew.

524
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,490
That's confirmed beautifully.

525
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,450
But can you unblock?

526
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,910
Can you keep this zoo 
under control, mmn?

527
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,650
I wish Salim could see this.

528
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,900
Why?

529
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,650
He's on to us.

530
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,280
Yes, he's just biding his
time, and then he'll get us.

531
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,280
- Moose, make yourself useful.
- You've taken the room at Nasser's place?

532
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:48,490
Make sure you pay the rent, otherwise you'll
have to chuck yourself out of the window.

533
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,580
Moose.

534
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,550
That'll do.

535
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,940
Let's open. The whole world's waiting.

536
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,690
I've invited Nasser to the
launch, and Papa's coming.

537
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,780
- They're not here yet.
- Papa hasn't been out for months.

538
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,070
We can't move till he arrives.

539
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,200
- What time did they say they'd be here?
- An hour ago.

540
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,160
They ain't gonna come.

541
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,080
Follow me.

542
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,570
- Shall I open the champagne, then?
- Didn't I predict this?

543
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,160
You did, man.

544
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,280
This whole stinking area's on its
knees, begging for clean trousers.

545
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,910
The jewel in the jacksy,
South London, this place'll be.

546
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,120
Jesus Christ.

547
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,710
Do you want to open the place up?

548
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,350
Not till Papa comes, remember?

549
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,230
Your father?

550
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,190
He went out of his way with you...

551
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,650
and with all my friends.

552
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,940
He did, didn't he?

553
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,990
Omar, what you on about, man?

554
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,070
About how, years later,
he saw the same boys.

555
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,660
And what were they doing?

556
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:44,740
What?

557
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,910
Marching.

558
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
Marching through Lewisham.

559
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,340
It was bricks and
bottles and Union Jacks.

560
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,210
It was "Immigrants Out," kill us.

561
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,970
People we knew.

562
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,470
And it was you.

563
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,560
He saw you marching, and you
saw his face watching you.

564
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,730
Don't deny it. We were
there when you went past.

565
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,570
Papa hated himself and he hated his job.

566
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,540
He was afraid on the streets for me...

567
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,040
so he took it out on her,
and she couldn't bear it.

568
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,880
Such failure.

569
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,760
Such emptiness.

570
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,590
Come on, hurry up. We're waiting.

571
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,680
There ain't nothing I can
say to make it up to you.

572
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,270
There's only things
I can do to show you...

573
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,690
that I am with you.

574
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,200
What a beautiful thing
they've done with it, isn't it?

575
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,030
Oh, God. And with music, too.

576
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,080
It's like a wonderful ship. I'd no idea.

577
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,250
He's a marvel, that boy, I tell you.

578
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,540
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I tell you everything five times.

579
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,870
At least.

580
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,460
Am I a bad man to you?

581
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,840
You are sometimes careless.

582
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,220
Dance with me.

583
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,100
We are learning.

584
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,930
But where are those two buggers?

585
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,040
Of course, Johnny did all the
physical work on this.

586
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,580
You're fond of that boy.

587
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,130
I wish I could do something more to help
the other deadbeat children like him.

588
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,920
And you're tired of work.

589
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,260
It's time I became a holy man.

590
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,970
- A sadhu of South London.
- Yes.

591
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,100
But first, we must marry Omar off.

592
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,100
- Shit!
- Typical.

593
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,740
What the hell are you doing? Sunbathing?

594
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,490
Asleep, Uncle. We were shagged out.

595
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,740
Where's Papa?

596
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,380
Would you do us the honour, madam?

597
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,300
- Love to.
- Here.

598
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,640
Okay.

599
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,720
We thought we'd do the
bloody area a favor, you know.

600
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Lift up the place a bit.

601
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,220
I can't do that. Here you are.

602
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,730
- Hello, welcome.
- Hello.

603
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,560
Enjoying your wash?

604
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,900
Lovely.

605
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,280
Laundrettes are impossible.
I've got two laundrettes.

606
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:04,120
Two ulcers, plus piles.

607
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,910
Hello? Angela?

608
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,620
It's me.

609
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,540
- What's your surname?
- Berthoty.

610
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,800
That's it. I know your mother.

611
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,440
I thought Papa might
just make it today, Uncle.

612
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,270
He said he never visits laundrettes.

613
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,150
Angela, be reasonable.

614
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,950
You can always buy some
new ones, can't you?

615
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,940
Ah good. It's Tania.

616
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,450
I've never met her, but
she has a beautiful face.

617
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,960
Who invited Tania, damn it?

618
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,670
I did, Uncle.

619
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,830
Do you two know each other?

620
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,960
At last. After so long
in my family's life.

621
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,340
Bring Tania over here.

622
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,170
Tania, I do feel that I know you.

623
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,260
But you don't.

624
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,430
Marry her. What's wrong with her?

625
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,020
When I say marry her,
you damn well do it.

626
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,600
I don't mind my father
having a mistress.

627
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,090
Oh good. I'm so grateful!

628
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,650
I don't mind my father
spending our money on you...

629
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,940
Why don't you mind?

630
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:01,110
Please be nice to her.
Pressure off my fucking head.

631
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,690
...or my father being with
you, instead of with our mother.

632
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,030
Your penis works, doesn't it?

633
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,870
But I don't like women who live off men.

634
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,410
Get going.

635
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:15,580
That's a pretty disgusting,
parasitical thing, isn't it?

636
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,960
Tania, come and look at the spin dryers.

637
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,590
They're fluff drying.

638
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,010
But tell me, who do you live off?

639
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,730
And you must understand...

640
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,480
we're of different generations...

641
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,560
different classes.

642
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,780
Everything is waiting for you.

643
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,280
The only thing that has
ever waited for me...

644
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,700
is your father.

645
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,080
We'd better get going. See you, boys.

646
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,630
No, I am not drunk, Angela.

647
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,550
I told you, I'm not gonna see her again.

648
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:11,760
How could I? I didn't
ask her to come, Rachel.

649
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,350
Please...

650
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,220
I'll explain to you.

651
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,690
Darling, listen.

652
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,730
Please listen to me.

653
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,190
It's not my fault, I
didn't ask her to come.

654
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,110
Didn't you, then? Who did?

655
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,950
- The boys!
- That's what you say.

656
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,530
You made me look stupid.

657
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,950
Can we go to the club or
something, for God's sake?

658
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,040
No! I'm not going anywhere with you.

659
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,500
Please.

660
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,320
- Goodbye, Omar. 
- Bye-bye.

661
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,040
I want to leave home.

662
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,420
I need to break away.

663
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,210
You'll have to help me, financially.

664
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,260
As well as everything else, why
don't you go up the Palace no more?

665
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Palace ain't my team.

666
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,680
Millwall me.

667
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,940
I'm drunk.

668
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,900
- Will you marry me?
- What about England?

669
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,490
I bet you don't even support
England anymore, do you?

670
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,530
- Palace gave you a trial, didn't they?
- Yeah.

671
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:51,410
Told my mum Palace
wanted me for a sweeper.

672
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,740
She said, "I reckon
that's about your level. "

673
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,040
If you can get me some money.

674
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,130
Omo's getting married.

675
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,260
I'm afraid you owe me
an awful lot of money.

676
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,680
The beard, remember?

677
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:20,100
Good, it's all coming back. I think I better 
have that money back, don't you?

678
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,360
- I haven't got money like that now.
- Because it's all in the laundrette.

679
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,200
I'd better have a decent
down payment, then.

680
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,620
About half.

681
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,740
By the time Nasser has
his annual party, say?

682
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,670
Or I'll instruct him to
get rid of the laundrette.

683
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,910
It took you a while to get on to us.

684
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:01,750
Wanted to see what you'd
do. How's your Papa?

685
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:07,210
So many books written and read.
Politicians sought him out.

686
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,550
Bhutto was his close friend.

687
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,590
But we're nothing in
England without money.

688
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,560
I told you already.

689
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,400
Come on, Angela.

690
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,440
That's stupid.

691
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,800
Of course I won't.

692
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,220
Of course not.

693
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,560
Who told you that, anyway?

694
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,470
Didn't I tell you?

695
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,760
Didn't I tell you about
that noise last night?

696
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,650
Where did you go? You just disappeared.

697
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,030
Drinking, I went. With my old mates.

698
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,290
It ain't illegal.

699
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,870
Of course it is. Laundrettes
are a big commitment.

700
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,910
Why aren't you at work?

701
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,670
ItÂll be closing time soon.

702
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,960
You'll be locking the
place up, and coming to bed.

703
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,550
No, it never closes.

704
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,970
One of us has got to be there.
That way, we begin to make money.

705
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,800
- You're getting greedy.
- I want big money.

706
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,760
I'm not gonna be beat
down by this country.

707
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,520
When we were at school, you and your
friends kicked me all around the place.

708
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,350
And what are you doing
now? Washing my floor.

709
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,230
That's how I like it.

710
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,110
Now get to work.

711
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,740
Get to work, I said,
or else you're fired.

712
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:25,920
What about you?

713
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,380
I don't want to see
you for a little while.

714
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,170
I got some big thinking to do.

715
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,390
But today...

716
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,180
it's been the best day.

717
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,860
Yeah, almost the best day.

718
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,690
I recognize you, at least.

719
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,070
We was expecting you today.

720
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,320
I've come.

721
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,290
The invitation was for 3:00, Mr. Ali.

722
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,410
It's only 3:10 now.

723
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,045
You know...

724
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,500
I thought I'd come to the wrong place.

725
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:36,140
That I'd suddenly found myself in a
ladies' hairdressing salon in Pinner...

726
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,930
where one might get a pink rinse.

727
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,060
Do you do a good pink rinse?

728
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,150
Or are you still a fascist?

729
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,620
You used to give us a
lot of good advice, sir...

730
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,370
- when I was little.
- When you were little.

731
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,675
What's it made of you?

732
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,670
Are you a politician? Journalist?

733
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,750
Trade unionist?

734
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,010
No.

735
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,010
You're an underpants cleaner.

736
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,690
Oh, dear.

737
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,360
The working class is such a
great disappointment to me.

738
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,990
I ain't made much of myself.

739
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,160
You'd better get on and do something.

740
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,180
Help me.

741
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,810
I don't want my son in this...

742
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,520
underpants-cleaning condition.

743
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,180
I want him reading in college.

744
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,730
You tell him.

745
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,440
You go to college.

746
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,440
He must have knowledge.
We all must, now...

747
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:25,450
if we're to see clearly what
is being done and to whom...

748
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,910
in this country.

749
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,290
Right?

750
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,710
- I don't know. It depends on what he wants.
- No.

751
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,550
You use your influence.

752
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,970
Not a bad dump you've got here.

753
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,520
What did you make me
come all this way for?

754
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,110
- What's going on?
- It's heavy, man.

755
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:40,150
Bilquis is making magic potions
from leaves, bird beaks and stuff.

756
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,780
She's putting them on Rachel.

757
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,870
Is it working?

758
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:50,000
The furniture is shaking. The
trousers are walking by themselves.

759
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,420
Rachel's come out in a rash.

760
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,500
Glass is all over the place.

761
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,980
I'm out.

762
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,450
Salim's got to have money, soon.

763
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,990
A lot of money. He's threatened me.

764
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,300
This city's chock-full of money.

765
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:26,590
- When I used to want money...
- You'd steal it.

766
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,760
Decide, now, if you want
it to be like that again.

767
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,230
She's illiterate. Tania's
writing to her sister for her.

768
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,820
Bilquis is thinking about
going back to Pakistan...

769
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,990
after she's hospitalized
Rachel with her potion.

770
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,370
Nasser's on a marathon sulk.

771
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:53,000
He's going for the world record.

772
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,870
We'll just have to do
a job to get the money.

773
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:00,290
- I don't want you going back to all that.
- Just to get us through.

774
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,630
We're going to go on.

775
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,630
You want that, don't you?

776
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,340
Yeah. I want you.

777
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,600
Fuck me, what's she
doing with that mouse?

778
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,180
Bilquis!

779
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,400
God damn you!

780
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:57,190
Who does he reckon he is, your
uncle, some kind of big, gaspy geezer?

781
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,810
Right, maybe this just ain't my world.

782
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,030
- Still getting married?
- I can't really get out of it, can I?

783
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:06,070
If you wiggle fast
enough, you can, I reckon.

784
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,620
England needs more young men like Omar.

785
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,210
The more boys like that, the better.

786
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,720
Now that Cherry's pregnant...

787
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,680
I will buy a house, and
we'll have many children.

788
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,360
Oh yes, yes. Listen, Zaki, 
here is Omar.

789
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:07,080
You talk to him about your laundrette.
He will run it for you with Johnny.

790
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,620
Omar, my boy.

791
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,250
I got these two damned
laundrettes in your area.

792
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:15,380
- I need big advice on them.
- I won't advise you...

793
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,710
if the laundrettes are
giving you trouble,

794
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,960
I'll pay you rent for them plus
a percentage of the profits.

795
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,580
Really?

796
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:25,010
Please, can you take
charge of the music for us?

797
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,560
You've taken a great weight off my head.

798
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,060
It's a deal.

799
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,200
I've got it.

800
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,200
The installment.

801
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,830
It's hefty, Salim.

802
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,260
Don't ever offer me money.

803
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,350
It was an educational
test I put on you...

804
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:51,060
to make you see you did a wrong thing.

805
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:00,240
Don't, in future, bite the family
hand when you can eat out of it.

806
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,785
You need money, just ask me.

807
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:07,200
Years ago, your uncles lifted me
up, and I will do the same thing.

808
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,430
All right. He's no one.

809
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,510
Bitch. What the hell is going on here?

810
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,430
- Can't you control your bloody people?
- What do you mean?

811
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,690
Why should you be able to?

812
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,730
You gamble most of your 
money down the toilet.

813
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:38,480
That smooth suppository owns us.
Our education, your businesses...

814
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:40,530
Rachel's stockings. It's his.

815
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:43,240
- I thought you two were getting married.
- Yes, any day now.

816
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,870
- I'd rather drink my own urine.
- It can be tasty with a slice of lemon.

817
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,490
Get out of my sight.

818
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,700
I'm going further than that.

819
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,130
- Let's get out of here.
- Take me.

820
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,800
- Salim will give us a lift.
- What?

821
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,720
I need him for something
I've got in mind.

822
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,600
So, I was talking to Zaki about it. I
want to take over both of his laundrettes.

823
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,650
- He's got no idea.
- None.

824
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,060
Do them up with this money.

825
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,570
Is it enough?

826
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:22,200
I thought you might want to
come in with me, financially.

827
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,280
Yeah. I could do with some 
straight outlets.

828
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,660
You're a smart bastard.

829
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,590
Look at them. What a waste of life.

830
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,460
They're filthy, ignorant.

831
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:42,680
They don't respect people,
especially our people, Omar.

832
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:46,300
What this scum needs is
a taste of their own piss.

833
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:21,380
Right, I think I can
do something with this.

834
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,800
Me and my partner.

835
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,180
Take it.

836
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,270
I trust you and your family.

837
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,530
I'd happily put money into it, Omar.

838
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:44,910
Right.

839
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,080
Wait a minute.

840
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,040
Want to come in and take
a look at this place?

841
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,380
Think we can do something with it?

842
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,090
- Can't tell without seeing it.
- Well come on, then.

843
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:06,260
Not if that scum Salim's there.

844
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,850
I'm going.

845
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,350
Where?

846
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:29,850
Away.

847
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,320
I'm going.

848
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,200
You can come.

849
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,830
No good jobs like this around.

850
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:54,710
Omar just runs you around
everywhere, like a servant.

851
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:57,050
I'll stay here with my friend...

852
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,380
and fight it out.

853
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,720
My family, Salim and all...

854
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,140
will swallow you up like a little kebab.

855
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,600
I couldn't leave him.

856
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,810
Not now.

857
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,110
Don't ask me to.

858
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,030
You ever touched him?

859
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,600
So, today is the saddest day for us.

860
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,600
I thought that I'm taking you
too much away from your family.

861
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,400
Love...

862
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,440
money...

863
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,030
you.

864
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:51,700
Besides, it's not possible
to enjoy being hated so much.

865
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,910
Your wife is a brilliant woman.

866
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,580
Oh, my God.

867
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:04,340
And what's worse, my furniture
keeps moving about the room.

868
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,190
It's not what I'm used to.

869
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:07,960
The council's been around.

870
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,510
We've had a time.

871
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,430
A short time.

872
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,850
A nice time.

873
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,830
I want to talk to Omo...

874
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,170
about business.

875
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,250
Don't know where he is.

876
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:47,510
Is it worth waiting?

877
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:51,550
In my experience, it's
always worth waiting for Omo.

878
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:36,990
Paki!

879
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,930
Listen, damn country has done us in.

880
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,140
That's why I'm like this.

881
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,810
We should be there.

882
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:01,730
Home.

883
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:07,650
But that country's been
sodomized by religion.

884
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:12,200
It's beginning to interfere
with the making of money.

885
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,950
Compared with everywhere...

886
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,370
it's a little heaven, here.

887
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:29,670
You are planning an
armada of laundrettes?

888
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,590
What do you think of dry cleaners?

889
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,300
They're the past.

890
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:36,770
But then, they are the present, also.

891
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:38,350
Mostly, they are the past.

892
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,740
He'll die.

893
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,120
Fuck a varmint!

894
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,120
Salim, get out of here!

895
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,430
Come on, Genghis!

896
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:13,390
Come on, my son.

897
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:17,310
Listen to me, Genghis,
I don't want to fight!

898
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,100
- Tough.
- Kill him!

899
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,230
Hit him!

900
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,400
- Come on.
- Kill him, Genghis!

901
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:33,990
That's enough, man.

902
01:27:34,025 --> 01:27:35,450
Kill the bastard.

903
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,750
Come on, Genghis!

904
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:45,130
Why are you so unhappy?

905
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:58,730
Rachel's left me, and I don't
know what I'm going to do.

906
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,300
Fuck you!

907
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,370
Still look after you. I'm finished.

908
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,750
Only Omar matters.

909
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,630
I'll make sure he's fixed up
with a good business future.

910
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,540
And marriage?

911
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,300
I'm working on it.

912
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,550
Is Tania a possibility?

913
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:20,390
Where the hell are you going?

914
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,550
- I...
- What?

915
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,970
I think I better go.

916
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,100
I think I had.

917
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:57,100
You were always going at school.
Always running about, you.

918
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,310
Christ, your hand is bad.

919
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:03,810
I couldn't even pin you down, then.

920
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,610
And now I'm going again.
Give us my handbag.

921
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,280
You're dirty. You're beautiful.

922
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,910
I'm serious. Don't keep touching me.
