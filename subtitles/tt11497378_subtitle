1
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,291
Hey, Biley!

2
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
Biley?

3
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,500
Where did you go?

4
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,000
-What did I tell you?
-What’s the matter?

5
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,166
Why're you bellowing like a bull?

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,208
He is coming.
Told you he would.

7
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,291
You paid no heed to me.

8
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,750
Who's coming, Sukumar Uncle?

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,791
I'll tell you…
Be patient.

10
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,041
For now, get two cups of tea.

11
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,166
Yes, certainly.

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,875
Make two cups of tea.

13
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,208
Who's coming? When? Why?

14
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,541
What did I tell you?

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,333
Punu has not forgotten you.
He can't.

16
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,333
I see.

17
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,375
-So, the function was today?
-Yes.

18
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Hence, this royal attire!

19
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,666
But who's coming?
You seem so excited!

20
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,208
Let’s just say...

21
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,708
Borun Babu’s friend.

22
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,458
ADAPTED FROM
RAMAPADA CHOWDHURY'S 'CHHAD'

23
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,708
BORUN BABUR FRIEND

24
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,541
-Yes?
-I'm from Bakyalap magazine.

25
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,000
Sudhir sent these.

26
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,750
Okay, okay.

27
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,625
Please accept our best wishes
on your 80th birthday, sir.

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,041
Oh!

29
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,791
And this is our special edition.

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,875
This has your article as well.

31
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,166
That’s fine, okay.

32
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,625
-Sudhir shouldn't have bothered.
-It's no big deal.

33
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,500
How can we forget your birthday?

34
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,416
-I'll take your leave then.
-You just can't go like that.

35
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,541
-At least have some tea…
-No, no.

36
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,083
-Swapna…
-Yes.

37
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,541
-Please make us some tea.
-Don't bother.

38
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,750
-Just come on in.
-Okay.

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,541
-Who’s come so early in the morning?
-It’s Grandpa’s birthday today so…

40
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,083
Someone gave him some flowers.

41
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,958
And a present.

42
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,833
Didn’t I ask you to get some meat?

43
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,541
I’ll bring it.
But don’t go over the top.

44
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,416
My old man doesn't like it.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,708
It doesn’t look good
if we don’t cook something special.

46
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,958
Get the leg piece.

47
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,416
I'll go pay my respects...
Come along.

48
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,958
Just hang on.

49
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,125
"Cha" is tea.

50
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,708
-Go and give the tea.
-"Cha tea!"

51
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,208
What did Grandpa call Dad
when he was young?

52
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,250
-Don’t be cheeky.
-Tell me please.

53
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,291
Grandpa said your dad's name
should have been Useless.

54
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,083
What does that mean?

55
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,708
Have you called your dad?
it's his birthday.

56
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,625
There's no point.

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,166
The landline keeps ringing,
he can hardly hear.

58
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,958
He's too obstinate to use a mobile.
We'll visit him this evening anyway.

59
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,125
How old is he turning today?

60
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,208
-Born in 1938...so 80.
-Eighty, my God!

61
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,666
-You should’ve done something special.
-Like what?

62
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,916
Throw a party?
Give me some tea.

63
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,083
Yes.

64
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,666
The old man is against any fuss
on his birthdays.

65
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,875
What can we give him?

66
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:05,083
He's got a lot of clothes already...
I'll see to it.

67
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,625
It's Grandpa's birthday.
Hope you remember.

68
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,875
I can’t make it.
Night shift.

69
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,333
At least call him once.

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,958
Here.

71
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,458
If I call, he'll find faults
with my Bengali.

72
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,208
And a stream of lectures will follow!

73
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,958
You’ll do well to listen to him.

74
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,208
He's good in both Bengali and English.

75
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,250
Coming from Gurgaon
is no big deal, Dad.

76
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,625
But you are so staid...
You don’t want to celebrate.

77
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,500
Here, speak to your son-in-law.

78
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,541
-Why?
-Take it.

79
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,416
-Rai!
-Yeah!

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,708
Happy birthday, sir!
Many happy returns of the day.

81
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,500
-Take care.
-What?

82
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,958
Your granddaughter is here.

83
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,166
Cynical old man!

84
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,333
What do you mean?

85
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,500
Hello!

86
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,875
Hi Grandpa!
Happy birthday!

87
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,666
Stay blessed, okay?
And have a blast.

88
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,000
Not a bomb blast!
You're too funny!

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,791
-Mom wants to speak to you.
-Yes, give it here.

90
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,041
-Like father like daughter.
-Keep quiet.

91
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,250
What are your plans today?

92
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,958
Huh?

93
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:20,458
-Moushumi must be cooking lots of food.
-Mutton?

94
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,583
Is your sister coming?

95
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,166
-Brother?
-Everyone will be there.

96
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,166
-And your best friend?
-Pele!

97
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,125
Yes.

98
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,375
How is Mom?

99
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,500
I’ll take your leave today, sis.

100
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,333
You could’ve come in the evening.

101
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:56,375
I can't cope with the crowd in the trains
on the way back.

102
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,708
I’ll meet Brother-in-Law
on my way out.

103
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,833
Keep this picture of Lord Rama
under your pillow.

104
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
I’m off.

105
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,000
Ah, here is my grandson.

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,666
Wait…

107
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,625
-Here we go.
-Chocolates give you cavities.

108
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,625
One chocolate will do no harm.

109
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:28,333
Pop one in and
the cavities will be turned out!

110
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,541
See you.

111
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,625
Grandma, I found these flowers
in the verandah.

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,416
You can wish Grandpa with these.

113
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,333
-I’m making a card for Grandpa.
-Good.

114
00:09:53,916 --> 00:10:04,458
Remind your mother to send
some dessert to the Kali temple.

115
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,958
-Arati.
-Yes, ma'am.

116
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:19,083
Tell Moushumi to take out the holy flowers
from the dessert.

117
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,875
Okay.

118
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,416
He doesn’t like rituals.

119
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,333
What should I do with the prawns?

120
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,875
Clean and marinate them
with salt and turmeric.

121
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,208
-Then I'll see to it.
-Master chef in action.

122
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,250
Today's my brother's birthday.

123
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,875
-That's right.
-Yes.

124
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,958
Today is the birthday of another great man.
So he is in good company.

125
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,375
But you know what?

126
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:54,333
What's the point of celebrating a birthday?
His days are numbered.

127
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,875
Don’t talk rubbish.

128
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,458
As long as he's around,
this is the least I can do.

129
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,958
I can’t go.

130
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,458
Make up some excuse.

131
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,583
(TV playing)

132
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,458
What are you scribbling?

133
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,500
-A letter.
-To whom?

134
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,833
-We're too old for love letters.
-A letter to the editor.

135
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:38,041
A pro-government economist
has written a dicey article!

136
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:44,250
I'm penning an apt reply.

137
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,916
You've aged yet politics still haunts you.

138
00:11:51,541 --> 00:12:00,625
Sukumar, as long as you live,
politics will influence your life.

139
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:08,750
You're always complaining politics
ruined your football career.

140
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,416
The more you think about it,
the more it hurts.

141
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,125
Wow! You’ve almost completed the crossword!

142
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,416
I complete it most days
but not today.

143
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:33,875
Satyajit Ray had come up with
a strange name for crosswords.

144
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,250
-Wordspook!
-Dare I say?

145
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,541
There are two left.

146
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,791
Twenty two up and down
and twenty eight across.

147
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,500
Why don't you try?

148
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,250
Me?

149
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,875
An English crossword!

150
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,125
Why don’t you just send me home?

151
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,166
Why will you go home now?
Wait!

152
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,583
They’ve cooked meat, Pilaf...
If you don’t eat I'll get indigestion.

153
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,500
Stay put.

154
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,833
How much are the lilies?

155
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,250
-Fifty rupees a piece.
-Goodness me!

156
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,666
This is not the wedding season.

157
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,166
Lilies are always a bit expensive.

158
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,375
These days it's cheaper
to buy cauliflowers instead.

159
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,458
How much are the roses and carnations?

160
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,250
They are twenty rupees a piece.
They are really fresh.

161
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,500
Even these are so expensive.

162
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,291
Those chrysanthemums
will fit your budget.

163
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,583
Yes, that’s right.

164
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,708
-Give me a dozen chrysanthemums.
-Yellow or white?

165
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,458
Give me a mix of the two.
Put some of those and decorate them.

166
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,083
I get it.
Make it look big. Right?

167
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,416
He just won’t answer the phone.

168
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,125
What else have you got for dad
apart from flowers?

169
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:10,916
That pen set you were gifted.
You hardly ever use it.

170
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:17,916
-Dad writes a lot.
-Just a pen set? won't it look bad?

171
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,041
Why didn’t you give him that shawl
we got from Kashmir last year?

172
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,208
I’ve never worn it.

173
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,375
Are you mad?
Do you know how much it costs?

174
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,291
It’s a pure Kashmiri shawl.

175
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:37,916
You took the effort to cook some prawns.
That's more than enough.

176
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,708
(TV playing)

177
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,416
I can’t remember
when my other brother died.

178
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,541
The only sibling I have now
is my eldest brother.

179
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:56,208
Couple of years back you wouldn't
have allowed me to do a thing.

180
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:04,000
Now I've become kind of decrepit.

181
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,666
I feel like cooking
different kinds of dishes.

182
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,500
(TV playing)

183
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,666
I tried explaining to Moushumi...

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,708
...how to make Rohu fish
with poppy seeds.

185
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,458
Couldn’t make it.

186
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,083
Who knows how
the mutton will turn out!

187
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,583
-It will be fine, don’t worry.
-Ma'am, come on.

188
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,916
-Happy birthday, Dad. This is for you.
-Oh!

189
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,208
I don't believe in these customs.

190
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:55,208
However, you ought to remember
there's another senior present...

191
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh yes, I’m so sorry.

192
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:02,666
No, no… I’m not old like him.
I am still young.

193
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,416
-That is…
-Wait… Yes come on.

194
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,000
I can never decide what to gift you.

195
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,625
You write a lot, so this is for you.

196
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,541
As they say,
the pen is stronger than sword.

197
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,250
-It is mightier than the sword.
-Oh.

198
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,583
I don’t think that saying
is relevant today.

199
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,083
How will I describe your creations?

200
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,916
How will I disperse your compassion?

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,750
Will I win over their hearts and soul
With the sweetness of your love?

202
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,041
What should I sing...

203
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,541
She is singing already.

204
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,416
-Quiet.
-Auntie is singing.

205
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,666
So why is she asking
what to sing ?

206
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,625
...today in this abode of joy
Chanting your name

207
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:14,208
The moon and the stars rush
To the boundless oblivion

208
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,250
From the sun...

209
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,500
-Ma'am.
-Softly!

210
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:22,166
...the stream of love flows
From planet to planet

211
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,916
The vast sky, the blue lotuses

212
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:33,291
Always radiant in your rays

213
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:44,541
Floating endlessly in your ocean of love

214
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:50,791
What should I sing?
How can I extol your virtues?

215
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:56,500
Today in this abode of joy

216
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,375
Bravo, bravo!

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,625
You sing so well.
Don't give up singing.

218
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,750
Just what happened to me…
Trying to manage the household.

219
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,833
Why don't you participate
in talent shows on TV?

220
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,458
Commuting daily to Serampore
leaves no time for singing.

221
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,375
I get offers for shows
but I can’t accept them.

222
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,333
-How are you getting on in office?
-Just like any other civil servant.

223
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,708
The government won't raise our DA.
If you ask for it, you're told off.

224
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,500
Do you know the catchphrase
of the pay commission?

225
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
"Paying less is our mission!"

226
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,875
What about your transfer?

227
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,708
That promotion has been stuck.
I'd be glad to get away from here.

228
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,000
What is the doctor saying about Mom?

229
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,791
Not too good.
It’ll just go on like this.

230
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,666
Money is draining out.
A nurse for seven days.

231
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,666
Smoking is injurious to health.

232
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,916
-Don't interfere when adults talk.
-Call me when you do kid's talk.

233
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,833
You were saying...

234
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,041
Mom has her expenses
but Dad too.

235
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,000
Medicines and so many tests...

236
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,583
He hadn't registered
with the central health scheme.

237
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,291
Lack of foresight.

238
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:17,000
-Weren’t you going to meet an MP?
-I did but Dad has to lobby as well.

239
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:21,166
-He refuses to take any favours.
-What favour? It’s his right.

240
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,000
He's so obstinate.

241
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,708
His savings are feeling the strain.
It’ll affect ours as well.

242
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,625
I’ve been meaning to say this for long...

243
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,833
You earn more
so increase your contribution.

244
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:39,291
I give less but I'm here
with them all day.

245
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,583
I don’t disagree...

246
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,458
But try to understand.
I have a lot of mortgages.

247
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,875
Right now it’s not possible for me.

248
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,291
And then there is my son.
His medicines and doctor’s fees...

249
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,958
-Mine is not a double income family.
-Why are you saying the same thing?

250
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I know that.
But you are living in a prime location.

251
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,958
It's for free.
Do you know my establishment cost?

252
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,666
When this house is promoted
you’ll get a share.

253
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,500
Why are you saying this now?

254
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,541
What has the present got to do with it?

255
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
-Some more meat?
-No more, thanks.

256
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,708
-Sidhu, have some more.
-I don't have red meat.

257
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,083
-Doctor's orders.
-Strict orders.

258
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,833
The meat needed to be sauteed more.

259
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,208
Reema and Bultu didn't come?
Pass me the sauce.

260
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,416
-They have an interview tomorrow.
-For what?

261
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,875
For Tuklu’s school admission.
These days parents are more tensed.

262
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,208
You’re right.

263
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,791
And Paula has gone to Shantiniketan.
To arrange some exhibition.

264
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,083
-Sukumar uncle, take some more meat.
-Oh no…

265
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,541
-One more prawn please.
-Sure.

266
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,291
(indistinct chatter)

267
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,375
Excuse me...
-What happened?

268
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,625
Are you feeling unwell?

269
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
I'm fine.

270
00:20:53,916 --> 00:21:02,333
You needn't worry and fight
over our medical expenses.

271
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,208
I can manage on my own.

272
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,875
What was that?

273
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,666
What happens to him sometimes?

274
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:17,208
-On a day like this…
-He's getting crankier by the day.

275
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,208
Let me go and check on him.

276
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,583
God knows what's with him.

277
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,541
I haven’t married.

278
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,416
I live alone.

279
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,291
No one to look after me.

280
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,166
But you're lucky.

281
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,416
You have children.

282
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,416
They've come to celebrate your birthday.

283
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,333
Suddenly you behaved like that...

284
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:58,041
I know people whose children live abroad.

285
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,541
Maybe visit them once a year.

286
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,833
A lot of them are in old age homes.

287
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,416
I don’t need any sympathy!

288
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:12,416
I don’t expect anything from my children.

289
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:20,333
I don’t believe one's children
are old-age insurance.

290
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,791
Okay, you don't.

291
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,208
Just think at your age...

292
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,750
At least one son stays with you.
Is that not an advantage?

293
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,541
-The advantage is more his.
-Come on.

294
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:39,875
Considering Param's income...
I don’t think he can ever leave my house.

295
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,791
All you do is complain.

296
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,041
It’s not a complaint.

297
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,333
Harsh reality.

298
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:53,666
I refuse to bury my head in sand
like an ostrich.

299
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:59,916
Okay, don’t.
I’d better leave.

300
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,708
Birthday!

301
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,375
This concept is quite strange!

302
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,333
What's the celebration for?

303
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,833
Am I Gandhi or Netaji?

304
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,583
Why?
You're Swami Vivekananda!

305
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,000
-You are incorrigible…
-See you.

306
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,708
Grandpa?

307
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,083
Welcome, captain Nemo.

308
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,250
I've drawn a card for you.

309
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,583
Let me see.

310
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,666
Wow!

311
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,541
It's brilliant.
Very good.

312
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:54,250
But how did you know I share my birthday
with Swami Vivekananda?

313
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,416
Grandma told me.

314
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,791
I also know what your
school friends called you.

315
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,833
Really? What did they call me?

316
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,000
Biley.

317
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,583
Grandpa, what's the meaning of schmuck?

318
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,666
Where did you hear that word?

319
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,000
Dad used it.

320
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,666
-To whom?
-He was telling mom.

321
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,125
He was calling your mom that?

322
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:27,083
He told mum Uncle was a real schmuck!

323
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:33,500
Okay, go to bed.

324
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,916
Ten rupees, right?

325
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,833
(song playing)

326
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:40,791
-Dulal, give me a tooth paste.
-Yes.

327
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:47,208
This cacophony to worship
the Goddess of music!

328
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,583
Really, sir.
Ear-rattling!

329
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:54,250
-Doesn’t anyone protest?
-Who'd dare?

330
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,875
(song playing)

331
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,000
Excuse me.

332
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:06,208
-I’ve lived here for fifty years.
-We know you, Uncle.

333
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:10,833
-What's the problem?
-You are the problem.

334
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:16,458
My wife has bedridden
for a year.

335
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:20,791
Who allowed you to play songs this loud?

336
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,416
Bachcha did, our councilor.

337
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:28,500
-Why don't you call and request him?
-Why should I call anyone? Who's he?

338
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,833
If I need to, I'll call the police.

339
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:35,666
-He just threatened us with the police!
-Who cares? Let's carry on.

340
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,875
(song playing)

341
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,625
-I am a cool dude.
-What is that?

342
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,083
I’ve had eleven "kools" or plums.

343
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,166
Great fun, right?

344
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,875
Saraswati festival, no studies…

345
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:01,250
How can I study?
I’ve offered all my books to the Goddess.

346
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:06,208
Even we followed this rule devoutly.
-Go from here.

347
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,541
Why did you call the police ?

348
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,666
You could have told me.
I would’ve spoken to the councilor.

349
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,833
Don’t advise me.

350
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:19,375
I have done what is right.

351
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,041
-Speaking to you is a problem.
-Then don’t.

352
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:30,458
There is a patient at home
and those cheap songs are blasting away.

353
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,708
You have come to show off your clout?

354
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,833
Leave that grovelling for your office.

355
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,458
One has to endure a lot to survive.

356
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,583
You’ve built up an idealistic image.

357
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,458
...and living off that.
Those never benefited us.

358
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,916
Rather harmed us.

359
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,916
Then don’t introduce me as your dad.

360
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:54,291
I'm okay with that.

361
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,708
-It is impossible to talk to you.
-You're mistaken.

362
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,875
You're not lacking in words,
you lack a spine.

363
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,500
-Arko.
-Yeah.

364
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,916
Please, it's high time you did something.

365
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,833
How long will you be hopping
from one newspaper to the other?

366
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,125
Not for long, babe.

367
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,750
See, I’m done with print.

368
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,250
I’m shifting to electronic media.

369
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,708
I’m off.

370
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,875
-Checking out Delhi.
-Wow !

371
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,166
That means we’re going to see
your mug on TV every day?

372
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,166
You’ll be famous, dude.

373
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,041
Well Neha,
I’m actually quite telegenic.

374
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,250
Yeah, yeah.
So?

375
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:31,791
What about the future?

376
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,583
I just told you, Neha.

377
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,125
-Arko.
-Neha.

378
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,625
Our future.

379
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,500
What about me?
I mean...

380
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,125
-Is there any plan at all?
-Yeah, there is.

381
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:46,416
Arko, I’ll be here.
You’ll be in Delhi.

382
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,958
Yeah, so you shift as well.
You also come to Delhi.

383
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,041
Come on, Neha!
What’s the point of staying here?

384
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,041
-Calcutta is dying.
-Boss, you know my scene.

385
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:00,208
In a typical Gujarati family the only way
you get to shift is when you get married.

386
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,708
At least my dad is not fussy about me
going around with a Bengali but this is...

387
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,083
So let’s get married.

388
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,250
When?

389
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,625
It’ll happen when it happens, darling.

390
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:16,833
Arko, in a business family
a marriage is a deal.

391
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,666
-Deal?
-Yes.

392
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:23,291
The balance sheet you know, right?
It has to tally.

393
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,291
It’s about who’s worth what.

394
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,708
-So I am worthless.
-To my dad? Yes.

395
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,916
I mean…

396
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,375
A struggling young
journalist trying to make it big

397
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:36,291
is not the ideal profile
for my prospective groom.

398
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:43,291
Listen, first you get a stable job
at a reputed media house, okay?

399
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,416
Then you come and negotiate.

400
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,291
I’ll get the cheque.
Excuse me.

401
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,666
No I’ll get the cheque.

402
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,291
I'm not that worthless, you know?

403
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:58,000
-Another joint?
-What else can I do?

404
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,041
I was brought up in a joint family.

405
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:08,541
Sagnik, that's not even a PJ.
It was pathetic.

406
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,708
When are you going to get serious?

407
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,291
Why?
I am quite serious.

408
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:24,625
I paint, roll my joints
and also love you seriously.

409
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,291
You call this love?

410
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,500
Paula, how would one
translate it in English ?

411
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,125
Crudely translated it comes to making love.

412
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:40,333
Very convenient for you.
No strings attached.

413
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,875
-How long will this go on?
-Until I become rich and famous.

414
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,833
Then we're done for.

415
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,333
Someday, I’ll earn twice as much
as your husband.

416
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:02,625
My paintings will be worth millions.
I'll hold exhibitions...

417
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:06,625
Paris, London, New York…
World tours.

418
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,916
It’ll all come together.

419
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,416
Yes, tell me.

420
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,458
I thought you had OT today.

421
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,625
Want some?

422
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:31,000
I've come to buy a gift
for my maternal uncle.

423
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:36,125
We missed his birthday
so Mom was very angry.

424
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,541
So I'm getting a gift.

425
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,208
Yeah.

426
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,833
I am almost done.
I’ll pick you up.

427
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,000
"To the Editor.

428
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:53,916
I'd like to draw your attention
to the recent article by Swarup Sanyal.

429
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,375
He's defended the government's refusal
to give DA to their employees

430
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:05,750
...and concluded that the last government
covertly favoured the middle class.

431
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,041
This one supports the poor.

432
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,958
I'm tempted to use some trite subalter..."

433
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,916
-Subaltern.
-Yes, that’s it.

434
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:24,041
"...subaltern examples of
freedom of expression but I refrain.

435
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,208
You're an intellectual
and the head of Pay Commission.

436
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,416
You are an expert on Economics.

437
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:39,625
And your degrees are genuine."

438
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,833
There's the writer.

439
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:47,625
Oh my, can't read anymore ...

440
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
-He’ll start cribbing.
-He hates propaganda.

441
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,083
Tell me about it.
He is something!

442
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,333
He could've gone places
if he wanted to.

443
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,541
-Some serious discussion?
-Just discussing discussions.

444
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:05,208
Pranabesh Chattopadhyay has been
nominated the 13th president of India.

445
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,958
His election had an air of certainty
in the political world.

446
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,708
From the CM to the PM,
everyone has congratulated him.

447
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,583
The people of Bengal are overjoyed
to have their first Bengali President.

448
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,500
Let us hear what they have to say.

449
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,125
Why so happy?

450
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,166
Have you seen the news?

451
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,916
Read the morning papers?

452
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:35,083
That's all the TV channels
have been showing.

453
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,125
Oh!

454
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:43,791
Mr. Cactus, you don't need water.

455
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,750
That's your reaction?

456
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:50,750
Why?
Not equal and opposite?

457
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,708
You are...

458
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,041
-...something else.
-Why?

459
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,250
-Am I supposed to dance in joy?
-I didn’t say that.

460
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,500
You have a contribution to this.
Doesn't that excite you?

461
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,166
What contribution?
It hardly matters.

462
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,250
Look Borun, you’ve attained salvation.

463
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,833
But I'm a plebeian.

464
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,875
Just a common man.

465
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,958
I can't remain indifferent.

466
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:28,083
Our school friend...
India’s next president.

467
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,708
How can I not be excited?
Can you imagine?

468
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,875
It was always on the cards.

469
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:40,500
Now the formal announcement has been made.
What's with the fuss?

470
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,666
You call this fuss?

471
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,208
Are you going to have some tea?

472
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,208
-Of course!
-Get one more cup of tea.

473
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,791
I knew Pranabesh Chattopadhyay
went to school with you.

474
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,000
Not just that.

475
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,000
He was Borun's satellite.

476
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,625
-Stop that.
-Shut up.

477
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:02,208
In fact, Borun introduced Punu
to politics.

478
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,250
Oh!

479
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,083
It’s best not to talk about that.

480
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:12,083
Explaining Hegel, Marx, Engels,
Immanuel Kant to him used to exhaust me.

481
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,208
Nothing worked.

482
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,541
I’m delighted.

483
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,083
Here take this.

484
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,791
-Don’t give him any.
-I’ll be right back.

485
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:33,000
Now go around gloating.
Dad’s friend is the President.

486
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,083
What rubbish?

487
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,041
-He must be secretly pleased.
-Forget it.

488
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:42,666
They were classmates, that’s all.

489
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,208
-Sukumar Uncle was saying that...
-That's another one...

490
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,708
A complete bullsh**ter!

491
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,625
He loses the plot, making up stories.

492
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,041
Couldn't play for the best football clubs
since he worked in the railways.

493
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,375
Was apparently left out of the Asian Games
due to politics!

494
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,916
Load of rubbish!

495
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:02,083
-Don't insult without knowing the truth.
-Hah! Miss Know All!

496
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,500
You know more about my father than me!

497
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:08,791
He is quite a difficult bloke.

498
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,291
Picking fights with everyone.

499
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,041
Some letter he wrote...

500
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:19,583
-I'm getting f**ked in office!
-This is your dad you're talking about...

501
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:23,416
My uncle was the party block president.

502
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,583
But he never took any favours.

503
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,041
Over a difference of opinion,
he stopped going.

504
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,250
Everyone in the party
respected him so much.

505
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,208
Respect and ideals...

506
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,208
Give me that.
...put all that in the bank!

507
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,791
Then gradually use them as required.

508
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,000
If only he had kept in touch
with Pranabesh Chatterjee.

509
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,500
But no.
They differed politically.

510
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,541
Hello !

511
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,375
Borun Babu?

512
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,500
Yes, speaking.

513
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,041
All good sir?

514
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,791
Yes, fine.

515
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:05,375
I'm not sure who you are.

516
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,458
Tarun from the publishers.

517
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,125
Oh, yes.

518
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,291
I am well, and you?

519
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,833
Me too, sir.

520
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,916
Your cheque is ready.

521
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,250
What cheque?

522
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,583
Your royalty, sir.

523
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,083
Oh dear!

524
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:25,625
People still read essays, do they?

525
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:31,458
Of course, sir!
Do you remember Sushil?

526
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,000
Sushil?

527
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,833
Sushil Sarkar the poet.

528
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,666
An intellectual who appears
on TV regularly.

529
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:44,041
His allegiance swings
with whoever is in power.

530
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:49,291
That's true for many...

531
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,500
Anyway, what of him?

532
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,000
Nothing, sir.

533
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,250
He took your number from me.
Wants to get in touch.

534
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,791
With me?

535
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,083
Strange!

536
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
-Is Borun Babu there?
-Yes.

537
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,583
-He's always home.
- I got caught up in a rally.

538
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,166
I was there too.

539
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,208
-Tea? Dad's in here.
-Yes.

540
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,916
See everyone is
entitled to his political views...

541
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,000
whatever may be the compulsion.

542
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:29,125
You have yours
but I'm not bound to follow them.

543
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,541
You are misunderstanding me, sir.

544
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,666
You are an asset to society.

545
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:43,208
I read your piece in the newspaper.

546
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,916
Your analysis was remarkable!

547
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:54,125
Your writing prowess is truly admirable.

548
00:37:54,875 --> 00:38:03,083
If we could get you on our side,
we would be enriched.

549
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,791
Our work would also be
properly evaluated.

550
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:14,875
I am here under instructions
from the upper echelons.

551
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,791
Have you read that poem by Shankha Ghosh?

552
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:26,125
Someone is searching for something in vain
in a dark room.

553
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,666
-Later we find out that the person...
-Has lost his spine.

554
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,958
Exactly!

555
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,458
Borun Babu...

556
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,791
What I have to say is simple.

557
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,875
The government has nominated you
for an award.

558
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,875
The money is good and tax free.

559
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:54,416
You and your wife's treatment
must be expensive.

560
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,583
-If the government takes charge...
-Sushil.

561
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,833
I’ve been listening to you
and getting irked.

562
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,041
But now you are crossing your limit.

563
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:13,375
If you don’t want an unpleasant situation,
please leave my house this instant.

564
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:18,500
And don't ever come
with such proposals again.

565
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:22,750
You can do whatever you want, Dad.

566
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:27,000
But don't embarrass us.

567
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,916
Your actions may also embarrass me.

568
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,625
You don’t work anymore so...

569
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,958
But I have to survive.
I'm not as valiant...

570
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,750
I am not valiant.
But not a coward either.

571
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,000
Think of circling the world and
taking Mom away, far away.

572
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,416
What are you talking about?

573
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:51,458
-You're the one who called Grandpa valiant.
-You fool!

574
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,166
It's all my fault.

575
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,750
I didn’t bring up my sons properly.

576
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,125
You were always busy.

577
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,541
Don’t talk and stress yourself.

578
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,625
As it is I'm a burden!

579
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,250
On top of it...
this unpleasantness.

580
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,166
I'm bedridden...

581
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,583
But I can still see.

582
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,625
I am the root of all problems.

583
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,500
What rubbish!

584
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,750
I'm ailing...

585
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,291
The cost of my treatment
is weighing you down.

586
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,083
-Others are insulting you.
-Listen to me.

587
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:44,583
I could keep my head high all my life
because you stood by me.

588
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:49,291
Why are you stressing about such things?

589
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,750
You'll fall sick.

590
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,541
Don’t worry.

591
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,708
It's okay.
See what you can do.

592
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:12,333
-You can come here straight.
-She was such a kind soul...

593
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,750
Okay, see you.

594
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:16,625
We'll have to move now.

595
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:18,791
Control her a bit.

596
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,375
Dad, we have to go now.

597
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,291
Yes.

598
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,041
You don't have to come along.

599
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:35,833
We were together for so many years.
Let me stay with her a bit longer.

600
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,083
Who'll come in the hearse?

601
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,916
-I will.
-What?

602
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,708
-You come with me in my car.
-It's okay.

603
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,500
-The doctor’s certificate...
-I have it all with me.

604
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,083
(indistinct chatter)

605
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:08,916
Grandpa...

606
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,833
I’ve drawn a picture of Grandma.

607
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,875
I’ll frame it for you.

608
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,041
Grandpa...
Why did Grandma die?

609
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:32,208
It was time for her to go.

610
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:38,958
No.

611
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,666
They don’t stay in this world anymore.
That’s all.

612
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:50,208
You don’t know.
Good people go to heaven.

613
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,125
And the bad people...

614
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,416
-Who told you this?
-Swapna Auntie.

615
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,333
And she was saying that
Grandma will go to heaven.

616
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,166
Is heaven a star?

617
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,125
Nemo, don’t bother Grandpa.
Come here.

618
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:15,000
Grandpa, won’t you feel lonely?
Should I stay?

619
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:31,791
Transcending the boundaries of life and death

620
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:42,583
Oh friend of mine, you stand beside me

621
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:51,291
Transcending the boundaries of life and death

622
00:43:51,791 --> 00:44:00,083
Upon the deserted horizon of my love

623
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:08,750
Your place in my heart is blazing alight

624
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:17,208
Upon the deserted horizon of my love

625
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:26,041
Your place in my heart is blazing alight

626
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,875
Immersed deep in hope of eternal bliss

627
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:45,541
I raise my arms in awe and gaze at you

628
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:54,291
Transcending the boundaries of life and death

629
00:44:55,916 --> 00:45:04,750
The silent night under your feet

630
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:13,791
Darkness, she sprawls like your unfettered hair

631
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:23,166
The silent night under your feet

632
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:31,958
Darkness, she sprawls like your unfettered hair

633
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:49,000
Amazing is your song that cascades
Through your lute down to the earth

634
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:57,625
Its harmony brings the world together as one.
I lose myself within the melancholy of your song

635
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:59,083
Excuse me.

636
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,333
-Brother?
-It's okay, you stay here.

637
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,750
I love this song.

638
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,666
Which film is it from?

639
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,958
-Wasn’t Rakhee the actress?
-No...

640
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,916
-Then who? Subho...
-Right!

641
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:16,458
Transcending the boundaries of life and death

642
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,583
Dad.

643
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:26,458
Oh friend of mine, you stand beside me

644
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:34,458
Transcending the boundaries of life and death

645
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,125
(indistinct chatter)

646
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,708
Now Rai will speak about her grandma.

647
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,416
Sit.

648
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,125
Good afternoon...

649
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:59,250
It's difficult to talk about Grandma.
Whenever Calcutta is mentioned...

650
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,750
She can't speak Bengali fluently.

651
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:03,541
That's what I get reminded of.
My grandma.

652
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,541
She doesn't live here.

653
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,958
When I was small... Like very little...

654
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,916
I remember Grandma used to
offer me these little pieces of betel leaf.

655
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,625
I still keep thinking about that.

656
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,000
A mish-mash of Bengali and English...

657
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:29,708
Thank God Dad was in the other room.

658
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:34,000
She has really grown up.
And she looked so pretty.

659
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,708
You were also looking pretty.

660
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:43,375
There was an assistant director
in our neighbourhood.

661
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,583
He offered me a role in a movie.

662
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:49,083
Really?
Why didn’t you do it?

663
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:55,250
I'm terrible at remembering dialogues.
Messed up in a neighbourhood play.

664
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:59,833
Actually he was just hitting on me.

665
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:04,125
I don't blame him.

666
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,208
What are you doing?

667
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,500
Are you doing the crossword?

668
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:23,791
"Graave-yard."

669
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,041
What does "graaveyard" mean?

670
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:30,916
Not graaveyard, graveyard.

671
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:39,750
People of some religions
bury their dead here.

672
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,750
To bury means...

673
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:44,000
Put that down.

674
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,958
A burial means they are laid down
under the ground and...

675
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:52,625
...over time they become part of the soil.

676
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,416
No.

677
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,875
Why didn’t they keep Grandma there?

678
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:18,083
Actually, Hindus follow different rituals.

679
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,333
I was born into a
Hindu family alright.

680
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:32,250
But now I'm nothing.

681
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,625
And me?

682
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:40,000
You'll decide when you grow up.

683
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:45,250
Are there ghosts in the graveyard?

684
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,166
Let's go there and check.

685
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:53,583
Who stays under the ground there?

686
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:59,875
The Christians, the Muslims...

687
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:06,958
Derozio, Michael...

688
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:35,750
Nothing much.
Could be cataract.

689
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,875
I have to get it checked.

690
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:42,750
Dr. Chakraborty has passed away, right?

691
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:46,166
Yes, about a year back.

692
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:50,458
You could speak to Abhijit...
Paula’s husband.

693
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,500
How are you?

694
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,333
He's in the bathroom.

695
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,625
I often think of visiting you...
Abhijit's so busy.

696
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,833
Hold on...

697
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,333
Its Uncle.

698
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:27,291
Uncle...
I am so embarrassed.

699
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:30,666
Couldn't come for
the memorial service...

700
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,250
I had an emergency case.
Very sorry.

701
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:38,458
It's okay.
Your profession keeps you busy.

702
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:47,083
My eyes are giving me trouble.

703
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:59,583
Just a little problem in reading...

704
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:05,750
I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist.
But his chamber is quite far.

705
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:11,541
You can go to Subir Dutta Eye Foundation.

706
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:14,083
But what is his grudge against you?

707
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:20,000
My promotion has been on the line
for two years.

708
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:22,416
Same with the Mumbai transfer.

709
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:27,375
I can’t do anything about it.
He’s too close to the management.

710
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:34,000
Let me find some connections.

711
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,333
Please do!

712
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,166
I used to know someone.
Gaurav Mathur.

713
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:42,375
But he has given up his job
and gone off on a spiritual trip.

714
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,458
How is Raka?

715
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,916
Commuting to Serampore is taking its toll.

716
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,541
Oh fish!

717
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,166
Daily to Serampore?

718
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,208
My goodness!

719
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,000
I am the one forcing her
to keep the job.

720
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:04,583
Otherwise she'll eat my head.
She'll be here soon.

721
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:07,458
-Shall I repeat the drinks?
-Go ahead.

722
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:11,625
-Isn’t Rai coming back today?
-No.

723
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:15,833
-She has a sleepover at her friend's.
-That means drinking and all.

724
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:19,083
I don’t think so.
Her parents are there.

725
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:23,125
Let her be.
She’s going out after so long...

726
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,208
Having fun...

727
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:29,083
After her visa got rejected
she was so depressed.

728
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,375
It seemed like the world
had come to an end.

729
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,208
When is she applying again?

730
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,625
Don't know yet.

731
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,916
These are actually nothing.

732
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:48,291
If you have the right contacts,
it's just a cake walk.

733
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:53,666
What's up with your delegation to Davos?

734
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,500
The final list is not out yet.

735
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:09,166
If I could make it, it would've
been a major boost for me.

736
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,458
Right.

737
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:15,333
See, if you could get hold of someone...

738
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,083
I will also go with you.

739
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,000
There is one more, sir.

740
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,041
Yes, what were you saying?

741
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:36,375
But you know,
I’m just taking some time to decide.

742
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:38,958
You are from a good cultured family.

743
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:49,500
-This freelance means you work for free.
-Freelance doesn’t mean free...

744
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,208
-You need a steady income.
-Yes, sir.

745
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,958
There is nothing here, apart from trading.

746
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,833
Look son, I am not that conservative.

747
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:10,500
I have accepted that you are friends.
But if you want to take it beyond that...

748
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:14,000
Then you’ll have to settle.
I mean properly settled.

749
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:18,041
You know Neha is
used to a certain lifestyle.

750
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:18,833
Yes, sir.

751
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,916
You can’t make that out now but...

752
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,500
Have tea.

753
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,083
Pinaki is a good lad.

754
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:37,541
He is very active in
our alumni association

755
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:43,458
Oh.
What can I do for you?

756
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:47,541
Our school's 150th anniversary
falls next month.

757
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:51,833
You must've heard
that our President will be there.

758
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,500
Everything has been possible
thanks to Sukumar sir.

759
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:58,375
I've done nothing.

760
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
One phone call, that’s it.

761
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,791
He heard my name and took the call.
Punu hasn’t forgotten me.

762
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:10,416
We want you to attend
the function as well.

763
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:16,250
They want you to facilitate Punu.

764
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,375
Facilitate?

765
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,291
It’s all the same.
They want you to do that.

766
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,250
I’ve heard he's an old friend of yours.

767
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:30,875
As far as I know his induction
to politics was through you.

768
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:41,458
Our school alumni association
has held a lot of functions earlier.

769
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:47,458
You’ve never invited me
or even informed me.

770
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:54,041
Now I'm not keeping well...

771
00:56:55,125 --> 00:57:03,083
I haven't recovered
since my wife's demise...

772
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:08,708
You’ll have to excuse me.

773
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:23,375
If I’m not mistaken,
I last met him in '98.

774
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:32,041
Since then, neither of us has had
a problem in our lives.

775
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:39,833
Even if we don’t meet in the future,
it won’t make any difference.

776
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,500
I won’t force you further.

777
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,458
I’ll take your leave today.

778
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,916
Can I sit here awhile?

779
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,833
You're really obstinate.

780
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,666
Let it be.

781
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,333
I thought it would be nice if you
felicitated him personally.

782
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,333
But you don’t want that.

783
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:31,083
That I understand.

784
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:41,041
Don't dwell on the past.

785
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:46,958
Besides you can’t be certain
Punu didn't try to help...

786
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,916
Always obdurate!

787
00:58:56,416 --> 00:59:01,916
As a child takes repose
On his mother's Elysian lap

788
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,083
Even so, here in the Long Home..."

789
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,500
Hey?

790
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,000
Nemo.

791
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,083
Nemo?

792
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,000
Come this way.

793
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,083
Fatty, run fast.
Quickly.

794
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,000
Hey, wait for me.
Wait!

795
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,333
Why aren’t you waiting for me?

796
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,541
Punu!

797
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,000
You?

798
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,500
(indistinct)

799
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,916
-What’s this?
-Come on.

800
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,333
Hey!
Punu, look where they are taking me.

801
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,500
Punu!

802
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:29,541
Punu...see...what they’re doing...

803
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:51,375
I told you, my father's stubborn.

804
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,666
Dad must’ve a reason for not going.

805
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,333
Plain jealousy.

806
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,416
Dad never achieved anything...

807
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,541
His pictures would be in the
papers if he had gone...

808
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:14,750
My image in office would get a boost.

809
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:17,708
Say that.

810
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,125
You're bitter because
you couldn't cash in on this.

811
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,416
Don’t talk rubbish.

812
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:26,083
-You could've flaunted it as well.
-Take your water bottle...

813
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,166
-Always talking rubbish.
-Come, come.

814
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:32,875
All his life he’s been an idealist.
That's the problem.

815
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,583
He couldn’t achieve anything.
Now he’s frustrated.

816
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:40,375
His school didn’t felicitate him,
so he didn’t go.

817
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,750
After all, he is the president
of the country.

818
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,791
Can dad compare with him?

819
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,041
Who’ll explain that to him?

820
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,333
During the Emergency in the seventies...

821
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,375
there was an incident.

822
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,666
Pranabesh Uncle's role in it...
Or rather, the lack of it...

823
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,625
Dad could not forget.

824
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,708
What did I tell you?

825
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,541
I see.

826
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,625
-So, the function was today?
-Yes.

827
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,166
Hence, this royal attire!

828
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,375
Let’s just say...

829
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,666
Borun Babu’s friend.

830
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,416
-The president?
-Yes.

831
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,375
-Where? To our house?
-What else?

832
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,083
Punu has sent you a letter as well.

833
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,291
-Is he really coming?
-Yes.

834
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,833
I can’t believe it!

835
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:58,791
My reading glasses are giving me trouble.

836
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,041
Oh my God.

837
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,083
"Dear Biley.

838
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:18,583
I thought I’d see you today.

839
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:19,916
But it did not happen.

840
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:25,916
Sukumar gave me the news about Lolita.
I felt very sad.

841
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:29,750
My heartfelt condolences.

842
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:35,791
-Your health, I hear, is not eating well."
-Keeping well.

843
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:42,125
"I have to come to Kolkata often.

844
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,666
Since you won’t come...

845
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,125
I hope you won’t mind.

846
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,041
Yours,
Punu."

847
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,583
Oh dear, what terrible handwriting!

848
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,500
He would’ve made a good doctor.

849
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,250
-Mom.
-Yes.

850
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,458
Are you sure?

851
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,833
Moushumi has seen the letter.

852
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,250
Ask her to read it out.

853
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:21,708
-Don't be stupid!
-Why?

854
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,125
-The letter must not be with her.
-That's true.

855
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:28,958
-It'll be incredible if it's true.
-Wait.

856
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:32,458
Don’t get so excited.
Let him visit first.

857
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,000
Let’s keep our fingers crossed.

858
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,750
-Rai, come here.
-Yes.

859
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,208
Big people often make big promises.

860
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:46,583
Don’t go around telling people
until he really does visit.

861
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:50,375
-Specially your notary club members.
-Why should I?

862
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,125
Simple, to show off.

863
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:55,500
Grandpa must be a
really important person, right?

864
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,750
Otherwise, why would the
President write a letter to him?

865
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,625
Rai, it's not a matter of importance.

866
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,541
When people become
big and successful

867
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,750
sometimes they revisit their past.

868
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,791
Why?

869
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,833
-It gives them some kind of pleasure.
-What pleasure?

870
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:14,375
That we went to school together...

871
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:18,000
See where you are and where I am today.

872
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,458
It was a short letter.

873
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:28,875
Why should a personal letter
be on a letter head?

874
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,000
I can’t quite remember...

875
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,666
Yes...

876
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,583
That bulls**tter Sukumar
could have written it.

877
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,625
-What!
-That Sukumar. He’s a big liar.

878
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:41,750
Unlikely...

879
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:43,500
-Sugar?
-No.

880
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:48,375
You should take up writing.
You’ll make a name for yourself.

881
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:52,750
Brother, why don't you ask Dad?

882
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,583
I might as well see him now.

883
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:56,416
Ok.

884
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,750
I’ll be right back.

885
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,416
Here sir, what's up?

886
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:06,125
He never visits us.
A whiff of an opportunity and he's here.

887
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:12,041
-Are you having difficulty with your eyes?
-Probably cataract...

888
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,583
Let’s show an eye specialist.

889
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:19,833
-Let me find out.
-No. I’ve spoken to Abhijit.

890
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,458
I'll go to his recommended doctor.

891
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:25,208
Will Abhijit have the time?

892
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,291
He's involved in some case.

893
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,000
What case?

894
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:33,291
One of his patients died.
The nursing home got smashed up.

895
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,750
The patient’s family lodged a case.

896
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,916
Civil court, consumer forum,
medical council...

897
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:47,958
Doctors and teachers
were once considered noble professions.

898
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:55,458
Now they're highly commercialised.

899
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:56,500
That’s it.

900
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:04,583
How come you are suddenly here?
Didn't you have office?

901
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:06,250
Yes, I did.

902
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:09,916
I had some work this side.
Thought I'd see you.

903
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:13,083
After Mom passed away,
I've hardly visited.

904
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:17,541
-Don’t bother.
-Right.

905
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:22,708
I wanted to know something.

906
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:30,208
If you want to confirm
whether the President is coming or not...

907
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,250
I can't assure you.

908
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,916
He has sent a letter.

909
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:41,250
The handwriting seems to be his.

910
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,708
It’s in the drawer.
I can show you.

911
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,666
No, it's okay.

912
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:03,000
Your medicines must cost you a lot.

913
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,208
That's true.

914
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:09,000
A good part of my pension goes towards it.

915
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:14,166
Plus doctor’s fee...tests...

916
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:17,166
Any progress with your
medical health scheme?

917
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:18,666
No.

918
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:22,583
I forgot to submit some documents.

919
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,875
I never got around to it.

920
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:31,708
Param contacted some MP but...

921
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:37,250
-I can’t go with folded hands to anyone.
-You're stubborn about everything.

922
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:40,000
Why can't you just meet the MP once?

923
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:43,750
Forget it.
Don't need medical benefits at my age.

924
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:45,666
Okay, you don’t have to do anything.

925
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:48,791
-I’ll speak to Punu about this.
-Absolutely not.

926
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:54,833
You don’t have to do anything.
I don’t want any favours from him.

927
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:00,833
The older he becomes
the more obstinate he gets.

928
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:06,833
I told you not to tell people.

929
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:09,125
You concentrate on this.

930
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:13,583
They're busy people,
can't take their word for it.

931
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,958
I didn't tell anyone.

932
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,500
Just your brother and sister
like you asked.

933
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:21,750
And my mother.
No one else.

934
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,375
Thank God!

935
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,458
Just my bad luck.

936
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:32,125
Nothing good matures.
Everything fizzles out.

937
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:33,958
Write this properly.

938
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,625
What's up?

939
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,750
Your brother-in-law had already warned.

940
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:42,541
VIPs say a lot of things...
Then they forget.

941
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,500
The way Moushumi put it,
I was excited when I told my husband.

942
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:51,958
What a loss of face.

943
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,791
Thank God I never told anybody else.
It would be even more embarrassing.

944
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,916
No, Dad is at fault as well.

945
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:03,458
The President is showing an interest...
Dad should've followed it up.

946
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:05,416
I'm sure he didn't.

947
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:07,291
Yes.

948
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,875
Yes listen...

949
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:12,000
I am hanging up.
We are going out.

950
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,708
Okay, call me later.

951
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,708
Listen...

952
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:26,750
-President is spelt with 'S', not 'C'.
-Okay.

953
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:36,708
Grandpa, who is a president?

954
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:42,000
President is our country’s number one man.

955
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:44,291
Where does he stay?

956
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:48,375
In a huge mansion in Delhi!

957
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:49,916
What does he do?

958
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:51,958
Oh dear!

959
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:56,291
-This is a difficult question.
-He doesn’t do anything?

960
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:59,416
Then why isn’t he coming to see you?

961
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,916
He will come.

962
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
Let's see...

963
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:08,625
Dad said he isn't coming
because you didn't go to "felicate" him.

964
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:10,458
What does "felicate" mean?

965
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,750
Felicitate.

966
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,583
Here you go.

967
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,875
I can’t wait any longer.

968
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,625
Don’t behave like this, Borun.

969
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,708
I'm sure he'll keep his word.

970
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,750
I’ve been hearing that for long.

971
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,500
Maybe he's at work.

972
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:33,875
-I could also have some work.
-What work do you have now?

973
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:38,208
You normally don’t go out at this time.
Why today?

974
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,916
That's him!

975
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,833
Yes, he's here, hold on.

976
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:44,958
Here.

977
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,000
Always in a hurry!

978
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:48,625
Hello.

979
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,625
I’m fine.
How are you?

980
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:58,458
What's the need for all this?
You've such a busy schedule.

981
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:09,250
Even at this age your memory is sharp.

982
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,500
Of course!

983
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:18,125
I hope there are no restrictions
on your diet.

984
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:25,625
At one time you could
eat more than any of us!

985
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:34,375
The President is going to
Kolkata to inaugurate a museum.

986
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:35,541
So?

987
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:41,333
He will deliver a memorial lecture
on 12th January, Vivekananda's birthday.

988
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:43,500
You want to go to listen to it?

989
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:49,000
He remembers Uncle's birthday
is on 12th January.

990
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,333
Oh, great!

991
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:58,541
Pranabesh Chatterjee is coming to
our house to meet Brother that day!

992
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,916
-I'm so happy!
-Are you serious?

993
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,625
-You?
-How are you?

994
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:19,416
-You've come after so long.
-I just don’t get the time.

995
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,541
-Is your dad back?
-Yes.

996
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,875
You know Dad.
Don’t go over the top.

997
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:29,166
Besides, Mom passed away
less than a year ago.

998
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,458
Yes, technically we're still in mourning.

999
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:34,541
Dad has no issues with that.
Problem lies elsewhere...

1000
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,375
With Dad, everything is an issue.

1001
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,333
This birthday we can do
something different.

1002
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:42,625
We've never celebrated his birthday...
If we do now, won't it be odd?

1003
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,916
What's odd about it?

1004
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:47,541
If the President comes,
there has to be something special.

1005
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,875
-I don’t think that should be an issue.
-Yes exactly.

1006
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,416
I am thinking of coming
a couple of days early.

1007
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:54,791
Arun will come on the 12th itself.

1008
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,708
Don’t call too many people.
It'll be chaotic.

1009
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,833
(singing)

1010
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,125
Taking selfies?

1011
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,750
You are already the selfie queen.

1012
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:10,291
(singing)

1013
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,791
There we go, Nidhiram Sardar.

1014
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,250
I have the shield.
The sword is there too.

1015
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,500
My goodness!

1016
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,333
Expensive whiskey at your brother's
must've gone to your head.

1017
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,583
-No, no.
-You must've drunk a lot.

1018
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,291
He is a bloody miser.

1019
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:33,541
He’s hidden all the single malts.

1020
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,833
However, we’ve come up with a good plan.

1021
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,875
Here, why do you listen
in on our conversation?

1022
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,125
Go to Grandpa’s room.

1023
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,666
You're interested in whiskey,
I in your conversation.

1024
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:51,500
The birthday will be a big affair.
Very selective people will be invited.

1025
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:55,541
-I'll call Dad, Mom and Tumpa for sure.
-Okay.

1026
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:59,125
Wonder how the big shots
in office will react!

1027
01:15:00,416 --> 01:15:01,958
They can’t put me down again.

1028
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,458
This is my chance.

1029
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,208
My Dad’s friend is the President...

1030
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:08,500
It’s not a trifling matter.

1031
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:12,458
Dad, Sam was just telling me that...

1032
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:17,166
if the President recommends my case
getting my visa will not be a problem.

1033
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:19,333
Rubbish, no recommendation is required.

1034
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:21,541
-One phone call will be enough.
-Exactly.

1035
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:25,041
You could also talk to him
about your delegation..

1036
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:29,291
After Kolkata he'll come here
for the IITF summit.

1037
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,916
He's the chief guest.

1038
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,541
I just have to address him
as Uncle there.

1039
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:38,791
Then I’ll see who can exclude me!

1040
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:47,041
Can’t we request him to be
an honorary member in our Notary Club?

1041
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:51,083
Are you mad?
The President a member of your Notary Club!

1042
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,458
Don’t do anything of the sort.

1043
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:56,666
Let my trip come through...
you'll go up in status.

1044
01:15:57,041 --> 01:16:01,458
-Who can block your promotion now?
-Softly.

1045
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,083
Even walls have ears.

1046
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,916
I don’t want much.

1047
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:09,250
Just arrange a transfer
to Kolkata, that'll do.

1048
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,583
Everyone is on their own trip, see?

1049
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:15,625
He is the Indian President.
For him that is nothing.

1050
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:16,833
Think big!

1051
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:20,708
Ask for a big boon.
The genie only appears once.

1052
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:27,458
This is like really exciting, man.
My dad could not believe it.

1053
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,458
He was my Grandpa’s nappy buddy.

1054
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,458
You belong to such
a prestigious family, Arka.

1055
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,916
I mean, the Indian President
is such a close friend of your Grandpa's.

1056
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,458
Incidentally...

1057
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:42,500
You are talking about the Indian President.
Do you even know his name?

1058
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:43,791
-Uh oh!
-Come on.

1059
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:45,958
Why shouldn’t I know?
-Who is it?

1060
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:51,166
You know...
That Muslim chap!

1061
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,541
You know.
What’s his name?

1062
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,333
Go on, say it.

1063
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:58,000
-Some Alam or something.
-Oh my God.

1064
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,250
You mean Kalam.
-Yeah, right!

1065
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,625
That’s history, baby.

1066
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,833
Why is Sister coming now?

1067
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:14,708
Souvik's cousin is getting married.
That's why.

1068
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:18,791
Did you know they were coming?
Or was it planned suddenly?

1069
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,875
It wasn’t certain
whether Souvik would get leave...

1070
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,875
So it was a bit of last minute planning.

1071
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,250
They would never have come
at this time.

1072
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,291
The President's coming,
so they’re turning up.

1073
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:35,500
The things you say!

1074
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,500
Her tongue's hanging out at
the thought of meeting the president.

1075
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,375
She will definitely tell him this...

1076
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,208
When you visit the States you must come
to dinner at my house.

1077
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,416
You really talk rubbish.

1078
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,333
I'm not sure about
Souvik's agenda, though.

1079
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,708
Don’t you have any agenda?

1080
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,291
What agenda can I have, Mom?

1081
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:06,791
Just that court case of Abhijit's...

1082
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:10,375
If something could be arranged...

1083
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,375
He so does not deserve it, Mom.

1084
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:19,083
-Who’s that?
-A colleague.

1085
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,250
Yes, tell me.

1086
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:28,750
I had something to tell you, Paula.
But I don’t know how to put it.

1087
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:31,166
Why are you beating around the bush?

1088
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,958
Without blabbering, come to the point.

1089
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,500
I kind of need a favour from you.

1090
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,166
That’s obvious.
What is it?

1091
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:40,625
It’s about my
painting academy scholarship.

1092
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,833
You know it’s a central government scheme.
There is a lot of politics involved there.

1093
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:48,416
Without a recommendation it’s difficult.

1094
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:54,916
My fiscal state is currently very bad.
If I don’t get the scholarship this time...

1095
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:56,750
I don’t know.

1096
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,416
If you talk to your uncle’s friend...

1097
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:01,833
You don’t know my Uncle.

1098
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,375
I'll tell him
but I can’t promise.

1099
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,875
Tuklu, stop being so naughty.

1100
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:13,083
Be a good boy and eat up.

1101
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,000
Come here.
Where are you going?

1102
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:21,000
-Tuklu.
-I’ve caught you.

1103
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:26,666
-Bring me my lunch.
-I’ll bring it right away.

1104
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,250
Mom, your son was saying...

1105
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:33,333
...why don't we ask Uncle to arrange
for Tuklu's admission to a big school?

1106
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,541
The other day I got
him to memorise the five times table.

1107
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,666
At the interview, he couldn’t say a thing.

1108
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,250
He just sat there.

1109
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:44,000
He coloured all the flowers brown.

1110
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:52,208
Actually Reema, my brother has never
asked anyone for a favour.

1111
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,083
I won't be able to ask Brother.

1112
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:00,208
No one bothered to
remember his birthday before.

1113
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,708
Have this and see how it is.

1114
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,458
I have put coriander leaves in it.

1115
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,458
Grandpa...

1116
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,500
I was thinking of asking you something.

1117
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,833
What? Salary?

1118
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,583
No, madam increased that
after the festive season.

1119
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,541
Oh, then...

1120
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,291
You want leave?
-No sir, it’s not that.

1121
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,833
The president is coming to your house.

1122
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,250
Please ask him to arrange for
an auto rickshaw for my husband.

1123
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:33,625
What?

1124
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,166
-Auto?
-Yes.

1125
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:41,250
He's applied for a license,
but the party in power is not allocating...

1126
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,541
Swapna...

1127
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:46,750
The president has umpteen responsibilities.

1128
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:52,625
-He can’t get your husband an auto license.
-If you ask him, he will do it.

1129
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:53,958
He is your friend.

1130
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,166
Please look into it.

1131
01:20:59,041 --> 01:20:59,750
Hello.

1132
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,041
Grandpa, this is Arka.

1133
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:02,500
Arka?

1134
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,583
Your grandson Arka.

1135
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,666
Oh, yes.
What is it?

1136
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:11,833
Will you be home tomorrow evening?

1137
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:14,083
Yes...
Why?

1138
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:20,291
I want to meet you around eight-ish?

1139
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,083
Why come to me ?

1140
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:27,375
I’ll tell you when I meet you.
See you at eight tomorrow.

1141
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:31,875
Your sister Bokul Aunty
from Bardhaman has come.

1142
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,375
-Bokul?
-Yes.

1143
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:38,958
-Suddenly? Why?
-I don’t know.

1144
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,250
Her grandson is with her.
They are in the drawing room.

1145
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,625
Please come.

1146
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:45,791
-Oh, Daughter-in-Law.
-Swapna, make three cups of tea.

1147
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:50,291
Ask your maid
to take this gourd.

1148
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:53,041
-God bless you, dear.
-What was the need for all this?

1149
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,375
-Where is my grandson?
-He has gone to school.

1150
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:57,250
Okay...

1151
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:59,833
-Did you go to the mart before you came?
-No...

1152
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:03,125
I grew it in my garden
so I got one for you.

1153
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:05,708
I’ve brought four coconut sweets as well.

1154
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,541
I know you like them.

1155
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:14,125
Do you remember, Brother?

1156
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:19,500
After your graduation,
three of you had come to Bardhaman.

1157
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,625
Pranabesh used to tell such funny stories.

1158
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:25,583
Sukumar would climb trees.
And you...

1159
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:30,500
-You sat all day by the pond fishing.
-Yes, I remember all that...

1160
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:35,125
But did you have some work in Kolkata?

1161
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:39,083
No, I’ve been planning to come
since I heard.

1162
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:43,041
After my husband passed away,
his evil brothers are trying...

1163
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,875
...to evict me from my home and property.

1164
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:48,458
They have started court proceedings.

1165
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,541
I can’t read or write.
I don’t understand all that.

1166
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:55,416
They have got the local club on their side.

1167
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,166
Wait...

1168
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,625
Why are you telling me all this?

1169
01:22:59,666 --> 01:23:00,833
What do you mean?

1170
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:05,250
Get your friend to arrange something.
He'd stayed in our house...

1171
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:06,833
And he can’t do this little bit?

1172
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:12,458
This is my grandson, he's on the wait list
of the entrance examination.

1173
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:17,291
Why don't you ask the President...
Nowadays there's some other quota...

1174
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,541
-Tell him...
-Minority quota.

1175
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:24,250
All this quota rubbish fill up
half the seats.

1176
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,708
How will he get in?

1177
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:31,583
Why don't you get him
into a good engineering college?

1178
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:37,333
Bokul, it'll not be possible for me
to ask for all this.

1179
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:42,291
-I have never asked anyone for such...
-What kind of talk is that?

1180
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,458
In times of need, one seeks help
from near and dear ones...

1181
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:50,750
Arka said that the Indian President
is not only our bosom friend...

1182
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:54,000
-He also takes your advice...
-Not at all.

1183
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:59,083
We haven't been in touch
for quite sometime.

1184
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,208
Oh!
Well, sir...

1185
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:06,166
Your grandson is a very close friend
of my daughter.

1186
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,083
And it’s highly likely they are going to...
you know.

1187
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:11,083
That is very good news.

1188
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:19,708
Inter-community and inter-religious
marriages are very healthy.

1189
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,375
I am very liberal.

1190
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,541
My son also married someone
from a different caste.

1191
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:29,000
But sir, I have one request.

1192
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:34,083
That day I’ll come and seek
the President’s blessings.

1193
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,958
It’s not often you get to meet
a person like that.

1194
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,041
That day is your birthday as well.

1195
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,000
I would like to come and wish you.

1196
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:51,083
Is it only out of courtesy or...

1197
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,500
What?

1198
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,666
Is it only about blessings and wishing?

1199
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,208
(TV playing)

1200
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:08,666
Grandpa.
I’ve drawn a picture of your friend.

1201
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:13,958
How did you know my friend?

1202
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,625
Oh!

1203
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,125
This does look a lot like him.

1204
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,750
When he comes, give it to him as a gift.

1205
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:41,291
What?
What celebration?

1206
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:45,375
A lot of people will come.
They’ll bring you presents...

1207
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,541
Sorry, they’ll bring gifts.

1208
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,916
I don’t like this at all.

1209
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:04,875
Hordes of people will come
with their own personal agendas.

1210
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:08,541
Tell Punu to come another day.

1211
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:12,875
But he has already spoken to you.

1212
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:17,291
I can’t stand all this fuss.

1213
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:21,916
Don’t worry, I am there...
I’ll manage everything.

1214
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:25,833
I won't allow anyone near him.

1215
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:35,333
There was some trouble
at the college hostel you said...

1216
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:37,833
The students are fasting in protest...

1217
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,708
News channels are not covering it...

1218
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,791
Neither the newspapers.

1219
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:48,958
A distant relative, my grandson
is a leader there.

1220
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:53,791
He asked for your number.
I gave it to him.

1221
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,291
He'll call.
Please answer.

1222
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,833
-Okay.
-I’m off.

1223
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:00,833
Sir, sir!
One minute, sir.

1224
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:04,375
Just a minute.

1225
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:05,708
What’s happened?

1226
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:13,750
- Last year she won at the state level.
-Yes, sir.

1227
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,708
We are a hard up family...
These competitions are expensive.

1228
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:22,916
Come and see me sometime.
Let me see what I can do.

1229
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:27,416
If she gets selected for the Asian Games,
she has a chance of winning.

1230
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,375
It’s not because she’s my daughter...

1231
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,458
To get her trained by a foreign coach
they will even take her abroad.

1232
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:35,125
-That is very good news.
-It's expensive...

1233
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,958
The government is giving her a meagre sum.

1234
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:42,166
-How much money?
-Sir, it’s not about money.

1235
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:45,541
I was wondering if you could just tell
the President once.

1236
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:49,416
If he just tells them
the government may fund it all.

1237
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,958
Greetings, Borun Babu.

1238
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:55,833
-The letter we sent to the councilor...
-For what?

1239
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:59,208
To increase the size of our water ferrule.

1240
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:07,083
Increasing water pressure is not under
the President’s jurisdiction.

1241
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:12,000
Where did the President come into this?

1242
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:25,208
I have no objection in going.

1243
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,083
Though me going there
won't help much.

1244
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:36,708
I would like to stand by you...

1245
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:40,416
After all, this is my Alma Mater.

1246
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:46,666
We are living in
such a country and in such a society...

1247
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:50,250
Where at every point we are being attacked...

1248
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:57,875
Yet...

1249
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:03,958
I am amazed at how insular
we have become.

1250
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:10,500
We are tolerating everything.
We’ve learnt to endure it all.

1251
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:19,166
At a time like this, when youth like you
stand to offer resistance...

1252
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:23,166
Unlike us, you haven’t rotted
and worn away.

1253
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:28,000
You fight for your rights
and justified demands.

1254
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:36,708
Then... It feels like
a breath of fresh air.

1255
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:43,208
I have come here
for that breath of fresh air!

1256
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:50,291
I am not an orator.
I don’t even have much to say.

1257
01:29:50,625 --> 01:30:03,583
I had read a poem by a German priest,
written during the Nazi regime...

1258
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:07,041
I had read the Bengali translation...

1259
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:19,166
"First they came for the communists.

1260
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,333
I did not protest.

1261
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,708
Then...

1262
01:30:53,916 --> 01:31:01,791
Then there was no one left
To protest on my behalf."

1263
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,750
Dad.

1264
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:06,583
Bachcha has come to talk to you.

1265
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:07,958
Who is Bachcha?

1266
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:10,500
Don’t you recognise me, Uncle?

1267
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:13,500
Your civil servant.
This area’s councilor.

1268
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:15,125
Back to back, two terms.

1269
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:20,250
Shibnath Saha from house number 26.

1270
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:21,583
Oh, Shibu.

1271
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:27,166
-Astrologer, palmist...
-Yes.

1272
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:31,625
Suddenly why’ve you decided to serve me?

1273
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:38,958
To take care of that is our duty, right?

1274
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:50,291
Actually, work pressure
restricts my visits.

1275
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:52,041
That is my fault.

1276
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:56,458
A highly respected person like you
living in my constituency...

1277
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,958
It’s a matter of pride.

1278
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:04,416
I’ve told your son already.

1279
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,208
I’ll be there.
My boys will be there.

1280
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:11,625
Law and order, we shall manage it all.

1281
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:16,291
When the President goes somewhere his
own security takes care...

1282
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,333
...of his safety and also
law and order of that place.

1283
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,500
I don’t think there’ll be any need for you.

1284
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:25,166
Yes. Yes.

1285
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:32,000
-I’ll take my leave then.
-Okay.

1286
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:39,208
When auntie was unwell my boys had played
the music a bit too loudly.

1287
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:40,666
I am sorry for that.

1288
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:45,416
From now instead of
calling the police call me.

1289
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:47,125
I’ll sort everything out.

1290
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,208
I’m off.

1291
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:54,375
I told you he’s turned cynical.

1292
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:58,875
-And he has completely lost it.
-No, he is perfectly sound.

1293
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:02,125
The lecture he delivered at the college...
It was definitely sound.

1294
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,541
I’ll send it to you.

1295
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:05,916
It’s lucky that the
President is his friend.

1296
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,250
Otherwise, he would
be under great pressure.

1297
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:13,125
You know your grandpa is a righteous man.
I don’t think he’ll allow all that.

1298
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:14,875
Don’t be unreasonable, Dad.

1299
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:18,166
Neha’s dad got me in touch
with this national news channel.

1300
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:21,125
And guess what? They want me
to do an exclusive live for them.

1301
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:24,041
It’s going to be a big break for me.

1302
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:25,208
Break?

1303
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,416
If Grandpa finds out,
he’ll break your legs.

1304
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:29,583
Dad, I’ve given my word to him.

1305
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:35,333
Besides, we’ll have a small DSLR set-up.
People will think we’re taking stills.

1306
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,916
President, live on TV.
Some protocol has to be followed, isn’t it?

1307
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:41,500
How will you do it?
You will need to take permission.

1308
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:45,458
The president is a childhood
friend coming to the house.

1309
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,208
It’s a very human angle, Siddhartha.

1310
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,791
Besides, the family could
also make a personal video.

1311
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:53,375
Come through here.

1312
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:56,875
Left.

1313
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:01,541
Here through the Verandah.

1314
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,875
No, Tommy!

1315
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:05,541
-Oh dear! Don’t bring him this way.
-Why are you shouting?

1316
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,916
(indistinct chatter)

1317
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:14,583
Here, this is dad’s room.

1318
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,750
-Dad.
-I am in the bathroom.

1319
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:18,125
Dad’s in the bathroom I think.

1320
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:25,916
Oh my god! He is coming again!
Where did this thing come from?

1321
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,541


1322
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:36,416
Where did he come from?

1323
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:38,416
Come, Tommy.

1324
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:44,166
-Which one should I wear tomorrow?
-I like all of these.

1325
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,375
-I think this is the best.
-This?

1326
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:49,708
Where's Rai?

1327
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,041
In Arka’s room.

1328
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,375
They are listening to music.

1329
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:56,666
-What will you wear tomorrow?
-I am not sure.

1330
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:59,250
I’ve brought a Jamdani
and a Kanjeevaram saree.

1331
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,833
I can’t find a blouse
for the Kanjeevaram.

1332
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,791
I have blouses.
Take a look.

1333
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:04,458
Your blouse on me.
It won’t fit.

1334
01:35:04,458 --> 01:35:08,875
-See how fat I've become?
-Sree! Don’t fish for compliments.

1335
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:13,458
I shudder to think
what Moushumi will wear.

1336
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,708
She is an absolute wardrobe disaster.

1337
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:19,083
Couple of days back I
called up about the menu.

1338
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,833
All through the discussion she
mispronounced "caterer."

1339
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,625
Hilarious!

1340
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:28,833
The harmonium has come
down from the cupboard top...

1341
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,708
I hope you’re singing tomorrow.

1342
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:34,375
-We will sing. You and me together.
-Me? Have you gone crazy?

1343
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,125
Do you know how long
I haven’t sung?

1344
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,916
-As if I am performing daily.
-Even then!

1345
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:43,291
What should I sing?
'Come, come into my house'?

1346
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,041
Tagore's song?

1347
01:35:45,083 --> 01:35:47,500
He likes Rajanikanta better.

1348
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:50,833
You’re going to sing a Rajanikanta song
to the President?

1349
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:55,583
Your visit this year was
really perfectly timed...

1350
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,000
Coinciding matched
with the President's visit.

1351
01:35:58,041 --> 01:36:01,375
How exciting!
How prestigious!

1352
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:04,916
It will cause a stir
in our Bengali community.

1353
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,833
I am just keeping quiet.
I’m not telling anyone anything.

1354
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:11,916
Just take a selfie and post it.
That’s it.

1355
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:17,250
You know what happened?
Abir Chatterjee, the actor!

1356
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:21,208
He was in Houston.
He’d gone to my friend’s place for dinner.

1357
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:23,708
That friend’s conceit!
You won’t believe it.

1358
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:25,708
-Really?
-Yes, seriously.

1359
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:29,000
I've also decided,
when the President comes to Houston...

1360
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:31,416
...then he has to come
home for dinner as well.

1361
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:34,166
I'm sure he'll go.

1362
01:36:34,208 --> 01:36:36,458
I’ve heard he’s very fond
of Bengali food.

1363
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:40,375
-Where will he find Bengali cooking abroad?
-Exactly! Isn’t that so?

1364
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:44,375
Souvik said even if the president
doesn't come for dinner...

1365
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,791
His contacts can be used
to get the green card.

1366
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:50,208
That will be enough.

1367
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:59,041
I will becoming the secretary
for sure.

1368
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:01,875
Oh, just give me a minute, sorry.

1369
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:06,833
Hi, honey, what’s up?

1370
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,625
Ah, you're going downtown this evening?
That’s great.

1371
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,250
But just remember…

1372
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:17,625
No, no. Just pretzels and cereals
from Seven Eleven.

1373
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,833
No burgers.

1374
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,916
Oh! Peter's coming as well.

1375
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:31,041
No, that is not allowed.

1376
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:34,583
King can only move one space.

1377
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:38,375
Queen can go in any direction,
as many spaces as she wants.

1378
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:44,583
There's a king and a queen.
Aren’t there prince and princess?

1379
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:46,125
No.

1380
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:51,291
Grandpa, you'd told me
you’d take me to Princess Ghat...

1381
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,833
...where you and your friends used to go.

1382
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:57,125
It’s not "princess" but Princep Ghat.

1383
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,708
When will you take me there?

1384
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,416
Let me see...
Let tomorrow's ordeal get over.

1385
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,750
The day after.

1386
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:09,958
Yes, day after it may well be.
It’s a Sunday.

1387
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,250
Ask your mom to get you ready early.

1388
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,208
Grandpa, your friend is coming
on your birthday.

1389
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:19,875
Aren’t you happy?

1390
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,416
I am not sure.

1391
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:25,541
When you are, let me know.

1392
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:27,583
Certainly.

1393
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:34,541
-Dad, Dad…
-Yes? What?

1394
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,375
Dad, get up slightly.
Take a look.

1395
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:37,916
-Here he is... Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

1396
01:38:37,958 --> 01:38:38,958
What's all this?

1397
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,333
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Happy birthday, Grandpa.

1398
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:43,500
-Stay blessed.
-Our best wishes.

1399
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:45,916
Oh dear, in the middle of the night?

1400
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:50,208
I saw you reading a book,
so I asked them to make a video call.

1401
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:54,000
Since you're awake,
we thought of wishing you together...

1402
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:55,916
-...at exactly midnight.
-The first to wish you.

1403
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:59,916
Well, I accept your best wishes.

1404
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:02,875
And I express my gratitude.

1405
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:04,750
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

1406
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:08,791
Tomorrow, no sorry today...
This evening we’ll see you again. See you !

1407
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:10,875
-Yes, you go to sleep.
-Bye, bye.

1408
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:12,541
-Go to sleep.
-Bye. Good night.

1409
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:28,458
He has come…
Your friend is here.

1410
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:33,041
It is not 'he has come'...
it is 'I have come today'.

1411
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:35,833
-Not 'your friend' but 'your bride'.
-It's all the same.

1412
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:40,083
So you’ve decked up and come so early.

1413
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,333
What else could I do?

1414
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:44,333
Have to check whether the
decorators are doing their job on time...

1415
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:46,041
I won’t get time to change.

1416
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:50,125
-Why did you have to dress up like a joker?
-I’ve dressed up like a joker?

1417
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,583
Exactly.

1418
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:58,291
The coloured 'dhoti' looks clownish.
'Dhoti' should be white.

1419
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:00,833
You are completely backdated.

1420
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:03,500
You have no idea
about current fashion trends.

1421
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:07,500
On such a joyous day
how can I not dress up?

1422
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,125
How can you stay so detached?

1423
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:12,875
-Sheer practice.
-Practice what?

1424
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,708
To stay disinterested.

1425
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:18,500
You are here?

1426
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:20,083
Come quickly, my friends.

1427
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:24,125
-They have come!
-Who has come?

1428
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:26,416
Fifty chairs.

1429
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,916
-And I am ready.
-Okay.

1430
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:33,083
Go get dressed.
Huh! Detached !

1431
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:29,416
Keep the President and
my grandfather in focus...

1432
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:32,583
Grandpa, my friend Ken.

1433
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:33,541
Oh yes..

1434
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:36,416
This is my grandfather's friend, Sukumar.

1435
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,333
-Yes, hello.
-My goodness!

1436
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,125
This is...

1437
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:41,666
Keep following them…

1438
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:48,833
Sit over here...
you're the centre of attraction today.

1439
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:51,833
-Sit.
-You really go over the top.

1440
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,500
Here they are...
Come on in.

1441
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:04,500
-Happy birthday.
-What was the need for all this?

1442
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:08,666
-Happy birthday.
-Give it to me.

1443
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,041
Here come the rest.

1444
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,500
Happy birthday, Dad.

1445
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:17,791
-Dad’s looking great.
-God bless.

1446
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:20,833
Give him this.
He'll love it.

1447
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:23,750
Another shawl!

1448
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:26,166
Okay.

1449
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:30,041
Shawls may come, shawls may go...

1450
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:32,416
It’s not that shawl...

1451
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:37,291
That's short for 'shalti', a dinghy boat.

1452
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:41,666
This is a pure Kashmiri shawl, Dad.
Your son bought it for you.

1453
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:44,541
What will I do with a shawl?

1454
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:47,750
I hardly get an opportunity
to wear all this.

1455
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,458
-So what? Wear them at occasions.
-Exactly.

1456
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:54,708
Dad.
Here they are. Here.

1457
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:58,083
Many happy returns of the day, Uncle.

1458
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,250
Thank you.

1459
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:04,208
How are you?
Keeping well?

1460
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,833
(indistinct chatter)

1461
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:11,000
Hi... Hi...
Here comes my sister-in-law.

1462
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,791
We can open a flower shop now.

1463
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:16,541
Dad! Let me seek your blessings.

1464
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,000
-How are you?
-Fine.

1465
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,625
Happy birthday, Dad.

1466
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:24,166
-Pay your respects.
-Happy birthday, Grandpa.

1467
01:43:24,166 --> 01:43:26,166
That’s his daughter from Delhi...

1468
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,166
Granddaughter has really grown up.

1469
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:33,166
Happy birthday.

1470
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:38,375
I think of coming here often
but I can't manage with all the work.

1471
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:41,916
I tell your daughter though,
even if I can’t she should come.

1472
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
But this time around it’s different.

1473
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:46,708
It’s a special day!
After all it’s your 80th birthday.

1474
01:43:47,416 --> 01:43:51,083
You have messed up your homework.

1475
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,166
I was 80 last year.

1476
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:58,125
-My mistake, sorry!
-Never mind.

1477
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,958
-See you in a bit, Dad.
-Come.

1478
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:04,000
(indistinct chatter)

1479
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:08,083
Happy Birthday.

1480
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:16,583
-I haven’t seen you in a long time.
-Yes. I hardly go out nowadays.

1481
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:17,916
Brother...

1482
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:23,375
People have become anti social.

1483
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:28,583
We forget man is a social animal.

1484
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:32,000
Here's your NRI niece
and her husband.

1485
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:33,666
(indistinct chatter)

1486
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:41,291
Greetings, greetings.

1487
01:44:41,291 --> 01:44:43,750
-Who's this?
-Haven't seen him before.

1488
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:45,958
-Oh, the councilor.
-Give me the flowers.

1489
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,333
He's come because of the President.

1490
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,083
Happy birthday, Uncle.

1491
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,958
There’s no need for all this.

1492
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,708
-His gift.
-Pass it.

1493
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,583
Here’s a small gift from our side.

1494
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:03,291
What’s this?

1495
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:08,166
Just a few books of verse
and music CDs.

1496
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:10,666
-By who?
-Silly question!

1497
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:19,291
Move away...

1498
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,333
Media is not allowed.

1499
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:36,291
Take it easy.
Hold up.

1500
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:38,041
Go in, I’ll manage.

1501
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:41,083
Step back please.

1502
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:43,291
TV channels step forward.

1503
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:45,250
I'll say whatever has to be said.

1504
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:50,708
-Moushumi, let’s go check the food.
-Come, let’s.

1505
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:55,333
(indistinct chatter)

1506
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:03,083
I’ll request our cameraman to pan
and show you...

1507
01:46:03,166 --> 01:46:04,250
This is the house...

1508
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:12,166
...where the President is coming to meet
his childhood friend, Borun Chakraborty.

1509
01:46:12,208 --> 01:46:16,791
This has created a stir in the locality.

1510
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:20,041
A huge crowd has gathered.
Let us get some reactions.

1511
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:25,041
-Let me tell you a joke about drinking...
-Cheers!

1512
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:28,375
You're drinking whiskey?

1513
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:30,541
-He’s far too cheeky.
-Have you seen his glasses?

1514
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:32,208
Go get some fish fingers.

1515
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,375
Is it a pillow?

1516
01:46:36,708 --> 01:46:38,875
No, just drink up.

1517
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:41,625
Give him to me.

1518
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:43,875
I don’t mind a drink.

1519
01:46:43,916 --> 01:46:45,541
Don’t pour anymore,
it's almost time.

1520
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,083
Let’s go downstairs.

1521
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:52,458
Sing something else
before the main song.

1522
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:58,333
Something else?
What about 'Those were the days'?

1523
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:01,791
-It’s a cliché.
-I know but it works.

1524
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:04,166
-Always appropriate.
-Okay, sing that.

1525
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:06,208
-Hello.
-Here they come.

1526
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:08,375
-We are here.
-Ah, it’s so humid.

1527
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:11,125
You all know this song.
Everyone must join in.

1528
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:12,208
Okay.

1529
01:47:16,416 --> 01:47:24,791
Those were the days my friend
How can I forget?

1530
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:31,833
The passing glances, our tete-a-tetes
Those are unforgettable moments

1531
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:33,333
What happened, sing?

1532
01:47:33,416 --> 01:47:41,583
Those were the days my friend
How can I forget?

1533
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:49,000
The passing glances, our tete-a-tetes
Those are unforgettable moments

1534
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:57,708
Come once more, my friend,
Into my heart again

1535
01:47:57,791 --> 01:48:06,333
We'll chat about life’s ups and downs
And set our world to right

1536
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:09,083
-I can’t do anymore...
-Why don't you dance, Rai?

1537
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:15,750
We used to take up
eating challenges in our youth.

1538
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:16,875
Yes.

1539
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:19,333
Challenges to eat more sweets.

1540
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:23,083
-Now Kiki Challenge is the trend.
-What's that?

1541
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:24,541
Momo challenge.

1542
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,833
She is going to jump out
of the car and dance!

1543
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:34,583
Just imagine!

1544
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:38,083
-Change is everywhere.
-Yes.

1545
01:48:38,083 --> 01:48:44,333
Change is the only constant.
If you can’t accept it you're in trouble.

1546
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,458
Isn't it time for him to come?

1547
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:50,250
We’ll be right back.

1548
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:56,250
Biley don’t talk to Punu about all that.

1549
01:48:56,291 --> 01:48:58,291
No point digging up the past.

1550
01:48:58,416 --> 01:49:00,500
Are you mad or what?

1551
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:07,041
Rubbish.
They are all dry essays.

1552
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,916
Besides, giving your own
work doesn’t look nice.

1553
01:49:10,958 --> 01:49:12,500
You're too complicated...

1554
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:16,125
He’s probably arrived.

1555
01:49:29,666 --> 01:49:32,166
He’s here, hold on.

1556
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:34,250
Punu.

1557
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:38,416
Yes...

1558
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,000
Oh, I see.

1559
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:53,541
This can always happen.
Why should I mind?

1560
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:57,458
I understand.

1561
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,875
We’ll catch up later.

1562
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:25,875
The excitement surrounding
the President's visit to this locality....

1563
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:33,958
evaporated as we got news that he will not
be coming due to an emergency meeting.

1564
01:50:34,208 --> 01:50:36,916
There is a sense of despondency
amongst all.

1565
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:42,000
What an anti-climax!

1566
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:44,833
We have to hang our heads in shame.

1567
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:57,583
Media isn’t reporting it in much detail
but he’s stuck in an important meeting.

1568
01:50:57,666 --> 01:51:00,666
Whatever be the reason.
The expectations of so many!

1569
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:03,333
So much preparation,
all for nougat.

1570
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,833
It’s a bit embarrassing.

1571
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:13,375
He should’ve called him once.
He and his ego...

1572
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:18,583
No, actually Dad was arrested
during the Emergency period.

1573
01:51:18,625 --> 01:51:20,000
We know all that.

1574
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:25,250
He was a minister then...

1575
01:51:29,708 --> 01:51:31,708
-It's only supposition.
-Exactly!

1576
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:32,958
It could be though?

1577
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:37,708
What does self-respect mean?

1578
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,458
Everybody is very disappointed.

1579
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:51,916
how you all can be so insensitive.

1580
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:57,625
A riot is brewing...
Lives may be lost.

1581
01:51:58,291 --> 01:52:02,958
You expect the President to visit
his friend under such circumstances?

1582
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:06,083
Of course everyone is disappointed.

1583
01:52:23,666 --> 01:52:26,958
You’ve lived in reflected glory
all your life.

1584
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:35,583
Suku.

1585
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:46,500
That’s alright.

1586
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,375
The President did not come.

1587
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:02,833
No.

1588
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:07,958
What work?

1589
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:19,916
That's why he didn’t come.

1590
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:29,250
Go now,
don’t bother me.

1591
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,250
And doesn’t matter to me
who says what.

1592
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:37,625
Listen...

1593
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:41,625
Come here.

1594
01:53:54,333 --> 01:53:55,708
Are you angry?

1595
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:07,083
Tell your mom to get you ready
by ten tomorrow.

1596
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:10,875
Tomorrow Princess…
Sorry Princep Ghat?

1597
01:55:07,916 --> 01:55:09,000
Yes?

1598
01:55:11,083 --> 01:55:12,250
Yes.

1599
01:55:14,083 --> 01:55:15,416
What did you say?

1600
01:55:19,041 --> 01:55:20,708
Yes, I’ll tell him right now.

1601
01:55:21,125 --> 01:55:24,208
The way Borun babu was humiliated last night...

1602
01:55:27,125 --> 01:55:29,875
-So his lackey is also absent.
-Exactly.

1603
01:55:29,875 --> 01:55:31,791
-Shyamal uncle.
-Who’s that?

1604
01:55:32,416 --> 01:55:34,041
Oh it’s you.
What’s the matter?

1605
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:35,375
Isn’t Dad with you?

1606
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:38,291
No, what's the matter?

1607
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:42,416
Just something urgent.
He won't even use a cell phone.

1608
01:55:42,416 --> 01:55:46,208
Check near the park,
he goes there sometimes.

1609
01:55:56,375 --> 01:55:59,250
Hey, did you see that?

1610
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,041
Don't get too snooty
or we'll throw you in.

1611
01:56:06,041 --> 01:56:08,375
-No, no.
-Yes, we'll throw you in!

1612
01:56:08,416 --> 01:56:12,375
Please don't.
It's really scary.

1613
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:20,208
-Come on, this way.
-Yes.

1614
01:56:20,416 --> 01:56:21,916
Has Dad returned?

1615
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:24,250
No, I've looked everywhere.

1616
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,708
He is nowhere to be seen.

1617
01:56:27,958 --> 01:56:29,791
I just saw him near the club.

1618
01:56:50,041 --> 01:56:51,708
Pass the ball to Biley!

1619
01:56:52,791 --> 01:56:54,375
(indistinct chatter)

1620
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,958
Goal!

1621
01:57:08,708 --> 01:57:11,083
-Looks like a government vehicle.
-Yeah.

1622
01:57:11,083 --> 01:57:12,250
What’s up?

1623
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,666
Couldn't have come today.
There's no security personnel, after all.

1624
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:25,583
-Then who?
-Whose car is this?

1625
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:28,375
Someone's come to see you.
They're upstairs.

1626
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:34,625
-Nonsense!
-He's never this late.

1627
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:37,541
-Dad is supposed to take Nemo out.
-Today?

1628
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:40,000
-Grandpa is here.
-What?

1629
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:42,375
Dad, Grandpa is here.

1630
01:57:42,708 --> 01:57:45,250
-Where were you?
-Yeah, tell us.

1631
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:48,708
The boys were playing football
at the lake.

1632
01:57:48,708 --> 01:57:50,666
Watching football?

1633
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:53,500
You won’t even use a mobile.
So stubborn!

1634
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:56,000
You can’t be found when we need you.

1635
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:58,625
Why did you suddenly need me so urgently?

1636
01:58:06,958 --> 01:58:11,541
-I don’t have time today.
-Why?

1637
01:58:11,583 --> 01:58:13,875
For God’s sake, the President
has sent a car for you.

1638
01:58:13,916 --> 01:58:17,625
Okay, he sent car for me.
I’ll send him a letter.

1639
01:58:17,666 --> 01:58:19,541
-What the hell...
-Why don't you put some sense into him?

1640
01:58:19,541 --> 01:58:22,083
Borun, try to understand.

1641
01:58:25,375 --> 01:58:26,708
Dear Punu...

1642
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:31,458
Let’s leave it for today.
For many years we have not met.

1643
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:35,375
The words have piled up.
Half an hour is not enough.

1644
01:58:36,458 --> 01:58:41,166
You have lots of responsibility.
Taking time out is difficult, I understand.

1645
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,875
I hope yesterday's situation
is under control.

1646
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,250
The entire nation's responsibility
is on your shoulders.

1647
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:56,333
I am touched that you thought of
visiting me despite your busy schedule.

1648
01:58:57,208 --> 01:58:59,458
But I cannot make it today.

1649
01:59:00,125 --> 01:59:06,458
I am already committed to someone special
who I cannot afford to disappoint.

1650
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:14,125
You will be coming to Kolkata again,
we will catch up then.

1651
01:59:14,666 --> 01:59:17,208
Take care,
Biley.

1652
01:59:17,333 --> 01:59:19,500
These huge pillars...

1653
01:59:27,333 --> 01:59:31,875
James Princep was a great English scholar.

1654
01:59:34,708 --> 01:59:36,458
Wait...
I am coming.
