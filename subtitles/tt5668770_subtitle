00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,020
More than 2000 rape crimes are committed by 
boys under 18 years in India every year - NCRB.

2
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,380
And these are just registered cases.

3
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,980
Kota, Rajasthan.

4
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,530
Welcome to Tora Tora Booking. 
Ticket 50 rupees.

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,120
Spare a few coins 
in the name of God!

6
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,710
- You wanna eat? 
- Yes, I'm hungry.

7
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,760
If you happen to overeat...

8
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,500
...you'll feel you won't be hungry 
for the rest of the day.

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,720
But that's not how it is.

10
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,810
An hour or two later than usual, 
your belly starts rumbling.

11
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,630
Appetite!

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,130
Appetite is like a bottomless pit.

13
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,910
Satisfying it is also pointless.

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,770
Next time the belly aches even more, 
rumbles louder.

15
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,810
Some people's appetite is stronger 
than their hunger.

16
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,210
Take me!

17
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,510
You can give me anything to eat, 
I'm not fussy.

18
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,190
But when...

19
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,160
...it comes to girls...

20
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,300
...I have a particular choice.

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,810
I'm hard to please.

22
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,060
You're always busy, Monty.

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,800
- What were you doing yesterday? 
- I told you. I was in class.

24
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,260
So why didn't you take my call 
today then?

25
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,220
Am I crazy to keep calling you?

26
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,380
You don't understand me.

27
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,930
Think I'm stupid?

28
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,660
Find yourself some brainy girl.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
This one.

30
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,310
I have a particular taste 
for brazen girls like her.

31
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,010
I've done a PhD on them.

32
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,080
I'm off. Don't follow me.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,800
Latika!

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,540
Go to hell!

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
- Watch it, you blind fool! 
- Sorry.

36
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,980
Monty, I said I don't wanna talk 
to you.

37
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,980
Hello, madam.

38
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,950
The owner of this phone 
has had an accident.

39
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,000
Yours was the last number dialed. 
That's why I'm calling.

40
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,860
Hurt his head, did he? Tell him 
to call me if he has the guts.

41
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,700
Madam, I don't understand 
what you're saying.

42
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,510
Here I'm trying to help you...

43
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,730
If you want his phone, tell me. 
Or else I'm hanging up.

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,500
OK. Can you bring the phone to me? 
Where are you?

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,720
Madam, I'm on a road near the 
Nagar Nigam building.

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm right there. Can you see me?

47
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,130
Yes, I see you, madam.

48
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,670
You have a red bag, right?

49
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,500
I see you.

50
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,280
I'll blow the horn for you.

51
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,400
Your friend's phone.

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,730
Sh**!

53
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,330
Oh my God!

54
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,440
What's happened to him?

55
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,420
- Madam, does he have a white bike? 
- Yes, white.

56
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,230
He was speeding and a truck 
hit him from behind.

57
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,940
He has a bad head injury.

58
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,570
Where is he?

59
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,340
Madam, they said they'd take him 
to the Kota General Hospital.

60
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,450
- The Kota General Hospital? 
- Yes.

61
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,870
OK. Thank you.

62
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,250
Madam, I can drop you there 
if you want.

63
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,690
No. I'll find my own way.

64
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,020
Excuse me. If you're going that way, 
please can you drop me?

65
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,270
I won't find an auto or a bus easily 
at this time.

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,500
That's why I offered you a ride. 
Madam, get in.

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,500
This isn't the way to the hospital. 
Stop the car, please.

68
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,840
It's the right way. The other road 
is blocked with Dusshera traffic.

69
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,170
Are you going to stop the car?

70
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,720
Sh**!

Now what's in store for me today!

88
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,850
You'll get the official statement 
tomorrow.

89
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,220
The enquiry is on. 
We have some leads.

90
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,510
Jai Hind!

91
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,670
Jai Hind. What's going on, Vinay?

92
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
- Everything's under control. 
- You call this 'under control?

93
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,620
Is Mr Shekhawat here to give a press 
conference or do his job?

94
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,960
He loves the spotlight, madam. 
So...

95
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,400
One question, madam.

96
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,520
Mr Shekhawat has told you everything. 
Please go home.

97
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,840
One question, madam.

98
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,620
Do you think there's a political angle 
to this murder?

99
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,680
You cover sports, don't you?

100
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,520
- The editor's given you crime? 
- Our crime reporter's on holiday.

101
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,310
You'll get the official statement 
tomorrow.

102
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,860
Officer Rawat!

103
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,070
Vinay, tell Sagar in forensics 
to write up the report.

104
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,940
- Jai Hind! SP, ma'am. 
- Jai Hind.

105
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,740
- Is your wife's jaundice any better? 
- Yes, madam.

106
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,220
- She was discharged yesterday. 
- Very good.

107
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,810
Tell you what, cook her meals 
from now on.

108
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,800
- Yes, madam. 
- I'm not joking. Go home.

109
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,370
- Now, madam? 
- I'm suspending you.

110
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,200
- What did I do, madam? 
- Guess.

111
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,830
Did you ask the press to stay 
to catch a glimpse of me?

112
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
DySP Shekhawat summoned them, madam.

113
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,810
What's up, DySP?

114
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,440
Rearing reporters these days?

115
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,780
Careful. They'll turn around 
and bite you one day.

116
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,380
He must have dragged her 
from here to over there.

117
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes?

118
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,030
You got scared of her? 
So you pinned it on me?

119
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,290
What choice, sir?

120
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm forever caught between 
the two of you.

121
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,720
Look at the fuss she's making.

122
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,720
That's the problem with women. 
They work less, playact more.

123
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,340
And don't even get me started 
on her caste.

124
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,540
I've solved the case 
while she's wasting time.

125
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,290
- You know who did it? 
- I've even arrested the killer.

126
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,970
Once he's thrashed, 
he'll sing like a bird.

127
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,980
He's left-handed. And short.

128
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,590
Come. Let's examine the girl.

129
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,280
- He took out his rage on her. 
- Let me handle her now.

130
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,640
Madam, if you're satisfied now, 
may I say something?

131
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,530
The missing persons list 
was made recently.

132
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,940
- She looks like the girl who... 
- ...went missing on Dusshera.

133
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,800
She was last seen arguing with 
her 19-year-old boyfriend.

134
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,700
Madam, I've picked up her boyfriend 
from his hostel.

135
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,800
You'll have his confession 
in a few hours.

136
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,610
We're the police, not the media 
to pronounce a verdict without proof.

137
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,690
Her boyfriend plays cricket at a club. 
He's right-handed.

138
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,200
Did you see the rope marks 
on her feet?

139
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,190
A left hand did that.

140
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,640
Her back has deep belt marks, 
made with the left hand.

141
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
Madam, those are the marks 
I'm talking about.

142
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,280
It's a hate crime.

143
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,250
When a man's ego is hurt, 
he can go to any lengths.

144
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
And girls like her...

145
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,330
Girls like her? Meaning?

146
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,710
For these modern girls...

147
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,300
...one boyfriend isn't enough.

148
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,910
If you ask me, 
they're just asking for it.

149
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,870
You're well-trained in human behaviour! 
It wasn't part of our studies.

150
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,750
I've been in the force for 18 years. 
Some things don't need to be taught.

151
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,960
You're so right.

152
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,900
Instead of examining 
the crime scene...

153
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,420
...some people worry about morality.

154
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,180
Her nose was broken.

155
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,970
We'll know the cause of death 
after the post-mortem.

156
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,380
But I'd say she was strangled 
to death.

157
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,280
Not by his hands.

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,120
He used a belt studded with nails.

159
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,620
Instead of judging the girl's 
character, find the belt.

160
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,270
It might lead us to the murderer.

161
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,540
Doesn't look good, Shivani.

162
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,360
She's suffered a brutal sexual assault. 
The rapist is no novice.

163
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,820
We found a small amount of 
Isoflurane in her blood.

164
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,270
To make her unconscious.

165
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,270
Uneven abrasions on the back, 
neck and torso.

166
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,450
Because she was dragged 
some distance.

167
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,800
She has multiple contusions and deep 
lacerations to the neck and back.

168
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,770
I've seen them.

169
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,550
She was hit with something sharp.

170
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,800
As there wasn't much Isoflurane 
in her blood...

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,330
...she must've come around 
while he was beating her.

172
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,310
Even so, the Isoflurane 
did have an effect for a while.

173
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,360
When she regained consciousness, 
she probably had no strength left.

174
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,750
She couldn't fight or run.

175
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,570
He beat her so badly...

176
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,470
...that she'd come around 
so he could torture her some more.

177
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,320
Yes, you're right.

178
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,310
And this is the worst part.

179
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,010
Vulvar rupture, broken hymen, 
multiple bite marks...

180
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,450
...on the face, neck and torso.

181
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,480
He bit a piece of flesh off her cheek 
while raping her. Bloody monster!

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,660
Cause of death?

183
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,040
She has ligature marks on her neck.

184
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,270
Her hyoid bone was badly compressed.

185
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,950
Looks like he used his belt or 
something similar to strangle her.

186
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,850
One semen sample? Or many?

187
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,480
Just one.

188
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,800
When will I get a detailed report?

189
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,340
Tomorrow.

190
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,400
Thank you, doctor.

191
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,870
Shivani.

192
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,340
Please, just get that bas***!

193
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,660
I will.

194
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,270
Keep a watch out!

195
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,480
This is a city of students.

196
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,690
Every year students from all over 
India come to study in this small town.

197
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,300
A crime like this not only impacts 
the city, but all of India.

198
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,260
Right now thousands of parents 
are protesting outside my office.

199
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,710
We have to catch a suspect soon.

200
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,500
Yes, sir. I need my own team.

201
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,850
OK.

202
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,250
Tell Shekhawat. He'll find you 
a good team.

203
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,000
Sir, I'm leading the team, 
not Shekhawat.

204
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,670
Choose whoever you want. 
But arrest this scumbag without delay!

205
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,570
Right, sir.

206
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,950
And don't be emotional. 
Use your head.

207
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,890
Yes, sir.

208
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,660
Was there anyone stalking her 
at college?

209
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,060
Latika was outspoken.

210
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,070
And that might have attracted 
the wrong types.

211
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,160
What are you implying? 
This was waiting to happen?

212
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,580
No, no, of course not.

213
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,180
But one should be more careful.

214
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,420
My wife believed...

215
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,850
...I spoilt my daughter.

216
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,050
There were two boys who hounded us.

217
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,700
So one day Latika brought some eggs...

218
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,560
...and threw them at the boys.

219
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,110
I own a medical store in Keshavpura.

220
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,620
After class, Latika would 
come straight there...

221
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,850
...and look after the store.

222
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,100
That day she returned home 
from the store at 6pm...

223
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,560
...got changed and went out.

224
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,920
She told me, "I'm going to the Dusshera 
fair with Preeti and Monty."

225
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,990
I asked her to eat first.

226
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,910
She said...

227
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,120
"I'll eat when I'm back, Ma."

228
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,520
- Is Banwari back from the village? 
- Yes, Pandit-ji.

229
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,910
The construction will continue 
next month.

230
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,970
Tell Banwari to get his boys together.

231
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,600
- Yes, Pandit-ji. 
- Did you meet the boy?

232
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,530
When did you come from Meerut?

233
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,050
A week ago.

234
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,510
Only now you find time to see me?

235
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,240
I was busy sightseeing.

236
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,580
I hear if a politician in Meerut 
needs getting rid of, they pick you.

237
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,570
I'm giving you a break because 
of Jogi.

238
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,410
If you screw up...

239
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,560
...I'll strangle you with my own hands.

240
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,660
Got it?

241
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,490
- Kunwar! 
- Yes, Pandit-ji?

242
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,650
Here.

243
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,420
His photo.

244
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,170
Name: Kamal Parihar. 
He's a journalist.

245
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,710
His address and phone number 
are on the back.

246
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,480
Murder him but don't make it look 
like murder.

247
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,580
Birju, give him the phone.

248
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,320
Keep it.

249
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,660
This heinous crime has shocked 
the entire country.

250
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,790
He can't do it. 
Shall I talk to Birju?

251
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,110
Let us now listen in to SP Roy's 
press conference.

252
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,490
We hear the rapist is handicapped.

253
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,930
The CCTV footage shows 
a man who is limping steal a car.

254
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,040
He's wearing a mask.

255
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,680
Where did you hear such rot?

256
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,480
He's not handicapped.

257
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,300
He's trying to make us 
look like fools.

258
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,470
The footprints at the crime scene 
are clear.

259
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,070
The CCTV footage shows him limping. 
A minute later, he's fine.

260
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,160
The suspect thinks he's smart 
but he is not.

261
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,150
In Mumbai, we usually call such idiots 
"smartasses."

262
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,720
I promise you.

263
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,930
I'll drag this lowlife by the collar 
straight to court.

264
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,730
"I'll drag this lowlife by the collar 
straight to court."

265
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,470
Wow!

266
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,030
Shivani Shivaji Roy!

267
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,660
Jai Hind!

268
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,270
Did you call, madam?

269
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,060
What's this?

270
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,160
Madam, this...?

271
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,920
You gave Beniwal permission 
to hold a rally?

272
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,850
- He's a young politician... 
- Even though I said no?

273
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,600
Madam, I didn't think there'd be 
a law and order problem.

274
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,860
Do you ever weigh up 
the consequences, Shekhawat?

275
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,580
There'll be 10,000 people 
in that rally.

276
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,070
A girls college and a hospital 
are on that route.

277
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,740
What if some boys in the rally 
harass the college girls?

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,180
What if it causes a traffic jam 
near the hospital?

279
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,700
You're right.

280
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,690
But sometimes traffics jams 
are caused by lady drivers.

281
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,610
We can't ban them from driving, right?

282
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,340
There are more rapes than traffic jams 
in our country.

283
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,940
We can't ban men 
from the streets, right?

284
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,390
Ban this pointless rally and let's 
concentrate on work.

285
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,900
Right?

286
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
- May I come in, madam? 
- Yes.

287
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,490
- This came for you, ma'am. 
- Who sent it?

288
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,680
He's gone.

289
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,600
"Delighted to have met you.

290
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,530
"My collar is waiting for your touch..."

291
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,700
- Anyone see who delivered the flowers? 
- No, madam.

292
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,180
Kishorepura - Police Station, 
Rajasthan.

293
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,230
There's a saying 
an itch attracts an itch.

294
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,490
A woman who acts like a man 
and shows off...

295
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,510
...is someone with that itch.

296
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,760
You must've seen a huge 
"No entry" sign.

297
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,600
Two cops tried to stop you 
but you just rammed through.

298
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,690
Madam, I'm in a big hurry. 
Please cooperate with me.

299
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,410
It's not for personal work, 
I'm doing a public service.

300
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,410
You first break the law, then talk 
of being a patriot?

301
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,350
Sharma, why are you feeling shy? 
Give him a ticket.

302
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,240
Yes, madam.

303
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,660
Do you know which Party 
I belong to?

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,550
I'm unlikely to win a million-rupee 
cheque for guessing.

305
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,320
Pay the fine and get going!

306
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,550
Stop wasting our time.

307
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,250
Her attitude reminds me of a story 
I heard when I was a kid.

308
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,800
When I was 8, a newly-wed, Mrs Gupta, 
moved into the house facing ours.

309
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,830
Next day she came into my Dad's shop 
and caught him cheating.

310
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,670
She said, "I'll call the police."

311
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,700
Being a typical woman...

312
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,010
...she wanted her cakes 
weighed without the box.

313
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,670
The idea of the police did not scare 
my father...

314
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,140
...but he preferred to end it there, 
so he apologised to Mrs Troublemaker.

315
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,830
He told her to take an extra kilo 
of whatever she was buying.

316
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,000
She refused and started lecturing him.

317
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,380
She said: "You've been cheating 
our neighbourhood for years."

318
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,930
Hey, doll! What's up? 
Wanna ride in my car?

319
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey!

320
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,870
Wanna go for a ride?

321
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,440
Give them two hard slaps!

322
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,070
Charge them with IPC 354!

323
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,010
You louts! Harassing young girls.

324
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,890
Mrs Troublemaker then filed 
a police report.

325
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,410
My father ended up in jail 
for two nights.

326
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,750
That was not his first time.

327
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,230
But this time he was jailed 
because of a woman's itch.

328
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,690
Mrs Troublemaker had her itch.

329
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,310
But so did I.

330
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,660
She owned a dog.

331
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,840
So one night I fed rat poison 
to her dog.

332
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,780
Lakhawat enterprises.

333
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,930
The lady went nuts.

334
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,670
She cried blue murder and filed 
another report against father.

335
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,060
My father went stir crazy.

336
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,250
Hurry up!

337
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
Take it inside.

338
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,800
Careful with that!

339
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,550
Go easy.

340
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
Careful!

341
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,230
Thanks to Mrs Troublemaker's itch, 
my father got enraged.

342
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,510
So one day...

343
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,560
...he went to her house 
and taught her a proper lesson.

344
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,090
Don't ask what it was.

345
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,910
The moral of the story?

346
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,780
A heroine should stay a heroine...

347
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,060
...not try to become a hero.

348
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,310
Now I'll have to teach this madam...

349
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,460
...a proper lesson.

350
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,440
Vikram...

351
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,900
This may be the first time 
Kota's has a female SP.

352
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,730
Vikram, I'll call you back.

353
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,260
A saree, a make-up kit, two pairs 
of sandals and a bag are missing.

354
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,310
He wants to challenge me.

355
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,050
He seems mad, madam. 
Imagine challenging an SP!

356
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,660
What are you thinking?

357
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,680
I'll supervise the case from this office. 
I don't want to leave any loose ends.

358
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,070
Besides you're handling the case, 
communication will be easier. Right?

359
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,530
Pandit-ji's on the line.

360
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,550
Why are you spinning aimlessly 
in the galaxy like Pluto?

361
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,610
Spying on me? I'm on it.

362
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,970
Why chase the SP instead 
of fixing the journalist?

363
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,190
I have my ways! 
Your job will be done in a few days.

364
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm glad you called.

365
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,560
I need a car and some stuff. OK?

366
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,350
Here, brother.

367
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,370
Get me my stuff fast, 
your job will be done fast.

368
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,600
Don't stare at me. Go! 
I have work to do.

369
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,130
You're flying too high. 
I'll clip your wings someday.

370
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,700
- Really? 
- Really.

371
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,710
Hey! Take the glass away.

372
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,850
- The tea's great. You made it? 
- Yes.

373
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,880
I make great tea too.

374
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
- What's your name? 
- Pravin.

375
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,540
So, Pravin, listen...

376
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,710
...if I pay you 50,000 rupees a month, 
will you work for me?

377
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,930
Journalist - Kamal Parihar.

378
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,190
Your phone number...

379
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,440
Madam!

380
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,020
Madam.

381
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,310
What's wrong? You all right?

382
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,940
I fast on Fridays...

383
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,220
...so sometimes I feel faint.

384
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,090
Can I have a glass of water?

385
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,660
Of course. Come with me.

386
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,030
Here.

387
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,340
Sorry... sorry.

388
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,870
I won't harm you. 
Swear on my mother!

389
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,400
Aabha Parihar?

390
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,810
Talk to your husband.

391
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,330
Hello, Aabha!

392
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,510
- Beniwal's men? 
- Maybe...

393
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,220
Must we do all the talking 
on the phone?

394
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,360
Let my boy bring you here.

395
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,620
My name's Kamal Parihar.

396
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,010
I'm going to commit suicide.

397
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,800
Because of my wife.

398
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,790
She's been having 
an affair for 6 months.

399
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,230
I felt so enraged.

400
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,270
I was so disturbed...

401
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,410
...that I had my wife 
and her lover killed.

402
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,230
Now I'm ending my life.

403
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,650
That's all you had to do.

404
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,260
He made this video before 
he had them killed.

405
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,860
Apparently his wife was having 
an affair.

406
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,260
So he got his wife 
and her lover murdered...

407
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,210
...and then committed suicide.

408
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,910
- All make-believe. 
- Pardon?

409
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,980
Remember that saree stolen 
from my house?

410
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,480
- This is the same saree. 
- What?

411
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,170
We may never have linked Latika 
and Parihar's case...

412
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,830
...if that lowlife hadn't used my saree 
to hang Kamal Parihar.

413
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,200
Guys, what we're dealing with here 
is the new age criminal.

414
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,510
Being famous carries more weight 
than being rich now.

415
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,290
And our killer, Mr Lowlife, 
is an egoist.

416
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,080
If you guys remember...

417
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,310
...I called him an idiot at Latika's 
press conference.

418
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,640
Maybe that hurt him.

419
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,090
Now he's trying to show me 
how daring he is.

420
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,520
He has no fear of being caught. 
He just doesn't want an ordinary life.

421
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,730
You're right, ma'am.

422
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,930
Killing for the sake of one's ego 
is no big deal.

423
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,090
When I catch this scum 
I'll shove his ego up his a**!

424
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,260
- Madam, the tea-boy. 
- Call him in.

425
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,620
Let's take a break.

426
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,640
Then we'll examine the crime scene 
in detail.

427
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,270
I'm sure we'll find something.

428
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,850
Good idea, ma'am.

429
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,560
The forensic report will take 
a week anyway.

430
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,910
As soon as you get it, 
match it with Latika's report.

431
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,980
OK, ma'am.

432
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,130
Sagar, make sure you follow up.

433
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,670
Who's he? A new guy?

434
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,690
Bhanwar Singh's new tea-boy. 
Poor kid is mute.

435
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,540
What happened to the other kid? 
Pravin?

436
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,620
Bhanwar Singh told me Pravin 
left some days ago.

437
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,690
Hanuman?

438
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,030
Bajrang!

439
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,950
This is so dry. 
Didn't you bring any chutney?

440
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,380
- Want some tea? 
- Sure.

441
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,350
Bajrang! Serve mister your finest tea.

442
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,990
Go easy on the sugar.

443
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,120
Not too sweet.

444
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,160
Madam and her pet Vinay 
can't tolerate being apart.

445
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,970
Madam is smart. She keeps 
hanging around Vinay's office.

446
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,210
Never mind about all that...

447
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,220
...nowadays she's gallivanting 
about alone.

448
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,310
She must've found another man.

449
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,080
I can tell her type by her face.

450
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,380
That's why I didn't let her bully me.

451
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,240
She maybe an SP, but I can get her 
transferred whenever I want.

452
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,000
No doubt you can.

453
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,460
Not too sweet?

454
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,690
You have Kota in your control.

455
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,400
But how is this saree 
and Kamal Parihar's case linked?

456
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,060
Madam doesn't tell us anything.

457
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,060
How can she? It's her saree.

458
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,460
Did she forget there? Or did someone 
undrape it for her?

459
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,340
A sure case for enquiry.

460
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,540
Find out! That's your job.

461
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,310
The car was blown up.

462
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
And no one even saw it arrive?

463
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,710
- We are away all day. 
- So there's no one here?

464
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,810
Yes. Our children are here.

465
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,910
Did you see anyone?

466
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,210
Well?

467
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,380
- Does your son have asthma? 
- What?

468
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,130
Isn't that an inhaler?

469
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,770
This thing? He must have picked it up 
somewhere.

470
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,270
If you remember anything, call me.

471
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,810
Tell them if you remember anything.

472
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,000
We found a witness who saw 
the killer in the car park.

473
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,720
This is a major breakthrough, ma'am. 
But what exactly did the kid see?

474
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,240
I've called Kumar to make a sketch. 
Send him in when he gets here.

475
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,300
The kid saw a man in the car park 
the day before.

476
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,640
Must be Kamal Parihar's killer.

477
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,250
And Latika.

478
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,410
Who is it?

479
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,090
Who's there?

480
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,020
What the hell are you doing?

481
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,190
Dropped a cup? No one was here. 
So who were you serving?

482
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,980
Vinay, cool down.

483
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,170
Bajrang.

484
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,310
Const. Jhakar sent him here. 
Don't sneak around again.

485
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Go!

486
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,340
Listen.

487
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,630
There's a kid and his father outside. 
Get them some tea.

488
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,450
And bring tea for us.

489
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,590
Vinay Jaiswal - Station House Officer.

490
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,960
Our killer has asthma.

491
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,850
Before leaving the car park, he used 
his inhaler and then discarded it.

492
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,570
Lahanya picked it up.

493
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,280
I've called a sketch artist.

494
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,530
Lahanya will help him make 
the killer's sketch.

495
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,440
We'll see how long he can escape.

496
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,440
- How long will the sketch take? 
- A while more.

497
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,590
Anup.

498
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,340
Lahanya, are you done?

499
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,470
Lahanya!

500
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,550
Lahanya!

501
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,270
Lahanya, are you done?

502
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,920
Lahanya!

503
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,060
Lahanya, open the door!

504
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,060
Lahanya!

505
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,770
Lahanya!

506
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,060
This is ridiculous!

507
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,630
You were given one job, Anup.

508
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,130
What the hell's going on here?

509
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,700
Don't stare at me! 
Go and find him!

510
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,360
Go!

511
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,820
Hello.

512
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,050
Hello, sir.

513
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,730
Who is this?

514
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,300
Sir, a train ran over a kid 
near the bypass.

515
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,810
Tragic! But what can I do? 
File a police report yourself.

516
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,050
Sir, if I did that, 
how will it benefit you?

517
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,930
He's the boy your SP called 
as a witness in the murder enquiry.

518
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,460
Now the poor boy has killed himself.

519
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,760
If the press find out, 
the boss will be in big trouble.

520
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,670
Your call, sir.

521
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,260
Hey, I think this man is making 
a video of me.

522
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,720
Look.

523
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,150
I'll teach him a lesson.

524
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,770
Forget it! It's not worth it.

525
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,050
Wait! I'll fix him.

526
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,140
- Hello. Shooting a video? 
- Sorry, madam?

527
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,460
You heard what I said. 
Don't act smart.

528
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,350
Give me your phone!

529
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,820
Madam, what...?

530
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,820
Where are your manners? 
I'm a respectable man.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,140
Don't you teach me manners!

532
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,210
I'm a respectable man, madam.

533
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,490
I'll give you a slap 
you'll never forget.

534
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,030
Give me your phone!

535
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,030
Don't play the heroine!

536
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,690
Would you dare film 
your mother like this?

537
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,060
Filming your mother!

538
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,190
Acting smart!

539
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,620
Here's your phone. Now go!

540
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,440
Scram! Or I'll call the police. 
Move it!

541
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,770
No breaking news these days, 
so get ready for a big scoop.

542
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,900
Is it true the witness died 
in police custody?

543
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,690
My son, Lahanya!

544
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,990
What have you done to my son?

545
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,280
My son!

546
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,580
Where's my son?

547
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,020
Fingers are being pointed at SP Roy 
in a double murder case.

548
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,360
Are the police to blame for 
an innocent boy's death?

549
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,260
Will the administration take 
Shivani Roy to task?

550
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,850
You've been played, Shivani.

551
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,410
I can see that, sir.

552
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,460
Beniwal was a tough enemy, 
now you have Shekhawat too.

553
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,060
I didn't make an enemy 
of Brij Shekhawat.

554
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,580
He hates taking orders 
from a woman.

555
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,950
True, but instead of managing him, 
you turned him against you.

556
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,640
Sir, my job isn't managing egos.

557
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,780
You know your habit 
of being outspoken...

558
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,230
...is seen as arrogance.

559
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,830
When a woman is competent...

560
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,260
...and, God forbid, successful too...

561
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,030
...what's expected of her...

562
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,750
...since she's been given 
the chance to be successful...

563
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,660
...is that she behaves appropriately.

564
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,400
And that she's humble and polite.

565
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,150
If she ignores the rules, 
city folk call her a bit**...

566
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,870
...and to small towners she's 
a snooty bit**! Right?

567
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,460
Unfortunately you're right!

568
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,890
These are the rules of the world 
we live in.

569
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,900
The police are not apart 
from that world.

570
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,360
I get it, sir.

571
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,830
Now that my transfer order is here, 
please WhatsApp it to me.

572
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,770
Thank you, sir.

573
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,620
Hello, Vikram.

574
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,270
Shivani, I'm with a patient. 
Can I call you later?

575
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,060
Yeah, sure.

576
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,400
Fingers are being pointed 
at SP Roy.

577
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,240
Where's my son?

578
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,270
I'll drag this lowlife by the collar 
straight to court.

579
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,610
I've been transferred.

580
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,310
Tomorrow's Diwali.

581
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,490
The person who'll take charge 
will come in two days.

582
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,460
You're aware just how diligently 
I follow the rules.

583
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,890
So, for the next two days, 
until my replacement arrives...

584
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,240
...I'll believe I'm still the city's SP.

585
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,860
And in these two days I have 
a huge task before me.

586
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,890
To catch Latika's killer.

587
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,690
So no breaks and no sleep.

588
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,150
Kota's police force will work 24/7.

589
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,790
I know it's Diwali.

590
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,100
If anyone wants to celebrate Diwali, 
opt out now.

591
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,290
- No one's forcing you to work. 
- No, madam.

592
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,500
We're with you.

593
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,610
- Sure? 
- Yes, madam!

594
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,090
Good!

595
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,340
We'll catch this vermin in two days.

596
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,630
- Any doubts? 
- No, madam!

597
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,080
48 Hours.

598
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,580
48 HOURS LEFT.

599
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,790
So what do we have till now?

600
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,800
The suspect's inhaler.

601
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,520
Bharti, get a team to check 
every medical store in Kota.

602
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,450
Find out when the inhaler was bought. 
I need the batch number.

603
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,300
- Any questions? 
- No, madam.

604
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,340
- Good. Get to work then. 
- Yes, madam.

605
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,190
Where's everyone?

606
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:19,250
They've left for madam's office. 
It's her last day in Kota.

607
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,270
God knows who we'll have 
to put up with next.

608
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,110
Kamal Parihar had many enemies.

609
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,410
From the mining mafia to top 
politicians. He was reckless.

610
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,870
Maybe he was murdered 
by a contract killer.

611
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,210
That's evident.

612
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,170
At the Mumbai crime branch I learned 
there's no smoke without fire.

613
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,900
And if someone took out 
a contract on him...

614
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,340
...then some gangster or police 
informant is bound to be in the know.

615
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,040
Your underworld contacts any good?

616
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,060
They're good. But getting information 
out of them takes time and...

617
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,770
...we don't have time.

618
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,920
May I speak? 
I hope it won't annoy you.

619
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,360
Mr Shekhawat has been here 
for 18 years.

620
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,310
His network of informants 
is very strong.

621
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,680
If he helps us, we can get 
the information we need.

622
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,130
Fair enough.

623
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,990
In times of need one must embrace 
idiots too.

624
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,860
I felt bad about your transfer, madam.

625
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,430
No one can last long 
if they cross you.

626
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,050
Cross me, madam? 
I have nothing against you.

627
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,680
I meant it as a compliment.

628
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,340
As a senior colleague, I should've 
shown you more respect.

629
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,210
Why are you saying all this?

630
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,870
Let's put it behind us. 
Diwali is soon.

631
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,380
Then someone else will take charge.

632
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,360
Before I leave, I want to make 
progress in the Latika case.

633
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,990
Without you, it's unlikely.

634
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,990
Maybe that's why my parents 
named me "Brij."

635
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,910
You know what the name means.

636
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,810
'A bridge connecting two shores.'

637
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,010
Without me no one makes it across.

638
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,640
Help us cross over to the other side. 
I'll be gone in two days...

639
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,350
...so you'll be seen as the hero 
who solved the case.

640
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,690
My contact works in Mohan Jewellers 
in Rampura market.

641
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,020
He will take you to the right guy.

642
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,250
Who took out a contract on Parihar? 
And who was the hitman?

643
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,040
- You really cut to the chase! 
- No time to waste.

644
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,540
So I'll cut to the chase too.

645
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,130
If I start giving free information, 
there'd be a contract in my name.

646
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,850
Hello, sir. Shivani here.

647
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,410
Yes, sir. All good.

648
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,080
I need a favour, sir.

649
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,060
A friend has a consignment stuck 
at customs for over 3 months.

650
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,740
Nothing illegal. 
Just paperwork missing.

651
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,090
But, sir, I need it now.

652
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,070
I'll message you the details. 
Thank you so much.

653
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,740
Your homework's first-rate.

654
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,800
So is your network. Now talk.

655
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,290
I've spoken to the top guy, 
you'll get a message soon.

656
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,620
No, madam.

657
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,910
My network stays out of range 
till he texts.

658
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,420
How come you're so clued in?

659
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,550
I deal only in pricey goods.

660
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,910
And I don't mean diamonds.

661
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:47,540
Mr Mukesh said in today's world 
information fetches the most. Data!

662
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,860
See for yourself.

663
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,360
You got my goods worth 20 million 
cleared in return for information.

664
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,180
My diamonds would not 
get me as much.

665
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,330
Viplav Beniwal.

666
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,530
Viplav Beniwal paid a hitman 
to get Parihar.

667
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,180
Without proof you can't touch him. 
Or all hell will break loose.

668
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,590
Talk to Kunwar.

669
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,170
Sir, do you have a match?

670
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,260
Hit the scoundrel! Talk!

671
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,590
Talk! Who's the hitman?

672
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,020
Dip him in.

673
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,990
- Dip him in. 
- Pull him out.

674
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,410
Talk! What's his name?

675
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,800
Sunny...

676
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
His name is Sunny.

677
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,430
He works for Pandit.

678
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,390
Pandit sent for him from Meerut.

679
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:03,980
39 HOURS LEFT.

680
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,610
You know the building 
under construction near Kunhadi?

681
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,070
He's living there.

682
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,960
Because I got a tip-off in time 
so you were saved.

683
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,340
Get out of town for a few days.

684
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,770
No more messing around. 
Get it?

685
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,020
Yes, Bharti?

686
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,730
We've made a major breakthrough, 
madam.

687
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,150
The killer bought his inhaler 
at Jeevan Medical Stores.

688
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,910
And madam, the store belongs 
to Latika's father.

689
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,410
- What? 
- Yes, madam.

690
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,580
We're checking the CCTV footage.

691
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,970
- I'm sure we'll find something. 
- I'll join you in half an hour.

692
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,560
Once we find a shot of him on CCTV, 
he won't escape us.

693
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,600
Anup, seal the crime scene. 
And take the girl to the hospital.

694
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,000
All the beggars are my friends.

695
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,430
I take care of them.

696
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,700
That's why they help me 
when I need them.

697
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,050
Step up the security, Shivani. 
And track that boy down.

698
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,900
Yes, sir, we're keeping 
a close watch.

699
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,010
I'll keep you posted. Yes, sir.

700
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,610
Bajrang!

701
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,600
What happened to you?

702
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,460
Bajrang, get up!

703
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,260
I'll take you to the hospital.

704
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,760
Bajrang, stay awake!

705
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,360
Don't doze off.

706
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,840
The hospital's not far.

707
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,870
Hang in there, please.

708
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,000
Stay awake, please.

709
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,970
That's it.

710
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,850
Good, Bajrang.

711
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,230
How did this happen?

712
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,660
Who hit you?

713
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,680
Talk to me, Bajrang.

714
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,910
Bajrang.

715
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,750
Sunny. That's your name, right?

716
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:00,190
I saw your belt when you were getting 
into the car, you monster!

717
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,620
You rapist!

718
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,890
Hit me. Hit me, madam.

719
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,460
I'm crazy. I need treatment, madam.

720
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,280
Sure, I'll get you treated 
at the police station.

721
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,900
I know I've been evil.

722
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,160
I deserve to be thrashed. 
Hit me.

723
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,840
Yes, Vinay. I've got Sunny.

724
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,700
Forgive me.

725
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,810
Hurry to the station near the bridge.

726
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,930
I'll see you there.

727
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,050
OK.

728
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,380
Gun!

729
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,320
Hey!

730
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,540
35 HOURS LEFT.

731
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,690
- Jai Hind. 
- Jai Hind, Anup.

732
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,260
Any news?

733
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,350
Sunny nearly drowned, but a fisherman 
managed to save him.

734
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:31,840
Before Vinay could get to 
the fisherman's hut, he was gone.

735
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,800
- Is the fisherman in custody? 
- Yes.

736
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,610
Good. Get a detailed statement 
from him.

737
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,320
And the girl we saw at Sunny's? 
How is she?

738
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,050
Better but she's still in shock.

739
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,830
He made her suffer like Latika.

740
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,440
Kota City Police - Rajasthan.

741
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,500
Latika's friend told us 
about an incident on a bus.

742
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,270
A passenger filmed a guy 
getting beaten up on the bus.

743
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,810
In 34 seconds, you'll see the guy 
who teased Latika.

744
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,140
Latika didn't see Sunny. But we can 
see him clearly in this video.

745
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,650
Good job, guys. Let this clip 
go viral on WhatsApp.

746
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:16,110
Upload a video message from me.

747
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,540
I want this video on every phone 
in Kota within the hour.

748
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,150
Right?

749
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,850
Oh, I gotta take this.

750
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,290
Hello!

751
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,540
Happy Diwali!

752
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,110
- Happy Diwali! 
- Happy Diwali, aunty!

753
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,170
Why are you wearing 
such shabby clothes on Diwali?

754
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,680
It's style! You won't get it!

755
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,310
Look at your Diwali clothes! 
They're shabbier than mine.

756
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,520
Come on, guys!

757
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:45,250
Don't fight today.

758
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,510
Meera, you made a Rangoli 
for the first time.

759
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,550
- Won't you show it to your aunt? 
- Just a minute.

760
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,070
It took me two hours to draw.

761
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,340
Look!

762
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,370
It's not bad. 
But I think it can be better.

763
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:06,070
My social media queen, do you 
ever study? Or only chatting?

764
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,340
Yes! I'm studying hard...

765
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,370
- Hey, where is she? 
- She's gone.

766
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:16,020
Vikram, she has her college 
submission next week.

767
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,320
I hope she's prepared.

768
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,240
Yeah, don't worry. 
By the way, how's the pain?

769
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,210
I've taken my painkillers, doctor!

770
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,840
I think I'm gonna be good to go 
for a few hours.

771
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,910
A video from Vigyan Nagar 
in Kota has gone viral.

772
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,120
The clip shows a boy teasing a girl. 
He's seen running from the bus.

773
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,670
When the other passengers tried 
to catch him, the culprit fled.

774
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,050
The city SP has filmed a message 
for everyone in Kota.

775
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:49,260
See how he ran when challenged 
by an angry crowd.

776
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:55,190
This is the boy who brutally raped 
and murdered Latika Agarwal.

777
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,400
Look carefully at his face.

778
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:09,230
The time has come for us all 
to flush this rat from its sewer.

779
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:14,110
Anyone with any information, 
please contact the police.

780
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,800
Greetings, Pandit-ji.

781
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,880
You had a close shave.

782
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,830
I'm not the type to die so easily. 
You know that.

783
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,880
I told you to get out of town 
and not mess around.

784
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,780
I don't leave without repaying 
a debt.

785
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,790
Is that so? Then die.

786
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,940
You said you had another job 
for me.

787
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,600
A job? For you?

788
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,670
Son, your face is plastered 
all over Kota. You're famous.

789
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,640
Give me another chance.

790
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,660
I can do it.

791
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,830
You don't get it. 
Hang up and get out of town.

792
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:56,770
Pandit-ji, you're ditching me when 
I'm in trouble. I won't forget.

793
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,760
- Threatening me? 
- No, giving you a chance.

794
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,860
You scoundrel!

795
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,700
You tease girls on buses 
and get beaten up...

796
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,990
...and you have the audacity 
to offer me another chance?

797
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,840
I'm no saint.

798
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,350
But I'll have nothing to do with a man 
who rapes and murders young girls.

799
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,260
Now listen!

800
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,100
If you dare call me again, 
I'll track you down...

801
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,990
...and shove a bomb up your...

802
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,830
Got it?

803
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,730
"Shove a bomb up your...got it?"

804
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,200
- Hello. 
- Yes?

805
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,910
The boy's still alive.

806
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,970
He called me asking for work. 
I said no.

807
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:48,870
Why?

808
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,660
He's unbalanced. 
I'll get someone else.

809
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:56,010
Pandit-ji, make it quick. 
I'm running out of time.

810
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,300
When I make up my mind, 
that's it.

811
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,660
People waste time thinking, 
I just act.

812
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,980
One minute.

813
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,450
Yes, brother?

814
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,880
The owner of this phone has 
had an accident.

815
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,690
What?

816
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,100
I was near the junction. I saw 
the accident with my own eyes.

817
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,540
- He has a blue car, right? 
- Yes.

818
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,090
- Are you related to him? 
- I'm his sister.

819
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,800
- Where are you? 
- Mehta Nagar. And you?

820
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,410
Nearby. At KGK Classes.

821
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,390
I'll be there in two minutes. 
How will I recognise you?

822
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,120
I'm wearing a yellow top.

823
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,320
OK.

824
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,730
Mom, please. Pick up!

825
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:49,920
Madam...

826
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:56,560
Your brother...here's his phone.

827
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,080
That's his phone.

828
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,980
He's badly hurt.

829
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,310
They've rushed him to 
Kota General Hospital.

830
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,590
Should I drop you there?

831
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:29,810
Pandit, got your granddaughter's photo? 
Is it clear?

832
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,550
What do you want?

833
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,530
Look at your watch.

834
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,220
It's 5.10.

835
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:42,660
In two hours, at 7.10 sharp, the bomb 
hanging round her neck will explode.

836
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:47,350
The explosives you gave me 
to kill Kamal's wife...remember?

837
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,810
Sunny, this is between you and me. 
Why drag her into this?

838
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,670
Now you listen!

839
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:57,490
You tell that damn SP to apologise 
to me on TV.

840
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,030
Until I get her video on my phone...

841
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,700
...I won't tell you where your 
grandchild is. So do as you please!

842
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,680
Why nurture rats you can't control!

843
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:13,990
- He's made life a living hell. 
- Tell Pandit I'll fix it.

844
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:17,970
Get the CCTV footage from 
the KGK Classes. I'm coming.

845
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:18,710
30 HOURS LEFT.

846
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,190
Rest assured, sir. 
We're on the case.

847
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,150
I'm leading the investigation 
personally. Yes, sir.

848
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,860
Madam, the Councillor was trying 
to call you.

849
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,570
I have no time for such calls. 
I have a job to do.

850
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,910
A child's life is at stake. 
Just say you're sorry...

851
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,780
You think my apologising 
will stop him?

852
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,660
If you don't, he'll kill her for sure.

853
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:44,690
Look!

854
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,530
Stop. Zoom in.

855
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,970
They stopped at the Talwandi 
roundabout.

856
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,820
Do they turn left or right?

857
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,050
- Where's the other footage? 
- One minute.

858
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,110
Ma'am, the other CCTV cameras 
aren't working.

859
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,130
What?

860
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,890
How's that possible? 
Check again, Kanan.

861
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:05,750
Rewind!

862
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,490
The camera was on.

863
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:11,310
Here's the footage from 
the previous hour.

864
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,320
You lout!

865
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,110
Three roads lead off that roundabout. 
Where do we find him?

866
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,310
Show me the Talwandi footage.

867
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,300
Maybe he didn't go any further.

868
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,950
Your hunch was right.

869
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,210
They made a U-turn and headed back 
to Rawatbhata.

870
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,290
This is five minutes later.

871
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,480
- The girl is with him. 
- Follow him.

872
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,460
He's heading to Janta Industrial.

873
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,110
There are no CCTV cameras there.

874
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,220
No problem. We'll head there.

875
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,600
Shekhawat, get your team 
and come with us.

876
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,180
Bharti, check if the bomb squad 
has left Jaipur. Quick!

877
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,050
Restricted Area. Do not enter. 
Authorized personnel only.

878
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,840
Trespassers will be prosecuted.

879
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,350
Dead end, madam. 
There's no one here.

880
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,390
Please take my advice...

881
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,940
...just apologise.

882
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,300
Madam...

883
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:25,190
Trespassers will be prosecuted.

884
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:28,170
There's so many cars about.

885
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,500
How come the watchman is asleep?

886
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,590
Search the place!

887
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,800
Where's the SP? 
Brij, I don't want to talk to you.

888
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,270
Hey, SP!

889
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,220
I've been calling you for half an hour. 
Why aren't you picking up?

890
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,070
- Vinay, escort him out. 
- Hey, SP!

891
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,680
I've brought cash.

892
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,260
Name your price and say sorry 
on camera.

893
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,620
Govind Mishra, do you want your 
grandchild or my apology?

894
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,110
- Please. Let the police do their job. 
- I don't trust the police.

895
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,340
And a woman even less.

896
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,690
You're being transferred, right? 
I'll get it cancelled.

897
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,220
It's too late.

898
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,040
Look at your watch. 
Only ten minutes to go.

899
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,220
Please. Let me do my job.

900
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:49,800
Pandit-ji!

901
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,080
If anything happens to my grandchild, 
I won't spare you.

902
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,710
Pandit-ji, come with me.

903
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,870
Madam, these boxes are full 
of mannequins.

904
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,880
He must've hidden Priyanka 
in one of these boxes.

905
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:05,670
Check them all. Anup, upstairs.

906
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,840
Madam, four minutes to go. 
It'll be impossible to find her in time.

907
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,950
It wasn't easy calming Pandit down.

908
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,080
If we don't find Priyanka, 
we'll all be fired.

909
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:21,460
If Sunny wanted to kill Priyanka, 
he would've done it hours ago.

910
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:26,590
He doesn't just kill, 
he wants to stage a spectacle.

911
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:32,470
He won't hide Priyanka in some box.

912
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:38,380
He'll keep her in a place 
where she can be seen by everyone.

913
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,030
"If you hadn't humiliated me 
in public...

914
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,690
"...I would not have to do this.

915
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:22,240
"Think carefully about your next step.

916
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,010
"Your lover, Sunny."

917
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:30,510
One second.

918
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:31,880
Hello.

919
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,290
- Viplav Beniwal? 
- Yes, speaking.

920
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:37,210
What a terrible thing has happened 
to Pandit's grandchild!

921
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,390
Who is this?

922
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,140
Hear me out.

923
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:44,440
Pandit isn't of any use right now.

924
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,790
So who'll do your dirty work?

925
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,830
You want to?

926
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,820
Sure. It'll be done tomorrow.

927
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,160
- Know what the job is? 
- I can guess.

928
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,650
You have two obstacles 
to get the election ticket.

929
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,280
Kamal Parihar. I got rid of him.

930
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,330
But the second one is alive.

931
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,080
You can't win the ticket 
while she lives.

932
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:13,170
If you help me skip town, 
I'll do your job.

933
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,170
Think it over.

934
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,350
Even if I get caught, 
the trail won't lead to you.

935
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,310
People think I'm nuts anyway.

936
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:25,340
Sunanda-ji!

937
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:27,330
Beniwal-ji?

938
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,230
Haven't seen you lately.

939
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,490
I'm right here. I've no intention 
of going anywhere.

940
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,710
News of Priyanka's abduction 
is spreading on social media.

941
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:41,080
I know. My phone 
hasn't stopped ringing.

942
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,850
Here is the file you ordered 
from Delhi.

943
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:48,020
He's in a jail in Meerut.

944
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,030
- Get an appointment. 
- Yes, madam.

945
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,550
Bharti, go home.

946
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,380
Home? We have too much to do.

947
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,930
It's your first Diwali 
as a newly-wed.

948
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,310
You're bound to miss it 
next year too.

949
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,140
- Madam, you're too much! 
- Dismissed.

950
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,910
- Jai Hind, madam. 
- Jai Hind.

951
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,660
Ma'am, you need to watch TV.

952
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,580
Before the break 
we were talking about...

953
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,040
...a game of chess being played 
in the city of Kota.

954
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:22,330
The city's beautiful SP Shivani Roy 
is being pursued...

955
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:26,170
...by a two-time rapist 
and murderer, Sunny.

956
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:29,070
In his attempt to express 
his love for the SP...

957
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,420
...he worked as a tea-boy 
in her office...

958
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,700
...but when Shivani uploaded 
a video that went viral...

959
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,060
...showing him being thrashed 
by a crowd...

960
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,380
...in a fit of rage, he abducted 
a young girl...

961
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,500
...and attempted to blow her up.

962
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:51,000
Wow! One should learn 
how to use the press from you!

963
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,410
She wanted to make me 
famous in Kota.

964
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,750
But I've made her infamous 
all over India!

965
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,970
If a male officer were 
in Shivani's place...

966
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,120
...could this crime have been 
prevented?

967
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:07,960
Or jackals like Sunny, who take 
advantage of women, go scot-free?

968
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:13,680
Your friend and host, Amit Sharma, 
will return...

969
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,060
...with questions for the SP. 
Stay tuned.

970
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,310
Hello, sir.

971
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,600
Isn't this media circus getting 
too much?

972
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,670
Along with you they're mocking 
the entire police force.

973
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,220
And that too on Diwali!

974
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,300
I know, sir.

975
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,010
Amit Sharma is pestering me 
to appear on his show.

976
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,100
You should've stopped working 
on this case.

977
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,000
- You've been transferred anyway. 
- I still have another day, sir.

978
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,090
Shall we end this ego trip, Shivani?

979
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,220
You're ruining the department's 
name to prove a point.

980
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:45,720
Do you want me to catch the criminal? 
Or handle the media?

981
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,540
You started this drama, 
so deal with it.

982
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,620
20 HOURS LEFT.

983
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,390
Happy Diwali, Shivani. 
I've called so many times.

984
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,410
Give me a chance to interview you.

985
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,570
Tomorrow at 10. In your studio.

986
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:12,160
Tomorrow? Madam, it's Diwali. 
How about the day after?

987
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,670
Tomorrow or never.

988
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,770
My friend, then it's yes!

989
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:25,650
Happy Diwali to all my brothers 
and sisters!

990
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,210
'Bitter Questions.'

991
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:32,070
Your host Amit Sharma presents your 
favourite programme 'Bitter Questions.'

992
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,690
Today we have with us Kota's 
famous SP, Shivani Shivaji Roy.

993
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:37,860
Shivani-ji, comfortable?

994
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,890
Let's start. I don't have much time.

995
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:47,130
So, friends, in today's programme 
we'll start by asking 'Bitter questions.'

996
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,900
My first question.

997
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:54,730
A murdering rapist trying to impress you 
or to take revenge on you...

998
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:59,390
...straps a time bomb 
to an innocent girl.

999
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:04,100
Don't you think having a male officer 
in your place...

1000
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,240
...could have prevented 
this disaster?

1001
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,810
Is it not time for women 
to introspect a little?

1002
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,540
A bitter question.

1003
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,880
Women alone don't need to introspect. 
Our entire society should.

1004
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,840
Whenever women work in any field, 
the police force or in politics...

1005
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:24,470
...why must their capabilities 
always be questioned?

1006
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,200
Because capabilities are not 
the only concern.

1007
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,300
It's about nature.

1008
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,330
When Mother Nature has created 
a difference between men and women...

1009
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:35,420
...who are we to dispute it?

1010
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,130
And when, in the name of modernity, 
we set aside this difference...

1011
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:41,900
...lessons of the Ramayana 
come before us.

1012
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,270
In the name of Mother Nature, 
do you also believe...

1013
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,510
...that Sita is the guilty one 
and not the demon Ravan?

1014
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,790
Are you comparing yourself 
to Goddess Sita?

1015
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,710
Goddess Sita is in every woman.

1016
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,030
Because, like Her, every woman goes 
through the test of fire each day.

1017
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,890
Only women are doubted.

1018
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,240
You're right, Shivani-ji, 
women must endure many things.

1019
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,720
But after years of struggle, a new era 
of equality is approaching.

1020
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:12,390
It's gradual but women have the chance 
to become equal.

1021
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,820
But every job is not meant 
for women.

1022
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,060
People once thought women were 
unworthy of being educated.

1023
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,290
Many still believe that.

1024
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,370
By the way, what equality are you 
talking about, sir?

1025
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:27,800
Do you believe a woman's life 
is equal to a man's?

1026
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,580
Just because some women 
get educated?

1027
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,070
What do you know about being a woman?

1028
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,300
We have to answer questions 
a man is never asked. Such as...

1029
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,250
"Are my clothes decent enough?" 
Our moral character is questioned.

1030
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:44,030
If we laugh too much, 
some people get the wrong idea.

1031
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:46,000
We work as hard as any man.

1032
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:49,500
But when it comes to promotion? 
"No! She's not up to the job."

1033
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,320
When a woman comes home from work, 
she must cook.

1034
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:56,000
If husband and wife work, 
it's still the wife who does the cooking.

1035
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,970
If a man works all night, they say: 
"Poor guy! He works so hard."

1036
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:04,830
If a woman works all night, 
they say, "All night? Why?"

1037
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:11,550
We must think of things 
only a woman can understand.

1038
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,810
"Hope my bra strap isn't showing?"

1039
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:17,150
"He's ogling me. 
Hope he won't harass me."

1040
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:21,060
In a crowd a man can touch a woman 
anywhere he wants...

1041
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:25,200
...because a woman in a public place 
is public property.

1042
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:28,780
Men dislike the fact women 
have reserved seats on a bus.

1043
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,890
"They want reserved seats 
and equality!"

1044
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:35,130
If every month blood poured 
like water from your body...

1045
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,180
...and you had a headache 
or swollen feet...

1046
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,150
...then let's talk about equality.

1047
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:45,380
So, please don't waste your energy 
by telling women what to do, sir.

1048
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:50,750
Just make sure we get the opportunity 
of doing what we'd like to do.

1049
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,860
Equality is a long way off, sir.

1050
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,000
It'll be a big thing if we got 
our fair share.

1051
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,270
You're a fine speaker!

1052
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,720
You brought tears to my eyes.

1053
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,710
If your actions were as effective...

1054
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,370
...you would've caught me by now.

1055
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,750
Now listen to me.

1056
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,120
There's this girl, a lot like you...

1057
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:39,210
...who thinks she's smarter 
than everyone else.

1058
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,980
I'll abduct her today.

1059
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,800
She'll be receiving the rage 
I feel for you.

1060
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,440
You'll find her floating 
in a ditch like Latika.

1061
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,900
- If you have the guts, stop me! 
- Just you try!

1062
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:57,730
I'll thrash you so badly, no one 
will be able to tell your age.

1063
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,330
You scum!

1064
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:03,880
I think the pervert is keeping us busy 
so he can skip town.

1065
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:04,650
06 HOURS LEFT.

1066
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,770
No, Vinay.

1067
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,490
I told you he's not afraid 
of being caught.

1068
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,840
He wants to prove his point.

1069
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,390
He'll abduct some celebrity in order 
to humiliate me.

1070
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,990
He said he'd abduct a woman like madam.

1071
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:22,730
Maybe he's thinking of Ketki Sood, 
the coaching class owner.

1072
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,840
No. She has too many bodyguards.

1073
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:28,550
Or it could be Mamta, 
the sportswoman?

1074
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:30,510
She's out of town right now.

1075
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:32,110
So who?

1076
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,090
Sunanda Chaudhury.

1077
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,100
The Party will give the election ticket 
to Sunanda not Beniwal.

1078
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,410
Beniwal knows about it.

1079
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,120
He won't let it happen.

1080
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,060
You're right.

1081
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,330
Beniwal asked Sunny 
to get rid of Kamal Parihar.

1082
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:55,380
Now he'll get Sunanda 
out of the way.

1083
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,800
In exchange Beniwal will protect 
Sunny from the police.

1084
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:02,570
Where's Sunanda now?

1085
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,810
Lokvichar Party.

1086
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,570
SP madam?

1087
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,620
- Yes, madam? 
- Get Sunanda on the line.

1088
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,750
She's gone to the bathroom.

1089
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,820
- I want to talk to her now. 
- Yes, madam. I'll get her.

1090
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,680
Ladies Toilet.

1091
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:00,290
Swami, what's in the bag?

1092
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,410
Coconuts from the prayer meeting. 
I was asked to put them in the car.

1093
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:14,600
Sunanda's not here.

1094
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,840
Hey you, stop!

1095
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:39,860
She's nowhere.

1096
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:44,330
Her life's in danger. I'm sending you 
a photo of a guy...

1097
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:47,050
...look out for him. 
I'm on my way.

1098
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,870
Come on, fast!

1099
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,500
Ma'am, he just left...

1100
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,080
...in a green Ambassador. 
Number plate 5401.

1101
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,070
Look for him. 
I'll talk to the SP there.

1102
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:05,120
It's Diwali. I don't have people.

1103
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:09,730
I'll bring a team. 
But please start tracking him.

1104
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,860
- Where is he? 
- Go!

1105
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,860
- Move it. 
- Girish, one minute.

1106
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,680
Yes, sir. Wait!

1107
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,090
Wait!

1108
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,960
That's the car!

1109
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,290
He broke through a barricade 
at Mandana.

1110
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,890
- I'm following him. See you there. 
- OK.

1111
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,790
Bharti, head towards Mandana.

1112
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,880
He's a decoy! Sunny paid him 
10,000 rupees to drive this way.

1113
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:23,760
- Sir. 
- Any update, Keval?

1114
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:27,470
A car with the same number plate 
was spotted.

1115
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:31,310
Must be him. The state border 
is a few miles away.

1116
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,670
If he crosses the border, 
we can't arrest him.

1117
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:34,790
Let's go.

1118
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:37,880
Ma'am.

1119
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,300
What's wrong?

1120
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,260
It's too simple. Something's not right.

1121
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:47,660
This is no time for playing hunches. 
The IG has called four times already.

1122
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,250
I know.

1123
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:51,820
Hello.

1124
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,220
Yes, Sharma?

1125
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,920
Bundi? OK.

1126
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,960
They've tracked Sunny's phone 
near Bundi.

1127
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:02,260
Could it be Sunny?

1128
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,210
I doubt it's Sunny at all. 
I've seen him run.

1129
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,580
He has asthma. 
He gets breathless easily.

1130
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,520
Someone who gets breathless 
when running will not run, he'll hide.

1131
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:17,150
My hunch is he's near the temple.

1132
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,520
Take Vinay and follow the car.

1133
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:22,410
Anup, you track down the phone.

1134
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,740
Bharti, you're coming with me. 
Come on. Move it, guys.

1135
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:46,070
01 HOUR LEFT.

1136
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,240
He's hiding somewhere here.

1137
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,400
We must find him 
or Sunanda's had it.

1138
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:57,490
So, is it clear to you now?

1139
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,600
What?

1140
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,490
What's clear?

1141
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,840
Your real status in the world.

1142
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,860
You can talk big...

1143
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:10,760
...but when it comes to action, 
you amount to nothing.

1144
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,170
What's wrong?

1145
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,670
You got a thrashing. Wasn't it enough?

1146
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,350
Want some more?

1147
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,500
No! I want my mother.

1148
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,020
Listen...

1149
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:37,020
Do you try things in life beyond 
your limits?

1150
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:38,890
No.

1151
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,400
Are you at college?

1152
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:41,510
Yes.

1153
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,660
Do you plan to work?

1154
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,580
Speak up! Will you ever work?

1155
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,420
Yes, I will.

1156
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:50,940
And then?

1157
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:55,080
You think you're smarter 
than the others?

1158
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,690
Will you throw your weight around?

1159
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,880
Don't make that mistake!

1160
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:10,230
Or you'll end up like this madam. 
Get it?

1161
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:13,330
Well, Sunanda madam?

1162
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,660
Having fun?

1163
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,990
- What did I ever do to you? 
- Nothing.

1164
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,110
If I don't keep you in your place...

1165
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:24,390
...you'll sit on my head.

1166
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,070
It's written in our Holy books...

1167
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:31,760
...the day a woman strays 
from her limits...

1168
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,010
What?

1169
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,680
...that day the world 
will start to rot.

1170
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,110
Don't you have a mother?

1171
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,510
Of course I did!

1172
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,150
I didn't spare her. 
Nor did my father.

1173
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:48,510
You're nothing to me!

1174
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,850
Happy Wedding.

1175
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,840
Why is the door closed on Diwali?

1176
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,550
No lamps burning either.

1177
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,540
SP Kota, Shivani Shivaji Roy.

1178
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,880
I must talk urgently to you.

1179
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:54,330
Seen this boy anywhere?

1180
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,570
No.

1181
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,710
Ma'am, and you?

1182
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:58,930
No.

1183
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:03,130
How odd! You haven't lit 
any Diwali lamps.

1184
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:04,910
I was about to.

1185
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:07,990
Who else lives here?

1186
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,350
My wife, a young son and daughter.

1187
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,470
Where's your daughter?

1188
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,690
At medical college in Jaipur. 
She lives in a hostel.

1189
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21,420
If you ever see this boy, 
call this number.

1190
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,730
Thank you.

1191
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:25,810
Excuse me.

1192
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:30,630
My battery's dead. 
Can I use your landline?

1193
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:32,650
The line's dead.

1194
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:35,630
And your mobile?

1195
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:38,330
Sorry, madam. 
Please try the neighbours.

1196
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,360
I'm searching your house. 
Excuse me.

1197
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:46,920
Madam, you can't barge in. 
You don't have a search warrant.

1198
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,730
Please don't go any further.

1199
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,750
Don't go inside.

1200
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,540
Where is he?

1201
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:03,980
My daughter is with him. 
He took our phones away.

1202
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,050
He said he'd kill her 
if we called for help.

1203
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:08,750
Please save her.

1204
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,620
Why did you let him in?

1205
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:14,410
We were expecting a temple offering.

1206
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,860
We thought he was from the temple.

1207
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,860
- Please save our child. 
- Here's my phone. Charge it.

1208
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:25,130
Call the last number dialled 
and give this address to Bharti.

1209
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:28,220
I'll take care of it. 
Please don't worry.

1210
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,390
The police is here.

1211
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,320
I need a car.

1212
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,650
Let go of her.

1213
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,100
That's exactly how your father 
killed your mother, right?

1214
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:57,280
Wow. Miss Know-it-All!

1215
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,510
That day your mother knew 
your father had lost control.

1216
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,740
To save herself she hid 
on the roof terrace.

1217
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,680
But your father found her...

1218
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,300
...and throttled her to death.

1219
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,890
And you stood quietly by. 
You did nothing to save her.

1220
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,710
My father was completely nuts.

1221
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,940
If I had stopped him, he would've 
killed me too. I saved myself.

1222
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,090
You could've saved her 
if you had wanted.

1223
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:41,050
I told you I couldn't come 
between them.

1224
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,530
Your mother was hiding 
on the roof terrace.

1225
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,380
Your father was incapable 
of finding her.

1226
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,880
You told him where she was hiding, 
didn't you?

1227
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:55,550
Shut up, you witch! 
Who told you this rubbish?

1228
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,670
I went to Meerut. 
I met your father in jail.

1229
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:02,980
You used your father 
to kill your mother.

1230
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,700
Get lost! You witch!

1231
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,200
He couldn't bear the guilt 
of her murder...

1232
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:18,750
...that's when he became 
an asthmatic.

1233
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:24,870
Paint.

1234
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,880
I'll show you!

1235
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:42,900
Why did you get your mother killed? 
She loved you.

1236
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,610
She protected you from your father.

1237
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,050
She talked rubbish!

1238
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,360
She was the only woman in our 
neighbourhood who raised her voice.

1239
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:54,410
I was ashamed of her.

1240
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,110
You women are an ungrateful breed.

1241
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,980
You love talking too.

1242
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,030
So, go join her.

1243
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,510
Hey!

1244
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,070
You have asthma, don't you?

1245
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:20,330
This paint will kill you!

1246
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:43,920
Stop!

1247
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,580
Mummy.

1248
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:42,100
India reported 338,954 crimes against women 
including 38,947 rapes in 2016 - NCRB Reports.

1249
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:50,190
India ranks 131st among 152 countries in Global 
Ranking of women's inclusion and well being.

1250
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:58,410
India's population is 48% female. But women hold 
just under 12% of seats in the National Legislature.

1251
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:05,100
It's time we changed this.
