1
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,670
Why can't I Whatsapp call my sister?

2
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,550
Mom, Whatsapp call is only possible if the
other person has Whatsapp as well.

3
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,480
But how do we know if
they have it or not?

4
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,120
You can see everything
in your contact list.

5
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,810
Alright. I'll check it.

6
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,740
But did you see pictures of Jeetu's son?

7
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,380
Looks so grown up now.

8
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,370
I have muted that group, mom.

9
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,260
Why?

10
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,370
They are on Whatsapp all day!

11
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,850
Keep sending good mornings,
good evenings and forward messages.

12
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,770
You should not do that, son.
They will feel bad.

13
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,320
Why would they feel bad?

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,710
They won't know if I've muted or not.

15
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,230
Anyways, Listen…

16
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,030
Naresh's son wanted your
advice for taking admission.

17
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,680
Should he enroll for I.T. or C.S.?

18
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,370
Both are the same.

19
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,050
He's right here.
Do you want to talk to him?

20
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,740
No, don't. Mom, listen.

21
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,990
I have to pack the lunchbox. I'm getting late.
Tell him to call me in evening.

22
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,090
Any new recipes?

23
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,660
You daily give your wife
new things to eat...

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,360
Nikunj, is this T-shirt for laundry?
- Make something for your mother too.

25
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,270
But, mom, I can only make
something, if you visit.

26
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,910
Is it mom? Give me.

27
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,170
Hello? Yes, mom.

28
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,360
We have got invitation of
Dhirubhai's son's wedding.

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,430
Are you coming?

30
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,470
No. How can I? You only go.

31
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,590
Fine. How much we should
put in the gift envelope?

32
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,470
Better you guys decide it.
- Fine. I'll do it.

33
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm about to leave for school.
- Okay.

34
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,700
Bye.
- Bye.

35
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,780
Whose wedding is it?
- What's it to you?

36
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,710
You will be exempted,
but I will have to go.

37
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,060
But why are you in such a hurry? Sit and
have tea. I've made French toast.

38
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,190
If you want to do such experiments,
learn to wake up early.

39
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,710
I'm already late.

40
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,470
Hey, Your lunchbox!

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,080
I've made lentils.

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,010
Keep the box upright,
or else it'll spill. - Okay.

43
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,150
Bye.
- Bye.

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,340
See you.

45
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,540
Hello.
- Hello!

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,400
Good morning. - Good morning.
- What's up?

47
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,590
See this, it's throwing an error.

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Look, I put the code...

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,310
Enter. Error.

50
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,600
Review it once.

51
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,600
See, again error.

52
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,410
Give me a minute.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,400
What if we replicate the names?

54
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,870
We shouldn’t replicate everywhere.
- But why?

55
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,900
What if anyone changes the name?

56
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,820
Then we'll update everything.
- Dude, that's a bad design.

57
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,600
You're thinking like this right now
because there are only two records.

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,720
What will you do when there
will be million records?

59
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,560
Overall, There will be a load on the
system. The app will lag.

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,270
You're right but...

61
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,390
Hello?

62
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,380
Hi, Shreya. Good time to talk?

63
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,560
Yeah. Yes.

64
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,540
Listen...

65
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,770
Just a minute.

66
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,180
You finish the API.
I'll review it later.

67
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,040
Okay.
- Hello? Hold for a minute.

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
Yes, I know. No, nothing like that...

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,870
Yeah. Hey.

70
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,880
Good morning.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,300
Yes, tell me.

72
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,070
So, everything's okay in the CV, right?

73
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes. Except the changes
I told you, it's alright.

74
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,150
You send it to me, I'll forward
it to my manager.

75
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,660
Okay. What do you think?
When will I get the interview call?

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,700
You will find out only
after the first round.

77
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,850
But I'll try to set it on Friday.

78
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,910
So that we can chill out
on the weekend?

79
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,680
You really didn't need to go there.

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,700
Hey, we both got call at the same time.

81
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,970
And you said no.

82
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,840
But this time, don't take any chances.

83
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,440
Don't dream so high.

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,700
I don't think it will
be possible to stay.

85
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,880
You and Hardik both can come.

86
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,930
Not sure about him.

87
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,910
Anyway, I'll mail you.

88
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,140
You check if you need
more changes, okay?

89
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,180
And let me know.

90
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,250
Okay?
- Okay. Bye.

91
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,560
Bye.

92
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,140
Did you fill the performance review?
Today is the last day.

93
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,630
It's so boring.

94
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,510
Should we focus on work or
remember how much we worked?

95
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,780
Yeah. Then go and tell Vishal.

96
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,340
Right. Everyone has the problem,
and only I will go and tell him?

97
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,760
You are senior, sir.

98
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,390
I don't need any more load.
I have enough already.

99
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,130
It's better I fill it today only.

100
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,570
Quick sync up, guys. Come on.

101
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,460
Here.
- Okay.

102
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,850
All the bugs of this screen
have been fixed.

103
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,470
Tomorrow we'll release.
- Very nice.

104
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,630
Shreya and Shivam.
Amazing work on HelpMates.

105
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,930
Thank you.

106
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,060
Okay, guys. Let's talk about FieldTrack.

107
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,340
Big news.

108
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,120
We have to give a
demo to... Guess who?

109
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,340
To the CEO of Zycus Pharma.
Premal Shroff.

110
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,780
Okay.
- If the demo is successful then...

111
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,130
This will be our first big customer.

112
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,370
They also want to invest in tech, and
this is an opportunity for us.

113
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,730
It can be our product.

114
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,680
We'll have to go to US for giving demo!

115
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,860
No.

116
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
They'll be in India next month.
Then we'll talk.

117
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,590
But the work of next phase which we were
supposed to finish within two months...

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,140
We'll have to do it in two weeks now.

119
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,410
Isn't two weeks of time very less?

120
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,970
Yes, but we don't have any option.

121
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,640
We'll have to do it.

122
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,980
We have committed.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,520
Any more questions?

124
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,730
What will they use this app for?

125
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,950
For MR tracking and delivery tracking.

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,980
Okay.
- Got it?

127
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,850
But...

128
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,000
But MRs usually oppose
for tracking, right?

129
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,970
That's client's issue. Not ours.

130
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,510
We have to do what we have to do.

131
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,000
On daily basis, give it to
Nikunj for testing.

132
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm leaving. - Okay.
- One minute.

133
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,580
What about the other QA?

134
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,690
We'll have to hire someone.
I'm overloaded.

135
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,260
We will do something.
I'll talk to Mitesh.

136
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,170
I'll do something. We'll hire one.

137
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,940
Let's get back to work, guys. Come on.

138
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,250
Okay.
- Come on. Rock and roll.

139
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,170
Listen...
- We'll talk later.

140
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,420
You should get your passport soon.

141
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,740
Give one plate.

142
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,980
What's up?

143
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
This two-week deadline is impossible.

144
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,570
I know.

145
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,550
What 'I know'?

146
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,280
How can we work like this?

147
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,120
Then why did you come here? You
should have stayed in Hyderabad.

148
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,930
As far as I know, you liked that
work culture and salary better.

149
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,130
Salary?

150
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,680
Vishal didn’t give the
increment he promised.

151
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
I switched to be close to hometown.

152
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,340
But you are right. I shouldn’t have come.

153
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,150
Now you've come here, right?
Why don't you accept what it is?

154
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,470
What are you eating?

155
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,360
Is there oil in curry or curry in oil?

156
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,640
I know! These caterers change,
but everything is same.

157
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,090
Then why don't you bring from home?

158
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,530
My parents have gone to the village.

159
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,230
How much time it takes
to make rice and lentil?

160
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,010
Why are you talking like my mother?

161
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,340
What's this made of?

162
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,490
Beetroot.

163
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,510
Good. It's really nice.

164
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,320
By the way, Ankita is very lucky.

165
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,490
Everything is set between
you two, right?

166
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,310
Indeed.

167
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,620
She gets help. And I love
cooking by the way.

168
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,890
I mean...

169
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,580
You cook because it's your hobby,
not because you want to help her.

170
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,970
That's what you're saying.

171
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,400
Hey. Give it back.

172
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,440
Keep it.
- I was eating!

173
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,500
When your Hardik won't help you after
marriage, then you'll understand.

174
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,760
Put it back. Eat your oily curry.

175
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,440
If you liked it so much, then why
don't you learn from me?

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,700
Yeah, sure.

177
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,430
Good evening, sir.

178
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,740
Sir, there are three patients.
Will you check them? I have some work.

179
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,360
Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

180
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,580
What?
- Sorry!

181
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,190
Come here.

182
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,800
Good day?
- Yes.

183
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,010
Let's go?

184
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,960
The apron?

185
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,350
Oh, yes. The apron!

186
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,800
Can you just...
- Yeah.

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.

188
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,300
Let's go?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,230
What are you looking for?

190
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,810
I'm not looking for a spot.

191
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,590
A new cafe has just opened.
They serve good coffee.

192
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
Let's go there, okay?

193
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,850
Okay.

194
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,350
Hey, Nikunj.

195
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,060
Park your car elsewhere.
This is my parking spot.

196
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,240
It's a pain to park my car inside.

197
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,820
Your small car will fit inside.
- Right.

198
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,000
But the thing is we generally don't
give parking to tenants.

199
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,860
I don't have problem. Other will have.

200
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,480
Who you ask?

201
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,930
Chairman.

202
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,830
That means me.

203
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,810
Your point is fair.
I'll raise it in the meeting.

204
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,730
But no one will attend the meeting.

205
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,930
You should get a Gujarat
passing for your car.

206
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,240
Coffee.
- Thank you.

207
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,670
Try it.
- Yeah.

208
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,430
Is it good?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,250
Grandma is getting angry at you.

210
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,130
That the girl has become so busy,
she doesn't even meet.

211
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,050
I know. The renovation
is still going on.

212
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,410
I think I should redo my room once.

213
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,010
But why? I like it.

214
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,740
There should be some
change after wedding.

215
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Okay.

216
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,840
Sugar is a bit less, right?

217
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,370
No, I found it perfect.

218
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,010
Listen...
- Yeah?

219
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,920
What happened to your
Bangalore fellowship?

220
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,130
That got over a long time ago.
It's not happening. I told you about it.

221
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,990
How come you recalled it suddenly?

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,030
No, I had got a call from
Bangalore, that's why.

223
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,980
Remember I had talked to
Alpa's company? They called me.

224
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,530
The pay is good.
- So?

225
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,050
I think I should join them.

226
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,440
Okay.

227
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Go ahead.

228
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,100
Then what will I do over there?

229
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,340
I'll have to start looking for the job, right?

230
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,760
Shreya, we talked about it.

231
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,400
That if the fellowship worked out,

232
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,710
we will think about it.
But it's not happening.

233
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,420
Why are you still trying?

234
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,230
I'm not trying, they approached
me on their own.

235
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,890
Then you should have refused.
You should have said no.

236
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,820
Dad has a clinic here and I would leave that

237
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
and come to Bangalore to apply for jobs?

238
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,540
For us, it's not like you IT people.

239
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,790
Go to Hyderabad from
Bangalore, then jump to Pune...

240
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,680
No set life at all.

241
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,540
You know, nowadays all IT people
try to come back to Gujarat only.

242
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,620
Look at your friend Nikunj.
He also came back.

243
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,090
If Ahmedabad is best for me,
why should I leave it?

244
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,400
But I can't see my growth in Ahmedabad.

245
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,880
I feel like I'm stuck here.
I've been lagging behind.

246
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,020
That means career growth is everything?
- When did I say that?

247
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,440
You mean that only.

248
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,400
That is what you meant.

249
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,180
Parents are here, grandma is here...

250
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,940
There are no responsibilities
of the house on you.

251
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,460
No responsibilities will
be given to you.

252
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,750
And you know it, right?

253
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,200
It was a struggle to convince
my parents about you.

254
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,990
I don't know... If such a topic arises
again and discussion happens then...

255
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,320
You decide. It's your call.

256
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,920
Let's go. I've to give injection
to grandma. Let's go.

257
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,470
What are you thinking, Shreya?
Sit in the car.

258
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,280
Let's go.

259
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,850
Mr. Arpit has a lot of attitude.

260
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,310
Entire society knows it.

261
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,370
That's why I'm telling you to look for a
good scheme and buy a new house.

262
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,220
We'll leave the society just
because of one man?

263
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,880
I don't mean that. But you do have
so many parking problems.

264
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,710
Look at this house. If we want to buy
anything and set it, there's no place.

265
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,710
If we have our own house, we can
do something on our own.

266
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,780
Wait a minute. Did you call the broker?

267
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,150
How many times do I need to remind you?

268
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,940
You know that if we don't sell the Hyderabad
house, we won't be able to buy one here.

269
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,720
You again left your socks here.

270
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,150
If you keep forgetting,
I'll remind you tomorrow.

271
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,040
I did call him; he didn't pick up.

272
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,690
Fine. But do call him once tomorrow.

273
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,720
Wow. What a timing!

274
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,080
What?

275
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,790
It's oil, right?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,130
Apply it on my hair too.

277
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,330
How was your day?
- Too hectic.

278
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Why? You had a lot of work?
- Yeah.

279
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,530
Oh God.

280
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,950
Don't you think this wall is too empty?
You should make something for this.

281
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,070
We'll do it when we buy a new house.

282
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,740
Why do you always bring
the topic of new house?

283
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,980
Huh? Obviously.

284
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,150
Shreya, I don't want to force you.

285
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,060
If you feel you should go
to Bangalore, you can go.

286
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,290
But I don't think I can
shift to Bangalore.

287
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,700
You just think about it once.

288
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,560
We'll have to live away from each other
for two years right after marriage...

289
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,440
Long distance relationship.

290
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,330
We fight so much on Whatsapp only.

291
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,710
And... Forget all that...

292
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,770
Will you like it without me?

293
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,810
Listen. You're tired. You need
sleep. Get some rest.

294
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,750
Good morning.

295
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,340
Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,940
Ankita...
- Yeah?

297
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,890
Have your recap papers come?

298
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,590
No. They just gave the worksheet today.

299
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,970
New book?
- Yeah.

300
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,670
You should read it.

301
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,140
My God!

302
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,390
You remember I told you about my
friend who got divorced recently?

303
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,210
Her ex-husband got married again.

304
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,640
You're still in touch with him?

305
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,060
No, but he's in
my Facebook friend-list.

306
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,540
Okay.

307
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,180
Seriously...

308
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,550
People do everything so quickly.

309
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,520
I mean, they don't take time
in switching relationships.

310
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,040
I know.

311
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,920
By the way, why did they get divorce?

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,370
Her mother-in-law.

313
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,840
She interfered a lot in her life.

314
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,210
'Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing that?'

315
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,890
'Why are you keeping the house like this?
Why are the curtains like this?'

316
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,350
'Why have you kept a cook?'

317
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,850
Seriously? It's their life,
both have jobs.

318
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,580
They'll handle it on their own, right?

319
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,260
Actually, parents nowadays
don't understand only.

320
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,620
That they're breaking their
son's marriage on their own.

321
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,250
Exactly.

322
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,520
Does your mother-in-law do the
same thing? - No, she's very cool.

323
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,580
Good morning, ma'am.
You have proxy in our class.

324
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,450
Okay. I'll be there in five minutes.
- Thank you.

325
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,150
What were you saying?

326
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,160
My mother-in-law is very cool.
Just like Nikunj.

327
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,560
We tell her to come and live together.
But she doesn't come.

328
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,540
You mean she doesn't tell you
anything? - No, nothing at all.

329
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,510
Wow. Not even about kids?

330
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,840
Never.

331
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,040
In fact, when we go home, my mom always
asks me when I am planning to have one.

332
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,930
But my mother-in-law? Never.

333
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,220
When are you planning?

334
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,210
Bye. See you after this.
- Yeah, see you.

335
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,010
Listen.
- Yeah?

336
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,440
Do you want to invest in the
plan suggested by Mr. Paresh?

337
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,550
I don't know. It's up to you.

338
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,160
He's calling so many times!
It's troubling me a lot.

339
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,190
You only talk to him.

340
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,780
Yes, but you think about it at least.

341
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,670
What's there to think? Say yes already.

342
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,060
Last time when we thought about it,
a laptop costing 60 thousand was bought.

343
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,590
It's not a laptop. It's a MacBook.

344
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,390
Whatever. It's better than
wasting money at least.

345
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,670
And why do you need
to ask her for that?

346
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,210
But it's her money, how can
I use it just like that?

347
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,990
You always give up when
it's about her, right?

348
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,100
Why don't you give a final answer?
So that this discussion ends.

349
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,430
I'm having to hear all this.

350
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,340
It's done now.

351
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,880
Yes, Mr. Srinivas. Now you've got time?

352
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,580
I had gone to Mallikarjuna
that's why I couldn't call you.

353
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,150
No, it's alright.

354
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,370
Rajshekhar Sir has liked it, their
family is yet to see the plot.

355
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,660
What's the problem?
Show it to them. Get it done.

356
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
You don't worry. It will be done.

357
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,750
Okay, whatever you do,
do it quickly, please.

358
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,440
Yes, it will be done in a few days.

359
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,220
Yes. Okay.

360
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,560
Daddy!
- Coming, dear.

361
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,570
Wow! Come in.

362
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,030
How are you?
- I'm doing great.

363
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,960
How are you?
- Come in, Nikunj Kumar.

364
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,320
'Arjun Ki Aag - Power of Punch.'

365
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,820
You love South movies so much!

366
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,690
Ask him how many times
he saw Sooryavansham.

367
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,630
What else can I do for passing time?

368
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,200
Wherever you see it from, you
can't understand these films.

369
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,200
Yes, the action is fantastic!

370
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,630
They throw their goggles
to the right and left...

371
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,090
How are you?
- Come, dear.

372
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,760
Everything's ready? Do you
need my help? - Not at all.

373
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,730
What have you made?
- Look.

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,330
You made his favourite items.
What about me?

375
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,470
I've made something for
you too. Gulab Jamun.

376
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,340
Then it's fine.
- Take it.

377
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,300
The dress is pretty.
- Really?

378
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,910
I bought it from a sale.

379
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,950
I got it stitched recently.
I'll bring one for you too.

380
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,030
You tell me which one you like.

381
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,730
He has said the proper rate.

382
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,380
The rate includes discount.

383
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,050
If you want, I can call again.
- No, no.

384
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,340
It's not in the budget. Why should we?

385
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,900
Ankita is not listening that's why.

386
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,440
As for me, I liked the old property.

387
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,140
Why should we use the used toilets?

388
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,950
We can get it repaired later, right?

389
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,810
Sometimes that turns out to be costlier.

390
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,480
Why do we need to do it?

391
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,490
There are mixed public in the
gated community scheme, dear.

392
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,530
What's wrong in that?

393
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,560
What are you saying, dad?

394
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,640
Oh, you too.

395
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,080
Nikunj!

396
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,960
Don't worry about the
budget while buying flat.

397
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,410
We are there if you need money.

398
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,550
Yes, I'll ask you only, okay?

399
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,180
You should stop frying papad and
microwave them instead.

400
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,030
But it won't have the same taste.

401
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,300
But it will be healthier.

402
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,800
You had told me last time that you
roasted peanuts in microwave.

403
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,100
Because of those peanuts he
has got gastric problems.

404
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,820
Why are you bent on controlling him?

405
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,110
Let him enjoy.

406
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,090
Mom, what is it that you have removed?

407
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,830
Yes, dear. I brought it
down from the attic.

408
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,110
You tell me what to keep
and what to discard.

409
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah, alright.

410
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,370
Now you remembered to call me?

411
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,650
What happened?

412
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,550
You forgot?

413
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,050
Vishal just called me.

414
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,550
How did Vishal come here?
Today's my birthday!

415
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,010
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

416
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,040
I thought it was on the next Saturday.

417
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,790
That's why I've hidden the
notification on Facebook.

418
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,550
Alright, have fun today. From tomorrow,
we're back to the same routine.

419
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,860
Sunday? But why?

420
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,960
I don't know. I have to
add some new feature.

421
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,000
They always bring something
or the other. Let's see.

422
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,110
Yes. We'll see.

423
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,560
Where are you now?

424
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,580
I'm managing the household
matters. I'm not free like you.

425
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,020
I'm not free. I'm with Hardik.
We're going for dinner this evening.

426
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,910
Oh, really? But you should not go for
dinners alone. You should give party.

427
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,350
Why don't you guys join us?

428
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,510
No, no. I'm not coming.
I'm going home. You guys enjoy.

429
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,410
No, really. Bring Ankita along.
Come, join us.

430
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,550
No.

431
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,290
Come on now.

432
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,800
Listen to me... Listen... - I'm sending you
the location. You'll have to come.

433
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,420
She's crazy.
- What happened?

434
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,220
It's her birthday today.
She's calling for dinner.

435
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,230
Why did you include them in our plan?

436
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,200
He called because of some
work. So I invited him.

437
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,780
You have invited them, so you
only go. I'm not coming.

438
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,480
Why are you sulking?
- Listen...

439
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,600
I did so many adjustments to
make time for you.

440
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,350
For us.
- Yes, that's what.

441
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,380
Come on. Now I can't refuse.

442
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,820
Hey...
- Fine. Now don't look at me like that.

443
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,440
Send him the location.
We're going to Eulogia.

444
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,610
You can swipe right for the camera.

445
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,770
Swipe right.
- Okay.

446
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,470
Why are you clicking a selfie?
- Let me, please.

447
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,920
But it's not a right time
to click a selfie.

448
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,140
Hello.

449
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,490
Hi. - Happy birthday.
- Thank you!

450
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,270
Many, many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you so much!

451
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,130
Hardik. - Hi. Nikunj.
- Hi. - We meet at last. - Yeah.

452
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,580
Ankita, right?
- Yeah. Hi.

453
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,720
Birthday gift? Wow.

454
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,880
So let's go?
- Yeah, please. Let's go.

455
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,680
Where should we sit?
- Let's go there. - Sure.

456
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,860
The food is really good here.
I like it. - Is it? - Yeah.

457
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,470
So I think you should place the order.

458
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,150
Sure. - Yeah.
- Excuse me.

459
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,460
No, please. Give it to him.

460
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
Thank you.

461
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,850
Okay, tell us.

462
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,110
Caramelised onion bruschetta?

463
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,870
They'll find it sweet. - No, they serve
black pepper with it as well.

464
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,360
It's like regular Italian bruschetta, but it has
caramelised onions instead of tomatoes.

465
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,290
And goat cheese. You'll like it.

466
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,530
Yes, I'm okay with anything.
Ask the birthday girl.

467
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,650
Whatever the chef says.

468
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,390
Alright. Anything else?

469
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,930
Kung Pao potato.
- Okay.

470
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,080
One Kung Pao potato and one
caramelised onion bruschetta.

471
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,180
Hardik, keep your phone aside.
They'll find it wrong.

472
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,270
Rest we'll give it later.

473
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,660
You said that they were fine with it.
- Yeah, but...

474
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,030
Hey, you don't mind, right?
I just want to check some messages.

475
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,810
I do mind a lot.

476
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm just joking. You can use it.
Please go ahead.

477
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,600
Thank you.

478
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,310
Actually he gets bored while
talking about food.

479
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,090
I get confused when I see the menu.
It's not my department. I can't do it.

480
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,390
But you must have some
choice in food at least.

481
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,380
What do you mean? Choice in food?

482
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,040
You must be finding some
item tastier than others.

483
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,730
What's there to choose in food?

484
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,900
Just like you fuel a car with petrol,
similarly food is a source of energy.

485
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,680
How come there is choice in food?

486
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,050
Actually, even I'm like that.
I don't know how to cook.

487
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,650
I can't cook anything at all.

488
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,810
Great. It's a perfect match.

489
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,340
Nikunj.

490
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,500
Actually, even I can cook
very less things.

491
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,840
But you're very lucky.
He loves to cook.

492
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,030
She is.

493
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,460
Yeah. Ask me.

494
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,410
He does all his experiments on me only.

495
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,100
It's a stressbuster for me. Coming home
from office after a long day...

496
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,040
And when you cook, you feel relaxed.

497
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,930
It's like me-time for me.

498
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,190
For me, cooking time
is a waste of time.

499
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,620
I mean those who like to cook
can be appointed as cooks.

500
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,060
Why should we waste our time? We should
focus on other important things.

501
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,720
Right.
- Yeah. Ask me.

502
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,300
No?
- Yeah. But that makes you animal.

503
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,280
I mean...

504
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,890
Cooking is the only thing that
differentiates man from animals.

505
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,570
Remember, we're all apes.

506
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,330
You see, cooking led to the
growth of human brain.

507
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,010
Even Darwin has said
that cooking and language;

508
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,960
these two are important
achievements of humans.

509
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,800
Nikunj, please.
- Hey.

510
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,810
Sorry, he gets excited when he talks
about cooking. - No, let him speak.

511
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,190
It feels I'm watching
Discovery Channel.

512
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,270
No, I think this is pretty interesting.

513
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,500
And I had never thought about that.

514
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,440
What's there to think? It's so simple.

515
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,610
Actually, he's just a preacher.

516
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,410
Whenever we go out,
he always orders salads.

517
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,490
Now that's wrong.

518
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,320
You two are here today that's why
he ordered starter. - Oh, come on.

519
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,000
I always give you options.
You only take the healthy option.

520
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,290
Okay, okay. Fine.

521
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,530
Let's change the topic now?
- Yeah.

522
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,080
Thank you.

523
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,320
So, doctor.
- Yeah?

524
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,520
You always wanted to be a doctor?

525
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,770
No, I wasn’t sure, but dad was
very clear about me becoming a doctor.

526
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,640
So I became a doctor.

527
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,600
What happened to your Europe trip?

528
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,240
We're waiting for summers.

529
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,390
We can only go when she gets
vacation from school. - Yeah.

530
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,980
I love art, history and museums.

531
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,380
Actually, I've read a lot.

532
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,160
But it's a different thing of going there
and experiencing it yourself.

533
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,190
I love that kind of stuff.

534
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,660
And I'll explore food.

535
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,760
Travelling is food and people for me.

536
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,980
If you ask me, it's all about
hill stations. I love mountains a lot.

537
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,640
For him, it's the oceans.
He loves beaches.

538
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,840
Ocean and beer, what else do you
want? Life is set. - Perfect match.

539
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,370
By the way, where will you
go for a trip after marriage?

540
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,470
We were thinking Phuket or Bali.

541
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,740
Nice.

542
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,190
Depends. Only if he gets time.
- Yeah.

543
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,660
Nowadays late honeymoons
have become a trend.

544
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,900
We had gone on time.

545
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,290
But I tell you what, you should
not take a package deal.

546
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,540
Plan it on your own. It'll be fun.

547
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,430
Yeah. We'll think about it.

548
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,350
How is it? - It's really good.
- Yeah? - Yes. It's good.

549
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,510
Let's order the main course as well.
- Yeah.

550
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,870
Yeah?

551
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
Let him come.

552
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,740
Ma'am, excuse me...

553
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,910
Happy birthday, ma'am.
- Thank you.

554
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,760
Cake-cutting time!

555
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,400
You left the window open again.

556
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,010
No one except mosquitos entered
your house. - Yeah.

557
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,170
This Shreya is nonstop, right?

558
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,420
She says whatever that comes to her
mind. But she's innocent, you know.

559
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,430
But I found Hardik too dominating.

560
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,240
There is a dominating person
in every relationship.

561
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,990
Exactly. Just like how you do
what you feel like. - Yeah, right.

562
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,420
Nikunj.

563
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,460
Why do you mind taking
money from my parents?

564
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,240
How did this come here?

565
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,560
Whenever I try to talk, you neglect it.

566
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,380
We'll get a house in our
budget. Don't worry.

567
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,680
We saw so many.
Did we like any of them?

568
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,610
We'll have to search a bit,
but we'll get it.

569
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,420
Why do we need to search?

570
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,300
This could be the last property
we're going to buy.

571
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,900
Then it should be the best.

572
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Even if we have to change our budget.

573
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,740
What's the problem in taking
money from family?

574
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,340
I do have a problem.

575
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,150
Don't you know about my dad and uncle?

576
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,420
Dad couldn't repay him in time and
that's why their relation got spoiled.

577
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,140
So many years after dad passed away,
Mom and her brother have come together.

578
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,780
My parents are not like that.

579
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,250
I don't want to take money
from family. That's it.

580
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,850
Nikunj.

581
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,670
Shreya?

582
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,810
Did you talk to Hardik Kumar?
- I'm getting late right now, mom.

583
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,510
Just listen to me for two minutes
then do what you want to.

584
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,900
Mom, do you want to talk
about all this in morning?

585
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,770
Then when should I talk?
You're out of home all day.

586
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,460
In the evening, you sit in your room
with your laptop. When should I talk?

587
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,820
Mom, you said so much, instead if you had told
what you wanted to, it would have been over.

588
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
They will bring 500 people
as wedding guests.

589
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,130
Wedding is going to happen nicely.

590
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,790
But this is too much.

591
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,170
And one more day for the ring ceremony,
that means another function. - Oh God.

592
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,020
Mom, you have his number, right?

593
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,690
You call him and meet him. Get it done.

594
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,680
You're talking as if you don't have
anything to do with the wedding.

595
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,010
Look, you talk to him today,
tomorrow I'll talk to Hardik.

596
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,070
But I'm really getting late.
I'll have to leave.

597
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,520
It's a very important presentation.
- Only I'm worried about the wedding.

598
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,510
You're not worried, you're in haste.

599
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,010
Bye.

600
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,070
You check it once, else
Vishal will get angry.

601
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,550
Premal.
- Sir, he's Mr. Vishal.

602
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,420
So, this is the office, sir.
- Yeah. Nice place.

603
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,030
How was your flight?
- Very good. - Yeah, please.

604
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,260
Please, sir.

605
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,610
You've checked it, right?

606
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,910
Please, please. Hi.

607
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,470
So, this is the team, sir.
- Okay.

608
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,630
This is Nikunj, Shreya,
Bhakti and Ravi.

609
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,410
Are we ready? - Yeah, please.
- Should I start?

610
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,660
And you tap on this icon.

611
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,130
And it shows immediately.

612
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,960
This is how easy it is basically.

613
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,050
And all this is in the cloud?

614
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,870
All this. Everything is on the cloud.

615
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,940
Right from field executives to their attendants,

616
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,000
everything is there on the cloud.

617
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,510
Oh, that's good. That's very good.

618
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,540
And such records are not there
if you're training new MRs.

619
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,140
Okay. - Right? For example, doctor
history, location history...

620
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,570
All of that is not there.
There is info about old MRs.

621
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,090
And whatever input is
required for sales...

622
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,680
...that is very slow. Because it
has to be done manually.

623
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,140
That is where FieldTrack
comes into play.

624
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,160
Okay. Good.

625
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,080
And, does it save data offline?

626
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,270
Yes, sir. We don't have it in this version,
but it will happen in the next version.

627
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,270
Next version.
- Yes.

628
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,020
Can I have a look at the app?
- Yeah, sure.

629
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Battery consumption is very optimum.
- That's cool.

630
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,510
Unfortunately, FieldTrack MR stopped?
- What? Impossible. Wait a minute.

631
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,930
What happened?

632
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,940
Just a second.

633
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,200
Nikunj, can you...
- Yeah. Please let me help.

634
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,110
We'll give you the new
build in five minutes.

635
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,680
Don't worry. It's fine.

636
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,200
Sir, we're also working for an iPhone
version, it will also be out soon.

637
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,710
I'm sure. iPhone, yes.
- That will come very soon.

638
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,990
We have what we needed.
I've got an idea. Don't worry.

639
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,450
Sanjay will get back to you. - Yes, I will.
- Thank you for your time everyone.

640
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,730
Mr. Sanjay.

641
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,990
Sanjay.

642
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,710
I had told you.

643
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,520
Sir is very particular
about everything.

644
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,670
I know... We...
- No issues. I'll get back to you.

645
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,250
Guys, guys, guys.

646
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,680
This was really, really embarrassing.

647
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,640
Not done, guys.

648
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,900
Nikunj, I had specifically told
you to test this flow.

649
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,480
Nikunj...

650
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,040
See you in my cabin.
In the next five minutes.

651
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,780
I know we've goofed up.

652
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,600
I know it's a blunder.

653
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,680
I'll do something. I'll talk to Sanjay
if we can get an appointment again.

654
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm not sure.

655
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,840
I'll call you back. He's here.

656
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,570
It was Mitesh.

657
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,820
Nikunj, we've goofed up.

658
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,400
This was a big opportunity wasted.

659
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
How could you miss out on
something like this? - I know.

660
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,730
I know it was a miss on my part.

661
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,810
But it's not entirely my fault.

662
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,250
There were so many changes
till the last moment.

663
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,730
How many times should
I check one single thing?

664
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,360
Nikunj, the coder is a junior engineer.

665
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
As a lead QA, you're the gatekeeper.

666
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,490
In that case, you should have checked
before giving the demo. - Oh.

667
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,610
So you want to play the blame game?
- I don't want to play the blame game.

668
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,180
The fact is, the job of a QA
is thankless. Seriously.

669
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,030
You very well know that I'm overloaded.

670
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,170
I'm handling multiple products
from last one year.

671
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,420
I brought everything on line in one year. I stayed
awake overnight, I've really worked hard.

672
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,300
Don't give me that.

673
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,170
Everybody has worked hard.

674
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,620
Everyone has put in efforts.
Not just you.

675
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,030
Because of your one single mistake,
we've lost this deal.

676
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,080
Ultimately, I'm answerable to this.

677
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,120
Next time, you should
set a proper timeline.

678
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,460
Work never happens in hurry.
At least I can't do it.

679
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,450
Only our company has made culture
like college submission.

680
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,300
Every company is different.

681
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,840
And it's like this only here. - You should
have told me this before hiring me.

682
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,760
Then I'm telling you right now.
On your face.

683
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,480
And I know you're expecting a hike.

684
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,590
But this will affect your
performance rating.

685
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,690
Are you serious?

686
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,170
I cannot help it.

687
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,940
In that case, I better quit.

688
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,320
I didn't mean that.
- But I mean that.

689
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,020
Seriously.

690
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,950
I'm done.

691
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Nikunj...

692
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,890
Sir, they're calling you in.

693
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,260
Hi, Nikunj.
- Hi.

694
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,380
Have a seat please.
- Thank you.

695
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,460
So... See, Nikunj, the feedback
of interview is positive.

696
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,720
But we won't be able to
give a high salary.

697
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,730
Well, I don't expect any hike on it, but if you
can just match up the current figures...

698
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,590
That is also high for this position.

699
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,190
I understand.

700
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,080
But there is a contract-based
opportunity in Norway, on-site.

701
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,390
And for that, you'll have to
sign a two-year contract.

702
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,150
Anyway. Thank you.

703
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,080
Where's the mock site folder? Tell me.

704
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,240
You want it or Vishal wants it?

705
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,960
Please tell me, it's important.

706
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,130
It's on Google drive, I'll
send you the details. - Okay.

707
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,550
You're really not coming back?

708
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,840
Listen, I've sent your CV,
they will email you.

709
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,290
Alright?
- Okay. Thanks.

710
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,460
Bye.

711
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,370
Bye.

712
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,750
You're from Hyderabad, right? You
shouldn't have come back from there.

713
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,380
I think it's a mistake.

714
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,000
I've already made that mistake.

715
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,160
That is the point, Nikunj. The local
companies here don't understand this.

716
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,760
That's why there is no position
of QA in companies here.

717
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,610
I don't think that you want
to get back to coding.

718
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,790
Do you really want to?
- Not at all.

719
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,080
Thanks.
- All the best to you.

720
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,160
Thanks.

721
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,060
Uncle, can I get anything other than…?

722
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,490
There is a fixed plate for lunch.

723
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,710
Is there oil curry or curry in oil?

724
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,920
This is what it is.

725
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,180
If you don't like it, leave it.

726
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,190
Why are you talking like this?

727
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,730
If you talk like this, no one will come
here. Your business won't function.

728
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,680
By 1:30 every table will be full.

729
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,150
People from all nearby
offices eat here only.

730
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,260
Pay 100 rupees.

731
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,320
100 rupees for this plate?

732
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,100
Not for the plate.
For the food in the plate.

733
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,930
You're not habitual
to outside food, right?

734
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,120
We eat here every day.

735
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,740
Listen, I'll keep only one delivery
boy and I'll cook from home.

736
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,000
There's no investment.

737
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,960
Seriously? You want to
start tiffin business?

738
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,440
Why are you seeing it that way?
It's our own business! See it like that!

739
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,360
I think staying at home has made
your mind has become blank.

740
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,740
You need to go out.

741
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,140
I went out and that's
how I got the idea.

742
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,990
Just imagine. Our own business.

743
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,430
This is the chance to get rid
of the 9 to 5 trap.

744
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,230
You know that I want to
do this because I like it.

745
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,050
Look at our age. If not now, then when?

746
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,030
Exactly. Exactly my point.
Look at our age.

747
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,990
You want to quit your white collar
job right now and do all this?

748
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,690
We had come here to settle down, right?

749
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,410
What about us? What about our plans?

750
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,710
What about them?

751
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,670
They won't get affected.
We just need more time.

752
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,800
Okay, you think I'm on
a sabbatical. That's it.

753
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,660
And if it doesn't work out, how long
will it take to get back to the job?

754
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,200
But I am sure that won't happen.
It will work out.

755
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,570
If you have decided everything,
why do you need to ask me?

756
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,770
See, I want you with me on this.

757
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,630
Look, if this doesn't work out,
you'll take the job.

758
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,000
Thank you.

759
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,530
What are you doing?
- I'm making a plane.

760
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,480
Nowadays such pamphlets are
not taken by scrap dealers also.

761
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,750
Then we need to change the tiles.

762
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,600
Pipeline needs to be changed.

763
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,220
There will be so many tensions.

764
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,170
Problems aren't less either.

765
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,470
Understood?

766
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,890
And this is the other problem.
The main problem.

767
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,360
When did you come?

768
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,560
Nikunj...

769
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,870
You've started a business?

770
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,330
So what?
- So what?

771
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,970
Lift is used 20 times a day!

772
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,600
So what is the problem? Don't the
guests use the lift when they visit us?

773
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,500
What do you mean
what is the problem?

774
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,280
Do you know about the
maintenance condition or not?

775
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,140
You don't even attend meetings.
- Why should I?

776
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,300
I'm a tenant.
- Then live like one.

777
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,610
What are you trying to say?
- What do you mean?

778
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,420
I had told you to think
before giving the flat.

779
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,130
Nice people live here.

780
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,740
Well-mannered people live here.

781
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,110
Hey!
- Vegetarians live here.

782
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,430
Then why don't you directly
come to the point?

783
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,200
I make non-veg in my
kitchen, not yours.

784
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,260
Why do you only have a problem?

785
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,840
It's not just me, everyone has problem.

786
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,800
And if you can't adjust,
then live elsewhere.

787
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,530
Why should I live elsewhere?
- But listen...

788
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,140
Wait, Mr. Arpit.

789
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,720
Look Nikunj. You are at fault.

790
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:09,200
It's illegal to start a commercial business in
the society without anyone's permission.

791
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,540
What's illegal in that? Everyone does
tiffin service in their society.

792
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,750
Do those freelancers who work
from home ask for permission?

793
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,000
You will have to take permission here.

794
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,060
I won't tolerate this bossiness.
- This isn't bossiness.

795
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,450
Wait a minute, Mr. Artik.

796
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:24,600
Nikunj, tell me in how many days
can you shift from here?

797
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,540
Are you seriously evicting
me from the house?

798
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,270
I'm not evicting you.

799
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,600
I'm asking you in how many days can
you shift your business from here?

800
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,220
I've just started.

801
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,250
I'll take 2 to 3 months.
- 15 days.

802
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,390
Only 15 days.
- You...

803
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,550
If he doesn't stop his business in
15 days, kick him out. - Mr. Arpit...

804
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,670
This is final.
- I'll talk to him.

805
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,490
I'll talk to him.

806
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,500
What will we do now?

807
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,590
I don't know.

808
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,660
I think you should take a job.

809
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,590
How did job come here?

810
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,920
Let me see who evicts me from here!

811
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,960
You can't do business like this.

812
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,000
Every society has their rules.
- So we'll leave the society.

813
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,410
We'll live elsewhere.

814
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,750
You know we cannot
afford that right now.

815
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,950
I'll take a place on rent.

816
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,620
I'll shift the kitchen there.
I'll operate from there.

817
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,440
Are you even listening to yourself?

818
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,320
It's not as easy as you think it is.

819
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,640
We'll have to spend so
much money for all this.

820
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,000
Our priority was a home and
family, what happened to that?

821
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,010
That will be our priority.

822
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,710
But you saw, right?

823
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,070
It was all set in such little time.
Orders had increased.

824
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,590
If I'm getting such good response,
don't you think I should try?

825
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,950
I should give it a full chance.

826
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,230
Your job is still going on.
So I can take risk.

827
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,370
I don't know.

828
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,430
I just hope you know what you're doing.

829
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,180
I know what I'm doing.

830
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,630
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

831
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,290
Yeah.

832
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,810
Come.

833
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,630
See it.

834
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,850
Many of the things will
be useful to you.

835
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,910
There is proper arrangement
of water here.

836
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,340
What was here before?

837
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,040
There was a tiffin business like
yours. It didn't work out.

838
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,330
I mean, not all will face this.

839
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,290
But you can use his items.

840
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,520
You'll just need to clean them.

841
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,100
They just left without taking anything?

842
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,650
Yeah. It's ours now.

843
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,250
Okay. Just talk to them.

844
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,090
Fine. I'll talk to them.

845
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,910
But I can't afford this much rent.

846
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,770
I'm there. I'll handle everything.

847
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,420
Don't worry.

848
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,730
Natu?
- Yeah.

849
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,730
What happened to those 6 veg
rolls? - They're almost ready.

850
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,060
And the full meal?

851
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,080
I delivered it in Ganesh.

852
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,490
It was Azad society's order.

853
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,030
Make Ganesh's now again.

854
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,710
You messed up.

855
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,950
4 regular plates.
- Okay.

856
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,380
Yeah, Shreya.

857
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,930
No I didn't see the message. Tell me.

858
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,580
I was busy that's why I didn't...

859
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,730
Shit!

860
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,330
Don't give the lentils.
Pack chapatis and veggies.

861
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,150
Why don't you buy a big monitor?

862
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,340
And buy one Mac.

863
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,920
Do all the billing in it.

864
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,930
And your Whatsapp will be on monitor.

865
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:29,050
You anyway get orders
on Whatsapp, right?

866
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:32,090
So my personal message will also
be visible on monitor?

867
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:35,510
Then buy a new sim!
What are you saying?

868
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,660
Just getting orders is not enough.
There should be an automatic reply.

869
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,610
Yeah.

870
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,450
You had made a Whatsapp bot
in Hack-athon, right?

871
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,120
Will that work?

872
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,340
Oh, yes. I can make that for you.

873
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,410
I'll do one thing, I'll fix item
number in menu.

874
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:01,500
Then the number will tell you the item name
and quantity both. - That won't work.

875
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,750
It doesn't work if menu gets
fixed. I can't experiment.

876
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:09,630
Then I'll have to check the screen all the time.
If anyone cancels the order, there will be a mistake.

877
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,950
That's true.

878
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,630
App will cost a lot, right?

879
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:29,090
Tell your Vishal to give
quotation for app.

880
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,420
Actually you're right.

881
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,660
I think we should make an app.

882
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,500
Even if it is basic.

883
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,750
But...

884
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,480
It's been too long now.

885
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,630
I haven't done any
exciting project like this.

886
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,400
And...

887
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,830
Don't worry, I won't take money.

888
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,390
Instead of that, why don't
you join me full-time?

889
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,560
Leaving my job?

890
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,050
Yeah. Seriously.

891
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:05,950
You're good at coding.

892
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,500
I'm good at cooking.

893
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,980
I'll handle kitchen,
logistic and investment.

894
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,830
You handle the technical side.

895
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,850
You will have full control
over the product.

896
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,070
Seriously think over it.

897
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,740
What will job give you?

898
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,610
You will become a manager
from an engineer, that's it.

899
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,990
Even if you work all your life, you will
never get control on the entire product.

900
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,520
You won't even need to go to Bangalore.

901
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,540
I think it's a good offer.

902
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,750
You should think about it.

903
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,710
Even I'll invest.

904
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,920
You'll work without salary,
that will be enough.

905
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:56,660
Okay. Then I'll have
full control on the app.

906
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,750
100 percent your control.
Don't worry about it.

907
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,780
Alright.

908
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,270
Then we'll set-up here.

909
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,220
We'll need 2 engineers,
designers and... - Wait a minute!

910
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,470
Let's plan this properly, alright?

911
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,390
Come.

912
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,840
So you're the CEO?

913
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,520
And I'm the CTO?

914
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,550
Great!

915
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,270
Give it.

916
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:29,250
I've told you 50 times.
You should taste it while making.

917
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,950
Salt is more in the lentils.
Go, get two bricks.

918
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,140
Mr. Baldev?

919
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,160
Mr. Baldev?
- Yes?

920
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,620
I'm Nikunj. I had called you, remember?

921
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,870
From?
- Healthy Delights.

922
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,940
Yes.

923
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,710
Tell me what is it?

924
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,270
Even I have a home food
delivery business.

925
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,300
So I am looking for a traditional cook.

926
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,240
Don't worry, the salt was more in lentils,
so I put the brick to soak it. Tell me.

927
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,780
I needed a cook.

928
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,600
Look, I can't manage entire day.

929
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,850
I'll come 7 to 9 in the morning,
and 6 to 8 in the evening.

930
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,340
Okay?

931
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,780
I'll make other things, but you'll have
to make chapatis yourself. Okay?

932
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,110
This is your address, right?
- Yeah.

933
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,760
Okay, I'll come then.

934
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,500
I said I'll come.

935
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,100
I will.

936
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,270
Did Shreya ask you anything?

937
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,830
She was saying that she wants to
quit the job and do some startup...

938
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,510
I told her to ask you.

939
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,370
Does Shreya ever ask?

940
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,910
Did she ask when she wanted
to marry Hardik?

941
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,590
She just informed us.

942
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:19,640
Right. The wedding is close and
she wants to do a startup.

943
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,010
But you said no, right?
- Yeah.

944
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,010
No, I mean...

945
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,600
That means you gave her money.
- No!

946
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,890
She will use her savings.

947
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:34,790
When this girl sees money,
she finds out ways to spend it.

948
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,110
Let her spend.

949
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,200
If anything happens, we're there.

950
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,090
Let her talk to Hardik first.

951
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,570
Yeah. Hardik doesn't give
her any attention at all.

952
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,960
That means you'll spend your savings?

953
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,130
I'll invest it. It's a
matter of some days.

954
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,980
Then why should I wait
for 3 months for this?

955
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,260
But till then you'll get time
to settle in the clinic.

956
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,120
And your NRI friends can
also attend the wedding.

957
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,050
You talk at home.

958
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,990
This is about home! If it works out, we
will be able to buy a bigger house.

959
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,520
And I'm sure it will work out.

960
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,150
It won't work out.

961
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,900
I don't think mom and dad will listen.

962
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,790
And let Nikunj do whatever he wants.
Why are you following him?

963
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,830
If Shreya loses anything,
we will be responsible.

964
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,120
Why will we be responsible?
She can take her own decision.

965
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,360
I've taken this decision
after thinking a lot.

966
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,390
And I'm not talking about
leaving Ahmedabad.

967
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,150
I don't know.

968
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,780
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

969
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,980
Don't worry.

970
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,750
Please try.

971
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,250
Fine.

972
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,280
Don't make a face. I'll talk to them.

973
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,260
Okay.

974
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,530
See this.

975
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,910
I had mailed this in the morning.
Why isn't it done yet?

976
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,090
We'll work overnight. Okay?
- Yeah.

977
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,570
Nikunj, I want to talk.

978
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,580
Thank you.

979
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,600
The app is almost done.

980
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,820
Finally.

981
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,350
Now listen, the plan goes
something like this...

982
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,180
During the app launch, we'll
target 6 to 7 areas, okay?

983
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,500
We'll need 4 delivery boys and 4 bikes.

984
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,550
2 people for call support.

985
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,310
And when we expand...

986
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:46,550
I mean, after 10 franchises...

987
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,840
Then all the tech will be
handled from here.

988
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,010
And don't worry, main kitchen
and recipes will be yours only.

989
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,760
But don't you think all
this is large-scaled?

990
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
Yes, so?
- So what?

991
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,330
Let's start small.

992
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:01,570
If we invest all the money, what
will we earn? - Even I'm investing.

993
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,320
Right now we'll invest, then
we'll pitch it to some investors...

994
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,340
No, no... Let's keep it very
small and simple.

995
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:13,340
Then why did you make such a big app?
You should have done it through Whatsapp.

996
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,490
Nikunj. You're nervous right now.

997
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,860
Think about it.

998
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,240
This is going to be really big.

999
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,860
Our app can take millions of
orders, you know that?

1000
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,120
We can't let this go.

1001
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:37,990
What?

1002
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,940
Done. Then decide what scooter
we should buy. Okay?

1003
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Hey!

1004
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,430
Mausam...
- Yeah?

1005
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,320
Show the order list interface is done?

1006
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,610
It will be done in 2-3 days.

1007
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,970
No, Mausam, we'll have
to complete it today.

1008
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:00,120
We don't have time.
- Okay.

1009
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,910
Hello.
- What's up? What's going on, madam?

1010
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,240
I have a lot of work. I'm burdened.

1011
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,760
What time should I pick
you up tomorrow?

1012
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,850
One minute.

1013
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,770
Listen... Is it okay if
I don't come tomorrow?

1014
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,170
You know everyone from my uncle's side
has come. They've come from US.

1015
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,790
They made the plan to meet you.
You know that, right?

1016
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:36,430
Yes, but I'll come to meet
them on Sunday.

1017
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,910
And the app launch date is also close.

1018
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,790
Please understand.
There is a lot of work.

1019
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:44,280
You're talking as if it's
a medical emergency.

1020
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,920
When did I say this?

1021
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,790
Fine. You do what you feel like.
I'm hanging up. Bye.

1022
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:06,570
Uncle! It's a new t-shirt.
Don't spoil it.

1023
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:09,980
Get that coriander powder;
it's finished. Go.

1024
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,770
Okay, Neel?

1025
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,220
Bring it.

1026
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,420
How much for this?
- This is 16.

1027
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,520
Hi.

1028
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,490
Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:31,810
Hi.

1030
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:34,830
I'll be back.

1031
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,130
We're ready for launch.

1032
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:40,240
Really?
- Yes.

1033
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,330
Okay, everyone! Launch time!

1034
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,660
What will we do of this?

1035
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,130
Launch means opening, right?

1036
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,390
Yeah. Opening. We're doing it.

1037
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:56,660
Come on everyone.

1038
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,910
Should I press enter?

1039
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,990
Yes!

1040
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,700
Okay.

1041
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,080
One... Two...
- One minute.

1042
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,720
Don't you think 50 percent discount
is too much? Let's decrease it a bit.

1043
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,270
We'll have to do it, alright? Done!

1044
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,630
Let's get to work everyone!

1045
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:24,500
Aren't we supposed to make sweets?

1046
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,390
Yeah, make it for everyone.

1047
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:30,330
Hi, Shreya.
- Hi.

1048
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,020
Welcome.

1049
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,410
Hi. I'm Kriti. - I'm Nikunj.
- Please come.

1050
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,770
So your server stack is in Python?
- No, Java Spring Boot.

1051
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,210
That's what the team is
comfortable with, so...

1052
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,560
Okay. Can I see the app?

1053
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,640
Yes, sure.

1054
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:49,830
Thanks.

1055
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,830
Okay, so what are you guys looking at?

1056
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,960
As in?

1057
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:03,620
As in, money. How much
investment would you need?

1058
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,140
We're thinking 1 million should
be ideal to start with.

1059
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:12,320
Wow. And what do you expect
to achieve from 1 million?

1060
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,720
1 thousand orders per day almost.

1061
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,300
Just from one center?

1062
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,630
Isn't that outrageous?
Thousand orders per day?

1063
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,020
We'll expand it I mean.

1064
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,730
What's the team size then?
- We're 9 of us.

1065
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:35,610
9... So with that kind of a team size, you're
expecting thousand orders a day?

1066
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:40,060
So when the orders increase, we'll
increase the team size as well.

1067
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:45,040
Okay. Send us the detailed proposal
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

1068
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,340
I don't think they'll call us.

1069
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:51,240
I think they're finding
1 million too much.

1070
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,430
Chill. Why are you getting
so dissapointed?

1071
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,340
We've just started. We are
yet to meet many such people.

1072
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,710
It's okay.

1073
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:22,050
We'll have to rework the prices.
- Wait a minute. We'll do it later.

1074
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,270
You just send them the
presentation first.

1075
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:31,960
Hello? Yes, Mr. Srinivas...

1076
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,640
Sir, now Rajshekhar sir is refusing.

1077
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,440
Why?

1078
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,190
His son has come to see it.

1079
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:36,970
What?

1080
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,400
He's finding the price too high.

1081
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,560
But how?

1082
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,860
Sir, we'll have to reduce the price.

1083
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,680
They were going to send
payment this week, right?

1084
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,490
I have booked a house
here because of them.

1085
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:47,460
Sir, the situation was different earlier, now
everything is changed because of Telangana.

1086
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,710
What happened all of a sudden?
Should I talk to them?

1087
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,380
Sir, his son is finding
the price too high.

1088
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,790
Okay, so suddenly he's finding the price
too high? - We'll have to reduce it.

1089
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:56,390
How much?

1090
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,460
If we want to sell it, we'll
have to decrease 10-15.

1091
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,910
10-15 is a huge amount.
What are you saying?

1092
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:04,470
Sir, this party is lost if we
don't reduce the price.

1093
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,580
But... - The entire area's
prices have fallen.

1094
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,650
Suddenly entire area's prices
have fallen? What nonsense!

1095
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,240
Sir, the rate which you're
saying won't work.

1096
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,500
See how much you can decrease.

1097
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,350
I'll try my level best.

1098
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,130
I'll see if I find some other buyer.

1099
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,170
Fine. Okay.
- Talk to you later.

1100
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,300
What happened, Nikunj?

1101
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,730
The deal of the Hyderabad
house got cancelled.

1102
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:42,800
Such things do happen in
property matters. It's okay.

1103
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,540
Ankita will be dissapointed. Big time.

1104
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,210
Talk to her once.
I'm sure she'll understand.

1105
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:03,440
Nice.

1106
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,090
But won't it get cold while delivering?

1107
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:09,040
Not at all. It's very quick.
- Really?

1108
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:09,930
That's the point.

1109
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,220
Thank you very much for your time.

1110
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,910
Do you cook the food?

1111
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,120
No...
- I cook it. I'm the chef.

1112
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,080
Oh. So you're the chef. Right.

1113
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:24,160
But don't you think nowadays the
outside food quality is very bad?

1114
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:30,010
It was good until there were
stalls and food shops.

1115
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,370
But those delivery apps
entered the market.

1116
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:35,900
There's nothing good left I would say.

1117
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,710
How about party orders?

1118
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,010
That's not the part of our
business model yet. - Yes.

1119
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,260
How's it different then?

1120
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,800
The food itself is unique.

1121
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,810
That's why we are selling
healthy food. - What?

1122
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,700
Healthy food.
- Oh!

1123
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,210
Healthy food?

1124
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:55,300
But technically it's
still outside food.

1125
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,730
Home cooked food is different
and outside food is different.

1126
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,200
Do you think it's scalable?

1127
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:05,580
When you don't have the volume,
how can you expand it fast?

1128
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,620
Sir, we're trying to take it slow as of yet and
maybe in the next phase we'll think about it.

1129
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,280
What if we start from Mumbai?

1130
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,080
It's difficult to make
profit in small city.

1131
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:18,230
What do you say?

1132
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,970
No, uncle...
- Uncle?

1133
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:24,060
Sir, I mean, our setup is here,
so Mumbai will be far for us.

1134
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,170
Then make app for
our plastic materials.

1135
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,210
Will you?

1136
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,820
I'll pay you for that.

1137
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:35,450
We can make the application, sir. I'll give
you a reference who can make one.

1138
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,180
So you won't make it, right?

1139
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,800
Sir, our product is different, so...

1140
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,120
How about home-cooked food?

1141
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,550
Sorry, we didn't get you.

1142
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,520
We'll take Gujarati aunties on board.

1143
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,690
Whoever wants to order,
can order from anywhere.

1144
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:57,570
So you'll get into logistics?

1145
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,600
Believe me, I'll tell
you my experience.

1146
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,510
Don't get into logistics.

1147
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,250
Yes, if you have any
other work, I can help you.

1148
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,860
No, thank you.

1149
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,530
Sir, I think you're talking
about two different models.

1150
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,550
Can you convert my black money into white?
I can give you as much as you want.

1151
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:21,030
So, we're operating in these 6 areas.

1152
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,940
The kitchen is centralised.
I handle it myself.

1153
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,700
The quality control is in our hands.

1154
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,010
I cook on my own.

1155
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:29,000
We have 3 delivery boys,
they manage all these areas.

1156
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,060
The interesting part is...

1157
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,040
There are many apps like this in
Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore.

1158
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,780
There's no app in our city.

1159
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:39,030
Okay. - And especially, there's no
app which supplies healthy food.

1160
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,200
So we'll have the first advantage.

1161
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,590
That's it.
- Okay.

1162
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,800
Do you have late night orders?

1163
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,760
I mean, we do take orders till 10 PM.

1164
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,170
Not 10. I mean after 12.

1165
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,550
Do that!

1166
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,940
It has a very wide scope.
See I'll tell you what happens.

1167
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:02,870
People like me who party, drink and play
poker till late night; we can't go out, right?

1168
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:06,810
What if someone can deliver
orders at home?

1169
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,870
Nothing like that!
And we can have offers.

1170
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,920
Like, snacks combo... We can
have soda with cheese cube.

1171
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,360
Like that.
- All this is not possible.

1172
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,450
But maybe after we expand...

1173
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,520
Then we can operate 24x7.

1174
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,450
Okay. Done.

1175
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,260
Sure?
- Yeah. Sure.

1176
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,200
Mr. Harshad will get convinced?
- Yeah.

1177
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,740
Mr. Harshad has only told me.

1178
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:37,280
When I talked to dad yesterday, he told me to leave
his business and and do something of my own.

1179
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,280
This is new.

1180
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:44,310
Okay. So do you want
to know anything else?

1181
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:48,030
I'll give you a 10 percent
cheque right now.

1182
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:53,710
This is the advance. And the rest 90 percent will
be given in instalments when dad comes back.

1183
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,800
Wow. Thank you.

1184
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,060
Thank you.

1185
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,570
I mean I was positive, but I didn't know he
would give the cheque today itself.

1186
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,260
I was skeptical till the end.
And he started with a bang.

1187
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,830
Midnight meal after 12!

1188
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,600
I thought he would tell us
to do online bootlegging.

1189
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,550
Not a bad idea actually.
- Yeah, right.

1190
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,880
So we're done. What now?

1191
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,290
What now?

1192
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,170
We'll increase the promo code validity.
- No, not that.

1193
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,620
I think we should take a break.
- What break?

1194
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,530
The work has just begun!
It will increase now.

1195
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:35,020
Listen, I will have to take a break.

1196
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,120
And Hardik is also angry at me.

1197
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,310
And I feel even you need one.
- Yeah.

1198
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,180
Who will handle the kitchen
if I take a break? - They're there!

1199
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,900
Actually Ankita is also mad at me.

1200
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,680
Our Italy plan hasn't worked out.

1201
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,070
See.

1202
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:59,120
I think we should go together.

1203
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,110
You ask Ankita, I'll ask Hardik.

1204
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,080
What say?

1205
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,680
Okay.

1206
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,280
Hi.

1207
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,250
What happened?

1208
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,640
Why does something need
to happen every time?

1209
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,020
What's this?

1210
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:43,600
The investor gave the money?
- Yes!

1211
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,180
Nice.

1212
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:47,720
So, everything set now?

1213
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,470
It's just 10 percent.

1214
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,800
We'll increase the validity
of discount promo code.

1215
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,560
2-3 months' expenses will be handled.

1216
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,720
That is very good too.

1217
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,540
Let's go somewhere after two days.

1218
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,690
Even Shreya is asking Hardik.

1219
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,290
If they don't come, we won't go?

1220
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,900
We'll obviously go.

1221
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,020
Tell me!
- What?

1222
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,820
Okay. Where will we go?

1223
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:20,620
Abu.

1224
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,080
Seriously?
- I know...

1225
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,730
I'm changing the plan
from Italy to Abu.

1226
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:27,110
But only this much is
possible right now. Please.

1227
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,950
Okay. Fine.

1228
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,820
Thank you.

1229
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:47,740
It's good that you took leave. Or else
we won't have been able to come.

1230
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:51,850
Yeah. Right now it's a job,
so it could work out.

1231
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,210
When I get my own clinic, it
won't be possible. - Yeah, I know.

1232
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,830
It's difficult to manage business.
Look at us.

1233
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,250
We got time after so long.

1234
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,590
You people are great!
Shreya also does this.

1235
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:06,220
She compares your startup to medicines.

1236
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:08,740
I'm not comparing anything.

1237
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:13,200
What I meant is that you have to give
this much time in every business.

1238
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:14,230
Yeah.

1239
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:17,030
But it's good that we planned
to come to Abu.

1240
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:19,610
Else, I don't get time to
spend with Shreya.

1241
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,300
She's with you only most of the time.

1242
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:26,300
Not with me, but with her work.

1243
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,070
There's a lot of work really.

1244
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:30,690
And because we're looking for investors,
the work is going to increase.

1245
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,930
All this is fine right now, but it
can't happen after marriage.

1246
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,050
Why?
- I mean...

1247
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,280
Problems will increase if this
continues after marriage.

1248
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,940
Why would they increase? It's all
about mutual understanding.

1249
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,000
Nikunj, mutual understanding
sounds good while talking only.

1250
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:49,730
But if we give freedom to wives,
they start controlling us.

1251
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,920
What's there to control?
Who are we to give freedom?

1252
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,340
We do what we like, they
do what they like.

1253
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,260
This mentality has ruined everything.

1254
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,630
See, the term is 'man of the house'.

1255
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:02,910
'Man'.

1256
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,620
Don't you agree?
- Let's go.

1257
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:26,350
Soda or water?

1258
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:28,400
First peg is neat.

1259
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,310
Bottoms up. Come on.
You don't know the rules?

1260
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:33,700
Hey. Cheers. Bottoms up.

1261
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,640
I can't...

1262
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:42,270
He's fast.
- I know.

1263
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,890
Second one.
- Yeah.

1264
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,390
Make it hard. It was too light.
- Sure.

1265
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,690
You drink light only?
Drink hard. Be a man.

1266
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,950
I just drink for taste.
Not for getting drunk.

1267
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,750
Still. What's the use in drinking if
you don't want to get drunk?

1268
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:14,080
Right?
- Oh...

1269
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:17,460
Calm down, okay? You know that
you become a sheep afterwards.

1270
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:21,220
No, seriously.

1271
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,500
You don't know what you're saying.

1272
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,120
What will you have? Cocktail?

1273
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:32,490
Yeah. We should try. He makes it nice.

1274
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,960
You'll also drink?
- Yeah.

1275
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,350
Okay.

1276
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:50,840
Nikunj, thank you. You said
that's why she agreed.

1277
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,900
Else she never drinks with me.

1278
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,650
It's Nikunj's recipe.
I'll have to try it.

1279
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,590
Yes. - Yeah. Of course.
- And yeah...

1280
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,470
Your cocktail.

1281
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:06,440
Cheers.

1282
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:07,520
Cheers.

1283
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:09,310
Cheers to Appetite!

1284
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,230
Cheers.

1285
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,970
Cheers!
- And cheers to aunt!

1286
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,690
Aunt?
- Who aunt?

1287
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:16,200
Appetite's aunt.

1288
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,300
She has given the name Appetite.

1289
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,120
Yeah.

1290
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:27,700
Good?

1291
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:34,760
Nikunj, I'm sure that she came after
you because of Appetite and startup.

1292
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,280
Else I've never seen her
entrepreneurship spark.

1293
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,530
You haven't seen her working, that's why.
She's really good. She manages everything.

1294
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,410
Yeah. She managed your
startup business really well.

1295
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,390
Only our marriage has
become mismanaged.

1296
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,130
Right?

1297
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,190
The wedding date got postponed.

1298
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,510
You're going to get married,
you should get used to waiting.

1299
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,680
I was waiting for Italy all these days
and we came to Abu, right?

1300
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,630
But you're in such a hurry!

1301
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:27,950
That's not it.

1302
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:31,370
You know everyone are asking
me why the date got postponed.

1303
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:34,080
What should I tell everyone?
Shreya is busy.

1304
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,520
Where? In her startup.

1305
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:43,440
You know there is a lot
of work in wedding, right?

1306
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,120
I am having to do all that.
You do your business.

1307
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,400
That's great. You should
get used to it.

1308
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,950
You won't have problems after marriage.
- I don't need to learn all this.

1309
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,770
I don't want to become Nikunj.

1310
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,180
Excuse me.

1311
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,030
Let me just talk to him.

1312
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:41,540
You think he got irritated just because
the marriage date got postponed?

1313
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,520
Let him talk it out.

1314
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:06,270
Why did you drink so much?
You know that you can't handle it.

1315
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:08,950
I'm not drunk.

1316
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:14,750
You know what you're saying? - I know
everything. I understand everything.

1317
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:16,840
And I meant what I said.

1318
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,530
Go to sleep right now.
We'll talk tomorrow.

1319
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,900
Else you'll think
I'm talking like a sheep.

1320
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,480
Good morning.

1321
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:49,800
Morning.

1322
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,370
What happened?

1323
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,060
You were quiet last night as well.

1324
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:11,040
Right now also you're quiet.

1325
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,340
You're still there?

1326
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,820
People are quiet only
in two conditions.

1327
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:23,380
When they don't know anything and when they know
everything but they don't get the chance to speak.

1328
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:26,400
So what is it?

1329
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:30,620
I think you're still drunk.

1330
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,420
You don't care at all?

1331
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:38,120
Our personal lives are getting
affected because of their startup.

1332
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,100
You're great.

1333
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,500
But I can't tolerate it anymore.

1334
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:58,110
Our problems are at the initial level.

1335
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,000
You have a financial crisis, right?

1336
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,200
The Hyderabad house deal also
got cancelled. Shreya told me.

1337
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:07,580
Still you don't care at all?

1338
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:09,610
Wow.

1339
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,440
Yes, dad?

1340
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,080
How much is the blood pressure?

1341
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,990
Take her to the hospital,
we're leaving.

1342
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:36,740
Grandma got sick again.

1343
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,850
We'll have to leave right away.

1344
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:41,590
You tell Nikunj, I'll tell Shreya.

1345
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:51,370
Hello? No, she's fine.

1346
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:54,480
They'll discharge her after 3-4 days.

1347
01:34:58,850 --> 01:34:59,960
What is it?

1348
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,590
The patient's condition is normal.

1349
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:05,620
She will be discharged in two or
three days. Don't worry.

1350
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:08,530
Okay, sir. Thank you.

1351
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:12,320
Yes, dad?
- How is she?

1352
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,660
She's fine. But there are
a lot of blockages.

1353
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:19,130
There won't be any problem. The
treatment is nice. Don't worry. - Yeah.

1354
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:25,030
How is she?
- She's fine now.

1355
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:28,720
But I don't think she has more time.

1356
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,630
I'll be back.

1357
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:40,800
She can't let go of the
attachments, that's why.

1358
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:44,810
She's attached to Hardik.
It's tend to happen. - Yeah.

1359
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,740
She wishes to see Hardik get married.

1360
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,790
When this is over,
we'll think about it.

1361
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,780
Yeah.

1362
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,620
No, call me when all the orders
all cleared. I'll tell you. Okay.

1363
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,390
What did you think about the house?

1364
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,410
Yes, Romil?

1365
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:19,300
Hardik's grandma is sick,
so she might be busy.

1366
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:23,890
No, you don't worry. We'll
both come to the meeting.

1367
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,480
If it's not possible for her, I'll come.
Don't worry. Yeah. I'll see you in the meeting.

1368
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:42,050
Sorry, you were saying something.

1369
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,960
I'm thinking I should go to
mom's place for some days.

1370
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,520
Yeah, okay.

1371
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,970
I'll drop you on the way.

1372
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,720
Fine. I'll go.

1373
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,730
Nikunj sir, can I get a leave?

1374
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:12,950
For what?
- It's a wedding.

1375
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:15,100
Yours?
- No, my friend’s.

1376
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,880
You really have to go?
- It's important.

1377
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,210
I'll do something. First you
get the box of nuts.

1378
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,120
Okay.

1379
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:32,200
Hi. Good you came.

1380
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,640
Romil was scared that you
won't come to the meeting.

1381
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,780
All well?

1382
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,560
Not really.

1383
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,710
Grandma's health is uncertain.

1384
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:50,580
And the original date of the
marriage are back. - Next month?

1385
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:58,960
We had almost set our business properly
and now if marriage comes...

1386
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:01,750
I don't know how I'll
handle everything.

1387
01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:03,740
Don't worry, we'll do something.

1388
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:06,680
You get ready for today's meeting first.
We'll have to leave immediately.

1389
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:09,040
I need to change as well.

1390
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,700
Natu, give me the order,
I'll deliver it on the way.

1391
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,130
See, dad. I had talked to
you about Appetite, right?

1392
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,920
This is the very app. It's very easy.

1393
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,720
Just three steps away.

1394
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:29,010
All you have to do is, click this button
on the app, select the area...

1395
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:31,220
Select the food, and then...

1396
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,920
If you have a promo code, you
can enter it to avail discount.

1397
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,640
And yes... Good to go.

1398
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:40,840
And there are many corporate houses in
our area where they deliver the food.

1399
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,100
And their main USP is that
their food is very healthy.

1400
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:50,740
All that is fine.

1401
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,770
But what about the monthly income?

1402
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:59,350
Uncle, you'll get the income
and the profit, both.

1403
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:03,380
Right now we're having minimal
investment yet we're getting orders.

1404
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:07,880
Then I'm pretty sure that when you invest,
we'll spend on marketing and resources...

1405
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:12,920
Then I'm pretty sure we'll get 10 times more orders
and the company's valuation will also increase.

1406
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,510
All that is on the paper.

1407
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:18,070
But how will you increase the profit?

1408
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:24,850
It's not like that, dad. If we invest in them, the
company's all over valuation will increase.

1409
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,580
And with that, the valuation of
our shares will also increase.

1410
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:31,580
And I had talked to them about
giving 20 percent share. - Yes.

1411
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:36,340
Yeah.
- And can we sell those shares to BSE?

1412
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:39,020
No, uncle. Let me explain.

1413
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,810
You can't sell it to BSE, but you
can sell it in equity circuit.

1414
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,760
And here, the value is of the data.

1415
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:49,880
When transactions happen, when people
download the app, then data is generated.

1416
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,890
Their name, number,
address, their preferences,

1417
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:55,610
their financial position;
and this data is valuable.

1418
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,820
With every transaction, the
company's valuation increases.

1419
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,310
Every e-commerce business
works like this.

1420
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:05,550
For example, Ola, Uber;
take any company.

1421
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:07,310
Startups work like this.

1422
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:11,460
And when the valuation reaches a certain
level and the entire company is sold...

1423
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,110
Then you can see cash.

1424
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,100
But who would take such a company?

1425
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,050
All the e-commerce companies run
their business by giving discounts.

1426
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,890
And that's why they suffer loss.

1427
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,780
It's not like that, uncle...
- Listen...

1428
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:29,380
I only understand profit and loss.

1429
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,090
Uncle...

1430
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:40,740
We talked to Romil and after
that we started the work.

1431
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:45,050
And we started giving the promo
code as well... So if we do like this...

1432
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:46,590
He just talks.

1433
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,170
But I'm the one who'll invest.

1434
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:54,280
You're his friend that's why
I can give you some money.

1435
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,500
But I can't invest.

1436
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:00,420
Romil. We need to leave.

1437
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,020
Sorry, guys.

1438
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:11,580
Some other time.

1439
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,960
Sorry.

1440
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:16,620
Shreya.

1441
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:20,070
The 10 percent advance
cheque which I had given...

1442
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,740
Please see to it that you can
return it as soon as possible.

1443
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:26,340
Because I haven't told dad.

1444
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,950
Listen, Nikunj...
- Let's discontinue the promo code.

1445
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,710
Yes. We're burning money.

1446
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:06,720
How can we stop giving the discount?
The customers will decrease.

1447
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:10,070
If we don't stop the discount, we won't even be
able to serve the customers which we have.

1448
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,160
Yeah, but there has to be
some other way... - No.

1449
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,100
You listen to me.
Let's stop the discount.

1450
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:17,180
We can't afford it.

1451
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:31,350
The new order is ready.

1452
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,710
Madam...
- Yeah?

1453
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,880
When will I get last month's salary?

1454
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:40,340
Talk to Nikunj. - I told him. - So?

1455
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,180
So why don't you finish the matter?

1456
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:45,770
I can't manage anymore.
- Huh?

1457
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:47,950
Are we going to run away or what?

1458
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:49,580
You should see the other startups...

1459
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:52,540
There they don't pay salaries even after
three months! - Shreya, one minute.

1460
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,230
Give me one week's time,
I'll give you your salary.

1461
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:06,090
Fine.
- Complete this delivery.

1462
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,250
Where will we bring it from?
- Why are you getting angry at them?

1463
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,000
You know the condition of our accounts,
right? - Is he responsible for that?

1464
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:19,160
If they go, then what we have will also go.
- What about the daily expenses?

1465
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,450
If we hadn't got into Romil's matter,
time won't have been wasted.

1466
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,940
What should we do now?
- I don't know.

1467
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:36,680
I'll sell my Hyderabad flat. Even if
I have to do it at a lower cost.

1468
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,010
Have you gone mad?

1469
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:44,560
Is there any other option?

1470
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,710
Coming.

1471
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:16,810
Hey, Kumar!

1472
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,400
How are you?
- I'm fine. Come in.

1473
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,670
Where are mom and Ankita?
- They're right here.

1474
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,330
I think the mother and daughter are very
busy. Ankita didn't call since morning.

1475
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:41,480
That's good!

1476
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:45,060
How are you, dear?
- What's up, mom?

1477
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:47,740
How is the work going?

1478
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,630
It's going on.

1479
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:53,940
What happened at
the investor's meeting?

1480
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,760
He refused.

1481
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,800
No problem, something will happen.
- Yes, definitely.

1482
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:05,340
Kumar, I was saying...

1483
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:11,790
We want to invest in your company.

1484
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,950
Really. My FD is going to get matured.

1485
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:21,390
So I was thinking, instead of investing somewhere
else, why shouldn't I invest in your company?

1486
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:24,590
You really want to invest?
- Yes.

1487
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:28,840
You don't go by my face.
The amount of FD is very high.

1488
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:34,310
No, do it. Please. I'm looking
for an investor anyway.

1489
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:37,250
Nowadays whoever I meet, no
one is interested in my business.

1490
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:42,270
They will. Something will happen.
- Yes, it will.

1491
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,810
But I think...

1492
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,970
...I should sell the Hyderabad flat
even if I get a low price.

1493
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:50,730
What flat?

1494
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:53,450
The flat whose deal was finalized?

1495
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:58,810
Srinivas had called a few days ago that...
- The deal got cancelled. - Yeah.

1496
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:02,400
And you didn't even tell me about it.

1497
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,670
I didn't mean to, I must have
forgotten due to work.

1498
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,290
Shreya knows it, Hardik knows it.

1499
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:15,480
And you forgot to tell me?

1500
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,930
Listen...

1501
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,110
What happened to you suddenly?

1502
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:51,490
What about me? Nowadays everything
happens to you only.

1503
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:53,840
What are you saying?

1504
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,700
You didn't want to take money
from dad while buying house.

1505
01:46:58,150 --> 01:46:59,910
Now why did you get convinced?

1506
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,660
When did I get convinced?
I was just joking with him.

1507
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:06,060
You were joking?

1508
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,300
Everything is just a joke for you?

1509
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,980
Everything is a joke!

1510
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:15,490
Coming back to Ahmedabad
from Hyderabad...

1511
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:18,250
You took a low-salaried
job in Ahmedabad.

1512
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,610
And you quit that job
because of one dispute.

1513
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:26,150
Then you started this tiffin service.

1514
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:31,480
You cancelled the Europe
trip and now this!

1515
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:40,280
You promised me that you would
take a job if this didn't work out.

1516
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:43,970
Don't you see it?
Everything is falling apart!

1517
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:49,930
Now you want to sell the Hyderabad flat
to invest in your business? Seriously?

1518
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:54,140
You know that our house
is so important for me!

1519
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,640
House and family.

1520
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:01,400
This was our priority.

1521
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:11,230
I don't know if it was for you
or not, but it is for me.

1522
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:18,780
It feels like you've
always been selfish.

1523
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:51,580
Okay.

1524
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:57,120
Maybe I'm entirely at fault.

1525
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:06,170
But I'm not selfish.

1526
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,330
I was never.

1527
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:51,450
How is it?
- Hmm.

1528
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:53,130
It's nice.

1529
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:56,420
But won't it clash with
my coat's colour? - So?

1530
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:59,260
So it's better if
there's contrast, right?

1531
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,900
Look, I like this. And I think
I should totally buy this.

1532
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:06,210
Then why did you call me?

1533
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:09,010
I had said no. Why did you come?

1534
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:17,680
You'll have to tighten it from here.
- It will be done, but it will take time.

1535
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,170
So, any easy way out?

1536
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:23,030
I'll stitch it from here,
it will be done.

1537
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:26,490
Okay. I'll remove the scarf.

1538
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:30,050
But why do you want to do this?

1539
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,800
You'll wear it for wedding. We're spending
money, it's okay. You can do it.

1540
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,900
But I need to wear it only once.

1541
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,040
You do what you feel like.

1542
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:41,760
Anyway I'm getting late.

1543
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,760
Where are you going?
- Office.

1544
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,800
There are some problems in the
new Android version that's why.

1545
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,270
Then why did we come?

1546
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,440
Why did I take leave from office?

1547
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:58,390
Hardik, it's my work.
I can't avoid it. It's urgent.

1548
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:02,850
Why can't you just stop it?

1549
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,450
Stop what?

1550
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:10,960
How many days are
left till our wedding?

1551
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,190
And you're still after the business.

1552
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,450
Hardik, I've worked so hard.

1553
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,980
Obviously, I can't just keep it aside.

1554
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:21,810
What's left in that now? It's over.

1555
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,980
You were so excited for
shopping. Look at you now.

1556
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:32,430
But I'm managing everything. - If you knew how to
manage, everything wouldn't have got messed up.

1557
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,860
You're managing huh?

1558
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:42,090
And please stop running after Nikunj.

1559
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:44,810
Hardik, do you know what you're saying?

1560
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:49,050
Just what you heard. That's it.

1561
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,550
Now please focus on the wedding.

1562
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:55,340
Listen, I let you do
whatever you wanted.

1563
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:58,420
If your startup hobby
is fulfilled, then stop it.

1564
01:54:59,470 --> 01:55:03,330
Now decide. Do you want to do
the startup or the wedding?

1565
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,620
Do you understand?

1566
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:13,740
Tell me.

1567
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:18,240
I'm on leave today, call Dr. Anil.

1568
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:20,270
Yeah.

1569
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,740
I'm out for wedding shopping.

1570
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,960
Sorry.

1571
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:56,580
I'm sorry.

1572
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,800
Chef!
- What happened?

1573
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:39,370
Your salary for two months.
I'll give the rest later.

1574
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:43,660
If you have problem right now,
I'll manage. It's okay.

1575
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:46,990
No, chef. Take it. Thank you.

1576
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:54,970
Such a big issue?

1577
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:01,690
When did you update the app last time?

1578
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,620
Monday. Last Monday.

1579
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:07,060
You couldn't see such a major bug?

1580
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:09,090
But what happened?

1581
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:11,820
We're not able to receive
orders from new users!

1582
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:14,110
Who checked it last?

1583
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:19,550
I had checked it, then
Shreya checked it.

1584
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:21,630
Then none of you could
see this problem?

1585
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:22,230
Yes, but...

1586
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:24,340
Do you understand what has happened?

1587
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:29,260
I had told you so many times, after every
change, you should check for new users.

1588
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,450
Yeah.

1589
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:32,470
There's no order since last Monday
from new users.

1590
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:41,650
You came so early!

1591
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:44,410
I thought you would come after wedding.

1592
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:46,510
What happened?

1593
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:47,450
Tell her what happened.

1594
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,930
Someone take this order!

1595
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:55,160
After the new update, we are not able to
receive orders from new users.

1596
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,640
How is it possible?
I reviewed everything.

1597
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,640
You take care of this.
- Yeah.

1598
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,920
Nikunj, listen...
- What to listen?

1599
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:32,060
What should I listen?

1600
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:35,400
Shreya, such an
irresponsible behaviour?

1601
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:38,080
I called you so many times,
messaged you a lot.

1602
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,960
I thought at least you won't get angry.
- Then what should I do?

1603
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:44,450
I know all this is because of the bugs.

1604
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:49,530
Seriously? You can only
see the bug problem?

1605
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:52,500
Do you know there are
so many other problems?

1606
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,750
Do you know what happened
in the last few days?

1607
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:58,560
See, there are lots of issues at home.

1608
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:01,990
And even Hardik is not understanding...
- Please, Shreya. Grow up.

1609
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:05,430
You just decide what you want to do.

1610
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:09,850
Do you want to live your life your
way or others way? Please decide.

1611
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:13,230
And everyone has problems at home.

1612
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:15,490
That doesn't mean you
should stop working.

1613
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,550
What did you want to do?

1614
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:28,890
A big app, million orders,
growth, big company...

1615
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,470
You only wanted to do all this.

1616
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:35,010
So all this doesn't happen
overnight. You have to work hard.

1617
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:45,110
It was my mistake.

1618
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,370
I thought you were enjoying this work.

1619
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:51,510
You were seriously passionate about it.
- I am!

1620
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:15,980
Yes?

1621
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:23,370
Your delivery from Appetite.
- Oh.

1622
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:25,870
Okay.

1623
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:36,050
I'm sorry but you don't
look like delivery guys.

1624
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:38,860
We're the founders.

1625
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:41,210
CEO and CTO.

1626
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:48,030
Ah. Interesting.

1627
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:50,780
Come on in.

1628
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:07,270
I'm Premal.
- I know. Premal Shroff.

1629
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:10,060
You are our regular client. I know you.

1630
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:13,050
By the way, I'm Nikunj.

1631
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,890
Shreya.

1632
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,230
So, tell me.

1633
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,610
Why are the CEO and CTO of the
company doing a home delivery?

1634
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,410
It's a long story.

1635
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:31,780
Keep it short.

1636
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:36,410
In short, the thing is, we're
shrinking into a small unit.

1637
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:40,560
I mean, we won't be able to
deliver in this area now.

1638
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:44,860
That's sad.

1639
02:01:45,330 --> 02:01:48,050
I mean, I like your food a lot.

1640
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:51,510
See, I live in the US for two months
then I come here for a month.

1641
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:54,510
So whenever I come here, I like
to have a healthy breakfast.

1642
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,220
I really like your buckwheat idlis.

1643
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:02,670
And your beetroot roasted
cutlets are amazing. Really.

1644
02:02:03,790 --> 02:02:05,340
Thanks.
- Thank you.

1645
02:02:05,620 --> 02:02:07,840
The app is also doing okay.

1646
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:12,240
I mean it has its design issues, but
at least it's not a copy of a US app.

1647
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:15,420
Which is what most people
do out here, right?

1648
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:19,830
So, tell me. What's the problem?

1649
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:22,390
Is it investors or...

1650
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,240
Is it the tech? What is it?

1651
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,040
It's just not our time.

1652
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,640
Look...

1653
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:48,860
Tell you what...

1654
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:54,390
Why don't you come over on
Saturday and pitch it to me?

1655
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:57,110
We'd love to do that.

1656
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,070
Yeah. Good.

1657
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,660
I'll need all the details, of course.
- Sure.

1658
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:04,340
What's the financials,
your server, your app...

1659
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:08,180
Definitely. - Look, I'm not
promising anything but...

1660
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,240
There's no harm in trying.
I meet a lot of people.

1661
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:16,820
Yeah.

1662
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:19,040
There's no harm in trying.

1663
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:21,240
Cool.

1664
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,090
So I'll see you soon.
- Yes.

1665
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:25,630
Nikunj...

1666
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:26,960
One more thing.

1667
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:30,930
Don't goof up like last time.

1668
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:42,420
Sure.

1669
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:43,930
Yeah?

1670
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:47,430
So I'll see you soon, alright?
- Yes.

1671
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:49,620
Thank you.

1672
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:54,410
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1673
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:23,620
I had never thought that we would
meet Premal Shroff again like this.

1674
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:25,360
And he'll offer us a pitch!

1675
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:36,650
Shreya, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
overreacted so much. - No, you were right.

1676
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:42,350
I'll have to decide what
I should do ahead.

1677
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:47,700
What happened all of a sudden? You were
so excited when you said yes to him.

1678
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:51,230
If I had not said yes, you might
have said no to him.

1679
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:54,420
And I didn't want you to
lose this opportunity.

1680
02:04:58,010 --> 02:05:00,880
Why are you talking like this
suddenly? We just agreed to him...

1681
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,340
Listen, the presentation is almost
ready. If you want, I can send it to you.

1682
02:05:05,650 --> 02:05:08,210
In case you want any changes,
I'll do them for you.

1683
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,390
Huh?

1684
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:14,900
What?

1685
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:17,470
Are you saying that...

1686
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:25,960
Good luck.

1687
02:05:34,730 --> 02:05:36,670
You're still sleeping, dear?

1688
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:41,100
Look, I've ordered all the designs for
you. Now you finalize one of them.

1689
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,520
Shreya...

1690
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:44,680
Shreya?

1691
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:47,330
Are you tired, dear?

1692
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,020
Shreya?

1693
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,310
Aren't you getting late?

1694
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,700
What if it doesn't work out?

1695
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:53,520
I mean, seriously, should I do all this?

1696
02:06:57,680 --> 02:06:58,700
Go for it.

1697
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:02,070
I'm with you.

1698
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,960
You refused him?

1699
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:25,610
What if he refuses us today?

1700
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,780
So?

1701
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:46,540
So what?
