Lord Ram's kingdom had been
established.

00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,943
Lord Ram's kingdom had been
established.

3
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:58,850
Ayodha was in a state of jubilation.

4
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,415
All the subject considered King Ram..

5
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,154
..and Queen Sita their ideals.

6
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:09,625
Lord Ram and mother Sita too loved
their subjects.

7
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,669
But destiny has something else in
mind.

8
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:17,902
A washer-man raised doubts on
mother Sita's character..

9
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,438
..which stunned entire Ayodhya.

10
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:23,439
Respecting the issues raised by the
subject..

11
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:26,243
..Lord Ram abandoned Mother Sita.

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,614

..sage Valmiki r equested her to come
to a hermitage.

16
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,834
As Goddess for forest, queen Sita..

17
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,302

''He has marked the back of squirr els

32
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:59,559
''He makes everyone virtues.''

33
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:09,908
''O' Lord! He has made me a great

00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:18,818
''Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Ram.''

35
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:27,559
''Lord Ram is the incarnation of truth

00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:35,635
''Just by seeing him, our hearts

''Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Ram.''

38
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:53,147
''Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Ram.''

39
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,234
Teacher, we're blessed to hear this
melodious composition.

40
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:11,802
It's true. This composition is full of
devotion.

00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,735
It spellbound even Natur e.

42
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:16,540
This is praise worthy.

43
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,849
Teacher, the melody of this
composition..

44
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,476
..will echo in the entire world one day.

45
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,314
This melody isn't in my composition..

46
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,415
..but it's in the saga of Lord Ram.

47
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:33,856
Luva. Kusha. Do you know..

48
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:37,557
..why do we recite Ramayan every day.

49
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:38,823
Yes, teacher.

50
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,499
Ramayan guides our life..

51
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,500
..and shows us to respect religion.

52
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,276
It stops human from become beasts.

53
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:51,643
Teacher, in Ramayan Lord Ram's
character is so pure..

54
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:54,342
..that it makes human a God.

55
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,342
Goddess of for est..

56
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,385
..should I give to both your sons..

57
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,514
..the responsibility of protecting this
forest.

58
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:05,218
Teacher, I'm only their mother.

59
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,528
But you'r e their guide.

60
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,558
As you deem right.

61
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:14,334
Luva. Kusha. Both of you..

62
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,829
..are given the responsibility to protect
the forest.

63
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:18,535
As you order, teacher!

64
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,776
Tomorrow morning, I'll give you Divine
weapons.

65
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,597
Luva, Kusha, this is Arrow of Fire.

66
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,191
This is of Wind.

67
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:21,728
This is Varun's arrow.

68
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,701
And this is Indra's arr ow.

69
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,741
All these arrows have divine powers.

70
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:30,438
Use any one of these arrow.

71
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,241
Luva. Kusha. Negate the effect of the
arrow of fire quickly.

72
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,876
Or else this fir e will incinerate the
entir e for est.

73
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,464
This is Arrow of Five Elements.

74
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:27,468
It's the most powerful weapon.

75
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:28,761
Always keep in mind..

76
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:32,174
..use it only when it's very vital.

77
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:35,643
Or else this can harm you too.

78
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:46,218
''O' teacher! You're our God!''

79
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:57,528
''O' teacher! You're Almighty!''

80
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,703
Leave me. Leave me.

81
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:49,250
I did n't catch you to leave, but to
devour you.

82
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,674
Help!

83
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,256
My life is in danger. Help me.

84
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:02,492
Help me. Help me!

85
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:26,178
Why did you do this?

86
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,781
What's my fault? Why did you cage
me?

87
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:30,180
Who are you?

88
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:32,623
O' Great bird! They're Luva and Kusha.

89
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,352
They're pr otector of this for est.

90
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,459
And we their friends.

91
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,466
No matter who you're, why did you
imprison me?

92
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,361
You br oke the rule of this for est.

93
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:43,594
How?

94
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,807
This is hermitage of sage Valmiki.

95
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,675
Hunting isn't allowed her e.

96
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,207
We live here in harmony.

97
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:55,879
Forgive me. I didn't know the rules of
this for est.

98
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,412
So I made this mistake.

99
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:01,485
Ok, we forgive you.

100
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,773
Don't worry, Great Bird!

101
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,266
This wound will heal very quickly.

102
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:26,372
Friends, I'm fr om the lineage of Jatayu.

103
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,474
I'm thankful to you for your kindness.

104
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,449
Can I become your friend?

105
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,613
Sure, friend.

106
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,146
Thank you.

107
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,753
I'll take your leave now.

108
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,786
Whenever you'll call me..

109
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,263
..I'll be in your service.

110
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:43,654
Sure.

111
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:44,867
See you soon, friend.

112
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:45,196
See you soon, friend.

113
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:04,150
This isn't to eat but to play!

114
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,791
Don't hit me. I say stop.

115
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,801
That's why they say it's futile to give
coconut to an ape.

116
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:25,773
What did you say? This is our insult.

117
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,705
No! This is your ignorance.

118
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:33,441
You can break coconut by hitting it on
a hard thing.

119
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,406
Then you'll get sweet water..

120
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,679
..and delicious coconut to eat.

121
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:51,424
Friends, come here. Come her e!

122
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,367
Look! This is a hard surface.

123
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:55,692
Oh no!

124
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:57,901
We'll break coconut on it.

125
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,707
Not like this.

126
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,648
Look how I break it.

127
00:19:09,585 --> 00:19:12,850
O' Ram! O' Ram!

128
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:16,217
Luva. Did you hear this chant of 'Ram'?

129
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,360
Yes, someone is sur ely in tr ouble.

130
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:26,457
Wait.

131
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:29,698
Why are you hitting him?

132
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,731
We'r e not hitting him.

133
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:34,707
We'r e only br eaking the coconut.

134
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:43,343
Do you know that you're hurting him
by doing this?

135
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,852
It's not our fault.

136
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:50,189
One should break coconut on a hard
surface..

137
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,886
..this advice was given by this tortoise.

138
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,595
We found this to be the best place.

139
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:59,600
I only told you the way to break the
coconut.

140
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:03,601
I did n't tell you to br eak on it on my
shell.

141
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,463
You didn't do the right thing.

142
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:09,901
It's shameful to hurt those who help
you.

143
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:14,849
Forgive us for our ignorance.

144
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:17,742
Yes, forgive us!

145
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,309
Look at this.

146
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,555
First tear the coconut skin like this.

147
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,433
Then break it like this.

148
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,194
Now eat it.

149
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:45,504
You pr otected me.

150
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:48,215
I'll always be indebted to you.

151
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:51,709
I'll repay this favor when the time
comes.

152
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:55,485
It's mor e fun to live in harmony.

153
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:57,390
Don't forget this.

154
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,524
Yes, we won't forget. We won't forget.

155
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:09,464
So many insects!

156
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,338
And that too of golden color!

157
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,473
We never saw them in the forest
before.

158
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:16,411
Where could they've come from?

159
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:34,287
Oh no! Brother Kusha!

160
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:38,927
Kusha! Brother Kusha! -Luva, hold my
hand.

161
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,633
Nothing will happen, Luva.

162
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,698
Br other Kusha! Brother Kusha! -Don't
be scar ed, Luva.

163
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,175
Mother.

164
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:14,855
Luva. Kusha. Welcome to my world!

165
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,858
What's this magic!

166
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:20,629
This isn't magic, but your imagination.

167
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,232
If this is our imagination..

168
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,434
..then who ar e they?

169
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,708
They're those desires of your heart..

170
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:31,371
..which ar e in front of you as
mirror-image.

171
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,137
Can we sing?

172
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,212
Will our desires be fulfilled?

173
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:36,673
Sure.

174
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:38,719
That's the destiny.

175
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:41,781
That's why you both are brought here.

176
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,535
Accept this divine drink!

177
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,462
You'll become expert in all the skills.

178
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:59,857
''Hear the saga of Ramayan!''

179
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:03,870

Look!

It wasn't needed.

208
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:18,643
If they had waited a bit longer..

00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,508
I'll fulfill it.

356
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:53,146
King, we just want to see Mother Sita
once.

357
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:57,418
We don't want anything more than
that.

358
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:09,864
Hanuman, take Luva and Kusha
around the Ayodhya city.

359
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,563
Come with me, kids.

360
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:16,132
Ayodhya is a very beautiful city.

361
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:19,106
The royal roads are huge.

362
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:23,642
The subject lives peacefully and
happily.

363
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,882
The land is fertile here for agricultur e.

364
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:31,355
God and nature has always been kind
to Lord Ram.

365
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:34,889
Whose palace is this? It's shining so
brightly.

366
00:46:35,663 --> 00:46:38,894
This is the workshop of May, the great
sculptor.

367
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,793
Can we see this workshop?

368
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:44,864
Kids, why do you want to see it?

369
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:48,671
Teacher Valmiki had praised this great
sculptor.

370
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:51,309
So we want to meet him.

371
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:53,505
This sculptor is very hot tempered.

372
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,578
I'll wait outside. You can go in and
meet him.

373
00:46:57,218 --> 00:46:58,207
Fine.

374
00:46:58,819 --> 00:46:58,986
Hail Lord Ram!

375
00:46:58,986 --> 00:46:59,816
Hail Lord Ram!

376
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:25,136
It's surprising! Very beautiful.

377
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:27,709
Who let you in? Tell me.

378
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,680
We'r e sage Valmiki's disciples.

379
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,813
We.. -Don't disturb my concentration.

380
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,444
Go away from here.

381
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,384
Forgive me. I've a doubt.

382
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,418
Can you please resolve it?

383
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:41,160
We'll go away from here.

384
00:47:41,262 --> 00:47:44,288
Please tell us, whose is this incomplete
golden sculpture?

385
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:45,729
This is of Mother Sita.

386
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,495
Lord Ram is performing 'Ashvamedh'
veneration.

387
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:51,466
This sculpture will be place next to him
during veneration.

388
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,506
When Mother Sita is in Ayodhya..

389
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:55,370
..then what's the need for this
sculpture.

390
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,239
No. Mother Sita isn't her e.

391
00:47:57,344 --> 00:48:00,370
One stupid washer-man disgraced
Mother Sita.

392
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:02,839
Considering it to be the opinion of the
subject..

393
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,509
..Lord Ram sent pr egnant Sita to forest.

394
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:10,289
After that nobody knows where
Mother Sita is.

395
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:12,717
Oh! So this is the truth.

396
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:18,260
Now I understand why Lord Ram left
without answering us.

397
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,160
It's so strange.

398
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:24,067
Ideal man Ram's character is so cruel.

399
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:25,362
Let's go from here.

400
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:28,441
We won't stay in the kingdom of such
a cruel king.

401
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,413
Luva. Kusha. How is Ayodhya?

402
00:48:51,332 --> 00:48:53,323
Did you meet Lord Ram?

403
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:59,298
How was your song r ecital?

404
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:11,347
Is Mother Sita fine?

405
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:17,782
Nobody knows where Mother Sita is.

406
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:19,815
What do you mean?

407
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:21,388
Lord Ram is cruel.

408
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:24,129
He has no kindness in his heart.

409
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:27,498
It's better if we don't talk about him.

410
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:30,397
But tell us, what happened exactly?

411
00:49:30,738 --> 00:49:34,504
Lord Ram abandoned Mother Sita and
sent her to forest again.

412
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:37,606
Even though Mother Sita was
pregnant at that time.

413
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:39,673
Even after knowing this..

414
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:42,776
..nobody from Ayodhya came to help
her.

415
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,279
She became helpless.

416
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:47,479
We praised Lord Ram in ignorance!

417
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:49,678
Now our illusion has been shattered.

418
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:54,490
Fr om today Ram's name has no
importance in our life.

419
00:49:57,798 --> 00:49:59,459
Luva. Kusha. C ome here.

420
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:05,432
Are you so big to criticize Lord Ram?

421
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:09,604
Stop talking about futile things and
act r esponsibly.

422
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:11,844
Kusha, go.

423
00:50:12,946 --> 00:50:16,438
And bring flower and leaf for
veneration of Goddess Gauri.

424
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,508
As you say, mother.

425
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:23,355
Luva, better than gossiping with your
friends..

426
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:26,351
..you should be alert about pr otecting
the hermitage.

427
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,222
As you say, mother.

428
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:03,238
Wow!

429
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:22,329
Who are you? Introduce yourself.

430
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:24,421
Respect me!

431
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:27,690
I'm king of Ayodhya Lord Ram's..

432
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:29,860
..horse fr om 'Ashvamedh' veneration.

433
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,702
You'd be. Why should I car e?

434
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:35,832
If you want to know about me..

435
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:39,341
..then hear what's written on the
golden plate.

436
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:40,910
Kaushalya's son Lord Ram..

437
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:44,446
..is bonded by his promise like his
father.

438
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:46,381
Let me tell you for your knowledge..

439
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:48,750
..Lord Ram's younger brother
Shatrughan..

440
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:50,157
..is the protector of this horse of
'Ashvamedh' veneration.

441
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:50,851
..is the protector of this horse of
'Ashvamedh' veneration.

442
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,620
If you're brave warrior you can stop
me.

443
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:56,229
Or else surrender.

444
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:00,594
Nab this arrogant horse!

445
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:18,085
Horse of 'Ashvamedh' veneration is
there.

446
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,109
Horse of 'Ashvamedh' veneration is
there.

447
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:21,149
Go and bring it her e.

448
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:22,611
As you say.

449
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,418
Come! Move the chariot ahead!

450
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:01,616
What happened?

451
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,525
Someone has tied our horse.

452
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:12,864
Who has dar ed to tie our horse!

453
00:56:14,408 --> 00:56:15,397
We did it.

454
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,109
Why did you hold our horse?

455
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:26,077
We were provoked by the challenge
written..

456
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:27,676
..on the head of this horse.

457
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:33,586
It doesn't suit a warrior like me to fight
with unarmed kids.

458
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:36,521
Apologize and release the horse.

459
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:39,695
They're not alone. We're with them.

460
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,769
To defeat you and your army..

461
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:47,897
..I don't need any army.

462
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:49,535
I'm enough!

463
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:51,741
If you've the guts, then come..

464
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:53,268
..and fight me.

465
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,348
You'll sur ely be punished for it.

466
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:55,982
Get r eady to fight!

467
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:57,540
Get r eady to fight!

468
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:01,855
Attack!

469
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:02,480
Attack!

470
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:19,284
For the veneration of Goddess Gauri..

471
00:59:19,492 --> 00:59:22,825
..these lotus flowers have come
themselves.

472
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,696
Accept them, mother.

473
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:28,425
O' Lotus flower!

474
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,637
With your presence this veneration has
become more pious.

475
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:32,161
With your presence this veneration has
become more pious.

476
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:33,528
I'm blessed!

477
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:38,310
Mother. Mother.

478
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:42,677
A king is taking your son Luva on his
chariot as a prisoner.

479
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,351
Mother..

480
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:48,143
..it's not auspicious to leave the
veneration in the middle.

481
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:52,514
For a mother there is nothing more
important than her son.

482
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:55,156
There isn't need to worry.

483
00:59:55,395 --> 00:59:58,296
Mother, no matter how brave that
warrior is..

484
00:59:58,398 --> 00:59:58,465
..with your blessings, I'll sur ely defeat
him.

485
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:01,400
..with your blessings, I'll sur ely defeat
him.

486
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,662
Please complete your veneration.

487
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:05,770
I'll bring my brother.

488
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:08,568
My bless is always with you, son.

489
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:10,365
Be victorious!

490
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:11,466
Come!

491
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:43,331
Where is he?

492
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:47,139
Listen!

493
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,345
Find that chariot quickly..

494
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:53,215
..in which our friend has been held as a
prisoner.

495
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:58,789
There they'r e! They're moving towards
Shila mountain.

496
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:00,325
There is an army along.

497
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:32,422
Bewar e! This isn't because of the effect
of Nature.

498
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:34,652
This is surely a ruse of an enemy.

499
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:25,737
Leave my brother and this horse.

500
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:29,410
And the way you've bowed to protect
yourself..

501
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:32,352
..return in the same position.

502
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:32,613
..return in the same position.

503
01:02:32,952 --> 01:02:36,388
Or else you won't be able to raise your
head again in life.

504
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:38,150
Stop chattering, naive kid!

505
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,287
If you request me..

506
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:43,729
..then I'll leave your brother.

507
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,697
But if you ask for more..

508
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:46,366
..then you'll have to face my wrath.

509
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:48,630
..then you'll have to face my wrath.

510
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:53,200
Don't be so proud on defeating a kid.

511
01:02:53,306 --> 01:02:54,466
Fight me.

512
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:58,537
You'll know what bravery is.

513
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:00,680
I had spared you for so long..

514
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,579
..because you're a kid. A sage's son.

515
01:03:03,817 --> 01:03:06,809
But now you're crossing your limit.

516
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,854
You'll be punished for it.

517
01:03:09,255 --> 01:03:11,746
Let's see who punishes whom.

518
01:03:12,325 --> 01:03:14,088
Get r eady to fight.

519
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:14,794
Hail Lord Ram!

520
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,557
Hail Lord Ram!

521
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,541
You call yourself brave warrior.

522
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:35,508
What happened? Your arrow missed
the target.

523
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:37,248
You'r e mistaken.

524
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,484
My arrow didn't miss the target.

525
01:03:39,752 --> 01:03:42,789
But I had confined your king within the
boundary of a cir cle.

526
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:43,551
But I had confined your king within the
boundary of a cir cle.

527
01:05:32,198 --> 01:05:33,187
Come on!

528
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:52,283
Kusha! Don't worry.

529
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:54,519
He has only fainted.

530
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:13,562
When did you come?

531
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:15,741
Where is that cruel king?

532
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:17,368
Look here, friend.

533
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:22,146
Along with that cruel king, this horse
too is in our custody.

534
01:06:22,615 --> 01:06:26,711
Br other, do you know whose horse is
this?

535
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,146
Yes. He's Lord Ram's horse.

536
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:35,254
Br other, we won't leave this horse at
any cost.

537
01:06:36,362 --> 01:06:39,229
When Lord Ram himself comes to free
it..

538
01:06:39,632 --> 01:06:41,122
..then we'll ask him..

539
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:43,234
..what kind of a king are you!

540
01:06:43,736 --> 01:06:46,569
You abandoned a wife like Mother
Sita..

541
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:49,499
..and left her to wander in the forest.

542
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:51,301
As you wish.

543
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:52,667
Now let's go.

544
01:06:52,779 --> 01:06:54,474
Mother is worried for you.

545
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:58,514
Listen. All of you promise me..

546
01:06:59,385 --> 01:07:01,080
..that whatever happened her e..

547
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,282
..you won't tell about that to mother..

548
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,756
..teacher or the people of hermitage.

549
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,123
Because they're devotee of Lord Ram.

550
01:07:09,796 --> 01:07:11,388
They won't like it.

551
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:15,564
We promise. We won't tell anything.

552
01:07:15,868 --> 01:07:17,495
We won't tell.

553
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:36,882

554
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:42,093

557
01:07:52,505 --> 01:08:02,107

Lord Ram.''

560
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:36,307
''Ram kills the powerful Bali''

561
01:08:36,616 --> 01:08:41,417
''All the brave apes leave to find
Mother Sita.''

562
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:56,191
''Bajrang found Mother Sita in Lanka.''

563
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:01,097
''After bowing to Mother Sita..''

564
01:09:01,374 --> 01:09:05,834
''..Hanuman gives her the ring.''

565
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:13,181
''All the demons light Hanuman's tail
on fire.''

566
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:18,081
''Lord Hanuman incinerates Lanka like
lightening.''

567
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:22,761
''I sing praises of Lord Ram's miracles.''

568
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:27,359
''Lord Ram dwells in Hanuman's heart.''

569
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:37,633
''Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!''

570
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:51,783
''On the endless ocean, apes made a
bridge''

571
01:09:52,792 --> 01:10:01,894
''Even small cr eatures like squirrels
made contributions.''

572

Ravan took place.''

01:10:26,759 --> 01:10:28,886
''..brother in such a condition..''

01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:34,163
''..like parents mourning for children''

577
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:39,500
''Hanuman brought the mountain of
herbs crossing the ocean''

578
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:47,937
''Hanuman became Ram's favorite by
bringing 'Sanjevani' herb.''

01:11:23,316 --> 01:11:27,412
''Ravan got furious on hearing this
news''

''But the husband asks for test of fire''

595
01:12:58,644 --> 01:13:03,547
''Did Ram give a gift to Sita..''

''Chant his name and get blessed.''

Shatrughan is skilled in the use of
weapons.

605
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:34,428
It's our mistake to consider those who
defeated him just kids.

606
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:39,474
Laxman, should we tell brother Ram
about this incident?

607
01:14:39,912 --> 01:14:42,642
There is no need. I'll go myself..

608
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:45,645
..and r eturn victorious by evening.

609
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:49,750
Till then you'll be responsible to
oversee this veneration..

610
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:54,588
..brother. -Be victorious! Be victorious!

611
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:08,397
We'll win! We'll win! We'll win!

612
01:15:17,283 --> 01:15:19,683
Brave warriors! Keep in mind..

613
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:22,879
..we've to obey Luva and Kusha's order.

614
01:15:23,155 --> 01:15:25,521
Your alertness and disciple will
become..

615
01:15:25,624 --> 01:15:27,524
..the foundation of our victory.

616
01:15:29,562 --> 01:15:31,393
Righteousness always prevails!

617
01:15:32,164 --> 01:15:34,792
And we'r e fighting for the truth!

618
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,266
So we'll surely win.

619
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,635
You all seem to be tired.

620
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:40,898
Rest for a while.

621
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,807
When the bugle of battle is sounded..

622
01:15:43,342 --> 01:15:44,900
..get ready to attack.

623
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:46,735
Now you can go.

624
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:07,197
Why are you neighing?

625
01:16:07,466 --> 01:16:08,763
If you're hungry..

626
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:11,294
..then eat green grass.

627
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:16,805
I'm horse of 'Ashvamedh' veneration of
king Ram.

628
01:16:17,643 --> 01:16:20,407
You want me to eat this ordinary grass.

629
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,871
If horse is ordinary or of a king..

630
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,147
..it has to eat grass.

631
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:33,716
Let's go.

632
01:16:34,226 --> 01:16:38,526
When he'll get famished, he'll even eat
dry grass.

633
01:16:43,168 --> 01:16:44,260
What's going on?

634
01:16:44,803 --> 01:16:47,101
Everyone is leaving me alone.

635
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:49,307
Doesn't anyone care for me?

636
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:53,609
Don't worry. If you need our help, you
can call us.

637
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:55,175
We'll come immediately.

638
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:59,711
Did you see their arrogance, Lord?

639
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:02,543
They don't car e for me.

640
01:17:03,122 --> 01:17:06,057
I'll punish them for this.

641
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:13,495
Help me! Help me!

642
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:17,534
There is a lion!

643
01:17:21,907 --> 01:17:24,171
Lion? Where is the lion?

644
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:27,536
There is no lion.

645
01:17:27,913 --> 01:17:30,347
I was just kidding.

646
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,408
I wanted to see that if I scream..

647
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:37,178
..do you come here or not?

648
01:17:37,423 --> 01:17:40,859
We got worried for you, but you were
kidding us.

649
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:44,789
If you do this again, you'll be in big
trouble.

650
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:49,664
Did you see how they got irritated,
king?

651
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:52,232
This is just the beginning.

652
01:17:52,805 --> 01:17:54,432
Now watch ahead..

653
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,531
..how I tease them?

654
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:02,240
Help me! Help me!

655
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:06,347
Lion is coming towards me to eat me.

656
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,243
Help me!

657
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:10,746
Come and help me!

658
01:18:11,523 --> 01:18:14,492
Help me! Help me!

659
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,391
You lied to us again.

660
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:25,062
What do you think of yourself?

661
01:18:25,604 --> 01:18:29,199
If you shout again or wail..

662
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:30,502
..we won't come.

663
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:42,116
Oh God! This really a lion.

664
01:18:42,888 --> 01:18:44,355
What will happen now, Lord?

665
01:18:54,266 --> 01:18:58,168
O' brave warriors of forest! Help me!

666
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:03,266
This time I'm not kidding. A lion has
really come.

667
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:07,670
Believe me. Come and see for yourself.

668
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,079
Help me! Help me!

669
01:19:14,486 --> 01:19:15,646
Do you know who I'm?

670
01:19:16,388 --> 01:19:18,788
I'm horse of 'Ashvamedh' veneration of
Lord Ram.

671
01:19:19,525 --> 01:19:22,688
Don't even try to come close to me.

672
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:27,559
Luva. Kusha! Help me!

673
01:19:36,842 --> 01:19:38,309
Forgive me, friend.

674
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:41,712
I thought this horse isn't fr om our
forest.

675
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:43,748
But now I know..

676
01:19:44,249 --> 01:19:45,546
..he's our prisoner.

677
01:19:46,285 --> 01:19:47,877
Did you see?

678
01:19:48,487 --> 01:19:50,182
If we had been late..

679
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:53,482
..then because of this lie, you could've
even lost your life.

680
01:19:54,626 --> 01:19:55,888
Forgive me, friend.

681
01:19:56,829 --> 01:19:59,457
I'm ashamed of my deeds.

682
01:20:28,427 --> 01:20:29,416
Luva. Kusha.

683
01:20:29,528 --> 01:20:34,864
Laxman has entered the forest with his
army sounding his bugle.

684
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:53,251
Go and tell those kids..

685
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,277
..that I want to meet them.

686
01:20:55,387 --> 01:20:56,376
As you say.

687
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:00,155
We don't mind meeting him.

688
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:04,486
He can meet us in the meadow
between these two mountains.

689
01:21:32,658 --> 01:21:35,525
Kids, leave this horse of veneration.

690
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:38,719
And surr ender to the righteous king
Ram.

691
01:21:39,431 --> 01:21:41,763
Or else you've to face the
consequence.

692
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:43,868
For the protection of religion..

693
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:48,238
..we're ready to face any consequence.

694
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,367
You'r e going against king's order.

695
01:21:50,475 --> 01:21:51,840
Do you call this your r eligion?

696
01:21:52,444 --> 01:21:56,676
We don't consider a man our king who
insults a woman.

697
01:21:56,782 --> 01:22:00,149
Order of such a king has no
importance for us.

698
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:02,344
We pity you.

699
01:22:02,688 --> 01:22:04,747
So we'll leave your brother..

700
01:22:05,224 --> 01:22:06,714
..but not this horse.

701
01:22:06,825 --> 01:22:09,521
I did n't mind what you said because..

702
01:22:10,195 --> 01:22:11,184
..you're kids.

703
01:22:11,663 --> 01:22:13,130
You'r e sage Valmiki's disciples.

704
01:22:13,532 --> 01:22:14,556
But you'r e insolent!

705
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:18,898
You've invited death by thinking of
fighting me.

706
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:22,234
Your brother too was boasting like
you.

707
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:23,698
But what happened?

708
01:22:24,509 --> 01:22:27,706
Look, he's quiet like a statue.

709
01:22:27,813 --> 01:22:29,246
Stop this audacity!

710
01:22:29,748 --> 01:22:31,511
This is my final warning.

711
01:22:31,817 --> 01:22:33,876
Tell me, will you leave the horse or
not?

712
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,588
Even if Lord Ram himself comes here..

713
01:22:36,688 --> 01:22:38,588
..we won't leave this horse.

714
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:40,689
If you're brave, fight us.

715
01:22:40,792 --> 01:22:42,259
And take it back after victory.

716
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:25,700
They made a 'Vulture Formation'.

717
01:23:25,804 --> 01:23:28,602
We'll face them with Serpent
Formation.

718
01:23:42,954 --> 01:23:44,114
Stop!

719
01:23:48,493 --> 01:23:54,193
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

720
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:58,668
Hail righteousness!

721
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,759
Attack!

722
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:06,466
Attack!

723
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:27,319
Run!

724
01:26:24,483 --> 01:26:25,643
Hail Lord Ram!

725
01:27:13,231 --> 01:27:17,861
Hail righteousness!

726
01:27:18,136 --> 01:27:21,867
Hail righteousness!

727
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,408
Hail righteousness!

728
01:27:26,678 --> 01:27:29,511
Hail righteousness!

729
01:27:30,115 --> 01:27:33,278
You kept your words by coming her e
immediately.

730
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:34,811
Thank you, friend.

731
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,285
You don't need to thank me.

732
01:27:36,688 --> 01:27:39,657
This is my duty as a friend.

733
01:27:44,162 --> 01:27:45,151
Son Ram.

734
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:50,827
Will you leave for battle without
completing the veneration?

735
01:27:51,436 --> 01:27:53,370
Yes, mother. I'm helpless.

736
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:55,866
When a brave warrior like Laxman..

737
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:58,437
..got defeated by those kids..

738
01:27:58,543 --> 01:28:03,276
..then it's futile to someone else there,
mother.

739
01:28:03,715 --> 01:28:07,742
Those kids of sage defeated our brave
warriors.

740
01:28:08,687 --> 01:28:10,086
How is it possible?

741
01:28:10,455 --> 01:28:12,685
I'm sure we're going through bad
phase.

742
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:15,182
I fear that along with me, Raghu clan's..

743
01:28:15,627 --> 01:28:18,425
..fame, pr estige and glory might
perish.

744
01:28:18,897 --> 01:28:21,730
Bless me so that I get victory, mother.

745
01:28:22,867 --> 01:28:24,198
Be victorious, son!

746
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:38,639
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord
Ram!

747
01:28:50,595 --> 01:28:54,497
Lord, please contr ol your anger!

748
01:28:54,599 --> 01:28:57,898
Your furious form is making me
r estless.

749
01:28:58,503 --> 01:29:03,634
How can I see my great kingdom's
r eputation getting defamed..

750
01:29:03,742 --> 01:29:04,731
..Hanuman?

751
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:09,306
Lord, can I go to those kids as your
messenger?

752
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:13,547
Do you want that I should compromise
with those kids?

753
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:17,618
No, king. I'm not going for
compromise.

754
01:29:17,889 --> 01:29:20,221
I want to explain to them Ram's glory!

755
01:29:20,892 --> 01:29:22,757
After all they're innocent kids.

756
01:29:23,662 --> 01:29:26,426
If they agr ee on your persuasion..

757
01:29:27,165 --> 01:29:28,291
..then I don't mind.

758
01:29:28,733 --> 01:29:30,758
But this will be the final effort.

759
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:32,566
Give me permission, Lord!

760
01:29:34,205 --> 01:29:36,196
Hail Lord Ram!

761
01:29:53,758 --> 01:29:55,316
Hail Lord Ram!

762
01:29:58,396 --> 01:30:03,129
Ram! Ram! Ram!

763
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:07,728
Ram! Ram! Ram!

764
01:30:10,742 --> 01:30:14,439
Hanuman! Hanuman, look here.

765
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:16,605
Hail Lord Ram!

766
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:29,521
Hanuman, look her e.

767
01:30:29,861 --> 01:30:31,761
First free us!

768
01:30:32,363 --> 01:30:34,558
Who are those who have revolted
against..

769
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,361
..Lord Ram in his own kingdom.

770
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:37,590
We'r e here!

771
01:30:42,407 --> 01:30:43,396
You!

772
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:47,537
You've made a grave mistake by doing
this.

773
01:30:47,912 --> 01:30:51,439
Kids, you've only seen me calm so far..

774
01:30:51,816 --> 01:30:53,249
..not my wrath!

775
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:55,449
Before I get furious..

776
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:58,351
..it will be better if you accept your
mistake.

777
01:30:58,656 --> 01:30:59,645
Or else..

778
01:31:00,492 --> 01:31:02,517
We'r e not like the demons of Lanka..

779
01:31:02,861 --> 01:31:04,192
..to get scared of you.

780
01:31:04,596 --> 01:31:07,258
Go and send your Ram here.

781
01:31:07,499 --> 01:31:09,694
Hail Lord Ram!

782
01:31:26,751 --> 01:31:33,350
''Hail peace! Tempestuous Hanuman!''

783
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:40,622
''Hail peace! Tempestuous Hanuman!''

784
01:31:53,912 --> 01:31:59,942
''Lord Hanuman, son of Lord Wind''

785
01:32:00,285 --> 01:32:07,248
''You ar e the world conquer or!''

786
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:13,359
''Hail Lord Bajrang Bali!''

787
01:32:14,432 --> 01:32:20,132
''Hail Lord Bajrang Bali!''

788
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:48,322
''You ar e benevolent one!''

789
01:32:48,633 --> 01:32:55,232
''O' friend of Lord Ram!''

790
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:02,275
''You have crossed the ocean in one
leap.''

791
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:09,309
''Even Sun seems to be tiny to you.''

792
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,787
''Your fame is spread far and wide!

793
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:15,792
Take us under your shelter.''

794
01:33:15,894 --> 01:33:22,766
''Anjani's son. You'r e devotee of Lord
Ram''

795
01:33:22,867 --> 01:33:29,636
''We pray to you day and night.''

796
01:33:29,741 --> 01:33:36,408
''Alleviate our sorrow, Hanuman.''

797
01:33:36,514 --> 01:33:41,884
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

798
01:33:43,288 --> 01:33:48,749
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

799
01:34:10,615 --> 01:34:16,451
''O' Bajrangi, always shower mercy on
us.''

800
01:34:17,388 --> 01:34:23,725
''Always keep me under your shelter.''

801
01:34:24,228 --> 01:34:30,792
''Help us to get success''

802
01:34:30,902 --> 01:34:37,808
''You ar e devotee of Lord Ram.''

803
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:44,405
''Demons and devils are scared of even
your name.''

804
01:34:44,515 --> 01:34:51,546
''Demons and devils don't dare to face
Hanuman's wrath.''

805
01:34:51,656 --> 01:34:58,357
''You chant Lord Ram's name all the
time.''

806
01:34:58,463 --> 01:35:04,868
''Ram's devotee! Have mercy on us.''

807
01:35:05,303 --> 01:35:10,673
''Anjani's son. You'r e devotee of Lord
Ram''

808
01:35:10,775 --> 01:35:18,147
''You ar e the world conquer or!''

809
01:35:18,683 --> 01:35:24,315
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

810
01:35:25,623 --> 01:35:31,323
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

811
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:38,127
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

812
01:35:39,203 --> 01:35:45,199
''Hail Bajrang Bali!''

813
01:35:47,779 --> 01:35:50,771
Ram! Ram! Ram!

814
01:36:35,593 --> 01:36:36,582
Very good.

815
01:36:39,497 --> 01:36:42,864
I praise your skill of archery.

816
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:44,862
You'r e elder to us.

817
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:48,633
We just respected you with these
arrows.

818
01:36:48,739 --> 01:36:49,899
After seeing you..

819
01:36:50,641 --> 01:36:53,166
..I forgot the task for a moment for
which I came.

820
01:36:53,711 --> 01:36:55,702
Some kids of hermitage have nabbed
the..

821
01:36:55,813 --> 01:36:57,747
..horse of my 'Ashvamedh' veneration.

822
01:36:58,182 --> 01:37:00,241
Can you take me to them?

823
01:37:00,585 --> 01:37:03,315
Those kids are in front of you.

824
01:37:03,654 --> 01:37:04,643
You two?

825
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:07,655
Sons, don't you know..

826
01:37:08,593 --> 01:37:11,221
..what did is a punishable crime?

827
01:37:11,629 --> 01:37:13,096
You'r e not our father.

828
01:37:13,464 --> 01:37:16,433
So don't call us sons.

829
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:18,191
I did n't say anything wr ong.

830
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:23,170
For a king, his entir e subject is like son.

831
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:27,274
Don't compare us with your heartless
subject.

832
01:37:27,545 --> 01:37:30,605
Hearing whatever you said about me..

833
01:37:30,715 --> 01:37:33,616
..I'm not angry, but I feel affectionate
for you.

834
01:37:35,153 --> 01:37:37,451
One who couldn't give love to one's
wife..

835
01:37:37,788 --> 01:37:39,517
..how can he love us?

836
01:37:39,857 --> 01:37:41,381
I'm surprised to hear it?

837
01:37:41,893 --> 01:37:45,659
Do you still have feelings of love in
you?

838
01:37:46,164 --> 01:37:49,156
You'r e talking of righteousness beyond
your comprehension!

839
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:52,297
Tell me, ar e you really sage's kids?

840
01:37:52,937 --> 01:37:54,905
Are you getting scared?

841
01:37:55,473 --> 01:37:57,236
We'r e really sage's kids.

842
01:37:57,875 --> 01:38:01,208
If this is the truth, then why did you
hold this horse?

843
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:03,605
By sending this horse of veneration..

844
01:38:03,714 --> 01:38:06,740
..you declared yourself to be a son of
brave mother.

845
01:38:07,485 --> 01:38:10,318
For the protection of religion by
holding it in custody..

846
01:38:10,421 --> 01:38:14,414
..we too want to declare ourselves to
be sons of brave mother.

847
01:38:14,692 --> 01:38:18,594
You yearn to fight and desir e to defeat
Ram?

848
01:38:18,863 --> 01:38:22,264
Then so be it!

849
01:38:40,918 --> 01:38:45,719
This sound.. this sound is of string of
Ram's bow.

850
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,755
He must be around.

851
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:50,558
Echo of Ram's bow!

852
01:38:51,262 --> 01:38:53,423
This means declaration of war!

853
01:38:53,531 --> 01:38:55,431
But why did it echo in our hermitage?

854
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,594
What is happening here?

855
01:38:58,135 --> 01:39:02,504
The world thinks that you bow to Lord
Ram's name.

856
01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:05,209
But hearing your praises..

857
01:39:05,309 --> 01:39:07,743
..you forgot the task for which you
came her e.

858
01:39:08,212 --> 01:39:09,543
Hail Lord Ram!

859
01:39:28,766 --> 01:39:30,131
Look there.

860
01:40:02,466 --> 01:40:04,161
For eras, for protection of religion..

861
01:40:04,268 --> 01:40:07,465
..and destruction of evil, this divine
'Narayan Arrow'..

862
01:40:07,805 --> 01:40:09,238
..will be used now.

863
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,371
It's impossible to escape it, kids.

864
01:40:11,475 --> 01:40:12,601
It's possible, Lord Ram.

865
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:14,400
Our arr ow of 'Five Elements'..

866
01:40:14,912 --> 01:40:17,142
..can make any power powerless.

867
01:40:17,248 --> 01:40:20,342
Now this divine arrow of 'Five
Elements' will decide..

868
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:23,318
..how much power Ram's name and
arr ow have!

869
01:40:25,523 --> 01:40:27,218
Hail Lord Ram!

870
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:32,288
Luva. Kusha. Heed my advice.

871
01:40:32,797 --> 01:40:35,698
And surr ender to Lord Ram.

872
01:40:36,434 --> 01:40:40,234
You don't know the consequence of
Ram's arrow.

873
01:40:40,538 --> 01:40:43,200
We heard praises of Ram's arr ow a lot.

874
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,938
Now we want to see its effect.

875
01:40:47,445 --> 01:40:48,434
Move aside.

876
01:40:48,546 --> 01:40:51,515
These kids want to fight. Get aside,
Hanuman.

877
01:41:05,129 --> 01:41:06,118
Luva. Kusha.

878
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:08,587
Sita!

879
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,225
Mother! -Mother!

880
01:41:16,941 --> 01:41:18,101
After years..

881
01:41:18,676 --> 01:41:21,668
..I'm blessed to see you again.

882
01:41:22,279 --> 01:41:23,268
What?

883
01:41:24,248 --> 01:41:25,738
Sita is our mother!

884
01:41:26,751 --> 01:41:28,616
This is the truth, my sons.

885
01:41:31,222 --> 01:41:34,749
