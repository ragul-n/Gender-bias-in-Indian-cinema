1
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,346
'Atithi Devo Bhava.'

2
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:43,941
This means, guest is God.

3
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:49,381
Guests like aunts and uncles..

4
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:50,514
..brothers-in-law and
sisters-in-laws.

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,683
Or their friends, or the
relatives of their friends.

6
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,259
These are the forms they come in.

7
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,591
The crows are the
messengers of these guests.

8
00:01:56,663 --> 00:02:01,657
And they announce the
arrival of the guests before hand.

9
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,326
''Feel at home.''

10
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:07,965
Guests are usually
welcomed home using such words.

11
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,672
Big mistake.

12
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:12,940
Because they really
start feeling at home.

13
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:15,607
ln the beginning,
we enjoy the guest's company..

14
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,444
..and the gifts
that they bring along.

15
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,452
But gradually this germ..

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,488
..slowly spreads
around our entire house.

17
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,557
Even our ancient scriptures..

18
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,592
..contain descriptions of
this inferior being, guest.

19
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,355
Mama Shakuni, Jaichand, Manthara..

20
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,523
..Musharaff, etcetera.. have
all been our esteemed guests.

21
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,724
Usually these guests appear
during Diwali, Christmas..

22
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,667
..and summer holidays.

23
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,896
But sometimes,
they arrive at any given occasion.

24
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:45,041
Scientists around the
world are still researching..

25
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:48,770
..the arrival and
departure of these beings.

26
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,746
We've learnt from reliable sources..

27
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,251
..that guests are
creatures who have..

28
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,517
..no fixed arrival
and departure time.

29
00:02:56,923 --> 00:03:00,256
That's why they're called,
'A-Tithi' (dateless).

30
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:09,992
Yes, sir. Taneja Arts Present,
'Pachaas' (Fifty ).

31
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,000
Hail Goddess.

32
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,567
Scene no. 1 . The movie begins.

33
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,298
The hero is running
covered in blood.

34
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,340
Cut to, the hero's legs,
he's running.

35
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,245
Cut to, tight close of
the hero, he's running.

36
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:22,239
Cut to side trolley,
the hero is running.

37
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:23,712
Cut to crane shot,
the hero is running.

38
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,408
Cut to, the hero's legs,
he's running.

39
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,217
Cut to, tight close of
the hero, he's running.

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,810
Cut to crane shot,
the hero is running.

41
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:30,787
Cut to side trolley,
the hero is running.

42
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:31,881
Cut to POV, the hero is running.

43
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,392
Stop it, stop it how long will
you make him run. l'm tired.

44
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,689
The hero?
- No, no not the hero, l'm tired.

45
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,594
Run ahead. l mean go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:41,767
While running he comes
in front of a shanty.

47
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,468
And knocks on the door.

48
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,841
Enough, that's all right.
What next?

49
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:53,876
What happened?
- After that.. Just a minute, sir.

50
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,473
Yes.

51
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,246
He breaks down the door.

52
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,841
The hero's deaf sister
hears the breaking of the door.

53
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,252
She sees the hero
and shrieks, ''Brother''!

54
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:03,647
The hero is about to fall..

55
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,315
..when his disabled father runs
and catches him.

56
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,756
The hero's blind brother starts
crying at the sight of blood.

57
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,292
His tears are falling.

58
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,290
The hero's elder sister
who is suffering from Polio..

59
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,799
..of both the hands
wipes his tears.

60
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,693
The hero staggers and falls
at her mute mother's feet.

61
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:23,004
And says ''Mother. Mother,
l've killed Manohar Lal''.

62
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:24,971
Hearing that,
the hero's mother says..

63
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,876
Just a minute, what is all this?

64
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,503
What kind of a family is this?

65
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:29,810
The mute mother can speak.

66
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:30,907
The deaf sister can hear.

67
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,384
The blind brother can see.
The disabled father runs.

68
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,783
The elder sister has
polio in her hands.

69
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:35,878
What is all this?

70
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,856
Oh, no, sir.
The story becomes clear..

71
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,084
..when we go into flashback.

72
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,386
Actually 15 years ago
Manohar Lal killed..

73
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,862
..the hero's sister's
insane husband..

74
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,694
..on the 50th day of their marriage,
just for 50 rupees.

75
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,357
The widowed sister
banged her hands..

76
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:50,801
..so hard on the ground
to break her bangles..

77
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,996
..that they were crippled
with polio.

78
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,737
Seeing this the mother shrieked
so loudly that she lost her voice.

79
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,675
And the shriek damaged
the eardrums of the sister.

80
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,674
Father was so shocked, that he
suffered a paralytic attack.

81
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,681
And how did the
younger brother turn blind?

82
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,913
He was blind since birth.

83
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:12,451
ls this a family or a hospital
for the deaf, dumb and disabled?

84
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,755
This is my family Taneja.

85
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,556
Oh, good family.

86
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:20,333
The public will shed tears.

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,628
The public will shed tears
when the mute mother talks.

88
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,936
l can't hear anymore.

89
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:27,600
l'll leave Taneja.

90
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,301
l can't hear any further.

91
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,638
Puneet, go for it.

92
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:33,872
Just go for it.

93
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:38,374
The mute mother's dialogue
should be mind-blowing.

94
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,509
l'm writing that, sir. l'm on it.

95
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,985
l'm leaving, Taneja.
- l'll see you out.

96
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,578
No, you remain seated and listen.

97
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:44,849
Know more about my family.

98
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:46,848
Okay. Hail Goddess.

99
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:52,721
Puneet, come on, start.
For the super-hit story.

100
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,098
Look, l completely trust
my talent and your laptop.

101
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,896
lt's almost done, sir.

102
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,534
Sir, if l could get my cheque?

103
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,332
You'll get the cheque too.
Why do you worry?

104
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,706
Actually, my mummy and
daddy are coming over.

105
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,371
l have to take them
to Ashtavinayak.

106
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,539
l have to take them
to Siddhivinayak.

107
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,049
To Shirdi, to the hospital.
- Hospital?

108
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,843
l've to get them operated.

109
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,284
Actually, mother can't see properly.

110
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,289
And father can't hear properly.

111
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,392
My family is very
similar to the don's family.

112
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,357
And then, no one gives a
concession during recession.

113
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,365
And then if you have guests,
it really makes things worse.

114
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,798
l need to show this
to the lead actor.

115
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,357
The opening shot is
scheduled for after 20 days.

116
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,834
lt's done, sir.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,697
Thank you.

118
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,801
As per 'Vaastu Shastra'
(science of architecture)..

119
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:40,312
..l want my bathroom here,
where my bedroom is. - Right.

120
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,712
And l want my bedroom here,
where my bath is. - Hello.

121
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,374
Do you get my point?
- l'll just come.

122
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,885
Are you listening J. D?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Khanna you're right.

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,978
There it is, okay.
- Yes.

124
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,488
Mrs. Khanna, last time you said..

125
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,888
..you want your bedroom
where your kitchen is.

126
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,050
Remember?
- l'll be right there.

127
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,885
You've already got it
demolished three times.

128
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,292
So what?

129
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,091
l'll keep getting it
demolished until l'm satisfied.

130
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,593
After all it's not very
often that one gets a house made.

131
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,599
Yes, but you're getting
it demolished very often.

132
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:06,230
What's breaking down?
- The house is breaking down.

133
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,631
Sorry Mrs. Khanna, gender mistake.

134
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,609
But don't worry, there won't
be any mistakes in your design.

135
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,437
Munmun will handle it.
- Okay.

136
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,777
Munmun, just give her
what she wants.

137
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:18,542
l've to rush off, my wife has
an appointment with the doctor.

138
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,713
Oh, what happened?
- Just a chronic back problem.

139
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,354
Take care. - But don't worry,
you're in safe hands.

140
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,788
She'll do a good job.
- Okay.

141
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:28,851
l'll see you. Bye. - Okay, Munmun.
Now look into this book.

142
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,418
See here.
- Yes.

143
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,489
As per page two, it says..
- Hey, Mun. Your phone is ringing.

144
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,329
Excuse me, Mrs. Khanna,
just a moment.

145
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,770
Puneet, where are you?
- l'm driving.

146
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,634
How many times have l told you..

147
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,675
..not to talk on the
phone while driving.

148
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,276
lt's a new car. Do you know
how much we'll have to pay..

149
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,834
..if you meet with an accident?

150
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,276
And if a police officer sees you..

151
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:48,405
..you'll have to pay
him a hundred rupees.

152
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:49,675
Munmun you're the
one who called me.

153
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:50,876
There were three
missed calls from you.

154
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,281
So, why did you miss my calls?

155
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:53,478
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

156
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:54,644
l told you that l was driving.

157
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,981
So, can't you answer
my call just once?

158
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,581
Sometimes you're so
irresponsible l really get worried.

159
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,594
Why did you call? - There
was a call from Ayush's school.

160
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,220
They've called us to the school.

161
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,964
Who teaches the child at home?
- We do.

162
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,833
Don't you have any
values in your family?

163
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:15,799
Your child is so poor in Hindi.

164
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,844
Please take special care
of your child's Hindi.

165
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:20,845
He has scored 10 out of 100.

166
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,341
He doesn't even know the meaning..

167
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,882
..of 'Atithi Devo
Bhava' (Guest is God).

168
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,015
Even l don't know that.

169
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,026
Now l know where the
source of this problem is.

170
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,652
lt's not right to blame the child..

171
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,559
..when the mother herself
is ignorant.

172
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,057
Goodbye.

173
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,901
What does 'Atithi Devo Bhava' mean?

174
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,603
lt means guests are like God.

175
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:48,999
Like Lord Ganesha.

176
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:52,575
What does Atithi mean?
- lt means guest.

177
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,771
Those who visit us at home.

178
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:56,609
But no one visits our home.

179
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,494
''Guest, when will you come home?''

180
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,295
Madam, l'm leaving.

181
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,861
l won't be coming tomorrow.

182
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,526
l'm expecting guests at home.
- What?

183
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:19,231
Papa, even the maid has guests.
- Yes.

184
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,363
You have a guest
everyday at your home.

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,498
You're taking so many days off.

186
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,871
Now if l have relatives,
they're bound to visit me.

187
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,602
l'm leaving.

188
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,443
They are highly
influenced by movies.

189
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,349
They don't know the
importance of guests.

190
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,714
They'll know when they have guests.

191
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,935
Papa, won't we have
a guest at home?

192
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:57,439
l planned my holidays last week.

193
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,477
Before l receive any guests..

194
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,513
..l'm going to visit
someone with my entire family.

195
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,012
Catering to guest
can be very risky.

196
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,707
l mean it.

197
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,318
Be careful.

198
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,657
''Guest, when'll you come home?''

199
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,793
''Uncle from Delhi.''

200
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,428
''Aunt from Jaunpur.''

201
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:26,904
''Rinku, Chintu. Rimjhim, Sweety.''

202
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,804
''Mother's sister or the father's.''

203
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:32,844
''When will you come?''

204
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,276
''How nice?''

205
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,249
''When will you come?''

206
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:43,683
''Guest, when'll you come home?''

207
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:57,963
''When will you come home?''

208
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,957
''Guest, when will you come home?''

209
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,524
Stand straight. Stand straight.

210
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,321
Don't move.

211
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:29,733
Another slap and you'll start
bleeding from the other ear.

212
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:30,960
lnsolent.

213
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:34,029
l asked him,
''Where does Pappu live''.

214
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,036
He says ''There's no
Pappu here, get lost''.

215
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,572
Get lost.

216
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,745
And he says, ''Why did
you call me watchman''.

217
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,872
What do you want me to call you?

218
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:42,972
Obama.

219
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,342
ls this how you talk to elders?

220
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,619
Hello.
- Your guest is here.

221
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:56,252
He slapped the watchman.

222
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,388
Do you have a father?

223
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,694
What do you call your father?

224
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,725
Papa.
- Papa. Papa.

225
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,327
Give me your papa's number..

226
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:08,568
..l'll tell him how
insolent his child is.

227
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,006
Give me his number. Come on.
- No.

228
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:13,508
Where are you going?
- l said that l made a mistake.

229
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,208
He says he's your uncle.

230
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,315
Pappu.

231
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:22,484
Pappu. Pappu.

232
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,550
Didn't you recognise me?

233
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,224
l'm uncle Lambodar, from Gorakhpur.

234
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,590
Did you recognise me now?

235
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,854
No. See that.

236
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,865
He wet my waistcloth
in Gudiya's marriage.

237
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,732
Guidya.. - From Bareilly.
Now do you recognise me?

238
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,564
Aunt Dolly's..
- Yes.

239
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,640
No, the aunt, did
you recognise me now?

240
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:47,875
l'm Putani's aunt's sister's
sister-in-law's brother-in-law.

241
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,345
Lambodar.

242
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,343
Putani?
- Your father.

243
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:55,812
Now did you recognise me?

244
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,549
Yes. Come, touch my feet.

245
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:00,248
Touch my feet. That's right.

246
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,355
This is what you called culture.

247
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,895
You should behave
properly with elders.

248
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,191
Not like you.

249
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,422
l'll slap you again.

250
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,191
Will we keep standing here?
Pick up the luggage, come on.

251
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,597
Come here.

252
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:12,998
Come here.

253
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,741
Come here.

254
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:31,814
Keep Rs.10.

255
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:32,949
Get yourself treated..

256
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,720
..and buy yourself some
milk with whatever is left.

257
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,557
Get it? Go on, be healthy.

258
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:37,954
Come on, Pappu.

259
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,759
Come on. Goodbye. Goodbye.

260
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,593
Come on. Hello.

261
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,561
Hello.

262
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,773
Who is he?
- Uncle.

263
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,534
Which uncle is he?

264
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,377
You never told me that
you have a relative in Gorakhpur.

265
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,347
Or in Jhansi.
- l didn't know myself.

266
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,476
You didn't know
about your own uncle.

267
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,650
You're so
irresponsible sometimes, Puneet.

268
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,485
lt's been 12 years
since l left Kanpur.

269
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,921
lt's been eight years
since father passed away.

270
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,254
l've never been
in touch with anyone.

271
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,692
There must be many such relatives..
- But Puneet.

272
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,689
Munmun, now he's here.

273
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,855
We can't do anything.

274
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,057
Come and meet him,
or he'll feel bad.

275
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,699
Come on.
- Come on.

276
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,463
Like this?
- Why?

277
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,030
Wear some clothes.

278
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:23,772
l'm already wearing them.
- Wear some more, please.

279
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,979
This, this one.

280
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,916
Uncle.
- Here l am, son.

281
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,980
Munmun, your daughter-in-law.

282
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,328
Hello.
- No, no.

283
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,797
You should take the
blessings of your elders.

284
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:46,923
Come touch my feet.

285
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,397
Touch my feet.

286
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,499
Bless you child, bless you.

287
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,767
Beautiful, cultured, virtuous.

288
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,072
You're like Laxmi
(Goddess of prosperity ).

289
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,846
Just like Sarla.

290
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,042
Your aunt.

291
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:09,016
You two look like Lord Shiva
and Goddess Parvati together.

292
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,587
lf only Putani had been
alive today.

293
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,359
He would've been very
happy to see you two.

294
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:19,891
Putani?
- Sorry.

295
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,425
My father.

296
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:22,793
Take a seat.

297
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,968
l'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

298
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:28,532
Really.

299
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,437
When you have your own home,
and your own wife..

300
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,569
..what else do you want in life?

301
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:43,681
ls he your own son?
- Yes, come, come Ayush.

302
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:45,715
Yes.

303
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:47,585
'Atithi Devo Bhava.'

304
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,758
Remember.
- Come, son.

305
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,987
'Guest is like God,
like Lord Ganesha.'

306
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,367
Touch his feet. Touch his feet.

307
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,966
Let it be, let it be.

308
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,970
He'll do it when he wants to.

309
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:09,440
Respect comes from education.

310
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:10,842
Be seated, l'll get tea for you.

311
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,248
No, l don't feel
like drinking tea now.

312
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,520
Uncle farted.
- Ayush.

313
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,918
Bad manners.
- Me, or uncle.

314
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:26,521
Ayush.
- He's very naughty.

315
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,360
How long does he plan to stay?
- Must be two-four days.

316
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,338
Did you make something for him?
- He's not well.

317
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:35,567
Shall l make pilaf for him?

318
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,311
Have you had a bath, Uncle?
- Yes, son.

319
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,679
l had a nice bath under the shower.

320
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,581
You have a wonderful bathroom.

321
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,012
And that soap, it smells so good.

322
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,386
l could see through it.

323
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,421
l'll go dry these clothes. Okay.

324
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,658
He used my soap.
- He used my towel also.

325
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,866
And Baba Ramdev's purgative
worked miraculously.

326
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,834
My stomach is absolutely fine now.

327
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,338
l'm really hungry, dear.

328
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:09,431
Prepare some rice and lentil
with your wonderful hands.

329
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,667
And do you have clarified butter?

330
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,478
Then make some puffed bread.

331
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:14,774
And some vegetables.

332
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,939
And if you have curd,
make some side dish.

333
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,310
And what's that called..
radish, cucumber..

334
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:21,819
Salad, salad.
- Yes, make that too.

335
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,546
Don't take too much trouble.

336
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,783
Won't you have some dessert?
- That'll be later, later.

337
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,787
Let me finish venerating first.

338
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,588
Dessert? Had this been my uncle..

339
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:33,996
..your plight would've
been worth watching.

340
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,766
Wow, the food was really delicious.

341
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,773
This has reminded me of Sarla.

342
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,001
Please have some more, Uncle.

343
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,936
We'll make something else for you.

344
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,513
l've had enough. l've had enough.

345
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,608
Dear.

346
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,685
Dear, come here,

347
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,986
Yes.

348
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,659
Here.
- Do you want something, Uncle?

349
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:08,825
No, no.

350
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,902
l've tasted daughter-in-law's
cooking for the first time.

351
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,564
lt's wrong to keep her
empty-handed.

352
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,966
Keep it, dear,
it's an auspicious gift.

353
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,638
May Goddess Annapurna
always keep you happy.

354
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,544
May no one return from your
doors with an empty stomach.

355
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,841
Keep it.

356
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,911
Ayush, what are you
looking here for?

357
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,513
Eat the bread,
come on eat the bread.

358
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,899
No, no, it's okay. Come here.

359
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:49,566
Which grade do you study in?
- Grade?

360
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,840
Fine, now tell me..

361
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:57,278
..is Delhi closer or is the moon?
- Delhi.

362
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:58,578
Wrong.

363
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:02,750
The moon is closer?
- You're lying.

364
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:05,484
Be quiet. How is that, Uncle?

365
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:09,294
Can you see Delhi?
- No.

366
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:13,957
And take a look, you
can see the moon. - Yes.

367
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,235
So which is closer?
- Moon.

368
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,764
Sorry, you'll have to sleep outside
without the air-conditioner.

369
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,909
So what? One has to adjust
when there's a guest in house.

370
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,504
lt's just a matter of few days.

371
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,576
Let him sleep in the bedroom.
We'll sleep outside.

372
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,680
Seems to be a nice man.

373
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,242
Get some room-fresheners tomorrow.

374
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:35,411
We're out of stock.
- Okay.

375
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,855
What.. what happened?

376
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:14,392
Mummy.

377
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,859
Ayush, when did he come here?

378
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:20,829
He must've come here at night.

379
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,535
What kind of sound
is that, take a look.

380
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:28,731
No, son it's alright.

381
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,867
l think some wild
animal has barged in. - Yes.

382
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,241
lts okay, Ayush.

383
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:35,371
lt must be a wild animal.

384
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,019
What happened?

385
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:54,495
Uncle is gargling.
- Gargle?

386
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:59,861
At midnight?
- lt isn't even 5:45.

387
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,634
People wake up early in the village.

388
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,572
Just to gargle?
- Yes.

389
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:12,445
They have early breakfast too.
- What?

390
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,685
Mun. - Yes. - Have you finished
Mrs. Khanna's design?

391
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,353
No, l'm still working on it.

392
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,590
What happened? All is well.

393
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,997
Puneet's uncle is visiting us.

394
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,463
And you know what happens
when there's a guest at home.

395
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,038
He gets up at 5:30 in the morning.

396
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:35,638
And needs breakfast readied at 6:30.

397
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,800
That too, after having a bath.

398
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,433
Otherwise it's
supposed to be inauspicious.

399
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,372
Really?
- Yes.

400
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:41,637
ln his village, daughter-in-law's..

401
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,272
..can't enter the kitchen
without having a bath.

402
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:44,840
You're done for, Mun.

403
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,612
Munmun, finalise this.
- Yes.

404
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,313
l'm going to see the doctor,
will see you later.

405
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:52,289
What happened? - The same old
chronic back problem of my wife.

406
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,550
Finalise this.

407
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,855
Mun, don't you feel
that J. D's wife..

408
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,331
..is spending more time
with the doctor than with J.D.

409
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,694
By the way, do you know..

410
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,499
..where l can find 'Singhada' flour.

411
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:09,968
'Singhada'? What is that?
- l don't know.

412
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,767
But, uncle wants to eat
bread made of that flour.

413
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:13,637
Can you believe it?

414
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:19,948
Maid, Sweep that corner. That one.

415
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:31,719
Here.

416
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,262
Here.

417
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:43,635
Go on.

418
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:47,234
You can go further ahead,
inside. Go on.

419
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,343
Yes.

420
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,015
Yes. lt's done.
- Done.

421
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:59,247
Now the clothes.
- l've already washed them.

422
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:00,348
You've washed them?
- Yes.

423
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:01,950
Fine, now let's wash them properly.

424
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,752
Come on.

425
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,524
Puneet, hail the Goddess.
- Hail the Goddess.

426
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,533
What's going on?
- Yes sir, l'm on it.

427
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:10,793
l've finished till interval.

428
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,531
lf you've finished the interval,
then, reach the end too.

429
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,207
There's just 15 days
left for the opening take.

430
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:18,573
lf the script isn't ready, our
hero won't come for the shoot.

431
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:19,804
Son, Mahabharat.

432
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:21,743
Daddy, l'm talking on
the phone can't you see?

433
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:23,339
How are mummy-daddy?

434
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:24,939
Don't worry about mummy-daddy.

435
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:26,309
Just think about the script.

436
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,477
When will you give me the script?

437
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:29,621
l'm on it, sir, l'm on it.

438
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,622
Hail the Goddess. - Son,
please switch on Mahabharat now.

439
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,352
Daddy, ever since the
both of you have arrived..

440
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,723
..you've been
watching live Mahabharat.

441
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:36,954
Why do you want to see
it on television now?

442
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,827
Oh, God. What are
both of you up to now?

443
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,525
You don't even let me
apply make-up.

444
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,961
What are you doing, son?

445
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,570
Uncle, l'm working.
- Working?

446
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:49,898
What do you do?
- l'm a writer.

447
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,470
That's okay, but.. what do you do?

448
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:58,279
l write stories.
- Wow, even l write stories.

449
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:02,511
But how do you earn a living?

450
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:07,491
Uncle, l write stories for movies.
- Wow.

451
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,591
How nice, how nice.

452
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,925
Go on, go on work
with concentration. - Yes.

453
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,557
Wow. Very good. Movie stories.

454
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:21,736
Pappu, do you know him..
that movie actor.. - No, no.

455
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:25,607
He's very tall.
He hails from our village.

456
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:28,805
Mr. Amitabh, Mr. Amitabh.
- Yes, Amitabh.

457
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:31,974
And, Dharmendra, do
you know Dharmendra.

458
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,383
No, l only work with
the recent actors.

459
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,054
The actors these
days are not worth it.

460
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,020
The real actors were
the ones in our era.

461
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,586
Dilip Kumar. 'Ganga Jamuna'.

462
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:47,428
Bharat Bhushan,
Rajendra Kumar. Dharmendra.

463
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,591
Wow.

464
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,329
Tall and a broad chest.

465
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:54,338
And lots of chest hair. Chest hair.

466
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,498
lf the fly enters in there,
it won't find his way out.

467
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:57,701
And die right there.

468
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,108
The actors these
days aren't like that.

469
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,538
They shave their chest.

470
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,648
Clean shaven.

471
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,776
Like they've made it into a runway.

472
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,510
You can't call them actors.

473
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:10,714
And the actresses.

474
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,420
You get speechless.

475
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:19,724
Sadhna, Vaijanti Mala,
Asha Parekh, Padmini.

476
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,063
From top to bottom,
they look exactly the same.

477
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:27,466
And they can sit in one
place and sing the entire song.

478
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,004
At one place.

479
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,935
They were so cultured.

480
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,809
Hello, there are prayers going on.

481
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,606
l should send uncle,
right now. Okay, okay.

482
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:35,805
Uncle, there are prayers going on.
Downstairs in the building.

483
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,712
Would you like to go? - Fine, fine,
l'll be right back from the prayers.

484
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,808
Later, l'll tell you a
story about Vaijanti Mala.

485
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,410
Yes, yes.
- About Vaijanti Mala.

486
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,661
This is wrong, l'm
completely against it.

487
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,797
ls this our culture?

488
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,463
Who is he?
- He's our writer's uncle. - Oh.

489
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,335
Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,699
As long as we play devotional
songs from these gadgets..

491
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,677
..the Goddess will never be pleased.

492
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:43,476
The discourses should
come from your heart.

493
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:45,877
Until you don't chant
the discourses..

494
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:47,417
..Goddess will never be pleased.

495
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,042
We already told them..

496
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:52,548
..that this latest technology
shouldn't be in the temple.

497
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:55,520
Of course. - The drums and the
flute are all lying is ready.

498
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,822
But who will sing?

499
00:26:56,895 --> 00:27:02,026
As long there's devotion,
and love for Goddess..

500
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:03,859
..in our hearts, anyone can sing.
- Yes.

501
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:05,928
Come on, l will sing. Play it.

502
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:12,773
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

503
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:17,871
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

504
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:29,257
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

505
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:37,334
''This world.. is a quagmire.''

506
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:39,532
''This world is a quagmire.''

507
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:43,802
''Goddess will relieve
everyone of their troubles.''

508
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,408
''This world is a quagmire.''

509
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:50,574
''Goddess will relieve
everyone of their troubles.''

510
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:57,913
''Come and take the
Goddess's blessings.''

511
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,224
''Come in the temple and
take the Goddess's offerings.''

512
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:05,491
''Come in the temple and
take the Goddess's offerings.''

513
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:10,293
''lgnite the flame..
- lgnite it.''

514
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,634
''Of faith in Goddess.''

515
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,467
''The Goddess will be with you.''

516
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,271
''lgnite the light of
faith in Goddess.''

517
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,382
''The Goddess will be with you.''

518
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:30,981
''The hearts are
withering with sufferings.''

519
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,688
''The hearts are
withering with sufferings.''

520
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,390
''Goddess, you're the soothing rain.''

521
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:46,398
''lgnite the light of
faith in Goddess.''

522
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,905
''The Goddess will be with you.''

523
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,005
''This world is a quagmire.''

524
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,911
''Goddess will relieve
everyone of their troubles.''

525
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:59,715
''Come and take the
Goddess's blessings.''

526
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:02,913
''Come to the temple and
take the Goddess's offerings.''

527
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:07,254
''Come in the temple and
take the Goddess's offerings.''

528
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:15,823
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

529
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,860
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

530
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:32,681
''Why are you.. away from Goddess?''

531
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,680
''Why are you away
from the Goddess?''

532
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,586
''What mistake has she made?''

533
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:43,421
''The Goddess is
calling out to her devotees.''

534
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,931
''She's waiting to anoint you.''

535
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:50,934
''She's calling out to you,
she's calling out to you.''

536
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:55,962
''She's waiting, she's
waiting to anoint you.''

537
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:05,006
''Grace your forehead with
the colour of her name.''

538
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,352
''Then Goddess is with you.''

539
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,925
''Grace your forehead with
the colour of her name.''

540
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,786
''Then the Goddess
will be with you.''

541
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,031
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

542
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,029
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

543
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:37,638
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

544
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:45,520
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

545
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,683
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

546
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:50,294
''Glory to.. the Goddess.''

547
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,055
''Glory to..''

548
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:55,760
What happened?

549
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,833
What happened?

550
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,361
What happened?
- Papa.

551
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:00,734
l got a catch in my back.
- Back. - Yes.

552
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:03,000
Move back, move back.
- Why?

553
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,333
Move back.
- Why?

554
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,343
One kick will make everything fine?
- Kick?

555
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,208
Kick? Kick?
- Why will you kick him?

556
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,804
lt's a very ingenious treatment.

557
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:11,213
lf you get a catch in your back..

558
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,614
..let a man who's
born backwards kick you.

559
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,277
What is he saying?
- lt gets cured.

560
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,583
l was born backwards,
but you stand straight.

561
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:19,317
Okay. Fine.
- Sure? - Sure, sure.

562
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,585
Strand straight, stand straight.

563
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,217
Don't move.
- Kick slowly.

564
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,387
One, two, three.

565
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:25,923
Are you alright?
- Papa, papa.

566
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:27,422
ls it okay?

567
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:28,791
There you go.

568
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,357
Wow, uncle!

569
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:33,300
Wow, uncle!

570
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,301
Does anyone else have backache?

571
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,603
No, no.
- Does anyone?

572
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:48,813
Hello. What time
does doctor uncle kick?

573
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,615
10-11 in the morning,
and 5-6 in the evening.

574
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,249
l don't believe this.

575
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,686
How can a kick cure back problems?

576
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:57,853
l'm telling you, people
stand in long queues..

577
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,453
..outside the house to get kicked.

578
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,761
Yes, baby, don't worry
l'll sue the doctor.

579
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,460
Absolutely, l'm coming.

580
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,696
Why is J. D always so tensed?

581
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,465
His wife's back-problem.

582
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:08,767
lt's giving a lot of problem.

583
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,809
ln fact Mun, why don't
you recommend uncle?

584
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:23,345
Baby please, just one kick
for my sake. - No. - Madam.

585
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:24,848
Ma'am, just one kick.

586
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:25,981
And your pain will be gone forever.

587
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,418
Come on, come on, uncle.

588
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,017
One, two, three.

589
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:33,788
Baby. Baby, you okay?

590
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,324
Baby.

591
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,867
Yes, baby dear. Does it still pain?

592
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:42,932
l don't know about the pain,
but she doesn't have teeth.

593
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:48,374
lts okay, it's okay.

594
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:49,841
l'll have to kick again.

595
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:53,246
Stand up, stand up.
- Baby.

596
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:59,917
What is this?
- Sir, your wife's teeth.

597
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,955
Not that, this. What is this?
- Bedroom, sir.

598
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,594
No, what is this?
- Mrs. Khanna's design.

599
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:08,656
You sent this design to Mrs. Khanna.
- Yes.

600
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,828
She wanted the bedroom
in place of the bathroom.

601
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,698
You moved the bedroom in
place of the kitchen instead.

602
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:15,304
Sir, there was so much confusion,
she kept changing..

603
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:18,570
Confusion.
Why don't you do one thing?

604
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,205
Why don't you ask your
uncle to construct it?

605
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,643
l'm sure he'd also be
an interior designer..

606
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,009
..besides being a doctor.

607
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,813
Sorry, sir.
- You better be.

608
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,786
And if you can't do it properly,
l'll ask someone else.

609
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:31,885
There are thousands
of designers around.

610
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:33,615
Yes.

611
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,286
And they wouldn't
have any uncle either.

612
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,388
Go on.
- Sorry.

613
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,363
Baby.

614
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:51,502
lt's okay.

615
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,375
l just can't handle the pressure.

616
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,040
Firstly, Mrs. Khanna changes the
plan everyday and confuses me.

617
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:00,943
And l don't get enough sleep either.

618
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,887
l can't sleep outside in
this summer without the AC.

619
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:05,849
And then uncle wakes me up..

620
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:07,323
..at 6 o'clock in the morning
with his gargling.

621
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,559
Then prepare his breakfast,
his lunch.

622
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:10,820
Go home and teach Ayush.

623
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,487
l just can't cope up, you know.

624
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:15,764
Didn't l tell you, guests
are good only for a few days?

625
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,661
By the way, when is
your uncle leaving?

626
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,566
God only knows. lt's been 12 days,
he should leave now.

627
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,610
Hey, hey.. here, under the table.

628
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:40,049
And listen, sweep it properly.

629
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,054
Don't dust it in the air.
Sweep properly.

630
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:52,096
You missed that corner.

631
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,635
That corner.

632
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:58,866
Bend down.

633
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:01,573
lt will go further in.

634
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:02,738
lt will go further.

635
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,940
That's it, just stretch your hand.

636
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,881
Maid, l can see it from here.

637
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,282
Get it out.

638
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:15,819
Madam!

639
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:17,827
Madam!
- What happened?

640
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,295
What? What happened?

641
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,698
l don't want to work.
- Why?

642
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,460
As long as this uncle is at home,
l don't want to work.

643
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:25,928
But what's wrong?

644
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:29,963
Your maid is lazybones.

645
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,674
You called me lazybones.
- Yes.

646
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:34,374
Do l look like l'm lazybones?

647
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:36,675
Do l look like l'm lazybones?

648
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,978
l might look like one, but l'm not.

649
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,011
Look, Manda, you..
- No, you watch.

650
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:44,787
Wonder where you got
this guest from?

651
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,284
He stands on my head..

652
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:48,086
..and makes me sweep
the entire house.

653
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,418
Sweep the dirt from this corner.

654
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:50,756
Sweep the dirt from that corner.

655
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,827
l'm a maid after all, not a rat..

656
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:55,798
..that l'd go to every
corner and sweep it clean.

657
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:59,899
He makes me wash the
clothes three times over.

658
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,464
l've been working in this
house for the past three years.

659
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:03,899
Have you ever said anything to me?

660
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,408
Have you ever said anything to me?
- Look Manda..

661
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:06,808
Yes, yes.

662
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:09,269
She steals the cream from the milk.

663
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:11,945
She steals tea leaves, sugar.

664
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,577
She steals spoons and bowls,
and takes it with her. Don't you.

665
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:19,885
Oh, God. You called me a thief.
Thief. - Yes, l did.

666
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,316
Do l look like a thief?

667
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,787
Do l look like a thief?

668
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:24,988
l look like a thief, but l'm not.

669
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,730
But now l don't want
to work in this house.

670
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:30,390
As long as this old
man is in this society..

671
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,662
..l won't work in this house.

672
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:34,364
And, l won't let
anyone work either.

673
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,497
Manda.
- l'm leaving.

674
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:37,268
Yes, fine let her go, dear.
- Manda, listen to me.

675
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:38,434
Dear, l'll do the sweeping.

676
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,703
Dear, don't worry
l'll do it. lsn't it?

677
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,006
Lazybones.

678
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,315
That corner.
- Yes, l will.

679
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:48,745
What's there to laugh about?

680
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,319
Who will do the
household chores now?

681
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,514
You or your uncle?

682
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,546
With great difficulty
l had found a maid..

683
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,717
..but he made her leave.

684
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,316
Do you realise what he has done?

685
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,621
He turned the maid out.

686
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,094
Do you know the importance
of a maid in a woman's life?

687
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:01,558
l know, l know.

688
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,664
A woman can live
without her husband..

689
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:04,827
..but not without the maid.

690
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:06,962
You can find another husband.

691
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:10,336
But a maid..
He turned the maid out.

692
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:13,341
l'm not going to cook for him.

693
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,469
Order from the hotel.

694
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,947
We've already eaten five
times from the hotel this time.

695
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:18,440
We've already spent a lot.

696
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,645
Then, we'll have
'Pav-bhaji' on the streets.

697
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,049
But l'm not cooking for him.

698
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,755
Okay.
- Okay.

699
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,527
Son, this is a heavy snack.

700
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,723
Hey, give me some butter.

701
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,631
No, no, don't be a miser.

702
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,962
Daughter-in-law.

703
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:42,598
Cook something light for dinner.

704
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,799
Lentil, rice,
flatbread, few vegetables.

705
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,810
And we'll have dessert later.

706
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:56,582
Oh, God what has happened?

707
00:37:56,988 --> 00:38:00,287
The stomach is feeling so heavy.

708
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,792
He seems to have cooked in
cheap oil instead of butter.

709
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,022
Uncle, take this medicine.

710
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:08,329
No, no, Uncle. This is gas.

711
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,025
Let it flow, don't try to stop it.

712
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,793
You've been passing wind since
morning. Please take this medicine.

713
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,462
How long will he keep doing this?

714
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,371
As long there's air
in the atmosphere..

715
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,007
..it will.. go on.

716
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,041
That's why l'm saying,
take this medicine.

717
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,047
l can't take it, son.
- Why can't you take it?

718
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,379
l mean, why can't you take it,
Uncle?

719
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,613
l'm a vegetarian.

720
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,756
And this contains the
fat and bones of animals.

721
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,824
l can't take it. Cow urine.

722
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,424
Cow what?

723
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,018
Get me some cow urine.
- Cow urine.

724
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,360
Get me some urine
from a black cow..

725
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:41,625
..and everything will be fine.

726
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:42,891
And bring a fresh sample.

727
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:45,632
Otherwise, its effect
wears off in half an hour.

728
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:46,963
Bring it fresh.

729
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:48,965
ln half an hour?

730
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,972
ls it cow urine, or pizza?

731
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,704
This bus will take you on
a tour of entire Mumbai..

732
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:55,870
..and drop you back here.

733
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:57,312
There's fried flatbread
and pickles in this. - Fine.

734
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:59,282
Take a good look around. And
come back in the evening. - Fine.

735
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:00,942
Okay, okay.

736
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,217
Yes, Mun.

737
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,520
Yes, l made him board it. Now,
l can comfortably work on my script.

738
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,288
l have to deliver it this evening.

739
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:26,668
Son, l'm standing right
outside Amitabh Bachchan's house.

740
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:29,845
People say that he comes
out and waves his hands.

741
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:32,238
He hasn't come out yet.

742
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,345
He's here, he's here.

743
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,512
He's waving.

744
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,485
He has very long hands, son.

745
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:42,287
May God bless him with prosperity.

746
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:43,951
Uncle, disconnect the phone
and wave back at him.

747
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:46,292
Wave back with both your hands.
Disconnect the phone. - Yes.

748
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,299
l did, l did.

749
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,893
Return my phone.
You've used up all the balance.

750
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,426
Pappu.

751
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,027
You'll get the photo
in a minute, sir.

752
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:30,336
They're charging me
Rs.50 for a photograph.

753
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:32,372
But in the village
they charge only 10.

754
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,434
What should l do?
Should l pay them?

755
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:35,876
Get a big photograph.

756
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,379
Just a minute. Talk to
this gentleman here.

757
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,574
Who is it?
- My nephew, he's a writer. Pappu.

758
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:51,352
How many times will you call me?

759
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:54,296
You're troubling me.
- Why shouldn't l call?

760
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:56,797
You've switched off your mobile.

761
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,396
Listen to me.

762
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:00,936
Tomorrow is the opening shot.

763
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:03,739
When will you give me the script?
- Hello.

764
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:04,934
Hello.
- The hero is asking for the script..

765
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:07,307
Hello, your voice..
- You can't hear me.

766
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:08,937
Hello. Hello.

767
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:10,939
Hail the Goddess.

768
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:25,889
Pappu.

769
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:27,859
Son, it's me.

770
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,966
Lambodar.

771
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,834
Your uncle.
- Uncle, it's you.

772
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,701
You're back so soon.
- Son, there was nothing left to see.

773
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:36,467
And do you know who l ran into?

774
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:39,840
Just a minute. Dukhbhajan.
Dukhbhajan.

775
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,673
That's him. My friend.

776
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,647
He runs a blouse and
petticoat shop in my village.

777
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,411
Ranjan. Open it.

778
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:48,679
Ranjan. Yes.

779
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,378
He runs a footwear shop.

780
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,686
And he's Manoranjan.
- Niranjan.

781
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:55,623
Niranjan. He works in a bank.

782
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:56,785
He stays here.

783
00:41:57,662 --> 00:41:59,596
Look l follow only one principle.

784
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,793
Greet everyone with a smile.

785
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,265
One should never
fall short of friends.

786
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,460
Come on, come in.

787
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:05,968
Come on in, it's my Pappu's house.

788
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:07,603
Come in. Come Niranjan.

789
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,964
And there's such
a wonderful bathroom.

790
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,500
Go and wash up..

791
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,704

will cook for everyone.

792

Where are you?
- ln Buddha Garden.

793
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,674
Four of your fiendish
relatives are sitting here..

794

..and l have to cook for them.

795
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,308
And you're strolling
in the Buddha Garden.

796
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,535
l'm not taking a stroll.
- Then what else are you doing?

797
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:49,671

802
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:58,717

And, daughter-in-law.

Cardamom.

822
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:35,316
Did you hear?

Did you hear the menu?

824
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:37,755
l'm not cooking.

825
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:39,728
Then don't cook
but don't trouble me.

826
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,956
What should l do?

827
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,562
Uncle has been
troubling me since morning..

828
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,760
..Taneja is after me, and now you.

829
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,361
Look, don't trouble me.

830
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,869
l don't know about you,
but l will commit suicide right now.

831
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:51,772
l will commit suicide.

832
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:53,771
Hey..

833
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,238
Get lost from here, get lost.

834
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:00,410
You're not allowed to
commit suicide here.

835
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,314
Go on, go. - Sir, please leave me
alone, l'm working.

836
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:03,546
What should l do?

837
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:05,349
Get lost quietly.

838
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:06,783
Or else l will put you behind bars.

839
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:08,555
And you'll have to stay
in the lock up all night.

840
00:44:08,693 --> 00:44:10,820
Puneet, hello. Talk to me.

841
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,419
And you can sit in there and work.

842
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,363
Come on.

843
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,964
What's going on there?
- l'm getting arrested.

844
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:18,629
Hey..

845
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:20,265
What?

846
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,980
Hey man, are you chatting?
- No.

847
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,314
Log on to 'Savita
bhabhi' (sister-in-law Savita).

848
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,047
'Savita bhabhi'.
- 'Savita bhabhi'.

849
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,016
Open it.

850
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:45,094
lnspector.

851
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,800
No one has ever been to the
police station from my family.

852
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,027
And you spent an entire
night in the police station.

853
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,927
The entire society knows
that you were arrested.

854
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:54,596
And they think you
misbehaved with a girl.

855
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,368
What? - How else would l
have completed my script?

856
00:44:57,441 --> 00:44:58,499
lt was a self-arrest.

857
00:44:58,576 --> 00:44:59,770
Whom will you explain?

858
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:00,968
All because of uncle.

859
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:02,678
l told you, today is
uncle's last day here.

860
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,345
l'll make him board
the train tomorrow.

861
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:07,981
But Puneet.. - Munmun, it's
the day of my opening shot.

862
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,610
Don't spoil my mood today.
- Mummy.

863
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,655
Take uncle along for
the opening shot. Ayush.

864
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:14,554
What? What will he do there?

Bigger than you?

Wrong, he can't be greater than you?

946
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,868
A dacoit like Gabbar would
send you out for looting.

947
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:26,375
He can't be greater than you.

948
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:28,570
And yes, he would ask you.

949
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,375

''How many were they?
- Two.''

966
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,820
And we're three,
yet we're urinating.

967
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:20,458
His contribution to the
lndian cinema has been..

968
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:22,329
Where did he go?

969
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,529
Puneet l'm fed up of your uncle.

He has troubled me a lot.

977
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:06,869
lf you find him anywhere?

978
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,945
Okay, everyone silence please.

00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,230
Sir, you didn't ask me

1016
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,343

1017
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:22,735

00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:40,796
Who asked you to say two?

1025

lt isn't my mistake.

1026
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:43,693
The old man has been
troubling me since.

1027

He's been asking
''How many were they?''

''How many were they?''
So l said two.

1029

Couldn't you say something else?

1030
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:49,833
Why did you have to say two?

1031
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:51,500
Where is that old man?
Which old man?

1032
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:52,769
He's standing right there.
- This old man?

00:54:02,753 --> 00:54:04,653
Who is Pappu on this set?
- Pappu.

1039
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:06,814
Who is Pappu?
- There he is.

1040
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:09,683
Puneet, you didn't
tell me you're Pappu.

1041
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,954
And he's with you.

1042
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:14,956
He's my uncle, sir.
- lf he's your uncle..

1043
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,363
..is he attending my
wedding procession here?

1044
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:19,368
Am l getting married?
Are we playing the bands?

1045
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,467
He destroyed a set
worth Rs.50 lakh.

1046
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:27,303
Who will pay for the
reconstruction of the sets? Him?

1047
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:29,874
Do you know how much
money Rs.50 lakh is?

1048
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:31,073
Have you ever seen it?

1049
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:36,645
They come here to eat for
free at film parties, beggars.

1050
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,018
Sir. Please, sir, don't abuse him.

1051
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,050
He's an elderly man, l apologise.

1052
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:44,919
He's like a father.

1053
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,587
Your father could have
made such a mistake as well.

1054
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:49,359
lf he's like your father,
then keep him at home.

1055
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:52,433
Why bring him to the shoot to..
- Sir.

1056
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,631
No need to abuse him.

1057
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:58,533
lf you say another word..
- What will you do?

1058
00:54:58,842 --> 00:54:59,900
What will you do?

1059
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,372
Are you threatening me?

1060
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:02,772
Do you know your stature?

1061
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,346
You're an ordinary writer,
trying to threaten me.

1062
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:07,244
l'm throwing you out
of the film right now.

1063
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:10,011
Now come to my office to collect the
cheque. Come if you have the guts.

1064
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:11,720
l'll give you nothing.

1065
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:13,714
Who do you think you are?

1066
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,315
You're locking horns
with me.. for this old man.

1067
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:17,655
You're putting your career at stake.

1068
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:19,761
l'll see who gives you
work in the industry.

1069
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,590
Security, throw the old man out.

1070
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:24,599
Throw him out.
- Hey..

1071
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:27,900
No one touches him!

1072
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:38,779
Let's go, Uncle.

1073
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,724
Pack up.

1074
00:56:08,986 --> 00:56:12,251
Hail Goddess.

1075
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:21,095
So, Uncle, how are you?

1076
00:56:21,565 --> 00:56:23,658
How are you, dear?

1077
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:28,093
Do l look like your daughter?
- Do l look like your uncle?

1078
00:56:28,506 --> 00:56:30,064
Have you ever seen yourself?

1079
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:32,666
You look like a grandma,
great grandma in fact.

1080
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:35,741
You don't have much time to live.

1081
00:56:35,946 --> 00:56:37,937
You're walking towards your grave.

1082
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:40,176
See that, she calls me uncle.

1083
00:56:40,351 --> 00:56:43,013
That's wrong,
Sister. Uncle is so young.

1084
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,988
Be quiet or
else l'll call your papa.

1085
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,487
What's the matter?
- See that.

1086
00:56:51,562 --> 00:56:55,020
Whenever we meet, all he says is,
''l'll call your papa''.

1087
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:57,124
He's so short-tempered.

1088
00:56:57,201 --> 00:57:00,364
He has high-blood pressure.
And has ordered for fritters.

1089
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:04,033
You people really lose
your mind after a certain age.

1090
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:05,939
Nothing's wrong with him.

1091
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:07,305
After what he did
yesterday at the opening shot..

1092
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:09,936
..he doesn't have the
courage to say anything.

1093
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:12,048
He didn't even gargle this morning.

1094
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:13,981
And l didn't wake up.

1095
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,211
l was sleeping.

1096
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:16,583
Now you better wake up.

1097
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:18,281
You've lost the film already.

1098
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:22,185
Before you lose anything
else ask him to leave, please.

1099
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:24,553
See there he is.

1100
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:26,721
Please. Please do something.

1101
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,056
Okay.

1102
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:35,999
You're back, Uncle.

1103
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,365
Come.

1104
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:01,889
Listen, Pappu.
l need to talk to you.

1105
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:06,299
l want to talk to you too.
- No, listen to me first.

1106
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:10,936
Look, what happened
yesterday wasn't my mistake.

1107
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:14,010
l didn't do it intentionally.

1108
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:16,113
l swear on Sarla, really.

1109
00:58:16,947 --> 00:58:20,314
We hail from small villages, son.

1110
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:23,543
We don't know how to
behave with influential people.

1111
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:26,579
l don't have any children.

1112
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:28,716
But after staying with you
people for so many days..

1113
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:32,554
..l felt that you aren't
Putani's son, but mine.

1114
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,593
And.. l couldn't control
myself seeing you happy.

1115
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,999
And.. l made this mistake.

1116
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:43,301
Please don't be angry with me.

1117
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:46,738
lf you want l'm ready
to fall at his feet.

1118
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,936
But please forgive me.

1119
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,311
What are you doing, Uncle?

1120
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:55,042
lf my father had made the
same mistake that you did..

1121
00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:57,349
..would he apologise to me?

1122
00:58:57,621 --> 00:59:00,112
Or would l let him apologise?

1123
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:05,219
With your blessings,
l'll find more work.

1124
00:59:08,933 --> 00:59:10,594
Just like Putani.

1125
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:13,228
Putani had the same thinking.

1126
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,036
Really.

1127
00:59:15,673 --> 00:59:18,437
Pappu hasn't changed
after coming to the city.

1128
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,644
l'll tell everyone when
l go back to the village?

1129
00:59:21,912 --> 00:59:24,039
When will you go back?
- l mean, when will you go back?

1130
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:26,609
Tell me in advance, because..

1131
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:28,584
..we need to book the
ticket two months in advance.

1132
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,382
Yes son, l will tell you
two months in advance.

1133
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,083
l won't trouble you anymore.

1134
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:37,218
Daughter-in-law,
l've brought sweets.

1135
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:39,455
Make me a cup of tea.

1136
00:59:44,635 --> 00:59:50,733
''l've lost my peace.''

1137
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:57,175
''l've lost all my happiness.''

1138
00:59:57,481 --> 01:00:08,722
''Look how sad you've
made us that we're crying.''

1139
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:16,623
''l wonder when you'll leave.''

1140
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:31,415
''The pleasant night
has passed away.''

1141
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:37,076
''Wonder when you'll leave.''

1142
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:44,261
''The pleasant night
has passed away.''

1143
01:00:44,395 --> 01:00:49,992
''Wonder when you'll leave.''

1144
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:56,103
''l've lost my peace.''

1145
01:00:56,173 --> 01:01:00,576
''l've lost all my happiness.''

1146
01:01:01,045 --> 01:01:10,147
''Look how sad you've
made us that we're crying.''

1147
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:15,055
''Wonder when you'll leave.''

1148
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:22,564
''The pleasant night
has passed away.''

1149
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:28,500
''Wonder when you'll leave.''

1150
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:53,028
''Will you like it
if l murder you?''

1151
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:59,669
''Don't test my patience.''

1152
01:01:59,737 --> 01:02:04,572
''Don't interfere in everything.''

1153
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:14,246
''What if l murder you?''

1154
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:16,411
''When will you go?''

1155
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,251
''Please let me know.''

1156
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,689
''When will you go?''

1157
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:24,459
''Do let me know.''

1158
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:29,090
''l wonder when you'll leave.''

1159
01:02:35,072 --> 01:02:37,199
''When will you leave?''

1160
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:43,008
''The pleasant night
has passed away.''

1161
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:48,173
''Wonder when you'll leave.''

1162
01:02:49,753 --> 01:02:56,022
''The pleasant night
has passed away.''

1163
01:02:56,093 --> 01:03:01,360
''l wonder when you'll leave.''

1164
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:05,134
''Guest, when will you leave?''

1165
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:19,141
You ape, you've come here to die.

1166
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:24,077
Commander, kill him.

1167
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:27,423
Pardon me, brother.

1168
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,089
He's our guest.

1169
01:03:32,162 --> 01:03:35,325
And we should show respect
to our guests, not disrespect.

1170
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,060
Vibhishan, sit down.

1171
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:43,367
He's not a guest.

1172
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,705
This guest has
devastated my Ashoka gardens.

1173
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:49,275
He trampled the delicate flowers..

1174
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:50,676
..of my beautiful Mandodari.

1175
01:03:51,281 --> 01:03:56,480
He killed my soldiers and
created havoc in entire Lanka.

1176
01:03:57,054 --> 01:03:59,352
He has made my life hell.

1177
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:02,389
First the soap,
towel, bathroom, bedroom..

1178
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:05,019
..and now he has taken
over the entire house.

1179
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,222
Keeps the television switched on
all night and doesn't let us sleep.

1180
01:04:07,297 --> 01:04:11,199
Pappu. - ln the morning he
wakes us up with his gargling.

1181
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:14,965
He has created havoc in the whole
house by constantly breaking wind.

1182
01:04:19,576 --> 01:04:21,942
l lost my work, l lost my maid, .

1183
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:25,606
..and you want me to
show respect to the guest.

1184
01:04:26,183 --> 01:04:27,582
Sorry, Puneet.

1185
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:29,543
What do you say, Mandodari?

1186
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,350
Don't you know anything?

1187
01:04:32,422 --> 01:04:34,049
You're so irresponsible, you know.

1188
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,620
Teach this guest a lesson..

1189
01:04:37,694 --> 01:04:40,254
..so that he never visits
anyone as a guest again.

1190
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,729
He's a sinner.

1191
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:46,959
Okay. Soldier, set his tail on fire.

1192
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:49,595
Pappu. Pappu.

1193
01:04:51,608 --> 01:04:54,771
Pappu, what are you doing?

1194
01:04:58,615 --> 01:04:59,980
Cut, cut, cut.

1195
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:03,252
How did Hanuman's tail come off?

1196
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,221
l've been asking for the past
three days to get a new tail.

1197
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,484
l've been working
with Sugreev's tail.

1198
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:08,923
What? Sugreev's tail?
- Yes.

1199
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,960
Production.
- Yes, sir.

1200
01:05:11,028 --> 01:05:12,086
l'll call you later.

1201
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,426
Where is Hanuman's tail?
- Sir, rats chewed it to shreds.

1202
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,295
You people are just..

1203
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:17,731
Get another tail quickly.

1204
01:05:17,968 --> 01:05:19,458
We have to send this episode.
lt is to be aired tomorrow.

1205
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:20,594
Yes, sir.
- l'll do it right now, sir.

1206
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:21,933
What should l do now, sir?

1207
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:23,063
You take a break.

1208
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,573
Take a close of Ravan's face.

1209
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,074
Excuse me.

1210
01:05:28,378 --> 01:05:30,346
Here, wipe it.
- Thank you.

1211
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,539
Hi, Puneet.
- Hi.

1212
01:05:32,616 --> 01:05:34,311
Hello, Sister-in-law.

1213
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:36,613
Hey, Ayush.

1214
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,284
He insisted on
watching Hanuman's shooting.

1215
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:41,221
You did the right
thing by coming here.

1216
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,282
So Puneet,
where are you these days?

1217
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:45,019
What happened about
your film with Taneja?

1218
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:46,289
Any problems?

1219
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:51,300
l heard that a guest of yours
blew up a set worth Rs.50 lakh.

1220
01:05:51,468 --> 01:05:52,730
Who is this guy?

1221
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:54,335
Don't ask. He's a guest.

1222
01:05:54,404 --> 01:05:56,372
He's been here for a month,
and just refuses to leave.

1223
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,101
We're really in trouble.

1224
01:05:58,241 --> 01:06:00,539
May l help?
- What will you do?

1225
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:06,176
Hello.

1226
01:06:07,284 --> 01:06:08,911

1230
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:21,397
Uncle, aunt is dead.

1231
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,127
What happened? - Uncle, she was
crossing the road and a dog bit her.

01:06:29,106 --> 01:06:31,370
The dog died and so did aunty..
- The dog is dead?

1234

Uncle, come quickly.

1235

Aunty.. Who is this?

1236
01:06:35,946 --> 01:06:39,074
Uncle, take the next train.

1237
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:42,682
The dead body is right before me.

1238
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:44,243
She's waiting for you.

1239
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:45,413
Come quickly, uncle. Come quickly.

01:06:59,236 --> 01:07:00,464
Now watch the fun.

1245
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:03,630
He'll take the next train
out of here.

1246
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:06,236
You think so.
- l think so.

1247
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:14,644
Sir, sir. Uncle.
- What's wrong with uncle?

1248
01:07:14,718 --> 01:07:17,084
He dashed off wearing
his loin cloth.

1249
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:19,922
Was he worried?
- Completely worried.

1250
01:07:20,257 --> 01:07:21,315
Good.

1251
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:24,683
Your phone is ringing.

What's wrong, Uncle?
- Thank God you're here.

1255

There's a problem, son.
- What happened, Uncle?

1256
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:41,444
Dear, l was sitting at
home and watching television..

1257
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:44,139
..when l received a call,
that Sarla, your aunt..

1258
01:07:44,214 --> 01:07:47,274
..has been bitten by a dog,
and she passed away.

1259
01:07:48,018 --> 01:07:49,417
Uncle, then what are you doing here?

1260
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,716

Yes.
- With aunt?

1262
01:07:53,223 --> 01:07:56,454
How could l?
She left five years ago.

Where?
- To the heavenly abode.

1264
01:07:58,128 --> 01:07:59,527
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1265
01:07:59,596 --> 01:08:04,590
That's when l realised that
some prankster is troubling me.

1266
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:08,666
l saw his number on your phone
and came to the police station.

1267
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:11,337
And the inspector has arrested
that prankster. Take a look.

1268
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:13,136
Please, sir.

1269
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,409
Please, sir. Please, l'm an actor.

1270
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,912
Please don't hit on the face.
- And l'm an inspector.

1271
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,247
Please. Please, lnspector.

1272
01:08:21,318 --> 01:08:22,979
Look Pappu.

1273
01:08:23,286 --> 01:08:24,617

1274
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,122
Puneet. Puneet, thank God
you're here.

1275
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:31,149
Please explain them.
- Pappu, you know him.

1276
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:32,320
He's my friend.

1277
01:08:32,395 --> 01:08:33,589
How many times have l told you..

1278
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,631
..not to play such pranks,
people get worried.

1279
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,224
What? But l did all this..
- Quiet.

1280
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:39,393
Quiet.

1281
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,501
Did you have to trouble my uncle?

1282
01:08:42,572 --> 01:08:45,166
Sister-in-law, please explain it
to them, please.

1283
01:08:45,575 --> 01:08:48,237
Brother, we didn't
expect this from you.

1284
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:49,744
He's dressed up as Lord Hanuman..

1285
01:08:49,946 --> 01:08:51,072
..and his deeds are
like those of Ravan.

1286
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:53,241
lnspector, slap him once more.

1287
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,213
Right, look here. Look here.

1288
01:08:56,419 --> 01:08:57,477
Sir, are you done?

1289
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:58,680
Our shoot has been stalled.

1290
01:08:58,922 --> 01:09:01,083
The telecast is scheduled
for tomorrow. - Be quiet.

1291
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:04,650
Sir, sir. Sir, the telecast
is scheduled for tomorrow.

1292
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,296
Hey, aren't you the one
l met at the Buddha garden.

1293
01:09:08,365 --> 01:09:11,493
And, he.. he's your friend.

1294
01:09:13,303 --> 01:09:15,897
Slap him once more, once more.

1295
01:09:15,972 --> 01:09:17,439
Let him go, sir.
He won't do it again.

1296
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:19,702
You won't play such
pranks again, won't you?

1297
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,238
But Sister-in-law, l did all this..

1298
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:23,211
Slap him once more, sir. Once more.

1299
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:26,079
lt's almost done, sir. Only
the last two slaps are left, sir.

1300
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:27,983
Puneet.

1301
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:35,290
Today l've realise that l made
a big mistake by marrying you.

1302
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:38,327
Yes, l'm paying for the
mistake that l made by marrying you.

1303
01:09:38,395 --> 01:09:39,487
l'm leaving.

1304
01:09:39,563 --> 01:09:40,928
Take care of your
child and house alone.

1305
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:42,521
Fine, go and don't come back.

1306
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:44,362
Yes, l won't come back.

1307
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:45,991
Finally my eyes have opened.

1308
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:48,094
Did you take sleeping pills before
getting married? - Daughter-in-law.

1309
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:49,263
Daughter-in-law,
where are you going.

1310
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:50,431
Wait, Daughter-in-law.

1311
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:51,565
Uncle, please move aside.

1312
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:54,644
All my friends had warned
me against marrying him.

1313
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,336
Then why didn't you listen to them.

1314
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:58,676
Listen to me..
- Be quiet, Uncle.

1315
01:09:59,049 --> 01:10:00,346
That Bhatinda girl was
much better compared to you.

1316
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:02,351
Bhatinda girl? Which Bhatinda girl?

1317
01:10:02,419 --> 01:10:03,647
You lied to me, didn't you?

1318
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,982
You liar.

1319
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,317
l will..

1320
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:09,717
Uncle.

1321
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:11,385
You hit my uncle.

1322
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:12,985
You hit my respected uncle.

1323
01:10:13,063 --> 01:10:14,724
lt's your fault. Why did you duck?

1324
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:17,525
What happened, dear?
Tell me what happened?

1325
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:19,535
Ask her.
- You tell me.

1326
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:21,298
Uncle, don't ask me, ask him.

1327
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:23,566
Fine, both of you
tell me what's wrong.

1328
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,403
Uncle, she has a friend in Delhi.

1329
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,499
She's getting
married day after tomorrow.

1330
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:27,668
And she wants both of us
to go there.

1331
01:10:27,777 --> 01:10:30,109
She wants me to leave you
alone and come with her.

1332
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,206
Who will take care of your diet?

1333
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,384
So l said, if l tell
uncle how important it is..

1334
01:10:35,452 --> 01:10:38,615
..for us to go, then uncle
will leave for Gorakhpur.

1335
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:42,383
l will never tell uncle to go.

1336
01:10:42,592 --> 01:10:43,718
Uncle, please explain him.

1337
01:10:43,793 --> 01:10:46,353
You aren't going forever.
- Yes.

1338
01:10:46,763 --> 01:10:48,162
Daughter-in-law is right.

1339
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:50,096
But.. - Daughter-in-law
is absolutely right.

1340
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:52,066
And you'll throw
daughter-in-law out of the house..

1341
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:53,534
..for such a trivial reason.

1342
01:10:54,704 --> 01:10:58,572
Had Putani been alive today he
would've died again seeing this.

1343
01:10:59,276 --> 01:11:00,470
Apologise.

1344
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:02,338
Apologise to daughter-in-law.

1345
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:07,107
Sorry.
- Sorry. See that, you fool.

1346
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:10,311
Daughter-in-law,
l apologise on his behalf.

1347
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:12,352
You're absolutely right, dear.

1348
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:15,117
l'll leave tomorrow morning. Fine.

1349
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:19,484
But, the ticket has to be
booked two months in advance, so..

1350
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:21,654
l've booked the ticket.

1351
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:22,989
l've booked it.

1352
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:32,199
Uncle. - Uncle, you're leaving.
- Don't leave, Uncle.

1353
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:34,573
Please, don't leave.
We'll cancel our program.

1354
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:36,476
Uncle, don't go.

1357
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,241
Puneet, please tell him.
- This is for you.

1358
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:42,444
Please ask him not to go.
- Dear, this is for you.

1359
01:11:42,519 --> 01:11:45,181
Thank you, Uncle, please don't leave.
- And son, this is for you.

1360
01:11:45,255 --> 01:11:46,313
And give this to your
friend on her marriage.

1361
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:47,447
Please don't leave uncle,
we'll miss you.

1362
01:11:47,524 --> 01:11:48,582
Who will teach Ayush Hindi?

1363
01:11:48,658 --> 01:11:50,057
Uncle, please.
- No, Uncle.

1364
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:52,117
Uncle.. will have to leave.
He'll keep visiting us.

1365
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:53,287
You will visit us, won't you, uncle?
- But still Uncle.

1366
01:11:53,363 --> 01:11:55,661
Please stay back Uncle.
- Fine.

1367
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:57,290
There's the signal,
there's the signal, Uncle.

1368
01:11:57,367 --> 01:11:58,561
The signal has been given.
- Come, son.

1369
01:11:58,635 --> 01:12:00,125
You're going, uncle.
You're leaving.

1370
01:12:00,203 --> 01:12:01,670
Uncle is leaving.
- Uncle, please don't go.

1371
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,035
Uncle, please don't go.
- Please stay back.

1372
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,334
Don't go, Uncle.

1373
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:07,343
Don't go. Don't stop, Uncle.

1374
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,038
Don't go, Uncle.

1375
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:13,539
Don't stop, Uncle. Leave.

1376
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:15,345
Let's go.

1377
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:19,180
Yes.

1378
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:22,986
Uncle, don't stop, go
away and don't come back.

1379
01:12:23,059 --> 01:12:24,993
Enough, don't over-react.

1380
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:26,494
l'm so happy.

1381
01:12:51,354 --> 01:12:52,787
Thank God.
- Thank God.

1382
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:54,991
What a relief?
- Yes.

1383
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:56,992
The house looks so good, doesn't it?
- Yes.

1384
01:13:09,105 --> 01:13:10,572
Pappu?

1385
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:14,666
Pappu, you're back?
- You're back.

1386
01:13:14,944 --> 01:13:16,070
Yes, son.
- Why?

1387
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:17,543
Why?
- What could l do?

1388
01:13:17,614 --> 01:13:20,549
Daughter-in-law sad
face was haunting me.

1389
01:13:20,617 --> 01:13:24,951
And l thought, ''l'm such a
selfish and sly person''.

1390
01:13:25,021 --> 01:13:27,990
l'm breaking my children's
heart for my own interest.

1391
01:13:28,058 --> 01:13:29,685
Just because the both of
you are going to Delhi..

1392
01:13:29,759 --> 01:13:31,386
..and there's no one to cook for me.

1393
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:33,361
Who cooks for me in Gorakhpur,
tell me?

1394
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,522
Sarla is no more.

1395
01:13:34,597 --> 01:13:37,122
l cook for myself. That's it.

1396
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,136
l jumped off at Thana station,
and came here.

1397
01:13:41,204 --> 01:13:44,765
And your neighbour
opened the door for me.

1398
01:13:45,675 --> 01:13:48,667
Now both of you can
comfortably go to Delhi.

1399
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,473
lt's just a matter of
few days, l'll handle it.

1400
01:13:50,547 --> 01:13:52,674
Go on. Okay. Come on, come on.

1401
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:09,463
Where are we going?
- To Delhi?

1402
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:12,327
Which of our relative
lives in Delhi?

1403
01:14:12,502 --> 01:14:14,265
Your friend,
who's getting married.

1404
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:15,429
Don't joke.

1405
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:16,699
l'm joking!

1406
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:18,563
Who asked you to overact?

1407
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:21,439
''Uncle don't go, uncle
don't go.'' Now pay the price.

1408
01:14:21,578 --> 01:14:23,546
l only said it so that
he feels that we're sad.

1409
01:14:23,613 --> 01:14:26,013
We're sad now, happy?

1410
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:29,279
Sir, we've been roaming
for the past half an hour.

1411
01:14:29,352 --> 01:14:30,944
Tell me where you want to go.

1412
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,544
Take us to some hotel.

1413
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:35,557
Which one?
- That one, that one.

1414
01:14:35,658 --> 01:14:38,149
Take us to that hotel.
- That's a cheap one.

1415
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:39,752
Do we look rich to you?

1416
01:14:39,996 --> 01:14:41,395
Take us there.
- Yes.

1417
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:42,656
ldiot.

1418
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,605
Rs.3000 per day. Two
day's tariff in advance.

1419
01:14:58,715 --> 01:15:00,205
l want to go, see uncle.
- What?

1420
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:02,012
l want to go, see uncle.
- Be quiet.

1421
01:15:04,053 --> 01:15:06,021
He's just a child, don't scold him.

1422
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:08,284
Why shouldn't l?
lt's all because of him?

1423
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:10,053
''When will a guest come home?''

1424
01:15:10,126 --> 01:15:11,388
Are you happy now?

1425
01:15:11,461 --> 01:15:15,488
That's not right. - Quiet,
don't even utter uncle's name.

1426
01:15:15,565 --> 01:15:17,089
We're sitting in the
hotel because of him..

1427
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,532
..and God knows what
he's doing at home.

1428
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:21,570
That's not right.
- Yes, whatever.

1429
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:39,416
''Don't break the bonds of love.''

1430
01:15:39,489 --> 01:15:42,219
''Once broken, they
can never be restored.''

1431
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:45,352
''Even if they are,
they'll be full of knots.''

1432
01:15:45,428 --> 01:15:47,988
''Once broken, they
can never be restored.''

1433
01:15:48,064 --> 01:15:50,760
''Even if they are,
they'll be full of knots.''

1434
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,595
''Speak words that
sanctify your thoughts.''

1435
01:15:56,773 --> 01:16:02,234
''Those calm others,
and calm you too.

1436
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:07,944
''Those calm others,
and calm you too.

1437
01:16:18,027 --> 01:16:20,928
''Bless us with enough space.''

1438
01:16:20,997 --> 01:16:23,591
''That can fit the entire family in.''

1439
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:26,032
''May l never stay hungry or anyone..

1440
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:28,969
..return hungry from my threshold.''

1441
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:31,566
''May l never stay hungry or anyone..

1442
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:35,041
..return hungry from my threshold.''

1443
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:53,492
''When l set out to find evil,
l couldn't find any.''

1444
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:59,001
''When l looked into my heart
l realised l was the most impure.''

1445
01:16:59,068 --> 01:17:04,938
''When l set out to find evil,
l couldn't find any.''

1446
01:17:05,008 --> 01:17:10,378
''When l looked in my heart
l realised l was the most impure.''

1447
01:17:34,704 --> 01:17:36,729
Run.
- What's wrong, Puneet?

1448
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:38,572
The police have raided the place.

1449
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:42,135
After polishing off the liquor..

1450
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:45,737
..there's nothing left to do,
but go home and sleep it off.

1451
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:51,653
Breathe out. Exhale.
Breathe normally.

1452
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:53,120
The police conducted
a late night raid..

1453
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:55,282
..and caught some people
committing a shameful act.

1454
01:17:57,327 --> 01:18:00,888
We're standing right outside..
Outside a hotel in Andheri..

1455
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:02,555
..where the police
conducted a late night raid..

1456
01:18:02,632 --> 01:18:04,327
..and caught some people
committing a shameful act.

1457
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,494
Let me tell you there
are models and students..

1458
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,162
..involved in this and
also an innocent mother.

1459
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:10,705
And she has a six year old son.

1460
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,135
Just imagine how the
innocent mother would've felt.

1461
01:18:13,242 --> 01:18:19,477
And now, we'll show you a
glimpse of that cruel man.

1462
01:18:19,549 --> 01:18:20,607
Take a close look at this man.

1463
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:22,173
He has put humanity to shame.
- Take a good look at this man.

1464
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,185
Don't be taken by
his innocent looks.

1465
01:18:24,253 --> 01:18:26,380
He could be anywhere around you.

1466
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:31,189
Take a good look,
he should be hanged.

1467
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:39,565
Your phone is ringing.

1468
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:48,137
Hello.
- Pappu.

1469
01:18:48,945 --> 01:18:52,039
Where are you son?
- ln the marriage?

1470
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:55,307
ln the marriage? - But son,
l don't hear the band playing.

1471
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,579
Do you hear it now?
- Okay. Okay.

1472
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:04,251
They are showing something on
television that really scared me.

1473
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:08,286
They're showing a vile man
who looks just like you.

1474
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:11,595
And he took undue
advantage of a mother..

1475
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:14,061
..of a six year old child,
you know.

1476
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:16,330
She's the mother of
a six year old child.

1477
01:19:16,506 --> 01:19:18,133
He'll surely rot in hell.

1478
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:21,139
Are you fine, son?
- Yes, Uncle.

1479
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:25,044
Okay, it's been so many days
let me speak to daughter-in-law.

1480
01:19:25,114 --> 01:19:26,979
She's getting henna
applied on her hands.

1481
01:19:27,049 --> 01:19:28,243
Okay.

1482
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:31,980
Then let me talk to my prince.
Give the phone to Ayush.

1483
01:19:32,054 --> 01:19:33,578
The guests are here, the
guests are here. Get the sweets.

1484
01:19:33,656 --> 01:19:35,089
Uncle, l'll call you later.
Get the sweets.

1485
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:37,353
Okay, son.

1486
01:19:39,228 --> 01:19:41,162
You're attending a marriage.

1487
01:19:46,436 --> 01:19:47,562
Did you recognise me?

1488
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:52,271
We were together when the
police raided that place. - No.

1489
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:55,034
Then it must be Shalimar hotel.

1490
01:19:55,077 --> 01:19:57,136
When you were with a Nepali girl.

1491
01:19:57,346 --> 01:19:58,404
No.

1492
01:19:59,315 --> 01:20:01,374
Then, Krishna Lodge?

1493
01:20:02,318 --> 01:20:04,047
Vrindavan Hotel.

1494
01:20:04,654 --> 01:20:06,622
Night Club.
- This is my first time.

1495
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:08,020
First time?

1496
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:11,253
25th time, Chatwal. Silver jubilee.

1497
01:20:11,594 --> 01:20:13,425
The officer will be here.

1498
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:15,225
Give him Rs.200, he'll let you go.

1499
01:20:15,298 --> 01:20:17,232
l'll talk to him, l know him.
- Lock them all up.

1500
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,428
Sir. - Come on, get in, get in.
ln a line.

1501
01:20:20,503 --> 01:20:22,198
Hey, where are you going?

1502
01:20:22,271 --> 01:20:23,363
Stand in your place.

1503
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:25,202
Hello, inspector. How are you?

1504
01:20:25,274 --> 01:20:26,764
Hello, you're back again?
- Yes.

1505
01:20:26,976 --> 01:20:28,068
Stand straight.

1506
01:20:28,177 --> 01:20:30,509
Patil, Chatwal is back again.
Get in.

1507
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,673
Sir, he's a good friend.
So don't beat him too much.

1508
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:34,306
Do you pay us?
- Get in.

1509
01:20:34,383 --> 01:20:37,716
Get in! - l've told them,
they won't hit you too much.

1510
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:41,313
Show me your face.

1511
01:20:42,024 --> 01:20:43,582
Show me your face.

1512
01:20:45,528 --> 01:20:46,756
Show it.

1513
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,389
You? Here again?
- Sir, l got trapped.

1514
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:52,991
No, you'll get trapped now.

1515
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:55,162
l've had my eyes on
you for a long time.

1516
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:57,331
Sir, l'm a decent man.
- Decent?

1517
01:20:57,373 --> 01:20:59,568
Sir, he's the one
who took advantage..

1518
01:20:59,675 --> 01:21:01,666
..of the helpless mother
of a six year old. - What?

1519
01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:03,468
No, no she's my wife.

1520
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:06,346
Munmun, tell them that
you're my wife. - Don't scare her.

1521
01:21:06,415 --> 01:21:08,042
No, l'm not scaring here.
Tell him, please.

1522
01:21:08,117 --> 01:21:10,347
Tell him, what are you doing..
- l'm Jamila.

1523
01:21:10,419 --> 01:21:14,082
Here l am.
- Say something.

1524
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:16,488
ls there a need to say anything?
Everyone has seen me with you.

1525
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:18,527
ls it my fault?
- ls it my fault?

1526
01:21:18,594 --> 01:21:21,028
You couldn't even find a good hotel.
You're so irresponsible.

1527
01:21:21,097 --> 01:21:23,463
How would l know?
- So, should l have known?

1528
01:21:23,766 --> 01:21:26,132
l don't know why l married you.

1529
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:28,430
Hey, don't quarrel here.

1530
01:21:29,472 --> 01:21:31,167
Where do the both of you live?
- ln our house.

1531
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:32,504

1532
01:21:32,608 --> 01:21:34,303
lt's your own home, isn't it?
- Yes.

1533
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:36,707
Then what were the both
of you doing in the hotel?

1534
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:39,138
lt's a long story.
- Then say it in short.

1535
01:21:39,415 --> 01:21:41,383
Have you ever had a
guest visiting you?

1536
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:44,108
Don't remind me of that.

1537
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:46,279
Who was it?
- My father-in-law.

1538
01:21:46,355 --> 01:21:48,585
How many days?
- He stayed for six months.

1539
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:50,182
How did you get rid of him?

1540
01:21:51,127 --> 01:21:53,322
You won't tell anyone, will you?
- No.

1541
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:55,091
l gave a contract to the underworld.

1542
01:21:55,164 --> 01:21:56,995
They got him out, in a day.

1543
01:22:06,742 --> 01:22:09,176
There, that's him.

1544
01:22:09,245 --> 01:22:10,542
He's buying vegetables.

1545
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:16,077
Just threaten him, don't beat him.

1546
01:22:16,152 --> 01:22:17,278
He's an old man.

1547
01:22:17,353 --> 01:22:21,414
Don't worry your uncle is my uncle.
- Boss.

1548
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:24,649
Leave your gun behind.

1549
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:28,360
Scared, that l might kill him?

1550
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:30,399
No, he might kill you.

1551
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,560
Yes.

1552
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:37,002
Fine. Look.

1553
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:39,004
Thank you.

1554
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:43,168
What's the rate of the apple?
- Rs.100 per kilo.

1555
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,514
We buy mangoes for Rs.20.

1556
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:49,142
lf you get mangoes for Rs.20,
then better buy mangoes.

1557
01:22:49,218 --> 01:22:51,209
Why are you buying apples?

1558
01:22:51,754 --> 01:22:53,688
Where do these people come
from to ruin my business?

1559
01:22:53,756 --> 01:22:55,451
l've come from Gorakhpur.

1560
01:22:55,524 --> 01:22:57,492
Where do you hail from?

1561
01:23:00,029 --> 01:23:01,553
Why you..

1562
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:05,033
Sorry.

1563
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:14,336
Look, there's Suleiman.

1564
01:23:14,543 --> 01:23:16,067
Are you joking?

1565
01:23:16,145 --> 01:23:17,635
Anyone wearing a cap and a
dot of vermilion on the head..

1566
01:23:17,713 --> 01:23:19,010
..and you think he's Suleiman.

1567
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:21,242
l feel it's him.
- l don't think so.

1568
01:23:21,317 --> 01:23:22,614
l've seen him.

1569
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:26,314
His men killed Anna.
- Are you sure?

1570
01:23:26,389 --> 01:23:30,086
Kill him.
- Then get the stuff, come on.

1571
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:40,465
Aren't you Suleiman?
- Yes he is, kill him.

1572
01:23:40,636 --> 01:23:44,163
Your men killed Anna, isn't it?

1573
01:23:44,373 --> 01:23:45,499
Yes, kill him.

1574
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:48,566
Are you sure, he's Suleiman.
- Yes, kill him.

1575
01:23:49,979 --> 01:23:51,344
Ramu.

1576
01:23:53,082 --> 01:23:56,176
What are you looking at,
l'm calling you.

1577
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,385
See that.

1578
01:23:59,722 --> 01:24:01,656
Can't you see?

1579
01:24:01,724 --> 01:24:03,385
Are you drunk?

1580
01:24:06,228 --> 01:24:09,288
l've been waiting for you for
so long, where have you been?

1581
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:11,356
l..
- Quiet! Quiet!

1582
01:24:12,101 --> 01:24:15,070
l've been standing in
the sun with the things.

1583
01:24:15,137 --> 01:24:17,071
And he's strolling around.

1584
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:19,164
Where have you been?
- l.. l.. - Quiet.

1585
01:24:19,475 --> 01:24:21,443
Now he'll argue with me.

1586
01:24:21,477 --> 01:24:23,638
Here, take these things.

1587
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:25,938
Take it.

1588
01:24:26,015 --> 01:24:28,108
And take the ones
that are there too.

1589
01:24:29,018 --> 01:24:31,145
He's a rascal.

1590
01:24:32,354 --> 01:24:35,448
Not that one, pick up our things.

1591
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:38,357
Pick up our things.

1592
01:24:42,264 --> 01:24:44,494
And why have you surrounded us?

1593
01:24:44,567 --> 01:24:46,125
Go, go home.

1594
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:49,667
Son, this isn't a
place to play hockey.

1595
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:51,707
Go and play hockey in the ground.

1596
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:53,401
Go, go, go on.

1597
01:24:56,312 --> 01:25:02,148
Come on, come on. All free-loaders.
Come on.

1598
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:03,947
Let's go.

1599
01:25:06,555 --> 01:25:10,924
So Yadav, you thought
he was Suleiman. - Yes.

1600
01:25:10,993 --> 01:25:15,089
Yadav, you think anyone can
do that to Suleiman. - No.

1601
01:25:15,164 --> 01:25:16,529
What yes and no?

1602
01:25:16,599 --> 01:25:19,033
You would've made me kill poor Ramu..

1603
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:20,693
..and the boss would've killed me.
- Yes.

1604
01:25:20,936 --> 01:25:23,302
Keep the stuff inside,
come on keep it inside.

1605
01:25:24,974 --> 01:25:28,273
lt isn't that heavy, Ramu.
Walk quickly.

1606
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:31,945
Walk quickly.

1607
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:37,380
Keep it here.

1608
01:25:39,755 --> 01:25:41,586
Hello.
- Hello.

1609
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:48,653
Carefully.

1610
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:50,426
Where did you get this man from?

1611
01:25:50,499 --> 01:25:52,160
ls he a new appoint?

1612
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:53,633
Where are you from?

1613
01:25:56,572 --> 01:25:57,596
Catch this.

1614
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,406
1000. 1300.

1615
01:26:03,145 --> 01:26:04,612
Twenty.

1616
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:09,481
Here, keep this Rs.10.

1617
01:26:09,952 --> 01:26:12,716
And buy yourself some milk
with it. May you be healthy.

1618
01:26:13,088 --> 01:26:16,387
But l'm not Ramu.
- l know that you're Suleiman.

1619
01:26:16,959 --> 01:26:18,392
Then why did you make
me carry these things?

1620
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,018
had l not made you
carry these things..

1621
01:26:20,095 --> 01:26:21,585
..you'd be dead by now.

1622
01:26:21,664 --> 01:26:23,529
Why do you do such deeds?

1623
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:26,224
ls this why your
parents raised you? See that.

1624
01:26:26,302 --> 01:26:27,963
He keeps locking horns
with everyone.

1625
01:26:28,037 --> 01:26:32,167
lf you had lost your life you
would regret it all your life.

1626
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:34,274
Will you do it again?

1627
01:26:34,743 --> 01:26:36,643
No, catch your ears.

1628
01:26:39,215 --> 01:26:41,046
Fine.
- Touch his feet.

1629
01:26:41,116 --> 01:26:43,414
He forgave you. Touch his feet.

1630
01:26:45,554 --> 01:26:47,249
Forgive me, Uncle.

1631
01:26:47,323 --> 01:26:48,722
From today you're my uncle.

1632
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:50,687
Forgive him.
- Fine.

1633
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:57,029
Uncle, now l'll see to
it that no one harms you.

1634
01:26:57,233 --> 01:26:59,258
l'm there.
- See that.

1635
01:26:59,335 --> 01:27:02,168
He can't even protect himself,
and proposes to protect me.

1636
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,641
When a few boys surrounded him
he was scared out of his wits.

1637
01:27:06,909 --> 01:27:08,604
And he'll protect me. Go on.

1638
01:27:08,644 --> 01:27:12,171
Leave, or l will hit you. Leave.

1639
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:16,313
He wants to protect me.

1640
01:27:16,385 --> 01:27:18,319
Buy yourself some milk
from Bajrangi's shop.

1641
01:27:18,387 --> 01:27:21,151
They're such strange people.
- Pick up the things.

1642
01:27:21,223 --> 01:27:22,485
Pick them up.

1643
01:27:23,525 --> 01:27:25,390
This is wrong.

1644
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:28,453
lf it weren't for uncle,
l'd be dead today.

1645
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:30,589
And you want to get rid of him.

1646
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:33,066
Guest is like God.

1647
01:27:33,135 --> 01:27:35,729
And now he isn't just
your guest, but mine too.

1648
01:27:36,071 --> 01:27:39,336
Then you keep him.
- He isn't that special.

1649
01:27:39,575 --> 01:27:41,270
Go home, and look after him.

1650
01:27:42,244 --> 01:27:43,677
Send some of our men after him.

1651
01:27:43,946 --> 01:27:46,608
lf he throws uncle out of
the house, then kill him.

1652
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:54,288
How can you take it away?

1653
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:56,256
The owner.. Pappu..

1654
01:28:00,496 --> 01:28:02,487
They just took it away.

1655
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:12,036
Pappu, they took your car away.
- l know.

1656
01:28:12,107 --> 01:28:13,506
The bank called me this morning.

1657
01:28:17,146 --> 01:28:18,408
Ayush.

1658
01:28:19,281 --> 01:28:23,684
They just came, gave me these
papers and took the car away.

1659
01:28:23,919 --> 01:28:25,944
l said that the owner of the car..

1660
01:28:26,021 --> 01:28:27,648
Papa, our car.

1661
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:31,119
Son, it's gone to the garage.
lt's broken down, that's why.

1662
01:28:31,193 --> 01:28:32,319
lt hasn't gone to the garage.

1663
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:35,420
They took our car away
because you didn't pay for it.

1664
01:28:35,497 --> 01:28:37,488
That's what Raju's
father is telling everyone.

1665
01:28:37,566 --> 01:28:39,625
You're a liar, l don't
want to talk to you.

1666
01:28:39,702 --> 01:28:41,101
Ayush.

1667
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:44,628
He'll come back.

1668
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:51,105
Look, son.

1669
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,647
Today the festival of
Lord Ganesha begins..

1670
01:28:54,717 --> 01:28:55,945
..and the both of
you were in Delhi.

1671
01:28:56,018 --> 01:28:58,213
So l brought and idol
of Lord Ganesha home.

1672
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,183
Lord has come here,
but only as a guest.

1673
01:29:00,255 --> 01:29:01,552
He'll stay here only for 11 days.

1674
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:07,619
But when he leaves, he'll
take all the problems with him.

1675
01:29:07,997 --> 01:29:09,294
l've only one problem.

1676
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:11,697
Lord Ganesha is there.

1677
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:15,233
He'll solve all your problems.

1678
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,200
The Lord will leave in 11 days.

1679
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:19,139
But when is he going to leave?

1680
01:29:19,241 --> 01:29:20,902
l know that guests are like God.

1681
01:29:20,943 --> 01:29:23,104
But Their duty is to come,
bless His devotees..

1682
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:24,476
..with His grace and leave.

1683
01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:27,071
Goddess Durga comes only
for nine days in 'Navratri'.

1684
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:29,140
Lord Ganpati will be
immersed after 11 days.

1685
01:29:29,218 --> 01:29:31,277
But when will he leave.

1686
01:29:31,353 --> 01:29:33,287
God, l can't take this anymore.

1687
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:39,357
Do you know why we
venerate Lord Ganesh first? - Why?

1688
01:29:39,428 --> 01:29:43,558
One day Lord Ganesh and
Kartike had an argument..

1689
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:45,690
..about who's more intelligent.

1690
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:48,030
Then they approached their parents.

1691
01:29:48,103 --> 01:29:49,536
To Shankar-Parvati.

1692
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:51,971
Lord Shiva said
''whichever one of you..

1693
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:56,636
..completes seven
rounds of earth first..

1694
01:29:56,678 --> 01:29:59,112
..will be known as the
most intelligent one''.

1695
01:29:59,348 --> 01:30:01,509
So what happened next?
- They had a race.

1696
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:02,641
They had a race.

1697
01:30:02,718 --> 01:30:04,618
Kartike's carrier was peacock.

1698
01:30:04,686 --> 01:30:07,519
So he flew away on his peacock.

1699
01:30:07,689 --> 01:30:10,624
Lord Ganesha, thought for a moment.
He used his intelligence.

1700
01:30:10,692 --> 01:30:13,388
He took the blessings
of his parents.

1701
01:30:13,462 --> 01:30:14,724
And His carrier is..

1702
01:30:15,064 --> 01:30:16,429
The mouse.
- Mouse.

1703
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:21,435
He sat on the mouse, and took
seven rounds around his parents.

1704
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:23,403
They asked him, ''What did you do''.

1705
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:27,373
He replied, ''Whether you
call it earth, or my world..

1706
01:30:27,409 --> 01:30:29,502
..my parents are everything for me''.

1707
01:30:29,578 --> 01:30:32,604
Lord Shankar was very
pleased to hear this.

1708
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:37,983
He said, ''Ganesh, whenever
there's a veneration performed..

1709
01:30:38,053 --> 01:30:41,580
..anywhere in the world,
you will be venerated first''.

1710
01:30:41,657 --> 01:30:43,784
Otherwise, that
veneration won't be successful.

1711
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,256
That's why, Lord
Ganesha is the God of Gods.

1712
01:30:47,329 --> 01:30:51,425
Because he respects his parents.

1713
01:30:51,767 --> 01:30:57,000
Son, there's nothing greater
than your parents in the world.

1714
01:30:57,172 --> 01:30:58,264
Get it.

1715
01:30:58,373 --> 01:31:01,467
So say, glory to..
- Lord Ganesha.

1716
01:31:09,151 --> 01:31:12,416
''Oh, Lord Ganesh, the giver of the
joys and the destroyer of sorrows.''

1717
01:31:12,488 --> 01:31:15,389
''Who waives off calamity whose
blessing gives enough love.''

1718
01:31:15,457 --> 01:31:18,551
''His body is resplendent
with a beautiful orange color.''

1719
01:31:18,627 --> 01:31:21,596
''He has a pearl necklace
shining around his neck.''

1720
01:31:21,663 --> 01:31:24,530
''Pray to this auspicious idol,
praise the Lord.''

1721
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,401
''At mere glimpse of him, all
of your wishes come true.''

1722
01:31:32,774 --> 01:31:34,002
''Praise the Lord.''

1723
01:31:34,076 --> 01:31:36,977
''The jeweled crown is for You,
oh, son of Paravati.''

1724
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:38,307
''With sandalwood paste
smeared on His body..

1725
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,143
''..and saffron red
color on His forehead.''

1726
01:31:40,215 --> 01:31:43,116
''That jeweled crown
looks beautiful.''

1727
01:31:43,185 --> 01:31:46,245
''The bells of the anklets make
a lovely tinkle on Your feet.''

1728
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:49,256
''The bells of the anklets make
a lovely tinkle on Your feet.''

1729
01:31:49,324 --> 01:31:52,384
''The bells of the anklets make
a lovely tinkle on Your feet.''

1730
01:31:52,461 --> 01:31:55,328
''Pray to this auspicious idol,
praise the Lord.''

1731
01:31:55,397 --> 01:31:59,561
''At mere glimpse of Him,
all of your wishes come true.''

1732
01:32:17,686 --> 01:32:19,051
No, no we can't release your car.

1733
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:20,349
You're three months

1734
01:32:20,422 --> 01:32:21,946
Sir, l'm paying two months
instalment.

1735
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:23,082
No, nothing can be done.

1736
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:24,284
Sir, l've promised my child.

1737
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:25,724
Why do you make
such false promises?

1738
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:28,191
Look, the manager is very strict.
He'll never understand.

1739
01:32:32,367 --> 01:32:33,629
Pappu.

1740
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,537
Didn't you recognise me?

1741
01:32:36,772 --> 01:32:39,104

1742

01:32:49,151 --> 01:32:50,641
'Greet everyone with a smile.'

1748
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,347
'We should never
fall short of friends.'

1749
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:56,616
l'm the manager here.

1750
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:59,457
Patil, come here.

''Praise the Lord.''

1758
01:33:31,393 --> 01:33:33,190
''Praise the Lord.''

1759
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:41,363
What did you teach your child
that he has turned so brilliant?

1760
01:33:41,436 --> 01:33:43,529
He has scored 85 out of 100 in Hindi.

1761
01:33:43,705 --> 01:33:45,297
Gayatri Mantra, Shlokas.

1762
01:33:45,407 --> 01:33:48,706
He recites discourses,
which even we don't remember.

1763
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:54,582
When l asked him,
''who taught you, son''.

1764
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:56,618
He said, ''uncle''.

1765
01:33:56,685 --> 01:33:59,449
Who is this uncle, l would
like to meet him as well.

1766
01:33:59,655 --> 01:34:01,020
Very nice, very nice.

1767
01:34:01,089 --> 01:34:02,181
He's a very nice boy.

1768
01:34:44,766 --> 01:34:47,758
''Pray to this auspicious idol,
praise the Lord.''

1769
01:34:48,003 --> 01:34:50,995
''At mere glimpse of Him,
all of your wishes come true.''

1770

''With a big belly, a
yellow silk garment..''

1771
01:34:52,674 --> 01:34:54,073
''..and a serpent around His waist.''

1772
01:34:54,109 --> 01:34:57,169
''A straight trunk that is bent
at the end, and three eyes.''

1773
01:34:57,245 --> 01:35:00,112
''Ramdas awaits You at his doorstep.''

1774
01:35:00,182 --> 01:35:05,643
''God, please bless us when there is
trouble and protect from disaster.''

1775
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:08,519
l'm standing before you.
Give me the offerings.

1776
01:35:15,664 --> 01:35:18,531
Puneet, you knew
my parents were here.

1777
01:35:19,534 --> 01:35:22,264
My mummy can't see properly.

1778
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:25,070
She mistakenly knocked down a vase.

1779
01:35:25,574 --> 01:35:28,236
lt was an imported one.
My wife got it from Dubai.

1780
01:35:28,643 --> 01:35:33,046
My wife insulted them.

1781
01:35:34,316 --> 01:35:36,113
He yelled at them.

1782
01:35:37,252 --> 01:35:38,651
They kept crying, and
listening to the rebukes..

1783
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,551
..and l kept watching.

1784
01:35:41,323 --> 01:35:43,484
When l got up in the morning,
l found out..

1785
01:35:43,558 --> 01:35:45,719
..that they went
back without telling me.

1786
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:50,362
Today l realised
what a lowly man l am.

1787
01:35:50,565 --> 01:35:55,400
There's me, l quietly
kept listening..

1788
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:57,037
..when my parents
were getting rebuked at.

1789
01:35:57,105 --> 01:35:59,938
And there's you,
that left his career..

1790
01:36:00,142 --> 01:36:03,009
..just because l said
something to your uncle.

1791
01:36:03,578 --> 01:36:05,102
l respect you.

1792
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,474
l'm sorry.

1793
01:36:08,517 --> 01:36:11,077
l'm a coward.

1794
01:36:11,953 --> 01:36:14,945
At home l'm scared of my wife.
Outside l'm scared of the hero.

1795
01:36:15,357 --> 01:36:17,120
When the movie releases
in the theatre on Friday..

1796
01:36:17,192 --> 01:36:18,420
..l'm scared of the audience.

1797
01:36:18,727 --> 01:36:20,024
l'm sorry.

1798
01:36:22,564 --> 01:36:24,031
What are you saying, sir?

1799
01:36:25,066 --> 01:36:26,158
You're my senior.

1800
01:36:27,068 --> 01:36:31,164
l'm senior, but l'm junior to
you in abiding by relations.

1801
01:36:35,143 --> 01:36:37,611
Here's the cheque, for the movie.

1802
01:36:38,346 --> 01:36:41,247
And l'm making another film,
'Baghban' type.

1803
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,948
Here's the signing amount.

1804

1805
01:36:47,222 --> 01:36:48,621
Tomorrow l'm going to
bring my parents back.

1807
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:51,991
The day after that we'll go
to Khandala for the sitting.

1808
01:36:52,093 --> 01:36:54,527
And we'll come back on the
fourth day with a super-hit idea.

1809
01:36:54,996 --> 01:36:59,023

talent and your laptop.

1810
01:37:02,904 --> 01:37:04,030

''At mere glimpse of him, all
of your wishes come true.''

1819
01:38:09,704 --> 01:38:11,433
''With a big belly, a
yellow silk garment..''

1820
01:38:11,506 --> 01:38:12,632
''..and a serpent around His waist.''

1821

''A straight trunk that is bent
at the end, and three eyes.''

1822

You at his doorstep.''

''God, please bless us
when there is trouble..

1824

Uncle?

Wonder where he is.

1835
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,108
Where could he be?

1836

Let's look. You look that way,

Did uncle come back?
- No, he went along with you.

1839
01:40:57,372 --> 01:40:59,738
Have you heard, there

1840
01:40:59,974 --> 01:41:01,339
..at Juhu during Ganesh immersion.

1841

There was a chaos suddenly.

Many were injured.

1843
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:05,137
The situation is very bad.

1844
01:41:05,213 --> 01:41:06,271
They're showing it on television.

1845
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:07,972
lt's truly regretful
for this to happen..

1846
01:41:08,049 --> 01:41:10,244
..on such an auspicious occasion.

1847
01:41:10,318 --> 01:41:12,081

On my way to Nanavati hospital.

The dead bodies

His name isn't
amongst the one injured.

1875
01:43:16,044 --> 01:43:17,136
God.

They haven't retrieved the
bodies from the sea yet.

1879
01:44:20,174 --> 01:44:21,539
We'll know in the morning.

1880
01:44:37,425 --> 01:44:38,653
lsn't this what we wanted?

1881
01:44:39,427 --> 01:44:40,655
For uncle to leave.

1882
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:45,591
Now that he has left,
why are we worried?

1883
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:51,495
Puneet, you've been
so irresponsible.

1884
01:45:15,596 --> 01:45:17,461
No, no. Pappu don't pay him.

1885
01:45:17,532 --> 01:45:18,658
He's asking for too much.

1886
01:45:18,733 --> 01:45:21,031
The fare from the
station to here is just Rs.1 7.

1887
01:45:21,202 --> 01:45:24,171
Liar. The fare is just Rs.1 7.

1888
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:26,940
Where have you been?
- Son, l was..

1889
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:28,440
Where have you been all night?

1890
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:31,044
l searched for you at Juhu,
but couldn't find you.

1891
01:45:31,112 --> 01:45:32,977
Then l went to V.T.

1892
01:45:33,181 --> 01:45:34,273
To buy a ticket.

1893
01:45:34,349 --> 01:45:36,476
See this, l stood in
the queue all night..

1894
01:45:36,551 --> 01:45:38,246
..and reached the ticket
window only in the morning.

1895
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:39,581
But that's okay.

1896
01:45:39,754 --> 01:45:44,214
l bought a 'Tatkal' ticket,
and l'm leaving tomorrow. Okay.

1897
01:45:44,459 --> 01:45:46,154
Couldn't you call?

1898
01:45:47,628 --> 01:45:49,391
Do you know what we've
been through all night?

1899
01:45:49,464 --> 01:45:51,022
What happened?

1900
01:45:51,165 --> 01:45:52,996
Ayush spent all night crying.

1901
01:45:53,234 --> 01:45:55,168
Your daughter-in-law,
that Godbole.

1902
01:45:55,603 --> 01:45:57,093
Do you know how worried
they all were?

1903
01:45:57,138 --> 01:45:59,231
That watchman
whom you had slapped.

1904
01:45:59,407 --> 01:46:02,001
His duty ends at eight but
he didn't go home all night.

1905
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:04,172
We were searching
for you like crazy..

1906
01:46:04,245 --> 01:46:06,372
..and you couldn't
even inform us?

1907
01:46:10,485 --> 01:46:12,419
Forgive me.

1908
01:46:13,121 --> 01:46:15,021
l did have your number,
it was in my diary.

1909
01:46:15,089 --> 01:46:17,649
But the diary fell down somewhere.

1910
01:46:17,725 --> 01:46:21,388
l thought if l tell you,
you'll ask me to stay back again.

1911
01:46:21,662 --> 01:46:23,129
l've stayed here for long enough.

1912
01:46:23,197 --> 01:46:25,062
How long does a guest
stay back, son.

1913
01:46:25,366 --> 01:46:27,300
The Goddess leaves in nine days.

1914
01:46:27,368 --> 01:46:28,699
Lord Ganesha left in 11 days.

1915
01:46:28,936 --> 01:46:31,268
Uncle, l didn't..
- Just a minute, Mun.

1916
01:46:32,173 --> 01:46:33,470
Wait here.

1917
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,719
You leave right now,
we can't wait until tomorrow.

1918
01:46:48,956 --> 01:46:51,254
l made a big mistake,
l apologise son.

1919
01:46:51,325 --> 01:46:52,758
l apologise to you.

1920
01:46:52,994 --> 01:46:54,052
We made a mistake.

1921
01:46:54,128 --> 01:46:55,652
Puneet, calm down.
- Just a minute, Munmun.

1922
01:46:56,230 --> 01:46:58,664
She looked after you for so many
days but you don't care about that.

1923
01:46:59,133 --> 01:47:01,226
Just because you overheard
her saying something once, .

1924
01:47:01,402 --> 01:47:02,926
..it's our mistake.

1925
01:47:03,504 --> 01:47:05,529
We don't have the
patience or the culture..

1926
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,335
..to welcome guests at our home.

1927
01:47:07,408 --> 01:47:08,500
Please leave.

1928
01:47:08,543 --> 01:47:10,443
Listen, son. l..
- Please leave.

1929
01:47:11,345 --> 01:47:13,313
We never wanted any
guests to visit us.

1930
01:47:13,381 --> 01:47:15,315
But he, he never understood.

1931
01:47:15,683 --> 01:47:18,550
He would always keep asking..
''When will the guest arrive?''

1932
01:47:21,656 --> 01:47:25,114
You came, and we liked it.

1933
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,984
But for how many days?

1934
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,625
After four days we wondered,
''When will he leave?''

1935
01:47:34,435 --> 01:47:39,031
l always wished, if my father
were alive he'd live with us.

1936
01:47:39,373 --> 01:47:42,069
But had my father been
in your place..

1937
01:47:42,343 --> 01:47:44,641
..we would've behaved
the same way with him.

1938
01:47:46,447 --> 01:47:48,381
The parents can keep the children
with them for all their lives.

1939
01:47:48,449 --> 01:47:53,216
But children start thinking,
''When will they leave''.

1940
01:47:55,423 --> 01:47:57,550
Our son will do the same
thing with us in future.

1941
01:47:57,892 --> 01:47:59,189
And we deserve it.

1942
01:47:59,961 --> 01:48:01,223
Please leave.

1943
01:48:01,462 --> 01:48:02,952
Please leave.

1944
01:48:08,669 --> 01:48:10,398
Just like Putani.

1945
01:48:11,539 --> 01:48:13,905
Putani would start
crying just like that.

1946
01:48:14,509 --> 01:48:16,306
You're right, son.

1947
01:48:17,044 --> 01:48:19,569
But a guest should
understand his duty.

1948
01:48:20,047 --> 01:48:23,210
He wont be respected like God if
he stays back for so many days.

1949
01:48:23,417 --> 01:48:25,715
And even the Lord
leaves after 11 days.

1950
01:48:25,953 --> 01:48:28,387
And that's why we
wait eagerly for Him.

1951
01:48:29,123 --> 01:48:31,353
And we ask him come back soon.

1952
01:48:31,526 --> 01:48:33,460
l will come back
again next year, son.

1953
01:48:33,661 --> 01:48:35,094
l will come back.

1954
01:48:35,296 --> 01:48:38,094
l won't be able to stay
away from all of you for long.

1955
01:48:38,299 --> 01:48:39,425
Really.

1956
01:48:48,643 --> 01:48:50,668
Stop, stop, stop.

1957
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:57,508
Puneet, what's wrong?
Why is there a crowd here?

1958
01:49:00,421 --> 01:49:01,911
Hello.
- Uncle.

1959
01:49:03,324 --> 01:49:06,316
Who are you? - l'm Putani's son,
didn't you recognise me?

1960
01:49:06,394 --> 01:49:07,554
Pappu.

1961
01:49:08,296 --> 01:49:09,558
Pappu?
- Yes.

1962
01:49:10,331 --> 01:49:13,528
So aren't you Pappu?
- You made me Pappu.

1963
01:49:14,202 --> 01:49:19,333
Oh, God.. son, l barged
into the wrong house.

1964
01:49:20,408 --> 01:49:22,308
What was your address?

1965
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:25,001
lt was written room no. 703.

1966
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:26,979
A wing or B wing?
- l don't know that.

1967
01:49:27,048 --> 01:49:29,516
But Madhuri just
wrote room no. 703.

1968
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:33,042
Actually, our room numbers
are same..

1969
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,712
..but they're in different wings.

1970
01:49:34,956 --> 01:49:36,583
You rascal, your guest has
been staying in our house..

1971
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:39,251
..for the past one month,
and you've been watching the fun.

1972
01:49:39,327 --> 01:49:40,453
Sorry, but didn't l tell you..

1973
01:49:40,528 --> 01:49:41,927
..that l'm troubled by the
frequent visits by my guests.

1974
01:49:41,996 --> 01:49:44,294
So l went out for
month as a guest myself.

1975
01:49:44,365 --> 01:49:45,491
That's okay, son.

1976
01:49:45,566 --> 01:49:47,056
Thank God l met you otherwise..

1977
01:49:47,134 --> 01:49:49,034
..l would've left
without meeting the real Pappu.

1978
01:49:49,103 --> 01:49:50,365
That's okay.
- You're leaving, Uncle.

1979
01:49:50,438 --> 01:49:52,065
l'm leaving.
- Okay.

1980
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:53,470
No, no how is that possible?

1981
01:49:53,574 --> 01:49:55,974
You'll have to stay with the
real Pappu for few months.

1982
01:49:56,043 --> 01:49:58,568
Yes, Uncle. - Otherwise
Putani's soul won't rest in peace.

1983
01:49:58,646 --> 01:50:02,377
Yes, yes. Yes. Sarla.
You speak just like Sarla.

1984
01:50:03,317 --> 01:50:04,511
Pappu.
- Yes, Uncle.

1985
01:50:04,585 --> 01:50:06,746
Yes.
- Not you, the real Pappu.

1986
01:50:06,988 --> 01:50:08,250
Pick up the luggage, son.

1987
01:50:08,322 --> 01:50:10,222
And touch his feet.
