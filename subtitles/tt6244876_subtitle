1
00:02:56,433 --> 00:03:00,040
And by the by, this is our
Angel's bachelor party!

2
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,111
Cheers!

3
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,979
So before all you guys get sloshed,

4
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,278
I'm leaving.

5
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,212
I will really miss you.

6
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,007
I can't be without her, dude!

7
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,199
Tell us who she is, bro!

8
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,407
We'll get you to her!
Tell us who it is!

9
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:19,571
Angel!

10
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,271
See who it is!

11
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,673
You wanna come with me?

12
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,545
Why are you here?

13
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,241
You like his songs, you like how
he talks, but you don't like him?

14
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,780
We have to finish what
we set out to do, right?

15
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,010
Ferno!

16
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,032
I don't know!

17
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,410
I don't remember anything!

18
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,171
Wherever he is, catch him!

19
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,647
Who is it, you @'6TM@ 'Ã©TM

20
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,537
Sebastian.

21
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,738
If we die, we die together.

22
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,108
If we live, we live together.

23
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,105
Lock Kochi up!

24
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,610
He'll get to know,
some way or the other.

25
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,073
We'll escape through the harbour.

26
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,011
Bro!

27
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,078
What?

28
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,732
What all are you guys doing?

29
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,974
Ferno, take care of Am bro.

30
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,013
So don't blame each other!

31
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,041
Who are these guys?
Your friends?

32
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,238
I love you.

33
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,506
More than anything else.

34
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,575
Where do you want to go?

35
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,544
Please take us to
the harbour, Sir.

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,738
I think it's infected.

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,473
Are you planning to die for them?

38
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,408
Bro, Khais had called.

39
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,271
He has traced all their phones!

40
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,073
This is Fernando speaking.

41
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,401
Abu!

42
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,501
Come!
Kill us!

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,708
He kissed her, dude!

44
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,375
Seban!

45
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,011
Chinju!

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,307
Seban!

47
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,707
Seban!

48
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,211
Angel!

49
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,611
Angel!

50
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,145
Angel!

51
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,605
Angel!

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,778
Angel!

53
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,512
- Seban!
- Angel!

54
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,478
Dude!

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,279
Dude!

56
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,779
Try giving him some brandy, dude!
- Do something, bro!

57
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,145
- It's working!

58
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,603
- Spray it! Spray it on his body!

59
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,374
- Dude, look!

60
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,705
- He is moving!
Awesome!

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,740
- He has opened his eyes!

62
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,778
- Look, dude!

63
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,473
Honey Bee!

64
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,641
- Awesome!

65
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,544
- He's back to his senses!

66
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,606
Dude! Dude!

67
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,704
He opened his eyes!

68
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,299
Awesome, dude!

69
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,711
Pour some here!

70
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,107
It's working, dude!

71
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,407
Pour some more, you idiot!

72
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,413
It's alcohol. Pour very little.
We need it too!

73
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:09,537
Dude, don't worry! We're
taking you to the hospital.

74
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,168
Shall I give some more?

75
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:14,646
No! Then this loser would say
that he loves Mikhael's wife also!

76
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,548
Whatever said &done, Honey Bee is in
a different league altogether, bro!

77
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:44,445
Seban!

78
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:46,745
Seban!

79
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,645
Seban!

80
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,311
Dude!

81
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,135
Dude, it's me!
Ferno!

82
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,612
Dude, they stabbed
me in the stomach!

83
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,307
I have 2 stitches now!

84
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,706
It's really painful!

85
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,745
Huh?

86
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,045
Sorry.

87
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,011
Sister,

88
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,712
What is he saying?

89
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,168
What is it, man?

90
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,411
Sorry.

91
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,445
Huh?

92
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,511
Sorry!

93
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,510
He's saying sorry!
- Thank you.

94
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:28,977
Seban,

95
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,675
what happened to you?

96
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,511
Sister!

97
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,311
What?

98
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,269
What happened to him?

99
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,641
He jumped into the sea!
Love failure!

100
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,706
His girlfriend is on the
bed in the next room!

101
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,247
These people who want to commit
suicide shouldn't be saved!

102
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,076
Excuse me, Sister!

103
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,278
Now what?

104
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,177
If I get stabbed in the abs,
can I eat chicken?

105
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,474
Great! You want
chicken right now?

106
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,578
What about egg?

107
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,307
- I mean, boiled egg.

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,004
Shall I call the doctor?

109
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,266
I was just asking.
Don't like, Never Mind!

110
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,110
Disturbing me while I'm reading!

111
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,473
The Doctor said that
there's no problem now.

112
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,046
When I asked them
to go ahead <i>&</i> stab,

113
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,143
I didn't think they
would actually do it!

114
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,614
Why does she have tubes
in her nose, dude?

115
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,710
It's painful even to see that.

116
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,138
They are pumping the
water out of her lungs.

117
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,075
Lungs are like sponges, dude.

118
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,340
That can make her
a really sick patient!

119
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,777
Ya rig ht!
Dude,

120
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,979
I've been wanting to ask
this to you for some days.

121
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,179
On that day, did you guys
really kiss each other?

122
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,242
- Yes.
- English or Local?

123
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,645
English!

124
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,511
Awesome, bro!

125
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,204
Don't hit me where
there are stitches!

126
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,178
Hello!

127
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,711
What's happening, dude?

128
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,373
Such a long queue!
- Ya! It's not moving only!

129
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,511
Medical shops should also
follow the queue system of bars, right?

130
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,438
Well, I'm sorry bro!

131
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,478
Why, dude?

132
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,171
You know rig ht?

133
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,712
When you guys
kidnapped our sister,

134
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,475
since we were all pissed, I
had to hurt you unknowingly.

135
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,511
Please forget it!

136
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,666
That's alright, dude!

137
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,702
We can understand!

138
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,407
Shall we have a couple of drinks then?
In the name of friendship?

139
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,442
If you're chill, we'll have four!!

140
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,013
Hey! Shall I also join you?
- No!

141
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,232
Do one thing.

142
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,406
We'll buy the medicines.
- After this queue is done?

143
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,799
We'll buy the medicines later!

144
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,177
Important things to do first!

145
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,576
It's for Ferno's injury, right?
He can wait till tomorrow

146
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,611
Come, bro!

147
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,007
Get me these medicines!

148
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,103
What are you doing?
- Sister!

149
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Get the medicines on this list.

150
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,478
Make it fast!

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,708
Where were you all this while?

152
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,472
- She is okay now.
She has opened her eyes!

153
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,341
- Why did she do it?

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,799
My dear..

155
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,781
- Call our big brother! Tell
him that she opened her eyes!

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,777
We'll do anything that she wants!

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,638
Go bring your big brother!

158
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,079
Sebastian Thampi of 512, rig ht?

159
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,339
The bill is already paid!

160
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,434
Who paid, sister?

161
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,604
I don't know all that!

162
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,673
And if you really want to pay,
give that money to me!

163
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,711
I'll give you!

164
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,505
Get lost, you scumbag!

165
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,711
Com e.

166
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,611
What is this?

167
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,166
Don't you want to go home?

168
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,511
No.. I mean..
We have to pay the bill..

169
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,578
Sit down.

170
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,111
It's okay.
I'll stand here.

171
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,012
Anyway, what you guys
did was really stupid!

172
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,045
Oh my God!

173
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,307
Call 101.
There's no point in flushing this!

174
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,437
It's as big as..

175
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,977
Well.. I was just"
For effect..

176
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,771
You both should
have just told us!

177
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,544
We wouldn't have allowed that wedding
to happen if she didn't like it.

178
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,673
But because of all this, we were
embarrassed in front of everyone.

179
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,474
That was because it was
a last minute set-up. Sorry!

180
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,706
Now, we have to conduct
your wedding function properly.

181
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,674
What about your family?

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,310
For Sebastian, we are
like his daddy <i>&</i> mummy!

183
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,299
He is an orphan.

184
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,278
Poor 9W!

185
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,445
No.

186
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,007
They are in Bangalore.

187
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,472
Both of them are advocates.

188
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,304
I have told everything to Angel.

189
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,112
So if you want us to call them <i>&</i>
tell everything, we'll do that.

190
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,035
Or else, you can
tell them yourself.

191
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,577
Whatever it is, decide soon.

192
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,111
Come!

193
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,011
Dude!

194
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,099
When he said that he has a daddy,
I almost became unconscious, bro!

195
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,511
Why didn't you tell
that to us, dude?

196
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,376
You were scared if
we'd ask you for money?

197
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,504
Get lost you a,6TM,6T"'!
- That's not my problem!

198
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,232
He has vomited even about the
little things in his life to Angel,

199
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,268
whom he met only recently!

200
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,973
Nowadays, male bonding doesn't
even have the value of

201
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,104
the potato 'bonda' at Sulaiman's shop.

202
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:42,166
When it comes to the matter
of chicks, who are we to him?

203
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,199
Dude, don't twist the
situation <i>&</i> make it worse!

204
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,432
I met Angel the day
I met you guys!

205
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,674
So let that be!
- How can we let that be? Right Ferno?

206
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,778
Okay bro!

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,071
E
a

208
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,976
Who are you?
And what are you?

209
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,011
Tell the truth!

210
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,632
Tell me!
-I left my house to get peace of mind.

211
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,611
Whaddaya mean?

212
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:01,745
What I said!

213
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,799
Oh my God!

214
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,211
Is this a stage play or what?

215
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:05,978
Listen to the story you @!,6T"'@$

216
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,102
Oh! So it's a story?

217
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,468
Shut up, dude!

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,999
Here!

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,532
Your story is in your purse?

220
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,603
Where?
Lemme see!

221
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,704
Advocate Tham pi Antony.
Keep it! We can make a roach!

222
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:18,010
You've seen the movies of
actorThilakan, right?

223
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,068
My dad was like that!

224
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,111
Which movies?

225
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,609
A lot from 'Spadikam' <i>&</i>
a lil' bit from 'Narasimham'.

226
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,166
Oh! That's dark!

227
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,145
Seriously?

228
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,704
At home, my pappa, mumma,
relatives, servants;

229
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,703
all of them were geeks!

230
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,075
Money! Money! Money!

231
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,076
They didn't respect
anything other than that!

232
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,636
But you wanted to be a scientist, right?
(From 'Spadikam')

233
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,732
Ya right!
Bullshit!

234
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,732
Will anyone in their right
mind become a scientist?

235
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,406
Even if he becomes one,
what will he make?

236
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:46,707
That machine which
rings the bell?

237
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,277
But I didn't want
to be a scientist, dude!

238
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,311
Then?

239
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,545
Movie star!

240
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,273
Star?

241
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,606
With this dirty face?

242
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,270
Don't laugh it off!

243
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,244
A calling for cinema,
is something else!

244
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,299
Ya rig m!

245
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,302
If you get that calling,
you can't ignore it!

246
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,445
Continue, dude!

247
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,474
Fix a drink!
- Yes of course!

248
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,146
Even though I fell on his feet,

249
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,735
dad was firm about his stance.

250
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,104
And when I realized that they'll send me
to Australia the next day, I escaped!

251
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,366
We know the rest of the story!

252
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:19,607
But what's the problem now?

253
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,307
Even if you have a dad <i>&</i> mom
now, you're like an orphan.

254
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,404
Will that be a problem
for the 'Punyalans'?

255
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,440
Why? Why should they have a problem?

256
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,732
They are already embarrassed!

257
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,542
Now they're ready to get
her married to any idiot!

258
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,375
- Obviously!
- They will get us married!

259
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,047
But that's not the problem, bro.
- Then what is it?

260
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,408
Your family problems?

261
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,771
Don't worry about it!

262
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,466
There's no daddy <i>&</i> mummy in this
world whom I can't impress!

263
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,445
Obviously!

264
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,379
I will just call them 'Daddy',
'Mummy'; with loads of honey!

265
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,707
Not honey!
It's baloney!

266
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,770
Laugh at his poor jokes!

267
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,440
This is why he's gone wayward!
- Ya. Because of me, right?

268
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,638
Not that, dude!

269
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,599
If I tell this to them, they will
give me the green signal happily!

270
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,232
They have so much love for me.

271
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,766
Didn't you say
your dad was like Thilakan?

272
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,440
His mom would be
Kaviyoor Ponnamma!

273
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,666
Hey stupid fellow!

274
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,408
They both love me very much!

275
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,732
Since I said Thilakan,

276
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,644
don't think of him as
a cold-hearted man!

277
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,677
As we keep peeling
off the leaves,

278
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,644
we'll see that there is
nothing inside an onion!

279
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,304
It's hollow!
Fully hollow!

280
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,040
You're a poet &I
didn't even know it?

281
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,977
What is he drinking?

282
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,111
So,

283
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,209
what you're saying is that,

284
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,799
they have lots of love,
but they're very strict!

285
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,778
Right?

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,971
Even they would have some dreams
about their only son's wedding, right?

287
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,332
That means, photos of
girls will be spread out,

288
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,399
mom will say that she needs
company in the kitchen,

289
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,506
you'll hesitate first, then look at the
photo later <i>&</i> say, 'As you wish, mom'!

290
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,466
Then mom will smile <i>&</i>
you'll kiss her cheeks!

291
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:36,699
Like that!
Like that!

292
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,271
Dude, you're like Kunchacko
from the movie 'Aniyathipravu'!

293
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,099
When your poor friends arranged the
wedding after a lot of trouble,

294
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,512
You're saying 'No! Bless us!
Don't curse us!'

295
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,443
Finally, we'll be the
ones getting beaten up.

296
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,106
And you'll be getting the applause,
satellite rights <i>&</i> cut-outs!

297
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,232
Oh God! If we give this
fellow some time to talk,

298
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,042
he'll kill us with these
dialogues of his!

299
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,099
Here! Have this!

300
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,374
By the by,
now what?

301
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,066
I don't know, dude!

302
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:01,172
When I think about it,
my head is splitting in pain!

303
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,143
Difficult thinking!

304
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,111
I have a small idea in my mind!

305
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,132
What is it, dude?

306
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,199
Let me see if it works out.
I'll tell you after that.

307
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,180
That's right! Or else, you
won't let that also happen!

308
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,735
Ya! Ya!
Fix another drink!

309
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,210
This is such a shitty idea!

310
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,372
Didn't he think about it when
he went behind her?

311
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,640
Well, he didn't go behind
her, Mikhael Chetta.

312
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,543
They fell in love.

313
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,447
This is like stepping
on cow dung!

314
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,170
I'll tell you what to do.

315
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,645
I'll fold him into 4 pieces
& ask him to marry her!

316
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,045
He will marry!

317
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,339
Shut up!

318
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,371
You want to get our sister married to her
guy, like you seize vehicles for the bank?

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,037
No, brother! If we have to
be tough, we'll be tough!

320
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,974
We have to make our
sister's future safe.

321
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,204
Why are you creating
such a fuss over here?

322
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,712
Since he doesn't want
to hurt his parents,

323
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,213
he sent these two to
discuss what to do.

324
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,008
It's because he loves
his family, rig ht?

325
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,710
It's because he
loves Angel, rig ht?

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,447
He finds it difficult to tell his
family that he's in love with Angel.

327
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,303
No need! We don't
have to say that!

328
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,776
Just go to his house like this
is a fresh marriage proposal.

329
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,771
Just tell them that we saw him during
some dance programme <i>&</i> liked him.

330
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,206
What say?
- Awesome!

331
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,603
Well.. What if they don't like us?

332
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,699
Why so?

333
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,145
Are you Bengalis or what?

334
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,278
Isn't this like a lottery for them?
-Ya.

335
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,973
But if they know that Angel's wedding
was stopped because of all of us..

336
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,171
Because of all of us?

337
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,013
Well.. All of us.. Right?
- Ya.

338
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,510
But who knows that it was because
she was in love with him?

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,378
She didn't like the marriage
proposal that Chettan brought.

340
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,208
Since she was scared,
she didn't tell anyone.

341
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,380
Finally, she went & stayed over at a
friend's place on her wedding eve.

342
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,276
This is what we have told
even our closest relatives.

343
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,335
Chechi is awesome!
Badass idea!

344
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,110
Well, badass means good.

345
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,641
Right?
- Yes, it is!

346
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,103
It's a crazy plan!

347
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,647
No Mikhael Chetta, it's a superb idea!

348
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,737
Thank you! Congratulations!

349
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,778
Dude!

350
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,305
Then pack our bags.

351
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,774
Are you leaving rig ht away?

352
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,713
We've decided anyway.
So why be late?

353
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,678
Dude!

354
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,269
Darling! We need a treat!

355
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,299
We've solved everything!
- That means?

356
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,371
That means we told everything
to the 'Punyalans'.

357
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,505
It was a heart-melting scene when they
heard about your love for your family!

358
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,705
We were on a roll!

359
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,640
Tell me in detail, dude!

360
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,110
Well, the current plan is that

361
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,474
they are going to your house
in Bangalore right away!

362
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,410
They will present a fresh marriage
proposal like they know nothing.

363
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,479
And your parents will agree!
Hows the idea?

364
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,205
Dude, that's not possible!

365
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,043
It's better to cure Ebola patients
than solving this idiot's problems!

366
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,304
Just talk to him!

367
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,445
Hey Seban!

368
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,738
There is no problem,
like you think!

369
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,006
Everything is set!

370
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,080
Dude, all that's not possible!

371
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,168
Then what to do?

372
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:46,473
Do one thing.

373
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,604
I myself will talk to the
Punyalans tomorrow

374
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,444
And then I can call home, right?

375
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,979
Oops! That's not possible!

376
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,366
Because they have already
left for Bangalore.

377
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,432
Now you can't do that!

378
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,571
Hello?
- Can you hear me?

379
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,703
Are you riding your bike?

380
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:58,745
Pull over!

381
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,144
I can't hear him. Take the phone.
Let me stop the bike.

382
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,766
But they don't know
my address, right?

383
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,043
Ambrose already gave
them the address, man!

384
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,202
And where is he?

385
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,545
He..

386
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,305
He is making some Biennale
artwork on the wall.

387
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,771
Where are you?
- On our way!

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,299
Then come here!
- Just coming!

389
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,540
What's the scene?
Tell me.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,978
He hung up.

391
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,541
Why so?
- Hung up!

392
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,466
My life is screwed, dude!

393
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,969
What's the problem?
Tell me!

394
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,741
They immediately left
for Bangalore it seems!

395
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,404
To my house, with a
marriage proposal!

396
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,173
What's wrong in that?

397
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,545
Not that, dude!

398
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,304
Haven't I told you? They
are all major geeks!

399
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:39,039
And these Punyalans haven't
even stepped inside a school!

400
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,011
Everything will be over with
their first dialogue itself!

401
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,707
- That's a real hot potato!

402
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,603
Tasty, but tough to eat!

403
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,178
Freddy!

404
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:53,009
You've been sleeping since
the time we started! Wake up, you swine!

405
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,504
Have we reached, Antappan?

406
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,066
<i>No Chem.</i>

407
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,740
We've just entered Bangalore.

408
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,536
Now we have to find that place.

409
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,303
Freddy!

410
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,203
2 minutes, uncle!

411
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,607
Let me sleep for
10 more minutes!

412
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,645
Wake up!

413
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,110
Where have we reached?

414
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,506
I don't know! Wake up <i>&</i>
tell me which way to go!

415
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,638
Isn't this Koramangala?

416
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,011
Koramangal?

417
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,411
Hey Colli,

418
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,537
just see, man!

419
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,637
You've brought an expert, right?
Ask him!

420
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,544
I know only the old Bangalore
<i>&</i> Dharmaram college.

421
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,136
Stop it, bro!

422
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:27,611
Let me see!

423
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,210
Oh God!
Please be with us!

424
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,508
Stop the car, Antappan!

425
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,042
Where is this place?

426
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,136
Freddy, where is this place?

427
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,508
We've been going around
for a long time now!

428
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,604
Uncle, I feel like cursing
this Bangalore Government!

429
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,443
If they keep changing the roads every
once in a while, what can we do?

430
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,275
Go ask someone over
there, you loser!

431
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,032
Uncle, what was his name, again?

432
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,274
Advocate Thampi or
something like that.

433
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,313
That won't work out!

434
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,641
There's some 'Parambu'
in his name!

435
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,532
Didn't I tell you to
write it down, you pig?

436
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,705
I was drunk then, bro!

437
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,745
Ya rig m!

438
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,432
Do one thing.
Let me try asking.

439
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,744
Oh Sorry! I speak only in
Kannada once I reach Bangalore.

440
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,302
A <i>gpï¬mfi</i>

441
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,971
Enough of your bullshit.
- Get going!

442
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,410
This is your last chance. If you get it
wrong again, don't get back into this car!

443
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:18,199
I should be blamed for coming
to Bangalore with them!

444
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,372
Where are you going?

445
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,707
I'll take a leak <i>&</i> come.

446
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,578
Hey Many!

447
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,238
What is this, man?

448
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,109
You're pissing in front
of someone's house?

449
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,278
Ya rig m!

450
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,680
Why does one person need
such a huge house to stay?

451
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,532
He might have made all this money by
selling kidneys of poor beggars.

452
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,066
Is that all?

453
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:43,071
He's the type who would beat up his own
dad after getting drunk in the night!

454
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:45,037
So much negativity, man!

455
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,044
Why don't you join a ladies' kitty party?

456
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,408
Hey Colli!
Aren't you a priest?

457
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,574
That was a good one.

458
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,232
Hey Colli!

459
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,179
See!
This is the house!

460
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,110
W my,

461
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,340
Kalakathiparambil.
- No! Kalathiparambil.

462
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,471
And that fool has gone looking
for this, over there!

463
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,644
Freddy!

464
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,269
Hey you, Bangalore expert fool!

465
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,311
Come here!

466
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,138
Colli, wear your cassock!

467
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,769
White or Black?
-Wear white!

468
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,171
We're going for a good deed.

469
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,644
But some curry fell
on the white one.

470
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,544
It's okay, Colli. Wear it upside down.
It's double-sided, right?

471
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,478
Uncle, we should fix this!

472
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,145
Keep quiet!

473
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,512
Yes.
Can I help you?

474
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:38,445
English?

475
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,280
Yes. I want to speak to,

476
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,607
Mr. Tham pi..

477
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,637
Thampi Antony Kalathiparam bil.
- What?

478
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,678
Go man!

479
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:50,778
Uncle, actually he wants to speak to Mr.
Advocate Tham pi Antony Kalathiparambil.

480
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,506
Saw that?
- Saw what?

481
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,274
You just added 'actually'
to what Colli said!

482
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,404
Are you from Kerala?
- Yes. From Kochi.

483
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,179
I am Father Collins.

484
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,574
Isn't this Sebastian's house?

485
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,978
Yes.

486
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,448
We've come with our sister's marriage
proposal for Sebastian, to meet Sir.

487
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,046
Don't worry. This is
not a messy affair.

488
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,636
It's a straight forwardâ
- Take him away!

489
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,737
Hey! No! I didn't
think like that.

490
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,643
Come! Come in!
- Thank you very much!

491
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,279
Come!
- You swine!

492
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,532
Where are you off to?

493
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,206
I'm giving you a dose
once we come back.

494
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,144
You'll correct my English, is it?
- Sit down.

495
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,702
Please sit down.

496
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,238
Sorry. I forgot to
introduce myself.

497
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,366
I am Advocate Marcose.
Younger Brother.

498
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,347
A mmwgn

499
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,673
I mean.. Sebastian's papa's.

500
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,041
Oh! Uncle!

501
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,976
No! Paternal uncle!
- Yes. That's correct!

502
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:38,699
I am Mikhael.

503
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,577
This is Collins.
- Namaste.

504
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:41,999
He is a Father!

505
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,978
I got that!

506
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,377
And, this is Antony &that's Martin.

507
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,277
We are all older
brothers of the girl.

508
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,345
This is Freddy.

509
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,470
A cousin of ours.

510
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,973
I was here in Bangalore for a while.
- Is it?

511
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,733
But it wasn't Bengaluru then!

512
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:55,304
It has changed a lot, right?

513
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,778
Did it?

514
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,377
I haven't felt so.

515
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,501
No?
- No.

516
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,704
Well, would you like
something to drink?

517
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,172
Tea, coffee..

518
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,672
Or something else?

519
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:05,712
Something else!

520
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,366
Tea!

521
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,345
Tea is fine!

522
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,378
Black tea.

523
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,672
For all of you?
- All of us like black tea.

524
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:14,234
Even my brother!

525
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:17,232
Once you go black, you never go back!

526
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,211
Isn't it so?

527
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,541
Please wait.

528
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,541
What was the joke?

529
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,238
Don't embarrass me.
I'll tell you later!

530
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,738
Hey, what was it?

531
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,438
Don't embarrass me.
I'll tell you later!

532
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,711
Ghdys!

533
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,478
Can I get some black tea, please.

534
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,570
So you please wait. I'll
go get Chinjulu's..

535
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:39,114
Sorry. I mean I'll bring
Sebastian's parents.

536
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,608
We call Sebastian 'Chinjulu' at home!

537
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,145
Chinjulu?

538
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,736
Bro, should we skip this?

539
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,237
Keep quiet!

540
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,246
I think they're really boastful!

541
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,472
Chinjulu, it seems!

542
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,976
Sorry! Have you been
waiting for a long time?

543
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,211
No.

544
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,744
I am Sebastian's mummy.

545
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,180
I am Mikhael
Punyalan.

546
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:13,743
Haven't you studied in the '77
batch of Ernakulam Law College?

547
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,445
Yes.

548
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,178
Uncle is bluffing!

549
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,974
He's not bluffing.
He has studied there.

550
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,011
Move away!

551
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,737
Did you recognize me?

552
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,205
Ruby Ouseppachan.

553
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:36,047
You know my husband very well!

554
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,645
Tham pi Antony.

555
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,041
Black Beetle!

556
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,777
Th..
Tham pi?

557
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,610
Oh my God!

558
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,699
Marcose, this is Mikhael.

559
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,771
He studied with us in college.

560
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:01,037
It should've clicked when I heard
Advocate Thampi Antony Kalathiparambil.

561
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,644
But somehow, I didn't get it!

562
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,205
Is he here?

563
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,404
Of course!
I'll call him.

564
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,777
Please wait.
We'll be right back.

565
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,666
Thampi Kalathiparambil. We
were best buds in college.

566
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,408
Back then we used to
call him black beetle.

567
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:16,432
That's nice, uncle!
Just like how he is in the photo.

568
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,413
Such a sweet name.
Black buck!

569
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,208
Not black buck, you fool!
Black beetle!

570
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,345
Who has come?

571
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,741
It's a marriage proposal.

572
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,145
From Kochi.

573
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,178
For me?

574
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,078
For Chinjulu.

575
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,270
Didn't you say no?

576
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,307
Don't you have any sense?

577
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,572
First you talk to
them, Thampi Chettan.

578
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,611
Yes.

579
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,202
How can he get married now?

580
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,738
Does he have a degree?

581
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:49,573
Does he have a good job?

582
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,033
Does he have any responsibility?

583
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:52,445
But we are all there
for him, right?

584
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,670
Well, only people with degrees
should get married or what?

585
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,405
Anyway, whatever you're making through
your hard work is for him, right?

586
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:03,106
And touch-wood, your brain is
still in top-notch condition!

587
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:06,399
Even if you grow old
and become bedridden,

588
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,777
there will be plenty of cash left.

589
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,570
You'll get a mouthful from me!
Get lost!

590
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,410
Ruby, explain it to them.

591
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:15,105
You can explain yourself!

592
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,508
Please meet them <i>&</i>
talk to them, Chettan!

593
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,337
At least consider that they drove
down all the way from Kochi!

594
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,306
Just talk to them, Chetta.

595
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:53,673
I haven't told him.

596
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,278
Sit down.

597
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,104
Have you come for the carol
to grope girls, you dog?

598
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,041
Dude, hold my hand!

599
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,269
Happy Christmas!

600
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,512
Isn't that a movie song?

601
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,103
No,dude!Enough!
Stop it!

602
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,080
St. Mikhael Punyalan got offended
when we sang about Christ!

603
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,699
Yes! Us Latin Catholics will feel
offended if you insult our Christ!

604
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,366
Why? Do you have a different Christ?

605
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,539
Don't mess with me!

606
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,474
Shall we go to this house
with the big gate?

607
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:14,773
It's a nice house, dude!

608
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,476
Happy Christmas!

609
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:26,449
(singing a Christmas Carol)

610
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,137
Dude, come here!

611
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,976
This is that scoundrel Sensilavos' house!
Why did we come here?

612
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:40,445
He won't give us any money!
- Does he have such a beautiful sister?

613
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,604
Let's impress her.

614
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,147
But not with these lousy carols.
Boney M! Let's sing Boney M.

615
00:31:57,067 --> 00:31:59,047
Santa will show you something!
Come on!

616
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,508
Santa caught hold of her!

617
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,738
We might get into trouble!

618
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,466
That bugger is messing up!

619
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,777
Do one thing! You hit on her.
If he can get her, you can too!

620
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,477
Come, dear.

621
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,078
Move!

622
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,374
Handsome guys will stand in front!
Move!

623
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,645
Dude, will I get her?

624
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,043
No, dude!

625
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,011
Don't even try!
- Come. Let's dance! Please!

626
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,472
Please! You can!

627
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,145
Come on!

628
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,732
Just a dance!

629
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:31,406
Ruby! Move!

630
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:35,209
Have you come for the carol
to grope girls, you dogs?

631
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,678
I'll tell you, you pig!

632
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,435
You wanna mess with us?

633
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,207
You don't know who we are!

634
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,310
Beat him up!

635
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,638
So basically, they are also hooligans!

636
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,041
It's like, God took
you guys correctly to them!

637
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,238
No! It wasn't God! I was the
one who took them there!

638
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,302
Dude, stop bullshitting!
Have your dinner!

639
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,347
Why are you doing this
in this condition?

640
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,399
Come, sit down!

641
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,607
Ya right! As if no one else
has been pregnant here!

642
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,273
I gave birth to my Jako when
I washing the cow-shed!

643
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,780
That's why his face looks
like a cows breast!

644
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,243
H
<i>Sh.</i>

645
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,366
Oh my God!

646
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,566
See how obedient she is, after
everything became alright!

647
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,012
I shall happily die now!

648
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:17,604
Uff! Ungrateful fellow!

649
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,702
Serve it!

650
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,405
Let him take it if he wants!

651
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:21,634
Serve it for him!

652
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,278
Bro!

653
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:26,405
Tell them about the love
story after that fight.

654
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:27,535
It's full of twists!

655
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,778
Hello!

656
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,571
Whose love story?

657
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,245
Bro,

658
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:42,477
did I grope her yesterday?

659
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,411
What the hell did you
drink yesterday?

660
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,578
Shucks!

661
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,409
But why did you jump into the jeep?

662
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,078
To give you company.

663
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,247
Chavaro Chetta, I avoided his name
because I know he is your son!

664
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,347
Mam
m

665
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,706
I asked him to leave a hundred times!

666
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,407
You please take him with you!

667
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,602
Leave the other guy as well, Sir.

668
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,376
They are friends.

669
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,478
Don't say that!

670
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,706
He has insulted a girl!

671
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,680
If someone brings it
up, I'll lose my job!

672
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,002
You won't lose it so easily, Sir.

673
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,773
<i>You have HG Ghavards word'.!</i>

674
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,145
PC!

675
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,678
Hey.

676
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,736
I am not trying to advice you.

677
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,173
You are anyway into fights <i>&</i> tussles.

678
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,574
Then why don't you stop studying law,

679
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,344
come there and help
your father out!

680
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:43,208
I'm not able to hit people
like I used to earlier.

681
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:45,577
I have a terrible back pain!

682
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,704
Stop kidding, dad!
I can't do that!

683
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:54,707
Then, shall we leave?

684
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:55,973
We'll finish this <i>&</i> leave.

685
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,479
Okay! I'm leaving!

686
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,012
What's the next plan?

687
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,978
I am going to reform myself.

688
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,012
Why?

689
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,071
I want to marry her, dude!

690
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,771
I will marry her!

691
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,766
He is very stubborn!

692
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,303
With that, he stopped
fooling around.

693
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,566
And became a total geek!

694
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,308
Finally he passed with high marks!

695
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,441
What about you?
- Why ask that?

696
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,238
He failed with high marks!

697
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:28,766
But dad was really
happy when I failed.

698
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,077
He got someone to beat
up people, right?

699
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,774
Back then, I was quite muscular.

700
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,012
Ya!

701
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,637
Around 6-7 feet tall,

702
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:38,214
Then what happened?
One feet disappeared?

703
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:39,245
Get lost!

704
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,640
Then dad handed over
Mangalore region to me.

705
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,237
Fights &tussles!

706
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,607
Well, I was also
interested in that.

707
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,169
With that, I lost touch with him.

708
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,178
Anyway, he married her!

709
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:51,337
That's awesome!

710
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:54,077
And because of that,
she got a nice guy!

711
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:55,112
Right?

712
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:56,979
He is not that nice!

713
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,212
Just average!

714
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,339
Just medium!

715
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,766
We should tell him
about this, right?

716
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,246
I have asked him to come here.

717
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,237
She's quite fast!

718
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,781
Oh dear angel,
I hope the result is positive!

719
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,678
My knees are knocking each other!

720
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,475
Don't be tensed!
Don't scare me as well!

721
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:16,533
How, dude?

722
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,070
You don't know how my dad is.

723
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,499
Hearing him talk, Punyalans
would've beaten him up!

724
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,138
If they have actually
beaten him up?

725
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,975
Then I'll beat them up!
I'll get beaten up!

726
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,032
<i>L'lldie!</i>

727
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,366
All this is because of you!

728
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,539
This is their plan!

729
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,273
You come with me!
I'm there with you!

730
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,507
I have maintained my
body for all this only!

731
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,439
You know something?

732
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,399
Sometimes I go totally
out of control!

733
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,777
I myself have been shocked!

734
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,540
Don't be tensed!

735
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,578
Just be decent.

736
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:40,633
Loo k!

737
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,732
Ready, 1, 2, 3.
Decent!

738
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,337
Say it!
- 1,2,3. Decent!

739
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,378
Go now!

740
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:47,974
Where's my silk boxer?

741
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:49,570
You'll have to buy another one.

742
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,645
Disgusting!

743
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,770
Ah! The groom is here!

744
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,980
Sorry! We became a little late.

745
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:56,672
Seban, come here!

746
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,478
Go!

747
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,270
It's true!

748
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,003
Bro, it's true!

749
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,178
What?

750
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,578
He is like his mother.

751
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,212
Safe!

752
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,009
Awesome joke, rig ht?
- Keep quiet!

753
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,673
Hey Thampi's son!

754
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,240
We have solved everything!

755
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:26,708
Huh? How?

756
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,643
So you didn't have any hopes?

757
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,046
Your dad <i>&</i> our brother
were classmates, man!

758
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,573
They both used to study together,

759
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:38,238
used to eat from the same plate,

760
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:39,711
they used to be best buds!

761
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,344
Whatever it is,

762
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,976
the matter is positive, right?

763
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:47,066
The judgment will be in our favour, right?
That's enough!

764
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,045
<i>How'?</i>

765
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,736
There's a lot more acting to do!

766
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,778
Meaning what?

767
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,480
Dude, we presented the alliance.
They are all happy.

768
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,133
But since we haven't told
them about your love affair,

769
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:57,670
they want to bring you
to meet the bride!

770
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,508
You have to like her!

771
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,178
Ya!

772
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,645
Hey!

773
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,146
When you meet her, will you
say that you don't like her?

774
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,643
He will say that!
He is that type!

775
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,045
Hey!

776
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,606
They will call you.

777
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:14,745
Who?

778
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,378
Your parents!

779
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:17,433
Mine?

780
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:19,539
Our parents are dead!
Or else, they would've called!

781
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,245
Hey! Come with me.

782
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,502
Brother-in-laws are bonding now!

783
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,533
- Father, pour a drink!
- Is this a bar or what?

784
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:31,242
The decision you took so that
your parents wouldn't be upset.

785
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,377
That's because of
your pure heart.

786
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,270
That's why I'm supporting you.

787
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,540
But whatever said <i>&</i> done,

788
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,177
this is an escapist route.

789
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,178
Your dad.

790
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:42,977
He is an innocent fellow!

791
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,032
Hey marriage boy!

792
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,068
Hey! Look here!

793
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,778
Blushing! Blushing!
Shame, shame! Puppy shame!

794
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,503
What did you say? My plan is bad
and it won't work out, right?

795
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,566
What do you say now?

796
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,638
But this wasn't your plan!
It was big bro's plan!

797
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,373
Big bro?
who?

798
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:58,612
Big bro?

799
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,010
Big bro means Mikhael Chettan.

800
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:01,266
Ya right!
Mikhael Chettan!

801
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:04,373
What did you say earlier? You'll
beat up the Punyalans and all that.

802
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:05,674
And now he's big bro for you?

803
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,511
What we imagined, didn't happen.

804
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:09,238
Pick up my phone.

805
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:12,533
Who is this burnt freak?

806
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:14,377
Who?
- Hirler! Hitler!

807
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:15,445
"'5 Papa!

808
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,478
Papa?

809
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,566
Oh my God!

810
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,444
So your mummy is an idiot piece?

811
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,774
Get lost!
- Thank you!

812
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,478
Hello!

813
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,278
It's me.

814
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,978
Where are you?

815
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,778
I am at Punyalan's..
No!

816
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:33,978
At Kuriyachan's Church.

817
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,673
Going for a retreat.

818
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,345
Got it.

819
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,245
You..

820
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:43,337
Can you come to Bangalore?

821
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,278
Are you busy?

822
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,970
No! I'll come!

823
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:48,345
When?

824
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,306
I'll start tomorrow itself.

825
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:08,173
'Making the distances shorter,

826
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:14,480
memories come to me, with a smile'

827
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:20,040
'The flowers that slowly wither away

828
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:24,099
are caressed by the branches on the way,

829
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,483
and adorned as fresh blooms'

830
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:35,271
'Longing for those memories

831
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,507
to come back to me

832
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,213
as the fragrance and
colour of an old page,

833
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:45,476
those long lost memories'

834
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:53,382
'I have only one hope in my heart'

835
00:40:54,667 --> 00:41:01,414
'To reach back to
those past days'

836
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:10,243
'I am coming,
flying with the wings of desire'

837
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:55,109
'0' fresh palette in the folds,

838
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,777
will you give me a moment,

839
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,175
to relish the compassion
of that little playhouse,

840
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:14,210
where tender blooms build walls'

841
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:26,376
'The cold droplets of the gentle
breeze that kisses my soul'

842
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,512
Chinjulu!

843
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,733
Good morning mom!

844
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,645
Good morning!
Did you sleep well?

845
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:03,172
It felt like I was sleeping
after so many years!

846
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,641
Go brush your teeth!

847
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,137
Ya rig m!

848
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,635
Shees h!
Filthy!

849
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,078
Tell me.

850
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:17,714
What's happening?
- You tell me what's happening!

851
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:20,079
It had to struggle a lot, mom!

852
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,437
But it was for the good.
- What was for the good?

853
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:23,978
Not like that.

854
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,669
Our self-respect is more
important to us, right?

855
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:28,713
You won very selfishly.

856
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:31,077
You didn't bother
about others' grief!

857
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,007
Mama!
Don't start again!

858
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,238
Have you thought about your dad?

859
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,973
Do you know how much he
worried about you?

860
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,111
Ya rig m!

861
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:44,768
I'm fed up, mom!

862
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,440
I have to settle down now.

863
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:51,739
So what's your plan?

864
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,506
I'll tell you!

865
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,540
I was thinking"

866
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,542
I was so immature, right mom?

867
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,746
The silliness of teenage"

868
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,374
But now it's not like that.

869
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:05,105
I have a precise
career plan in mind!

870
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,546
My talent <i>&</i> Papa's money!

871
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,775
With these two, I
will be on a roll!

872
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,778
Nuisance!

873
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,608
Why are you going on
calling me every minute?

874
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,766
Won't I call you back when
I see the missed call?

875
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,075
Chinjulu!
- Hang up!

876
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:25,239
You've been getting a lot
of calls since morning!

877
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,176
Who is it?
Is it a girlfriend?

878
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:29,005
No way, mom!

879
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,042
Well, a marriage proposal has come.

880
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,372
Papa will tell you.

881
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:35,166
For whom?
Sicily?

882
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,145
Shut up!

883
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,478
For you!

884
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,466
She is the sister of an
old friend of Papa's.

885
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,775
Papa's friend's sister?

886
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,237
I don't want her!

887
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,008
I'm not interested in going
from this trap to another.

888
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,475
Papa is really interested.

889
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,338
If you don't want it,
tell him yourself!

890
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,378
Don't tell me!

891
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:52,307
It's not like that, mom!

892
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,472
Everything is always curt
& right here or what?

893
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:57,440
If it's Papa's friend's sister,

894
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,310
she would be having an
MBA or an M.Phil, right?

895
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,741
I don't know all that.

896
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,472
But they are good people.

897
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,605
Good family, and a
very beautiful girl!

898
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:08,974
Do you have a photo?

899
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:10,312
Yes.

900
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,569
Go meet Papa first.
He will tell you.

901
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,266
I just told you because I didn't
want you to create a scene

902
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:18,269
when you hear this for the first time.

903
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:19,773
Let me think about it!

904
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,602
What's happening with
your film career?

905
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,708
You had said something about
some reality show, right?

906
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,177
But I didn't see you in any!

907
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,779
That.. That didn't happen.

908
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:46,575
It will, soon.
- I hope it does!

909
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,333
I heard you wanted to
say something to me.

910
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,312
Who told you?

911
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,645
Mama.

912
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:02,440
What is your future plan?

913
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,347
Me <i>&</i> my friends have
started a dance company.

914
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,743
So no more studies?

915
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:15,980
It is said that you shouldn't
ask a man what his salary is.

916
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,309
It's okay.
I'm happy.

917
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,345
That's enough!

918
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,079
You might be able to support a family,

919
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,745
Right?

920
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,575
I'm making whatl need
to survive alone.

921
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,779
But you can't be alone
forever, rig ht?

922
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:33,104
Did Mama say anything?

923
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,769
She said that some proposal has come.

924
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,443
She is the sister of
an old friend of mine.

925
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,705
Me <i>&</i> your mummy's college-mate.

926
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,978
Mama told me.

927
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,578
Have a look!

928
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,142
Only if you like her,
we can proceed.

929
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,511
Don't avoid this, just because
of your grudge against me.

930
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,342
I don't want to see this, mom.

931
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,172
She's a nice girl!

932
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,778
I know.

933
00:47:20,234 --> 00:47:22,180
If you both have found
someone for me,

934
00:47:22,234 --> 00:47:23,338
she will be a nice girl!

935
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:26,739
I agree to this proposal.

936
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:32,613
Chinju, just have a look anyway.

937
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,978
No mom!

938
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,406
I'm not being stubborn.

939
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,542
It's because I trust
you both so much!

940
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:42,245
I swear!

941
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:02,304
Is this a move to defeat me?

942
00:48:03,234 --> 00:48:04,736
Why are you thinking like that?

943
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,445
If it's not like
that, good for him!

944
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:10,469
Anyway, he has become
more matured, right?

945
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:13,445
He has gained some sense!
Good!

946
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,599
Why are you telling this to me?

947
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,671
If you had told this to him,
he would've been happy!

948
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:22,638
'Is it a mirage in your eyes?'

949
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,347
'Is it a colourful spring season?'

950
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:37,048
'Happy days are here to stay'

951
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:40,775
'Our hearts have become one'

952
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,379
'Distances have disappeared'

953
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:55,142
'Will a beautiful smile caress
your lips now, unknowingly?'

954
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:05,110
'This is the day that love is
embracing me all over again'

955
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:10,483
'This shore is mine,
mine alone now'

956
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:14,613
'Will a wave of desire
sing a lullaby for me?'

957
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:23,143
'Is it a dream or is it the
moment that my heart longed for?'

958
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:32,276
'Is it a boon bestowed on my hands,
one that my heart longed for?'

959
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,345
'Silence is ending'

960
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,004
'Tunes are syncing'

961
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:56,209
'Why is it so cold?'

962
00:49:56,267 --> 00:49:59,146
'Both our hearts will have
one voice from now on'

963
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:03,646
'Won't you rest on my shoulder?'

964
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,577
'Won't you shower flowers on my path?'

965
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,380
'It won't be long before the shadows join'

966
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:17,414
'This playful banter
should last till the end'

967
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:27,276
'0' girl, has the day come, when you
will be adorned in sparkling gold?'

968
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:36,176
'Have all the dreams we saw until now,
come true as the days have passed by?'

969
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:45,275
'Is it a dream or is it the
moment that my heart longed for?'

970
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:54,410
'Is it a boon bestowed on my hands,
one that my heart longed for?'

971
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:03,745
Sicily!

972
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,643
After the betrothal,
you'll be doomed for life!

973
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,678
Get lost!

974
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:14,170
Come out, bro!

975
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:15,304
Welcome! Welcome!

976
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,138
Dude, you're looking great!

977
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,740
What happened to his coat?

978
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,599
Nothing!

979
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,045
Shallwe go inside?

980
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,511
Wait! There's a surprise.
- Surprise?

981
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:26,012
All okay?
- Yes.

982
00:51:26,067 --> 00:51:28,299
Come on, Mr. Groom!
Come with me!

983
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,099
You said you don't want to see the girl;
if mama <i>&</i> papa have approved, right?

984
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,078
Come!

985
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:33,738
Tell me what's happening.
- I don't know!

986
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,076
Dude, beware of this one!

987
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,511
I don't know anything!
- Sicily,

988
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,799
we will be late!

989
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,074
No way!
Come, mama!

990
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,166
What is this?
Fancy Dress by the Punyalans?

991
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,169
Let's move away. Or else, we'll
have to be there for every shot.

992
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:47,542
Abu, will the acting flop?

993
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,409
Mr. Groom, meet your beloved in-laws.

994
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:53,074
This is your bride's big
brother, Mikhael uncle.

995
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,273
This uncle was the one who
studied with our papa <i>&</i> mama.

996
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,104
The unlucky poor soul.

997
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,671
And this is Antony uncle.
- Hi bro!

998
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:11,974
Nice to meet you.

999
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,069
And this is Martin uncle!

1000
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:16,770
I've seen you only in a photo!

1001
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,199
Elm
mam

1002
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,599
Shut up!
_ No?

1003
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,342
This will flop! I don't think
their acting will work out.

1004
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,743
No problem!
They'll manage!

1005
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,641
Even if Prithviraj sings very well,
Vijay Yesudas wouldn't like it!

1006
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,509
There's one more brother.
Father Collins.

1007
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,041
He is conducting today's ceremony.

1008
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,109
And these are all your new relatives.

1009
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,144
Sicily!

1010
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,112
Was this your big surprise?

1011
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,166
See!
See!

1012
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,044
No! The surprise is yet to come.

1013
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:44,274
Chinju, meet your bride for the first time!

1014
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:57,732
Who are the remaining five?
They seem like hot chicks!

1015
00:52:57,733 --> 00:52:58,711
Friends!

1016
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,475
Don't decide anything just by seeing
the backside of Malayali girls.

1017
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:04,981
Look at angel's friend. A beautiful
ass, but a terrible face!

1018
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,638
But one of them is Sara's. I know that!

1019
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,578
No!

1020
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,145
Very little!

1021
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:11,337
She's my sister!

1022
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,332
What are you waiting for?
Come!

1023
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:14,368
Are you tensed?

1024
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:16,414
You trust Papa's <i>&</i>
Mama's selection, right?

1025
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:19,311
Find out who is the perfect
bride they chose for their son!

1026
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,212
Shees h!

1027
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:26,245
What <i>s</i> hees h?

1028
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,066
<i>H'</i>
E

1029
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:29,366
What if she has scratch marks?

1030
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:31,108
If she has scratch marks..

1031
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,270
Get lost!
- Shut up, bro!

1032
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:34,438
Shut up, you fool!

1033
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,104
Hey Seban!
Come on!

1034
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,971
Don't be shy!
Go!

1035
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,245
Come on Seban!

1036
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,771
I liked the one who's
standing at the end.

1037
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,274
Who is it that you don't like?

1038
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:13,069
Planned murder, right?
- Tension!

1039
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,312
Over-acting?

1040
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,707
Oh my God!
How is this possible?

1041
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,748
Oh Jesus Christ!
Oh, this is such a miracle, right?

1042
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,006
Don't over-act!

1043
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:25,479
Sir, what a pleasant
surprise it is!

1044
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,146
We were really shocked!

1045
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,702
Fantastic! If it was me, I
would've chosen the wrong one!

1046
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,333
Madam, good selection! Great job!

1047
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:31,472
He is just like you, Sir!

1048
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:33,599
He is as smart as you!

1049
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,670
Oh my God!

1050
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:37,205
Seban, super!

1051
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:40,199
Made for each other!

1052
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,237
Papa <i>&</i> Mummy!
Great thinking!

1053
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,441
You want this?

1054
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,978
Me?

1055
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:49,012
Him?

1056
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:53,645
Dude, come!

1057
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,611
To light one?
- Who knows? Come!

1058
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,544
What is it, bro?
- Don't overdo it!

1059
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,741
You want to make my
dad look like a fool?

1060
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,111
Did we go overboard?
- I told you then itself!

1061
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,544
Like our superstar goes for
these film award shows..

1062
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,601
Just go sit like that.

1063
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,409
You know you've won the award,
but you don't know anything! What say?

1064
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,406
It's not a joke, bro!

1065
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,066
I'm feeling quite
depressed about all this.

1066
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:15,045
Seban,

1067
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,633
don't worry, bro!

1068
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:18,766
Whatever happened has happened.
We can't do anything now.

1069
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,405
But we won't repeat it.
Okay?

1070
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,645
Okay?

1071
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:22,712
Okay!

1072
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:24,745
Nam aste!

1073
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:27,232
We shall step out then.

1074
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,042
Many many happy returns of the day, daddy!

1075
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,272
Whose birthday is it?
Mummy's?

1076
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:32,245
You got the cake?
-It's my birthday! Come!

1077
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,378
What happened?

1078
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:43,145
Did you like papa's <i>&</i> mama's selection?

1079
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,178
Yours?

1080
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,612
Just mine!

1081
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:51,545
Chinjulu,

1082
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:54,505
You're not alone from now on.

1083
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:59,340
There will be a girl in your life
who depends on you, from now on.

1084
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,238
You should be able to
be a very good husband!

1085
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:15,612
Chinju!

1086
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,104
What is this?
- Hey bro! Sheesh!

1087
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,976
Why is such a big guy crying?

1088
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:21,308
It's time!

1089
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,678
Come fast.

1090
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,132
Dude, how was my acting?
It was natural, right?

1091
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,407
This is what you wanted, right?

1092
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:35,735
Get lost!

1093
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,736
My dear brothers <i>&</i> sisters,

1094

these Christian youths who
are about to form a new family,

1095
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,080
would need special
blessings from the Lord

1096
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,115
on this occasion where they
declare their consent.

1097
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:55,239
Let us pray to God to shower
His blessings in abundance,

1098
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,180
upon our dear Sebastian and Angel!

1099
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,478
Angel!

1100
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:07,342
Do you agree to accept Mr. Sebastian
Thampi Antony as your prospective groom?

1101
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,372
I do.

1102
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,204
Sebastian Thampi Antony,

1103
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:19,975
do you agree to accept Miss Angel Mary
Punyalan as your prospective bride?

1104
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:32,512
Say it.

1105
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:34,612
Say <i>m.</i>

1106
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,401
<i>No.</i>

1107
00:58:37,634 --> 00:58:38,612
Shut up, man!

1108
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,038
Didn't he like Angel?

1109
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:49,411
Of course!

1110
00:58:51,467 --> 00:58:55,266
May the God almighty bind
their relationship with love!

1111
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:58,510
Therefore what God has joined
together, let no man separate.

What will we do now, bro?
- What to do?

1138
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,099
We should search for some other dude now.

specialist in such short notice?

That's not a problem!

1144
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,236
Should I bring the dead guy to cook?

1145
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,399
What happened, son?
What happened to him?

1146
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,435
He is dead!
Go inside!

1147
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,673
Bro, I promised this.
Punyalans will kill me.

Bro, be cool!
We'll deal it!

worse situations!

at his face for 2 seconds.

His teeth are protruding
<i>&</i> looking really funny!

01:01:58,234 --> 01:01:59,304
And ya.

1154
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,270

Resting in piece, piece!

1161

This is not fair, dad!

1162
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:17,080
Please change this stupid channel!

1163
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,666
You just shut up <i>&</i> go girl!

1164
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:19,668
You know?

What is this, daddy?

1169
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,641
You're watching these stupid
serials in the morning?

1170
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,337
Did you know? Our
Cheekku Chet-tan is dead!

1171

was the bowel specialist!

And you know daddy? I've taken the
full responsibility for the food!

1176
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:42,045
What happened?

1177
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,333
Mummy, you just keep making 'Puttu' all the
time! - Then will it get made on its own?

1178
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:45,312
Hey!

1179
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:47,438
That bowel specialist
Cheekku Chet-tan is no more.

1180
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,478
Oh Jesus!

1181
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:50,036
So today's function, who keep?

1182
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,478
Mummy, do you by chance knowing any bowel
specialist or something like that?

1183
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,013
What you thinking
so much, my boy?

1184
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:55,475
I'll cook the food!

1185
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:57,199
The best food!
I'll make!

1186
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,611
Yes Ferno!
He will cook!

1187
01:02:58,734 --> 01:02:59,712
Get lost!

1188
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,137
You get lost, you dog!

1189
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:04,771
Mummy, this is not as easy as
how daddy cooks for funerals!

1190
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,699
This is a pre-wedding dinner.
Big function!

1191
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,306
And so many peoples are coming
from Bangalore and all!

1192
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,971
They will curse daddy! That
will be a big shame for me!

1193
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,206
Is it?
- Daddy!

1194
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,466
If you know some other good
bowel specialist, tell me!

1195
01:03:15,467 --> 01:03:17,208
There's someone in
that Kakkanad region.

1196
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:18,706

Mâ?</i>

1197

Qri!

1199
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,166
Check if he's free.
He was my student.

1200
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,113
No need students. Aren't there
any masters, daddy?

1201
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,776
Don't think of him as a student.
Now he's in another league!

1202
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,377
If you're lucky, you'll get him!

1203
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,144
Bro, you reached?

1204
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:34,036
You wait!
I will come fast!

1205
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,710
Daddy, you have any phone number,
something like that of that Ori?

1206
01:03:38,034 --> 01:03:39,138
No need number at all!

1207
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,199
Just go <i>&</i> ask!

1208
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,679
He stays behind Kakkanad Civil Station.

1209
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:42,745
Qri!

1210
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,007
[aim

1211
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:46,068
OK. See you mummy!

1212
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:48,408
Hey! Go <i>&</i> study!
Stupid girl!

1213
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,034
Change the channel!

1214
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:51,799
You stink, dad!
Brush your teeth!

1215
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,778
Get lost!

1216
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,070
He came in a car?

1217
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,272
Wow! A local dog
is wearing shoes?

1218
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,778
Which is this car, bro?

1219
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,411
This is simply a marriage car!

1220
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:00,999
It's his parents' set-up. How's it?

1221
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,377
And where is the marriage boy?

1222
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:03,572
He just went to the hotel now.

1223
01:04:03,634 --> 01:04:05,466
Just now?
So he wasn't in the hotel?

1224
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,999
No! He escaped last night.

1225
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,445
Slept over at our place.
- Why?

1226
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,173
He can't face his
parents, it seems!

1227
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,247
He feels that we're
making fools out of them!

1228
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:15,108
Unnecessary sociology!

1229
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,033
Not sociology, man!
Psychology!

1230
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:18,980
Okay! Whatever!
What man?

1231
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,412
Where is Sara?
Who are you, John Brittas?

1232
01:04:21,467 --> 01:04:22,732
You're asking too
many questions!

1233
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,734
Get in! Let's go!

1234
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,241
Why are you getting angry when
I asked about your sister?

1235
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,745
After all, I'm going
to marry her!

1236
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,342
Why is your face shining?

1237
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,279
I've become fair, right?I had gone
to the beauty parlouryesterday!

1238
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:34,506
And you won't call me, right?

1239
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,045
You got a haircut too?

1240
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,099
But you won't cut
your hair, right?

1241
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,046
But you should've shown
the courtesy to call!

1242
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,266
I'm scared if the wedding would be
called off because there's no cook!

1243
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:45,099
But the people responsible for it
are busy white-washing their face;

1244
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,511
and making designs on their head!

1245
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:47,739
Breathe out.

1246
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,441
Wow! You had a drink
in the morning?

1247
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,033
Where did you get it?
- I got it!

1248
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:53,069
I like a wayward life!

1249
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,477
You want?
Huh?

1250
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:59,511
They have started making these in the
size of the people who drink it?

1251
01:05:02,134 --> 01:05:03,977
Hey dwarf, let's go to Kakkanad!

1252
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,408
I've found a master there.

1253
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,307
This master was my
daddy's student!

1254
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,202
Student or Master?

1255
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:14,644
He was my daddy's student!

1256
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,475
But that student is a master now!

1257
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:17,569
Then say it clearly!

1258
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:18,772
Shall I start?
-Ya!

1259
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,172
Shall we go?
-Ya!

1260
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,010
What is this, Sir?

1261
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:24,712
513, please.

1262
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:26,269
Someone already
collected the card.

1263
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:27,574
Who?
- Your younger brother!

1264
01:05:27,634 --> 01:05:29,477
Younger brother?
- With a lot of hair!

1265
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,699
Ambrose!

1266
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,338
Shall I give you a duplicate key?

1267
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:38,276
He had taken 2 sample bottles of
whiskey from the mini-bar in the room.

1268
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:39,639
Please sign for it here.

1269
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,143
Happy married life!

1270
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,738
How can that be?

1271
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:55,412
No Sensilavos, I had
arranged for it!

1272
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,678
That's what I'm saying!

1273
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:01,574
How did that happen?

1274
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,536
When?
Ya!

1275
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,373
I had arranged for it!

1276
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:08,537
Okay Sensilavos!

1277
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,511
I'll call you as soon as I find out!
Definitely!

1278
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,033
I'll call someone <i>&</i> arrange it!

1279
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,012
Hey!

1280
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:17,970
Mm
a

1281
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:21,145
You go.

1282
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:22,745
A
a

1283
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,410
Call Michael,
and ask him about Sebastian's card,

1284
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:28,366
which has to be submitted in
the Church to the Priest.

1285
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:30,210
I had given it yesterday itself..

1286
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:33,642
You carry on!

1287
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,978
All the best!

1288
01:06:37,133 --> 01:06:38,168
You come inside!

1289
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:41,433
If you sublet the job that was given
to you, is your responsibility over?

1290
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:42,572
No! I'll go myself!

1291
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:44,110
Yes. You yourself should go!

1292
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,799
It's the right
time for that now!

1293
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,076
Then what should I do?
You're saying different things!

1294
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:49,545
Even if I do something
or not, I get blamed!

1295
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,079
Don't shout too much!

1296
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,599
I was the one who was
insulted in front of him!

1297
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,409
I didn't shout! I was
just saying the fact!

1298
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:55,445
What?

1299
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,433
What's the matter?

1300
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:57,572
Ask Papa!

1301
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,476
Where were you last night?

1302
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:01,410
Didn't I tell you to sleep here?

1303
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:02,707
I had some things to do.

1304
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:04,741
Mm
E

1305
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:07,042
Why is he shouting at me, Ruby?

1306
01:07:07,134 --> 01:07:08,299
Who does he think he is?

1307
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,574
Papa, don't twist the situation!

1308
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,566
I had sent Abu to pick up the
people from the airport!

1309
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:12,511
Did you follow that up?

1310
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:14,046
Let me talk! Can you keep quiet?

1311
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,199
Don't ask me to keep quiet!

1312
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,202
If you had slept here last
night, I would've reminded you!

1313
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,008
Let him say what he has to say!

1314
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,666
Abu had called me
after reaching there.

1315
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:22,374
Who is this Abu?
- My friend!

1316
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:25,544
There were too many people!
He brought everyone.

1317
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,375
M
a

1318
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,275
Sensilavos uncle's
daughter from America.

1319
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:31,145
So easy, right?

1320
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,466
What should I do then?
Die?

1321
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:33,571
Lower your voice!

1322
01:07:34,334 --> 01:07:36,177
Thampi Chetta, what is this?
What's happening?

1323
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,275
Chinjulu, why can't you talk softly?

1324
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,437
What's the problem?

1325
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:40,699
Nothing, Vineeth Chetta!

1326
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,509
I missed picking up a
guest at the airport!

1327
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:44,342
That's the biggest crime
in the world now!

1328
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,747
Don't make it an issue.
I'll do something!

1329
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,973
I'll go in my car.
That's all, right? Simple!

1330
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,247
I sent him to solve the
fight between our families.

1331
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,343
You should understand the
value of relations.

1332
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:58,975
Leave it, Thampi Chetta.
I'll pick her up.

1333
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,135
I'll come with you.

1334
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,736
No need of all that. I
have arranged for it.

1335
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,177
The car would be there already!

1336
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:04,304
Then what's the problem?

1337
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:06,745
Ruby, who else would believe
what he says apart from you?

1338
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,302
He opens his mouth only to lie!

1339
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:10,711
No way!

1340
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:12,133
Chinjulu won't lie!

1341
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,579
That's your misconception!

1342
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:16,173
How are you so sure
that he's lying?

1343
01:08:16,567 --> 01:08:17,545
He won't lie!

1344
01:08:20,234 --> 01:08:21,212
Chinjulu,

1345
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,007
call your friend Abu.

1346
01:08:23,134 --> 01:08:24,704
You don't have to go out today.

1347
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,977
We have to go there
at least by 5 PM.

1348
01:08:27,034 --> 01:08:28,513
Thampi Chetta, please
come downstairs.

1349
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,011
Everyone is waiting there!

1350
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,378
Come!

1351
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,699
I'm going downstairs.
Vineeth, come!

1352
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,236
I'll just check..
- Come, I say!

1353
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,272
I had asked him to do
just one thing, Ruby!

1354
01:08:47,367 --> 01:08:49,040
Not because I didn't
have others to do it.

1355
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,102
I thought that fight would
be over if he goes there.

1356
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:52,612
I know.

1357
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:56,080
Let it go! He wouldn't
have understood that.

1358
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:00,272
Abu, I asked you to do
just one thing, right?

1359
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:01,438
What happened, dude?

1360
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,204
Are you at the airport?

1361
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,143
I reached the hotel
with all of them!

1362
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,178
Where?

1363
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:10,646
I am back at the hotel
with your relatives.

1364
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:14,538
You missed a girl at
the airport, you fool!

1365
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:16,377
Oops! Who is that?

1366
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:18,066
My uncle's daughter.

1367
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:21,048
She got out of the international
terminal <i>&</i> didn't see anyone there!

1368
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,799
Hello?

1369
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,337
That was like farting
in a Windstorm!

1370
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:30,042
Fan! Sorry, Key please!
- Where are you?

1371
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,272
315,316,317.
- Hello?

1372
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:34,045
Hello!

1373
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,678
Hello!
- Dude!

1374
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:38,741
Didn't you have a list with you?
- I had a list!

1375
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,371
But these security guys
are such tough nuts!

1376
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:43,471
Others are like Bengalis
who keep saying 'Saabji'.

1377
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:46,105
As soon as they reached, they were
shouting at me to take them away!

1378
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,202
What do we do now?

1379
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:50,441
Ya! What to do now? If they were policemen,
we could've gotten them transferred!

1380
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,241
What do we do with these guys?
- Not that!

1381
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,540
What about that girl?

1382
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,511
I told them that I have sent a car.

1383
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:57,681
You should stop lying, okay?
- Hello!

1384
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,238
Sebastian!
How are you?

1385
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,779
I'm good!
- How are you, young man?

1386
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:04,214
Chinjulu, it's been so
long sincel saw you!

1387
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:05,642
Did you complete your degree?

1388
01:10:07,734 --> 01:10:09,008
Okay, uncle!
Upstairs!

1389
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,312
Hello Mr. Jose!

1390
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:11,402
Thank you madam!

1391
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,544
Why did you laugh?
- I don't know!

1392
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,008
What else can I do?

1393
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:16,341
It's been 5 years!

1394
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,974
Dude!

1395
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,706
It's so hot here in Kerala!
-Ya!

1396
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:27,069
Is he your friend?

1397
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:29,140
Ya! We studied MBA together.

1398
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:32,070
Are they teaching MBA in Kerala now?
- Of course!

1399
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,009
Where's Marcose?
I want to grab a drink!

1400
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,512
He's upstairs.
5th floor!

1401
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,308
Come on baby!
His friend looks like a drumstick!

1402
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:41,733
Who is that, dude?

1403
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,213
That scoundrel is an uncle of mine!

1404
01:10:43,267 --> 01:10:45,269
Just 3-4 years difference.
From Bombay.

1405
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:46,506
Oh! North Indians!

1406
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,203
It will be a little tough!

1407
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:50,366
A hot wife for a weak husband!

1408
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,744
How come you're speaking
Hindi suddenly?

1409
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:53,178
I don't know why, dude!

1410
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:54,699
After I saw that aunty,

1411
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,510
I feel like brushing up on the
Hindi I learnt during childhood!

1412
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,670
A burning desire!

1413
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:00,145
You scumbag!

1414
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,536
Foreign chick!

1415
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:10,079
<i>Wow'!</i>

1416
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:11,674
Will she be that girl?

1417
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,371
Here is Sensilavos
uncle's daughter, Shaun.

1418
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,405
Ask her, if there was a car
waiting for her or not!

1419
01:11:19,134 --> 01:11:20,112
What was that?

1420
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:22,642
Was the car there for you, dear?

1421
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:24,266
Ya! It was!

1422
01:11:24,267 --> 01:11:26,199
I walked around trying to find it.

1423
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,578
I should'vejust
stayed where I was! Right?

1424
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,679
Papa, please!

1425
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,475
Try to understand
me, at least now!

1426
01:11:31,567 --> 01:11:33,604
I have some personal problems
going on in my head!

1427
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,236
Sol am a little absent minded.

1428
01:11:35,301 --> 01:11:38,043
But please don't think that I
am lazy or that I'm a liar!

1429
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:40,707
The confidence you have in these dialogues,
should be there in your actions!

1430
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:43,304
What?
- That means, you are not at all prom pt!

1431
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,569
Things have to be done
when they should be done!

1432
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,045
Not when you feel
like doing them!

1433
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:52,610
Should I go?

1434
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,479
No.

1435
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:09,445
Well, dear..

1436
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,009
Would you like to freshen up?

1437
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,239
Ya! I think that'll be wise.

1438
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:15,506
Just walk her to her room!

1439
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,711
So, what time do I
need to leave my room?

1440
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,541
Room No. 566.

1441
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:24,309
This.. Your room!
You stay here!

1442
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:27,211
One ordinary room-boy will come
<i>&</i> tell you to leave for the program!

1443
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:28,678
Not any other kind of program!

1444
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,433
You know, pre-wedding dinner!

1445
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:32,107
Previous night of wedding, okay?

1446
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:33,508
Why am I saying all this to him?

1447
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,373
Is he serious about
anything in life?

1448
01:12:37,434 --> 01:12:39,277
<i>That's because oi his age, Thampi Chem.</i>

1449
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,677
At his age, even you...
- Yes!

1450
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:44,771
But only because I stopped fooling
around, I reached this position!

1451
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,274
Does he know how to behave?

1452
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,209
Even now, he insulted me in
front of that girl as well!

1453
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:01,978
Buddy!
- Buddy!

1454
01:13:05,034 --> 01:13:07,310
Your mom didn't come?
- She has leg pain, buddy.

1455
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:08,539
She'll come for the
wedding tomorrow!

1456
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,375
Uncle, I'll be right back.
I have an urgent trip!

1457
01:13:10,434 --> 01:13:11,970
You drive a taxi now?

1458
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:13,433
You'll be back before we
feed sweets to them, right?

1459
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:14,766
Of course!
- Antappan!

1460
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:16,099
Then you can go in this car.

1461
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,433
The groom's details have to
be submitted in the Church.

1462
01:13:18,434 --> 01:13:19,999
That priest is quite
a difficult guy!

1463
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,978
Then hop on!

1464
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,546
I am all sweaty!

1465
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,601
I'll send it there, bro!

1466
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,508
Don't forget it!
- No way!

1467
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,145
Come, buddy!

1468
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,202
You have booze, rig ht?
- Come, dude!

1469
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,079
Hey! Careful!

1470
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,044
Who is he?
Sleeping even now?

1471
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,700
This is Freddy!

1472
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:38,366
He is our bartender today!

1473
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,210
So he'll definitely get
beaten up tonight!

1474
01:13:40,267 --> 01:13:41,575
Get up, you fool!

1475
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:44,569
What is this?

1476
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:46,045
George uncle!

1477
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,978
What's on your face? Chicken shit?
- Shut up!

1478
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,508
- I'm coming!
- Hi dear.

1479
01:13:53,634 --> 01:13:56,114
It's on your face!
- One minute, aunty. I'll be right back.

1480
01:13:56,734 --> 01:13:57,712
Hello Angel!

1481
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,748
Tell him that you have called.
Don't say that I called you. Dude!

1482
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,645
Dude!

1483
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,305
Who is it?
- Angel.

1484
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:07,636
Ask her to call later.

1485
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,543
Am I on salary here or what?
Here you go!

1486
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,133
What is it?
-Why can't you pick up your phone?

1487
01:14:13,134 --> 01:14:14,340
How many times did I call you?

1488
01:14:14,434 --> 01:14:16,004
Didn't I tell you that I'm busy?

1489
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:17,700
Mum

1490
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:20,580
When you call, it's either to eat
my brains or to say something stupid!

1491
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,179
Hello?

1492
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:25,679
Hello!

1493
01:14:26,134 --> 01:14:27,112
What is it?
Tell me!

1494
01:14:28,334 --> 01:14:29,608
Nothing!
Hang up!

1495
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:36,773
What happened, Angel?

1496
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,001
Nothing, Chechi.

1497
01:14:41,134 --> 01:14:44,206
Dude, please don't give me the
phone if she calls again!

1498
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:45,678
Why are you getting
so worked up?

1499
01:14:45,734 --> 01:14:47,213
It's just a wedding! It
will happen smoothly!

1500
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,213
Dude, you won't understand!

1501
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:52,305
I am like someone who had
brandy mixed with milk!

1502
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:55,233
Our families won't match, dude!

1503
01:14:55,234 --> 01:14:56,466
Didn't you see them?

1504
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:58,708
When all of them get together,
I don't know what will happen!

1505
01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:01,000
You can't avoid it completely, bro!

1506
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,344
What?
- Brandy & Milk!

1507
01:15:02,434 --> 01:15:04,175
We have to drink it <i>&</i> see!

1508
01:15:04,234 --> 01:15:05,577
What if it's an awesome combo?

1509
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:11,614
Will you catch these
wires if I throw it?

1510
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,338
You've given me enough
trouble already!

1511
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,378
Give it!

1512
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,279
Hey Amy!

1513
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:20,600
Even though it's a wife's duty to
look after a husband's honour,

1514
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:22,547
why are you looking at it all the time?

1515
01:15:23,734 --> 01:15:24,712
Shees h!

1516
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,075
What's wrong with you, dad?

1517
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:28,012
Hey Antony!

1518
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,978
You like it to be free all the time?

1519
01:15:31,134 --> 01:15:32,340
You're such a moron, dad!

1520
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,077
Here you go!
-What is this? Fish gravy?

1521
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:38,273
Vindaloo is not ready yet.
They're yet to start cooking!

1522
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:40,366
Angel, are you free now?

1523
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:41,437
Ya. Why?

1524
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,174
Then go there <i>&</i>
scratch your bum!

1525
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:45,572
Sheesh! He is such a moron!

1526
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,478
Come here, you!

1527
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:52,374
The bananas haven't
been washed properly!

1528
01:15:52,467 --> 01:15:54,105
So any problem?
- No problem.

1529
01:15:54,334 --> 01:15:56,211
Hey! Get some pepper,

1530
01:15:56,334 --> 01:15:57,566
squeeze a lemon,

1531
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,240
and put it into the water when it boils!

1532
01:15:59,634 --> 01:16:00,799
He is awesome!

1533
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,108
He's my daddy's student!

1534
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:03,145
Hey Sandhyavu!

1535
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,702
Yes!
- How's the bowel? Is it fresh?

1536
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:05,745
Let me see.

1537
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:07,545
It's fresh!

1538
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,011
But it's a bull's, not a cow's.

1539
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:10,068
How do you know that?

1540
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:12,743
Did you get some part of the
bull between the cow's bowels?

1541
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,040
Why are you trembling?

1542
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,099
Don't bullshit!

1543
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,443
He's here to bullshit anyway!

1544
01:16:16,534 --> 01:16:19,037
He's already bullshitting so much!
Now you don't start!

1545
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,239
I need two 500 W bulbs there.
Two of them.

1546
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,643
There's a tubelight here, right?

1547
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:24,237
They'll give only tubelights!

1548
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,404
Get the tools. Let's go home!

1549
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,138
Hey! Don't go!

1550
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:28,305
Leave my hand!

1551
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:29,437
I cook with this hand!

1552
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,571
And you want to break it?

1553
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:32,166
Ori!
- Who is it?

1554
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,145
Qri!

1555
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:35,433
Oh Holy Mother of God!

1556
01:16:35,434 --> 01:16:36,538
Who is this?
My Master?

1557
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,978
Glory be to God!

1558
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:40,445
Do you know who he is?

1559
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,478
Ferno's daddy!

1560
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:42,638
Shut up!

1561
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,366
You know who he is?
- My daddy!

1562
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:45,345
Oh God!

1563
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,708
He is my Master!

1564
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,202
You fools!

1565
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:50,711
All of you come and get
blessings from my Master!

1566
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:52,144
No need at all!

1567
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,399
Get a cushioned chair from somewhere!

1568
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,243
Or else, you can sit on my back!

1569
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,466
You will die, man!

1570
01:16:57,467 --> 01:16:58,673
It's okay even if I die.

1571
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:02,978
I'll make a seven storeyed Taj Mahal
with bowels, under your supervision!

1572
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:04,479
Then I'll also join you!

1573
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:06,474
Hey Bina!
Come here!

1574
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:09,043
Daddy, you got 10 Rupees change?

1575
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,099
My son,

1576
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,333
I am totally broke!

1577
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:12,333
Oh my God!

1578
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:13,633
Is this gym-boy your son?

1579
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:14,612
Why doubt?

1580
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:16,738
Then no need of the bulbs.
Tubelights are fine!

Did you?

He is my God who
taught me to cook!

Today, both of us are
going to cook together!

Today is my wedding!

Not today. It's tomorrow!
- Ya! Tomorrow!

card to the Church.

don't create a problem!

It was Papa, right?

We'll come.

I'm brushing my teeth!

We've been waiting for so long!
- Don't drum on the door!

1622
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,273
I'm having a bath.
- I'm not drumming. It's shivering!

Open it fast!

Turn around!
Let me see you!

Wow! What's this?
You stole this from an elephant?

1628
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:18,042
Go out, uncle!
Don't you have any manners?

1629
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,272
Get going!
-I saw your manners!

1630
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:20,312
Push it inside!

1631
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:21,979

We should have a ball!

Is it?

1639
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:37,138
Then come!
- Come!

1640
01:19:37,434 --> 01:19:40,399
God, please give me the strength
to keep drinking like this!

Doesn't look like it!

1651
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:12,711
Should we drink before the function?
- There's no such rule!

1652
01:20:13,134 --> 01:20:15,433
If there's no such rule,
we'll make a new one now!

1653

If there was such a rule, the
cops would've taken uncle first!

1654
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:20,042
He drank the most! I made
all the drinks for him!

01:26:43,434 --> 01:26:47,177
Let's welcome on stage
Father Patrick Augustus!

1751
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:07,203
Hey! Father Collins is
all embarrassed now!

1752
01:27:07,734 --> 01:27:10,066
That last 'Jillam Jillam' was unnecessary.
My leg hurts!

1753
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:12,240
(Mink-Q
ma;

1754
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:13,312
You want water?

1755
01:27:13,434 --> 01:27:15,209
No! It's bad for the stomach!

1756
01:27:29,101 --> 01:27:30,099
Rome!

1757
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,340
Like the pretty girl said,

1758
01:27:31,434 --> 01:27:32,412
Pretty gin!

1759
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:33,979
Rom e! Rom e!

1760
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:36,068
I serve at Rome.

1761
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,144
Ya! As if we didn't understand
that when he said it in English!

1762
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:40,578
For instance, in Rome;

1763
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,600
Important matters or their presentation;

1764
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:45,137
would be handled by elders.

1765
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,372
Not kids like her.

1766
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:49,545
Hows it now?

1767
01:27:51,234 --> 01:27:52,212
Okay! No need!

1768
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:53,438
I am never here.

1769
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,571
This Father translation will
get a mouthful from me!

1770
01:27:55,634 --> 01:27:57,477
Keep quiet!
- Wait <i>&</i> watch!

1771
01:27:59,001 --> 01:28:00,378
Before starting the prayer,

1772
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:02,004
I would like to invite

1773
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,579
the bride <i>&</i> the groom's parents.

1774
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,511
And their god-parents to
please join us on stage.

1775
01:28:06,634 --> 01:28:08,238
Because we need their presence.

1776
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:10,342
And not presents!

1777
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:11,679
What did he say?

1778
01:28:11,767 --> 01:28:13,474
I don't know! Must be a joke!

1779
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,446
Uncle, kick some ass!

1780
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:21,678
Stop <i>m</i>

1781
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:23,007
Bloody DJ!

1782
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:25,245
All the best!

1783
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,179
Hey! Why didn't you play music
when my brother went there? Play it!

1784
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,599
Stop <i>m</i>

1785
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,578
What can I do?

1786
01:28:38,067 --> 01:28:39,045
Okay, now..

1787
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,399
Okay! Let's light the lamp!

1788
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,766
Can we have the beautiful
bride &the handsome groom

1789
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:45,474
to please step forward
and light the lamp!

1790
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:47,545
Hey Sara!

1791
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,441
Wow! Now there's some
space on the stage.

1792
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,478
Nice!

1793
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:02,670
Can I please ask the God-parents
to please step fon/vard now?

1794
01:29:02,734 --> 01:29:04,304
Why isn't he saying anyone's name?

1795
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:06,074
Ya! He doesn't know anything!

1796
01:29:06,134 --> 01:29:07,408
He's just trying to show off!

1797
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:08,445
Who is it?

1798
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,438
What did you do?

1799
01:29:16,034 --> 01:29:17,766
The groom's father is
wearing two coats or what?

1800
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:19,644
That's called a double coat.

1801
01:29:21,534 --> 01:29:23,775
Well. They didn't call
Aunt!

1802
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,070
That's true!

1803
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,578
Aunt!

1804
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:29,979
Aunt, come!

1805
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,712
Why is this loser barging in?

1806
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,466
That was so shady!

1807
01:29:41,467 --> 01:29:43,633
Aunt wasn't called!
-Why didn't you remind me?

1808
01:29:43,634 --> 01:29:45,307
Why didn't you call her?
- What do I do?

1809
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:47,066
That Priest from Rome
did what he pleased!

1810
01:29:47,067 --> 01:29:50,708
It's all right! I'll definitely call you to
light the lamp for my daughter's wedding!

1811
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:53,541
Hey! Our aunt wasn't called!

1812
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:54,579
Pardon me!

1813
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:55,612
Well. I mean..

1814
01:29:55,767 --> 01:29:57,266
Our father's elder sister.

1815
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,712
Should I announce through the mic?

1816
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,677
No! It's okay!
I'll call her.

1817
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:05,345
Aunt, come!

1818
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,112
It's okay, son.

1819
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:08,475
I can't walk!

1820
01:30:08,534 --> 01:30:09,512
You carry on.

1821
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,976
Should we wait?
- No. It's okay.

1822
01:30:12,467 --> 01:30:13,639
I'll be right back.

1823
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,479
Hey! Why didn't you call aunt?

1824
01:30:18,334 --> 01:30:19,312
What to do!

1825
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,706
Aunt wasn't called!

1826
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,168
What?

1827
01:30:25,267 --> 01:30:26,245
Crap!

1828
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,502
Where did you get this guy from?

1829
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,770
From Rome!

1830
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,978
Praying so much?

1831
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:51,333
I think he'll go directly
to heaven from here!

1832
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:52,699
Will you take the bottle with you?

1833
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,366
My dear uncle, let me pray to
God before doing a good deed!

1834
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:58,280
What are the two most important factors
behind a successful family life?

1835
01:30:58,334 --> 01:31:00,746
If the bar was open, we could've
started boozing! This is so..

1836
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:03,266
Hey! For our wedding".

1837
01:31:03,267 --> 01:31:06,271
This family is a perfect
example for all this!

1838
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,481
I can say that with pride!

1839
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,678
Because,

1840
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:12,078
our groom who is going
to get married tomorrow,

1841
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,114
Mr. Sebastian Kalathiparambil;

1842
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:17,114
he didn't want to see the
girl he was going to marry;

1843
01:31:17,267 --> 01:31:19,543
the girl his parents found for him;

1844
01:31:20,034 --> 01:31:24,574
until the day of their marriage
or the day of their betrothal!

1845
01:31:26,434 --> 01:31:29,210
Without knowing if she
is beautiful or ugly,

1846
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,244
without even seeing a photo of hers;

1847
01:31:32,301 --> 01:31:35,233
he agreed to this alliance!
That love, that trust.

1848
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:37,339
Come here!
They don't know anything!

1849
01:31:38,067 --> 01:31:40,240
If his parents have
found a girl for him,

1850
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,371
he
Trusted that she would be perfect for him.

1851
01:31:42,434 --> 01:31:43,412
Hey! Shut up!

1852
01:31:44,367 --> 01:31:47,211
The trust that she would be a perfect wife!

1853
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:50,008
What is this guy saying?

1854
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,778
What is it?

1855
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,070
- That pure love!

1856
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,740
I'll tell you later!

1857
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,404
- Cannot be praised enough!

1858
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:01,747
Thampi's decision, to
join with this family;

1859
01:32:02,034 --> 01:32:05,733
that's the decision of the
entire Kalathiparambil family,

1860
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:08,271
who have come from all pans of the world.

1861
01:32:12,034 --> 01:32:16,574
Even if Thampi had selected
a girl from a bad family,

1862
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:18,400
I will say the truth!

1863
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:19,573
Even then..
- What's he saying?

1864
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:22,000
- We will stand together for that decision!

1865
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:23,139
With one heart!

1866
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,000
Hey! What nonsense is he saying?

1867
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:32,480
Are we such a bad family or what?

1868
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:33,512
Calm down, mom!

1869
01:32:33,634 --> 01:32:34,669
I'll take care of him!

1870
01:32:34,767 --> 01:32:37,179
Go give him one tight slap!

1871
01:32:37,234 --> 01:32:39,100
You want to get me beaten up?

1872
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:40,600
Where's the vessel?
To wash?

1873
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:43,047
Not 'Kundi' (bum),
Kindi (vessel) to wash their mouth.

1874
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,599
What will I do there
without a 'Kindi'?

1875
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,102
They're waiting to give them sweets.

1876
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,700
What should I do?
- Mummy brought a Kindi.

1877
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:50,476
Don't drink too much, Mummy!
You're stinking!

1878
01:32:50,534 --> 01:32:51,700
Get lost!
- Bro, help me!

1879
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:53,146
Then keep that huge
vessel also on my head!

1880
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:54,703
Go! Go there!
- It's so heavy!

1881
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:57,577
I won't consider that you're my son!
- Vice versa! Drunken monkey!

1882
01:32:57,634 --> 01:32:59,375
Hey Master! We're going
to give them sweets.

1883
01:32:59,434 --> 01:33:02,066
We can serve dinner after that, right?
- We can send these munchies before that.

1884
01:33:02,067 --> 01:33:04,166
Move! Let the drunkards be happy!

1885
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,145
Cheers!

1886
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,146
Dinner will be served
in 33 minutes!

1887
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,338
Give me my glass back!

1888
01:33:08,534 --> 01:33:10,166
Hey! Should I send 2 boys here?

1889
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,433
Hey! I'm not that type!

1890
01:33:11,434 --> 01:33:12,433
Boys?

1891
01:33:12,434 --> 01:33:13,412
Draw the cross.

1892
01:33:14,467 --> 01:33:16,099
- Hey! That's not rig ht!

1893
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,138
That's not a cross! It's
the multiplication sign!

1894
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,044
It should be longer to
the left side, Father!

1895
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,699
A little more longer!

1896
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,399
Father Collins, teach
them how to drawa cross!

1897
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,038
Why are you sitting there
rubbing your beard?

1898
01:33:29,134 --> 01:33:31,307
Father, one minute!

1899
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,546
Father, this has to
be done smoothly.

1900
01:33:34,634 --> 01:33:37,533
It's because you studied in Rome.
I'll show you how it is done here.

1901
01:33:37,534 --> 01:33:38,512
Ya? Give me!

1902
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:40,666
Please move that side.

1903
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:42,340
Many, give me the rosary!

1904
01:33:45,267 --> 01:33:46,575
You have to..
Or else, wait! Aunt!

1905
01:33:46,634 --> 01:33:47,612
Aunt, come!

1906
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,745
Our Aunt in the house, baby!

1907
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:54,005
Please draw a cross!

1908
01:33:56,134 --> 01:33:57,477
See! Learn from her!

1909
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:00,475
That's how a cross should be!

1910
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,344
Ask everyone if we can
give them sweets!

1911
01:34:04,401 --> 01:34:05,533
Shall we feed them sweets?

1912
01:34:05,534 --> 01:34:07,013
Can't hear you!

1913
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:08,739
Shall we feed them sweets?

1914
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
No!

1915
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:11,000
Go ahead!

1916
01:34:11,001 --> 01:34:11,979
Shall we feed them?

1917
01:34:12,034 --> 01:34:13,479
Go ahead!

1918
01:34:14,467 --> 01:34:16,003
<i>Ya'. Come on'.
Pasâ</i>

1919
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,546
Before they change their mind.

1920
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:36,799
Son,

1921
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,279
half-coo ked,

1922
01:34:38,334 --> 01:34:40,007
the salt hasn't mixed properly!

1923
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:42,307
Salt level is correct!
- It has to boil a little more.

1924
01:34:42,434 --> 01:34:45,633
If it's boiled beyond a point,
then it becomes useless!

1925
01:34:45,634 --> 01:34:46,700
What?

1926
01:34:46,701 --> 01:34:49,580
I was just saying that if it gets
boiled too much, it's useless!

1927
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:51,206
Get some curd, man!

1928
01:34:51,267 --> 01:34:53,611
Why?
- Not for you! For this dish!

1929
01:34:55,534 --> 01:34:56,512
Dear friends,

1930
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:59,079
I don't know how
to give a speech.

1931
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,443
But still, today I want
to speak a few words.

1932
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,535
You talk, man!

1933
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:09,378
I am as happy as a shepherd
who found his lost sheep.

1934
01:35:09,701 --> 01:35:14,616
The one who was with me to share the
happiness <i>&</i> sorrows of my life,

1935
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,078
my friend!

1936
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,378
ThLlmpi!
(Dragonï¬y)

1937
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,778
Sorry.

1938
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:21,771
He doesn't like to be called that.

1939
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:24,410
My black lamb!

1940
01:35:25,067 --> 01:35:27,479
Or else, a black sheep!

1941
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,977
Or else, a black beetle!

1942
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:34,075
What is he saying?

1943
01:35:34,134 --> 01:35:37,377
I said earlier, that I'm not a
great speaker. - It's a joke!

1944
01:35:37,467 --> 01:35:38,766
But my friend is not like that.

1945
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:40,000
Back in college,

1946
01:35:40,001 --> 01:35:43,278
the competition was only for
the 2nd place in elocution!

1947
01:35:43,334 --> 01:35:44,312
Because,

1948
01:35:44,367 --> 01:35:47,610
the first prize always
belonged to my dear friend!

1949
01:35:47,734 --> 01:35:49,145
In this happy occasion,

1950
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:53,546
I invite my friend to speak a few words.

1951
01:35:55,467 --> 01:35:58,209
All my prayers to
the bride <i>&</i> groom!

1952
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,981
You said he's a great speaker.
Why isn't he talking?

1953
01:36:05,334 --> 01:36:09,476
- Now everyone can take photos with the
couple <i>&</i> convey your wishes to them.

1954
01:36:10,067 --> 01:36:11,045
- Thank you.

1955
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:14,437
What all did you say?

1956
01:36:15,067 --> 01:36:16,045
Black sheep?

1957
01:36:16,234 --> 01:36:17,269
So foolish!

1958
01:36:18,201 --> 01:36:19,179
Hey! It's okay!

1959
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:25,779
Friends,

1960
01:36:26,034 --> 01:36:28,241
the food <i>&</i> beverages counters are open!

1961
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:28,633
Men to the left,
Ladies to the rig ht!

1962
01:36:28,634 --> 01:36:30,375
Men to the left,
Ladies to the rig ht!

1963
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:32,207
Go wherever!
Bar is on that side!

1964
01:36:33,234 --> 01:36:34,975
Hold this!
Stand properly!

1965
01:36:35,034 --> 01:36:36,308
Move, bro!
Let me get a drink!

1966
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:38,244
Move away!

1967
01:36:38,534 --> 01:36:40,571
Freddy, one drink for me!

1968
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:42,511
Get lost you fool!
You want more?

1969
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,541
Hey! ls there only one counter?

1970
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:45,771
Get lost!

1971
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,671
Freddy, this will go out of control!

1972
01:36:48,734 --> 01:36:50,077
We'll be screwed!

1973
01:36:52,234 --> 01:36:54,305
He gave everyone except us! Pig!

1974
01:36:55,067 --> 01:36:56,239
Brothers <i>&</i> sisters,

1975
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,278
Thank you!

1976
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,780
Captain Francis has gone up to sing!

1977
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,100
Break a leg!

1978
01:37:01,101 --> 01:37:03,308
Tonight is a great night!

1979
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,243
My dear's wedding
has been fixed!

1980
01:37:07,367 --> 01:37:08,345
Thank you dear.

1981
01:37:12,434 --> 01:37:14,243
My dear friends,

1982
01:37:14,434 --> 01:37:17,574
back in 1987, I was a soldier.

1983
01:37:18,101 --> 01:37:20,741
Back then, on the last
day of the Kargil war,

1984
01:37:21,034 --> 01:37:28,612
Major Rathanbor Singh played
this song on his mouth-organ.

1985
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:30,639
It's such a beautiful song!

1986
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:32,268
Karaoke, please!

1987
01:37:50,167 --> 01:37:52,340
'Aren't you interested
in this marriage?'

1988
01:37:54,634 --> 01:37:56,443
'What?
Did I say anything like that?'

1989
01:38:00,234 --> 01:38:02,407
'What?
Did I say anything like that?'

1990
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,544
'From your face, it looks like that.
What's your problem?'

1991
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,537
'From your face, it looks like that.
What's your problem?'

1992
01:38:17,334 --> 01:38:20,645
'I don't have any problem.
Just give me some peace of mind.'

1993
01:38:24,101 --> 01:38:26,741
'So you've already lost your
peace of mind because of me?'

1994
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:33,216
'No! Not like that!
You won't understand!'

1995
01:38:37,467 --> 01:38:39,242
I want to talk to you!

1996
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,145
Hey! Continue!

1997
01:38:47,434 --> 01:38:48,742
Enough of old songs!

1998
01:38:48,801 --> 01:38:50,144
Listen to new songs!

1999
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:54,302
Recognized them?

2000
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:55,640
He's working in the Navy.

2001
01:38:58,634 --> 01:39:00,204
He is Sebastian's uncle' son.

2002
01:39:02,467 --> 01:39:03,445
Okay dear.

2003
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:04,479
Just a minute.

2004
01:39:05,701 --> 01:39:08,181
I want to talk to Sebastian.

2005
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,478
Please.

2006
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:12,179
Thank you!

2007
01:39:17,634 --> 01:39:18,612
Don't worry!

2008
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,147
Hello! Did you recognize us?
- Of course!

2009
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:28,009
Then tell me!
Who are we?

2010
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:29,569
We've played a lot
during childhood!

2011
01:39:29,634 --> 01:39:30,669
I remember.

2012
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:34,307
How would you know? Uncle
was talking about Angel!

2013
01:39:34,434 --> 01:39:36,233
Angel has told me about it.

2014
01:39:36,234 --> 01:39:38,077
She will say it!
She is my dearest!

2015
01:39:38,134 --> 01:39:39,272
We're leaving, Angel!

2016
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,677
I have told your brother.

2017
01:39:46,667 --> 01:39:48,203
Chinju, just go with her.

2018
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:50,310
She wants to say something to you.

2019
01:39:50,534 --> 01:39:52,207
What?
- How would I know?

2020
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:54,643
You guys haven't talked
properly even once, rig ht?

2021
01:39:54,701 --> 01:39:55,766
Just go!

2022
01:39:55,767 --> 01:39:56,745
No, mom!

2023
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,178
Go!

2024
01:39:58,234 --> 01:40:00,800
Why do you want to talk
to him so urgently?

2025
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:02,366
You don't have to know all that!

2026
01:40:02,367 --> 01:40:04,506
Just do what I asked you to do.
- Now you're blaming me?

2027
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:06,079
Hey!

2028
01:40:06,134 --> 01:40:08,011
Don't mess up <i>&</i> cause
disgrace to the family!

2029
01:40:08,067 --> 01:40:09,045
Go!

2030
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:12,645
What is it?

2031
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:15,612
Close the door.

2032
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,333
Whatever it is, blurt it out fast!
- I don't want to blurt it out so fast!

2033
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:23,608
What's your problem?

2034
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:25,366
What did you tell my mom?

2035
01:40:25,367 --> 01:40:26,778
That's not the answer
to my question.

2036
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,199
Anwer me first!

2037
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,180
I will! If you ask me properly, I will.

2038
01:40:30,267 --> 01:40:31,268
I don't want to!

2039
01:40:31,334 --> 01:40:32,642
Did you call me to teach
me how to behave?

2040
01:40:32,734 --> 01:40:34,611
Don't you know how to
say something properly?

2041
01:40:34,667 --> 01:40:37,079
Why are you raising your voice?
What's your complex?

2042
01:40:37,534 --> 01:40:38,672
I don't have any complex!

2043
01:40:38,734 --> 01:40:41,340
I'm getting irritated by what
you &yourfamily are doing!

2044
01:40:41,434 --> 01:40:42,640
What did we do?

2045
01:40:42,734 --> 01:40:45,476
And, when you're talking to
me, talk about me alone!

2046
01:40:45,534 --> 01:40:47,104
Don't drag my family into this!

2047
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:49,374
Only I have the misfortune
of putting up with you!

2048
01:40:49,434 --> 01:40:51,311
Why the hell did I..

2049
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:52,471
Come to call me?

2050
01:40:52,534 --> 01:40:53,740
Even I can think that way!

2051
01:41:10,134 --> 01:41:12,637
The Finisher!
Finisher!

2052
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:16,200
Fisherman?
- Not Fisherman! Finisher!

2053
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:17,200
That means,

2054
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:18,475
this drink right here..

2055
01:41:19,701 --> 01:41:20,702
After you drink it,

2056
01:41:20,767 --> 01:41:23,043
If you have take a piece
of this and slowly..

2057
01:41:24,067 --> 01:41:25,300
And chew it like this,

2058
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:29,147
even the CBI can't find out the effect
of the drinks we had until then!

2059
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,270
Hows that?
- Awesome!

2060
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:31,478
Ferno!

2061
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,040
Ferno!
- Yes, man!

2062
01:41:34,034 --> 01:41:35,775
Yes. Tell me.
- I need some booze.

2063
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:37,445
Come on!

2064
01:41:37,501 --> 01:41:39,242
'What a smell!'

2065
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:41,281
'What a beauty!'

2066
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:43,007
'I lifted the spatula'

2067
01:41:43,067 --> 01:41:44,137
Taste it, Master!

2068
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,378
How is it?

2069
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,646
It's amazing!

2070
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,766
All because of your
blessings, Master!

2071
01:41:50,767 --> 01:41:52,110
Where are you taking the groom?

2072
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:54,511
We're going to take a leak.
- Why are you going outside for that?

2073
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,103
There's a toilet inside.
Go there!

2074
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:57,737
He has a slight
kidney stone problem!

2075
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,110
So if he pisses in a commode, the
stone might break it. That's why!

2076
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:01,339
Mi!
a

2077
01:42:01,434 --> 01:42:03,004
Okay!
- Disgraced me!

2078
01:42:03,067 --> 01:42:05,069
We're going to serve the food!
- Don't worry!

2079
01:42:05,167 --> 01:42:06,145
Master's son!

2080
01:42:06,234 --> 01:42:07,508
See that it doesn't
fall on your legs!

2081
01:42:07,568 --> 01:42:08,740
We'll sit & piss!

2082
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,375
Are you guys hiding out here?
Bloody pigs!

2083
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,002
Dude, fix a drink!

2084
01:42:16,134 --> 01:42:17,477
Yeah! Come on!

2085
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,572
Fix one for me too!

2086
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:24,079
Stop irritating!

2087
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:26,078
Hello! Excuse me!

2088
01:42:26,134 --> 01:42:27,533
Freddy, give some soda!
- Freddy?

2089
01:42:27,534 --> 01:42:28,535
Here's your soda!

2090
01:42:29,201 --> 01:42:30,179
Freddy!

2091
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:32,638
What are you blabbering there?

2092
01:42:32,734 --> 01:42:35,237
Mg
ails

2093
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:36,473
Don't create a scene.

2094
01:42:37,134 --> 01:42:38,272
I need two drinks.

2095
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:39,711
One for our Thampichayan.

2096
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:41,041
One for your Mikhael Chettan.

2097
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:42,533
Thampi Sir started drinking?
- Of course!

2098
01:42:42,534 --> 01:42:43,512
Great!

2099
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:46,200
Our ambience is like that. Even
teetotallers will start drinking!

2100
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,339
Don't worry about the bottle.

2101
01:42:47,434 --> 01:42:48,469
The stuff is scotch!

2102
01:42:48,533 --> 01:42:49,477
Is it?

2103
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:51,979
Oh! So there are two
kinds of booze here?

2104
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,233
Uncle, they are from
the groom's side!

2105
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:55,770
What's so special about them?
- Get lost!

2106
01:42:56,634 --> 01:42:57,612
Hi Brother!

2107
01:42:58,467 --> 01:43:00,071
What is this?
- It's Scotch!

2108
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:01,466
Scotch?
- Only for relatives!

2109
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,071
Its
a

2110
01:43:03,134 --> 01:43:04,477
No! Thank you!
- Enjoy!

2111
01:43:04,534 --> 01:43:05,706
I'll do the needful!

2112
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Hey Seban!

2113
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:09,633
This is too much!

2114
01:43:09,634 --> 01:43:13,138
Today is your pre-wedding
dinner &you'll be stinking!

2115
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:15,203
He'll be smelling,
but not stinking!

2116
01:43:15,734 --> 01:43:17,533
I think everyone has gone crazy!

2117
01:43:17,534 --> 01:43:18,604
What do you mean?

2118
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:20,133
Dad is really upset!

2119
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:21,112
Why should he?

2120
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:22,179
I don't know!

2121
01:43:22,434 --> 01:43:24,141
Mom's mental torturing
on the other side!

2122
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:25,179
Why, man?

2123
01:43:26,001 --> 01:43:27,605
Because I didn't
say sorry to dad.

2124
01:43:27,667 --> 01:43:29,044
Just go say it, dude!

2125
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,773
By the by, what
happened to Angel?

2126
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:33,441
She is the worst!

2127
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,278
Get lost, dude!

2128
01:43:36,234 --> 01:43:38,612
I can't understand what
his problem is, Sara!

2129
01:43:40,034 --> 01:43:42,674
Ever since the wedding was fixed,
he has been behaving indifferently!

2130
01:43:44,234 --> 01:43:46,077
He is completely avoiding me!

2131
01:43:46,667 --> 01:43:48,476
Didn't you try talking to him?

2132
01:43:48,667 --> 01:43:50,476
I have to get through
to him to talk, right?

2133
01:43:51,467 --> 01:43:54,676
Wheneverl call him, he's
either angry, sadistic or busy!

2134
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,280
Can't he smile at
least on this day?

2135
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:04,273
I went along with him when he
came <i>&</i> called me one night!

2136
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:06,713
So he must be giving me
only that much value!

2137
01:44:07,701 --> 01:44:09,305
Don't think like that and all!

2138
01:44:09,434 --> 01:44:10,640
I Will talk to him!

2139
01:44:14,267 --> 01:44:17,033
You should've conducted
this wedding in Bombay.

2140
01:44:17,034 --> 01:44:18,466
Mm
E

2141
01:44:18,467 --> 01:44:20,413
My entire business is in Bombay.

2142
01:44:20,634 --> 01:44:21,612
Not just that,

2143
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:25,308
Thampi Chettan will understand the
difficulties of a busy businessman!

2144
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,238
This is Angel's brother.
Mikhael!

2145
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,711
I'm a businessman from Bombay.

2146
01:44:32,734 --> 01:44:34,111
Hey. Just a minute!

2147
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:35,578
A
a

2148
01:44:41,401 --> 01:44:42,379
Do you have any problem?

2149
01:44:43,101 --> 01:44:44,205
What problem?

2150
01:44:44,367 --> 01:44:47,405
Did you feel bad when I
called you a sheep earlier?

2151
01:44:48,534 --> 01:44:49,604
No, man!
No way!

2152
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:51,672
Why is your face grumpy then?

2153
01:44:54,801 --> 01:44:56,144
As a father,

2154
01:44:56,367 --> 01:44:57,437
I am a failure, buddy!

2155
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,070
Dude, he is just..

2156
01:44:59,134 --> 01:45:00,442
I'm not blaming him.

2157
01:45:03,034 --> 01:45:04,012
His mind,

2158
01:45:04,434 --> 01:45:05,538
likes &dislikes;

2159
01:45:06,434 --> 01:45:07,777
I never understood any of that!

2160
01:45:09,301 --> 01:45:11,338
Even the love he's
giving me right now,

2161
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:17,009
I doubt if it's because
of his helplessness!

2162
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:19,738
I'm his father, right?
- What are you doing?

2163
01:45:21,567 --> 01:45:23,012
Anything serious?

2164
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:24,045
Hey! Nothing!

2165
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:27,271
You guys talk.
I'll be right back.

2166
01:45:29,201 --> 01:45:30,179
What happened?

2167
01:45:33,767 --> 01:45:34,745
Ru by!

2168
01:45:35,034 --> 01:45:37,708
Has he told you any time that he
doesn't want this alliance?

2169
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:40,045
No!

2170
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:45,472
Did he say something?

2171
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:48,645
No!

2172
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,138
Come here!

2173
01:45:56,201 --> 01:45:57,646
Where are you taking me?
What is it?

2174
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,770
Hey!
- Come!

2175
01:46:02,067 --> 01:46:03,045
What is your problem?

2176
01:46:03,134 --> 01:46:05,512
There are many problems. Can you
solve all of them together?

2177
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:07,171
Hey! I'm not in a mood for your crap!

2178
01:46:07,234 --> 01:46:09,271
What's the problem with Angel?
- She's crazy!

2179
01:46:09,401 --> 01:46:11,403
She doesn't have any problem!
You have gone crazy!

2180
01:46:11,467 --> 01:46:13,003
I came after talking to her!

2181
01:46:13,067 --> 01:46:15,513
She wants to talk to you.
Why aren't you talking to her?

2182
01:46:16,134 --> 01:46:18,978
There are a hundred other
problems in my head, Sara!

2183
01:46:19,034 --> 01:46:20,138
Try to understand!

2184
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,703
That's what I'm also asking!
What's your problem?

2185
01:46:26,334 --> 01:46:29,699
- But I like you the most among
the people from Bangalore!

2186
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,399
Listen to me!
But..

2187
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,378
- Gone?

2188
01:46:34,334 --> 01:46:35,506
What is it, Chechi?

2189
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,678
Vineeth,

2190
01:46:36,767 --> 01:46:38,144
did you see Chinjulu?

2191
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,737
He was drinking along with
his friends in a car.

2192
01:46:42,734 --> 01:46:43,974
Should I call him?

2193
01:46:44,134 --> 01:46:45,112
No!

2194
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,006
I was invited! I didn't barge in!

2195
01:46:48,067 --> 01:46:49,500
It's okay, Freddy.
Give it to uncle!

2196
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:51,174
Who's your uncle, rascal?

2197
01:46:52,067 --> 01:46:54,707
I didn't come here to eat & drink for free!

2198
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:56,633
These people in formal dresses
are creating problems!

2199
01:46:56,634 --> 01:46:58,443
Then here you go!
I'm local now!

2200
01:46:58,534 --> 01:47:00,241
It's okay!
Give him the drink.

2201
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,302
Get ma, you pig!
<i>_</i> Talk properly!

2202
01:47:02,367 --> 01:47:03,675
Or else, he'll bash you up!

2203
01:47:03,734 --> 01:47:05,407
Getting it for free, right?
Gulp it down!

2204
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,139
Do you have such priests
from Rome in your family?

2205
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:10,477
Of course! Four of them,
including Daddy's uncle!

2206
01:47:10,534 --> 01:47:12,707
So you just have to stand
there for the wedding?

2207
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,566
They will conduct the function, rig ht?

2208
01:47:14,567 --> 01:47:15,545
Son!

2209
01:47:16,301 --> 01:47:17,507
Did you see Sebastian?

2210
01:47:17,601 --> 01:47:19,012
Isn't he on the stage?

2211
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,178
No.

2212
01:47:22,267 --> 01:47:23,405
He didn't come here, mom!

2213
01:47:23,467 --> 01:47:25,378
No?
- I'll take you to him. Come!

2214
01:47:26,601 --> 01:47:28,512
Any problem?

2215
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:32,709
I feel that everyone are making
fools out of my dad &mom!

2216
01:47:33,401 --> 01:47:34,345
Dude,

2217
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,580
Aren't you doing this for them?

2218
01:47:37,134 --> 01:47:39,614
Even if it's a lie, you're
not hurting anyone!

2219
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:40,645
Then what?

2220
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,073
You won't understand, Sara.

2221
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,246
I feel that they're being
made into complete idiots!

2222
01:47:48,634 --> 01:47:50,011
None of this was needed!

2223
01:47:51,334 --> 01:47:54,747
But taking your anger out on Angel,

2224
01:47:55,067 --> 01:47:56,444
is meaningless, Seban.

2225
01:47:56,667 --> 01:47:59,079
Today is a very important
day in her life..

2226
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:09,205
What's happening here?

2227
01:48:09,467 --> 01:48:10,445
What?

2228
01:48:11,567 --> 01:48:12,545
What is it?

2229
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,505
Why did you lock the room?
- What if we lock it?

2230
01:48:15,567 --> 01:48:18,343
This is not so right!
That's all!

2231
01:48:18,734 --> 01:48:20,577
Such a filthy mind you have!

2232
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:21,737
What is it, dude?

2233
01:48:22,134 --> 01:48:23,112
What?

2234
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,100
What?

2235
01:48:25,101 --> 01:48:26,512
That's what I asked.
What's happening?

2236
01:48:26,767 --> 01:48:27,745
Get going!

2237
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:30,514
You can do your new-generation
stuff in the movies! Get going!

2238
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:33,309
Doing stuff behind locked doors
isn't right! - He is blabbering!

2239
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:36,037
Just a minute, dear.

2240
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:40,145
Go inside.

2241
01:48:46,734 --> 01:48:48,111
What's your intention?

2242
01:48:48,601 --> 01:48:50,137
That old man was just..

2243
01:48:50,467 --> 01:48:51,445
Did you booze?

2244
01:48:53,234 --> 01:48:54,372
What's wrong with you?

2245
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:56,510
Why are you behaving
so indifferently?

2246
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,180
What heinous sin did
Papa do to you?

2247
01:48:59,367 --> 01:49:00,710
Mom, you don't know what it is..

2248
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:02,371
Don't try to give
me explanations!

2249
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,406
Papa cried in front of me!

2250
01:49:04,701 --> 01:49:06,146
You haven't grown that much!

2251
01:49:06,401 --> 01:49:07,379
Mom, I...

2252
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:14,578
You didn't like Angel or what?

2253
01:49:15,434 --> 01:49:17,505
There's no need to spoil a
girl's life unnecessarily.

2254
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,778
Son,

2255
01:49:22,601 --> 01:49:24,239
don't you want this marriage?

2256
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:27,379
In.

2257
01:49:27,667 --> 01:49:29,010
I don't know.

2258
01:49:29,734 --> 01:49:31,179
I can't handle this!

2259
01:49:40,334 --> 01:49:43,076
Master, when I made a curry with
a whale's bowels in the ship..

2260
01:49:43,134 --> 01:49:44,636
Boss, there's an issue!

2261
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:45,678
What is it?

2262
01:49:45,767 --> 01:49:49,078
Master, if we try hard, can
we cook some Biriyani now?

2263
01:49:49,134 --> 01:49:50,133
Huh?

2264
01:49:50,134 --> 01:49:51,340
What nonsense?

2265
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,099
No need chicken or mutton!
Fish is fine!

2266
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:55,171
I'll get some fresh
tuna from the market!

2267
01:49:55,267 --> 01:49:57,269
Why? What's the matter?
- Tell me dear!

2268
01:49:57,334 --> 01:49:58,677
Well, it's nothing!

2269
01:49:58,767 --> 01:50:00,269
Some people in the groom's family,

2270
01:50:00,334 --> 01:50:02,109
when they realized that
it's a bowel curry,

2271
01:50:02,167 --> 01:50:04,443
just some of them;
found it disgusting!

2272
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,512
Which dog found it disgusting?

2273
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:08,766
Come!

2274
01:50:08,767 --> 01:50:09,745
Master!

2275
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,280
Even the Captain of my ship
hasn't found it disgusting!

2276
01:50:12,334 --> 01:50:13,312
Leave it!

2277
01:50:13,367 --> 01:50:14,607
Leave it, I say!

2278
01:50:16,634 --> 01:50:18,113
Stop it, you pigs!

2279
01:50:18,201 --> 01:50:19,179
Stop <i>m</i>

2280
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:23,799
A Ponugese man called Vasco
Da Gama landed here in a ship,

2281
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,644
with a lot of paraphernalia.
Do you know that, you pigs?

2282
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,541
Do you know when that was?

2283
01:50:28,734 --> 01:50:31,112
Master!
- Move away! Pig!

2284
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:33,044
Oops! This is my master's son!

2285
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:34,545
You can sit on my back if you want!

2286
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,103
Someone go <i>&</i> pull him
out of the stage!

2287
01:50:39,034 --> 01:50:40,274
Where did I stop?

2288
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:43,676
So the Ponugese-men who
came here after Gama,

2289
01:50:44,134 --> 01:50:48,549
they are the ones who happily gifted
this Bowel Vindaloo recipe to us.

2290
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,478
If there are fancier
foreigners than Gama,

2291
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:53,207
don't eat my bowel
curry, you dogs!

2292
01:50:54,134 --> 01:50:56,580
Awesome!
- Thank you!

2293
01:50:56,634 --> 01:50:58,545
Hey bloody dogs!

2294
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:00,512
Those who don't want it,
get lost from here!

2295
01:51:00,567 --> 01:51:03,047
Culture-less people!
- That's true!

2296
01:51:04,201 --> 01:51:06,477
All you big people, think about it.

2297
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:09,205
To be served on your plates,

2298
01:51:09,267 --> 01:51:11,747
I took out my own bowel

2299
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,276
and cooked it with the
salt of my tears!

2300
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,336
When you said it's disgusting,

2301
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:20,000
my heart is burning in pain!
Do you know that?

2302
01:51:20,001 --> 01:51:20,979
Master!

2303
01:51:21,034 --> 01:51:22,172
Give me the mic, master!

2304
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:23,645
You &your bloody mic!
Get lost!

2305
01:51:24,767 --> 01:51:27,266
Ladies <i>&</i> gentlemen and Bangalore friends;

2306
01:51:27,267 --> 01:51:29,770
Very sorry! I am the full
responsibility of the food!

2307
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,299
DJ, start!
Come on!

2308
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:34,100
Poor guy! He said that
because he was really sad!

2309
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:35,171
So sad!

2310
01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:36,799
Don't bother about it.
I'll talk to him.

2311
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,076
You don't have to arrange any other food.
They will eat that itself.

2312
01:51:39,134 --> 01:51:41,566
And only some people had a problem.
They can have veg food!

2313
01:51:41,567 --> 01:51:42,545
Problem solved!

2314
01:51:42,601 --> 01:51:44,103
You don't have to eat it, you dogs!

2315
01:51:44,167 --> 01:51:45,202
Mind your words!

2316
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:48,779
Move, daddy!

2317
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:50,066
What is it?

2318
01:51:50,067 --> 01:51:51,045
What?
What?

2319
01:51:51,601 --> 01:51:54,081
Vinayan, don't create a
big issue out of it.

2320
01:51:54,134 --> 01:51:55,545
Listen to me, Vinayan!
Please!

2321
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,169
Not Vinayan!
I am Vineeth!

2322
01:51:57,234 --> 01:51:58,733
Whatever that is!
Listen to him!

2323
01:51:58,734 --> 01:52:01,374
Is he your pet dog
to listen to you?

2324
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,343
Who are you, you Pig?

2325
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:04,539
Have you been invited here?

2326
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,375
Hey! Did he come along with you?

2327
01:52:06,434 --> 01:52:07,572
He didn't come with us!

2328
01:52:07,634 --> 01:52:08,772
Then who are you, you pig?

2329
01:52:09,001 --> 01:52:10,446
I came here to pick up the waste!

2330
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:11,740
Hit him!

2331
01:52:13,434 --> 01:52:14,538
What's happening?

2332
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,202
Stop him before he
kills that devil!

2333
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:19,669
Oh God! What's he doing?

2334
01:52:19,734 --> 01:52:22,078
Hey! Don't go there in this condition!

2335
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,304
It's a fight!
Where's Thampichayan?

2336
01:52:25,467 --> 01:52:26,445
He is inside!

2337
01:52:27,001 --> 01:52:28,674
Who else has a problem?

2338
01:52:29,234 --> 01:52:31,145
Antochaya, come here!
- Ancy, move away!

2339
01:52:31,201 --> 01:52:32,509
My stomach is paining!

2340
01:52:32,567 --> 01:52:35,033
What?
- My stomach is paining.

2341
01:52:35,034 --> 01:52:36,069
Come here.

2342
01:52:39,401 --> 01:52:41,403
Michael, what's the problem?

2343
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,637
Such a fight is usual in
Kochi during weddings.

2344
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:45,735
Don't bother about it.

2345
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,502
Chet-ta, please come inside.

2346
01:52:47,568 --> 01:52:49,775
Thampichayan wants to talk..
- I'll just come.

2347
01:52:52,467 --> 01:52:54,504
Thampichayan wants to talk
about something serious.

2348
01:52:56,767 --> 01:52:57,745
Colli!

2349
01:52:58,067 --> 01:52:59,045
What is it?

2350
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:00,443
I'll tell you.
- What is it, bro?

2351
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:02,378
Why is there blood on your face?

2352
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,204
It's nof mine! Must
be that swine's.

2353
01:53:04,467 --> 01:53:05,605
Change this dress.

2354
01:53:06,034 --> 01:53:07,445
And ya, handle it properly.

2355
01:53:07,501 --> 01:53:09,300
No problem! You carry on!
I'll handle it!

2356
01:53:09,301 --> 01:53:10,279
Come!

2357
01:53:15,334 --> 01:53:16,312
Hey Many!

2358
01:53:16,367 --> 01:53:17,505
Lock the gates!

2359
01:53:29,368 --> 01:53:30,346
What is it?

2360
01:53:32,434 --> 01:53:33,412
Michael,

2361
01:53:33,567 --> 01:53:35,740
what I'm going to say, is
not going to be pleasant.

2362
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:40,372
And I know that it's not
right to say it now.

2363
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:44,266
Don't make me tensed.
Tell me what it is.

2364
01:53:44,267 --> 01:53:45,245
What's the problem?

2365
01:53:46,267 --> 01:53:47,507
Ruby, what is it?

2366
01:53:48,101 --> 01:53:49,341
Chetta, your..
- Vineeth!

2367
01:53:55,634 --> 01:53:59,138
You know him only through
a dance programme.

2368
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:03,644
You know me.

2369
01:54:04,301 --> 01:54:05,279
So,

2370
01:54:05,367 --> 01:54:08,041
you agreed for this without
enquiring about him.

2371
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:11,113
When they grow up,

2372
01:54:11,334 --> 01:54:12,677
boys will go against their fathers;

2373
01:54:12,734 --> 01:54:13,769
rebel against them;

2374
01:54:14,034 --> 01:54:16,674
those are all a kind of
psychological revolt.

2375
01:54:18,367 --> 01:54:19,345
But he..

2376
01:54:20,334 --> 01:54:22,007
He agreed to this marriage,

2377
01:54:22,467 --> 01:54:23,707
Not because he liked it.

2378
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:31,509
He just wants to find
happiness in defeating me.

2379
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:35,042
After the wedding, that
happiness will be over.

2380
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,678
For that,

2381
01:54:40,434 --> 01:54:42,209
Angel shouldn't become a victim!

2382
01:54:42,534 --> 01:54:44,172
You don't need this relation!

2383
01:54:47,367 --> 01:54:48,345
Stop <i>m</i>

2384
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:50,499
Are you kidding me?

2385
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,480
Stopping the marriage
on the day before?

2386
01:54:54,268 --> 01:54:55,246
Michael,

2387
01:54:57,034 --> 01:55:00,038
Thampi Chettan is the one who wished
the most for this wedding to happen.

2388
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,973
But how can we do this to
Angel knowing all this?

2389
01:55:13,634 --> 01:55:14,612
My dear Ruby,

2390
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,508
you should understand something.

2391
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:21,014
If your son marries my sister,
nothing is going to happen to her!

2392
01:55:24,401 --> 01:55:26,972
Did he say that he is not
interested in this marriage?

2393
01:55:27,467 --> 01:55:30,448
{EEK
E

2394
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,738
He won't say that!

2395
01:55:38,734 --> 01:55:39,712
Buddy,

2396
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:42,199
It's not like you think it is.

2397
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:45,113
They weren't meeting for the first
time during their betrothal.

2398
01:55:52,267 --> 01:55:54,110
They have been in
love for a long time.

2399
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,346
It's because you haven't
understood him.

2400
01:56:27,067 --> 01:56:28,307
He is your fortune!

2401
01:56:29,134 --> 01:56:30,112
You know what?

2402
01:56:30,634 --> 01:56:33,774
We raised our dear Angel like a
daughter, not like a sister.

2403
01:56:34,434 --> 01:56:35,433
And then,

2404
01:56:35,434 --> 01:56:38,108
when your son called her during her
wedding eve, she went with him!

2405
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:39,976
Burning all our hearts!

2406
01:56:41,467 --> 01:56:42,466
Finally,

2407
01:56:42,467 --> 01:56:44,572
when they feared that we will
separate them if we catch them,

2408
01:56:44,634 --> 01:56:46,511
they jumped into the sea!
To die together!

2409
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:49,008
So don't worry about
him liking her!

2410
01:56:52,301 --> 01:56:54,372
After running away from his
house on his own will,

2411
01:56:54,467 --> 01:56:56,378
if he comes back with
a girl to your house,

2412
01:56:56,434 --> 01:56:58,107
he felt that you would
be disappointed!

2413
01:56:58,301 --> 01:57:00,178
And when I saw such
great love for you from him,

2414
01:57:00,234 --> 01:57:01,679
this idea came up in my stupid mind!

2415
01:57:01,801 --> 01:57:04,247
A crooked idea we thought of then!

2416
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:06,301
That wasn't necessary.

2417
01:57:06,801 --> 01:57:08,303
I should've told the truth to you.

2418
01:57:08,601 --> 01:57:09,579
Forget it!

2419
01:57:09,667 --> 01:57:10,737
It just happened!

2420
01:57:14,601 --> 01:57:15,773
What do you have to say?

2421
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,278
Say something!

2422
01:57:19,467 --> 01:57:20,411
Justify him!

2423
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:25,046
What I understood about
your son was right!

2424
01:57:26,001 --> 01:57:27,309
Not what you understood.

2425
01:57:34,234 --> 01:57:35,542
Thampi Chetta,
get up!

2426
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,578
Let's go!

2427
01:57:36,634 --> 01:57:37,612
Ruby, I..

2428
01:57:38,734 --> 01:57:40,611
Michael, let the wedding happen.

2429
01:57:42,267 --> 01:57:45,680
All these days, everyone, including him,
made Thampi Chettan a joker, rig ht?

2430
01:57:49,534 --> 01:57:51,309
And one more day, after
knowing all this?

2431
01:57:51,434 --> 01:57:53,505
I won't allow that!

2432
01:57:56,534 --> 01:57:58,514
Didn't you say that they
jumped into the sea?

2433
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:02,173
We will consider that he
was dead back then itself!

2434
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,078
Chetta!

2435
01:58:23,301 --> 01:58:24,466
Ancy is really sick.

2436
01:58:24,467 --> 01:58:25,707
I'll just go to the hospital.

2437
01:58:26,201 --> 01:58:27,612
Ruby?
- What happened to Ancy?

2438
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:30,475
Her due date is on Friday.

2439
01:58:31,367 --> 01:58:34,177
She started acting to
stop him from fighting!

2440
01:58:34,234 --> 01:58:35,770
He kept rubbing it
<i>&</i> made it worse!

2441
01:58:36,101 --> 01:58:38,308
Acting became true. I think
her water broke. Let me go!

2442
01:58:38,701 --> 01:58:40,180
M
a

2443
01:58:43,434 --> 01:58:44,640
Buddy, I'll just check on them.

2444
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:45,678
You wait here.

2445
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,978
Move!

2446
01:58:53,034 --> 01:58:55,310
Clear the way!
Come!

2447
01:58:56,001 --> 01:58:56,979
Hurry LIP!

2448
01:58:57,034 --> 01:58:58,033
Bring her in!

2449
01:58:58,034 --> 01:58:59,333
Bro, hold her!

2450
01:58:59,334 --> 01:59:00,608
Brother, come!

2451
01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:02,647
It's okay! I'll handle things here!
- Wait!

2452
01:59:03,334 --> 01:59:05,143
We want to ask you something.

2453
01:59:05,367 --> 01:59:06,345
What?

2454
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:07,607
Is it an emergency?

2455
01:59:07,701 --> 01:59:08,679
Can't you see?

2456
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:10,678
If so, we can talk later!

2457
01:59:10,734 --> 01:59:13,010
This is not something
we can keep for later!

2458
01:59:13,067 --> 01:59:14,478
Let the others go.
You stay here!

2459
01:59:14,534 --> 01:59:16,207
Isn't you sister's
wedding urgent too?

2460
01:59:16,334 --> 01:59:18,099
Who do you think you are?

2461
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,011
You made a fool out of everyone
&you're arguing with us?

2462
01:59:20,067 --> 01:59:21,444
Not anyone else.
You!

2463
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,241
If you continue talking like this,

2464
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:24,678
we'll stop arguing
and finish you off!

2465
01:59:24,734 --> 01:59:25,712
Keep quiet!

2466
01:59:25,767 --> 01:59:27,333
Hello! Don't try to scare us!

2467
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:28,404
We've seen enough of this!

2468
01:59:28,467 --> 01:59:29,700
None of us were
interested in this.

2469
01:59:29,701 --> 01:59:31,544
But Tham pi Chettan wanted this.
That's all!

2470
01:59:31,601 --> 01:59:33,342
If it goes on like this, this
wedding won't happen tomorrow!

2471
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,243
You might have fooled Thampichayan
with your emotional drama!

2472
01:59:35,301 --> 01:59:37,266
Ruby Chechi is with us.
She is our bloodline.

2473
01:59:37,267 --> 01:59:39,076
We won't support such nonsense!

2474
01:59:39,134 --> 01:59:41,239
You brought back the girl who
eloped &want to get her married?

2475
01:59:41,301 --> 01:59:43,110
Bloody swine!

2476
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,373
Hey!
Get in!

2477
01:59:46,634 --> 01:59:47,633
Yes!

2478
01:59:47,634 --> 01:59:49,443
We will do all sons of nonsense!

2479
01:59:49,501 --> 01:59:51,412
Will you call off the wedding?
Then do it!

2480
01:59:51,467 --> 01:59:53,666
And you wanna go from here after that?
Let's see that!

2481
01:59:53,667 --> 01:59:54,645
Stan the car!

2482
01:59:55,034 --> 01:59:56,012
Go!

2483
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:57,340
I won't spare you, you dog!

2484
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,743
Listen!

2485
01:59:58,801 --> 02:00:01,145
I won't do anything to him.
He is my friend!

2486
02:00:01,367 --> 02:00:02,778
Who are you to me?

2487
02:00:03,201 --> 02:00:04,703
How did you say your blood was?

2488
02:00:05,601 --> 02:00:07,046
What are you looking at?

2489
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,078
Go! Get out!

2490
02:00:08,134 --> 02:00:09,112
Chase them out!

2491
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,574
Go! Go out!

2492
02:00:12,767 --> 02:00:14,075
Get going!

2493
02:00:34,234 --> 02:00:35,474
Thampichaya, get in!

2494
02:00:36,534 --> 02:00:37,512
Get in!

2495
02:00:37,567 --> 02:00:38,566
Let's go!

2496
02:00:38,567 --> 02:00:40,308
Disgusting people!

2497
02:00:57,434 --> 02:00:58,412
You dog!

2498
02:01:00,467 --> 02:01:01,605
No!
Don't do it!

2499
02:01:01,667 --> 02:01:02,666
Hey you!

2500
02:01:02,667 --> 02:01:04,704
Your dad <i>&</i> mom have taken a decision!

2501
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,733
That they're not interested
in this marriage.

2502
02:01:06,734 --> 02:01:08,236
What's your decision?

2503
02:01:08,801 --> 02:01:09,779
<i>Remember'.!</i>

2504
02:01:10,067 --> 02:01:11,011
Tomorrow!

2505
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,636
Tomorrow you will be married!

2506
02:01:13,168 --> 02:01:14,340
You will marry her!

2507
02:01:14,401 --> 02:01:16,381
Or else, I'll sink you in the sea!

2508
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,574
I'm not afraid of dying.

2509
02:01:19,634 --> 02:01:20,612
Kill me!

2510
02:01:21,201 --> 02:01:22,612
But I can't fool them anymore!

2511
02:01:27,234 --> 02:01:28,212
Leave me!

2512
02:01:36,334 --> 02:01:37,972
Why are you doing this, Seban?

2513
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:40,408
Why did we come so far, then?

2514
02:01:45,001 --> 02:01:45,979
Seban! Dude!

2515
02:01:47,367 --> 02:01:48,345
Seban!

2516
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,400
Hey! Stop!

2517
02:01:49,401 --> 02:01:50,379
Seban!

2518
02:01:50,567 --> 02:01:52,233
Where are you running off to?
Seban!

2519
02:01:52,234 --> 02:01:53,533
Abu, stop!

2520
02:01:53,534 --> 02:01:54,604
Abu, what's the problem?

2521
02:01:54,667 --> 02:01:56,333
Where is he going?
What's happening?

2522
02:01:56,334 --> 02:01:57,608
Where the hell were you?

2523
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:00,408
I was talking to my
maths teacher Jose.

2524
02:02:00,467 --> 02:02:02,413
Get lost! You know what all happened?

2525
02:02:02,467 --> 02:02:04,003
She will do something drastic!

2526
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,443
Leave me!
- Listen to me!

2527
02:02:05,501 --> 02:02:06,980
I don't want to!

2528
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:08,445
Shit!

2529
02:02:08,501 --> 02:02:10,640
Dude, why is he crying?
What's the problem?

2530
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:13,447
His family said that they
don't want this wedding!

2531
02:02:13,534 --> 02:02:14,535
Huh?
Why SQ?

2532
02:02:14,601 --> 02:02:16,979
That loser, Vineeth.
His cousin! That dog!

2533
02:02:17,034 --> 02:02:19,207
He said everything to his family!

2534
02:02:20,501 --> 02:02:22,777
Angel must be really worried, right?
- She is worried.

2535
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:24,139
Moreover, we are in trouble.

2536
02:02:24,201 --> 02:02:26,203
If the wedding doesn't
happen, they will kill us!

2537
02:02:26,367 --> 02:02:27,633
What bullshit?

2538
02:02:27,634 --> 02:02:29,204
That's what I'm telling!

2539
02:02:29,401 --> 02:02:31,176
That's what you're telling?

2540
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:32,710
Didn't I warn you?

2541
02:02:32,767 --> 02:02:34,974
Didn't I tell you that
it wouldn't work out?

2542
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,102
Has he gone crazy?

2543
02:02:37,167 --> 02:02:38,669
That was not my id ea!

2544
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:40,100
It was their idea!

2545
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:41,546
Dude, we just joined for the planning.

2546
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:42,977
The idea was theirs.

2547
02:02:43,067 --> 02:02:44,307
Enough of your planning!

2548
02:02:44,367 --> 02:02:46,369
When I looked after you
like a younger brother,

2549
02:02:46,434 --> 02:02:47,674
this is what you did to me?

2550
02:02:47,734 --> 02:02:49,666
I did it because you're
like my own brother!

2551
02:02:49,667 --> 02:02:51,669
Not because I wanted
your approval!

2552
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:54,578
You bloody..

2553
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,166
You made everyone else
take all the risks,

2554
02:02:58,167 --> 02:02:59,305
and now don't talk nonsense!

2555
02:02:59,434 --> 02:03:01,311
You can't take any risk
or do anything yourself!

2556
02:03:01,367 --> 02:03:03,210
We have to shove it down
your throat, is it?

2557
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,243
What did you shove down my throat?

2558
02:03:06,167 --> 02:03:08,340
First you didn't like this idea.
That is true!

2559
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,176
But when you realized that it will
work, then it was a good idea!

2560
02:03:11,434 --> 02:03:14,066
And when it was going wrong, it became bad!

2561
02:03:14,067 --> 02:03:15,512
And you put the blame on our heads!

2562
02:03:15,567 --> 02:03:18,133
Why are you saying all
this to him, dude?

2563
02:03:18,134 --> 02:03:19,306
He is making me tell!

2564
02:03:19,401 --> 02:03:21,210
We have sacrificed so much for him!

2565
02:03:21,767 --> 02:03:24,008
You should be grateful, you scound rel!
- Get lost!

2566
02:03:24,101 --> 02:03:25,239
Sol am alone now?

2567
02:03:25,367 --> 02:03:26,710
I was always alone!

2568
02:03:27,134 --> 02:03:29,307
You're forming a team opposite me now?

2569
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:33,137
Then you do everything alone!

2570
02:03:33,401 --> 02:03:34,641
Come, Ambrose!
Let's go home!

2571
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:36,203
Even we have families!

2572
02:03:36,634 --> 02:03:37,612
Come!

2573
02:03:37,734 --> 02:03:38,733
Seban!

2574
02:03:38,734 --> 02:03:39,712
Dude!

2575
02:03:40,034 --> 02:03:42,514
We suffered so much to
leave you alone or what?

2576
02:03:42,567 --> 02:03:43,545
Huh?

2577
02:03:43,768 --> 02:03:47,375
Don't think unnecessary stuff
when you're drunk, dude!

2578
02:03:47,567 --> 02:03:49,240
Please!
Please!

2579
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,777
What should I do then?

2580
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,736
How do I face my family?

2581
02:03:53,034 --> 02:03:55,466
Even we have daddies <i>&</i>
mummies and families!

2582
02:03:55,467 --> 02:03:56,445
Understood?

2583
02:03:56,501 --> 02:03:58,606
Seban, tomorrow is your wedding!
Think about it!

2584
02:03:58,767 --> 02:04:00,075
Dude, you are our friend!

2585
02:04:00,134 --> 02:04:01,670
Angel is also our friend, dude!

2586
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,612
If we betray someone
among ourselves,

2587
02:04:05,034 --> 02:04:07,708
none of us are going to be happy!

2588
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:11,271
Whey are you trying to escape
when there are problems?

2589
02:04:11,401 --> 02:04:13,299
What should I do then, dude?

2590
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,246
Why isn't anyone understanding me?

2591
02:04:15,301 --> 02:04:17,144
Face them like a man with
your head held high!

2592
02:04:17,234 --> 02:04:19,466
Be bold <i>&</i> attend your own wedding tomorrow!

2593
02:04:19,467 --> 02:04:20,445
Come here.

2594
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:21,979
You did so much for your family!

2595
02:04:22,034 --> 02:04:23,536
Even then if they
can't understand you,

2596
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:24,600
ask them to go!

2597
02:04:24,601 --> 02:04:26,342
What should we do?
Should we die for you?

2598
02:04:26,401 --> 02:04:27,539
You are completely okay.

2599
02:04:27,601 --> 02:04:29,740
Have a drink. Everything
will be alright!

2600
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,775
I have stopped drinking!

2601
02:04:32,067 --> 02:04:33,569
What did your teacher
you all this while?

2602
02:04:33,634 --> 02:04:36,766
Don't blame the pen for
your bad handwriting!

2603
02:04:36,767 --> 02:04:38,405
Come here.
Everything will be alright!

2604
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,535
Come, dude!

2605
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,170
Seban!
Dear!

2606
02:04:43,567 --> 02:04:44,545
Don't cry!

2607
02:05:00,501 --> 02:05:01,479
One more.

2608
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:26,041
Did it upset you
when I did that?

2609
02:05:26,767 --> 02:05:27,745
No!

2610
02:05:28,034 --> 02:05:29,069
It's nothing, Ruby.

2611
02:05:29,267 --> 02:05:30,644
What you did was right!

2612
02:05:31,767 --> 02:05:33,007
When your husband,

2613
02:05:34,367 --> 02:05:36,404
is insulted in front of others,

2614
02:05:36,667 --> 02:05:39,113
any wife would react like this.

2615
02:05:39,467 --> 02:05:40,707
That's how you should react.

2616
02:05:41,501 --> 02:05:42,980
His failure as a son,

2617
02:05:43,467 --> 02:05:45,208
is my failure as a mother.

2618
02:05:45,434 --> 02:05:47,243
And he couldn't ask
for a better mother.

2619
02:05:48,801 --> 02:05:50,303
Even you were insulted there.

2620
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,076
M
m

2621
02:05:55,401 --> 02:05:57,108
Good that you kept quiet.

2622
02:05:57,734 --> 02:06:01,341
I have a lot of obligations
to Michael, Ruby.

2623
02:06:02,534 --> 02:06:05,378
Many huge debts, which I
haven't told you about.

2624
02:06:07,167 --> 02:06:10,444
Even though, we went our
own ways during college;

2625
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:12,371
my college fees,

2626
02:06:12,668 --> 02:06:13,646
hostel fees,

2627
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,574
and even the money with which
I bought every single tea for you;

2628
02:06:19,034 --> 02:06:21,344
He used to send it to
me from somewhere.

2629
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,173
Today, while coming out of that
house, after breaking all the ties;

2630
02:06:27,567 --> 02:06:29,478
I saw him, completely shattered!

2631
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:32,779
I couldn't do anything!

2632
02:06:47,668 --> 02:06:48,646
Com e.

2633
02:07:01,367 --> 02:07:02,573
Mama!
- Wait!

2634
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,478
Ruby!

2635
02:07:04,734 --> 02:07:06,111
Thampi Chetta, please.

2636
02:07:09,067 --> 02:07:10,171
What's your plan?

2637
02:07:11,067 --> 02:07:14,981
Haven't you had enough even after you made
such fools out of us in front of everyone?

2638
02:07:15,034 --> 02:07:17,241
Mama, please.
- Why did you come back?

2639
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:20,603
I want to talk.
-You don't have to say anything!

2640
02:07:21,667 --> 02:07:23,510
Answer just one question of mine!

2641
02:07:24,368 --> 02:07:25,346
Ask me!

2642
02:07:26,701 --> 02:07:28,305
Were you in love with her?

2643
02:07:28,734 --> 02:07:30,042
Ruby, leave it!

2644
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,706
Thampi Chetta, please.

2645
02:07:33,167 --> 02:07:34,145
Answer me!

2646
02:07:35,001 --> 02:07:37,379
Were you in love with her for a long time?

2647
02:07:38,267 --> 02:07:39,575
No!
_ No?

2648
02:07:40,534 --> 02:07:42,309
Aren't you ashamed to lie to my face?

2649
02:07:42,734 --> 02:07:44,111
I'm not lying!

2650
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:46,170
Listen to me at least now!

2651
02:07:46,434 --> 02:07:47,572
Please believe me!

2652
02:07:48,067 --> 02:07:50,411
Don't talk to me with
a prejudiced mind!

2653
02:07:50,467 --> 02:07:51,445
Please!

2654
02:07:51,634 --> 02:07:54,240
I was not in love with her!

2655
02:07:54,501 --> 02:07:55,479
I swear!

2656
02:07:56,167 --> 02:07:58,272
Then why did she back off from her wedding,

2657
02:07:58,334 --> 02:07:59,540
and elope with you?

2658
02:07:59,734 --> 02:08:01,111
Or, was that also a lie?

2659
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,178
No!

2660
02:08:04,334 --> 02:08:05,312
That was true.

2661
02:08:06,401 --> 02:08:07,607
I used to love her.

2662
02:08:08,334 --> 02:08:10,211
But I never told that to her.

2663
02:08:11,201 --> 02:08:12,612
Until her wedding eve!

2664
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,636
Even though I knew
that she loved me too!

2665
02:08:16,401 --> 02:08:17,379
You know why?

2666
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,478
<i>Do you know?</i>

2667
02:08:21,167 --> 02:08:22,771
I didn't want to hurt you both!

2668
02:08:24,134 --> 02:08:25,112
But.

2669
02:08:25,334 --> 02:08:28,281
When I got uncontrollably drunk
like this on her wedding eve,

2670
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:30,404
I told it to her.

2671
02:08:32,234 --> 02:08:33,304
If I didn't say it then,

2672
02:08:33,767 --> 02:08:34,745
In.

2673
02:08:37,067 --> 02:08:38,273
I said it unknowingly!

2674
02:08:38,568 --> 02:08:39,546
I swear!

2675
02:08:40,667 --> 02:08:42,305
Hearing that, she came along with me.

2676
02:08:42,801 --> 02:08:43,779
And,

2677
02:08:44,234 --> 02:08:46,441
the next day I tried to
make her understand.

2678
02:08:47,234 --> 02:08:48,212
You know why?

2679
02:08:48,801 --> 02:08:50,439
Because I didn't want to hurt you.

2680
02:08:51,467 --> 02:08:52,639
But it didn't work!

2681
02:08:53,301 --> 02:08:55,679
Because I couldn't face you,
I tried to commit suicide!

2682
02:08:56,234 --> 02:08:57,212
You know that?

2683
02:08:58,434 --> 02:08:59,970
Then when everyone
said that,

2684
02:09:00,801 --> 02:09:02,644
without hurting anyone;

2685
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,306
without betraying her;

2686
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:07,239
it can happen like
this, I also agreed.

2687
02:09:08,634 --> 02:09:09,612
To fool you!

2688
02:09:11,234 --> 02:09:12,212
Papa!

2689
02:09:13,401 --> 02:09:14,539
I swear!

2690
02:09:15,201 --> 02:09:17,010
I don't want to lose her!

2691
02:09:18,567 --> 02:09:20,444
I don't want to hurt you both as well!

2692
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,578
Don't cry!

2693
02:09:21,634 --> 02:09:22,669
Please Papa!

2694
02:09:24,334 --> 02:09:25,312
Get up!

2695
02:09:26,234 --> 02:09:27,212
I know!

2696
02:09:27,267 --> 02:09:28,245
Let it be!

2697
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:31,333
Sorry!
- Get up, son!

2698
02:09:31,334 --> 02:09:32,312
Come!

2699
02:10:02,134 --> 02:10:04,011
Why do you do it when
you can't handle it?

2700
02:10:04,334 --> 02:10:06,041
When I was tensed, I
drank a bit too much!

2701
02:10:07,367 --> 02:10:08,641
I had just two drinks!

2702
02:10:09,534 --> 02:10:10,512
I swear!

2703
02:10:13,467 --> 02:10:14,445
Ru by!

2704
02:10:16,234 --> 02:10:17,577
By starting with small lies,

2705
02:10:19,034 --> 02:10:20,069
he grew LIP;

2706
02:10:20,634 --> 02:10:22,614
and his lies also grew,
and reached this stage.

2707
02:10:24,367 --> 02:10:26,313
I don't think he
can lie anymore!

2708
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,206
It's quota is over.

2709
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:31,374
Why aren't you saying anything?

2710
02:10:33,667 --> 02:10:34,645
Ruby!

2711
02:10:35,468 --> 02:10:36,446
Sorry again!

2712
02:10:39,134 --> 02:10:41,341
You didn't ask me why
I said sorry again.

2713
02:10:41,701 --> 02:10:42,771
Why should I ask?

2714
02:10:43,501 --> 02:10:44,639
For lying to me, right?

2715
02:10:45,467 --> 02:10:47,572
Mikhael sent money
to study, it seems!

2716
02:10:48,301 --> 02:10:49,541
You understood it was a lie?

2717
02:10:51,167 --> 02:10:52,475
I didn't understand then.

2718
02:10:53,034 --> 02:10:55,446
Then when I thought about
it again, I understood.

2719
02:10:56,667 --> 02:10:58,977
Please Thampi Chetta.
Don't lie to me.

2720
02:10:59,567 --> 02:11:01,410
At least consider that
I'm also an advocate!

2721
02:11:03,634 --> 02:11:05,045
Sometimes, for some cases,

2722
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,379
the clients may go
out of control!

2723
02:11:08,601 --> 02:11:09,978
Only if you cool them down,

2724
02:11:10,267 --> 02:11:12,713
their minds can accept
practical solutions.

2725
02:11:13,167 --> 02:11:14,612
I don't know all that!

2726
02:11:15,467 --> 02:11:18,243
That's why I'm a leading advocate
<i>&</i> you're the home's advocate!

2727
02:11:19,134 --> 02:11:20,112
Ya rig m!

2728
02:11:20,634 --> 02:11:23,444
The father cut off all my
ties with my only brother.

2729
02:11:23,667 --> 02:11:26,238
Now the son has cut ties with
the rest of the relatives.

2730
02:11:28,367 --> 02:11:29,505
Nothing will be lost, Ruby!

2731
02:11:34,234 --> 02:11:35,542
Sister, what happened?

2732
02:11:36,034 --> 02:11:37,240
Give me cigarettes.

2733
02:11:38,434 --> 02:11:39,435
Don't be tensed!

2734
02:11:39,501 --> 02:11:41,310
Uncle, let's go outside.

2735
02:11:47,134 --> 02:11:49,637
Chetta, the doctor
wants to meet.

2736
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,411
Why does the doctor want to meet him?

2737
02:11:59,667 --> 02:12:01,613
I don't know!
Oh God!

2738
02:12:04,601 --> 02:12:05,705
Don't worry!

2739
02:12:06,201 --> 02:12:08,772
Even if it's a cesarean, there
are 50% chances of survival!

2740
02:12:09,201 --> 02:12:10,509
The other 50%."

2741
02:12:10,667 --> 02:12:12,044
Get lost!

2742
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,473
Its
a pm]?

2743
02:12:16,067 --> 02:12:17,546
What is it? ls there some problem?

2744
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,479
Chetta, what is it?
- Where is Antappan?

2745
02:12:19,567 --> 02:12:20,700
They are outside.

2746
02:12:20,701 --> 02:12:21,679
Come!

2747
02:12:21,734 --> 02:12:23,611
Is there some problem?
- I don't know!

2748
02:12:24,367 --> 02:12:26,711
Marty, , did you see Antappan?
- He's crying near the car.

2749
02:12:26,767 --> 02:12:28,075
Crying?
- What happened?

2750
02:12:28,134 --> 02:12:29,333
I don't know!
Come!

2751
02:12:29,334 --> 02:12:30,369
Tell me what it is!

2752
02:12:30,434 --> 02:12:31,433
Antappan!

2753
02:12:31,434 --> 02:12:32,499
Seeing him come,

2754
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:33,478
Chetta!

2755
02:12:33,534 --> 02:12:34,512
Ancy!

2756
02:12:35,368 --> 02:12:36,574
Why are you crying, you fool?

2757
02:12:36,634 --> 02:12:37,612
<i>Chem, Ancy'.!</i>

2758
02:12:37,667 --> 02:12:40,045
Ancy is alright!
Where is that card? - What?

2759
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:43,409
Did you give the card for
Seban's wedding to the Vicar?

2760
02:12:43,468 --> 02:12:44,674
Did you give it or not?

2761
02:12:44,734 --> 02:12:46,179
No! I didn't!
- One tight slap!

2762
02:12:46,234 --> 02:12:47,212
What is it?

2763
02:12:47,267 --> 02:12:48,337
Thampi had called!

2764
02:12:48,401 --> 02:12:49,471
All problems are solved!

2765
02:12:49,567 --> 02:12:51,478
Get that card to
the Vicar a.s.a.p.

2766
02:12:51,601 --> 02:12:52,602
Marty!

2767
02:12:52,667 --> 02:12:55,375
Get some awesome bowel curry for lunch.
- Done!

2768
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:57,471
Thampi <i>&</i> Ruby couldn't have it today.

2769
02:12:58,201 --> 02:12:59,433
What did the doctor say?

2770
02:12:59,434 --> 02:13:01,072
Ancy is alright!
She is normal

2771
02:13:01,167 --> 02:13:02,578
One tight slap!

2772
02:13:02,734 --> 02:13:03,712
Awesome!

2773
02:13:03,767 --> 02:13:04,800
Oh God! Ancy!

2774
02:13:04,801 --> 02:13:06,747
There's time! Don't panic!
- Antony Punyalan!

2775
02:13:08,767 --> 02:13:09,768
Antony Punyalan!

2776
02:13:19,734 --> 02:13:20,735
Oh Lord,

2777
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,440
shower your mercy on the departed,

2778
02:13:23,501 --> 02:13:26,466
kindly nurture the living;

2779
02:13:26,467 --> 02:13:30,677
revive those who have departed
with the hope of resurrection.

2780
02:13:30,734 --> 02:13:33,237
Let us pray for this brother &sister

2781
02:13:33,334 --> 02:13:36,372
who departed for the heavenly
abode of God almighty.

2782
02:13:36,534 --> 02:13:37,512
Amen!

2783
02:13:38,067 --> 02:13:40,047
Shall we go to the Church then?

2784
02:13:40,101 --> 02:13:42,166
That's a good idea, Father.
I'm really hungry.

2785
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:44,333
Chettan has been carrying my
baby-son around all the time!

2786
02:13:44,334 --> 02:13:46,280
We'll have much more
fun for my wedding!
