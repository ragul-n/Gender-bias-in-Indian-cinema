Pran

3
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,291
Pran's father, Prithivi Prasad...

4
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:54,291
...Pran's responsibility was
handed over to me when he died.

5
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,875
He helped me a lot.

6
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:04,708
And I promised my
friend on his deathbed.

7
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,208
- That Pran and Aruna.
- Is that so, sir?

8
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,958
Hello my dear.

9
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:31,458
He handles my car
company very well.

10
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,416
Mr.

11
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,125
- Did you address me so politely?
- Did I make a mistake?

12
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,458
- No.
- All men are equal.

13
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,291
- Do you know this?
- It's a coin.

14
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,291
- Do you want it?
- Take pleasure.

15
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,291
Turn off the radio.

16
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,000
Turn off the radio and go to sleep.

17
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,875
didn't you hear me

18
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,500
- This is not the time to listen to the radio.
- is it!

19
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,416
- Turn off the radio.
- Can't.

20
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,208
If you don't do thatâ€¦

21
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,208
- Let's see.
- Okay, I will.

22
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,166
- Pran, what did you do?
- Shut up!

23
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,958
Those who disobey me
will face a similar fate.

24
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,541
Pran, why is this?

25
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,541
You are quick to anger.

26
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,250
Ask Uncle before he blames me.

27
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,916
I am an eyewitness to everything.

28
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,916
- But...
- Go to your room.

29
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,666
Baby, stop crying.

30
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,125
I'm tired of these constant fights.

31
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,958
One should consider a
man's heart, not his speech.

32
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,583
Pran is a good boy, although he
is a bit stubborn and has manners.

33
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,208
I am that stubborn.

34
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,375
You two will make a beautiful couple.

35
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:31,583
There are few couples with similar traits.

36
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,500
Will you marry us?

37
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,458
This was decided 15 years ago.

38
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:48,166
I would rather die than marry him.

39
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:55,458
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Not reconsidering your decision?

40
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,583
Girl, you will regret meâ€¦

41
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,500
...If this happiness is lost.

42
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,208
I had made a promise to
Pran's father on his deathbed.

43
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:22,625
My breaking that promise
is a disgrace to my family.

44
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,625
I cannot dishonor my commitment.

45
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,750
Now relax.  Whatever happens
will happen for your good.

46
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,166
I had made a promise to
Pran's father on his deathbed.

47
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:32,666
I cannot dishonor my commitment.

48
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,666
Aruna, what if you
really married Pran?

49
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,875
What if you actually marry Pran?

50
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,208
What if you actually marry Pran?

51
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,750
Your life will be ruined.

52
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,750
Your freedom will end.

53
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,333
Aruna, remember, it's a wrong move

54
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,416
You will have to pay a heavy price for that.

55
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,125
Think it through.

56
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,125
A moment of freedom is
better than a lifetime of slavery.

57
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,125
This is the time to make a decision.

58
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,916
But where can she go?

59
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,666
Were you all asleep?

60
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:17,916
No one knows a young
girl until she leaves home.

61
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,583
Pran, what's going on now?
I wonder where she is.

62
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,375
Don't worry Uncle,
I will find him today.

63
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:33,583
Where can you find her?
I don't think she even ate.

64
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,000
She is immature.

65
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
She was upset about something.

66
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,375
She herself will return.

67
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,625
- She can't be without you.
- Don't comfort me.

68
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,625
Pran, go find him.

69
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,958
Sir, need two more annas.

70
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,666
- Not enough?
- It's not enough for me.

71
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,583
It is true that commodity prices are rising.

72
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:54,583
But you can work.

73
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:03,083
- Can I find a job?
- for sure.

74
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,416
- Give me how many, sir.
- Okay.

75
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,666
Is that all?

76
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,666
Shut up and go!

77
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:33,208
Please sir, give me some.

78
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:35,608
Will you push my
car to the petrol shed?

79
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:42,875
Don't make fun of me sir.

80
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,083
I pay you.

81
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,250
I don't want to steal other people's money.

82
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,125
- Give me some.
- Shut up and go!

83
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,583
You asked me for a job,
so why not do this job?

84
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,916
This is not a permanent job.

85
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,250
So begging is a good profession.

86
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,250
- Give me my money back.
- You beg from a beggar.

87
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,750
- Give or I'll make you...
- Here's your money.

88
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,750
You will always remember me.

89
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,750
Come on, I'll push your car.

90
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,500
Beat three liters.

91
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,916
Take this.  Is that enough?

92
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,776
- Not so.
- Then?

93
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:58,291
- I need a job.
- It's hard.

94
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,583
I am a graduate
looking for a job.

95
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,583
I can't afford you
a job.  Keep this.

96
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,791
I can provide this kind of support.

97
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:50,500
Now...?

98
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,333
- Give me an Ovaltine.
- She means milk.

99
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,833
I haven't even seen them in years.

100
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,750
You are very lucky!

101
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,500
When luck comes, money flows.

102
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,250
But why did she come here?

103
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,559
I am also unable to eat or drink.

104
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,750
Now I have to take care of her too.

105
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,750
God help me.

106
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:09,875
Mrs. Ovaltine, here's your tea.

107
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,833
- Who are you?
- Don't worry, drink the tea.

108
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,125
But who asked you for tea?

109
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:22,958
I am a good host.

110
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,208
- Do you own this place?
- Yes.

111
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,833
My name is Ashok.

112
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:36,625
- and you?
- My name is Aruna.

113
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,625
It's a very beautiful name.
Drink this tea here.

114
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
do you brush your teeth

115
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,166
- Don't you have that habit?
- Does that mean?

116
00:25:53,666 --> 00:26:01,666
Didn't you bring toothpaste?
OK, I'll give you mine.

117
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,416
Brush your teeth and drink
your tea before it cools down.

118
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,250
This is too much.  Give it to you too?

119
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,916
thank you!  You are very smart.

120
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:51,916
You didn't give me a chance to ask.

121
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,515
- What did you put in it?
- Nothing.

122
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:10,208
This is a herbal tea that gives warmth
in winter and coolness in summer.

123
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:15,250
It does not smell.  why is that

124
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,958
It's not that bad.

125
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,098
OK, your choice.

126
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:30,958
Now tell me about yourself.

127
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:36,250
- Tell me about it, please.
- My name is Aruna.

128
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,916
It doesn't matter.  Tell
me how did you get here?

129
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:45,750
- I came from home.
- But why did you do that?

130
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,333
- Does that mean?
- Why did you come like that?

131
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:56,291
- You ran away from home, didn't you?
- I'm back...

132
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:59,750
Your relevant answer was not given.

133
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,625
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes.

134
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:14,125
Oh my God!  Look at you.

135
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:18,458
How do you adapt to this situation?

136
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,458
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- I don't want to go home.

137
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:31,250
Did you decide to stay here?

138
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,208
with me

139
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:38,750
don't you say

140
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,750
I will take you home
or to the police.

141
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,125
Stop crying.

142
00:28:54,625 --> 00:29:00,166
I will not take you to the
police.  Please believe me.

143
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:05,791
I can't watch a
beautiful girl cry.

144
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,791
Don't do this to me.

145
00:29:55,333 --> 00:30:01,916
- Did you find her?
- I tried my best.  But it failed.

146
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:09,875
- Is that what you came back to?
- What else can I do?

147
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,458
I think we should inform the police.

148
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,500
Do that.

149
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,958
Pran, this is going to societyâ€¦

150
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:24,166
...not good for my daughter's name.

151
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,291
It destroys the honor of the family.

152
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,291
Check in the whole city
and somehow find her.

153
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,916
Good!

154
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,541
It is true that a woman
can build a house.

155
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:16,125
This house is like new now.

156
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,083
Stop teasing me.

157
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:27,583
This is a bus.

158
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,333
We need to hide this
bus from the world.

159
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,333
Because if people hear
that they live in buses.

160
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,500
Not everyone is as smart as you.

161
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,333
That is why I live so happily
even though I am poor.

162
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,500
Here, eat.

163
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,625
- have you eaten?
- Not yet.

164
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,625
So let's share.

165
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:12,250
- Do you live alone?
- No, with you.

166
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,416
I mean where is your family?

167
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:24,125
I am alone.

168
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,208
My mother died 10
days after I was born.

169
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,291
And my father after 10 months.

170
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,041
I assumed at this rate that
I too would die in 10 years.

171
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:37,541
But it didn't happen.
I grew up in an orphanage.

172
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:43,958
I have graduated and
now looking for a job.

173
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,708
- This is my story.
- Your life is full of stress.

174
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:51,083
But I live with them.

175
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:58,958
But now I have someone
to sympathize with.

176
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,375
I've had enough of that.

177
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:10,875
- Tell me about yourself.
- Be patient.

178
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,875
I beg you not to pressure me.

179
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:22,250
It is unfair.  You asked
me everything about myself.

180
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,916
When I ask you, you say no.

181
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:33,625
Ashok, trust me, I won't
hide anything from you.

182
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:41,458
But talking about it
now makes it worse.

183
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:45,458
- eat
- First you eat.

184
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,500
- No, you eat.
- No, you eat first.

185
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,541
Why should I take
the lead every time?

186
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,541
- First you eat.
- Okay.

187
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:34,458
- Sorry!
- I can't forgive you.

188
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,000
- Did you find her?
- Did she tell me where she was going?

189
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,166
why are you shouting

190
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:05,250
You are responsible for
him leaving this house.

191
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:13,750
Your anger has caused
me many problems.

192
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:21,708
My child who never went out alone.

193
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,708
The roads have to go.

194
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,500
I didn't think things
would go this far.

195
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,250
Now you have to solve this problem yourself.

196
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,250
Uncle, I promise you.

197
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,250
That I will not return to
this house until I find her.

198
00:35:56,208 --> 00:36:00,291
- what are u doing?
- Why am I telling you?

199
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,458
I saw what you were doing.

200
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:07,458
- What did you see?
- Your game.

201
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:12,750
- What game?
- Tell you?

202
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,916
You wrote my name and then erased it.

203
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:23,416
I came here feeling lonely.

204
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,875
Aruna when you are at home...

205
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:33,375
...was in a luxurious life.

206
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:41,875
But instead you are here with
an unemployed young man.

207
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,083
I am enjoying it.

208
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:50,500
I am really lucky

209
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,791
About finding a friend like you.

210
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:02,291
Do you think so?
Don't want to go home?

211
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:11,083
No.  I don't want to go to that
house with all the comforts.

212
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:16,875
No luck there.

213
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:25,375
Even if you get a good bed, it seems like you don't sleep.

214
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:34,916
It's a really uncomfortable place.

215
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:41,750
This natural environment and youâ€¦

216
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:49,000
...nothing but paradise.

217
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:57,500
You didn't before, but now you do.

218
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,083
- Do you know who created all this?
- An angel of love.

219
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,000
He later saw a goddess.

220
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:12,125
I once saw a boat in a dream.

221
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,583
A mermaid comes to the beach...

222
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:18,833
...shouted to me in a sweet voice.

223
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,833
I woke up from the dream when I went near her.

224
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,625
She won my heart.

225
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,625
Who taught you to steal?

226
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:26,541
- Give me a packet of peanuts.
- Where have you been all these days?

227
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,541
- I'm busy.
- Happy for you.

228
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:46,625
you are here  come with me

229
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,625
Pran, let me go.

230
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:40,833
Let's take him to the hospital.

231
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:24,958
My baby is back.

232
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:31,291
Daughter, why did you leave me?

233
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:36,000
Didn't you feel sorry for me?

234
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:42,333
You come back, that's enough.

235
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:48,916
If you hadn't come,
I would have died.

236
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:56,208
- No, father.
- Where did you go, daughter?

237
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,500
Why did you leave me alone?

238
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That happened to my father.

239
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:13,875
You don't know the pain I've
been going through these days.

240
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:18,708
I didn't see any of this...

241
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:26,875
...because you walked away from me.

242
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:32,583
She may not even be able to eat.
Prepare to eat.

243
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:36,375
Daughter, eat something and then rest.

244
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:44,166
Go, daughter!

245
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:52,666
Pran, don't act like that again.

246
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,916
- Has he not regained consciousness?
- He opened his eyes only once.

247
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,416
When I asked his name,
he gave me a confused look.

248
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:10,000
- Then he lost consciousness.
- Take good care of him.

249
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,208
what is your opinion

250
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:17,166
I think his brain is affected.

251
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,875
He loses consciousness.

252
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,458
And when he regains
consciousness, he forgets his past.

253
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,458
Can't he get his memory back?

254
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,208
Sometimes it can be
done with major surgery.

255
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,833
But in his condition, the
operation can be fatal.

256
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:33,833
We have to wait for
his injuries to heal.

257
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:03,583
- Can't you see the eyes?
- I'm very sorry!

258
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,750
- Ask,
- Did you call me?

259
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,458
- Yes.
- what?

260
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:19,791
Since you look educated,
will you answer my question?

261
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:24,625
- Yes.
- How much is 10 and 10 added?

262
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:27,708
- 20 years.
- I knew you didn't know.

263
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,208
It is 30.

264
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,208
No, 20.

265
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:39,541
- It's 30.
- No, 20.

266
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:43,750
We have to argue.

267
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:49,625
- 20 years.
- Where are you going?

268
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:52,208
- I have work.
- Let's make a decision.

269
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:59,000
- I said 20.
- Okay, I admit defeat.

270
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:07,500
- Then give me 20 rupees.
- What is that for?

271
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,666
Don't you pay?

272
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:18,041
He owes 30 rupees but he
only wants to pay back 20 rupees.

273
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:24,500
- what are you saying?
- You owe 30 rupees.

274
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,250
I owe you nothing.

275
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,541
You admit that it is 20 rupees,
pay him and solve the problem.

276
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:36,541
I don't owe him anything.
He is a fraud.

277
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:41,541
what did you say?

278
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:44,541
Stop fighting.  How
much money do you have?

279
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,166
- why?
- tell me.

280
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:51,791
- I have 20 rupees.
- Then pay him that amount.

281
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:55,791
- But I don't owe him.
- I'll tell you.

282
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:04,208
I'll pay, don't hit.

283
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:18,416
- here it is.
- The fight is over.

284
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:26,875
I was warned about going to town.

285
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:33,000
But I didn't listen to that advice.

286
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,041
- Come here.
- What is it?

287
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:43,541
What is 10 and 10 added?

288
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,625
- Why am I telling you about it?
- I want to learn math.

289
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:50,541
Then go to school.  I have work.

290
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:57,583
I will teach you a lesson.
For cheating a poor man.

291
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:02,625
Give back the money
or I'll break your jaw.

292
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,833
let me go

293
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:12,500
Sir, come here.

294
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,791
- Give him the money back.
- Here.

295
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:21,416
- Now apologize to him.
- forget it.

296
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,750
I said sorry.

297
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,666
Now get out of here.

298
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,833
Can't look back.

299
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:36,791
Sir, you are an angel.

300
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:41,791
I am grateful to you.

301
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:45,791
what is your name?

302
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,750
Who am I... What is my name?

303
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:08,333
best wishes!

304
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:16,041
Friends, our show is starting now.

305
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:20,750
Stay tuned.

306
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,750
Please step back.

307
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:42,791
You guys are back.
Pull back your chimney.

308
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:49,500
Friends, clap your hands
for the Lord's blessing.

309
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,416
Awesome!

310
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:57,166
Very good!  Hold this drum a little.

311
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,166
Hold it like this.

312
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:11,458
Welcome!

313
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Friends, isn't it good?

314
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,458
This is a matchbox.

315
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:37,500
You may have seen it flash.

316
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,875
- Yes.
- Have you seen dead bodies being burned?

317
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:46,041
You must have seen many lovers too.

318
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:51,000
- Yes.
- But you have not seen a man jump into a burning fire.

319
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:58,458
- Never.
- Then take care of it today.

320
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:02,708
You should think about my problems.

321
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:09,125
For that I jump into the burning fire.

322
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:15,125
- I do it for a living.
- Remember that.

323
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:22,000
a fire.

324
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,000
Look carefully.

325
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:37,875
Champa, what's our next item?

326
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:41,375
- They have seen cars.
- Definitely.

327
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,875
- A cyclist.
- Yes.

328
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:48,041
- but never saw a tightrope walker.
- Yes.

329
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:52,041
- You have to walk on this rope.
- Okay.

330
00:59:55,833 --> 01:00:01,916
But if you fall, your legs will break.

331
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:05,916
Because he failed, friends,
now a woman is doing this feat.

332
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:24,166
Look out for her, friends.

333
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:52,666
She does all this for a living.

334
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:16,000
Friends, a stick game.

335
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,000
Show up without a stick.

336
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:40,500
Are you injured?

337
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,500
Dad, I'm fine.

338
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:51,708
- Who is he, father?
- He is the one who saved you.

339
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,708
God bless him!  Come on.

340
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:09,791
You can go now.

341
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:19,916
- Not there, here is our way.
- Let's go.

342
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:26,041
- Where are you going?
- I'm bored at home.

343
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,500
So I'm going out.

344
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,416
- You don't go out.
- Why is that?

345
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:41,916
Your father died not long
ago.  People will gossip.

346
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:47,666
- I don't care about them.
- We must follow the norms.

347
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:51,666
It's better if you don't go.

348
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,708
Oh God, if Roopa were mine...

349
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:21,708
...I pray often.

350
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,250
who is this

351
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,500
Take out your chimney.

352
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,791
You saved Rupa, didn't you?

353
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:44,166
- Rupa, come here.
- why?

354
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,583
- father!
- Why daughter?

355
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,583
Look who this is.

356
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:53,333
- Champa.
- What has happened to you?

357
01:03:55,833 --> 01:04:02,750
You can create false sympathy
for people and deceive them.

358
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:07,916
- Where do you live?
- This world is my home.

359
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:12,833
- where do you work?
- Not everyone needs to work.

360
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:20,916
- How do you live then?
- God will take care of it.

361
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:27,458
- Eat something.
- Thank you!

362
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:32,333
- He is a strange man.
- Yes, decent...

363
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:35,666
Did you quickly realize that he was decent?

364
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:39,916
- Why is it impossible to judge?
- Did you continue to judge him?

365
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,916
Stop teasing me.

366
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,000
I am a loser again.

367
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,000
But I keep trying.

368
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:53,583
I wish I was a boy
who could climb a tree.

369
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,125
here

370
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:10,291
- Where is your attention?
- To the mango and to you.

371
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:14,291
- Do I look like a mango?
- Yes.

372
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:22,458
- take
- You eat it.

373
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:26,833
I don't need it.  I
chose it for you.

374
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:32,125
- for me?
- Yes, I know you are hungry.

375
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:38,125
- Please eat it.
- Why are you so worried about me?

376
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:43,541
I thank you for saving my life.

377
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:47,666
Would it be okay if you give me this mango instead?

378
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:52,666
Don't look at the gift, but
look at the love behind it.

379
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:05,208
All my income was paid to the priest.

380
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:09,966
When giving this ring he said...

381
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:18,166
...that Rupa will be crazy about me.

382
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:27,000
Like a fool, I waited for her.

383
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,708
This...

384
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:36,583
You fooled me too.

385
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:41,041
When wearing it...

386
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:47,333
Rupa said she would love.

387
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,333
But that didn't happen.

388
01:10:58,416 --> 01:11:01,166
A stranger in this hardware...

389
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:06,416
When I apply them above my eyesâ€¦

390
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:14,500
...He said that Rupa is
following me like a shadow.

391
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,500
This one also failed to do the trick.

392
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:32,208
The Himalayan priest deceived me.

393
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:39,791
He said that he had climbed the
Himalayas to give me this magical herb.

394
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:45,250
Actually, he cheated on me.

395
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,500
The world is full of cheaters.

396
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,375
- Boss, may I come in?
- Shut up!

397
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,291
- who is?
- It's me, baby.

398
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:56,500
Where is my future wife?

399
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,500
Are you drunk?

400
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,900
I breathed a little.

401
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,900
Take the leg away.

402
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:14,791
Sit down, idiot.

403
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:20,250
Boss, I'm sorry.

404
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,250
- What are these?
- These are things bought for love.

405
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:28,000
Rupa!

406
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:35,000
Rupa!  where is she

407
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:37,000
what are you doing

408
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,725
hurry up!

409
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:46,875
Do you think this cigarette
will help me catch him?

410
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:52,500
All things fail.

411
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,041
So how does your cigarette work?

412
01:12:56,541 --> 01:13:02,250
You don't look good
enough to attract her.

413
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:06,250
I find a magical cureâ€¦

414
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:17,166
...to make her like him.

415
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:22,583
Imagine you married her.

416
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,583
When does it happen?

417
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:31,500
- Just a guess.
- Okay.  And then?

418
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,833
- Will Champa allow it?
- I will take care of her.

419
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:47,708
- She doesn't think about it.
- Why are you doing that to her?

420
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:52,125
- Do you smoke again?
- No.

421
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,916
So what is this?  I forbade
you to smoke, didn't I?

422
01:13:55,416 --> 01:14:00,375
If you smoke after this,
you will break your fingers.

423
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,250
Boss leave me alone, I'm
going to see a priest now.

424
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,750
- what did you say?
- Yes.

425
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,583
- Is there anyone?
- Yes.

426
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,375
- Why didn't you tell me?
- what?

427
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,375
- Bring him here.
- Okay.

428
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,500
Take this.

429
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,500
OK, keep this one too.

430
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,375
Stop craving, go now.

431
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,208
come here

432
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:47,291
Go through the back door.

433
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,691
This needs to end.

434
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,291
Go through the back door to avoid Champa.

435
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:05,208
Leave me alone boss.

436
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:09,208
- your...?
- Don't shout!

437
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:16,041
- Where are you going?
- I am...?

438
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:23,916
- That's not okay with me.
- Okay.

439
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:27,583
I know you are
going to meet a priest.

440
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:31,583
How did you know?
This is all the boss's work.

441
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:49,375
I will teach him a good lesson.

442
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:52,291
Save me from it.

443
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,375
- Come on.
- where is?

444
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:02,208
Remember, I cannot be
intimidated by these strike threats.

445
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,458
- Work on the old salary level.
- Why is that?

446
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:10,125
Because the factory is profitable,
we should also get a salary increase.

447
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:15,833
- Are you shareholders?
- No, we are the foundation of this company.

448
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:19,958
- We fight for it.
- You get paid for it.

449
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:25,333
But the price of goods has increased.

450
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:26,833
Then reduce your expenses.

451
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:32,208
Friends, he won't
listen, let's go to court.

452
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:36,708
- You are welcome.
- wait a little.

453
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:49,333
- What do you want?
- We want justice.

454
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:54,583
Our wages will not increase
unless the work increases.

455
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:58,583
Don't strike.  I assure you

456
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:08,708
- I guarantee you a raise.
- Madam, that is our only need.

457
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,708
We're going now.  Let's go.

458
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,958
Why did you join factory work?

459
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,958
I did it for the benefit of the factory.

460
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:26,250
If it is profitable,
meeting their needsâ€¦

461
01:17:26,258 --> 01:17:28,250
...Why not look out for their best interests?

462
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,458
- I don't do that.
- But I gave my word.

463
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:34,058
- Who asked you that?
- This is my duty.

464
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:39,033
Remember to honor my word.

465
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,708
Hail, priest!

466
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:07,583
Why are you shouting?

467
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:13,958
your...?  please sit down.

468
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:22,458
Bless me as I am
your humble servant.

469
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,041
- Don't be discouraged, children.
- Thank you, priest.

470
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,333
He told me everything.

471
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:35,458
- I advised him to tell.
- What is your wish?

472
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:36,958
I will say

473
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:43,958
There is a girl called
Roopa, I love her so much.

474
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:47,708
- Boss, try to understand this.
- You, be quiet.

475
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:53,958
That girl really
hates seeing him.

476
01:18:54,458 --> 01:19:02,333
It's true, but I love her.

477
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:09,708
So bless me and awaken
her feelings for me.

478
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,708
Don't worry, I
will pray for you.

479
01:19:13,408 --> 01:19:15,708
hurry up.

480
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:28,000
You broke another girl's heart, didn't you?

481
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,291
- Is this true?
- Yes, no...

482
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:35,500
Who broke the heart?  lie to him

483
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
- He asks you.
- Gurudev, did you ask me that?

484
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,958
I am omniscient, so don't
hide anything from me.

485
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:47,916
- Shall I say something?
- Yes.

486
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:51,916
Ask him again.
Maybe there was a mistake.

487
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:55,041
The Lord is never wrong.

488
01:19:55,541 --> 01:20:03,541
The Lord says you have
sacrificed love for another woman.

489
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,708
- Did you say that?
- Yes.

490
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:13,416
- Why do you hate that girl?
- Do you expect me to fall in love with that witch?

491
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:19,958
You also run away if you see her.

492
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:25,916
She is not a girl but a witch.

493
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:33,458
Your friend is bothering me.

494
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:38,708
- Baby, what do you think?
- Trying to understand you.

495
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:45,958
If you disturb the priest
again, I will beat you.

496
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,958
Refocus your attention.

497
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,541
- This is my brother?
- You will end up in trouble.

498
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:58,791
Don't touch her.

499
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:06,250
- Who is Champa?
- She is my maid.

500
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:14,000
May your wish come true.

501
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:22,291
- Isn't that what you want?
- I couldn't ask.

502
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,416
- Then close your eyes.
- Do I keep one eye open?

503
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:30,416
- No, close both your eyes.
- Okay.

504
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:53,708
Take these ashes.  It is strong.

505
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:59,166
Apply this ash on your
body and think of Rupa.

506
01:21:59,266 --> 01:22:01,583
Then she will appear before you.

507
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:09,458
To me, you are like a god.

508
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:13,166
Rub this ash every 5 minutes.

509
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:16,083
If you make a mistake,
it loses its power.

510
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,000
ok

511
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,500
- Your charge?
- Money cannot charm the godly.

512
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,500
- Good!
- God bless!

513
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:36,750
Boss get up now.

514
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:41,541
Where is the priest?  He has disappeared.

515
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:49,333
He is a true saint.  Do not
say anything against him.

516
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:53,333
Rub these ashes on my back.

517
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:04,958
- Drive slowly.
- I am sorry.

518
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:11,416
- Do you know who that saint is?
- He is an incarnation of God.

519
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:15,833
He gave such a powerful
medicine without taking a penny.

520
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:19,166
- Hurry up.
- But...

521
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:22,958
- why?
- Coughing.

522
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:29,166
- Then luck will get money.
- why?

523
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:34,416
I feel itchy too.

524
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:38,750
- Did you remove the ash?
- There are some.

525
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,500
- Is it over?
- Yes, turn now.

526
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,666
put...

527
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:51,458
Count more.

528
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:55,708
ok

529
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:59,708
I will show you how
to apply it.  Here it is.

530
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:13,416
Step back a bit.
I need to focus now.

531
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:17,416
Come, my dear Rupa,
sing sweet songs for me.

532
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:02,583
- Boss, what happened?
- It bothers me.

533
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:20,708
- Who is that priest?
- She is a young woman.

534
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:24,708
- Who is that?
- She is Champa.

535
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:33,125
I can only defeat
her if the itch stops.

536
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,791
- Bring a brick.
- what?

537
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:49,833
Can I get a job?

538
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:54,583
There is no vacancy.

539
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:59,708
I feel like I've met you before.

540
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:05,750
- Ramlal, give him a job.
- Okay, sir.

541
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,750
come with me

542
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:38,250
what is your name

543
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,250
your name.

544
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,583
Why are you afraid to say your name?

545
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:55,750
I want all information about you.

546
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,750
Tell the details.

547
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,541
Did you get his details?

548
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:12,458
He does not say his name.

549
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:19,541
Why not tell your details?
Anyway, come to work from tomorrow.

550
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:23,541
thank you!

551
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:28,166
I think he is reluctant to work
because he comes from a rich family.

552
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:49,750
It makes me happy to see your smile.

553
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:53,541
I also feel sad to see you sad.

554
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,291
I am also looking for happiness.

555
01:31:56,791 --> 01:32:00,416
But that happiness eludes me.

556
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:04,916
The more I try to remember
it, the more it eludes me.

557
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:08,500
That sadness keeps happiness away from me.

558
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:19,500
smile at me  I will
give you happiness.

559
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,500
You are like a ray of sunshine to me

560
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,500
A breath of hope.

561
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,583
- Sir, please help me.
- That's not my problem.

562
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:39,583
- Sir, who else can we ask for help?
- Get out of here.

563
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,250
Stop!  You cannot enter.

564
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:22,541
Why is this?

565
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:26,541
Only one person can enter.

566
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:04,875
- You?
- Yes.

567
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:08,500
- what do you want?
- What can you give?

568
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,083
We are the ones who sweat for you.

569
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:16,291
And when even that is not
enough, you suck our blood.

570
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:19,333
Hold on!

571
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:25,500
Who can control a storm?

572
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,041
Take him to the hospital now.

573
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:33,708
I will look into it.

574
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:37,708
What is his fault?

575
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:43,541
He did not ask for a
share of your property.

576
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:48,208
What is his fault?

577
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:54,291
He has asked for money
to save his wife's life.

578
01:34:54,391 --> 01:34:56,750
The company operates
according to certain standards.

579
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,916
Human beings also
follow certain norms.

580
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:03,500
Do not forget that we
strive for your convenience.

581
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Without us, you would not
enjoy all these pleasures.

582
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,416
- Money has blinded your humanity.
- Shut up!

583
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:19,166
The truth is hard to bear.

584
01:35:19,666 --> 01:35:23,333
I came here to
teach you humanity.

585
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:27,500
You are fired.

586
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,500
What else can I do?

587
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:47,333
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm hungry.

588
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,833
- Why don't you eat then?
- No, Rupa.

589
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:55,708
When man becomes a slave
to hunger, he forgets humanity.

590
01:35:56,208 --> 01:36:00,541
Then he begins to deceive
himself and the world.

591
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:04,500
- Where are you going?
- To find someone who appreciates my work.

592
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,791
- Did you resign?
- It's like that.

593
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,833
- Does that mean?
- I had a dispute with the owner.

594
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,000
He fired me.

595
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,208
Because he thought I was very smart.

596
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:21,625
If too smart, the
boss feels threatened.

597
01:36:21,725 --> 01:36:24,285
If you are not smart,
you will be unemployed.

598
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:28,541
- You should try to get this job.
- It's not necessary.

599
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:33,941
I'm going to find another job.

600
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:17,541
You seem very tired today.

601
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:21,750
I was tired of walking the streets.

602
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:29,833
I have no one to entrust myself to.

603
01:37:30,333 --> 01:37:35,208
Don't be so sad.
I feel sad when I see you sad.

604
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:39,291
My happiness lies in your happiness.

605
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:43,291
Your words give me a zest for life.

606
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:57,083
- They are together.
- Who...?

607
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:58,958
- Look at that.
- where is?

608
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,750
Look at the hand.
My grave is dug there.

609
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:08,583
I was there for her
but it didn't work out.

610
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:14,916
That guest is having fun at my expense.

611
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:19,791
It is his pleasure.

612
01:38:20,291 --> 01:38:27,958
- Rupa, are you leaving me?
- I have to ask you this.

613
01:38:28,458 --> 01:38:33,333
i'm yours

614
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:38,208
- What is it?
- What are they whispering?

615
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:41,000
They discuss your
grandmother's wedding plans.

616
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,940
What about my father?

617
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:46,416
- Same as mine.
- Okay.

618
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:51,916
- Boss, did you see?
- They laugh.

619
01:38:52,416 --> 01:38:57,833
- He has something in his hand.
- What is it?

620
01:38:58,333 --> 01:39:01,833
He has a sacred
medicine in his hand.

621
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:15,208
They are similar to the one
I have.  Now I understand.

622
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:21,375
Why does Rupa like him more than me?

623
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:25,583
- Because handsome?
- Shut up!

624
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:29,333
Today I have the wealth of love.

625
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:34,583
This is a treasure of dreams.

626
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:40,166
This treasure makes one
forget all their problems.

627
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:44,333
Losing my love, I see.

628
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:49,791
- That's good too.
- I can't bear to see it.

629
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:53,791
The enemy rejoices, I grieve.

630
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:57,250
The magic herb is responsible for all this.

631
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:05,750
If I had that herb, I'd
be there instead of him.

632
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:13,958
- I'm sorry too.
- I'll get that herb anyway.

633
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:19,166
- Do you think he will give them to you?
- Come with me.

634
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:23,166
- why?
- Champa is coming.

635
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:34,083
- Rupa, father called you.
- I will go.

636
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:55,250
- Welcome!
- How are you?

637
01:40:55,750 --> 01:41:03,750
How does it look?  It's like
you haven't even shaved.

638
01:41:07,625 --> 01:41:10,250
Get out of here!

639
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:15,791
Boss, let's do it.

640
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:19,250
- What is it?
- Nothing.

641
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:25,208
- what do you want?
- Nothing.

642
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:31,250
Do you like this lifestyle?

643
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:38,666
- Why don't you have a job?
- I am looking for a job.

644
01:42:01,125 --> 01:42:04,208
- What are you doing?
- I grind medicine.

645
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:10,833
- For whom?
- To dad.

646
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:17,000
- How is he now?
- Same as before.

647
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:22,875
- No cure?
- He is slowly recovering.

648
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,625
I'm sure of it.

649
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:33,125
- What do you think about marriage?
- marriage?

650
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:37,125
- I made my decision.
- Very good.

651
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,500
- It's okay.
- What is it?

652
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:55,416
- What do you have in your hand?
- Nothing.

653
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:58,500
Lalli told me everything.
Give me that herb.

654
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,333
- I don't have any herbs.
- Really?

655
01:46:04,833 --> 01:46:08,000
- Do you know this?
- What is it?

656
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,666
- Itchy powder.
- Then give me that herb.

657
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:15,666
- Here.
- Is this all for Rupa?

658
01:46:16,166 --> 01:46:20,000
Yes, no.

659
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:24,000
Baby, you gave her confidence.

660
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:05,416
I'm very sorry.

661
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:17,125
- Can you tell me where Mr. Ashok is?
- This is a place where a gypsy tribe lives.

662
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:21,625
He is a young man.

663
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:27,750
- it's me.
- No brother.

664
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:32,083
I'm talking about a tall handsome man.

665
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:36,416
So I...?

666
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:41,875
Now I know who you mean?

667
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:45,500
Do you know
where I can find him?

668
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,500
It's hard to track him down.

669
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,625
- why?
- where is he?

670
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:57,125
Why do you want to know?

671
01:47:57,416 --> 01:48:01,916
This girl is looking for him.

672
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:06,541
He comes and goes as he pleases.

673
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:11,583
But she holds him.

674
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:16,958
- But where is he now?
- Why do you want to meet him?

675
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:19,958
He is our employee.

676
01:48:20,458 --> 01:48:25,500
- Do you know his name?
- He doesn't even know what his name is.

677
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,791
- How is his character?
- He is a villain.

678
01:48:30,291 --> 01:48:36,375
Do not take his words seriously.
He is a very good person.

679
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:39,500
You will love everything about him.

680
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,708
You are crazy about him
because of that magical herb.

681
01:48:45,208 --> 01:48:50,833
- Madam, don't take her seriously.
- Shall I call Champa here?

682
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:54,666
Then I better go.

683
01:48:55,166 --> 01:49:00,666
Lady, she is a good girl,
and that man loves her.

684
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:05,250
I am your humble servant.

685
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:09,625
How do you know him?

686
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:15,625
We are two bodies but one spirit.

687
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:36,416
- Do you know me?
- Yes.

688
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:39,458
Are you the owner of the car company?

689
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:45,125
- Is that all?
- That's too much.

690
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:49,208
I need you.

691
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:55,291
Employers need employees
to run the company.

692
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:58,625
Don't hurt me so much.

693
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:02,625
Ashok what happened to you?

694
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:12,541
- So you baptized me?
- This is your name.

695
01:50:13,041 --> 01:50:14,833
Did you forget everything?

696
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:18,791
Ashok look at me.

697
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:22,416
I opened

698
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,958
I spent the best time
of my life with you.

699
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:29,958
And you loved me.

700
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:34,500
Did you forget that Aruna?

701
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,333
I don't know Aruna.

702
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:45,666
Did you forget everything?

703
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:49,708
You have even forgotten your identity.

704
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:54,625
Who am I and what is my name?

705
01:50:55,125 --> 01:50:58,625
How does it affect you?

706
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:16,666
Wait!  I have a question.

707
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:21,416
How long will you keep me in the dark?

708
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:24,416
Tell me if you're not mine.

709
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:31,833
Be honest, tell me everything.

710
01:51:32,333 --> 01:51:36,541
Don't play with my
feelings, accept your silence.

711
01:51:37,041 --> 01:51:43,416
That you remember your
past and still try to act innocent.

712
01:51:43,916 --> 01:51:46,416
Rupa leave me alone.

713
01:51:46,916 --> 01:51:52,458
I try to rest when
I find some shade.

714
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:56,625
But I can't find peace.

715
01:51:57,125 --> 01:52:00,750
I came to you to ease my mind.

716
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:06,416
But you made me sad.

717
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:10,416
I tried to remember my
past but it didn't work.

718
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:23,416
I will never let
you go anywhere.

719
01:52:23,916 --> 01:52:28,916
I promise never to
question you again.

720
01:52:29,416 --> 01:52:32,916
- You can stay here in peace.
- Where is the peace?

721
01:55:57,041 --> 01:55:58,801
Don't know where to stay?

722
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,166
I really don't know.

723
01:56:01,666 --> 01:56:05,166
- Think and answer me.
- What is there to think?

724
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:19,666
- Where did you go?
- I went somewhere.

725
01:56:20,166 --> 01:56:23,500
I know where you
are going these days.

726
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,833
But your dreams will never come true.

727
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:31,291
Who are you to crush my
dreams?  I do what I want.

728
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:35,291
Let's see how you do.

729
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:48,666
- Where are you going?
- To assist.

730
01:56:49,166 --> 01:56:53,791
- Shall we take him too?
- Definitely.

731
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:59,500
The day this man came,
Rupa fell from the rope.

732
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,833
So if you go with us,
there will only be problems.

733
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:07,833
- Right?
- Drop my ear.

734
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,125
- Why are you dancing here?
- To entertain people like you.

735
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:31,083
- But we don't need it.
- Who needs it?

736
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:33,663
The rich enjoy themselves at the expense of the poor.

737
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,750
God created this world for both.

738
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:40,500
But now it is disappearing.

739
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,250
- Do you own this road?
- Don't be harsh.

740
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:46,958
Then tell me about a place that is not respectful.

741
02:02:47,458 --> 02:02:53,625
You can't do this everywhere.

742
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:57,625
- is that so?
- Yes, it is.

743
02:03:00,958 --> 02:03:04,458
- Sir, let him go.
- Stop.

744
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:20,500
Save him.

745
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,250
That terrible one will kill him.
Have mercy on us and save him.

746
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:31,916
Why are you silent?  His life is in danger.

747
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:33,896
- Get out of here.
- Sir, excuse him.

748
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:36,666
- Don't torture the poor.
- Get out of here.

749
02:03:37,166 --> 02:03:40,041
Tie him up.

750
02:03:40,541 --> 02:03:44,041
Now I will teach you a lesson.

751
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,750
Why did you stop?

752
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:56,375
Did they do you wrong?

753
02:03:56,875 --> 02:04:01,166
They even risk their
lives for their livelihood.

754
02:04:01,666 --> 02:04:05,583
Instead of being kind to
them, you try to kill them.

755
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:11,333
- You don't believe in humanity?
- Aren't you ashamed to support them?

756
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:14,458
I am ashamed of your brutality.

757
02:04:14,558 --> 02:04:17,000
How do you torture
a human being?

758
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,500
Asuras are better than such people.

759
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:29,333
We are grateful to you.

760
02:04:29,833 --> 02:04:33,333
I am sorry for everything that happened.

761
02:04:37,625 --> 02:04:42,291
You are badly hurt.  come with me

762
02:04:42,791 --> 02:04:48,916
We're going.  Wounds
will heal in time.

763
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:52,208
Let's go.

764
02:04:52,708 --> 02:04:56,208
Your wounds will heal,
but who will heal my heart?

765
02:05:05,125 --> 02:05:12,833
- Do the work carefully.
- I'm good at pushing people away.

766
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:15,833
Get this here.

767
02:05:32,541 --> 02:05:36,041
Be careful.  Leave him here.

768
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,500
Now you can go.

769
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:55,916
- Is it serious, dad?
- The wound is deep.

770
02:05:56,416 --> 02:05:59,083
It is difficult to predict anything
until he regains consciousness.

771
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:03,083
Do not worry and trust God.

772
02:06:34,625 --> 02:06:38,125
I will come.

773
02:07:13,166 --> 02:07:17,875
- your...?
- Yes, it's me.

774
02:07:18,375 --> 02:07:24,208
Where am I?

775
02:07:24,708 --> 02:07:28,208
Come with me and I will tell you everything.

776
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:28,708
- What are you going to do?
- Leave me alone, father.

777
02:08:29,208 --> 02:08:31,875
He rejected my love, my devotion.

778
02:08:32,375 --> 02:08:39,166
He left me without saying anything.

779
02:08:39,666 --> 02:08:46,583
- Father, let me die.
- Why are you going to die?

780
02:08:47,083 --> 02:08:50,000
I am sure to make you happy.

781
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:54,000
come with me

782
02:13:44,125 --> 02:13:48,583
Why are you surprised?  This is my home.

783
02:13:49,083 --> 02:13:56,250
Are you that rich?

784
02:13:56,750 --> 02:14:00,250
Now that you have come, I am rich.

785
02:14:11,541 --> 02:14:19,041
Don't you feel ashamed to
meet a poor man like me like this?

786
02:14:19,541 --> 02:14:22,833
do not say that.

787
02:14:23,333 --> 02:14:30,125
Your smile makes it all disappear.

788
02:14:30,625 --> 02:14:34,125
eat something

789
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:39,000
- First you eat.
- No, you eat first.

790
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,166
I remember meeting you on the bus.

791
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:10,166
And we had some
wonderful moments together.

792
02:15:10,666 --> 02:15:13,333
One day we went to the market.

793
02:15:13,833 --> 02:15:16,625
Then something happened to me.

794
02:15:17,125 --> 02:15:22,291
I think I was in a car accident.

795
02:15:22,791 --> 02:15:25,375
I don't remember anything after that.

796
02:15:25,875 --> 02:15:29,708
Where have I been all this time?

797
02:15:30,208 --> 02:15:33,708
Wherever you were, you were in my heart.

798
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,666
Aruna, what happened?

799
02:17:10,166 --> 02:17:12,708
who are you  your...!

800
02:17:13,208 --> 02:17:19,583
Are you here to loot?

801
02:17:20,083 --> 02:17:22,250
Okay, set him free.

802
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:29,708
- I'll call the police.
- No, don't call the police.

803
02:17:30,208 --> 02:17:38,208
Why did you want to kill me?

804
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,500
Being poor does not
mean being a villain.

805
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:49,625
If you need money, here it is.

806
02:17:50,125 --> 02:17:55,500
No.  I don't need money.

807
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,500
God bless you!

808
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,500
- What happened, father?
- Let me wait.

809
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:41,333
She is Rupa, who has
taken care of you for so long.

810
02:19:41,833 --> 02:19:45,333
You had spent that time with these people.

811
02:19:51,125 --> 02:19:55,750
Rupa I can never repay you for
everything you have done for me.

812
02:19:56,250 --> 02:19:59,958
But accept this humble gift from me.

813
02:20:00,458 --> 02:20:07,375
Please don't refuse, sister.
This is a humble gift from both of us.

814
02:20:07,875 --> 02:20:10,791
Is this the price for a poor girl's heart?

815
02:20:11,291 --> 02:20:13,791
Don't try to bribe me.

816
02:20:14,291 --> 02:20:19,458
We are Ahiguntis and
travel for our livelihood.

817
02:20:19,958 --> 02:20:22,083
But we don't sell our feelings.

818
02:20:22,583 --> 02:20:27,250
Don't talk like that because
you don't know the truth.

819
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:29,666
You say now.

820
02:20:30,166 --> 02:20:34,041
After taking away my love, now
you have come to comfort me.

821
02:20:34,541 --> 02:20:42,416
- Love?
- Yes, you tried to buy it.

822
02:20:42,916 --> 02:20:46,833
Rupa, forgive me if I accidentally
dreamed of love with you.

823
02:20:47,333 --> 02:20:50,500
- It's not me.
- Then who is he?

824
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:57,291
I had lost my memory.

825
02:20:57,791 --> 02:21:03,750
I know that a rich man's memory
and his love are both a joke.

826
02:21:04,250 --> 02:21:06,666
I worshiped you like an angel.

827
02:21:07,166 --> 02:21:15,166
But I did not realize that one day
this rich woman will steal my love.

828
02:21:15,833 --> 02:21:23,750
You misunderstood me Rupa.

829
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:29,291
I loved Ashok before you.

830
02:21:29,791 --> 02:21:31,708
But after losing his memory...

831
02:21:32,208 --> 02:21:34,500
...He fell in love with you.

832
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,541
Is it wrong to love me when
his memory comes back?

833
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:41,625
Why do you blame my wealth?

834
02:21:42,125 --> 02:21:46,875
do not say that.  You
hurt me with your money.

835
02:21:47,375 --> 02:21:52,125
But don't think I'm taking it for granted.

836
02:21:52,625 --> 02:21:57,500
I am an Ahigunti, I can love
and take revenge for my love.

837
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,166
Father leave me alone.

838
02:22:00,666 --> 02:22:02,208
I'm going to kill this woman.

839
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:06,958
Would you kill your own sister?

840
02:22:07,458 --> 02:22:10,375
- Sister!
- Yes, Rupa.

841
02:22:10,875 --> 02:22:14,708
She is your own sister, Meena.

842
02:22:15,208 --> 02:22:19,125
- what are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth.

843
02:22:19,625 --> 02:22:22,666
This incident happened 15 years ago.

844
02:22:23,166 --> 02:22:28,333
You had a high fever that did not go down.

845
02:22:28,833 --> 02:22:32,083
I didn't have
money to treat you.

846
02:22:32,583 --> 02:22:37,291
To save your life...

847
02:22:37,791 --> 02:22:41,208
...I sold Meena for two hundred
rupees to a childless rich man.

848
02:22:41,708 --> 02:22:45,208
If I hadn't sold her, I
would have lost you too.

849
02:23:09,333 --> 02:23:11,875
- is it!
- Yes.

850
02:23:12,375 --> 02:23:14,708
i will take care

851
02:23:15,208 --> 02:23:18,708
- Shall I come with you?
- I have this.

852
02:23:26,625 --> 02:23:30,125
I really hurt you.

853
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,500
- Come with me.
- No.

854
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,500
- Are you coming?
- No!

855
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,333
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.

856
02:23:41,833 --> 02:23:45,333
Come forward, don't be afraid.

857
02:23:57,208 --> 02:24:00,708
let me go

858
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:45,708
What did you do sister?

859
02:26:46,208 --> 02:26:48,416
You are a devil in human form.

860
02:26:48,916 --> 02:26:52,833
are you happy now?

861
02:26:53,333 --> 02:26:58,458
Look what you did.

862
02:26:58,958 --> 02:27:03,541
Her sacrifice will be immortal.

863
02:27:04,041 --> 02:27:11,750
And I will give you
a life-giving death.

864
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,075
Don't bother him.

865
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:44,875
Only God has the
power to punish anyone.

866
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,875
