1
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:04,569
"In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides."

2
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,074
"In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides."

3
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,911
"No matter where I look, I find no one who can be my wife."

4
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:26,623
<i>"Being a good boy doesn't fetch you a bride."</i>

5
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:31,542
"Girls don't fall for NRI grooms anymore."

6
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:36,337
<i>"I'll bow before mother-in-law and also before father-in-law."</i>

7
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:39,129
"Please give us a bride."

8
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,423
"We'll forget our parents."

9
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,965
"In the wedding.."

10
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,927
<i>"In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides."</i>

11
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:18,568
<i>"We advertised on TV shows."</i>

12
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:23,404
<i>"We submitted our bio-data on matrimonial sites."</i>

13
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:28,448
"Before we become too old, we're eagerly seeking brides."

14
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:33,493
<i>"We're suffering the consequences of female infanticide now!"</i>

15
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:38,370
<i>"In our teens, parents forbade us from falling in love."</i>

16
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:43,415
<i>"Now at thirty, they scold us for not having found love."</i>

17
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:48,126
"Neither do they have to cook, nor do they have to sweep."

18
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:50,836
<i>"Give us a bride."</i>

19
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:53,087
<i>"We'll treat her like a princess."</i>

20
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:58,298
"In the wedding business, there aren't enough brides."

21
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,057
<i>Give me some flowers.</i>

22
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,642
Here.

23
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:30,899
She's a good match for my eldest son.

24
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,442
No, that one. How much for that one?

25
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,694
Well, dear.. - Give me two of that.

26
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,822
What is your name, dear? - Kanimozhi.

27
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,490
Give me the change. - Where are you from?

28
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,158
Vaduvur.

29
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:50,659
Okay, what are you people?

30
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:54,620
What are you people? - What do you mean by that?

31
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:57,371
She is enquiring about your caste.

32
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,249
How does that matter to you?

33
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,168
What makes you talk so rudely to your future mother-in-law?

34
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:08,961
What! You? My future mother-in-law?

35
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,506
If this is how you speak now, what will it be like after the wedding!

36
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,257
No way! I'm telling you now. I won't get my son married to you.

37
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:20,259
Who is your son? Did I tell you that I wish to marry him?

38
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:24,554
Go on. - Wait and watch, I'll get someone better than you for my son.

39
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,804
This is what this ma'am does.

40
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,430
Temple, pond, bus stand, college..

41
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:32,724
She keeps looking for a bride for her eldest son.

42
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:38,227
She's a perfect match for my eldest son.

43
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,189
Excuse me, dear.

44
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,149
What is it?

45
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,819
The eldest son for whom this lady seeks a bride is..

46
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,447
He is the eldest son. His name is Paramjothy, age, 40.

47
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:00,365
My eldest son is over 40. - Okay.

48
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,157
It is sort of disturbing. - Of course it is.

49
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:07,119
Reduce it to somewhere around 35 or 36.

50
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,745
As if that will help! - What? - Yes, I'll do that.

51
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,537
That is it. Note that down.

52
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,040
Always clashing with the eldest one is the second son.

53
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,790
His name is Parandhaman. Age, 38.

54
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,000
He doesn't talk to his elder brother.

55
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,043
His elder brother has no chance of getting married

56
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:24,461
because of which Parandhaman is still unmarried.

57
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,420
And this is the reason why Parandhaman is hostile towards his brother.

58
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,088
The best way to describe them both

59
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:30,464
is that they behave like half-brothers, fighting for legitimacy!

60
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,590
Don't ask who is legit and who is not!

61
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:35,466
Undeterred by the fact that both his elder brothers are still unmarried

62
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:38,301
there's a third son who is always carefree.

63
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:39,720
<i>The eldest one is 40.</i>

64
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,095
<i>The second one is 38.</i>

65
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:43,721
<i>So, you must be thinking, the third one must be around 36 or 37, right?</i>

66
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:47,640
But that's not what it is. Born after a long interval, the 24 year old

67
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,560
and the very energetic, Chinna Vandu is the hero of this movie.

68
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,978
He has come to this village to attend a festival.

69
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:56,936
<i>This is his uncle's village.</i>

70
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,771
<i>Though his native place is Kumbakonam</i>

71
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,105
<i>he did his schooling in this village.</i>

72
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,399
He's the hero's uncle's son.

73
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,942
He can tell us about our hero's whereabouts.

74
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,817
Hello! - Stop it!

75
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,194
We already have enough problems here.

76
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:11,861
Stop it. What is the problem?

77
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:15,114
Well, the problem is that the festival is next week. - Yeah.

78
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,573
For how long do we keep ogling at girls from our village?

79
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,074
Paneer's cousin in Paravakkottai.. - Okay.

80
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,534
...is for him and Vellaiamma in Kanammanattu..

81
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,329
I'm talking about her granddaughter.

82
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,247
Her granddaughter is for him.. - What! - Not for me!

83
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,831
Wait.. Have patience. That girl is for him

84
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,082
and the old widow's granddaughter is for me.

85
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,542
That was what we decided.

86
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,375
Now, he says

87
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,251
that the old widow's granddaughter is for him.

88
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,295
Vellaiamma's granddaughter was finalized for you.

89
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,045
That squint-eyed girl was finalized for you.

90
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,380
Leave me. - Stop fighting.

91
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,132
Why are you interfering? - Is this your problem. - Yes.

92
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,050
I'll find a solution to your problem.

93
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,718
What I'm trying to say is

94
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:58,428
whoever jumps over this well at one go

95
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,055
will get the old widow's granddaughter.

96
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,015
The one who loses, should give up. How is my judgment?

97
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,266
Super!

98
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:09,769
Is this the well? Both of us?

99
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:11,437
Yes. - What, yes!

100
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,355
He wants both of us to get drowned in this well

101
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,314
so that he can elope with our girl.

102
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,481
Is this your judgment?

103
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,608
No, it's a trap you're laying for us.

104
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,192
I am backing out of this competition this very moment!

105
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,318
You back out too. - Yes, that's best for the both of you.

106
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,610
But not for you.

107
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:29,112
If you stand here even for a minute

108
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,113
we'll throw you into this well. - Stop, stop. Wait.

109
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,990
Is that Chinna Vandu running towards us?

110
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,951
Undoubtedly, it's Chinna Vandu.

111
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,412
Why is he running like this?

112
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,788
He won't come running without a reason.

113
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:51,500
Do you think he knows about the competition?

114
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,961
He definitely knows. No doubt about that.

115
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:22,766
Did you see how he jumped over the well?

116
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:29,770
This is called valor!

117
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:32,648
This is how your grandpa

118
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,983
used to catch fleeing rabbits.

119
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,401
Your grandpa was very valorous.

120
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,192
You've taken after him.

121
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,819
Hey, old woman! How do you know so much about our grandpa's valor?

122
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:45,655
Did you have an affair with him during those days?

123
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,988
Get lost, you rascal!

124
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:48,490
See!

125
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,240
Hey!

126
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:57,785
Buddy, this bird is for you, while the chick is for me.

127
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:01,413
I get it, pal. I get the feathers while you get the meat.

128
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,303
I've arrived at the station. I hope my wish comes true.

129
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,763
According to my mind game

130
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:34,014
I'll start counting the electric posts that pass by.

131
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:38,724
If the train stops before the count runs into double digits

132
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,643
dad will forget old quarrels

133
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:43,269
and he will send me to grandma's village to attend the festival.

134
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:53,734
1..

135
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,692
Go.. Go..

136
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:01,904
2.. 3.. 4..

137
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,576
5..

138
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:17,037
Stop! Stop! Stop!

139
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:22,707
6.. Go.. 7..

140
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,500
Stop. Stop.

141
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:29,711
Go.. Go.. Go!

142
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:33,379
9!

143
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,173
Stop!

144
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,216
Stop.

145
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,967
My mind games have never failed.

146
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,886
The train stopped just before the count of electric posts ran into double digits.

147
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,345
I'm attending the festival at my grandma's village!

148
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:17,653
Brother, that girl is a perfect match for you.

149
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,990
But that girl is a doctor

150
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,158
and you have studied only until the 10th grade. Will it work out?

151
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:27,951
Hey!

152
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,598
Oh, no!

153
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:13,060
She is very angry. All of you break something too.

154
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,935
The whole family seems to be mad!

155
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:20,105
Let me break this elephant. Is this enough?

156
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,232
Fraud!

157
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,191
Do you want to break it? - No.

158
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:27,859
Then, I'll break it. - Weren't you the one who had sent people to the hospital?

159
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:32,778
Well..

160
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,237
Ma'am, what is wrong with your teeth?

161
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:39,449
Nothing is wrong with my teeth. I can crack walnuts!

162
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:43,492
I was told that I'll be paid if I say that I have a toothache.

163
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:44,951
That's why, I am here.

164
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,202
Dear..

165
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,371
It will upset you if nobody turns up at the hospital, right?

166
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,373
Which is why I did that. Is that wrong?

167
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,540
Okay, forget it. Forget it.

168
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,668
Why did you break that? You fool!

169
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,751
I'm a fool? - Get lost!

170
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,502
Did you hear that? - Careful, dear.

171
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:07,048
Dad, you do so much for me. What am I going to do for you?

172
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:08,881
You just have to do one thing.

173
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:11,424
Will you marry the boy of my choice?

174
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,846
Fraud! Is that all? I swear on mom..

175
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:21,389
I swear, I'll marry the boy of your choice.

176
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,014
My darling daughter!

177
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,932
Well, you wanted to attend the festival at grandma's village, right? You can go.

178
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,267
Hurray!

179
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:31,977
Thank you, dad.

180
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,687
But don't send your men to look after me. Okay?

181
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,941
But you should be back on the fourth day soon after the festival gets over, okay?

182
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,775
My sweetie pie!

183
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:52,280
What's up, buddy?

184
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:54,197
What's up, pal?

185
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:56,824
What's up, buddy?

186
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:58,241
What's up, pal?

187
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,244
What's up, buddy?

188
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,994
What's up, pal?

189
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,206
What's up, buddy?

190
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:10,999
What's up, pal?

191
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,250
What's up, buddy?

192
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,631
Oh! What's up, pal?

193
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:28,716
What's up, buddy?

194
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:37,971
Pal! That girl's coming only tomorrow! You may go.

195
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:39,305
What's up, buddy?

196
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,100
I have to meet that girl somehow.

197
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,225
Why the hurry, pal?

198
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,144
Have you forgotten that your eldest brother is still unmarried?

199
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:53,564
What makes you think that I'm going to marry that girl?

200
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,731
I just want to check her out before I flirt with her.

201
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,024
"No in-laws, no friends and family"

202
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,317
"there are no such relationships. - Hail the Lord!"

203
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:03,443
"As a last resort, I sought refuge in you."

204
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,903
"Is there ever a calm heart? - Hail the Lord!"

205
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:10,115
"The scriptures sing your praises, isn't that glorious? - Hail the Lord!"

206
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,325
"No father, no mother. I've none to protect me."

207
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,118
"Hail the Lord!"

208
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:17,494
Buddy.. - What?

209
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,120
Why are you praising the Lord now?

210
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,373
"Praise be to Tamil!"

211
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:25,623
"Hail! Hail!"

212
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:29,542
"O' Omnipresent one, appear before me. - Hail! Hail!"

213
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,877
"O' the one who rides a peacock. - Hail! Hail!"

214
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:36,211
"Help me overcome my weaknesses. - Hail! Hail!"

215
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:38,963
"Control yourself a bit."

216
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,216
"If you lose control, our plan will go in vain."

217
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,008
Why have you all covered your faces?

218
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:49,635
"Swine flu is all around. - Hail! Hail!"

219
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:53,179
"Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines!"

220
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,390
"Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines! - Hail! Hail!"

221
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,641
None of you should leave without eating.

222
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,728
Definitely, devotee. "She'll come, wait for a while."

223
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,937
"Welcome, O' Lord of the eight holy shrines!"

224
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,105
Why are we missing the beat? Come on, chorus.

225
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,653
Devotees.. Darn!

226
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,363
"Welcome, O' Lord.."

227
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,780
Aren't you Muniyandi's son?

228
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:28,782
Bloody drunkard! It's my cursed fate that I had to wash your feet!

229
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,575
Rascal! - Oh, God!

230
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:42,374
Had you warned me, I would've fled from there too.

231
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,792
Oh, my! - Buddy! - Yeah?

232
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,750
Slowly!

233
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,918
The idea of a religious procession flopped miserably.

234
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,754
Give me a better idea, good-for-nothings!

235
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm still not over the oldie's blow

236
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,424
and you're already asking for another idea!

237
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,175
Yeah. - Isn't that girl a doctor?

238
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:04,009
How about going to meet her under the pretext of an injury?

239
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,177
She's a doctor!

240
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,512
Not a doctor, she's a dentist.

241
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:10,388
Similar to a veterinarian, compounder, and nurse.

242
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:13,139
Oh, a dentist!

243
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,602
Yes, she is a dentist.

244
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:22,062
If I knock the teeth out of one of you

245
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,980
I can use that as an excuse to meet that girl.

246
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,130
Why are you running away scared?

247
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:12,965
It'll burst only after it reaches the sky.

248
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:21,428
As per my wish, if I touch this tree before that firecracker bursts

249
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:23,929
grandma would forget everything and come to our house.

250
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,846
I managed to touch it, grandma will come home!

251
00:19:54,863 --> 00:20:01,783
"She looked at me. She looked at me!"

252
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:09,119
"She floored me.. She floored me!"

253
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:13,206
"The wind that blew yesterday"

254
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,790
"took my heart away."

255
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:20,876
"She belongs only to me."

256
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:33,591
"She looked at me. She looked at me!"

257
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,610
"Shall I express myself with a kiss?"

258
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,112
"Shall I wipe away your shyness?"

259
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,073
"Shall I let you tug at the strings of my heart?"

260
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,866
"Shall I rejoice for tomorrow?"

261
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,742
"Sweet as nectar"

262
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,660
"you steal away my heart."

263
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:27,288
"Are you the epitome of beauty?"

264
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,957
"It rains in my dreamland."

265
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,751
"The umbrella of poetry spreads open."

266
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,503
"It rains in my dreamland."

267
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:42,797
"The umbrella of poetry spreads open."

268
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:47,590
"Like a milestone in my life"

269
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,424
"you're engraved in my heart."

270
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,926
"Let's soar amidst the clouds."

271
00:21:53,051 --> 00:22:00,097
"She looked at me. She looked at me!"

272
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:04,142
"The wind that blew yesterday"

273
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:07,518
"took my heart away."

274
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:11,561
"She belongs only to me."

275
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,993
"In this battle of love"

276
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:42,788
"I'm drawn towards her."

277
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:46,873
"I kick shyness away."

278
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,292
"You're the only one I dream about."

279
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,292
"When I saw you"

280
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,210
"I was left breathless."

281
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:57,878
"Are you the one who stole my dreams?"

282
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,673
"To write a poem for you, I shall tear up the moon."

283
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,342
"To you, I will give my life."

284
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,009
"To write a poem for you, I shall tear up the moon."

285
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:13,387
"To you, I will give my life."

286
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,014
"Let the lightning strike."

287
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,891
"Let the windows rattle."

288
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:23,643
"Let it rain!"

289
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:34,316
"She looked at me. She looked at me!"

290
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:41,569
"She floored me. She floored me!"

291
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:45,697
"The wind that blew yesterday"

292
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:49,115
"took my heart away."

293
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,158
"She belongs only to me."

294
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:26,468
Before meeting that girl, I jumped over the well.

295
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:30,096
Now, ask me to jump over the well. Go ahead and ask me.

296
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:32,514
Be it a river, a pond or a lake

297
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,515
I can jump over anything, pal.

298
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,683
She came running towards me, placed her hand on my heart

299
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:39,976
and spoke to me, buddy!

300
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,061
When there were so many people around, why did she have to talk to me alone?

301
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:47,272
There's definitely something, buddy.

302
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,607
But she was feeling sad

303
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,608
about some quarrel that happened between her grandma and her family.

304
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:53,983
I have to ask her about it.

305
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:57,486
Buddy, do we have to believe this?

306
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,903
Of course. - Okay.

307
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,947
There she comes, let me see you talk to her.

308
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,406
Hello!

309
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:07,282
Don't eavesdrop when lovers are talking. - Talk to her first.

310
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:08,992
How are you?

311
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,952
You'd spoken to me the other day, right? They don't believe me.

312
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:14,453
I spoke to you?

313
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,913
Who are you? - Nice shot!

314
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:23,250
Hello! The sky.. The tree.. - The people I end up talking to!

315
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,501
Grandma.. - Moon, earth, aunt.

316
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:27,919
We believed you, buddy.

317
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:30,837
Did you all believe? - Yeah. - See, they believed you too.

318
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:35,132
Wait and watch.

319
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,966
I'll make her fall in love with me before the festival ends.

320
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:39,259
How?

321
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,678
Buddy, girls always appreciate

322
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:45,429
valor.

323
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,931
What such valorous qualities do you possess?

324
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,807
See it for yourself at the festival tonight.

325
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,182
What does he mean?

326
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:36,081
Come, buddy. Just see the way I charm her.

327
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:40,001
Get down. Hanging from the pole like bats!

328
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,084
You know, we cling on to electric poles!

329
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:50,839
Greet them, pal. One to the left, one to the right.

330
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:53,966
When brothers from Kerala jump around

331
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:55,843
you all applaud so cheerfully.

332
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:01,471
My buddy, the honorable China Vandu has jumped over Mariamma's well.

333
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:06,307
A big round of applause for him!

334
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:07,557
Please!

335
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:13,935
Nobody's applauding. Shall we scoot?

336
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:16,895
Make them applaud or I'll kill you.

337
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,938
I'll smash your face, rascal!

338
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,399
Boys younger than you are performing better acts.

339
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:24,316
Aren't you ashamed of claiming recognition for jumping over a well?

340
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,608
Get lost!

341
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:29,986
Get out! - Out! Out!

342
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:33,071
I've heard that one is often undermined in his village

343
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:37,615
but it's sad to know that he has failed to make an impression here too.

344
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,283
Get out! You can start.

345
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:46,662
Get out! Get out! - Buddy..

346
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:49,455
Take note of that old woman, we'll deal with him later.

347
00:27:50,122 --> 00:27:54,583
Buddy, girls like boys who have a good sense of humor.

348
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,211
Where are you going? - We're going to jump from the top and die.

349
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,545
At least, use this as an excuse to talk to her!

350
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,962
Hey! - Get lost.

351
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,129
Hey!

352
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:12,468
Excuse me.

353
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:17,095
Can I talk to you? - Grandma!

354
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,221
No. Please don't call your grandma.

355
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:22,097
Basically, I'm a singer.

356
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:26,975
I used to sing well. I spoiled my voice by eating too much of ice cream.

357
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:30,644
The doctor advised a surgery that will make it fine.

358
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,896
Can you help me with some money for the surgery?

359
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,272
Do you want to hear me sing?

360
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:41,817
Ready, 1, 2.. 1, 2.. 1, 2, 3, 4..

361
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:47,945
"Quails.. Did you catch quails for lunch?"

362
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,654
"Did you bring quail meat?"

363
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:57,408
"Did you catch a myna?"

364
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:59,243
"Did you bring myna meat?"

365
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,369
Grandma! - No! No, grandma. Please!

366
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:05,954
Basically, I'm a dance master. I used to dance well.

367
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,664
In an accident, my legs were injured.

368
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,084
The doctors suggested that an operation can restore my legs back to normal.

369
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:18,546
You can check out my moves and decide whether to help me or not.

370
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:20,422
Ready?

371
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,134
Is he a circus clown?

372
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:34,721
Hey!

373
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:40,015
What is it?

374
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:42,142
Just like that, for fun.

375
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:45,269
You'll be dead meat!

376
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,314
She was mesmerized the moment she saw me.

377
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:55,316
So, didn't she talk to you at all? - Shut up.

378
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:01,653
Slowly, she regained her composure and told me

379
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,362
that some people sing well, but they can't dance.

380
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:08,364
Some dance well, but they can't sing.

381
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:12,074
Those who know both, aren't good looking.

382
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,492
She said, I was good looking as well.

383
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,494
Didn't I tell you that he'll impress her?

384
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:20,495
Lie! - Who is that?

385
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,665
Look at me and say it.

386
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,540
Look into my eyes and say it.

387
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,708
Did she say that you're good-looking or did the old man

388
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,376
appear in front of you with a knife? - What!

389
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:34,795
What a bluff!

390
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:39,006
Didn't I tell you, he wouldn't be able to impress her?

391
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,215
Have you achieved your purpose? - Yes.

392
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,758
Get going. - No.

393
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,469
Answer my question in one sentence and I'll leave.

394
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,803
Go ahead and ask.

395
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,846
When did you start this social welfare club?

396
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,431
Are you asking this question to the founder himself?

397
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,014
Seven years, get going now.

398
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:59,643
What welfare measures have you taken for this village in these seven years?

399
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:05,520
Won't you leave without an answer?

400
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,230
In that case, let's make a move. - Why?

401
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:09,189
We can talk about it only when some measures are taken, isn't it?

402
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:10,981
Thanks to the hinder some trees

403
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:14,192
the temple procession hasn't set foot in the village in five years.

404
00:31:14,358 --> 00:31:15,984
So much for the welfare club!

405
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:19,736
Your arrangements are good, but your actions are not.

406
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,405
More than us

407
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,115
it's the news about us that should reach a girl first.

408
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:27,699
I didn't get it.

409
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,117
Girls like boys

410
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,994
who are involved in social service. - There he goes again!

411
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,621
We've to make arrangements for the temple procession

412
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:37,288
to enter the village this year.

413
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,873
As if that will happen! - Hey!

414
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:44,459
When I decide to work for the welfare of the people, nobody can stop me.

415
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,043
Family, relatives, friends and foes..

416
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,461
I won't let anyone stop me.

417
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,672
Virtue, honesty and justice are of utmost importance to me.

418
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:55,423
Hold one end of the tape and I'll hold the other end.

419
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,508
five feet at this end and five feet at the other end

420
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,175
let's cut down all the trees that come in our way!

421
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,094
Every inch matters!

422
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:16,101
Just on my insistence, the youth of this village

423
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,228
are coming with crowbars and sickles!

424
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:24,646
What a sight! I can't believe my eyes!

425
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,817
Chinna Vandu, I'm so proud of you and your friends!

426
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:37,278
1, 2, 5!

427
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,572
Is that five feet? - Yes, pal!

428
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:43,533
The temple procession won't take this route.

429
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,741
When I decide to work for the welfare of the people

430
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,867
I don't care which route the temple procession takes.

431
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:50,535
Why is he dragging the tape till here?

432
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:55,913
What's wrong with him?

433
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:58,915
Looks like more than half of the shop is on public property.

434
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,291
What are we waiting for them? Public property is our property.

435
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,876
What are you looking at me for?

436
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,877
Get in and take all the bread, eggs and bananas.

437
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,503
Hey! - Stop!

438
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:08,545
It is wrong.

439
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,923
Chinna Vandu, thanks a lot.

440
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:13,340
It is okay.

441
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:17,634
Just take those things that's occupying the public area.

442
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:25,013
Hey! No! I lost my shop! My shop is ruined!

443
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:28,014
Gone, everything is gone!

444
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:34,851
Hereafter, will you ask us about the welfare measures

445
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:36,894
we have taken for this village?

446
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:41,105
Good boy!

447
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:45,982
You idiot! Why are you cutting down a blooming tree?

448
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,152
Mourn, old man! I'm cutting it down for your pyre.

449
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,361
You're killing my son!

450
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,155
The tree that I had nurtured so lovingly..

451
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,575
This tyrant is cutting it down! What do I do!

452
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:05,036
Don't cut down such a healthy tree. You sinner!

453
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,577
Get down!

454
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,746
"They hang in clusters.."

455
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,000
Superb, buddy!

456
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:23,546
I climbed up in excitement. If I climb any further, I'm done for.

457
00:34:24,003 --> 00:34:25,462
I'll cut it down from here.

458
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:30,132
Does this entire orchard belong to us, grandma?

459
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:33,259
Of course! Your grandpa planted all of this.

460
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:37,094
Buddy, this tree belongs to Vanaroja's grandma's house.

461
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:40,138
Dear, not just this side.

462
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,347
The one on the other side of the road also belongs to us.

463
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,432
So much for grandma's trees!

464
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:47,266
Hey, who is that?

465
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:49,726
The social service group is cutting down trees

466
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,226
to make way for the temple procession.

467
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:53,687
Who gives them the right to do so?

468
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,937
Give me that sickle! - Wait, grandma.

469
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,941
I'll deal with this.

470
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:02,025
Dear! - Ma'am!

471
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:10,405
Did you see my granddaughter's courage?

472
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:13,865
You cut down this tree. The rest of you cut that tree down.

473
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,698
This tree belongs to your girlfriend's grandma.

474
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,951
When I do social work, I don't care about my girlfriend or her grandma!

475
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,162
Why is he standing here? Maybe this is his group.

476
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:29,165
Hello! Stop!

477
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,958
I was excited to see the fireworks

478
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,542
and I forgot who I was speaking to. Sorry!

479
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,711
You look like the captain of this team.

480
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,045
Yes, I'm the leader.

481
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:44,507
All these trees were planted by my grandpa.

482
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,550
My grandma is very upset.

483
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:52,844
So, could you please not cut down these trees?

484
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,429
Were these trees planted by your grandpa?

485
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:57,931
Now, you wait and watch.

486
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,765
Hey, what are you doing? Stop the nonsense!

487
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,768
Leave out the trees that belong to her grandma and cut down the rest.

488
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,185
I'll come back later.

489
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:13,021
Hold one end of the tape and I'll hold the other end.

490
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:14,898
Five feet at this end and five feet at the other end

491
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,523
let's cut down all the trees that come in our way!

492
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:19,067
Every inch matters!

493
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:23,402
Buddy, wasn't it your idea of not sparing even an inch?

494
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:25,903
Why are you not wearing bangles on this hand?

495
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:28,739
It broke.. - You didn't hear what I just said.

496
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:30,657
It fell on deaf ears. - No, it's good.

497
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:32,490
I'm wearing them on this hand but not on the other hand.

498
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:37,911
Buddy, I cut down the blooming mango tree in my grandma's house.

499
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,537
You watched it silently.

500
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:42,996
Buddy, that's where you're wrong.

501
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:45,914
Actually, we can cut down trees planted by grandma.

502
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,583
But we must never cut down trees planted by grandpa.

503
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,335
What's with this new philosophy? - Have you had lunch?

504
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,003
Yes. I'll leave.

505
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,336
So soon?

506
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:57,463
You don't worry.

507
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:00,757
If they act smart, I'll close down the social service association.

508
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,423
Is that so?

509
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,967
You heard him. Cut down the trees planted by grandmas alone

510
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,135
and not the ones planted by grandpas.

511
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,179
How about going tomorrow? - No, must go today.

512
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:16,764
She's leaving even before the festival is over.

513
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:18,141
Chinna Vandu!

514
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,353
There's no sign of a clown!

515
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,063
Here he comes! - Hey, buddy!

516
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,730
Come here.

517
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:31,440
What is it? - It's something to do with you. Come here.

518
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:34,025
Shuffle it.

519
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:37,235
You just did that! What do I shuffle now?

520
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,193
Hey, have you asked Vanaroja for her phone number?

521
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:43,070
No. - She's at the bus stop, waiting to leave.

522
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,530
If she leaves, how will you stay in touch with her?

523
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,199
What are you saying? What do I do now?

524
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:50,409
Don't ask me! I'm not the one in love!

525
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:54,244
The bus will surely stop at Alathur for half an hour.

526
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,538
If we go fast on the bike, we could reach there before the bus starts from there.

527
00:37:57,704 --> 00:38:00,372
We'll give the driver some money and ask him to cancel the trip.

528
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,289
If it's cancelled, then there's no other bus until tomorrow morning.

529
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,083
Meanwhile, you exchange numbers and get to know each other better.

530
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,793
Super idea! - The bus will leave. Hop on!

531
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,546
Get down, get down, get down. The bus broke down.

532
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,837
We can resume the trip only tomorrow morning!

533
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:16,255
Get down. - Won't the bus go?

534
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,839
Do you need to be told separately? Get down.

535
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,634
Get down, get down. - Our boss will yell at us

536
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,844
he will think we've deliberately hampered the brakes.

537
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,510
We'll worry about that later, check the collections first.

538
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,387
Why are you so desperate for money?

539
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:31,639
Announce a break down and get the people off the bus.

540
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:33,931
The trip should resume only tomorrow morning. Got it?

541
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:36,641
Here, keep Rs.2000. Take it.

542
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,019
Why are you staring? You also keep Rs.2000.

543
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,978
You must be the first person to bribe the driver to announce a break down

544
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,187
for a bus that has already broken down.

545
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,480
Everything should go as planned.

546
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,273
Get out of the way. - Go on, sir.

547
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,401
You're making me wait for a bus that will arrive late.

548
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,734
What if we have missed it?

549
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:08,326
Ma'am, the bus has broken down.

550
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:09,869
Your granddaughter can't go back to her hometown today.

551
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,162
She's not going back.

552
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,579
She was taking me to the hospital as I had a bad toothache.

553
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:17,456
Isn't she a dentist?

554
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:21,500
Dentist? She is dental!

555
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,710
Oh, dental!

556
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:27,378
He kept saying that she is a dentist. Isn't it, dude?

557
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:29,505
Let's go, dear.

558
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:35,007
Sorry, buddy. You wasted your money because of me.

559
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,469
It's okay, let it be. Your intentions were noble.

560
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:44,137
Keep the emotions aside. The amount was a little huge.

561
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:48,222
It's okay, forget it. - Usually, he isn't so casual about money.

562
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,724
By the way, where did you get the money from?

563
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,268
Remember, the trees that we had auctioned the other day? - Yeah.

564
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,726
It was the money, we had received from that auction.

565
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,605
When I saw you spending so lavishly

566
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,356
I had a doubt it wasn't your money.

567
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,607
Of course. - So much for the club leader!

568
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:08,026
I don't know what to plan.

569
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,652
That day, she spoke to me sweetly, saying that I'm the leader and so on.

570
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:14,195
But today, she completely ignored me.

571
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:16,739
She could've at least, given me a smile.

572
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:20,615
With her grandma sitting next to her, how do you expect her to smile? That too, openly?

573
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,159
Open. Thanks!

574
00:40:27,536 --> 00:40:32,331
Girls always like boys who speak openly. I'll open up my heart.

575
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:35,666
That announces the opening of the next round!

576
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:42,293
"There are no doors to the Jungle Queen's fort!"

577
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:44,546
"To guard here.."

578
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:45,962
What's up, buddy?

579
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:47,963
What is this?

580
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:50,841
What's up, buddy?

581
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:54,842
Did you pick up just a soft drink?

582
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,803
Your body language suggests that you might just break into her house

583
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,511
the way you broke into my shop!

584
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:00,679
But let me tell you something.

585
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,931
That old woman's eyesight is still very sharp.

586
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:07,224
Thanks, buddy!

587
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,016
What for? - For the idea.

588
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:11,018
Did I give him an idea?

589
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:15,895
Hey, be careful!

590
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,564
One wrong step and you'll get washed away!

591
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:44,495
Hey! Stop right there!

592
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:47,621
Why are you quiet?

593
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:54,125
We need to make arrangements for the prayer ritual tonight.

594
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,960
Peel some jackfruits.

595
00:41:57,085 --> 00:41:59,836
So, the old woman can't see without her glasses!

596
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:01,503
She has mistaken me to be the servant.

597
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:20,598
Hi!

598
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,973
Hey! What is it?

599
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:26,768
I came to exchange phone numbers.

600
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:28,101
Why do you want my phone number?

601
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,436
What are you talking! Only then can our love blossom.

602
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,770
What did you say? Love?

603
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:34,772
Yes, of course. And it's no ordinary love.

604
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:38,066
It is an intense love. - I'm not joking about it either.

605
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,567
I'm serious about it.

606
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:42,193
I don't love you, I don't think I ever will.

607
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,278
Get lost!

608
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,327
"Why did you embrace me, if you had to shun me later?"

609
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:05,663
"To you, I've dedicated my life."

610
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:11,001
"Did I deserve this fate? What were you thinking?"

611
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:16,252
"Did I deserve this fate? What were you thinking?"

612
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:26,425
"Why did you embrace me?"

613
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:32,011
"You burnt my heart with your fiery eyes."

614
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:37,557
"Why did you hit my butterfly-heart with a whip?"

615
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:42,934
"My fate is doomed, there's no sign of joy anywhere."

616
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:48,146
"My fate is doomed, there's no sign of joy anywhere."

617
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:58,652
"Why did you embrace me?"

618
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:11,575
In the sword fight, pointing swords at each other..

619
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:31,420
We enjoy fights, but we shouldn't fight.

620
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:33,753
It's better to make others fight and watch the show.

621
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:36,880
In some homes, if there's a fight happening outside

622
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:40,007
the members of the house rush out to watch it.

623
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:45,052
Two groups have come here to fight.

624
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:46,720
One group says, money is more important than love.

625
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:48,553
The other claims otherwise.

626
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:51,389
Let's sit back and watch them fight.

627
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:56,557
If two roosters fight, we can sit next to them and watch without any fear.

628
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:00,894
But when a bull fight happens, we would watch it only from rooftops.

629
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:04,478
Else, the bull might trample us.. - Stop it!

630
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:08,606
No one should leave this place.

631
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,358
My wife's ring, that my daughter, Vanaroja was wearing, is missing.

632
00:45:13,483 --> 00:45:16,235
It's worth Rs.25,000.

633
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,237
Anyone who has taken it in greed and returns it or anyone who finds it for us

634
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,780
will be given Rs.1 lakh.

635
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:25,199
One lakh!

636
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,700
We won't get this kind of money even if we work all our lives!

637
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:29,076
Get down and search.

638
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:31,786
Gold is more important than this silly debate!

639
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,918
Your boss had announced about that ring, right?

640
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,502
Yes. - I'm thinking of looking for it.

641
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,338
Can you give me the details?

642
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,595
It's round in shape. It can be worn on a finger.

643
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,137
All rings are round in shape

644
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,514
and can be worn on a finger. - It's gold in color.

645
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:11,056
I'll chop your ears off, bald head!

646
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:12,641
Look at him giving the description!

647
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:15,184
Looks like he'll make one if he doesn't find the ring.

648
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:17,143
Our money's gone!

649
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:18,310
One lakh!

650
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,728
That one lakh belongs to us.

651
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,521
Start!

652
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,981
You weren't wearing this ring when you arrived.

653
00:46:25,106 --> 00:46:27,400
Isn't it the same ring? - This is my ring.

654
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:30,068
Had it been that ring, wouldn't he have given it and claimed the bounty?

655
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:32,069
Then, let's claim it. - By giving this ring?

656
00:46:32,193 --> 00:46:33,445
Yes. Give it. - My ring!

657
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,403
Quiet. How many grams is it?

658
00:46:35,528 --> 00:46:38,530
Five grams. - That doesn't make you a feudal lord!

659
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:40,907
What does five grams fetch anyway? Didn't you hear him?

660
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,075
You will get Rs.1 lakh. Who will give you so much?

661
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,076
Hey! What are you.. Come closer.

662
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:47,451
What are you thinking?

663
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:49,954
If you give this ring to him, he will give you Rs.1 lakh.

664
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,413
You take 50,000, while the committee gets 50,000.

665
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:53,664
If you agree to this deal

666
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:55,915
your petty shop will turn into a departmental store.

667
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:58,791
Is it a yes or a no? - No.

668
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,208
What the heck! He is not agreeing for it!

669
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,751
He meant to say that he agrees. - Oh!

670
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:02,918
No!

671
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:06,420
Idiot, they'll doubt you if you give it as it is.

672
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:10,714
Roll it in the mud a bit. Only then will they believe!

673
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:14,133
You'll own a store for sure! Come on.

674
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:17,135
Actually, I..

675
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:19,260
I can perform as well.

676
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,511
Watch me!

677
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:25,932
Take it.

678
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:32,601
I've found the ring!

679
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,770
Looks like he didn't have to search for it much.

680
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,565
We can settle it for 25,000. - Shut up and come.

681
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:44,692
Thanks a lot.. Give it to me.

682
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,610
We've searched hard for it.

683
00:47:48,027 --> 00:47:49,653
Be liberal in your reward.

684
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,492
He's watching so intently, is he gonna find out?

685
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:01,951
Thank you, sir. - Wait!

686
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:05,869
You bring me a brass ring

687
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,955
and call it as my wife's! - Actually..

688
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:11,790
Oh, no! - Come on..

689
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,416
Get my ring back! - Didn't you hear him?

690
00:48:16,543 --> 00:48:19,169
How dare you fool us with a brass ring!

691
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:21,795
I'll lose it! - He has lost it anyway.

692
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,213
Let's go, pal. - Oh, no!

693
00:48:47,393 --> 00:48:50,269
With my weak eyesight, I can hardly see. God alone should lead me to that ring.

694
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:55,813
Ma'am, here's the lost ring. Hand it over and take the bounty.

695
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:59,482
Even you could've given it and taken the bounty.

696
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,360
Ma'am, that girl doesn't like me.

697
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:07,112
If I give it to her, she might say that it doesn't belong to her.

698
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,572
It feels as if God himself has appeared to help me.

699
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:15,615
I've never lost in any of my mind games.

700
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:18,034
I don't have any friends in this town.

701
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:21,702
The next person I see will be the one

702
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:25,204
I'm going to travel with for the rest of my stay here.

703
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:35,211
I only had girlfriends in mind!

704
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:37,252
God bless you, sir!

705
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,382
Wear it carefully. I'd sent you here so that you could enjoy the festival.

706
00:49:43,507 --> 00:49:44,715
Come on, let's go back home.

707
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,800
No, dad. I'll stay back and come along with grandma tomorrow.

708
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:50,719
Please. - The car will be there, come soon.

709
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,679
Did you forget that your birthday's nearing?

710
00:49:54,637 --> 00:49:57,681
I'm going to give you a gift that's going to make you very happy.

711
00:49:57,806 --> 00:49:59,182
What is it, fraud?

712
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,349
Surprise!

713
00:50:01,557 --> 00:50:02,726
Shall I leave? - Okay.

714
00:50:03,393 --> 00:50:04,976
What is that surprise? - Come along!

715
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:06,728
Won't you tell me?

716
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:13,815
Ma'am, that girl does not like me.

717
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:15,315
I like you, fraud!

718
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:22,110
Dude, it's midnight. I beg you. Please come down.

719
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,739
Dude, please come down.

720
00:50:26,864 --> 00:50:29,407
I will go and talk to her for you.

721
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:31,240
Enough. Stop it.

722
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,534
Don't drink up there. At least, come down and drink.

723
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,367
Is it enough?

724
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,661
Hey! - Okay.

725
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:41,704
What are you looking at?

726
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:54,336
Before the firecracker bursts in the sky

727
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:56,588
if she touches the tree to which the radio is tied

728
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:59,548
her grandma will forget all old quarrels and visit her village.

729
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:03,759
Crazy girl! Okay!

730
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:07,219
I'll apply the same technique.

731
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,221
I'm going to jump from this tree to that one.

732
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,266
If I make it, she loves me.

733
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:21,226
If I don't make it..

734
00:51:22,853 --> 00:51:24,144
If I don't make it

735
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:26,270
she doesn't love me.

736
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:32,023
Ready.. 1, 2..

737
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:33,275
Hey!

738
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:40,195
She loves me for sure.

739
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:23,469
Dude, I told you that she loves me.

740
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:45,815
"Hey, belle, serve me some toddy."

741
00:52:46,106 --> 00:52:48,858
"I'm all shaken up!"

742
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:52,110
"Hey, belle, serve me some toddy."

743
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:55,320
"I'm all shaken up!"

744
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:58,530
"If you follow me, I'll feel shy."

745
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,698
"Unsaid desires will engulf me."

746
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:05,075
"Hurriedly, he organized a competition."

747
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:08,077
"The young boy sweetened my mouth with sugar."

748
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:11,704
"I cried and cribbed."

749
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:14,622
"I stood my ground despite all odds."

750
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:20,666
"Oh, you give me such loving looks."

751
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,418
"My heart beats to the drums"

752
00:53:23,543 --> 00:53:27,170
"while my mind gently hums."

753
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:29,922
"My heart beats to the drums"

754
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:34,048
"while my mind gently hums."

755
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:56,394
"I bathed in a shower of delight."

756
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:59,646
"I laughed to my heart's content."

757
00:53:59,771 --> 00:54:06,025
"The clothes hung to dry, wave to you in agreement."

758
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:12,320
"Love sparkles in your big eyes."

759
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:18,532
"Our eyes met.. Oh, God! They got locked forever."

760
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:21,033
"My heart beats to the drums"

761
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:24,868
"while my mind gently hums."

762
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:27,329
"My heart beats to the drums"

763
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:31,331
"while my mind gently hums."

764
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:34,708
"Hey, belle, serve me some toddy."

765
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:38,000
"I'm all shaken up!"

766
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:40,878
"If you follow me, I'll feel shy."

767
00:54:41,003 --> 00:54:44,171
"Unsaid desires will engulf me."

768
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,092
"As we continue to chat"

769
00:54:54,217 --> 00:54:57,344
"the butterflies in my stomach make me nervous."

770
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:03,681
"You create the rainbow within the house."

771
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:10,309
"I hear you, even when the dogs bark."

772
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:16,521
"When you walk by the lakeshore"

773
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,981
"even the water in the well peeps out to catch a glimpse of you."

774
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:29,362
"Hey, belle, serve me some toddy."

775
00:55:29,487 --> 00:55:32,530
"I'm all shaken up!"

776
00:55:32,655 --> 00:55:35,449
"If you follow me, I'll feel shy."

777
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,534
"Unsaid desires will engulf me."

778
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:40,994
"My heart beats to the drums"

779
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,954
"while my mind gently hums."

780
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:47,331
"My heart beats to the drums"

781
00:55:47,456 --> 00:55:51,416
"while my mind gently hums."

782
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,834
"My heart beats to the drums"

783
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:58,252
"while my mind gently hums."

784
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:05,339
I've promised my dad that I'll marry the man of his choice.

785
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:09,134
I'll tell my dad about us, as soon as I get back home.

786
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:13,010
Don't worry, my dad always listens to me.

787
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,762
What did you say? Are you going to tell your dad about us?

788
00:56:16,304 --> 00:56:21,181
Instead of enjoying during your holidays, you're worried about love and dad.

789
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:23,724
I never had any such thing on my mind.

790
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:26,059
Fraud! - Just kidding.

791
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:29,019
That's what I like about you.

792
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:32,271
Oh, dad! - You can call him back later.

793
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,023
The car must've arrived. I have to leave.

794
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:35,481
What is it?

795
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,275
Let me go, I should be going.

796
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,651
I'll call you later.

797
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:42,735
What is it?

798
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,486
Fraud!

799
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:56,952
What did you just do? I didn't ask for all this.

800
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,501
Fraud! How many times will you call me up?

801
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:15,586
I told you that I won't come until you tell me about my birthday gift.

802
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:17,005
Surprise!

803
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:20,130
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Hang up, I'm coming.

804
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:26,550
Dear.. Welcome.

805
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,637
Old age has mellowed grandma. - We've reached the gates already.

806
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,137
What is the gift?

807
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:34,639
There's time until midnight.

808
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:38,474
This is an advance gift. You'll be amazed!

809
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:42,768
I know what kids are up to these days.

810
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,810
You've shown great faith in your dad by promising

811
00:57:44,936 --> 00:57:47,271
to marry the groom of your dad's choice.

812
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:51,731
See, the groom I've chosen for you won't betray your faith in me.

813
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:55,775
The engagement will be take place now.

814
00:57:56,233 --> 00:57:57,527
The wedding will take place on the next auspicious date.

815
00:57:59,695 --> 00:58:01,862
You're going to look at him for the rest of your life.

816
00:58:01,987 --> 00:58:04,489
Come, change into a sari. - With the grace of the Lord

817
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,740
invitation to the wedding ceremony

818
00:58:06,864 --> 00:58:10,449
of Madurai district, Thirumangalam Taluk's resident

819
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:15,077
Mr. S. Sundaramurthy Poochandan's son, Krishna

820
00:58:15,202 --> 00:58:18,538
and Coimbatore district, Pollachi Taluk, Vadakkutheru's residents

821
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:22,414
S. Poongavanam and Kaveri's daughter, Vanaroja's wedding

822
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:26,416
will be solemnized with the mutual consent of both the families.

823
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:30,170
This is the document announcing their engagement.

824
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:32,253
May the auspicious happen!

825
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:36,298
It's Vanaroja's birthday tomorrow.

826
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:38,090
I'll go at midnight

827
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,674
and surprise her by being the first one to wish her.

828
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,676
How do you know that it's her birthday tomorrow?

829
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:49,222
I'd seen the number plate on her father's car when he had come for the festival.

830
00:58:49,804 --> 00:58:54,682
121212. That's the girl's birthday.

831
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:55,934
You're a fountain of wisdom!

832
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,187
It's Vanaroja's call. - Talk to her.

833
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,025
Fool!

834
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:19,572
Oh!

835
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:23,198
Why did you disconnect?

836
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,783
She didn't mention about her birthday before she left.

837
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:29,077
She must be calling up now to inform me about it.

838
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:30,828
So, why are you disconnecting the call?

839
00:59:31,452 --> 00:59:33,996
'It's my birthday today.'

840
00:59:34,121 --> 00:59:35,997
What's the fun if Vanaroja says that

841
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:38,081
and then, we celebrate her birthday?

842
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:41,125
She thinks that I don't know about it. Now, when I go and stand in front of her

843
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,918
and we celebrate her birthday, wouldn't that be fun?

844
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:46,128
Intelligent. - Buddy, it was my birthday yesterday.

845
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,378
Did you know that?

846
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:51,839
You never told me!

847
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,423
Boys must come and announce their birthdays.

848
00:59:54,548 --> 00:59:57,509
But if it's a girl's birthday, you'll find it out yourself!

849
00:59:57,634 --> 01:00:00,844
Isn't that so? You didn't hear what I just said.

850
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:02,886
It fell on deaf ears!

851
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:09,516
Perform all kinds of rituals. She is my wife.

852
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:11,224
On her birthday

853
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:14,601
she should see this splendidly decorated idol of the Lord first.

854
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:15,851
Okay, sir.

855
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,021
Where is she?

856
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:23,772
The boys have gone to fetch her. She'll be here any moment.

857
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,778
Ma'am, it's almost midnight. Sir will be angry at us.

858
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:36,072
Please get ready.

859
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:36,020
Hey! Ma'am is hugging someone!

860
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:39,105
Pass me the phone.

861
01:03:49,385 --> 01:03:50,844
Look over there!

862
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:25,270
How dare you cheat me!

863
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,273
Ma'am has fooled us all.

864
01:05:29,398 --> 01:05:30,523
She is dead!

865
01:05:31,817 --> 01:05:33,108
Mark this day.

866
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:36,486
I need to perform her death anniversary every year.

867
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:52,077
How are the birthday celebrations coming along?

868
01:05:53,994 --> 01:05:57,121
What! Flee the town?

869
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:00,415
It's good to help someone who's in love.

870
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,458
It gets scary only when trouble pops up!

871
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,626
Wait! Where are you going?

872
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:08,045
I'm in a hurry, let me go.

873
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:11,255
In a hurry? Chinna Vandu owes me Rs. 77.

874
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,672
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

875
01:06:12,797 --> 01:06:14,798
Are you trying to flee the town when you owe me Rs. 120?

876
01:06:14,923 --> 01:06:16,173
He is the root cause of all the problems.

877
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:18,425
I know that he has always been the troublemaker.

878
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,885
Out with my money! - I need to go, please understand. I beg you.

879
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,135
They'll be here.

880
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,221
Who will be here? - Shall I fall at your feet?

881
01:06:25,346 --> 01:06:26,972
Shut up! Give it to me!

882
01:06:27,304 --> 01:06:28,681
Give me my money.

883
01:06:28,806 --> 01:06:30,514
You want the money, right? - Yes.

884
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:32,307
Instead of giving you the money, I'll take some from you.

885
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,185
Chinna Vandu.. - Yeah. - ...was hitting on that old woman's granddaughter.

886
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:39,186
You know about it, right? - Very well.

887
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:42,896
That girl got engaged to a notorious gangster in Palani.

888
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:45,398
That's good, lucky girl.

889
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,650
Chinna Vandu eloped with her last night.

890
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:52,818
I'll spread the rumor that you were the one

891
01:06:53,152 --> 01:06:57,112
who helped the lovers unite. And then I'll leave this town.

892
01:06:57,237 --> 01:07:01,823
The gangsters will collect the bag from you, as decently as they can.

893
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:04,826
Shall I take your leave? - What's the hurry, dear?

894
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:06,659
Only if you tell me will I know about this.

895
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:08,327
You can take this.

896
01:07:08,744 --> 01:07:11,328
I don't want the bag. I want Rs. 500.

897
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:12,580
500?

898
01:07:12,746 --> 01:07:14,413
700. - 700!

899
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:16,582
I deserve this for poking my nose!

900
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:19,750
Hey.. You seem to be already! - Hello, sir.

901
01:07:19,876 --> 01:07:22,419
That's nothing. Actually, sir..

902
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:27,087
My friend, Chinna Vandu and that old woman's granddaughter, Vanaroja.. - Yeah?

903
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:30,590
...who had come to attend the festival? - Yeah.. - They eloped last night.

904
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:36,175
He helped them in eloping.

905
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,344
Okay.

906
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:42,179
He's sending them some money and clothes through me.

907
01:07:43,262 --> 01:07:46,889
Keep this money. Take this bag and go away. Go.

908
01:07:47,016 --> 01:07:49,142
Pack your bags as well, you might have to follow me soon.

909
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:51,600
I'll come back soon! - Don't come back, get lost!

910
01:08:01,356 --> 01:08:03,190
Okay, let bygones be bygones.

911
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,024
For now, don't get married.

912
01:08:06,193 --> 01:08:08,527
I tied her the nuptial chain on our way here.

913
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:12,363
Birthday celebrations have turned into wedding night celebrations!

914
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:14,364
It's not like what you're thinking.

915
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:17,490
So, you can hear my thoughts!

916
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:24,578
Ma'am, put that nuptial chain inside.

917
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:26,161
The sight of it scares me!

918
01:08:26,578 --> 01:08:28,037
Put it inside.

919
01:08:28,747 --> 01:08:30,289
Why are you scolding my wife unnecessarily?

920
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:34,207
Don't get him wrong.

921
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:38,668
If my family finds about our marriage

922
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:41,045
it'll create a big problem. Well, that's a different issue.

923
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:44,380
Both my brothers are still looking out for brides.

924
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:48,882
Their hopes of getting married will be squashed if the news of my marriage is spread.

925
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,300
In that case, let's not tell them about our marriage.

926
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:54,802
I'm very proud of you.

927
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:57,511
I don't know, how you are able to speak English in this situation.

928
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,681
Without letting anyone know that there's some connection between us

929
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:06,141
if only I can take Vanaroja home under some pretext..

930
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,726
He has decided to oust me from the house.

931
01:09:08,851 --> 01:09:13,395
Later, I'll plead with someone.. From a good family..

932
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:17,356
That's quite unlikely.. I'll find some girl

933
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:19,399
and get my eldest brother married.

934
01:09:19,774 --> 01:09:23,359
After that, even if I end up getting beaten up, I can tell everyone the truth.

935
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,238
I'm unable to think of a plan though!

936
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:31,030
None of your plans fail to get me trapped.

937
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:36,367
Call up home and inform them about the change in your phone number.

938
01:09:36,492 --> 01:09:39,244
Also, specifically, cite that I'm not with you.

939
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:40,911
It'll be good of you. - Why?

940
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:43,453
Obstacles to marriage will be removed.

941
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:45,746
The alliance that you searched long and far

942
01:09:45,872 --> 01:09:48,332
will knock at your door.

943
01:09:48,873 --> 01:09:51,416
This is the day when your soul mate comes looking for you.

944
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:55,293
They never mention it this way.

945
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:18,473
"An angel has arrived in search of you."

946
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:27,603
"She arrived in a golden chariot to weave the clouds into a garland."

947
01:10:42,737 --> 01:10:43,819
Mr. Sambandham!

948
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,154
Mr. Sambandham!

949
01:10:47,738 --> 01:10:50,198
He doesn't feel youthful even when he is imagining!

950
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,951
There should be another one inside. Where's he?

951
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:03,872
February 14th is Valentine's day. You know about it, right?

952
01:11:03,997 --> 01:11:05,665
Mark that date in your calendar.

953
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:08,458
Your wedding bells will start ringing on that day.

954
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:12,961
"Don't know why, my dreams seem happier."

955
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,920
"My thoughts seem more colorful."

956
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,256
"Imagination clouds my vision."

957
01:11:19,131 --> 01:11:23,467
"Don't know why, a war ensues in my heart."

958
01:11:24,009 --> 01:11:28,761
"The buds bloom when the tree is about to fall."

959
01:11:30,304 --> 01:11:34,890
"Why is the new moon such a spectacle!"

960
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:40,602
"Somehow, I came across one today."

961
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:44,562
"An angel has arrived.."

962
01:11:44,686 --> 01:11:49,023
"Don't know why, my dreams seem happier."

963
01:11:49,314 --> 01:11:52,690
"An angel has arrived.."

964
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:57,485
"Don't know why, my dreams seem happier."

965
01:11:57,735 --> 01:12:00,487
Today onwards, she and I are going to unite.

966
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,613
That girl belongs only to me.

967
01:12:35,715 --> 01:12:37,798
I'm crying for you, you must also cry.

968
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:39,425
Only then can we evoke sympathy in them.

969
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:44,302
That is why, I brought her, sir.

970
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:46,179
Enough of your crocodile tears!

971
01:12:48,055 --> 01:12:49,514
Crying for an orphan it seems!

972
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,016
She will be an addition to my existing problems.

973
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:54,850
It's an unwanted headache for you as well.

974
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:57,143
Take her back.

975
01:12:57,268 --> 01:12:58,351
Well, Mr. Sambandham..

976
01:12:58,476 --> 01:13:03,021
Excuse me! Hi! I'm looking for a bell for the new church, a big one.

977
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:04,521
Do you have it?

978
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:12,152
She is speaking English. You won't understand.

979
01:13:12,277 --> 01:13:14,778
Shall I call Paramjothy? - Who? Your son, Paramjothy?

980
01:13:15,694 --> 01:13:17,195
To talk in English? - Yes.

981
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,197
Hasn't he spoilt enough orders already?

982
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:23,408
Do you want a bell? - Yeah.. Yeah..

983
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:27,452
We have bells of all sizes.

984
01:13:27,827 --> 01:13:29,661
You have a bell. But does it ring?

985
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:32,537
I do have the bell. What is the size you're looking for?

986
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:33,996
Big size bell.

987
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:35,623
Big size bell?

988
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:39,000
Was this commotion all about a regular bell?

989
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:43,293
Wait. Big size bell!

990
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:46,545
I don't think he has a bigger one than what he's showing.

991
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:50,506
I should try some other place. Thank you! Bye!

992
01:13:50,963 --> 01:13:53,006
Excuse me. - Yeah? - Ma'am, one minute.

993
01:13:55,175 --> 01:13:57,385
Sir, she wants a big bell

994
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,969
for the new church that is being constructed.

995
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:03,304
We can make bells weighing up to 1500 kilos!

996
01:14:04,846 --> 01:14:10,224
I guess, we need a bell that would weigh 1500 kg so it'll be as attractive as you say.

997
01:14:11,266 --> 01:14:14,769
Okay, let's place an order. What will be the cost?

998
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:18,855
Sir, she's asking the price of the bell.

999
01:14:20,271 --> 01:14:23,399
This fellow doesn't know to operate a calculator.

1000
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:25,191
It throws up a zero for all the buttons! - Exactly!

1001
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:28,110
Even a calculator doesn't work in this shop.

1002
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:32,403
It'll cost more than Rs. 5 lakhs.

1003
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:35,739
I guess, it'll be around Rs. 7 lakhs

1004
01:14:35,863 --> 01:14:38,823
and you can pay, Rs. 5 lakhs in advance and the rest later.

1005
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:40,240
Okay.

1006
01:14:49,997 --> 01:14:51,664
Thank you so much! - Okay. - Now, you've taken the order.

1007
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:53,206
It will take six months. - Did you see that?

1008
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,375
You only hand this over to sir, ma'am.

1009
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,296
Here.

1010
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,381
Thank you, Lord! - I'll take your leave, ma'am.

1011
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,094
I'll take your leave, sir.

1012
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:21,971
Okay, dear!

1013
01:15:44,484 --> 01:15:46,068
I'm seeing Rs. 5 lakh.. - Dear..

1014
01:15:46,694 --> 01:15:49,321
That girl seems to be lady luck herself!

1015
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:51,029
Why are you sending her away?

1016
01:15:51,154 --> 01:15:52,738
You can keep her as an accountant.

1017
01:15:53,155 --> 01:15:54,990
Tell her not to go.

1018
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:57,449
Call them.

1019
01:15:58,618 --> 01:15:59,743
Soori!

1020
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:05,662
Let the girl work here as an accountant. What say?

1021
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:10,331
You can go.

1022
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:11,833
Thank you, Mr. Sambandham!

1023
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,751
She'll be a good match for the eldest one.

1024
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:18,879
Orphans don't carry iPhones!

1025
01:16:19,003 --> 01:16:22,088
Go and join duty. Go.

1026
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,675
Which caste do you belong to?

1027
01:16:32,136 --> 01:16:36,930
Buddy, mission accomplished! But your brothers' looks are worrying.

1028
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,932
I've made my exit, you can make your entry. - Where are you going?

1029
01:16:40,306 --> 01:16:43,224
People who get trapped by those

1030
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,310
who elope and marry..

1031
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:49,729
The hosiery companies of Tirupur welcome them all to a good life!

1032
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:54,315
641601. - What will you do there?

1033
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:57,357
I'll stitch briefs for a living! Hang up, man!

1034
01:16:57,858 --> 01:16:59,734
Silly questions!

1035
01:17:01,068 --> 01:17:03,610
Why are you dressed up like a clown?

1036
01:17:03,735 --> 01:17:06,363
He's the second one I was talking about.

1037
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:07,697
His name is Parandhaman.

1038
01:17:07,863 --> 01:17:08,947
Greetings, sir.

1039
01:17:09,155 --> 01:17:12,365
Thank God, she didn't call me 'brother'!

1040
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:19,494
I'm eager to confess my love to you, but if you reject, I won't be able to bear it.

1041
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:23,372
I'll get the soot from the shaman and impress you.

1042
01:17:23,497 --> 01:17:25,832
I'll seat you on my lap and make you my wife.

1043
01:17:25,957 --> 01:17:27,750
He's fair like me.

1044
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,377
Come. He's dark like his father.

1045
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:35,378
My eldest son, Paramjothy. - Greetings, sir.

1046
01:17:35,837 --> 01:17:38,130
Did she ask you about my complexion?

1047
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:41,841
I'll lighten my complexion and tighten my muscles.

1048
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:45,301
You won't be able to resist proposing to me.

1049
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:48,886
Both of us will give a befitting reply to that squeaky rat of a brother!

1050
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,929
You've slimmed down in a day!

1051
01:17:51,054 --> 01:17:52,512
I've been going to the gym, mom.

1052
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:40,663
Hey! Hey!

1053
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:45,792
Mom! What do I do? Thief!

1054
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,127
Thief! I've caught her! - Let her go! - I won't let her go!

1055
01:18:49,252 --> 01:18:50,503
She's stealing the lamps, mom.

1056
01:18:50,627 --> 01:18:53,045
How can anyone steal when I'm around? Get away.

1057
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,338
What the heck!

1058
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:56,965
She has joined as an accountant.

1059
01:18:57,381 --> 01:19:00,216
Go. I'm sorry.

1060
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:03,302
Didn't I tell you about the youngest one?

1061
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,927
He is Chinna Vandu.

1062
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,096
Greetings, sir.

1063
01:19:07,595 --> 01:19:10,763
What is it? Are you wondering why he's quiet? - Fraud.

1064
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:14,182
As both his brothers aren't married yet

1065
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:19,394
he doesn't even look at any girl, dear.

1066
01:19:21,686 --> 01:19:23,145
Darn the power!

1067
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:24,980
I'll find a matchbox. - Okay, mom.

1068
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,523
Take your time, mom.

1069
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:31,067
We had decided to keep it clean for now, right?

1070
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,402
Like an egg in a vegetarian meal, we can keep it clean with just a kiss.

1071
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:55,579
"Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping"

1072
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:57,747
"my heart skips a beat!"

1073
01:19:58,707 --> 01:20:02,167
"If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry."

1074
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,210
"She will make mincemeat out of you."

1075
01:20:05,543 --> 01:20:08,878
"Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping"

1076
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:11,546
"my heart skips a beat!"

1077
01:20:12,006 --> 01:20:15,425
"If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry."

1078
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:17,634
"She will make mincemeat out of you."

1079
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:24,888
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1080
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:31,474
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1081
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:48,525
"Look at the lady for a while"

1082
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,693
"and you'll be mailed the fever of love."

1083
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:55,195
"Thinking yourself to be a man, if you try getting too close to her"

1084
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,363
"she'll send you back in an ambulance."

1085
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:04,493
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1086
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:11,205
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1087
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:27,589
"Tucker, tucker, top tucker"

1088
01:21:27,713 --> 01:21:30,923
"her name stuck to my heart real quick."

1089
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:34,259
"Cooker, cooker, she's a hot cooker."

1090
01:21:34,634 --> 01:21:37,594
"My heart refuses to forget her."

1091
01:21:37,886 --> 01:21:41,305
"Her words taste like the candy."

1092
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,222
"Her body, a bottle of honey."

1093
01:21:44,347 --> 01:21:47,891
"Her costume, colorful like a lollipop."

1094
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:51,226
"Her beauty makes me throw up poems!"

1095
01:21:51,351 --> 01:21:57,104
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1096
01:21:57,604 --> 01:22:02,732
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1097
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:47,048
"Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping"

1098
01:22:47,173 --> 01:22:49,050
"my heart skips a beat!"

1099
01:22:50,384 --> 01:22:53,677
"If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry."

1100
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,095
"She will make mincemeat out of you."

1101
01:22:56,637 --> 01:23:03,015
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1102
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:09,603
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1103
01:23:09,936 --> 01:23:16,148
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1104
01:23:16,523 --> 01:23:23,444
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1105
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:25,195
"Game over."

1106
01:23:38,868 --> 01:23:42,328
Thank God, he is eating bananas.

1107
01:23:42,453 --> 01:23:45,831
Instead, had it been soft drinks.. - Did they hear that?

1108
01:23:52,877 --> 01:23:55,045
So.. They caught you finally!

1109
01:23:56,462 --> 01:23:59,589
I saw this man sending the money.

1110
01:24:00,338 --> 01:24:03,966
Interrogate him nicely, he'll speak up.

1111
01:24:05,425 --> 01:24:07,134
They can be found easily.

1112
01:24:10,427 --> 01:24:12,054
It's a lie!

1113
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:14,305
These poor guys are trapped because of that guy's antics!

1114
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,806
His family was living in Kumbakonam earlier.

1115
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:18,474
I had last visited them long back for their youngest son's first birthday.

1116
01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:20,182
Recently, I heard that they have shifted their house.

1117
01:24:20,307 --> 01:24:22,350
Nobody knows about their current address.

1118
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,310
This guy is a good man.

1119
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:26,770
Had he been guilty, he'd have confessed by now.

1120
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,939
Can you lend me betel leaves worth Rs. 5?

1121
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:34,524
Do you think I'm in a condition to give you anything?

1122
01:24:35,233 --> 01:24:36,484
Take a break and go to the shop.

1123
01:24:41,403 --> 01:24:44,195
Kumbakonam! I'll manage the rest.

1124
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:47,447
What are you doing?

1125
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:04,583
I told you, don't get physical.

1126
01:25:09,627 --> 01:25:11,503
These days, even singles aren't virgins!

1127
01:25:13,045 --> 01:25:15,963
You're my wife.. But no!

1128
01:25:16,171 --> 01:25:17,339
Vanaroja..

1129
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:22,967
One jug, two pans, three bowls..

1130
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,802
What are you doing?

1131
01:25:26,302 --> 01:25:28,595
Checking out. I mean, I'm checking the stock.

1132
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,305
Go and take rest.

1133
01:25:33,347 --> 01:25:38,685
Whatever you want to check, check with me.

1134
01:25:38,893 --> 01:25:42,060
Don't ask that girl. - But you know nothing.

1135
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:43,895
Still, you should ask me.

1136
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:46,396
It's because she is your sister-in-law.

1137
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:48,230
Younger sister-in-law.

1138
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,114
Param, see this photo.

1139
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:04,782
She is born for you.

1140
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:06,449
I didn't like this girl.

1141
01:26:08,201 --> 01:26:09,451
You didn't even look at the photo!

1142
01:26:14,246 --> 01:26:15,663
I didn't like this girl.

1143
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:18,998
That's the horoscope.

1144
01:26:19,122 --> 01:26:20,915
The photo's here.

1145
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:25,752
I didn't like this girl.

1146
01:26:26,336 --> 01:26:27,670
Hey, Paramjothy!

1147
01:26:27,961 --> 01:26:29,753
Hey, Chinna Vandu! I need to know right now!

1148
01:26:29,878 --> 01:26:31,712
Should I live or die? Find out!

1149
01:26:31,838 --> 01:26:33,922
Hey, stop. What do you think of yourself?

1150
01:26:34,047 --> 01:26:35,506
What the heck do you think of yourself?

1151
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,134
What's wrong with this girl? Tell me. What's wrong?

1152
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:41,219
See how beautiful she is.

1153
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,637
If she's a beauty

1154
01:26:46,012 --> 01:26:47,680
what do you think of her?

1155
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:56,394
Divine beauty!

1156
01:26:56,644 --> 01:27:00,646
If I ever get married, she will be the one I'll marry.

1157
01:27:02,104 --> 01:27:03,230
Take it.

1158
01:27:11,068 --> 01:27:12,235
Hey!

1159
01:27:12,402 --> 01:27:13,528
There's no one here.

1160
01:27:16,363 --> 01:27:19,655
Vanaroja! The bill book?

1161
01:27:21,073 --> 01:27:22,198
It's there inside the drawer.

1162
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:29,953
Vanaroja! It's there.

1163
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:33,538
It's there. It's there.

1164
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:42,002
It's so difficult to walk on the treadmill without wearing shorts.

1165
01:27:44,045 --> 01:27:46,962
What happened? - Something went into my eye.

1166
01:27:47,212 --> 01:27:50,172
It's just dust.. Why are you overacting?

1167
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:52,548
Get going with your work.

1168
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:56,135
Silly girl. - Wait!

1169
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,344
What?

1170
01:27:57,469 --> 01:27:58,927
Why did you scold her? - Why?

1171
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:02,305
Why is everybody in this house torturing that girl?

1172
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:07,474
I won't spare anyone who speaks another word against her!

1173
01:28:07,724 --> 01:28:08,850
Mind it!

1174
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,934
Vanaroja!

1175
01:28:19,605 --> 01:28:21,439
Who knows which bell is ringing!

1176
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:27,985
Thank God, she didn't turn up.

1177
01:28:30,194 --> 01:28:31,778
I'm very scared.

1178
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:33,655
I've to live in this house forever.

1179
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:36,197
Both your brothers are serious about me.

1180
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:39,367
I don't know what to do. - Don't worry.

1181
01:28:39,783 --> 01:28:41,660
We've found a bride for my brother.

1182
01:28:42,327 --> 01:28:43,744
We're going to meet her tomorrow morning.

1183
01:28:43,993 --> 01:28:47,621
So that takes care of our problem. Okay?

1184
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:53,123
Who is the groom? - Make a guess!

1185
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,210
He's the groom's grandfather.

1186
01:28:59,127 --> 01:29:03,880
Hello? The signal's weak here, I will come out and speak.

1187
01:29:05,296 --> 01:29:06,881
He's the groom's father.

1188
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:12,802
He is the groom's uncle.

1189
01:29:16,386 --> 01:29:17,595
Where's the groom?

1190
01:29:18,387 --> 01:29:20,680
Look, there comes the groom!

1191
01:29:22,931 --> 01:29:24,932
The groom is handsome!

1192
01:29:25,684 --> 01:29:28,143
Do you like him? - Yes, I do.

1193
01:29:28,435 --> 01:29:29,602
Greetings!

1194
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:37,731
Take the silver cup. - No, I should be taking this one.

1195
01:29:37,856 --> 01:29:40,817
No, take the silver cup. - No, it's for the groom.

1196
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,234
That's exactly why I'm asking you to take it.

1197
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:44,235
Oh! I am not the groom.

1198
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:45,485
It is him.

1199
01:29:47,069 --> 01:29:49,195
What! Is he the groom?

1200
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:51,197
Yes.

1201
01:29:51,948 --> 01:29:54,533
Why did you change the groom all of a sudden! - No..

1202
01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:56,951
Neither did I like this groom, nor am I interested in this wedding.

1203
01:29:57,868 --> 01:29:59,035
Ma'am!

1204
01:30:02,953 --> 01:30:07,164
Had this girl worked out for him, I could've settled down with Vanaroja.

1205
01:30:08,122 --> 01:30:09,331
Alas!

1206
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:13,626
Even if you had chosen me, I'd have rejected you.

1207
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:18,253
I don't have a place in my heart for anybody else other than Vanaroja.

1208
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:22,797
Henceforth, that's all you get to eat! - Mom!

1209
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:25,757
It's porridge. - Darn it! I can't cook anymore.

1210
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:27,259
I don't have the strength anymore.

1211
01:30:27,384 --> 01:30:29,092
Why are you smashing the pans to say that?

1212
01:30:29,217 --> 01:30:30,301
It's because I'm having a toothache!

1213
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,720
Toothache? Vanaroja is a dentist.

1214
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,262
Vanaroja, take a look at mom.

1215
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,514
What did you say? Vanaroja is a dentist!

1216
01:30:42,809 --> 01:30:44,768
Yes. Vanaroja is a dentist.

1217
01:30:44,894 --> 01:30:46,311
He is a neurologist.

1218
01:30:46,435 --> 01:30:48,519
He is a heart specialist. Dad is a general physician.

1219
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:52,355
If your tooth's aching, you should visit the hospital!

1220
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:53,814
Correct.

1221
01:30:53,939 --> 01:30:55,315
Mom, go to the hospital.

1222
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:02,027
She has no toothache.

1223
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:03,904
That girl rejected you, right?

1224
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:07,988
That's why, she's grumbling.

1225
01:31:08,614 --> 01:31:11,449
We should hire a servant. - Dad!

1226
01:31:11,658 --> 01:31:13,409
I meant for cooking!

1227
01:31:25,082 --> 01:31:27,500
Ma'am, stop crying.

1228
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:30,126
I wonder who cursed us.

1229
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,087
My sons are still unmarried.

1230
01:31:34,546 --> 01:31:36,838
We sell lamps to the whole town

1231
01:31:37,838 --> 01:31:40,506
but we haven't found a girl to light the lamp in our house.

1232
01:31:41,548 --> 01:31:43,259
Have you ever gone to Thirumanancheri?

1233
01:31:44,676 --> 01:31:47,511
We have visited every temple and we have performed every ritual.

1234
01:31:48,802 --> 01:31:51,137
Have you taken Mr. Paramjothy to Thirumanancheri?

1235
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:55,099
Take him to that temple just once.

1236
01:31:55,224 --> 01:31:56,599
Something good will happen for sure.

1237
01:31:58,225 --> 01:31:59,893
Your words sound so divine, dear.

1238
01:32:00,893 --> 01:32:02,519
You also come with us. - Okay.

1239
01:32:19,237 --> 01:32:22,404
How can a girl propose first?

1240
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:24,655
I've been so foolish!

1241
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:27,283
When mom's not around

1242
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:29,742
I should give her the poems, I've written for her

1243
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:32,243
at this holy place itself.

1244
01:32:37,913 --> 01:32:40,914
Look, dear.. Wait.. Don't light a lamp with another one.

1245
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:43,625
Here, use this matchbox. - Thanks.

1246
01:32:58,757 --> 01:33:00,009
Vanaroja..

1247
01:33:25,523 --> 01:33:28,274
All these days, I've been looking at her as my lover.

1248
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:32,402
As soon as I stepped into this temple, I've started to perceive her as my wife.

1249
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,278
Vanaroja.

1250
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:44,449
Thanks!

1251
01:33:47,243 --> 01:33:48,577
Read it and..

1252
01:33:53,121 --> 01:33:55,206
Viji, are you fine? - I am fine.

1253
01:33:55,413 --> 01:33:57,706
Have you come alone? - No.

1254
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,418
Oh! Is she your daughter-in-law?

1255
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:02,835
She is beautiful.

1256
01:34:03,127 --> 01:34:04,294
See you, bye.

1257
01:34:28,349 --> 01:34:30,641
Hey, call him! - Mister!

1258
01:34:31,225 --> 01:34:32,600
Hey! Call him!

1259
01:34:32,725 --> 01:34:34,351
Excuse me. - What is it?

1260
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:37,728
Get going! Don't stand in the middle of the road!

1261
01:34:37,854 --> 01:34:39,771
Turn left, take a U-turn and get going.

1262
01:34:39,896 --> 01:34:42,814
The one at the center! Don't wait for the signal, get going.

1263
01:34:43,314 --> 01:34:45,357
Do I need to tell you separately?

1264
01:34:47,234 --> 01:34:48,777
That car is still not moving!

1265
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,404
You!

1266
01:34:58,282 --> 01:35:02,159
Hey, fool! If you take a right, I can take a left and keep going.

1267
01:35:02,283 --> 01:35:05,161
Why are you blocking the road like a buffalo!

1268
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:18,042
Sorry, sir.. Forgive me!

1269
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:21,961
It was my mistake. Forgive me!

1270
01:35:22,087 --> 01:35:24,546
Don't hit me. - I'll kill you.

1271
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,552
His pose suggests that he might turn back and attack again.

1272
01:35:37,845 --> 01:35:40,555
Why should I take a risk? I'll get going.

1273
01:35:49,685 --> 01:35:50,852
Hey!

1274
01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:53,561
Hey, stop!

1275
01:36:07,235 --> 01:36:08,612
Hey!

1276
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:16,615
Hey!

1277
01:36:18,076 --> 01:36:19,827
Why did you have to honk?

1278
01:36:19,952 --> 01:36:21,536
I honked, that wasn't wrong, ma'am.

1279
01:36:21,703 --> 01:36:23,912
It's just that I honked at the wrong guy.

1280
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:27,621
Drive faster, mister. - I'm doing my best.

1281
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,083
Hey!

1282
01:36:44,297 --> 01:36:47,341
My face was here.. His face was here.. - Okay.

1283
01:36:47,466 --> 01:36:49,259
I stopped breathing! - Oh, God!

1284
01:36:49,467 --> 01:36:52,094
I think, he has come in search of us.

1285
01:36:52,302 --> 01:36:54,179
We can tackle him when he comes.

1286
01:36:55,262 --> 01:36:56,555
What we need to do now is..

1287
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:07,478
I feel ashamed to go out in public.

1288
01:37:08,435 --> 01:37:12,896
Every passer-by questions me about our sons' wedding mockingly.

1289
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,106
Stop crying first.

1290
01:37:16,274 --> 01:37:17,817
You do have a point.

1291
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,484
What did we gain by giving importance to caste and creed

1292
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:25,112
and to the background?

1293
01:37:26,363 --> 01:37:28,239
That girl is quite good looking.

1294
01:37:29,823 --> 01:37:33,784
As you said, we can get Vanaroja married to Paramjothy.

1295
01:37:55,212 --> 01:37:57,296
Dad, Vanaroja is also here.

1296
01:38:00,215 --> 01:38:03,341
I've taken a decision regarding my eldest son's marriage.

1297
01:38:03,466 --> 01:38:05,050
You've been doing that for years now!

1298
01:38:05,176 --> 01:38:07,302
The wedding will be held on the next auspicious day.

1299
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:11,679
The girl is none other than Vanaroja.

1300
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,056
Hey! - What happened?

1301
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:17,724
How did you fall?

1302
01:38:17,849 --> 01:38:19,100
Whom did you ask before taking this decision?

1303
01:38:19,475 --> 01:38:20,851
Whom should I ask?

1304
01:38:21,393 --> 01:38:24,770
Well, dad, I meant, you could have asked that girl once..

1305
01:38:26,354 --> 01:38:28,396
We could've asked her relatives, if she had any.

1306
01:38:28,521 --> 01:38:29,855
She is an orphan.

1307
01:38:33,358 --> 01:38:34,650
What is there to ask her?

1308
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:40,569
I have decided that she is my eldest daughter-in-law.

1309
01:38:45,363 --> 01:38:49,366
Look at her! She ran away hiding her tears of joy.

1310
01:38:49,699 --> 01:38:50,992
Is it fine with you?

1311
01:38:52,534 --> 01:38:55,119
Bless me. - Get up.

1312
01:38:58,412 --> 01:39:00,163
There's no point hiding it any longer!

1313
01:39:00,372 --> 01:39:01,914
The problem is getting complicated by the day!

1314
01:39:02,039 --> 01:39:03,291
Will you tell them the truth or should I tell them?

1315
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:04,917
What I'm trying to say is.. - You've said enough!

1316
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:07,210
I'll tell them myself. - Wait.

1317
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:09,211
They can hear it even if I shout from here.

1318
01:39:09,793 --> 01:39:11,253
Even if I shout from here

1319
01:39:12,337 --> 01:39:13,505
they can hear it.

1320
01:39:15,963 --> 01:39:17,923
Even if I shout from here, they can hear it.

1321
01:39:20,466 --> 01:39:22,384
Even if I shout from here, they can hear it.

1322
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:54,109
"Your sweet gaze passes over me, like a gentle river."

1323
01:39:55,069 --> 01:39:58,738
"The surrounding is covered in mist."

1324
01:39:59,863 --> 01:40:04,490
"What do you seek?"

1325
01:40:04,783 --> 01:40:09,119
"Why the tussle every now and then?"

1326
01:40:09,534 --> 01:40:14,121
"The breeze overpowers the rain."

1327
01:40:14,246 --> 01:40:19,041
"Like light in a dark tunnel, you spread within me."

1328
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:23,918
"You'll bring about a new dawn."

1329
01:40:28,378 --> 01:40:37,800
"Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river."

1330
01:40:38,342 --> 01:40:42,261
"The surrounding is covered in mist."

1331
01:40:48,806 --> 01:40:58,061
"Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river."

1332
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,189
"The surrounding is covered in mist."

1333
01:41:03,314 --> 01:41:07,483
"What do you seek?"

1334
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:12,444
"Why the tussle every now and then?"

1335
01:41:12,944 --> 01:41:17,488
"The breeze overpowers the rain."

1336
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:22,366
"Like light in a dark tunnel, you spread within me."

1337
01:41:22,492 --> 01:41:27,703
"You'll bring about a new dawn."

1338
01:41:32,122 --> 01:41:41,002
"Your sweet gaze passes over me like a gentle river."

1339
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:45,630
"I'm yours."

1340
01:41:58,595 --> 01:42:00,429
Dad, forgive me.

1341
01:42:00,805 --> 01:42:03,222
Why are you asking for forgiveness, dear?

1342
01:42:04,097 --> 01:42:07,225
Just say once that you've forgiven me.

1343
01:42:08,891 --> 01:42:14,019
Vanaroja is none other than the girl I've married.

1344
01:42:23,442 --> 01:42:27,485
You think you're old enough to find a bride for yourself!

1345
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:30,779
Father-in-law.. - Get lost! Don't you dare call me that!

1346
01:42:41,827 --> 01:42:45,662
Telling dad might lead to something worse than the dream.

1347
01:42:46,412 --> 01:42:48,038
Mom is the correct person.

1348
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,997
Vanaroja!

1349
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:52,791
Vanaroja!

1350
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:58,961
Vanaroja! Vanaroja!

1351
01:43:04,422 --> 01:43:07,632
How is our classmate, Sekar, now? - Don't ask!

1352
01:43:08,425 --> 01:43:11,927
They went to a broker to seek an alliance for their daughter.

1353
01:43:12,176 --> 01:43:15,179
The broker turned out to be a crook. Ruthlessly

1354
01:43:16,261 --> 01:43:19,139
he showed him your photo.

1355
01:43:20,472 --> 01:43:22,807
Considering the age difference between you and that girl..

1356
01:43:24,182 --> 01:43:26,143
Anyway, there's a ceremony being held for my daughter.

1357
01:43:26,268 --> 01:43:27,810
You must attend. She has come of age.

1358
01:43:27,976 --> 01:43:30,353
I'll surely come! - Hello, sir. When did you come?

1359
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,355
Chinna Vandu, how are you? - I'm fine.

1360
01:43:33,771 --> 01:43:34,814
What's the invitation for?

1361
01:43:34,939 --> 01:43:36,606
There's a ceremony being held for my daughter.

1362
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:39,149
So, I came to invite my friend. You should also attend.

1363
01:43:39,274 --> 01:43:40,942
If you're my best friend, leave right away.

1364
01:43:41,068 --> 01:43:42,235
I surely am your best friend.

1365
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:46,195
You didn't come to invite me. Get going.

1366
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,779
I did come to invite you.

1367
01:43:48,947 --> 01:43:53,615
Don't turn around. Put the invitation in your bag and leave. - Why is he getting angry?

1368
01:44:01,244 --> 01:44:02,537
Vanaroja!

1369
01:44:05,413 --> 01:44:06,622
Come. Come.

1370
01:44:06,957 --> 01:44:08,291
Do you know who he is?

1371
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:11,293
He was my brother's classmate.

1372
01:44:11,417 --> 01:44:13,085
They studied together.

1373
01:44:14,252 --> 01:44:15,628
You'd want to know the purpose of his visit. - She didn't ask the purpose.

1374
01:44:15,752 --> 01:44:18,630
You may go. - Still, I must tell her. Wait.

1375
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:23,757
His classmate's daughter has come of age.

1376
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,967
He has come to invite us for the ceremony.

1377
01:44:27,717 --> 01:44:31,929
Isn't your daughter as old as her?

1378
01:44:32,054 --> 01:44:35,056
She looks much younger than my daughter.

1379
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:36,514
Exactly!

1380
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,849
Come out. I'll trample you.

1381
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:42,475
Who is that girl? - Ask him when he turns around.

1382
01:44:42,685 --> 01:44:46,312
What? What is the problem? - Who is that girl?

1383
01:44:47,938 --> 01:44:50,980
That girl? We have adopted that girl.

1384
01:44:51,855 --> 01:44:53,606
Nachiar lane is famous for lamps.

1385
01:44:53,731 --> 01:44:57,318
I've combed through the whole area. In fact, I'm checking nearby areas now.

1386
01:44:57,443 --> 01:45:01,862
The driver's face is still fresh in my mind.

1387
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:05,780
You shouldn't be searching for the lamp shop

1388
01:45:06,323 --> 01:45:07,823
but for the auto driver.

1389
01:45:08,282 --> 01:45:10,533
Before dad comes to know about it

1390
01:45:10,742 --> 01:45:12,493
we're fleeing from home for a week.

1391
01:45:12,618 --> 01:45:14,660
We'll return once dad has accepted it.

1392
01:45:19,037 --> 01:45:20,496
Mom! - What is it?

1393
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:26,542
Vanaroja.. - Vanaroja?

1394
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:30,086
Who is Vanaroja..

1395
01:45:30,211 --> 01:45:32,587
Don't be so ignorant!

1396
01:45:32,837 --> 01:45:35,297
Vanaroja is the eldest daughter-in-law of this house.

1397
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:38,172
Can you stop it at daughter-in-law?

1398
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:39,965
How should you treat your daughter-in-law?

1399
01:45:40,173 --> 01:45:41,509
Shouldn't she be treated like a queen? - Yes.

1400
01:45:41,634 --> 01:45:42,967
Can anybody live in that room?

1401
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:45,803
You love your sister-in-law so much.

1402
01:45:46,011 --> 01:45:48,804
Your brothers are so fortunate to have you!

1403
01:45:49,095 --> 01:45:51,388
My sons are the best!

1404
01:46:00,185 --> 01:46:02,437
Hail the powers that be!

1405
01:46:02,561 --> 01:46:04,145
It's a no moon day.

1406
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:07,148
You've been waiting for this no moon night.

1407
01:46:07,273 --> 01:46:10,358
As advised by the shaman, I'll smear the soot on her right thumb.

1408
01:46:10,483 --> 01:46:11,983
Praise the Goddess!

1409
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,990
I need to smear the soot on the right thumb.

1410
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:29,409
I need you to unload the sack of rice from the granary.

1411
01:46:29,534 --> 01:46:31,243
I need to smear soot. - What are you blabbering?

1412
01:46:31,411 --> 01:46:33,787
No, dad.. I meant, it's pitch dark.

1413
01:46:34,246 --> 01:46:35,621
Pitch dark?

1414
01:46:35,829 --> 01:46:38,456
Okay, we'll do it in the morning. - Okay, dad.

1415
01:46:51,337 --> 01:46:52,796
Apply it now.

1416
01:46:52,922 --> 01:46:55,381
The color will come out well.

1417
01:46:58,259 --> 01:47:01,426
That girl will fall for you the moment you smear the soot.

1418
01:47:01,551 --> 01:47:03,177
She'll nod her head to everything that you say.

1419
01:47:03,302 --> 01:47:05,011
Let me check once.

1420
01:47:05,387 --> 01:47:10,140
Vanaroja, did you eat?

1421
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:13,850
She's nodding her head, just as the shaman had predicted.

1422
01:47:13,975 --> 01:47:16,393
The soot's working. Now, instead of talking to her

1423
01:47:16,519 --> 01:47:18,395
I should talk to mom.

1424
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,645
Mom!

1425
01:47:25,148 --> 01:47:30,485
Mom, the secret that I'd hidden from the world all these days..

1426
01:47:30,609 --> 01:47:34,277
It's time to get that burden off my chest.

1427
01:47:34,944 --> 01:47:37,947
Your brother's problem was the biggest burden of our family.

1428
01:47:38,072 --> 01:47:41,407
We managed to get it off. You're next.

1429
01:47:41,573 --> 01:47:44,408
Get it off your chest. - I'll do it, mom.

1430
01:47:44,617 --> 01:47:48,328
Do you know who Vanaroja is?

1431
01:47:48,536 --> 01:47:50,746
She's my lover, mom. My lover!

1432
01:47:52,412 --> 01:47:55,789
We both are in love with each other.

1433
01:47:56,457 --> 01:48:00,168
She fell in love with me the day she entered the house.

1434
01:48:00,292 --> 01:48:02,335
Ask her if you want, she'll nod in agreement.

1435
01:48:02,918 --> 01:48:04,252
What do I ask?

1436
01:48:04,752 --> 01:48:06,378
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1437
01:48:06,837 --> 01:48:09,380
I kept quiet only because I didn't want

1438
01:48:09,506 --> 01:48:12,173
to reveal it before brother gets married.

1439
01:48:12,466 --> 01:48:16,718
But when you decided to get the same girl married to brother

1440
01:48:16,842 --> 01:48:19,927
I couldn't keep it a secret any longer.

1441
01:48:20,052 --> 01:48:21,512
How could I?

1442
01:48:23,805 --> 01:48:29,016
When your dad comes to know of this, he'll kill us all!

1443
01:48:29,141 --> 01:48:35,144
He'll kill us! - It's all about your husband, is it?

1444
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:37,688
You and your husband can decide whatever you want.

1445
01:48:37,813 --> 01:48:39,939
But you can't separate us.

1446
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,648
Why is he speaking my lines?

1447
01:48:42,899 --> 01:48:44,609
Ma'am, I've applied henna on this hand.

1448
01:48:44,734 --> 01:48:46,276
But I'm not able to apply it on this hand.

1449
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,527
Can you apply it for me? - Is this important now?

1450
01:48:48,778 --> 01:48:51,737
If he hid it, why didn't you speak up?

1451
01:48:52,613 --> 01:48:53,697
When I spoke about the eldest one's marriage

1452
01:48:53,822 --> 01:48:55,073
you could have told me, right?

1453
01:48:56,198 --> 01:48:57,324
He told you?

1454
01:48:57,908 --> 01:49:01,284
You both have been hiding a lot of things!

1455
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:05,954
Did he tell you everything? - Yes, he did.

1456
01:49:06,078 --> 01:49:07,787
Then bless me, ma'am.

1457
01:49:08,872 --> 01:49:11,498
That man might see us!

1458
01:49:11,622 --> 01:49:13,123
Hail the shaman!

1459
01:49:21,796 --> 01:49:28,091
"With a word, she stole my heart. With a glance, she killed me."

1460
01:49:28,216 --> 01:49:34,052
"Like water in a jug, I was trapped in her thoughts."

1461
01:49:34,176 --> 01:49:40,014
"Look at the river matching her moves with the breeze."

1462
01:49:40,139 --> 01:49:46,101
"The butterfly that got stuck to my shirt, sent my heart aflutter."

1463
01:49:46,225 --> 01:49:52,186
"I was fine when I went to her.. Something happened when she touched."

1464
01:50:03,068 --> 01:50:05,569
Stop crying. We'll take a house on rent.

1465
01:50:05,694 --> 01:50:06,737
You can stay there for a while.

1466
01:50:06,862 --> 01:50:09,947
I'll call Soori from Tirupur. He'll set everything right.

1467
01:50:11,698 --> 01:50:15,200
Hey.. Where is Chinna Vandu?

1468
01:50:15,324 --> 01:50:17,076
Vanaroja is also missing, mom.

1469
01:50:17,283 --> 01:50:19,243
Just to be on the safer side..

1470
01:50:20,453 --> 01:50:22,287
Mom believed brother Parandhaman's story.

1471
01:50:22,412 --> 01:50:25,329
I'll use that as an excuse to get the eldest brother married.

1472
01:50:26,206 --> 01:50:28,248
I'm trying my best

1473
01:50:28,373 --> 01:50:30,375
but nobody's willing to marry that buffalo.

1474
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,083
Okay, it's getting late. Get going, they might doubt us.

1475
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:34,042
I'll follow you. Go.

1476
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:46,759
I think the lamps fell down. - Yes. - Let's go and check.

1477
01:51:00,557 --> 01:51:04,185
Your father will kill us if he got to know about this.

1478
01:51:05,351 --> 01:51:07,019
Do I have to arrange it all again?

1479
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:11,772
I was the one who had arranged it all. Why are you saying 'again'? See, mom.

1480
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:15,358
How could it have fallen?

1481
01:51:16,024 --> 01:51:19,192
We have a stray cat roaming around all the time.

1482
01:51:57,922 --> 01:51:59,256
That's not possible.

1483
01:52:01,341 --> 01:52:02,675
Oh, a power cut!

1484
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:07,469
No need to do it now. We'll arrange it in the morning.

1485
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,387
Do as I say, mom.

1486
01:52:18,016 --> 01:52:20,350
Stop crying, mom.

1487
01:52:20,935 --> 01:52:22,353
When dad comes to know

1488
01:52:22,478 --> 01:52:24,104
about his love affair, he will kill you first.

1489
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,563
Oh, mom.. What do you want now?

1490
01:52:29,898 --> 01:52:32,565
Eldest brother's wedding needs to be called off somehow, right?

1491
01:52:32,774 --> 01:52:35,317
Till he gets married elsewhere, dad shouldn't come

1492
01:52:35,443 --> 01:52:36,902
to know about the second one's affair.

1493
01:52:37,027 --> 01:52:38,235
Okay? - Yes.

1494
01:52:38,569 --> 01:52:39,778
What?

1495
01:52:40,195 --> 01:52:44,323
Listen, it's my responsibility to stop brother Paramjothy's wedding.

1496
01:52:44,448 --> 01:52:46,449
Brother Parandhaman not going overboard with Vanaroja

1497
01:52:46,615 --> 01:52:49,658
is your responsibility. - But both of them are deeply in love with each other.

1498
01:52:51,827 --> 01:52:54,037
As if you know everything! - He told it to me himself.

1499
01:52:54,162 --> 01:52:55,329
Yeah, right!

1500
01:52:59,622 --> 01:53:01,164
Keep it.

1501
01:53:01,291 --> 01:53:03,292
501. - I get it.

1502
01:53:06,252 --> 01:53:07,877
Jupiter.. Uranus..

1503
01:53:09,587 --> 01:53:12,297
I forgot everything. I need to manage somehow.

1504
01:53:13,088 --> 01:53:14,213
What is this?

1505
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:24,552
I'm scared to even compare these two horoscopes.

1506
01:53:25,386 --> 01:53:27,512
They're so incompatible.

1507
01:53:27,637 --> 01:53:32,181
If you still go ahead with their marriage

1508
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:36,143
there will be a death in this house before the wedding takes place.

1509
01:53:38,351 --> 01:53:42,729
Good Lord, protect my husband!

1510
01:53:43,354 --> 01:53:48,107
Rather than letting dad die, let them not marry at all!

1511
01:53:49,524 --> 01:53:52,568
He didn't specify, it's me. It was a general comment.

1512
01:53:52,694 --> 01:53:54,361
Am I right, Astrologer?

1513
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:18,166
A petty horoscope destroyed my love!

1514
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:43,387
"New melodies shall rise"

1515
01:54:43,512 --> 01:54:48,056
"new emotions will awaken fresh like the blooming jasmine."

1516
01:54:49,099 --> 01:54:50,475
What's wrong with this girl?

1517
01:54:50,641 --> 01:54:52,768
Tell me. What is wrong with her?

1518
01:54:56,854 --> 01:54:58,771
What is wrong with this girl?

1519
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:09,485
Son, where are you going?

1520
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:10,986
To hang myself.

1521
01:55:11,528 --> 01:55:14,238
So, the astrologer's prediction is going to come true.

1522
01:55:14,822 --> 01:55:17,198
Before you go, can you please pass the curry?

1523
01:55:17,739 --> 01:55:22,701
The astrologer was talking about you. This girl is mine.

1524
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:37,126
Hello? Is it Ms. Sharada?

1525
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:39,085
No, I'm her daughter.

1526
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:40,461
Who is this?

1527
01:55:42,795 --> 01:55:45,047
I'm Paramjothy, the eldest son of Sambandham

1528
01:55:45,171 --> 01:55:47,630
the lamp shop owner from Kumbakonam.

1529
01:55:48,715 --> 01:55:51,842
I was shown your photo very late.

1530
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:56,761
I liked you the moment I saw you.

1531
01:55:56,886 --> 01:56:00,263
Oh, no! I'm already married.

1532
01:56:23,568 --> 01:56:27,195
Can't you be careful? - What do I say?

1533
01:56:27,319 --> 01:56:30,612
Bless me, dad! - You aren't getting married

1534
01:56:30,738 --> 01:56:32,614
to seek my blessings! - Wait and watch.

1535
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,283
Sir is missing his daughter a lot. He's just putting on a brave face.

1536
01:56:36,533 --> 01:56:39,326
I'm a little worried about the groom's family.

1537
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:42,620
The Almighty will lead us to her.

1538
01:56:43,912 --> 01:56:46,372
I'm tired from all the traveling. I'm feeling sleepy. Hang up.

1539
01:56:46,704 --> 01:56:47,831
Hang up.

1540
01:56:47,956 --> 01:56:49,207
I'm sleepy. Hang up.

1541
01:56:54,835 --> 01:56:58,377
Gold prices soar.

1542
01:57:05,716 --> 01:57:10,135
It's blinding! I've seen this bald head before.

1543
01:57:11,926 --> 01:57:13,261
Let me get a closer look.

1544
01:57:15,262 --> 01:57:17,639
A gold broom to sweep the toilet!

1545
01:57:18,890 --> 01:57:22,475
It must be at least ten grams.

1546
01:57:35,649 --> 01:57:37,358
Please cooperate a bit.

1547
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,859
Darn, my finger!

1548
01:57:54,951 --> 01:57:56,743
Hey, stop!

1549
01:57:56,868 --> 01:57:58,536
He stole my tooth! Nab him!

1550
01:57:58,661 --> 01:58:01,663
Hey, stop! - Will a thief ever stop on request?

1551
01:58:01,997 --> 01:58:03,079
Hey!

1552
01:58:08,332 --> 01:58:11,167
Give me my tooth.

1553
01:58:16,587 --> 01:58:19,338
Give me back my gold tooth. Gold is expensive.

1554
01:58:19,463 --> 01:58:21,631
Return my gold tooth!

1555
01:58:21,756 --> 01:58:23,174
Give it back! You thief!

1556
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:25,634
You're gonna stop.

1557
01:58:26,217 --> 01:58:28,552
He didn't! My tooth!

1558
01:58:28,677 --> 01:58:30,595
I'm not going to give up.

1559
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,054
Hey, give it back!

1560
01:58:35,265 --> 01:58:37,599
Where do I find a pawn shop in this area?

1561
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:41,184
God! It's burning.

1562
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:49,313
Gold shop..

1563
01:58:51,981 --> 01:58:55,234
Oh, no! You fell down and broke your tooth!

1564
01:58:55,609 --> 01:58:59,570
It's a gold tooth, dear. Please give it to that person.

1565
01:58:59,735 --> 01:59:02,820
Whatever tooth it is, don't worry.. Don't get scared.

1566
01:59:02,945 --> 01:59:06,364
What are you going to do? - I'll take the dung.. - Kid!

1567
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:09,699
I'll bury the tooth in the dung and throw it over the roof.

1568
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,284
Your tooth will grow back. - Kid!

1569
01:59:12,409 --> 01:59:16,037
It's a gold tooth!

1570
01:59:17,537 --> 01:59:22,998
The gold tooth is in the dung, catch it!

1571
01:59:37,798 --> 01:59:40,300
Super catch! - Darn it!

1572
01:59:40,509 --> 01:59:42,176
Why are you chatting in the middle of the road?

1573
01:59:42,301 --> 01:59:43,760
Find a corner to sit and chat, or else I'll break your teeth.

1574
01:59:43,886 --> 01:59:46,345
It's already broken. Get going, sir!

1575
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,721
Go on!

1576
01:59:49,096 --> 01:59:50,221
Hey! - What?

1577
01:59:50,346 --> 01:59:51,680
The tooth is missing. Where is it?

1578
01:59:51,806 --> 01:59:54,307
Search well. It's in it.

1579
01:59:54,515 --> 01:59:58,684
That's a rotten tooth, where's the gold one?

1580
02:00:00,603 --> 02:00:03,895
That's my tooth. Where's your gold tooth?

1581
02:00:04,021 --> 02:00:07,564
Are you asking me? I'll slaughter you!

1582
02:00:07,774 --> 02:00:09,066
I'm coming!

1583
02:00:34,204 --> 02:00:37,331
The auspicious time is between 9:15 a.m. and 10:15 a.m., tomorrow.

1584
02:00:37,456 --> 02:00:38,748
You can give me the advance today. - Okay, sir.

1585
02:00:38,873 --> 02:00:40,041
You can perform the housewarming ceremony tomorrow.

1586
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:41,917
Thanks, sir. - See you. - Bye.

1587
02:00:43,752 --> 02:00:47,754
If I go home now, dad will scold me for not working on the order.

1588
02:00:49,296 --> 02:00:52,215
I've given the money to Vanaroja, take it from her.

1589
02:00:52,715 --> 02:00:54,341
Okay. - Get going. - See you later.

1590
02:00:54,466 --> 02:00:55,633
Hey! - What?

1591
02:00:56,175 --> 02:00:58,092
He'll enquire about me if you take the bike.

1592
02:00:58,217 --> 02:00:59,426
Take an auto.

1593
02:01:36,447 --> 02:01:39,739
Congratulations! You're going to be a grandpa.

1594
02:01:40,282 --> 02:01:42,033
And you're going to be a grandma.

1595
02:01:43,283 --> 02:01:47,286
No! I don't charge a fee for such good things.

1596
02:01:47,703 --> 02:01:50,496
By the way, she'll remain like this for 10 minutes.

1597
02:01:50,662 --> 02:01:53,580
She will recover by herself, so don't disturb her.

1598
02:01:56,041 --> 02:01:57,792
He told me that the soot will make her fall for me

1599
02:01:57,917 --> 02:02:00,002
but he didn't mention anything about the pregnancy.

1600
02:02:07,796 --> 02:02:11,257
Enough of your work! Stop the machine!

1601
02:02:11,507 --> 02:02:13,550
Look at what you've done!

1602
02:02:13,967 --> 02:02:16,094
Looking at you getting all decked up, I realized something will go wrong for sure!

1603
02:02:16,219 --> 02:02:18,220
Stop it, dad.

1604
02:02:18,345 --> 02:02:21,430
I haven't touched that girl except when I had smeared the soot on her finger.

1605
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:26,056
I knew it when you were applying that fairness cream!

1606
02:02:26,515 --> 02:02:28,516
Dad! - What?

1607
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:31,144
Dad, it's not me.

1608
02:02:31,519 --> 02:02:32,603
Dad!

1609
02:02:34,645 --> 02:02:36,854
Ask Chinna Vandu once as well.

1610
02:02:36,979 --> 02:02:41,982
He is as naive as a cow!

1611
02:02:42,565 --> 02:02:44,568
I know that you are responsible for her pregnancy.

1612
02:02:44,693 --> 02:02:46,068
Swear by this if that's not true.

1613
02:02:46,193 --> 02:02:47,903
Not just on this burning camphor, mom

1614
02:02:48,028 --> 02:02:49,612
I'll even swear by the burning stove.

1615
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:52,739
He simply said that he'll swear by the burning stove.

1616
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,990
I'll do it, mom.

1617
02:03:11,582 --> 02:03:13,000
Vanaroja!

1618
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:16,542
Vanaroja!

1619
02:03:19,545 --> 02:03:20,712
Vanaroj..

1620
02:03:28,216 --> 02:03:30,176
Vanaroja!

1621
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:36,429
Get up.. We've found a house.

1622
02:03:39,014 --> 02:03:40,722
Hi, Mr. Sambandham!

1623
02:03:42,724 --> 02:03:43,725
Mr. Sambandham..

1624
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:46,685
This scoundrel is responsible for everything!

1625
02:03:47,018 --> 02:03:49,185
And you were doubting my sons!

1626
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:51,186
Why aren't you thrashing him to death?

1627
02:03:52,438 --> 02:03:57,524
You elope with someone, bring her home and make me doubt my own sons!

1628
02:03:57,649 --> 02:03:58,691
Mr. Sambandham!

1629
02:03:58,983 --> 02:04:01,985
Rascal! - No.

1630
02:04:02,109 --> 02:04:04,944
You rascal! Criminal!

1631
02:04:05,112 --> 02:04:09,530
Who do you think you are fooling? Do we look like idiots to you!

1632
02:04:09,697 --> 02:04:10,864
Father-in-law!

1633
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:16,408
Don't! Please.. - Get out!

1634
02:04:17,618 --> 02:04:20,162
Father-in-law! - What? Father-in-law?

1635
02:04:20,412 --> 02:04:22,288
Are you both trying to fool us!

1636
02:04:22,412 --> 02:04:26,372
Get lost! Throw her out!

1637
02:04:26,497 --> 02:04:28,165
Mr. Sambandham!

1638
02:04:35,627 --> 02:04:36,670
Sir!

1639
02:04:36,796 --> 02:04:38,046
Who are you, sir?

1640
02:04:38,171 --> 02:04:40,631
Let her go, sir. - Get lost!

1641
02:04:41,047 --> 02:04:42,381
I'll escape.

1642
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:45,259
Sir! - Leave her, son. Listen to me.

1643
02:04:45,384 --> 02:04:48,010
She is pregnant. Spare her.

1644
02:04:48,801 --> 02:04:49,885
Listen.

1645
02:04:50,011 --> 02:04:53,471
I'm begging you. Please don't..

1646
02:04:53,595 --> 02:04:54,763
Hey!

1647
02:04:58,306 --> 02:05:00,266
Listen to me please, son.

1648
02:05:02,935 --> 02:05:06,187
My wife died soon after my daughter was born.

1649
02:05:07,311 --> 02:05:09,021
She is the only reason I'm alive.

1650
02:05:09,854 --> 02:05:12,648
She's pregnant, don't harm her.

1651
02:05:14,274 --> 02:05:16,192
I'll apologies to you for her mistake.

1652
02:05:16,317 --> 02:05:17,900
Sir! - Dad!

1653
02:05:18,025 --> 02:05:19,234
Sir! - Forgive her.

1654
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,153
Dad! - Please don't harm her.

1655
02:05:21,862 --> 02:05:24,989
Sir.. Get up.. - Dad! - Leave her!

1656
02:05:25,113 --> 02:05:26,447
Listen to me! - Son..

1657
02:05:28,657 --> 02:05:30,115
Let her go.

1658
02:05:30,658 --> 02:05:31,784
Get her in.

1659
02:05:31,992 --> 02:05:36,537
Hey, let her go!

1660
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:39,121
Hey, spare her!

1661
02:05:45,207 --> 02:05:47,333
Buddy..

1662
02:06:45,323 --> 02:06:48,283
Before the traffic signal countdown reduces from 30 to 20

1663
02:06:48,408 --> 02:06:51,827
if two people honk at once, you'll see me.

1664
02:07:43,939 --> 02:07:45,231
Maniac!

1665
02:07:46,024 --> 02:07:47,983
Are you out of your mind?

1666
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:49,900
Is this how you drive? Take a reverse!

1667
02:07:50,068 --> 02:07:51,777
Hey, auto! Go back.

1668
02:07:51,902 --> 02:07:55,695
Come forward. Move the bike. Should I tell you separately? Move.

1669
02:08:12,622 --> 02:08:15,624
Get going.. Hurry up!

1670
02:09:09,403 --> 02:09:10,445
Boss!

1671
02:09:10,862 --> 02:09:13,654
Boss, the girl has fainted.

1672
02:09:15,905 --> 02:09:17,157
Remove the cloth.

1673
02:09:33,957 --> 02:09:35,916
Boss, I guess the one who is following us is him.

1674
02:09:42,253 --> 02:09:43,880
Turn the vehicle. Get it off the road.

1675
02:10:57,378 --> 02:10:58,462
Hey!

1676
02:13:27,586 --> 02:13:30,378
Why are you crying, dear? I am there for you.

1677
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:35,047
If you cry, I'm going to cry too.

1678
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:37,925
You shouldn't cry when you're pregnant.

1679
02:13:38,132 --> 02:13:39,341
It isn't good for the baby.

1680
02:13:39,841 --> 02:13:41,050
What do you want now?

1681
02:13:41,551 --> 02:13:43,927
You want me to deal with dad about the pregnancy issue.

1682
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:46,387
Isn't it? All right, I'll take care.

1683
02:13:46,512 --> 02:13:47,721
Why are you crying?

1684
02:13:53,807 --> 02:13:54,975
Hey!

1685
02:14:10,734 --> 02:14:15,779
Ask Chinna Vandu once, dad. - He's as naive as a cow!

1686
02:14:15,904 --> 02:14:17,446
A cow!

1687
02:14:24,449 --> 02:14:32,704
"Alas! He nurtured you as a brother."

1688
02:14:50,756 --> 02:14:58,010
"He took the pain to provide comfort to your legs."

1689
02:14:58,135 --> 02:15:02,596
"A land where loyalty is limited to dogs!"

1690
02:15:03,262 --> 02:15:10,141
"You've no one here who's yours, no path you can claim.. "

1691
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:14,685
Forgive me, dad. - Forgive what?

1692
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:18,313
You ruined the life of an orphan who came to work for us!

1693
02:15:18,438 --> 02:15:19,646
Father-in-law!

1694
02:15:23,024 --> 02:15:24,566
She's not an orphan, dad.

1695
02:15:25,649 --> 02:15:27,442
I've married her.

1696
02:15:32,612 --> 02:15:33,820
Love.

1697
02:15:34,363 --> 02:15:36,405
Her marriage was fixed elsewhere

1698
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:38,948
and so, the situation demanded us to get married immediately.

1699
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:40,867
So, we got married.

1700
02:15:41,658 --> 02:15:45,411
I told Soori to get her a job at our place.

1701
02:15:46,537 --> 02:15:49,163
If anyone finds out that I got married before my elder brothers did

1702
02:15:49,579 --> 02:15:53,664
nobody will offer them a bride. So, we hid it.

1703
02:15:56,751 --> 02:15:59,460
I don't want to listen to anything you say.

1704
02:16:00,127 --> 02:16:02,254
Take the girl and get out of here.

1705
02:16:02,712 --> 02:16:07,006
Your forefathers haven't earned all this wealth.

1706
02:16:07,131 --> 02:16:08,715
I've earned it all.

1707
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:10,967
You won't get a penny out of it. Get lost!

1708
02:16:11,091 --> 02:16:12,216
Wealth?

1709
02:16:12,884 --> 02:16:15,551
Seven lamps and four pots! You call that wealth?

1710
02:16:15,677 --> 02:16:17,177
You don't want to give that to my son-in-law?

1711
02:16:17,845 --> 02:16:20,512
I've built a wedding hall for my daughter's wedding.

1712
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:23,431
My daughter is the sole heir to my property which is worth millions.

1713
02:16:28,143 --> 02:16:29,518
Sorry, dad.

1714
02:16:31,895 --> 02:16:33,604
Don't talk about wealth!

1715
02:16:34,313 --> 02:16:36,647
Son-in-law, bring her along. Let's go home.

1716
02:16:36,772 --> 02:16:38,273
We are not coming. We will manage.

1717
02:16:38,481 --> 02:16:39,648
Then?

1718
02:16:41,316 --> 02:16:43,650
Is my daughter destined to suffer like this?

1719
02:16:44,402 --> 02:16:46,403
Let him take his time to decide. You come along.

1720
02:16:46,528 --> 02:16:48,444
No, dad! - Come.

1721
02:16:48,654 --> 02:16:50,655
I said, come. I'm telling you.

1722
02:16:55,407 --> 02:16:56,699
Come.

1723
02:17:00,994 --> 02:17:05,163
Hey, millionaire! You can take your daughter along

1724

My daughter's happiness is all that I care for.

1731
02:17:57,274 --> 02:18:01,359
If she is happy staying here, I'll let her stay here.

"New melodies shall rise"

1733
02:18:08,197 --> 02:18:12,407
"new emotions will awaken fresh like the blooming jasmine."

"What a family! An abode of wisdom!"

1739
02:18:59,475 --> 02:19:05,604
"Laced with love, bound by affection! Long live!"

1740
02:19:05,728 --> 02:19:07,354
Game begins.

1741
02:19:11,898 --> 02:19:15,150
"Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping"

1742
02:19:15,275 --> 02:19:17,777
"my heart skips a beat!"

1743
02:19:18,736 --> 02:19:21,738
"If you think of crossing limits, I'm very, very sorry."

1744
02:19:21,862 --> 02:19:23,779
"She will make mincemeat out of you."

1745
02:19:25,198 --> 02:19:28,450
"Seeing this doll hugging a teddy bear while sleeping"

1746

"She will make mincemeat out of you."

1749
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:44,333
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1750
02:19:44,833 --> 02:19:51,212
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1751
02:19:58,256 --> 02:20:01,550
"Look at the lady for a while"

1752
02:20:01,675 --> 02:20:03,760
"and you'll be mailed the fever of love."

1753
02:20:04,677 --> 02:20:08,137
"Thinking yourself to be a man, if you try getting too close to her"

1754
02:20:08,263 --> 02:20:10,347
"she'll send you back in an ambulance."

1755
02:20:11,264 --> 02:20:17,684
"Crows can turn into peacocks, hormones weaken over time."

1756

02:20:40,572 --> 02:20:43,865
"Her name stuck to my heart real quick."

1759
02:20:44,324 --> 02:20:47,243
"Cooker, cooker, she's a hot cooker."

1760
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:50,535
"My heart refuses to forget her."

1761
02:20:50,661 --> 02:20:54,120
"Her words taste like candy."

1762
02:20:54,245 --> 02:20:57,164
"Her body, a bottle of honey."

1763
02:20:57,415 --> 02:21:00,833
"Her costume, colorful like a lollipop."
