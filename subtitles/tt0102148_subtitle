1
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,113
Whose act is this?

2
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,627
Who dared to break the
rule of this mansion?

3
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,265
Shakti.
- Yes, madam?

4
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:37,433
We'll be damned!

5
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,704
l am warning the last time.

6
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,432
Whoever has made the mistake
come forward and admit it.

7
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,577
Or l will shoot all of you dead.

8
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,872
lt was my mistake.
Please have mercy.

9
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,146
Get up.

10
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:56,211
Kanaklata,- Yes, madam.
- Slap your husband hard.

11
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,189
Not once, twice.

12
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,359
lf he forgets one, he
will remember the other.

13
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:04,858
Slap him.
- Bravo!

14
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,428
This slap from your wife
will always remind you..

15
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,327
..the consequence of breaking
the rules of this mansion.

16
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:13,805
Go away.

17
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:25,150
Mummy. - Yes.
- I am ready.

18
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,549
Oh, that's very good.

19
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,551
Take care of yourself. And
don't watch too many films.

20
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,282
You are talking of films?

21
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,552
l don't know the name
of any film stars.

22
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:39,688
l even stop my friends
from watching films.

23
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,657
l sit in my room all day.
- Oh, that's very good.

24
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:47,571
ln Rekha's presence, even madam
behaves like a baby. - Shut up.

25
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,733
Yes madam. l'll shut-up.
You are right, l am wrong.

26
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,181
Mummy, l don't feel like
leaving you and going away.

27
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:59,776
lf l could, l'd ask the
professor of medical college..

28
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,586
..to come and tutor you at home.

29
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:03,117
But the problem is..

30
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,157
..that the medical college
is in Bombay, not here.

31
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,121
l am going because
you want me to go.

32
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,356
But whenever l feel like
meeting you, l'll come over.

33
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:14,495
Don't worry, dear. l won't
let you have any problems.

34
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,659
Our driver will always
be waiting there..

35
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,829
with the Mercedes
Benz and Contessa.

36
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:21,465
lf one breaks down,
come in the other.

37
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,132
You are absolutely right

38
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,106
Get Rekha married to two men.

39
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,338
lf one falls sick, the
other will come in handy.

40
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,378
Excuse me. l'll give the
refuse to the garbage collector.

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,452
Bye baby.

42
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,453
What are you two
standing here and doing?

43
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,322
You should have been
at the factory by now.

44
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,258
I was about to leave, mummy.
- Even l am going.

45
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,527
Even l've to go for an important
meeting. Rekha, you leave.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Do call as soon as you reach.
- Yes, mummy.

47
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,394
Bye.
- Bye.

48
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:57,171
Whenever Rekha
returns from home,..

49
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,638
..it seems she is coming
straight out of another era.

50
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,511
She is an only daughter.

51
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,277
Her mother expresses her
love through all the jewelry..

52
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,717
..she loads her with.

53
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:11,347
But our Rekha is not like that.
She is scared of her mother.

54
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,091
That is why she cannot
refuse her mother.

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,160
Nonsense! She fibs.

56
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,159
Shut-up! Stop your nonsense!

57
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,666
Alright, tell me, did any English
film get released in my absence?

58
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,134
We'll send the watchman
to get the tickets.

59
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,672
Durgeshwari's daughter
will book only a few seats?

60
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:32,211
What will people say? Why don't
you get the entire hall booked?

61
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:32,869
Shut up.

62
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,774
Rekha, we have to
go to college today.

63
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,843
What college?

64
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:42,621
l have come here only to fulfill
Mrs. Durgeshwari's wishes..

65
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,715
..and therefore,
have to kill time.

66
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,286
Who wants lectures of boring
professors in boring classrooms?

67
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,189
Please don't forget..

68
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,198
my sister is getting
married day after tomorrow.

69
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,161
Oh yes!

70
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,149
Garland the groom, dear.

71
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,676
Hey mister! You cannot do this.

72
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,743
We have arrested a few people.

73
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,547
ldentify if any of
them is the one..

74
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,657
..who kidnapped
your friend's sister.

75
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:47,150
Speak!..speak..speak!

76
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,487
Speak!
- No!

77
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,192
No!

78
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,925
Since three days you are
telling me the same thing.

79
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,735
That he is not speaking.

80
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,171
lf you cannot
handle him, tell me.

81
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,508
l'll ask my mummy
to call the lG.

82
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,476
Then he will blurt out
everything in three minutes.

83
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,510
lf you don't believe us,
come and see for yourself.

84
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,551
Beating him brought tears to
my eyes, but he didn't budge.

85
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:16,548
He is a strange man.

86
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,622
Or with such thrashing, even
a stone would speak up by now.

87
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:20,689
Just see.

88
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,159
Come on.

89
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:25,627
Get up!

90
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,263
Speak!

91
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,537
Come...there is no
need to be afraid.

92
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:35,704
Lalita.

93
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,172
Where were you for so many days?

94
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,311
Where was this
cruel man hiding you?

95
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,282
l'll have him hanged!

96
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,647
Will you speak?
- No!

97
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,784
lnspector, he didn't kidnap me.

98
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,289
l got myself kidnapped.

99
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:07,439
l and Shankar loved each other.

100
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:11,304
But our parents were
against our alliance.

101
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:16,638
Without consent, my parents fixed
my marriage with someone else.

102
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,148
Raja is my friends.

103
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,648
He did this to get us married.

104
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,287
So why didn't he tell me?

105
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,383
And even you are
coming after 3 days.

106
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:28,385
Where were you for 3 days?
- I became an adult only yesterday.

107
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:33,722
We have just got married
in the Registrar's office.

108
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,890
Please release him.

109
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,199
Okay.

110
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,401
Madam, you don't have
to go to the lG now.

111
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,331
Please take back your complaint.

112
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:45,571
Yes.

113
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:57,654
Even my own brother
wouldn't do so much for me.

114
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,858
Raja, you mean more
to me than a brother.

115
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,627
We will never
forget this favour.

116
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,864
Give us your blessings.

117
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:10,599
l didn't do you any favour.

118
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:15,765
lt is said that you shouldn't
hesitate to lie to unite two hearts.

119
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:18,776
l only took a little
thrashing for your marriage.

120
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,210
To tell you the truth..

121
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,112
one needs more courage
to lie than to get beaten.

122
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:27,843
Now stop crying. These
are your days to enjoy.

123
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,685
What else can l ask for other
than a happy married life for you

124
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,155
Come, friend.

125
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,383
Bye, inspector.

126
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:40,197
What are you waiting for?
Go and congratulate them.

127
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,458
Let's go! Mister..

128
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:51,503
Wait, brother.

129
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,211
Just a second!

130
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:05,086
They beat me a lot.

131
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:07,857
Partner! - What?

132
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,153
you will continue to scream..

133
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,129
..and l will continue to
give you a hot massage.

134
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,496
The hot massage
will not help you.

135
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,867
l have a very good
cure for your pain.

136
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,134
Mix it with water and drink.

137
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,269
You will start
flying like Superman.

138
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:30,608
People will queue up
to take a ride on you.

139
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,616
Just try it.

140
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,713
Then why are you wasting
time since so long.

141
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,121
Get the medicine quickly.

142
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:42,252
l can get it for you,
but you will beat me.

143
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:46,826
Stupid fellow! Who beats
a man who gives medicine?

144
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,828
One doesn't, but l
fear you will beat me.

145
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,269
I won't. Get the medicine.
- First promise me.

146
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,897
l promise l won't.

147
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:59,167
100% sure? - Are you
going or not! - I'm going.

148
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,285
My leg!

149
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,849
Hurry up, Paltu.

150
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:25,103
Thank you.
- Welcome.

151
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,236
Liquor?

152
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,302
Sir! - Yes.

153
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:35,136
ls this medicine or Rum?

154
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:36,707
Let me check...

155
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,877
This is Rum.

156
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,546
English tonic.

157
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:47,215
Paltu, l'll beat you
so much that you will..

158
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,261
Not the shoes!
- Aah!

159
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:53,693
Your pain is increasing.

160
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,201
Drink! Drink my partner.

161
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,262
Close your nose like
a kid and drink it.

162
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,431
Drink...a little more.

163
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,339
Drink...

164
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:07,701
Take it easy.

165
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,580
Have one more drink.
- No, not any more.

166
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:14,279
Drink one more
for my friendship.

167
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,253
Drink it! Drink it!
Drink it! Wonderful!

168
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,187
Where is the glass?

169
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:33,603
Where is my third dose?
- Third dose?

170
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,498
Give me. Give me please!

171
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,837
No, you should not drink
more than two doses.

172
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,703
The doctor has forbidden.
- Which doctor, Paltu?

173
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:42,748
Dr. Brandy.

174
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,179
You stupid.

175
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,175
Two doses were for my body.

176
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,778
l want the third
dose for my heart.

177
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,114
Steady! Steady!

178
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,718
Don't move.

179
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,422
Don't move.

180
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,069
Rekha.

181
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:12,637
Rekha?

182
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:16,643
But who is Rekha?
- You are Rekha.

183
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,080
You are drunk.
- I am drunk?

184
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:20,419
Very good.

185
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:24,417
lt was you who was acting
smart in the police station.

186
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,249
What have l done to you?

187
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:32,229
What have you done? You touched
my nose with your finger.

188
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,456
And you ask what you have done?

189
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,195
l am Paltu, your friend.

190
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,470
You got me thrashed
in the police station.

191
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,233
Now you say you are my friend?

192
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,338
I'll teach you a lesson.
- What are you doing!

193
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:52,444
Don't look at me like that,
you scare me. l'm a virgin.

194
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:56,415
Virgin? What is your address?

195
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,485
Palton road.
- Where in Palton road?

196
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,683
ln the girl's hostel.

197
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,791
Room no?
- 22. - 22.

198
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:09,324
'Enter cautiously
in the garden.'

199
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,797
This is difficult.

200
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,758
Come on climb up! Climb up!

201
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,878
Steady. Steady! Steady!

202
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,110
Hello Rekha! Ms. Rekha!

203
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,719
Miss Rekha!

204
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,552
Do you recognize me?

205
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:09,422
You don't? You only recognise
me in the police station?

206
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,460
What do you think of yourself?

207
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:16,158
You put your finger
on my only nose?

208
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,231
Where is my nose? lt is here.

209
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,097
My one and only nose?

210
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:26,442
But what was my fault?

211
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:31,081
That l saved a poor girl's life?

212
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:35,676
Me saving life. You taking life?

213
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,288
You get me beaten
from the police?

214
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:44,492
No! - Who do you
think l am? A ruffian?

215
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:46,798
A goon?

216
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,530
Hold this baton.

217
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:53,433
l am double M.A. Two M.A.

218
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,471
Gold medal..

219
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,339
My gold medal is lying at home.

220
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:06,409
l fear my hunger
may make me sell it.

221
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,579
l'm hungry, double M.A.

222
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,780
Partner! - Yes, Paltu.

223
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:18,529
l've always wished to see a
beautiful face early morning.

224
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:20,764
Look, she is standing there.

225
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,631
She's room number 22.
- Why are you scared?

226
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,607
She will call the police again,
and make us queue with criminals.

227
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,680
She'll point her finger
at your only nose.

228
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,479
She will have us beaten.
Doesn't she go to college?

229
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:41,747
We have taken the beatings
we had to from the police.

230
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,287
What difference does
a few baton hits make?

231
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,720
And then, we have Rum! We
will drink it and escape.

232
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,460
Why have you come here?

233
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:58,795
lf you want to
complain to the police..

234
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,566
about last night's incident..

235
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,567
and have us arrested..

236
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,575
..we are not going to be
afraid. Right, partner?

237
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:07,441
Because we have developed
tough skins by now.

238
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:08,707
You can lodge a complaint.

239
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:12,148
I want to tell you something.
- Say it fast.

240
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,117
l love you.

241
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,483
Paltu, congratulations.

242
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,150
This girl has fallen for you.

243
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,455
She's crazy about you.
Congratulations, Paltu.

244
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:24,788
Thank you very much.

245
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,322
This has happened
to me several times.

246
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,761
Listen! - Yes.

247
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,829
l was telling you.

248
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,396
This has also happened
to me several times.

249
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,765
Now you stay here, l am leaving.

250
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:38,174
l know.

251
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:40,606
l am not so innocent.

252
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,211
But what did you find
so appealing about me..

253
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,715
..that you fell in love with me?

254
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,250
You don't even know me.

255
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:49,211
l saw how brave you are..

256
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,823
..when you came to the
marriage ceremony that day.

257
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,852
l saw how determined you are..

258
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:59,691
..when the police beat you
up, yet you stayed silent.

259
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:06,366
l saw your golden heart
when you united two lovers.

260
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:11,270
One who has a golden heart,
is brave and determined..

261
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,374
..who took every risk
and barged into my room..

262
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:16,647
..and then never left my heart.

263
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,682
He settled in my every
moment, sleeping, or awake.

264
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,585
Thank you.

265
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:25,556
l was pleased to hear all this.

266
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,553
But what you know
about me is very little.

267
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,486
You don't know a lot about me.

268
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:36,193
l am unemployed, and come
from a simple, poor family.

269
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,760
l have many responsibilities.

270
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:43,299
l stay atleast a
furlong away from love.

271
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:47,408
You misunderstand me.
- Please don't say any more.

272
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,708
For now, l can only
love a job, not you.

273
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,509
l am getting late for my
interview. l'll be going.

274
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:55,553
Good bye.

275
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:17,307
Tea!
- Paltu, get in!

276
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,323
Why are you standing
here? Get in! Get in!

277
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:44,626
Get in!

278
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,214
The weather is bad today. We'll
go for the interview tomorrow.

279
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,512
You waited outside my
house for seven days.

280
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,844
Whether day or night, sunshine
or rain, you don't care.

281
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,819
That is why l am forced
to ask you what you want.

282
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,188
l love you.

283
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,290
That's an old
story. Anything else?

284
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,291
l love you.

285
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,821
Don't you know any other
dialogue other than this?

286
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,132
Don't you watch films?
Please say something else.

287
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:49,892
l love you.

288
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,158
Oh God!

289
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,801
Your record has got stuck.
Say what you have to soon.

290
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:56,272
Or l'm leaving.
- Look..

291
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:59,304
l have been looking
for a whole seven days.

292
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,306
l truly love you.

293
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:04,108
And l can do anything
to prove that l love you.

294
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,752
You can do anything for me, but
l cannot do anything for you.

295
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,184
You are a rich girl,
but l am a poor guy.

296
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:13,087
Rs.25 may mean just
a lipstick for you..

297
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,559
..but for me, Rs.25 means
meals for three days.

298
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:17,126
We are poles apart.

299
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,489
The way two poles cannot meet,
rich and poor cannot unite..

300
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,827
..likewise, even
we cannot unite.

301
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,530
But it's not my fault if l
was born in a rich family.

302
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,736
Alright, l will leave
everything for you.

303
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,335
Will you accept me then?

304
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:33,144
Please leave me alone.

305
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,146
l'm getting a headache
hearing your talks.

306
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:36,305
Forget about me.

307
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,846
Then tell me what l
should do to forget you.

308
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,813
Climb this parapet and
jump into the water.

309
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,085
Rekha!

310
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,326
Rekha! Rekha!

311
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,525
Why did you save me?

312
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,623
Leave me.

313
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,134
l will never trouble you again.

314
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:37,631
l don't know whether to
thank you for saving me..

315
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,204
..or regret for being alive.

316
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:52,881
l love you.

317
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,853
But l am not
worthy of your love.

318
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:57,292
l love you.

319
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,761
Don't you know
any other dialogue?

320
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,627
l love you. - Don't
you watch films?

321
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,093
Or is your record stuck?

322
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:06,298
l love you. - Only
saying it won't work.

323
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:56,417
l have fallen in love

324
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,190
And so have you

325
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:03,489
l have fallen in love

326
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,720
And so have you

327
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:11,093
Accept this and meet my eyes

328
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:15,333
Come close and
reside in my heart

329
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:19,705
Accept this and meet my eyes

330
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:24,308
Come close and
reside in my heart

331
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:30,450
l have fallen in love

332
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,190
And so have you

333
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,522
l have fallen in love

334
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:40,121
And so have you

335
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:44,761
Accept this and meet my eyes

336
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:49,299
Come close and
reside in my heart

337
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:53,644
Accept this and meet my eyes

338
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,548
Come close and
reside in my heart

339
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:02,581
l have fallen in love

340
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:30,845
l have conceded my heart's
desire, whether you do or don't

341
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:35,109
l know what it is to be in a
trance, whether you do or don't

342
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:39,854
l have conceded my heart's
desire, whether you do or don't

343
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:44,085
l know what it is to be in a
trance, whether you do or don't

344
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:48,833
We will dream at night,
and be lost in those dreams

345
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:52,502
We will be termed
crazy wherever we go

346
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:56,530
l have fallen in love

347
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:59,268
And so have you

348
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:04,306
Accept this.
- And meet my eyes

349
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:08,546
Come close. - And
reside in my heart

350
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,316
Accept this and meet my eyes

351
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:17,623
Come close and
reside in my heart

352
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,499
l have fallen in love..

353
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:06,806
We have given consent,
so why fear now

354
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:10,814
We have admitted we love
each other, why fear now

355
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:15,614
We have given consent,
so why fear now

356
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,713
We have admitted we love
each other, why fear now

357
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:24,489
Nothing will be
able to stop us now

358
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:28,329
Let anything happen, we
will give up our lives

359
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,430
l have fallen in love

360
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,131
And so have you

361
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,838
Accept this.
- And meet my eyes

362
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:46,645
Come close. - And
reside in my heart

363
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:50,848
Accept this.
- And meet my eyes

364
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:55,655
Come close. - And
reside in my heart

365
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:58,886
l have fallen in love

366
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,464
And so have you

367
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,534
Accept this.
- And meet my eyes

368
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:10,871
Come close. - And
reside in my heart

369
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:15,512
Accept this.
- And meet my eyes

370
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,880
Come close. - And
reside in my heart

371
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:24,519
l have fallen in love..

372
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:37,126
Dear brother, mother
is requesting you..

373
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:40,395
..not to eat outside
food and ruin your health.

374
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,138
Don't get upset if
you don't get a job.

375
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,434
God answers everyone's prayers.

376
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:48,541
Even you will get
a good job some day.

377
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:52,446
l have asked for many
wishes from God for you.

378
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,549
My prayers won't go unheard.

379
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:57,313
Come home for a
few days if you can.

380
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:58,820
Your sister, lndu.

381
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,316
Mom.
- What is it?

382
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:02,187
Do you want me to
add anything else?

383
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:06,126
What is the use writing anything
to him. Raja is very stubborn.

384
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:09,624
He won't come home
until he gets a job.

385
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,130
l am proud to have such
a self respecting brother.

386
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:17,873
Don't you want to go to office
today? - Oh my God! l forgot.

387
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,278
Mom, l will drop the
letter on my way. - Alright.

388
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:24,479
Carry your tiffin.

389
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,517
Wallet! lt looks expensive.
When did you buy it?

390
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:31,747
My office friend gave
me a gift. l'm going.

391
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,383
Careful! Don't slip.

392
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:08,253
So you love that girl?

393
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:13,662
And if l give my consent, you
are even ready to marry her.

394
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,456
Yes, mummy.

395
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:19,737
Will you forget her if l refuse?

396
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,506
Say you won't.
Why are you afraid?

397
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:30,876
You want that l, Durgeshwari,
who travels in a Mercedes..

398
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:35,447
..should forget her status,
her prestige, her position..

399
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,486
..go to a hut and
ask a poor woman..

400
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:42,890
..her daughter's hand
in marriage for her son?

401
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:45,491
Yes, mother. - Good.

402
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,195
Shakti!

403
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:49,392
Yes, madam?
- Arrange for my departure.

404
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:55,170
Come madam,..sit down.

405
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:03,813
l am very fortunate that you
took the trouble to come here.

406
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:08,742
Yes, you are fortunate
and l did take trouble.

407
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:12,356
But you don't take the
trouble of coming to my house.

408
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,525
Because that will be your
trouble and my misfortune.

409
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:19,196
l don't understand.

410
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,722
l have not come here
to drink dirty water..

411
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,796
..in that dirty glass
with your dirty hands.

412
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:28,698
Has my daughter
made some mistake?

413
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,702
Your daughter is one worker among
the 1500 workers in my factory.

414
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,811
Her mistake is that she
makes Rs.500 a month.

415
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:43,552
But dreams of marrying the
factory owner, that is, my son.

416
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:46,316
She is immature. She can dream.

417
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:49,320
But you are her mother. Shouldn't
you have convinced her otherwise?

418
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:53,153
Convinced her against what?
ls it a crime to dream?

419
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:56,490
Your entire's month's expense..

420
00:35:56,801 --> 00:36:00,168
..is what l spend on
dog biscuits for a day.

421
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:03,106
What your daughter
makes in a month..

422
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:07,278
..my daughter spends in a
day in the beauty parlour.

423
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:11,548
How can your daughter
dare to see such a dream?

424
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:15,082
You are rich people. You
can feed biscuits to dogs.

425
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:19,822
But there is something which both
rich & poor have in equal measure.

426
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,588
And that is decency.

427
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:26,154
We have proved our decency
by welcoming you in our house.

428
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:29,824
But the proof you have
given of your decency..

429
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,430
..of coming to my house
and insulting me,..

430
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,262
..isn't worthy of you.

431
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:39,170
One who is selling her
daughter, who will respect her?

432
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,775
You are extending your
limits, Durgeshwari!

433
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:44,475
Call me Mrs. Durgeshwari!

434
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:47,444
lt is my decency that l
have come to your house.

435
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:52,617
Or l could spend a little
money and get anything done.

436
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,189
l could have got you
thrown out of this city.

437
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,596
But it is my principle not to
waste my might where words work.

438
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,528
So what do you want?

439
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:06,327
l want to buy you off.

440
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:12,207
l want you to take money for
your daughter's fake love.

441
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:15,446
Ask her to stop
following my son.

442
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,449
lf necessary, get
her married elsewhere.

443
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,273
l'll bear the expenses.

444
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:27,716
Come inspector, this
is that thief's house.

445
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,320
Thief!

446
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,427
Order a house search.
- Search the house.

447
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,191
Search for what?
- For a theft.

448
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,489
Who committed a theft?
- You ask that?

449
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,463
There is a complaint
against your daughter..

450
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:40,470
..that she has stolen Rs.50000
from Mrs. Durgeshwari's office.

451
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:42,305
You tricked Mrs. Durgeshwari!

452
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,100
l don't know anything about any
money. This is her conspiracy.

453
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,440
We may be poor, but
we are not thieves.

454
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,238
My daughter can never steal.

455
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,180
Sir, l found this
money in the suitcase.

456
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,888
What is this?
- This is not true.

457
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:01,319
l know, dear. She couldn't buy
us off, so she is threatening us.

458
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,550
Come and say whatever you
have to in the police station.

459
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,185
Bring her.
- Come!

460
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,087
l have not done anything, mom.

461
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,158
Save me, mom.

462
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,111
Why are you packing?
Are you going somewhere?

463
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,513
Paltu, mom has sent a telegram.

464
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,380
She's asked me to
come immediately.

465
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:35,624
Sign here.

466
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,688
Constable, release
that girl. - Yes, sir.

467
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,266
Brother!

468
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:49,205
Durgeshwari!

469
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,103
Durgeshwari!

470
00:38:58,349 --> 00:38:59,316
Durgeshwari!

471
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,212
Mayor, Collector,
even ministers..

472
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,283
..cannot meet me
without an appointment.

473
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:10,088
What vile man are you to
dare to barge into my house..

474
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,651
..without permission..

475
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:15,458
..and call me by my name?

476
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,100
Despite your abuses,
you are still alive,..

477
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,566
..is only because
you are a woman.

478
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:25,064
lf you were a man, l'd
pull out your tongue!

479
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:30,713
Who are you?
- Your death knell.

480
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:36,448
The sister in whose
eyes l cannot see tears..

481
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,646
..you falsely accused
her and sent her to jail?

482
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,655
You have brought her disgrace.

483
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,860
Oh, so you are that
thief's brother.

484
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,096
Shut up!
- You!

485
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:56,430
Your son loves my sister.

486
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,300
Ask him to marry her.

487
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:01,841
My son will love your sister?

488
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:07,179
l have never come across
such an unheard thing.

489
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:08,813
Dhiraj!

490
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,556
Do you love his sister?

491
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,526
Why are you afraid? Speak!

492
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:20,686
No, mummy.

493
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:25,233
l have never seen
his sister ever.

494
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,429
You scoundrel! You want to
ruin my innocent sister's life..

495
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:30,770
..for fear of your mother?

496
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,170
Even if l have to
break your bones..

497
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:37,312
..to get you married to
my sister, l'll do it.

498
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,411
Let me see who saves you.

499
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,684
Shakti.

500
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:47,243
l don't want bloodshed.

501
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,376
l came here because
you are a woman..

502
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:54,881
..and l hoped that you
must be decent enough..

503
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:58,144
..to understand another woman.

504
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,451
But neither are you a woman,
and nor is your son a man.

505
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,662
l will get my sister
married to a real man.

506
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,130
A man who is brave,
who has a heart.

507
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,131
l don't mind if he's poor, but he
shouldn't be his mother's slave.

508
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:18,133
Now even if you beg at my feet
and ask for my sister's hand..

509
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:20,541
..l won't get her
married to your son.

510
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,772
Dhiraj, throw out
all these useless men!

511
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:28,579
What have you done? You
broke ties with them forever?

512
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:32,884
Yes, mom. There is dictatorship
instead of emotions in that house.

513
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:36,487
Humanity is a slave, and
pride of money the boss.

514
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:40,789
Dogs are treated like humans
and humans are treated like dogs.

515
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,393
l will never let my sister
get married in that family.

516
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:49,865
Don't worry mom, l will get
lndu the best groom in the world.

517
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:54,509
It is too late for that now.
- What do you mean?

518
00:43:55,713 --> 00:43:58,341
We will have to get lndu
married to that guy only.

519
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:00,150
But why?

520
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,083
lndu has made a mistake.

521
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:24,136
Forgive me, brother.

522
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:28,300
Kill me if you like,
but please forgive me.

523
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:33,605
Being educated, how could
you make such a mistake?

524
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,719
Because of you, in the mansion..

525
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:40,884
l can still swallow my pride and
go & beg at Durgeshwari's door..

526
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:42,557
..for your sake.

527
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,491
But what is the use?
That boy is a coward.

528
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:51,298
A man who fears his mother so
much, how will he marry you?

529
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:54,169
Brother.

530
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,136
You?

531
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:02,340
How could you dare to come here?
- I could, that is why l came.

532
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:07,340
Seeing how daringly you faced my
mother, even l gathered courage.

533
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:11,783
l am ready to marry lndu,
if l have your blessings.

534
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:14,188
You cannot say a word in
your mother's presence.

535
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,088
How will you marry lndu?

536
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:20,458
Since childhood, l've
been afraid of mother.

537
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:26,132
l could never gather
courage to defy her.

538
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:31,140
Not just me, even my younger
brother Neeraj and sister Rekha.

539
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:33,667
Rekha?
- Yes, Rekha.

540
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:35,770
She studies in medical
college in Bombay.

541
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:39,110
Medical college?

542
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,214
Rekha!

543
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,385
So you want to marry lndu?

544
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,591
l will marry only lndu.

545
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:49,553
Good.

546
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,222
lf you have the courage
to do what you have said..

547
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:57,734
..l'll make arrangements
of your marriage right now.

548
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,537
What is the name of her college?
- Kasturba medical college.

549
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,197
Why?
- I have some work.

550
00:46:05,576 --> 00:46:07,100
How is your mother and sister?

551
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,235
Your friend told me
you received a telegram.

552
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,278
Is everything alright?
- There is a small problem.

553
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,619
What happened?

554
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:18,551
l think you fell in the water
that day and caught a cold.

555
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:19,611
lnhale this.

556
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,658
Cold will dissappear.

557
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,527
Looks like even you
have caught a cold.

558
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:28,497
You also inhale this. - Thanks.

559
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,641
Trouble!

560
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,682
Rekha, l was missing
you very much.

561
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,516
One..kiss...

562
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:53,380
Give me a kiss.

563
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,124
Even l..

564
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,728
Missed me, right?

565
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,767
Rekha! - Raja!

566
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,269
Rekha! - Raja!

Madam!

619
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:38,393
Hello. Why did you
take the trouble?

620
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:41,661
I've come to take my daughter.
- Rekha, you can go.

621
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:56,416
l had sent you here to
study, not to fool around.

622
00:52:56,787 --> 00:53:00,154
Fool around? But l did
not do any fooling around.

623
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,790
But mummy, my mid-term exams
are starting in two days.

624
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:10,088
What you have studied is enough.
l've decided to get you married.

625
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:14,168
Pack your bags, l am
waiting in the car.

626
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:16,737
Yes, mummy.

627
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:20,410
Madam, l want to
make a call. - Ok.

628
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:32,313
Hello? ls it 463546?

629
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:35,887
Raja stays upstairs,
please call him on the line.

630
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:39,318
Wish even l was a student.

631
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,722
l would love sitting
among so many girls.

632
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:46,427
l have heard the boy has
his own personal plane.

633
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,331
He owns banks in Switzerland.

634
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:54,267
He has breakfast in
America, lunches in Germany.

635
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:58,611
Has evening tea in London
and dines in France.

636
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:01,150
He only comes to lndia to potty.

637
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:04,750
And then, Durgeshwari will
not get her only daughter...

638
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:07,382
..married to just anybody.

639
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:10,493
We have heard the boy limps.
- He never walks anyway.

640
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:13,094
He is always flying.

641
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:14,696
Don't laugh. Get
her ready quickly.

642
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:19,626
Hello! What do l say
about madam's property?

643
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:21,670
Everyone is aware
how rich she is.

644
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:24,766
And Rekha is so beautiful..

645
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:33,410
..she is getting proposals
from the world's Princes'.

646
00:54:34,184 --> 00:54:36,550
But madam refused everybody.

647
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:39,381
You are fortunate that she
gave consent to your proposal.

648
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:40,616
Shakti. - Yes.

649
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:43,588
They must be aware of all
that before coming here.

650
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:47,196
Did they have breakfast?
- They had lndian breakfast.

651
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,729
They will have
English breakfast now.

652
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,329
Hello, Durgeshwari speaking.

653
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:57,202
l know. Who else can have that..

654
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:58,866
..voice in the
world other than you?

655
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:02,541
Who is this?
- You forgot so soon?

656
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:06,674
l came to your house
just a few days ago.

657
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,139
Durgeshwari

658
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:10,511
How could you dare to call me!

659
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:15,521
l dared to call you because
l am getting married.

660
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:18,193
And you must attend.

661
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:21,462
l cannot attend a
loafer's marriage.

662
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:27,866
Give up your old habits & attend
your only daughter's marriage.

663
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:29,865
What do you mean?

664
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,836
What has my daughter got
to do with your marriage?

665
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:36,312
Just what a bride has
to do with a groom.

666
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,137
You should not delay good work.

667
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:44,150
Because Raja is marrying
Rekha in Shankar temple..

668
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,712
..at sharp 11 am.

669
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:49,524
Do come to bless the couple.

670
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,391
My every wish is going
to be fulfilled today.

671
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:56,395
Come and wish me luck.

672
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:04,073
Shakti, where is Rekha?

673
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,103
She went to the bathroom
to change her dress.

674
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:09,436
And disappeared from there.

675
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,198
Your mother.

676
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:12,769
Mummy!

677
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:21,248
Rekha, why did you
have to marry secretly?

678
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:27,713
When the boy is so
handsome, worthy, and brave..

679
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,320
..l am not stupid
to have objected.

680
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:36,191
lf you had told me, l would
get you married with the pomp..

681
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:39,664
..Durgeshwari's only
daughter deserves.

682
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:44,363
l would invite the whole city.
llluminate every building.

683
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:46,766
l would spread out
flowers on the way.

684
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:50,370
And throw a lavish party
this city would never forget.

685
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:53,272
Sorry mummy, l made a mistake.

686
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:58,711
No dear, it is me
who made a mistake..

687
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:02,220
..in understanding
my son-in-law.

688
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,086
Rekha, you never told me..

689
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:10,489
your mom has a heart
as big as her mansion.

690
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:12,665
That she's an angel.

691
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:17,095
We made a grave mistake
by marrying secretly.

692
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:21,676
Please forgive us, and
give us your blessings.

693
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:26,679
When my son-in-law's every
wish is being fulfilled..

694
00:58:27,117 --> 00:58:29,415
..how can l refuse
to give my blessings?

695
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:31,178
Let's go home.

696
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:33,115
What had to happen is done with.

697
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:37,818
And l cannot wait for
what is going to happen.

698
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,152
Not me either.

699
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:43,458
What? You will stay with
them as a house husband?

700
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,464
Don't worry, l will
only live in that house..

701
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:54,205
..until l shatter the pride
of that proud Durgeshwari..

702
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:59,643
..and until she accepts
lndu as her daughter-in-law.

703
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:01,105
l'm a wagabond.

704
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,286
l'm a wagabond.

705
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:07,047
Or a star fallen in bad day.

706
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:12,093
Where is your attention?
- Sorry, l am a little busy.

707
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:15,120
Despite wearing
glasses, can't you see?

708
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:18,096
Moreover, you say you are
busy. Like as if you are a VlP.

709
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:27,167
Darling, when you reach home,
you'll realise what a VlP l am!

710
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:29,412
Sad news.

711
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,815
He keeps such a big wallet,
like as if he owns factories.

712
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:34,550
But has nothing in it.

713
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:39,214
Actor, did you receive any
letter or money order for me?

714
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:43,392
Money order for you? A letter
has come for you. Pay me Rs.1 .

715
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:47,085
l don't have Rs.1.
Will a condom do?

716
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:49,357
Disgusting! Take this and leave!

717
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:55,831
Happy news.

718
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:58,137
My Ustad is coming!

719
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,570
Brother, when are you coming?

720
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,710
I am dying to see you.
- I am coming tomorrow.

721
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,874
America to bombay
via Delhi Calcutta.

722
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:09,709
We will come to receive
you at the airport.

723
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:13,152
Who is coming, mummy?
- Your uncle DDT.

724
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:14,746
DDT?

725
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:18,819
Deen Dayal Trivedi.
He is a distant cousin.

726
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:22,459
Shakti, arrange for flowers,
my brother is coming.

727
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:25,399
l think l should
arrange for two garlands.

728
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:28,331
One to put around
him when he comes.

729
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:32,169
And the other to put on his
dead body if the plane crashes.

730
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:33,209
Shut up!

731
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:38,237
A red stick in a garden

732
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:42,306
How she fought!

733
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,879
l lost my heart,
l lost my life

734
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:47,419
Our eyes met and
things happened

735
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,216
A red stick in a garden

736
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,624
Why are you singing
about a woman in red?

737
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:54,419
l am wearing a yellow dress.

738
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:58,895
l don't know why l see
everything red today.

739
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:03,265
Rekha, what is
this about flowers?

740
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:06,335
Has someone died in the family?

741
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,371
Don't talk inauspicious.

742
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,613
My uncle is coming.

743
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,508
ls he Shakti's father?

744
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:16,575
No, he is mummy's
distant cousin.

745
01:01:17,187 --> 01:01:18,415
He is coming from America.

746
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:21,180
Your mother has a
cousin too? He is alive?

747
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:22,889
And he is coming from America?

748
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:25,524
Then he surely must
be a millionaire.

749
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,230
Where are you running?
Show me your ticket.

750
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:34,236
lf l had a ticket, would
l be running like this?

751
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:38,505
Boss.. - One minute.
- Boss.. - One minute!

752
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:40,140
Boss..
- One minute.

753
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:42,433
Sorry! Sorry!

754
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:46,179
l have brought everything
you asked me to get.

755
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,547
Very good. But have
you brought that?

756
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,749
What?
- Ustara.

757
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:55,415
What?
- Ustara.

758
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:59,391
What ustara?
- What you shave with.

759
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:01,696
Oh, you mean a razor?

760
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:07,134
l picked the pocket of a
barber just today morning.

761
01:02:07,203 --> 01:02:08,670
Oh great!

762
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:19,806
How do l look?

763
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:23,414
Boss. You look like
Michael Jackson.

764
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,222
Boss, do they still
serve eggs on Sundays..

765
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:31,624
..and mutton on Mondays there?

766
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:33,321
Where?
- In Tihar jail.

767
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,622
Don't ask for jail details here.
And remember one more thing.

768
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,757
From now on, we have
returned from America.

769
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:40,496
Where have we returned from?
- From Tihar jail.

770
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,697
From America, not Tihar, stupid!

771
01:02:42,906 --> 01:02:45,431
We are going into a
respected and affluent family.

772
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:46,532
l know, Ustad.

773
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:50,568
And stop calling Ustad. l am your
boss and you are my secretary.

774
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:52,910
l understand,
Ustad. Sorry, boss.

775
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:55,683
From today, you are
DDT, Deen Dayal Trivedi.

776
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:58,276
And l am BBC, Banke
Bihari Chaturvedi.

777
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:11,395
Hi sister.
- Hi sister!

778
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,463
Stupid, not her!
She is my sister.

779
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:15,696
Brother!

780
01:03:15,872 --> 01:03:18,864
Hi sister. l miss you.

781
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:24,110
He is my secretary, BBC, that
is, Banke Bihari Chaturvedi.

782
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:27,806
Garland me too.
- Welcome to lndia.

783
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:34,849
Wow! Sister, l am coming to this
mansion after so many years..

784
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,259
..and it hasn't changed a bit.

785
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:40,863
Boss, homes, temples and
jail don't change so soon.

786
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,824
Hello, uncle. - Hello

787
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:48,233
Sister, she is your
younger daughter?

788
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:49,771
Where is the elder one?

789
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,299
How are you, uncle? - Fine.
- Don't be offended by his actions.

790
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,368
His parents died
before he was born.

791
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:58,242
So he considers
everyone dear to him.

792
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:00,748
Hi uncle!
- Hi! Hello! How are you?

793
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:04,079
Sorry, l could not come to the
airport. - He had an upset stomach.

794
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,485
He is my younger son.

795
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:06,847
That is okay.

796
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:12,124
Who is this guy? lntroduce him.

797
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,160
Who are you?

798
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:19,433
Mummy is not in a
mood to talk about me.

799
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:21,635
So l will introduce myself.

800
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:26,235
l am Raja,
Durgeshwari's son-in-law.

801
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,235
Your niece's husband.

802
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:30,303
ls this introduction enough,
or do you want some more?

803
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,211
lt's enough.
- Shall l get coffee?

804
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:35,111
Whatever anyone may say,
but you make a lovely pair.

805
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:38,650
Like Ram and Sita.
Ravan and Mandodri.

806
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:41,618
Sister, why didn't you tell
me about your son-in-law?

807
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:43,683
He is so young and handsome.

808
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:46,854
l deeply regret not
attending this marriage.

809
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:48,858
But you should have
at least written to me.

810
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:50,724
Boss, which address
would she write on?

811
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:53,602
BBC is right. On what
address would she write?

812
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:57,137
l am in London one
day, America another..

813
01:04:57,173 --> 01:04:59,164
..and in Tihar jail the third.

814
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:02,772
Sister, whatever you may say, he
is a perfect match for the girl.

815
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:06,410
His richness drips from
his face. Drip, drip, drip.

816
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,313
That is why the
carpet is so wet.

817
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:11,785
That is not his richness,
it's the dog's richness.

818
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:14,222
Brother, you must be
tired. Go and take rest.

819
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:16,120
Dhiraj, take your
uncle to his room.

820
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:19,117
What have you brought
for me from America?

821
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:25,533
Rekha, your DDT uncle doesn't
seem to have come from America..

822
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:27,692
..but from the Andamans.

823
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:29,502
You joke about everything.

824
01:05:29,572 --> 01:05:31,096
It's a bad habit.
- Yes.

825
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:34,674
Somehow, Rekha should
stop loving him.

826
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:36,605
Both should get separated.

827
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,840
And this son-in-law
should leave this house.

828
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:40,171
That is all l want.

829
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,717
ls that all?

830
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:44,118
Sister, when l was in America,..

831
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,481
..l solved such small
problems in a jiffy.

832
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:48,619
By hook or by crook.

833
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:55,287
Once, my boss even
tried to bend iron bars.

834
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,593
What?
- Actually, sister..

835
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,832
lt so happened that the
house above ours was on fire.

836
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:06,136
We couldn't escape
through the door,..

837
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:09,404
..so l tried to
bend the window bars.

838
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:12,573
But the bars would not
bend, and we got caught.

839
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:17,414
Don't give the details now.

840
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:19,382
So what is the solution?

841
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:20,748
Money.

842
01:06:21,357 --> 01:06:24,793
Your son-in-law comes
from a poor family.

843
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:28,196
Try to buy him off with money.

844
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,328
Why did you marry my daughter?

845
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:36,130
She is a woman and l am a man.

846
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:39,471
And normally, a man
marries a woman. Any doubts?

847
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:43,310
A man can marry a woman.

848
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:49,150
But a beggar cannot
marry a princess.

849
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,450
l have high status,
money, prestige!

850
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,251
What do you have?

851
01:06:57,393 --> 01:06:59,691
l don't have anything
that you have.

852
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:03,695
But l have enough money
to buy a wedding chain.

853
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:06,631
Enough capability that l
can work and feed my family.

854
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:11,170
And enough machismo that l can
sire kids and make you a grandma.

855
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:14,541
What more does a man
need to marry a woman?

856
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,244
Talk business!

857
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:22,183
How much will you take
to leave my daughter?

858
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:27,714
Here's the cheque
book. l have signed it.

859
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:30,115
Fill in your amount.

860
01:07:34,163 --> 01:07:37,724
l didn't know you considered
your daughter to be so cheap.

861
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:40,798
And that you value her
worth with a little money.

862
01:07:42,205 --> 01:07:44,503
You want to pay money
and buy your daughter.

863
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:49,435
But l don't want to take
money and sell my wife.

864
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:54,611
You trapped my daughter into
marriage to take revenge from me.

865
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,642
l did want to take
revenge from you.

866
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:01,323
But l didn't love Rekha
to take revenge from you.

867
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:06,719
l love Rekha since the time l did
not know she was your daughter.

868
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:08,663
l am worldly wise.

869
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,558
You must have used your sister's
tears to woo my innocent daughter.

870
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:18,331
My shoulder is enough for my
sister's tears, Durgeshwari.

871
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,339
l don't need my wife
to wipe her tears.

872
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:25,077
You are very proud
of your strength.

873
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:28,648
l only have faith in my love.

874
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:31,151
l will put an end to this love.

875
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:33,688
You don't know me yet.

876
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:38,621
l will play tricks that
will make Rekha hate you.

877
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:41,562
l will get her
divorced from you!

878
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:43,832
l will take back my daughter!

879
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,300
A man who cannot protect
his bond of love, is no man.

880
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,600
A woman who wants to break her
bond of love is not a woman.

881
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:55,339
Yet, try your best.

882
01:08:55,711 --> 01:08:58,646
Let's see who proves to
be a man and who, a woman.

883
01:08:59,282 --> 01:08:59,873
Man!

884
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:06,450
You don't even have a few
morsels to feed your wife.

885
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:11,583
How long can you keep
your dream world intact?

886
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:18,567
lf l can buy everything,
can't l buy off my daughter?

887
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:24,536
l will get her so used to
riches that she will forget you.

888
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:30,535
She will return to the grandeur
she gave up to marry you.

889
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:34,574
l will give her
so many luxuries...

890
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:38,143
..that you will seem
like a thorn in her side..

891
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,745
..which she will
want to get rid of.

892
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:44,559
l will fill so much
hatred in her for you..

893
01:09:45,228 --> 01:09:49,289
..that not only her heart, she
will throw you out of her life.

894
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:52,391
That's my promise to you!
- You are dreaming, Durgeshwari.

895
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:55,660
The heart is more
powerful than money.

896
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:58,732
Even pride bows before love.

897
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:02,103
But the one who is
blinded by money..

898
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:04,636
..will not be able
to accept this fact.

899
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:07,240
But l will make
you see this truth.

900
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,841
l will ensure that
you become lonely..

901
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:12,483
..and bring you to that state..

902
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:18,523
..that all your pride will
shatter, and you will be floored.

903
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:19,889
This is my promise to you!

904
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:24,164
My glory will die with
me, not before that.

905
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:28,661
My wealth cannot
leave me until l die.

906
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:31,162
And until l have these two..

907
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:33,634
..people will continue
to dance to my tunes..

908
01:10:33,709 --> 01:10:35,199
..and l will make them dance!

909
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:37,369
l will make you so helpless,
you will be forced..

910
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,744
..to accept my sister as your
daughter-in-law & bring her home.

911
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:42,251
l'll make you bow before me.

912
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:43,644
Is it?
- Yes.

913
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:47,519
l have a bad habit of winning.

914
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,891
And l have not learnt to lose.

915
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:53,558
l am an experienced player.

916
01:10:54,764 --> 01:10:56,425
But these are my lucky days.

917
01:10:57,567 --> 01:11:01,230
You have not seen my temper,
only my good behavior.

918
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:06,664
The day l stop being good,
no one will agree to save you.

919
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:12,612
l know your style, but
even l can be very acidic.

920
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:14,774
You are a new hand at this game.

921
01:11:15,251 --> 01:11:18,220
Don't forget, experience counts.

922
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:20,851
Forget your past glory.

923
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:26,157
Open your eyes and realise
your opponent's worth.

924
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:30,288
l accept the challenge,
but l have a condition.

925
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:31,523
Tell me.

926
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:37,230
My daughter should not
know about our differences.

927
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,604
Certainly not. l am a gentleman.

928
01:11:40,142 --> 01:11:43,509
l'll keep my promise.
l will never tell her.

929
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:47,705
But if your tears give you
away, don't hold me responsible.

930
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:53,281
Tears and me? l will never cry!

931
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:59,185
And even l challenge that l
will give you sleepless nights.

932
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:03,321
Boss. - Yes. - From among all
the jails we have attended..

933
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:04,760
..l think this is the best.

934
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,092
l think you take
rest. Sister is coming.

935
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:11,399
He has challenged that he will
make me apologize to his sister.

936
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:13,674
That he will make
me bow before him.

937
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:15,538
That is why he has
become my son-in-law.

938
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,203
He is taking advantage
of my daughter.

939
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:19,144
l tell you sis, he is
a third-rate person.

940
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:21,775
But even l am intelligent.
Even l will find some way.

941
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,778
Have they celebrated
their nuptial night?

942
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:26,717
Not yet.
- They never will be able to.

943
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:35,662
Rekha, keep this
Rs.50000, you'll need it.

944
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:38,163
What will we do with
so much money, mummy?

945
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:40,198
We are not going shopping.

946
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:42,334
Mother-in-law
is so generous.

947
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:46,267
She is giving us Rs.50000
for our honeymoon!

948
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:51,512
Rekha, even we should get a
nice gift for mother-in-law.

949
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:54,576
Yes. We will bring
her a nice shawl.

950
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,512
Shawl? That is what l
don't like about you.

951
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:59,912
Can't she buy a
shawl for herself?

952
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:05,692
We should bring her a gift
she cannot buy herself.

953
01:13:06,796 --> 01:13:11,699
Like a small baby who looks
just like mother-in-law.

954
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:16,434
Mummy, we are leaving.
- Take this money.

955
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:21,108
Let's go. - How desperate
your daughter..

956
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:22,542
..is to go on her honeymoon.

957
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:24,604
Bye,
mother-in-law.

958
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:49,663
Me and you

959
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,706
Are no more strangers

960
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:54,309
Me and you

961
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:57,209
Are each other's shadow

962
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:58,640
Me and you

963
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:01,410
Have reached our destination

964
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,116
You and me

965
01:14:06,288 --> 01:14:07,414
You and me

966
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:10,459
Are coming close

967
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:11,651
You and me

968
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:14,719
Are going into a trance

969
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:16,189
You and me

970
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:19,234
Are humming

971
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:20,527
You and me

972
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:25,104
You and me

973
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:27,837
Are no more strangers

974
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:59,206
The winds are singing,
the paths are singing

975
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:03,468
The weather is
singing for you and me

976
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:09,842
The winds are singing,
the paths are singing

977
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:14,417
The weather is
singing for you and me

978
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:18,119
What has happened to
me that has got me dazed

979
01:15:18,194 --> 01:15:19,286
Me and you

980
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:22,330
On hearing these songs

981
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:23,658
Me and you

982
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:26,667
Have got tranced

983
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,167
Me and you

984
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:31,229
Have become the
talk of the town

985
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:32,569
Me and you

986
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:36,803
You and me

987
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:39,746
Are coming close

988
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:41,343
You and me

989
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:44,250
Are going into a trance

990
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:45,579
You and me

991
01:15:45,654 --> 01:15:48,521
Are humming

992
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:50,156
You and me

993
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:54,388
You and me

994
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:57,330
Are no more strangers

995
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:19,714
When our eyes met,
l went into a daze

996
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:24,287
Your touch made me beautiful

997
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:30,593
When our eyes met,
l went into a daze

998
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,093
Your touch made me beautiful

999
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:38,764
At night, even these
distances will be erased

1000
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:40,097
You and me

1001
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:42,870
And this youth

1002
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:44,539
You and me

01:16:44,613 --> 01:16:47,377
And this romantic weather

01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,725
Are each other's shadow

1011
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:06,260

Have reached our destination

1013

You and me

01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:22,179
Are going into a trance

1018
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:23,644
You and me

You and me

1021
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,843
Why are you doing
so much make-up?

1022
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:55,307
lt is all going to get
ruined in some time.

1023
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:56,613
Why?

1024
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,246
Only when something is
ruined on the nuptial night..

1025
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:01,756
..is when something gets made.

1026
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:03,581
l am feeling very sleepy.

1027
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,089
You mean we have
come so far to sleep?

1028
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:10,231
We haven't come to sleep?
Then what have we come to do?

1029
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:14,098
Why do l have to
tell you everything?

1030
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:16,466
You are like this
since childhood.

1031
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:19,071
Now listen. What
half the world..

1032
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,105
Oh God!
Mother-in-law's spy!

1033
01:18:26,548 --> 01:18:29,415
What is it? - What
happened? - Sad news!

1034
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:33,313
Hey, come here.
What is the matter?

1035
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:34,356
Sad news.

1036
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:37,390
Our car met with an accident.

1037
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:41,327
That's happy news!
DDT uncle is dead.

1038
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:43,790
No!

1039
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:46,858
Sad news.

1040
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:50,299
Madam's car met
with an accident.

1041
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:53,370
Mummy's accident?
How? ls she alright?

1042
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:57,602
How do l say?
- Don't cry. Calm down.

1043
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:01,548
Now tell me how the
accident happened.

1044
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,245
Sad news! How do l say it?

1045
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,751
Did anyone die?

1046
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:07,818
How do l say?

1047
01:19:08,057 --> 01:19:11,322
Is anyone seriously injured?
- How do l say?

1048
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:15,222
Then how will you
say it? - Sad news.

1049
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:18,457
He has brought such sad
news and you are joking?

1050
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:19,758
Pack our bags.

1051
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:31,179
Mummy, are you alright? We
heard you met with an accident.

1052
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:36,277
Thank God that you are
not hurt, mother-in-law.

1053
01:19:36,585 --> 01:19:39,577
Or one can even lose
limbs in an accident.

1054
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:42,314
Right,
mother-in-law?

1055
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:48,857
The car got smashed, but
l was saved by God's grace.

1056
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:53,433
l told them not to call you
back from your honeymoon.

1057
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,296
But brother wouldn't listen.

1058
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:58,170
You two must be tired.
Go and take rest.

1059
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,840
l know very well whose
deliberate act this is.

1060
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:06,680
lt will be better if the one
who has done this admits it.

1061
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:10,680
Or l have a trove of
abuses for such people.

1062
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,179
Shall l begin? Rasc....

1063
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,280
We become deaf at night.

1064
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:18,192
ls it? Then l will
abuse you in the morning.

1065
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:21,625
Son-in-law, see!

1066
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:24,355
l succeeded in keeping
you away from my daughter..

1067
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:28,803
..and in stalling
your nuptial night.

1068
01:20:29,438 --> 01:20:32,737
This is Durgeshwari's intelligence?
What do you think?

1069
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:35,871
Good. Very good.

1070
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:42,445
But mother-in-law, you should
appreciate my intelligence too.

1071
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:44,515
lt was a great opportunity.

1072
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,846
l did everything in the train.

1073
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,883
What did you do?
- Celebrated my nuptial night.

1074
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:53,161
Sad news.

1075
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:56,287
How could l let go
such a good opportunity?

1076
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:58,695
After all, l am
your son-in-law.

1077
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,494
So, what do you think?

1078
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:07,300
Uncle, l will celebrate my next
night with my bride here itself.

1079
01:21:07,776 --> 01:21:09,835
Or my mother-in-law
will feel offended.

1080
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:12,743
So l ordered the
flowers beforehand.

1081
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:14,874
Go and check if the
flowers have arrived.

1082
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,116
Didn't you people
hear what l said?

1083
01:21:18,187 --> 01:21:19,119
Yes.

1084
01:21:23,492 --> 01:21:26,256
Don't you two feel ashamed
to stand here before me?

1085
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:29,764
What can l do if he did
everything in the train?

1086
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:32,726
You should have bought
the train and stopped them!

1087
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:35,269
l didn't have money for the
ticket, how could l.. - Shut hup!

1088
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:37,205
Flowers! Fruits!

1089
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:40,435
Bananas, flowers. Barfi,
flowers! You bloody fool!

1090
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:42,633
You were with them, why
didn't you stop them?

1091
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:43,678
Shall l stop them now?

1092
01:21:43,745 --> 01:21:46,213
lf l stop them now,
you'll get thrashed.

1093
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,327
Before any other hurdle
is put in our way..

1094
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:04,626
we must finish with this.

1095
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,600
C'mon baby. What's the hurry?

1096
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:08,864
This night comes only
once in a lifetime.

1097
01:22:09,438 --> 01:22:12,168
And then, we are celebrating
our nuptial night.

1098
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:15,541
People make sweet conversation
on their nuptial night.

1099
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:19,739
But you are in such a hurry.
- I'm sorry, Rekha, l'm sorry.

1100
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:22,115
Rekha!

1101
01:22:27,222 --> 01:22:27,813
Rekha!

1102
01:22:31,793 --> 01:22:35,820
l am calling out your name,
and you are saying 'meow'?

1103
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:37,461
Can't you just say my name.

1104
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:40,727
Me? You only have been saying
'Rekha meow' over and over again.

1105
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:41,893
What?
- See!

1106
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:46,333
O God! - Mother-in-law,
what are you doing here?

1107
01:22:47,576 --> 01:22:49,271
Don't you dare call
my mother a cat!

1108
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,510
Damn the cat.

1109
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,574
Let's get to work. Come on.

1110
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:56,414
But l will feel embarrassed.

1111
01:22:56,652 --> 01:23:01,214
You mean the cat will go and
tell everyone what she saw?

1112
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:04,490
Let's throw out this cat.

1113
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:33,652
What do we do now?

1114
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,751
What half the world does..

1115
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:42,892
..in the middle of the
night with the other half.

1116
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:53,501
Mother-in-law, my
whole body is aching.

1117
01:23:53,809 --> 01:23:55,674
l couldn't sleep all night.

1118
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:58,175
lt felt like there
was an earthquake.

1119
01:23:58,246 --> 01:24:01,340
ls it? Yet you look so happy.

1120
01:24:01,717 --> 01:24:05,175
What do l say?
The night was such.

1121
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:06,784
Even Rekha could not sleep.

1122
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:08,855
Why? What happened?

1123
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:12,588
What did not happen in
the train. - What do you mean?

1124
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:14,288
Nuptial night.

1125
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:19,300
Mother-in-law, l told
you we did it in the train.

1126
01:24:20,135 --> 01:24:21,432
But l had lied.

1127
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:27,630
All the sweets you made,
the milk and dry fruits..

1128
01:24:27,876 --> 01:24:30,777
..all those silken
clothes you gave us..

1129
01:24:31,213 --> 01:24:32,771
..the royal bed.

1130
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:36,379
Had l ignored all this and
celebrated my nuptial night..

1131
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,748
..in some hotel or a train,

1132
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:39,548
you would have felt so offended.

1133
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,756
l could never have committed
such a grave mistake.

1134
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:45,317
What happened last night
was our nuptial night.

1135
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:52,360
lf you don't believe me, go
and have a look at the bed.

1136
01:24:52,434 --> 01:24:53,423
l swear by you.

1137
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:55,296
Rekha!

1138
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:59,365
Rekha, is my bath ready?

1139
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:02,137
You people made big promises.

1140
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:05,078
That he will not be able to
celebrate his nuptial night.

1141
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:07,613
But what he wanted happened.

1142
01:25:08,216 --> 01:25:10,810
lf we do nothing, he will win.

1143
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,818
And do what he has
threatened to do.

1144
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:16,656
Sister, l am intelligent.

1145
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:20,453
There is only one way
to make Rekha hate him.

1146
01:25:20,695 --> 01:25:22,754
Have him sent to jail.

1147
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:27,329
Which jail? Tihar, Nasik,
Agra, or Central jail?

1148
01:25:27,502 --> 01:25:29,663
My boss has influence
in every jail.

1149
01:25:31,206 --> 01:25:32,673
That's true. You eat your food!

1150
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:37,511
Sister, if we get
him arrested somehow..

1151
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,871
..and if he is behind bars
for six months to a year..

1152
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:42,673
..Rekha will forget him.

1153
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,742
Then we will get her
divorced and married again.

1154
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,178
But for what crime will
we get him arrested for?

1155
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:48,483
Don't worry about that.

1156
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,684
My boss is very
clever in such matters.

1157
01:25:50,826 --> 01:25:53,294
He will find some way.
- You shut up, bloody fool!

1158
01:25:53,428 --> 01:25:54,725
Thanks you. - Sister, listen.

1159
01:25:57,132 --> 01:26:01,694
Where is my nephew? Here he is!

1160
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:04,439
Why did you have to bring
so many toys for him?

1161
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:05,837
He is still a baby.

1162
01:26:06,074 --> 01:26:07,769
What are you saying, mom!

1163
01:26:08,143 --> 01:26:09,804
The one whose grandma
is a millionaire..

1164
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:12,546
..must have atleast
these many toys.

1165
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:18,082
Look nephew, don't be a
coward like your father.

1166
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:22,121
Be like your grandma. We'll
make you sit on her head.

1167
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:27,594
Hey, not me! Pee on
your grandma's head.

1168
01:26:27,762 --> 01:26:31,220
So that she cools down
and her pride shatters.

1169
01:26:31,299 --> 01:26:33,426
Look, he is saying he will.

1170
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:35,797
Rekha!

1171
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,301
Can l come in?
- Come, mummy.

1172
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,145
Where is son-in-law?

1173
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:47,773
Listen! Mummy wants to see you.

1174
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:50,744
Mother-in-law, you?

1175
01:26:54,556 --> 01:26:55,386
Sorry.

1176
01:26:56,358 --> 01:27:00,192
Rekha, if l had
got you married..

1177
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:03,391
..l'd have given you
Rs.4500,000 as dowry.

1178
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:09,232
But you two got married secretly
& deprived me of this happiness.

1179
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:15,406
But yet, l am a mother.
You can forget your duty..

1180
01:27:15,844 --> 01:27:18,745
...but how can l forget my duty?

1181
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:20,546
You are right,
mother-in-law.

1182
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,346
There is hope until
the last breath.

1183
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:26,209
The world survives on the goodness
of mothers-in-law like you.

1184
01:27:27,589 --> 01:27:30,251
Today is an auspicious day,..

1185
01:27:30,425 --> 01:27:32,416
..so l thought of
giving you Rs.4500,000.

1186
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:34,251
l had to give them some day.

1187
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:37,824
Mummy loves us so much.

1188
01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:40,793
Yes, she loves us very much.

1189
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:44,670
When her briefcase is so spacious
how spacious her heart must be.

1190
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,772
But what will we do with
so much money, mummy?

1191
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:50,475
We live here, use all
the things of this house.

1192
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:53,477
And Raja is not
interested in money.

1193
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:58,150
He is not like others.
- I know.

1194
01:27:58,753 --> 01:28:02,211
l know the qualities
of my son-in-law.

1195
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:06,054
l had kept this money for you.

1196
01:28:06,294 --> 01:28:09,058
Keep it, maybe you
need it some day.

1197
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:13,598
lf you keep it, a big
burden will be off my head.

1198
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,394
What do you say?

1199
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:20,266
To reduce parents burden is
the prime duty of children.

1200
01:28:20,508 --> 01:28:23,477
Take it.
- Mother-in-law is right.

1201
01:28:23,745 --> 01:28:25,679
Everyone should get
a son-in-law like him.

1202
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:28,475
Keep it safely.
- Yes, mother.

1203
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:32,451
Just a minute, mother-in-law.
Let me take your blessings.

1204
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:36,086
Give me your blessings,
mother-in-law.

1205
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:38,222
lf you continue to serve
your wife like this..

1206
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:39,419
..you will be happy.

1207
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:41,360
Thanks.

1208
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:43,553
Keep this.

1209
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:47,393
No, you keep it.
- Come on!

1210
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:49,361
As you wish.

1211
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,785
Hamam, Hamam, Hamam.

1212
01:29:11,192 --> 01:29:12,819
Boss, shall l take a
bath with Hamam soap.

1213
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:15,291
Whatever soap you bathe with
will not make any difference.

1214
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:16,330
Turn it around.

1215
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:20,533
Get a key made. And ensure
no one comes to know.

1216
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:22,670
Boss, this has reminded
me of something.

1217
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:25,068
What?
- That Nasik jail incident.

1218
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:29,332
Remember, you had made an
impression of a key on the soap.

1219
01:29:30,478 --> 01:29:34,877
And the jailer had caught you.
And then he had thrashed you.

1220
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:35,780
He is lying.

1221
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,939
Rekha.
- Yes, mummy?

1222
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,679
l need Rs.500,000.

1223
01:29:43,954 --> 01:29:45,421
l don't have them right now.

1224
01:29:45,723 --> 01:29:48,453
Give me from the money
l gave you yesterday.

1225
01:29:48,526 --> 01:29:50,084
l'll return it tomorrow itself.

1226
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:53,919
Don't embarrass me,
mummy. lt is your money.

1227
01:29:54,365 --> 01:29:55,491
l'll get it.

1228
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:59,568
Mummy needs Rs.500,000 from
the money she gave us yesterday.

1229
01:30:00,838 --> 01:30:01,930
l'll get it.

1230
01:30:03,941 --> 01:30:08,469
Now he will go to jail!

1231
01:30:08,546 --> 01:30:12,482
He will go to Nasik jail,
he will go to Tihar jail.

1232
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:16,509
He will get his ticket.
He will go to jail.

1233
01:30:16,587 --> 01:30:17,383
Stop?

1234
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,464
Rekha! Rekha!

1235
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,730
The briefcase is here, but
there is no money in it.

1236
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:35,033
Did you take the money?
- Me? No.

1237
01:30:35,506 --> 01:30:37,440
l gave the briefcase
to you to keep.

1238
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,936
Check again, it must be there.

1239
01:30:39,009 --> 01:30:41,068
But the money is not in this.
- What happened?

1240
01:30:41,612 --> 01:30:42,909
Didn't get the money?

1241
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:46,040
The Rs.4500,000 l gave
you yesterday disappeared?

1242
01:30:46,717 --> 01:30:49,379
He kept the money in the
cupboard and locked it.

1243
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,848
The money is not
in the cupboard now.

1244
01:30:50,921 --> 01:30:52,411
What is this l am hearing?

1245
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,014
Rs.4500,000 disappeared
from the house?

1246
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:57,885
Someone must have stolen it.

1247
01:30:57,962 --> 01:31:01,864
No, thieves aren't found in
jails, but at home. - Shut up!

1248
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:05,359
l don't know how this happened.

1249
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:08,968
This is beyond
us, son-in-law.

1250
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,032
The police will deal with it.

1251
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:20,780
Did you lock the money
in the cupboard yourself?

1252
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:23,444
Yes.

1253
01:31:23,521 --> 01:31:26,354
Did you give the key
to anyone else? - No.

1254
01:31:26,657 --> 01:31:29,626
lt's a serious matter; we'll
have to interrogate you.

1255
01:31:29,994 --> 01:31:32,986
You'll have to come to
the police station with us.

1256
01:31:40,337 --> 01:31:42,430
What's this?

1257
01:31:43,073 --> 01:31:45,667
lf you needed money,
you should have told me.

1258
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,105
l'd have given you
50 lacs instead of 45.

1259
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:51,512
Why did you have to
steal in your own house?

1260
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:55,047
Mummy, we are well
respected and well known.

1261
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:57,949
lf he goes to jail,
it'll bring us dishonour.

1262
01:31:58,856 --> 01:32:04,988
Whoever offends me will be
punished. It's justice.

1263
01:32:05,563 --> 01:32:06,552
Good morning sir.

1264
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:08,655
Mr. Jagannathan has sent
those papers in which...

1265
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,859
...he transferred his shares
in Durgeshwari Textile Mills...

1266
01:32:11,936 --> 01:32:13,494
...to your wife.

1267
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,506
He had received the
entire money yesterday.

1268
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:22,373
lt's clearly written here that...

1269
01:32:22,446 --> 01:32:24,937
...shares worth 45 lacs were
bought from Mr. Jagannathan.

1270
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,107
So why was the
robbery report filed?

1271
01:32:27,484 --> 01:32:29,679
Why didn't you tell
us the truth before?

1272
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:31,645
Because l knew that...

1273
01:32:32,489 --> 01:32:34,013
...without proof,
no one in this house...

1274
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:35,991
...would believe
the truth l spoke.

1275
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:40,961
The phone is ringing.

1276
01:32:41,298 --> 01:32:43,027
l'm expecting a call from
America, so l'm going!

1277
01:32:43,701 --> 01:32:46,602
l too have to discuss
something urgent, so l'm going.

1278
01:32:48,339 --> 01:32:50,864
Sad news! - Sister, the
money has gone with the wind!

1279
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:56,712
We use a Hamam soap, where
has this Lux come from?

1280
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:58,881
lt's come from here.

1281
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:01,645
Don't think that
only you know how to...

1282
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:05,888
...take a key impression
on soap. l know it too.

1283
01:33:06,891 --> 01:33:09,792
What are you saying?
- What is it?

1284
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,385
That's what l've
come to ask you.

1285
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:17,858
Tell me the truth, else
you'll suffer, fatso!

1286
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:21,336
I've taken your soap!
- Now take a slap!

1287
01:33:21,505 --> 01:33:23,632
l think my phone call
has come from America.

1288
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,836
Come on brother.

1289
01:33:26,777 --> 01:33:27,971
Mother-in-law...

1290
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:33,981
You had handed me the money,
saying it was a burden.

1291
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:37,952
Today, in order to revile
me in front of my wife...

1292
01:33:38,355 --> 01:33:40,050
...you got your men
to steal the money...

1293
01:33:40,591 --> 01:33:42,320
...and accused me of robbery!

1294
01:33:43,594 --> 01:33:46,654
But even this design
of yours has backfired.

1295
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:51,000
One more pawn of yours is
down; l won this round too.

1296
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:52,927
How did you like it?

1297
01:34:13,757 --> 01:34:16,419
There's a fire...

1298
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:22,765
There's a fire,
and rising smoke.

1299
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:26,735
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1300
01:34:26,804 --> 01:34:28,965
There's a fire,
and rising smoke.

1301
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,507
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1302
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:37,537
There's a fire,
and rising smoke.

1303
01:34:37,748 --> 01:34:43,687
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1304
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:46,549
There's a fire...

1305
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:51,692
Let go of my hand,
someone will see.

1306
01:34:51,829 --> 01:34:54,764
Let go of my hand,
someone will see.

1307
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:58,026
Let go of my hand,
someone will see.

1308
01:34:58,335 --> 01:35:01,304
Let go of my hand,
someone will see.

1309
01:35:01,538 --> 01:35:05,030
Do everything honestly.

1310
01:35:05,776 --> 01:35:08,836
Do everything honestly.

1311
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:11,812
Someone will see.

1312
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:18,650
Let go of my hand,
someone will see.

1313
01:35:18,989 --> 01:35:25,019
Whenever l hear of honesty...

1314
01:35:25,662 --> 01:35:32,830
...then l make use
of an old song:

1315
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:43,836
Seeing the condition of
honest people in this age...

1316
01:35:43,981 --> 01:35:52,514
...l have given
up being honest.

1317
01:35:52,823 --> 01:36:01,527
Seeing the condition of
honest people in this age...

1318
01:36:01,665 --> 01:36:05,829
...l have given up
being honest.

1319
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:09,996
...l have given up
being honest.

1320
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:31,357
Even if you keep
pining for me...

1321
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:35,056
...why should l listen to you?

1322
01:36:35,732 --> 01:36:39,463
Whether it's
my way or yours...

1323
01:36:39,603 --> 01:36:42,970
...why should l come with you?

1324
01:36:43,907 --> 01:36:47,570
Even if you keep
pining for me...

1325
01:36:47,711 --> 01:36:50,942
...why should l listen to you?

1326
01:36:52,282 --> 01:36:56,082
Do what l say, dream girl.

1327
01:36:56,887 --> 01:37:00,516
Dream girl, dream girl...

1328
01:37:01,091 --> 01:37:04,356
Dream girl, dream girl...

1329
01:37:04,561 --> 01:37:08,554
Do what l say, dream girl.

1330
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:12,635
Change yourself, dream girl.

1331
01:37:13,537 --> 01:37:17,598
You've gone awry, so
you'll have to amend...

1332
01:37:17,741 --> 01:37:21,837
You've gone awry, so
you'll have to amend...

1333
01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:25,676
...sooner or
later. - Who?

1334
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:29,818
Dream girl, dream girl...

1335
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:33,912
Dream girl, dream girl...

1336
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,959
Dream girl, dream girl...

1337
01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:02,676
Don't leave in anger,
l feel like crying.

1338
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:10,325
Don't leave in anger,
l feel like crying.

1339
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:18,595
l beg you, please
don't torment me.

1340
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:26,434
Don't leave in anger,
l feel like crying.

1341
01:38:26,577 --> 01:38:31,105
l feel like crying.

1342
01:38:32,482 --> 01:38:41,413
Fighting with me in vain,
you're standing so gloomily.

1343
01:38:42,893 --> 01:38:51,995
Fighting with me in vain,
you're standing so gloomily.

1344
01:38:52,936 --> 01:38:57,464
You're standing so gloomily.

1345
01:38:58,875 --> 01:39:07,408
You mean everything to me.

1346
01:39:07,551 --> 01:39:13,490
My heart is filled
with only love for you.

1347
01:39:13,824 --> 01:39:16,725
There's a fire.

1348
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:21,924
There's a fire,
and rising smoke.

1349
01:39:22,366 --> 01:39:26,097
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1350
01:39:26,403 --> 01:39:28,496
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1351
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:34,541
You don't know whose
heart is simmering.

1352
01:39:34,678 --> 01:39:37,613
There's a fire.

1353
01:39:38,982 --> 01:39:41,644
There's a fire.

1354
01:39:42,886 --> 01:39:45,753
There's a fire.

1355
01:39:48,892 --> 01:39:51,588
We'll have to think of
something to finish off Raja.

1356
01:39:51,995 --> 01:39:54,555
Finish your food, and think of
some plan to finish off Raja.

1357
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:59,101
You said you'd think of a plan,
and l'm not to worry about it.

1358
01:39:59,836 --> 01:40:02,464
And you, in Tihar jail...
- What Tihar jail?

1359
01:40:03,907 --> 01:40:05,101
l got an idea.

1360
01:40:05,642 --> 01:40:08,406
Whenever l tell sister
about any plan, it flops.

1361
01:40:08,845 --> 01:40:11,075
This time, l'll tell her
my plan after it's over.

1362
01:40:11,481 --> 01:40:14,575
l'll make such a plan
that Raja will be finished!

1363
01:43:31,481 --> 01:43:34,450
l'm sorry, Are you...
eh... hurt?

1364
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:39,681
No, it was my fault;
l was not in my senses.

1365
01:43:43,493 --> 01:43:46,894
Whose photo is this?
And who are these people?

1366
01:43:47,097 --> 01:43:50,533
That's the unfortunate
me, my wife Durgeshwari...

1367
01:43:51,868 --> 01:43:53,096
...and my children.

1368
01:43:53,904 --> 01:43:58,307
l got it. Come home with me,
everything will be all right.

1369
01:43:58,642 --> 01:44:02,373
Father!
- My son!

1370
01:44:02,512 --> 01:44:05,845
She's lndu, your
daughter-in-law. - Greetings.

1371
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:10,043
Greetings. - And he's Pappu,
your first grandson. - My grandson?

1372
01:44:11,087 --> 01:44:13,885
Come here, child.

1373
01:44:14,024 --> 01:44:16,788
And l'm Raja,
your daughter's husband.

1374
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:18,457
Rekha.

1375
01:44:20,363 --> 01:44:21,955
Yes?
- See who's here.

1376
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:24,691
Who's he?
- Your father.

1377
01:44:25,368 --> 01:44:27,996
l mean, he's like your
father... he's my uncle.

1378
01:44:34,411 --> 01:44:36,845
Bless you.

1379
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:41,415
He's my brother-in-law;
consider him to be your son.

1380
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:43,514
Who's he?
- Consider him to be your dad.

1381
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:46,554
Father! - Daddy. Papa.
Consider him to be your dad.

1382
01:44:48,959 --> 01:44:50,449
Your wife is coming.

1383
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:04,006
She's your wife...
l mean, my mother-in-law.

1384
01:45:04,407 --> 01:45:06,466
He's my uncle from Bhavanipur.

1385
01:45:11,982 --> 01:45:13,847
l'm having a doubt...

1386
01:45:14,317 --> 01:45:16,808
...that you staring at each

1387
01:45:17,454 --> 01:45:19,319
...as if you know each
other from before.

1388
01:45:19,623 --> 01:45:22,091
Do you have any
old relation with her?

1389
01:45:22,392 --> 01:45:23,654
What's this nonsense?

1390
01:45:23,893 --> 01:45:26,555
Am l bound to
acknowledge any vagrant?

1391
01:45:26,763 --> 01:45:31,029
You were looking at each other
so lovingly, that's why l asked.

1392
01:45:31,334 --> 01:45:33,802
Mummy, l require some money.

1393
01:45:34,571 --> 01:45:39,008
How did you dare to come here?
- But l live here!

1394
01:45:39,976 --> 01:45:41,967
There's no place in
my house for a runaway!

1395
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:45,480
Runaway?

1396
01:45:46,449 --> 01:45:48,076
But l haven't even
gone out of the house!

1397
01:45:48,451 --> 01:45:52,979
Weren't you ashamed to run
away from your responsibilities?

1398
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:55,615
Leaving your family
in the hands of fate...

1399
01:45:55,925 --> 01:45:57,586
...you became a vagabond!

1400
01:45:57,861 --> 01:45:59,886
And now you've come
to claim your rights!

1401
01:46:00,864 --> 01:46:04,027
Vagabond? Rights? Mummy, l...

1402
01:46:04,634 --> 01:46:05,430
Shut up!

1403
01:46:06,002 --> 01:46:07,697
lf you remain here
for one more minute...

1404
01:46:07,837 --> 01:46:11,773
...l don't know what l'll do!
Get out of my sight!

1405
01:46:12,342 --> 01:46:13,900
Get out of my house!

1406
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:14,935
Get out.

1407
01:46:15,078 --> 01:46:19,981
l wanted your permission
to keep him here.

1408
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:22,351
But you've gone away
without saying anything!

1409
01:46:31,628 --> 01:46:34,062
Let me go.
Why are you creating trouble?

1410
01:46:34,364 --> 01:46:37,993
What's the hurry?
The drama has just started.

1411
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:40,762
Remain here till l complete it.

1412
01:46:41,037 --> 01:46:43,267
Rs. 2 crores looted
from a museum!

1413
01:46:43,339 --> 01:46:45,739
Happy news! Happy news!

1414
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,536
Good morning, uncle.

1415
01:46:47,677 --> 01:46:49,508
Good morning. Good morning.

1416
01:46:49,979 --> 01:46:51,276
Good morning.

1417
01:46:53,917 --> 01:46:57,444
Which company did you
work for in America?

1418
01:46:58,088 --> 01:47:02,821
Yes that... l worked in the
Lincoln & Drunken Food Co.

1419
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:04,790
2,000 convicts
used to work there.

1420
01:47:06,429 --> 01:47:08,294
l see, that company?

1421
01:47:08,531 --> 01:47:11,056
There's an lndian
partner in that company.

1422
01:47:11,468 --> 01:47:14,733
You must be knowing him;
his name is l.C. Mishra.

1423
01:47:14,871 --> 01:47:17,635
He's an old friend of ours.

1424
01:47:17,774 --> 01:47:20,743
Just friend...
He's my childhood chum.

1425
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:23,573
We used to wear the same
clothes in childhood.

1426
01:47:24,414 --> 01:47:27,872
lf l called him rascal
once, he'd call me that thrice.

1427
01:47:28,017 --> 01:47:29,848
Rascal.
- Rascal, rascal, rascal.

1428
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,917
lf l abused him once,
he'd abuse me thrice.

1429
01:47:34,624 --> 01:47:35,784
Sad news!
- Uncle,

1430
01:47:36,392 --> 01:47:39,953
incidentally he is a good friend
of mine. He is in lndia right now.

1431
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:42,727
And he maybe here any moment.

1432
01:47:42,932 --> 01:47:46,493
He should be here. There he is.

1433
01:47:51,074 --> 01:47:53,838
Welcome my friend, welcome.

1434
01:47:54,911 --> 01:47:56,071
Hello DDT.

1435
01:47:59,315 --> 01:48:00,714
And how are you BBC?

1436
01:48:01,484 --> 01:48:04,681
Hello rascal?
Rascal, rascal, rascal.

1437
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:07,823
l have not met
you since a long time.

1438
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:09,550
Mr. Mishra.

1439
01:48:09,759 --> 01:48:14,059
You said that D.D.T. Uncle had
stolen your watch in America.

1440
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:17,398
He's been a thief
right from childhood.

1441
01:48:17,467 --> 01:48:20,402
Give me my watch.
- My father had given it!

1442
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:22,097
Give it to your grandpa now!

1443
01:48:22,405 --> 01:48:23,633
My father's watch!

1444
01:48:25,508 --> 01:48:26,702
And you BBC.

1445
01:48:26,876 --> 01:48:33,304
You'd wagered with me
at a club in America. - A ring.

1446
01:48:33,416 --> 01:48:36,943
Yes, a ring,
and you'd lost that wager.

1447
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,546
Give me my ring.
- My father had given it to me!

1448
01:48:40,623 --> 01:48:42,887
Now give it to your grandpa!

1449
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:45,694
Aruna darling.

1450
01:48:46,062 --> 01:48:49,930
lf you just keep rehearsing,
when will we smooch?

1451
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,734
There's no season,
weather or date for that.

1452
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:58,637
Father! - Is that some old
goat being slaughtered?

1453
01:48:59,275 --> 01:49:03,302
Or some donkey crying?
- It's my father's voice.

1454
01:49:03,513 --> 01:49:05,037
Your father?

1455
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:10,644
Your bloody father,
so out of tune?

1456
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:13,450
I'm going from here!
- Father is coming here!

1457
01:49:13,523 --> 01:49:15,787
Then l'll go from that side!
- No!

1458
01:49:16,926 --> 01:49:18,894
Then l'll become a table,
put a cloth over me!

1459
01:49:18,962 --> 01:49:21,453
Put it quickly!
Put it quickly! Put it!

1460
01:49:22,332 --> 01:49:24,596
Let me stay at your feet
O Lord, considering...

1461
01:49:24,667 --> 01:49:26,794
...me the servant at your feet.

1462
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,466
My child, are you
rehearsing for your drama? - Yes.

1463
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,906
Rehearse properly.

1464
01:49:33,042 --> 01:49:37,945
lf the people
don't like your work...

1465
01:49:38,014 --> 01:49:40,346
...they'll throw
rotten eggs at you.

1466
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:44,978
And you know that
l'm a pure vegetarian.

1467
01:49:45,054 --> 01:49:47,784
Last time, when
they threw tomatoes...

1468
01:49:47,857 --> 01:49:51,691
...l ate tomatoes
for a whole year.

1469
01:49:52,128 --> 01:49:53,789
What hit me?

1470
01:49:56,699 --> 01:50:00,135
l think l drank a bit
too much last night.

1471
01:50:00,637 --> 01:50:03,435
This bloody table...

1472
01:50:04,073 --> 01:50:09,067
My to-be son-in-law, it's
you! What great acting you do!

1473
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:16,018
Rekha, pass those fries.

1474
01:50:17,353 --> 01:50:18,615
He really likes it.

1475
01:50:19,055 --> 01:50:23,788
But my aunt, instead
of feeding him fries...

1476
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,451
...fried him with her scoldings.

1477
01:50:29,565 --> 01:50:31,931
Not you, but my uncle's wife.

1478
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:35,528
Some wives are like jail guards.

1479
01:50:35,605 --> 01:50:39,905
They burn their husbands
to ashes with their tongues.

1480
01:50:40,076 --> 01:50:42,374
You didn't marry, so how will
you know? Shut up and eat!

1481
01:50:42,445 --> 01:50:47,439
He's not wrong. My aunt gave
so much sorrow to my uncle...

1482
01:50:47,717 --> 01:50:49,014
...that he never found peace.

1483
01:50:49,352 --> 01:50:51,752
She used to blaze upon
him over small matters.

1484
01:50:52,088 --> 01:50:53,646
What an aunt!

1485
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:56,950
Not you, but my uncle's wife.

1486
01:50:57,994 --> 01:51:00,963
Such wives are sad
news for their husbands.

1487
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,328
Eat your breakfast quietly!

1488
01:51:03,466 --> 01:51:04,990
B.B.C. ls right.

1489
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:09,367
There are only a few women,
like my mother-in-law...

1490
01:51:09,706 --> 01:51:11,469
...who never forget
their husbands...

1491
01:51:11,741 --> 01:51:14,437
...wherever they may be.

1492
01:51:15,445 --> 01:51:18,380
Who made this breakfast
fit only for beggars?

1493
01:51:18,648 --> 01:51:21,776
Shakti, arrange our breakfast
from some good hotel!

1494
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,988
l've booked a table at
another hotel, let's go!

1495
01:51:26,422 --> 01:51:31,689
l'll come too,
wearing my new clothes.

1496
01:51:31,761 --> 01:51:36,892
Did you see? Even after 15
years, her pride is so hot...

1497
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,034
...that an egg can be
fried over her head!

1498
01:51:40,903 --> 01:51:42,530
But don't worry.

1499
01:51:43,473 --> 01:51:46,408
l'll make her pride
fall at your feet.

1500
01:51:47,377 --> 01:51:50,346
Leave this illusive
pride over your wealth...

1501
01:51:51,347 --> 01:51:55,078
...and see the world through
the eyes of an ordinary person.

1502
01:51:55,852 --> 01:51:59,481
Then you'll realise what
you've been missing for so long.

1503
01:52:00,556 --> 01:52:03,719
Our son-in-law is
a very good boy.

1504
01:52:04,494 --> 01:52:06,792
Forget the past and
listen to him.

1505
01:52:07,597 --> 01:52:09,656
There's still time:
Change yourself.

1506
01:52:10,433 --> 01:52:11,923
You don't have to
teach me anything!

1507
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:13,959
Pack your things
and get out from here!

1508
01:52:14,037 --> 01:52:19,031
As long as l am there,
how can this happen?

1509
01:52:19,842 --> 01:52:24,541
You have built your palace here.

1510
01:52:25,415 --> 01:52:30,114
He won't go until you
acknowledge him as the owner.

1511
01:52:30,353 --> 01:52:32,981
As long as l am alive,
this will never happen!

1512
01:52:33,623 --> 01:52:37,957
lt will, when l tell
your children who he is...

1513
01:52:38,528 --> 01:52:45,058
...and why you threw
him out 15 years back.

1514
01:52:45,435 --> 01:52:50,998
Not realising my might,
you're speaking crazy words!

1515
01:52:51,908 --> 01:52:56,971
The best thing for you is to
get out of this house quietly.

1516
01:52:58,014 --> 01:53:01,347
Else, by 5 in the evening...

1517
01:53:01,818 --> 01:53:09,850
...my children will throw
both of you out of this house!

1518
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:13,494
And if this doesn't happen?

1519
01:53:14,397 --> 01:53:17,332
Then my name is not Durgeshwari!

1520
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:21,336
You keep losing, and l don't
feel happy making you lose.

1521
01:53:21,804 --> 01:53:24,739
Because you're as
stubborn as you're haughty.

1522
01:53:26,109 --> 01:53:28,509
l accept this
challenge of yours too.

1523
01:53:29,078 --> 01:53:35,540
The people you want, using
whom, you want to throw us out...

1524
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:37,718
...will leave you
completely alone.

1525
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:42,484
l'll make you repent
for your past misdeeds.

1526
01:53:42,959 --> 01:53:47,396
You'll plead to make my
sister your daughter-in-law.

1527
01:53:48,464 --> 01:53:51,956
Suppose this doesn't happen?
- Why won't it?

1528
01:53:52,702 --> 01:53:55,762
After all, my name is
also... everyone knows!

1529
01:53:58,808 --> 01:54:01,106
On the happy occasion of
this child's birthday...

1530
01:54:01,744 --> 01:54:04,542
...l want to give some good
news to my family members.

1531
01:54:05,414 --> 01:54:11,353
Had the proper person
given this good news...

1532
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,978
...then it would have
been much happier.

1533
01:54:13,523 --> 01:54:17,482
l'll say it; l'm sure you'll
congratulate me after that.

1534
01:54:17,627 --> 01:54:19,424
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up!

1535
01:54:19,695 --> 01:54:23,597
Why are you always in a
hurry? Uncle, hold him.

1536
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,630
What happened?
- She'll be coming.

1537
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:29,804
There are still 2
minutes left till 5 p.m.

1538
01:54:30,506 --> 01:54:32,974
Shall l tell the good news?
- Do whatever you wish fast!

1539
01:54:33,142 --> 01:54:36,771
My beloved
brothers-in-law...

1540
01:54:37,813 --> 01:54:39,440
...the good news is that...
- Listen!

1541
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:43,909
Wait!

1542
01:54:48,758 --> 01:54:51,727
Listen to me! Don't do this!

1543
01:54:51,894 --> 01:54:56,524
Who are you?
- Where do l go now?

1544
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:58,958
You deceived and left
me, and ruined my life!

1545
01:54:59,468 --> 01:55:05,498
What will happen to me now?
What wrong did l do to you?

1546
01:55:05,741 --> 01:55:08,539
Who are you?
What are you saying?

1547
01:55:08,744 --> 01:55:12,111
Are you asking me that? You
spoke such loving words to me!

1548
01:55:12,615 --> 01:55:15,641
You made so many promises;
we lived together for so long!

1549
01:55:17,486 --> 01:55:19,511
Did you forget our child?

1550
01:55:22,091 --> 01:55:25,083
And you're asking me who l am!

1551
01:55:25,394 --> 01:55:30,058
Even after seeing our child
don't you remember who l am?

1552
01:55:34,136 --> 01:55:37,663
lt's past 5 now.
So how's this?

1553
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,841
Who's this girl?
What is she saying?

1554
01:55:42,011 --> 01:55:45,913
Ask me! He's the father
of this child!

1555
01:55:46,849 --> 01:55:51,013
He loved me, but, greedy
for wealth, he married you!

1556
01:55:51,787 --> 01:55:54,756
He deceived both of us!
l beg you!

1557
01:55:55,558 --> 01:55:59,085
You're rich, you'll
find someone else!

1558
01:55:59,395 --> 01:56:03,661
Please leave him, l don't
have anyone else but him!

1559
01:56:04,533 --> 01:56:05,727
Anyone.

1560
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:09,503
What a good artist?

1561
01:56:10,573 --> 01:56:13,701
lf you can't accept
me, then give me poison!

1562
01:56:14,076 --> 01:56:16,044
After that, settle down
with anyone you wish!

1563
01:56:16,545 --> 01:56:21,778
You being father... Please
don't do injustice to our son!

1564
01:56:22,418 --> 01:56:24,613
Don't do injustice.
- Enough, Aruna!

1565
01:56:26,055 --> 01:56:28,546
Your tears have
opened my eyes!

1566
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:34,921
l'll never leave you!
Please forgive me!

1567
01:56:36,966 --> 01:56:37,955
l'm sorry Aruna.

1568
01:56:38,868 --> 01:56:39,926
Rekha!

1569
01:56:40,903 --> 01:56:44,339
This is what
l wanted to tell you.

1570
01:56:45,007 --> 01:56:49,876
Aruna is my wife;
we'll live together now.

1571
01:56:50,346 --> 01:56:51,040
Mishra!

1572
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:56,884
No one can separate us now!

1573
01:56:58,354 --> 01:57:04,020
Now, in front of everyone,
l'll make you my wife!

1574
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:10,529
Oh. l'm sorry!

1575
01:57:19,575 --> 01:57:22,942
Mishra, it's of no use.
Chant the hymns.

1576
01:57:33,923 --> 01:57:37,484
Stop! This is injustice,
and a sin!

1577
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,251
l love her, and
want to marry her!

1578
01:57:43,432 --> 01:57:46,765
She's like your sister.
- But she says she's my wife.

1579
01:57:47,036 --> 01:57:48,503
And that this child is mine.

1580
01:57:49,638 --> 01:57:51,936
l said l'll marry you soon!

1581
01:57:52,541 --> 01:57:55,305
So why this drama?
And who's this child?

1582
01:57:55,644 --> 01:57:59,740
These two promised to pay me
Rs.10,000 for this. - What?

1583
01:58:01,617 --> 01:58:05,280
So my father sent me. l
didn't know it was your house.

1584
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:08,651
l can't wait any longer, or
you'll do this somewhere else.

1585
01:58:09,091 --> 01:58:10,683
Give me the necklace...

1586
01:58:11,827 --> 01:58:13,590
Keep chanting the hymns.

1587
01:58:15,364 --> 01:58:18,390
Dheeraj! What are you doing?
- This is known as marriage.

1588
01:58:18,701 --> 01:58:22,728
l never had the courage to
tell you anything till now!

1589
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:25,899
We're married now, but
you'll never accept it!

1590
01:58:26,108 --> 01:58:27,598
So l'm leaving this house!

1591
01:58:27,743 --> 01:58:28,607
Neeraj!

1592
01:58:28,677 --> 01:58:31,669
lf you shout,
l'll get scared and stop!

1593
01:58:31,847 --> 01:58:33,838
Then you'll try
to separate us!

1594
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:36,476
That's why,
l'm leaving this house!

1595
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,967
Uncles!

1596
01:58:52,568 --> 01:58:53,694
Uncles!

1597
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,999
Why did you call that girl here?

1598
01:58:59,308 --> 01:59:01,868
To separate Rekha and me?

1599
01:59:02,478 --> 01:59:06,005
Yes, so that my
daughter can be happy.

1600
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:10,909
Whose child did you bring here?

1601
01:59:11,654 --> 01:59:13,281
What relation do
you have with him?

1602
01:59:15,024 --> 01:59:19,427
Rekha, ask him
whose child it is.

1603
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:26,865
Even uncle had told me,
but l didn't believe it.

1604
01:59:27,603 --> 01:59:29,969
Today, l'm forced to
ask you about this child.

1605
01:59:30,306 --> 01:59:33,070
What relation do you have
with him? - This child...

1606
01:59:33,409 --> 01:59:34,569
He's my uncle's grandson.

1607
01:59:34,643 --> 01:59:37,009
Not Uncle's you
mean his grandson.

1608
01:59:37,313 --> 01:59:38,746
Don't try to fool us!

1609
01:59:38,948 --> 01:59:41,678
Tell us what relation
you have with this child!

1610
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:44,676
l think he did
something wrong outside.

1611
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:46,720
Who is this child's mother?

1612
01:59:47,089 --> 01:59:50,354
So many people are asking
you, yet you're silent!

1613
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,885
Then this child has to
be your illegitimate son!

1614
01:59:52,962 --> 01:59:53,826
Rekha! - Yes.

1615
01:59:53,929 --> 01:59:57,387
Else, why did you bring him
and the old man to this house?

1616
01:59:57,766 --> 02:00:00,462
Something illicit must be going
on between you and his mother!

1617
02:00:00,536 --> 02:00:01,093
Rekha!

1618
02:00:04,473 --> 02:00:08,432
l'll tell you what the truth
is! Dheeraj! - You keep quiet!

1619
02:00:08,844 --> 02:00:12,075
When they're saying such dirty
things, l can't remain silent!

1620
02:00:15,985 --> 02:00:17,919
This is my child.

1621
02:00:19,622 --> 02:00:23,080
He is my and Raja's
sister lndu's son.

1622
02:00:24,894 --> 02:00:26,088
Dheeraj!

1623
02:00:27,096 --> 02:00:28,688
What have you done?

1624
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:34,831
l forbade that girl
to even enter my house!

1625
02:00:35,404 --> 02:00:37,565
How did you dare to
start a family with her?

1626
02:00:38,307 --> 02:00:39,865
As he's father.

1627
02:00:39,942 --> 02:00:42,968
How did you dare to bring
this child to this house? l...

1628
02:00:43,412 --> 02:00:45,346
l knew from before
what you're about to do.

1629
02:00:45,881 --> 02:00:50,682
I bid goodbye to your wealth,
status and rule! - What?

1630
02:00:50,753 --> 02:00:53,984
I'm going!
- Dheeraj, listen to me!

1631
02:01:01,363 --> 02:01:02,728
Shout louder!

1632
02:01:04,433 --> 02:01:05,900
Why did you stop? Shout!

1633
02:01:08,337 --> 02:01:10,066
Their small worlds...

1634
02:01:10,806 --> 02:01:13,969
...would be much
better than this hell!

1635
02:01:16,111 --> 02:01:18,807
Once, due to your arrogance...

1636
02:01:18,881 --> 02:01:21,349
...you threw your husband
out of this house!

1637
02:01:22,051 --> 02:01:23,780
Today, you're throwing
out your children!

1638
02:01:24,887 --> 02:01:27,014
One-by-one, all
of us will leave!

1639
02:01:27,823 --> 02:01:31,691
You'll be left alone with
your wealth and status!

1640
02:01:39,001 --> 02:01:42,061
Rekha, your husband
is one in a million.

1641
02:01:43,772 --> 02:01:45,399
Don't be like your mother...

1642
02:01:46,108 --> 02:01:48,633
...who has no respect
for her own husband.

1643
02:01:50,746 --> 02:01:53,340
You go too, and remain happy.

1644
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:58,381
Are you my father?

1645
02:01:58,554 --> 02:02:01,455
Yes, he's your papa.

1646
02:02:02,958 --> 02:02:06,758
Your stubborn mother
doesn't even acknowledge him.

1647
02:02:07,663 --> 02:02:10,655
This was the only gap between us.

1648
02:02:12,067 --> 02:02:15,594
l promised her that, until
my sister settles down...

1649
02:02:16,338 --> 02:02:17,635
...l won't tell you anything.

1650
02:02:23,045 --> 02:02:24,603
l never even dreamt that...

1651
02:02:25,681 --> 02:02:28,650
...one day l'll regret
being your daughter.

1652
02:02:30,586 --> 02:02:33,487
l'm going... Come.

1653
02:02:49,505 --> 02:02:53,703
You said that,
by 5 in the evening...

1654
02:02:54,576 --> 02:02:57,306
...your children would
throw me out of this house.

1655
02:02:58,447 --> 02:03:02,474
lt's past 5, and your
children have left you.

1656
02:03:03,585 --> 02:03:04,847
You've been left alone.

1657
02:03:06,388 --> 02:03:07,514
Mother-in-law...

1658
02:03:08,457 --> 02:03:11,915
Real wealth isn't
anything material.

1659
02:03:12,995 --> 02:03:17,557
Real wealth are
our kith and kin...

1660
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,834
...who are ready to die for us.

1661
02:03:22,504 --> 02:03:26,031
Now tell me.
Who won, and who lost?

1662
02:03:27,843 --> 02:03:30,971
Don't celebrate
your victory so soon.

1663
02:03:31,814 --> 02:03:33,805
Life is not possible
without money.

1664
02:03:34,483 --> 02:03:39,011
l have money.
Whoever l throw it at...

1665
02:03:39,555 --> 02:03:42,456
...will return to me
like a pet dog!

1666
02:03:43,025 --> 02:03:45,016
l can buy everything with money!

1667
02:03:46,295 --> 02:03:47,819
Everything?
- Yes!

1668
02:03:48,564 --> 02:03:52,864
Property, factories,
land, jewelry? - Yes!

1669
02:03:52,935 --> 02:03:54,368
A husband?
- Yes!

1670
02:03:59,108 --> 02:04:00,973
You can't buy that.

1671
02:04:01,744 --> 02:04:03,473
Money can't buy everything.

1672
02:04:04,747 --> 02:04:07,614
Like your dear ones,
who have left you.

1673
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:11,849
Now tell me, how was this?

1674
02:04:17,593 --> 02:04:20,756
Sister, don't be afraid of them.

1675
02:04:20,963 --> 02:04:24,660
Remain adamant, they'll
soon fall at your feet!

1676
02:04:24,833 --> 02:04:26,357
l'm feeling so happy.

1677
02:04:27,436 --> 02:04:30,098
After 15 years,
l'm seeing a full house.

1678
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:36,643
All my relatives are with me.

1679
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:41,944
But Durgeshwari would have
made this family complete.

1680
02:04:42,384 --> 02:04:45,649
That day is not far,
have faith in me.

1681
02:04:45,854 --> 02:04:48,618
lt will be morning soon.

1682
02:04:48,824 --> 02:04:50,792
Any moment it will be dawn.

1683
02:04:51,293 --> 02:04:54,387
Today is our nuptial
night; so, if you permit...

1684
02:04:54,563 --> 02:04:58,693
You've grown habituated
to taking orders.

1685
02:04:58,967 --> 02:05:01,026
Does one have to take
permission for his nuptial night?

1686
02:05:01,103 --> 02:05:04,470
Go straight, turn right:
Your room is there.

1687
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:09,006
There's a bed in it,
flowers, and... - Enough!

1688
02:05:09,478 --> 02:05:11,844
I know. - You know?
Then get lost from here!

1689
02:05:26,428 --> 02:05:28,328
This is my study room.

1690
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:32,392
Do you see this window? You get
light from outside from here.

1691
02:05:32,601 --> 02:05:34,330
l have studied in this
light and passed double M.A.

1692
02:05:34,403 --> 02:05:36,064
We'll get this light all night.

1693
02:05:36,805 --> 02:05:38,432
All night?
- Yes.

1694
02:05:38,807 --> 02:05:40,035
Oh no!

1695
02:05:46,348 --> 02:05:47,406
What noise is that?

1696
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:49,975
That must be Shantabai.
- Shantabai?

1697
02:05:50,652 --> 02:05:51,641
My lizard.

1698
02:05:53,021 --> 02:05:55,046
At this time, it must
be after Changu Mangu.

1699
02:05:55,524 --> 02:05:56,491
Changu Mangu?

1700
02:05:56,658 --> 02:05:57,852
My cockroaches.

1701
02:05:58,026 --> 02:05:59,891
l was just joking. lf a
poor man doesn't make...

1702
02:06:00,062 --> 02:06:02,587
lf a poor man doesn't make fun
of his troubles, how can he live?

1703
02:06:02,898 --> 02:06:05,696
ln your mother's palace there's
no place even for humans.

1704
02:06:06,101 --> 02:06:08,729
ln my hut, there is
place for animals too.

1705
02:06:09,438 --> 02:06:12,896
There are no animals. But
there is surely a thief here.

1706
02:06:13,742 --> 02:06:14,572
Where?

1707
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:16,877
ln the lock of my arms.

1708
02:08:35,384 --> 02:08:42,881
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1709
02:08:43,291 --> 02:08:50,925
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1710
02:08:51,266 --> 02:08:58,934
My entire being is yours now.

1711
02:08:59,274 --> 02:09:06,771
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1712
02:09:07,082 --> 02:09:14,750
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1713
02:09:15,057 --> 02:09:22,623
My entire being is yours now.

1714
02:09:22,964 --> 02:09:30,530
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1715
02:09:30,906 --> 02:09:38,642
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1716
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:50,083
How do l tell about the
magic you've done to me?

1717
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:58,353
How do l tell about the
magic you've done to me?

1718
02:10:58,627 --> 02:11:05,965
Wherever l look,
l see only you.

1719
02:11:07,068 --> 02:11:10,731
You reside in my eyes.

1720
02:11:10,972 --> 02:11:14,738
You have put me on fire.

1721
02:11:14,943 --> 02:11:22,645
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1722
02:11:22,851 --> 02:11:30,485
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1723
02:12:51,539 --> 02:12:58,968
l often think about
how beautiful you are.

1724
02:12:59,514 --> 02:13:06,852
l often think about
how beautiful you are.

1725
02:13:07,422 --> 02:13:14,851
How come there's no other
girl like you anywhere?

1726
02:13:15,864 --> 02:13:19,391
l swear l can die for you.

1727
02:13:19,768 --> 02:13:23,704
l'm yours forever.
My love will diminish.

1728
02:13:23,772 --> 02:13:31,110
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1729
02:13:31,713 --> 02:13:39,085
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1730
02:13:39,554 --> 02:13:47,086
My entire being is yours now.

1731
02:13:47,395 --> 02:13:54,824
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1732
02:13:55,370 --> 02:14:02,970
l've fallen so deeply
in love with you.

1733
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:34,768
Money, jewelry!

1734
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:42,680
Shakti!

1735
02:14:42,851 --> 02:14:46,446
Come in, it's your house.

1736
02:14:46,654 --> 02:14:50,750
What are you doing?
- I don't know what you call it.

1737
02:14:51,926 --> 02:14:56,920
But l call it being practical.

1738
02:14:57,298 --> 02:15:01,860
You've eaten my salt!
- I'm eating your money now!

1739
02:15:02,837 --> 02:15:08,776
Even if you wear this
jewelry, what's the use?

1740
02:15:09,677 --> 02:15:11,577
Your husband is
not here to see you.

1741
02:15:13,548 --> 02:15:15,106
You shut up!
- You shut up!

1742
02:15:15,717 --> 02:15:18,049
Today, l'm right,
and you're wrong!

1743
02:15:20,789 --> 02:15:23,724
l got it, l'm vanishing.

1744
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:29,655
Shakti. Stop, or l'll shoot!

1745
02:15:29,831 --> 02:15:32,925
You, firing a gun?
Don't joke, darling!

1746
02:15:33,101 --> 02:15:36,400
Go and sit down quietly;
you can't fire that gun.

1747
02:15:36,538 --> 02:15:37,937
l'm going.

1748
02:15:44,045 --> 02:15:45,512
She fired the gun!

1749
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:15,373
Sad news! Boss, he is...

1750
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:18,741
He's dead! Sister,
what have you done?

1751
02:16:20,882 --> 02:16:25,842
This double-crosser
was stealing in my room!

1752
02:16:26,521 --> 02:16:28,318
He was giving me dirty looks!

1753
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:31,816
So l shot him down in anger!

1754
02:16:32,026 --> 02:16:34,517
You made a mistake,
but don't worry.

1755
02:16:34,596 --> 02:16:36,496
l'll find some way out.

1756
02:16:36,998 --> 02:16:39,796
B.B.C., let's bury the
corpse in the backyard.

1757
02:16:39,934 --> 02:16:41,333
Happy news. - Ok.

1758
02:16:44,272 --> 02:16:47,969
He was a very good man.
- Every dead man is good.

1759
02:17:01,723 --> 02:17:03,657
What's this?
- See, sister...

1760
02:17:04,092 --> 02:17:08,495
We got rid of the corpse;
no one but us know about it.

1761
02:17:09,097 --> 02:17:13,591
lf you want us to remain silent,
then sign on these papers.

1762
02:17:16,337 --> 02:17:18,328
Sign? For what?

1763
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:23,534
That you've given me
your entire property.

1764
02:17:23,711 --> 02:17:25,542
So, even you?

1765
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:29,307
You said you can buy
anything with money.

1766
02:17:29,584 --> 02:17:32,747
So, to escape prison,
buy both of us.

1767
02:17:32,954 --> 02:17:35,650
Our price is your entire
property and wealth.

1768
02:17:35,823 --> 02:17:38,587
Sign fast and get
rid of your trouble.

1769
02:17:40,028 --> 02:17:44,055
Without listening
to my children...

1770
02:17:44,599 --> 02:17:47,864
...l trusted you, and
gave you a luxurious life.

1771
02:17:48,436 --> 02:17:50,404
But you're betraying me
this way!

1772
02:17:52,006 --> 02:17:54,839
l can commit one more murder!

1773
02:17:55,677 --> 02:17:58,373
I won't leave you!
- Move off!

1774
02:18:03,585 --> 02:18:04,882
Ms. Durgeswari!

1775
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:07,611
We're giving you 2 minutes.

1776
02:18:08,389 --> 02:18:13,292
Sign on these papers, else...
- We'll kill you!

1777
02:18:46,427 --> 02:18:49,453
Hello. Police station.
- Sad news!

1778
02:18:49,697 --> 02:18:52,325
Yes... please come fast!

1779
02:19:10,785 --> 02:19:12,377
Why are you surprised?

1780
02:19:12,453 --> 02:19:14,011
This was constructed
with your money!

1781
02:19:14,088 --> 02:19:16,784
Sister, sign on
these papers quietly.

1782
02:19:16,858 --> 02:19:21,659
Even if l die, l won't give my
property to traitors like you!

1783
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:24,658
My property is for my
children and grandchildren!

1784
02:19:24,866 --> 02:19:29,428
ls it? Sister, when did you
start feeling such emotions?

1785
02:19:29,671 --> 02:19:33,801
She's missing her children;
show her those emotions!

1786
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:36,566
Hello! Show the emotions!

1787
02:19:42,583 --> 02:19:43,572
Show them!

1788
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:46,644
My child!

1789
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:08,370
Sister, take this pen.

1790
02:20:14,982 --> 02:20:18,679
No, don't sign on it!

1791
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:25,381
Here, take this!

1792
02:22:08,329 --> 02:22:09,353
No!

1793
02:22:10,631 --> 02:22:11,757
Leave my child!

1794
02:22:49,904 --> 02:22:51,633
Raja, look this side!

1795
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:56,701
Did you think l died?
Dogs don't die so easily!

1796
02:22:57,545 --> 02:22:58,637
l am here!

1797
02:23:03,751 --> 02:23:07,517
lf you raise your
hand, he'll do his work!

1798
02:23:37,585 --> 02:23:38,552
Finish him off!

1799
02:26:25,352 --> 02:26:26,649
Constable, the handcuffs.

1800
02:26:28,722 --> 02:26:33,352
No! No! That's not required,
l have a pair with me.

1801
02:26:33,494 --> 02:26:36,793
I stole them from Tihar jail.
- No details!

1802
02:26:36,997 --> 02:26:38,931
We're in a fix now!

1803
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:44,702
We're little, lovely children!

1804
02:26:50,277 --> 02:26:51,972
No, don't do that.

1805
02:26:53,013 --> 02:26:56,312
You and your status
are greater than me. - No.

1806
02:26:56,917 --> 02:27:01,980
My false status has come
down to its proper place.

1807
02:27:04,492 --> 02:27:05,424
My child!

1808
02:27:08,596 --> 02:27:10,496
Come, daughter-in-law,
let's go home.

1809
02:27:12,666 --> 02:27:15,567
Why did you stop
at the door? Come in.

1810
02:27:16,303 --> 02:27:20,433
l had come to see my sister
settled, not to live here.

1811
02:27:21,041 --> 02:27:24,875
l can look after your daughter
well. Isn't it, Rekha?

1812
02:27:25,546 --> 02:27:28,515
We only want your blessings.
- You have that always.

1813
02:27:28,682 --> 02:27:31,116
Please bless us.
- But, son-in-law...

1814
02:27:31,819 --> 02:27:34,344
Suppose some problem
arises after you leave?

1815
02:27:34,588 --> 02:27:36,920
Then call me, and l'll come.

1816
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:40,453
Whenever mothers-in-law
turn extremely cruel...

1817
02:27:40,995 --> 02:27:43,828
...then sons-in-law
like me take birth.
