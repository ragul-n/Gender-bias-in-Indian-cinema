1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,250
Who is she?

3
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,417
Whom am I waiting for?

4
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,083
Whom do I hope for?

5
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,334
Whose aroma of breath
exists in my breath?

6
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:06,458
In whose eyes does my life exist?

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,209
Taking whose name
did my heart beat?

8
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:15,334
"It had just come on my lips,
someone’s smile."

9
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,958
I remembered you.

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,125
"I remembered you,
I remembered you again."

11
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:54,042
"I feel that, I feel such."

12
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,416
'That this separation will kill me.

13
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:11,084
"This separation, this
separation will kill me."

14
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:39,375
"O Come, please come,
Love calls you."

15
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:46,875
You wont be able to
live forgetting my loyalty.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,416
I cant see anything else.

17
00:02:55,292 --> 00:03:02,917
"I cant see anything else,
only you exist in my eyes."

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,333
Only you exist in my eyes.

19
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:15,000
"You exist, you exist,
only you exist in my eyes."

20
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:32,750
"You don’t come, but your
memories linger, O beloved."

21
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,084
"How do I tell you,
how they make me cry!"

22
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:47,875
Now I can hear...

23
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:56,375
Now I hear heartbeats in silence.

24
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,917
I can hear heartbeats.

25
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:08,042
"I hear heartbeats,
I hear heartbeats."

26
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:16,792
"I remember you,
I remember you again."

27
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,000
I feel that...

28
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:36,167
"I feel that, this
separation will kill me."

29
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:43,959
"This separation, this
separation will kill me."

30
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:49,042
"I remembered you,
I remembered you."

31
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:54,416
I remembered you again!

32
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,375
So all of you had
planned this together?

33
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,959
"Not all of us, only Janhvi."

34
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,000
For your success.

35
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:20,917
I have a surprise
for the three of you.

36
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:26,875
"Sharad, Shikha, and
of course Satin."

37
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,458
Do you know Sameer?

38
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,125
The people were talking
more about this mannequin...

39
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,917
...and this dress than
the models at tonight’s show.

40
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,125
"Janhvi, I make all
my designs keeping..."

41
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,250
...in mind the fashion
market and my own ideas.

42
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,250
"This is such a design,
which I have made with my heart."

43
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,083
For whom?
- I don’t know.

44
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,917
"Who is she, where is she?"

45
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:02,125
Have you never
tried to search for her?

46
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,250
Maybe she is somewhere
nearby you.

47
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,917
I will not search for her.

48
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:11,166
"Janhvi, if this dress is
incomplete without her then..."

49
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,917
"...be assured, she is incomplete
without this dress too."

50
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,166
"May it not happen, that both stay..."

51
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,959
"...incomplete,
waiting for each other."

52
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,917
No. That wont happen.

53
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,250
Do you have faith?

54
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,417
"Yes. Didn’t you just say,
that she must be nearby?"

55
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,417
"Do you know? When you
smile like this, then..."

56
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,333
Then...?
- Nothing.

57
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,041
I am the one who has to marry.
Why do you keep worrying?

58
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,458
I know that you are
the one who has to marry.

59
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,917
And you have
selected the boy too. But...

60
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:46,250
"But what, Papa,
don’t you like Sameer?"

61
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,458
"I like him very much, but
this is my permanent question."

62
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,250
Does he like you?

63
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,417
"I like her, Mother. I like Janhvi.
She is a very good girl."

64
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,917
"But she is my friend,
just my friend."

65
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,125
If you make
friendship with everyone...

66
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,291
...who are you going to marry?

67
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,834
Tell me?

68
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,834
The one whom I will love.

69
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:46,291
How and when I fell in love?

70
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,959
With you my beloved?

71
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,125
"My heart is asking me,
whether I should..."

72
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:58,291
...call you my
friend or my beloved.

73
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:24,500
I don’t get any sleep now.

74
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,125
My heartbeats torture
me every moment.

75
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,916
Why am I restless every moment?

76
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:43,417
Why does my anklet
ring every moment?

77
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:46,875
"You don’t know, my love,
I’ve become crazy."

78
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,500
"How much ever I love you,
I feel it is less."

79
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,083
My lips sing your
rhythm every moment.

80
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,459
I get very frightened
traveling alone in a plane.

81
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,292
"Listen, cant you
send me to Delhi by boat?"

82
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,250
"Hey, you don’t know what kind of..."

83
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,250
...people travel in planes nowadays.

84
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,916
See how my heart is beating faster.

85
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,250
Call me up as soon
as you reach there.

86
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,250
I will call you.
I will certainly call you.

87
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,250
"If I reach there, I
will certainly call you."

88
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,167
You don’t know. In some airlines...

89
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,041
...the pilots themselves
are terrorists.

90
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,958
If someone hijacks me...

91
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,875
Then we will send
him a thank you card.

92
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,375
As soon as you reach Chandigarh...

93
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,500
...you have to send the
photographs of the models.

94
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And the fabric that Sameer had...

95
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,417
"...shown, don’t
forget to search for it."

96
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,250
And then Simla.
- Simla!

97
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,041
"The show is in Simla,
not in Chandigarh."

98
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,459
And you have to
meet a client there too.

99
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,916
I will not talk to you.

100
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,916
I remembered when you said talk.

101
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,459
Give me the number of the
hotel where you are staying.

102
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,292
Where should I hang?

103
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,875
Give me the number.

104
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,958
"Yes, we will reach soon."

105
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,916
"Mummy, aunty hit me."

106
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:43,250
Aunty hit me? Come.
- Your dad must be an aunt.

107
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,459
Satin is very funny like that.

108
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,916
What happened?

109
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,875
Pani
- Puri!

110
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,916
"Hey, you come too. Who
will pay the bill otherwise?"

111
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,042
Two Pani-Puri.
- Yes madam.

112
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:04,292
"I have made friends with you,
so I will have to tolerate it."

113
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,042
Here.

114
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:10,167
"Child, the lines on your forehead..."

115
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,916
...show that your fate is very good.

116
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:17,250
"I show the present, past and
the future in hundred rupees."

117
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,417
Isn’t hundred rupees a
bit less for showing all that?

118
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,292
"Sameer, don’t joke."

119
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,542
"He’s not joking, he is immature."

120
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,208
"Looking at you, I can
say that you are..."

121
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,292
...connected to the cloth business.

122
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,208
And you have got all this name and...

123
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,459
...fame because of beautiful clothes.

124
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,250
Yes. That’s right.

125
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,208
You have an
imagination in your mind.

126
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,250
It is an unclear picture.
Your mind is restless.

127
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,916
It is worried since many years.

128
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,916
"That whose is this statue,
whose face cant be seen?"

129
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,250
The statue that you love so much...

130
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,042
...in whose passion
your mind has wandered off!

131
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:54,167
"Today, on the auspicious
night of the Full Moon day..."

132
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,167
"...at 12 O’clock, when the
full moon will be in the sky..."

133
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:01,459
...you will be
with your beloved then.

134
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,292
"What happened, Sharad?"

135
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:30,375
"Nothing, I was just... I
was just watching you. - What?"

136
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,125
"When you laugh, you look
very beautiful and innocent."

137
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,250
What’s the matter? You
are in a poetic mood today?

138
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,250
Its only one day in the
year when I am in such a mood.

139
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,042
Only once in one year...
Today’s your birthday!

140
00:15:55,917 --> 00:16:00,917
Sameer! - Shikha here. We
met an astrologer today. - What?

141
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:04,833
Its very important for you
to be with Sameer at 12 tonight.

142
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,250
"I don’t know why, but I believe
that astrologers prediction."

143
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,500
I am meeting him in some time.

144
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,167
The both of us are going for dinner.

145
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,250
We will be together at 12.

146
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,500
If what you said is true then...

147
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,125
"It will certainly be true.
I’m saying it, isn’t it?"

148
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,958
I have to get ready.

149
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,209
"Sameer, are you playing?"

150
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,459
"No, I’m painting.
Will you model for me?"

151
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,958
Its good that you came.
You and Shikha...

152
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,917
...get ready for
tomorrows presentation

153
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,917
Tomorrows campaign
is very complicated.

154
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,917
"Sameer, the meeting
is not tomorrow."

155
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,917
Its today. At 10 O’clock.

156
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,917
The client has just called me.

157
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,541
Today? At 10 O’clock?
An hour from now?

158
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,125
And you are telling this to me now?

159
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,917
I have already made a
dinner plan with Janhvi.

160
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,042
I am the only one who
will have to the meeting.

161
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,917
"Yes, Sam."

162
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,791
The folder is ready. I
will bring it right now.

163
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:24,125
I am noticing that you are
distracted since some days.

164
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,417
There’s a very important meeting...

165
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:43,917
...and its very
important for me to go.

166
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,917
Sameer. You had promised me!

167
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:47,958
I know that I had promised you.

168
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,292
Therefore I’m apologizing.

169
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:55,125
"We will definitely go tomorrow.
And listen, hello!"

170
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,958
This battery had to
get over at such a time!

171
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,084
I had to call Satin too.

172
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,292
And this battery’s over too.

173
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,167
Whom do you wish to speak to?

174
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,167
This is a wrong number.

175
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,541
Wrong number? Please don’t joke.

176
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,583
"Don’t cut the phone, answer him!"

177
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,833
"This is not a hotel,
this is a hostel."

178
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,917
And many people like you call here...

179
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,333
...who wish to speak to girls under...

180
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,917
...the excuse of wrong numbers.

181
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:38,000
"I have to talk very urgently,
you don’t joke..."

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,250
Joke? You are very impudent.

183
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,917
"Didn’t I tell you once,
that this is a wrong number?"

184
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,000
Its okay if its a wrong number.

185
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,333
But your voice is right.
What name do people...

186
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,042
...call the mistress of
such a beautiful voice?

187
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,416
What? What do you mean?

188
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,333
It seems that God
has not given you...

189
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,917
...either good ears or a good tongue.

190
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,541
I asked you your name.

191
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,250
You have come to the
crux of the matter now.

192
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,209
"You will ask my
name first, and then..."

193
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,958
"If you tell me your name,
then I will ask anything else."

194
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,375
"Mr. Wrong Number,
this style of flirting..."

195
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,042
...of yours is very old and absurd.

196
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,042
"Miss Wrong Number, which
style do you like? Tell me."

197
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,541
You have excellent impudence!

198
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,375
You have heard so much and yet...

199
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,959
...you have not disconnected the line.

200
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,541
"Excuse me, Miss Wrong Number."

201
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,250
Even you have not
disconnected the phone yet.

202
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,959
Me! Why should I
disconnect the line?

203
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,416
"You have called up, so you
should disconnect the line."

204
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:31,708
"You will disconnect the
line now, Miss Wrong Number."

205
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,125
"Muskaan, Sweta, Rita, Pooja."

206
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,959
I have told you so many times.

207
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:23,042
The phone in the lobby is for
your use. Not for your misuse!

208
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:27,167
"When we misses use it,
it will be miss-used."

209
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:31,084
Who was that? Whose voice was this?

210
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:36,500
"I am scolding you,
and you are making fun?"

211
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,250
I know that your boy friends
call on that phone every night.

212
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,917
All this at this age!

213
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,917
So should we wait
till we attain your age?

214
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:50,708
"Impudent! Who was this?
You, you or you?"

215
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:56,333
"Maam, you know that
only my mom phones me here."

216
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,250
And that too only once a month.

217
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,917
Okay.

218
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,167
I have decided that from today...

219
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:06,250
...I shall make rounds
near that phone every night.

220
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,959
What’s the gain? Who will call you?

221
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,542
It seems that I will
have to complaint...

222
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,834
...against you to the principal!

223
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,959
Sameer! Sameer!

224
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,125
"Sameer, are you sleeping?"

225
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,291
"No, I’m playing football,
will you play with me?"

226
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,250
I slept while playing.

227
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,458
He speaks rubbish
with me every time.

228
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,042
Satin had called up yesterday.

229
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:44,166
I don’t know which
number he had given me.

230
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,917
Therefore he had called.

231
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:48,917
Delhi’s number is 2692365.

232
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:52,084
Maybe he gave you 56 by mistake.

233
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:56,166
"That means that our
number was wrong, and I..."

234
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,416
Who must be calling
so late in the night?

235
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:04,917
Hello!

236
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,917
"What is the problem,
why did you call now?"

237
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,917
"Please say that you
forgave me, just once."

238
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,542
What difference will that make?

239
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:13,917
We don’t even know each other.

240
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,959
Therefore I’m apologizing.

241
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,250
"If we ever meet in this life,
I wont be ashamed."

242
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,208
Meeting? You are
thinking about too far

243
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,959
Cant we be friends?

244
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,208
I don’t know.

245
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:29,458
"I have heard, when girls say
don’t know, it means yes."

246
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,125
It can be that I will
want to phone you tomorrow.

247
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:35,125
Otherwise how will
this friendship move ahead?

248
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,792
I understood. Please
write down my number.

249
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,333
You have spoken and I have heard it.

250
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,417
But I didn’t write it.

251
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,125
Its good that you didn’t write it.

252
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,333
Otherwise I would have
waited for your call unnecessarily.

253
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,917
It is too late in the night and...

254
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:53,166
"Before saying good night,
can I ask you something? - Yes."

255
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,250
What is your name?

256
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,417
"I cant lie to you, and I don’t
have the guts to tell the truth."

257
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:03,542
You are scared?
- Yes. Of myself.

258
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:09,959
"I wont ask your name,
till you say it yourself."

259
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,375
Say something else.

260
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,208
"Nothing for now, tomorrow."

261
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,959
I like tall boys.
- Tall!

262
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:30,917
"I don’t like tall boys. Yes,
they should have medium height."

263
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,917
But they should look very fit.

264
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:35,125
He should not wear glasses.

265
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,291
"Otherwise, it will seem that there..."

266
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,917
...are classes going
on even in the house.

267
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,917
I don’t have any
problems with glasses.

268
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,917
"When I fall in love, III
see to it that he is matured."

269
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,917
"Muskaan, why don’t
you say something too?"

270
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
I wont fall in love ever.

271
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,083
"Even then, you must
be having some liking."

272
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,083
What kind of a boy
friend do you wish?

273
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,917
You are speaking about looks.

274
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:58,500
But I think that one falls in
love not with a persons face...

275
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,208
"...but with a persons soul. It
is a feeling, which is inside us."

276
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,000
That means that he
can look like anything.

277
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,917
It doesn’t matter to you?

278
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:11,500
"Even if I have not seen him,
what difference does it make?"

279
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,917
"Sameer, are you thinking?"

280
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:27,792
"No, I’m eating, will you eat too?"

281
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,917
This Indian beauty
that we are designing.

282
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,917
The color scheme of the dress...

283
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,125
...we need time to think about it.

284
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,917
And time is what we don’t have.

285
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,792
There is a presentation at
exactly 9 O’clock tomorrow.

286
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:49,292
Such a dress that’s
like my heart or my mind.

287
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,917
I got it.
- What?

288
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:01,792
The color scheme will
come from where this dress has.

289
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,917
I was just leaving after waiting.

290
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:10,166
And I was waiting to leave.

291
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,500
Whose leaving were you waiting for?

292
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,250
"Tell me, how are you?"

293
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,375
"I am all right. You tell me,
how is your poetry going on?"

294
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,916
My poem is the poem
of a girls beauty.

295
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,083
The beauty of her body and mind.

296
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,916
This should radiate in
her clothes and her look.

297
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,166
What is so difficult in that?

298
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,875
You are a poet. Write it down.

299
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,916
"When a beautiful Indian woman,"

300
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,000
...wishes to look
the most beautiful...

301
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,916
"...she will dress beautifully,
and wear beautiful clothes."

302
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,916
Just like you had said yesterday.

303
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:43,292
But what should the color be?

304
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,500
"Muskaan, you had promised that..."

305
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,333
...you would go to the
movies with us today.

306
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:31,417
Films and me?

307
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,417
"See, we are so
happy today, and then..."

308
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,166
"Sameer, the whole
plan has been made."

309
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,250
Film first and then dinner.

310
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,916
It will be very late
by the time we return.

311
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:41,916
"I mean, I have a headache."

312
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,916
"I have a headache,
I don’t get sleep."

313
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,916
I don’t know what
has happened to me.

314
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:46,916
Its not that.

315
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,458
That’s the thing. Therefore
we friends are being driven away.

316
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,916
"Do you know that if you
don’t go, even Janhvi wont go?"

317
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:53,916
That leaves the two of us.

318
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:57,458
So what will the both of us do?

319
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,292
"Come, We wont have
any fun without you."

320
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,125
Let it be. She wont come.

321
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,958
"In a strangers romance,
known people..."

322
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:08,792
...are seldom remembered

323
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,792
"Okay, come."

324
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,916
I’m outside the hostel.

325
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,916
"Outside, that’s nice."

326
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,250
Yes. I’ve come to see a movie.

327
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,250
I thought that you would call me.

328
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,000
Film? Even I’m
going to watch a film.

329
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,167
Which one?

330
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:30,125
The one which has recently released.

331
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,916
"Yes, that’s the one."

332
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,916
I am going for that movie too.

333
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34,916
Alone?

334
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,916
No. With my friends. Can I go now?

335
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,916
My friends are waiting for me.

336
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,417
"Okay, just a minute.
What is your seat number?"

337
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:47,750
"Okay. Sit on B-7,
because III be sitting on B-8."

338
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,958
"But, someone else
will be sitting on B-8."

339
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,125
None will be there.
You’ll see. B-8 will be empty.

340
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,459
Its not possible.

341
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,958
And what if its possible?

342
00:28:55,958 --> 00:29:01,500
"If B-8 is empty, think that
I’m watching the movie with you."

343
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,250
While sleeping and waking.

344
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,250
While laughing and singing

345
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,333
"Lonely sometimes, and
while coming and leaving."

346
00:29:55,333 --> 00:30:00,167
"The heart starts to beat,
without any reason."

347
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:10,417
Is this called love?

348
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:11,042
"I stop somewhere,
and I walk off somewhere."

349
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,417
The world thinks
that I have become crazy.

350
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:21,958
Even I don’t know what I wish.

351
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:27,042
"What is my wish, what do I think?"

352
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:32,791
"Sometimes on the road,
sometimes while walking."

353
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,375
Even my love has become thirsty.

354
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:42,833
"My heart starts to beat,
without any reason."

355
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,250
Is this called love?

356
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:27,833
A face is in my thoughts.

357
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:32,750
"I am its lover, it says secretly."

358
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:38,209
"What my state it, who knows it?"

359
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:43,791
I don’t know my own restlessness.

360
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,459
Sometimes in Loneliness
and sometimes in a crowd.

361
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,042
Who will come to
search for the destination?

362
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,000
"My heart starts to beat,
without any reason."

363
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:04,791
Is this called love?

364
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:21,292
I never got anyone’s love.
Not even of my own parents.

365
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,958
"But whoever he is,
it seems he is my own."

366
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,458
But I have not told
my name to him yet.

367
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,125
I wish that he
should be close to me...

368
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,458
...but he should never come near me.

369
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,458
My fate frightens me.

370
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,917
"What if he comes to meet me,
after knowing my name?"

371
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,458
And what if fate separates us?

372
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:49,458
"No. I will not tell him
my name, nor will I ask his."

373
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:54,000
I don’t want to
lose what I have got.

374
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:58,875
"Sameer, Sameer! What is the matter?"

375
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,250
You don’t even talk
to me on the phone.

376
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,125
"I’m busy, I will call later."

377
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:09,833
"Janhvi, there was an urgent
assignment. I was busy in that."

378
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,917
You have always been working.

379
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,250
But you have never
avoided me in such a way.

380
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,250
"Avoid? Janhvi, God
knows what you think up!"

381
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,875
And you don’t think at all!

382
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:26,541
I am thinking nowadays.
I keep on thinking.

383
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,250
What? Wont you tell me?

384
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,000
I myself don’t know.
What do I tell you then?

385
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,375
What do you not know?
Say something Sameer.

386
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:41,250
"I think that I’ve fallen in love.
It feels strange, doesn’t it?"

387
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,833
Even I don’t believe it.

388
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,334
Whom do you not have faith on?

389
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:49,250
On yourself or on your love?

390
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,250
On her. I don’t know if she too...

391
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,917
Its easy. Ask her and see.

392
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:58,917
"No, I am scared,
What if she rejects me?"

393
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,917
She wont. Please ask.

394
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,042
Not now. After a few days.

395
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,917
Why not right now?
Please ask right now.

396
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,250
You will get the answer.

397
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,250
She loves you too
- What are you doing here?

398
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,333
"Were swimming, will you learn?"

399
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,917
III take this
problem away from here.

400
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:24,416
Then III see how she will talk.

401
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,167
Leave it. Why are you
worrying so much for that phone?

402
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,333
If you don’t speak
with that wrong number...

403
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,875
"...for a few days, what will happen?"

404
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,917
What will happen?
Nothing will happen.

405
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,250
Rest of them will also call.

406
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,667
"Muskaan, you’re in love
and with that wrong number."

407
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,209
"The one I don’t know, never
seen him before... - I’ve heard it."

408
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:46,917
I’ve seen it. There
is no logic for love.

409
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:51,209
And you only said there you
can love a spirit and soul.

410
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:55,792
And spirit and
soul do not see faces.

411
00:36:56,917 --> 00:37:01,250
I don’t know how much you’re
right for what you’re saying.

412
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,042
But its true that I
eagerly wait to talk to him.

413
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:11,917
My life is just like
limited to this phone.

414
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:16,375
"When I speak to him, it
feels like has someone close."

415
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,917
What happened?
I’m trying since when.

416
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,959
"There were some problems,
but now everything is fine."

417
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,500
My poem is completed.

418
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,875
"Really, then lets listen to it."

419
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,875
I wont say it like this.
- Then how will you say it?

420
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,917
By asking you to promise me.

421
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,917
"You wont ask my name, would you?"

422
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:44,917
No. - Then what kind
of promise do you want?

423
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:48,792
I want to hear my poem by you.

424
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:58,000
"Darling, hiding away.
Hiding away from the whole world."

425
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,917
You said something
that my heart is lost.

426
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:13,042
Darling!

427
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:26,917
"Darling, hiding away."

428
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:31,125
Hiding away from the whole world.

429
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:40,708
You said something
that my heart is lost.

430
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:10,250
"Darling, hiding away.
Hiding away from the whole world."

431
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:20,792
You said something
that my heart is lost.

432
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don’t know when love happened.

433
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,875
I accepted you my beloved.

434
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:39,708
"Darling, hiding away.
Hiding away from the whole world."

435
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:44,708
You said something
that my heart is lost.

436
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:47,917
I don’t know when love happened.

437
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:52,792
I accepted you my beloved.

438
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:26,792
Your every smile has
such great magic in it.

439
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:44,333
"Without seeing you,
your admirer is out of control."

440
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,708
Even I can feel you every moment.

441
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,917
I swear by you.

442
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:05,083
"In the arms of this weather,
on the unknown paths."

443
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:15,917
You said something
that my heart is lost.

444
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,959
I don’t know when love happened.

445
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:23,834
I accepted you my beloved.

446
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:10,917
"I only wrote about you darling,
every day and night."

447
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:29,750
"On every heartbeat I’ve been
in restlessness, I wrote your name."

448
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:35,709
"I cant live, separated from you."

449
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:44,709
"I cant live, separated
from you, oh darling."

450
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:48,250
In gardens and in barren lands.

451
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,958
You came and
whispered in my ears.

452
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,709
You said something
that my heart is lost.

453
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,916
I don’t know when love happened.

454
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:09,792
I accepted you my beloved.

455
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,375
"Sameer, we have to prepare
for the meeting in evening."

456
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,542
We have to give the
final touches to the designs.

457
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,916
Even the color scheme
has to be prepared.

458
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:24,833
"Sameer, the meetings
is at 8 o’clock and..."

459
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:31,833
"Hold on a second,
III give it to Sameer."

460
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,916
"Yes Satin. - Everything
is ready, come to Simla."

461
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:42,125
"Okay, III arrive in two days."

462
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,250
"Listen to me, why don’t you
come to Simla for tour with us?"

463
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:00,292
This inter college dance
competition are always like picnic.

464
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:03,333
"Do you know, Shweta? Its
been more than 3 years..."

465
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:07,375
...since I met father. And
more than year since I met mother.

466
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,916
And only these 15 days has free.

467
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:11,916
Otherwise he is on
his business tours...

468
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,250
...or busy in his office meetings.

469
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,500
"Yes, know that. After
you parents divorced you..."

470
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,916
I’ve been leaving like an orphan.

471
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:22,083
Now this hostel is my home.

472
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,916
Even though I have parents
but they don’t exist for me.

473
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:28,916
"And that wrong number, have
you told her that you’re leaving?"

474
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:32,250
"Every time I thought I would
say it to him, but I couldn’t."

475
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,916
If its possible then
meet him once before leaving.

476
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:38,916
"I don’t know Shweta,
I’m scared about this."

477
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:43,459
Not love but
there’s still a little hope.

478
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:48,208
I’m living in a fantasy.
This hope can also be a lie.

479
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:54,916
And this hope has now
become the support of my life.

480
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:59,916
If this falls apart then I
don’t know how I will bare.

481
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:04,125
"Go it must be him calling,
go talk to him."

482
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,916
Fine and you?

483
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,083
I absolutely fine.

484
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,916
Your voice is the
mirror of your heart.

485
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,916
And now this mirror
shows that you’re not happy.

486
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:20,000
I’m leaving town... I’m going
out of this country for 15 days.

487
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,916
"Yes, to my father."

488
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,334
Even I was leaving for
15 days to go someplace.

489
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:29,875
But got troubled thinking
how to tell you about it.

490
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,958
Now?

491
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:36,750
Now what? Simple.
Well talk after 15 days.

492
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,916
"We wont talk, well
meet after 15 days. - Meet?"

493
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,916
We don’t know any
thing about each other.

494
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,916
We don’t even know
each others names.

495
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:50,916
Because from the start
it was just a joke for us.

496
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,000
But now its not a joke anymore.

497
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,958
That’s why we have to
meet and make a decision.

498
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:00,083
What decision?

499
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:04,958
I’ve already decided. Just
Want to tell it after meeting you.

500
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:09,916
Really? - Absolutely.
This is my promise.

501
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,125
But you’re breaking your promise.

502
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:15,083
Remember I had told you one day...

503
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:20,292
...there shouldn’t be tears in
your eyes but a smile on your face.

504
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,000
You are going so far away from me.

505
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,916
"I’m going far away, but
when ever you close your eyes..."

506
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:31,916
...and think of me then
you’ll know that I’m close to you.

507
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:34,167
Very close to you.

508
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,375
"15 days, that means 1st of January."

509
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:42,208
"1st Jan, 6 o’clock in the evening,
at India Gate, well meet."

510
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,542
"Muskaan, have you
finished your packing?"

511
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,459
Yes. Ill take a taxi
and leave for the airport.

512
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:58,334
"Has you bus arrived?
- Yes, its here."

513
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,542
You reach to the airport
and take my boarding pass.

514
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,958
Ill just meet my
mother and come back.

515
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,958
"Jaanvi is also coming
at airport, isn’t she?"

516
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:08,500
Shell pick me up at home.

517
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,833
Madam there’s a call for you.

518
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,958
"Dear Muskaan, its papa here."

519
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:20,209
"Yes, papa. I was just leaving."

520
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:22,541
I thought I should tell
you this when you’re coming.

521
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,250
"Dear Muskaan, I’m getting
married day after tomorrow."

522
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:29,000
You’re getting married?
Even mom got married again.

523
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,042
You two were married
just to give me birth?

524
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:34,917
Since I was seven I’ve
been living in this hostel.

525
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:37,083
And your best support was that...

526
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,500
...you kept sending
drafts to me every month.

527
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,917
"Daughter, you’re a grown
up now you should understand."

528
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:45,917
"You were right, papa,
and so was mother."

529
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,334
I should have understood earlier...

530
00:50:47,334 --> 00:50:53,042
...that 12 years ago you
people had disowned me.

531
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:57,917
It was me who just hoped
for a little love from you.

532
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:03,083
"But not this time. From today,
I disown you and mother both."

533
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,958
And yes congratulation
for your marriage.

534
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,958
But if you want to
divorce her too then...

535
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:15,833
...please don’t give
birth to another Muskaan.

536
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:26,084
I don’t want tears in your
eyes but a smile on your face.

537
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:22,167
We wouldn’t need for 15 days.

538
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:33,084
I’m tired of this cold.

539
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,084
For a whole week
traveling from Delhi to Simla...

540
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:39,291
...and Simla to Delhi my health is...

541
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,959
And the people who live here.
6 feet and 6 inches tall...

542
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:46,333
"...handsome youth. Oh, God
only I know how I survived."

543
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:51,792
"Samir, stop at some restaurant.
I’m hungry."

544
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,917
There are no restaurants
around here madam...

545
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:57,917
...only road side inns.

546
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,917
The bus will halt
here for half hour.

547
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:03,333
"Whoever wants to
have lunch, have it."

548
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,917
The bus will not wait after that.

549
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,000
"Come on lets have lunch.
- No, I’m not hungry."

550
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,917
"Welcome madam, your
five star road side inn."

551
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:15,333
Lets have some gravy of
spinach and Lassi with froth.

552
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,959
"You guys eat, I’m not hungry."

553
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:31,833
I’ve already decided. Just
want to tell it after meeting you.

554
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,959
"I’m going far away, but
when ever you close your eyes..."

555
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:48,458
...and think of me then
you’ll know that I’m close to you.

556
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,875
"My hands are oily, yucks."

557
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,875
Here take my handkerchief.

558
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,875
"No way, you’ve wiped your
nose with the same kerchief."

559
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,875
III bring it from the car.

560
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,875
Wiping your nose and
giving the kerchief to me.

561
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:55,084
Where did Kamo take my heart?

562
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,917
"Satin, what happened?"

563
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:11,917
"Now back it up.
A little bit left, I said left."

564
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,917
You dashed the car.

565
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:18,084
"What happened? - Sir,
the radiator blew up."

566
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:20,250
And the fan belt is also broken.

567
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,917
What do you mean? - It means
that this car cant go ahead.

568
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:26,792
Now what?

569
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,084
Now well go in this bus.

570
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,875
"I she a flower, is she,
the sun rays..."

571
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:48,250
...or is she a story.

572
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,291
"More I see her, the
more I think of her..."

573
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:55,875
"...then I would say to
her with love, pretty woman."

574
00:56:55,875 --> 00:57:00,875
"Pretty woman, say something."

575
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,125
"Its moving, its moving."

576
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:09,750
The wind of love... Its moving.

577
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:14,959
"Excuse me, cant you look at front?"

578
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:18,333
There is no need for excuses.

579
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:21,917
"Listen, say something else. - What?"

580
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:24,917
I thought that I have
heard your voice before.

581
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:29,208
"Listen, this is the worst way of
starting a conversation with a girl."

582
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,250
What do you need? -

583
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,083
Just a minute.

584
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,041
"Come on fast, everyone.
We have reached Simla."

585
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:08,792
"Come fast, move everyone."

586
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:22,292
"Hail Goddess, sir. Tell me,
how can I serve you?"

587
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,417
I need four rooms.

588
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:31,917
"Sir, I understand you well."

589
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:36,125
My elder brother says if
you want to eat fresh meat...

590
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:39,916
...then make
friends with the butcher.

591
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:44,125
If some one wants fresh
milk then have a cow at home.

592
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,333
If you want to eat fresh eggs then...

593
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:54,916
...rear country chicken in your home.

594
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:59,125
"But I don’t want to eat meat,
or drink milk or eat eggs."

595
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:02,958
I want to rest. I’m tired. We
need four rooms in the hotel.

596
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:07,916
But in today’s world
we don’t get fresh meat...

597
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:10,584
...or fresh milk or fresh eggs.

598
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:17,250
Are you deaf?
Cant you hear?

599
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:24,916
I want four rooms in this hotel.

600
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:29,000
"Then why are you screaming, sir."

601
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,916
"You need four rooms,
then you’ll get it."

602
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:34,916
What’s the big deal about it?

603
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:39,709
Just sign on the register.
When a beautiful woman...

604
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:44,125
"...walks out that door, pay to
her and your work will be done."

605
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,916
By accident?! You are saying that...

606
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:51,250
...whatever happened was an accident.

607
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,166
Definitely no. He started
his misbehavior from the bus.

608
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:57,916
"Okay dear, he misbehaved
and you punished him..."

609
01:00:57,916 --> 01:01:00,792
"...now forget him, pal."

610
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:05,292
If has lucky then
hell not meet me again.

611
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:08,292
What is your name?

612
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,958
What is your name?

613
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:16,958
You are absolutely right.
In our days...

614
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:21,417
...politicians used to look good.
They were beautiful.

615
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:26,083
They really had some fans.
People use to really love them.

616
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,958
"I asked, what’s your
name, your name?"

617
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:31,916
Yes. Today politicians
look like road side crooks...

618
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:35,333
...with their big
beards and dark glasses.

619
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,584
"No body loves them,
people spit on them."

620
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:40,250
"I asked, what’s your name?"

621
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:45,709
"Why are you screaming, sir? I just
keep on blabbering for time pass."

622
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:50,041
"By the way, my name
is Karan Veer. - What?"

623
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:54,916
Its a secret word.

624
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:58,083
But people call me K.P.

625
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:03,125
Understood. Only this was left.

626
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,417
He has come here too!

627
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:14,958
"Sir, would like to
have something to drink?"

628
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:19,083
No. But you can iron this for me.

629
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:26,750
"No, sir. I cant take this
as tip. I don’t even wear it."

630
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:31,833
Cash would do fine.

631
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:36,875
I’m not giving you a tip.
I’m telling you to iron it.

632
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,916
Ironing?

633
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:43,709
"Okay sir, then III tip... Ill
will iron it tip-top and come."

634
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:51,083
I think even he cant hear well.

635
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,916
He didn’t even hear
any thing about a tip.

636
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:58,333
I’ve to do something special
about him. That deaf guy!

637
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:13,292
Are you fond of
wearing boys jeans?!

638
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,958
You should have at
least told that poor thing...

639
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,958
...that his jeans is burnt.

640
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:23,958
"Insolent fellow! He has
Eyes, he can see it for himself."

641
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:28,958
But if didn’t see it
then that would be fun.

642
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:57,958
"Sameer, your jeans."

643
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:22,875
"Shikha, just give me a hand,
and just walk behind me."

644
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:39,083
This is the opening walk.

645
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:45,875
In the morning the waiter
left my clothes in her room.

646
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,042
This must have
been done by that girl.

647
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:50,916
"Sameer, its also possible
that staff must have... - No."

648
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:55,208
This was done by that girl.
Didn’t you see the girl smile?

649
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,875
"Shikha, now III
teach this girl a lesson."

650
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:01,584
"I am telling you, we will
try it once, it will be fun."

651
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,000
Even I have heard
about this echo point.

652
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,916
We have reached. This is that point.

653
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,083
You say first.

654
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:13,292
"Shweta... - Is a mad girl, bad girl."

655
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:19,000
"Is this an echo point? Its
telling me mad girl, bad girl."

656
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
But first time I came...?

657
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,125
"Come we will try
once more, come, come."

658
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,125
Okay.

659
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:32,250
"Muskaan... - Is a mad girl, bad girl."

660
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:36,459
"Done with trying,
whole mood is spoiled."

661
01:05:36,459 --> 01:05:39,791
"Come, lets go from here."

662
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:54,875
"Maddy, your walk is
the opening of my show."

663
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,417
"I don’t want a stylish walk,
I need a simple walk."

664
01:05:57,417 --> 01:06:01,459
"Satin, tell her
about the opening walk."

665
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:08,417
"Cut, cut, its not happening, Satin."

666
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:12,083
This girl will not be able to do it.

667
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:20,000
"Hey guys, there are bells too,
you come, there will be a lot of fun."

668
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,791
"Lovely crowd, superb guys,
I’m telling you."

669
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,209
You will have fun.

670
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,417
"I cant sing, today
I am not in a mood..."

671
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:38,459
...today I don’t want to sing at all.

672
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:44,958
The girl who does not
have the manners to speak.

673
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:47,958
How can she sing?

674
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:18,708
"Beloved, secretly
from the whole world."

675
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:35,666
"He said something,
that my heart is lost."

676
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:41,708
"I don’t know when I fell
in love, and accepted it too."

677
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:23,708
"He does not understand,
nor know, how much I love him."

678
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:40,708
I will give my life for his love.

679
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:46,708
He is immature and unknowing.

680
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:55,750
"He is immature and unknowing,
what can I do?"

681
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:59,792
"From parties to Loneliness,
to the shadows of the dreams."

682
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:12,750
"He said something,
that I lost my heart."

683
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:18,750
"I don’t know when I fell
in love, and accepted it too."

684
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:57,750
"He rejected love, what
sort of a crazy person is he?"

685
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:05,750
He is still unknown
to my sorrow and pain.

686
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:11,750
"How to bear this distance,
how to say anything?"

687
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:20,750
"How to bear this distance, how
to say anything? Tell me, friend."

688
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:26,750
"From my heart beat to
my breaths, from my promises."

689
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:32,000
"He said something,
that I lost my heart."

690
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:38,042
"I don’t know when I fell
in love, and accepted it too."

691
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,959
What are you doing?

692
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:27,959
"15. 15 days, now I get it."

693
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:32,208
"You’re waiting for the 16th day,
when you’ll meet him and see him."

694
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,917
"Tell me one thing,
if your wrong number..."

695
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,917
"...turns out to be short,
fat and bald then?"

696
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:40,000
He must be for some one else.

697
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,333
"But for me, however he maybe,
hell the most..."

698
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:48,792
...beautiful person
in the whole world.

699
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,917
You played the piano so well.

700
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:06,917
"I’ve learned it from you,
just a while ago."

701
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:09,792
Will you teach me?

702
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:14,250
"Yes, III teach you but its not
that easy. It’ll take lots of time."

703
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:20,166
"Anand, son, are you
troubling the uncle?"

704
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:24,542
"No. - No. Now Sam is my
best friend, right Sam?"

705
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:28,959
III just bring lots
of chocolates for you.

706
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:31,875
He’s a very sweet kid.
He plays the piano well.

707
01:12:31,875 --> 01:12:34,208
In a year or two
I think hell be an expert.

708
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:38,750
In a year or two... I don’t know.

709
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:41,917
Did I say something wrong?

710
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:44,917
No. You have said nothing wrong.

711
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:49,375
In year or two
Anand will not be with us.

712
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:52,917
Anand has a hole in his heart.
I’ve shown him to...

713
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:55,917
...every doctors in
the world but no results.

714
01:12:55,917 --> 01:13:01,000
Doctors say that the maximum
he can live is for one month.

715
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:06,416
"Sam, this is for you."

716
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:55,917
See my timing. She almost...

717
01:13:55,917 --> 01:14:01,458
I saw yours and also hers.
She balanced so well.

718
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:08,125
"Hey Satin, I found the
opening walk of the show."

719
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,875
You dance very well.
These are for you.

720
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,375
I can make others dance too.

721
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:47,792
And people like you...
- See Miss Muskaan.

722
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:56,166
I never accept friendship from
strangers and gifts from enemies.

723
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:04,917
Well not be strangers
nor well be enemies.

724
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,000
"Shweta, he and his sample
friends have insulted me in..."

725
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
...such a way that
III do something that...

726
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,208
...they’ll remember
who they dealt with.

727
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,917
Is it necessary to
fight to remember them?

728
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,917
"What do you mean,
that I was fighting?"

729
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:17,917
"Now, why are you arguing with me?"

730
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:21,917
"Now look, we have reached
the same echo point where..."

731
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,917
"C’mon, lets go from here."

732
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:27,291
"Please, let me try once."

733
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,959
Say it again.

734
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:01,208
What is her name?
- Muskaan.

735
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:02,917
Muskaan.

736
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,917
Till yesterday you
wanted to teach her a lesson.

737
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:06,917
And today you want her to
do the ramp walk in the show?

738
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:08,250
What is so special in that girl?

739
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,041
If you want a model for the walk...

740
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:14,041
"...then we will call up Mumbai.
Not one, but ten will come."

741
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:19,208
"I don’t want models, but
that girl. I want that girl."

742
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:21,333
So what should we do?
We shouldn’t call Mumbai?

743
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,250
"Sam, I want to listen to the piano."

744
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,041
"Child, not now,
later, okay? Go out now."

745
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:27,333
"No, I want to listen to the piano."

746
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,916
"Didn’t I tell you, not now?"

747
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:36,500
"Sharad, apologize to the boy."

748
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:43,166
"Apology, for what?"

749
01:16:56,958 --> 01:17:02,083
Anant. I apologize
from my friends side.

750
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,250
I disturbed you people.

751
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,083
"No, we are friends now, isn’t it?"

752
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:12,250
"Sam, can I go now, I
have to take medicines now."

753
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,875
Go.

754
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,292
Who was this child?

755
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:26,208
Anant. He is staying in
this hotel with his parents.

756
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,208
That’s all right.

757
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:31,500
But you slapped Sharad for
the sake of an unknown child?

758
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:36,292
Especially when that child...

759
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:41,041
There is no guarantee of even
a moment of this child’s life.

760
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:43,875
He has a heart in his hole.

761
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,208
Even the doctors
have given up all hope.

762
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:49,250
One month at the most.

763
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:54,292
If I can give him
some happiness and love...

764
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,916
Excellent! You are playing alone?

765
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:14,500
Are you scared of defeat?

766
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,292
Do you have the
guts to play with me?

767
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:20,125
I have the guts and I can
defeat you too. But not today.

768
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:22,916
Why not today?
- I don’t have the mood.

769
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,208
The mood can be aroused too.

770
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,041
Do you have a penchant to lose?

771
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:31,208
"If I lose, I will give
up whatever you say."

772
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,208
Think about it.

773
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:36,875
And what if you lose
- Then?

774
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:40,459
Then you have to be make
friendship with me. - Agreed.

775
01:18:40,459 --> 01:18:43,208
But there is a condition.
- What?

776
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:46,958
We wont play basket ball.
Well play something else.

777
01:18:55,916 --> 01:19:00,292
What happened?
I told you to make a move.

778
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,250
The Almighty has
already made his move.

779
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,125
And that too a wrong move.

780
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:22,208
"I have lost the game,
and God know what else."

781
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,875
You have lost to me.

782
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:31,208
"Yes, I have lost, Miss Muskaan."

783
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:35,000
Please tell me what do you wish now?

784
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:46,375
Friendship.
- Friendship?

785
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,916
"Janhvi, what are you doing here?"

786
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:02,916
"What are you doing here?
- You forgot, didn’t you?"

787
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:06,916
Today’s the 25th. Okay I understood.

788
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:09,916
You haven’t forgotten
and this is for me.

789
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:12,875
Yes.

790
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:21,208
There are only two
days left for the show.

791
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:27,250
We will try once again.
This is the way we do it.

792
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,042
Your walk is perfect.

793
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,250
But your steps should be
synchronized with the music.

794
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,875
I will try once more.

795
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:46,916
We will try once more!

796
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:10,083
The show will open with your walk.

797
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:13,417
"There will be only one
light in the darkness, on you."

798
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:16,500
The eyes of the
audience will be on you.

799
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,083
And their ears will be on the music.

800
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,208
It will be good for the feel.

801
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:32,916
"Come, please wear the costume."

802
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:59,208
"Satin, who gave Muskaan this dress?"

803
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:01,459
"Sameer, this dress was inside,
in the costume room."

804
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,208
I thought...
- What did you think?

805
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:06,292
Do you know for who this dress is?

806
01:22:07,459 --> 01:22:08,875
I have never let
anyone touch this dress...

807
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,833
...and you will wear
it and walk on the ramp?

808
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:20,083
"And you? If you didn’t know,
couldn’t you ask anyone?"

809
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,083
I am asking you.

810
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,417
How did this dress
come from my room?

811
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:32,917
"Friend, it must have
come with the other dresses."

812
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:49,125
Will you not forgive me?

813
01:23:06,209 --> 01:23:08,375
"I cried very much, Sameer."

814
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:13,500
"But for the first time today,
someone has wiped my tears."

815
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:56,875
The one whom I have
given this heart to.

816
01:23:56,875 --> 01:24:01,375
The one whom I have
given this heart to.

817
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:06,000
The one whom I have loved.

818
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,042
The one whom I have loved.

819
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:20,958
"You are the one, you are the one."

820
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,042
The one whom I have
given this heart to.

821
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:30,500
The one whom I have
given this heart to.

822
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,250
The one whom I have loved.

823
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:40,125
The one whom I have loved.

824
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:49,958
"You are the one, you are the one."

825
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:17,084
"After I have met you,
I think that, my love..."

826
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:22,084
...there is nothing
missing in my life now.

827
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:27,833
The lines that
appear on your lips.

828
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:33,750
"It is not the aroma,
but the warmth of loyalty."

829
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:39,084
The one who has
taken away my peace.

830
01:25:39,084 --> 01:25:44,875
The one who has
taken away my peace!

831
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:22,084
I had protected my heart for long.

832
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:27,750
But this crazy one
has started to dance.

833
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:33,333
"Since the time our
eyes have met, O beloved."

834
01:26:34,209 --> 01:26:39,416
The weather of thought
has started to change.

835
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:45,209
My heart is not in my control.

836
01:26:45,209 --> 01:26:51,084
It is not in my control!

837
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,291
I am surely going away.

838
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:00,541
But whenever you close
your eyes and remember me...

839
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:05,250
"...you will find that I am
there with you, just close to you."

840
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:10,416
"Miss Wrong Number,
I remember my promise."

841
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:15,917
Muskaan will not do this show.

842
01:28:15,917 --> 01:28:18,208
"As it is, she couldn’t do
the walk during the rehearsals."

843
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:21,375
"I had told earlier too, to
call some model from Mumbai."

844
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,167
To train some girl who
doesn’t have the body language...

845
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:26,792
...and she doesn’t even have the
knowledge of the rhythm.

846
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,208
Nobody will say
even a word about Muskaan.

847
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,875
She’s not doing the show.

848
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:34,084
I’m dropping the opening
walk from this show.

849
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:38,333
"Janhvi, you are getting
upset without any reason."

850
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:38,917
Do you know?

851
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:42,125
Sameer has dropped
that girl from the show.

852
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,208
That girl has been
dropped from the show?

853
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:47,875
Which model will ready
that difficult walk so quickly?

854
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:51,500
"Shikha, I will ready
the opening walk."

855
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:58,917
Open the hall door.

856
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,875
Sir the door is open. Maam
is rehearsing since last night.

857
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:36,959
You were rehearsing
for the whole night?

858
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:41,166
Muskaan! Muskaan!

859
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:49,208
Are you crazy? You were
rehearsing for the whole night?

860
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:53,208
"You wished that
I should do this walk, isn’t it?"

861
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:56,208
I didn’t want to disappoint you.

862
01:29:56,208 --> 01:30:00,000
"I was doing it right,
wasn’t I? Are you happy?"

863
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,084
"Yes, I’m very happy."

864
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:52,125
You forgot an old relationship
for a new introduction?

865
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,875
For whom?
- For Muskaan.

866
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,875
"Muskaan, and you?"

867
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:00,458
All this is because of you.

868
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:04,208
"Nor would I have come here,
neither would I meet Sameer."

869
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:07,458
"This is a storm, in
which I am drowning."

870
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:08,917
"Till yesterday, I was
fighting with Sameer."

871
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:12,917
And then friendship. Today
during the show when he...

872
01:31:12,917 --> 01:31:15,917
"Muskaan, do you love Sameer?"

873
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:20,166
"Yes, Shweta. I love Sameer."

874
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:25,709
"I am in love with Sameer.
He is mine, only mine."

875
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:30,959
And that what you
were saying right now.

876
01:31:30,959 --> 01:31:36,000
"From today, forget saying,
don’t even think about it."

877
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:57,875
"What’s the matter Janhvi,
you are very happy today?"

878
01:31:57,875 --> 01:32:00,291
"Yes, I’m very happy today."

879
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:03,291
At least ask why.

880
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:20,083
Because you raised your
hand on that innocent girl.

881
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:22,917
I just raised my hand on her.

882
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:28,083
"If she comes between
us, I will kill her."

883
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:35,083
"If you say anything to her
from today, I will kill you."

884
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:43,292
But I love you. Sameer.

885
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:53,208
"Muskaan, open the door.
I want to speak to you."

886
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:57,125
"Sameer, you please go.
I don’t want to talk to you."

887
01:32:57,125 --> 01:33:00,875
"Muskaan, just listen
to me for a minute."

888
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,916
I don’t want to listen
to anything. Please go.

889
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,250
How much will you cry?

890
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:16,333
For the man who insulted
your love and your emotions.

891
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,916
"I will cry, Sharad.
I will cry till I’m alive."

892
01:33:24,916 --> 01:33:29,375
I will cry for my whole life for
that man. You wont understand.

893
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:33,166
"If he didn’t understand,
how will you understand?"

894
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,834
How much I love him.

895
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:38,208
Even now? After
so much has occurred?

896
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,166
"Yes, even now."

897
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:45,166
"Not only this, even if
something else happens."

898
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:50,417
Sameer may marry Muskaan
and hate me.

899
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:53,208
I will love him even then.

900
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:57,875
If only you had loved
someone else thus.

901
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:01,834
Then he would have made
you the crown of his head.

902
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:07,250
"If only, Sameer would have
loved me half of what I do."

903
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:11,375
Then I would have playfully
given up my life for him.

904
01:34:28,916 --> 01:34:34,958
"Janhvi, I want to..."

905
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:43,958
Whatever I did was wrong.
I shouldn’t have done that.

906
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:48,958
But you didn’t do right too.
Muskaan is a good girl.

907
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:52,250
And you shouldn’t
have done like that.

908
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,916
You think that I am
in love with Muskaan.

909
01:34:56,083 --> 01:35:00,250
Even I don’t know
if I love her or not.

910
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:32,333
You killed her!
I will not spare you!

911
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:35,167
I didn’t kill her!

912
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:39,750
Sameer. The police have come.
We have been called.

913
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:45,833
"Leave him. Come, Sameer."

914
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:52,292
"Look properly,
look behind there too."

915
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:56,500
Search the whole room.
Check everywhere.

916
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:07,958
You must have heard my name.

917
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:12,958
"Rajput, Inspector Vikram Rajput."

918
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:16,833
Someone has killed
her quite brutally.

919
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:19,875
What enmity did
she have with anyone?

920
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,125
She has enmity with someone...

921
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:26,083
...Whose name starts
with the alphabet S.

922
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:36,208
This was Janhvis
last try before her death.

923
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:41,208
She tried to write the name
of her killer with her blood.

924
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:44,500
Which she couldn’t complete.

925
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,833
"Shikha, Sameer, Satin, Sharad."

926
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:57,125
Its very interesting.
All are close friends of Janhvi...

927
01:38:57,125 --> 01:39:01,625
And every one has
their names starting with S.

928
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:06,917
Shweta. Shweta!

929
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,250
What happened?

930
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,875
Janhvi has been murdered.
- What?

931
01:39:11,875 --> 01:39:12,958
I am warning the four of you.

932
01:39:12,958 --> 01:39:20,334
You will have to cooperate
till my investigation is complete.

933
01:39:21,209 --> 01:39:27,000
If anyone takes any untoward
action which I do not like...

934
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:31,708
...then the serpents of
crime call me a mongoose.

935
01:39:39,209 --> 01:39:42,791
Take the fingerprints of these four.

936
01:39:54,209 --> 01:39:56,875
You remembered me?

937
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:58,875
Are you the manager of this hotel?

938
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:01,209
Yes. I am the manager of this hotel.

939
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:05,417
Actually the incident that
took place in our hotel tonight.

940
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:10,958
"When I ask, answer then."

941
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,167
"For now, do this much.
Till my next order..."

942
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:19,917
...nobody will leave this
hotel and go out.

943
01:40:21,917 --> 01:40:24,958
"Sir, sir has called you downstairs."

944
01:40:26,209 --> 01:40:31,875
Anger is a very bad thing.
It makes man do anything.

945
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:32,875
Someone’s murder too.

946
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:36,209
Wrong. This is utter lie.
Janhvi was my friend.

947
01:40:36,209 --> 01:40:40,334
"Why will I... - Mr. Sameer Oberoi,
the serpents of crime..."

948
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:43,209
...call me a mongoose.

949
01:40:43,209 --> 01:40:47,458
And I get the scent
of a snake from afar.

950
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,125
"If you have committed
this crime, Sameer Oberoi..."

951
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:55,209
"...then you will writhe too much,
but you wont be spared."

952
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:57,917
"Please think before attacking,
Mr. Vikram."

953
01:40:57,917 --> 01:41:00,125
Otherwise it will
be that the mongoose...

954
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:02,458
...will think that the rope is
a snake and sit staring at it.

955
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:08,083
And the real snake walks
from under his nose too far away.

956
01:41:08,917 --> 01:41:12,833
I know how to differentiate
between a rope and a snake.

957
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:16,083
I just need some proof.

958
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:20,541
And pray that the
proof is not against you.

959
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:30,708
"Sir, I suspect this man strongly."

960
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:36,167
I suspect every man in this hotel.

961
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:39,792
Maybe you have
committed his murder.

962
01:41:40,917 --> 01:41:42,875
Me?

963
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:43,917
Now did you understand?

964
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:47,750
Why the serpents of
crime call me a mongoose?

965
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:22,875
You?

966
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:26,292
She was a good friend
of Sameer and his friends.

967
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:31,875
Sameer must be worried.
Why don’t you talk to him?

968
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:39,875
Yes. I will have to
talk to him at least once.

969
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:43,084
The night that Janhvi
madam was murdered...

970
01:42:43,084 --> 01:42:45,875
...I was on duty in that room.

971
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:48,125
When I reached there with water...

972
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:51,375
...she was talking with
someone over the telephone.

973
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:55,209
I don’t know whom
she was talking to.

974
01:42:55,209 --> 01:42:57,875
But she was crying while talking.

975
01:42:57,875 --> 01:43:02,833
Sharad said that he had
gone to her room near 10 O’clock.

976
01:43:03,209 --> 01:43:07,500
Satin and Shikha say that
Janhvi left the restaurant.

977
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:11,292
And they didn’t have
any talks after that.

978
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:16,209
Or is one of the three is lying?

979
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:19,375
Did Janhvi make a
long distance call?

980
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:27,333
Yes. Janhvi did make
a long distance call.

981
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:30,375
And that too at
her residence number.

982
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:38,209
"Sir, I just saw Sameer
Sir, go to Muskaan madams room."

983
01:43:38,209 --> 01:43:42,084
"Sameer, if whatever
you are saying is true..."

984
01:43:42,084 --> 01:43:45,875
...then you would have told
the police the whole truth by now.

985
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:49,209
"I cant prove anything, right now."

986
01:43:49,209 --> 01:43:54,416
"But if you suspect me, it
will be my biggest punishment."

987
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:58,917
"You are punishing me, Sameer."

988
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:04,000
"The one whom I had so
much faith in, in whom I..."

989
01:44:05,209 --> 01:44:08,375
I had to say so many things to you.

990
01:44:12,333 --> 01:44:15,375
Even I have to say
many things to you.

991
01:44:34,959 --> 01:44:39,500
"Sameer, I had not escaped
from one storm and you..."

992
01:44:40,042 --> 01:44:42,917
You wont understand.
You will never understand.

993
01:44:42,917 --> 01:44:45,875
"See, Muskaan I..."

994
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:51,875
Did you call me?

995
01:45:01,959 --> 01:45:05,333
The girl Muskaan was your friend...

996
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:09,167
...and that girl Janhvi
was your friend too.

997
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:16,542
"Is it like that, that this friend
is murdered for that friend?"

998
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,208
Inspector. You are
thinking that the shadow...

999
01:45:21,208 --> 01:45:23,959
...that is visible in
the darkness is a ghost.

1000
01:45:23,959 --> 01:45:26,208
"That too, without any proof."

1001
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:32,250
"I have proof, and now
a reason for murder too."

1002
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:37,084
The proof is the killers
blood stained fingerprints.

1003
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:50,042
"Sameer Oberoi, if those
fingerprints are yours..."

1004
01:45:50,166 --> 01:45:55,333
...then you will remember
only one thing at the noose.

1005
01:45:57,208 --> 01:46:02,125
Why serpents of
crime call me a mongoose.

1006
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:15,291
I’ve got proof.

1007
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:19,291
Anger is a very bad thing.
It makes a man do anything.

1008
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:52,042
Inspector Vikram suspects
that you killed Janhvi.

1009
01:46:52,042 --> 01:46:53,250
"I know, Uncle."

1010
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,917
But you know me since
so many years.

1011
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:56,875
Janhvi was my friend.

1012
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,917
Friend?

1013
01:46:58,917 --> 01:47:02,959
"Son, Janhvi loved you
more than her own life."

1014
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:05,166
She wished to marry you.
She is very unfortunate.

1015
01:47:05,166 --> 01:47:10,000
She didn’t get her
love while she was alive.

1016
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,166
"And after her death,
the person who is accused..."

1017
01:47:14,166 --> 01:47:17,166
...of her murder
is the one for whom...

1018
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:20,000
...she would willingly
sacrifice her life.

1019
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,125
Your faith is very
prestigious for me.

1020
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:24,875
"Uncle, just before dying, Janhvi..."

1021
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:27,875
...has talked to you over the phone.

1022
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:32,208
With me? She never spoke
to me after coming here.

1023
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:36,208
"As it is, I was not in Mumbai."

1024
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,917
There’s a record in the hotel.
There’s an eyewitness too.

1025
01:47:38,917 --> 01:47:41,875
That night Janhvi spoke to you
over the phone for five minutes.

1026
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:43,458
That too on your home number.

1027
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:48,041
"Home? Son, the house is locked."

1028
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:51,333
There’s nobody at home. The
servants were given holidays.

1029
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,917
Then whom did Janhvi
talk to over the phone?

1030
01:47:53,917 --> 01:47:55,834
Maybe on the
answering machine.

1031
01:47:55,834 --> 01:47:58,917
She left a message for you.

1032
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,917
I will call Mumbai right now.

1033
01:48:02,917 --> 01:48:05,375
We will get the tape of
that answering machine today.

1034
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:09,291
I don’t have time.

1035
01:48:12,917 --> 01:48:15,959
I don’t know what is
true and what is false.

1036
01:48:15,959 --> 01:48:21,250
"What my eyes have seen, my
mind does not believe that."

1037
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:25,792
"God, if my Sameer is true,
please help him."

1038
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:32,709
"Not because I love him, but
because he is worth loving."

1039
01:48:34,917 --> 01:48:37,834
Sameer!

1040
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:39,917
Please wait for sometime.

1041
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:41,917
Maybe there’s some
proof in the cassette.

1042
01:48:41,917 --> 01:48:46,834
"Proof is for the others.
But you, please believe in me."

1043
01:48:47,917 --> 01:48:49,333
What difference will that make?

1044
01:48:49,333 --> 01:48:51,208
I don’t know.

1045
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:56,417
I just know that even if
I get hanged after this by the law...

1046
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:16,375
"Sunil, this road doesn’t
lead to the police station."

1047
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,166
I know. We wont
get a chance to talk...

1048
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:22,250
...after seeing the finger
print reports in the police station.

1049
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,166
That’s why I want to show
something to you people...

1050
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:28,041
...before reaching there.
- About what?

1051
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:30,041
About Janhvis murder.

1052
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:33,750
"Sir, your courier."

1053
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:23,083
Muskaan? Here?

1054
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:24,875
"Sameer, here is that cassette."

1055
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:28,041
"We will listen to
this cassette, first."

1056
01:50:28,041 --> 01:50:30,041
What is there in it?

1057
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:32,083
Janhvis last message
which she had left...

1058
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:33,333
...on her fathers answering machine.

1059
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:35,750
What evidence can be
there on this cassette?

1060
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:39,125
"Well, the biggest evidence
is the finger print report."

1061
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:40,792
It is expected today.

1062
01:50:40,792 --> 01:50:43,875
"We have to reach the
police station, anyway."

1063
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:47,041
That inspector
must be waiting for us.

1064
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:52,333
"Papa, he didn’t understand
how much I loved him."

1065
01:50:52,417 --> 01:50:54,792
"I lost Sameer, Papa."

1066
01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:58,375
"Papa, I want to
tell something to you."

1067
01:50:58,375 --> 01:51:03,458
"Papa, I cant understand,
what should I do!"

1068
01:51:18,833 --> 01:51:21,833
You?

1069
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:50,083
Satin!!!

1070
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:02,417
You killed Janhvi!

1071
01:54:04,042 --> 01:54:07,042
"Yes, I had killed Janhvi!"

1072
01:54:07,042 --> 01:54:10,125
"Of course, I had murdered her.
But the reason for that is you!"

1073
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:12,042
"You, Sameer Oberoi!"

1074
01:54:12,042 --> 01:54:15,125
"Sameer, our labor and your fame?"

1075
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:18,042
Our talent and your success!?

1076
01:54:18,042 --> 01:54:22,042
"I arranged many attacks
on you, but you got saved."

1077
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:26,167
"I tolerated a lot... a lot, Sameer."

1078
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:31,750
But now I want my position back.

1079
01:54:31,916 --> 01:54:34,125
"I am a better designer
than you, Sameer."

1080
01:54:34,125 --> 01:54:36,500
I had thought once
you land up in jail...

1081
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,167
"...the business, the fame,
everything will be mine."

1082
01:54:38,167 --> 01:54:39,459
"You don’t want to go to jail, right?"

1083
01:54:39,459 --> 01:54:44,125
"You just want to die, isn’t it?
Die, then!"

1084
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:48,916
You will die! All of you will die!

1085
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:52,208
"Anyone who comes in my
way is going to die, now."

1086
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:56,791
I will not spare anyone.

1087
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:20,208
I considered you friend and...

1088
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:24,833
...you carried so
much venom against me?

1089
01:55:45,417 --> 01:55:48,167
So you are the serpent who
took the life of that girl...

1090
01:55:48,167 --> 01:55:52,250
...in order to avenge Sameer?

1091
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:57,167
Your criminal serpent!
I am known as Mongoose.

1092
01:55:57,167 --> 01:56:00,083
Take all of them to
the police station.

1093
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:03,917
"'Thanks is a very small word.
- Don’t say a word, Sameer."

1094
01:56:03,917 --> 01:56:08,125
"C’mon, lets go the police station."

1095
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:15,791
Just don’t know
whether I saved you or myself?

1096
01:56:24,125 --> 01:56:28,042
I unnecessarily doubted you.

1097
01:56:28,042 --> 01:56:30,125
You were just performing your duty.

1098
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:31,791
Rather you could have
arrested me on the first...

1099
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:36,791
"...day itself, if you wished so.
- I did wish so."

1100
01:56:36,791 --> 01:56:41,292
"But, then... the cop instinct!"

1101
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:46,334
That’s why the criminals...
- Call you a mongoose!

1102
01:56:49,083 --> 01:56:53,209
You all may go!

1103
01:56:58,209 --> 01:57:00,167
"Next time, whenever
you people come to Simla..."

1104
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:03,417
...don’t forget to contact me.

1105
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:07,209
Today is 31st December.

1106
01:57:09,083 --> 01:57:11,917
"You too, sir!"

1107
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:15,917
"15 days, means 1st Jan."

1108
01:57:15,917 --> 01:57:20,209
We will meet on 1st Jan.
First day of the new year.

1109
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:25,125
What happened? You
seemed to have got upset...

1110
01:57:25,125 --> 01:57:29,417
...listening about 31st December?

1111
01:57:32,209 --> 01:57:35,125
"Yes, Shikha! I was supposed
to reach somewhere..."

1112
01:57:35,125 --> 01:57:39,209
...on 1st of Jan. I had
made a promise to someone.

1113
01:57:39,209 --> 01:57:44,125
But now...
- But now?

1114
01:57:58,084 --> 01:58:00,167
I want to say something to you.

1115
01:58:00,167 --> 01:58:02,167
"Muskaan, please! Don’t
say anything or else..."

1116
01:58:02,167 --> 01:58:04,084
...I wont be able to express myself.

1117
01:58:04,084 --> 01:58:06,167
"Yes, Muskaan, even I..."

1118
01:58:06,167 --> 01:58:07,167
...I too...

1119
01:58:07,167 --> 01:58:09,167
...I too love you a lot.

1120
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:14,125
So much that you
cannot even imagine.

1121
01:58:17,084 --> 01:58:21,958
But there is a girl. Who loves
me much more than this.

1122
01:58:23,125 --> 01:58:27,042
"Before meeting you, I too used to..."

1123
01:58:27,042 --> 01:58:31,292
...I used to feel that
I too loved her as much.

1124
01:58:33,042 --> 01:58:38,042
Then I met you and I didn’t
realize when I started to love you.

1125
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:45,917
"With you, I felt as
if I am betraying her."

1126
01:58:49,792 --> 01:58:52,375
And I cannot betray her.

1127
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:54,792
My best wishes for her love!

1128
01:58:54,792 --> 01:58:59,917
"Sameer, live happily with her."

1129
01:58:59,917 --> 01:59:02,167
"I am not going to meet her, now."

1130
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:06,250
"Because after accepting her, I
will not be able to forget you ever."

1131
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:11,084
If you are like my breaths...
she is like my heartbeat.

1132
01:59:11,084 --> 01:59:13,833
"With you, I have learnt to love..."

1133
01:59:13,833 --> 01:59:18,084
...and with her I have
learnt to receive love.

1134
01:59:18,084 --> 01:59:21,167
"In my memories, in my feelings..."

1135
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:24,084
...both of you will
remain forever with me!

1136
01:59:24,084 --> 01:59:26,458
But perhaps... Love...

1137
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:29,125
"...I will not get
anyone’s love, ever."

1138
01:59:29,125 --> 01:59:31,750
Never!

1139
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:34,583
"Sameer, will we never meet again?"

1140
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:42,375
"If I cant get you, then
what use is meeting again?"

1141
01:59:43,042 --> 01:59:48,250
"No Muskaan, we will never meet again."

1142

I am leaving because
I love Sameer a lot.
