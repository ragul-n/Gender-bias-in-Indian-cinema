Hey, hey, watch it!
Okay, get out of my way quick!

37
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,740
May Goddess Durga destroy all evil!

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,120
What trouble they give me!

39
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,450
Now listen! I've already told you,
I'm only a servant, he's the master.

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,540
He can go wherever he likes.
Why are you people after me?

41
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,080
Why don't you tell us where Vaikuntha
Majumdar has been for the last eight days?

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,466
When he returns,
why don't you ask him yourself?

43
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,916
What's he going to tell you, Masterji?
I'll tell you where he's gone.

44
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,100
- Tell me.
- Come close, I need to tell it in your ear.

45
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,330
Careful!

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,330
The palanquin arrives!
The palanquin arrives!

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,650
He is my son. Gokul.

48
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,040
Poor child. He was just three months
when his mother passed away.

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,780
He's barely a year old now.

50
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,439
I wasn't really interested
in marrying again.

51
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,300
When I realized I couldn't manage
both the business and my child alone...

52
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,020
I had to reluctantly agree.

53
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,780
So that my Gokul gets a mother's love.

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,840
And when I look at you, I think...

55
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,540
that God may have heard my prayer.

56
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,790
Sister, nobody told us about a child!

57
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,740
You are yourself very young.
And now a child on top of that!

58
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,800
What are you going to do now, sis?

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,440
Mother!

60
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,800
Mother, Mother, little Krishna calls out

61
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,510
My feet are tired from trying to walk

62
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,770
At least take me in your arms now

63
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,290
Mother!

64
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Yashoda mother
takes the little child in her arms

65
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,380
Whoever sees
this picture of motherhood...

66
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,090
can only marvel at it

67
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,410
The mother sings her child to sleep
and wakes him up with a kiss at dawn

68
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,076
Yashoda wakes him up
with a kiss at dawn

69
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:45,100
She says "wake up, wake up!"

70
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:54,480
"Wake up Kanhaiya,
wake up Gopala, wake up"

71
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:04,410
See how each time she speaks
his name differently, so lovingly

72
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:16,510
When water is poured on him,
Shyam flashes his beautiful smile

73
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,950
Like a lotus smiling

74
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,570
Whether he feels cold or not,
the mischievous Hari...

75
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,159
keeps a smile on, flashing his teeth

76
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,350
Today, my darling son's
going to school for the first time.

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,070
He's going to study
and become a very capable man.

78
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,680
Here, wear your slippers!

79
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,080
- Let's go, Father.
- Let's go.

80
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,650
Tell Masterji not to scold my son.

81
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,340
Sure, I'll tell him. Don't worry.
Come on, son, let's go.

82
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
I'm going, Mother.

83
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,420
Jaddu, don't leave Gokul
on his own in school.

84
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,810
No, Mother, how can I possibly do that?

85
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,530
Weren't you all saying that Vaikunth's
new wife is a kind, loving woman?

86
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,080
That she loves her stepson
beyond imagination?

87
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,660
Now, I want to see
how much she loves him.

88
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,080
Now that she is going
to have her own child.

89
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,520
A five-year child!
On top of that, a stepmother!

90
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,780
On top of that, a stepbrother!

91
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,350
Oh Goddess Durga! Who knows
what lies in store for Gokul!

92
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,680
Vaikunth! It's a son!

93
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,870
Congratulations, Vaikunth!
Now give us sweets!

94
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,580
Of course!

95
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,610
- My son, you've got a brother now!
- Brother?

96
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,690
So I've got a brother now?

97
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,550
What's all this going on?

98
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,556
Are you playing Ram-Lakshman here?

99
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,010
We're going to take part
in a Ramayana play.

100
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm Ram and he's Lakshman.

101
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,950
Come on, let's go!
Victory to Lord Ram!

102
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,050
- Jaddu, you?
- Not Jaddu, I am Hanuman.

103
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,130
- Do you know some magic?
- Magic?

104
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,120
You've just transformed
this house into heaven.

105
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,270
Come on! I've done nothing.

106
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,860
If you haven't, who has?

107
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,060
I am really such a lucky man.

108
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,660
Sometimes I wonder what would've happened
if I'd got somebody else in your place.

109
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Gokul and Vinod
are supposedly stepbrothers.

110
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,230
They love each other so much. I don't
even see that in brothers anymore.

111
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,070
Mother, I've passed double today.
I've got double promotion.

112
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,330
Then we should be getting
double sweets too.

113
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,370
- Where's Gokul?
- Brother has failed.

114
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,910
He's failed? But where is he?

115
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,690
There he is. Brother!

116
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,630
Gokul! Gokul!

117
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,170
Your mother is calling you.
Come here!

118
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,130
My son! Gokul!

119
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,770
Bhawani, where are you?

120
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,700
Congratulations on
Vinod's double promotion.

121
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,510
Your womb is a jewel.
What a bright child you've given birth to.

122
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,910
Come here, my son, come to me.

123
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,320
Amongst all the boys in the class,
your son came first.

124
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,370
And has been given
a double promotion too.

125
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:54,030
I'm telling you today, this son of yours
will become a High Court judge. For sure.

126
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,890
And this Gokula? No comparison
between this boy and your son.

127
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,810
This Gokula is such a dunce,
I don't even want to talk about it.

128
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,100
On the examination day,
I was the examiner in the hall.

129
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,490
A lot of students had their books open
and were merrily copying.

130
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,480
On both sides of him,
the Mallick brothers were copying.

131
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,916
I could see it all but just
turned a blind eye to it.

132
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,670
In fact, I even winked at this
boy to give him a hint.

133
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,550
But he is such a dunce
he sat like a statue.

134
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,610
He didn't even look up.

135
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,710
Otherwise, you think the Mallick brothers
would pass and he, my student, wouldn't?

136
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,540
All the boys were copying. Only you
didn't think of copying and passing.

137
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,620
Anyway, just say, my son, that this time
you'll study seriously and pass.

138
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,290
Oh, yeah, Gokula will come first?

139
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,120
And the sun will rise from the west!

140
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,030
The one who will come first,
is sitting on my lap right now.

141
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,180
Does this boy have any shame at all?

142
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,590
You know what he goes around
telling the boys?

143
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,180
"So what if I haven't passed? At least
my younger brother has come first!"

144
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,710
You're showering so much love on him
out of sympathy that he has no mother.

145
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,200
But let me tell you, he who's not born
to you can never be your own.

146
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,260
Don't let Vinod be
influenced by this Gokula.

147
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,980
Otherwise, this Gokula will
take him down with him, too.

148
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,290
Okay, my dear, it's getting late.
I need to go now.

149
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,320
But keep in mind what I said.

150
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,260
One day, your son will definitely
become a judge.

151
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,530
If you want,
I'll come and teach him myself.

152
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,220
May Goddess Durga destroy evil!

153
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,780
Gokul! Come here!

154
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,830
Tell me, when everybody was
copying in class, why didn't you?

155
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,890
Tell me, why are you standing quiet?
Why didn't you copy?

156
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,210
Yes, my son, give your father an answer.

157
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,250
What's this, Gokul?
You're such a big boy and you're crying?

158
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Tell me, my son.

159
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,210
Before the exams, the headmaster had said
that no boy should cheat and copy.

160
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,590
Okay, then. From now on, you don't need
to go to school anymore.

161
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,570
Come, let's go to sleep.

162
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,990
- Mother?
- No, he doesn't mean it.

163
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,880
You just put your full attention
to your studies from now on, okay?

164
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,370
Vinod got a double promotion. And you can't?
Of course you can, you're the older brother.

165
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,690
Just watch. Next year,
you'll also get a double promotion.

166
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,750
Go, go to sleep.

167
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,500
- You come too.
- Now, go to sleep.

168
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,180
Put those books back and
come with me to the shop.

169
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,680
- Shop?
- Yes, Gokul won't study anymore. He'll come with me to the shop.

170
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Come on, hurry up!

171
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,400
What is this? You want this little boy
to come run the shop with you?

172
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,150
As long as I'm alive, I'm not going to
allow Gokul's studies to be stopped.

173
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,650
I've never ever seen anybody
getting so upset.

174
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,300
- But who's got upset?
- You, who else?

175
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,140
Have you ever seen me getting upset?

176
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,780
Then what sort of talk is this?

177
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,280
When young,
children often pass or fail in class.

178
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,150
Is that a reason to stop their schooling?
Come, my son.

179
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,510
Just listen to me.

180
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,420
- Okay, tell me.
- I wasn't upset.

181
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,380
Rather, I'm very happy with your older son.

182
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,850
That's why I want to take him
with me to the shop.

183
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,090
Unlike Jailal Master,
I can't give you this assurance...

184
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,790
that your younger son
will become a judge one day.

185
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,130
But, there is one thing
I can say with confidence.

186
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:23,820
When I'm gone, it's only on Gokul
you can depend, to live a worry-free life.

187
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,880
And you are seeing for yourself.
I don't have the same energy anymore.

188
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,700
But... but my Gokul is a simpleton.

189
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,010
Will he be able to understand
the intricacies of your business?

190
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,940
Whoever comes across him,
will end up cheating him.

191
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,980
No, not everybody will cheat him.

192
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,620
Yes, there may be some.

193
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,150
But at least he won't cheat anybody.
And that's enough for me.

194
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,880
Goddess Lakshmi (goddess of wealth)
will come to him by herself.

195
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:14,140
By not copying in the exams, the way Gokul
has shown character at this young age.

196
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,640
Maybe you don't quite understand
its significance.

197
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:28,690
I'd say he's already learnt ninety percent
of what he needed to learn of business.

198
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,790
The remaining ten percent
I will now teach him.

199
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,380
But... but what will people say?

200
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,590
I don't know about people.
I only know what I think.

201
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,140
By handing over Gokul and Vinod to you,
I can close my eyes in peace.

202
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,760
Don't say such things. If you think
this is the right thing to do...

203
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,580
Son, will you listen to one thing I say?

204
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,720
From today, go with your father
to the shop, okay?

205
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,990
Wait, let me get
your clothes ready for you.

206
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,790
Mother, why are you crying?
I'm fine with going to the shop.

207
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,740
I'm fine with going to the shop, Mother.

208
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,210
I have no interest in studying anyway.

209
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,280
Vinod will study. He's younger.
Let him study a lot, Mother.

210
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,480
Mother, I'm the older one, right?
If I don't take care of the shop, who will?

211
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,550
- Let's go, Father.
- Have you taken your mother's blessings?

212
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:51,710
Go, my son. Learn the work with full dedication.
We're depending on you for our future.

213
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,950
Come, let's go.

214
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,740
Seek blessings from your granny.

215
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:36,940
And from that day on, Gokul removed all
thoughts of study and play from his mind.

216
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,800
Following his mother's instructions, he began learning
the business from his father, Vaikunth Majumdar.

217
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,010
Vinod, on the other hand,
got busy studying day and night.

218
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,960
The total amount? Two hundred
and three rupees, fifteen annas.

219
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,730
Time passed by.
Vinod regularly stood first in class.

220
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:11,540
At the business, Vaikunth Majumdar was very
happy to see how Gokul was handling the business.

221
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,860
In due course of time,
the parents got Gokul married.

222
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,080
And thus got a daughter-in-law
by the name of Manorama.

223
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,790
The mother was overjoyed beyond limits.

224
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,550
Then one day, the granny,
giving everybody blessings, passed away.

225
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,520
Manorama gave birth to a beautiful girl.
It was as if Goddess Lakshmi had come home.

226
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,220
Vaikunth and Bhawani became grandparents.

227
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,230
On Gokul's insistence, his parents
sent Vinod to Calcutta for higher studies.

228
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:53,010
Vinod kept up his good work, getting good grades
in college, too, just as he had in school.

229
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,570
There was nothing to worry about at all
in Vaikunth Majumdar's life.

230
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,820
Here, Gokul,
take these keys to the shop.

231
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,850
From today, I'm handing over the reins
of the business totally to you.

232
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,810
But, my son, don't forget one thing ever.

233
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,680
Nobody can ever cheat an honest person.

234
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,550
I've had to face many difficulties in life.

235
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,060
But thanks only to my honesty,
I never had to bow my head before anyone.

236
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,990
My son, keep this principle of mine
as your guiding principle in life.

237
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,460
Keeping his father's principles in mind,
Gokul worked so hard day and night that...

238
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,470
in just four years, the business
grew to several lakhs of rupees.

239
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,210
Vinod was still away at college when Gokul
built a big home for his brother in the village.

240
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,620
One day, the landlord's two sons,
Suresh and Ramesh, came to the shop.

241
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,890
- How are you, Gokul?
- Aha, you! How are you?

242
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,740
When did you come from Calcutta?
Vinod is doing fine, I hope?

243
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,720
- Have the holidays started?
- They begin today, but we left a day early.

244
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,730
- And Vinod?
- He's arriving on tonight's train.

245
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,830
- Tonight's train?
- He's given this letter for you.

246
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,800
Why did you take the trouble?
I could've come to your place.

247
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,700
Chakravarty sir,
Vinod is arriving tonight.

248
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,210
Jaddu, get the new place totally
cleaned up. Vinod is arriving tonight.

249
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,430
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight. Now get going!

250
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,920
And inform Mother and Father also.

251
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,610
Chakravarty sir, I'll be back in a minute.

252
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,320
Excuse him. When he hears his
brother's name, he forgets everything else.

253
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,890
The other day he was saying he'll receive
Vinod with a big band when he arrives next.

254
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,170
Maybe that's what he's gone
to arrange now.

255
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,450
Uncle has come!
Uncle has come! Uncle has come!

256
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,480
Yes, your uncle has come!

257
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,890
Masterji, look at this.
Vinod has won a medal! A gold medal.

258
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,850
Why won't he win a medal?
After all, he is my student.

259
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,320
Touch Masterji's feet.

260
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,380
Mother! Father! Vinod has earned
a medal as best graduate.

261
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,260
A gold medal.

262
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,816
A medal like this has not been won
by anybody in Ballygunge.

263
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,240
Or in Hooghly.

264
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,786
Or in Alipore.

265
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,030
Just look at it, Mother. A gold medal.
Even Vinod's name has been inscribed on it.

266
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,610
- Vinod!
- Mother!

267
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,390
Is your heart made of stone or what?

268
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,690
In six months, you couldn't write
even one letter to your mother?

269
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,330
You're the limit, Mother.
"Didn't write a letter".

270
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,610
How could he have written?
You think he'd have had the time to write?

271
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,800
You know, Mother,
he has to study such thick books.

272
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,680
If he'd been writing you letters,
how'd he have won this medal?

273
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,220
You haven't even seen the medal
properly, Mother. Just look at it.

274
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,590
Vinod's name is written on it.

275
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,440
Vinod Majumdar.

276
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,250
Gokul, my son, actually this medal
should've been given to you.

277
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,930
To me? Ha ha... Mother, you're a laugh!
This should've been given to me?

278
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,250
Why not? If Vinod has achieved anything,
who's behind his success?

279
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,540
It was you who fought with us
and insisted that he be sent to Calcutta.

280
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,640
You toil day and night
to earn money to send to him.

281
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,820
Look here, my son, you are very fortunate
to have an elder brother like him.

282
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,690
Until now, he's never
done anything for himself.

283
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,110
He's always thinking and talking about you.

284
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,280
- This new house he built is also for you.
- Really, Mother?

285
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,620
The government may
have given you a medal.

286
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,940
But if I had my way,
I'd have given him a medal.

287
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,910
Father, see what Mother says.

288
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,160
What are you waiting for?
Come, let me show you your room.

289
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,310
Hey, bring the luggage.

290
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,340
This isn't luggage, Gokul.

291
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,840
This is all nothing but sweets.
Calcutta's sweets.

292
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,720
So what has he brought for you?

293
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,670
These are sweets from Calcutta.

294
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,980
What else? A doll, a toy bull.
This is for you.

295
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,300
A peacock! Also for you.

296
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,930
What else? What else?

297
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,300
This isn't something for you.

298
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,680
Medicine? ls your uncle not well?

299
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,500
Sir, Vinod has asked for his bag.

300
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,470
Uh... okay, take it.

301
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,540
Mother, what are you sitting quiet for?
Get something more.

302
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,620
- Rama!
- Enough, I've had enough.

303
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,366
- How's that enough? You must eat everything.
- Today your brother's in charge. Eat everything.

304
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,500
Uncle will have to eat everything.

305
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,270
Vinod, since when have you
started taking medicine?

306
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,930
Medicine? What medicine? You were unwell
and you never wrote me about it?

307
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,170
It's nothing, brother. My stomach
sometimes gets upset.

308
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,560
That's why, before
dinner, I sometimes take...

309
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,220
Hey, there are all sorts of stomach-related
problems one can have.

310
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,600
Come with me first thing in the morning.
We'll show it to the doctor.

311
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,566
No, brother,
it's not something to worry about.

312
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:24,480
Vinod, right now in our lives,
we have nothing to worry about...

313
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,430
except our worry over you.

314
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,440
Vinod, if you don't take care of your health,
how will you be able to study so much?

315
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,250
You still have to study MA, study Law.
You have to become a judge. Why, Father?

316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,420
I was going to Kashi for a pilgrimage.

317
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,926
When the train stopped here,
I couldn't resist getting off.

318
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,230
I thought I'd meet my daughter
and son-in-law.

319
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,170
And also get to meet you.

320
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
In another half an hour,
I'll catch my next train.

321
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,780
How is that possible?
You've come after so many years.

322
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,180
You'll have to stay
for at least a few days.

323
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,490
And I also have to discuss
some things with you.

324
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,260
You're an experienced person.

325
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,430
My daughter, how can I possibly
eat in my daughter's house?

326
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,950
The day your daughter has a separate house,
then don't eat at her place.

327
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,010
- Oh, so you're thinking of living separately?
- Gokul!

328
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,390
- If you want to live separately, why not just leave with your father?
- Gokul!

329
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,980
How many times have I told you,
don't talk so much.

330
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:35,510
You don't have the slightest idea
what to say, when, and to whom.

331
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,910
Okay I'll start getting ready
to go to the shop.

332
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,700
Live long!

333
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:46,390
Sorry, Rai moshai. He's grown up
but still doesn't know how to talk.

334
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,680
Oh, that's all right. We can't start
taking offence at what our children say.

335
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,750
Please don't start worrying
about these things.

336
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,850
What can I say, Rai moshai?

337
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,290
I'm not getting any younger.

338
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,790
There's Gokul of course.

339
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,900
A very good boy, but you see
for yourself how short-tempered he is.

340
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,900
And then there's Vinod.

341
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,130
One thing, Rai moshai,
you live in Calcutta.

342
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,200
By any chance, did you get
to hear of any stories about Vinod?

343
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,740
See, now that you've asked me,
it becomes my duty to tell you.

344
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,230
Well, he's an intelligent boy, and
talented. He has a lot going for him.

345
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,826
But then, you know how it is.
He's still just a young boy.

346
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,890
And that too in the city of Calcutta.
With money not being a problem for him.

347
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
And you're seeing for yourself
how the times are.

348
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,610
There's nothing to worry about as such.
With age, he'll be alright.

349
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,220
But for now, the company he keeps.

350
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,230
Like the sons of your local landlord here,
Ashu. I'm talking about Suresh and Ramesh.

351
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,330
They are there together with him.

352
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,570
And you know how landlords' sons are.

353
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,530
There they've come. They've come.

354
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,470
Friends, this is our Sri Vinod Majumdar.

355
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:18,250
He's the one who's won a medal at college
and brought all of us glory.

356
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,640
Hey Three pence, why is this sucker
being extolled to the stars today?

357
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,830
- Five pence, this is all the power of money.
- Power of money?

358
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,000
You don't understand.

359
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,909
Both our masters are in debt
from head to toe, aren't they?

360
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,930
Sure, they are.
Even their house is mortgaged.

361
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,261
- How long since we last received our wages?
- Six months.

362
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,320
And this man happens to be a rich man's
son. So obviously they've to flatter him.

363
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,110
Great! Our masters
have also found the perfect sucker.

364
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,890
Look here, Vinod, this time when you go
to Calcutta, you can't stay in a hostel.

365
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,280
- Why?
- You'll have to stay with us. What do you say, Ramesh?

366
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,230
Yes, of course, he should stay with us.

367
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,170
- Stay with you?
- Vinod babu...

368
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,786
you need to teach our masters
whatever you know.

369
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,800
And they will teach you
what they know.

370
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,470
Okay, now start preparing
to return to Calcutta.

371
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,140
Mother! Vinod won't come home tonight.

372
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
He won't? Why not?

373
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,800
There's a party at the landlord's home
to celebrate his passing his exams.

374
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,560
So he'll be having dinner there.
And also staying the night there.

375
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,080
Did you hear that?
Your brother won't be back home all night.

376
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,870
How can he come?
There must be high-ranking officers there.

377
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,610
They'll be speaking in English.

378
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,790
You think he's an ordinary person like us.

379
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,370
- But all night...
- Stop it! "He won't come home".

380
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,040
But Jaddu,
what will he do there all night?

381
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,160
Is the party going to run all night?

382
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,850
It's a party for the upper-class, Mother.
These things don't finish early.

383
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,630
No, no. My doctor has advised me
to have a little bit only before dinner.

384
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,390
After this,
we're going to be having dinner.

385
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,720
Look here, please don't worry like this.
Worry kills.

386
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,790
I shouldn't say this but until a boy
learns bad from good...

387
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,800
he shouldn't be entrusted with money,
property or any wealth.

388
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,150
After all, what is the root cause of evil
in this world? Money!

389
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,560
If I didn't have this money...

390
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,350
I wouldn't be like this,
I'd be somebody else

391
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,500
You can't trust a thing today

392
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:40,820
The only thing you can trust is money

393
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Money is your master. Money
takes care of you. Money is your friend

394
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:56,190
So my friend, praise be to money,
praise be to money

395
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,650
Fold your hands in front
of whoever has money

396
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,480
When you get a chance,
grab your share of it too

397
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,640
Bite into every penny you have

398
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,910
But don't let any money go,
don't let any money go

399
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,370
- Ask me why
- Why?

400
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,300
For money is your master. Money
takes care of you. Money is your friend

401
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:15,730
This is a world of tug of war.
You need to tug at money the right way

402
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,330
You make sure your thirst for money is alive,
and money will pull in more money for you

403
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,080
- Ask me why
- Why?

404
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:34,430
For money is your master. Money
takes care of you. Money is your friend

405
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:06,440
My heart is surrounded
by these circles of yours

406
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,250
I understand now why this world is round

407
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,400
The sun and moon are also round,
just like you

408
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,960
This earth is round, this sky is round

409
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,630
- Why?
- Because...

410
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:41,190
For money is your master. Money
takes care of you. Money is your friend

411
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,770
I've explained to your mother-in-law.
But it's like Vinod has a second mother.

412
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,310
But who do the two of you
have in this house?

413
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,180
The biggest problem is that Gokul keeps
saying "brother, brother" all the time.

414
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,890
He doesn't even think about himself.

415
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:38,230
But you've got, not one, not two,
but three little kids.

416
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,280
If you don't think about their future,
who will?

417
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,370
I'm leaving by this evening's train.

418
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,010
- But I want to make it clear that if anything untoward...
- Father!

419
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,310
My dear, it's the duty of girls to serve
all at their in-laws' place.

420
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,680
That's how happiness and peace
are maintained in a household.

421
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,060
And you've got a Dashrath-like father-in-law,
a Kaushalya-like mother-in-law...

422
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,900
and a Lakshman-like brother-in-law.
You are so lucky, my dear, so lucky.

423
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:11,170
- You called for me, Father?
- Yes, my son, sit down.

424
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,290
I heard you're planning
to return to Calcutta very soon.

425
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,280
Er... yes... if I don't return soon,
it'll be difficult to regain admission.

426
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:34,300
- And this time I have to study for both MA and Law, don't I?
- Hmm.

427
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,360
Look here, my son. If you ask me,
I think you've studied enough.

428
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,870
If you could stay here and help your
brother with the business, it would be good.

429
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,730
Why, what do you think?

430
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,620
What opinion can I possibly have?

431
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,950
Whatever you think
would be the right thing to do.

432
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,700
Hmm. The first thing, Vinod, is that...

433
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,790
I'm not very much in favor
of too much education.

434
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:19,470
And secondly, it's becoming difficult for
Gokul to manage the business by himself.

435
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,490
Who says it's becoming difficult?

436
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,740
You're always looking for some excuse
to stop his studies.

437
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,410
- This won't happen. It will never happen.
- Gokul!

438
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,560
I am making it very clear, Mother.

439
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,890
If he stops Vinod's studies,
I'll lock up the business.

440
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,570
And go to Kashi.

441
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:50,310
Look here, my son, you're quite
an intelligent boy yourself.

442
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:57,400
Think carefully about all I've said.

443
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,520
Understand it properly.

444
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,130
After that, I leave it to you
to do what you think best.

445
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,800
You can go now.

446
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,660
I say, what was the need to debate
with Father on this?

447
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,910
He's barely educated himself to give
somebody else advice on education.

448
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,610
Don't talk about stopping your studies.

449
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,910
What will you do? Sit in this shop with me?
I can't allow that as long as I am alive.

450
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:34,620
I didn't say anything of the sort, brother.
But when Father...

451
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,760
Yes, Father may have said it. But Mother
didn't talk of stopping your studies, did she?

452
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,650
- No, Mother didn't.
- Then, what's the problem?

453
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,540
Chakravarty Sir, whenever he needs
money for his studies...

454
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,296
please send it to him right away.
You don't need to ask anybody.

455
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,720
As you say.

456
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,380
- But, brother...
- You stupid man, why don't you understand?

457
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,550
When you pass MA and Law,
you will become an advocate.

458
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,300
Then one day you'll become a judge.

459
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,900
Won't Father be happy on that day?

460
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,490
Can I ask you something?

461
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,220
Why won't you tell me
what's worrying you so much?

462
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,210
Worry? When I have you,
what's there to worry about?

463
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,830
But I've been observing this
for the last eight days.

464
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,900
You don't eat properly.
You don't sleep well at night.

465
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,160
What's the matter?
Has Vinod done something?

466
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,930
No, no. Vinod's done nothing.

467
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,200
- Then what...
- It's nothing. Everything will be alright.

468
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:40,440
Why do you worry? As long as I'm here,
you have nothing to worry about.

469
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,880
So, when do you have
to leave for Calcutta?

470
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,470
If I'm leaving anyway,
I'd rather leave tomorrow.

471
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,400
Suresh and Ramesh have already left.

472
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:56,160
Okay. Chakravarty Sir, please
give him five hundred rupees.

473
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,930
- Five hundred?
- Yes, five hundred. Please get started on it.

474
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,520
Why are you staring at me?

475
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,150
As you wish.

476
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,370
Look here, Vinod. As long as I'm here,
don't ever worry about money.

477
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,840
After all, for whom am I working so hard
day and night, earning all this money?

478
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,130
But you really need to study sincerely
and work hard.

479
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,930
I've told everybody here that my brother
is going to become a judge one day.

480
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,770
If you don't pass your exams quickly,
how will I show my face around here?

481
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,430
You got it? Good, come on.

482
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,280
You saw this with your own eyes?

483
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,100
No, I haven't actually seen him
drinking as such...

484
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,260
but I do know the company
he keeps isn't good.

485
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:01,950
And now I hear he's going to stay
in Calcutta with Ashu Mallick's sons.

486
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,196
Vinod, come on in!
What are you waiting there for?

487
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,900
We've been waiting for you
since yesterday.

488
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,830
Come on in!
You'd put a shy girl to shame.

489
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,880
Ramesh, go bring his luggage in.

490
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,350
We thought your father may have
caused some problems for you.

491
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,330
Madho, bring his stuff in.

492
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,690
This is our close friend
I was telling to you about.

493
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,690
My greetings to you, Sir.

494
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,930
Come on, give him a reply.

495
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,000
Give him a reply for his greetings.

496
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,900
He deigns to come to our humble home.
It is the Lord's mercy.

497
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,370
I sometimes look at him,
and sometimes at my humble home.

498
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,990
- Okay then, Sir, I'll take your leave.
- Are you crazy?

499
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,230
Today we're going to celebrate
the arrival of our friend.

500
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,980
- Today?
- Of course, today.

501
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:28,700
Today, the girls' throats are a bit sore.
And I'm also not feeling very well.

502
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,480
We'll find a cure for the girls' throats.
And also a cure for your condition.

503
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,950
Just step outside with me.

504
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,320
- Vinod... Vinod, do you have any money?
- Money?

505
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:52,170
Throughout his life, my father used
to take loans from your father, right?

506
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,990
- Right.
- Then, like father, like son. I mean, this is also just a loan.

507
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:02,680
The thing is, the money we brought
with us from home is gone.

508
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,530
And our money order
hasn't arrived yet.

509
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,520
- It's in this, right?
- Yes, it's in there, but...

510
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,110
Go, I won't speak with you

511
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,870
You can try as hard as you like

512
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,680
I'm not going to remove my veil

513
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,620
The eyes know no rest...

514
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,090
counting the stars

515
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,456
- And you went away.
- Where?

516
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,180
To my rival's place

517
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,020
Don't tease me, my beloved

518
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,990
Now don't tease me

519
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,180
I may curse you...

520
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:32,520
that you just lie there
like a lazy lout

521
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:44,320
Go, I won't speak with you

522
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,390
- The fever is somewhat less today.
- What do you mean, "less today"?

523
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,470
You said the fever
would go in two days.

524
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,160
It's been eight days now.

525
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,040
See how weak Father has become.

526
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,730
What's the point in worrying, Gokul?

527
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,150
An illness hits you quickly
but takes its time to go.

528
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,860
Okay, I'll change the medicines today.

529
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,180
Jaddu, go with the doctor
and bring back the medicines.

530
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,000
- Okay, I'll be leaving now. Greetings!
- Greetings!

531
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:19,150
- Gokul, my son, if you could call for Vinod...
- Of course, Father.

532
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,930
I've sent Shambhu and Bhutwa to Calcutta.

533
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,240
Vinod should be here within a day or two.

534
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,620
Come, let's go.

535
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,620
- Vinod babu...
- When will he be back?

536
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,590
We've brought a letter for him.

537
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,446
"Brought a letter for him!"

538
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:45,530
Look here, there's no saying
when he'll come here.

539
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,620
Give me the letter
and I'll deliver it to him.

540
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,050
Why are you following me now?
Go, sit there.

541
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,980
My love is gone,
my wealth and faith are gone

542
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:10,100
Everything has been spoiled

543
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:19,620
For your sake, I've been dishonored,
I've lost my name

544
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,340
Vinod hasn't come yet?

545
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,600
He should be coming any moment, Father.
It's time for the train anyway.

546
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,830
Look here, I think my time has come.

547
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,620
I'm leaving all of you and going.

548
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,090
Until the time you join me...

549
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,760
take care of my two boys.

550
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,740
But I can't even die in peace, can I?

551
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:53,190
This business, which I worked so hard to
build, will be destroyed by Vinod in no time.

552
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:01,470
I won't be in peace even in that world.

553
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:11,020
This thing will prick
me even in that world.

554
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,560
I worry about this day and night.

555
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,850
I'm not even able to pray to God
because of this worry.

556
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,510
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

557
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:38,750
There'll be no place even for you to live.

558
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:47,870
And even Gokul's children
will be out on the streets.

559
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,000
Look here, leave nothing for Vinod.
Nothing.

560
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,670
You've worked day and night for this
business. I won't let it get frittered away.

561
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:11,300
The business, house, property...
leave everything to Gokul.

562
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,500
Leave everything to Gokul.

563
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,816
- You...
- Do it right now.

564
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,160
I will myself sign as witness.

565
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,990
I promise you I will sign
as witness to this.

566
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:30,350
I want nothing. All I want is that you
should be at peace, without worries.

567
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:36,630
Now you shouldn't have any grievances,
nothing to bother you.

568
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:43,690
- But... Vinod...
- Don't you worry about him.

569
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,740
He's an educated man.
He'll find his own way.

570
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:56,690
And... however bad he gets,
Gokul will never stop caring for him.

571
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,410
He'll definitely take care
of his younger brother.

572
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:14,680
According to this will, your only heir
will be your older son, Gokul Majumdar.

573
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,410
And your younger son,
Vinod Majumdar, will get nothing.

574
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,360
Here, sign this please.

575
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:09,240
But why did you make such a will, Father?
Why did you?

576
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,710
By leaving it all to me,
why are you denying Vinod his right?

577
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:21,260
Gokul, I have put
a lot of thought into this.

578
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:27,780
And as I go,
I still give Vinod blessings...

579
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,710
that one day he'll be back
on the right track.

580
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:43,080
A person coming from the womb
of such a mother can't be bad for long.

581
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:52,490
And I also want you to do nothing
without your mother's consent.

582
00:59:55,650 --> 01:00:01,090
One needs to do a lot of penance to be
fortunate to get a mother like this.

583
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:12,020
Father, my mother will always be my mother.
But you must give Vinod his half-share.

584
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,000
For God's sake,
don't deny him his right, Father.

585
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,420
This property belongs
to both of you, my son.

586
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,830
But until Vinod starts
on the right track...

587
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:37,930
I insist that you should
not give him anything.

588
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,950
Don't give him anything.

589
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,846
He's got all the property
transferred to his name.

590
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:59,410
- What?
- Yes, he's made sure Vinod doesn't get even a single penny.

591
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,440
But how's that possible?
After all, Vinod is also his own son.

592
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,580
Yes, but the brother
is a stepbrother, after all.

593
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,280
That's why we've come all the way,
spending our money, to give you this news.

594
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,850
You think Gokul has sent us here?

595
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,890
By the way, where is Vinod?

596
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:18,160
What? You keep asking me this
as if I've hidden him somewhere.

597
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,300
I told you he's gone to Hazaribagh.
I'll let you know when he's back.

598
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:32,800
I think Gokul's wife instigated him
to do all this. What do you think?

599
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,210
I don't think so. I think he's been
instigated by his father-in-law Nimai Rai.

600
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,100
- Oh, you mean that "grey hair, black mouche" man?
- Indeed.

601
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,500
But now the question is,
what should Vinod do?

602
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,970
Should he go back
to the village or not?

603
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:52,840
He should certainly go. You need
to think further. What does Vinod say?

604
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,490
What will that poor guy say?
He'll do as we advise.

605
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:03,180
Uffo... what are you doing sitting here?
I'd told you to clean the room inside.

606
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,160
Can't you see it's time for the train?

607
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,930
Where will he sit if he comes?
Come on, clean it quickly.

608
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,310
If you don't pay personal attention here,
nothing gets done.

609
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,920
Look at this silly man.
He's so concerned about his brother.

610
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:25,590
Vinod doesn't seem to care one bit for him.
Maybe he won't turn up even today.

611
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,556
Why have you come here without him?

612
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,090
Master, three trains arrived.
But our master did not...

613
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,120
So, are you telling me there are
no more trains coming from Calcutta?

614
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,260
There are still
two more trains to come.

615
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,496
But the horses haven't
had anything to eat, so...

616
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,720
And the little master's coming after
having a sumptuous meal, right?

617
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,060
Will your royal horses die
if they don't get something to eat?

618
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,110
- Go back right now.
- As you say, master.

619
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:10,180
- And don't return without him.
- As you say, master.

620
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,050
- "The horses had not eaten..." Huh!
- Yes, Master!

621
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,380
"Yes, master!" Everybody in this house
acts like royalty!

622
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,260
The little master can always come
in a hired carriage.

623
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,996
Why do you worry so much about all this?

624
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,960
You think I'm worrying about that boy?
What are you saying, Chakravarty Sir?

625
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:33,180
If the women hadn't been crying,
do you think I'd have allowed him inside?

626
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,900
If I get angry...
you know how I can be, don't you?

627
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,750
I want to know why Vinod can't get
his share. Just because of this will?

628
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,580
What wrong has he done?
Has he stolen from somebody?

629
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,580
Has he robbed somebody?
Has he killed somebody?

630
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,870
But look at this mother!

631
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,440
You're a woman.
Why can't you behave like a woman?

632
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,080
You whispered something in Father's ears
and got him to make this will.

633
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,840
You've conveniently sidelined
me and my views.

634
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:10,900
Gokul, come to me.
Come!

635
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,710
Mother, I always thought you
were a very good woman.

636
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,680
But now I'm seeing that
you're just as bad as the others.

637
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,780
Women are like this only!

638
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,910
Don't say these kinds of things, my son.

639
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,980
I can understand what's going on
with you at the moment.

640
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,770
But what will people think?

641
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:47,550
- Mother!
- My son, you need to understand things better.

642
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,090
You're now the man of the house.

643
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,766
You're the elder son.

644
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,730
- Haran! Oh Haran!
- I'm just coming, Father.

645
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,380
No, Masterji, I know things
will happen only if I go.

646
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,500
I know Vinod very well.
He's upset with me.

647
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,920
He must've heard about the will.
And has gotten upset. Stupid guy!

648
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:11,600
Until he hears the whole story from me,
he won't believe anybody.

649
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,670
My parents have
completely ruined me, Masterji.

650
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,930
Gokul! Okay, I will send Haran
to Calcutta this very day.

651
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,090
He'll explain everything to Vinod.
And bring him back with him.

652
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,470
How dare he not come back?

653
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,570
- Haran!
- Yes, Father?

654
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,306
Make preparations for going to Calcutta.

655
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,210
- Today?
- Not just today, this very minute.

656
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,650
- Okay.
- And listen!

657
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,650
How much will the fare be?
There and back?

658
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,920
It'll be about...
fifty or sixty rupees.

659
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,890
Fifty or sixty rupees!

660
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,710
What's fifty or sixty rupees, Masterji?

661
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,320
Just make sure my brother
somehow returns home.

662
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,471
I'll take care of whatever
it costs you to bring him back.

663
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,480
Here, take this.

664
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,090
Five and five, that's ten.

665
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,870
That's eighty. And a further five.
That's eighty five.

666
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,890
- You keep five, Father. And give me eighty.
- Back off!

667
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,080
You think I'm a stupid lout like Gokul?

668
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:17,490
With just ten or fifteen rupees,
one can make a full trip of Calcutta.

669
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,130
But what I'm saying is,
what's the need to go to Calcutta at all?

670
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,360
Just sit quietly at home for two days.

671
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,830
And then tell Gokul that you
couldn't find Vinod at all.

672
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,866
Here, take two rupees
and buy yourself some sweets.

673
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,640
Look here, Father, you're of an age where
you sit at home and count your money.

674
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,060
And I'm of an age where I travel
and spend money.

675
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:41,190
- Here, give me fifty.
- Fifty! I'd sooner give you fifty slaps!

676
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,810
- Okay, don't then. I'll go and tell Gokul...
- Wait, wait, just listen.

677
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:49,660
Today's children don't even
spare their fathers!

678
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,980
Here, take ten rupees.

679
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,700
And go to your in-laws' place.

680
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,580
Spend two days there and come back.

681
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,756
Whatever you spend,
I'll give you double that money.

682
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,056
Are you going to give me forty now,
or should I go tell Gokul?

683
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:08,020
Okay, shh... don't shout like this. If
somebody hears us, we'll get into trouble.

684
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,900
Here, take another ten.
And leave me in peace.

685
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,720
Okay, give me another ten.

686
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,170
- Here, take another rupee.
- One rupee?

687
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,290
Now, start getting ready
and go to your in-laws' place.

688
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,160
- That we will see, where I go.
- What do you mean, "we will see"?

689
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,300
Today's youth doesn't even
understand the value of money.

690
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,470
I'll deposit it with my brother.

691
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,010
Aren't I alive anymore that you want
to deposit it with your brother?

692
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,640
- Here, give me the money.
- Leave it.

693
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,046
In your horoscope, you and Goddess Lakshmi
(goddess of money) don't seem to have a match.

694
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,790
As if you and I have a match!

695
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,960
Just listen to me!

696
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:53,140
I wonder how I ended up marrying this
woman! Goddess Durga, deliver me from this!

697
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:05,670
Master, Haran has come back from Calcutta.

698
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,340
He's back? Where is he?

699
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,810
He's at home.
But... Master... Master...

700
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,780
Master, please listen to me. Master!

701
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:26,480
Looks like you've just returned.
But why have you returned alone, Haran?

702
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,200
- Did you manage to meet Vinod or not?
- Yes, I did.

703
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,570
- And how is he, Haran?
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.

704
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,230
But why didn't you
bring him back with you?

705
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:42,270
I tried hard, Gokul. But it looks like
he's not going to come back now.

706
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,690
He's not going to come back? But why?

707
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,350
I think it's better
not to ask these questions.

708
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:51,649
You're lying. You are jealous of Vinod.

709
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:53,629
The whole village is jealous of Vinod.

710
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,120
Maybe you didn't go to Calcutta at all.

711
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:59,090
You just wandered around a bit,
blew up the money and have come back.

712
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,550
I know not just you,
I know your entire lineage.

713
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,550
You eat up my money,
and try to make a fool of me?

714
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:12,930
You thief! You gambler! You scoundrel!
I'll see how you get away with this!

715
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,950
I'll take the whole village to task!

716
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,650
Jaddu! Have you told Mother?

717
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,330
- Gokul, drink your milk.
- I don't want it. Get out of here!

718
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:33,819
It's always "drink milk, eat your food,
do this, do that".

719
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,540
As if I don't have other work to do.

720
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,560
Master, the list of donations
for the Vaman priests is ready.

721
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:50,160
- Master?
- My father didn't leave an estate, that I go about treating priests like kings.

722
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:55,130
Go, tell all of them that this practice
won't continue in our home anymore.

723
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,060
It's all a fraud, brother.
It's all a fraud.

724
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,160
It's not just the business.

725
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:07,150
The house, garden, jewelry, money...
Gokul's taken everything.

726
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,876
He's not left one paisa for this poor guy.

727
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,570
So now Vinod has to be
at his mercy all his life?

728
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,360
Not just Vinod but his mother as well.

729
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,310
And this poor boy was always saying
"Brother, brother"...

730
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,620
After all, that's why a stepbrother
is a stepbrother.

731
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:21,000
Mother, anybody who listens
to you is an idiot.

732
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,620
Just because Father used to listen to you,
it doesn't mean I should too.

733
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,650
I'll be "pure" if I feed just one Brahmin.
I don't need to feed them all.

734
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,150
Son, he is in heaven right now.

735
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,360
Is this the way to speak about him?

736
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,650
And if you behave like this,
won't people say all sorts of things?

737
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:52,560
Let them say whatever they want.
I'm not scared of anybody.

738
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:59,040
Look here, son. He has left us with
so much wealth and property.

739
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:09,510
If we don't even do his last rites
properly, how will his soul rest in peace?

740
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:14,560
When did I object to spending money,
Mother? Spend whatever you like.

741
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,600
But Vinod has got upset
and is refusing to leave Calcutta.

742
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,370
Now you tell me what all
and I manage all by myself.

743
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,610
Gokul, does Vinod even know about this?

744
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:34,500
- Of course he does, Mother.
- Who informed him then?

745
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,200
He's got the news, Mother.

746
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,980
Father's left us forever,
you think he doesn't know this?

747
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,920
You think his heart won't know
the pain I'm feeling?

748
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,360
He knows everything, Mother.
He knows everything.

749
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,540
If this is indeed true, then don't
feel sorry for such a brother.

750
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,450
Just assume that there was
no other son in our lineage.

751
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,020
If he's so upset that he can't
even come for his father's last rites...

752
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,880
then we won't have
anything more to do with him.

753
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,600
- What are you saying, Mother?
- She's absolutely right.

754
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,400
You think Father has done all this
without thinking it through?

755
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,690
He definitely had foresight.

756
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,640
When, after searching so much in Calcutta,
your brother couldn't be found...

757
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,350
your father correctly surmised
his qualities very well.

758
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,700
That's why Father has left
all the property in our name.

759
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,860
Now how can anybody blame us for this?

760
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,400
It's you who constantly
says "brother, brother".

761
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,176
- Anybody else would have...
- Did you hear that, Mother?

762
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,170
This is how an upper class girl speaks.

763
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,210
Say whatever you like about me.
Don't talk about my father or grandfather.

764
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,440
- My father and yours are very similar.
- What did you say?

765
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:06,610
Look here, dear, you needn't get involved.
You should stick to your work. Go.

766
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,700
I've never opened my mouth before now.

767
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:13,350
The only thing I've been doing is
working day and night like a servant.

768
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:18,330
But when I see him do nothing
day and night except keep saying...

769
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:21,130
"my brother has passed this",
"my brother has passed that"...

770
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,770
has that brother ever had a
normal conversation with him?

771
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:29,460
If my husband had any self-respect at all,
I wouldn't even need to tell him anything.

772
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,410
The only purpose his elder brother serves
is to send him lots of money every month.

773
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,746
But if I try to make him understand even a
little bit, I'm the one who gets shouted at.

774
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,980
I don't care anymore if anybody
thinks I've got a sharp tongue...

775
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,030
but I can't sit and watch my money
going down the drain...

776
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,290
and not even think
of the future of my kids.

777
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,420
Don't expect me to sit quiet anymore.

778
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,750
If he's milking his simpleton elder
brother, let him. Why should I care?

779
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,700
But he should realize his own
children will be out on the streets.

780
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:06,540
Me a simpleton?
Who says I'm a simpleton?

781
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:10,550
After all, who's earned all this property?
Vinod or I?

782
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:15,050
You think Vinod could possibly
make a fool of me?

783
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,190
He's the younger one, I'm the older one.

784
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:22,280
He may have passed four exams,
I can pass ten such exams.

785
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,120
Let him try to enter the house.
I'll stop him and kick him out.

786
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:33,130
I'd also like to see who allows
Vinod to enter the house.

787
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:38,000
Look here, Vinod. No doubt
you're going back home...

788
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,070
but make sure you don't
talk much with Gokul...

789
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:44,410
or even touch the keys to the business
or the safe. Understood?

790
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,480
We'll see you again after first meeting some
lawyers and getting their advice. Come on!

791
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,456
Mother! Mother! Uncle has arrived.
Uncle has arrived.

792
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,510
Then why are you making a commotion?
When did he arrive?

793
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,000
He arrived late at night.

794
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,440
- What's he doing now?
- He hasn't awakened yet.

795
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,020
He's sleeping in the new house.

796
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:19,820
Okay, now you go and play.
And don't wake up your father.

797
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:30,870
Come here! Come here quickly!
What did your grandma tell your uncle?

798
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:32,710
I don't know, Father.

799
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,380
She must've got very angry with him.
Must have scolded him, right?

800
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,170
- Yes, maybe.
- Now, tell me the truth.

801
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,270
What did your grandma tell your uncle?

802
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:45,210
- I don't know, Father. I was sleeping.
- You're lying!

803
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,050
Looks like you're in cahoots
with your grandma.

804
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,270
Mother!

805
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,610
Mother!

806
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,640
Vinod, I've explained everything to Mother.

807
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,740
You weren't in Calcutta
at the time, anyway.

808
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,710
So if you didn't even get the news,
it's not your fault, is it?

809
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:34,660
Er, Vinod, you'd left Calcutta
and gone to Hazaribagh...

810
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,630
and here Father, in his last days...

811
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,080
Anyway, we can talk about that later.

812
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,420
Just writing out a will
doesn't change anything, does it?

813
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,470
You understand, don't you?

814
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:51,000
But the people here are such crooks.
You know how they are!

815
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,890
You know what? From now on,
you keep these keys to the safe.

816
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,610
And listen, all the priests
have been invited.

817
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:03,210
You decide who needs to get how much. Only
you can do this sort of thing properly.

818
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:08,890
And my brother, I don't have time to sit
and have long discussions with you.

819
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:13,180
Please don't involve me in these things.
I won't even touch these keys.

820
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,790
You won't even touch these keys?

821
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,910
Where's the need to?
After all, I'm an outsider.

822
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:27,140
I've come here for a couple of days.
And I'll leave in a day or two.

823
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,300
You're leaving? You're leaving, Vinod?

824
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,400
I have no choice.

825
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,940
And then, this is all about money matters.

826
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,150
I am a poor, needy person.

827
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,940
If I can't give you an exact account
of everything, you'll label me a thief.

828
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:52,010
Maybe you'd even turn me over to the police
and get me sent to jail.

829
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,650
- Did you get to speak to your brother?
- No.

830
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,720
Did you hear what he's
going around telling people?

831
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,990
He's saying he didn't even
receive news of Father's death.

832
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,600
He's saying he was in Hazaribagh
or some such place.

833
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,270
Oh God, look at the types of lies
people come up with nowadays.

834
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:28,880
Lies? You don't believe him?

835
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:33,940
Believe him?
Am I an innocent kid or what?

836
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,310
Even if he swears the truth, standing
in the Ganges, I wouldn't believe him.

837
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,940
Listen, from now on,
you need to be very careful.

838
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,650
This is the time people will be playing
all sorts of nasty games.

839
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:55,480
You shouldn't do anything
without first checking with my father.

840
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,890
He'll be here first thing in the morning.

841
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,930
- Who'll be here first thing in the morning?
- My father.

842
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,760
Your father's coming here?

843
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:11,170
Why not? In these difficult times, would he
forsake his daughter and son-in-law?

844
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,130
I've explained everything to him
very clearly in my letter.

845
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,560
Get, some more vegetables!
See, there's no chutney on that leaf.

846
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,360
You people don't notice things properly.

847
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,426
Look here, if there's any shortcoming
on our part, please excuse us.

848
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,000
I've come in a great hurry from Calcutta.

849
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,370
I haven't been able
to attend to anything myself.

850
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:51,210
And Gokul is still just a young boy.

851
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:53,280
He needs your blessings.

852
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:58,990
You people have graced this occasion.
I'm very thankful for it.

853
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,380
I've made one thing very clear to him.
His brother won't be staying in this house.

854
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,700
He can choose to get a job
or do whatever he likes.

855
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,996
What did he say then?

856
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,150
What could he say?
You think I'm scared of him?

857
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,060
Come here, my son, come here.

858
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,746
You called for me?

859
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:24,340
An arrow that's left a bow and a word
that's left a mouth... can they return?

860
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,990
Tell me, can they return?

861
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,326
Of course not.

862
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,430
Then what is this you're
going about telling people?

863
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:35,120
That Vinod was in Hazaribagh and
therefore couldn't be here?

864
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,970
This way you're chopping
your own foot with the ax.

865
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,856
Father, that's exactly what's happening.
And that's why I called you here.

866
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,110
My son, court cases are a
very nasty thing to get involved in.

867
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:49,040
Don't people curse their enemies
"May you get caught up in court cases!"?

868
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,040
And that's exactly what's started
to happen in this household.

869
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,430
My dear, just go outside
and see if anyone's listening to us.

870
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,680
One never knows.
This is enemy territory now.

871
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,670
Sit down, my son, sit down.

872
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:14,340
Look here, my son, this Nimai Rai has never
been afraid of court cases. And will never be.

873
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,690
On just hearing my name,
the faces of the best of lawyers go pale.

874
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,980
And this boy here is just a little boy.

875
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,770
So what if he's learned
a few words of English?

876
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,720
Who are you talking about?
Who's going to file a case?

877
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:32,230
- What?
- Did you hear that, Father? He's asking who's going to file a case.

878
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,250
I swear in your name, you will not find
a bigger simpleton in this world.

879
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,990
It would be a piece of cake for his brother
to just cheat him out of everything.

880
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:43,510
I'm just so relieved you've come.

881
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:48,250
Otherwise, in less than a year, you'd see
daughter and grandchildren on the streets.

882
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,330
Vinod's going to file a case?

883
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,360
- Against me?
- Just listen to that, Father!

884
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,626
Now, is this even something
to be surprised about, my son?

885
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:03,300
The entire village knows that Ashu
Mallick's two sons are supporting Vinod.

886
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,640
And that a lawyer is coming from Calcutta.

887
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:09,180
And here's this man, going around doing
all he can to please that very brother.

888
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:18,070
When you people have begged me
to be your boatman in this storm...

889
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,580
I can take charge. And I will.

890
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:26,600
But you also need to then ensure
that you sit when I tell you to sit...

891
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,620
and stand up
when I tell you to stand up.

892
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:31,770
Where are you going?

893
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,420
Maybe he's going to ask his brother.

894
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,420
I tell you, that's the kind of effect
money has on people.

895
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,040
It can sour the relationship
even between brothers...

896
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,010
and here it is a case
of a stepbrother after all.

897
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,556
Gokul won't give us even a paisa
without our fighting a case for it.

898
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,280
That's what even I am saying.
We've therefore taken the advice...

899
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,000
of Calcutta's top lawyer, Mr. Dutt.

900
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,370
And we've also explained it all
to our two lawyers.

901
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,420
So Vinod, you have nothing
to worry about now.

902
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,686
- We're with you. Don't you agree, Ramesh?
- Yes, of course we are.

903
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,150
Gokul will have to give you your share.

904
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,486
- Even if we have to go to the High Court...
- Have you heard enough...

905
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:15,050
or do you want to hear more?

906
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,510
That's great, Mr. Chakravarty.
I wasn't here...

907
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,410
so God knows how much money
you've been swindling.

908
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,326
I was only...

909
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:43,510
Okay, tell me how in just one month
a thousand rupees was sent to Vinod?

910
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,390
That's what Master told me...

911
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:48,410
- Nonsense! Your master isn't so foolish...
- Easy, my son.

912
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:52,640
Even if we accept that Vinod
tried to get money out of you...

913
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:56,390
it was your responsibility
to advise Gokul properly, wasn't it?

914
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,850
Why would he advise him, Father?
He's hand-in-hand with the enemy.

915
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:01,410
Wait, my son.

916
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:05,140
- Mr. Chakravarty, now you can pack up your bags.
- Sir?

917
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,550
You're being dismissed from your job.

918
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:10,160
But Sir, I've been
serving here all my life.

919
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:12,680
Master knows me very well.

920
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,620
Shut up! You think my father can also
be fooled like your master?

921
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,370
Master, my salary of four months...

922
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,690
Of course, Chakravarty Sir,
that is outstanding anyway.

923
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,451
- Other than that, if there is anything...
- Wait, my son.

924
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,900
You just keep quiet.

925
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,150
Look here, I'm the
owner of the shop, not he.

926
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:42,600
My word is the final word.

927
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,760
And hear me out carefully,
you will not get your salary.

928
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,430
Consider it your good fortune...

929
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:52,570
Consider it your father's good fortune,
I'm not sending you to jail. Got it?

930
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,970
The door's at this end.
The door's at this end!

931
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:04,450
- Chakravarty Sir!
- Look here.

932
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,840
If you interfere
once more in my father's decisions...

933
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,736
I'll either take the children
and go to my in-laws' place...

934
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,610
or tie a noose around my neck
and kill myself.

935
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,150
Father, why don't you get Nandlal
also into the business?

936
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:29,870
But my dear, that's exactly why I brought
Nandlal with me in the first place.

937
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,520
I can't be here all the time.

938
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,990
Otherwise my business
back home will suffer.

939
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:42,690
You don't worry, dear. I'll train him well
and leave him here with you.

940
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:47,590
However he is, after all he is my son.

941
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,570
But Father, you'd better arrange it
before you leave. Can't trust this man.

942
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,500
Master, your mother is here.

943
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:10,390
Gokul, who asked you
to embark on this madness?

944
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,960
Chakravarty Sir has been with us
for many years.

945
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,070
For as long as he lives,
I am keeping him in our employ.

946
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,800
Let him take the books
and go to the shop.

947
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,140
There's one other thing, Gokul.

948
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,210
Your father-in-law has been
kind enough to visit us...

949
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:30,770
so let him even stay for four days
if he likes, rather than two.

950
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:36,860
But he needn't worry about what happens
in our shop, if money gets stolen or not.

951
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,780
Chakravarty Sir, please don't delay.
Please go to the shop.

952
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:46,860
I don't want any outsider to sit in my shop
and have access to the books.

953
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,040
Gokul, give him the keys so he can go.

954
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:04,060
This is what's called controlling
other people's money.

955
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,650
Look at the way she orders others around.

956
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:12,820
Let's face it, Father. If we're here,
how will people get a chance to steal?

957
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,480
Why? What are you standing here for?

958
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:21,070
I thought, you're a Brahmin, I'll give
you five or ten rupees, then leave.

959
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:25,490
But you're back to your bad ways. I should've
sent you to jail in the first place.

960
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,780
You crook! Get out from my sight!

961
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,210
Master, please give me the keys.
I'm going to the shop.

962
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:22,100
In a few days, all arrangements
can be made. What do you say?

963
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:26,760
Yes, but it's very important to get
Vinod's mother on our side.

964
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,830
Please come, Rai moshai, please come.

965
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:36,396
Look here, Rai moshai, however much Gokul
may have grown up, he's still a boy.

966
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:40,210
- That's true, Panditji.
This boy doesn't understand...

967
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,900
the complications of court cases.
If he comes unglued tomorrow...

968
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:45,480
the responsibility for him
will be on you.

969
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:49,560
I'm willing to take the burden
on my shoulders, but..

970
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:53,430
No ifs ands or buts.
Gokul is like your own son.

971
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,350
He'll do exactly as you say.

972
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,210
Then Panditji, with your blessings,
I'll show people here what I can do.

973
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,990
One thing's for sure.

974
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:08,100
I'm not going to allow the enemy
to stay in this house any longer.

975
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:11,000
Whether it is my son-in-law's mother.
Or brother.

976
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,220
And until I get Chakravarty out of the way,
I won't drink a glass of water.

977
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:17,840
- Is there somebody?
- Don't speak ill of Chakravarty Sir.

978
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:21,470
- Look here, Gokul...
- But Masterji, Mother won't dismiss him.

979
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,690
And Father hasn't given me
permission to overrule Mother.

980
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:29,380
Oh, so Chakravarty will stay at the shop?

981
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,026
Yes, he will.

982
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:32,760
And what will then happen to Rai moshai?

983
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:34,230
He's most welcome to go back home.

984
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,340
I'll ask Mother to send send money
to cover any loss of his.

985
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:48,550
Father, tell me, is it a good thing
for a widow to covet wealth?

986
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:56,580
- Son, first of all, a women of good virtue can never become a widow.
- Oh, I see.

987
01:30:56,950 --> 01:31:03,040
And son, if you're a widow...
and you covet wealth...

988
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,580
then the scriptures say
that for such a woman...

989
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:10,050
there was no good
in her previous birth...

990
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,520
there is no good for her
in her present birth...

991
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,300
and there will be no good
in her next birth.

992
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:19,330
Rama dear, remember, today is Monday.

993
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:24,070
- I will have only milk at night.
- Yes, Father.

994
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,140
May I ask you something?

995
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,630
Doesn't Gokul want me to stay
in this house any longer?

996
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:56,450
And if this is what Gokul wants,
why doesn't he tell me so himself?

997
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:00,430
Why does he allow me to be taunted so,
by your brother and father?

998
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:05,010
The whole world knows
who has taunted whom.

999
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:10,050
If I try to save my property by having
my father and brother manage it...

1000
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,550
why does anyone
have a problem with that?

1001
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,540
Why is it necessary to ruin someone
to benefit another?

1002
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:21,510
Why, dear, who am I ruining?

1003
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:25,470
Those you are ruining,
are also the ones who are taunting you.

1004
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:28,151
Can't blame them.
And I can't do anything about it either.

1005
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,716
He who throws bricks, must be prepared
to get stones back in return.

1006
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,700
Just getting upset is
not going to solve anything.

1007
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,430
Mother!

1008
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:58,440
Mother, I've rented a small place
near the railway line.

1009
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,410
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.

1010
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:07,270
Vinod, take me also with you, my son.

1011
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:11,140
I can't stand the taunts here any longer.

1012
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,610
I'll live there in any
condition, no problem.

1013
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,770
Somehow get me out of this place,
my son.

1014
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,520
Mother!

1015
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:48,550
Brother, I'm taking Mother when I move
to my new place tomorrow morning.

1016
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,380
- New place?
- Yes.

1017
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:55,690
So you've found yourself a new place
without even discussing it with me?

1018
01:34:55,950 --> 01:35:00,480
- Yes.
- In other words, you've stopped your studies?

1019
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:05,030
Yes, I have.

1020
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:15,810
Vinod, you won't pass MA?

1021
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:20,070
No, I won't.

1022
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:27,550
Anyway, tell me how you'll
support Mother in the new place.

1023
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,140
That remains to be seen.

1024
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,120
I've got myself a job
which pays fifty rupees.

1025
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:36,990
What? A job?
You're going to take a job?

1026
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:40,900
A job that pays fifty rupees?
With me still alive, you'll get a job?

1027
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,790
Stupid man!

1028
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:49,750
- And you've asked Mother if she's ready to go with you?
- She's ready.

1029
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:52,050
I only had to ask you.

1030
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:58,940
Ask me? What's the need to ask me?
Who am I to all of you?

1031
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:04,530
Go wherever you want to go.
It's not like I've chained you or anything.

1032
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,620
Come on, bring everything quickly!

1033
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:37,020
Put it here.

1034
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,980
And listen, you people sit here.

1035
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:53,160
Mother, the palanquin's here.

1036
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:56,540
If you're ready, come quickly.
I have to go to work after that.

1037
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,990
Mahua, tell Mother she can't go today.

1038
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,030
Why, Master? What's the problem?

1039
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:29,150
Today is Dashami.
Ours is a home with children.

1040
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:31,356
If you travel on Dashami,
something will happen to the children.

1041
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,220
Tell Mother I'm not going to allow her
to leave under any circumstances.

1042
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:35,950
If she likes, she can go tomorrow.

1043
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,840
Jaddu, send back the palanquin.

1044
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:44,020
When she's going of her own accord,
why stop her?

1045
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,690
I want to, I stop her!

1046
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:47,590
She's the head of the family.

1047
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:50,530
If she leaves today,
and the children start dying tomorrow?

1048
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,760
Jaddu, what are you staring at?
Send back the palanquin.

1049
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:58,090
What are you guys staring at?

1050
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:01,420
Take back the palanquin.
Mother won't be leaving today.

1051
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,380
Does anybody leave on the day of Dashami?

1052
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:06,730
Won't something bad happen?

1053
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:12,510
Son, what's the use of just one going?

1054
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:17,650
Until a few more leave,
there will be no peace.

1055
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:21,750
But Father, I'd heard that even a witch
does not rob her own.

1056
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,080
That was in the golden age.

1057
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:28,060
In this age, a witch doesn't
even spare her own home.

1058
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,170
After all, this is Kalyug for a reason.

1059
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,970
Rama dear, is the halwa ready?

1060
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:37,780
Yes, Father.

1061
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:51,640
Brother, I'm taking Mother with me today.
Please don't obstruct me today.

1062
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:59,640
It won't be possible for her
to go today, Vinod.

1063
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:03,656
Why not?
I'm taking her with me right now.

1064
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:07,300
"Taking her with me"!
Who are you to take her with you?

1065
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,170
Father told Mother to stay with me.

1066
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:12,210
He didn't leave her in your care.

1067
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:16,230
Go, do your job.
"Take Mother with me"!

1068
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:21,170
Brother, if you'd really
taken care of Mother...

1069
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:24,400
she wouldn't have to listen to
taunts in this house, day and night.

1070
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:31,030
Mother, come out.
The palanquin is ready.

1071
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:49,990
Mother! Are you really going?

1072
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,530
Where are you going, Grandma?

1073
01:39:58,050 --> 01:39:59,770
Tell me, Grandma,
where are you going?

1074
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,360
Look here, Mother,
if you insist on leaving like this...

1075
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,880
then that will be the end
of our relationship.

1076
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:14,560
Father, Grandma is leaving.
Stop her, Father.

1077
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,400
Mother!

1078
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:41,250
Mother, am I not your son,
that you're leaving me like this?

1079
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:43,430
Didn't you bring me up too?

1080
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,770
Now what's happened to you?

1081
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:18,210
- Where are you going?
- Kashi. - Kashi?

1082
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,210
What to do?
Mother has gone off with Vinod.

1083
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:26,000
And here Master's father-in-law
is constantly harassing me.

1084
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:28,620
Gokul doesn't even speak
to me properly anymore.

1085
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,540
And you also left me.

1086
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:35,520
So I'm going to Kashi
to get my head shaven.

1087
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:43,410
- Okay, get your head shaven later. First eat what I've got you.
- Okay.

1088
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:06,920
- Oh, so it is you?
- Greetings, Sir!

1089
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:10,650
What a wonderful place!

1090
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:14,550
Looking at this palace,
my eyes are gleaming.

1091
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:20,690
But, gentlemen, the way you left
Calcutta was very sudden.

1092
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:25,750
The other day,
when we landed up at your place...

1093
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:27,900
all we found was a lock on the door.

1094
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:29,860
That too a lock from Aligarh.

1095
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:34,140
We're very sorry that the day
we were leaving, we couldn't...

1096
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,340
And Sir, these two girls
cried their eyes out for you.

1097
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:44,630
They lost interest in music,
dance, and everything.

1098
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,400
As for me, I've been roaming the streets
looking for you...

1099
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:54,070
from Howrah Bridge to Tollygunge,
and Shyam Bazar to Ballygunge.

1100
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:58,850
Finally I managed to get
your address from the police.

1101
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,290
- The police?
- What else could I do?

1102
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,220
After all, it's a matter
of three thousand rupees.

1103
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,390
Oh, why did you
trouble yourself so much?

1104
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:13,330
Just this morning,
we sent you a money order.

1105
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,910
- Right, Ramesh? - Of course.
- What can I say...

1106
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,540
when they come up
with such replies?

1107
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:21,610
Sirs, you can at least not lie
for once in your life.

1108
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:30,070
Okay, listen, the truth is that there's
still a problem for a few days more.

1109
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:31,690
- Right, Ramesh?
- Of course.

1110
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,510
After that, you'll get whatever you ask.

1111
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,560
- On top of that, we'll give you a reward too. Right, Ramesh?
- Totally.

1112
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,150
- You know our friend, Vinod Majumdar, B.A. Hons?
- He's sitting upstairs.

1113
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:43,970
In just a few days, he's going to
get a share of his father's property.

1114
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:47,010
- Three or four lakh rupees.
- Four lakhs!

1115
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:52,530
Girls, what are you waiting for?
Greet the gentlemen! Greetings!

1116
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:14,230
Mother, I'm not going
to have dinner today.

1117
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17,400
I've eaten and drunk a lot today.

1118
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:36,340
Whatever happened, Mahua,
it was just the right thing to happen.

1119
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:43,290
It was the right decision not to
give this boy any wealth or property.

1120
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:47,840
Even if Gokul's been caught up
in his father-in-law's games...

1121
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:51,080
and treats us in a shabby manner...

1122
01:44:52,330 --> 01:45:00,330
at least he's taking good care of the business
that his father so painstakingly built up.

1123
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:08,960
At least his father's
soul will be at peace.

1124
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,380
I can't give Vinod anything, Sir.

1125
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:18,850
I can't violate the instructions Father
gave me at the time of his death.

1126
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:21,140
These are all only verbal things, Gokul.

1127
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,890
My clients may be forced
to adopt different means.

1128
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:29,680
Tell them to adopt whatever means
they like. And you do what you like.

1129
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:35,340
And the men who've sent you here, Ramesh
and Suresh, they can do what they like.

1130
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:41,150
- Tomorrow is Vaishakh Sankaranthi.
- Tomorrow?

1131
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:44,540
Every year, you arrange to feed
all the Brahmins in the village.

1132
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,700
What will happen to that tomorrow?

1133
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,180
You don't have any money
in your hands anymore.

1134
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,350
You haven't told Vinod about this yet?

1135
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:55,450
I did tell him. But he hasn't paid
any attention to it at all.

1136
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,160
Okay, let him come today.
I'll remind him about it.

1137
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,660
You go and sleep now.

1138
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:01,630
When he comes,
I'll take it up with him.

1139
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,930
The flowers are blossoming
in the gardens

1140
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,390
The buds are blooming into flowers

1141
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:56,170
The beautiful season of Spring
is upon us

1142
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:07,150
All my friends have gone
to their husbands' places

1143
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:15,580
I have been left alone

1144
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:29,280
What should I do,
I am charmed by you

1145
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:37,890
My body burns with a sweet fire

1146
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,860
Oh my beloved!

1147
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:02,890
Ever since I've fallen
in love with you...

1148
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:06,350
sleep has vanished from my eyes

1149
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:15,990
Men and womenfolk are jealous of me

1150
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:19,310
They don't understand my pain

1151
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:54,560
My friends make fun of me

1152
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,900
They taunt me when I walk by

1153
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,500
My friends are also annoyed with me

1154
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:10,930
I got thrown out of their group

1155
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:08,830
You didn't sleep all night?

1156
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,440
The young master hasn't even come yet.

1157
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:17,270
What will happen to the feeding
of the Brahmins?

1158
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,140
I've decided to stop the practice.

1159
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,150
I'll keep only a fast.

1160
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:26,746
But you've been doing this
for twenty years!

1161
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,290
Then what do you
want me to do, Mahua?

1162
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,670
It now depends on what he wants.

1163
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,220
Open the door!

1164
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,990
Are all of you still sleeping?

1165
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,050
Open the door!

1166
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,300
- What is all this?
- Get out of the way!

1167
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:56,540
You're always asking "what is this,
what is that"? Can't you see?

1168
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,800
There are fruits, there's ghee,
there are vegetables, there are sweets...

1169
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,470
and lots of other things.
Come on, bring everything here.

1170
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:09,660
Keep everything properly.
Bring it here. Put it here.

1171
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,830
Open your eyes and see
where you're putting things.

1172
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:17,520
Mahua, I've gone
and invited all the Brahmins.

1173
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,280
You think I could have left
this responsibility to that man?

1174
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,190
Where's Mother? She's probably asleep.

1175
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:27,270
Like mother, like son.
Nobody seems to be bothered.

1176
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:30,070
As if I'm the only one here
who has to take care of everything.

1177
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:34,560
Tell Mother they'll handle everything.
I'll return in a couple of hours.

1178
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:48,700
Why are you staring at my face?
Give Chakravarty Sir milk. There.

1179
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:53,020
Masterji, why aren't you taking more?

1180
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:57,110
Enough, Gokul, enough. I'm feeling a little
under the weather today.

1181
01:51:57,390 --> 01:52:00,636
Otherwise I'd have eaten another
twenty or twenty five rasgullas.

1182
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:04,140
Bring the rasgullas.
Why are you staring at my face?

1183
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:13,980
Ganguly babu, you're not eating anything.
How is this possible?

1184
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,400
At least have some fruits.

1185
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:30,120
Come, Vinod, come.
No point in being shy in your own house.

1186
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:34,330
Even the feeding of Brahmins is done
and there's no sign of you?

1187
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:39,130
Sit down. Do you understand
this new game your brother is playing?

1188
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:44,330
- Game?
- You didn't get it? Looks like you'll definitely win the case.

1189
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,500
Okay, so you've passed the BA.

1190
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:52,170
But you haven't learned yet that
gaining control of your mother is the goal.

1191
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:55,920
Because the weight of the entire case
depends on just this.

1192
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:58,280
No, Masterji. It's nothing of the sort.

1193
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:03,520
Gokul, now was I your teacher,
or were you my teacher?

1194
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:13,740
Don't allow this Gokul to enter your house.
Otherwise he'll ruin you.

1195
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,750
Baba, he's left without even eating.

1196
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,240
If he hasn't eaten here,
he'll eat at home.

1197
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,100
Mother! Mother!

1198
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:42,130
Son, you're really something!

1199
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,610
There they are,
preparing for the case against us...

1200
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:48,190
and here you are,
running to their house all the time.

1201
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:52,400
Today he's gone
and got us insulted by his mother.

1202
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:54,080
What do we do now?

1203
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:58,070
I'm telling you, if you ever go
to the enemy's home again...

1204
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:00,970
- I'll jump into the river and kill myself.
- Then go kill yourself!

1205
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:06,440
Peace, son, peace.
What's there to get upset over?

1206
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,460
Son, you think your mother
is a very decent lady.

1207
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,680
- But she's a first class...
- Stop it!

1208
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:18,440
From now on, if anyone says anything
like this about my mother...

1209
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:21,830
I'll drag him or her by the neck
and throw the person outside.

1210
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:44,270
Vinod, what's all this I'm hearing
about a court case?

1211
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,310
- Court case?
- What was Jailal Master talking about the other day?

1212
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:52,850
Are you going to file a court case?

1213
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:58,460
Mother, well... court case...
it is a sort of...

1214
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,060
Anyway, you won't
understand all that, Mother.

1215
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,600
It's not something women will understand.

1216
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,430
I won't understand? And you will?

1217
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:09,990
Careful! I don't want
to hear such things again!

1218
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:13,830
And I don't want you
to mix with those people.

1219
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:20,890
The other day, Jailal Master,
in front of everyone in your own home...

1220
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,260
insulted your brother. And you just
sat there quietly, watching it all?

1221
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,870
I think from now on
Gokul will never come here.

1222
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,690
And even if he does,
how will I show him my face?

1223
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:39,140
What has brother done for you, Mother?

1224
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,120
You raised him when he was a child,
you made him a man.

1225
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:46,710
- And now, thanks to him, you had to leave your home empty-handed.
- Vinod!

1226
01:55:49,090 --> 01:55:53,650
Don't you feel any shame at all?
Is this why you brought me here?

1227
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,710
You don't even measure
up to Gokul's shoes.

1228
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:02,640
At least he doesn't
bring dishonor to the family.

1229
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:06,800
You've been born from my womb,
but you're an enemy.

1230
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:09,850
My real son is actually Gokul.

1231
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:16,960
And now you've made sure
I can't even show him my face.

1232
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:26,870
Eat something before you go.
It's your birthday today.

1233
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:31,110
So what if it's my birthday?
All that disappears as my mother leaves.

1234
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:35,140
You're talking as if nobody else
knows how to cook here.

1235
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:37,260
See what I've made today.

1236
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:41,210
Go, give all this to your father
and to your brother. There they are.

1237
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,640
So, Mahua, have all of you eaten?

1238
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:07,920
Oh, it's terribly warm today.
Just get me a glass of water, will you?

1239
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,300
I came here because I have
some business in this area.

1240
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:15,700
I'm tired of roaming around
in this heat.

1241
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:25,840
Vinod must have gone out.
And Mother is probably sleeping.

1242
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:28,260
- No, Master...
- Okay, okay, let her take rest.

1243
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,220
Okay, tell me Mahua, in this dark age,
is there any virtue left at all?

1244
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:43,950
- What, Master?
- Sit down! Sit down!

1245
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:51,440
Look here, Mahua, before Father died,
he entrusted Mother to my care, right?

1246
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:55,530
- Tell me!
- Yes, Master, he did.

1247
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:58,430
Then who is Vinod to bring Mother here?

1248
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:01,470
Am I not Mother's son?

1249
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:05,580
You think I can't take Mother
back with me by force?

1250
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:11,250
- Tell me, can't I?
- Yes, you can, Master.

1251
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,420
But I am just a straightforward person.

1252
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:22,700
Otherwise, you think Vinod would have
the courage to take Mother from me?

1253
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,370
Master!

1254
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,440
- Tell Mother I'll come some other time.
- Master!

1255
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:47,780
- Master!
- Gokul! Gokul! Gokul!

1256
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:14,240
Mother! Mahua, Master hasn't returned yet.

1257
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:17,020
When did he leave, after having lunch?

1258
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:20,750
Lunch? What are you talking about, Munimji?

1259
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:24,100
He came here to this area on business.

1260
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:26,420
He just had a glass of water and left.

1261
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:29,900
Just hear that!
Today was Master's birthday!

1262
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:32,406
- Oh, no!
- First thing in the morning...

1263
01:59:32,430 --> 01:59:33,830
he had a fight at home.

1264
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:36,670
He left home saying,
"I'm going to have Mother's food today".

1265
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,190
Looks like he hasn't eaten at all, all day.

1266
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:49,250
Sis?

1267
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:12,010
Without Madhav, all of Brij is desolate

1268
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:20,460
Whether it is Gokul,
or the banks of the Yamuna...

1269
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,300
He has lots on his mind

1270
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:26,870
He must be looking
for you day and night

1271
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:30,510
If you have ever loved Him

1272
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:34,210
Krishna gives you so much love

1273
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:56,420
Mother Yashoda,
if Krishna had been your child...

1274
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:07,040
you would have protected him
like a little baby

1275
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:23,580
So what if He wasn't
born in your womb?

1276
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:27,770
He was still considered to be your child

1277
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:38,870
Though we are not
related to you in any way...

1278
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:43,040
we cannot stop ourselves
from saying this

1279
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:50,680
Without Krishna,
everything will go wrong

1280
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:11,480
If you'd told him not to go...

1281
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:15,670
he would never have gone
against your word

1282
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:26,920
We wouldn't have been
so morose without your child...

1283
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:30,860
and he wouldn't have agonized so much,
without his mother

1284
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:39,120
Alas, you didn't
even think for a moment

1285
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:12,050
No need to tell me anything, son.
I understand everything.

1286
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:14,440
What else can you expect
in the home of a zamindar?

1287
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:16,150
Tell those who don't know such things.

1288
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,550
But don't tell your brother-in-law.

1289
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:23,780
He thinks we're jealous of his brother
and therefore speaking ill of him.

1290
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:25,740
But what's going on there, Nandlal?

1291
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:28,720
Don't ask me, sis.
I'm even ashamed to talk about it.

1292
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,820
What's to be ashamed of
in telling the truth?

1293
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:37,590
There's all sorts of revelry happening.
Dance, music, drinking.

1294
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:42,250
And if anybody doesn't believe me,
he can go and see it with his own eyes.

1295
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:46,820
This isn't just today's news, dear.
This is a daily saga.

1296
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,850
But just look at this boy...

1297
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:55,170
who's given up his studies, faith,
brought dishonor to his family...

1298
02:03:55,450 --> 02:03:57,610
and is going about
drinking openly like this.

1299
02:04:06,930 --> 02:04:10,820
My attachment to you will never end,
even if I die

1300
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:50,280
I did not believe in your word anyway

1301
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:56,750
Yet I waited for you all night

1302
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:03,860
I was startled by every sound
in the silent night

1303
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:16,360
My heart repeated this again and again

1304
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:19,870
- What?
- Stay away from me!

1305
02:05:54,130 --> 02:06:02,130
If you keep making and breaking
your promises like this...

1306
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:08,400
my heart will lose hope and break

1307
02:06:08,830 --> 02:06:13,620
Don't ask anyone
about the state of my heart

1308
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:26,590
Listen to the lament coming
from my grave

1309
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:29,710
What?

1310
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:37,090
My attachment to you will never end,
even if I die

1311
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:55,560
Gokul! What are you doing?
You want to kill him?

1312
02:07:55,830 --> 02:07:58,220
Come on, boys. What are you
waiting for? Catch him!

1313
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,080
You scoundrel!
This is why you found your own place!

1314
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:18,140
Let me tell you a tale
about beauty and love

1315
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:25,270
Let me go! All of you are rogues!
You've destroyed my brother.

1316
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:28,520
I will see to each one of you!

1317
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:33,530
- But from both graves there was just this lament.
- What?

1318
02:08:33,860 --> 02:08:38,020
My attachment to you will never end,
even if I die

1319
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:58,080
Well done, Gokul!
First you grab all the property.

1320
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:02,750
Then you go and beat up your brother
in front of everybody.

1321
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:05,760
And now you say you
won't give him any share?

1322
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:08,240
Yes, I won't give him a share.
I won't give him anything.

1323
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:11,110
He's a drunk. He's a rogue.
He's a wastrel.

1324
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:14,670
I won't give him even one paisa.
You guys can do whatever you like!

1325
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,330
Look at him! After all, what can
you expect from a stepbrother?

1326
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:24,400
Okay, Gokul, even if we accept
that Vinod is a drunkard...

1327
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:28,190
who are you to steal
his share away from him?

1328
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:33,650
And Masterji, what is the evidence that,
at the time of his father's death...

1329
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:38,900
Gokul didn't indulge in some fraud or
skullduggery to grab the property?

1330
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:44,430
I committed fraud? I'm a trickster?

1331
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,610
Who says that I've committed fraud?

1332
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:49,230
The whole village says it.

1333
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:53,810
Can it ever happen that a father
gives all his property to one son...

1334
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:56,120
and doesn't leave even a paisa
to the other son?

1335
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:08,940
Okay, then I'm a fraudster.
I'm a trickster. I'm even a crook.

1336
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,800
Then go and file a case against me.
Let the court decide.

1337
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:21,886
- Gokul, my son...
- Now, all of you please just go away!

1338
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:26,850
Peace, my son, peace.
What are all of you standing here for?

1339
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,410
The matter is clear now.
You can go to the court.

1340
02:10:33,210 --> 02:10:37,820
Think once again, Rai moshai.
If the matter goes to the court...

1341
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:42,210
then even Gokul's mother will have to
stand in court as witness.

1342
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:51,130
You'll drag my mother to court?

1343
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:54,660
You'll make her stand in the witness box?

1344
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:06,040
Then you can have all this property!
Burn down this shop.

1345
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:09,840
- Son.
- You please stay out of this. Let this be decided this very day.

1346
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,000
Listen to me, Gokul!

1347
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:27,280
Sis! Sis! Sis! Master is dragging Vinod
and bringing him here.

1348
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:31,816
There are lots of other people
coming here too.

1349
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,410
I don't know what drama has happened.

1350
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:50,710
Mother! Pack your bags!
I'm giving all the property to this rogue.

1351
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:53,570
And the two of us, mother and son,
will go live in Kashi.

1352
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:11,260
What sort of childishness is this, son?
You will go to Kashi?

1353
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,900
Better your enemies go to Kashi!
Come, let's go home.

1354
02:12:14,750 --> 02:12:18,190
- Think, son, think of your children...
- You please stay out of this.

1355
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:20,520
I want this to be decided today.

1356
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:24,350
I am a fraudster, am I not?
I am a crook, am I not?

1357
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:27,550
- But brother...
- Your brother is dead! - Gokul!

1358
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:30,640
You'll take my mother to court?

1359
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:32,760
You'll make her stand in the witness box?

1360
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:34,770
And all this for property?

1361
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,330
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1362
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,000
Whatever you want to say in court,
you can say here. In front of everyone.

1363
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:46,540
Come here, touch my feet
and tell me I'm a fraud.

1364
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:51,850
Unless I give you the property instantly,
I'm not the son of Vaikunth Majumdar.

1365
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:57,690
What are you saying, son?
When has saying such things ever helped?

1366
02:12:57,790 --> 02:13:01,860
What are you thinking
so much about? Be brave.

1367
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:04,260
The entire property will become yours.

1368
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:07,590
Let them go to court.
We'll see what the court decides.

1369
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:09,690
- Come, let's go home.
- Leave me alone.

1370
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:17,600
While dying, Father had said to me
"Gokul, this belongs to both of you".

1371
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:22,820
"When Vinod gets back on the right track,
give him his share".

1372
02:13:24,590 --> 02:13:29,780
And Father is seeing from above I'm
watching over his property like a snake.

1373
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,590
I pray to God day and night that
the day should come soon...

1374
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:39,710
when Vinod comes back on track
and comes back home with Mother.

1375
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:42,480
And he says I am a fraud?

1376
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:46,770
Come, touch my feet and
say in front of everybody that...

1377
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:50,010
I have grabbed your property
through fraudulent means.

1378
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:54,370
Go, my son, touch his feet and say it.
What are you scared of?

1379
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:58,540
You won't get such a
golden opportunity again.

1380
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:04,750
You're right, Masterji. I won't get
such a golden opportunity again.

1381
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,590
Brother, I know you very well.

1382
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:29,910
If I touch your feet
and call you a fraud...

1383
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:33,700
then may my right hand be
cut off right now and fall off.

1384
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:38,510
I'll never be able to say this. Never.

1385
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:44,280
But today I swear, at these very feet...

1386
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:48,080
that I will never again touch drink.

1387
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:56,130
Brother, please give me your blessings that
from today I should be deserving...

1388
02:14:57,220 --> 02:15:01,290
of being called your younger brother.

1389
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,920
- Vinod!
- Brother!

1390
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:15,840
Vinod!

1391
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:39,130
Okay, all this has been going on
for too long now.

1392
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:41,900
Give me my five thousand right now.

1393
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:45,380
Otherwise I'll break
this building to pieces.

1394
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:51,560
And whatever little honor you have,
will also be ground to dust.

1395
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,880
Even then we won't let you get away.

1396
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:58,030
Even if we die, we will appear
before you as ghosts.

1397
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:01,440
And if anything should happen to you...

1398
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:03,760
we'll even land up
at the cremation ground.

1399
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:09,050
Neither will we be in peace,
nor will we let your souls be in peace.

1400
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:11,270
So, what do you want to say?

1401
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:29,990
Look, all of you. Look at
the love between brothers

1402
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:37,230
If this love had not been immortal,
what would be left in this world?
