Many ways lead nowhere.

But still we have
to walk on them.

At times willingly or
at times unwillingly.

Similarly, some people
enter into your life. .

00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,935
.. without an invitation.

6
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,068

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,101

10
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,135
A strange isolation,
an emptiness is experienced. .

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,901
.. within and around you.

12
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:29,103
This isolation screams..
yells.. creates disturbance

13
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,067
And then..

14
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,067

15
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,000
A Last Decision.

But he was very adamant.

399

He wanted to deal with
things on his own.

400
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:44,702
He wanted his father to feel
proud about him.

401

787
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,934

Security? - And I was
sent on this assignment.

But I had no other option.

And if that's the case then
I should go back home.

My wife is alone.
Anything can happen to her.

Nothing will happen to your wife

799
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,903

attacked you in the train?

you're saying you don't know.

and he was sent to kill you.

I couldn't keep you there.
Your life was at risk.

Do you know?
The man in the compartment..

813
01:12:31,866 --> 01:12:33,834
.. wanted to kill you too.

814
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,902
He could have killed you
anywhere during the journey.

815
01:12:39,733 --> 01:12:42,669
And I had a fight
with him for the same.

816
01:12:43,733 --> 01:12:47,803

so I had to let him go.

01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,567
Okay, I'll call you later.

872
01:17:10,433 --> 01:17:11,467
There's no tension at home.

873
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,435
It was good. Well done!

874
01:17:22,633 --> 01:17:24,601
Sir, car! Sir, car! - What?

875
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:26,434
That car, sir.

876
01:17:34,366 --> 01:17:35,366
Come out!

877
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:38,633
Where are you off to?

878
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:40,567
What's your problem?

879
01:17:40,566 --> 01:17:42,434
- You'll ask me
about the problem?

880
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:45,402
Look, don't forget that
you're in uniform. Do your duty.

881
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:48,435
Finger down. Who are you?
Commissioner?

882
01:17:48,566 --> 01:17:49,633
I agree I'm not Commissioner of

883
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,367
this area. But
I'm a Commissioner.

884
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,367
I know your seniors very well.

885
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:54,567
Learn to respect them.
- Yes, sir.

886
01:17:55,466 --> 01:17:58,335
Free him. - But, sir. we've
found a loaded gun with him.

887
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,501
He has a license.

888
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:01,533
And he hasn't committed
any crime. Free him.

889
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,568
Okay, sir. Thakur,
bring him. - Yes, sir.

890
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:05,533
Sir, tea or something?

891
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,502
Sir, the sweet mart here are
very famous. Please taste it.

892
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:18,501
Give him his gun.

893
01:18:26,433 --> 01:18:27,333
C'mon.

894
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:35,467
Get up! -
Who's it? - Up!

895
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,535
- Who are you?
- Where're they hiding?

896
01:18:38,366 --> 01:18:40,367
Who is hiding?
I was sleeping here.

What a co-incidence! Bheem!

910
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,200
For the first time..

911
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:10,370
.. I personally came out
for my work in so many years.

912
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:14,400
Because of you.

913
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,267
You're so kind, Victor.

914
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,234
Who did all this?
- Don't know, sir.

915

There's a twist in the tale.

919
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,367
Now there'll be fun.

920
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,368
Constable, take them
for the post-mortem.

921
01:22:04,133 --> 01:22:05,167
Orian sir!

922
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:09,135
AC is on. Do you
want to switch it off?

923
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,267
Yes, switch it off.

924
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:14,069
Let me breathe the
air of this place. - Okay.

925
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,134
Switch off the AC.

926
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,367
Switch off the AC.

927
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,067
You didn't answer me properly.

928
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:31,267
Why did you call me son?

929
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:35,135
From last many years
I didn't call anybody son.

930
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,268
Don't know Rajeev whether
you're aware of it or not. .

931
01:22:42,133 --> 01:22:44,101
.. but I am an
ex-police officer.

932
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:48,101
But when I joined police force..

933
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:52,036
.. I was sent on a mission
to tackle a group.

934
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:56,302
I started working in that
group posing as their man.

935
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,267
We accomplished many big tasks

936
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,101
like in Orissa,
Tamilnadu, Bihar.

937
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:05,102
They had one thumb rule.

938
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:08,135
Every member of that
group should have a mark. .

939
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,036
.. on his left shoulder.
See this.

940
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:15,268
Besides me there were
3 more members in that group.

941
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:21,103
One was Simon,
the other was Anuvidan..

942
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:27,103
And the third one was.. Orian.

943
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,035
Orian? - Yes, Orian.

Why do you feel like this?
