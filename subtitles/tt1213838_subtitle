00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,713
What's the name of this village?

00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,312
Kusavade.

6
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,788
And for hoW long has the
Bull been here in the village?

7
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,583
Well.. it must be fifty years.

8

Hey don't talk nonsense.

9
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:56,262
My grand-dad had got a
heifer from the Pargaon fair.

10
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:58,457
Later it gave two
calf's at the same time.

11
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,466
Calves meaning
small bullocks, right?

12
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:02,263
Yes.

13
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:05,328

Then? Eats everything.
The idiot's running amok.

32
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:52,307
People.. cattle..
nothing matters to him.

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,983
There's no faith left anymore.
Why Worry so much?

00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,313

But Why get angry?
lt Will great fun.

As for catching, l Will
catch anything at all.

98
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:51,179
But there is not need to Waste a
man like me on catching a bull.

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,577
Especially When there's a
hearing tomorroW. Nonsense.

There might be
something like that With them.

Might be? No it is.

102
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,585
Otherwise they Wouldn't
send me to catch a bull ..

103
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,123

politically sensitive case..

104

183
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:41,933
This Bull?
- lt must be.. six months.

184
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,210
ln the beginning our
boys tried to pacify him..

185
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,475
Aba Was saying We Will
do something ourselves

186
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:52,010
But l said, no.

187
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:54,552
Everything must be
done according to laW.

188
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,415
Who's Aba?

189
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:00,358
Jivnya. Go fetch Aba.
- Yes, l Will immediately get him.

190
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:10,360
SWanand Gaddamvar.
What a strong name!

191
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,163
You've got lot of guests.

192
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,168
Are they all from your department?

193
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,976
No.. this is my brother, Sameer.

194
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,309

00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:42,197
You mean it Will be on TV?

198
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,000
Not really..

199
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,333
you mean this documentary thing..
it's something different?

200
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,399
Not it's not that different.
lt could be shoWn on TV.

201
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,475
But one cant be
sure that it Will be.

202
00:15:54,576 --> 00:16:01,004
Ah. l see. lt's a
question of fate then.

203
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:08,751
So noW hoW do you
plan to catch the Bull?

204
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:14,015
Nothing special. With a gun
or a bloW-pipe shoot a dart..

205
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:18,029
..l mean With a gun
or a pipe give an..

206
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,361
.. injection and sedate
him..then lasso him and

207
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:25,501
You mean a gun and all?
Where is it then?

208
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,563
Jagnade, shoW them the gun

lt's in the jeep

210
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,168
What? What do you
mean ''in the jeep''?

211
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,301
These people don't
knoW about these things.

212
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,436
There are children playing about.

213
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,707
After all it's a gun!
Come on, go get it!

214
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,772
Nonsense!

215
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,648
We've arranged for
your stay close-by.

216
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,050
We planned for it here itself,
but Jivnya..

217
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:47,715
.. said your privacy
should not be solitary..

218
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,125
Jivnya? Where are you?

219
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,785
Anna, Aba said he Won't come.

220
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,462
Let that be. Take saheb and
documentary to their place.

221
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,792
Make sure everything is fine.

222
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:02,331
l Will take your leave noW.

223
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:07,069
Hey Sampi, sit properly!
HoW much are you fidgeting?

224
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:16,606
Hey Sampi! Call your father.
Hey Ganya.

225
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:18,748
Have you given everyone
the message about tonight?

226
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:21,081
What do you mean? - Wasn't l
running around in the sun?

227
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,415
Yes! l hope you
are not telling lies.

228
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,690
Aba? When did you come?
Jivnya Was here.

229
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:29,355
He said, Will l go and give to
the Forest people thrice a day?

230
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:30,621
So What did you say?

231
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,154
l said, Sampi is very small.
l can't leave the counter.

232
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:35,630
Why don't they come here instead?

233
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,098
l Will give them tea,
Why three, six times a day!

234
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,564
Good.

235
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,639
What's good? Won't the
business sink this Way?

236
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:46,504
What business? You think the
government asses are arrogant..

237
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:49,577
This old man loves boWing
and bending let that be.

238
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,306
Are the ropes here?

239
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,712
What ropes? Tatya returned
from the fork in the forestjeep.

240
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,640
He didn't get my tea-poWder either.

241
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,116
Our people are such..
Hey Ganya go on..

245
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:10,787
Okay!

246
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:22,197

Think you are important?

248

All the animals in this
village have become so rude!

249
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,739
Why are you so
scared of a motorcycle?

250
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:36,148
What then. l am not the one Who
sits astride a motorcycle really?

251
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:41,153
When did l, after the last fair?

252
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,353
Didn't the bike's
chain snap that time?

253
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:46,555
Good you didn't fall on your faces.

254
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:50,165

Oh.. What does she not do?

263
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,740
Grazes cattle, delivers milk,
keeps the birds aWay..

264
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,474
Jivnya, What's it to you?

Anna has called
everybody to the temple.

300
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,441
Go. Run. Go.

301
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:40,316

Oh my God!

308
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,497
You have put too much
jaggery in the lentils.

309
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,492
too much, is it? Say What you Will.
Abb's jaggery is sWeeter.

310
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,703
But you should take care.
Don't be so obvious.

311
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,378
NoW if l have to go to
the toilet 2-4 times ..

312
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,845
..What can anybody do
about it? Give me more chutney.

313
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:03,390
That's not What l am talking
about.. We should behave..

314
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:06,983
.. as if We are on both
the sides: Anna, and Aba.

315
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:08,786
Give more chutney

316
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:13,393
They say Anna has brought
Forest people to catch the Bull.

317
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,395
Some big officer it seems.

318
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:18,869
Get him to make an
offering at the temple.

319
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,401
Anna too Will be happy.

320
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:21,530
Give more chutney.

321
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,403
Ours is the only Brahman house here.

322
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,402
Nobody Will hurt us, and
We Will not hurt anybody.

323
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:33,417
lf business goes up on both sides,
With the blessings of God, ..

324
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:36,885
..We Will have our oWn
toilet Within the year..

325
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:39,479

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,421
HoW much of it Will you eat?..

327
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:43,755
All the time..
chutney! Chutney! Chutney!

328
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:45,894
the Whole toWn is making fun of you.

329
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:47,952
Why eat it so much if
you can't digest it?

330
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,624
Why? Do l ask YOU
to go instead of me?

331
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:55,494
What's up? Eating or fighting?
Come. Let us go make documentary.

332
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,434
Documentary? What's that?

00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,700
Everyone's gathered at the temple.

334
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,639
They are taking
everyone's documentary there.

335
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:06,035
Whatever you knoW about
the Bull, go there and tell.

336
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,710
can l come along too?

337
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:11,114
Then? Will the
documentary happen Without you?

338
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:13,043
l Will be off. You folloW me.

339
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,983
Let's go.

340
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,458
Hey Chandri! Come

341
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,861
Jivnya, fool, don't pull
her about. She's pregnant.

342
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,990
Ok, Ok. Come mother

00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,459
No. l Won't come. l don't
like such flippant things.

345
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:36,131
What do you knoW about documentary?

346
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,531
Serve the food and We Will go.

347
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:42,940
Once you get into social Work,
you cant step back.

348
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:46,477
Once We catch the Bull, see hoW ..

349
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,950
..they Will they
look at us differently..

350
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:53,213
The MLA himself said to me:

351
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:58,016
''Do something first. Then
We can tell the public.''

352
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:02,485
lf We ready ourselves noW,
then We can get a ticket ..

353
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:07,159
.. for contesting the
bigger elections. What is it?

354
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,503
Nothing.. he Was
saying hoW intently..

355
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:11,901
.. Sampatrao is
listening to everything.

356
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,563
say What you Will.

357
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:14,698
But Sampatrao Will
make a name for himself.

358
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:16,503
After all, he's
learning everything..

359
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:20,512
Of course. He's to
catch the Capital Bull.

360
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:22,914
There's a big plan ready for him.

361
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,710
Aba. Get up. Sampatrao has urinated.

362
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:30,844
Come and take him.

363
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:32,718
What have you done Sampatrao..

364
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,719
Oh my God! What is he up to today?

365
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,523
He is continuously
Wetting the place.

366
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,198
Come for the documentary.

367
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,664
Hey keep quiet! Do
not make a commotion!

368
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,530
Anna has called
everybody to the documentary.

369
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:49,002
lf you knoW anything about
the Bull you have to come tell.

370
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,129
Alright. Buzz off.

371
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:53,003
Come for the documentary..

372
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,543
What's this neW thing
Anna has thought up?

373
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,545
Anna doesn't have the brains.
lt must be the..

374
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,741
.. two people Who have
come With the Forest man.

375
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:04,151
They say it's to be
shoWn on TV, after shooting.

376
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:07,679
They Will get information
about the Bull, and then catch him.

377
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:09,012
Yes.

378
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,559
What the.. is that hoW it is?

379
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:15,151
Are they making
everybody's documentary?

380
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,821
No no.. they Will
take only the good ones.

381
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:20,559
No. its everybody. Don't
speak if you don't knoW.

382
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,561
Jeevan told me a little before.

383
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:25,034
He said to bring
Sampatrao in fine clothes.

384
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:26,570
As if it's his father's property!

385
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:30,899
Nobody's going
anywhere l am telling you.

386
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,307
l kneW it. No fun, no nothing.

387
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:39,580
l've never asked for
even for anything..

388
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,913
Don't make such a racket!

389
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,047
Does the documentary come
to village every other day?

390
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,120
My heart goes out for the child.

391
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:49,249
softly!

392
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:53,588
He's been at me since
morning if not mine..

393
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:58,326
..at least his documentary could
be take But l am so ill-fated!!

394
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,193
Will you shut up noW?

395
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:08,742
she's thinking of the child, Aba.

396
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,276
And does Anna oWn the documentary?

397
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:15,746
What else? l say We
should all go there.

398
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:17,611
Or else that Anna
Will keep beating ..

399
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:19,150
..his oWn drum in the documentary.

400
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,352
So am l to go?

401
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,617
Hey Surshya. Take her along.

402
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:29,950
And take a good documentary of
them. And dress up Sampatrao.

403
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:32,626
Does that mean We
are all going then?

404
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,221
Then? Are We scared of anybody?

405
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,299
No, no. that's not hoW it
should be. We shouldn't go there.

406
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,639
They should come here and
take your documentary. - Yes.

407
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,639
What did you think?
Will Anna get his..

408
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:46,299
.. documentary taken
With everyone present?

409
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,977
Er.. What is to be
said in the documentary?

410
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,377
Oh, the same thing.

411
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:55,650
HoW Anna is sitting on top
of the village, and there's..

412
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,116
.. no opportunity
for younger leadership.

413
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,716
Just say it..
Whatever you can. Let's go.

414
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:03,116
Brother-in-laW, come on!
- Yes, come on! Come on!

415
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,919
You serve dinner for yourself!
l Will serve myself!

416
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,192
Come, brother! The greed for fame..

417
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:10,128
And make Sampatrao pee
before his documentary, right?

418
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,397
Or that's exactly
What they Will catch.

419
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,132
Sampya, do not remove your cap.

420
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,665
And send documentary quickly.

421
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:21,937
Come on! Come We Will
go for the documentary.

422
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,133
Brother!
- Come on, sister-in-laW! Come!

423
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,007
Come on, quickly!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

424
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:27,673
Yes, they are
coming; just two minutes!

425
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:36,149
''Hail lord Ram! Glory
to lord Ram! Ram! Ram!''

426
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:40,019
Hey you! Move aside!
Naughty children!

427
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:46,358
''Hail lord Ram! Glory
to lord Ram! Ram! Ram!''

428
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,953
Come on stand up!
Standup! Yes, like this!

429
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,700
Sit doWn! Sit soWn! Look here,

430
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:54,167
The group of devotees..
please sit doWn.

431
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:59,296
Quiet please. We are not
about to start the documentary.

432
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,902
Documentary means an
informative movie.

433
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,303
This is about the Bull.

434
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:05,770
But Where is the Bull?

435
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,110
- Hey! Hey you fool; keep quiet!

436
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:10,706
Shhh. Look here.
Whoever knoWs about..

437
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,718
.. the Bull should
come up here and speak,..

438
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,720
..so that We can
catch him. Understood?

439
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,918
Everybody's understood?
Good Let's go.

440
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,851
Who Will come first?

441
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:42,207
Give a good coconut. We need it
to offer it to the documentary.

442
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,212
Oh God. Coconut? Wait.

443
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:47,813
Who Will do it? At Whose hands?

444
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,349
Forest, Who else?

445
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:53,414
So then, do l come or not?

446
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,950
You? Where? To the documentary?

447
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:57,816
yes. Where else?

448
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:00,419
Anna, you going there?

449
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:03,964
You Will go there, or should
the documentary come here?

450
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:05,825
You should keep your dignity.

451
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:10,827
Who all have come?

452
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:12,429
Everybody.

453
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,364
Aba?

454
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:16,776
He must be coming.
His family's come.

455
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,781
Sister-in-laW,
hurry up! Wait a While!

456
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,782
Come, the documentary is
held back because of you.

457
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:32,255
Sister-in-laW, come on!
l am coming! l am coming!

458
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:34,790
You are lucky! l found one!

459
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,918
Why could put on your nose-ring.

460
00:30:37,227 --> 00:30:38,922
You think so? l Will.

461
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,323
Saheb, here's the coconut.

462
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:44,926
Break it here! Bang it! Just see!

463
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,194
One minute.

464
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,402
Then you should have
removed it before.

465
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:54,537
lt should break in one shot!

466
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:57,811
Bang it! Very good!

467
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,415
Glory to the lord!

468
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:03,143
- Hail! Hail!

469
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:17,887
What should l say?

470
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:19,022
tell us your name, to begin With.

471
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,427
Changuna Shripati Gavli.

472
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,097
Please uncover your head.

473
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:26,296
HoW Will We see your face otherwise?

474
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:28,837
Oh God. This seems tough.

475
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:30,841
Don't be shy. Go on. Speak.

476
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:34,106
We've to get Water
from great distance.

477
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,448
ln summer Women
have to suffer a lot.

478
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:40,176
Cut. Cut. Cut. The Bull.
Talk about the Bull.

479
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,909
What? Does that mean mine is done.

480
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,587
l am going to talk about the Bull.

481
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:52,319
But there's a live spring
under the silt in the river.

482
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:57,195
And to talk about the Bull..
he used to be so gentle.

483
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,459
Our Sampatrao is
very used to the Bull.

484
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,869
He might be crying a lot,
but the moment..

485
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,994
.. he sees the Bull, he goes quiet.

486
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,864
You might not believe it,
but children used ..

487
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,874
.. to tie tin cans to his tail.

488
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,555
Hey Wild bull!

489
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:43,304
Oh, he Was quite glorious.

490
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:46,441
He use to eat out of banana-leaves,
like a Brahman.

491
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:54,973
lf the Bull stood behind him..

492
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:57,575
.. Kondya's cards
Would begin to speak.

493
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,914
We'd get mere twos and threes.

494
00:33:00,556 --> 00:33:02,921
Crazy Janai Was the
limit-the only thing she didn't do..

495
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,925
.. Was to kiss him.

496
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:16,196
lt Was the season of figs.

497
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:20,597
l Was picking the figs,
me, Gyanba, supri.

498
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:21,997
Suddenly there Was a commotion.

499
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:28,547
And l saW Surshya, Jagnya
and Nana Were running hard.

500
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:30,944
And Jagnya stumbled and fell.

501
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:33,150
And behind him Was this huge mass.

502
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:37,954
We later learnt that Nana
had to be taken to the..

503
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:39,488
.. hospital in toWn,
in a bullock-cart.

504
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,480
The Whole toWn heard of it.

505
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:45,352
''l gave my heart aWay to my
beloved! l am yours oh beloved..

506
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,157
..l am yours oh beloved.''

507
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,023
- Hey Ganya, keep quiet!

508
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:54,433
Mother, give me food quickly.
Aba must be Waiting.

509
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:56,095
Very important task.

510
00:33:56,672 --> 00:33:58,969
Work? Watching videos?

511
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:02,976
Then? ls there anything
else in toWn? What to do?

512
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,978
You Wont let me go to toWn
and drive an auto rickshaW.

513
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:08,173
Who do you think all
this farm-land for?

514
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,972
lf you Wanted me to till the land..

515
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:12,382
.. Why did you send me to school?
- Hey you!

516
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:15,250
Let it me. No point
in talking to him.

517
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:16,987
Even the Bull is preferable.

518
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,991
Did you hear? The
Bull attacked Nana.

519
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,720
What? HoW?

520
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:23,723
Nobody knoWs What happened to him.

521
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,523
Dhrupada too Was saying if
you stare at him he charges.

522
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:34,002
Tell your daughter, she grazes
the buffalos, tell to be careful.

523
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,333
We should marry her off this year..

524
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:43,740
There's a good boy. B.Sc. Agri.,
has a governmentjob

525
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:47,013
lt Will be good if Sangi
is married to a city boy.

526
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:51,018
Why not? The
husband is an officer, ..

527
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,021
..and the brother is
driving a rickshaW..

528
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:58,356
What's it to me? lt's good
for her. That's Why l spoke.

529
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,428
What is the name of that boy?

530
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:04,555
Tanaji Tavre!

531
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:12,095
Shivaji.. Shivaji.

532
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:15,699
Shivaji.

533
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:57,539
and so that Way.

534
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:05,081
Why isn't he here yet?

535
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:10,346
Perhaps he's gone to toWn?
To fix the chain on the bike?

536
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:15,090
And so you say that
the Bull is at the..

537
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:18,096
.. pastures, and in
the afternoon, he climbs

538
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:21,224
..doWn into valley
beyond the stream.

539
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,096
Then in the evening he
comes to the village..

540
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:25,102
.. With the coWs, via
Gavli's farm, and turning..

541
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:27,695
.. around at the village
square and goes to the temple.

542
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,775
Correct, absolutely correct saheb.

543
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,504
There's one thing though-

544
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:35,436
there's no guarantee that
he Will do this everyday.

545
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,175
What do you mean?

546
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:44,514
Look here, We have draWn
this map to track him, right.

547
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:48,313
lf We don't knoW his habits,
hoW Will We catch him?

548
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,317
You have a point. Let me tell you.

549
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:57,127
What you should do is
take my documentary..

550
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,326
..n it Will all come out,
you knoW, What l have to say.

551
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:10,139
Sameer, Why don't you
shoot this gentleman?

552
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:11,468
come!

553
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:14,745
Hey Satya, get up! Get up! Come on!

554
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:18,150
careful, you Will step on them.

555
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,550
Hey, move ahead!

556
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,486
HelloW Saheb. l am Satish Abnave.

557
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:31,423
l live near the pit.

558
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:37,160
First of all We have to thank
the Bull, for he's the reason Why..

559
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:41,295
.. the august documentary
has visited out village.

560
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,166
Even if he is called the Bull,
he actually is a bulldozer.

561
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:53,306
The story l am going to tell you,
.am the only single eyeWitness.

562
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:58,180
You knoW chickens.. chickens you..

563
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,188
..ooped.. this story tells hoW the..

564
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,383
.. used to fling
those chickens about.

565
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:07,251
You say What you Want, Shiva,

566
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:09,193
Aba's motorcycle has a
very different firing.

567
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:10,594
Let it be.

568
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:14,200
No, l mean perhaps some
dirt in the carburetor?

569
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,327
There's dirt in your head.

570
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:20,270
Put the chickens in the coop,
make it sit on for hatching.

571
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:23,206
l have already changed!
Why couldn't tell me earlier?

572
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:24,799
Do What you are told to do.

573
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:29,214
Though annoyed, Shiva
started to catch the ..

574
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,806
..chickens. Suddenly, l saW
the sacred thread approaching

575
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:36,815
Yes! NoW hoW did you catch her?

576
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:49,361
What's this Bhatji? Fifth time?

577
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:51,563
Where Were you for
dinner last night?

578
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:55,763
What's it to you Where l Was?
l go because people invite me.

579
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:00,833
Sit further off.

580
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,570
l Will sit anywhere l
Want and Wherever l Want.

581
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:24,927
this huge dark beast,
don't knoW What got into him.

582
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,258
He thrust his horns into
the chicken basket, and ..

583
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,662
.. turned it over and
all scattered the chickens.

584
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,261
Shiva? Why haven't you put
the chickens in the basked?

585
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,601
l did itjust noW!

586
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,266
ls that you mother
perched up there then?

587
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,335
lt's true!

588
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,606
Shall l beat you! Beat you!
But l had kept them.

589
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,337
- You fool!

590
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:50,884
ls that you beat up a groWn up son?

591
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:52,878
Shouldn't beat him.. Shiva, go, go.

592
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:55,286
You.. pebble-counter! Who
the hell do you think you are?

593
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:56,949
Don't mess With me.

594
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,291
l came to tell you that the
Bull scattered your chickens.

595
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:05,295
lf you urinate in sand, no foam,
no Water. Kill him if you Want.

596
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,899
Hey! Where are you going?
- No Where!

597
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:16,434
Bhatji.. five!

598
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,313
Come on! Come on!

599
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:27,318
Me and Taani, We go
to the lake everyday.

600
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,319
Once the buffalos are in the Water,
We sit and chat at leisure.

601
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,927
''You are my moon, you are my..''

602
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:41,463
Taani, shall l tell
you something funny?

603
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:43,390
Only one.

604
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,334
Why? l Won't tell you noW.

605
00:40:48,438 --> 00:40:51,737
Hey, Mumtaz!
Princess! You got angry?

606
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:53,866
Alright. Tell.

607
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:59,346
Taani, l have these ..

608
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:03,544
..strange dreams.

609
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,751
l cant sleep the Whole night.

610
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,958
Shiva had taken me to that film?

611
00:41:13,594 --> 00:41:18,553
Exactly that happens to me.
Why does this happen to me?

612
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,625
Don't eat meat at night.

613
00:41:23,403 --> 00:41:30,365
What? You talk nonsense.
Taani.. What Will happen to me?

614
00:41:32,678 --> 00:41:36,511
Why Wail noW? l told you earlier,
and you didn't listen.

615
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:43,386
But there should be someone..
to Wait for instead of..

616
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:48,117
.. buffaloes coming out of
Water it's such fun to Wait..

617
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,393
But there has to be a he..
for one's oWn man.

618
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:58,133
Say Whatever.. you Will,
Taani.. in the film.

619
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,004
Taani. Will you look
after the buffaloes?

620
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,403
l'll be back.

621
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,942
l am coming! HoW
long you took to come?

622
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,409
Wait!

623
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:20,418
Okay, let's go.

624
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:28,087
Why do We have to go so far?

625
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:29,421
Then We Will knoW.. yes!

626
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:31,155
Jivnya? What happened?

627
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,829
Taani. Come quickly.

628
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,429
Hey, go from here!
- Wait!

629
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:37,558
Yes, l am coming!

630
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:39,033
Hey, come on! Come on! Come!

631
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:41,161
But tell me What happened?
- Come quickly!

632
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:43,440
This Way!
- At least tell me.

633
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:45,499
Oh!
- Fell doWn!

634
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:01,522
Can't you Watch Where you are going?

635
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,649
Like this!

636
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:07,528
You Will fall!
- No, l Will not fall. Then What?

637
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:10,863
Jivnya? Will take
the buffaloes home?

638
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,722
What do you think l am doing?

639
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:14,858
- Go aWay!

640
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:33,479
Only l knoW hoW l managed.
There Was a sound..

641
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:36,611
.. like the earthquake,
When l stuck my neck out.

642
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:39,154
The Bull Was right in front of me!

643
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:42,550
The animal looked as
if it Was Wild. Yes!

644
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,025
l held the dhoti tight,
didn't move at all..

645
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:48,164
As l Watched, my
body sprouted marigolds!

646
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:54,765
But l stared Without
blinking once. No credit to.

647
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:57,971
lt's the blessings of god
that l could do such a deed.

648
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,041
Whatever We hear is
very strange indeed, eh?

649
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:05,506
That he has to go a fifth time,
and because of my comment..

650
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:09,515
..he goes into the fields instead
of the lousy pit, and sits there..

651
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:13,519
..he sees the Bull. lt
all seems to be fate.

652
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:16,522
No, no. lt Won't do to sit idly.
Let go right aWay,.

653
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:19,717
.. and muzzle him, and
throW him into the open fields.

654
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,925
Let the vultures eat his flesh.

655
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:24,928
Hey Aba, Why are you
behaving as if you are mad?

656
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:31,997
Do not get so angry.

657
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:34,539
He's not on a leash, or a rope.

658
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:37,536
Even human beings drink and sWay,..

659
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:40,941
.. he's just an animal.
ShoW some patience.

660
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,809
Ajja, if it Was merely my
marigolds, l Wouldn't say a thing.

661
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,080
l Would streW all into the village.

662
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:52,078
But this is bizarre!

663
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,079
He doesn't care about people,
or animals, or crops.

664
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:56,215
He merely Wants Wander freely!

665
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:58,555
That's true, Ajja.

666
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:00,151
There are children
playing about on the streets!

667
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:03,162
What if they get trampled?

668
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:04,822
No no no, We must take
care of him right noW.

669
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:11,037
Aba! l found the video of ''Naina''!

670
00:45:12,806 --> 00:45:17,038
Aba, you are great! You
alWays make things come true.

671
00:45:17,144 --> 00:45:18,304
Shall l come too?

672
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:21,171
yes, come, come.

673
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,907
Come on fast, otherwise We
Will not be able to see the video.

674
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:33,717
The video saved the Bull! God!
l Will be off, child.

675
00:45:57,846 --> 00:46:03,148
You knoW hoW the
heroine's eyes shine in ''Naina''?

676
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,614
That's hoW the Bull's eyes shine.

677
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,882
Oh my God! They are so ferocious!

678
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:16,753
l can't keep aWake
till late have to go.

679
00:46:19,866 --> 00:46:21,299
My family is here.

680
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:22,692
She Will tell you.

681
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:32,172
You're from the government,
isn't it? Or are you private?

682
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:33,776
Government of Maharashtra.

683
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,709
Then you must knoW the scheme?

684
00:46:35,814 --> 00:46:36,838
- Which one?

685
00:46:36,948 --> 00:46:38,643
That there's a government scheme..

686
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,115
..to build toilets in
the rural areas? - Yes.

687
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:42,845
They say there Will a
toilet in each household.

688
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:44,921
No, but that doesn't
come under our department..

689
00:46:45,022 --> 00:46:48,651
But surely you knoW after
all you are from government ..

690
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:51,659
.. you must've heard
something if you put in Word,

691
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:54,662
..then it Will be quicker
for us.. our money is ready too

692
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:58,131
.. ..if you say, l can
pay it up tomorroW itself..

693
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,668
We Will talk about
that later, but first..

694
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:02,202
.. tell What you
knoW about the Bull.

695
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:04,931
They are shooting aren't they?

696
00:47:05,974 --> 00:47:06,998
Of course. Come.

697
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:31,287
Our family suffers
the most from the Bull.

698
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,690
My husband has a bad stomach..
so he has to go at odd ..

699
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:41,829
..times in the night
that's hoW it is.. Why hide it?

700
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,368
But because of the Bull, he's
too scared to go to the toilet.

701
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:48,706
He looks after the
temple by himself.

702
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,712
He Wakes up early, and does the..

703
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:53,908
.. prayers and offering
He can't keep late hours..

704
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:56,712
the Bull, the Bull. Tell
us something about the Bull.

705
00:47:57,086 --> 00:48:01,716
That's What l am telling.. he
suffers a lot because of the ..

706
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:05,715
But noW you've come to catch him..

707
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,728
.. but it's a
terribly difficult task..

708
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,731
..that's Why he's said, you
should make offerings to god..

709
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:14,733
..all that you need is 251 rupees..

710
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:17,929
..and all the
accessories are covered by that..

711
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:20,797
Next.

712
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:23,735
Think on it. You can come
straight to the temple tomorroW.

713
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,272
Who is the next one? Next! Next!

714
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,938
l Will tell him.
- Yes! Yes!

715
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:31,475
This temple is very holy!
- Yes! Yes! lt is all right! Fine!

716
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,808
God fulfills Whatever your Wish is.
- Yes! Yes! Fine!

717
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,344
l am going!

718
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:53,835
Anna, you sent for me?

719
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:56,237
When is your documentary coming?

720
00:48:56,806 --> 00:48:59,433
l've been sitting all
dressed up like a festival bull.

721
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,375
Anna, is documentary a simple thing?

722
00:49:03,478 --> 00:49:07,972
All those cameras it
Won't do to be so impatient.

723
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,778
Tell them to do things quickly.
The Women are tired.

724
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,788
What l say is,
instead of sitting here..

725
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:18,324
.. it's better to be With people.
We should go there.

726
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:19,849
Let us go then

727
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,929
You, Anna? You shouldn't go there.

728
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:26,794
You must keep your dignity
as head of village! Come.

729
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:27,923
Sister-in-laW, you come!

730
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,330
l am going!
- Yes!

731
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:33,527
This is Wonderful.

732
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,081
lt is a headache!

733
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,815
Did you see, Ganya?

734
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:58,827
Tell me; What do you
knoW about that bull?

735
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:03,962
l shouldn't really speak,
but l can't refrain.

736
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:07,835
The people of this village
does not value my husband ..

737
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:12,564
He has suffered so much l tell you..

738
00:50:19,613 --> 00:50:20,841
Oh my God!

739
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:27,842
You Wild bull!

740
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,451
This Bull has really
shoWed everyone there place!

741
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,197
Go ahead. Be more sinful.

742
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,535
lf you hunt the animal
like mad, Won't it go berserk?

743
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,937
You breW hooch, go
about on your bikes,..

744
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,938
.. Watch videos.. this
is What Will happen.

745
00:52:05,107 --> 00:52:06,938
What happens if you Watch videos?

746
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:10,533
The things you say! should We
take the Bull to Watch videos?

747
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:14,612
Don't be banal. You
are one of them too.

748
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,205
Why? What have l done?

749
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:18,417
Fooling With girls in the village.

750
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,543
Which girl did l fool With?

751
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,417
Did l carrying Gavli's
daughter piggy-back?

752
00:52:24,991 --> 00:52:27,960
Ahh.. so you heard about it.
- What else?

753
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,961
Look here! There Was no Woman
around, and the idiot could..

754
00:52:31,063 --> 00:52:33,964
..not Walk, so l took
her home, out of kindness..

755
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:36,364
..and that too With
her parents present..

756
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:37,560
ls that so?
- Yes!

757
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:39,026
Fools around With girls she says!

758
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:43,963
And mother, l hear you still
put out food for the Bull?

759
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:45,974
Then? What of it?

760
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:49,176
Oh mother mine, the Whole
village looks doWn on me!

761
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,372
The village Wants to
kill him, and you feed him!

762
00:52:51,481 --> 00:52:52,505
Oh is that so?

763
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:53,981
Then l too should become
stupid like the village.

764
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,108
But..
- Keep quiet!

765
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:58,653
Do not try to teach me.
You are trying to tell me.

766
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,989
God has given
intelligence to everyone. - Then?

767
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:05,116
Feeding a dumb
animal brings no harm.

768
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:09,130
Go and give Water to Chandri.

769
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,124
This is my mother's point.

770
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:17,332
NoW you tell me, is she right,
or the village?

771
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:21,405
l can't decide. Hey Shiva.

772
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:23,998
Come here! You are
alWays late for everything..

773
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,738
..Documentary, he
is very close to me.

774
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:29,014
Make one of his too noW.

775
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:31,073
What am l to say?

776
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:33,014
Tell us Whatever you
knoW about the Bull.

777
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:37,021
Don't mention him at all.
He's ruined things for me.

778
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,217
l tell you, l am not
going to be scared of anyone.

779
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:46,025
l am in love With sangi,
and she is mine, ..

780
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,826
..and Will be forever mine,
and only mine!

781
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:55,026
Father! Father! The Bull
has impaled our bullock.

782
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:58,574
He's bleeding badly.

783
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:02,038
l Won't spare him.
l Will poison him.

784
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:07,045
Sakhubai put out some food, and ..

785
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:08,514
..the procession of bulls began.

786
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,124
This Was the first time
that Sangi's father's bulls..

787
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:31,066
..Were not
participating in the procession.

788
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:33,672
Sangi's father Was very serious.

789
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:37,070
And he mixed poison in plain rice
and kept a plate for that Wild bull.

790
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,135
Die, you pimp.

791
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:25,110
And in the confusion,..

792
00:55:25,218 --> 00:55:27,118
.. Pavshya got free.. then
direct in the evening, ..

793
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,383
..he Was found dead.. that Was that!

794
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:32,180
My father took out the axe.

795
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:36,785
Anna, Marutya Won't survive.
You look after my children noW.

796
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:40,256
have gone mad? Sit doWn quietly.

797
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:42,860
Listen here-make some tea.

798
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,532
No, no l don't Want any tea at all.

799
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:46,261
Shall l make only one cup then?

800
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:51,539
TWo cups. NoW, What happened.
Tell me.

801
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:54,674
Marutya has poisoned my
bullock in broad daylight.

802
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:57,874
HoW do you knoW it Was him?
Do you have any proof?

803
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,876
You sit finding
proofs and Witnesses.

804
00:56:01,183 --> 00:56:02,207
lt Was my bullock that died.

805
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,152
Hey Mohnya. Don't
talk too much. Listen.

806
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:11,748
We Will have tea, then go and
sort out things. Don't be stupid.

807
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:13,349
l can't have any tea or anything.

808
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:16,157
Hey, Mohnya. Mohnya.
- Shall make tea or not?

809
00:56:16,263 --> 00:56:17,628
Martya!
- Uncle! - Hey, Martya!

810
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:18,755
Uncle, no!
- Hey Martya! Where is Martya?

811
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:21,163
l did not mean to
poison your bullock.

812
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:22,292
lt Was for the Bull.

813
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:24,768
Why did you let your
bullock run around loose?

814
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:26,167
You liar!

815
00:56:26,272 --> 00:56:27,364
l am not talking nonsense!
- Oh my God!

816
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:30,169
Shiva! Shiva! See
What they are doing!!

817
00:56:30,276 --> 00:56:32,437
Forget it! He didn't mean it

818
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:34,376
Yes, tell your father that!
- You keep quiet! - Oh my God!

819
00:56:34,813 --> 00:56:37,782
Maunya!
- Father! Father! - Aba, just see!

820
00:56:37,882 --> 00:56:39,782
Listen to me! Listen!

821
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:42,375
Aba has come! Aba has come!
- Hey! Keep quiet! Quiet!

822
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:43,510
Aba!
- Move aside!

823
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,712
Early morning he
has come With an axe.

824
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:46,187
Hey! My father has not done
anything; do not beat him.

825
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,314
Move that side! Move aWay!

826
00:56:49,226 --> 00:56:50,386
Why are you beating my Shiva?

827
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,518
You have come here
to beat him, is it?

828
00:56:52,229 --> 00:56:54,719
Great! Great! A good
fight is going on!

829
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:56,196
Hey Aba! Are you supposed to
solve the dispute or add fuel..

830
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:58,859
..to the fire?
- Don't you understand this much?

831
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:00,395
But there should be justice.

832
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:02,936
Am l dead yet? Why are
you taking the load?

833
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:05,866
l knoW you are alive. l
came because Ganya called me.

834
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,669
This is all because of you.

835
00:57:07,776 --> 00:57:10,802
lf you had looked
after the bullocks.

836
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,471
You bought that motorcycle.
- Uncle! Don't hit him.

837
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,543
But have l even
touched your old man?

838
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,617
Not him. Don't hit Shiva.

839
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,811
Sangi. Get inside. lf you even name
the brat again l'll break your leg.

840
00:57:22,922 --> 00:57:24,219
Why he is not on the street..

841
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:25,951
Sangi is bit of an idiot.

842
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:29,819
ln that excitement Sangi
exposed the secret of our love.

843
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:34,021
Then What! Both our fathers
started screaming With fury.

844
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,764
Then We both
thought With a calm mind.

845
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:51,576
Why is the mill of our
life jammed like this, Shiva?

846
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:55,251
Shall We elope,
then, to Mumbai or Pune?

847
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,911
No. Look for some solution here.

848
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:03,852
Solution here.. Ah, there is.

849
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,520
There is one man Who
Will solve all this.

850
00:58:07,295 --> 00:58:08,523
Who?
- Our Ajja!!

851
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,930
Both of them Will listen to him.

852
00:58:13,902 --> 00:58:19,533
let's go find him
right noW. Come on Shiva.

853
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,014
We Will not go home at all.

854
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:38,751
Grandfather!
- Grandfather!

855
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,418
Hey, grandfather!
- Grandfather!

856
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:01,042
The Bull has finished everything

857
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,307
The entire village came
together and performed..

858
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:06,506
..grandfather's last rites.

859
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,580
l felt as if this Was
the pyre of my love story.

860
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:16,317
The Bull has ruined our crops,

861
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,723
killed our bullocks,
smashed our houses.

862
00:59:19,826 --> 00:59:23,318
We didn't say a thing.
But this is the limit.

863
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,657
lt's difficult to live in Kusavade.

864
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:26,789
What else!

865
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,335
NoW l am not Willing to sit quiet.

866
00:59:31,504 --> 00:59:36,600
You join me or not, l
am going to catch him.

867
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,341
What has happened is, all our..

868
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:43,005
. people have become hot-heads.

869
00:59:44,115 --> 00:59:47,345
But the time is such
that instead of getting..

870
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,614
.. emotional, We should
do things With calm minds.

871
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,353
The moment l got to
knoW that Ajja Was dead..

872
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:59,360
..l called up the
MLA saheb. l told him..

873
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:03,364
..send some forces. Police,
Forest, Fire Brigade, some forces..

874
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,366
..and save the
village from this animal.''

875
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:13,428
ln the ancient times, there
is a story told of Vaaman.

876
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:17,373
He asked for land enough
for him for three steps ..

877
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:22,107
..and conquered Earth,
Heavens and Netherworld..

878
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:24,876
Stop telling stories.
What is the relevance?

879
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,388
What l mean to say is We should..

880
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:31,513
.. all think
together and find a trick.

881
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:37,384
What l say is We should make ..

882
01:00:37,496 --> 01:00:41,829
..sWeets and
savouries that he likes.

883
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:44,834
No use! He has
support from some of us!

884
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:47,131
Sakhubai puts out
food for him everyday.

885
01:00:47,505 --> 01:00:50,530
Hey smartass! He is under some
control because of that good.

886
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,835
lf he goes starving,. he
Will burst into your house!

887
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:54,671
Shall l say one final thing?

888
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:55,802
Tell. What is this?

889
01:00:56,513 --> 01:01:00,141
Even snot-nosed kids are
giving speeches! Speak!

890
01:01:02,051 --> 01:01:06,147
One final thing. Shift the pit.

891
01:01:10,058 --> 01:01:11,855
Anna, that's just not right.

892
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:14,756
Connect a bulb near
the village square.

893
01:01:14,862 --> 01:01:17,489
Anna, start the
Work-out school again.

894
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:20,057
lnstead, get the silt
out from the middle Well.

895
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:30,566
He is very smart!..

896
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:09,537
Hello? Yes Dalvi.

897
01:02:10,846 --> 01:02:15,214
Tell me. Yes?

898
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,754

''Sanskrit chants''

907
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:41,137
''Sanskrit chants'' Move aside..

908
01:04:44,249 --> 01:04:46,239
''Sanskrit chants''

01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,821
See, didn't l tell you that.

What is this Forest?
You are playing marbles?

921
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:59,412
No, l have come to
look at the terrain.

01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:01,340
Let's go
- Let's go.

923
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:03,149
lf l am late Anna
Will get angry on me.

924
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,689
And please understand that though..

925
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,689
..this is government operation,..

926
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,760
..the Bull cannot be
caught Without your cooperation.

927
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:16,695
On those that Jeevan has collected..

928
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:19,960
..Will catch the Bull,
and nobody else.

929
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:22,700
And there should no confusion..

930
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:25,363
..or mistakes in this.

931
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,705
lf the animal goes berserk..

932
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:28,865
..that Will be a
threat to people's lives.

933
01:06:28,975 --> 01:06:31,443
And my foremost concern is
the safety of the people.

934
01:06:32,345 --> 01:06:34,074
Yes, yes.

935
01:06:41,753 --> 01:06:42,913
What has happened to the trackers..

936
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:44,454
..We sent to track the Bull?

937
01:06:45,356 --> 01:06:46,380
What happened?

938
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,720
We don't knoW. Not a clue.

939
01:06:48,826 --> 01:06:50,453
We looked for him a lot.

940
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,723
He disappear for days on end..

941
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:54,228
..and then bursts
out any place he likes.

942
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,230
But We can't stop the search.

943
01:06:57,367 --> 01:07:00,803
Jeevan, l need someone to
help me With the equipment.

944
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:02,795

Oh l am there. l just have to
hold it, right? Not fire it?

947
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:11,936
Just to hold it.

948
01:07:12,046 --> 01:07:13,946
Villagers don't knoW
about these things.

949
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:15,481
Attrall it's a ghun.

950
01:07:16,217 --> 01:07:19,152
Aba! Going someWhere in a hurry?

01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,485

This is Gaddamvar saheb,.. -
..he forks in the forest department.

957
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:41,304
The MLA has sent him
for us. Understood?

958
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:43,271
And this is Aba. Aba Renushe.

959
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:45,500
The young leadership of our village.

960
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,034
He is very brave.

961
01:07:47,812 --> 01:07:50,075
He said, ''l Will catch
the Bull all by myself!''

962
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,783
But l said, ''What if you
get your head broken..

963
01:07:54,885 --> 01:08:00,481
..of something?'' Forest!
Take him in your team!

964
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,389
Absolutely. l Will
certainly need his help.

965
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:06,787
lf the head of village says this,..

966
01:08:06,895 --> 01:08:08,419

So village head, shall l go? Okay!

970

He looks to be a very
energetic man! - Yes!

971
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:35,148
Jivnya! Forest! The Bull..
- Where?

01:08:35,253 --> 01:08:36,811
DoWn there, at the khalli pandi.

Come! - Come on! - Hey! Hey! All of

974
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:43,017
Where is this khalli pandi?

From this side!
From this side! Stop!

01:09:04,213 --> 01:09:05,908
Why stop? We aren't there yet.

979
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:09,382
Shut up. Don't
make noise. FolloW me.

980
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:23,920
Jeevan! Get me the equipment!

981
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:25,596
What? The bloW pipe or the gun?

982
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:28,326
This is called as bloW-pipe!

983
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:30,595
We shouldn't use the
gun at such short range.

984
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:32,603
Where are the others? Look here.

985
01:09:33,906 --> 01:09:35,430
Some go this Way, some that Way.

986
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:37,135
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

987
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,610
Spread out! Spread!

988
01:09:48,986 --> 01:09:51,147
Jeevan? Where are you
going like an idiot?

989
01:09:51,522 --> 01:09:52,955
l don't Want any casualties.

990
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:55,048
The animal is right there!
Don't try to be a hero!

991
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,557
Come here! Come on!
- What?

992
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,956
OH ho, that's not
an animal.. Meaning?

993
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,257
l mean that's not the Bull.

994
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,264
That's Sopan's bullock. Tutarya.

995
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,634
You mean to say the
Bull is larger than this?

996
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,368
Huh! This is a small thing.

997
01:10:10,138 --> 01:10:11,366
But Where the hell is Sopanya?

998
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:13,574
Sopanya!

999
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:15,574
Who is it?

1000
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,169
Tutarya is here!

1001
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:20,277
l have left him to graze.

1002
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,642
Did you see the Wild bull?

1003
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:30,188
lf you see, let us knoW!

1004
01:10:33,592 --> 01:10:35,526
Jeevan, Who spotted the Bull?

1005
01:10:35,627 --> 01:10:36,651
Where did he see him?

1006
01:10:37,496 --> 01:10:38,520
Where is Poptya?

1007
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,995
He hasn't come along.

1008
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:41,657
He hasn't come along.

1009
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:44,529
there is network coverage here!

1010
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,994
really? Good. Very good.

1011
01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:59,671
ls it right? Jamdade
has taken spiritual voWs?

1012
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:02,950
What else? He Was
coming back drunk,..

1013
01:11:03,052 --> 01:11:05,646
..and the Bull starting chasing him.

1014
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:07,956
He Was so terrified, he
Went to Sakrikar Maharaj..

1015
01:11:08,057 --> 01:11:10,456
..and put those beads on.

1016
01:11:12,193 --> 01:11:14,252
My husband's
card-playing has decreased..

1017
01:11:15,663 --> 01:11:17,563
Doesn't he call you queen of hearts?

1018
01:11:22,202 --> 01:11:24,170
But the Bull must be caught.

1019
01:11:25,339 --> 01:11:26,965
Why are you after his life?

1020
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:33,279
HoW long shall We life in fear?
l am feel very scared.

1021
01:11:35,348 --> 01:11:37,975
the truth is the villager's
have terrified the Bull,..

1022
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:40,711
..and then they say
''We are frightened''.

1023
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:42,718
The river is floWing upstream!

1024
01:11:43,088 --> 01:11:45,715
He is making the village run around.

1025
01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:47,381
ls there anybody
With enough courage..

1026
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:49,049
..to face him?

1027
01:11:49,627 --> 01:11:50,992
He moves around like a king,..

1028
01:11:51,095 --> 01:11:53,427
..With a retinue of ten coWs,
as if they Were his queens..

1029
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:00,059
The forest Officer
seems like a handsome man.

1030
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:01,428
He Will capture the Bull.

1031
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:05,335
Did you see Jivnya, auntie?

1032
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:07,337
He is Walking around With guns.

1033
01:12:07,543 --> 01:12:10,740
Really? But can he fire the gun?

1034
01:12:11,113 --> 01:12:13,342
God knoWs What he can do or cant.

1035
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:16,640
He has to come home for me to knoW.

1036
01:12:19,387 --> 01:12:20,752
Jeevan can do anything.

1037
01:12:24,057 --> 01:12:27,254
Hey Chandri! Mother! - What is it?
Have you put out food for the Bull?

1038
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,351
Why? lt is too early.

1039
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:31,088
No, put it noW.

1040
01:12:31,197 --> 01:12:32,221
Why?

1041
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:33,355
You just put it out noW.

1042
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:36,366
Why do you Women Want to knoW?
Forest has said.

1043
01:12:36,468 --> 01:12:37,560

1044
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:38,762
Why are you getting so angry?

1045
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:41,762
Jivnya! What is that other thing?

1046
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,165
bloWer.

1047
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:02,050
Has she come? Ok. NoW,..

1048
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:07,117
..Mrs. Sakhubai Will
put the offering here. Ok

1049
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:10,130
The animal Will come to ear it.

1050
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:12,528
We Will sit in ambush.

1051
01:13:14,169 --> 01:13:16,659
Once he starts eating,..

1052
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,067
..l Will shoot a dart-

1053
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,340
..meaning injection-to make him..

1054
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:23,239
unconscious.. once it hits him,..

1055
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:25,811
..he Will fall doWn after a While..

1056
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:31,076
..or maybe he Won't.. if
he does not fall doWn,..

1057
01:13:31,184 --> 01:13:35,244
..then We Will folloW
him-but carefully, right?

1058
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:38,349
Once he falls doWn,..

1059
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:39,651
..We'll throW
ropes and tie him doWn.

1060
01:13:39,758 --> 01:13:43,750
One on his horns, and four
on his legs. Understood?

1061
01:13:44,195 --> 01:13:45,219
Have all of you understood?

1062
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,092
NoW every one Will
take their positions-

1063
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,100
and noW Mrs. Sakhubai Will
silently put the offering..

1064
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:53,362
..and go aWay as
if nothing happened.

1065
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:56,471
Right? Ok. Move, Positions!

1066
01:13:57,741 --> 01:13:59,174

Go! l have left you!

01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,669
One should learn to
play games from you!

1075
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,172
You sent Poptya for a false alarm,..

1076

..and they Went off on a Wild chase!

1077

From here to there.

What's this Jeevan? What's going on?

What right have you got?

1104
01:17:43,808 --> 01:17:46,971
No! No! - Keep quiet!
You better let him be free.

1105
01:17:48,012 --> 01:17:49,309
lf you catch him..

1106
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,381
..you Will have to face my anger.

1107
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:54,711

Didn't l tell you not go too far?

1115
01:18:33,052 --> 01:18:34,349
That's Mad Janai.

1116
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:36,477
She Wasn't mad from the start..

1117
01:18:36,788 --> 01:18:38,881
She Was Jadhav's only child

1118
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:41,416
After he father's death
she looked after everything.

1119
01:18:42,394 --> 01:18:44,623
Said she Would not
marry or anything.

1120
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:47,362
But then, everybody
had eyes for her land..

1121
01:18:47,465 --> 01:18:49,695
..they branded her
immoral and had their Way.

1122
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,364
She didn't any love from humans.

1123
01:18:53,737 --> 01:18:55,500
So she loves various animals deeply.

1124
01:18:55,872 --> 01:18:58,363
Some say she even
understands What they say.

1125
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,377
Who knoWs true or false?

1126
01:19:09,485 --> 01:19:11,782

Are you not going?

there he speaks! There he lies!

1180
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:58,179
My father had to find this..

..liar from the Whole World!

1182
01:22:59,756 --> 01:23:01,053

..and sent us aWay.

1184
01:23:02,825 --> 01:23:04,588
Forget about me..

1185
01:23:04,694 --> 01:23:06,594
..but at least Sampi's

HoW talented my baby is!

1187
01:23:09,965 --> 01:23:11,728
But not the slightest appreciation.

1188
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,730
Daddy is never home.

1189
01:23:13,835 --> 01:23:15,598

1194
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,737

1195
01:23:26,247 --> 01:23:27,873
l am the fool here, to have dreams!

1196
01:23:29,382 --> 01:23:32,613
Our Sampi has become a heroine

1197
01:23:32,986 --> 01:23:34,749
Her film's running in the theatre!

1198
01:23:35,654 --> 01:23:36,882
And everyone is asking,

1199
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:38,951
''Where is Sampi's mother?

1200
01:23:39,057 --> 01:23:43,960
Where is she?'' My eyes
fill up With tears..

1201
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,155
But this stone hearted man
Will have no compassion.

1202
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:49,690
Enough!

1203
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:52,767
l Will tell one thing.

1204
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:55,699
lf Sampi's documentary
is not made before daWn,

1205
01:23:55,806 --> 01:23:57,774
l Will not touch a drop
of Water in this house.

1206
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,714
Three! One, two, three.

1207
01:24:15,423 --> 01:24:18,790
Mother? What Will Chandri deliver?
CoW, or bullock?

1208
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,787
Why does that matter?

1209
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:22,923
We'll be the oWners
of a neW rope. Hmm.

1210
01:24:24,031 --> 01:24:26,932
Your turn. Four.

1211
01:24:28,368 --> 01:24:30,927

l Would never find you.

1213
01:24:34,173 --> 01:24:35,868
Playing a game, eh?

1214
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:37,806
Keeping company to Chandri.

1215
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:38,934
She's under strain, you knoW.

1216
01:24:39,045 --> 01:24:40,807
So am l auntie! You?

1217
01:24:43,715 --> 01:24:45,683
This documentary has
created such a problem.

1218
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:47,348
Our Fire Tanker had gone
to her mother's place.

1219
01:24:47,919 --> 01:24:50,751
And having found out that
everyone's has been done and not.

1220

1222
01:24:58,995 --> 01:25:00,155

the Bull? NO. it must
be made on her dance.

1225
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:10,097
lsn't that a problem?
That documentary is strict.

1226
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:14,902
He takes it only if
it is about the Bull.

1227
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,302
So then? What noW?

1228
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,781
Tell him not to pay
for the morning snack.

1229
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,713
Are you an idiot? They'll
throW their shoes at me! ..

1230
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,375
What should We do then?

1231
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:27,846
Why do you think so much on it?

1232
01:25:28,822 --> 01:25:30,255
The little ones have these Wishes.

1233
01:25:30,357 --> 01:25:33,724
Go tell her mother to tell them that

01:25:34,226 --> 01:25:36,717
