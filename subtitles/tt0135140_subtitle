1
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:17,237
Say what? You want to
fight Dhabla in court?

2
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,848
You'll fight me?
- No! No, Dhabla!

3
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,544
Mercy! Forgive me!
I will never fight cases

4
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,380
I have small kids.
Forgive me...!

5
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:30,726
No!

6
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,467
The gun.

7
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,018
You will teach Dhabla
the reins of business?

8
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:01,550
I keep rates fixed. Collect
the merchandise at the usual price

9
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:04,484
If not, pack up and vanish.
Go!

10
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,890
Just kidding. Why get worked up?
I want to work with you only.

11
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:13,498
There you are. Just buy the stuff
and take this

12
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:18,601
Chugani used to say" "Never
retract,

13
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,240
never mind if the path
is crooked." Get it?

14
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,479
One must make sure
the path is straight.

15
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:28,503
Even God has given man the sense
of thinking critically.

16
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:34,583
Welcome, Shirke. I was about to send
your fare

17
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:37,051
Good you came. Sit.

18
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:44,590
I hear the lawyer's wife is
creating a ruckus.

19
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,934
Don't worry about that.
Let me deal with it.

20
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:51,870
Inspector, you are a smart one.

21
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,875
What does the government pay you?

22
00:04:55,233 --> 00:05:00,080
If your likes were to work for us,
the practice of bribes would end.

23
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,884
Law and Crime share
a longstanding relationship.

24
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:05,948
Both cannot survive
without each other.

25
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,753
Yes, I sent his corpse to the morgue.

26
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:13,619
And termed it an accident
and closed the case

27
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,093
Like Dinesh Gupta's. Whom Kali had
pushed from the roof.

28
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:26,305
But worse things happen when a
common man

29
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,773
Who will dare raise his voice
against Dhabla,

30
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,996
This evening I am going with
my friends to a birthday party.

31
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:45,194
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
- Make sure you get home safe.

32
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,539
My love, my sweetheart...

33
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,079
who was that dude?
- Why must you care?

34
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:01,482
We don't like an outsider
wooing a girl from our college.

35
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:07,220
You mean, only we have
the right to them?

36
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,894
Give me a try, love.
I'm smart too.

37
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:17,700
You mustn't talk rash.
She is the daughter of the principal

38
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,999
You must not act fresh with her.
- Kali!

39
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,573
What impudence is this?
- Nothing sir.

40
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,384
I was just explaining to her
the college rules

41
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,381
I heard it. Meet me in the office.
Right away!

42
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:43,189
Looks like the Principal wants
to give him a thrashing

43
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:48,402
Last warning. Stop your activities
if you want to stay in this college.

44
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,900
Else, I will be compelled
to take drastic action.

45
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:54,403
What will you do?

46
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,605
Tell me, what will you do?
Will you expel me?

47
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,610
Will you rusticate Kali,
the son Dhabla?

48
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,045
I very well know you
are the son of Dhabla...

49
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,686
who has established an empire
of crime in this town

50
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,822
But don't you forget,
this is a college. And...

51
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:19,431
I can't let you have your own way.
- Hey, don't talk so loud.

52
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,928
You cannot expel me.

53
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,641
Have you forgotten?
Dinesh Gupta's demise?

54
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:39,047
Have you forgotten the statement you
gave at his funeral?

55
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:47,188
My father's name sends a chill
down your spine.

56
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,454
Have some water.

57
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,658
Drink it up.

58
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,349
Daughter-in-law

59
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,282
Yes?
- Can someone tell me where Pooja is?

60
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,092
It's late. Why isn't she back as yet?
- She is with her friends at a birthday party.

61
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,691
I've sent Vijay to fetch her.
They should be back any moment.

62
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,717
Insolence!

63
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:56,051
Not insolence, it's
my style. Style!

64
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:58,964
Just get out of my way!

65
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,991
I won't.
What will you do?

66
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:06,630
You're crossing all limits.
Get out of my way,

67
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,866
Else what?

68
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,741
Threatening me?
And you have fun with that dude?

69
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,951
Let go!

70
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,314
Brother!

71
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:56,920
Get lost!

72
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,518
Dare not step forward!
Get lost!

73
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,595
Move it!

74
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:39,066
No! No!

75
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,876
Don't hit me! Don't!

76
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,434
What was the need to
party at night?

77
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,704
The friends you move around with,
them

78
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,043
and their lifestyle,
doesn't suit us.

79
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,246
You will surely land us in trouble
if you don't change.

80
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,908
Father, they forced me.

81
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:26,219
Forced? Don't you have brains to
think of your own well-being?

82
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,923
Girls from decent families
don't stay away late

83
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:35,591
Bhabhi! (Sister-in-law)
- Calm down.

84
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,531
Stop it now. She hasn't done
anything rash, has she?

85
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:44,138
Enjoying a bit on an occasion
is not a crime, is it?

86
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,270
Don't you defend her.

87
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,605
At this age one should
tread carefully.

88
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,743
Enough, father.
Why are you scolding her?

89
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,939
You haven't said a word
about that chap...

90
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,576
Why do we bow instead of
standing up to bullies

91
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:01,642
We curb our womenfolk
to get back home early.

92
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:05,812
But to restrain people like Kali,
are we doing anything at all?

93
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,655
Like terrified rats, we scamper
to the back of the house.

94
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:15,501
Brother, this is no decency.
This is cowardice.

95
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,012
Forgive me, brother.
Because of me you got an earful.

96
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,817
I won't commit this mistake again.
- Why bother?

97
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,520
His anger is limited to us.
He's like a meek rat in front of father.

98
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,999
By the way, where is she?
Haven't seen her in a while.

99
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,836
Babulal, get me some tea.
I have a headache.

100
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,346
The long queues for the bus!
Add to it the traffic!

101
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,344
ls the boss all heated up?
- Yes. Go on. Quick.

102
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:16,828
Madam, have you cooked up
a story to tell him?

103
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:21,232
Be on time, at least someday.
- It's because of you I wake up late.

104
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,866

...?
- Yes. You trouble me in my dreams.

105
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:29,898
Those dreams drive my sleep away.
And when I wake up

106
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,977
it is morning. Get it?
- Sure, I do.

107
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,906
Time to get in there.
The boss is waiting.

108
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:48,394
You are already in. ls this
any time to come to the office?

109
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:51,322
Sir, actually the cab...
I mean, the bus...

110
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,961
A new excuse!

111
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,602
But learn to be in time.
Understand?

112
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,335
Sir, according to the chart...
- Relax. Sit.

113
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:08,878
According to the chart, this plot
is ours. But Dhabla is not giving us.

114
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:14,744
I don't want to mess with Dhabla.
God has given us so much already

115
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:20,582
Why fight over a bit of land?
- A bit of land, but it's our land!

116
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:23,823
He has made a liquor den out of it.
Tomorrow he might turn it into a club

117
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,090
and a casino. He may
turn it into anything.

118
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:31,033
What can be done against Dhabla?
We did sent him official letters.

119
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:34,570
It was of no use. You know the state
of the police around here.

120
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:39,977
To let Dhabla have the plot means to
bow before a petty criminal.

121
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:45,445
We should give him a sound reply.
- I've tried doing everything I can.

122
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:49,116
If you have any way out, go ahead.

123
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:06,865
Hey! Who are you?

124
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,873
Why don't you speak?
Are you mute?

125
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:19,285
You have got the notice to
shift this place,

126
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:26,721
I've burnt countless such notices
in this furnace right here.

127
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,825
Whose man are you?
Khanna's? Or the governments?

128
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:31,827
He is an engineer.

129
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:38,497
Whoever you are, you won't
escape alive out of here.

130
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,903
I want this place vacated
by tomorrow. Get it?

131
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:55,044
Else, this fireplace will burn
your bones to smithereens.

132
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:58,386
Tell this to your Dhabla!
And yes...

133
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,390
You wanted to know
my name, didn't you?

134
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:05,916
Vijay Saxena. Hear that?

135
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:19,999
What was his name?
Yes, Vijay.

136
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:25,402
His elder brother is a lawyer.
Father, a college principal.

137
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,007
And he is an engineer.

138
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:31,615
So many educated ones in a family.
Do you see?

139
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:37,119
If you say, shall I cut him in two?
- No!

140
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:40,084
Chugani used to say...

141
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,160
"Deal carefully with the educated".
Understand?

142
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:51,632
But I fail to understand one thing

143
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:57,245
in the case of Dinesh Gupta,
the one whom Kali assaulted,

144
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,850
knows what I am. But how come
his son doesn't?

145
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:06,117
Uncle, he had once before
messed with Kali.

146
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,951
You son of a gun! Why haven't you
told me that he hit you before?

147
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,055
Pop, I thought...
- Shut up!

148
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,460
Not Pop.
Don't you call me Pop.

149
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:20,662
Of what use is that hair
which grows on his head & face?

150
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:27,136
He thinks he is a tiger.
Scoundrel! He has tarnished my name.

151
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,930
Get the car. Let me settle scores
with that idiot.

152
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:10,144
Mr Khanna, are you fed up
with life?

153
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:17,423
Say what? It happens. When a man
is all alone, the heart starts yearning.

154
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,028
But you have a little son.
Where does he study?

155
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,022
Look, Dhabla, I...

156
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:29,392
Don't you show anything to me.
Just listen. Got it?

157
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:35,175
Just listen to what I say.
Interruption makes me forgetful.

158
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:39,274
What was I saying...? Yes, about
your son. He studies in Ooty?

159
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:44,415
I apologise for what happened.
Actually, it was my fault.

160
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,153
I should've held Vijay back.
- Look Khanna...

161
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:53,017
I opened a liquor den on your plot.
I agree, I didn't ask for permission.

162
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:57,160
But you too never complained to me.
Did you?

163
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,364
Then what's this all about
police, court and notices?

164
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,436
What's going on?
But did I ever complain about anything?

165
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:08,174
I never said a word. Buddy, you do
your job & I'll do mine.

166
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:12,274
Had I wished to grab that land,
I could've taken your signature

167
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:17,850
in the legal documents.
I can do it, don't you agree?

168
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:22,520
But did I do that? Did l?
Chugani used to say...

169
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,589
"Never enter into an agreement
with educated people."

170
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:32,197
You and I were going along just fine.
Like the government.

171
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:35,266
Where did that cheapskate
appear from?

172
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,134
Come in.

173
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,210
So you are Vijay?

174
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,283
So, it was you who destroyed
my liquor den?

175
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,782
Yes. Because the plot which you used
to deal in

176
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,150
belongs to Khanna constructions.

177
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:02,123
How are you related to Khanna?
...Khanna, have you married into his family?

178
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:06,297
I'm an engineer in this company.
- Don't mess up again

179
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,830
Else, Khanna will have to bear the
cost of your mistakes.

180
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:14,337
Dhabla, I feel you have a terrible
misconception about yourself.

181
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:19,370
The first thing you should do is to
change the look on your face.

182
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,007
Such heat in the principal's blood!

183
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:29,248
Let me once lay my hands on you.
I'll squeeze like a tomato.

184
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:31,148
You'll squeeze me...?
- Vijay!

185
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:35,852
You need not interfere.
Mind your own business.

186
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:40,930
The world is bereft of any decency.
Everyone becomes weak around thugs.

187
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,198
Why are you upset if Mr Khanna
doesn't want to rock the boat?

188
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,672
It's a question of values.

189
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,539
We bow, and it raises heads
like Dhabla.

190
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:57,082
Just yesterday, Kali tried to
act fresh with Pooja.

191
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,545
I gave him a reply.
But it wasn't harsh.

192
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,882
Scoundrels like him ought
to be hacked to pieces.

193
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:07,284
Vijay, your anger scares me.
Won't you smile?

194
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:10,559
Smile. Please.

195
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,899
I was so nervous meeting your brother.

196
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:20,335
One look at him scared
the hell out of me!

197
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,307
How am I to face the rest
of your family?!

198
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:30,652
Worry not. My folks are very kind.
They'll be very happy to meet you.

199
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,136
Agreed. But what am I to talk?
What type of a person is your father?

200
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,324
The first time I heard your name,
I thought you would be very loud and talkative.

201
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:46,262
But you are a real shy guy.
- Not really.

202
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,072
I speak a lot, but...
- Now you've run out of stories for us!

203
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,572
That's the aura of the girl's house.

204
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:57,441
- What's the matter? Vikas hasn't called yet?
- He called, has some urgent business

205
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:03,743
Look Raja, you have the liberty to
go stingy on words, but not on food

206
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,952
In this matter I won't
give you a chance to

207
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:09,954
You have some more, sir.

208
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,959
Priya, you will scald your hands.
Let me do it.

209
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:17,260
I'll do it.
- Let her do it.

210
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,629
You'll go away from this house. Then
she will be the one to look after everything

211
00:28:21,794 --> 00:28:23,831
Go and give these puris.
- No. I won't go.

212
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:25,971
Go, I say. Go.

213
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:33,376
Raja, it was nice meeting you.
I like my daughters choice.

214
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:37,450
She has got me out of a big quandary.
- Not her.

215
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,651
What? Why do you want to
take the credit?

216
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:44,287
Because I initiated it.
Right?

217
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,128
And I was dead scared to see you.

218
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:51,326
I wondered whether you had come
with a proposal or to carry me out.

219
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,001
We were really worried about Pooja.
Now she and you will get married at the sane time.

220
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:02,507
Pinky, how do you like this Aunty?
- Nice. But she doesn't laugh.

221
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:06,181
Priya, that's enough. You've got
to go home.

222
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,013
Looks like it's going to pour.
You must leave.

223
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:14,281
Yes, Bhabhi?
- Drop Priya home.

224
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:18,519
All right. If you say so.
- Oh really? I'll hit you

225
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,024
Go and drop her.
- Bye Bhabhi.

226
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:28,600
Let's get down to work.
Good girl.

227
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:47,350
What's wrong?

228
00:33:16,636 --> 00:33:19,708
I ask you, aren't the law
and police made to serve us?

229
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,877
It's been six months, and you haven't
yet found my sons killers.

230
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,716
Despite my telling you that
Kali is the murderer.

231
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,390
Old man, are you out of your senses?

232
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,860
Your son was doped when he fell
to his death from the hilltop.

233
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:39,603
Don't waste our time. If you have any
evidence then bring it to us.

234
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:43,907
From where do I bring evidence?
He has bought everyone including you.

235
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,004
Pandey! Doshi!
Throw this old man out!

236
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,077
What else can a corrupt
police official do?

237
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,046
Move it, oldie!
- Sure. ls there no one to hear my woes?

238
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:57,484
It's the criminals, who buy scoundrels
like you for their benefits.

239
00:33:57,844 --> 00:33:58,822
Move it!

240
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,688
I hope you aren't hurt?
Be careful.

241
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:12,101
Principal sahib? The ones who are
careful are given the run-around.

242
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:16,463
They haven't yet arrested my son's
murderer due to lack of evidence.

243
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:18,768
Tell me, where do I bring
the evidence from?

244
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:23,111
Help me sir. Aren't you
the principal of that college?

245
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:25,939
You very well know that Kali
is the one who killed my son.

246
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:29,715
Please testify, sir. Please!

247
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:37,456
Look, I can't help you in this
matter. Since I don't know anything about it.

248
00:34:38,184 --> 00:34:41,927
So you talk like them? Your name
is Satyaprakash.

249
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,131
"The one who brings to light
the truth".

250
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:50,003
If you resort to lies, your students
will never learn from you.

251
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:53,335
They will be called hooligans.
And men like Dabla

252
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:56,378
the edifice of this nation,
will give them their strength.

253
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,814
My son died. Good. Were he alive,
I would've killed him myself.

254
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,820
Because he was your student.

255
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:09,658
Try... try to understand.

256
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:14,362
I do. I understand everything.
You are the confused one.

257
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,494
Because it's my son who
was killed, not yours.

258
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:22,495
The support of my old age
has been snatched, not yours.

259
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,509
When an incident in your family

260
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,546
when your offsprings suffer to death
right in front of you

261
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:33,809
will give you the true sense of the name
bestowed upon you Mr. Saxena!

262
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,313
And then you will realise
the trauma of a father in pain.

263
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:45,022
Munna, there comes my prey.

264
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,459
Veil!
- Let go of my veil.

265
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,196
Shall l?
Munna...

266
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:56,202
Yes?
- Shall I let go her veil?

267
00:35:56,562 --> 00:36:00,135
Let go. Else, the world will
malign the poor girl.

268
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:04,114
Let go, I say!
Else, you'll repent it.

269
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,686
Why get red hot for no reasons?

270
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:13,787
You have stolen my heart.
So I took your veil.

271
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,554
The score is settled. Right?
What say, Munna?

272
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:21,168
The principal will know about this.
- Principal?

273
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:25,303
What will he do?
He'll teach me some discipline?

274
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:40,752
Enough! No more. You can't keep misbehaving
and hiding behind your fathers name.

275
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:45,083
If you care for the best, just
get out of the college's grounds.

276
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:51,499
You raised your hand on Kali.
On Dhabla's son!

277
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,904
I'll show you!

278
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:33,365
He drove me out?!
Swine! He drives me out?!

279
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:35,467
He slapped me?!

280
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:40,380
There's some strength in his bones!
In those old mans hands.

281
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,013
I'm going to ruin his life!

282
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,685
Let's bump off that swine
after college

283
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:51,484
No Munna. No. Why him?
What use killing him?

284
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:55,164
He humiliated me before everyone.

285
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:59,796
Now let me make a show of honour.

286
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:08,842
I'll dishonour his daughter!

287
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:16,845
It'll be difficult for the principal
to show his face after that.

288
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:21,179
"Save me! I'm an educated man.
Give me respect."

289
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:26,723
Then he'll realise the
consequences of insulting me.

290
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:30,430
Help!

291
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,197
Help!
- Take her up.

292
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,639
Let go!
Help!

293
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:04,226
Scream! Call the principal.

294
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:07,962
Come on.
Let's make it upstairs.

295
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,630
The principal is upstairs.
Come on.

296
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Stupid.

297
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Run more.

298
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Please forgive me.

299
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Run

300
00:40:49,024 --> 00:40:54,024
OK lets play.
Your're my sweetheart. I'm your beloved.

301
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:41,295
Inspector, he killed her.
Kali killed my Pooja!

302
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,765
He killed my Pooja!

303
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,039
Do something, sir!

304
00:41:56,138 --> 00:42:01,053
This slap is not because
you bumped off that chick.

305
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:08,317
It happens in our trade. But because
you didn't do it using your brain.

306
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,894
Couldn't you have taken her to our
workshop?

307
00:42:12,288 --> 00:42:16,361
Forgive me. My mistake, Pop.
- Don't you call me Pop.

308
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:20,103
Even I had opened several shells
when I was younger.

309
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:23,839
But the police never got a hint.

310
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,511
Shirke has a wide mouth.

311
00:42:27,103 --> 00:42:30,482
Wonder how much I must shell out
this time to sort this.

312
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:34,152
Why are you screaming at him?
- There he comes upon hearing his name.

313
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:37,181
Come, Shirke. What have you
done with that girls body?

314
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:40,451
It's happening. Everything
will be done as we desire.

315
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:43,261
Kali is like my son.

316
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,101
Really? His second father?
Well, the secret is out.

317
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:56,867
Chugani used to say, "Be a neighbour
to a punk, but don't be a punk for the police."

318
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,840
Perhaps Chugani was unaware of
a simple fact. No body wants

319
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:05,950
to be a in a policeman's pocket,
but bad times force it upon you.

320
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:11,887
Right. You said it right. Now
tell me how much

321
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,291
to shut the law's mouth?
- This case is of murder.

322
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:19,064
Matter of someone's life.
- Life? That girls life?

323
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:21,959
Not her's.
Kali's life.

324
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:26,435
It's a case of murder, you see. For
the noose

325
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:29,167
don't we need a neck?
I guess you got it?

326
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:32,570
I got it.
- The deal is going to be bit costly.

327
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:53,258
Girl's name?

328
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:03,432
Age?
- Twenty.

329
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:09,345
Do you suspect someone?
- No.

330
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,513
Ever fled home?
- No.

331
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:15,253
Did she have an affair...?
- Are you out of your mind?

332
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,420
Don't son. Don't.

333
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:21,758
If you don't help us, how
are we going to help you?

334
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:26,090
I understand. And I very well know
what this little act of yours is.

335
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:33,297
Instead of finding my daughter's
murderer, you are here to insult us

336
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:37,443
No need for this mockery.
In the name of decency

337
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:44,775
Just hand over my daughter's
dead body to me.

338
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:47,251
Sir...

339
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:49,647
The murderer is nabbed.

340
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Scumbag, just admit it.

341
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,924
You misbehaved with Pooja

342
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:57,948
And she died at your hands.

343
00:44:57,972 --> 00:44:59,472
Admit it scumbag!

344
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,075
No! No! I have told you many times,
I didn't murder Pooja, Kali did!

345
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,300
I tried to save her, Inspector.
I wanted to save her.

346
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:21,119
The swine doesn't agree for now.
But he will agree.

347
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,523
Vijay, I didn't kill Pooja.
I didn't.

348
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,593
I'm innocent, Vijay.
I'm innocent.

349
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:38,863
Kali and his men tried 
to rape Pooja...!

350
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:44,936
And then they killed her.

351
00:45:46,336 --> 00:45:48,612
This inspector doesn't listen to me.

352
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,286
I'm innocent.
Save me, Vijay.

353
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:57,558
Shut up!
Why are you maligning a decent boy?

354
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:02,024
Wonderful! You are delivering your
duty very well!

355
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:06,362
So this is how you show loyalty
towards Dhabla?

356
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:12,937
What did you say? Mind your tongue.
This is a police station.

357
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:15,572
I know it.
I even know that...

358
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:19,703
the files here contain photographs
of the innocent and the poor.

359
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:22,811
And the lock-ups here
bear the weak.

360
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:25,576
This place is worse than a brothel.
Shame on you

361
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:29,822
You! More of this crap
and I'll cut your tongue.

362
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:33,991
Are you showing your masculinity on
him, instead of on my sister killers?

363
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,159
Dhabla's dog!

364
00:47:02,378 --> 00:47:06,019
Lock this swine up!
- I won't spare you,

365
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:09,195
Even you'll have to pay for
my sister's murder!

366
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:12,022
You'll have to pay! Get it?
- Lock him up!

367
00:47:13,856 --> 00:47:15,631
Very wise of you.

368
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:19,029
Now you are caught
in the vice of the law.

369
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,037
What's happening?! Pooja's
funeral pyre hasn't even stopped smoking

370
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,779
And Vijay...
- He bashed up the inspector.

371
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:33,352
The matter has become serious.
- Tell me what now?

372
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:35,511
Try out the senior officers.

373
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:38,658
I shall meet the commissioner
tomorrow. Let's see what happens.

374
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:43,329
I wonder what move
Inspector Shirke will make.

375
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:20,364
He has tough skin.
He needs to be tortured.

376
00:48:21,624 --> 00:48:24,161
You know what I mean?

377
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,707
Dispatched to the heavens.
- No inspector!

378
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,703
True, dear. True.

379
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:38,843
Headline for tomorrow. A rapist
commits suicide in police lock-up.

380
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,618
You won't do it, Inspector.
You can't do this.

381
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:47,394
Why not? The chap keeps screaming
that the girl was his whole life.

382
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:51,958
When his "life" is no more, then
surely there's no reason for him to live.

383
00:48:55,925 --> 00:49:02,740
No! Come to your senses.
This murder will prove you're corrupt.

384
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:05,745
Help!

385
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,431
No! Spare him!

386
00:49:34,566 --> 00:49:37,206
Swine! You killed him!

387
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:42,210
His testimony could've brought
the book to my sisters killers.

388
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,346
Merciless! You have disgraced
my families house.

389
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:48,488
Take him away!
- You swine!

390
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:51,623
I won't spare you!
- Lock him up!

391
00:49:54,187 --> 00:49:56,827
If I wish I can write you off
at this very moment.

392
00:49:57,423 --> 00:50:02,236
But two suicides in one night
in a police station is too much.

393
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:04,709
It won't be wise.
There will be an uproar.

394
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:08,374
I can see the dirty colour of sin
in your eyes.

395
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:10,840
This colour is death's invitation.

396
00:50:11,671 --> 00:50:17,246
The end of not only you, but
every sinner just like you.

397
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:52,322
No!

398
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:40,429
Help!
- What happened?

399
00:51:40,493 --> 00:51:41,938
Help! Help me!

400
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:45,538
Inspector, help me!

401
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,946
He'll kill me!
- Swine! I won't spare you!

402
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:53,747
I'll kill you!

403
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,006
No!

404
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:09,015
Help! Help!

405
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:22,036
You son of a gun!
Who bashed you up this time?

406
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:25,373
Bashed me up?!
What crap!

407
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:33,705
You know, this time I entered the
police station to see Vijay getting..

408
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:39,514
Thank his stars that my eyes opened
at the right moment.

409
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:43,848
Else, I would've killed him, Pop.

410
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:47,561
Don't you call me Pop.

411
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:50,933
I feel as if someone
spat on my face.

412
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:54,935
You always complain. What else do
I call my Pop, if not Pop?

413
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,396
Shut up!

414
00:52:57,995 --> 00:53:01,065
I doubt if you are my son, or...!

415
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:04,538
You are scared of
that engineer, are you?

416
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:10,550
I'm going to see him stuck
to the prison walls

417
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:13,654
Pop!

418
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:27,759
Hello Dhabla.

419
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:31,532
What have you done to
the police station?

420
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:33,773
Looks like a battlefield.

421
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:39,110
Chugani would've said, "it looks
like a desolate island."

422
00:53:40,905 --> 00:53:45,820
In which police station are you going
to pursue my actions?

423
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:50,818
Worry not. Trust me. He is in for
a long stretch.

424
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:54,823
Shut your mouth. And don't
venture out of the police station.

425
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:59,931
The eunuchs might take you along.
You know them,

426
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:06,135
Say what?

427
00:54:07,598 --> 00:54:11,705
Nice. It's nice to see
this vandalised building.

428
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,281
But, what use? You had to wear
the officials full force.

429
00:54:17,308 --> 00:54:21,950
What had you told me? To change
the mirror in my house?

430
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:27,724
Sonny, Dhabla rules here.

431
00:54:28,052 --> 00:54:31,898
And in Dhabla's court everyone's
account is double-checked.

432
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:34,760
Start writing your
criminal accounts, Dhabla.

433
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:38,836
Because, once I am out
I'm going to uproot your whole life.

434
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:42,477
Look, the jackal voices
before the tiger!

435
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,178
Till date you've been
encountered by cowards.

436
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:51,850
The day you face this man, you'll be
rid of this thought that you're a lion.

437
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:57,222
The ones who try to touch me,
I bury them six foot holes in the ground.

438
00:54:57,581 --> 00:54:59,857
Start digging your grave,
and your son's too.

439
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:04,530
Perhaps you won't get
the opportunity once I'm out.

440
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:06,659
Real hot blood!

441
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:13,598
What did you say?
How long will he be sentenced?

442
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:17,604
As of now, for six months.

443
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:20,003
But I'll try and get him a year.

444
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:25,618
Can't make it for 3 years?
- Possible under a different charge.

445
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:30,223
7 years...?
- Section 307. Attempt to murder.

446
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:35,019
How about 14 years...?
- Murder.

447
00:55:36,053 --> 00:55:40,229
I see. Only if he murders someone?
Else, no?

448
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:09,296
Dhabla! What have you done?

449
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:11,061
I did?
- Yes.

450
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:16,736
I didn't do it.
He did it. Not I.

451
00:56:17,096 --> 00:56:25,277
He attacked the constable, and killed
him. Then tried attacking you.

452
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:33,285
Now tell me.
Tell me, what's his sentence?

453
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,290
Wonderful! What a criminal-mind!
What sense of brilliance.

454
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:41,530
He will go directly
to the gallows.

455
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:45,830
Not the gallows! No!

456
00:56:49,195 --> 00:56:53,871
Had I wished,
I could've driven this through you instead.

457
00:56:55,434 --> 00:57:00,440
But, no. I want to keep you alive.
In prison.

458
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,983
For 14 years.

459
00:57:04,076 --> 00:57:09,890
Rot for 14 years in this cell,
and keep chanting Dhabla's name.

460
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:14,664
Forget 14 years, even if I have to
wait for 14 lifetimes

461
00:57:15,087 --> 00:57:17,328
I'll wait to eliminate you sinners.

462
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:23,267
You can't run away from death!
You can't escape your fate!

463
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:52,167
What has happened to you, child?
Look what you've done to yourself.

464
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:56,030
Would Vijay come back
if you stop eating?

465
00:57:59,298 --> 00:58:03,474
Aunt, this is all a lie.
Vijay has done nothing.

466
00:58:04,203 --> 00:58:07,480
He is innocent.
He is being framed.

467
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:13,882
Calm down, dear. Losing courage
won't make a difference.

468
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,524
Even his folks at home might be
grieving. Who will comfort them?

469
00:58:20,152 --> 00:58:22,962
Have faith in God.
He will make everything fine.

470
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:27,464
And why do you worry? His brother
will surely do something.

471
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:35,570
Vijay my son, what has
happened to you?

472
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:37,315
Say something.

473
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:42,182
What is it?
Why are you screaming?

474
00:58:42,711 --> 00:58:48,457
What else can a common man do?
- What is the need to do anything?

475
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:52,723
To do, and have it done, is our job.
- Is this your job?

476
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:56,733
To tie up and beat an innocent?
If you are a man then catch the real criminals.

477
00:58:56,958 --> 00:59:00,804
and lock them up. Can you do it?
Can you catch Dhabla's crew?

478
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:05,611
Satyaprakash!
Mind you tongue oldie!

479
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,341
No shackle can bind the truth.

480
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:13,181
You will tire yourself. But you can
never leash those that deserve it.

481
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,088
Because you are a sinner
worse than those criminals.

482
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:21,159
In the name of a government badge
you trade lives for money.

483
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:27,221
I pity the future of the nation
whose ideals

484
00:59:27,388 --> 00:59:31,962
have stooped down to dirty tricks.
But don't you forget for one second;

485
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:38,373
The waves of rebellion destroys
the rocks of complacency.

486
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:00,062
Father...
At this hour of night?

487
01:00:01,923 --> 01:00:05,996
What else can a helpless father
do but try?

488
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:10,675
And...
- Be brave, father.

489
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:17,009
This problem is not limited to us.
There must be hundreds of people

490
01:00:17,172 --> 01:00:20,346
in this city facing
such nuisance.

491
01:00:22,043 --> 01:00:27,186
We too must face it.
We must find a way.

492
01:00:27,549 --> 01:00:33,591
What way? Every step leads
to the muck of crime!

493
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:35,662
Where will you find a way?

494
01:00:37,826 --> 01:00:42,002
I see no ray of light
in this absolute dark.

495
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:32,246
Forgive me, sir!

496
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,770
-You mean our nighclub?
-That's the one the police raided.

497
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:05,794
They also arrested 3 of our men.

498
01:02:07,926 --> 01:02:10,907
Where the hell did this Kulkarni
appear from?!

499
01:02:11,263 --> 01:02:14,540
Call up Shirke. Let's find out
his records of achievement.

500
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,409
Wonder how many millions I will have
to shell out to shut this guys mouth.

501
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,920
Hello. Kothwadi police station.

502
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:27,413
Dhabla?
Yes, I found out.

503
01:02:28,914 --> 01:02:33,124
No. Whatever has happened has happened. 
Nothing can change that fact.

504
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,621
Let's meet.

505
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,130
<i>Sir, the assistant commissioner
has called you into his office.</i>

506
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:56,678
Why do the seniors do this mischief?
Everything was going so well.

507
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,147
Why did they have to transfer
this man here?

508
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,152
It's going to be trouble.
- Trouble is for sure.

509
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,154
Sir... you?!

510
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:19,634
There sure will be trouble if the
guardians of society are tainted.

511
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,166
No sir. We are up to the mark.

512
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:26,608
I know how well you execute
your duties around here.

513
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:31,647
All the illegal activities which
should've been closed under your watch

514
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,182
have been literally carrying on
right in front of everyone.

515
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:37,858
And you say you are up to the mark?
- Sir,

516
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:43,790
Shirke, you haven't yet realised
the importance of this uniform.

517
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:49,198
You are such a pest. You have made
the walls of this police station

518
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,206
so weak that even
a little boy topples it down.

519
01:03:54,999 --> 01:04:00,472
In future, if you try to
shelter a lawbreaker...

520
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,748
you will never see this uniform
being worn by you again. Understand?

521
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:11,221
And yes, have Vijay Saxena
transferred to my custody.

522
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:18,226
I'll personally investigate
the truth behind this case.

523
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:53,621
Look...

524
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:56,728
Whatever has been done to you, fair
or unfair, is done.

525
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,977
But if you try this escapade again,
you will put youself into difficulty.

526
01:05:59,229 --> 01:06:00,333
Get it?

527
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,145
Get that boy's case file.

528
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:18,750
I'm Vikas Saxena.
Vijay's elder brother.

529
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:22,594
Yes, Mr Vikas?

530
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:27,167
I want to tell you that
my brother is innocent.

531
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,799
He hasn't committed this murder.
He is being framed.

532
01:06:33,164 --> 01:06:38,170
Every criminal's relatives say that
their man is innocent.

533
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,015
Have you ever led your father, 
son or brother

534
01:06:43,174 --> 01:06:46,155
to say that he is a criminal,
lock him up? No, right?

535
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,922
But sir, Vijay is...
- Look Mr Vikas...

536
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:53,387
Every case which involves the police
is based on truths & untruths.

537
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:56,495
There's no question of a case
without lies.

538
01:06:58,088 --> 01:07:00,694
Leave the rest to me.
I've sent for the case files.

539
01:07:03,427 --> 01:07:05,998
Sir, I expect justice from you.

540
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:11,208
I'll try.

541
01:07:21,112 --> 01:07:22,648
Has he eaten?
- No sir.

542
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:27,086
So you plan to die
in the lock-up?

543
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:33,964
No use refusing food. We will land in
trouble if anything happens to you.

544
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:39,339
Are you listening?
- Quite stubborn. He won't budge.

545
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,039
I feel scared to go in.

546
01:07:50,808 --> 01:07:53,652
Don't you know what
those men mean to me?

547
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:56,250
At this rate
I'll go bankrupt.

548
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,395
Do something. Before they face the
court, lose all the files.

549
01:08:01,819 --> 01:08:05,926
35 men watch the place. Kulkarni has
carefully chosen each guy on his team.

550
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,629
It's not an easy task.

551
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:12,668
Offer each one of them a thousand bucks 
and get the cases thrown out.

552
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:18,577
I can't even gulp down whisky.
And you are laughing?

553
01:08:19,236 --> 01:08:22,945
I remember your Chugani.
What did he say...?

554
01:08:23,174 --> 01:08:25,484
Yes, "if you take a snake for a pet
then give it milk"

555
01:08:25,676 --> 01:08:28,623
"But if you take a cop for a pet
make sure never to feed them alcohol."

556
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,793
Shirke, you haven't realised
what I am.

557
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:38,791
I know how to squeeze the one whom
I give alcohol to and let grow.

558
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,067
It's not wise to play with the law.

559
01:08:41,425 --> 01:08:45,999
What law? Solicitors like you
have made it worse.

560
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,107
Don't you scream!

561
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:54,180
Since your father has taken the reins
you've grown in stature.

562
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:57,182
Tell me if you can't do the job.
I'll deal with it myself.

563
01:08:57,474 --> 01:08:59,511
Now get out of here.
Get lost!

564
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:15,528
Hello sir. I'm Sharafat.
Dhabla sends me.

565
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:18,829
Black Label.

566
01:09:20,598 --> 01:09:22,546
It's genuine stuff.
And this is a token of our appreciation.

567
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,258
About the rest, he'll personally
come and speak to you personally.

568
01:09:26,374 --> 01:09:29,048
What's your name you said?
- Sharafat.

569
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:32,219
This is my job, to take care
of officers like you.

570
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:51,742
Genuine stuff.

571
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,574
Yes, it is.
Scoundrel!

572
01:09:56,404 --> 01:10:01,581
Sharafat! I know how to deal
with your kind of ilk.

573
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:07,090
Tell me, is it genuine or spurious?!

574
01:10:07,549 --> 01:10:10,325
Tell me!
Genuine or spurious?

575
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:20,600
Swine! Dhabla's dog tries
to bribe a policeman!

576
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:32,612
I could've locked him in
for 6 months...

577
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:35,614
for drinking and creating a scene
at the police station.

578
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,628
You guzzled the black label
that cost me 800?

579
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:50,163
You went to him drunk?
- No. He forced me to drink it all.

580
01:10:50,526 --> 01:10:54,167
What nonsense!
You mean to say he...?

581
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:59,209
Moron! Move it!
- Why do you scream at me?

582
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:01,638
What keeps you standing, sir?
Please sit.

583
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,317
I haven't come here to
chat with you, Dhabla.

584
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:09,312
I am here to say that,
as soon as possible...

585
01:11:09,678 --> 01:11:15,754
shut the rest of your casinos, liquor
dens and brothels quickly.

586
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:20,328
They will be shut. Everything.
No big deal.

587
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:23,169
When the police were hungry,
all the activities were open.

588
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:25,462
Now that they are stuffed,
everything will close

589
01:11:25,627 --> 01:11:28,471
But what do I call this?
Hooliganism of the police?

590
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:31,674
You haven't yet realised the
true identity of the police.

591
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:35,944
The ones who lived off your bones
were not from the police.

592
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:38,676
They must surely be
the canine community.

593
01:11:39,608 --> 01:11:42,316
Chugani used to say...

594
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:46,082
"When a person is heated up
the other should stay cool."

595
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:49,121
I know the style of
officers like you.

596
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:52,955
At first they show big eyes, then
they switch to big puppy eyes.

597
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:58,636
How would you like to go about it?
lnstallments on a monthly..?

598
01:11:58,994 --> 01:12:02,703
First tell me, can you even carry on
for a month living in this town?

599
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:09,040
If your don't wind up, everything
here will go to the auctioneers.

600
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:13,050
And you will be locked up
with your men.

601
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:21,961
Gosh!
Such men in the police!

602
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:25,531
Open.

603
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:41,348
Your charge sheet is sent. We'll know
the date of your trial.

604
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:45,877
I guess the verdict will be given
on the first of the month.

605
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:50,557
If not the gallows, you will be
surely sentenced to life.

606
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:56,758
I've gone through your case file.
It's quite weak.

607
01:12:58,687 --> 01:13:01,327
I don't think any lawyer
can save you.

608
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:08,339
What you did, I don't think
it was unjust.

609
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:12,636
Because when you saw your sister's
murderer, you saw red

610
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:14,371
and you killed him.

611
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:19,843
But you are carrying a
misconception about Raja.

612
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:24,250
That he killed her
while trying to rape her.

613
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:30,462
Pooja was Raja's fiancee.
They were soon to get married.

614
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,065
ls it true?

615
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:38,231
But it is also true that
Raja killed Pooja.

616
01:13:39,828 --> 01:13:44,106
Why did Raja kill Pooja?
Why did he kill his fiancee?

617
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:50,343
The one who loved Pooja immensely
turned into her nightmare.

618
01:13:51,873 --> 01:13:55,082
Any other man in place of Raja
would have done the same.

619
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:00,990
Because no man would bear his
fiancee's illicit affair.

620
01:14:03,585 --> 01:14:07,590
Mr Vijay Saxena, your sister
was a wanton woman!

621
01:14:21,603 --> 01:14:25,642
Say another word against my sister,
and you will regret it.

622
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:30,249
My sister wasn't wanton.
Nor Raja killed her.

623
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:34,355
He was a witness, who was mercilessly
killed in the police lock-up.

624
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:40,133
And when I tried to save him, they...
- I'm investigating this whole incident.

625
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:44,535
I believe you are saying the truth.

626
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:48,534
But your statement won't prove
anything in a court of law.

627
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:56,616
You need evidence.
And I'll get it pretty soon.

628
01:14:59,942 --> 01:15:06,689
Forgive me. To break your silence
I had to use these tactics.

629
01:15:12,654 --> 01:15:16,397
Trust me.
You will get justice.

630
01:15:18,093 --> 01:15:23,338
But don't take any wrong steps
that may jeopardise this.

631
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:41,586
ls Mr Kamat in?
- Yes.

632
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,320
Can I speak to him?
- Yes.

633
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:47,428
Call for you.

634
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:54,174
Savitri here.
- Tell me, Savitri.

635
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,240
Meena hasn't reached home as yet.
I am worried.

636
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:01,273
Must have gone to see her friend.
Don't worry, I'll find her.

637
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:17,856
Found her?

638
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:23,459
I searched everywhere. Colleges and
also her friends houses.

639
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:26,166
They said she left college at 4.

640
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:29,601
A policeman, are you? Your daughter
goes missing and you can't find her?

641
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:34,880
Has she a police label on her?
God knows where she went.

642
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:37,808
Mother!
- My child!

643
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:41,482
What happened to you?
Where had you been?

644
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:45,887
You know the plight of a young girl's
parents when their child is out all night?

645
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:47,625
Tell me.
Where had you been?

646
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:49,819
I'll tell you.

647
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:53,956
Had I not reached on time...

648
01:16:54,256 --> 01:16:58,295
your daughter would've faced
the same fate as my sister.

649
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,504
-What?
- You heard it right.

650
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:07,303
What is the plight of a young girl's
parents when their child is missing?

651
01:17:09,271 --> 01:17:13,811
Imagine the plight of a father whose
daughter was raped and murdered

652
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:17,847
and her lover is accused.

653
01:17:19,148 --> 01:17:21,128
Imagine the plight of the father...

654
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,526
whose young son is implicated
in the murder of another

655
01:17:26,422 --> 01:17:32,998
Imagine the plight of a brother, who
on one hand lights the funeral pyre

656
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:38,334
and on the other finds that a
noose hangs over his head.

657
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:47,980
Kamat, my sister studied in the
same college as your daughter.

658
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:53,087
Your department had her reputation
disgraced and laying in tatters.

659
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:59,092
No, father. Raja and Pooja loved
each other. Why would he kill her?

660
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:03,801
Meena, he very well knows that
Raja did not kill Pooja.

661
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:08,904
But bribes have shut his mouth.

662
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:12,971
I agree. But what can I do all alone?

663
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,706
I used to be proud of you.
Because you were a police officer.

664
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:18,249
But today I feel ashamed to
call you my father.

665
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:20,987
Enough, dear.
I was helpless.

666
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:24,257
But Mr Vikas, you've saved me from
the muck of corruption.

667
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,587
I'll tell Mr Kulkarni the truth.

668
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:48,147
Kamat, run!

669
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,252
Kamat, run!
- No.

670
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:37,896
Don't worry about me. Run!
- No.

671
01:20:16,825 --> 01:20:18,702
Where were you running to?

672
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:21,163
Are you in a hurry?

673
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:26,909
Where you going to? To the assistant
commissioner? To confess?

674
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:31,443
I know everything.

675
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,715
A righteous spirit has
taken hold of you.

676
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,887
I'll let your soul
meet the supersoul.

677
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:42,953
No!

678
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,104
Look son!

679
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:35,805
Look what has happened, son!

680
01:21:56,125 --> 01:22:00,335
How is bhabhi?
- She is in a bad shape.

681
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:04,134
She is not able to face
this situation.

682
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:08,344
I can't take this anymore!
I can't!

683
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:15,148
Untie him.

684
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:06,942
Listen. Today is the hearing of
Vijay Saxena,

685
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:10,852
Damodar Thakur, Arun Shinde
and Deshpande.

686
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:16,257
I want you to take them to court.
With utmost care.

687
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,089
I'll meet you there.

688
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:24,936
Mind you, all of them are notorious criminals.
Make sure you keep your wits about you.

689
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,783
Give orders to release Vijay Saxena.
Quick!

690
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:28,527
Release Vijay.

691
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,590
Drop the gun.

692
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,004
Let's go, Priya.
Come on.

693
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:27,645
Son, where are you?
How are you?

694
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:31,017
I'm perfectly all right, father.
And, nothing has happened.

695
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,190
Yes son. But.. but I am
feeling uneasy.

696
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,928
Your bhabhi... we are all...!

697
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:43,896
I understand. But I can't bear
to see my Bhabi in this state.

698
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,796
But son, take care of yourself.

699
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:48,641
Don't worry about me.

700
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:55,409
Till I ruin the likes of Dhabla,
not even Death can stop me.

701
01:27:56,972 --> 01:28:00,112
Father, take care of yourself.

702
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:15,458
Vijay, you said it right. Someone
has to kill an animal like Dhabla.

703
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,996
The prayers of this city's aggrieved
and poor are standing with you.

704
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:24,739
Remember me
when you need me.

705
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,237
Let him go.

706
01:29:36,802 --> 01:29:40,614
Gupte... Shinde, this chap
is after my life!

707
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,911
Handle him. Shoot him
if he comes in. Lock me.

708
01:29:45,144 --> 01:29:49,320
Swine! Today I won't spare you!

709
01:29:51,684 --> 01:29:54,324
Gupte, what are you watching?
Shoot him! Lock me in.

710
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:01,069
How will you kill me now?

711
01:30:04,263 --> 01:30:05,333
Move it!

712
01:30:06,766 --> 01:30:09,337
Why did you stop?
Shoot him down.

713
01:30:09,702 --> 01:30:11,147
No one dare moves!

714
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,145
I'll blow his brains out.

715
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:18,579
Say what? How do you feel when
death hovers over you?

716
01:30:20,146 --> 01:30:21,853
It is terrifying, isn't it?
- Yes!

717
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,688
What are you listening to
his crap for? Shoot him!

718
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:29,090
All the while you have been
a "yes man" to him.

719
01:30:29,255 --> 01:30:32,759
sitting on this chair, 
has been a slave to Dhabla.

720
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:36,770
I ask you, what oath had taken
before you put on this uniform

721
01:30:37,096 --> 01:30:38,837
I ask you!
Why don't you tell me?

722
01:30:39,999 --> 01:30:42,104
Why don't you tell me?
Speak up!

723
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:48,975
You tell me. You are a sub-inspector.
You are their senior

724
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:52,121
What is the duty of the police?
Tell me!

725
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:53,685
To protect.

726
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:55,955
Protect what?
- The law.

727
01:30:56,148 --> 01:30:58,094
And?
- Life and property.

728
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,863
And?
- To protect the nation.

729
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,393
So you are guardians, are you?
Are you?

730
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,899
Do you understand
the value of this place?

731
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:14,868
A common man comes here with hope.
He holds you in a high status.

732
01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:18,647
He comes seeking justice.
But you dash his hopes.

733
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,079
If I wish I can riddle him
with bullets.

734
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:29,586
But I won't. I give you an
opportunity to atone your sins.

735
01:31:30,856 --> 01:31:35,703
He made you partners in crime.
Tell me, hasn't he?

736
01:31:37,195 --> 01:31:40,005
He has compelled you to
go against your duty.

737
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:42,769
And you traded your conscience
to him!

738
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:47,846
You have an opportunity. Wipe out the
slur this police station.

739
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:52,320
Dhabla did not kill Salvi.
He is the real killer.

740
01:31:54,585 --> 01:31:55,859
Pick it up!

741
01:31:58,332 --> 01:32:00,972
You are on duty. And you
don't listen to your superior?

742
01:32:01,168 --> 01:32:03,944
Are you heeding him? He is insane.
But you are in your senses.

743
01:32:04,871 --> 01:32:07,078
Gupte, come to your senses.
Blow him up!

744
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:12,153
We have come to
our senses, Shirke?

745
01:32:13,313 --> 01:32:15,884
You made an eunuch
out of us, like you.

746
01:32:18,218 --> 01:32:19,196
No!

747
01:33:14,325 --> 01:33:17,670
Whatever happened is embarrassing.

748
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:22,243
This incident brings shame
to our department.

749
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:26,812
Policemen gun down their fellowman
right inside the cell?

750
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:30,919
But sir, law and life were never
guarded in that place.

751
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:35,118
It sheltered deceit.
Truth used to be murdered.

752
01:33:35,413 --> 01:33:39,919
We did not kill a police officer.
Shirke wasn't a policeman.

753
01:33:40,418 --> 01:33:45,231
Under the garb of a policeman
he was a henchman of Dhabla.

754
01:33:45,723 --> 01:33:47,396
He also had <i>us</i> assist him.

755
01:33:48,426 --> 01:33:52,203
We were mute spectators
to his game of sin.

756
01:33:53,431 --> 01:33:54,603
That night...

757
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,277
That night he mercilessly shot down
constable Kamat.

758
01:34:01,506 --> 01:34:05,386
Because Kamat was about to reveal
Shirke's true colours.

759
01:34:06,544 --> 01:34:10,651
After all this you say
that we are at fault?

760
01:34:11,148 --> 01:34:16,097
We don't regret what we did.
Sack us if you so desire.

761
01:34:16,454 --> 01:34:20,095
You can do anything with us.
But we will surely know

762
01:34:20,325 --> 01:34:24,535
that by killing Shirke we
have done a noble deed.

763
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:27,638
I agree that Shirke
misused his profession.

764
01:34:28,533 --> 01:34:31,446
His crime was an heinous one,
worse than a petty criminal

765
01:34:31,669 --> 01:34:37,051
because he was a man of the law.
And whatever happened was right.

766
01:34:38,476 --> 01:34:43,221
But if every man of the law begins
to take the law into their own hands

767
01:34:43,581 --> 01:34:45,652
then the foundation of the law
will no more exist.

768
01:34:47,518 --> 01:34:52,729
I'll try to get you least possible
punishment.

769
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:58,138
And I don't want you to be
regarded as a scapegoat.

770
01:41:08,955 --> 01:41:11,902
Kali, who?
- Kali, who?!

771
01:41:13,059 --> 01:41:18,031
Strange! Don't you know
Dhabla's son Kali?

772
01:41:21,835 --> 01:41:24,782
Sir, your father called from Delhi.
- From Dehli?

773
01:41:25,004 --> 01:41:30,044
Yes. He asked you to remain at your
beach-house in Goa until he's back.

774
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:33,289
And that Vijay...
- Hush. And Vijay...?

775
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:39,296
Don't waste time. Speak up!
- He bumped off Inspector Shirke.

776
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:41,054
Now he is after you.

777
01:41:45,826 --> 01:41:50,468
Are you scaring me? Perhaps
Vijay does not know whose son I am.

778
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:53,538
I'm Dhabla's son!

779
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:59,407
By count, my father must've killed
more men than

780
01:41:59,773 --> 01:42:02,083
that Vijay has lived.
-You are right sir.

781
01:42:05,011 --> 01:42:09,756
My Pop will return, won't he?
- Yes. As of now he is concerned about you.

782
01:42:10,217 --> 01:42:13,289
Tomorrow morning you must reach
the check-post using a cab.

783
01:42:13,653 --> 01:42:16,896
In a cab?
- Vijay recognises all your cars.

784
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:19,829
Now let's get out of here.

785
01:42:24,797 --> 01:42:27,903
Hello. May I speak to Vijay?
- Yes. Hold on.

786
01:42:42,682 --> 01:42:44,628
Yes Priya?
- I found out about Kali.

787
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,795
He is off to Goa
with his men, tomorrow.

788
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:57,101
Kali will certainly leave this city.
But I'll decide where he goes.

789
01:43:02,835 --> 01:43:03,813
Faster.

790
01:43:21,955 --> 01:43:23,628
Quick!

791
01:43:25,858 --> 01:43:26,836
Faster!

792
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:14,950
Help!

793
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,561
Save me, Lord!

794
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:53,783
No!

795
01:46:15,356 --> 01:46:16,664
No! Don't!

796
01:46:17,925 --> 01:46:19,871
No! Don't kill me!

797
01:46:22,063 --> 01:46:24,441
I haven't done anything.
I haven't!

798
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:31,974
Don't kill me!

799
01:47:59,335 --> 01:48:02,407
I'm officer Kulkarni.
I need to meet Priya.

800
01:48:02,638 --> 01:48:05,881
What is the matter, Aunt?
- I came to meet you.

801
01:48:06,108 --> 01:48:09,089
Yes?
- I want to know where Vijay is.

802
01:48:09,445 --> 01:48:13,291
And I know very well
that you know it.

803
01:48:13,615 --> 01:48:18,223
Of course, I know. He resides in the
hearts of the poor, needy & destitute.

804
01:48:18,387 --> 01:48:22,164
He lives in their prayers.
- Prayers decide hope & dreams.

805
01:48:22,391 --> 01:48:27,101
Not Law. Perhaps you are unaware
that the deadly game

806
01:48:27,263 --> 01:48:32,076
which he plays, aided by you,
leads him straight to the noose.

807
01:48:33,402 --> 01:48:35,882
He can't escape the law.
- Law?!

808
01:48:36,105 --> 01:48:40,747
I know you and your law in and out.
Today Dhabla's life is in trouble

809
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:44,858
And to save him, you take
the help of law to nab Vijay?

810
01:48:45,014 --> 01:48:48,154
Where was the law when
his sister was raped?

811
01:48:48,384 --> 01:48:52,230
Where was your law when his brother
was killed in the middle of the road?

812
01:48:53,422 --> 01:48:57,097
And where was your law when
he was falsely accused?

813
01:48:58,361 --> 01:49:03,003
What is my Vijay's fault?
Just that he is an honest man?

814
01:49:03,365 --> 01:49:05,606
And he never relents
to hooliganism?

815
01:49:05,834 --> 01:49:09,043
Look Priya, we have collected
all the evidence we need.

816
01:49:09,405 --> 01:49:14,946
It's not late as yet. Tell Vijay to
stop this madness and hand himself in.

817
01:49:15,677 --> 01:49:17,953
Else, I won't be able
to do anything later.

818
01:49:30,092 --> 01:49:31,070
One moment.

819
01:49:45,474 --> 01:49:48,114
I'm sure the call was made
from a public booth.

820
01:49:48,477 --> 01:49:52,948
Find out booths where road drillings
are taking place.

821
01:50:18,507 --> 01:50:21,386
What happened?
Did he say anything?

822
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,181
No sir. He is not willing
to say anything.

823
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:26,682
Oh come on.
I said I know nothing.

824
01:50:27,015 --> 01:50:33,091
Look, it's important to nab him. Just
tell us anything you know.

825
01:50:33,455 --> 01:50:36,800
Didn't I tell you? I know nothing.
Why do you keep wasting my time?

826
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:39,867
Sir, he won't listen.
Let me break his legs!

827
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:57,948
Here! Break it.
Break this one too!

828
01:50:59,548 --> 01:51:02,324
Perhaps you will be content
to deliver your message

829
01:51:02,551 --> 01:51:08,024
by making an handicap more helpless.
Break this other leg too!

830
01:51:09,525 --> 01:51:13,530
Perhaps the government will present
you a medal.

831
01:51:15,498 --> 01:51:21,141
I have lost this leg for
the sake of decency.

832
01:51:24,673 --> 01:51:28,985
I had flatly refused Dhabla
in abetting crime.

833
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:36,020
And in return, he mercilessly
broke my leg...!

834
01:51:39,554 --> 01:51:44,333
And officers like you never even
dare to touch criminals like him.

835
01:51:45,394 --> 01:51:50,366
You just pursue warriors who desire
to give Dhabla everything he deserves.

836
01:51:53,602 --> 01:51:56,310
But he won't come into your hands.

837
01:51:57,573 --> 01:52:00,986
Till he sees the end of Dhabla,
he won't come up.

838
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:06,784
You have the power of guns.
But he...

839
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:12,521
He has the prayers of poor
and helpless people like me.

840
01:52:14,623 --> 01:52:15,795
Sir...!
- No!

841
01:52:17,626 --> 01:52:22,041
To trouble him more will
show us our corruption.

842
01:52:23,632 --> 01:52:29,810
Meeting him has shown me the
extent of people's desperation.

843
01:53:45,781 --> 01:53:47,226
I knew it!

844
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,895
You were forever in a hurry.

845
01:54:00,962 --> 01:54:07,504
7 months into his mother's womb,
he started to kick his way out.

846
01:54:09,671 --> 01:54:11,309
He was in a hurry.

847
01:54:18,681 --> 01:54:20,922
I'll perform his last rites.

848
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:26,424
l, his father, will perform
his last rites!

849
01:54:27,756 --> 01:54:32,136
I'll burn him!
I'll watch him burning!

850
01:54:33,696 --> 01:54:38,236
No! I won't wait to watch
my son's pyre go up in smoke, no!

851
01:54:41,570 --> 01:54:43,550
There are more waiting to die...

852
01:54:44,839 --> 01:54:49,254
those who won't have anyone
to give them their last rites.

853
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,242
Blood!

854
01:55:19,381 --> 01:55:20,883
Hurts, isn't it?

855
01:55:22,317 --> 01:55:27,926
Where had you been? To the temple?
To pray for the life of your brother-in-law?

856
01:55:29,324 --> 01:55:32,305
He will die.
Like your husband.

857
01:55:33,295 --> 01:55:35,969
One has to face the consequences
of taking on Dhabla, right?

858
01:55:36,631 --> 01:55:40,044
Take care, Dhabla.
Because, wherever he is...

859
01:55:40,301 --> 01:55:42,838
Vijay is piling up wood
for your pyre!

860
01:55:43,271 --> 01:55:48,084
Certainly, Goddess!
Not for him, but for his own funeral.

861
01:55:53,247 --> 01:55:55,158
Now the moron will come.

862
01:59:05,491 --> 01:59:06,834
No!

863
01:59:48,199 --> 01:59:49,678
Drive, Priya.
