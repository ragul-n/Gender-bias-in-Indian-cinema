00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:14,946
Smoking is injurious to health.
It causes cancer.

2
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:22,162
Smoking is injurious to health.
It causes cancer.

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,040
Consuming alcohol
is injurious to health.

4
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:30,243
Consuming alcohol
is injurious to health.

5
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,361
Please bring the
maths book in the night.

6
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,671
Okay.

7
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:19,401
Just take a quick look to that side
one fish is coming out of the nets.

8
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,199
I am feeling so sad..

9
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,331
..by seeing that girl as she should..

10
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,821
..have been wearing
colorful saree at this age.

11
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,105
Being a friend of mine you guys
should be taking care of these things..

12
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,916
..as she is wearing
a saree like a widow.

13
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:37,496
Boss, if you are feeling
bad can we print the saree?

14
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,820
Yes, print it but from
where will you get the colors?

15
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,023
Colors are in plenty when
it comes to make you happy.

16
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,887
What have you done?

17
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:13,171
Favor, it's just a
small favor from our side.

18
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,793
You are an unmarried girl..

19
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,009
..and you are roaming about
by wearing a saree of a widow..

20
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,374
..for which we felt very bad..

21
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:20,942
..the reason which
we printed your saree.

22
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,184
We did not enjoy that..

23
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:29,846
..much as the front
part got printed..

24
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:31,387
..but the back side
is still like a widow.

25
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,766
You should have told me earlier.

26
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,332
What have you done guys?

27
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,805
I have only one
saree to go to school.

28
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:52,832
I wash it in the night and
wear it to school in the morning.

29
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:57,008
I don't know whether the
stains would go off post washing..

30
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,845
..and then how can I go to school?

31
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,103
What will you do by going to school?

32
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,750
After few days you will have to go..

33
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,062
..to your father in law's house
and cook food.

34
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,305
On a daily basis
we set up a school here.

35
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,980
You come with your
books here wherein..

36
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:12,642
..we will teach you how to
live your life with fun and frolic.

37
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,561
So many of you are standing here..

38
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:18,994
..and watching that in the
midday in the mid of the street..

39
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,251
..these guys are insulting me..

40
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:25,386
..and you people are laughing
instead of protesting against them.

41
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,184
You can cry to whatever extent..

42
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,347
..but nobody can say anything
against me in this area.

43
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,063
Understood?

44
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,645
Does anyone have the guts?

45
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,874
What has happened?

46
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:38,009
Nothing has happened yet
but something will happen soon.

47
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,171
The kind of drama
that you have started..

48
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:45,590
..in front of the mob
I will put an end to it.

49
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,873
Just wait.

50
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:56,942
What is your name?

51
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,293
Mini Mukherjee.

52
00:07:58,861 --> 00:07:59,861
Where do you live?

53
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:02,618
I stay in the Choudhury colony.

54
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,780
Okay you can go.

55
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,172
Stop, stop, stop... go.

56
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,592
Lets go.

57
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,051
Now tell me what you wanted to say?

58
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:26,132
Do you know who am I?

59
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,051
I don't want to know who you are?

60
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:32,701
But you loafers
should know who am I?

61
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:33,755
Loafer?

62
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,619
Do you know Rana is the
son of minister Ajit Choudhury?

63
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:39,498
You know if he wishes
What he can do with you?

64
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,281
I have already seen what he can do.

65
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,929
He has put tea in the
saree of a little girl..

66
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:45,213
So what happened to you?

67
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,889
I wished to do a favor.

68
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,227
When I saw that you are doing
favor to others then I thought..

69
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:51,821
..that I should do
favor for you as well.

70
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,389
Look you don't like white color..

71
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,524
..but still you are
wearing white color..

72
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,132
..so I thought of
printing your white shirt.

73
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,618
So how are you liking
the shirt of your boss?

74
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:04,712
How am I looking...

75
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:09,388
Okay you did not like the color..

76
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,442
..but tell me how will
I come to know that..

77
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:14,860
..which color would you like out
of black, blue, green and yellow.

78
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:16,766
Don't try to pull your hand,
you will not be able to do it.

79
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,077
Instead I am leaving your hand and
would show you a different color.

80
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,969
Just let me know whether
you like the color or not.

81
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:30,496
If you like the color..

82
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,550
..I will not give you
the color by one or two drops..

83
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,617
..rather immerse your shirt
in the same color and yours too.

84
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:39,483
You might have seen..

85
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,157
..there are pictures of Gods
and Goddesses..

86
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:43,996
..on the upper portion of the doors..

87
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,659
..when somebody gets
out through that door..

88
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:50,929
..they pay respect and then go out.

89
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,078
So you also do one thing..

90
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,929
..I don't know what
pic you have in your door..

91
00:09:56,794 --> 00:10:01,051
..but who so ever picture is there
remove it and put your shirt there..

92
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,619
..so that when you will
go out you will see the shirt..

93
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,713
..and remember my face..

94
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:10,226
..and then you will decide that whether
you will do favors to others or not.

95
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:15,861
Still if you want to do
favors to others then remember..

96
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:20,227
..whether others will come or not..

97
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,078
..Nawab will come for
sure to do favors for you.

98
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:40,765
Nawab, now take my answer.

99
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:37,476
"Nawab, Nawab."

100
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:44,760
"Nawab, Nawab."

101
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:52,178
"Nawab, Nawab."

102
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:58,693
"Nawab, Nawab."

103
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:03,991
"Wherever there is any injustice
or any wrong thing happening.."

104
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,924
"..Nawab will come out
of the earth to give the answer."

105
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:18,144
"Nawab, Nawab."

106
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:29,441
"Nawab, Nawab."

107
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:37,122
"Nawab, Nawab."

108
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:40,825
"Wherever there is any injustice
or any wrong thing happening.."

109
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:53,959
"..Nawab will come out
of the earth to give the answer."

110
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:50,241
"Nawab comes for the people who
are not getting any food to eat."

111
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:05,529
"Nawab comes to give
food to the orphans.."

112
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:12,458
"..who are not able
to have any food to eat."

113
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:16,844
"Nawab is not the God
but he provides food to.."

114
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:20,423
"..those who doesn't
have anything to eat."

115
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:26,833
"Nawab, Nawab."

116
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:34,379
"Nawab, Nawab."

117
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:38,771
"Nawab.."

118
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:18,737
"Those who beat the poor
and take all the things from them.."

119
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:26,790
"..Nawab comes to
the rescue of them."

120
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:40,736
"Those who beat the poor
and take all the things from them.."

121
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:48,789
"..Nawab comes to
the rescue of them."

122
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:55,719
"Nawab will remove the poverty by
distributing enough money to the poor."

123
00:16:56,465 --> 00:17:03,146
"Nawab, Nawab."

124
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:10,292
"Nawab, Nawab."

125
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,217
"Nawab."

126
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:18,520
"Wherever there is any injustice
or any wrong thing happening.."

127
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:27,606
"..Nawab will come out
of the earth to give the answer."

128
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:32,239
"Nawab."

129
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:43,288
"Nawab, Nawab."

130
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,780
"Nawab, Nawab."

131
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:00,888
Who are you guys?

132
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:02,153
What do you want?

133
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,991
You will not recognize
us your daughter knows us.

134
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:06,985
Call her.

135
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,364
What do you want from her?

136
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,785
Just an old calculation to solve,
Where is she?

137
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,283
Okay understood.

138
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:19,666
She is in that room.

139
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,974
No no don't do it.

140
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,596
Get out of the way.

141
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:27,407
No.

142
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:28,878
I am telling you
to get out of the way.

143
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,797
You told that you had only
one saree to wear to school..

144
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:48,251
..but here you are
wearing a new saree.

145
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:52,077
When I told you in the
morning I had one saree only..

146
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:53,839
..but now I have lot of sarees.

147
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,450
Great but how come the number of
sarees changed from morning to evening?

148
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:58,467
Where did you get them?

149
00:18:58,547 --> 00:18:59,526
Nawab brother has given me.

150
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,018
Nawab!
- Yes.

151
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:07,137
From tomorrow I will wear
new saree everyday to school.

152
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,083
I will also take the new saree
from you in the mid road everyday.

153
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:13,689
So you will take away my saree.

154
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,332
How many will you take?

155
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,246
All the sarees that
Nawab will give you.

156
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,808
By spoiling one saree
you got one hit on your nose..

157
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,906
..so if you take so many sarees..

158
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:23,917
..will you be able to
bear so many hits on your nose?

159
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:24,868
What did you say?

160
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,457
Now tell me why did you come here?

161
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,960
I have one important
thing to tell you.

162
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:28,901
Tell me

163
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,771
Not here let us go to that room.

164
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:31,819
Come.

165
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,474
Guys stay there I am coming.

166
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:39,712
Where are you?

167
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,820
Wait, I am putting on the light.

168
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,086
Why did you come to the bedroom?

169
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,897
Should I give the answer to you?

170
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,362
I want to tell you one thing that..

171
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:22,826
..one who sleeps here gets
up in the morning from this room..

172
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:29,968
..but when somebody comes
from outside to sleep..

173
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:34,967
..I make them sleep
in such a way that..

174
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:38,643
..they wake up in
the hospital bed only.

175
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,811
So you will sleep alone or will
bring your friends with you as well?

176
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,287
You will be able
to find a bed for you..

177
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,595
..with your father's
recommendation as a minister.

178
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:55,293
I don't want to speak with you.

179
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,044
I am also not wanting
to talk to you.

180
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,602
It is written in history that the
Nawab's speak with the Ministers..

181
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,018
..and not with the minister's sons.

182
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:11,142
Go. If at all you want to speak
with me send your father to me.

183
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:12,407
There is a limit to the edacity.

184
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,915
I will go and meet a hoodlum.

185
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,818
Why are you getting so angry?

186
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:21,401
Ministers makes a
list of the hoodlums..

187
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:27,293
..and they go to them in
the night to give them money.

188
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:33,077
Tell me from where does one
hoodlum get the edacity to call me?

189
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:36,926
If your son can show the edacity..

190
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,920
..to put tea on one's saree
in the midst of the road then ...

191
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,180
Are you comparing him with my son?

192
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:43,337
Why?

193
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,607
He can do whatever he likes
as he is your son or what?

194
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:55,910
Very honest, so how many
years you are wearing this uniform?

195
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,218
Around six months.

196
00:21:57,586 --> 00:21:59,932
So it is not even 1 year..

197
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:01,132
..so that is the reason..

198
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:01,986
..why so many justified words
are gushing out of your mouth.

199
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:03,284
What do you want to say?

200
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:07,685
Nawab have shed the blood of my
son so he will have to pay for it.

201
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,533
By trying to get the value of
your son's blood don't undermine..

202
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:11,058
..the cost of your seat.

203
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:13,911
Never forget that
you are the minister.

204
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,766
I have not forgotten it
rather you have forgotten it.

205
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,923
You also forgot
about the consequence.

206
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,652
I know. Transfer.

207
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:25,501
You will inform the SP and he
in turn would tell his supervisor.

208
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,446
After that I will
have to leave this place.

209
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:31,273
So you will not arrest Nawab?

210
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:33,024
So till the time I am
not getting transferred..

211
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:37,132
..let me think whom
to arrest and whom not?

212
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:42,040
What does Nawab do?

213
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,225
Who all are there in his family?

214
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:47,381
Where does he live?
Do you know?

215
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:20,616
"Throughout my life
I have walked in this way."

216
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:28,617
"Throughout my life
I have walked in this way."

217
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:38,248
"I have worked for the mass
in this way by loving the country."

218
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:47,071
"Throughout my life
I have walked in this way."

219
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:56,336
"I have worked for the mass
in this way by loving the country."

220
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:32,324
"I will wipe out
the tears if you cry."

221
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:41,253
"If you want to live live
happily and wipe out all tears."

222
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:54,582
"I will wipe out
the tears if you cry."

223
00:24:54,755 --> 00:25:03,438
"If you want to live live
happily and wipe out all tears."

224
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:11,827
"Respect everyone,
don't be jealous of anyone.

225
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:21,784
"I have worked for the mass
in this way by loving the country."

226
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:55,438
"You are my life and everything.."

227
00:25:55,518 --> 00:26:04,389
"..and all the noises would
stop when my heart would stop."

228
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:17,880
"You are my life and everything.."

229
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:26,443
"..and all the noises would
stop when my heart would stop."

230
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:35,373
"I would like float
in the ocean of happiness."

231
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:44,498
"Throughout my life
I have walked in this way."

232
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:53,277
"I have worked for the mass
in this way by loving the country."

233
00:26:53,547 --> 00:27:02,369
"Throughout my life
I have walked in this way."

234
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:11,343
"I have worked for the mass
in this way by loving the country."

235
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,214
So many renowned doctors
are treating Piklu..

236
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:33,992
..but his fever is not coming down.

237
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:35,797
His fever will not come down..

238
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,473
..that is why I am with him always.

239
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,901
Wherever I go I take him with me.

240
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:50,100
Let him live happily
till the time he lives.

241
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:54,511
Blood cancer never gets cured.

242
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:00,283
I am in agreement with the doctor.

243
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,333
Piklu is only living
due to your care..

244
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:08,857
..and the way you have
cared for him as a mother.

245
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:12,543
We have done whatever we have.

246
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,705
Now everything depends on God.

247
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:21,051
Now get to bed as
it is too late now.

248
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:21,959
Come.

249
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:36,413
Will you say anything?

250
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,742
Daily I don't want to
tell you the same thing but..

251
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:47,461
I keep the pic of your husband
and son with me all the time.

252
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:49,936
Whenever I see them...

253
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,289
Do you know my problem?

254
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,776
When this pic was taken
Raju's age was seven.

255
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:17,084
Now 8 years have elapsed..

256
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,447
..and his physique
has changed a lot.

257
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:26,489
As a mother also I would
not be able to recognize him.

258
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:34,542
Yes but your husband
would remain the same.

259
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:37,612
That is the only
thing I can rely on.

260
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:45,745
I cannot solve the calculation till date
that why my husband did not return..

261
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:52,125
..in a lonely station when he took
Raju along with him to drink water.

262
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,544
Why did he not return?

263
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,206
Where did he go?

264
00:29:57,436 --> 00:30:05,504
That day I was crossing
the Dhupgarh station by a train...

265
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,490
Leave me.

266
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,585
Leave me.

267
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,289
Leave me.

268
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,423
Help me. Leave me.

269
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:13,734
Leave me.

270
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,261
Leave me.

271
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,829
Leave me.

272
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:34,590
Whole night I tried to search
for your husband and son ..

273
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,819
..but was not able to find them.

274
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,171
At last I brought you
here in this orphanage.

275
00:30:40,563 --> 00:30:45,576
You got 100 orphans
against your own son.

276
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:49,522
I love them like my own son.

277
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:53,279
My entire day passes
by staying with them..

278
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:57,333
..but when I come to
sleep in the room alone..

279
00:30:58,264 --> 00:31:04,967
..then I can hear clearly that Raju
is crying and telling mother.

280
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:08,562
At that point I am
not able to hold myself.

281
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:12,454
My heart gets broken down to pieces.

282
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:40,944
How many days you will be
able to confide things from Sarama?

283
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,201
Trust me Gopal brother.

284
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:48,484
For the last eight years, Sarama
has buried a deep pain in her heart.

285
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:51,214
I also bear another pain.

286
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,390
The pain of hiding the truth.

287
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,214
Every morning I wake up and
wish to tell her everything..

288
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,876
..but whenever she comes
and stands in front of me..

289
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,633
..I am not able
to tell her anything..

290
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:11,322
..but whenever she comes
and stands in front of me..

291
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:13,514
Wearing a red saree..

292
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:16,294
..and a huge vermillion dot on her
forehead..

293
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:19,253
.. and a smile on her face..

294
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:23,982
I am not able to tell
her to wipe off her vermilion..

295
00:32:24,618 --> 00:32:27,239
..as this is not
the right of a widow.

296
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:44,792
Mother, come here.
Mother, come here.

297
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,697
Mother, come here.

298
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,967
Mother, come here.

299
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,399
Mother I am feeling scared.

300
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,548
I hope you will not leave me.

301
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:09,791
I will not leave
you and go anywhere.

302
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,156
I hope you will
also not leave me.

303
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:17,696
Where will I go as I don't
have anybody apart from you?

304
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,254
Is he wanting to meet me?

305
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,459
When I was about
to leave he told me...

306
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,276
Tell him that without
appointment I don't meet.

307
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:28,735
I don't have time.

308
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:29,740
I did tell him the same..

309
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,362
..but he said he
also doesn't have time..

310
00:33:31,654 --> 00:33:33,946
..and if you don't
meet him right now..

311
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:35,643
..he will be forced
to go to police station.

312
00:33:35,838 --> 00:33:37,038
Who is the person?

313
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,173
That he did not tell me.

314
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:40,270
He only said me to tell you that..

315
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,919
..he wants to sit with you
regarding some old calculations..

316
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,454
..as he was released
from jail today.

317
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,794
What will I do sir?

318
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,037
Should I tell the
security to take him out.

319
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:51,156
Bring him inside.

320
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:26,649
How are you Ajit Brother?

321
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,301
You should not have
come here like this.

322
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:46,518
Were you supposed to leave
me there at that point of time?

323
00:34:56,616 --> 00:35:00,810
You have become a minister
from a union leader.

324
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:03,578
And me?

325
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:04,529
What do you want?

326
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,728
When I got this in my hand..

327
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:13,577
..then I wish to take
your life with this.

328
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:18,798
Do not fear.

329
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:23,230
I will not repeat the same mistake.

330
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:27,024
As I had taken the
life of a common man..

331
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,991
..the Govt has taken
8 years of my life..

332
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:34,159
..and if I take the life
of a minister like you..

333
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,797
..then I can go
for life imprisonment.

334
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,338
Tell me what you want
without wasting time.

335
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:40,765
Its late night now.

336
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:46,344
Give me back my 8 years..

337
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,128
..wherein I have stayed in jail for
you leaving my wife and children.

338
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,571
I am giving you one lakh rupees.

339
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,631
You go away from this locality.

340
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,069
One lakh rupees!

341
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:03,589
You mean to say the cost of
a minister like you is one lakh rupees?

342
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,221
okay I am giving you 2 lakhs.

343
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,415
Again that 2 lakhs?

344
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,496
In the same way you told me that..

345
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:16,951
..you will give me 2 lakh
rupees for killing Animesh Mondol.

346
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:21,048
You knew that if Animesh Mondol can be
killed you would be the union leader..

347
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:25,783
..and if you join hands with
the owner you will get lot of money.

348
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:32,032
I wanted some money
for operating my wife..

349
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:36,335
..for which I agreed
to kill Animesh Mondol.

350
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:41,827
You had taken me to
a lonely station in a Zeep.

351
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,871
There Animesh Brother was waiting..

352
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:48,660
..to catch the train
with his wife and son.

353
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:57,946
Should I call Animesh brother?

354
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,157
No.

355
00:37:00,941 --> 00:37:02,206
His wife would know everything.

356
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,493
She knows you.
- Yes

357
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,217
I will have to think of a way.

358
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,308
I will send somebody
else to call him.

359
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,519
You wait.
- Ok.

360
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,038
Mother I want to drink water.

361
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,070
Are you very thirsty?
- Ajit.

362
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,119
Look.

363
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,027
Please go with him and
make him drink some water.

364
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:29,059
Father.

365
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,470
Don't say a single word.
- Leave me.

366
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,405
Come, come.

367
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,167
Let him sit.

368
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:41,069
Leave me and where
are you taking me?

369
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,118
Why are you holding my child?

370
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,566
Leave him leave him I say you?

371
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,545
You.

372
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,512
Sit quietly.

373
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:54,225
If you make sound I
will cut your child's head.

374
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:58,063
Ajit brother tell the car to stop.

375
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:02,419
I am stopping the Zeep.

376
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,073
Finish off both the
father and the child.

377
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,420
Listen to me. I beg of you.

378
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:43,587
Hello did you finish off the work?

379
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:45,057
I think so.

380
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:46,484
Check whether he
is breathing or not.

381
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,793
Yes, Ajit brother
the work is finished.

382
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:58,917
My work is also finished.

383
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,750
You fled by keeping
me over there stranded.

384
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,254
I got back home.

385
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,275
I was not able to understand
that such a small child of Animesh..

386
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:13,545
..will help the police to catch me.

387
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,113
Tell me exactly what
is the amount you want?

388
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:19,113
For Animesh 2 lakhs..

389
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:23,048
..and for the 8 years
you wasted of mine..

390
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:26,053
..its 1 lakh per year..

391
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:27,675
..which accounts to 10 lakhs.

392
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:30,853
What are you thinking Ajit brother?

393
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,475
I am thinking that even
if I give you 10 lakhs..

394
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:40,000
..how will go to your home
in this stormy rainy night?

395
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,200
You make me laugh.

396
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,756
You have so many cars so you
will drop me with one of your cars.

397
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,021
By car?

398
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,275
Okay.

399
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:51,329
I am bringing the money. You sit.

400
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:53,081
How long will I wait?

401
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,011
You have made me wait since evening.

402
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:57,168
Wait for some more time.

403
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,362
You are not telling me
anything and just making me sit.

404
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:00,865
Today her father would return.

405
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,633
Yes. You told me that
your father works outside.

406
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:07,384
She tells this to all.

407
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,434
But actually...

408
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:11,396
Mother

409
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:16,017
You can lie to him but I cannot.

410
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:20,184
Her father killed and ...

411
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:26,119
Kill!!
- He is getting released today.

412
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:41,709
What happened?

413
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:43,893
You are very stubborn.

414
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:45,687
Its an engine failure
due to heavy rains.

415
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:46,671
Ok let me check.

416
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:40,822
Hello.

417
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:42,314
Its Ajit Choudhury speaking.

418
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:47,241
What?

419
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:49,416
Amal is dead!

420
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:51,492
How?

421
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:53,783
So sad.

422
00:41:56,562 --> 00:41:57,664
I am coming.

423
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,330
You guys listened
that Amal has died.

424
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,735
Lets go.

425
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:04,486
Sir did he belong to our party?

426
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,724
You need not know whether
he belongs to our party or not..

427
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:09,622
..but now we need to tell
that he was our party member only.

428
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:12,152
If some other party
claims the dead body?

429
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:14,033
We will have to go
there ahead of others.

430
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:15,676
The elections are ahead.

431
00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:19,654
We need to show our grief
by taking out a procession.

432
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,125
Lets go.

433
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:43,860
Move away, move away.

434
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:54,206
How did he die?

435
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,087
Probably he was walking
along the street yesterday..

436
00:42:56,167 --> 00:43:00,141
..in the stormy and rainy
night and got hit by a vehicle.

437
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:03,353
Fool, fool, fool..

438
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:06,575
..without any reason
you killed Animesh..

439
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:08,672
..and when you got
released from jail..

440
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,737
..you should have come and met me.

441
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:12,369
What will you do crying?

442
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:17,991
I am giving you thousand rupees.

443
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,162
Keep it.

444
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:24,909
My members will decorate his body..

445
00:43:25,148 --> 00:43:28,034
..and take him through
the village to the funeral ghat.

446
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:30,985
You don't have anybody.

447
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:32,093
Yes I am here.

448
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:38,455
You keep the money minister.

449
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,099
Who are you?

450
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,915
People call me Nawab.

451
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,499
So you are the Nawab.
- Yes.

452
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:46,769
You go away from
here with your gang.

453
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:49,093
I am wanting to the last rites
of him so where is the disconnect?

454
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:50,520
I am protesting as you are trying..

455
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,736
..to buy the body as
I don't have any objection..

456
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:54,012
..for you doing
the last rites of him.

457
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,699
Listen what he is telling?

458
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,801
Yes he is telling the correct thing.

459
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:03,515
You are the big brother..

460
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:14,310
..but you have never come
to look for us in the last 8 years.

461
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:15,883
No I mean..

462
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,964
He was last seen
with you in your Zeep.

463
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:27,331
And that very night
Mr. Animesh was killed.

464
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:36,801
I don't know why did he kill?

465
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:44,369
Whatever gains happened
it happened for you.

466
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:52,413
Animesh was killed
and you became the leader.

467
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:53,356
I am going.

468
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,836
Look Mr. Minister.

469
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,082
What your son is doing..

470
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:00,239
..you need not go out
for buying dead bodies.

471
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:03,320
If you son is not
able to rectify himself..

472
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:06,044
..you will get his dead
body sitting at home only.

473
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:07,244
Go away.

474
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:15,027
Gopal brother people are
talking on the roads that..

475
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,763
..the killer of Animesh
Mondol has died of a car accident.

476
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:19,622
Don't let Sarama get out.

477
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:22,660
Keep an eye on her.

478
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,254
Okay

479
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,746
Don't get so scared.

480
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:28,638
We will surely keep an eye and
we will tell you before Nawab comes.

481
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:29,698
He is absolutely right.

482
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,746
Nawab may come anytime.

483
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:33,957
Don't worry.

484
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:35,244
My sister have not
gone to school today..

485
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:36,822
..whatever we intend to
do we will have to do it today.

486
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:51,969
Get out of the way.

487
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,066
I can get out of the way..

488
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,802
..if you can open
the saree from your body.

489
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:00,845
I will take the saree given
by Nawab the son of a pig.

490
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:16,358
Hello, yes speaking.

491
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:20,758
Where are you calling from?

492
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,321
Police Station.

493
00:47:24,316 --> 00:47:25,721
You have kept my son
in the police station.

494
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,910
Okay.

495
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,688
I am leaving him as you
are telling him to leave..

496
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,872
..but in future mind it.

497
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:37,667
Bye. Go.

498
00:47:38,424 --> 00:47:39,505
If you do the same thing again...

499
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:46,391
Why do you take the law in your hands
inspite of the police force being there.

500
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:48,991
His bail is given
by his father but..

501
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:51,157
..who will give the bail for you.

502
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:56,552
If you have the money bag
do you think then it requires bail...

503
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,367
You!
- You will not know me.

504
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,567
My name is Mili.

505
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:06,724
Where is Nawab brother?

506
00:48:06,804 --> 00:48:09,265
No Mili is not there.

507
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,557
She just went out.

508
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:14,400
Tell her not to worry,
she can go to school from tomorrow.

509
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:18,086
I have told the OC and had done all
the arrangements I am coming today.

510
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:27,362
Listen can you give me
some work in your orphanage.

511
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:28,908
Work, here!

512
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:29,942
Yes.

513
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:33,384
I was not able to tell
Nawab brother regarding this.

514
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:35,547
Why your father doesn't work?

515
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,241
My father isn't there.

516
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:38,542
Okay.

517
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:43,742
My father some days ago
when he got released from jail...

518
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:45,136
What do you mean by
get released from jail?

519
00:48:46,142 --> 00:48:47,158
What did your father do?

520
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,801
Why everybody knows in this village,
did you not hear?

521
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:52,174
How will she hear?

522
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,650
Sarama has not gone outside
of this house for the last 1 year.

523
00:48:56,402 --> 00:48:58,510
I am very afraid..

524
00:49:01,364 --> 00:49:03,613
I am apprehending that..

525
00:49:04,877 --> 00:49:07,104
..if she comes to know...

526
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:10,131
I am looking into it.

527
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,705
Do you want to say something?

528
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:20,910
I want to know something from you.

529
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:30,337
Why did you not tell me even when you
knew that my husband died 8 years ago?

530
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,504
Why did you not tell me.

531
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:36,110
What have I done?

532
00:49:37,094 --> 00:49:39,126
Why did you punish me like this?

533
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,691
Tell me.

534
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:45,342
Who told you?

535
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,780
Mili came to me.

536
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,910
Why did you not tell me.

537
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,554
Don't remain quiet.

538
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,813
I have tried to tell
you innumerable times..

539
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,521
..but I was not able to see.

540
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:01,256
You willingly did not tell me.

541
00:50:01,336 --> 00:50:02,726
Sarama trust me...

542
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,478
Last 8 years..

543
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:09,029
You lied to me and now you
are telling me to believe you.

544
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:10,034
Listen Sarama...

545
00:50:10,856 --> 00:50:16,434
What good deeds have you saved..

546
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,559
..but that has been
nullified by all our sins.

547
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:24,532
The sin is for me and not for you.

548
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:26,726
Moreover you have the vermilion
by knowing that you are not a widow.

549
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:27,980
But why?

550
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:32,899
If I had heard that my husband died
I would have gone to my village house.

551
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:39,083
So you have brought
me to a place 50 miles..

552
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:41,505
..from my village
you have kept me here..

553
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:44,575
..just to look after your orphans.

554
00:50:46,889 --> 00:50:49,051
You know at all if the
others don't know that..

555
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:54,056
..I am not having any
deficit in terms of money.

556
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:59,397
I could have kept another
one to look after the orphans..

557
00:51:01,235 --> 00:51:04,251
but I would have not
got such a mother like you.

558
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,392
But what would you have
done by going to the village?

559
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:12,425
I would have known at least that..

560
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:16,998
..my husband is not more
and I would have looked for my son.

561
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:23,776
I was having in mind that my son,
wherever they are..

562
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:26,813
..they are living together..

563
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,273
..but now after 8 years..

564
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:33,322
..I am coming to know
that my husband is no more.

565
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:41,624
I don't know where is
my son and how is he now?

566
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,829
"I am fine and I am doing well."

567
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:49,461
Is it so?

568
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,743
"I am fine and I am doing well."

569
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,607
"My father's hotel is open."

570
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:05,041
"Even if my father is a policeman
he is a very straight man."

571
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,570
"I am fine and I am doing well."

572
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,825
"My father's hotel is open."

573
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:20,717
"Even if my father is a policeman
he is a very straight man."

574
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:49,129
"My father is a minister.."

575
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:52,642
"..and he swishes his stick here.."

576
00:52:52,935 --> 00:53:00,480
"..and there and we see
his tantrums by sitting at home."

577
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:08,535
"My father is a minister.."

578
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:11,941
"..and he swishes his stick here.."

579
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:19,692
"..and there and we see
his tantrums by sitting at home."

580
00:53:19,772 --> 00:53:24,092
"Like father like son and
all his team is like that only."

581
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:35,163
"Its like Nandy is walking
with Firingi on his shoulder."

582
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,854
"He slipped and fell
on the body of the other.."

583
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:42,416
"..and was unable to lift him up."

584
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:47,812
"I am fine and I am doing well."

585
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,741
"My father's hotel is open."

586
00:53:51,736 --> 00:53:58,903
"Even if my father is a policeman
he is a very straight man."

587
00:54:34,924 --> 00:54:42,557
"Look how I catch hold
of the thief like my father."

588
00:54:42,637 --> 00:54:50,028
"This catch will not work
so make them wear handcuffs."

589
00:54:54,277 --> 00:55:01,445
"Look how I catch hold
of the thief like my father."

590
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:08,764
"This catch will not work
so make them wear handcuffs."

591
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:10,511
"Now it calls me."

592
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,901
"Who are you?
- Now tell me."

593
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:24,772
"Now it will pave
the way of our life."

594
00:55:25,399 --> 00:55:32,555
"Then everybody will see
the play of both the fathers."

595
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:36,804
"I am fine and I am doing well."

596
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,874
"My father's hotel is open."

597
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:48,653
"Even if my father is a policeman
he is a very straight man."

598
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,776
Gopal brother..

599
00:56:10,027 --> 00:56:11,084
..can you tell me what
is actually happening?

600
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:12,013
What?

601
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:16,922
It is so late in the day
and Sarama has not opened the door.

602
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:20,889
This has not happened
in the last 8 years.

603
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:22,262
Let me check.

604
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:27,495
Sarama sister, Sarama sister.

605
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:31,776
Sarama sister.

606
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,868
Sarama.

607
00:56:33,111 --> 00:56:34,544
Sarama.
- Sarama sister.

608
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:49,916
I knew this kind of
thing would happen someday.

609
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:52,824
Sarama will misunderstand you.

610
00:56:56,348 --> 00:56:57,689
Where did she go?

611
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:43,086
Yes around 8 years ago about 12
miles away from Dhupgunj station..

612
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,188
..at the side of the canal we had
found the body of Animesh Mondol.

613
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:50,836
And my son?

614
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,020
With him my son was also there.

615
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,512
Your son?

616
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:02,847
Your son is not
mentioned in the report.

617
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:06,165
But he was associated with his
son when he went out of the station.

618
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:09,236
So where did he go?

619
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:12,609
That I would not
be able to tell you.

620
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,079
You can do one thing.

621
00:58:18,587 --> 00:58:21,279
If you can go to the officer
in charge who was here 8 years ago..

622
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,916
..then there is an outside chance
that might get the news of your son.

623
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,537
Where can I find him?

624
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:31,440
That officer has now become
the SP of Birbhum district.

625
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:50,995
Whom do you want?

626
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:55,298
I want to meet SP Sir.

627
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,038
Tell her to go to office not here.

628
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,433
I had told her Sir..

629
00:58:58,692 --> 00:58:59,968
..but she told me
its very important..

630
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:01,590
..and she would not take
more than 2 minutes of your time.

631
00:59:01,795 --> 00:59:03,093
She will find out one
thing and then go away.

632
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:04,098
What information?

633
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:08,249
She told me that prior to 8 years..

634
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,919
..when you were the OC
of Dhupgunj police station..

635
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:14,401
..wherein the body of Animesh
Mondol's body was found by the canal.

636
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,417
..she is his wife.

637
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,135
Please do not turn
your face from me.

638
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:22,584
Tell me the truth.

639
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:24,746
You need not tell me anything more..

640
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,795
..but only tell me
whether he is alive or not.

641
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:39,437
He is not only alive but
he has kept me alive as well.

642
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,135
My Raju is alive.

643
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:47,512
Where is he now?

644
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:49,220
Papiya.

645
00:59:57,372 --> 00:59:58,950
Look he is my brother.

646
01:00:03,004 --> 01:00:06,301
Your father is a minister
and everybody knows him.

647
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:08,951
Only I have not seen him..

648
01:00:09,978 --> 01:00:13,351
..and don't know him as
well but I know your brother.

649
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:15,222
Do you know me?

650
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,562
I was not knowing you earlier.

651
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,460
I knew you when
somebody called Nawab..

652
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:21,611
..had beaten you very badly
in front of your sister's school.

653
01:00:22,672 --> 01:00:23,515
He was beaten!

654
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:25,255
You did not come on that day.

655
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:26,877
If you had come you would
have seen that as well.

656
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,964
Did you see with your own
eyes that Nawab had beaten me?

657
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:29,656
Yes.

658
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:31,699
That day I was waiting
for Papiya near the school.

659
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:33,234
Good that you have seen me.

660
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,997
I will take you to my father..

661
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:37,386
..where you will say
that Nawab had beaten me up.

662
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:38,769
Should I say only
that he had beaten you..

663
01:00:39,688 --> 01:00:40,899
..or I will tell the reason as well.

664
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:44,315
You will say that Nawab
had beaten me without any reason..

665
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:47,039
..and if you say so your father
would put Nawab behind the bars.

666
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,488
If I say I will say
from the very beginning.

667
01:00:51,364 --> 01:00:53,937
I will say that you were
pulling the saree of a school girl..

668
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,359
..for which Nawab brother
had beaten you up.

669
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,673
So after hearing this my father will
decide whom to put behind the bars..

670
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,073
..you or Nawab.

671
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:05,612
Shut up! You are having a love
affair with my sister and you are...

672
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:07,840
Yes I am having a love affair..

673
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:10,531
..but I am not pulling
her saree like you were doing.

674
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:13,082
Look you are having
a love affair with a guy..

675
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:14,383
..who is not listening to my words.

676
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:21,294
If he had listened to you I would
have stopped mixing with him.

677
01:01:21,374 --> 01:01:23,121
What? Such a huge remark?

678
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,148
What you need not
go to school today.

679
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:26,721
Lets go home.
- Leave me brother. I say leave me.

680
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:27,828
Lets go home.

681
01:01:27,986 --> 01:01:29,791
Brother.
- Leave her.

682
01:01:32,624 --> 01:01:34,548
Then say that you will complain
against Nawab in front of my father.

683
01:01:34,628 --> 01:01:35,878
No... Raju won't say that.

684
01:01:36,094 --> 01:01:38,008
You leave me.
- You leave her.

685
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,451
What I will leave her?

686
01:01:41,651 --> 01:01:42,613
Brother!

687
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,743
Get up, get up.

688
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,321
Get up.

689
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:05,889
Where are you going?

690
01:02:06,873 --> 01:02:10,278
Look she wants to come to me..

691
01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:12,105
..and he is stopping
her to come to me.

692
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,770
Do you love her?

693
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:24,472
Where are you taking her?

694
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:26,018
Home. She is my sister.

695
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:29,045
So what that she is your sister,
she wants to go to him

696
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,418
I will not let her go.

697
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,423
This is the guy who
had beaten your brother.

698
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:34,818
Yes I will beat him today also..

699
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:36,320
..if he does not leave her hand.

700
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,218
I will not leave.

701
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:38,461
His name is Nawab.

702
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:41,045
Do you love him?

703
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,812
Love is not sin or any wrong doing.

704
01:02:46,168 --> 01:02:47,866
Do you love him?

705
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,033
Yes.

706
01:02:49,717 --> 01:02:51,628
Can you give the proof of your love?

707
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:54,093
What proof you need tell me?

708
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:56,786
Will you be able to dance by holding
his hands in front of your brother?

709
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:01,160
Yes.

710
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:30,053
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

711
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:36,982
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

712
01:03:37,425 --> 01:03:40,463
"Tell me."

713
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:44,593
"What will the judge do?"

714
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:47,782
"Tell me."

715
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:51,425
"What will the judge do?"

716
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:58,603
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

717
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:05,317
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

718
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:50,302
"When Radha Krishna
have a love relationship.."

719
01:04:50,382 --> 01:05:01,415
"..then nothing is wrong but
when these 2 are doing it is wrong."

720
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:10,334
"Should I show you
by opening the books.."

721
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,680
"..or sing you a song on the same."

722
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:22,009
"When Radha Krishna
have a love relationship.."

723
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:32,518
"..then nothing is wrong but
when these 2 are doing it is wrong."

724
01:05:33,156 --> 01:05:40,281
"Go and check the date
when you will get them married."

725
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:46,983
"Go and check the date
when you will get them married."

726
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:50,518
"Tell me."

727
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:54,475
"What will the judge do?"

728
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:57,567
"Tell me."

729
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:01,675
"What will the judge do?"

730
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:08,400
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

731
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:16,260
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

732
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:52,542
"If you make love
both body and soul.."

733
01:06:52,622 --> 01:07:03,527
"..remains well like light
coming out of the darkness."

734
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:10,846
"If you make love
both body and soul.."

735
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:21,929
"..remains well like light
coming out of the darkness."

736
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:29,151
"The bridegroom
is not bad like you."

737
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:35,378
"The bridegroom
is not bad like you."

738
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:39,313
"Tell me."

739
01:07:39,713 --> 01:07:43,086
"What will the judge do?"

740
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:46,060
"Tell me."

741
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,179
"What will the judge do?"

742
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:56,893
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

743
01:07:57,293 --> 01:08:04,428
"If husband and wife is agreeing
then what would the judge do?"

744
01:08:05,822 --> 01:08:06,773
Okay, okay.

745
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:08,168
No, no. Don't.

746
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:11,443
You can make love as you like..

747
01:08:12,849 --> 01:08:15,530
..and if anybody is objecting
you please inform me.

748
01:08:15,703 --> 01:08:18,406
If required I will
come to meet your father.

749
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:21,228
But my father is
not able to stand you?

750
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:24,341
In that case I will
go to meet your mother.

751
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:27,228
I don't have any mother.

752
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:29,985
I will go and meet
your father and mother.

753
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,483
I am going.

754
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:40,335
What happened?

755
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:43,200
Why did he go away when I
asked about his father and mother.

756
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:44,821
His father is not there.
- Mother?

757
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:49,978
And he doesn't know where is
his mother or what is she doing now?

758
01:08:50,058 --> 01:08:53,319
What? - He used to live
in a village called Dhupgunj.

759
01:08:55,157 --> 01:08:56,400
Dhupgunj?
- Yes.

760
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:00,897
Somebody killed his father
in front of his own eyes.

761
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:03,470
He came running to
the police station..

762
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:08,389
..and I went and arrested Amal from
his house red handed with the knife.

763
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:10,908
Then I took him to
the railway station..

764
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:14,659
..but I was not able to find you.

765
01:09:14,886 --> 01:09:21,102
I waited till late night
and some bad guys were after me.

766
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,075
I had beaten them and
brought her to the Ashram.

767
01:09:24,155 --> 01:09:25,470
Do you know her mother?

768
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,486
Yes I know.

769
01:09:26,735 --> 01:09:28,735
She had been with me in
the ashram for the last 8 years.

770
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:29,708
Where is she now?

771
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,416
Even after a long search
I was not able to find you.

772
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:39,298
I had brought him to me..

773
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:45,471
..and within 4 to 5 days
I started to love him so much that..

774
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:51,708
..one person came to me to collect the
information of your husband and son..

775
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:58,919
..but although I gave him
the news of your husband's death..

776
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:06,173
..I was not able to tell
him that Raju is with me.

777
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,296
I had confided the news of Raju.

778
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,555
If you were on that day...

779
01:10:13,783 --> 01:10:18,248
That day like your
mother's heart was crying..

780
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:23,080
..in the same way one
father's heart was also crying.

781
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:34,854
I had one son like him
and with 2 days fever he died.

782
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:47,309
I felt that my son
has come to me again.

783
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,487
So shamelessly..

784
01:10:55,082 --> 01:10:59,666
I kept him as an idol of my temple.

785
01:11:01,363 --> 01:11:07,849
If you want to take the idol from
my temple I would not object you.

786
01:11:09,893 --> 01:11:11,926
I had sent off that
person that day..

787
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:16,617
..but whatever painful
it might be for me..

788
01:11:18,076 --> 01:11:20,530
..I will not be
able to send you away.

789
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,724
You have no reason to fear..

790
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:27,957
..as where I would be putting up the
idol by taking it from your temple.

791
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:32,486
My temple has been
absolutely destroyed.

792
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:36,557
It is the wish of all mothers that..

793
01:11:36,637 --> 01:11:38,064
..whatever sufferings,
and hardships they bear..

794
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:42,994
...they still think that their
children should be safe and happy.

795
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:46,594
The way he is growing
up in your house..

796
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:50,302
..I will not be
able to do it myself.

797
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:53,534
Why will I spoil his future?

798
01:11:55,123 --> 01:11:56,983
I only request you..

799
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:03,177
..to make arrangements in such a
way that I can see him 2 times in a day.

800
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:17,761
Where did Sarama go leaving
behind her saree, vermilion?

801
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:22,442
Why don't you go and ask
Raju's father regarding this?

802
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:25,080
It can be so that he
might do something for you.

803
01:12:32,108 --> 01:12:33,180
Are you Nawab?

804
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:39,040
Yes, I am the person whom you
bluffed prior to 8 years from now?

805
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:40,417
You said...

806
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:42,158
I remember what I told you.

807
01:12:44,038 --> 01:12:47,584
But I am not bound
to tell you the reason.

808
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:52,016
If it were 2 days earlier I would
have brought Raju's mother to you.

809
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:54,406
If you were not telling me
the reason you would have told...

810
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:55,638
What do you do?

811
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,228
I have a orphanage out here.

812
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:01,487
I come here twice in a year.

813
01:13:02,806 --> 01:13:05,152
I bring up those who
don't have anybody to care.

814
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:08,406
What do you do apart from this?

815
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:11,313
Yes I do service in Delhi.

816
01:13:14,062 --> 01:13:15,489
I have the information that..

817
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,245
..you are a hoodlum as well.

818
01:13:19,716 --> 01:13:22,775
I don't know what is the definition
of hoodlum in police rule book..

819
01:13:24,332 --> 01:13:27,770
..but if somebody
does anything wrong..

820
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,159
the way you people fear and stay
in one corner in order to save..

821
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,742
..your job due to some politicians,
that I am unable to do.

822
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:40,245
If somebody does anything
wrong I protest and often beat them.

823
01:13:41,402 --> 01:13:42,796
If you tell this
as a hoodlum activity...

824
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:46,461
You don't forget that you
are speaking in front of an SP.

825
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:51,088
I am speaking with that SP..

826
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:53,975
..for whom I have beaten the
minister's son just few minutes back..

827
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,532
..when he was beating your son.

828
01:13:58,192 --> 01:14:00,646
Your son loves Ajit's daughter..

829
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:03,922
..and that is the reason
the ministers son was beating him.

830
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,052
I protested and had
beaten the minister's son.

831
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:14,149
If you say that this is a hoodlum
activity then I will surely accept it.

832
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:17,955
Are you not scared that
you have beaten minister's son?

833
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:22,647
You should be afraid
but why will I be afraid?

834
01:14:23,285 --> 01:14:26,798
I don't have any seat
to lose or get transferred.

835
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:31,047
I will not budge a
bit without my own wish.

836
01:14:31,242 --> 01:14:38,031
You have huge expenses
to take care of the orphans.

837
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:40,972
Where do get the money?

838
01:14:42,485 --> 01:14:44,528
You can easily go to
the income tax department

839
01:14:44,766 --> 01:14:46,420
..and search for my tax file.

840
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:49,469
If I say you earn in an illegal way?

841
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:53,080
I don't have the options
like you to earn in an illegal way.

842
01:14:53,253 --> 01:14:54,312
What do you mean?

843
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:59,505
Some of the police officers
have black and white money..

844
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:03,102
..they have their
own houses and cars..

845
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:08,227
..but the salary you
get from the government..

846
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:11,676
..you will not be
able to buy a tyre also.

847
01:15:12,476 --> 01:15:13,935
Where do you get this money from...

848
01:15:14,015 --> 01:15:17,135
Do you have any problem to tell
me from where do you get all this money?

849
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:20,854
Although I am not
bound to tell you..

850
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:24,464
..but still I am telling
you that its my father's money.

851
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:26,724
How big is the amount that..

852
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,913
..even after so much spending
you are not getting empty?

853
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:35,655
Do you know story about ocean?
- Ocean story?

854
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:39,071
It is like if you tell somebody..

855
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:44,574
..to take out water from
the ocean with a bucket.

856
01:15:45,968 --> 01:15:49,503
If you go after 30 years also you will
see that ocean is in the same position..

857
01:15:50,195 --> 01:15:52,260
..and the guy is still
taking out water from the ocean.

858
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:54,281
What were your father doing?

859
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,811
Have you heard the name
of Kumar Pratap Roy Chowdhury?

860
01:15:57,027 --> 01:15:59,828
Yes the landowner who used to act as
a tyrant by taking money from the poor.

861
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:02,746
I am the only son of him.

862
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,995
As a landowner the
kind of sin that..

863
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:11,924
..they have done by
taking money from the poor..

864
01:16:13,146 --> 01:16:14,973
..I am spending that
money among the poor.

865
01:16:15,913 --> 01:16:17,221
This is how I am trying
to reduce my sins.

866
01:16:20,151 --> 01:16:22,367
I have kept the saree and
ornaments of Sarama on the table..

867
01:16:22,972 --> 01:16:24,659
..please search for her.

868
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:26,951
Listen.

869
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:31,275
The way you are reducing the sin..

870
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:37,956
..I am also doing the same
thing starting today for the sin..

871
01:16:39,113 --> 01:16:40,583
..I had done 8 years ago.

872
01:16:41,946 --> 01:16:46,660
Raju's mother Sarama
is with me now in my house.

873
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,930
What?

874
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:42,164
What happened?

875
01:17:42,878 --> 01:17:46,294
Father have you changed the cook?

876
01:17:46,488 --> 01:17:47,255
Why?

877
01:17:47,335 --> 01:17:48,553
Tell me if you have or haven't.

878
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:51,244
Yes, why?

879
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:55,882
The taste of the food
is reminding me of my mother.

880
01:17:56,661 --> 01:18:00,012
I am having a feeling that
my mother is standing near me.

881
01:18:03,059 --> 01:18:03,957
Okay eat.

882
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:08,259
Trust me father whatever
I had liked to eat in my birthday..

883
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:11,048
..all are here in the table.

884
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:14,962
The same taste...

885
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:24,552
After you went out in the morning
a lady came to me who was very poor.

886
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,795
Lady?

887
01:18:28,129 --> 01:18:29,092
Was she my mother?

888
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:36,579
The lady's face is burnt.

889
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:39,610
That lady never showed her face..

890
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:42,637
..as she had burnt
her face in the childhood.

891
01:18:44,681 --> 01:18:49,139
If you have any doubt
you can go and see her.

892
01:18:49,816 --> 01:18:53,373
No, no then she is a different
lady but not my mother.

893
01:18:56,952 --> 01:18:59,752
My mother is very good looking.

894
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:02,551
Just like a goddess's idol!

895
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:07,037
She used to wear
a red bordered saree..

896
01:19:07,794 --> 01:19:11,005
..with red vermilion in her head
with a big red bindi on her forehead.

897
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:16,854
Today also I can see
the face of my mother.

898
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:23,912
Hey, eat now.

899
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:35,004
How come the taste of both
the cooked food be the same.

900
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,874
Why can't that be a possibility?

901
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:39,555
I think..
- What?

902
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:43,685
The one who came must
be known to my mother.

903
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:49,338
You eat and let me ask her
that whether she knows her or not.

904
01:19:52,365 --> 01:19:53,587
First you eat and then go.

905
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,587
You eat, I am coming.

906
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:04,397
I am Raju the son of SP.

907
01:20:05,229 --> 01:20:08,829
As you are new
I came to you to chat.

908
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:14,418
Have you cooked the entire
food by yourself today?

909
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:17,618
You know the taste of the food
cooked by my mother was the same.

910
01:20:17,953 --> 01:20:22,245
So the taste of your
food reminded me of my mother.

911
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:27,661
Prior to 8 years from
now I lost my mother.

912
01:20:29,012 --> 01:20:32,083
I searched a lot
but I did not find her.

913
01:20:32,883 --> 01:20:35,304
Do you know my mother?

914
01:20:36,115 --> 01:20:38,580
My mother's name is Sarama.

915
01:20:39,338 --> 01:20:41,976
I have a request that
please never leave me..

916
01:20:44,343 --> 01:20:48,148
..promise me that you
will never leave this house.

917
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:55,087
..when I eat your cooked
food it reminds me of my mother.

918
01:20:56,287 --> 01:21:00,955
My father told me that you
have come here due to poverty..

919
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:04,969
He will pay you whatever he can..

920
01:21:05,391 --> 01:21:07,392
..but if it is not up to
your expectation..

921
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:09,877
..also please do not go
away from here.

922
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:16,266
My father gives me 10
rupees everyday for tiffin..

923
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:19,325
..I will give that to you as well.

924
01:21:20,504 --> 01:21:21,747
My father will not know about it.

925
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:28,341
I had taken 50 rupees from
my father in order to go to picnic..

926
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,314
..i won't go on the picnic.

927
01:21:32,265 --> 01:21:33,562
..but I will give that to you.

928
01:21:36,136 --> 01:21:37,098
It's here on the shelf.

929
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:51,001
I wanted to cringe by touching
your legs like my mother..

930
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:58,580
..but father told me that
you would not show your burnt face..

931
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:06,936
..so I will cringe from a distance.

932
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,429
Are you not feeling sleepy?

933
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:57,013
You know father today
I am thinking of my mother.

934
01:22:59,576 --> 01:23:06,268
I don't know why my mother has
not looked for me over the years.

935
01:23:08,615 --> 01:23:10,215
Surely she would be looking for you.

936
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,940
Mother cannot stay like that
without looking for her child.

937
01:23:13,578 --> 01:23:18,670
You are such a big police officer,
can't you fetch my mother for me?

938
01:23:18,854 --> 01:23:20,421
Tell me can't you do that.

939
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,859
Are you not feeling good with me?

940
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:25,123
Am I...

941
01:23:25,203 --> 01:23:28,366
No, no you have given me everything..

942
01:23:29,361 --> 01:23:36,745
..but what happened
to me today I don't know.

943
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:44,486
I am getting the scent of
my mother in this entire house.

944
01:23:46,442 --> 01:23:52,323
I am feeling that my
mother is staying near to me.

945
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:58,843
That is wrong notion of yours.

946
01:24:00,323 --> 01:24:03,685
Go to sleep.

947
01:24:03,765 --> 01:24:05,058
Its very late in the night now.

948
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,156
I am comforting you by
putting my hands on your head.

949
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:17,739
You know father when
I was not feeling sleepy..

950
01:24:18,874 --> 01:24:23,307
..my mother used to give me comfort
by brushing my hair with her fingers..

951
01:24:23,577 --> 01:24:26,247
Okay.
- ..and singing a lullaby.

952
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:32,357
And I didn't even know
when I used to fall asleep.

953
01:24:32,885 --> 01:24:36,917
I can hear it even now clearly.

954
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,529
The lullaby mother
used to sing..

955
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:19,446
"Let the sleep come down
to the eyes of my loved one."

956
01:25:20,602 --> 01:25:29,306
"Let the sleep come down
to the eyes of my loved one."

957
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:40,505
"My love one is awake
and the night is getting over."

958
01:25:40,585 --> 01:25:49,943
"Let the sleep come down
to the eyes of my loved one."

959
01:26:11,339 --> 01:26:13,166
"Where does this sleep stay?"

960
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:24,421
"These sleep stay in an unknown
world in the house of the fairies.."

961
01:26:25,502 --> 01:26:40,096
"..and these fairies
make the sleep in that room."

962
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:52,129
"These sleep stay in an unknown
world in the house of the fairies.."

963
01:26:52,821 --> 01:27:02,464
"..and these fairies
make the sleep in that room."

964
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:11,947
"Then the queen tells
to give the sleep.."

965
01:27:12,802 --> 01:27:22,441
"..to the eyes of my loved
one as the night is passing by."

966
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:32,518
"Let the sleep come down
to the eyes of my loved one."

967
01:27:57,512 --> 01:28:06,918
"The sleeps come
and sits on the eyes.."

968
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:20,573
"..and then they smile and
tell you in your ears to sleep."

969
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:33,473
"The sleeps come
and sits on the eyes.."

970
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:43,991
"..and then they smile and
tell you in your ears to sleep."

971
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:53,397
"Then everybody gets to
sleep by closing their eyes."

972
01:28:54,554 --> 01:29:04,154
"My love one is awake
and the night is getting over."

973
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:14,446
"Let the sleep come down
to the eyes of my loved one."

974
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:28,802
Now try to sleep.

975
01:29:29,019 --> 01:29:30,521
What will you try to do?

976
01:29:36,781 --> 01:29:39,235
Sarama after such a long
time has got his son back..

977
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,451
..so will she come here now.

978
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:42,694
I don't think so..

979
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:49,300
If Sarama doesn't come
we cannot save Bikram.

980
01:29:50,035 --> 01:29:55,873
Whenever he is opening his eyes
he is calling by the name of mother.

981
01:29:56,295 --> 01:29:58,987
Okay, let me go there once tomorrow.

982
01:29:59,067 --> 01:29:59,733
Where will you go?

983
01:29:59,992 --> 01:30:04,013
I am thinking of going
back to the ashram.

984
01:30:05,938 --> 01:30:08,522
Leaving your son here...

985
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,614
When I know that he is happy..

986
01:30:12,068 --> 01:30:13,365
..and keeping well here.

987
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:15,203
Then I don't have any problem.

988
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:19,733
I will come often to see him.

989
01:30:20,111 --> 01:30:20,706
But..

990
01:30:20,911 --> 01:30:25,949
Moreover how long will
I conceal my face from my son?

991
01:30:28,468 --> 01:30:35,084
When he was speaking about
me at my back I was getting weak.

992
01:30:36,328 --> 01:30:40,620
I was feeling I will
not be able to hold myself.

993
01:30:41,766 --> 01:30:44,060
I will run and take him to my chest.

994
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:45,853
You should have done that.

995
01:30:47,097 --> 01:30:50,675
This could have satisfied me..

996
01:30:51,367 --> 01:30:55,151
..but on the other hand this could
have given him lot of problems.

997
01:30:56,859 --> 01:31:02,253
This would have been
unbearable for him.

998
01:31:03,994 --> 01:31:08,210
You are your mother
and you know what to do...

999
01:31:10,848 --> 01:31:11,821
Is doctor there?

1000
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:13,031
Doctor has gone away.

1001
01:31:13,111 --> 01:31:14,350
Doctor has gone away.

1002
01:31:15,442 --> 01:31:17,788
Where has he gone by making
so many patients waiting for him?

1003
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:19,160
Next month there is election..

1004
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,187
..so he had gone there for
the meeting in the nearby ground.

1005
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:27,269
Like the way one donates for the
people and people do not know him..

1006
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,712
..in the similar way the worker..

1007
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:33,431
..who works for the country
nobody knows him as well.

1008
01:31:33,511 --> 01:31:35,658
One of them is Mr. Ajit.

1009
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:38,069
Whatever he has done
for you for the last 5 years..

1010
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:39,529
..you were not able to know as well.

1011
01:31:39,789 --> 01:31:43,724
For the last 5 years
the kind of problems..

1012
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:47,583
..that you are facing
in terms of kerosene..

1013
01:31:47,663 --> 01:31:49,217
..and electricity this
will be put an end by him.

1014
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:57,173
Now he has changed his mind
to change his symbol to bucket.

1015
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:59,984
He will give you
electricity by bucket.

1016
01:32:00,064 --> 01:32:01,908
Stupid, can anyone
give electricity by bucket?

1017
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:07,832
Sorry he will provide
you kerosene by buckets..

1018
01:32:07,912 --> 01:32:10,611
..to each of the
houses of the village.

1019
01:32:10,988 --> 01:32:14,730
Now all of you will be in lights.

1020
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:25,671
Tell keep going,
why did you stop?

1021
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:29,065
We will give you everything rice,
pulses...

1022
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:35,757
We will give you everything rice,
pulses...

1023
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:37,623
Come on.
- Where?

1024
01:32:37,904 --> 01:32:38,899
All your patients are
waiting in your chamber..

1025
01:32:38,979 --> 01:32:39,883
..and here you are giving lectures.

1026
01:32:40,066 --> 01:32:41,764
You are not able to cater
to 15 patients of yours..

1027
01:32:41,844 --> 01:32:43,364
..then how can you serve
your country. Come on.

1028
01:32:43,444 --> 01:32:44,088
I will not go.

1029
01:32:44,168 --> 01:32:45,137
You will have to go.

1030
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:50,736
Mother, mother.

1031
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:02,175
Mother! Where is my mother?

1032
01:33:03,115 --> 01:33:06,077
You take care of Piklu,
I am going to Sarama.

1033
01:33:06,715 --> 01:33:08,607
Mother, mother.

1034
01:33:09,213 --> 01:33:11,202
Mother, mother.

1035
01:33:38,164 --> 01:33:39,915
Mother.

1036
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,332
Listen. - Yes.
- Is your duty over? - Yes.

1037
01:33:52,099 --> 01:33:53,126
Is SP there in the house?

1038
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:54,899
He has just got out for duty.

1039
01:33:55,825 --> 01:33:56,985
What about that lady
who came yesterday?

1040
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:58,941
She just few minutes back
had gone away by leaving the house.

1041
01:34:05,071 --> 01:34:06,153
There is no hope.

1042
01:34:10,175 --> 01:34:11,894
Just you will have
to wait for some time.

1043
01:34:12,532 --> 01:34:14,175
We need to wait for the sunset.

1044
01:34:44,001 --> 01:34:47,082
If Sarama could have come once.

1045
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:51,806
The one who left the
house will never come back.

1046
01:35:14,532 --> 01:35:16,627
Why are you all crying?

1047
01:35:18,168 --> 01:35:20,344
Can't you see he is smiling.

1048
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:35,843
"When you see sadness then you
should tell by going to that place.."

1049
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:48,924
"..if you want to live
with a smile by wiping off tears."

1050
01:35:50,101 --> 01:36:01,236
"You should take the
child by your side.."

1051
01:36:02,844 --> 01:36:14,479
"..and tell him to work for
the mass by loving the country."

1052
01:36:15,452 --> 01:36:26,871
"You are my life and
you are my everything."

1053
01:36:28,209 --> 01:36:36,654
"When my heart would stop
that would be the end of all noises."

1054
01:36:36,734 --> 01:36:38,222
Piklu.

1055
01:36:38,681 --> 01:36:39,790
Piklu.

1056
01:36:40,627 --> 01:36:42,046
Piklu.

1057
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,330
You have left me by
showing your haughtiness..

1058
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:56,262
..but I have left my
own son and came to you.

1059
01:36:57,708 --> 01:37:03,951
Speak Piklu please look at me.

1060
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:07,357
Piklu.

1061
01:37:09,263 --> 01:37:10,938
Piklu.

1062
01:38:02,555 --> 01:38:04,706
Will it be possible
to bring Raju here?

1063
01:38:09,449 --> 01:38:11,152
Go and bring her.

1064
01:38:16,301 --> 01:38:22,680
How will I get money
for continuing his studies?

1065
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,547
Why are you thinking
of the money when I am here?

1066
01:38:27,346 --> 01:38:31,467
Moreover you are staying in this
orphanage for the last 8 years..

1067
01:38:31,765 --> 01:38:32,940
..for which if I give you...

1068
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:39,778
You also like Raju
is trying to buy me?

1069
01:38:42,278 --> 01:38:52,102
I serve them and love them
like a mother not for money.

1070
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:56,467
That I know well but why
are you taking so much pain in...

1071
01:38:56,547 --> 01:39:01,413
I don't want to make
SP sad by bringing him to me.

1072
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:05,440
Can you promise me one thing?

1073
01:39:05,891 --> 01:39:10,553
Tell me
- Take me once to the school..

1074
01:39:11,432 --> 01:39:16,955
..wherein I can see Raju
which would be make me happy.

1075
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,432
My dear Raju.

1076
01:39:31,512 --> 01:39:34,878
I am leaving behind
your money and my blessings.

1077
01:39:38,274 --> 01:39:41,230
Like the way the food that I cook
makes you remember your mother..

1078
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:44,963
..in the same way it
makes me remember my son.

1079
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:55,671
If I stay in that house both
of us will be sad so I am leaving.

1080
01:39:56,212 --> 01:39:57,918
With love...

1081
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:02,242
Did you not sleep?

1082
01:40:11,194 --> 01:40:12,647
If she had left her address?

1083
01:40:14,082 --> 01:40:15,400
What would you have done?

1084
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:18,322
At least I would have
asked for mercy.

1085
01:40:19,876 --> 01:40:21,988
You don't have to ask for mercy.

1086
01:40:22,748 --> 01:40:24,505
She has already forgiven you.

1087
01:40:25,772 --> 01:40:27,461
That is the reason she
has blessed you via letter.

1088
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:31,124
She does not know to what
extent I have made her feel low.

1089
01:40:31,502 --> 01:40:33,462
They belong to the clan of mothers

1090
01:40:34,705 --> 01:40:38,705
..so you cannot belittle
them by thinking low about them.

1091
01:41:10,976 --> 01:41:13,976
I am not able to see Raju.

1092
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:18,787
I think I can find
him in another place.

1093
01:41:35,016 --> 01:41:36,963
Do you know the news of Raju?

1094
01:41:37,043 --> 01:41:38,137
How will he come?

1095
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,192
He is very sick.

1096
01:41:40,883 --> 01:41:41,937
Sick...

1097
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:43,004
What happened?

1098
01:41:43,248 --> 01:41:46,531
A lady cook came to
his house 2 days earlier.

1099
01:41:47,056 --> 01:41:50,313
Her food tasted like
his mother's cooking. So..

1100
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,178
He had collected his
10 rupees tiffin cost..

1101
01:41:54,258 --> 01:41:58,204
After not having anything
for the whole day..

1102
01:41:58,284 --> 01:42:03,596
..and wanted to give it
to her but she left the house.

1103
01:42:04,353 --> 01:42:06,582
He did not eat the
entire day yesterday.

1104
01:42:06,948 --> 01:42:08,475
Last night he did
not get the food from..

1105
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:09,867
..that lady for
which he did not eat.

1106
01:42:10,245 --> 01:42:12,651
If he does like this it
is obvious that he will fall sick.

1107
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,597
Nawab brother did
you find his mother?

1108
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:18,192
Find her...

1109
01:42:18,502 --> 01:42:19,786
Meaning...

1110
01:42:21,152 --> 01:42:24,327
I think if he gets his mother back..

1111
01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:28,462
..that lady has reminded
him of his mother.

1112
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:33,084
I am thinking why that lady came..

1113
01:42:33,449 --> 01:42:36,274
..and why did she
leave by making him sick.

1114
01:42:36,558 --> 01:42:38,166
Its sure that she
does not have any kids.

1115
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:47,099
Lets see whether I
can find her mother or not?

1116
01:42:47,179 --> 01:42:52,746
Yes its late already and
now he will not be willing to eat.

1117
01:43:15,059 --> 01:43:16,478
See the stones.

1118
01:43:17,964 --> 01:43:19,410
What happened?

1119
01:43:22,775 --> 01:43:25,789
From where did you
get this poor quality rice?

1120
01:43:25,869 --> 01:43:26,748
From ration.

1121
01:43:26,828 --> 01:43:27,586
What?

1122
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:29,221
From ration.

1123
01:43:30,613 --> 01:43:33,086
The ration shops are not expected
to give such poor quality rice.

1124
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:35,126
Leave aside humans the
animals will also not eat it.

1125
01:43:35,206 --> 01:43:39,776
They give us this quality regularly
and we clean them up accordingly.

1126
01:43:39,856 --> 01:43:43,411
Now let me see who is
thinking me as animal whether..

1127
01:43:44,086 --> 01:43:47,018
..the govt or the
owner of the ration shop.

1128
01:43:48,733 --> 01:43:50,150
If the owner has given us..

1129
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,355
..this bad quality rice instead
of the good quality rice..

1130
01:43:53,003 --> 01:43:56,395
..then I will also take
him to roads like an animal.

1131
01:44:21,017 --> 01:44:22,315
Oh God!

1132
01:44:30,354 --> 01:44:32,070
You have hidden the good
rice in the store room..

1133
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,705
..and you are giving
the filthy rice to the people.

1134
01:44:34,908 --> 01:44:36,502
Do you find the people
of the country to be animals?

1135
01:44:36,582 --> 01:44:37,921
No, not really.. I mean...

1136
01:44:38,947 --> 01:44:41,332
Tomorrow make sure you exchange
every single one of..

1137
01:44:41,412 --> 01:44:44,677
..this sac with the bad
rice in the grocery store.

1138
01:44:45,149 --> 01:44:47,041
If you don't replace them..

1139
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:48,865
..then I will put the same in you.

1140
01:44:48,945 --> 01:44:49,798
What happened to you?

1141
01:44:49,878 --> 01:44:53,433
You told me to give you 10
sacks of good rice to your house..

1142
01:44:53,677 --> 01:44:55,400
..and sell the filthy rice to the people..

1143
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,852
..by keeping the good rice
in your storeroom.

1144
01:44:57,055 --> 01:44:58,731
Tell me what happened after that.

1145
01:44:58,811 --> 01:45:05,056
For this Nawab had pulled me through
the market to the storeroom..

1146
01:45:05,136 --> 01:45:08,177
..and he would have
pierced my belly.

1147
01:45:08,257 --> 01:45:09,501
You go and let me see.

1148
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:11,325
Now I know what is your capability?

1149
01:45:11,582 --> 01:45:13,569
You are a leader,
a leader of the country.

1150
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:16,109
Nawab had beaten your
son in front of everybody..

1151
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:18,704
..for which you can't do anything
then what will you do for me.

1152
01:45:18,784 --> 01:45:20,596
During the vote I have
given so many false votes..

1153
01:45:20,947 --> 01:45:25,663
..and charged bombs and you said that
nobody would be able to do anything.

1154
01:45:25,743 --> 01:45:28,258
How will I come to
know that all of a sudden..

1155
01:45:28,338 --> 01:45:29,568
..how come the police
have become so honest?

1156
01:45:29,648 --> 01:45:32,069
Sir you call SP sir.

1157
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:33,906
If you tell him he
will surely take action.

1158
01:45:33,986 --> 01:45:36,758
If it costs 10 to
20k then I will give it.

1159
01:45:45,311 --> 01:45:46,230
Hello.

1160
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:47,906
Ajit Choudhury speaking.

1161
01:45:49,366 --> 01:45:50,690
Is SP sir there?

1162
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,190
What can I do for you?

1163
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:55,757
You will have to arrest Nawab
now and put him to jail by today.

1164
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:57,676
Arrest?

1165
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:01,176
But I have told my
officers not to arrest him.

1166
01:46:02,027 --> 01:46:09,447
I am thinking of implementing a law
which would help not to arrest anybody.

1167
01:46:09,527 --> 01:46:10,326
What?

1168
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:11,650
Criminals will not get arrested.

1169
01:46:11,839 --> 01:46:13,542
This was the law..

1170
01:46:13,622 --> 01:46:21,718
..but you ministers always stop us from
arresting criminals by saying that..

1171
01:46:22,015 --> 01:46:23,961
..he is in our party so leave him.

1172
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,056
Otherwise my party members would show
protest in front of your police station.

1173
01:46:29,110 --> 01:46:29,759
But that doesn't mean...

1174
01:46:29,839 --> 01:46:33,759
When we arrest a thief leaders
say that they are in their party.

1175
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:36,947
If we arrest a rapist then
its a different thing for..

1176
01:46:37,636 --> 01:46:40,082
..which the expenses get high..

1177
01:46:40,162 --> 01:46:43,380
..for petrol of the govt and
phone bills of the leaders.

1178
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:46,543
This is the reason
we decided that....

1179
01:46:46,623 --> 01:46:50,245
Whatever you decided,
but arrest Nawab.

1180
01:46:50,488 --> 01:46:52,812
So you are telling me
to start arresting again.

1181
01:46:53,069 --> 01:46:56,029
Whoever minister calls you even me..

1182
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:58,286
..if you receive any calls
then don't listen to them.

1183
01:46:58,826 --> 01:47:00,610
So lets go with you.

1184
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:03,192
Don't you know the
Orphanage of Nawab?

1185
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:04,988
That I will find it out.

1186
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:08,070
But before that I
need to go to your house.

1187
01:47:08,516 --> 01:47:09,313
My house.
- Yes.

1188
01:47:10,151 --> 01:47:13,692
Why?
- Look if I want to arrest somebody..

1189
01:47:13,935 --> 01:47:18,624
..then we should start with the one
who has the maximum amount of diaries.

1190
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:23,638
Tell me whether your son is at
home or in front of a girls school.

1191
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:24,747
What?

1192
01:47:24,827 --> 01:47:26,625
I will take the officers
from the police station..

1193
01:47:26,909 --> 01:47:28,679
..and put your son behind the bars.

1194
01:47:29,612 --> 01:47:31,369
You have decide his name only.

1195
01:47:31,855 --> 01:47:33,977
You will complain against me, right?

1196
01:47:35,192 --> 01:47:41,192
I will twist the knee point
of your son within the time..

1197
01:47:42,786 --> 01:47:45,448
..it will take for your
complaint to go to the respective.

1198
01:47:45,528 --> 01:47:47,178
Okay, lets see.

1199
01:47:50,003 --> 01:47:51,205
Please see to it.

1200
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:53,894
If your son is not
able to rectify himself..

1201
01:47:54,462 --> 01:47:57,003
..then I can go to your
house at any point of time.

1202
01:47:57,205 --> 01:48:02,029
Yes, you will come not to
arrest my son but to save your job.

1203
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:44,679
Tell me who is the
person who came here today?

1204
01:48:46,372 --> 01:48:49,355
He is a minister whose
name is Ajit Choudhury.

1205
01:48:50,248 --> 01:48:57,356
"My father is a minister
who takes care of Bengal.."

1206
01:48:57,436 --> 01:49:04,464
"..and I get to see the
tantrums of my father at home."

1207
01:49:04,765 --> 01:49:08,897
"Like father like son both
both are disciples of each other."

1208
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:19,532
Wait!

1209
01:49:24,776 --> 01:49:32,141
You were asking me questions
so now I will ask you a question.

1210
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:34,209
Who is this man?

1211
01:49:34,736 --> 01:49:37,141
You only said it.

1212
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:39,344
That everybody knows..

1213
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:41,456
..but apart from this there is..

1214
01:49:41,536 --> 01:49:43,709
..another identification of
this guy which you know.

1215
01:49:43,789 --> 01:49:44,966
So whats that?

1216
01:49:46,587 --> 01:49:52,655
I have a girl friend named Papiya
and he is the father of Papiya.

1217
01:49:52,735 --> 01:49:57,425
Wait, whose father is he
that I am not interested to know.

1218
01:49:57,993 --> 01:49:59,520
Tell me what I want to know.

1219
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,277
How will I know?

1220
01:50:01,857 --> 01:50:14,020
Raju I joined as a
Constable and now I am a SP.

1221
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,331
You will not be able
to escape from me.

1222
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:21,466
I said tell me, tell me, tell me.

1223
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:24,304
I have already told you father.

1224
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,316
You have not come to me without any
reason in this sick condition of yours..

1225
01:50:27,396 --> 01:50:29,600
..to know about the person.

1226
01:50:29,924 --> 01:50:33,087
You are trying to hide
things from me but why?

1227
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:39,182
Look straight to
my eyes and tell me..

1228
01:50:40,966 --> 01:50:43,128
..what is the other introduction
that your know about him?

1229
01:50:45,614 --> 01:50:46,803
Come on tell me.

1230
01:50:47,033 --> 01:50:55,263
He is the person who had
instructed to kill my father.

1231
01:50:55,343 --> 01:50:56,506
You scoundrel.

1232
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:03,588
How can you think of
marrying his daughter..

1233
01:51:03,668 --> 01:51:08,952
..who had instructed
to kill your father.

1234
01:51:09,736 --> 01:51:12,925
I say tell me, don't remain quiet.

1235
01:51:13,343 --> 01:51:20,142
I will go out now and you don't
get out of the house till I come.

1236
01:51:23,371 --> 01:51:24,398
Come, come.

1237
01:51:24,723 --> 01:51:26,196
I knew you would come.

1238
01:51:27,061 --> 01:51:31,682
You are clever but I think
I am more clever than you..

1239
01:51:32,115 --> 01:51:35,128
..for which I am the minister
and you are the police officer.

1240
01:51:36,276 --> 01:51:40,195
After I came back home I had spoken with
your bosses wherein I found out that..

1241
01:51:40,275 --> 01:51:44,316
You have quite a reputation of being
a just officer in your department.

1242
01:51:45,113 --> 01:51:47,965
..in your duty you
never leave anyone.

1243
01:51:48,235 --> 01:51:49,722
You have correctly heard it.

1244
01:51:49,951 --> 01:51:53,451
Now you will get
the proof red handed.

1245
01:51:53,668 --> 01:51:56,776
I already said that
I am more clever than you.

1246
01:51:58,614 --> 01:52:00,087
Please give it to him.

1247
01:52:03,411 --> 01:52:04,870
Read it.

1248
01:52:14,506 --> 01:52:18,722
I see that this is an advance bail
of your son but what about your bail?

1249
01:52:18,952 --> 01:52:19,708
My bail?

1250
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:23,006
I have not come here to arrest
a street loafer like your son..

1251
01:52:23,587 --> 01:52:25,843
..by wasting the petrol of the govt.

1252
01:52:26,343 --> 01:52:29,505
That will be taken care by
the local police station officers.

1253
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:31,910
I have come here to arrest you.

1254
01:52:32,113 --> 01:52:33,532
You have come to arrest me.

1255
01:52:33,612 --> 01:52:36,167
Yes come with me.

1256
01:52:36,774 --> 01:52:38,098
May I know the crime
that I have done.

1257
01:52:38,178 --> 01:52:39,085
Yes sure.

1258
01:52:39,639 --> 01:52:46,098
Around 8 years prior from
now you have killed Animesh Mondol..

1259
01:52:46,693 --> 01:52:49,395
..by Amal under your instructions.

1260
01:52:50,409 --> 01:52:55,314
Amal has died so did you get the
information from Amal via plan chat?

1261
01:52:58,437 --> 01:52:59,923
Yes Amal has died..

1262
01:53:00,761 --> 01:53:02,409
..but it's quite unfortunate for you..

1263
01:53:02,489 --> 01:53:04,477
..that the son of Animesh
Mondol is still alive.

1264
01:53:05,464 --> 01:53:07,410
He knows everything as the entire
incident happened in front his eyes.

1265
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:11,816
After the death of Animesh Mondol..

1266
01:53:12,168 --> 01:53:15,979
..his son is with me
and he recognized you today.

1267
01:53:18,898 --> 01:53:20,033
Come on.

1268
01:53:20,113 --> 01:53:23,925
Yes but first you need to
bring that lad in front of me..

1269
01:53:24,587 --> 01:53:27,911
..and if he tells
in front of others that..

1270
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:31,113
..his father was killed on
my instructions..

1271
01:53:31,193 --> 01:53:32,641
..you can surely arrest me.

1272
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:37,074
Okay I am coming along with him.

1273
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:56,803
Brother speaking.

1274
01:54:39,167 --> 01:54:41,897
Hey! - Yes? - Why have you
stopped the bus like this?

1275
01:54:41,977 --> 01:54:45,045
The gear has gone bad sir.
- Repair it fast. Hurry up.

1276
01:54:50,531 --> 01:54:53,045
Hey! What happened to your vehicle?

1277
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:56,180
The vehicle broke down suddenly sir.
- Suddenly! Hurry up!

1278
01:55:37,398 --> 01:55:43,358
Nawab brother!

1279
01:55:52,264 --> 01:55:54,264
Nawab brother, you go other road.

1280
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,561
My father has blocked the road.

1281
01:57:30,281 --> 01:57:31,686
Raju?

1282
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:55,080
Raju?

1283
01:59:55,728 --> 01:59:57,147
How did you end up like this?

1284
01:59:57,227 --> 02:00:00,026
Some hoodlums came
and had beaten me up.

1285
02:00:00,106 --> 02:00:01,282
Where is, Raju?

1286
02:00:01,362 --> 02:00:02,905
Raju is inside.

1287
02:00:07,770 --> 02:00:10,026
Raju. Raju.

1288
02:00:13,729 --> 02:00:16,067
Raju. Raju.

1289
02:00:17,283 --> 02:00:18,283
Raju. Raju.

1290
02:00:20,134 --> 02:00:22,175
Father! Father!

1291
02:00:24,567 --> 02:00:25,905
I think you are not hurt.
- No.

1292
02:00:26,202 --> 02:00:28,134
When the hoodlums
were trying to beat me..

1293
02:00:28,405 --> 02:00:30,067
..then a lady came
running towards me.

1294
02:00:31,229 --> 02:00:32,256
A lady.

1295
02:00:33,729 --> 02:00:34,635
Did you see her?

1296
02:00:34,715 --> 02:00:38,393
When they were about to shoot
me that lady pushed me away..

1297
02:00:38,473 --> 02:00:42,541
..and she got the bullet on
her back and she fell on her face.

1298
02:00:42,621 --> 02:00:43,663
After that?

1299
02:00:43,743 --> 02:00:46,542
Yes Nawab brother also came
and he took her and went away.

1300
02:00:47,822 --> 02:00:49,087
Surely she had gone to the hospital.

1301
02:00:57,931 --> 02:00:59,985
Come lets go to the hospital.

1302
02:01:15,867 --> 02:01:19,510
My mother!
- Raju!

1303
02:01:41,966 --> 02:01:43,782
Why did you not tell me earlier?

1304
02:01:45,274 --> 02:01:50,032
I that case I would have
not let the bullet hit my mother.

1305
02:01:55,675 --> 02:01:57,923
How much time will it
take to do the operation?

1306
02:01:59,588 --> 02:02:02,864
It's a major surgery.
It's going to take time.

1307
02:02:05,101 --> 02:02:06,247
It will take around 2 hours.

1308
02:02:08,398 --> 02:02:09,501
Will you stay here now?

1309
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:10,290
Yes.

1310
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:11,328
Okay, I am coming.

1311
02:02:11,987 --> 02:02:12,733
Where are you going?

1312
02:02:13,955 --> 02:02:18,042
I will have to do a major operation
and that would hardly take half an hour.

1313
02:02:18,733 --> 02:02:19,652
Nawab.

1314
02:02:22,056 --> 02:02:23,392
I know where you are going.

1315
02:02:23,472 --> 02:02:25,014
Don't take laws in your hands.

1316
02:02:28,138 --> 02:02:30,030
You had laws in your
hands all this time..

1317
02:02:30,754 --> 02:02:31,933
..but what have you done with it?

1318
02:02:32,572 --> 02:02:34,343
In a country wherein the hoodlums
get into the house and shoot..

1319
02:02:34,423 --> 02:02:36,516
..do you think that we
have laws in a country like this?

1320
02:02:37,295 --> 02:02:39,144
Tell me.

1321
02:02:40,971 --> 02:02:42,571
I am telling you not to go.

1322
02:02:42,852 --> 02:02:44,560
I will take care.

1323
02:02:45,618 --> 02:02:49,857
If you wish also you will
not be able to do anything..

1324
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:55,846
..till the time you are
wearing this police uniform.

1325
02:02:55,926 --> 02:02:58,646
Listen to me.
- No, I will not listen to anything.

1326
02:02:58,959 --> 02:03:01,597
I will get the minister here.

1327
02:03:01,975 --> 02:03:04,872
If something happens with Sarama..

1328
02:03:05,348 --> 02:03:08,007
And the children in my
orphanage become orphans again..

1329
02:03:08,418 --> 02:03:10,364
..then I would book a bed
for the minister in this hospital..

1330
02:03:11,023 --> 02:03:12,580
..and I would do
the operation of him.

1331
02:03:13,348 --> 02:03:19,056
Nawab wait and don't go.

1332
02:03:22,094 --> 02:03:30,580
With law, you could have tried, You
can't stop me with this pistol of yours.

1333
02:03:33,003 --> 02:03:33,986
Stop!

1334
02:03:56,289 --> 02:03:57,143
Hello.

1335
02:04:26,508 --> 02:04:27,675
Come.

1336
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:31,178
Come.

1337
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:36,216
And take the pad with you.

1338
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:37,545
Pad?

1339
02:04:40,709 --> 02:04:42,561
Here. Take it.
- Come on.

1340
02:04:45,534 --> 02:04:46,993
Please leave him.

1341
02:04:51,836 --> 02:04:54,852
What? What kind of cruelty is this?

1342
02:05:11,631 --> 02:05:14,052
You had killed Animesh
Mondol by giving instructions..

1343
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:16,128
..and for this you
wanted proof from SP.

1344
02:05:17,058 --> 02:05:20,798
You have killed so
you have to give the proof.

1345
02:05:20,878 --> 02:05:23,318
Please let me go.

1346
02:05:24,139 --> 02:05:26,031
I will tell the court everything.

1347
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:28,020
I am giving you my word.
- You are giving your word.

1348
02:05:29,406 --> 02:05:33,458
Whatever promises
you make to the public..

1349
02:05:33,911 --> 02:05:35,684
..you forget it after coming home..

1350
02:05:36,031 --> 02:05:38,280
..so you will not remember
the promises you would make to me.

1351
02:05:46,692 --> 02:05:49,837
Now write it in your
own pad with your own hands..

1352
02:05:50,226 --> 02:05:52,183
..that you have not
only killed Animesh Mondol.

1353
02:05:52,691 --> 02:05:56,075
..you had also tried to kill his
son by sending some gunmen to his house.

1354
02:05:56,155 --> 02:05:57,362
Now write.

1355
02:06:01,329 --> 02:06:02,172
Wait.

1356
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,538
Wait.

1357
02:06:06,086 --> 02:06:08,324
Beware, don't touch the children.

1358
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:11,307
I won't write!
- You will have to write minister.

1359
02:06:17,437 --> 02:06:19,271
The hands that you have used to write..

1360
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:22,227
..all bluffs from your rise
of a union leader..

1361
02:06:23,405 --> 02:06:25,924
..to a minister will be
needed to write 2 true things.

1362
02:06:26,508 --> 02:06:27,978
You will write.
- I will not write.

1363
02:06:29,762 --> 02:06:31,016
Do not be stubborn.

1364
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:34,552
If you don't write I will
remove your hands from your body.

1365
02:06:35,244 --> 02:06:37,568
Write.
- No.

1366
02:06:37,648 --> 02:06:38,908
I am telling you to write.
- No.

1367
02:06:42,811 --> 02:06:44,271
Write, write.

1368
02:06:49,395 --> 02:06:50,802
Write it .

1369
02:06:51,213 --> 02:06:55,807
If you write it the court would give
you an imprisonment of 7 to 8 years..

1370
02:06:56,359 --> 02:06:57,781
..but if you don't write you will be..

1371
02:06:57,861 --> 02:07:00,324
..getting death penalty
from Nawab's court. Write it.

1372
02:07:01,808 --> 02:07:02,716
So you will not write?

1373
02:07:02,796 --> 02:07:03,429
No.

1374
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:07,116
So you will not write?

1375
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:11,472
Will you write?

1376
02:07:11,552 --> 02:07:12,413
Yes, I will write

1377
02:07:12,493 --> 02:07:13,310
Will you write?

1378
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:15,105
Yes I will write.

1379
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:17,980
Come, come.

1380
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:21,299
Here is the proof.

1381
02:07:22,402 --> 02:07:23,396
Lets go.

1382
02:07:25,915 --> 02:07:27,202
You go to the hospital by taking..

1383
02:07:27,282 --> 02:07:28,672
..the children as lot of blood
would be required.

1384
02:07:29,029 --> 02:07:31,158
Okay lets go.

1385
02:07:40,954 --> 02:07:44,435
The blood group of son
and mother are not matching.

1386
02:07:49,213 --> 02:07:50,153
Not matching.

1387
02:07:56,846 --> 02:07:57,689
Doctor.

1388
02:07:59,386 --> 02:08:00,921
Her blood group is
not matching with one son.

1389
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:05,505
Here are so many children of her,
one of them would surely match with her.

1390
02:08:09,224 --> 02:08:12,165
Okay, please send them one by one.

1391
02:08:13,549 --> 02:08:15,797
Let's see which of them would
match the group of his mother.

1392
02:09:06,003 --> 02:09:09,906
Your mother is now absolutely cure
and has gone back to the orphanage.

1393
02:09:10,305 --> 02:09:11,981
You will not bring her to me.

1394
02:09:12,061 --> 02:09:13,397
Yes I will go.

1395
02:09:14,284 --> 02:09:15,560
You also come with me.

1396
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:20,597
No. I will not be able
to stand in front of your mother.

1397
02:09:21,376 --> 02:09:22,954
It is due to my father...

1398
02:09:23,127 --> 02:09:25,051
You don't have any fault here.

1399
02:09:25,398 --> 02:09:28,868
Lets go so that I will
introduce you to my mother..

1400
02:09:28,948 --> 02:09:31,235
..and Nawab brother will also be there
and I will tell about our affair as well.

1401
02:09:31,315 --> 02:09:33,840
Shameless.

1402
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:45,235
Get the entire place surrounded.
- Okay.

1403
02:09:45,315 --> 02:09:47,181
Nawab should not get a chance to escape.
- Okay.

1404
02:09:48,608 --> 02:09:51,538
There. You go there.

1405
02:09:54,531 --> 02:09:55,872
You will not go with me.

1406
02:09:56,261 --> 02:09:57,537
How will I go?

1407
02:09:58,391 --> 02:10:00,434
I will not be able
to go without leaving them.

1408
02:10:00,514 --> 02:10:07,612
Will you not be able to go to your
own son leaving behind the orphans.

1409
02:10:08,044 --> 02:10:16,758
Once I went there for which
Piklu has gone away from me.

1410
02:10:18,173 --> 02:10:23,005
I will not repeat
that mistake again.

1411
02:10:23,085 --> 02:10:27,276
How can you say its a wrong thing
that a mother is coming to his son?

1412
02:10:27,356 --> 02:10:35,352
I have given birth to you but these
orphans have given back my life.

1413
02:10:36,854 --> 02:10:40,616
I had given you few
drops of blood to save you..

1414
02:10:41,881 --> 02:10:45,470
..but here the children had
given bottles of blood to save me.

1415
02:10:46,962 --> 02:10:48,908
I will not go anywhere leaving them.

1416
02:10:50,291 --> 02:10:55,113
Moreover to look
after you he is there..

1417
02:10:56,637 --> 02:10:58,767
..but no one is there
to look after the orphans.

1418
02:10:58,847 --> 02:11:01,696
There are lots of people
to look after them.

1419
02:11:02,182 --> 02:11:05,804
Gopal brother, Aunty,
Nawab Brother, all of them are here.

1420
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:09,945
He won't stay here.
- What?

1421
02:11:11,167 --> 02:11:12,280
Where will Nawab brother go?

1422
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,714
Jail.

1423
02:11:14,007 --> 02:11:15,015
Jail.

1424
02:11:15,728 --> 02:11:20,583
I had given him sometime
till the time Sarama is cured.

1425
02:11:21,275 --> 02:11:22,269
Now he's under arrest.

1426
02:11:22,485 --> 02:11:24,853
Why what is the crime
he has committed?

1427
02:11:24,933 --> 02:11:34,330
The way Ajit's gunmen shot you
in the same way he had beaten me..

1428
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:37,414
..and taken the
law on his own hands.

1429
02:11:37,771 --> 02:11:42,939
What you were not able
to do he had done it?

1430
02:11:43,425 --> 02:11:49,588
He had given you Ajit who
is an assassin and criminal.

1431
02:11:50,647 --> 02:11:55,858
Yes we are grateful to
him from the police department.

1432
02:11:56,128 --> 02:11:58,344
To show your gratefulness
you have come here..

1433
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:03,285
to handcuff him instead of
putting a garland around his neck.

1434
02:12:03,577 --> 02:12:04,582
Sorry Madam.

1435
02:12:04,885 --> 02:12:06,734
The crime that he has committed.....

1436
02:12:08,431 --> 02:12:09,674
Please come.

1437
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:12,413
We will not let them
take away our Nawab brother.

1438
02:12:12,582 --> 02:12:15,263
Gopal brother why are so silent?

1439
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,971
Why are you not saying anything?

1440
02:12:17,566 --> 02:12:19,296
Why are you not saying anything?

1441
02:12:21,144 --> 02:12:25,393
Look I may not be anything
to him but you love him..

1442
02:12:25,588 --> 02:12:26,723
..so why don't you do anything?

1443
02:12:26,803 --> 02:12:32,918
Please say something by looking
at the face of the orphans.

1444
02:12:32,998 --> 02:12:36,896
I am bowing in front
of you please do something.

1445
02:12:36,976 --> 02:12:39,199
He is silent as he knows that..

1446
02:12:39,847 --> 02:12:44,671
..doing wrong is crime and tolerating
crime is a much bigger offense.

1447
02:12:45,688 --> 02:12:49,698
Even if you are protesting against
a crime, breaking the law is a crime.

1448
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:52,908
No.

1449
02:12:57,772 --> 02:12:59,275
Nawab.

1450
02:13:06,215 --> 02:13:07,080
Nawab.

1451
02:13:08,486 --> 02:13:10,324
Come out wherever you are.

1452
02:13:11,145 --> 02:13:13,037
Your house has been surrounded.

1453
02:13:13,739 --> 02:13:15,761
You are under arrest.

1454
02:13:16,983 --> 02:13:18,269
Nawab.

1455
02:13:20,777 --> 02:13:22,680
Nawab.

1456
02:13:33,857 --> 02:13:34,917
Nawab.

1457
02:13:38,118 --> 02:13:39,058
Lets go inside.

1458
02:13:39,138 --> 02:13:39,966
Lets go sir.

1459
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:43,836
Will you stand like a stone statue?

1460
02:13:44,474 --> 02:13:45,544
Gopal brother.

1461
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:48,766
What will I do tell me?

1462
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:51,512
Nawab does not like
that any common man..

1463
02:13:51,858 --> 02:13:53,166
..should intervene
in any police activities.

1464
02:13:53,246 --> 02:13:57,523
You should have told
him to escape from here.

1465
02:13:58,648 --> 02:14:00,442
Do you all get to know
this about him over these years?

1466
02:14:01,339 --> 02:14:02,918
He will not escape.

1467
02:14:02,998 --> 02:14:04,485
Nawab.

1468
02:14:07,134 --> 02:14:08,248
Where will you go Nawab?

1469
02:14:08,328 --> 02:14:09,318
I am here.

1470
02:14:31,868 --> 02:14:32,603
Sir, you.

1471
02:14:32,683 --> 02:14:34,765
The things that were undone by wearing
the police uniform has been done..

1472
02:14:35,522 --> 02:14:37,522
..without wearing
the police uniform.

1473
02:14:37,998 --> 02:14:40,301
I was searching that from
a level of a union leader..

1474
02:14:41,263 --> 02:14:44,398
..to a minister how come
Ajit had been able to make..

1475
02:14:44,478 --> 02:14:45,944
..so much wealth and property.

1476
02:14:47,036 --> 02:14:54,528
While doing so I saw some hoodlums
were trying to ill treat Sarama.

1477
02:14:55,641 --> 02:15:00,171
Then I came to Gopal
brother's Orphanage.

1478
02:15:02,322 --> 02:15:04,052
Gopal Brother used
to work in police..

1479
02:15:05,349 --> 02:15:11,436
..and one day accidentally one bullet
from his pistol killed one common man..

1480
02:15:12,366 --> 02:15:14,063
..and his 2 children became orphan.

1481
02:15:15,761 --> 02:15:19,739
Due to this incident he left the
police job and built this orphanage.

1482
02:15:19,923 --> 02:15:28,485
My name is there only in this Orphanage
as he sends money every month from Delhi.

1483
02:15:29,502 --> 02:15:35,070
As an officer he is helping
me to get relief from my sins.

1484
02:15:35,437 --> 02:15:38,745
Sir you could have given
your introduction earlier to me.

1485
02:15:38,918 --> 02:15:41,913
I had once given my
introduction to Bikash..

1486
02:15:42,518 --> 02:15:44,713
..when he arrested me and
took me to the police station.

1487
02:15:45,005 --> 02:15:47,859
When police is there why are
you taking the law in your hands.

1488
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:51,826
His bail would be given by his
father but who will give your bail?

1489
02:15:53,447 --> 02:15:57,167
If you have a money bag in
your pocket do you require a bail?

1490
02:15:57,247 --> 02:16:00,064
Wait, don't take that out.

1491
02:16:00,594 --> 02:16:02,443
If you take that out I
will put you behind the bars.

1492
02:16:03,078 --> 02:16:05,697
Okay. Let me open the bag once.

1493
02:16:11,255 --> 02:16:13,493
Nobody should know who I am.

1494
02:16:15,093 --> 02:16:16,178
Nobody.

1495
02:16:17,223 --> 02:16:19,850
I had to beat you at that point of
time as I did not have any other option.

1496
02:16:20,126 --> 02:16:22,055
Please excuse me.

1497
02:16:27,493 --> 02:16:31,385
I am going Sarama,
I am going Gopal brother.

1498
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:41,882
Why are you here?

1499
02:16:42,671 --> 02:16:44,562
When I wanted to enter
from the other gate..

1500
02:16:44,642 --> 02:16:46,508
..I got your introduction
from one of the policemen.

1501
02:16:46,843 --> 02:16:51,924
I heard that your jeep is in this gate and
you would be going out from this gate.

1502
02:16:52,004 --> 02:16:52,908
Come.

1503
02:16:59,685 --> 02:17:03,631
Sarama, her father was the person
who instructed to kill your husband..

1504
02:17:05,578 --> 02:17:07,134
..and she is the one
who saved your son's life.

1505
02:17:08,172 --> 02:17:09,750
If she had not told us..

1506
02:17:16,756 --> 02:17:17,891
I am going Sarama.

1507
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:27,945
Please don't leave us. Please don't
leave us. Please don't leave us.

1508
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:39,134
You all come here
let him go to work.

1509
02:17:45,697 --> 02:17:57,377
"Throughout the life you need to work.."

1510
02:17:57,457 --> 02:18:07,350
"..for the mass by loving your country."

1511
02:18:15,643 --> 02:18:26,647
"When you see sadness then you
should tell by going to that place.."

1512
02:18:27,988 --> 02:18:36,015
"..if you want to live
live with a smile..."
