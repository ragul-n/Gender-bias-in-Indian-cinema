1
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,916
Madam, the house robbery case has been verified.

2
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,291
The report file has been sent to your station.

3
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,625
-Whom have you given it to? 
-I'll check, Madam.

4
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,291
To whom have you given it to?

5
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,208
We've given it to the Head Constable, Madam

6
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,208
Bro. You don't call

7
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,416
Sir, it was a mistake please give it back, 
we’re sorry

8
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,625
Is it your father's road? 
You guys have caused a traffic jam!

9
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,000
Pay the fine, then take your musical instruments.

10
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who is he? 
Did you smoke weed?

11
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,625
Sir, please spare us. We don't have money. 
We were playing for a good cause.

12
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,375
What happened?

13
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,375
They created a traffic jam at the 
circle with their orchestra.

14
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,000
Let them go...

15
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:30,958
Sir, it is a Rock band not an orchestra!.

16
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,416
Sir, it is a Rock band not an orchestra!.

17
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,916
Whatever it is. You created a traffic jam 
and now you're giving excuses.

18
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,458
What is the status of your robbery case?

19
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,458
Sir, that's not my case!. I’m just filing 
reports for a case handled by someone else.

20
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,750
The verified file just came in sir.

21
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,166
What is this?

22
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:02,458
You're asking time for reporting such a small robbery case?

23
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,750
First learn to be on time.

24
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,750
How does it matter what time 
I come, if all I'm doing is filing reports.

25
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,416
What? Despite coming in late, you are also justifying it.

26
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,291
Sir please assign me a case to solve.

27
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,916
Fine!

28
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,791
First, finish this case…

29
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,083
Then, let’s see.

30
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,333
Hello sir. Come in, come in

31
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,083
Crowd Chattering

32
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,750
Madam, sir has called you

33
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,458
You kept asking for a case right?

34
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
A suicide case was reported last night

35
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,125
Take it. Address is there…

36
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:18,750
Listen

37
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,750
This is just your first case. Don’t try to act smart.

38
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,500
Multiple suicide cases are reported on a daily basis.

39
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,500
Each and every case cannot be investigated.

40
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,958
Identify the victim and hand over the body to the family.

41
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:48,250
Song playing

42
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,541
-Check if this key fits anywhere in the house 
-Ok, Madam

43
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,625
Coming, madam!

44
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,041
What happened?

45
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:35,333
Madam, this key doesn't fit any of the doors or cupboards

46
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,166
Umm, Okay

47
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,833
Inform the forensics and get the post mortem done ASAP.

48
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,708
There's a chewing gum stuck on 
that chair. Get that checked too.

49
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,791
Okay madam

50
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,416
Are you the one who witnessed it?

51
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,666
What madam?

52
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,666
Madam, he doesn't know Kannada …

53
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,541
Were you the first one to witness it?

54
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,875
No madam. The night watchman 
was the first one to see it.

55
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,541
How many houses have been occupied on this floor?

56
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,416
Madam, there are no occupants on this floor yet.

57
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,250
However, in many of the houses, 
carpentry and painting work is going on…

58
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,375
Then, who is this? 
is he the house owner?

59
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know madam. 
You need to ask the security chief

60
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Collect all the footages 
from the surveillance camera

61
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,125
Okay madam

62
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,333
Collect the flat owner's details 
from the manager.

63
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:30,916
Okay madam

64
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,583
And you also mentioned the night watchman right ?

65
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,458
Get him along with the security chief to the station.

66
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,375
Okay, madam

67
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,375
Walky talky announcement

68
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,375
Come in

69
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
He's the apartment manager

70
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,958
Hello, madam

71
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,125
Sit down

72
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,791
Madam, this is the night watchman.

73
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,416
Tell madam what happened

74
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,125
Madam, it was around 12 at night…

75
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,833
And, it was time for my daily rounds…

76
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,375
As it was new moon that day ..

77
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750
It was although more scarier….

78
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,500
However, I was left with no choice, so I had to go.

79
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,541
While I was passing by the house on the sixth floor, 
there was a foul smell.

80
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,666
I knocked on the door, in order to find out what was wrong, 
but nobody answered.

81
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,750
However, I opened the door with the keys I had…

82
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,416
There was also a power cut..

83
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,208
So I was terrified.

84
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,166
I switched on my torch 
and went inside

85
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,000
I was taken aback to see a man hanging from the fan

86
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,625
After witnessing it, I was so petrified 
that I got a fever.

87
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,041
Even now I am sick, you can check for yourself madam.

88
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,625
Sorry, Madam

89
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,750
I removed the computer cable

90
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,375
Assuming that the surveillance camera 
wouldn’t record anything.

91
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:11,500
Assuming that the surveillance camera 
wouldn’t record anything.

92
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,666
Assuming that the surveillance camera 
wouldn’t record anything.

93
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:17,208
I spent my childhood in a colony where there 
only one house which had a TV

94
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,875
Since then I was crazy about watching TV.

95
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,333
Every Sunday at 6 P.M there was a 
program which was telecasted,

96
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,583
For which everyone used to line up right from 4 P.M.

97
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,458
No matter how hard I tried to get done with my work

98
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,375
It would end latest only by 5:30 P.M.

99
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,416
Even if all I wanted was to find a spot by the window,

100
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,416
people used to shoo me away…

101
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,125
Do you know why?

102
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,625
Because, I was just a small boy.

103
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,666
That's why they would shoo me away…

104
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,333
That is when I thought,

105
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,583
That one day, I would sit in my house, on my couch, 
watch TV with my legs crossed.

106
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,375
But that never happened.

107
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,416
Even today I sit on the 
floor and watch TV

108
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,333
At this age, I only earn ₹ 10,000.

109
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,041
With which I have to run the house, 
send the kids to school etc..

110
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,541
Tell me madam, how is it feasible?

111
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
I know I have failed.

112
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,875
In such desperate times,

113
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,500
to turn my dream into reality

114
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,333
I used to secretly indulge in watching TV 
in a few houses of the apartment.

115
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,416
But, I did not steal a single penny 
from any of the houses.

116
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,625
I swear on my children

117
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
I didn't do anything madam

118
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,333
Sir please explain them

119
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,666
I have not done anything wrong, madam.

120
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,250
At least you tell them, Sir…

121
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,208
I have not done anything

122
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,541
It's alright, come with me.

123
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,500
I have not done anything

124
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,375
Hold on, sir !

125
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,208
-Please believe me. I didn't do anything.

126
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,625
Go, sit in that corner.

127
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,791
Madam, in many of the houses in the apartment

128
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,625
Painting and carpentry work is still going on

129
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,625
The work is still in progress

130
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,708
But, many potential buyers keep coming in 
to check the houses,

131
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,833
So, we have given a set of keys to the security guards.

132
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
They have the keys at all times

133
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,375
They go on routine rounds at 6 pm to check,

134
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,125
Then the night watchmen 
also go on rounds to check

135
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,333
But, I am uncertain as to why he 
would indulge in such an act…

136
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,625
Madam, it's only been 2 days since we installed 
the surveillance cameras.

137
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,333
We've already handed over all those footage.

138
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,458
If required, we can you give you the register as well.

139
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,375
Madam, the flat owner’s details are in this file.

140
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,333
But, he stays in Canada

141
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,125
He bought this house 6 months ago.

142
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,333
I don't think the guy who died here is the owner

143
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,041
On a call

144
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,791
Can we leave, madam?

145
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,375
Yes, you may.

146
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,708
This is definitely a homicide.

147
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
He only must've done it.

148
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,625
Did you not observe the chair fallen next to the body?

149
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,708
What happened to 
the orchestra boys?

150
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,833
One of the boy's father paid money and 
bailed them out madam.

151
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,500
What is it?

152
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,208
I have a doubt on the watchman 
from the suicide case.

153
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,375
We have taken him under our custody.

154
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,833
Why unnecessarily?

155
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Okay

156
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,625
Put him in the lock up for 
two days and release him.

157
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,333
Also, have you identified the body?

158
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,250
It's happening, sir.

159
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,666
First get that completed

160
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll do it, sir

161
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,041
Did you find anything?

162
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,916
We have analysed the body. Looks like a suicide to me.

163
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,333
Time of death should be about 2-3 days ago. I am not sure.

164
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,208
Will know for sure once 
the post mortem comes in.

165
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,458
When will the postmortem be done?

166
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,250
It'll be done soon

167
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,791
We have recovered the victim’s phone and wallet 
and sent it to your station.

168
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,666
Collect the owner details. We'll go check the address.

169
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,333
Also, get the call recordings

170
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,333
Okay, Madam

171
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,333
Tell me, ma

172
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,333
What do you have to do?

173
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,875
You just have to sit in one place and 
report files, that is all.

174
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,958
Who? Me?

175
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,208
Shut up

176
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,791
I have to do everything alone

177
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,958
The sim is registered on this address.

178
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,666
But, the house is locked

179
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,416
-Did you enquire with the neighbors? 
-Yes Madam

180
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,625
Nobody even knew that his name is Prashanth.

181
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,333
he was a tenant in this house.

182
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,666
Okay, ask around

183
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,000
Ill check there

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's the 1st floor, Madam

185
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,416
1st floor? Okay, give.

186
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,000
You can go

187
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Okay madam

188
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,333
Sorry, tell me, Ma

189
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:54,416
I was telling you something seriously 
and you put me on hold

190
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,916
Do you know how hard it is to find a good tailor?

191
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,333
Sorry, my mistake. Tell me.

192
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,458
Do you know how difficult it is to run a boutique?

193
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:09,958
Try to fit in my shoes for a day. I have to buy the 
clothes, stitch them and also deliver them on time.

194
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,625
Do you think it is an easy job?

195
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:16,250
The one tailor I had also quit. That, 
now I have to do all the tailoring as well.

196
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,375
How much work can I do?

197
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:24,375
I need to find a good tailor. Do you know how 
hard it is to find a good tailor these days?

198
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:31,208
Your uncle is coming over for dinner tonight. 
I have so much cooking to do. You just--

199
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,250
Coming, Madam!

200
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,916
Where is that key we found 
at the apartment today?

201
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,833
Sorry Madam. Forgot I had it with me

202
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,125
What is this Madam? So many Adhaar Cards!

203
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,833
-Something is fishy, isn't it? 
-Yes Madam

204
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,750
Look here. It says Kolar District

205
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,375
Check this address out

206
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,500
-We might get some lead. 
-Okay Madam

207
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,833
Kiran, 1 minute

208
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,000
I’m sending you a victim’s photo. His name is Prashant

209
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,166
Check if there are any criminal records in his name

210
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,333
Who are you?

211
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,041
You've broken into the house.

212
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,708
I’ll call the police!

213
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,708
Who are you ?

214
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,500
I’m the owner of this house

215
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,208
Do you have a rental agreement with the tenant?

216
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,250
Have you done a 
background verification?

217
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,833
Get all these documents to the station today

218
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,791
Otherwise, your house will be seized.

219
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,375
Madam, I’ve checked the entire database

220
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,708
Prashanth's photo is not matching 
with any of our records.

221
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,000
Prashanth also has no criminal record against his name.

222
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:50,041
Did you check the Adhaar cards 
that were given? Are they valid?

223
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,333
Yes. They're all valid.

224
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,875
Did you notice what's common here?

225
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,375
What?

226
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,750
All these Adhaar card holders

227
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,875
..reside in Old-Town' s slum.

228
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,333
I'll go there immediately to collect it

229
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,791
The water tankers are so expensive …

230
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:28,041
We get free water only once a week, how do we 
manage the rest of the days…

231
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:35,583
Crowd Chattering

232
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,833
- What's up? 
- Nothing much.

233
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,083
Remember, Today’s drinks are on you…

234
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,166
Today, you are not getting away with it!.

235
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,958
Yes, dear. 
I just had my lunch.

236
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,541
Okay, I will see you soon.

237
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,916
Do you know where Sita's house is?

238
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:35,250
Oh! Sita.. Her house is right here. 
I'll take you.

239
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,250
By the way, why do you want to meet her? 
Who are you?

240
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,500
- I need to talk to her. 
- Oh, is it?

241
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,375
This is her house.

242
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,750
Sita-Sister?

243
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,250
Wait up, she'll come

244
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes, coming!

245
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,916
Why are you shouting?

246
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,583
She wanted to see you, 
so I got her here.

247
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,458
Why? Who are you?

248
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,041
What do you want?

249
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,708
-Do you have your Adhaar card? 
-Yeah, I have it.

250
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,625
Can you please get it?

251
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,791
I'll get it.

252
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:07,250
How much will you pay?

253
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,750
-How much did they give you last time? 
-1,000 Rupees.

254
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,708
Okay, get it.

255
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,666
Okay, wait. I'll get it.

256
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,625
What is this?

257
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,375
Last time you paid all of us. 
Why only for her now?

258
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,833
Wait, I’ll get mine too.

259
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,541
Lakshmi, Suba-Sister, go and get your Aadhaar cards

260
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,041
They've come to pay again.

261
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,666
Go on, quick! Get it fast.

262
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,750
Wait! I'll also come.

263
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,875
You come as well

264
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,541
Go call your brother.

265
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,666
Here's my Adhaar card.

266
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,333
Take it.

267
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,333
Give me the money.

268
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,125
Here it is

269
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,750
Then who’s Aadhaar card is this ?

270
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,375
This is mine

271
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,166
How did you get it?

272
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,791
How did I get it?

273
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,583
To whom have you given your Aadhaar cards to?

274
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,333
I don't know about that

275
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,666
He promised to pay 1000 Rupees, so I gave.

276
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,833
He took it and 
then returned it.

277
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,791
What will I do with it?

278
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,333
Is he the one who paid you?

279
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,458
He's the one!

280
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,208
- Oh yeah 
- It's him

281
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,166
With the money we got last time, 
we got a water tanker.

282
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,166
Madam! 
Are you giving us the money or not?

283
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,000
The guy in the photo

284
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,250
How do you know him?

285
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,375
We don't know all of that…

286
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,333
All we cared was he gave us money. 
Are you giving or not?

287
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,500
I've left my work & come.

288
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,625
Give us the money, soon

289
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,958
You say you don't know him

290
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,666
So how can you give 
your documents to a stranger?

291
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes. Even I've left work and come. 
Give us the money and we'll leave.

292
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,125
I'm not paying any money

293
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,416
Keep your documents safe with you. 
Do not give it to anyone.

294
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,958
What the?

295
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,958
You said you'd pay us money, 
and now you're just wasting our time.

296
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,750
Come on, lets leave

297
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,041
Instead of completing your homework, 
you're playing?

298
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,583
I'm not playing. 
Math is hard but this is harder.

299
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,041
If I solve this, 
I can solve math easily.

300
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,500
You were asking about some guy, who took the 
Aadhaar cards, right?

301
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,208
Yes. Do you know him?

302
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,125
I don't know him. 
But I've seen him with Kunta

303
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,125
Kunta? Who is he? 
Do you know where he is?

304
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,375
I don't know.

305
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,416
That dude over there might know

306
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,541
This dude?

307
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,958
Do you know where Kunta is?

308
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,333
Kunta?

309
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,458
He'll be sloshed in some bar. Why?

310
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,708
Can you take me there?

311
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,083
Madam, let me check if he is there.

312
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,583
Madam, Kunta isn't there. 
But his drinking buddy is.

313
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,666
Who is he?

314
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,500
The only lone old drunkard over there..

315
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,958
You know Kunta, right?

316
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,333
Not really… 
We just drink together.

317
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,250
Where is Kunta now?

318
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,416
He should be here, any minute.

319
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,458
He'll be here.

320
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,916
Can you call him and 
find out when he’ll come?

321
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,875
He has a million phone numbers.

322
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,333
How am I supposed to know 
which number to call on?

323
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,583
What does he do?

324
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:24,833
He is currently jobless. 
However, he wasn’t doing anything legitimate.

325
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,708
What was he doing?

326
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,958
Weed, Shoe-Polish, Brown-Sugar

327
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,583
Even worse, 
He used to sell spiked ice cream to school kids.

328
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:41,666
Is he still into it? 
He was just the peddler..

329
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:46,333
His Boss has stopped all such activities. 
So he doesn't have any job.

330
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,458
Who's his boss?

331
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,333
Take a wild guess…

332
00:27:54,416 --> 00:28:00,625
Crowd chattering in a bar

333
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,333
Munirathna. This bar's owner.

334
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:09,875
Utter another word, 
you'll lose your tongue.

335
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,500
You go on.

336
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,791
Try speaking now, 
I dare you.

337
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,458
Tell me

338
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,833
What was the boss involved in?

339
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,416
If you open your mouth, 
you'll not leave this place.

340
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,875
Tell me

341
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:27,791
Dude!

342
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,416
I don't think they get it. 
Let's show them.

343
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,625
Bro

344
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,000
You're going first this time too?

345
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,500
Guru Brahma, Guru Devo, Guru Vishnu, Maheshwara!

346
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,833
In everything Guru is always first, bro.

347
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,000
Now speak

348
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,125
-Is this where you make a lady sit? 
-Sir, that..

349
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,916
Shut up! Do you have any sense?

350
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:26,333
Listen, if you want to enquire 
about me, ask me. I'll answer.

351
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,666
Don't come here unnecessarily

352
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,333
I've changed for the good. 
I've filed my nomination for the upcoming elections.

353
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,875
I want to do some 
good to the society.

354
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,916
This is the only bar I run. 
A lot of shady things goes down in other bars.

355
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:46,166
Instead, you are here...

356
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:49,083
He is Kunta. 
Ask him anything you want.

357
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,583
You know Prashant, right?

358
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,625
Don't you recognize him?

359
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,916
Look, women shouldn't be here.

360
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,416
If there's anything, 
I'll let you know. Now, please leave.

361
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,166
Have a closer look .. 
and tell me.

362
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,458
I ain’t going to forget your face.

363
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,916
I will find out who Prashant is and what he does

364
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:23,708
If I discover any connection between the two of you…

365
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:31,916
Have you realised what you've done?

366
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm getting calls from another jurisdiction.

367
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,000
You created a ruckus at some bar today!

368
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,250
Before going to another jurisdiction for investigation

369
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,916
Don't you have the common sense 
to inform their Police Station?

370
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,166
Has the body been identified?

371
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,041
Complete that first.

372
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,958
You get some Adhaar cards and wander off to some bar!

373
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,458
Brother

374
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,875
Enough!

375
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:06,708
Hey, no no. I have to get home.

376
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:11,208
I've told my wife that I'll be back. 
She's angry that I'm not there.

377
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,250
If I don't go home tonight, she'll kill me.

378
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:43,708
Indra, I'm going to bed. 
Don't let your uncle drink too much.

379
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:47,458
Okay. You go sleep now. 
I'll leave after this game.

380
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:51,791
So, how's retired life treating you?

381
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,458
What else do you expect?

382
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,250
You tell me.

383
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,250
Your career is just starting.

384
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,500
I've got my first case.

385
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,875
But?

386
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,625
If it was a murder, there would have been a motive.

387
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:20,333
But I don't understand why would someone commit suicide?

388
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,958
Isn't it cowardice?

389
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,208
One cannot just say that

390
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,166
He would make everyone laugh

391
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,875
He had everything, so why?

392
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,625
On a personal note

393
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,083
I knew someone

394
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,125
He seemed to be a very happy man

395
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,625
He spoke happily that night.

396
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:02,958
But by morning he was gone.

397
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,041
But why?

398
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,041
Only he knows why.

399
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:15,250
Only they know what's bothering them inside

400
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,916
Their trouble might seem petty to us

401
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,166
but it may be a big deal for them.

402
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:26,333
Each person and their personalities

403
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,833
Why? How? Who knows?

404
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,625
Only they can understand

405
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,208
The way you cornered me

406
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,041
reminds me of my brother.

407
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,458
Your father.

408
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,958
Wasn’t he the one who taught you to play Chess?

409
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,250
He wished to join the Military, as well?

410
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:14,416
Since I was older, 
I joined the military first.

411
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:20,541
Our mother didn't want both her sons joining the military.

412
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,708
That's why he wasn't allowed to go.

413
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:27,000
If he saw you now, 
he'd be very proud.

414
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,541
No dear. I have to leave.

415
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,375
Enough. I have to go home.

416
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:51,666
Listen

417
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,041
Whatever case comes your way,

418
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,625
don't break your head over it.

419
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:56,166
- How do you know Prashant? 
- Which Prashant?

420
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,250
You have purchased an apartment 
with Gupta Builders, right?

421
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,458
- Yeah! 
- Prashant has committed suicide in it.

422
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,666
What? In my flat?

423
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:07,708
Prashant? Oh yes. 
He's the agent who got me the flat.

424
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,791
He was looking after the painting 
and interiors for the flat.

425
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,958
Did Prashant work with Gupta Builders?

426
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,500
Maybe

427
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,458
Do you know anything else about Prashant?

428
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,416
He got in touch when I put up a post 
wanting to buy a flat.

429
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,541
During my previous visit, 
I purchased the flat.

430
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,750
What happened in Kolar?

431
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,000
I met Prashant's family, Madam.

432
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,875
They're innocent. He's the only, 
working member in the family.

433
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:47,125
But they don't know what 
kind of work he does.

434
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,833
He sends them money every month, on time.

435
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,583
Did you inform Prashant's family, 
about what happened to him?

436
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,708
Not yet, Madam

437
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:58,458
Its been 10 days since they spoke to him.

438
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,458
They even tried reaching out, 
To his friend friend.. Madhu?

439
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,458
No, Mani!

440
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,458
They tried calling him too. 
But they couldn't reach him.

441
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:11,041
Okay, inform Prashant's family 
and dispose his body.

442
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,041
- Alright Madam. 
-You mentioned someone named Mani

443
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,083
- Yes Madam. 
- Enquire about him

444
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:20,166
Also, interrogate the painters at Gupta Builders.

445
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:21,541
Okay, Madam

446
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,416
-There's no one named Prashant working here. 
-Is there any other branch?

447
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,958
If Prashant is not your employee, 
how can he sell your flats?

448
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,208
I don't know, Ma'am

449
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,708
Can you show this photo to your employees?

450
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,750
Please check

451
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,000
-Can you check if anyone knows him? 
-Okay, Madam.

452
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,708
Ma'am I know him.

453
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,791
Where have you seen him? 
How do you know him?

454
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:08,958
Where have you seen him? 
How do you know him?

455
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,416
I don't know him personally, 
But I've seen him in the office.

456
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:12,708
I don't know him personally, 
But I've seen him in the office.

457
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,958
Are you sure its him?

458
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,541
I remember it clearly.

459
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,125
When I was getting coffee, 
he was at the reception.

460
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:24,625
He took the gum from his mouth, 
and tried sticking it under the seat.

461
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,708
I got angry and shouted at him.

462
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,833
I got angry and shouted at him.

463
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,916
Then he threw the gum into the dustbin.

464
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:34,625
The receptionist said that 
he had come to see the boss.

465
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,500
But what he did was wrong, wasn't it?

466
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,833
The Receptionist remembers it as well.

467
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,541
Let's go ask her

468
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
- Okay 
- Come Ma'am

469
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,166
- Is your boss Gupta, here? 
- Sorry, he's not here.

470
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,416
- When will he come? 
- I don't know, Madam.

471
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,875
- Can you give his contact details? 
- I don't have it, Madam.

472
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,458
Prashant's body has been disposed.

473
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:01,250
But, we haven't received 
any information on Mani, yet.

474
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,333
We asked Prashant's parents about Mani.

475
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,583
They claim to have never seen him.

476
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,250
But they've spoken to him over Phone.

477
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,916
Try harder, Kiran. 
We'll find something.

478
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,041
Also, those Painters? 
Have you enquired with them?

479
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,583
They've only painted one layer.

480
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,750
Prashant had asked them to 
come and paint the next layer.

481
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,375
I called the house owner, 
where Prashant committed suicide.

482
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,375
He says that

483
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,541
Prashant got him the house

484
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,916
But

485
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,458
Prashant's name isn't there on 
Gupta Builder's employee list.

486
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,041
But, Prashant has met Mr. Gupta.

487
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,416
And that, I don't understand why

488
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:37,041
And we're not getting any 
further information about Gupta.

489
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:49,125
We must find this. I'll Inform the inspector.

490
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:50,083
Ok madam

491
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,750
Has the body been disposed?

492
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,583
All the formalities 
have been taken care of.

493
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,125
You can leave now.

494
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,875
Sir, the thing is...

495
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,958
I need permission to meet 
Mr.Gupta, the owner of Gupta Builders.

496
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,250
Why do you want to meet him?

497
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,166
Sir, Prashant has met Mr Gupta.

498
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:28,333
If we meet him, 
we'll get some clarity

499
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,833
Is Mr.Gupta the only person 
Prashant has met?

500
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,708
He meets thousands of people.

501
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,416
Tell me, why do you have to meet him in specific?

502
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:37,208
True, sir.

503
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,500
As far as we know,

504
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,208
Mr Gupta is the only who Prashant met

505
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
if we meet him once,

506
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,250
all the confusion will be cleared, sir.

507
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,791
Look, these real-estate Businessmen,

508
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,041
have contacts, 
with influential politicians.

509
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,583
Tomorrow if 
something goes wrong,

510
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,208
I don't want, 
to be blamed.

511
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,333
You may leave now

512
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,166
Please wait

513
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,541
I found out where Gupta lives.

514
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,333
- What do you want? 
- I want to meet Mr. Gupta.

515
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,208
- Who are you? 
- Indra from Crime Branch.

516
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,791
Kiran, talk to him.

517
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,916
- We might get some information. 
- Okay Madam.

518
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,208
-You can go inside, Madam

519
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,583
What are you doing?

520
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,375
Please sit.

521
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,750
Tell me 
What did want to talk about?

522
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,875
I wanted to talk about, 
your employee, Prashant.

523
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,333
Prashant? 
Which Prashant?

524
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,375
The one who committed suicide in 
one of your flats two days ago

525
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,083
That Prashant

526
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,583
Was his name Prashant?

527
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,583
If he was my employee, 
I should know of him, right?

528
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:55,333
If Prashant isn't your employee, 
then how can he sell your flats?

529
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,333
Do you have any photo of him?

530
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,333
Him?

531
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,166
He sold flats for commission.

532
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,833
He came to my office 
to collect his commission.

533
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,583
Why did he commit suicide?

534
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,333
Only he knows why

535
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,375
It's been 3 days

536
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,250
Someone's crying isn't it?

537
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,750
I'll call you later.

538
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,041
Who are you?

539
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,208
Police?

540
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:58,750
Yes.

541
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,000
Please relax

542
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:06,541
You're playing with 
our daughter's life!

543
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:18,125
I know how to 
save my daughter.

544
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,000
No

545
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,791
Please relax. 
Its nothing!

546
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,333
- Kiran, inform the Inspector. 
- Okay, Madam.

547
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:51,791
- Also, ask him not to come in uniform. 
- Okay, madam.

548
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,958
Yes. 
My daughter has been kidnapped.

549
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,750
Its been 5 days.

550
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,000
What is it? 
Ransom?

551
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,916
We don't know yet, Sir.

552
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,583
Sir, When things got serious

553
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,333
Why didn't you inform, 
the Police immediately?

554
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,166
5 days ago,

555
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,166
I got a phone call.

556
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:01,541
The caller said that he has kidnapped my daughter

557
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,166
And then cut the call.

558
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,458
I didn't know what to do

559
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,916
I thought I'll call my husband 
and picked up my phone.

560
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,375
Immediately, I got another call.

561
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,375
He said, he wanted money.

562
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,708
But where, when and how much

563
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,791
He didn't mention any of that

564
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,333
He mentioned not to go to the Police.

565
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,958
And after that

566
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,333
He didn't call for 2 days.

567
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,916
On the third day he called

568
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:34,333
and asked If we had informed the Police

569
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,166
I said no.

570
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,333
And then

571
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,250
He called yesterday

572
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,541
and said that he wanted money.

573
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,333
When, where and how much, I'll tell later

574
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,583
and then cut the call.

575
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,916
When he called the first time

576
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
There was a girl crying, behind him.

577
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:58,000
I could hear her crying loudly.

578
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,166
Now tell me

579
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,458
If you were in my place,

580
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,458
would you have informed the Police?

581
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,416
Let him ask for any amount

582
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,791
We understand, Sir.

583
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,791
Do not worry, 
We are with you.

584
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:20,000
We will take care of it.

585
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,125
It doesn't feel right.

586
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,000
First, let my daughter come home.

587
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,500
They have asked us not to go the Police.

588
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,208
Which is why we've sent away all our house workers

589
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,333
Sir, until your daughter is back

590
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,916
We won't take any action. 
We'll be with you.

591
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,166
We'll help you 
in any way we can.

592
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:56,000
Madam, you asked for someone from the Telecom Department.

593
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,083
This is him. 
His name is Diamond.

594
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,500
Madam the first call was made on the 21st.

595
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,041
It was a Bangalore number

596
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,541
After that, on the 22nd he didn't make any calls.

597
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:10,625
23rd and 24th, there were 2 more calls.

598
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,125
One from Mumbai and another from Delhi

599
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,375
Call duration for both numbers 
doesn't go beyond 2 minutes.

600
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,916
And the 2 Bangalore numbers?

601
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,416
We've called in the number owners, Madam. 
I'll go and get them.

602
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,666
Can we find out who hacked it?

603
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,125
It's the Cyber-Crime Department's work, Madam.

604
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,125
We can't find out.

605
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,791
- Can we get the call records? 
- Yes madam.

606
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,125
As I need to get permission 
from the Commissioner's office.

607
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,791
and then I'll get them to 
you as soon as possible.

608
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,833
If we get a call right now,

609
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,375
can you trace the location?

610
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:46,166
We can trace, 
but cannot pin the accurate location.

611
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,416
Madam their numbers 
were used to make the call.

612
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:54,750
Their phones were stolen the day the calls were made.

613
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,875
They blocked their sim cards 
and reported it the same day.

614
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,416
-Give your complaint copies and leave 
-Okay, madam.

615
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,458
- Trace the daughter, Aishwarya's number. 
- Okay

616
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,166
- and get her call records. 
- Sure

617
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,250
He called again

618
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,208
He wants 2 crore rupees

619
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,791
He told us to 
keep the money ready.

620
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,958
Have you already 
arranged for the 2 crores?

621
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:30,208
Can you trace the call?

622
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,000
Can you tell me the WiFi password?

623
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
-The router is near the TV. 
-Ok.

624
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
There's a sticker behind it.

625
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,958
-You haven't spoken to your daughter yet, have you? 
-No

626
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,791
Next time he calls, 
tell him you'll give the money.

627
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:49,333
But request if you can 
speak to your daughter once

628
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,750
By 9 a.m tomorrow morning,

629
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,208
You be prepared to come alone. 
I'll call again.

630
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,791
Just a minute

631
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,375
The money is ready.

632
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,583
I'll be ready at 9 a.m.

633
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:24,541
But please

634
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:28,875
Before our meeting, 
I want to speak to my daughter once

635
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,500
First call is from Chennai, 
and the next is from Chandigarh.

636
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,791
Your daughter is with me, 
but I can't let you talk to her right now.

637
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:49,208
Give me 1 crore tomorrow, 
and you will get to see your daughter.

638
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,708
After that, 
give the rest of the money.

639
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,000
You can have your daughter back then.

640
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:59,000
Follow whatever he said

641
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:01,333
First, see your daughter.

642
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,916
My daughter has been kidnapped

643
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,958
In cases like these, 
we have to be very careful, Sir.

644
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,208
We don't know 
what they are capable of.

645
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,583
Sir sending your wife 
alone tomorrow morning

646
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,875
May not be a good idea.

647
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,750
It could be a threat to her life.

648
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,500
What are you trying to imply?

649
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:01,875
Start

650
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,875
Okay

651
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,041
Follow my directions.

652
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,083
The call will get disconnected, 
every two minutes.

653
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,958
Go straight now. 
I'll call again.

654
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,541
Go straight

655
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,333
Take the left and stop the car.

656
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,333
Take the money 
and get down alone.

657
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,250
- Cross the road. 
- Okay.

658
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,083
Stop that Auto.

659
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:16,375
Come to Church Street.

660
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,458
Where to?

661
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,791
Autos aren't allowed there. 
I can't take you.

662
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:26,125
Did he say, 
he won't come?

663
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,791
Tell him you'll pay Rs. 2,000

664
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,416
I'll pay you Rs. 2000.

665
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:32,666
₹ 2000? I'll take you 
around the globe, Madam.

666
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,583
Get down here.

667
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,125
There's an old Maruti 800 parked.

668
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,000
Get to the car.

669
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,916
You have to 
drive this car.

670
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,625
What happened?

671
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,166
Are you carrying any weapons?

672
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,166
Nothing. 
I only got the cash.

673
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:32,958
Take the money out. 
Throw the bag away.

674
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,541
Throw away your phone as well.

675
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,041
Start the car.

676
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,125
Isn't the car starting?

677
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,916
It's an old car, Madam. 
Try harder. It'll start.

678
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,375
Reverse the car, 
and come straight.

679
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,208
Come straight..

680
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,958
Do you know the plight of 
kidnapped girls?

681
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:40,708
They get raped.

682
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,125
Not by one.

683
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:43,250
Not once.

684
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,166
There are some Psychopaths ..

685
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,375
If you get trapped with them

686
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,458
They'll skin you alive.

687
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,458
Maybe, it could happen to you too.

688
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,250
But

689
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,250
I'm not like them.

690
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,083
You're all alone.

691
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,375
But nothing 
will happen to you.

692
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,500
I have a special gift for you.

693
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,541
Wait for it.

694
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,208
Where's my daughter?

695
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,958
You said you'll show her 
once you get the money.

696
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
For that, 
The girl’s mother had to come.

697
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:11,125
Can you please push the car.

698
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:32,250
Song on the radio

699
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,000
Can I borrow your phone, please?

700
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,125
Here!

701
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:43,083
Song on the radio

702
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,458
Mr. Gupta!! What’s happening over here?

703
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,041
Due to hypertension, 
she could even get a heart attack.

704
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:49,000
I’ll make a move.

705
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,333
My daughter, Aishwarya.

706
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,208
She is an introvert.

707
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,541
Did she paint all of these?

708
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:34,583
Sir, 
what do we do now?

709
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,416
You, please tell me.

710
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:38,416
What do we do?

711
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,083
Alright

712
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:44,375
For the first-case, you begged for?

713
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:47,333
Look what have you done?

714
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:52,166
Kidnaping cases like these, 
Must be solved in 2 days.

715
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,041
It’s already been a day, 
Since the ransom was paid.

716
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,041
We still haven’t heard from them.

717
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:06,875
We had one opportunity to save the girl. 
But because of your deeds, we have lost it.

718
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,708
Shut up!

719
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:15,750
Who knows, we would've seen the girl, 
had Mrs. Gupta gone.

720
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,083
For such reckless work, 
I have the urge to dismiss you.

721
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,541
Hadn’t you asked me 
the other day,

722
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,708
Why must I come to the station, 
to do reporting-work, right?

723
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,666
You don't have to 
come to the station anymore.

724
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:31,000
Take the reports, sit in your house

725
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:33,916
and file from there.

726
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,541
You may leave now

727
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,250
How come you're home so early today?

728
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,458
Not much work to do?

729
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:02,083
Look, I know there is something that is bothering you

730
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,166
Sitting idle will not do much good

731
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:10,416
Concentrate on what's next.

732
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,958
Okay fine,

733
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,250
I've found a new tailor.

734
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,791
I must leave now.

735
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:23,791
Alright! Lock the door.

736
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,791
Madam, Prashant's post mortem is done.

737
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,916
It is a suicide. 
I have sent the report to your station.

738
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,750
Yes, Madam.

739
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,958
Any lead on the whereabouts of 
Prashant's friend Mani?

740
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,958
No, Madam.

741
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,541
It was too crazy guys..

742
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,208
-Do you know anyone named Mani? 
-Yes

743
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,208
When did you last see him? 
Once. This morning.

744
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,375
You all can see too. 
Look!

745
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,833
Do you know anybody named Mani?

746
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,666
I dont know...

747
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,333
Geeta, wait I’ll join you .

748
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,125
Pankaja come here

749
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,666
- Brother... 
- What do you want, dear?

750
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:35,958
Do you know anybody named Mani? 
I don't know any Mani, dear.

751
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Grandpa, do you know anyone named Mani?

752
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,541
Mani? 
He is my grandson.

753
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,541
-You grandson? 
-Yes

754
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,958
-Where is he now? 
-I've sent him to school.

755
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,958
-To school? 
-Yes

756
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,208
-Why? 
-We send him to study...

757
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,125
But all he does, 
...is creating trouble.

758
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,125
How old is your Mani?

759
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,125
He should be...

760
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,625
Right. 9 years old.

761
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,083
He is only grown physically…

762
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,333
but, not mentally.

763
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,583
I think someone has left it behind.

764
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:39,583
If anyone asks, return it to them.

765
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,166
Where have you been all night?

766
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,166
You haven't slept!

767
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,250
Hey wait up!

768
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,000
Where are you going?

769
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,333
Brother, She wasn't home all night.

770
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,333
She doesn’t respond to anything I ask.

771
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,333
She hasn’t slept either.

772
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:01,125
I don’t know what to do.

773
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,875
Let me have a word with her.

774
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,541
What?

775
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:44,208
Hey

776
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:50,208
What's on your mind?

777
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,625
I dont know

778
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,750
A girl has been kidnapped.

779
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,916
I did my best to save her.

780
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,208
You know what happens.

781
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:14,166
We have read what is the plight of these kidnapped girls.

782
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,875
I dont know what to do now.

783
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,000
Is this why, you're unable to sleep at night.

784
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Personal and professional life isn’t the same.

785
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,333
Without that balance...

786
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,791
Living becomes hard

787
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,125
Look

788
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:08,041
Apply the same strategy of the game 
To your case as well.

789
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,333
Uncle

790
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,375
In this game, 
I'm playing against you.

791
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:15,416
Even before you make your next move

792
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:17,833
This case, isn't like that!

793
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:21,791
I don't know my opponents and what strategy to use

794
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,958
How can I use this strategy?

795
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,333
In chess,

796
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,541
There's a game called 'Round Robin'.

797
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:37,166
In which one player plays against 
six unknown players.

798
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:49,666
There are many players who've won Round Robin.

799
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,125
Indra, what are you reading ?

800
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,333
Isn't that a dragon?

801
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,958
Its not a dragon, Mom. 
This is Vrithra, a demon.

802
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,041
But it looks like a dragon.

803
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:08,666
This might be the origin for the concept of a dragon.

804
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,166
You see, it's expelling fire from its mouth.

805
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:14,625
There is only drought and famine wherever 
Vrithra goes.

806
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,750
Do you still have that book 
I gave you the other night..?

807
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,541
Is it still there ?

808
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:27,458
Yeah, it's here. 
Please, come.

809
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:47,250
Do you have the CCTV footage of that night?

810
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,625
And you are?

811
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,375
Do you have more footages?

812
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,791
No madam, this is it.

813
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:10,208
Hello. Tell me, Diamond.

814
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,208
Madam, I got the ransom 
call recordings.

815
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:14,208
I've mailed them to you. 
Please check.

816
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,083
Your daughter is with me

817
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:26,208
By 9 a.m tomorrow 
You must be ready

818
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,833
I'll call again

819
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,500
You heard the recordings, right?

820
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,791
Did you notice the difference? 
There are two different voices.

821
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:38,708
Yes

822
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,833
Why didn't you mention this earlier? 
That two of them had called.

823
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:42,916
What if its two people?

824
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:46,333
The ones who've kidnapped my daughter had called.

825
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,750
I don't think so

826
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,458
Two people have called you, Ma'am.

827
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:55,166
Out of the two, the first caller 
was from Bengaluru.

828
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,458
And the call was made from a stolen phone.

829
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,208
Ma'am, did you notice the recordings?

830
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
He is stammering.

831
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,625
He is the one who had 
hacked phones and called you.

832
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,666
We've given the money, 
to the second caller.

833
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:10,333
Yeah, two people from the same 
gang have called. So what?

834
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,208
If its the same gang, 
why is one call from a stolen phone,

835
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,750
And the other 
from a hacked phone?

836
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,958
For this reason, they've done it. 
You're confused aren't you?

837
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,333
They've done it, 
to confuse us.

838
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:26,125
No sir

839
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:31,166
They must've known about the kidnapping, 
and then made the call.

840
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,250
If I hadn't listened to you

841
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,333
I could've seen my daughter.

842
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,041
If I listen to you now

843
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,583
I may never see her again.

844
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:44,916
No

845
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:45,583
Yes

846
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,416
How did you get these recordings?

847
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,541
That telecom guy gave them to you?

848
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,916
should have him suspended.

849
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:59,750
Have you checked the files? 
Is the Report-work, done yet?

850
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,916
First finish the work you've been assigned.

851
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,333
Stop behaving like Sherlock Holmes.

852
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:06,500
Listen

853
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,541
Finish the house burglary report.

854
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:12,000
And send them to me by tonight.

855
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,333
Go on. Do your work.

856
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
The inspector is asking 
if the house-burglary report is ready?

857
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:43,250
I'm working on it. 
Will send it across.

858
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:27,583
What do you guys do? 
Sir, I rob houses.

859
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,791
How many of you were involved?

860
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,750
Me and three of my friends

861
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,625
- Their names? 
- Venu, Madhu & David.

862
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,833
How did you do it?

863
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,666
Sir, I've told you

864
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:38,666
A guy used to call us.

865
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,666
He would tell us

866
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,666
the movement of the residents of the house

867
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:45,208
Then at a time set by him,

868
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,708
We'd go and rob, Sir.

869
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:50,375
Who is the guy who calls you?

870
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,500
I don't know sir.

871
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
He used to call us 
from different numbers every time.

872
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,166
What does he gain from this?

873
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:57,166
He asked us 
to open bank accounts

874
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,041
In our names 
took control of the ATM cards

875
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,958
We'd deposit his share, 
in that account, Sir.

876
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:04,166
He'd call from 
different numbers everyday.

877
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,166
How could I 
have known him?

878
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:08,625
I don't even know 
which city he's from.

879
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:10,791
Please let me go, Sir.

880
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
All these 8 houses' internet bills are from Air-Voice.

881
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,583
Can you check what their mobile network is?

882
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,958
Tell me the phone numbers, Madam.

883
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,958
All these numbers belong to Air-Voice.

884
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,333
What about Mrs. Gupta. 
Is it Air-Voice too?

885
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:49,500
Yes, Madam. 
That's why I have been sent from Air Voice.

886
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,875
- And their internet connection? 
-It's Air-Voice, Madam.

887
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,375
The bills from these 8 houses,

888
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:58,708
They're all from the house-burglary case.

889
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:01,375
The network users use Air Voice.

890
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,250
And Mrs. Gupta, does she use Air-Voice as well?

891
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,375
Yes, Air-Voice.

892
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,333
then..

893
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:10,333
The 2 ransom calls, 
made to the Guptas.

894
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:11,916
from Chandigarh and Chennai.

895
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,958
Can you please check 
the network connection of those numbers?

896
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,458
The numbers are all 
from Air-Voice, Madam.

897
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,791
What I'm saying right now 
may or may not be true.

898
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,791
I think 
an employee from Air Voice,

899
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,083
Has hacked these numbers.

900
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,083
After hacking,

901
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:31,208
He finds out the movement of the residents.

902
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,250
And then he robs those houses.

903
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:37,708
And maybe the same person

904
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,708
hacked Mrs Gupta's phone

905
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,666
to rob them.

906
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:44,208
And I think, 
that's when he found out,

907
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:46,791
that Mr. Gupta's daughter has been kidnapped.

908
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,875
And then used

909
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:51,833
this situation to his advantage

910
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,875
But the actual kidnapper

911
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:55,416
Did not ask for any money. Why?

912
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,000
Maybe they're all 
part of the same gang, Madam.

913
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,250
Is there anything else that's common between

914
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,375
Mr Gupta's house and the burgled houses?

915
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
Maybe the installation guy or

916
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Someone from the call center

917
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,500
Or maybe the service engineers?

918
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:12,916
No, madam. Its not possible to find out now.

919
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:13,791
But I can tell you once I get to office tomorrow.

920
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,208
Why can't we go now?

921
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:17,333
Only the call centers 
will be open right now.

922
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,333
We won't find any information there.

923
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,333
Once I get to the office tomorrow, 
I can give you all the details.

924
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,583
Sign here

925
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:50,833
Give his clothes

926
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:51,458
Hey..

927
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:58,083
Go back to your village or else all 
the pending cases will fall on you

928
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:09,208
I guess he'll never learn

929
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,000
-Yes, Ma

930
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:10,625
-Yes, Get some milk on your way back

931
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,125
I'll get it

932
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,958
We've already given you 1 crore.

933
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:36,541
You said you would show us our daughter

934
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,166
But did not show her at all

935
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:39,500
1 crore?

936
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:41,333
I never asked for so much money

937
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,333
If you give me 15 lakhs, 
Your daughter will come back to you

938
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:50,500
-Who is it? 
-Yes, yes. We'll give the money. Where should we come?

939
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:55,166
Come to Majestic bus stand in 2 hours with the money

940
01:22:55,541 --> 01:23:01,250
But please, can I talk to my daughter just once. Please.

941
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:02,375
Tell me, Diamond

942
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:05,666
They just got another ransom call. 
I'll send you the recordings. Please check them.

943
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:12,541
Give me 15 lakhs and take your daughter

944
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:17,333
-This sounds like the first caller's voice, doesn't it? 
-Yes, madam

945
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:18,666
Which area did the call come from?

946
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:21,083
One second, I'll check, madam.

947
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,083
-I told you its two different people 
-Yeah

948
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:32,375
-Can you send the details I asked for quickly? 
-Okay madam

949
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,541
Your daughter is right here

950
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:41,541
She hasn't eaten anything all these days

951
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:47,166
I don't think she has the strength to talk

952
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,416
But, i'll give it to her

953
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,250
If she talks to you, talk

954
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,416
Talk to me Aishu

955
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,791
Aishu, please talk to me

956
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,375
Is she speaking

957
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:22,625
I told you, she isn't in a condition to talk

958
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:28,708
Give me the money and take her

959
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,041
Ok, ok. We'll get the money

960
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,458
There was a call made again from the same area. 
He said the girl is with him.

961
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,208
I'll go check.

962
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,166
Is there any accused named Mani here?

963
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:47,208
I dont know madam. I'll have to check.

964
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,083
I want the records of all the petty thieves

965
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,083
I will take a look at it

966
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:14,166
We've been calling him Kunta for so 
long we didn't realise his real name was Mani

967
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,958
He just got released

968
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,458
Here's the register

969
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,333
You were the one who created a scene at the 
bar the other day, right?

970
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,500
Have you seen Kunta?

971
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Over There

972
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:53,666
Crowd chattering

973
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,041
was someone limping and running here?

974
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:50,083
He went that way

975
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:30,541
Why are you laughing?

976
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,083
Where's the girl?

977
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:24,625
What did you do to her?

978
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:44,666
I had got mouth cancer two years ago

979
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,708
I used to smoke a lot

980
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:52,000
So I quit smoking

981
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:59,500
But now I can’t talk without a beedi in my mouth

982
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,333
What have you done to the girl?

983
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:06,375
I didn't do anything. She was here when I left a while ago

984
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:16,333
I had tied her up. She didn't even have the 
strength to get up.

985
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,000
How many of you are involved in this kidnap? 
How did you do it?

986
01:29:20,166 --> 01:29:26,583
I don't know how they did it. 
My friend Prashant kidnapped her

987
01:29:28,416 --> 01:29:30,166
I was just looking after her

988
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:41,041
I did it because he said he’ll give me 15 lakhs 
once we release the girl

989
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:49,250
At the bar you said you didn't know Prashant

990
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:51,333
Why did he commit suicide?

991
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,875
I don’t know

992
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:58,875
I got to know about his death through the people in his home 
town

993
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:06,500
That girl was right here

994
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,916
I was supposed to get 15 lakhs

995
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:15,333
That's why

996
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:18,208
I called them

997
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:21,541
You called once. Why didn't you call all these days?

998
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:23,916
How could I?

999
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,250
For someone else's crime, they put me in the jail

1000
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:40,750
I got released today so I thought I’d 
Send the girl and take the ransom.

1001
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,458
How will you send her? Where is the girl?

1002
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:45,208
She was right here

1003
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:50,791
I had tied her up. You've seen 
it yourself, Madam.The door was open

1004
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:59,083
I found Mani. He said the girl was with him. 
But she's not here anymore

1005
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:05,625
There are few blood stains in his house. Get it checked. 
Inform the forensics and the inspector

1006
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,583
I'll send you the location now

1007
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:09,500
Madam, I checked the details

1008
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:14,375
In 8 houses that were robbed and in Gupta's house, the WiFi 
was installed by the same guy

1009
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:17,250
And he also worked in customer care

1010
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,916
He quit his job a week ago

1011
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,791
I'll send you his photo and address. Please check them.

1012
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,583
Madam, this is the house.

1013
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,958
I asked around. They’ve gone out somewhere

1014
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:32,416
He is the reason for all this drama.

1015
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,541
Do you know?

1016
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:48,791
The girl was kidnapped by Prashant

1017
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:55,583
-But do you know who asked him to do it?

1018
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,250
Her father

1019
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:06,125
I told her about it this morning

1020
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:09,875
Do you know why?

1021
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:16,541
Because the girl kept saying that 
her father will come to save her

1022
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,666
I couldn't bare it

1023
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:23,458
So I told her the truth

1024
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:28,708
I dont know why he did such a thing, Madam.

1025
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,208
My apartment

1026
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:32,875
the same one Prashant committed suicide in

1027
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:36,791
In that apartment, 80% of the flats are still empty

1028
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,750
No one's buying it

1029
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:43,166
My money is flowing out of my hand like water

1030
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:47,458
But

1031
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:49,500
I have another huge land

1032
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,250
I wanted to sell that land

1033
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:55,583
And compensate for the loss incurred in this apartment

1034
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:58,041
Two years ago

1035
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,791
The government came up with a scheme

1036
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,333
To rejuvenate all the dried up lakes

1037
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:09,916
When people found out that my land 
also was a lake, no one wanted to buy it.

1038
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:13,333
Okay

1039
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:17,041
I thought I'll build an apartment myself

1040
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:20,416
But

1041
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:24,208
The area's MLA and the BBMP officials

1042
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:28,916
Didn't give me the permission to build

1043
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,250
I tried really hard

1044
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:37,583
They asked for 50% of the projects value as commission to 
grant permission

1045
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,916
How will I give?

1046
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:43,333
I used my political influence as well

1047
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:50,958
And then I had a thought

1048
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:55,458
What if I become the MLA?

1049
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:03,916
But people don't know who I am

1050
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:06,791
They know my company

1051
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,708
Gupta Builders

1052
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,250
But they don't know me. They don't recognise my face.

1053
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:17,333
I've done a lot of charity work -social service, 
donated books to children. I've done it all

1054
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:25,166
But that wasn't enough for people to sympathise with me.

1055
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,875
The media should find out in 2 days

1056
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,083
Newspapers will report it

1057
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:36,166
TV channels will talk about it

1058
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:39,958
After that, my daughter Aishu will come back to me

1059
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:44,333
After she comes back everyone will question as to who did it

1060
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:47,791
My name shouldn't come up at any cost

1061
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,750
You surrender

1062
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:52,333
Confess that you did it

1063
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,916
And if they ask why you did it

1064
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:59,833
Tell that MLA Shivakumar asked you to do it

1065
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,416
Sir, you betrayed me

1066
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:05,625
If I go to the prison, will you get me out?

1067
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,541
I know you very well

1068
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:11,625
Imagine. My photos will be 
everywhere and world will call me a criminal

1069
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:13,041
Not only that

1070
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:16,333
People will talk about it to my parents

1071
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,708
What have they done, sir?

1072
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:24,375
If I accuse the MLA for the kidnapping, 
Would he spare me?

1073
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:27,208
I'm already a dead man

1074
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:29,875
Then why should I live ?

1075
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:36,125
And that’s why I am going to die, 
Try to find your daughter if you can.

1076
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:53,791
Hello madam, we checked the blood samples, 
It is matching with Aishwarya’s blood group

1077
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,916
It'll take some time to get the DNA reports

1078
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,875
But the inspector got the news 
He's on his way to Gupta's house

1079
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,416
Ok madam

1080
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:18,750
We found the place where your 
daughter was kept. But she's not there anymore

1081
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,666
Only her blood stains are there

1082
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:28,500
For a little bit of fame and money, you 
kidnapped your own daughter?

1083
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:47,583
Madam, I doubt this is our guy. 
He looks innocent.

1084
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:07,083
I doubt he has 1 crore with him.

1085
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,750
Come in

1086
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:30,625
Please, come in

1087
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:39,041
Sorry, this is my daughter's work

1088
01:37:39,041 --> 01:37:43,333
Just out of curiosity, how did you figure it out?

1089
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:51,375
8 houses burglary

1090
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:53,750
I was the service engineer for all the 8 houses

1091
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,083
I didn't know the police were so smart to solve it

1092
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:05,208
Forget that. What would you like to drink? Coffee? Tea?

1093
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,583
It's not very difficult to make money

1094
01:38:20,583 --> 01:38:23,583
Think a little out of the box

1095
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:29,208
Do you have any idea how helpless 
a man is when he has no money?

1096
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:34,500
That's why I decided.

1097
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:36,666
I started stealing.

1098
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,625
But who did I steal from?

1099
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:43,750
They're all poisonous demons

1100
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:47,333
When they breathe, there's only drought

1101
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:51,375
Each one of them is Vritrasura (God of drought)

1102
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,750
You may not see it

1103
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:58,541
But when you see from my 
perspective, you'll understand

1104
01:38:58,916 --> 01:39:01,916
Its not a dragon, Ma. 
It's a demon called Vrithra

1105
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:06,125
It was me

1106
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:07,875
He is a demon

1107
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,708
who kidnaps his own daughter for fame and power.

1108
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,458
What's wrong if I steal from him?

1109
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:15,958
Who benefits from all of this?

1110
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,458
When you were waiting outside my house

1111
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:23,041
there was a delivery boy there

1112
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,666
Did you notice?

1113
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:27,125
7th cross builders house robbery

1114
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:29,791
That money got him the bike

1115
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,166
And that bike got him a job

1116
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,500
and the job settled his life

1117
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:38,333
And someone else got a tailoring machine

1118
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,416
In someone's house there was a baby shower

1119
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,666
There was no tension

1120
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:44,416
I went to get back my wife’s gold which 
we had mortgaged

1121
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:46,708
But I couldn't.

1122
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:50,083
She would be very happy if she’d got the jewellery back

1123
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:53,333
But if she asks me where I got the money from

1124
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:56,083
What would I say?

1125
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,000
He's not the guy

1126
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:09,875
I had told you, Madam

1127
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:12,125
You can leave. I'll go by cab.

1128
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:19,541
Ma, since childhood I've always wanted 
to learn new things

1129
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:23,125
solve crime cases, catch criminals

1130
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:33,083
And to pursue that I joined the crime branch

1131
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:37,666
But I learnt one thing

1132
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:41,125
to solve cases and catch criminals

1133
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:51,500
Hey, hey don't jump to any conclusions.

1134
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,333
I don't even know who this girl is.

1135
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:58,500
Just like hacking everyone else's phone, 
I hacked her mom's phone too

1136
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,875
That's when I found out she had been kidnapped

1137
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:04,708
Then I got an idea

1138
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,666
I found a way to make money

1139
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:09,750
You were the one who got me 1 crore rupees

1140
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:14,125
i might look like a criminal from your perspective

1141
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:17,000
But I have conscience too

1142
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,916
I started to worry about what happened to this girl

1143
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:26,625
Just like how you worked hard to find this 
girl, I too worked hard to find her

1144
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,833
I found the girl two hours before 
you did

1145
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:46,541
My dad never restricted me

1146
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:50,125
And I never disobeyed him

1147
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
In fact, I studied abroad for my masters

1148
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,458
to support him in his business.

1149
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:15,125
Lie

1150
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:16,500
Everything was a lie

1151
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:25,000
My wounded heart can never be healed

1152
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:27,916
impossible

1153
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:34,166
I want to find myself

1154
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:38,166
I want to live my life on my terms

1155
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:50,375
The money is here, I'm also here

1156
01:43:53,416 --> 01:43:55,708
You did all of this for your selfish motives

1157
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:58,166
and now you are preaching about moral high grounds?

1158
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:03,416
Haven't you ever felt what you did was wrong?

1159
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:09,041
What's right? What's wrong?

1160
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:11,791
Selfishness is in human nature

1161
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,166
When a mother feeds her child

1162
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,041
Its because of the selfishness to see the child smile

1163
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:22,250
There's nothing without selfishness here

1164
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,250
But the only difference is

1165
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:26,666
Some people’s selfish motives does good

1166
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,500
but some people’s selfish motives destroys everything.

1167
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:33,000
If people benefit out of my selfishness

1168
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,625
I can do whatever it takes

1169
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:40,208
I don't have the habit of feeling guilty unnecessarily.

1170
01:44:41,333 --> 01:44:43,125
I did what I felt was right

1171
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:47,916
You do what you feel is right.

1172
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:52,041
You said you don't have the habit of feeling guilty.

1173
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,666
Then why are you explaining yourself so much?

1174
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,416
You should know what you've done is right or wrong

1175
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:26,458
What have you done to Gupta?

1176
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:28,500
He's gone mad

1177
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,333
I didn't take any money from him

1178
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:34,333
He's not in a condition to talk

1179
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:39,666
This is just for your reference, Sir

1180
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:42,666
I've already sent a copy to the commissioner's office

1181
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:52,250
What is this? Have you gone crazy?

1182
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:55,541
Just because you can't handle a 
case, you're resigning?

1183
01:45:55,541 --> 01:45:58,000
You are being immature.

1184
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,791
Don't you know how hard it is to get a job here?

1185
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:05,791
You should make use of the 
opportunities you get. But you...
