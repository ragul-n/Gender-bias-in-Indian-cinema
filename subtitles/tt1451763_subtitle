1
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,873
Fear is foolishness.

2
00:00:50,017 --> 00:01:06,593
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

3
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:13,068
Fear is foolishness.

4
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,569
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,008
Fear is foolishness.

6
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,578
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

7
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,016
Death is inevitable.

8
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:33,951
it's our duty to protect the nation.

9
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,523
Fear is foolishness.

10
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,724
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

11
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:51,608
from the womb,
mother impact braveness to the child.

12
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:58,616
Son will raise to save the honor of
mother in times of distress.

13
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,118
Fear is foolishness.

14
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,448
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

15
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:19,735
People may come and go.
Who has won the heart of people?

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:26,778
Great Warriors and people
who sacrifice lives for honor.

17
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,143
Fear is foolishness.

18
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,781
Fearlessness is true Dravidian trait.

19
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,458
Joseph, an important matter
is up for discussion...

20
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,500
Come to my room.

21
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:52,995
This was sent by Interpol.

22
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,541
Raka is a kingpin in
international weapon smuggling.

23
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,678
He gave a slip to Scotland Yard too.

24
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:06,009
We've information that he's coming to Tuticorin
in a cargo ship on Wednesday at 10.30 am.

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,713
If we catch him,
we can smash his entire network.

26
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,618
This is top secret.

27
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:16,985
If our plan leaks out, his own men
may eliminate him themselves.

28
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,690
So, be alert.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,896
Don't worry, sir.

30
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,196
Tamil Nadu police boasts of officers
who can outsmart Scotland yard.

31
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,733
We will catch Raka alive.

32
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,033
- Best of Luck.
- Thank you, sir.

33
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,576
We are doing a special program
.Heroes, for pongal.

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,145
We are going to ask people
about their favorite heroes.

00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:37,971

36
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,709

00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,546
Our Leader is the next president!

39
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,213
Your hero...?

40
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,892
My favorite hero is MGR.

41
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,602
His actions scenes are...

42
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,568
if I command...

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,244
And if it comes true...

44
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,579
I Like him very much.

45
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,119
Great! Thanks a Iot, mother.

46
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,013
Son, I've a Iot more to say...

47
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,251
- I'll talk about another man too.

48
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,721
When my granddaughter was
kidnapped by goons last week,

49
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,922
A dashing young man made grand entry.

50
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,198
Who is he?

51
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,274
Is he Superman or Spiderman?

52
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,638
He is a Pokkiri (rogue)!

53
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:02,928
Be careful,
'Villu' (archer) is a dangerous man.

54
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,576
Be careful,
'Villu' (archer) is a dangerous man.

55
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,611
Wow!.

56
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,078
- Leave me!
- Hey, why are you Laughing?

57
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,981
Aren't we looking like goons?

58
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,987
Laughing again?

59
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,149
Is my boss Looking Like a joker?

60
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,787
- Hey, are you his man or ours?
- No, boss.

61
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,987
He has come alone.

62
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,827
Is he Bruce Lee or Jet Li?

63
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,994
I'm Ghilli, man.

64
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,709
Next!

65
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,034
Brother, save me..

66
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,078
Grandma...

67
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,940
I Like him too very much.

68
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,810
May God bless him.

69
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,446
- Did you check mail?
- yes.

70
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,752
you know what to do.

71
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:42,147
I asked bow from lord Rama.

72
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,154
I asked mace from Bheema.

73
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:56,394
I asked bow to lord Rama.
I asked mace from Bheema.

74
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,464

Here comes 'Villu'

78
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:20,149
Dare to face him.

79
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:27,894
'Villu' means joy...

80
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,036
I asked bow from lord Rama..

81
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:35,037
I asked mace from Bheema.

82
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,252
'Villu' is sharp.

83
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,221
'Villu' is a right man.

84
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:54,123
'Villu' is stupendous.

85
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,194
'Villu' is epitome of bravery.

86
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:04,297
Let's live together like school children
without any barriers of caste.

87
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:10,102
Let's live without fear like Tigers.

88
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,109
There are many here with
fame and goodwill.

89
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,146
Who has 'victory' as his name like me?

90
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:20,946
if God asks me, "what do you want"'?

91
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,456
I'll ask for a country of their own for
the people who are left as refugees.

92
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,585
Here comes 'Villu'

93
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,625
Dare to face him.

97
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,986
Toil hard every day.

98
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,998
you can sleep peacefully
without comforts.

99
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,035
Help others without publicity.

100
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,695
feel like you're in heaven.

101
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,669
Teachings of Bharathi can
awaken the womenfolk.

102
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,670
Read Karl Marx and eyes will turn red.

103
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,415
if you respect Periyar,
social justice will come on it's own.

104
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:04,213

105
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,350
Here comes 'Villu'

Dare to face him.

I asked bow from lord Rama..

109
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,437
I asked mace from Bheema.

110
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:06,539
Sir.

111
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,743
- Have You blocked the roads?
- Everything is ready, sir.

112
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,147
- Raka can't escape.
- Good.

113
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,313
All of you be alert.

114
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,067
yes.

115
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:47,815
Who are you?

116
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,650
Police have besieged the place.

117
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,156
Where?

118
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,432
Look at their feet.

119
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,166
Police shoes..

120
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,500
If you want to escape from here,
just follow me.

121
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,573
Hey, lift that container.

122
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,380
No... don't shoot..
We want him alive.

123
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,676
Round up the place with men.

124
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:18,446
Be careful,
'Villu' is a dangerous man!

125
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,426
Look before...

126
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,637
Thanks.

127
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,403
My policy is to kill the man,
once the job is done.

128
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,513
My policy is to first kill
the man to finish the job.

129
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,586
Operation success!

130
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,333
Why did you bungle?

131
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,529
- Sir...
- yes.

132
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,503
- Sir, we have an eye witness.
- Bring him here.

133
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,342
Come...

134
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,871
- Are you fine?
- yes, I'm fine.

135
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,009
Okay, tell me,
what did you see there?

136
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,877
I saw with my two eyes...

137
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,975
Lord Ganesha came and rescued him.

138
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,948
Were you drunk then?

139
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,555
No sir. Lord was in water.

140
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,489
Idiot! I asked, were you in the sea?

141
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,788
No, sir. I was on the shore.

142
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,693
But Lord Ganesha was swimming
backstroke in the sea.

143
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,494
- Stupid!
- Right sir.

144
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,498
Take him away.

145
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,897
I don't know what you will do.

146
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,365
you have to catch Raka.

147
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,703
- He should not cross our area.
- yes sir.

148
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,641
VAYALLUR

149
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,910
Lift please...

150
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,719
Hello, lift please...
Hello, turban....

151
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,050
Hey stupid! Are you blind?

152
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,029
- Why did you stop?
- See the left.

153
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,432
you sing very well, brother.

154
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,562
The entire country is slave
to my golden voice.

155
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,469
Hey, are you getting or bringing me down?

156
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,611
Where is my cart?

157
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,715
- Brother, look here..
- you stupid...

158
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,878
How skillfully he made it.

159
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:41,815
It's okay.

160
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,817
- Where are you going?
- To attend a marriage.

161
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,456
Whose marriage?

162
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,488
To attend revenue officer's
daughter's marriage.

163
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,752
- I'm also going there.
- Really?

164
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,396
It's enough, it's seems never ending.

165
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,434
- I have to drive the cart..
- Please go ahead.

166
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,063
Go... go...

167
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,465
Are you taking all this to prepare
a delicacy 'Kolaputtu'?

168
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,907
Are you kidding me?
It's a radio set.

169
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,572
I'm the lone supplier of radio set
for any function here.

170
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,481
My cone speakers will echo
in the mountains too.

171
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,417
- Can this cone produce so much sound?
- yes....

172
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,655
Oh my God!

173
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,040
Why did you do this to me?

174
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,567
I offered you help, didn't l?

175
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,043
Why did you try to bury me?

176
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,704
Is it your gift for offering a lift?

177
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,982
Hey, why are you looking up
when I'm talking to you?

178
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,056
Is there anything funny to watch?

179
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,689
- Mike....
- Don't say a word...

180
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,191
Arrange everything properly
and clean me too.

181
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:48,244
Why it is so big?
Did you look above for this?

182
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,044
I'll...

183
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:59,021
I was standing in the mango grove.
He asked me if I need a mango...I said no...

184
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,089
May I come?

185
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:17,532
Hubby, he has seen me...

186
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,647
Don't watch the show?
Come and save...

187
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,640
Escaped?!

188
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,574
Hubby...

189
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:31,280
He has seen me...

190
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,257
- Who is he?
- He is my husband.

191
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,088
Hey, who is it?

192
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:43,295
Oh no! The way he's rushing,
I think I'm in for a thrashing.

193
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,996
How long have you been watching me?

194
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,163
Don't go on say I had seen you...
it's giving me shivers...

195
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:54,637
Sir, nothing happened as you're
imagining...Oh my god!

196
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:05,681
- Hey Jahnavi, come here...
- No...

197
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,329
Who is she?

198
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,626
What happened?

199
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,699
Fishes may got bored biting local girls,

200
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,032
so they are bursting with excitement
on seeing a girl from abroad.

201
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,232
you used to handle snakes in college.

202
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:59,701
Why are you afraid of fishes now?

203
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,212
Hey look there... oh my God!

204
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:06,915
Carefully...

205
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:10,718
Who is this?

206
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,224
- My lover!
- What?

207
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,181
Isn't he very handsome?

208
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,191
So I thought of making him my lover.

209
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,928
Is there any doctor nearby, Jyothi?

210
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,067
Hey, first check if he is alive?

211
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,233
He's alive.

212
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,067
Thank God! I got back my life.

213
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,039
Hey, first press his stomach.

214
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,843
Why isn't he spitting out water?

215
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,678
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
can bring back the life.

216
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,086
- Do it yourself...
- No, I won't...

217
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,283
I'm getting married next week...
no way!

218
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:51,856
Oh no! How can we do with
her marriage next week?

219
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,230
Hey Jahnavi, it's not a sin in emergency.

220
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,095
It's common in foreign, isn't it?

221
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,865
- You do it...
- She is right. You do this...

222
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,282
Oh my God!

223
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,120
A lotus is kissing lips.

224
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,991
A new wave of electricity is
generated in the body.

225
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,165
Poor soul! Look how his life
is struggling to survive.

226
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,817
Hey cheat! Don't act too smart..
get up...

227
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,154
Look at him...how he is staring...

228
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,818
Stupid... idiot... nonsense...
scoundrel... you...

229
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,759
What the hell you think about me, rascal?

230
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,823
Are you crazy?

231
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:08,337
you useless illiterate goon.

232
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,839
Do you have a brain?

233
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,342
How dare you?
I'll kill you.

234
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:19,950
you country brute.
I'll slap you.

235
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,017
I'll make you stand in shoes.

236
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,849
I'll cut you into pieces.

237
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,154
I'll gun you down.

238
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,854
Never...ever come next to me.

239
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,967
you understand.

240
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,461
Go to hell.
you loser!.

241
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,804
you...

242
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,179
Thank you.

243
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,408
Don't know where am I going?

244
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,878
O God! I shouldn't hit any
waterfalls in the way.

245
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,091
Hello...

246
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,401
yes, tell me...

247
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,065
Hello...

248
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,029
Oh my God!

249
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,407
- Hello...
- Hello....

250
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,272
No signal.

251
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,040
- Hello...
- Hello....

252
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,081
He seems to be a mad man.

253
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,251
- Hello...
- Hello...

254
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,361
Sir, you...?

255
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,420
Pugal.

256
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,527
joseph told me everything
about you on phone.

257
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,390
Please come in.

258
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,267
Looks like you've arranged
a grand marriage.

259
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,597
First marriage in the family.

260
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,109
Kiss... kiss... Krishna...

261
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,607
Sit down.

262
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,115
It's him only.

263
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,319
That rascal has come here also.

264
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,614
R-A-s-C-A-L!

265
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:05,281
Are you a buffalo or cow?

266
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,146
I meant the milk...

267
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,982
- Cow...
- I'm Buffalo.

268
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,288
Get one cow's milk coffee
and one buffalo milk coffee.

269
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,623
you must have food.
your room is bathroom...

270
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,290
I mean your room is
opposite bathroom.

271
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll show you how nasty I can be.

272
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:21,963
Have this and take bath and freshen up.

273
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,005
Our homemade idlies are
very soft and tender.

274
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,641
Be ready with 2 softies,
I'll come back.

275
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,243
I laughed.

276
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,006
Inform me before you laugh.

277
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,246
- I'm going to laugh again.
- oh my God!

278
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,115
First, I'll break his waist.

279
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,101
It's a sparking fire...

280
00:27:53,272 --> 00:28:01,609
I'm a young commander...I'm great...

281
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:02,943
Oh no!

282
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,944
I'm a free bird.

283
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,129
- Good morning, sister.
- Good morning brother.

284
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,558
I'll have a peaceful bath.

285
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,230
you have made my head turn conical.

286
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,170
you scoundrel!

287
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,673
- jyothi...
- What?

288
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,307
you switch off the main.

289
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,307
Why?

290
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,178
Have you seen fully?

291
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,043
Shit! Do what I say!

292
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,053
- oh God!
- Hey Jyothi...

293
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,389
Switch it on only when I give a whistle.

294
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,525
As you say.

295
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:58,228
Are you singing?

296
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,067
It's very hot....

297
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:11,705
Wait...I'll rip out your skin
with this hot water...

298
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:20,081
1...2...3...Oh no!

299
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:28,555
What's it brother?

300
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,758
- Taking stream bath?
- Made me fall into the ditch I dug for you.

301
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,269
Forget about this,
I forgot to bring the soap, get it.

302
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:50,048
Are you asking me to get the soap?
I'll fix you now.

303
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,283
Watch now,
what am I going to do to you.

304
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,434
God!

305
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:12,766
Me?

306
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:16,670
Me...?

307
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,809
Don't rush,
I'll close the door.

308
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,311
you don't want me to...

309
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:24,779
I'll come right away.

310
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,115
She scolded me a little while ago
but inviting me now.

311
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,462
Look how crazy she is!

312
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,792
I just can't understand these girls.

313
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:43,706
Soap!

314
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,337
Oh my God!

315
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,143
Why am I hearing
an old woman's shriek?

316
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,439
Will you please get up?

317
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:56,872
Where's he?

318
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,443
Look down, not up above!

319
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,387
Brother! What are you doing down there?

320
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:07,214
I'm having fun!
- Get up, you fool!- okay.

321
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,222
Sleeping on me?

322
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,918
- Brother, take good rest.
- Where is he?

323
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,271
How nasty my life has become...

324
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,454
Everything is going against me.

325
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,886
- How many?
- just one!

326
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,559
just one? Want him dead or alive?

327
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,225
Want him as living dead or dead living?

328
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,304
- or else make him a vegetable...?
- No...no...

329
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,734
Don't go to that extent, he must
shudder on hearing my name.

330
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:58,772
Cool!

331
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,267
Look there, it's him!

332
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,780
- He looks like a boy.
- Come.

333
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,318
Do we need a lorry to crush an ant?

334
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,356
Start the vehicle!

335
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,260
How many times I've told you
not to stand next to me?

336
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,657
It's paining me. Go!

337
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,696
The hand that beats will only embrace.

338
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,868
It's comfortable to lie on you.

339
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,845
Follow the leader and
it's success all the way.

340
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,311
Isn't there anyone?
I'm suffering alone here.

341
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,320
Isn't there anyone here to help me?

342
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,289
- I hear someone's cries...
- Don't you know?

343
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,796
It seems somebody hired goons
to beat up Pugal badly.

344
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,730
Poor man is on the
verge of death in fear.

345
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,870
Looks like he may not survive this night.

346
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,872
Oh my God!
I hired the goons to beat him up.

347
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,705
Bloody girl! say sorry to him
before he breathes his last.

348
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:08,835
Go!

349
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,344
Great leader!

350
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,027
Please don't beat me...spare me...

351
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,361
Please don't get scared.

352
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,725
- Who is it?
- it's me.

353
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:36,505
I heard you say something but the
thrashing I got has left me dazed.

354
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,066
Can you come little closer?

355
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,060
- you look like Jahnavi?
- it's me Jahnavi!

356
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,891
No, you're the devil who tried to
kill me by drowning in water.

357
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,636
No, you're the devil who tried to
kill me by drowning in water.

358
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,602
No...no...I hired goons
just to scare you.

359
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,372
But you're talking about killing...

360
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,881
They scared life out of me.

361
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,545
Don't cry no.

362
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,787
I did it just for fun...

363
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,119
Come my leader.

364
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,626
your fun has put my life in danger.

365
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:41,130
The fatal fever has returned
into my life again.

366
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,400
My mother said it was a wonder
to have survived earlier.

367
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,505
I'll not survive this time.

368
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,636
- Mother...
- What?

369
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,941
Who called you?
I called my mother.

370
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,986
Mother, I'm also coming to
the place you're now.

371
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:03,586
Oh my mother...I'm coming...

372
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,020
What happened?
Why are you shouting like this?

373
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,161
Oh my God!
I'm having severe chest pain!

374
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,833
Excuse me, if you don't mind...

375
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,531
Can I apply this balm?

376
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,166
- Saroja Devi! Take out your wares!
- What happened?

377
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,810
A girl mustn't apply it to a boy,
I said it in Hindi.

378
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,149
It's okay, it's not a sin in emergency.

379
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,147
you feel like that?

380
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,024
Apply on heart.

381
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,193
Heart is on the left side, right?

382
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,534
It's changing places for the stick I got.

383
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,695
For safer side, apply on both the sides.

384
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,469
Apply!

385
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,542
Apply!

386
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,882
If I knew you would apply so lovingly...

387
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:07,150
...I would've hurt my limbs too.

388
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,827
Oh my God!

389
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,189
- What happened?
- Severe headache.

390
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:15,053
I feel sleeping in your lap
will give some relief.

391
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,196
Did you call me?

392
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:29,011
Thank you very much, leader!

393
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:53,934
Excuse me.

394
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,706
Thank you very much.

395
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,777
Even after a good bath the balm
is still lingering on me.

396
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,938
Poor girl! She's very innocent.

397
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,779
I'm telling her all white lies,
even mad won't believe them,

398
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,079
but she believed them.

399
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,216
- She believes whatever anyone says.
- He's caught!

400
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,152
I beat his two hands with my cheeks.

401
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,633
I hit his legs with my stomach.

402
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,566
I kicked his shoes with my butt.

403
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,571
Oh my butt!

404
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,233
Lastly I held him tightly under my leash.

405
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,103
Then what?

406
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,647
- I didn't leave him.
- Leave me.

407
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,613
Promise not to beat me, I'll leave.

408
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,180
Spared life after falling at feet.

409
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:46,320
If I ever see you again here...

410
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,121
Thanks a lot.

411
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,283
But how come you're hurt?

412
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,027
It's happens in politics.

413
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,629
Excuse me, I need Rs.5000
for hospital expenses.

414
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,832
For him. Poor man!

415
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,665
Take it.

416
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,705
Bloody!

417
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,668
you made a little mistake in the props.

418
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,643
If you'd replaced the tea
with milk and fruits...

419
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,309
What?

420
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,952
- Look behind...
- I'll....

421
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,285
- Snake?
- No, ghost!

422
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,350
I'm vanishing!

423
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,964
- Hello!
- Hello...hello...

424
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:31,795
Watch now, what I'm going to do now!

425
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,800
Why isn't the caller responding?

426
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:39,031
Save me...please save me.

427
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,172
Save...?

428
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,377
Hey control...

429
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,248
Who needs help?

430
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,723
Hey stop! I'll not spare you!
you fool! Stop!

431
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,029
She poured paint on me
and dares scold me too.

432
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,899
Country brute!

433
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,879
- Mummy!
- Daddy!

434
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,011
Get lost!

435
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,931
Oh my God!

436
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,431
We've reached the destination,
will you please get down?

437
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:48,767
Get down! Get down I say!

438
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,142
Oh my God!

439
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,781
What's the noise here?

440
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,322
Sixer!

441
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:23,737
- I want my ball.
- it's in the well, take it.

442
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:27,746
Fish it out for me.
- Stay out from me.- I want my ball.

443
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,318
I'll take care of myself.

444
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,756
Come, I'll fish it out for you.

445
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:39,192
- Bloody boy and his ball.
- I want my ball.

446
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,488
Shut up!

447
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:44,833
What's the problem?

448
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,095
- Ball fell into the well.
- Ball?

449
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,171
Why are you crying holding
her dress for that?

450
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,830
What if it comes down?

451
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,130
It's just a ball not your father, right?

452
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,869
Calm down, uncle will get
your ball out of the well.

453
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,212
- I can't see anything.
- Go inside and see.

454
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,379
Found the ball?

455
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,380
- Go away boy.
- Save me...save me...

456
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,985
Catch this bucket!

457
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,229
Hold it tightly.

458
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:35,315
What's going on here?

459
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,821
Brother, you are wet,
got wet in rain?

460
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,150
Take the towel,
dry yourself and come out.

461
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,830
It happened like this.

462
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,902
It's a simple thing,
why take so much trouble for this?

463
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,563
Come, I'll teach you how to lift.

464
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,503
Catch it.

465
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,244
Pull it.

466
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:15,584
Catch here.

467
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,450
Pull it.

468
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,026
Pull it.

469
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,083
Learnt it?

470
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,896
What's going on here?

471
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,163
I've come up.

472
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,962
- I'll try this time
- Can I leave it now?

473
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,957
Bloody bugger...

474
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,595
Come on, beau!

475
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:30,196
Shall we play volley ball in the plantain grove?

476
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:37,334
Shall we have fun in between passes?

477
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,170
- Below the nose.
- it's teeth.

478
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,970
Kiss me.

479
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,636
if I bite.

480
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,504
you shouldn't shout.

481
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,344
With your upper cloth.

482
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,179
Hide yourself.

483
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,015
The thorn may prick you.

484
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,951
But it won't hurt you.

485
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,489
_ How come?
_ just like that!

486
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,353
Come on, beau!

487
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:01,191
Shall we play volley ball in the plantain grove?

488
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:08,199
Shall we have fun in between passes?

489
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:12,704
Don't angry me.

490
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,205
Bad Girl.

491
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,555
Attack the black guy!

492
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:40,560
jump!

493
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,561
Shall I wear a micro mini and do a cat walk?

494
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:08,095
Shall I sing "what's behind the blouse?"

495
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,723
I don't want English or Hindi song.

496
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:15,400
Sing a Tamil folk song.

497
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,097
There 's sky... clouds.

498
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,609
And a playful moon.

499
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,645
_ How come?
_ just like that!

500
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,107
Come on, beau!

501
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:33,450
Shall we play volley ball in the plantain grove?

502
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:40,291
Shall we have fun in between passes?

503
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:09,649
Sing, dear.

504
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,319
Shall I offer joy and pleasures of life to you?

505
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,660
Shall I flow like Niagara falls on you?

506
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,666
I'm happy hearing your words.

507
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,427
if you teach me,
I'll be more happy.

508
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:24,165
if you come like the river Cauvery,
I'll be the happiest man.

509
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,606
With January comes...
new ways will open up.

510
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:31,374
on the pongal day...
Marry me!

511
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:33,106
_ How come?
_ just like that.

512
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,842
Come on, beau!

513
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:39,451
Shall we play volley ball in the plantain grove?

514
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:47,688
Shall we have fun in between passes?

515
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,858
I'll ball you!

516
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,136
you...

517
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,574
Why is it smoking?
oh my God!

518
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,183
Welcome... welcome...

519
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:17,759
- Has the groom experience in that too?
- No.. no...

520
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,319
- How can you protect my friend then?
- Not like that...

521
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,590
Why are you teasing the groom?
Clear out.

522
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,495
you come with me..

523
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,430
Hey, groom doesn't know anything.

524
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,261
- I'll teach him!
- you silly girl!

525
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,243
you promised to get your
daughter married to my brother.

526
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:37,504
Why did you change now?

527
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,672
I'd rejected your proposal, hadn't I?

528
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,549
I came to know your brother is a goon,
womanizer, drunkard and a jail bird.

529
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,518
We are not interested in your proposal.

530
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,419
A man will drink and take a concubine.

531
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,387
Why are you talking to him?

532
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,351
I'll kidnap the girl!

533
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,758
Hey, please get out from here...
I'll call the police.

534
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,798
Call the police.

535
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,431
Hey, who are you?
Leave her hand.

536
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,772
If anyone comes near me,
I'll chop them into pieces!

537
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,563
Move away.

538
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,400
Come with me.

539
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:10,610
Why are you simply watching?
Do something.

540
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,212
I'll give whatever you want.
Go and save her!

541
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,282
Come with me.

542
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:27,252
Here comes 'Villu'

543
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:30,897
Without knowing about me,
dared to stop my brother?

544
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,465
Brother, don't mouth dialogs...
Come and fight him!

545
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,468
Go man!

546
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:36,965
Will you give?

547
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,312
I will!

548
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,749
Hey, go.

549
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,652
Hey, you got paid.

550
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:14,059
Get lost, man!

551
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,564
He is breaking the bones.

552
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,527
O Lord Muruga!

553
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:46,534
you're the supreme,
Omnipotent...Omnipresent...

554
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,539
Be proud that your boss
got beaten up by a real man.

555
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,540
Go and celebrate.

556
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,944
Brother, thanks a lot.
May God bless you.

557
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,443
Pugal, thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it..

558
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,495
Invite them for our daughter's baby shower.
- okay.

559
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,068
- Bye.
- Bye.

560
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:25,066
- Has Jahnavi left to Chennai?
- She left early morning, Dad.

561
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,823
Ask anyone who is the Super Star?

562
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,985
Any child will answer this question.

563
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:52,603
Uttering your name will
enthuse the soul.

564
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:59,504
you must be wondering how to
save your crops from pests?

565
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:00,540
Don't worry.

566
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:06,114
Powder the dry Neem leaves
and bitter guard seeds,

567
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:11,114
mix 100 gms of it in one liter water,
and add 1 spoon of castor oil...

568
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,870
What's wrong with me?

569
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:37,036
Shit!

570
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,881
Something's really wrong with me.

571
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:52,660
Channels have worked out very well.

572
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,235
- Hello...
- Hello, it's me.

573
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,046
Pugal...?

574
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,081
Still remember me?

575
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,081
you left without informing me.
you promised to give me something.

576
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:22,685
It's alright.

577
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,592
I'm still wandering with your memories.

578
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:32,865
I see you in everyone I meet.
I see you in any TV channel.

579
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,938
I see your photo in the newspaper too.

580
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,599
Why is it happening to me?

581
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,604
I just can't understand.

582
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,217
I thought of telling you.
This is my number.

583
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:52,951
Call me if you've understood anything.

584
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:55,819
Hello...

585
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,639
I see him everywhere.

586
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,145
This is my number.

587
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,663
Why did you take so long to pick me up?
Tires are filled up, right?

588
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,661
I've used lorry tires, let's go.

589
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,992
Let's go fast.

590
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,193
What do you want to ask me?

591
00:55:41,704 --> 00:55:43,332
I'll come to the point straight.

592
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,770
She is the one I'm going to marry.

593
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,841
My father's great great grandfather and

594
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,182
her father's great great grandfather
were childhood friends.

595
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,623
To keep their friendship last long,
they had entered into an agreement.

596
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:10,065
According to that,

597
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,292
If a boy or a girl is born in my clan

598
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,968
and if a boy or a girl is born in her clan,

599
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:18,366
they agreed to perform their marriage.

600
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,966
Fate is so strange.

601
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,711
In both our families,

602
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,046
it was either boys or girls in both
our clans since then.

603
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,813
For the first time,

604
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:35,389
to my father's great great
grandfather's wish, myself, a boy,

605
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:40,354
and to her father's great great grandfather's
wish, she Poonkodi, a girl too was born,

606
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,824
and our wedding is to be held soon.

607
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,892
It's their decision.

608
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,995
I think you haven't understood what I said.

609
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,196
My father's great great grand father's wish...

610
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:53,401
Shall we drink?

611
00:56:55,344 --> 00:56:58,837
you said something.
But I think I heard it wrong.

612
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:05,250
- I said "shall we have drinks? ""
- Understood?

613
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,257
Tell me...

614
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,199
My father's great great...

615
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,097
your father's great great grandfather &

616
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,103
her father's great great grandfather
had an agreement.

617
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,297
According to that,

618
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,800
If a boy or a girl is born in your clan

619
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:30,377
and if a boy or a girl is born in her clan,

620
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,975
they agreed to perform get them married.

621
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,274
Fate is so strange.

622
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:37,819
It was either boys or girls in both
our families till now.

623
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,284
So, there were no marriages.

624
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,223
For the first time,

625
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:44,382
for your father's great great
grandfather's wish, myself, a boy,

626
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,060
and for her father's great great grandfather's
wish, this girl was born,

627
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,131
and the marriage agreed by the old men....

628
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:04,843
What's in your mind?

629
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:06,413
Tell me you, Madagascar.

630
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,082
My father's great great grandfather...

631
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,410
Excuse me.

632
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,087
I attained puberty at the age of 15.

633
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:19,819
Now I'm 21 years old.

634
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:22,521
- 16, 17...
- it's been 6 years since then, Mango.

635
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:23,422
Mango?

636
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,200
5 boys used to follow me everyday.

637
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,428
2 of them used to give me love letters.

638
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,206
Uncountable, you idiot!

639
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,834
That includes many foreigners.

640
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,343
I fell to none of them.

641
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:41,348
your intoxicating eyes,

642
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,518
your innocent looking face,

643
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:49,350
your style of talking,

644
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,958
your unshaven chins,

645
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,462
your slim body,

646
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,862
your dance, your fight.

647
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:03,799
Looking all these features in you,
I fell for you.

648
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,370
Stupid.

649
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:19,012
According to our plan,

650
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:23,887
I made Jahnavi fall in love with me.
What next?

651
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,086
Very good.
you're on the right track.

652
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,164
Good. Go ahead.

653
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,347
Happy married life.

654
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:51,852
Wish you all the very best.

655
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:52,510
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

656
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,254
- Congrats.
- Happy married life.

657
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:56,582
Thank you.

658
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,372
When are we getting married?

659
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,140
- Where are we going to our honeymoon?
- I'll tell after reaching there.

660
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,945
- Bye.
- Bye.

661
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,382
First my dad must agree.

662
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,958
Okay. I will meet him.

663
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,126
That's not so easy.

664
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,235
Only he knows where he will be.

665
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:40,960
Very big business man.

666
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,141
Boss, it's JD.

667
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,984
Brother, it's JD.

668
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,030
Hi Shan, my dear friend.

669
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,675
- How are you?
- Good.

670
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,343
- How have you been, JD?
- Long time. No see, any news.

671
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,207
Don't you know who killed Raka?

672
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,543
We have no business rivals in India.

673
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,056
But if police had nabbed Raka,
we would've been in danger.

674
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:41,629
So, whoever had killed Raka
has done us a favor.

675
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:46,298
But I still don't know who and
why he killed Raka.

676
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,528
I know.

677
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,301
There were 3, 1 is dead.

678
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:55,534
We are the remaining 2.
If one dies, only one remains.

679
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:57,706
I will kill him right now...

680
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,055
Sorry my friend.
I'm really sorry.

681
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:14,594
I got angry when I learnt that
you had killed Raka.

682
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:20,566
By infiltrating my gang with your spy,
it's confirmed that it's not you.

683
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,534
I've also proved that it's not me either.

684
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:29,242
So, a third person has killed Raka.

685
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,504
Sorry JD.

686
01:02:34,015 --> 01:02:38,248
- Sorry to have spied on you.
- oh! Come on.

687
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,288
No formalities between friends.
It's okay.

688
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,118
- What do you say gentlemen?
- Correct.

689
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,126
Instead of finding a suitable replacement for
Raka and do business in India,

690
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,785
why should we fight among ourselves?

691
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:52,422
Our 25 year old arms & drugs network
shouldn't go close down in a day.

692
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,091
Right.

693
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:59,103
A gift to my friend and 25 year old friendship.

694
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:04,772
Thank you Shan.

695
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,539
But you know something.

696
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,606
I don't take freebies.

697
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,283
My gift to you as a token of friendship...

698
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,819
For giving me the wrong information.

699
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,225
- Thank you my friend.
- it's okay, Bye.

700
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,127
A spy in his gang without our knowledge?

701
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:34,106
If he could spy on us,
won't it be bad if we don't spy on him?

702
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:35,505
So, I killed his own man.

703
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,475
Dead men tell no tales.

704
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,485
- Hi dad! How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

705
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,326
- Dad, I miss you.
- I miss you too.

706
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,328
you seem to be very excited.
Any boy friend?

707
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:01,833
Hi! cool dad.

708
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:05,163
That's your dad.

709
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,506
- Can I speak to that lucky boy?
- Sure. one second.

710
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,544
Talk to him.

711
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,840
- Hello uncle.
- Hello.

712
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,118
Congrats! young man.

713
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,514
Come to Munich.

714
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:48,312
Stop.

715
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,223
Dad is always security conscious.

716
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,365
- Welcome home, my darling.
- Dad.

717
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,564
- Hi dad.
- How are you?

718
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,731
I'm fine.

719
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,374
- Dad, this is Pugal.
- Pugal.

720
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:18,274
Hi uncle.

721
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,505
Hi! Nice name.

722
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:20,838
Thanks.

723
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,172
Dad, keep chatting.

724
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,376
- I'll be there in 5 minutes.
- yeah...

725
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:25,755
Please.

726
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,865
100 million dollar empire.
One & only heir, my daughter Jahnavi.

727
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,963
Should I get her married to you?
No chance.

728
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,866
you must be kidding.

729
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:48,873
I'm not a fool to give you a blank cheque
to go away from my daughter.

730
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:55,943
JD. you're still alive because
you're my daughter's guest.

731
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,453
If not, my security guards would've...

732
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:25,509
Good.

733
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,816
The person might be the wrong one.
But your aim hit bullseye.

734
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,289
- Who checked him?
- Sir.

735
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:40,427
He wore sword as a belt.
you let him in.

736
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,621
I don't want this to happen ever again.

737
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:43,662
yeah...

738
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:46,262
What was I saying...?

739
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,833
you hit the bullseye.

740
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,341
How Qualified are you to marry my daughter?

741
01:06:55,511 --> 01:07:01,005
I did M.Tech in IIT Kharagpur
and MBA in oxford university.

742
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,848
you are a smuggler.
I'm a professional killer.

743
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,951
you saw me now, didn't you?

744
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,056
What more do you want to qualify?

745
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,357
But still I'll tell you because you're going
to be my future father-in-law.

746
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:22,800
I killed your best friend Raka.

747
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,498
Is it enough or you want more?

748
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,540
I know you killed him for money.

749
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,039
Tell me who hired you to kill Raka.

750
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:34,978
I'm an assassin not a traitor.

751
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:41,886
None has left this place alive
without answering my question.

752
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:43,985
Now, I will.

753
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,000
I like your guts.

754
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,412
I want to talk to you in person.

755
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,019
What next?

756
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,034
Go to Hotel China Gate next.

757
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,471
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.

758
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,410
Shall we have fun, darling?

759
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,979
No need of play ground or umpire.

760
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,651
None will lose, handsome.

761
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,203
listen by darling.
it's an indoor game.

762
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,839
it's a shame if you
don't know to play.

763
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,537
you're a fool if you don't break
the rules of the game.

764
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:48,171
Goal of the game is to
cross the limits.

765
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:55,685
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.

766
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:59,225
Shall we have fun, darling?

767
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:37,564
The taxi I boarded always paid
extra tip above the fare to me.

768
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:48,236
I asked for a seat in the bus.
The driver gave his seat to me.

769
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:54,573
you've a great body
with loads of pleasure in it.

770
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:59,185
you've a great body
with loads of pleasure in it.

771
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,957
Come tonight, we have fun.

772
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:06,686
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.

773
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:10,696
Shall we have fun, darling?

774
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,932
A diamond merchant looked
at my sparkling teeth

775
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:53,905
He threw away real diamonds as fake.

776
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,807
A gold merchant saw my golden body

777
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,679
He gave up his bullion stock for me.

778
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:10,849
A beautiful young girl
gave me a shock of the life.

779
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,689
A beautiful young girl
gave me a shock of the life.

780
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:19,323
I'm the king of your kingdom of beauty.

781
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:26,797
My parents aren't at home.
And no one to stop us.

782
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,172
Shall we have fun, darling?

783
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,015
Are you okay?

784
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:35,845
Sorry.

785
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,179
Do you know who I am?

786
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,350
- Do you know who you are up against?
- I'll show you who I am.

787
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,194
Show me.

788
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,060
Don't shoot.
Everything here is explosive.

789
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,427
Thank you

790
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:50,360
What?

791
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:53,531
you listened to what I said, didn't you?

792
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,640
Find out who he is & his whereabouts.

793
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:10,324
Today, he is dead meat.

794
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,060
I'm scared to even look at his photo.

795
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,229
I'm Pugal.
I'm not at home right now.

796
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,667
you can leave a message
after the beep. Bye.

797
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,003
Calling from Citibank.

798
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,970
We are interested in giving you...

799
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:29,469
If you are accepting...

800
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:32,110
Pugal, it's me, your mom.

801
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,978
I'm coming there on Wednesday
morning by Lufthansa flight.

802
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,983
Receive me at the airport.

803
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,647
Only 30 minutes more.
Come on, let's go.

804
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,338
Over there.

805
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,454
Come on.

806
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,359
Come on shoot.

807
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:28,465
Shoot.

808
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,197
Shoot.

809
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:38,405
My mom is here.

810
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,487
Shoot him.

811
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,231
- No.
- Uncle. What happened?

812
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,072
Stupid.

813
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,737
She is my wife.

814
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:06,297
Hey come here.

815
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,081
Make it fast.

816
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,346
Where did you get so much money?

817
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,601
I joined army & sacrificed
a lot for the country.

818
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,668
But I got nothing.

819
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,329
I did a very small favor to our enemy.

820
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:46,666
They rewarded me with lot of money.

821
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:50,836
How can saviors turn into traitors?

822
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,846
Talking like a true patriot...?

823
01:20:58,385 --> 01:21:01,650
I will not only sell the country
but also you, for money.

824
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,154
Money is important to me.

825
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,657
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

826
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,857
If you sacrifice your life
for our country,

827
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,357
I will feel proud to be
a soldier's widow.

828
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:18,537
I can't live a life as a traitor's wife.

829
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,822
I feel very happy to see
you after so many years.

830
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,194
I think we're united by fate.

831
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:43,660
yes, fate brought me here.

832
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,559
Not to see you.

833
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,361
But to see my son.

834
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:50,329
Haven't you changed, Shanti?

835
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:52,864
Try to understand.

836
01:21:53,607 --> 01:21:55,405
Whatever I did was for you.

837
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:58,574
Now, I am a millionaire.
I can buy anything I wish.

838
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,545
Buy a wife & a child for you
with that money.

839
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:03,749
Please.

840
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,444
Forget the past & forgive me.

841
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,785
Traitor can never be forgiven.
Get lost.

842
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:13,454
Shanti...

843
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:28,402
Mother hasn't forgotten the past.

844
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,867
I need sometime to set things right.

845
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,210
Thank God, you understood my plight.

846
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,645
I was yearning to see you
for the past 20 years.

847
01:22:41,924 --> 01:22:44,448
Me too.

848
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,823
you're great, my son.

849
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,289
Hello everybody.

850
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,763
Sir, what's the problem?
What happened sir?

851
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,796
Attention everybody.
This is the control room calling.

852
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,410
An African chimpanzee has
escaped from the zoo.

853
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:04,305
He will look & speak
just like a human.

854
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:07,971
Please arrest it the moment
you encounter it. Over.

855
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,974
Okay. Message received.
Over.

856
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,612
Okay. I am keeping a watch.

857
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:13,310
Tell me the moment you see it.

858
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:14,483
Okay.

859
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,693
I spotted the monkey.

860
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,667
Keep a watch on it.
Don't let it escape.

861
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:38,341
Send a force soon.
It looks dangerous.

862
01:23:41,015 --> 01:23:42,005
Come fast.

863
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:50,390
Why catch me?

864
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:58,490
Both photos are matching perfectly.

865
01:23:58,665 --> 01:23:59,791
Take lip prints.

866
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,374
200% matching.

867
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,001
Take it to the zoo.

868
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:12,708
Sir, I'm not African monkey.

869
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:14,708
I'm a poor soul.

870
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,314
- I'm a normal man from India.
- Indian...?

871
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,919
- yes...Indian.
- Bollywood?

872
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:21,878
- Yes, Hollywood.
- No Hollywood.

873
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,723
Do you know Bollywood dance?

874
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,417
- yes.
- Show. We will let you go.

875
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:41,733
Stop killing me with your
sexy sharp eyes.

876
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:48,706
Stop pushing with your thin waistline.

877
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:50,840
Next.

878
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:51,882
Cow dies. Man ate it.

879
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,682
Make a drum with its skin & beat it.

880
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,051
Cow dies. Man ate it.

881
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:00,792
Make a drum with its skin & beat it.

882
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:11,566
Beat it, man.

883
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:16,107
They are busy dancing.
you escape.

884
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,389
- it's okay.
- Sorry.

885
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:31,388
No problem.

886
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:35,725
Maada...!?

887
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:44,463
Did police torture you here?

888
01:25:47,074 --> 01:25:48,406
Stop crying.

889
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,771
I saved you from the police.

890
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,580
Why did you come here?

891
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:57,406
My brother ran away from home
when he was very young.

892
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,482
I heard that he lives here.

893
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,486
I came here to find him.

894
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,956
I won't go back unless I find him.

895
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:07,823
All the best.

896
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,031
What happened to your hair?

897
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:16,835
When I was about to board the plane,

898
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,529
people caught me & cut my hair because
it was hitting the roof of the plane.

899
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:20,498
Okay.

900
01:26:20,774 --> 01:26:21,866
Don't worry Maada.

901
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:24,477
I will make you stay in my friend's
house and look after you.

902
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,470
Thank you, Jahnavi.

903
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,513
One second.

904
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,008
- Hello.
- A happy news.

905
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:32,984
What's it?

906
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:37,991
I've found my father.

907
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:39,683
My father & your father are
very good friends.

908
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,954
Wow! Great!

909
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,030
Ladies & Gentlemen.
And my dear friends.

910
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,865
Today is the happiest day in my life.

911
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:53,072
I'll introduce you to a VIP of my life.
My son, Pugal.

912
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:24,769
Hi uncle.

913
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,904
We are always friends.

914
01:27:36,683 --> 01:27:37,241
you're right.

915
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:40,180
Have you met my son before?

916
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,880
Before you knew him as your son,

917
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,921
- I knew him as my son-in-law.
- is it? Fabulous!

918
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:48,221
Wow!

919
01:27:49,596 --> 01:27:50,927
Good.

920
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:54,758
From partners, we've become kinsmen.

921
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:59,196
With this coalition, we are the No.1.
Let's celebrate.

922
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:00,939
- Come on babes.
- Wow!

923
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,722
let's go.

924
01:28:25,265 --> 01:28:29,669
if you're angry,
I will be angry too.

925
01:28:29,836 --> 01:28:34,103
if you don't look at me,
I won't either.

926
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:38,804
if you yell at me,
I will yell at you too.

927
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:43,110
if you fight with me,
I will fight with you too.

928
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:47,653
if you stop talking to me,
I will stop talking to you too.

929
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:52,851
But if you forget me,
I will die.

930
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,026
Even if you don 't listen to me,

931
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:05,605
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.

932
01:29:05,772 --> 01:29:07,832
Even if you don 't stop by me,

933
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:14,107
I will chase you down to
say that I love you.

934
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:41,369
I'll never lie that whatever
you say is poetry.

935
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:45,907
I'll never call you a world beauty.

936
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:50,643
I'll never peep through the hole
while you're in the shower.

937
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:54,982
I'll never ask for anything you ate.

938
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:59,388
I'll never look at your gestures.

939
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:03,891
I'll never look at you
even in my dreams.

940
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:08,399
I'll never come after you.

941
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:13,730
But if you forget me,
I will die.

942
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,906
Even if you don't listen to me,

943
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:26,282
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.

944
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,713
Even if you don 't stop by me,

945
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:36,763
I will chase you down to say
that I love you.

946
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:06,920
I'll make your dimple swell
with my kisses.

947
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:11,292
I'll plant my hair in my mustache
on your bosom.

948
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:15,926
I'll give you a piggy back
ride to sleep.

949
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:20,301
I'll keep an alarm that will ring silently
like a blooming flower.

950
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:24,844
I'll romance even on Sundays.

951
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:29,176
I'll put an end to your shyness.

952
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:33,810
I'll bear all the pain you give.

953
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:38,983
But if you forget me,
I will die.

954
01:31:43,096 --> 01:31:45,155
Even if you don 't listen to me,

955
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:51,795
I will shout loud to say
that I love you.

956
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:53,964
Even if you don 't stop by me,

957
01:31:54,142 --> 01:32:02,276
I will chase you down to
say that I love you.

958
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:33,414
I just can't stop loving you.

959
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,516
Who is that?

960
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,217
Damn it.

961
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,817
Urinating in public even in foreign.

962
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,824
I just can't...

963
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,240
Cow beggar.

964
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:28,097
Mummy..?!?!?!

965
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,155
Bloody beggar.

966
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,165
How dare you!

967
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:00,157
Shan.

968
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,295
No.

969
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:24,710
Wow!

970
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:54,242
Nobody knows about this place.

971
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:57,714
That includes my closest partner Max too.

972
01:35:58,084 --> 01:36:01,077
Till now, it was my secret place.
From now, it is yours too.

973
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:03,113
I must tell you everything.

974
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:06,021
you're my heir.

975
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:08,425
you're my everything.

976
01:36:10,029 --> 01:36:11,121
I'm bit excited.

977
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:13,194
Come...

978
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:25,135
This case has a bluray disc.

979
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:30,214
It contains complete information about JD.

980
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,447
Like in tales a demon's life is in parrot.

981
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:38,287
This disc holds the key to JD's life.

982
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:42,095
Likewise, he holds the key to our life.

983
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:47,433
I mean he has complete information
about us in a CD.

984
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:53,296
After marrying JD's daughter,
you will get that CD too.

985
01:36:53,474 --> 01:37:00,278
With those 2 discs,
we will be the Emperors of this network.

986
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:04,478
I feel I'm on the top of the world.

987
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,492
I'm very happy today.

988
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:17,631
I've handed over everything to you.

989
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:20,289
Now, I can rest in peace.

990
01:37:23,703 --> 01:37:24,636
Don't worry.

991
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:27,536
I will give you permanently rest.

992
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,027
Hi Jahnavi...

993
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:07,590
- Where are you?
- on the top..

994
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,496
I've been trying to reach you for long time.

995
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,365
you promised to come with me
to my friend's birthday party.

996
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:13,438
Have you forgotten it?
When will you come?

997
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:15,666
- I'll be there within 2 minutes.
- How will you come?

998
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,037
Will you come flying?

999
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:29,551
- Wow!
- I love you...

1000
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:04,581
He is our young commander.

1001
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,992
Come on, let's be merry.

1002
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:17,734
Come on, let's be merry.

1003
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:26,345
your eyes will gleam in excitement.

1004
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:30,577
I'm losing myself this moment.

1005
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:34,744
The merry making should
electrify our impulses.

1006
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:38,414
young blood is rushing and
gushing in excitement.

1007
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:42,619
My song will rant the sky.
Come on, sing with me.

1008
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:49,133
My dance shakes up the earth.
you got to believe me.

1009
01:41:51,771 --> 01:41:54,104
Come on, let's be merry.

1010
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:02,882
Come on, let's be merry.

1011
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:28,073
I've seen many girls.
Admired their eyes too.

1012
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:32,174
Till now, no one has won my heart.

1013
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:36,609
I saw you and your pride.

1014
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:40,617
you've strung this bow
without touching it.

1015
01:42:40,788 --> 01:42:42,982
you wooed me with
your bewitching glances.

1016
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,851
I was left with no options.

1017
01:42:45,025 --> 01:42:47,186
you have violently won me
with your captivating smile.

1018
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:51,487
for God's sake,
please spare me now.

1019
01:42:53,868 --> 01:42:56,495
Come on, let's be merry.

1020
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,873
Come on, let's be merry.

1021
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:38,805
Were you born in Greece?
Were you brought up in Swiss?

1022
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:42,813
is Paris the address of
your enchanting smile?

1023
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:44,883
your front is class.

1024
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,486
your back is mass.

1025
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:51,489
or else, are you a mixture of both?

1026
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,853
Hey, you're slowly throwing the net
and trying to trap me.

1027
01:43:54,026 --> 01:43:55,688
Come near me and hug me tightly.

1028
01:43:55,862 --> 01:44:02,097
Play all your mischievous pranks on me.

1029
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:07,036
Come on, let's be merry.

1030
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:15,681
Come on, let's be merry.

1031
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,918
I don't know how it happened.
We have informed.

1032
01:44:55,088 --> 01:44:56,112
His son is on the way.

1033
01:45:08,067 --> 01:45:13,233
your father expired in the air crash.

1034
01:45:13,573 --> 01:45:15,906
We couldn't recover his body.

1035
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:31,317
Father...

1036
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:51,342
We never expected this.
Don't control your tears.

1037
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,009
Cry out loud...

1038
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,068
Pugal, why are you looking at the glass?

1039
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:57,001
Do you know whose cooling glass is this?

1040
01:47:08,856 --> 01:47:10,754
JD killed my brother.

1041
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:13,916
We shouldn't spare JD.

1042
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:18,763
He is not an ordinary man.

1043
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:20,933
We must plan and kill him.

1044
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:23,932
I'll tell you the plan.

1045
01:47:33,446 --> 01:47:37,440
Be careful,
'Villu' is a dangerous man.

1046
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:44,948
Well done...well done, Pugal.

1047
01:47:45,892 --> 01:47:48,224
But why did you kill
your father for our deal?

1048
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:49,293
I'm sorry.

1049
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:53,390
Shan isn't my father.

1050
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,130
What are you saying?

1051
01:47:56,736 --> 01:47:59,398
A fraud like him can't be my father.

1052
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:02,308
I just acted as his son.
That's it.

1053
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:05,302
That's a good one.

1054
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:09,506
But how did you make shan
believe that you're his son?

1055
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:11,284
Simple!

1056
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:13,315
Through his wife!

1057
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:15,243
Their son went missing as a kid.

1058
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:18,451
I impersonated as their long lost son.

1059
01:48:19,193 --> 01:48:22,525
I easily trapped the lady yearning
for long lost son with sentiment.

1060
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,159
Superb!

1061
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:33,269
your bluray disc and secrets
are locked in a Swiss bank.

1062
01:48:33,441 --> 01:48:34,964
This is the pin number.

1063
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:37,970
Great job!

1064
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:40,339
Let me see it.

1065
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,527
Pin number is correct, boss.

1066
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:03,195
Good work, Pugal.

1067
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:04,367
What next?

1068
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:05,527
Saying I'm going to kill you,

1069
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:10,138
I'm going to bring all his men here
and eliminate them.

1070
01:49:10,311 --> 01:49:13,542
Wow! It sounds good!
How will you accomplish it?

1071
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:16,541
Somethings are better seen than heard.

1072
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:20,581
See me in action.

1073
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:35,400
- Did you send the CD?
- yes, boss.

1074
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:39,566
It'll start a internecine war and
leave all of them dead.

1075
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,277
But why did you kill
your father for our deal?

1076
01:49:50,451 --> 01:49:51,417
I'm sorry.

1077
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,410
Shan isn't my father.

1078
01:49:57,123 --> 01:49:58,090
What are you saying?

1079
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,919
I just acted as his son.
That's it.

1080
01:50:03,464 --> 01:50:09,095
I'm going to bring all his men here
and eliminate them.

1081
01:50:39,266 --> 01:50:40,290
Let's all go inside.

1082
01:50:40,468 --> 01:50:43,493
Let's lay siege JD's place and
kill him in his own den.

1083
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:46,300
you enter first.
Give us a signal.

1084
01:50:46,472 --> 01:50:49,465
We'll come in.
Correct?

1085
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,076
Correct...correct!

1086
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:52,570
you go first.

1087
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:57,980
Finish!

1088
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:26,979
Pugal, JD has sent the CD about
your conversation with him.

1089
01:51:31,451 --> 01:51:37,015
you killed my brother and gave a great
performance of mourning his death too.

1090
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:38,519
It was unbearable!

1091
01:51:38,992 --> 01:51:42,291
He cried more than us. We must...

1092
01:51:43,162 --> 01:51:44,460
Am I a fool?

1093
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,962
Hey, who are you?

1094
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,394
Why did you do all this?

1095
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:51,026
What's your connection with JD?

1096
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:53,332
Why did you kill my brother shan?
Tell me.

1097
01:51:53,506 --> 01:51:55,634
I'll give you 10 seconds.

1098
01:52:39,585 --> 01:52:41,747
If you decide to kill,
go ahead and do it.

1099
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:45,751
Don't spend time to inquire.

1100
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:48,588
Bloody fools!

1101
01:53:22,562 --> 01:53:25,725
By now, Pugal would be dead.

1102
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:29,564
Go to Swiss bank and
get the bluray disc.

1103
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:34,830
It's not a bomb, it's a wedge.

1104
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:38,743
How was my stick?

1105
01:53:41,482 --> 01:53:42,345
Is it good?

1106
01:53:43,515 --> 01:53:46,746
It was specially made for you.

1107
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:50,415
God is omnipresent.

1108
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:54,325
In Swiss bank locker too.

1109
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:57,319
I just did it for fun.

1110
01:53:57,497 --> 01:54:00,795
- What?
- I just did it for fun...

1111
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:04,865
Have fun with uncles & brothers-in-law,
not with your son-in-law!

1112
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:12,175
Father-in-law, any video coverage?

1113
01:54:12,612 --> 01:54:13,874
Smile please.

1114
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:15,837
Smile please.

1115
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:25,846
That is...

1116
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,695
I want to meet your daughter.

1117
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:33,860
I've blown up all the vehicles.

1118
01:54:34,902 --> 01:54:36,368
Don't mind, I'll take your vehicle.

1119
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:39,562
Janu will get angry, if I go late.

1120
01:54:41,307 --> 01:54:45,573
Walk your way to home.

1121
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:50,580
Bye!

1122
01:54:52,353 --> 01:54:53,479
you go.

1123
01:55:21,781 --> 01:55:24,375
I'm an ace archer.

1124
01:55:28,788 --> 01:55:31,382
I'm the one who stringed your bow.

1125
01:55:32,225 --> 01:55:35,626
I'll kiss you.
your pulse will race.

1126
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:39,253
it will compete with 100 horses.

1127
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:42,629
I'll hug you,
you will swoon in joy.

1128
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:46,203
you will run amok like a mad elephant.

1129
01:55:46,373 --> 01:55:48,533
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.

1130
01:55:48,741 --> 01:55:50,264
I'm a master of romance.
I'm Cupid's buddy.

1131
01:55:50,475 --> 01:55:53,274
I'm greater than celestial Menaka.

1132
01:55:53,446 --> 01:56:00,716
I'll teach you love tricks.
I'm the head priestess of love.

1133
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,950
I'm an ace archer.

1134
01:56:24,577 --> 01:56:27,910
your cheeks are alluring.

1135
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:31,341
it's delicious and mouth watering.

1136
01:56:31,517 --> 01:56:38,685
your sultry body is like treasure trove,
I want to steal it.

1137
01:56:38,858 --> 01:56:42,349
you have sharp eyes.

1138
01:56:42,527 --> 01:56:45,758
it's watching me all the time.

1139
01:56:45,932 --> 01:56:52,701
you've eliminated shyness from me.

1140
01:56:52,872 --> 01:56:55,272
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.

1141
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:59,774
I'm a master of romance.
I'm Cupid's buddy.

01:57:20,967 --> 01:57:23,527
I'm the one who stringed your bow.

1146
01:57:45,324 --> 01:57:48,521
like tender coconuts in Sahara.
like fire in Cheerapunji.

1147
01:57:48,694 --> 01:57:52,096
I'll quench your thirst
anytime, anywhere.

1148
01:57:52,433 --> 01:57:59,429
like water in Pluto,
you're hidden deep down in my heart.

1149
01:57:59,604 --> 01:58:06,444
oh come on, dude...
Come on, I'll make your night delightful.

1150
01:58:06,612 --> 01:58:13,449
Come on, you tomboyish girl.
Come and enjoy the bliss of heaven.

1151
01:58:13,618 --> 01:58:15,779
I'm greater than Lord Krishna.

1152
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:20,585
I'm a master of romance.

1154
01:58:24,765 --> 01:58:27,928
I'm the head priestess of love.

1155
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:37,141
I'm an ace archer.

1156
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:44,113
I'm the one who stringed your bow.

1157
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:46,745
Check it out... check it out.

1158
01:58:46,918 --> 01:58:48,546
Get up... get up.
Now let's get it out.

1159
01:58:48,721 --> 01:58:50,882
let's sing and dance.
let's go.

1160
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,606
Hey, Raka..

1161
01:59:26,659 --> 01:59:32,427
My man Pugal has couriered me
the secret bluray disc.

1162
01:59:32,598 --> 01:59:34,998
Watch now what I'll do to you with it.

1163
01:59:44,876 --> 01:59:47,037
Hello...I'm Joseph.

1164
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:58,682
Raka speaking.

1165
02:00:18,878 --> 02:00:20,538
Where is my bluray disc?

1166
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:22,707
Why are you astonished?

1167
02:00:22,881 --> 02:00:25,680
What else can a man do if he's
shaken up from deep sleep?

1168
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:27,576
Where is the disc?

1169
02:00:27,853 --> 02:00:29,718
It's with me, why?

1170
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,081
you liar!

1171
02:00:32,659 --> 02:00:34,522
Why did you send the disc to India?

1172
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:41,095
I must reach India safely, right?

1173
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:46,903
Okay, cool...tell me now.
What's the price of the disc?

1174
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:52,237
JD, I'm a professional killer,

1175
02:00:53,178 --> 02:00:58,742
but still I killed your partner Shan
and his family for your sake,

1176
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:00,574
why did I do it?

1177
02:01:00,953 --> 02:01:03,922
Trusting you'll honor the deal
of giving your daughter to me.

1178
02:01:04,624 --> 02:01:07,753
But you played a double game
and tried to eliminate me.

1179
02:01:10,262 --> 02:01:12,197
I can kill you right now also.

1180
02:01:15,635 --> 02:01:20,732
Impossible! Killing me is like
committing suicide for you.

1181
02:01:22,074 --> 02:01:27,274
We are like lovers, father-in-law!
We can't live without the other.

1182
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:34,550
The disc will reach the police safely
if I get even a small scratch.

1183
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:41,291
If you want the disc,
get your daughter Jahnavi married to me.

1184
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:45,590
Normally In-laws give dowry
to the son-in-law,

1185
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:53,304
for a change I'll give your
bluray disc as dowry to you.

1186
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:57,670
Dear, how is that?!

1187
02:01:58,144 --> 02:02:02,604
I'm in this business before you were born,
trying to act smart with me?

1188
02:02:02,816 --> 02:02:06,148
you needn't give me the disc,
boys, bring him to India.

1189
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:10,281
I'll get the disc from you
in your own country.

1190
02:02:27,807 --> 02:02:30,298
What's it dear?
What happened?

1191
02:02:34,814 --> 02:02:44,849
Pugal isn't your son,
he impersonated to kill your husband.

1192
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:48,191
He's a professional killer.

1193
02:02:53,632 --> 02:02:56,658
I know Pugal isn't my son.

1194
02:02:59,638 --> 02:03:06,703
He didn't kill my husband,
he sentenced a traitor with death.

1195
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:13,880
Do you know about his family?

1196
02:03:14,253 --> 02:03:17,711
Do you know who his father was?

1197
02:03:31,772 --> 02:03:32,897
Saravanan!

1198
02:03:34,839 --> 02:03:37,673
He's a patriotic Tamil
who loves his motherland.

1199
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:40,710
He's a Great Warrior standing tall.

1200
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,748
All the directions know his Greatness.

1201
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:46,851
A terror to the traitors.

1202
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:49,886
A man who knows no fear.

1203
02:03:50,055 --> 02:03:52,956
A warrior out to save motherland.

1204
02:03:53,124 --> 02:03:56,026
A warrior who fights evil staking his life.

1205
02:03:56,195 --> 02:03:59,096
A warrior who never spares the enemy.

1206
02:03:59,265 --> 02:04:02,757
A thorough bred Tamil.

1207
02:04:22,789 --> 02:04:23,277
Sir!

1208
02:04:25,292 --> 02:04:27,088
yes Major, well done.

1209
02:04:27,992 --> 02:04:30,119
- it was a fantastic job.
- Thank you sir.

1210
02:04:30,329 --> 02:04:32,229
- I did my duty.
- Please!

1211
02:04:36,902 --> 02:04:42,067
Terrorists waylaid and looted
an army shipment of weapons.

1212
02:04:42,409 --> 02:04:43,965
We must find them.

1213
02:04:46,244 --> 02:04:48,474
I'm giving you the charge
of this operation, Major.

1214
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,143
I'll finish off everything sir.

1215
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:58,253
I've called a meeting to
discuss tomorrow's operation.

1216
02:04:58,991 --> 02:04:59,822
Go ahead.

1217
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,021
A small hitch in the plan.

1218
02:05:02,794 --> 02:05:03,454
What is it?

1219
02:05:03,862 --> 02:05:09,165
I've got information about a young Tamil officer
is in charge of the operation.

1220
02:05:10,002 --> 02:05:12,766
- Name?
- it's official secret.

1221
02:05:12,938 --> 02:05:15,338
Deal may hit a block.

1222
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:18,038
Can we make money
without facing difficulty?

1223
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:20,474
Think over it, a billion!

1224
02:05:20,845 --> 02:05:21,971
250 millions for each!

1225
02:05:23,181 --> 02:05:25,844
We sacrificed so much for this nation,
what did we get in return?

1226
02:05:26,385 --> 02:05:29,843
A rum bottle and Rs.5 only!
That's all!

1227
02:05:30,356 --> 02:05:33,349
Last assignment, we had killed many,

1228
02:05:33,993 --> 02:05:35,187
Just one more murder for our sake,

1229
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:36,453
life is settled.

1230
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:40,156
- Well said partner.
- Cheers!

1231
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:44,191
Comb gently.

1232
02:05:49,408 --> 02:05:52,206
Serving country and home too!

1233
02:05:52,846 --> 02:05:56,212
Brother, it happens in every home,
please take your seat.

1234
02:05:56,382 --> 02:05:57,178
Thank you.

1235
02:05:59,885 --> 02:06:03,218
- Chocolate!
- you have it uncle, I want a gun.

1236
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:06,219
I thought he'll be like mother,
but he's like his father.

1237
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:10,556
He's Major Saravanan's son,
like father like son.

1238
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:16,398
I'll buy a gun next time,
I'm going to Malaysia regarding a case.

1239
02:06:16,902 --> 02:06:18,096
It may take a month.

1240
02:06:19,572 --> 02:06:23,440
- Who is the 'case'?
- No jokes please, it's an Interpol case.

1241
02:06:23,876 --> 02:06:25,435
Breakfast is ready, come.

1242
02:06:25,844 --> 02:06:28,939
- Come, let's have it.
- okay.

1243
02:06:53,939 --> 02:06:55,270
Come...do it fast!

1244
02:06:58,577 --> 02:07:00,442
Shall we call men? come fast.

1245
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,915
Go...go...

1246
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:06,671
Major...please forgive us...
we'll surrender.

1247
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:10,005
Please show mercy.
We are also Tamils.

1248
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:11,643
We'll not do this again.

1249
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:14,485
Spare us...we'll not do this again.
Please Major!

1250
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,497
He's a patriotic Tamil
who loves his motherland.

1251
02:08:29,702 --> 02:08:32,637
He's a Great Warrior standing tall.

1252
02:08:33,005 --> 02:08:35,975
All the directions know his Greatness.

1253
02:08:36,141 --> 02:08:38,974
A terror to the traitors.

1254
02:08:39,144 --> 02:08:41,976
A man who knows no fear.

1255
02:08:42,147 --> 02:08:45,048
A warrior out to save motherland.

1256
02:08:45,217 --> 02:08:48,084
A warrior who fights evil staking his life.

1257
02:08:48,253 --> 02:08:51,188
A warrior who never spares the enemy.

1258
02:08:51,356 --> 02:08:54,257
He's an attacking hurricane.

1259
02:09:20,185 --> 02:09:23,177
Poor young man!

1260
02:09:23,356 --> 02:09:25,220
Young blood!

1261
02:09:32,364 --> 02:09:35,265
Hail Mother India!

1262
02:09:49,548 --> 02:09:52,210
When we were shipping our
regiment's weapons to the border,

1263
02:09:52,383 --> 02:09:56,081
suddenly a man entered with gun
and tried to steal the weapons

1264
02:09:56,622 --> 02:09:59,386
We aimed our guns at him and
asked him to surrender.

1265
02:09:59,558 --> 02:10:02,619
He fired at us and we lost few officers.

1266
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:05,787
We returned fire as self defense.

1267
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,620
We just did our duty sir.

1268
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:12,237
Later we came to know he was Indian
army's senior officer Major Saravanan.

1269
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:13,564
It was a black day sir.

1270
02:10:13,739 --> 02:10:17,642
We feel disgusted to see a traitor
from our Tamil Nadu.

1271
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:31,189
It's been proved beyond doubt that
Saravanan was involved in arms theft.

1272
02:10:31,356 --> 02:10:33,415
Court orders to strip him off
his military honors.

1273
02:10:35,194 --> 02:10:40,360
He's not a traitor!

1274
02:10:46,704 --> 02:10:49,105
Please don't strip him!

1275
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:50,172
I'll not allow you to do it.

1276
02:10:51,443 --> 02:10:53,172
I'll not allow you to do it.

1277
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:55,210
Mother!

1278
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:09,521
Don't accuse him, he's not a traitor.

1279
02:11:09,695 --> 02:11:14,860
He would've certainly sacrificed his life
for the country, please trust me.

1280
02:11:31,551 --> 02:11:37,352
We mustn't allow it...He betrayed the
country and spoiled our reputation.

1281
02:11:39,724 --> 02:11:42,387
We'll not allow the cremation
of a traitor in this holy land.

1282
02:11:42,561 --> 02:11:43,823
Get the body.

1283
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:47,264
No...no...

1284
02:11:49,836 --> 02:11:54,329
Leave him...don't do it...

1285
02:11:54,506 --> 02:11:55,564
Throw away the body.

1286
02:11:55,741 --> 02:12:02,340
Please don't do it.
Please leave him.

1287
02:12:02,915 --> 02:12:05,179
- Dear!
- Leave my father.

1288
02:12:24,637 --> 02:12:30,939
Father...father...

1289
02:12:38,283 --> 02:12:39,910
Father...father...

1290
02:13:34,272 --> 02:13:37,265
Come with me,
live peacefully elsewhere.

1291
02:13:51,556 --> 02:13:53,786
How can he live without you?

1292
02:13:56,495 --> 02:14:03,628
If he lives here, the society will kill
him calling as a traitor's son.

1293
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:06,631
Take him away from here.

1294
02:14:07,672 --> 02:14:16,705
- No, I'll not go mother.
- No son, please listen to me.

1295
02:14:17,048 --> 02:14:17,811
Please don't cry.

1296
02:14:17,982 --> 02:14:22,977
Look at me son,
you'll listen to me, won't you?

1297
02:14:24,856 --> 02:14:25,720
Don't cry.

1298
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:52,715
Mother...mother...

1299
02:14:58,422 --> 02:15:01,017
Sorry, I misunderstood Pugal.

1300
02:15:02,461 --> 02:15:05,897
Thanks at last you've understood my son.

1301
02:15:09,468 --> 02:15:11,629
What to do now?

1302
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:14,594
My father is taking Pugal
to India at gunpoint.

1303
02:15:16,708 --> 02:15:19,700
your father is not taking
my son to India,

1304
02:15:20,112 --> 02:15:22,876
in fact my son is taking
your father to India.

1305
02:15:39,498 --> 02:15:42,490
His every action has a meaning.

1306
02:15:53,145 --> 02:15:55,636
When he decides, it'll be done.

1307
02:15:56,581 --> 02:15:57,639
He'll do it.

1308
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:26,171
Fantastic job, partner,
kill him and get the disc.

1309
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:31,176
Hey, kill both of them and get the disc.

1310
02:16:42,961 --> 02:16:44,723
I don't need you also anymore.

1311
02:17:56,735 --> 02:18:06,940
Mother, I'll not go,
I'll not leave you.

1312
02:19:09,674 --> 02:19:10,265
Mother!

1313
02:19:22,821 --> 02:19:24,287
Please forgive me son.

1314
02:19:25,123 --> 02:19:28,650
I've never been a good mother to you.

1315
02:19:30,896 --> 02:19:34,888
Don't feel like that mother,
I'm living for you only.

1316
02:19:36,335 --> 02:19:39,234
The humiliation you went through will end today
and my vow will also be fulfilled.

1317
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:45,874
Come and see what I've brought for you.

1318
02:20:11,736 --> 02:20:13,363
Banish her from this village...

1319
02:20:14,706 --> 02:20:16,936
- Leave me.
- Mother...

1320
02:20:17,108 --> 02:20:20,236
She mustn't show her face to anyone.

1321
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:22,710
Only then she'll be
a living lesson to others.

1322
02:20:23,748 --> 02:20:26,080
Leave me...leave me...

1323
02:20:26,885 --> 02:20:27,715
No!

1324
02:20:41,933 --> 02:20:43,958
Traitor's wife!

1325
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:49,429
My mother!

1326
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:55,303
Go man.

1327
02:22:09,187 --> 02:22:09,846
Leave me.

1328
02:22:34,045 --> 02:22:36,809
- Leave him...don't harm him.
- Get lost.

1329
02:22:46,891 --> 02:22:47,880
Dig a ditch.

1330
02:23:05,410 --> 02:23:07,241
I killed and buried his father.

1331
02:23:09,447 --> 02:23:12,074
I'll bury and then kill him.

1332
02:23:26,931 --> 02:23:29,297
My son...my son...

1333
02:23:59,631 --> 02:24:03,089
Save my son!

1334
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:18,099
Pugal, don't spare him!

1335
02:26:57,575 --> 02:27:00,067
No...no...

1336
02:27:20,264 --> 02:27:21,322
No...

1337
02:27:39,218 --> 02:27:42,344
A man who knows no fear.

1338
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:45,683
He engulfs like lava.

1339
02:27:45,857 --> 02:27:49,315
He's a fearless Tamil warrior.

1340
02:27:49,493 --> 02:27:53,122
Death fears to touch this young warrior...

1341
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:56,366
Tell him to spare me.

1342
02:27:56,535 --> 02:27:58,695
Tell him to spare my life.

1343
02:28:03,207 --> 02:28:06,301
He's motherland's favorite son.

1344
02:28:06,477 --> 02:28:10,208
He destroys enemies.

1345
02:29:02,266 --> 02:29:03,894
Tell the truth about my father.

1346
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:06,201
I'll tell.

1347
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:07,598
Will you spare me if I tell the truth?

1348
02:29:09,273 --> 02:29:13,642
His father Maj.Saravanan was
an honest army officer.

1349
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:22,281
We killed him unjustly and
branded him as a traitor.

1350
02:29:24,756 --> 02:29:26,747
Please forgive me.

1351
02:29:27,390 --> 02:29:28,288
Forgive me.

1352
02:29:28,558 --> 02:29:31,289
I've told the truth.

1353
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:32,394
Pugal, please leave me.

1354
02:29:33,431 --> 02:29:34,830
I've told the truth.

1355
02:29:35,733 --> 02:29:38,429
- You promised to spare me, right?
- I'll leave...
