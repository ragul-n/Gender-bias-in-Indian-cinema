and always desire for something else.

5
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:30,000

126
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,458

127
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,708

00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,542
Pa.. I haven't collected bribe yet.

158
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,583
Come! Embarrassing me!

159
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,792
He learned from you only.

177
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,333
Wishes? Why?

178
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,042
Why have you come to the temple today?

179
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
Today's my birthday

180
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,125

181
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,167
Oh.. Oh!

will come to the temple at the same time

185
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,792
when young cute girls come.

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,292
But you have come when there is no one

187

190
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,792

but you are too late

193
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,625
Because, I have closed the gates of all the gods

194
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:05,667
Inside, one door, Brahma's door alone is still open,

195
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,792
do you have any objection in doing pooja over there?

196
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,833
Brahma?

197
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,625
But birthday poojas are generally done on Siva or Perumal right?

198
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,625
Come in.. I will tell you.

199
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,208
Swamy.. I have come

200
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,792
See bro..

201
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,417
What? Bro?

202
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,708
I still feel as young as you.

203
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,375
Oh..Oh!

204
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,500
We all are created by Brahma

205
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,667
so it is only fair to worship Brahma first on our Birthdays.

206
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,417
But.. many of us dont even consider

207
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,833
our living gods, our parents.

208
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,875
They are left at some Orphanage

209
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,708
or at some Old Age homes.

210
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,417
While this is the state of the parents

211
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,958
who cares for the gods?

212
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,500
So, Mr?

213
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,417
Kameshwaran.. alias Kamu.. bro

214
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,125
So Kamu..

215
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,792
It's your birthday..

216
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,625
and you are really lucky

217
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,292
to offer your payers to Brahma.

218
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,708
Swamy.. Swamy..

219
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,000
I have to go office soon..

220
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,542
Please do the pooja soon.

221
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:21,750
What bro?

222
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,458
The office you are going to go

223
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,792
work you are going to do

224
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,667
the life you are going to live henceforth

225
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,792
and everythinh was

226
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,792
decided and desgined by our Brahma only.

227
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,292
So, dont hurry.

228
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,042
Pray peacefully and then go.

229
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,417
Alright.

230
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:35,917
Come up.

231
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,250
Tell me your name and star sign

232
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,583
Kameshwaran..

233
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,417
Dhanush Rashi..

234
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,125
Pooradam Star..

235
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,625
Kanya Lagnam..

236
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,833
Brahma..

237
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,458
the priest says that

238
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,083
the life I am living in

239
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,917
is decided and designed by you.

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,667
If I get a chance to meet you..

241
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,417
I have a thousand questions to ask you.

242
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,750
*Mantras Playing*

243
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,500
Are you Brahma?

244
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,625
Actually..

245
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,542
Actually I was praying to meet you.

246
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,833
They say that you create everyone

247
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,375
from Amitabh to American President?

248
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,875
But you just create and go on!

249
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,292
Did you ever turn back

250
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,750
to look how they are doing?

251
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,083
No one is at peace here!

252
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:21,500
You are the reason for all this.

253
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,250
You are giving the next

254
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,458
to best to everyone.

255
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,250
You don't understand right?

256
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,250
I will explain.

257
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,125
Yes..

258
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,375
Our desired course should be best

259
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,708
but the one you give will be next..

260
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,292
The job we ask will be best

261
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,167
while the one you give will be next

262
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,917
The girl we look at will be super

263
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,583
but the ones who looks back at us?

264
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,333
Too much..

265
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,875
Mokkai boys get

266
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,167
Ambani like father.

267
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,958
For foolish boys

268
00:18:58,292 --> 00:18:59,750
foolish fathers.

269
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,458
Do you know how it feels

270
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,125
when youngsters like me

271
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,792
hangs on to the foot board of a bus,

272
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:05,500
next to me,

273
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,458
an old guy riding a KTM bike?

274
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,833
Do you know how it feels when

275
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,292
a dry person gets to

276
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,792
date a gorgeous girl

277
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,750
because he has got a car?

278
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Kamu.. Calm.

279
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,625
Why take me for an example

280
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,250
Viscom gold medalist..

281
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,000
but I work as a

282
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,042
simple program producer

283
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,292
But my cousin Ramu, who chased my papers

284
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,750
and cleared exams with border marks

285
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,000
is the CEO of the same company

286
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:47,833
How is it fair?

287
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,458
But..

288
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,125
because I don't have s good posting,

289
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,458
I am still waiting to

290
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,375
tell my sincere love

291
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,708
to my Manisha.

292
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,625
You are the reason for all this.

293
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,958
By not giving the

294
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,625
best to the best

295
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,250
you are doing everything wrong.

296
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,917
First of all stop deciding what we want.

297
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
Try givinig what we desire.

298
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,792
Its not just my wish

299
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:21,792
Come and look at the

300
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,125
roads in the midnight

301
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,625
every guy who holds on to smoke and tea

302
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,333
and stares at the sky are

303
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:27,917
scolding you only.

304
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,625
if it goes on like this..

305
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,667
not just 4 heads..

306
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,625
even if you have 40 heads

307
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,042
no one will respect you.

308
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,708
Swamy!

309
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,083
What bro?

310
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,625
Are you done with your pooja?

311
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,417
What did I do?

312
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,125
You only did?

313
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,125
No no!

314
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,625
You did better Pooja than me.

315
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,708
I mean..

316
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,333
You were blurting out loud

317
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,000
everything that was on your mind

318
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,208
Look here bro..

319
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,000
Brahma knows clearly

320
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:49,917
what to give

321
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,208
and to who and when.

322
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,833
See the three heads there?

323
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:53,917
Those are three vedas called

324
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,125
Rig, Yajur and Samam vedas

325
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,875
See the head that is behind?

326
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,583
It's Veda is Atharvanam

327
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,000
Don't even by mistake look at it.

328
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,458
If you see it

329
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,208
you can't handle it.

330
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,375
Bro!

331
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,708
My boss has said all this

332
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,667
ten years back.

333
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:10,542
Give it to me,

334
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,375
I have to go soon.

335
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,542
What you wished for will happen as it is.

336
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:21,917
Show your hand.

337
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:24,792
Bye bro!

338
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,958
*Temple Bell*

339
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,167
Fate has started to play!

340
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,250
Bro?

341
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,417
Head is spinning bro!

342
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,292
Maybe..

343
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,208
diabetes?

344
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,333
Because, nowadays even the

345
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:49,750
just born babies has diabetes.

346
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,292
Isnt't it your birthday today?

347
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,042
That's why.

348
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:54,167
On the way back..

349
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,083
check with a doctor.

350
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,625
Hey Siddha!

351
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,208
Aren't you done with your job?

352
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,208
Leave now.

353
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,583
Bro? I should also close the doors.

354
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,708
You will also have a lot of work today.

355
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,500
so, take leave.

356
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,292
Hello? Amma..

357
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:33,833
yes, tell me?

358
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,250
Amma, I am done visiting the temple.

359
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,917
I was able to do Pooja to Brahma only.

360
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:37,500
Is that ok?

361
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,750
All god is one!

362
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:39,958
You have done the Pooja right?

363
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:40,833
That is enough.

364
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,625
And then.. I want you to..

365
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,042
Amma.. One minute please..

366
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:44,625

Give me way..

370
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,125
Why are you chasing that girl?

371
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,625
Sir.. Who said that am chasing that girl?

372
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,708

373
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,625

Put him on the vehicle.

380
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,500
Hey! Muruga!

381
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,625
You ate their food..

382
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,167
Ok brother.

383
00:22:59,167 --> 00:22:59,792
Leave me please..

384
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:00,458
Aisu!

385
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:00,958
Thank you so much.

386
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,417
Aisu!

387
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,417
Uncle.. No.. Please leave him.

388
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,750
Oh my! Muruga!

389
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,333
Aisu!

390
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,708
Hey! Muruga!

391
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,542
Fool! Why did you do this?

392
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,917
No.. he was chasing you.

393
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:13,792
I tried to help..

394
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,000
Who asked you to help?

395
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,708
We are lovers.

396
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,208
We decided to elope and get married.

397
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,708
You've spolied it all!

398
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,750
Where did you come from?

399
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,042
If anything happens to him

400
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,208
I will not leave you alive!

401
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,500
Muruga! Muruga!

402
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,333
What Kamu sir?

403
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:01,833
You are late again?

404
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,083
Don't start please!

405
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,792
You look so royal..

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,542
I don't know who is the proprietor here.

407
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,875
You look very handsome!

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,167
I might as well envy you!

409
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,750
Is it?

410
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,417
Looking at you like this..

411
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,292
Am confused as to who is the Proprietor of this company!

412
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,417
Is it bro? Today is..

413
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh my! Should remove it.

414
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,042
Kamu.. Kamu.. Wait..

415
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,042
What is this?

416
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,583
Just now I said you look Handsome..

417
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:24,458
Now you look like a begger.

418
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
It's ok if you envy..

419
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,375
If that Jersey Cow inside sees me, thats all.

420
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,375
Oh.. You can't be scared of this guy!

421
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:29,792
Then?

422
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,375
You should use tactics with him!

423
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,125
Meaning?

424
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,792
Now.. You too are late.

425
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,542
Production manager cutting Mani is also late.

426
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,542
He hasn't come yet

427
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,958
But he will shout at you..

428
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,125
not at him.

429
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,167
How is that?

430
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,375
That is the tactics!

431
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,208
Now.. take me for an example..

432
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,333
Am going to meet my friends today at three

433
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,167
for a liquor party

434
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,208
We have not fixed the location yet..

435
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,750
that's why I came to work.

436
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,708
Look how I am going to get permission

437
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,375
from the same Jersey Cow you said about.

438
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,417
How is that?

439
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,958
That is the tactics.

440
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,542
Oh you and your tactics!

441
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,125
Come lets go!

442
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,500
Where? with you?

443
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,083
If he knew that I spoke with you this long..

444
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,625
I will fall ten years behind my service period.

445
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,208
You go ahead..

446
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,625
I will come ten minutes late.

447
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:09,917
Oh.. you do whatever, am going.

448
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:11,500
Kamu sir?

449
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,792
This too is tactics!

450
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,708
Come to our shop.

451
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:22,875
For sample..

452
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,125
take a piece and taste it.

453
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:26,500
Go to other shops..

454
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,250
Taste a piece there too..

455
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,042
Buy it from the shop..

456
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,583
where it tastes sour enough.

457
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,667
Think about what I've said.

458
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,125
Tamarind! Fresh Tamarind!

459
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,458
Oh am going to get caught today!

460
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:39,250
Hey Kamu!

461
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,500
Hey hi man!

462
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,542
Congratulations..

463
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,625
Hey thanks man! How do you know?

464
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,292
You are late again?

465
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,708
Shoot! What kind of friend are you?!

466
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,375
Hey hi!

467
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,167
Even this one does not respect me.

468
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,125
Hey hi.. Hi..

469
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,500
Hey what is this man?

470
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,167
No one else knows about my birthday!

471
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,875
Mr.Kameshwaran! Is this a club or a pub?

472
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,333
You knoiw that there is no shoot today right?

00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:10,583
Yes sir.

474
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,167
What time should you be here?

475
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,458
No sir.. today is..

476
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,667

477
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:14,292
Yes sir.. no..

478
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,333
It's my birthday too,

479
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,708
But didn't i come on time?

480
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:17,708
Right sir..On the way..

481
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,458
Now go and work for the money you earn.

482
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,625
Come like a load lorry at all the times..

483
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,667
Lazy boy.

484
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:23,708
Am sorry sir.

485
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,208
Cool down! Cool down!

486
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,000
Ramesha.. Now is your Happy Birthday.

487
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,542
Hi Maam!

488
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,583
Hai!!

489
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,625
Vanilla cake comes on its own.

490
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,625
Hi sir!

491
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,542
Hi!

492
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,833
I will not miss to cut this cake today.

493
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:08,542
Hi!

494
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,583
Cake going to the wrong shop?

495
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,000
Happy Birthday!

496
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,958
Won't you invite me inside?

497
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,542
Oh am sorry! Please come in.

498
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,500
Kamu.. be calm!

499
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,250
Would he have ordered online already?

500
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,708
What is this Rama?

501
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,333
CEO posting was a total waste!

502
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,083
Sir?

503
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:35,833
Hi!

504
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,917
Happy Birthday Sir!

505
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,667
Thank you.

506
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,833
Participating in your birthday yesterday..

507
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,250
was a great blessing in my life sir.

508
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,333
Oh thank you.

509
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,875
Sir I have a small request..

510
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:45,750
What do you want?

511
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,833
Have to go to hospital at three.

512
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,167
Why should i go to hospital?

513
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,000
Not you sir.

514
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,042
I have to take my wife to hospital at three.

515
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,667
Oh! Now I understand.

516
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,250
Why three? You can go now?

517
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,667
But the location is not fixed yet.

518
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,542
Location?

519
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,250
No.. Tomorrow's shoot location.

520
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,917
is not fixed yet!

521
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,167
Oh!

522
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,708
Work is my priority!

523
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,583
See me before you leave.

524
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,875
Thank you sir.

525
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,042
Happy Birthday Sir.

526
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,125
It's ok, it's ok.

527
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:11,292
He will get the double hatric employee award!

528
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,708
And this is tactics!

529
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,083
He know my worth..

530
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,833
Kameshwara!

531
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,125
I didn't even update on FB

532
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,125
How did you...?

533
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,583
What is this?

534
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,542
I can't learn this much?

535
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,708
Many directors have worked with me, but..

536
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,458
You are my favourite. Right?

537
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,708
I mean..

538
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,625
Lazy boy.

539
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,583
Hey man! What project have you designed?

540
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,458
Client is tearing me up.

541
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,667
Do you know how difficult it is to acquire a client?

542
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,833
This should be prepared and come to my desk in one hour.

543
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,625
Ok Sir.

544
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,625
Hi Vanisha!

545
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:49,667
So beautiful you are.

546
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,958
Hi Sir.

547
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,042
What are you doing here?

548
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,375
I wanted to talk to sir.

549
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,292
To this guy?

550
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,208
We can talk in my cabin.

551
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,833
You come to the cabin.

552
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,875
Sir.. I need to talk privately.

553
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,750
Personal?

554
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:04,958
No..

555
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:06,292
Ok.

556
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:06,958
Ok.

557
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,333
Oh dear!

558
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,083
Bye sir.

559
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:19,625
Oh my!

560
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,083
Hey! What happened?

561
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:21,875
For this..

562
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,167
Do you know who he is?

563
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,542
A super fool.

564
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,458
He chased my exam papers to pass.

565
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,250
He is the CEO of this company.

566
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,125
But am just a program producer.

567
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,458
My bad time.

568
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,375
It's all because of the god.

569
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,208
Hey!

570
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,667
I just scolded him so bad at the temple.

571
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,833
Why are you thinking like this?

572
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,458
If you had not become a director..

573
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,958
You would not have won

574
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,833
that Best Ad Film maker award watch.

575
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,125
I would not have been impressed by seeing that

576
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,708
and would not have come to you.

577
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,958
What am saying is that..

578
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,667
from international Ad agency

579
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,292
I would not have signed up with this new Ad agency.

580
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,125
All this is because of this posting right?

581
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:03,708
I know Manisha

582
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,292
You are saying all this to cool me down.

583
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,958
But my future expectation is something else.

584
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,417
Why do you say that?

585
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,708
The god who created us

586
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,208
knows what we need.

587
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,000
He is also giving it right.

588
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,708
We think about future..

589
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,333
Peace

590
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,333
Compassion

591
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,208
Affection

592
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:34,958
Love

593
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,708
God has put all these

594
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,083
in front of us

595
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,125
at our hand's distance.

596
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,500
We are the one's who don't understant all this

597
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:47,333
and do all the wrong things

598
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,875
to get all these.

599
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,000
Look clearly

600
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:55,542
the future that you expect is

601
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,333
right in front of your eyes.

602
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,833
I will treat you for your birthday.

603
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,542
We can go for a dinner

604
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,167
I will come and pick you up.

605
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:22,458
OK?

606
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,542
Be ready.

607
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,667
Yess!

608
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,125
kameshwara!

609
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,708
What is happening all of a sudden in your life?

610
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,042
I should share this...

611
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,542
Facebook..

612
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,667
Feeling..

613
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,542
extremely happy.

614
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,417
Oh! Friend's request.

615
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,625
Sure.

616
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,208
Who is this?

617
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,833
Hey! Just now..

618
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,875
Within that..

619
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,458
I will accept it.

620
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,833
Hey thank you. But who are you?

621
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,708
How do you know?

622
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,083
I haven't posted on my timeline.

623
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,292
You know all? Meaning?

624
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:34,250
All meaning?

625
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,625
First who are you?

626
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:43,333
Brahma?

627
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,333
Don't play.

628
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,792
What do you know about me?

629
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,458
Amma..

630
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,208
Appa..

631
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,167
How did all this..?

632
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:28,833
Hey Kamu!

633
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:29,958
Yes.. Yea da?

634
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,583
It's time.. Are you not coming to eat?

635
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,500
You go on.. I will come.

636
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,583
Am hungry.. am going to eat.

637
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,583
You come soon?

638
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,500
What is this?

639
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,500
So many things are coming up?

640
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,083
No.. Not here.

641
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,417
Who could this be?

642
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,792
Hey! Is this a prank?

643
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,458
Am being respectful..

644
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,125
Tell me who you are.

645
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,625
What? Brahma?

646
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,042
Hey you don't know about me.

647
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,625
Am a very bad person.

648
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,708
Hey..

649
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,333
Hey.. who is this?

650
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,917
This is not right.

651
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:17,542
Someone is playing a game with me.

652
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,333
I can see it..

653
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,083
Will anyone keep a camera in the bathroom?

654
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,250
Are you not ashamed?

655
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,708
Kamu.. Apart from us there is someone else in the room.

656
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,125
This doesn't look like a game.

657
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:57,542
Hey!

658
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,167
Hey.. you!

659
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,875
Hey is that you?

660
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,792
What is this? I am texting.

661
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,542
Text?

662
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,083
Am sorry.

663
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,500
What happened to you?

664
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,250
No...

665
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,292
In my Facebook..

666
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,042
In Facebbok?

667
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,083
God has come.

668
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,250
Oh what are you?

669
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,000
I ahve had a ghost in my whatsapp

670
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:19,917
For all this..

671
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,250
Tell me dear..

672
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,583
You can't get upset for this.

673
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,333
I didn't send that message.

674
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,708
She sent me that message.

675
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,458
See I would not even have replied.

676
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,042
Then who is doing all this?

677
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,833
Why has she made me like a resort captive MLA?

678
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,708
Hey! Do you have any sense?

679
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,292
Aren't we going around together?

680
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,667
All of a sudden you propose?

681
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,542
What's the point in that?

682
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,542
Am I not a poor thing?

683
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,375
Everyone is hitting on you in front of me.

684
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,542
If you say no to me..

685
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,208
then as my grandmother said..

686
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,333
I will have to be a bachelor forever.

687
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,875
See.. I have got a coffee bean design

688
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,417
but a heartin design for you.

689
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,542
Hey.. you rubbish..

690
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,000
Understand what I say.

691
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,792
Girls like me will keep their favourite guy

692
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,542
as a friend only.

693
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,125
Because..

694
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,625
Will it be easy to get your work done?

695
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:20,417
Listen to me..

696
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,708
The lover will definitely become a bore one day.

697
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:24,458
Bloody modern girls!

698
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,417
That day, his date will get expired.

699
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,458
But a friend is not like that.

700
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,875
There is no expiry for friendship.

701
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,625
Please understand.

702
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:32,292
Hey!

703
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,167
She says a friend is a Perfume bottle

704
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,833
while a lover is a Soda bottle.

705
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,375
Are you all behind her after knowing all this?

706
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,708
Oh Kala master!

707
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,833
Not just that..

708
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:44,167
It's not easy to maintain city girls like us!

709
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,583
You have to call her every morning to wake her up.

710
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:48,292
Who is this?

711
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,875
You have to check her mobile balance and reacharge it.

712
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,542
You will be cut off if her balance cuts off.

713
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,083
First you should be cut.

714
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,875
If she is upset then you should be the one to cool her.

715
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,292
You should take it if she scolds you.

716
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:58,583
Ok.

717
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:01,208
But you should never go off mood in love.

718
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,625
But Love sprouts because of the mood.

719
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,417
She will talk to anyone..

720
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,083
She will laugh with anyone..

721
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,708
She will go around with anyone.

722
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,417
But you should not think ill of her.

723
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,333
But.. If you look at anyone..

724
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:14,250
oh my god!

725
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,708
You are dead meat.

726
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:18,042
You will always side with her even when she is wrong.

727
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,792
If not, you will become the wrong.

728
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,167
Everything is in phone only..

729
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,667
If you think you can meet her daily..

730
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,458
then you can never ever meet her.

731
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,792
What I should not meet?

732
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,833
Maya baby! Then why should I love you?

733
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,792
Hey Jaga.. Where are you?

734
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,167
Am in a meeting with the Altered Aghoris

735
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,542
Hey listen to me.. I need to see you immediately

736
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:39,083
That whole problem would've come because of you.

737
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:41,542
Hey! Am waiting at the office canteen. Come soon.

738
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,292
Order Pasta, I will come faster.

739
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,625
Now say.. Do you love her?

740
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,708
There is an old well at Pazhavanthagal

741
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,708
I will go and drown myself.

742
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,667
Dear Conjuring ghosts!

743
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,625
Good Bye!

744
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,000
Hey jaga..

745
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,083
Your parents could've saved a lot instead of giving birth to you all.

746
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:09,958
Jagan, becareful

747
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,833
She is playing with biology.

748
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,458
Now she is trying chemistry master.

749
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:19,708
Hey!

750
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,333
I am saying ok now.

751
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:24,083
and you won't give any reaction?

752
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,000
You put too many conditions for saying I love you.

753
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,917
How many more conditions would you put if we proceed?

754
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,583
If I agree for one free kiss today,

755
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:36,292
Tomorrow you will demonetise me as 1000 and 500 Rs.

756
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,500
Look here Maya,

757
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,083
Love is not a seasonal discount

758
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,250
to add up conditions after you enter the shop.

759
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,042
I will decide anything only after ten minutes.

760
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,417
Oh is it?!

761
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,667
Let her wait ten minutes.

762
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,000
Hello Shiv!

763
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,292
Where are you?

764
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,542
To the grave!

765
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,500
Look at them, eating all the decay.

766
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,792
Hey Maya, here he is. Come.

767
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,417
Hello Birthday Boy!

768
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,500
Why did you invite?

769
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,667
Hey! Have you become a fool like Maya?

770
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,417
Posting selfies on Facebook?

771
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,000
Hey Jaga!

772
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:12,667
Who? Me?

773
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,250
Look there man!

774
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,208
But you are there in the Photo!

775
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,125
Hey!

776
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,875
Only from the sky can someone photograph from there.

777
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:27,458
but he should be a Super Man.

778
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,583
Or did you send any selfie stick?

779
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,125
That is not possible with the mirrors.

780
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:32,917
But how?

781
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,250
Why is he staring?

782
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,292
Ok, why are you raising up like Bahubali who has seen the elephant?

783
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,792
Hey! I called you because I am confused,

784
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,125
and you keep questioning me is it?

785
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,042
Ok its just the photos right?

786
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,125
It's not about who it is dude.

787
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,708
I got a friend request on facebook today

788
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,792
I have accepted it by mistake, that is all..

789
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:51,833
every information from my birth till now

790
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,083
is being sent to me back to back as photos

791
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,542
Hey.. Who is this guy?

792
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,083
Hey.. wait man!

793
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,375
Hey! Who has created a new software to irritate me?

794
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,000
Come here, I will show you who I am!

795
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,542
Check his timeline to find who he is

796
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,083
I will scare him off.

797
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,083
I've checked it!

798
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,000
It looks empty like that CEO's head.

799
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,333
What about the email id?

800
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:13,583
Oh yes!

801
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:17,000
Didn't I say that Maya's brain does work now and then?

802
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:17,833
Super baby!

803
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,167
Hey.. Check for his email ID.

804
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,167
I will sent him a request and question him.

805
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,833
Let him accept.

806
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,167
What does it say Kamu? Say!

807
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,375
Tell me his email ID, I will handle him.

808
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,542
It says brahma@gadmail.com

809
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,625
Godmail.com? They've come from God tv to godmail?

810
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,417
Let us see.

811
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,875
He has accpeted.

812
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,125
Come to me!

813
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,250
Congratulations? Have I become a father?

814
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,208
Why congratulations?

815
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,708
What are you seeing?

816
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,625
Why has he sent my back to me?

817
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,833
How has he sent with lip mark?

818
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,042
Look at this.

819
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,125
When is this?

820
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,125
Oh my!

821
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,042
This happened just few minutes back.

822
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,750
Someone has planned all this to create problem.

823
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,875
Now you've got us into this problem too.

824
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,042
You talk this much for one photo?

825
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,292
Come here and see.

826
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,833
Has he released your private video?

827
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:21,875
That's the only thing he has not done.

828
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,875
What photo is this?

829
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,625
This incident is important the reason for my posting

830
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,708
and for that senseless guy to be the CEO.

831
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,458
What do you say?

832
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:41,167
Actually, both of us were born on the same day.

833
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,250
This same day, last year..

834
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:55,875
Happy Birthday to you!

835
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,250
Give it to Uncle first.

836
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,125
Why me? Let the parents take first.

837
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,333
Vangamudi!

838
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,958
We are glad that you are celebrating

839
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,125
our children's birthday at your place.

840
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,083
Proud to say that am your friend.

841
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,542
It's great think to celebrate the birthday of

842
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,917
two brothers' sons on the same day.

843
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:17,292
And to do it at my home is my privilege.

844
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:19,417
Still, who will have the heart to do it?

845
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,500
What is in this?

846
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:24,542
Watchout for the other things am going to do to them.

847
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,583
You are a coward man!

848
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:33,125
Have fun! Its our Birthday today!

849
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:33,958
We are kings!

850
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,417
Hey guys! Super man!

851
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:51,667
Madam, this is house of the guy

852
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:52,958
who finances our movie.

853
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,292
It is someone's Birthday.

854
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,042
It will look like you have attend the function

855
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,500
as well as get the finances for the movie.

856
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,583
How is my plan?

857
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:02,833
All that is ok.

858
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,083
Who's Birthday is it?

859
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,292
That's only thing I don't know Madam.

860
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:08,583
Hi!

861
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,667
I will get that information now Madam.

862
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,708
Sir who's Birthday?

863
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,333
Mine!

864
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:18,708
You shut up!

865
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,042
Has the bolywood star come from

866
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,000
Bombay in flight to see you? Go away!

867
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,500
Pa? What son?

868
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,083
There is an actor coming from Bombay to see you right?

869
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:24,708
Yes!

870
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,542
She has come pa.

871
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:26,333
Who is that?

872
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,167
Neethu Chandra Pa.

873
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:27,625
Give it to me!

874
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:28,792
Kamu! Ramu!

875
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,333
Hey, you spotted beauty!

876
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,667
You are a delightfully sweet Juliet!

877
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,333
Your beauty punctures my proud self.

878
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,833
Hey, you spotted beauty!

879
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,750
You are a delightfully sweet Juliet!

880
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,500
Your beauty punctures my proud self.

881
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,583
As my heart sprouts wings

882
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,583
and as I continue to dive into the dreams

883
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:16,333
your glamour surpasses my grammar.

884
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,917
Even when you scorn,

885
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,208
the heaven bows down blushing.

886
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,500
How will I explain the sorry state

887
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,750
of the earth after your smile!

888
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,375
Spell out your name...

889
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,375
Say where you are from...

890
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,958
And wouldn't that be

891
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,792
enough to make me go 'whir'?!

892
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:34,333
Give away your number...

893
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:36,333
Add to it, your mail ID...

894
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,167
Whatever it is that you say,

895
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,083
will make me go 'whir'.

896
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,750
Hey you...

897
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,583
Don't torment this Romeo

898
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,708
by covering that mole on your waist.

899
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:05,125
I am in torment!

900
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,167
Hey you...

901
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,208
Don't torment this Romeo

902
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,042
by covering that mole on your waist.

903
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,833
I am in torment!

904
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:23,000
I sigh as you

905
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,000
let out a hearty laugh, my angel.

906
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,792
I burn as my cottony

907
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,833
heart catches fire.

908
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,458
Your looks are sure to throw

909
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,958
the entire Bollywood into chaos..

910
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,375
Don't you see the confused state,

911
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,708
Kollywood is in, all thanks to you?!

912
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:40,333
Even as I get one crore likes on Facebook,

913
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,500
Why don't see I see your name in there, Mister!

914
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,458
Spell out your name...

915
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,792
Say where you are from...

916
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:50,417
And wouldn't that be enough

917
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,083
to make me go 'whir'?!

918
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,125
Give away your number...

919
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,208
Add to it, your mail ID...

920
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,042
Whatever it is that you say,

921
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,917
will make me go 'whir'.

922
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,083
Oh dear...

923
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,125
Whereever you are,

924
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,000
the sophisticated tongues will only try to butter you up...

925
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,875
Do you understand!

926
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,958
Oh my Dear!

927
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,875
Don't you realise that only

928
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,667
I'm authentic amidst all those dummies?!

929
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,125
Do you see that!

930
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,917
He only seeks to gain privileges..

931
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:45,208
You better be wary of it...

932
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,042
He only wants to play a game...

933
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,708
You better understand that.

934
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,458
Oh, I've seen enough of Johns and Jonathans...

935
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,292
Alas, you don't sense my clever mind...

936
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,500
Ask me for my name...

937
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,417
Know where I'm from...

938
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,417
Realising that I'm out of your league,

939
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,958
you get miffed.

940
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,792
Kamu! Be calm!

941
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,417
Look at your face. Go away!

942
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:11,792
Guys!

943
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,000
Let it go guys!

944
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,542
Of course, I'm a Roadside Romeo..

945
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,583
But, I do dashing tricks too...

946
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,708
Get acquainted more...

947
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,750
You will know I'm a silver star.

948
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,000
Poor boy!

949
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,167
Aunty!!

950
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,167
Waste!

951
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,083
Total damage!

952
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:08,500
Hey Ram!

953
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,083
Ram.. Neethu Chandra is aweseom right?

954
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,167
Come lets go and talk to her!

955
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,375
You pull me infront of a girl?

956
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,042
What? Am teasing you?

957
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,250
Hey it was for fun!

958
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:20,833
Oh! is that a game?

959
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:22,167
Shall we play?

960
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,125
What game?

961
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,542
I will put a toss! Ok.

962
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,208
If you win, I will do whatever you say.

963
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,625
But if I win..

964
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,500
You should do.. whatever I say!

965
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,250
Is this even a game?

966
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,042
So kiddish! Go!

967
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,042
Hey! What?

968
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,583
You said everything is a game right?

969
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:38,583
Now play!

970
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,333
Game?! Shall we play?

971
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,833
Yes play! Ok!

972
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,542
Game!

973
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,833
Heads or tails?

974
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,500
Heads!

975
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,542
Good choice.

976
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,542
Yay!!!

977
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,375
Its ok! ok. You win.

978
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,708
What should I do?

979
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:39,875
Do you see that Aunty over there?

980
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,917
That aunty's..

981
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,917
Aunty's?

982
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,292
Braids.. are not original.

983
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,208
Fake hair.

984
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:47,833
Oh!

985
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,958
You should that bring that to my hand.

986
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,833
Hey! What are you kidding?

987
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,250
I won't do that to elders.

988
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:55,417
You failed the bet right?

989
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,792
You should do whatever I say.

990
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,042
What if someone sees?

991
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,500
Oh!!

992
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:03,583
So your problem is if someone might see?

993
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,792
Ok.

994
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:07,583
I will switch off the main.

995
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,083
You go in the dark..

996
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,542
pick it and give it to me. Ok?

997
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:12,833
Ok right?

998
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:13,708
What man?

999
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:14,750
It's a simple thing.

1000
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:15,500
Ramu?

1001
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:18,292
Will you switch it off correctly?

1002
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,708
Kamu!! Am your brother.

1003
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,458
Trust me.

1004
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,542
Ok.

1005
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,042
Hey brother..

1006
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:38,458
Aunty?

1007
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Eat some cake.

1008
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,042
Here.

1009
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:43,625
Ok Aunty. One is enough.

1010
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,542
For me? Eat. One more?

1011
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,042
Oh you are here?

1012
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:49,583
Thanks Aunty

1013
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,667
Brother..wait..

1014
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:50,958
What sir?

1015
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:51,667
Coming

1016
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,833
Am sorry! Sorry boss!

1017
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,250
Are you hitting us?

1018
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,000
Am sorry!

1019
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:55,500
But..

1020
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:57,500
Hey.. Why is the light the same?

1021
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,042
Ok. Am going now.

1022
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,125
Ready 1 2 3

1023
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:10,917
Here you go.

1024
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,458
I have diabetes.

1025
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,708
What? Diabetes?

1026
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:16,333
Yes, Doctor said.

1027
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,583
How will our people have diabetes?

1028
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:20,833
Brother does not have diabetes is it?

1029
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,542
Is it just diabetes which will not infect your brother with?

1030
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:26,750
Then? What else will not come?

1031
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,000
Shouldn't talk ill of elders.

1032
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:29,792
Ill meaning?

1033
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,500
Why are you staring at me?

1034
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,375
What have you done?

1035
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,000
Sorry!

1036
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,417
I thought it was partially fake.

1037
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,167
Take it pls.

1038
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,250
Mama! He has taken it out!

1039
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,667
You fool!

1040
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,375
You have let the family secret

1041
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,333
Don't you have respect for your elders?

1042
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,042
Had this incident not happened?

1043
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,875
Hey, is this even an incident?

1044
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,708
This is your Uncle's problem not family problem.

1045
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,583
Don't you have respect for your elders?

1046
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:15,500
Because they said they will not advertise my Tamarind brand

1047
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,792
I started my own advertisement company.

1048
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,375
Thats how important pride is for me.

1049
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:20,875
With rich family heritage.

1050
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:21,667
Ok let it go.

1051
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,500
Because you are my Friend's son..

1052
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,792
I have asked them to employ you here.

1053
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:26,667
You.. Brother?

1054
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:27,208
Do something for him.

1055
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:27,750
Sure we will do.

1056
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,375
Sir..

1057
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:29,542
Yes Gentleman!

1058
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:30,458
I will check it out brother.

1059
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:32,333
Hold on a moment.

1060
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,000
You!

1061
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:33,625
Uncle?

1062
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,792
Say something about Tamarind now!

1063
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,292
Impressive. He is a gold medalist.

1064
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:41,083
Uncle.. A forest is nothing without a tiger..

1065
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,625
Likewise, a house is nothing without a tamarind.

1066
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,208
Amazing!

1067
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,750
You are employed here..

1068
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,750
for just this one concept.

1069
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,375
Get him employed here.

1070
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:50,958
Sure brother.

1071
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:52,875
Young man!

1072
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,667
For your qualification

1073
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,417
You are fit for the CEO position.

1074
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,417
Yes, Yes.

1075
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,958
But this man is basically an idiot..

1076
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,583
Uncultured brute.

1077
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:00,500
Right.. Right..

1078
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,792
He is unncessarily angry with you.

1079
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,708
I will put you as a program producer.

1080
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,833
Is it ok for you?

1081
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,417
Sir.. It's ok sir.

1082
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:07,125
Brother he is ok with it.

1083
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:07,917
Give it to him.

1084
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,417
Ok. You are appointed.

1085
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,125
Congratulations.

1086
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:10,958
Thank you sir.

1087
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,417
Hey..

1088
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:11,792
Uncle..

1089
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,417
Henceforth, be respectful.

1090
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,750
What's the point in education then?

1091
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,292
Uncle!

1092
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,042
Oh! Welcome.

1093
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,375
I was waiting for you.

1094
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:26,792
Come in!

1095
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,875
Lets finish it within the auspicious time.

1096
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,833
Your work is over. You can leave.

1097
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:45,458
Had I won the toss that day..

1098
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,625
I would've been the CEO of this company today.

1099
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,875
Hey.. enough of your Bahubali two story.

1100
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,667
It's all in the past.

1101
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:52,708
Who is posting the photos?

1102
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,583
Tell me that.

1103
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:57,333
I doubt CEO Ram.

1104
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,083
Hey.. He is a worthless vessel..

1105
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,500
A complete waste.

1106
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,667
He uploads your photo to irritate you ok.

1107
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,625
There is a logic in that.

1108
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:05,542
Think about it.

1109
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,333
How did I get photos in my mobile?

1110
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:09,833
Are you saying he spies through Maya?

1111
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,208
I don't think it's a normal matter dude!

1112
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,833
Hey who hurts my Maya baby?

1113
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,417
Hey! He is Union Manager.

1114
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,042
Be quiet.

1115
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,750
So he can hit anyone? What is this?

1116
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,208
Hey.. I will nasty you.

1117
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,667
Come to me if you have guts!

1118
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:30,958
He is not a ordinary staff..

1119
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,542
Don't touch him. Then it will lead to strike.

1120
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,917
For touching my girl friend I should be doing the strike.

1121
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:35,750
Why should he strike?

1122
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:36,667
Understand dude please.

1123
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,125
Hey.. Jagan.. See this.

1124
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,292
Yes baby! Is it our photo?

1125
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,875
Look at this.

1126
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:14,125
Hey! You've won!

1127
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,875
What is the point in winning today?

1128
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,042
I should've won that day.

1129
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,458
Hey is there a branch of Puzhal prison here?

1130
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,042
Oh it is food for bell at your office is it?

1131
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,250
Hey this is my idea.

1132
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,000
No one comes to seat after lunch.

1133
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:27,583
So I suggested this bell idea.

1134
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:30,042
Even he laughed at it like you do today.

1135
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,792
They have implemented that today.

1136
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:32,792
What world is this?

1137
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,292
Ok. If i don't go to my seat

1138
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,000
He will make that a reason to blame me.

1139
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:37,000
Ok we will see this later.

1140
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,333
Will meet in the evening ok? Bye

1141
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:40,208
Evening meet in the sense? Is it party again?

1142
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,958
Hey sorry, I forgot to tell you.

1143
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,000
My girl has invited me for dinner today.

1144
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:46,000
What? girl? Dude! Congratulations!

1145
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,042
What all good?

1146
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,583
Nothing like you think.

1147
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,917
Only Birthday treat.

1148
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,458
hey don't you feel ashamed?

1149
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,958
She is giving treat for your birthday

1150
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,250
And you are inviting us for that?

1151
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,583
Well.. When Mr. Kumbakonam invites, can I say no?

1152
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,167
Anyway.. I will come with my Girl Friend.

1153
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,167
Your girl?

1154
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,125
Dude.. I told you that Maya is my baby now right?

1155
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:02,000
Look at the seal behind!

1156
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:02,750
Jaga!!

1157
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,583
Ok. Come together.

1158
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:07,000
Hey, but to which restaurant are we going?

1159
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:07,875
I will text you.

1160
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:09,125
Bye bye!

1161
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:12,333
Good.. They are doing our work.

1162
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,000
This flower was not here..

1163
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,208
I saw this in my dream?

1164
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:21,083
Brother? Sir?

1165
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,417
What is all this flower? New?

1166
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,250
Sir.. you asked me to spray it regularly.

1167
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,292
Am taking care good sir.

1168
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:29,917
When did I say?

1169
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:30,708
Anything wrong sir?

1170
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,375
Alright.. You carry on.

1171
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,083
Manisha?

1172
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,417
I did these projects yesterday..

1173
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:45,042
It's ok. Sir?

1174
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:47,167
Can you check if it is correct?

1175
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:51,083
Hey... Office..

1176
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,375
I think it will be right.. Can you check once?

1177
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,083
This too..

1178
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:55,875
Sir.. Uh? Where?

1179
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,583
Oh.... Sit sit..

1180
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,875
When did they set up all this?

1181
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,000
Who is at the cabin?

1182
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:12,000
Hello! Who is that?

1183
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:14,542
Sir?

1184
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,417
Sir?

1185
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,458
You?

1186
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:18,458
What are you doing here?

1187
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,042
With respect? Wow!

1188
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:23,333
Sir.. Am preparing for that pickle company ad.

1189
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,500
Pickle?

1190
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,583
But.. isn't that my seat?

1191
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,542
Sir.. mother promise this is my seat.

1192
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,083
Your seat will be in your cabin.

1193
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,667
In my cabin?

1194
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,250
Then... Where is my cabin?

1195
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,375
Where is my cabin?!?

1196
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,250
How can a cabin get lost?

1197
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,333
Sir.. your CEO cabin is just there.

1198
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:47,917
What is he saying?

1199
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:49,500
Sir..Any problem?

1200
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:53,833
It's.. It's ok.

1201
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:57,583
CEO cabin... Cabin is my cabin?

1202
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,375
Hey! Why didnt you come to canteen?

1203
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,667
Work is important than food.

1204
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,042
Don't you think it's too much?

1205
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:12,292
How is this... possible?

1206
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,250
What is happening?

1207
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:29,958
Kamu!

1208
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:33,417
Calm!

1209
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,875
What happened?

1210
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:48,542
I went to the temple in the morning!

1211
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,667
I was a bit harsher with Brahma.

1212
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:55,708
Then.. I got a request from Brahma on Facebook.

1213
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,917
I accepted it.

1214
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,125
Then I told Jagan about it.

1215
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,833
He changed the coin.

1216
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,417
If the coin had changed for real?

1217
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:17,375
Everything you wished for will happen as it is.

1218
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,125
Then?!

1219
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:38,208
Hello!

1220
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,417
Hello Amma? Amma am CEO!

1221
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,042
Hey! Why are you shouting?

1222
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,250
Amma.. I have become the CEO.

1223
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,333
Aren't you the CEO for the past one year?

1224
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,583
What's new about it?

1225
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,917
For one year?

1226
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:53,625
Hold on a minute!

1227
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,833
Will you let me watch one movie?!

1228
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,042
We will talk everything in the evening when you come home.

1229
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:02,583
Home?

1230
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,000
Am busy..

1231
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:03,458
Where are you now?

1232
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,042
I am watching film at our home only.

1233
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,292
What is your problem now?

1234
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:07,708
No Ma.. Thats...

1235
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:08,500
Maa..

1236
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:10,542

1237
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:13,125
Hey.. People from Lions club has come to meet me.

1238
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:15,083

1239
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:16,458
Hello Madam!

1240
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,208

1242
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,917
What else?!

1243
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:35,792

1244
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:50,208

1245
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,083

01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:08,708

1250
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,542

1251
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:23,417
Sir?

1252
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,917
Why did Manish go over there?

1253
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,542
Happy Birthday Sir!

1254
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:30,042
I told you that I have to leave at 3..

1255
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:34,208
Why? To get drunk with friends?

1256
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:37,000
Go Man! Go and do your work. Go!

1257
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,458
Stupid guy!

1258
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:44,250
Sir.. How did you know that I was going to drink?

1259
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,708
That's the tactics! Go away!

1260
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,000
Happy Birthday Sir..

1261
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:52,750
Get Out!

1262
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,292
Manisha.. What do i do?

1263
01:01:58,167 --> 01:01:59,167
Rameshwaran!

1264
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,958
Mr. Ram!

1265
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,417
What project have you designed?

1266
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,000
Client is tearing me up!

1267
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,125
Do you know how difficult it is to get a project?

1268
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,958
I want this cleared in one hour.

1269
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,083
File should be sent to my cabin.

1270
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:10,667
Do you understand?

1271
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:13,250
Hey! Manisha!

1272
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,417
What are you doing here?

1273
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:18,542
Sir.. I told you in the morning right?

1274
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:20,167
That's going on.

1275
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,167
With him?

1276
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,375
Yes with me... Personal.

1277
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,042
Keep your personal work out of office.

1278
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:28,083
This is an office. You understand?

1279
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,667
Sir? I said the same thing in the morning.

1280
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,583
You behaved very decent then.

1281
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,042
All of a sudden you react..

1282
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,042
like a black and white movie villain?

1283
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:36,625
Are you ok?

1284
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,458
Like everyone...

1285
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:48,625
Is Manisha assuming that I am the CEO?

1286
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:49,750
So?

1287
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:51,625
Manisha could be seeing him?

1288
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:52,625
Hello!

1289
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:58,792
Afternoon!

1290
01:02:58,792 --> 01:02:59,375

1291
01:02:59,417 --> 01:02:59,917
Good afternoon Sir!

1292
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,875
Afternoon!

1293
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,042
How are you all?

1294
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,542
Happy Birthday!

1295
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:06,875
Thank you sir!

1296
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,125
What brings you here?

1297
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:09,208
Well...

1298
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,000
Our company model is here! So I...

1299
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:11,583
Let others take care of that!

1300
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,292
My model is here to meet you!

1301
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:19,792
Darling!

1302
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:20,625
Come Dear!

1303
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:28,958
No! Don't be in a Hurry!

1304
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:31,708
Happy Birthday Darling!

1305
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:33,500
For your well being,

1306
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,875
early in the morning,

1307
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,375
I went to the temple and

1308
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:42,375
prayed to all the gods!

1309
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,083
Everyone is watching!

1310
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,458
I feel shy!

1311
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:48,333
Come Darling!

1312
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,333
Let's go inside and Talk!

1313
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:51,125
Sir?!?!

1314
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:51,708
No! No!

1315
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:53,083
I wont disturb!

1316
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,000
Drop her at home in the evening!

1317
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,833
I have a lot of work to do!

1318
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,667
Come Darling!

1319
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:58,708
Father gave permission!

1320
01:03:58,750 --> 01:03:59,250
But Sir...!

1321
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,417
What are you guys staring at?

1322
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:02,542
Sit and resume your work!

1323
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,625
Don't use Shampoo!

1324
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:06,792
Bathe after applying oil.

1325
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:09,208
It's good for both your head and body!

1326
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:12,375
Darling!

1327
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:16,500
I went to the temple to pray for you!

1328
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,667
I asked the priest

1329
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,458
if my wish will come true...

1330
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,708
He said the wish will

1331
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:23,167
come true if the flower is white

1332
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,667
And it won't happen if the flower is Pink.

1333
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,750
After that, I gave him Rs.500.

1334
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,875
He used all the white flowers and said

1335
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,375
whatever I wished for will happen!

1336
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,333
Then,

1337
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:46,500
I had a dream early in the morning!

1338
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:47,750
In the dream,

1339
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,292
We both were married!

1340
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,708
We had 10 children together!

1341
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,625
All the 10 children were beautiful like me!

1342
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,583
They had your hair!

1343
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:06,917
It can't be!

1344
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:07,333
Darling!

1345
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:13,000
I know you have been waiting
for a long time to be with me.

1346
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,167
You're not alone.

1347
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:16,833
I'm also waiting for you!

1348
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,500
Yes?

1349
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,458
Oh my!

1350
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,250
Oh it's late!

1351
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,167
Well... I'll make a leave.

1352
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,125
Wait Darling!

1353
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,083
Ain't you supposed to drop me?

1354
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,375
Let's go together.

1355
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,042
Ram...

1356
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,417
I am the one inviting you.

1357
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:38,500
Why are you hesitant?

1358
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:41,208
Do you have any problem in
going out for dinner with me?

1359
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,708
Ram. I have an idea.

1360
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:05,500
Can I ask?

1361
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:09,042
Shall we go in your bike?

1362
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,667
Why? What happened to your car?

1363
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,750
I want to go in a bike.

1364
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,083
Won't you take me for a ride?

1365
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,292
Darling! Get inside darling!

1366
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,833
Let's go!

1367
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:40,333
Darling!

1368
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:41,417
Come Darling!

1369
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,167
Get inside!

1370
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,083
My hand...Hand....

1371
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:51,542
Hey!

1372
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:52,958
Why are you in a bike?

1373
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:54,292
Shall I drop you?

1374
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,208
Darling!

1375
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,500
You are supposed to drop me!

1376
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,792
Sir... You seem really busy!

1377
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,375
It's okay! We will go in the bike.

1378
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:03,583
Hi Ma'am!

1379
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:04,417
Bye Bye!

1380
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:05,500
Bye Ma'am!

1381
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,125
Bye Sir!

1382
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:10,625
Let's go!

1383
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:32,958
Excuse me!

1384
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:34,500
Whose house is this?

1385
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,458
Isn't this your house?

1386
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:41,250
Sir?

1387
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,208
Okay Sir!

1388
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,250
Is this my house?

1389
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,250
What else has changed?

1390
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,208
Hey!

1391
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,375
Hi Bro!

1392
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:57,375
What happened?

1393
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:58,958
You are home early today.

1394
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,375
You are home, Kamu!

1395
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,292
Is your office over today? You're early!

1396
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,042
What happened?

1397
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,583
Why were you blabbering when
you called in the morning?

1398
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:10,917
What happened to you?

1399
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:16,875
Amma...

1400
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:21,750
Ma...

1401
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,292
Hi dude!

1402
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:23,708
When did you come?

1403
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:24,750
Appa...

1404
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,750
He looks disturbed from the morning!

1405
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:27,750
Ask him what's wrong!

1406
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,125
Why Man?

1407
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:29,625
Whatsup?

1408
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:32,583
No... Nothing...

1409
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:34,250
Wait a second!

1410
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,250
I am the one who is drinking!

1411
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:37,417
You are normal!

1412
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,375
Where are you going?

1413
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,333
That's your room!

1414
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:43,500
Are you okay?

1415
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:44,750
Yea!

1416
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,500
He stares like the way you
stared at me when we first met.

1417
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,875
What are you talking!

1418
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:53,333
With our son around!

1419
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,000
What's happening here?

1420
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,875
How did they all come here?

1421
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:58,583
They all seem to be happy!

1422
01:08:58,875 --> 01:08:59,625
Is it all true?

1423
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:03,958
Hello?

1424
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,292
Hey Kamu!

1425
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:05,625
Where are you?

1426
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:06,583
You asked us to come

1427
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:07,625
and you're missing now!

1428
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:09,042
Well...

1429
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,792
We though you will bring your
girl and give us a treat.

1430
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:12,625
But she is here

1431
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:14,583
giving a treat to your company CEO.

1432
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,417
What did you say? come again?

1433
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,833
Oh! Now you can't hear too?

1434
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,708
Your girl Manisha...

1435
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:24,500
Is giving a treat to your
company CEO, that white Panda.

1436
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:26,750
He is the CEO...

1437
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:27,917
I am the Director right?

1438
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,625
What is confusing in that?

1439
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh thank God!

1440
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,500
Dude! Where are you right now?

1441
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:33,375
I want to meet you right now!

1442
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,750
What? your yet to start?

1443
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,500
Then wait, I'll come there!

1444
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:38,958
hey...Don't go somewhere

1445
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:39,833
I'll give you anothere address.

1446
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,458
You come here.

1447
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,125
Dude

1448
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,083
It's like watching the movie "

1449
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,167
Back to the future" in Tamil.

1450
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,917
How do you think it looks for me?

1451
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:53,500
You wrote something random

1452
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,792
on Facebook and left!

1453
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:55,583
From then on,

1454
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,625
I am the CEO of this company in
everyone's mind in the world.

1455
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:00,167
That bugger is recorded in their minds

1456
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,500
as the programme producer
of this company.

1457
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,250
I think

1458
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:06,708
Bramma's facebook account

1459
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,375
is the reason for all this.

1460
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,750
Something is wrong in that.

1461
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:10,792
Dude!

1462
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:12,500
How is it that the two of us alone

1463
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,000
are aware of the actual reality?

1464
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:15,292
Hello boys!

1465
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,500
Am also here!

1466
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:17,750
I too can see the reality?

1467
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:18,750
oh Yes...

1468
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:19,917
Simple logic dude!

1469
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:20,583
Are you expecting

1470
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,708
Bill Gates to come and clear this doubt?

1471
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,625
Guess why we alone can

1472
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:23,500
understand the reality?

1473
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:24,875
Because only the three of

1474
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:25,417
us are in that account.

1475
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:26,875
yea?

1476
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,750
What am I supposed to do now?

1477
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,500
Why are you tensed dude?

1478
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:32,875
Without participating
in any reality show,

1479
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,917
your life changed to
upside down overnight.

1480
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:37,750
You shouldn't be worried!

1481
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,250
You should thank Bramma and

1482
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,750
give us a treat in Gamma.

1483
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:42,792
Maya wore a sexy dress for this!

1484
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,833
Why did I crave for this life?

1485
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:49,042
It was for Manisha!

1486
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,375
It was for her!

1487
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,250
I would be equal to her status

1488
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:53,917
if I could be the CEO.

1489
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,708
Then I can confess my

1490
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,583
love for her confidently!

1491
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:58,833
Now it's not possible.

1492
01:10:58,875 --> 01:10:59,167
Dude!

1493
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:00,708
Now you have the life you wished for

1494
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,875
What is bothering you now?

1495
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,208
I've got everything now!

1496
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,833
But She left me!

1497
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Why? Did she shift her house?

1498
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:09,625
Come here

1499
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:10,542
Come!

1500
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:11,875
Look at my Manisha...

1535
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,375

01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:53,000
That is not future. Thats a big torture.

1562
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:54,167
Wait now..

1563
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,667
Its not happened yet.

1564
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:57,542
It's only predicting.

1565
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,833
Looking at it makes me nervous.

1566
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:01,208
Lets think clearly.

1567
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,458
According to this photo.

1568
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,292
To get married with this girl..

1569
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,292
You have to waer green hospital dress.

1570
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,125
Even if you are going to be in ICU..

1571
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,375
you will never wear that dress.

1572
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:10,625
We will see how this marriage happens.

1573
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,917
Dude.. Your yesterday's life was different

1574
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:15,000

1577
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,500
But we will try to handle it practically.

1578
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,167
Ok now?

1579
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:19,917

1580
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,333

1581
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,583
Not yet..

1582
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,417

1588
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:35,958

So what do I say?

1595
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:58,250
Why don't you propose before him?

1596
01:14:58,292 --> 01:15:00,000
Is it possible?

1597
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,042

They want social security.

1601
01:15:07,542 --> 01:15:09,167
Will he take care of her forever?

1602
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,333
Will he give money at all the time?

1603
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:12,625

Madam? How did you..?

1761
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:54,667
Bloddy idiot.. I listened to my Manager..

1762
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:57,000
And signed a blank paper and

1763
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,167
got caught with this mental crowd!

1764
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:01,208
And that idiot Manager has also disappered.

First let the bride and groom exchange rings.

1772
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,083
Then elders can exchange plates..

1773
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,417
Bring the rings!

1774
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,625

1782
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:47,500

01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:49,583

What is this Mama?

1786
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:54,333
It has become a fashion of this generation.

01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:58,583

This is from my interview..

01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:47,958

Thank you.

1816
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:12,292
See the guy who left now?

1817
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,000
Your cousin?

1818
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:16,208
He is highly educated like you..

1819
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:20,417
But I want to give the full responsibility to you..

1820
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:21,583
What is that?

1821
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,208

Not just CEO.. I will give you Car, Bunglow everything.

You can bring your whole family here..

1825
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,417
What do you say?

1826
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,750
I want you to do one thing for that.

1827
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,792
I have a daughter..

1828
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:40,208
No one in my family line has hair growth.

1829
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,500
That is the problem.

1830
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:44,208
But if she uses wig..

1831
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:46,750
she will look like an angel!

1832
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,667
If you marry her, I will give you everything i said.

1833
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:51,292
What do you say?

1834
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:55,125
Don't think..

1835
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:59,042
Car, Bunglow.. everything will be yours.

1836
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:00,667
What do you say?

1837
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:04,417
Shouldn't be like that.That's wrong.

1838
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,208
Ok Sir.

1839
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:11,292

Brother.. Do you remember all this?

I beleive only the documents!

1856

I didnt invite your family here..

1857
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,625
For your comfort.

1858
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,500
It was for my comfort.

1859
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,708
If you think anything different from this?

1860
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:14,750
This Vanangamudi might be a business man..

1861
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:17,833
But am a very bad man when upset.

1862
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:21,917
Remember this and talk to my daughter.

1863
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:22,875
Hey!!

1864
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:25,625

Yes now brother! Madam?

1866
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,250

01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:36,917
You will talk!

1868
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,958
Kamu! You are dead meat!

1869
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:50,750
What is it Mama?

1870
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,125
You said you wanted to talk alone?

1871
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,958
Talk Mama!

1872
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:57,125
Do you really like me?

1873
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,333
Oh My!

1874
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:07,667
Go away! I don't want any marriage!

1875
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,708
If I dont like you then why did I come to your..

1876
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,792
Office to give rose and wish you?

1877
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:13,792
What noise over there Maaplai?

1878
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,750
No.. Nothing Uncle. We are just talking!

1879
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,167
Oh how do I fix this?!

1880
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:21,875
Don't cry Please! I beg you!

1881
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,583
I am waiting here for someone's Love.

1882
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,208
I shouldn't be friends with these guys.

1883
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,083
What are you doing?

1884
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:29,625
Look at the happiness on my girl!

1885
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,167
I have also signed a document.

1886
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:32,125

1887
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:33,667
Sister.. watch that!

1888
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,208
Mama.. Look at my small darling.

1889
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:35,833
He is a Lion!

1890
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:36,792
Hello! Tell me!

1891
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,333
Kameshwara! Are you kidding me?!

1892
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:39,333
Are you coming or not?

1893
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:41,625
There is a problem going on here!

1894
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,875
Come soon.. If not I will charge you for waiting.

1895
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:45,542
Ok am coming, Bye.

1896
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:47,667

1897
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:51,000
Uncle? Did everything go fine?

1898
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,417
I have a urgent work.

1899
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:54,333
Talk other thing with my parents.

1900
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:55,375
I will leave.

1901
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,125
Darling?

1902
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:04,750
Brother! One minute!

1903
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,917
Swamy? Check how the day is tomorrow?

1904
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,250
Tomorrow is an auspicious day only.

1905
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:19,375
Then we will fix the marriage tomorrow.

1906
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,125
Hey! Get the marriage hall ready then.

1907
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:22,333
But why this hurry?

1908
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,667
I don't feel right about something.

1909
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,542
Why should we postpone the good thing?

1910
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:27,583
Lets do it tomorrow!

1911
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,625
Mama.. Shouldn't we invite our relatives?

1912
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:31,167
Everyone is here only.

01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,667
Hey! Won't you all come?

1914
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,292

Brother..

1921
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:47,792
You have become darker in roaming across chennai.

1922
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:50,833
This Vanangamudi was born darker!

1923
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:11,583
These models don't look good

1924
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:12,792
even from far away.

1925
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,750
Hi Bro.....!

1926
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:17,750

1927
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,292
Boys catch it..

01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:25,667
Oh My God.. Please.. Don't.

1929
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,042
Run...

1930
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:26,833
Don't hit me..

1931
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,500
Is this a Bigboss show... Let me go.

1932
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,458
Hit him..

1933
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:30,792

1934
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,042
Kameshwara...Where did you go?

1935
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:32,708

01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,333

1937
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:35,000

01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,792
Hey... Hey... wait...

1939
01:29:37,042 --> 01:29:38,625
Why are you hitting him? What did he do?

1940
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:39,458
Good morning Sir.

1941
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,458
He was secretly watching

1942
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,125
Manisha Ma'am at the shooting spot.

1943
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:43,000
Bloody beggar!

1944
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,042
Many people look at models as they wish.

1945
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:45,292
Aint you paying her for that?

1946
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,500
Why did you hire her then?

1947
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,292
Look at him sir..

1948
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:48,833

1949
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:49,917
2 minutes sir... boys...

1950
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:51,542
Wait... wait... He is my friend.

1951
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,667
I thought so... Very nice person sir.

1952
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:54,333
He is a gentleman.

1953
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,417
nice creativity sir

1954
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,292
He was explaining many scenes.

1955
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:00,125
Production.. give some juice for Sir.

1956
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,250
So Sir... I know Maniratnam very well.

1957
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:02,583
Get lost.

1958
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:03,417
Hello...

1959
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:03,708
Oh my...

1960
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,208
Can't you be careful?

1961
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,750
Can't you come a little early?

1962
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:08,625
Leave it

1963
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:09,208
Where is Manisha?

1964
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:09,917
Why?

1965
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:11,417
So she could give the
rest of the beatings?

1966
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,167
Come...

1967
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:12,708
Is it paining?

1968
01:30:12,917 --> 01:30:14,167
What happened now?

1969
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,417
They hit me in the mouth.

1970
01:30:15,417 --> 01:30:16,917
Why are you holding my hand?

1971
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,708
I just peeped and they thrashed me.

1972
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,750
I don't know what they will do to
you when you confess your love.

1973
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,542
I think everyone here work as sleeper cell.

1974
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,375
Oh my...

1975
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:53,750
Good morning Sir...

1976
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:57,667
Hey... Wait...

1977
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,125
He is going to sacrifice himself.

1978
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:01,833
What can we do?

1979
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:03,667
Can you caress me?

1980
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:05,000
Am good. Thanks.

1981
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:05,917
Am good. Thanks.

1982
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:07,458
How is the Shoot going?

1983
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,458
It's all good sir.

1984
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:10,542
I need to talk to you alone.

1985
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:13,875
Yes sir.

1986
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,083
Excuse me Sir...

1987
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:19,583
Yes

1988
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,458
Actually, Am very happy Today.

1989
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:22,667
Because,

1990
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,208
the person I like the most

1991
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,125
proposed to me today.

1992
01:31:26,667 --> 01:31:29,542
He also gave me a gift I like the most.

1993
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:32,583
Such beautiful gifts...

1994
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:34,917
It's the same watch.

1995
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:39,625
Hi Sir...

1996
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,625
Today, Am in a good mood.

1997
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:48,667
I can listen to whatever you say.

1998
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,417
Tell me.

1999
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:52,625
Well.. Let's talk about this tomorrow.

2000
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:54,083

01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:55,458
Sir. It's okay. Please tell me.

2002
01:31:56,042 --> 01:31:56,875
Let's talk tomorrow.

2003

Okay...Bye!

Kamu!

2007
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:11,083
What happened?

2008
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:14,958
It's too late.

2009
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:16,083
It's okay.

2010
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:17,208
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

2011
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:20,292
Everything happened...

2012
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:23,125
Hi... Am Maya.

2013
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:23,958
Kamu's friend.

2014
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,750
Are you in Facebook?

2015
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,667
Well... I have a Fan Page.

2016
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:28,083
Not that.

2017
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:29,750
Give me your personal facebook ID.

2018
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:31,875
Why?

2019
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:32,833

2020
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:33,458
Hey Maya...

2021
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:34,542
What are you doing?

2022
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:36,500
Kamu...

2023
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:37,917
Don't you understand?

2024
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,750
Only the three of us can
understand the reality.

2025
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:40,208
Why?

2026
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:41,917
All three of us are there in that acount.

2027
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:44,417
What if we add Manisha in that account?

2028
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:46,500
Genius!

2029
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:48,292
Manisha...

2030
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:48,708
Sir

2031
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:49,542
Give me your mail ID?

2032
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:50,917
Why sir?

2033
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:51,875
Just give it.

2034
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:52,750
I'll explain you later

2035
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:53,083
Give it.

2036
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:53,750
Sir.. I don't understand...

2037
01:32:53,792 --> 01:32:55,042
Hello Sir...

2038
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:57,333
Manisha... Please trust me...

2039
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:58,583
Give me your facebook ID...

2040
01:32:58,583 --> 01:32:59,125
Hey... what happened?

2041
01:32:59,333 --> 01:32:59,875
I don't know...

2042
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:01,833
Sir said he wanted to talk about something

2043
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:02,917
But he left all of a sudden.

2044
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,833
Now they are asking for my Email ID.

2045
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:05,667
I don't know why!

2046
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,375
Manisha, It's different.

2047
01:33:07,417 --> 01:33:08,458
I'll explain everything.

2048
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:09,875
But first give me your Facebook ID.

2049
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:10,292
Sir?

2050
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,542
Manisha...

2051
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:14,417
Give me your email ID and

2052
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:15,750
you will understand everything after that.

2053
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:16,375
Note down.

2054
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,458
Note down.. Note down..

2055
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:22,167
If something happens to him,

2056
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,583
I won't leave you alive.

2057
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:24,167

Who is it? Show me.

2059
01:33:28,917 --> 01:33:29,458
Is it she?

2060
01:33:31,917 --> 01:33:32,458
Is it she?

2061
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:34,250

Please listen to me.

2064
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:36,292
I didn't do it on purpose.

2065
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:37,458
Remember what brother said,

2066
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:39,000

2067
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:40,042

01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:45,667

01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:46,708

Manisha..Wait...

2079
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,208
I can't help him.

2080
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:52,292
Manisha...

2081
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:52,833
Close it.

2082
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:53,625
Manisha...

2083
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:55,833
Oh God!

2084
01:33:58,458 --> 01:33:58,875
Manisha...

2085
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:02,042
Why are you tensed?

2086
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:03,958
You are no way related
to what happened now.

2087
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:05,208
You give me your mail ID.

2088
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:05,542
Excuse me!

2089
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:07,208
Bloody Idiot!

2090
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:07,792
Bug off!

2091
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:09,583
She slapped me!

2092
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:10,042
You deserve it!

2093
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,042
You should know the situation.

2094
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:11,417
I'll take care.

2095
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:11,833
You leave!

2096
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:13,583
Manisha!

2097
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:14,000
Jega!

2098
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,250
Sir! What are you looking at?

2099
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,458
Do something Sir!

2100
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:18,833
He is not only your staff.

2101
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,167
He is your relation too.

2102
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:20,625
Sir!

2103
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,083
I know the IG very well Sir!

2104
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,167
But he is not in the city sir!

2105
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:23,708
Get lost!

2106
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:24,083
Okay

2107
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:26,792
Manisha...

2108
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:27,458
Manisha...

2109
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:28,083
Let's go.

2110
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:28,583
Come... Come....

2111
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,208
Let's go inside.

2112
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:29,458
Come!

2113
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:31,750
Stop worrying about it!

2114
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:32,542
I'll take care of it.

2115
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,333
First you calm down.

2116
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:34,083
Calm down!

2117
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,208
What's happening here?

2118
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:43,792
Who are those men?

2119
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:45,625
Why did they Kidnap him?

2120
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:48,000
I don't know what happened to him...

2121
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:49,750
I am scared!

2122
01:34:57,042 --> 01:34:58,417
Why are you silent Sir?

2123
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:00,167
Take some steps sir!

2124
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:01,000
Please Sir!

2125
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,875
Please bring him to me sir!

2126
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:03,250
Please sir!

2127
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:03,542
Okay!

2128
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,167
Manisha....

2129
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:04,875
Manisha....

2130
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:05,333
Relax...

2131
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:06,083
Calm down...

2132
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:06,875
Let me take care of it

2133
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:07,875
Sit here!

2134
01:35:08,042 --> 01:35:08,833
You have a coffee.

2135
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:09,917
I'll take care of the rest. Okay?

2136
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,417
Brother!

2137
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:11,500
One coffee please!

2138
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:12,042
Okay Sir.

2139
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:12,833
Please sir.

2140
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:13,542
I'll take care of it.

2141
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,250
I'll make a call.

2142
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,167
I'll save him.

2143
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:21,208
Madam... Coffee!

2144
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,167
Hello? Inspector Sir?

2145
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:25,875
It's me, Kameshwaran Sir.

2146
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:30,208
My employee, Ram was kidnapped
today by someone sir.

2147
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:32,583
Can you please take some action sir?

2148
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:35,250
Sure Sir!

2149
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:36,083
I'll come sir.

2150
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:36,667
Sure sir!

2151
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:37,083
I'll come sir!

2152
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:38,875
Thank you so much sir!

2153
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,875
They have asked us to come
to the station in an hour!

2154
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,042
It's going to be fine.

2155
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:44,458
Don't worry! Relax.

2156
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:45,333
Sit down.

2157
01:35:45,708 --> 01:35:46,167
Let me do it.

2158
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:47,542
Thank you!

2159
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:47,958
Okay sir

2160
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:50,083
We have an hour.

2161
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:51,542
You have this coffee.

2162
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:52,625
It will be alright!

2163
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:25,250
Oh my beloved Lady...

2164
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:28,417
Why would you disturb
the clarity of my love?

2165
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:31,250
The resulting bruise isn't
particular to my eyes,

2166
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,125
didn't you know that, Darling?

2167
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:44,750
It wasn't my eyes but rather
my heart that got violated.

2168
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:51,958
Every waking day... Your thoughts
break the stillness in me.

2169
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:58,042
Every time I bathe... Your
fragrance permeates my brain

2170
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:03,958
Crossing the streets doesn't end
without my eyes searching for you...

2171
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:11,125
Even as the rest of the world naps, my
world continues to swirl around you...

2172
01:37:11,208 --> 01:37:17,125
All I have, I owe to you...

2173
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:23,333
All I have, I owe to you...

2174
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:01,667
Right as the first gaze we held,

2175
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:06,833
mesmerized, I  surrendered at your feet.

2176
01:38:11,167 --> 01:38:13,375
To the one word you uttered,

2177
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:19,083
my definition of language blanked out.

2178
01:38:22,042 --> 01:38:28,833
To that one serene smile, I
swapped my very identity.

2179
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:33,625
The times you were beside me,
were when I forgot my very life.

2180
01:38:34,542 --> 01:38:39,250
Whichever it is that vanishes,
just 'you' is enough for me.

2181
01:39:04,125 --> 01:39:06,875
Every time my thought flipped in your mind,

2182
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:09,958
I felt it in my pulsating
heart.

2183
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:12,875
For every drop of water
that touched your body,

2184
01:39:13,042 --> 01:39:16,250
I trembled
feeling that coldness.

2185
01:39:16,458 --> 01:39:21,875
Holding your hands had given me the
guts to win over the world at times...

2186
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,917
Even as you fall asleep, I yearn for you
thinking about our moments together.

2187
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:52,208
I didn't mean...

2188
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,792
I didn't expect this from you.

2189
01:39:58,875 --> 01:39:59,792
You know well.

2190
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,750
It's just been few minutes since
Ram confessed his love to me.

2191
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:06,875
Am disturbed that someone kidnapped him.

2192
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:08,042
At such a moment...

2193
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,583
How can you behave like this?

2194
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,042
Are you a human being?

2195
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:13,583
No. Not like that.

2196
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:14,792
You think am easy because am an actress

2197
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:22,250
No matter what. I'd never fall
for your wealth or status.

2198
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:23,583
Whatever might be their profession,

2199
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:24,333
Women are same.

2200
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:26,417
Whoever we love from our heart,

2201
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:27,375
will be our best.

2202
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,750
You tried to attain a
girl using your wealth...

2203
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,250
How cheap you are...

2204
01:40:34,292 --> 01:40:34,583
listen to me...

2205
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:41,000
I don't want to see your face ever!

2206
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,208
What happened?

2207
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:48,792
I am okay!

2208
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:49,875
Who kidnapped you?

2209
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:51,500
I am the one who asked them to bring him

2210
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:53,042
It's nothing serious.

2211
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:57,417
My men told me that my daughter
and my manager were in love.

2212
01:40:57,667 --> 01:40:58,833
I said it was no issue.

2213
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:01,667
And asked to bring them both
so we could get them married.

2214
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:02,792
But my daughter and the manager,

2215
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:04,750
got scared.

2216
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:06,542
They planned to elope together!

2217
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:07,458
Thank God!

2218
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,708
When he saw them, he caught them
and handed them over to my men.

2219
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:11,917
Now, We got them married!

2220
01:41:12,083 --> 01:41:14,833
I asked them to bring him to thank him.

2221
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:16,917
Instead of bringing him, they hijacked him.

2222
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:19,542
I knew everyone would be scared here.

2223
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:21,625
So I decided to personally drop him here.

2224
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:24,500
Thanks a lot! You should be
fortunate to have him in your life

2225
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:25,250
We will take leave.

2226
01:41:27,542 --> 01:41:28,000
Let's go!

2227
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:28,792
Thanks a lot sir.

2228
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:29,250
We will take leave.

2229
01:41:31,833 --> 01:41:32,458
What happened?

2230
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,583
You know how scared I was?

2231
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:36,542
I am here now. We can resume shooting.

2232
01:41:36,667 --> 01:41:37,167
Give me a minute.

2233
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:38,167
I will talk to sir and come.

2234
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:38,458
Sir!

2235
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:39,458
Ram.. One minute.

2236
01:41:40,417 --> 01:41:41,750
Hey what? What happened?

2237
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:44,875
Come.. Don't want anything.. come.

2238
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:45,792
Why are you this tensed?

2239
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,083
I will tell you everything.. Come Ram.

2240
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,292
Will finish the shoot.

2241
01:41:49,292 --> 01:41:51,083
Don't want. Come!

2242
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:09,875
Whatever you wished for will happen.

2243
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:47,292
Brahma!!

2244
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:48,917
If I get hold of you!

2245
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:29,208
Hello Brahma! Hello!

2246
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:31,083
Come! Come out!

2247
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:32,667
I want to talk to you.

2248
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,792
I know you are inside. I know.

2249
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:39,125
Now you are coming out. We will talk.

2250
01:43:40,167 --> 01:43:41,375
What is happening here?

2251
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:43,000
What is your problem?

2252
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:47,167
Everyone in the world tells
their problem to you.

2253
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,292
That's what I did too!

2254
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:50,458
Such a bring punishment for that?

2255
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:53,958
Isn't it too much?

2256
01:43:57,042 --> 01:43:57,708
I agree!

2257
01:43:57,917 --> 01:43:59,542
You are very powerful.

2258
01:44:00,083 --> 01:44:02,708
You can do whatever you
wish for in the world.

2259
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:05,000
You are great! Ok?

2260
01:44:05,042 --> 01:44:06,542
Why do you do this to me?

2261
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:09,417
I can't handle it.

2262
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:12,625
Brahma! Please.

2263
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:14,167
Please stop this.

2264
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:18,292
You stop this stupid idiotic drama please!

2265
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,125
Is all ok?

2266
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:38,750
Is everything reset?

2267
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:43,417
There is no problem
between you and me right?

2268
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:49,625
You are great Brahma!

2269
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:52,625
I will not pray to any
God even in my dreams.

2270
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:53,708
I love you.

2271
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:04,125
Hey! You are not playing
a game with me right?

2272
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,250
I believe you.

2273
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:21,875
Just a confirmation. Don't be mad.

2274
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:54,958
What are you doing?

2275
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:56,708
You are no God!

2276
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:58,958
You are a mad psycho!

2277
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,542
Hey!

2278
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:04,667
Hey Brahma! Please.

2279
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:06,333
Please Man.

2280
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,708
I love Manisha too much.

2281
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:12,208
Without her..

2282
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:13,208
Me..

2283
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:19,417
I don't want this car, bunglow

2284
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:22,583
or this status.

2285
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:25,500
I can sleep here in this road itself. See?

2286
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:26,250
Ok?

2287
01:46:26,417 --> 01:46:27,083
Please.

2288
01:46:29,042 --> 01:46:30,583
How do I...?

2289
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,417
Mama!!

2290
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:41,042
No!

2291
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:42,000
No!

2292
01:46:42,417 --> 01:46:42,750
No!

2293
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:56,375
Swami!

2294
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:57,125
I 'm helpless.

2295
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:58,000
Save me!

2296
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,458
I am going mad.

2297
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:00,708
I want my old life back.

2298
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,250
Help me!

2299
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:03,250
Please.

2300
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:12,750
Hey!

2301
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:13,458
Wait!

2302
01:47:14,917 --> 01:47:15,958
you be a swami or a siddha!

2303
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,125
I don't care!

2304
01:47:18,667 --> 01:47:19,750
First of all you are a Human being!

2305
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:21,375
You certainly know the pain

2306
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:22,500
of a another human being.

2307
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:25,333
You must give me a solution!

2308
01:47:26,667 --> 01:47:28,167
Aham Brahmasmi!

2309
01:47:28,667 --> 01:47:30,458
You are the begining!

2310
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:32,458
You are the end

2311
01:47:52,917 --> 01:47:53,333
Hey Bramma!

2312
01:47:54,917 --> 01:47:56,583
All that you showed me right now,

2313
01:47:57,042 --> 01:47:58,292
can happen only when

2314
01:47:59,292 --> 01:48:00,000
the most important element remains.

2315
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,542
All of this can happen only if it survives!

2316
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:05,250
What if the element is gone?

2317
01:48:07,417 --> 01:48:07,792
You failed!

2318
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:09,958
You must fail!

2319
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:12,917
Can you guess what the element is?

2320
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:20,792
Me!

2321
01:48:21,917 --> 01:48:22,875
The Kameshwaran,

2322
01:48:23,333 --> 01:48:23,708
alias

2323
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:24,625
Kamu!

2324
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:26,458
What if I don't to exit?

2325
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:29,292
None of this will happen!

2326
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:34,833
I am the reason! I am the agony!

2327
01:48:40,917 --> 01:48:41,167
You...

2328
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:42,708
lost...

2329
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:44,125
You lost....

2330
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,292
Uncle! Maaplai is ready!

2331
01:49:28,792 --> 01:49:29,875
Kamu!

2332
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:47,167
Mama! I have brought the groom already.

2333
01:49:56,417 --> 01:49:58,458
Hey.. Did you thought am a fool because of my wig?

2334
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,083
If you see me without it..

2335
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:02,000
I will terrify you.

2336
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:04,958
The moment you signed my document..

2337
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:08,125
I will be your boss if you live forth..

2338
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,917
And I will be the end if you want to die.

2339
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:13,542
You can't decide to live ot die.

2340
01:50:14,917 --> 01:50:18,417
The decision will be This Vanangamudi's!

2341
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:21,583
Hey! Help the Groom sit on the dias.

2342
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:22,833
Come lets left him..

2343
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:25,542
Put this garland on him.

2344
01:50:25,583 --> 01:50:26,750
Sit down darling.

2345
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,708
Neethu!

2346
01:50:38,625 --> 01:50:40,167
Swamy.. Start it.

2347
01:50:40,292 --> 01:50:41,542
Start the music.

2348
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:42,792
Tie the thali!

2349
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:53,500
Hey!

2350
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,000
Brother..

2351
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:07,208
Who did you thought this Vanangamudi is?!

2352
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:08,917
Now he will tie the Thali!

2353
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:29,208
Uncle?

2354
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:30,167
Yes?

2355
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:31,792
I will tie the Thali..

2356
01:51:32,042 --> 01:51:33,625
But not in this dress..

2357
01:51:33,667 --> 01:51:35,000
It won't look good in the photos.

2358
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,292
Please understand Uncle

2359
01:51:36,792 --> 01:51:37,667
What is it Mama?

2360
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:39,583
Maaplai is an educated guy right?

2361
01:51:39,625 --> 01:51:40,458
That's why!

2362
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:41,583
Swamy?

2363
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:44,083
We still have time.. He can change..

2364
01:51:44,208 --> 01:51:46,875
Hey! Help Maaplai change the dress and bring him.

2365
01:51:46,917 --> 01:51:47,667
Hold him..

2366
01:51:47,708 --> 01:51:48,792
Mama come sonn!

2367
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:51,625
Hey careful.. everything relies on his fate.

2368
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:52,792
Handle him with care.

2369
01:51:52,833 --> 01:51:53,667
Pa.. Shall I?

2370
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:55,792
Son! We have our formalities..

2371
01:51:55,917 --> 01:51:59,042
First the sister.. then you.. Ok?

2372
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:00,125
Ok.

2373
01:52:01,333 --> 01:52:02,208
He is a kid!

2374
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:10,500
Here.. wear this..

2375
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:16,167
Please stay out.. I will change.

2376
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:18,625
We are all same. No problem. Change, we will go.

2377
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,083
Please.. go out.

2378
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:21,167
Leave it..

2379
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:24,083
He is shy.. Lets go.

2380
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:32,833
Hey.. We too have our own hair..

2381
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:34,167
Why that guy can't see us?

2382
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:35,958
Don't think about money and get tangled in this.

2383
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:36,625
Be quite.

2384
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:42,583
Hi!!

2385
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:43,625
Hi!

2386
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,625
Hey dude..

2387
01:52:58,417 --> 01:52:59,167
Congrats!

2388
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:01,000
Sorry man!

2389
01:53:01,292 --> 01:53:03,167
I have never said a sad congrats ever.

2390
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:06,125
Hey.. Isn't this the new Dhoti with pockets?

2391
01:53:06,167 --> 01:53:07,667
Fits good to you.

2392
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:11,208
You too...

2393
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:16,542
From Superstar to every father of the girl says..

2394
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:18,292
Life will be better if you love the

2395
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,125
compulsive marriage girl.. instead of

2396
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:22,750
the girl who you love.

2397
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,375
Ok.. Let it go.

2398
01:53:24,667 --> 01:53:26,167
One's pain is for one's self to understand only.

2399
01:53:26,417 --> 01:53:28,375
Hey.. Get married man..

2400
01:53:28,917 --> 01:53:29,708
You will get used to it.

2401
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,333
No.. Am not able to compromise myself like that.

2402
01:53:33,792 --> 01:53:36,250
I cannot imagine a life without Manisha.

2403
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:39,750
I would've been happier if I had died.

2404
01:53:40,292 --> 01:53:40,750
Hey!

2405
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:42,375
What a weird world?

2406
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,125
They saved you from dying..

2407
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:45,708
only to kill you slowly.

2408
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:47,625
God is crazy!

2409
01:53:49,417 --> 01:53:50,708
Hey look here!

2410
01:53:50,917 --> 01:53:52,542
Nothing is to change after your turmoil.

2411
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:55,417
Because.. today is not just your wedding.

2412
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:17,500
Hey Manisha!

2413
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:19,000
Hey what happened?

2414
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:19,625
What?

2415
01:54:19,667 --> 01:54:21,042
You only said your father knows

2416
01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:22,875
and it will become a problem if he comes.

2417
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,625
Isn't that why I arranged everything in urgent?

2418
01:54:24,667 --> 01:54:26,208
What if you cry here now?

2419
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:28,708
If you don't want we can cancel now.

2420
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,875
No problem.

2421
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:30,542
No No.

2422
01:54:30,583 --> 01:54:32,917
Am worried a bit about getting married..

2423
01:54:32,917 --> 01:54:34,333
without my parents.

2424
01:54:34,333 --> 01:54:36,333
But Appa got to know bout it.

2425
01:54:36,792 --> 01:54:37,583
He is an angry man.

2426
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:38,875
He might come here.

2427
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:41,125
Then.. we can never get together in life.

2428
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:42,417
Thats why..

2429
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:44,708
So?

2430
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:46,583
Come.. let's get married.

2431
01:54:47,375 --> 01:54:48,542
I can't let it go.

2432
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:51,333
Something has to be done.

2433
01:54:55,083 --> 01:54:55,958
What sound is that?

2434
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:57,792
Brother!

2435
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,583
Maaplai.. broke the back window and escaped.

2436
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:03,375
Veeramudi... Go and bring him,

2437
01:55:03,375 --> 01:55:04,042

2438
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:05,792
Hey Jaga.. Thanks man.

2439
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Thank god I have escaped from there.

2440
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:12,208
Does this Vanangamudi look funny to you all?

2441
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:16,917
Darling.. don't be scared. Mama will come soon.

2442
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:19,333
No one's eyes looks good.

2443
01:55:21,375 --> 01:55:22,333
This fool...

2444
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:23,708
Don't take this off until I come.

2445
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:24,667
Hey!!

2446
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:25,917

01:55:27,042 --> 01:55:28,125
Hey.. Come lets go.

2448
01:55:28,833 --> 01:55:30,167
Look what I've got.

2449
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:34,208
Instead of growing this son I could've done a business.

2450
01:55:36,292 --> 01:55:37,042
Mama!

2451
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:41,042
Give me original documents.

2452
01:55:41,417 --> 01:55:43,208
Madam.. I got it.

2453
01:55:44,208 --> 01:55:45,375
I got the document.

2454
01:55:46,292 --> 01:55:47,792
Don't leave them..

2455
01:55:47,958 --> 01:55:49,458
Catch them..

2456
01:56:17,417 --> 01:56:18,708
Maaplai sir.. Wait..

2457
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:19,958
Don't go..

2458
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,458
Get them.. Don't let them go..

2459
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,042

01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:29,583

01:56:30,375 --> 01:56:31,167
Name of the groom?

2462
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:33,333
Hey don't bring his to me please.

2463
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:35,250
It's because of him I got in to all this problem.

2464
01:56:35,333 --> 01:56:38,125
Hey.. did you check the facebook?

2465
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:41,000
I tried so many time.. Its only giving more problems

2466
01:56:41,375 --> 01:56:42,375
Give me the bride's name.

2467
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:44,958
Hey boys, this problem started in my hands.

2468
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:47,375
So.. It will end in my hands. I will try.

2469
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:48,458
Try anything.

2470
01:56:48,458 --> 01:56:49,542
Facebook is on right?

2471
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:50,917
I never switched it off.

2472
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:53,292
Hey.. Police.

2473
01:57:05,667 --> 01:57:07,000
Don't cuss the gods.

2474
01:57:07,042 --> 01:57:08,625
For the first time Villain is caught by

2475
01:57:08,667 --> 01:57:10,708

2480
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:18,375
Children can't drive.. Go bring your parents.

2481
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:21,208
Oh my God!

2482
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,125
Whatever..

2483
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:25,542
It's enough to escape from the family

2484
01:57:25,583 --> 01:57:27,208
What's the point in escaping?

2485
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:28,458

and try all the wrong way to achieve it.

2504
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:19,792
Think about it.

2505
01:58:20,917 --> 01:58:22,417
You said all this to me..

2506
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:24,708

2523

2524
02:00:11,667 --> 02:00:12,167

2536
02:00:45,167 --> 02:00:48,083
I don't know what my genius Maya did..

2537
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:50,417
We got another option and everything changed

2538
02:00:50,458 --> 02:00:52,583

You are right..

Generally girls cry in this scene..

2566
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,875
But he has to cry in this scene..

2567
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:08,792
Because.. he has gone through that much..

2568
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:11,125
What will happen now?

2569
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:12,583
God has changed plans..

2570
02:02:12,917 --> 02:02:14,708
His story has become yours..

2571
02:02:15,042 --> 02:02:16,917
Your story will become his now..

02:03:36,417 --> 02:03:38,042

2598
02:03:42,417 --> 02:03:42,958
Yea..

2599
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:44,375

After coming to this temple only I got to marry you..

2603
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:53,917
You don't understand right?

2604
02:03:54,667 --> 02:03:57,208
it will take two hours to say it all. Come lets go..

2605
02:04:02,542 --> 02:04:03,375
Bro?

2606
02:04:04,625 --> 02:04:05,417
Hey bro..

2607
02:04:05,833 --> 02:04:07,083
I was searching for you..

2608
02:04:07,167 --> 02:04:07,958
How are you?

2609
02:04:08,167 --> 02:04:09,500
I am very good.

2610
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:13,958
You have come Victorious I think?

2611
02:04:14,042 --> 02:04:15,458
Yes.. we just got married.

2612
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:16,375
Bless us..

2613
02:04:16,458 --> 02:04:17,208
Be good.

2614
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:19,208
Come..

2615
02:04:19,792 --> 02:04:23,208
Let us pray to Brahma for his blessings..

2616
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:10,750
God.. I understand everything now.

2617
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,083
You know everything from the begining..

2618
02:05:14,458 --> 02:05:15,625
of the creations itself..

2619
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:19,833
You know what and whom to decide and design for.

2620
02:05:20,792 --> 02:05:23,000
Every scecond on this earth

2621
02:05:23,417 --> 02:05:25,958
millions of life sprouts..

2622
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:30,708
To understand your power to create uniquely

2623
02:05:30,792 --> 02:05:34,333
There is no technology here Swamy.

2624
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:37,583
When there are so many meagre lives around

2625
02:05:37,667 --> 02:05:41,333
You have still given us this Human life.

2626
02:05:41,667 --> 02:05:44,167
This itself is a huge blessing for us.

2627
02:05:46,042 --> 02:05:48,083
Without understanding this..

2628
02:05:48,125 --> 02:05:50,458
We ask for so many things.

2629
02:05:50,583 --> 02:05:52,958
if you give us everythig that we ask for..

2630
02:05:53,125 --> 02:05:56,958
now I know.. What will happen.

2631
02:05:57,125 --> 02:05:59,458
How much ever technology might rise..

2632
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:03,042
God is always above Everything.

2633
02:06:03,208 --> 02:06:06,208
You be yourself.. We will be us.

2634
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:08,208
Am sorry for everything.

2635
02:06:08,458 --> 02:06:09,542
Thank you for everything!

2636
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:10,208
Hey!

2637
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:11,917
What are you blabbering?

2638
02:06:11,917 --> 02:06:12,875
What me?

2639
02:06:12,917 --> 02:06:14,208
That is nothing..

2640
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:16,750
Instead of mind voice..

2641
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:18,583
He always talk in open..

2642
02:06:18,667 --> 02:06:20,583
Only we know about it..

2643
02:06:20,625 --> 02:06:21,583
You don't worry.

2644
02:06:21,917 --> 02:06:23,125
Take the Arti.

2645
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:24,125
Thank you.

2646
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,458
I wish you both a Prosperous Life.

2647
02:06:34,583 --> 02:06:35,792
Buy a Pooja Platter brother.

2648
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:43,417
I have to close the door now..

2649
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,833
You can leave now.

2650
02:06:45,333 --> 02:06:47,000
Start a Happy Life.

2651
02:06:47,167 --> 02:06:48,292
Ok Bro!

2652
02:06:48,542 --> 02:06:49,125
Bye Bro!

2653
02:06:49,208 --> 02:06:50,125
Peace be with you.

2654
02:06:53,875 --> 02:06:54,792
Sawmy!

2655
02:06:54,833 --> 02:06:56,292
Please wait!

2656
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:01,417
Don't close the door!

2657
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,250
Swamy..

2658
02:07:06,458 --> 02:07:07,583
Today is my Birthday..

2659
02:07:07,958 --> 02:07:08,917
I want to do Pooja..

2660
02:07:15,917 --> 02:07:19,167
Only Brahma's door are open..

2661
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:22,375
You don't have any problem with doing Pooja there right?

2662
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:37,000
Bro.. Your work is over right?

2663
02:07:37,042 --> 02:07:38,958
You don't waste time here.. Move on.

2664
02:07:40,458 --> 02:07:41,042
Ok Bro!

2665
02:07:41,583 --> 02:07:43,333
Oh you please come inside..

2666
02:07:47,583 --> 02:07:49,833
Go to Brahma's temple.. I will be there.

2667
02:07:56,208 --> 02:07:57,167
Narayana!

2668
02:07:59,375 --> 02:08:03,292
Your life is decided and designed by Brahma!

2669
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:20,167
Do you understand now?

2670
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:22,500
People should live content
with what they have.

2671
02:08:22,625 --> 02:08:23,458
Ain't you trying to emphasis this?

2672
02:08:24,708 --> 02:08:26,000
All of you understood.

2673
02:08:26,417 --> 02:08:27,875
But people should understand!

2674
02:08:28,292 --> 02:08:30,500
If they are ready to change instantly,

2675
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,000
Why do we need Dasavatharam?

2676
02:08:36,917 --> 02:08:37,250
Iyer!

2677
02:08:37,542 --> 02:08:37,833
Yes Brother!

2678
02:08:38,167 --> 02:08:38,667
Give the 'Thali'

2679
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:38,917
Yes Brother!

2680
02:08:38,917 --> 02:08:41,208
I am known for terrorising people.

2681
02:08:41,583 --> 02:08:42,750
Were you trying to frighten me?

2682
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,042
If you try to leave once again...

2683
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:47,000
I'll chop your limbs and sacrifice
it to ' Madurai Veeran '

2684
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:48,000
Tie the Thali!

2685
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:48,667
Uncle! One minute...

2686
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:49,417
Shut up!

2687
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:50,333
He is not listening to...

2688
02:08:50,667 --> 02:08:51,250
Kamu!

2689
02:08:51,875 --> 02:08:53,875
You also bless them!

2690
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:55,208
Iyer!

2691
02:08:55,667 --> 02:08:56,417
Give the Thali!

2692
02:08:56,583 --> 02:08:56,875
Brother!

2693
02:08:57,083 --> 02:08:57,542
Music?

2694
02:08:57,833 --> 02:08:58,917
No need of any chant or music.

2695
02:08:59,167 --> 02:09:00,083
Ask them to tie the thali first!

2696
02:09:00,167 --> 02:09:00,500
Uncle!

2697
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:01,542
Please listen to me once!

2698
02:09:01,542 --> 02:09:02,750
No need of anything!

2699
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:03,833
Tie the Thali!

2700
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:10,292
What happened?

2701
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:11,542
You don't know about them.

2702
02:09:11,583 --> 02:09:13,708
When the thugs kidnapped you
yesterday, you know what he did?

2703
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:16,208
You can understand others problems
only by standing in his shoes!

2704
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,375
Poor guy! you don't know
what problem he had then!

2705
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:19,625
You come! lets go!

2706
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,542
Thank God!

2707
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,417
I finally got a solution
for my ancestral problem!

2708
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:25,125
Uncle!

2709
02:09:25,917 --> 02:09:26,917
Atleast listen to me now!

2710
02:09:26,958 --> 02:09:28,333
Fine! Tell me what's the problem?

2711
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:28,667
Uncle!

2712
02:09:28,833 --> 02:09:30,167
When he tried attempting suicide,

2713
02:09:30,333 --> 02:09:31,583
He got injured,

2714
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,750
And lost his potency!

2715
02:09:33,875 --> 02:09:34,417
What the hell are you talking about?

2716
02:09:34,875 --> 02:09:36,667
I've been trying to explain this
to you for a long time now!

2717
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:37,500
You refused to listen!

2718
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:38,750
What!?!

2719
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:39,750
When did she come?

2720
02:09:39,917 --> 02:09:40,750
Let it go Uncle!

2721
02:09:41,167 --> 02:09:45,792
The gods have cursed our lineage!

2722
02:09:46,458 --> 02:09:48,000
What can we do about it?

2723
02:09:49,458 --> 02:09:49,875
Your life

2724
02:09:50,792 --> 02:09:52,667
is decided and designed by bramma!

2725
02:09:53,083 --> 02:09:54,458
May you be blessed with all things good!

2726
02:09:54,708 --> 02:09:56,083
