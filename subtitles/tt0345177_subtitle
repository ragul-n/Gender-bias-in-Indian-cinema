1
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,919
Yes, come. Come on. Don't be scared.

2
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,225
Don't be scared.

3
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,962
I will put you to sleep now.

4
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,000
Here you go.

5
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,776
No, no, no. Don't be restless

6
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:17,410
I will put you to sleep.. In a minute

7
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,789
Know what time it is?
- Yes

8
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,487
What?
- Don't know

9
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,191
Why did you say 'yes'?

10
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,695
May be ten
- eleven

11
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,495
It's two

12
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,502
It's two in the morning

13
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,737
Yes, I know

14
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:05,853
Aren't you sleeping?
- No

15
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,155
Will you be awake the whole night?

16
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:13,088
No. I'm getting an
interesting result

17
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,354
You've been getting interesting
results for the past 10 years

18
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:21,028
I hear that every day, what's new?

19
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,304
But it all ends into nothing.
A big nothing.

20
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,366
Because, you'll soon say..

21
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,544
a new question has come up

22
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,771
For how long? There's
limit to my tolerance!

23
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,280
You know, Seema

24
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,749
As a child, I'd ask
a lot of questions

25
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,354
Like you, father would be annoyed

26
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,358
Once, I and father were
walking along the river bank

27
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,457
I was five then

28
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,231
I asked, why does a river
always flow from North to South

29
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:01,504
He said, it was because of the
height of Himalayas in the North..

30
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,305
and the depth of
the sea in the South

31
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,641
Hence, the river
flows from North to South

32
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,748
I asked him, if it
was possible to..

33
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,146
make she river flow
from South to North

34
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,447
Father said ''no''. So I said..

35
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,147
Why not build a dam?

36
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,887
To which your father replied..

37
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:19,222
due to the pressure of water.
the dam would burst

38
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,323
Then you'd ask, why
is the grass green..

39
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:22,624
and not red, yellow or blue?

40
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,996
Father would give up and
say ''Ask your teacher''

41
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,262
He'd also say that you
were a precocious child

42
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,196
So, you remember everything

43
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,375
I've heard it a thousand times

44
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,671
Come and sleep

45
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:40,909
No. I'm getting an
interesting result

46
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,309
Very interesting.

47
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,945
You've to go to the hospital,
at eight in the morning

48
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,315
I know

49
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,757
For how long, can
you bear this strain?

50
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,221
Don't know

51
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:56,954
Don't bother me. Go and sleep

52
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,493
Let me work in peace

53
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,193
I too can't sleep

54
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,401
Have you ever cared to ask?

55
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:04,833
Take sleeping pills

56
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,338
Crazy. Madman.

57
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,479
What did I see in him?

58
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,439
Rude, selfish and inconsiderate

59
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm to be blamed for marrying him

60
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:56,948
Seema, give me
money for the bus fare

61
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,123
Where are you?

62
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,924
Give me money for the bus fare

63
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:09,360
Seema, I'm getting late, hurry up

64
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,302
I made a mistake..

65
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,004
marrying a selfish man like you

66
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,478
Don't show your temper, get it.

67
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:21,475
I too haven't slept the whole night

68
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,519
I drew a blank.

69
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,222
Have to repeat the experiment

70
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,616
But where's the time?

71
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,221
The whole day is
spent at the hospital?

72
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,887
What should I do?

73
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,989
I can't do your work at the hospital

74
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,561
I know you can't..

75
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:43,267
But, at least you
can give me some money.

76
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,463
I don't have money for the fare.

77
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:51,841
I don't need all that

78
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:57,014
Just two rupees for the tram fare.

79
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,785
I haven't eaten anything.
Does it bother you?

80
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,781
I noticed that

81
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,054
Why haven't you eaten?
I don't stop you

82
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:50,627
Come back tomorrow.

83
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,867
How are you now?

84
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,607
I am fine, sir. Thanks to you.

85
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,745
Sir, a new patient

86
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,109
I see.

87
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:07,214
What's the matter?

88
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,751
I don't know, doctor

89
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,357
I don't feel alright

90
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,820
What do you mean by that?

91
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,089
I don't know

92
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:23,668
I'm not as healthy as I was

93
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,836
You come to the hospital for
simple ailments Take a deep breath

94
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,868
I feel numb in some places

95
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,315
That's because of weakness

96
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,684
No doctor,
something is wrong with me

97
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:40,513
See

98
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:51,857
Get up

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,027
Get up, let me see you walk

100
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:14,949
Foot fall
- Glove and stocking anesthesia

101
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,217
O.K. come back

102
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,587
Yes, I have taken the medicine.

103
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,493
Come.

104
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,392
Lie on the bed.

105
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:30,264
Get rid of this patient
- Send him home?

106
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,896
No. He won't find a place there.
- Why?

107
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,536
His peripheral nerve
is affected. Leprosy

108
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,475
My, God. Leprosy.

109
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,303
In spite of being a nurse,
you are scared

110
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,338
His relatives won't touch him

111
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,774
Ask the authorities, to
send him to a leprosy home

112
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,580
Leprosy is a damn menace to mankind.

113
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:51,250
Believe me

114
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,321
I hate writing this letter to you

115
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,428
But I cannot live like this anymore

116
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:03,267
When I came to you

117
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,035
I had many dreams

118
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:10,168
I thought I'd look after you..

119
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,111
care for you

120
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,505
I expected, you too
would care for me..

121
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,752
share my sorrow

122
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,414
that you'd pardon my failings

123
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,820
But nothing like that happened

124
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,425
The day my father died..

125
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:34,331
you did not come out of your lab

126
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,463
Is this how a husband and wife live?

127
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,474
I feel you don't need me

128
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,048
All you need is a servant

129
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,614
Seema, where are you?

130
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:57,888
Why are you shouting?

131
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,391
I've defeated him

132
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,255
What's up? My hands are dirty

133
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,159
I've driven out the devil!
- Whom?

134
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:06,599
The devil who was
bothering me for 7 years.

135
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,062
That bloody devil.

136
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,800
At last I am able to drive him out.

137
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,870
Whom are you talking about?

138
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,867
I thought I was the
only one who bothered you

139
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,371
Toxicity

140
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,739
What?

141
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:25,417
Toxicity. The toxic
factor in my vaccine

142
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,587
Dear me. I thought I
had done something wrong

143
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,751
Wrong?

144
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,358
All this is only because of you

145
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,594
I like to hear. You praise me..

146
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,126
But I'm not the one to
accept such compliments

147
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:44,463
Why do you say so?

148
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,938
If you hadn't bought me the freezer,

149
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,338
incubator and microscope..

150
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,967
by selling your jewellery,
could I have worked?

151
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,669
All those ornaments
were give by your mother

152
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,375
Selling those, I
paid five installments

153
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,111
Rest, you are paying

154
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
No Seema..

155
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,619
Without you, I'd
have achieved nothing

156
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:08,853
Nothing at all. Really.

157
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,830
I would've remained
a worthless doctor

158
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,553
I was waiting for you

159
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,920
You disturb me a lot, Amulya

160
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,988
Journalists are like that

161
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,994
I don't like you.

162
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,154
My fault?

163
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:44,192
Weren't you a student
of astrophysics? - Yes.

164
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,425
A good student at that

165
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,893
You left science to
become a correspondent

166
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,095
What was the need?

167
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:51,396
Doest it make any sense.

168
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,439
Everyone can't become a scientist

169
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:56,541
They are made of different stuff

170
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:57,870
I am not like them

171
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,171
I know my limitations.

172
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,474
When did you realise this?

173
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,540
After completing Ph.D

174
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:04,515
You were a Ph.D..

175
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:06,776
and I'm just a M.B.B.S

176
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,688
There's something in your genes..

177
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,620
which Ph.D's don't have

178
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,820
Useless talk

179
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,599
When I realised, I
can't be a scientist..

180
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:22,664
I love science I can't leave science

181
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,905
I thought, I could serve
the cause of science..

182
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,911
by bringing your work to
the notice of the government

183
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,909
So that the govt. is aware..

184
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,141
of the research in
fundamental science

185
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,616
A newspaper is the
best medium for this

186
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,412
I don't care, if
others know about my work

187
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:44,017
I am a selfish man. Yes, I am.

188
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,620
I am busy with myself and I
like being busy with myself.

189
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,626
Average span of
man's life is 70 years

190
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,657
Leave out twenty

191
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,231
Fifty years is nothing
in the field of science

192
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,805
There is always somebody
from within who is telling me.

193
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,936
So much to do, so little is done.

194
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,141
Hurry up. - Yeah, very true.

195
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,474
Now tell me about your work

196
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:11,982
Yes, I am on to some
interesting results

197
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:14,678
Is it? - Yes, very interesting.

198
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,322
But it's a long way to go.

199
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,676
Has any book come from
Calcutta Bacteriological Institute?

200
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,109
No.

201
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,783
To the lab right away?

202
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:53,753
Wash up.. eat some snacks,
then do what you want

203
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:56,421
Yes, I'm hungry, a lot.

204
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,493
So you too feel hungry!

205
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,676
Met Amulya today

206
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,038
Wouldn't leave me

207
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,376
Nothing has come up yet..

208
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,582
and he wants me to reveal everything

209
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,116
Publicity!

210
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,724
These fellows have
commercialised science

211
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:40,199
Paromita called from Arijit's house

212
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:41,635
Sister-in-law?

213
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,935
How are they?

214
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,513
Good, atleast you inquired

215
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:49,912
She always asks about you

216
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,280
You never care to reply

217
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:56,047
She knows, I love her a lot

218
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,952
I know, she loves me too

219
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,753
How is Anjana?

220
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,223
How's my little angel?

221
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:05,623
Why don't you call them up?

222
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,359
They'll like it

223
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,796
I've yet to drink my tea

224
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:11,763
Then, drink it

225
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,946
Seema.

226
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,517
Who entered my lab?

227
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,258
I've told you

228
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,460
No one should go there in my absence

229
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,856
Who entered the lab?

230
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:40,861
Why do you shout?

231
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,430
I dusted up the place, a bit

232
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,596
Yes, the lab will be dirty!

233
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,141
But why did you
disarrange the papers?

234
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,343
What did I do?

235
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,838
I only arranged the papers neatly

236
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,605
There was no need for that

237
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,976
There are thousands
of notes in them..

238
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,850
and all that is in my mind

239
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:04,848
Now you have made a mess of it

240
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,523
It will take a day to rearrange them

241
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,800
I hardly have time for
work.. on top of that nothing.

242
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:15,398
But wastage of time.

243
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,528
Can I ever work in peace, here?

244
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,130
Go, wherever you find peace.

245
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,501
Who stops you?

246
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,636
You are stopping me and
your idiotic, uneducated acts.

247
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:31,047
I may not be, a mad self
imposed scientist like you

248
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,514
But I'm not illiterate, get that.

249
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,953
I have a university degree

250
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,428
I can get a job anytime

251
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,163
I can leave you..

252
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:50,362
but do you know,
why I'm not doing so

253
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:55,842
Because there's no one
else to look after you

254
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,073
You don't have to look after me

255
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:02,275
Is this how you look after me?

256
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,085
There's another
reason for not leaving you

257
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,593
I have not been able to get over..

258
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,827
my love for you..

259
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,533
but I am trying

260
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,548
Are you working on Brucellosis?

261
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,751
No. Brucellosis is an old subject..

262
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,351
but research is
going on in this field

263
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:53,426
I'm trying to develop a hormone

264
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,557
Exercising in the
middle of the night

265
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,700
Following it up with a cold shower

266
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:43,626
Isn't it madness?

267
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,032
Necessity knows no law

268
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:50,470
Do you know what it means? No?

269
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:55,343
Why bother about
something one can't understand?

270
00:22:57,217 --> 00:23:00,209
Yes. You expect me to be
a mute witness, isn't it?

271
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:02,748
Another person lives in this house

272
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,718
Do you care to look after her needs?

273
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,561
Neither you sleep
nor allow others to..

274
00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:11,792
You can sleep whenever you want.
Who is stopping you?

275
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,526
You!

276
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:17,361
Two tiny rooms almost suffocating..

277
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:20,101
and the sound of the typewriter..

278
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,507
like ghosts dancing in the house!

279
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,878
You should've married
a doctor like Arijit..

280
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,276
You would've got everything

281
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:38,525
A huge house, a car, air
conditioned rooms, everything.

282
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,789
Sir.

283
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,526
For T.B. we prescribe
Isonicotnic Acid Hydrazide..

284
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:51,867
with Para-Amino Salicylic Acid..

285
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,638
won't this cause toxic side effects

286
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:57,602
Yes.. there could be
Vitamin B6 deficiency

287
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:00,209
Here we have a specific reason

288
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:02,716
But how does on approach this,

289
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,180
when it is an unknown factor?

290
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,280
We have to give supportive therapy

291
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:07,615
As quick as possible,

292
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,916
the absorbed drug
should be taken out

293
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:16,160
But, haven't you solved
the problem of toxicity?

294
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,356
No, sir

295
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:20,590
I thought I had, but
more work needs to be done

296
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,062
Then go ahead

297
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,548
Must work now.

298
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,151
It must work.

299
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,323
Must work.

300
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:25,860
What else can it be?

301
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,268
It has to work.

302
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:28,721
I am famished

303
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:31,121
Give me something to eat

304
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,964
I have kept your dinner on the table

305
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:35,594
Okay.

306
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:39,198
You haven't slept yet?

307
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,132
Its pointless to stay awake

308
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,044
.. when you don't have any work

309
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,917
I am working. I am
sewing buttons on your shirt

310
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,513
What's this? You call this dinner?

311
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:00,916
How can I eat this in
the middle of the night?

312
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:04,153
How could I cook,

313
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,391
.. when you had taken the stove?

314
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,565
Couldn't you get another, stove?

315
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:13,402
Shops aren't open at midnight

316
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:15,666
It can be bought only tomorrow

317
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,642
Call up the gas agency for a refill

318
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:22,240
You call them up

319
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:26,045
I have to do that too

320
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:27,683
I'm not on the verge of.. an interesting
breakthrough..

321
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:32,016
What's the use telling you?

322
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,802
''The endless journey.''

323
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:31,077
''So many mysteries.''

324
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:36,117
''Yet to unfold.''

325
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:43,519
''The life.''

326
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,165
''The endless journey.''

327
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:54,863
''So many mysteries.''

328
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,649
''Yet to unfold.''

329
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,758
Your aunty has invited us
to her grandson's ceremony

330
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,494
She came here and
insisted that we come

331
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:19,024
I've no time for such stupid things.

332
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,224
You go alone

333
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:27,830
Why should I go alone everywhere?

334
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,739
And why should I
accompany you everywhere?

335
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:32,906
You are the most..

336
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,544
How long can this go on?

337
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,818
It's suffocating

338
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,890
There's no joy in this house..

339
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,621
no love.. compassion..

340
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:58,271
no sense of responsibility

341
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,333
But whatever it is, its..

342
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,807
Let me make this clear

343
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,045
I have not borne a
child deliberately..

344
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,191
The mother alone can't be
responsible for the child

345
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,830
A father, too must share
this responsibility..

346
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:27,264
something which a
selfish man like you, cannot

347
00:30:54,427 --> 00:30:58,796
Every year India's
population increases by as much as..

348
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,761
the entire population of Australia

349
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:03,796
If we don't take corrective steps,

350
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:06,072
the country can't progress

351
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:09,639
The spread of education should
not be limited to the cities..

352
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:10,969
but taken to the villages

353
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,743
The news has come from Calcutta..

354
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:19,313
that, Dr. Dipankar Roy, a
physician, has discovered..

355
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:23,915
a vaccine. He's been
working on this for 12 years

356
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:26,655
Dr. Roy claims that this vaccine..

357
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,888
will eradicate leprosy
from the face of the earth

358
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:33,662
If a woman takes this
vaccine during pregnancy,..

359
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:38,895
her child will be immune to leprosy.

360
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,907
Apart from this, the vaccine..

361
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,376
has a special property

362
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:49,214
This vaccine can treat
sterility in a woman

363
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,350
Since this is a side effect,..

364
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,178
Dr. Roy is not sure about it

365
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:59,417
Dr. Roy works in a
government hospital in Calcutta

366
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,951
Isn't he, our uncle Dipu?

367
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:04,655
Must be

368
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:07,263
He too works in a
government Hospital!

369
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,636
Also, he does research It's strange!

370
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:14,068
He must be uncle Dipu.
I'll tell father

371
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,675
No. Don't disturb him in his clinic

372
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:17,903
He'll be glad,

373
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,074
since uncle Dipu is his class-mate

374
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,580
Don't get excited.
Tell me when he comes

375
00:32:22,682 --> 00:32:23,774
The invention is..

376
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:34,150
Why are you so stiff?
You had an E.C.G. before

377
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:53,711
Put on your shirt

378
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:01,712
Thank you.

379
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:03,482
Come

380
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,387
Where's the previous prescription?

381
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:09,985
I don't have
- Why?

382
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,622
Lost it, Sir

383
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:12,958
Lost it?

384
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:15,030
Is it possible to remember..

385
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,766
prescriptions of
thousands of patients?

386
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:22,370
Anyway, when was
the last E.C.G done?

387
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:25,973
A month back. You had done it

388
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,004
I was doing alright..

389
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,816
but suddenly this set back

390
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:33,819
My stars are bad, I suppose

391
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,183
You are right

392
00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:40,259
If you stars were good..

393
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,852
you wouldn't need
to consult a doctor

394
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,157
Take this

395
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:51,426
One Lasix once a day

396
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,672
Always keep Sorbitrate handy

397
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:55,569
If there's pain in the chest,

398
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:58,803
put half a tablet
under your tongue. Okay.

399
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:02,740
Thank you.

400
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:07,611
Goodbye, sir.

401
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:11,021
Anymore patients? O.K., I'm leaving.

402
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,467
Dad, grand news.

403
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:29,174
Uncle Dipu has done great work!

404
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,733
What did Dipankar do?
Has he beaten up some one?

405
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,708
No. It came on the T.V
that he's developed a vaccine.

406
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,506
What is a vaccine?

407
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:40,614
Vaccine is something which
makes us immune to diseases.

408
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:43,983
Like the one for small-pox, polio..

409
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:47,185
Uncle Dipu has
developed a new vaccine

410
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:49,052
What?

411
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:53,426
He has developed a
new vaccine for leprosy

412
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,328
Dipankar.. our Dipu!

413
00:34:55,735 --> 00:35:00,069
Do you think, we have heard wrong?

414
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,837
They clearly said, Dr. Dipankar
Roy works in a medical college

415
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,471
Call up and congratulate him, dad

416
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:11,380
I don't know what you've heard.

417
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,212
It would create an
embarrassing situation..

418
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:17,317
if the news isn't true

419
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:19,483
I won't call, unless I'm sure

420
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:23,191
Call him up. If it's him,
he'll tell you

421
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:26,322
He loves me a lot

422
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:29,766
Like a magician, he
brings out a chocolate for me

423
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:32,435
He loves your father a lot

424
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,672
Whenever he meets, he
greets with an abuse

425
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:46,410
What's the matter?

426
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,950
What exactly did you hear?

427
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:54,385
Tell me, without exaggeration

428
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:56,827
You don't have to believe me

429
00:35:57,397 --> 00:36:00,389
It will be in the
newspapers tomorrow

430
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,025
Four thousand rupees

431
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,362
They'll publish his photo
in the newspaper. Isn't it?

432
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:09,433
Of course, dear,
they can publish it.

433
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,598
Vaccine for Leprosy.

434
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:39,868
Dr. Dipankar Roy attached
to a government hospital..

435
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:43,542
..has invented a
vaccine for leprosy.

436
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,810
Sir, I often bother
you with my problems

437
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:52,207
I ask you too many questions.

438
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,614
He who seeks to know..

439
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:59,347
will always ask questions

440
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:06,495
Sir, I am upset,
till I find an answer

441
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:10,162
I am not at peace, till I solve it

442
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,360
It must be that way

443
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:16,271
I won't do to evade a problem

444
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,273
One must solve it

445
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,445
I know, I know.

446
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,978
Not being able to solve a problem..

447
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:34,753
means resignation,
retirement, full stop

448
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:38,358
There's nothing like a
full-stop in science

449
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,427
Yes, sir.

450
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:46,096
Dipankar.

451
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:49,534
Dipankar.

452
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:51,376
Go on experimenting
without bothering..

453
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,575
about the results..

454
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:56,908
Go on experimenting.
one after the other

455
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,582
One day these experiments..

456
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:06,455
will reveal a story,
that is important

457
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:12,289
It took 10 long years
to invent this vaccine.

458
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:15,731
He claims that during pregnancy..

459
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:18,362
..if the mother is inoculated
with this vaccine..

460
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:21,934
..her child will be
immune to leprosy.

461
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,677
Dr. Roy claims that soon..

462
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:29,478
..leprosy will be eradicated
from the face of this earth.

463
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,583
Claims that soon leprosy will be
eradicated from the face of this earth.

464
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:44,789
Do you believe now?

465
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:47,758
A log has been written in the papers

466
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:50,625
He never told me that
he was doing research..

467
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,328
on leprosy

468
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:54,761
Dipu is different from all of you

469
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,826
He's made of different stuff

470
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:01,362
I can't express it
but he is different

471
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:02,966
Don't know that, but..

472
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,474
he's always been crazy

473
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:08,912
I told him to set up
private practice..

474
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,949
.. instead of government service

475
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,879
He'd say that, he
didn't have the patience..

476
00:40:13,553 --> 00:40:15,350
to feel the pulse of a
patient by shutting..

477
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,321
his eyes for half an hour

478
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:21,450
He was an ordinary student

479
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,226
He'd scrape through,
where as I'd top the class

480
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:29,027
He never concentrated on his studies

481
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:32,869
He didn't think much
of the college syllabus

482
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,104
The world outside the
syllabus was unknown..

483
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:38,806
and what's unknown was interesting,
he'd say

484
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,645
Where are you going? Food is
getting cold - Just a minute.

485
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:59,991
Hello. - I have done it.
I have done it.

486
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,502
Yes, today's edition
seems to be only for you

487
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:06,398
Ten years!

488
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,765
It took me 10 long years.

489
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,337
Never realised the
passing of 10 years!

490
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,809
I've enjoyed every
moment of these 10 years

491
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,006
I've lived every bit,
every moment of it.

492
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,617
Come, some day, to tell
me about your research

493
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,213
We live to learn.

494
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:25,546
forget it

495
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:28,856
Will you have the time for this?
You are busy with you patients

496
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,024
Like the saying goes, soil is gold.

497
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,894
Every patient only
means more money, isn't it?

498
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:37,261
You're right I've become..

499
00:41:38,004 --> 00:41:40,336
a machine minting money

500
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:42,368
A money making machine.

501
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:46,101
At least, you've achieved something

502
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:48,139
What do you mean?

503
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:51,242
What makes you think,
this is ordinary?

504
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:55,883
It's such a cursed disease..

505
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:58,284
that no one goes near the patient

506
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,421
If in a family
someone is afflicted..

507
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:04,456
He has to leave the house

508
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,530
What a cursed disease?

509
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:10,829
Even doctors.. like you don't dare..

510
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,599
..treating a leprosy
patient is a far-fetched thing.

511
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:20,544
I'll eradicate this disease
from the face of the earth

512
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:23,914
It will be eradicated forever.

513
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:27,812
Everybody must be congratulating you

514
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,652
No Sir, only Orijit called up

515
00:42:30,857 --> 00:42:33,985
He works in a govt.
hospital Who'll congratulate him

516
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,991
If you had developed
a tablet as a cure..

517
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,492
All the businessmen and
patients would've come here

518
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,793
At school one learnt,
prevention is better than cure

519
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:42,266
That changed everything perhaps

520
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:45,433
Here are my children!

521
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,771
They look fine, but don't
know how long they'll survive

522
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,668
Look at the lab.
Will any one believe..

523
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:54,110
that a vaccine for
leprosy was developed here?

524
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:56,606
One doesn't need an
air-conditioned lab..

525
00:42:56,716 --> 00:42:58,980
and expensive
instruments to do research.

526
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:00,578
One needs gray matter..

527
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,280
which your husband
possesses in abundance

528
00:43:05,524 --> 00:43:07,651
You sit down and chat,
I'll get tea for you.

529
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:12,354
Now, tell me about your research

530
00:43:12,565 --> 00:43:14,294
Though it's not my subject..

531
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:15,693
it's allied to my field

532
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,428
Let me understand.

533
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:23,174
In the thirties, in Germany..

534
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:26,336
60 years from now, Dr.
Altman worked on leprosy..

535
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,338
And published a paper

536
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:32,582
My work is based on his paper

537
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,785
But you never told me about it

538
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,325
Because I was not sure

539
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:42,353
What happened then?

540
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:46,629
Dr. Altman
couldn't complete his work

541
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:51,532
He developed a vaccine X-on

542
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:56,165
X being an undetermined factor,
hence the name

543
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,402
Even after injecting
brown mice with..

544
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,504
lepra bacillus,
they weren't afflicted

545
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:04,947
But he made an
interesting observation

546
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:08,583
Some mice born to an
X-on injected female..

547
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,588
were afflicted with leprosy

548
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,816
Fascinating.

549
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:16,921
We know, leprosy is
not a hereditary disease

550
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,319
Of course.

551
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:21,258
That means X-on had done this

552
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:26,771
Unfortunately, Altman
couldn't complete his work

553
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:30,435
He was sent to a
Nazi concentration camp

554
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:33,873
Just because he was a Jew..

555
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:38,275
If Einstein hadn't left Germany, ..

556
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:40,512
he too would have met a similar fate

557
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:43,015
Please continue

558
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:47,881
To Dr. Altman's X-on,
I added a hormone..

559
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:50,786
and succeeded in growing
bacilli in brown mouse

560
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,391
This is it

561
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,699
But I faced many
problems after that.

562
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:58,900
But, the toxicity factor cropped up

563
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:01,030
To solve that, I often came to you

564
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:03,132
It took me many years to solve it

565
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:10,778
Anyway, once I grew
the bacilli, I got a host

566
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:13,514
After that it wasn't difficult

567
00:45:14,153 --> 00:45:15,211
It was all easy.

568
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:17,182
On which animal did you experiment?

569
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:20,918
As far as I know, Rhesus monkey..

570
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:22,654
doesn't respond to leprosy

571
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,627
You're right

572
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,358
Armadillo is the ideal animal

573
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,491
But that is only found in America

574
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:33,403
Of course, we have Pangolim here

575
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:35,963
How could I get it?

576
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:38,870
So, I experimented on brown mice

577
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:45,917
As I worked, I
observed something interesting

578
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:47,713
Sterility

579
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:55,188
To see the affect of
this on a sterile woman,..

580
00:45:55,828 --> 00:45:57,420
I injected this vaccine in this..

581
00:45:57,496 --> 00:46:00,056
sterile female monkey

582
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,064
After injecting, she became pregnant

583
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:05,763
I don't know.

584
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:09,672
May be this was due to the hormone

585
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,137
Which hormone?

586
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,042
It belongs to the Gonadotropin group

587
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,114
The field is open

588
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:17,940
If some one works on it,..

589
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,245
Gynecologists will be benefited

590
00:46:20,953 --> 00:46:23,421
But this is only a side effect

591
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:26,514
It would've been better,
if you hand..

592
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:28,617
written about it in the papers

593
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,154
Why?

594
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:34,798
Dipankar's subject is
leprosy and not sterility

595
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:36,494
It might harm. Forget it

596
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:38,866
You are still discussing.
Should I bring the tea here?

597
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,134
No, I already had You both go ahead

598
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:50,476
Can I look at your notes?

599
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:52,009
Of course, sir.

600
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,323
The list of
observations - Thank you.

601
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,358
Go and have tea with them

602
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:08,463
The problem with Seema is that..

603
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:10,959
she disturbs while one is working

604
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:14,472
You are certain, I
was born to disturb you

605
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,038
A letter from the government

606
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,807
Must be a congratulatory note

607
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,048
Leprosy is a major
problem in our country

608
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:31,215
What's the matter?

609
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,921
A letter from the health secretary

610
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,157
Wants me to meet him at ten

611
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,753
I hate to meet government officials

612
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,161
Look at this, Sir

613
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,771
He wants me to meet him
in his office at ten today

614
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:52,877
You will have to, you
are a government servant

615
00:47:52,945 --> 00:47:55,880
But he's written ''to
explain certain matters''

616
00:47:56,882 --> 00:47:57,974
What has he written

617
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,313
''To explain certain matters''.
What does it mean?

618
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:02,644
It means, you must..

619
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:06,384
urgently prepare the papers..

620
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,293
I haven't the time
to prepare the papers

621
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,822
Ten years have been
spent on the experiments

622
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:19,398
Now, prepare your papers promptly

623
00:48:19,872 --> 00:48:22,670
Lot of things happen in this country

624
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:25,670
Go, get ready

625
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:28,907
Meanwhile, I'll
write down your notes

626
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,844
I'll need three to four hours

627
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:46,756
Come Ramanand. How are you?

628
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,697
Have you read today's newspaper..

629
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:52,965
about Dipankar Roy a leprosy doctor?

630
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,397
Just a minute

631
00:48:56,308 --> 00:49:00,074
Don't send any patient,
till I tell you

632
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,878
Yes, I read.
- Do you believe?

633
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:04,546
Do you believe it? Absolute bluff.

634
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,878
Do you think it's a bluff?

635
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:10,046
Sheer bluff.

636
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:11,722
Don't you know Dipankar?

637
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:14,791
He is a mad man,
couldn't achieve anything

638
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:16,190
Now making sensational news

639
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,990
In medical science, no one can bluff

640
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:23,163
If he's bluffing, he'll be found out

641
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:26,402
And that'll be quite
embarrassing for him

642
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,539
He'll be caught, but he is shameless

643
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:32,741
We've studied together

644
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:34,473
I know him well

645
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,139
He is very different

646
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:38,939
You may not like what I am saying..

647
00:49:39,151 --> 00:49:41,676
..because he was your class mate

648
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,712
I can spare no sentiments for him

649
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:49,060
If he was really brilliant
why is he, only an M.B.B.S?

650
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:52,226
Why couldn't he get a
higher degree like you and me?

651
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,496
Do you know he sings?

652
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:59,028
Yes, and that too with an harmonium!

653
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:00,571
But what's wrong with it?

654
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,371
Einstein used to play the violin

655
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,638
Satyen Bose played the ESRAJ

656
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,504
Dr. Homi Bhabha was a painter

657
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,510
What are you saying?

658
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:15,352
Comparing him with Einstein,
Satyen Bose, Dr. Bhabha?

659
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:18,154
Can there be any comparison,
damn it.

660
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:20,891
You are underestimating him

661
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,623
He was always out of the ordinary

662
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,894
He has tremendous determination

663
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,060
I don't believe a word of his

664
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:31,299
Even, it is
theoretically impossible.

665
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,265
Okay, okay.

666
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:36,797
Let him say what he
likes regarding leprosy..

667
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:38,471
I don't mind

668
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:43,009
But what right has he to enter
the domain of gynecologists?

669
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,983
He claims that his
vaccine will treat sterility

670
00:50:47,052 --> 00:50:49,179
That, barren woman can conceive

671
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,748
I've read that

672
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,851
But he's not definite about it

673
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:55,318
He clearly said,
it was a side effect

674
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:58,789
If he is not definite then,
why did he talk to the press?

675
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:02,224
I am fed up,
explaining to my patients

676
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,633
Un-cultured and devoid of ethics!

677
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:07,001
Can we remain silent?

678
00:51:07,206 --> 00:51:10,437
But his real work is
his vaccine for leprosy

679
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:13,311
It isn't that simple

680
00:51:13,712 --> 00:51:15,976
If it were possible to
develop a vaccine for leprosy..

681
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:18,675
..then it would've been
done in England or America!

682
00:51:18,984 --> 00:51:20,144
Leprosy.

683
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:22,513
We've found
treatment only for Kalazar..

684
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:24,579
..we owe it to K.N Brahmachary

685
00:51:26,558 --> 00:51:31,086
I need your help. We must stop him

686
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,456
I won't waste your time, I'll leave

687
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:50,143
Send the patient in

688
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:56,346
Come, Dr. Roy
- What's the matter?

689
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:59,616
Your letter ''To
explain certain matters''

690
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,522
What do you mean?

691
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,350
Have I stolen medicines?

692
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,124
Have I been
negligent to any patient?

693
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:07,624
Or have I exposed
government documents

694
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:08,791
What is it?

695
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:11,631
Please sit. Don't get excited

696
00:52:11,703 --> 00:52:13,000
Please sit.

697
00:52:13,605 --> 00:52:15,732
Tell be briefly. I
don't have much time

698
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,506
Look, I was a student of literature

699
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:22,509
I'm not competent to
comment on your vaccine

700
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:24,806
I know my limitations

701
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,146
But here I am a officer.

702
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,851
Government has given me the
responsibility of administration.

703
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:31,650
My job is to co-ordinate

704
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,916
You are a doctor in a
government hospital..

705
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,020
hence an officer like me

706
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:37,891
There's a code of conduct..

707
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:43,596
You can't talk to the press
Without Government's permission

708
00:52:44,903 --> 00:52:48,304
Meaning, all my
labour will be in vain?..

709
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,931
..Just because, I
spoke to the press..

710
00:52:50,142 --> 00:52:52,576
Oh no.. you've done good work

711
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:55,645
Government should be proud of you

712
00:52:57,649 --> 00:53:00,550
You meet the Director of Health

713
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:04,118
Explain to him. He
has a lot of experience

714
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:06,347
He has many foreign degrees.

715
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:07,949
He'll understand your work

716
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:12,963
You people, preferred
technocrats to bureaucrats

717
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,896
Take him to Dr. Roy, the
Director of Health. - Okay

718
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,745
With whose permission did you..

719
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,720
..do personal research
in a government lab?

720
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:43,623
With whose permission did you..

721
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:45,492
..do personal research
in a government lab?

722
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,588
I did not use the government lab

723
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:51,093
I've built a small lab in my house

724
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:55,398
I've got help from some
friends who have their private labs

725
00:53:57,543 --> 00:54:00,671
You should have come to me.
I'd have guided you

726
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,382
Yes, the German scientist.. What's his name..

727
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:06,744
Altman?

728
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,887
Isn't your work based on his paper?

729
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,682
Dr. Altman was an
Austrian Jew, not a German.

730
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,791
What's the difference?

731
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,256
Germany and Austria are
like East and West Bengal

732
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:24,227
Do you know, no one
believes your claim

733
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,672
In science, there's
nothing like belief

734
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:32,977
Proof is needed. Proof!

735
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:39,111
Let me complete my papers,
you'll be convinced. I am sure.

736
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:41,516
How long will you take to do that?

737
00:54:42,754 --> 00:54:45,314
About three months. - Three months.

738
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:49,022
Two renowned
gynecologists say that..

739
00:54:49,094 --> 00:54:52,359
your claim is a hoax

740
00:54:52,698 --> 00:54:54,131
A mad man's talk

741
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:55,529
Tea for me

742
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:58,897
How does my research
concern the gynecologists?

743
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:00,697
What do you mean?

744
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:03,231
Didn't you say, the vaccine..

745
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:05,299
should be given to women?

746
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:09,072
Woman aren't the personal
property of gynecologists

747
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:11,138
But we've to face the consequences

748
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:12,978
If there are adverse reactions, ..

749
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:14,518
who'll be responsible? You?

750
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:20,916
Experimenting on
humans will be much late

751
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,622
A lot of work needs to be done

752
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:27,755
Why is a woman given
vaccine for pox and cholera?

753
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:30,901
That too is a poison

754
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:33,067
Don't talk nonsense

755
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:35,562
Are you in your senses?

756
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:39,674
Leprosy is a cursed disease

757
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,013
The society dreads it..

758
00:55:43,682 --> 00:55:45,513
The society dreads it..

759
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:47,347
because there is no cure for it

760
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:50,414
If it were like influenza..

761
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:51,987
..which gets cured quickly..

762
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,823
no one would have bothered

763
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,484
Take the example of Tuberculosis

764
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:58,595
If a person was
afflicted with T.B..

765
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:01,558
no one dared to enter his room

766
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:04,329
Does anyone bother about T.B. now?

767
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,231
You better don't try
to teach me science.

768
00:56:07,472 --> 00:56:08,871
But, you are being unscientific

769
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:11,937
Unscientific? - Yes, you
are talking like a layman.

770
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:13,739
Who made you the director?

771
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:18,510
I say, my vaccine will eradicate
leprosy from the face of the earth

772
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,918
I mean like..

773
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,818
..plague, polio, tetanus..

774
00:56:29,461 --> 00:56:30,587
..pox.

775
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:33,823
Yes.

776
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,746
What's the matter doctor?
You look worried

777
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:54,212
No.. nothing

778
00:56:56,855 --> 00:57:00,416
They insulted me.. and my work

779
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:05,558
In our country every person,
big or small..

780
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,222
is insulted often..

781
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:11,227
Your work shouldn't be
affected on account of ignorant fools

782
00:57:11,937 --> 00:57:13,165
I am fed up

783
00:57:15,107 --> 00:57:16,665
When I started my research..

784
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:19,870
I was determined to
devote myself to research

785
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:22,777
I didn't care for anybody

786
00:57:25,117 --> 00:57:26,516
Not even Seema

787
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:32,686
When persons who don't
know the basics of science..

788
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:35,625
interfere in my work.. I lose my head

789
00:57:36,762 --> 00:57:38,753
Two gynecologists are hounding me

790
00:57:40,365 --> 00:57:41,457
Gynecologists.

791
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,168
Dr. Ramanand Chatterjee
and Dr. Prashant Mullick

792
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,501
There's a big group behind them

793
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:49,164
But why?

794
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:52,167
He hasn't harmed any one

795
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,206
He was immersed in his work

796
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:56,069
It's what he has said..

797
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:58,976
the vaccine's side
effect on female sterility

798
00:57:59,084 --> 00:58:00,574
Don't talk nonsense

799
00:58:01,787 --> 00:58:05,086
That was just an observation.
A possibility

800
00:58:07,759 --> 00:58:09,351
It was my mistake

801
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:12,124
It was my mistake

802
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,935
I thought the news will
reach America and London..

803
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,065
and then come here

804
00:58:21,306 --> 00:58:23,331
So, I thought, I'd give
our people the news first

805
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:29,038
How could I know,
they'd be the first to stab

806
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,316
Why can they stab? Me, at the most

807
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,980
They can't kill science

808
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:40,855
If one scientist dies.. another will replace him

809
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:44,827
Research will go on

810
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:47,325
The sad part is that
history doesn't record..

811
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,661
..the names of these rogues.

812
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,632
they will go on damaging for
generations and go Scot free

813
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,334
I think we should unmask them.

814
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,305
Everyone isn't like that

815
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:01,402
There are many, who encourage

816
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:04,081
In Calcutta there are
many renowned doctors..

817
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,641
but they are great
human beings first

818
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,596
Is something wrong?

819
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:28,833
What's worrying you?

820
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:31,835
Nothing

821
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,247
You've been like that..

822
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:38,475
..since you heard
the news about Dipankar

823
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:41,552
You know, I don't talk much

824
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:46,587
Nor can I be
over-enthusiastic about something

825
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:51,222
I feel there's something else..

826
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:54,423
What?

827
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,766
Hello.

828
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:06,844
Shyamali, what is it?

829
01:00:08,613 --> 01:00:09,739
What..

830
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:11,809
..really?

831
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:14,711
I'll talk to you later

832
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:22,281
B.B.C has flashed the
news about Deepankar

833
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:25,190
The B.B.C?
- Yes.

834
01:00:25,864 --> 01:00:28,094
Did you hear it right?
- Shyamali just told me

835
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:31,867
So your Deepankar has
become an international figure

836
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:33,529
What is it, Ma?

837
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,505
B.B.C. has flashed the
news about Deepankar

838
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:38,064
Great! Shall I call him up?

839
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:40,569
Yes I will talk to him too

840
01:00:58,296 --> 01:00:59,593
Hello.

841
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:02,296
Aunty, did you know?

842
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,594
Anjana.. what is it?

843
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:09,570
B.B.C. has flashed the
news about uncle Dipu

844
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,341
B.B.C.

845
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:19,273
Aunty.

846
01:01:21,353 --> 01:01:23,412
Aunty are you listening?

847
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:26,913
Yes, I am listening.

848
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:35,232
Where's uncle Dipu?

849
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,730
Wait, I'll call him

850
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:47,204
Do you hear? Come quickly.

851
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:51,213
What is it? - Anjana says B.B.C
has broadcast the news about you

852
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:53,745
Hurry up.

853
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:07,330
Is my little princess
dreaming up something?

854
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:11,224
It is true Where is my chocolate?

855
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:14,001
Science hasn't
progressed that far..

856
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:15,869
that I can send
chocolates over the phone

857
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:17,473
At least, I can't do that

858
01:02:17,842 --> 01:02:19,332
It's a physicist's job

859
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:21,736
I'll give you a box of chocolates

860
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,605
Fine. Everyday I'll eat one

861
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,911
Talk to mother

862
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,610
Okay. Sister-in-law.

863
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:34,018
Can't you come over even once?

864
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,827
Why don't you come over?

865
01:02:39,497 --> 01:02:42,125
After hearing the B.B.C
news I want to come right away

866
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,231
Come But I think it over

867
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,633
Three months back
my aunt had come..

868
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:48,797
she was angry

869
01:02:49,074 --> 01:02:50,905
She said, if she knew,
I was working..

870
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,465
on such a dreadful disease..

871
01:02:52,544 --> 01:02:54,307
she'd never have brought the kids

872
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,981
What is Arijit up to?

873
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,011
He says, you've become
an international figure

874
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:07,552
So I've become international?

875
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,753
Arijit is a great physician

876
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,456
But I must tell you
he has no gray matter

877
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,832
Shall I tell him? -Oh no

878
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:20,165
I don't want to be
beaten at this age

879
01:03:20,238 --> 01:03:23,469
He often bet me on
account of my studies

880
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,779
I feel very happy about this

881
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,408
Everyone asks about you

882
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,214
I tell them. You
are my crazy brother

883
01:03:38,656 --> 01:03:41,147
Come over, soon

884
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:43,754
I will

885
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,039
Call for you, Sir

886
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,284
Hello.
- Dr. Ramanand speaking?

887
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,517
Director of Health, Dr. Khastagir

888
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:19,593
Hello, sir. Stop that mad man
- Who?

889
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:23,664
Dipankar Roy He is messing up a lot

890
01:04:24,302 --> 01:04:28,636
He came to my office and
made exaggerated claims

891
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:33,276
As if we know nothing
about medical science

892
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:35,342
He is your subordinate officer

893
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,880
Yes He is a government servant

894
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:41,612
We'll take steps for insubordination

895
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,552
But we need your help

896
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:49,688
I hear, that, some
leading doctors are backing him

897
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:54,425
You know, we doctors are not united

898
01:04:55,066 --> 01:04:57,432
You know, we doctors are
jealousy will be there

899
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:01,029
But I agree with you.

900
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,504
Okay, we'll talk later

901
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:05,934
Okay.

902
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:15,212
B.B.C. has broadcast the
news of Dr. Dipankar Roy

903
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:19,422
Till the foreigners
recognize the work

904
01:05:19,924 --> 01:05:21,949
We don't believe in it

905
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:25,521
In spite of being a
renowned gynecologist..

906
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:27,628
you believe such nonsense!

907
01:05:28,499 --> 01:05:30,558
Yes, I do

908
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:33,094
You may laugh

909
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:37,867
I don't know Dr. Dipankar Roy,
never met him either

910
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:40,570
But I heard, he's been
experimenting for many years

911
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:44,944
You believe him!

912
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:47,950
I say, it's a stunt

913
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:50,915
A stunt to get a promotion

914
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:52,848
The vaccine is for a
certain disease..

915
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:55,221
how can it treat
sterility in a woman?

916
01:05:55,793 --> 01:06:00,196
There is a relation
between chicken pox and women

917
01:06:00,598 --> 01:06:01,724
What?

918
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:03,795
Some women become
blind when afflicted..

919
01:06:03,868 --> 01:06:06,928
with chicken pox, after puberty

920
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:08,467
Women deliver deformed babies..

921
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:12,100
..if during pregnancy, they
are afflicted by German measles

922
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,438
That is something else

923
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:17,306
They anatomy of a woman
is very complicated..

924
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:19,850
I am a gynecologist

925
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,881
You don't have to
teach me gynecology

926
01:06:24,122 --> 01:06:25,180
Fraud.

927
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:28,782
Dr. Dipankar Roy is fraud

928
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:36,095
I request you not to make
baseless charges against anyone..

929
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,259
..without an in depth
study of the subject

930
01:06:41,439 --> 01:06:43,964
I have gone through your notes

931
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:48,535
The effect of
Gonadotropin on X-on is interesting

932
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,943
Not just interesting.

933
01:06:51,015 --> 01:06:53,779
It's an original work

934
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,410
I've sent a copy of your notes to..

935
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:58,648
John Anderson Foundation

936
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:03,888
When?
- In the morning, today

937
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:06,794
Certain people are
out to harass you..

938
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,729
hence I decided to
send it right away

939
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:10,195
You did the right thing, Sir

940
01:07:10,802 --> 01:07:14,363
I was thinking of doing the
same But, who'd listen to me?

941
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:17,807
A prince by virtue of his birth..

942
01:07:18,676 --> 01:07:20,974
doesn't become a king

943
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,646
Credibility is necessary.

944
01:07:26,384 --> 01:07:32,380
Have you thought of
experimenting on humans

945
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:35,318
Before experimenting on humans..

946
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,720
I'll have to remove the toxic factor

947
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,958
I have to seek permission

948
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,393
Whose permission?
- The government's

949
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:50,298
My body does not
belong to the government

950
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:58,481
If you need my body, just tell me

951
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,082
This is a vaccine for leprosy

952
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:09,791
I know, it's not for influenza

953
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:11,220
It's for leprosy

954
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:16,157
But my body has
become old and worn out

955
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:19,135
If this old man's body..

956
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:21,436
..is useful in the
cause of science..

957
01:08:21,506 --> 01:08:22,871
I shall be happy

958
01:08:23,508 --> 01:08:25,271
Perhaps you don't know

959
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,939
Prof. J.B.S. Haldane
volunteered his body..

960
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:37,216
to Dr. Sanyal for
cancer related experiments

961
01:08:41,526 --> 01:08:43,187
I'll remember your word, Sir

962
01:08:44,762 --> 01:08:46,627
Till the last day

963
01:08:48,566 --> 01:08:50,227
Because of you, I'm fortunate..

964
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,769
to meet a great soul like Dr. Kundu

965
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,632
Didn't you know him before?

966
01:08:55,907 --> 01:08:59,104
I knew that, Dr. Kundu is
a renowned microbiologist

967
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,405
He's known internationally as well.

968
01:09:01,612 --> 01:09:04,672
But, I didn't know, he
was such a great soul

969
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:08,344
Hello, Dr. Roy. Is that story true?

970
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,454
What?
- The one about the vaccine

971
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:13,587
Not many are believing it

972
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,150
It's a matter of faith
between a doctor and a patient..

973
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,529
as it is between the
doctor and industry

974
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:22,861
But medicine itself is science..

975
01:09:23,334 --> 01:09:25,632
irrespective of belief or not

976
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,401
Come, Aman.

977
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,814
Can't you disconnect the door bell?

978
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,749
Hello. - Hello.

979
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:52,956
All of us are doctors..

980
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,089
..We want to meet Dr. Roy

981
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,458
But he can't be disturbed now

982
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,231
We won't use much of his time

983
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:04,038
Please sit. I'll call him

984
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,875
Some junior doctors have come

985
01:10:12,783 --> 01:10:16,583
All because of Amulya Publicity!

986
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,519
What was the need?

987
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,230
Greetings
- Please sit.

988
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:31,232
What is it? - We wish to
arrange a lecture by you

989
01:10:31,903 --> 01:10:33,530
I don't lecture

990
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,271
We'd like to know about your vaccine

991
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:38,865
We know nothing about it

992
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:40,407
We could benefit from your lecture

993
01:10:41,546 --> 01:10:44,640
So, you want to
know about my vaccine

994
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,646
Sit down. - Thank you, sir.

995
01:10:52,356 --> 01:10:56,725
Have I met you before?
- Yes, at Dr. Kundu's lab

996
01:10:57,328 --> 01:11:02,061
You said, people didn't
believe in the vaccine

997
01:11:02,366 --> 01:11:05,062
Sorry, sir. - No, no,
you don't have to be sorry.

998
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:07,637
I should be sorry, I was
rather rude to you the other day.

999
01:11:07,905 --> 01:11:11,068
Alright, let me know
the time and place..

1000
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:12,841
I'll be there? - Okay, sir.

1001
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,105
Thank you, sir. - Okay.

1002
01:11:21,385 --> 01:11:23,012
You look very happy

1003
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:24,914
You look very happy
- Will you have tea?

1004
01:11:25,423 --> 01:11:26,617
Let's have

1005
01:11:29,226 --> 01:11:32,423
Can I help you type your notes?

1006
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,463
This is unlike the
typing in an office..

1007
01:11:35,533 --> 01:11:36,795
where a bureaucrat dictates..

1008
01:11:36,867 --> 01:11:38,835
and the steno types rapidly

1009
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,903
Why waste time in such matters?
Go.. make tea

1010
01:11:41,973 --> 01:11:44,134
What are you fighting over?

1011
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,573
Now my work is surely finished!

1012
01:11:46,811 --> 01:11:49,336
Read today's paper
- I don't read newspapers

1013
01:11:49,413 --> 01:11:52,109
I too haven't
- Read it

1014
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:57,951
Criticism of Dr. Roy's vaccine

1015
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,758
Let me read it to you

1016
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,759
Dr. Ramanand and Dr.
Sushant Mullick..

1017
01:12:07,832 --> 01:12:11,393
have criticised the
vaccine developed by Dr. Roy..

1018
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:15,730
According to them, without
experimenting on humans..

1019
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,869
it's ridiculous to
claim it's success

1020
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,942
Dr. Ramanand says.. - To hell with Ramanand!

1021
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,712
Idiot of a man.

1022
01:12:30,821 --> 01:12:33,255
I won't go to any seminar

1023
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,058
Why should this affect the lecture?

1024
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:40,293
Lecture?

1025
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:44,866
Some junior doctors invited
him to speak about his vaccine

1026
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:47,400
That's good

1027
01:12:48,139 --> 01:12:49,800
People will know about his vaccine

1028
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:54,803
You've promised. You must go

1029
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,812
Or they'll think otherwise

1030
01:12:57,148 --> 01:12:59,548
Let them.. idiots!

1031
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,282
Now, let me work

1032
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:07,124
What's the fault of
the young doctors?

1033
01:13:07,725 --> 01:13:11,058
They were really
interested in your work

1034
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:17,090
Why is Dr. Ramanand
concerned about my vaccine?

1035
01:13:17,968 --> 01:13:19,697
How does it concern any doctor?

1036
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,771
The acceptance of the
vaccine will be decided..

1037
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:32,080
by the microbiologists, molecular
biologists cellular biologists

1038
01:13:33,818 --> 01:13:36,753
It will be tried on humans

1039
01:13:37,188 --> 01:13:39,588
Results and
reactions will be studied..

1040
01:13:40,057 --> 01:13:41,456
a long way to go..

1041
01:13:42,426 --> 01:13:43,825
yet they are abusing me, now

1042
01:13:44,195 --> 01:13:47,926
Our great country.. Not just ours,
all around the world..

1043
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,065
All those who strived
to achieve something..

1044
01:13:53,504 --> 01:13:54,801
have had to contend with abuse

1045
01:13:54,905 --> 01:13:57,305
I developed this vaccine long ago

1046
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,743
But it took long, to
remove it's toxicity

1047
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:14,784
I'll go away.. with
Seema I'll go to Africa..

1048
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:20,857
Leprosy is a major problem there

1049
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:25,233
I won't go with you

1050
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:28,704
If everyone leaves like that..

1051
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,634
won't good work ever
be done in this country?

1052
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:35,406
I don't belong to a
country I care for Man..

1053
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:41,849
Creature of this universe.

1054
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:48,423
A disease, of this
dreadful disease..

1055
01:14:50,227 --> 01:14:53,856
Whether developed
by me or someone..

1056
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:55,730
is to serve Man

1057
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:59,864
If we can do it.. against all odds

1058
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,934
It will instill
confidence in future scientists

1059
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,834
You must go for the lecture

1060
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:08,907
Let's go, please.

1061
01:15:09,246 --> 01:15:11,544
Let's see the response

1062
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:17,084
I don't think you need
a long introduction..

1063
01:15:18,155 --> 01:15:20,988
since all of you are doctors

1064
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,050
Or would-be scientists.

1065
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:26,860
The first step in my research was..

1066
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:31,900
to infect an animal with leprosy

1067
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:36,967
Because if once we have an
infected host it' possible to know..

1068
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:39,308
whether we can rid
the host of the disease

1069
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:41,875
We'd like to heart the
story about you vaccine

1070
01:15:42,112 --> 01:15:44,376
Yes, that's a strange story

1071
01:15:48,052 --> 01:15:49,986
I am coming to that

1072
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:55,020
As you know, leprosy
attacks at an early age..

1073
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:57,552
But it's
incubation period is long..

1074
01:15:58,028 --> 01:16:01,225
after 15 to 20 years one
can know if it is leprosy

1075
01:16:01,332 --> 01:16:03,630
We've not come to
listen to school texts

1076
01:16:04,134 --> 01:16:05,863
I am talking about lepromatus

1077
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:09,095
I am talking about lepromatus

1078
01:16:15,346 --> 01:16:17,371
After culturing, lepro bacillus..

1079
01:16:17,748 --> 01:16:21,013
when I injected it in brown mice..

1080
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,608
Why not in a cat?

1081
01:16:29,026 --> 01:16:32,189
Since leprosy is
infected in childhood..

1082
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,391
I experimented in two ways

1083
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,363
On a dozen each of
male and female brown mice

1084
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:45,632
I noticed, that after vaccination

1085
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:50,140
When I inoculated them
with lepro bacillus..

1086
01:16:50,714 --> 01:16:52,477
All the mice were infected..

1087
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:57,646
except the young ones of the
female mice who were vaccinated

1088
01:16:58,622 --> 01:17:00,920
Then I froze that
bacillus by freeze drying..

1089
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,960
In these days of power
cuts which fridge did you use?

1090
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:07,823
Who said that?

1091
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,628
You said that.

1092
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:14,733
No scientist is present here

1093
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:18,105
I'm not talking about
the domestic fridge..

1094
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:21,344
I mean, liquid nitrogen freezer,
do you understand?

1095
01:17:21,879 --> 01:17:23,938
Will someone ask this
leper doctor to sit?

1096
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:29,316
Dr. Roy we have no
interest in leprosy

1097
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,814
Then, why did you call me?

1098
01:17:32,623 --> 01:17:34,750
I've only worked on
the leprosy vaccine

1099
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:38,261
Just because a few
suffer from leprosy..

1100
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,660
must all women be injected..

1101
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:42,561
With the leprosy vaccine

1102
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,462
Do you know the number?

1103
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,497
3.5 to 4 million people..

1104
01:17:50,107 --> 01:17:53,941
suffer from leprosy in our country

1105
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,408
Why do you vaccinate for pox?

1106
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,551
That too is a poison

1107
01:18:01,652 --> 01:18:02,949
Do you or not?

1108
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:20,066
I ask from the gynecologist's
point of view. - What?

1109
01:18:20,471 --> 01:18:24,601
Why did you claim that your vaccine
can treat sterility in a woman?

1110
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:29,972
I thought this was a science seminar

1111
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:32,705
But this is a circus arena

1112
01:18:32,983 --> 01:18:34,348
You are a joker.

1113
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,314
All of you are bunch of jokers.

1114
01:18:36,553 --> 01:18:39,488
No, no, no, no.

1115
01:18:39,957 --> 01:18:42,949
I'd like to hear Dr. Roy.. please

1116
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:46,919
How is Gonadotropin
related to your vaccine?

1117
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,698
I used it as a medium

1118
01:18:53,504 --> 01:18:55,335
I never claimed,
that my vaccine will..

1119
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,771
treat sterility in a woman

1120
01:18:58,308 --> 01:18:59,673
But a possibility exists

1121
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:02,309
And possibility is a
very big thing in science.

1122
01:19:03,013 --> 01:19:04,844
Where did you get Gonadotropin?

1123
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:06,343
One needs to import it.

1124
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,974
Show us your import license

1125
01:19:08,886 --> 01:19:13,323
I developed it
myself from horse's blood.

1126
01:19:13,557 --> 01:19:14,683
Horse's blood?

1127
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:16,886
You have any doubts.

1128
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,795
Down with the Leper doctor.

1129
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:24,959
Down with the Leper doctor.

1130
01:19:25,035 --> 01:19:28,801
Down with the Leper doctor.

1131
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:30,271
Leave me. Leave me.

1132
01:19:41,418 --> 01:19:42,578
Brother.

1133
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:45,320
You are drenched in sweat

1134
01:19:45,756 --> 01:19:47,087
Are you well?

1135
01:19:47,624 --> 01:19:49,182
There's pain in the chest

1136
01:19:49,426 --> 01:19:52,054
Let's go to the hospital

1137
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:55,832
No. I'll go to Seema

1138
01:19:56,266 --> 01:19:59,793
It may be a heart problem
Lets go to the hospital first.

1139
01:20:00,037 --> 01:20:01,732
No. Let's go to Seema

1140
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:04,506
Let me open the window.

1141
01:20:05,142 --> 01:20:06,541
Let me get some fresh air

1142
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:16,644
Where can you get fresh air?

1143
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:19,313
It's lost somewhere.

1144
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:25,053
The meeting that we went to.. is a reflection of our
society

1145
01:20:25,295 --> 01:20:26,785
We are part of a society..

1146
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,931
in which some persons
want to destroy you Why?

1147
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,858
Because they can't contribute..

1148
01:20:32,603 --> 01:20:34,366
they want to destroy you

1149
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:51,949
What's the matter?

1150
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:54,282
Nothing. I want to lie down

1151
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:58,056
What happened?
- They were rogues!

1152
01:20:59,196 --> 01:21:00,595
He became sick

1153
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:04,790
I wanted to take him to the
hospital But he insisted to see you

1154
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,240
It's my fault

1155
01:21:21,552 --> 01:21:24,453
I insisted on his
going to the meeting

1156
01:21:27,624 --> 01:21:28,750
You did right

1157
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,060
I spent my life in this tiny lab..

1158
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:38,995
Today I realised the
existence of the outside world

1159
01:21:40,137 --> 01:21:43,868
Sit near him I'll call Arijit
- No.. No.

1160
01:21:45,676 --> 01:21:47,473
No need to call Arijit

1161
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:50,641
I am a doctor

1162
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:53,382
I know, what's wrong with me

1163
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,545
Amulya, go now

1164
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,788
You're a journalist,
you've to cover the meeting

1165
01:22:05,362 --> 01:22:09,856
I cover meetings and seminars..

1166
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,400
not hooliganism

1167
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:15,632
And I am telling you.

1168
01:22:17,174 --> 01:22:18,573
I won't remain silent

1169
01:22:19,443 --> 01:22:20,933
Those who've insulted you..

1170
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:22,308
who are they anyway?

1171
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,074
Who are they?

1172
01:22:26,283 --> 01:22:27,443
Who are they.

1173
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:30,915
These are the same people
who accused Dr. J. C. Bose.

1174
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:34,220
of stealing laboratory instruments

1175
01:22:37,694 --> 01:22:41,721
It's funny that we go to
see a play on Gallelio..

1176
01:22:42,532 --> 01:22:44,830
and applaud resoundingly

1177
01:22:46,036 --> 01:22:49,096
I will get that. There's
no limit to our pretensions

1178
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:55,772
Hello. - Do you think
science is child's play?

1179
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,371
Who told Dipankar
to give the lecture?

1180
01:22:58,448 --> 01:23:01,747
Advance publicity on T.V., radio..

1181
01:23:01,818 --> 01:23:03,683
has resulted in adverse reactions..

1182
01:23:03,754 --> 01:23:05,153
and now this meeting!

1183
01:23:05,389 --> 01:23:10,383
Tell him, he must
complete his papers quickly

1184
01:24:02,879 --> 01:24:04,141
Hello.

1185
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:06,271
I am worried

1186
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,277
He is not well

1187
01:24:08,985 --> 01:24:10,213
What?

1188
01:24:10,821 --> 01:24:11,981
What are you saying?

1189
01:24:14,224 --> 01:24:17,785
Disturbance at the meeting?

1190
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:21,758
I don't know

1191
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,597
He was humiliated..

1192
01:24:26,036 --> 01:24:27,435
He is ill..

1193
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:30,333
complained of pain in this chest

1194
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,937
Just a minute

1195
01:24:38,515 --> 01:24:41,211
Dipankar has fallen ill

1196
01:24:41,585 --> 01:24:44,247
He was invited to a
meeting where he was insulted

1197
01:24:44,654 --> 01:24:46,053
He complained of pain in the chest

1198
01:24:51,395 --> 01:24:52,987
Seema.. is he perspiring?

1199
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,988
He was drenched in
sweat when he came

1200
01:24:56,433 --> 01:24:58,025
I'll come right away

1201
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,461
I'll do the E.C.G there

1202
01:25:03,073 --> 01:25:07,305
Orijit. - Idiot, why did
you come to the phone?

1203
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:09,505
Go and lie down, I'm coming

1204
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:15,679
Don't bother, I am fine

1205
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:22,319
I knew, Seema has no
one to call except you

1206
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:27,427
I am fine

1207
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,262
Tell Paro not to worry

1208
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,237
Is he refusing?

1209
01:25:45,549 --> 01:25:46,914
I knew it.

1210
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:56,655
Aren't you a doctor?

1211
01:25:58,395 --> 01:25:59,657
Why do you ask?

1212
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:03,932
I believed, doctors
have a code of ethics

1213
01:26:04,334 --> 01:26:07,394
I do follow the code.
- No.

1214
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,664
You don't

1215
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:13,205
All of you are
after Dipankar's blood

1216
01:26:13,443 --> 01:26:14,535
Me!

1217
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:17,243
I'm your wife

1218
01:26:17,914 --> 01:26:19,245
You can't hide it from me

1219
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,349
You are one of them

1220
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,481
Why does Ramanand call you often?

1221
01:26:26,189 --> 01:26:28,419
Always talking about Dipankar

1222
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:32,026
He unjustly criticised
Dipankar in the press

1223
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,163
But you did not protest

1224
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:39,292
Shame! You and
Dipankar grew up together

1225
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,366
He loves you dearly

1226
01:26:41,638 --> 01:26:44,630
It's nothing to do
with personal relationship

1227
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:49,338
As a gynecologist,
Ramanand has a right to protest

1228
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,971
There are more renowned
gynecologists than him..

1229
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,142
They did not protest

1230
01:26:55,552 --> 01:26:57,645
Why is he
masterminding the campaign?

1231
01:26:58,622 --> 01:27:00,419
Why does he want you on his side?

1232
01:27:02,692 --> 01:27:04,785
If you wish, You can stop all this

1233
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:07,788
Who am I? Why should
they listen to me?

1234
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:13,560
Don't evade
Everyone in Kolkata respects you

1235
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,065
A hospital is under your charge

1236
01:27:16,703 --> 01:27:18,227
All nursing homes recommend you

1237
01:27:18,304 --> 01:27:19,703
You have influence in the government

1238
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:21,467
Medical science is not in my hands

1239
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:25,644
I'm a doctor, but
Dipankar is a scientist

1240
01:27:26,412 --> 01:27:28,710
A scientific
invention is not child's play

1241
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:32,384
There'll be debates, discussions..

1242
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:33,918
and seminars

1243
01:27:34,253 --> 01:27:35,345
Everyone will ask for proof

1244
01:27:35,588 --> 01:27:37,488
And Dipankar will
have to furnish that

1245
01:27:38,891 --> 01:27:41,382
Here, neither you, me or Dipankar..

1246
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:44,590
nor our personal
relationship matters

1247
01:28:02,548 --> 01:28:04,106
Arijit, you know?

1248
01:28:04,984 --> 01:28:07,578
I have sent Dipankar's notes..

1249
01:28:07,687 --> 01:28:13,057
to John Anderson Foundation

1250
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:15,418
John Anderson Foundation?
- Yes.

1251
01:28:15,962 --> 01:28:19,398
I have great hope

1252
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:24,000
After a long time, an
original work in science..

1253
01:28:24,604 --> 01:28:28,005
a major break through in India

1254
01:28:35,782 --> 01:28:37,181
Sir.

1255
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:42,213
Okay

1256
01:28:44,824 --> 01:28:45,984
Send it today by hand delivery

1257
01:28:46,425 --> 01:28:49,792
Okay, sir.

1258
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:02,537
A letter from the government.
Sign here

1259
01:30:05,838 --> 01:30:08,864
They have
transferred me to a village

1260
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,568
What shall I do now?

1261
01:30:15,448 --> 01:30:17,473
My papers aren't ready yet

1262
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,982
A lot of work is unfinished

1263
01:30:24,557 --> 01:30:25,717
How can I write my paper,

1264
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,554
if I don't stay in Calcutta?

1265
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:51,250
Sit down.

1266
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:56,017
Dr. Roy has been
transferred to a village

1267
01:30:57,023 --> 01:31:01,289
Thus depriving a
scientist from doing his research

1268
01:31:01,727 --> 01:31:03,217
We can't publish that

1269
01:31:04,597 --> 01:31:09,330
Why? - Dr. Roy is not
a Newton or Einstein.

1270
01:31:11,003 --> 01:31:12,527
After from them, there
are many scientists..

1271
01:31:12,605 --> 01:31:15,005
about whom we do not know

1272
01:31:16,075 --> 01:31:17,167
But that doesn't matter here

1273
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:19,269
The fact is that, the
Director of Health..

1274
01:31:19,378 --> 01:31:21,209
is deliberately hounding out Dr. Roy

1275
01:31:21,847 --> 01:31:25,806
This might irreparably harm,
the cause of science

1276
01:31:26,652 --> 01:31:29,052
Let him prove he is a scientist

1277
01:31:29,455 --> 01:31:31,355
Give him a chance to do that

1278
01:31:32,258 --> 01:31:34,283
Government will stop
all advertisements

1279
01:31:34,527 --> 01:31:35,721
Do you know?

1280
01:31:36,562 --> 01:31:39,554
We cannot annoy them.

1281
01:31:40,066 --> 01:31:41,658
Advertisements keep
a newspaper going..

1282
01:31:41,767 --> 01:31:42,893
not a scientist

1283
01:31:45,404 --> 01:31:48,168
You are absolutely right

1284
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,301
Advertisements keep
a newspaper going..

1285
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:56,780
But I, better be going..

1286
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:07,787
It's only five hours
journey from Calcutta

1287
01:32:08,361 --> 01:32:10,488
I shall see you every weekend

1288
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:16,566
Aren't you coming with me?

1289
01:32:18,471 --> 01:32:21,463
If once we leave this house..

1290
01:32:21,707 --> 01:32:23,368
it will be difficult to get it again

1291
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:26,178
Besides, you aren't going,
there for ever

1292
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:28,703
When you'll return.. ?

1293
01:32:30,716 --> 01:32:34,277
And, who'll look
after your ''children''.

1294
01:32:38,157 --> 01:32:42,093
I'll manage to get
a job in school..

1295
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:44,796
or else, running
two establishments..

1296
01:32:44,864 --> 01:32:46,024
will be difficult

1297
01:32:51,604 --> 01:32:52,798
Don't worry,

1298
01:32:54,407 --> 01:32:55,738
I am with you

1299
01:33:57,636 --> 01:33:59,900
Do I have to examine all of them?

1300
01:34:00,606 --> 01:34:02,233
They have just started coming.

1301
01:34:02,308 --> 01:34:04,674
There'll be many more

1302
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:13,908
John Anderson Foundation, London.

1303
01:34:14,453 --> 01:34:17,752
Dr. Dipankar Roy, c/o
government health services.

1304
01:34:28,934 --> 01:34:31,664
John Anderson Foundation,
dear Dr. Roy.

1305
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:34,603
..we are so happy to learn
by the letter of Dr. Kundu..

1306
01:34:35,608 --> 01:34:37,769
About your valuable work on leprosy.

1307
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:42,242
We are very much interested
to know about your findings.

1308
01:34:42,314 --> 01:34:43,679
John Anderson. Nonsense.

1309
01:34:59,398 --> 01:35:03,630
John Anderson Foundation.
Foundation.

1310
01:35:19,618 --> 01:35:21,108
I've brought your dinner

1311
01:35:21,487 --> 01:35:23,352
Eat before it becomes cold

1312
01:35:23,455 --> 01:35:24,922
Keep it. I'll have it later.

1313
01:35:25,424 --> 01:35:28,359
It's already very late.
Please eat now

1314
01:35:28,894 --> 01:35:31,192
Can't you see I'm working?
I'll eat later

1315
01:35:31,931 --> 01:35:34,365
Okay. At least close the front door

1316
01:35:34,633 --> 01:35:39,070
The place is full of thieves.

1317
01:37:40,092 --> 01:37:41,184
When did you come?

1318
01:37:41,627 --> 01:37:43,356
Came straight from the station

1319
01:37:45,898 --> 01:37:47,422
You aren't going back tomorrow?

1320
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:54,199
If I don't, who'll look
after your lab animals?

1321
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:57,107
They were of no use

1322
01:37:58,644 --> 01:38:00,077
Somebody, they will be..

1323
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,877
They will.

1324
01:38:05,984 --> 01:38:07,212
Do you really believe?

1325
01:38:08,787 --> 01:38:09,981
Certainly

1326
01:38:16,528 --> 01:38:20,726
I haven't been able to do any work

1327
01:38:23,035 --> 01:38:24,502
The papers aren't ready

1328
01:38:31,844 --> 01:38:33,106
I miss you a lot

1329
01:38:40,285 --> 01:38:41,343
What is happening?

1330
01:38:43,389 --> 01:38:44,617
Don't do that

1331
01:38:46,992 --> 01:38:49,984
How can I leave you like this?

1332
01:38:53,031 --> 01:38:54,293
Please don't..

1333
01:38:56,869 --> 01:39:00,464
Let's go It's getting dark

1334
01:39:16,121 --> 01:39:17,247
What re you looking at?

1335
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:19,583
The sea

1336
01:39:21,393 --> 01:39:24,556
The questions of
science are like the waves

1337
01:39:26,365 --> 01:39:28,424
One after the other
they rise in the mind

1338
01:39:30,502 --> 01:39:32,402
A big question
followed by a small one..

1339
01:39:33,972 --> 01:39:35,906
a small one followed by a big one

1340
01:39:38,677 --> 01:39:40,269
I can answer these questions

1341
01:39:42,948 --> 01:39:44,040
Yes

1342
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:48,042
At least, some of them

1343
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:55,793
But I feel very helpless now

1344
01:39:57,963 --> 01:39:59,055
Things will change

1345
01:39:59,832 --> 01:40:01,265
Things will change, someday

1346
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,060
Just like you want it to be

1347
01:40:08,807 --> 01:40:11,037
I come here and sit everyday

1348
01:40:12,444 --> 01:40:13,843
I look at the stars

1349
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:17,605
I get a strange feeling

1350
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,751
I can't express it

1351
01:40:24,723 --> 01:40:26,657
The twinkling stars seem..

1352
01:40:27,926 --> 01:40:32,420
to send a message to me..

1353
01:40:32,931 --> 01:40:34,956
a challenge..

1354
01:40:37,402 --> 01:40:41,532
as if saying on your tiny planet..

1355
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,937
you humans are
always fighting each other

1356
01:40:43,308 --> 01:40:44,707
What a waste of time

1357
01:40:45,911 --> 01:40:47,037
Look at us

1358
01:40:48,046 --> 01:40:49,638
Try to know us

1359
01:40:51,683 --> 01:40:54,049
You are ignorant of the mysteries..

1360
01:40:54,753 --> 01:40:55,981
of this vast universe

1361
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:02,217
As humans, you are too proud

1362
01:41:03,595 --> 01:41:07,361
With all your
knowledge and wisdom..

1363
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,266
how much do you know about us?

1364
01:41:14,873 --> 01:41:16,101
Seema, there are some..

1365
01:41:19,077 --> 01:41:21,102
who want to accept this challenge..

1366
01:41:22,414 --> 01:41:24,882
they want to take the plunge..

1367
01:41:27,753 --> 01:41:29,721
but there are others
who pull them back

1368
01:41:30,389 --> 01:41:31,515
Why?

1369
01:41:34,693 --> 01:41:36,422
I have no answer for that

1370
01:41:43,769 --> 01:41:45,896
There are no reference books here

1371
01:41:48,073 --> 01:41:50,064
It's difficult to work here

1372
01:41:52,844 --> 01:41:54,744
Tell me, the books you need..

1373
01:41:55,647 --> 01:41:57,239
I'll get them next week

1374
01:41:59,084 --> 01:42:03,714
Only books won't do. I need
a lot of other things too..

1375
01:42:04,957 --> 01:42:06,549
Help from chemists..

1376
01:42:07,125 --> 01:42:08,990
the Calcutta
Bacteriological Institute..

1377
01:42:09,695 --> 01:42:10,787
Dr. Kundu

1378
01:42:12,531 --> 01:42:14,863
Research can't be
done by a single person

1379
01:42:15,934 --> 01:42:17,026
It is a team work.

1380
01:42:24,376 --> 01:42:25,502
Where to?

1381
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:28,444
A lot of work needs to be done.

1382
01:42:30,349 --> 01:42:32,112
Still five hours to go before dawn.

1383
01:42:32,451 --> 01:42:34,817
Let me work, you sleep

1384
01:42:36,788 --> 01:42:38,255
I have come only for a day

1385
01:42:39,391 --> 01:42:41,188
Can't you stay with me for a while

1386
01:43:17,596 --> 01:43:20,531
Excuse me, where can I
find Dr. Dibankar Roy.

1387
01:43:21,433 --> 01:43:24,459
Well, you have found him. - Oh,
Dr. Roy. Good morning.

1388
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:27,768
Good morning. - I am so
glad to find you at last.

1389
01:43:27,839 --> 01:43:30,364
You know I have come all the
way from London just to meet you.

1390
01:43:30,442 --> 01:43:31,602
Really?

1391
01:43:33,245 --> 01:43:34,439
Am I that important?

1392
01:43:34,713 --> 01:43:35,873
Of course you are.

1393
01:43:35,947 --> 01:43:38,916
I am so sorry, I
forgot to introduce myself.

1394
01:43:39,217 --> 01:43:42,186
I am Dr. Emily Bernard
from John Anderson Foundation.

1395
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:44,348
Pleased to meet you Dr. Bernard.

1396
01:43:45,757 --> 01:43:46,985
But who gave you my address?

1397
01:43:47,592 --> 01:43:50,026
Mr. Kundu gave us your address.

1398
01:43:50,128 --> 01:43:52,824
And it was he who wrote
to us about your work.

1399
01:43:52,931 --> 01:43:54,262
Then we wrote to your health
department saying that..

1400
01:43:54,366 --> 01:43:56,231
..we would like to interview you.

1401
01:43:56,301 --> 01:43:58,269
But we received no reply.

1402
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:01,168
However, we are not so easy to put
out so I came here in person.

1403
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,634
It is indeed very kind
of you, Dr. Bernard.

1404
01:44:04,710 --> 01:44:07,804
My wife. - Good morning.

1405
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,772
I think first you need a wash.

1406
01:44:09,848 --> 01:44:11,281
And then some tea or coffee.

1407
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:13,117
That will be very nice, thank you.

1408
01:44:13,418 --> 01:44:14,612
Come this way, please.

1409
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:22,988
My papers are not ready,
Dr. Bernard..

1410
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:26,292
..but these are the
synopsis and some of my notes.

1411
01:44:26,364 --> 01:44:29,231
So you can have a look at them
and then we can discuss about it..

1412
01:44:29,334 --> 01:44:30,392
..when I come back.

1413
01:44:31,737 --> 01:44:33,568
I am afraid I have
to go to the hospital.

1414
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:35,765
Seema will take care of you.

1415
01:44:36,374 --> 01:44:37,466
Okay, thank you.

1416
01:44:56,394 --> 01:44:57,827
It's so comprehensive.

1417
01:45:06,772 --> 01:45:08,933
Sugar. - No, thank you. Just milk.

1418
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:14,041
Will you try some
Indian food with us.

1419
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,006
Nothing much.

1420
01:45:16,081 --> 01:45:18,174
Just some fish and
vegetables available here.

1421
01:45:19,284 --> 01:45:21,013
Please don't take too much trouble.

1422
01:45:21,086 --> 01:45:22,713
Whatever you cook
I will be glad to take.

1423
01:45:22,954 --> 01:45:26,014
Now, if you don't mind I would like
to concentrate on these papers.

1424
01:45:26,091 --> 01:45:27,251
Yes, certainly.

1425
01:46:05,964 --> 01:46:08,125
Thank you, Dr. Roy,
you have been so kind.

1426
01:46:08,166 --> 01:46:10,566
I hope I have not taken up
too much of your precious time.

1427
01:46:10,635 --> 01:46:13,763
On the contrary, Dr. Bernard, I
have been educated by your visit.

1428
01:46:14,706 --> 01:46:15,798
Thank you very much.

1429
01:46:17,475 --> 01:46:18,999
Seema will help
you to reach Kolkata.

1430
01:46:19,611 --> 01:46:21,875
Please don't bother, I am
used to traveling alone.

1431
01:46:22,113 --> 01:46:23,808
No, I have to board
the same train anyway.

1432
01:46:24,082 --> 01:46:26,573
Since I work in Kolkata, I
come here only on weekends.

1433
01:46:27,185 --> 01:46:29,278
Alright. Well then,
thank you once again.

1434
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:46,628
Come on

1435
01:46:46,738 --> 01:46:48,228
Seema has been waiting for long

1436
01:46:49,274 --> 01:46:50,639
Have you finished your talking?

1437
01:46:51,309 --> 01:46:52,833
She hasn't come here to gossip

1438
01:46:53,812 --> 01:46:54,870
She has come to meet you

1439
01:47:05,724 --> 01:47:06,782
How are you Seema?

1440
01:47:08,193 --> 01:47:09,251
How is Dipu?

1441
01:47:11,062 --> 01:47:14,054
Can't he get a transfer..

1442
01:47:15,433 --> 01:47:17,094
back to Calcutta?

1443
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:22,131
You know, Seema?

1444
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:25,536
Dipankar is very short-tempered

1445
01:47:26,411 --> 01:47:28,038
He loses his head
over little matters

1446
01:47:29,114 --> 01:47:32,447
He abused the Director of Health..

1447
01:47:32,517 --> 01:47:33,643
in his own office

1448
01:47:34,386 --> 01:47:35,876
Officials are annoyed with him

1449
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:39,582
I admit he's brilliant

1450
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:42,216
But he lacks humility

1451
01:47:45,697 --> 01:47:47,824
I don't know how I can help

1452
01:47:50,802 --> 01:47:53,327
If you would see him once..

1453
01:47:55,173 --> 01:47:56,572
he is miserably alone in the village

1454
01:47:58,443 --> 01:48:01,606
All through the nights
he works on his papers

1455
01:48:03,682 --> 01:48:05,980
Some times, he
feels pain in his chest

1456
01:48:06,985 --> 01:48:09,180
He is drenched in his sweat

1457
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:13,521
He is my husband

1458
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:16,954
Yet, I have to take
care of him like a child

1459
01:48:23,301 --> 01:48:27,397
In spite of his faults,
should such a talented man..

1460
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,673
like him, be lost forever

1461
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:34,202
Won't he get another chance?

1462
01:48:37,048 --> 01:48:39,949
Dr. Emily Bernard from the
John Anderson Foundation..

1463
01:48:40,051 --> 01:48:41,541
came to interview him in the village

1464
01:48:42,887 --> 01:48:45,617
But his papers were not ready

1465
01:48:46,925 --> 01:48:47,983
Seema

1466
01:48:59,871 --> 01:49:00,997
Calm down, Seema

1467
01:49:02,674 --> 01:49:03,766
Please.

1468
01:49:09,647 --> 01:49:12,946
Come, Paromita. Let's
reach Seema to her house

1469
01:49:13,418 --> 01:49:16,148
No need. She can go herself

1470
01:49:19,791 --> 01:49:21,156
Dr. Bernard has
asked me to send this..

1471
01:49:21,393 --> 01:49:23,190
to the health department

1472
01:49:23,928 --> 01:49:27,989
I don't know anyone other than you

1473
01:49:29,768 --> 01:49:32,566
They had written to the
health department before..

1474
01:49:33,638 --> 01:49:35,071
but they didn't receive any reply

1475
01:50:11,676 --> 01:50:13,303
Arijit.. please come

1476
01:50:13,711 --> 01:50:14,939
After a long time

1477
01:50:15,046 --> 01:50:16,877
How is everything?

1478
01:50:17,315 --> 01:50:19,875
Have come with an appeal

1479
01:50:19,951 --> 01:50:21,748
Appeal to me?

1480
01:50:23,755 --> 01:50:26,121
Only 2 years to go before I retire

1481
01:50:26,658 --> 01:50:29,422
Then, I'll have to appeal to you

1482
01:50:30,361 --> 01:50:33,626
Why? - To get a few
patients on your recommendation

1483
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:34,993
How will I survive?

1484
01:50:36,501 --> 01:50:37,627
Let's come to business.

1485
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:42,702
You should bring
Dipankar back to Calcutta

1486
01:50:42,807 --> 01:50:43,899
Why?

1487
01:50:44,008 --> 01:50:45,134
For our own good

1488
01:50:45,443 --> 01:50:48,310
He should be given a chance..

1489
01:50:48,379 --> 01:50:49,505
to get his papers ready

1490
01:50:49,581 --> 01:50:51,139
He can do that in the tranquil..

1491
01:50:51,249 --> 01:50:54,309
atmosphere of the village

1492
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:59,218
To complete his work, he
needs to be in Calcutta

1493
01:50:59,724 --> 01:51:01,157
We know that

1494
01:51:01,926 --> 01:51:06,226
Call him back, or it
will cost you your job

1495
01:51:07,799 --> 01:51:09,767
Has he complained to the minister?

1496
01:51:10,802 --> 01:51:11,928
No

1497
01:51:12,237 --> 01:51:13,602
Has he spoken to the
opposition leader..

1498
01:51:14,839 --> 01:51:18,002
to make an issue of
it in the assembly

1499
01:51:18,409 --> 01:51:19,808
Nothing of that sort

1500
01:51:20,678 --> 01:51:23,909
John Anderson
Foundation had invited him..

1501
01:51:24,649 --> 01:51:26,241
They had written once, earlier

1502
01:51:26,885 --> 01:51:29,479
Seems, it was misplaced here

1503
01:51:30,288 --> 01:51:32,779
Lost amongst thousands of flies

1504
01:51:33,324 --> 01:51:35,087
And its not easy to find it.

1505
01:51:36,327 --> 01:51:37,624
Perhaps you don't know

1506
01:51:38,663 --> 01:51:41,063
The British are very different

1507
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,661
Dr. Emily Bernard
of the Foundation..

1508
01:51:44,435 --> 01:51:46,426
personally met
Dipankar in the village

1509
01:51:47,572 --> 01:51:49,301
She gave this letter

1510
01:51:50,508 --> 01:51:53,136
She's invited him again,
with all his papers.

1511
01:51:54,045 --> 01:51:57,344
If the press were
to latch on to this

1512
01:51:57,949 --> 01:51:59,917
Then surely, questions
would be raised in the assembly

1513
01:52:00,919 --> 01:52:04,582
And them the tempest will start
pouring far beyond the tea cup.

1514
01:52:08,927 --> 01:52:12,954
I don't know, how
to hand over charge

1515
01:52:13,998 --> 01:52:17,399
Don't worry. Please sit

1516
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:19,431
I'll do it

1517
01:52:20,205 --> 01:52:22,469
I've spent my whole
life in transfers..

1518
01:52:22,574 --> 01:52:23,973
from one hospital to another

1519
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,907
Are you leaving today?

1520
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:27,409
Yes. Lot of work to do in Calcutta

1521
01:52:27,478 --> 01:52:28,945
Sign here. - Thank you.

1522
01:52:33,618 --> 01:52:34,710
How long will you need..

1523
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:35,911
to get your papers ready?

1524
01:52:37,522 --> 01:52:38,853
How long?

1525
01:52:39,924 --> 01:52:42,222
About two months

1526
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:47,598
Unless your papers are examined..

1527
01:52:48,233 --> 01:52:50,463
by the government
at a high level,..

1528
01:52:51,236 --> 01:52:56,799
We can't allow you to go abroad.

1529
01:52:58,343 --> 01:53:03,838
But surely, you can resign

1530
01:53:06,584 --> 01:53:08,848
It's not possible for me to resign

1531
01:53:09,954 --> 01:53:12,684
I'm in debt, because of
the lab, I built at home

1532
01:53:12,757 --> 01:53:14,918
Then work in a private hospital

1533
01:53:16,594 --> 01:53:18,323
After statements of
the gynecologists..

1534
01:53:18,396 --> 01:53:20,990
which hospital will
employ me? tell me.

1535
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:25,762
They've stamped me as leper doctor

1536
01:53:26,204 --> 01:53:29,367
Then be an assistant to
Arijit.. your class mate

1537
01:53:31,209 --> 01:53:33,200
That won't be possible for me

1538
01:53:36,914 --> 01:53:39,849
I'll write to John
Anderson Foundation..

1539
01:53:40,685 --> 01:53:43,552
that I'll send the papers
after getting your clearance

1540
01:53:43,855 --> 01:53:45,083
No.. no.

1541
01:53:45,156 --> 01:53:46,851
You don't need to write that.

1542
01:53:47,292 --> 01:53:49,419
Tell them..

1543
01:53:50,028 --> 01:53:52,053
that your papers aren't ready yet

1544
01:53:52,764 --> 01:53:53,992
You'll send them later.

1545
01:53:54,532 --> 01:53:55,692
Isn't that the truth?

1546
01:53:57,035 --> 01:53:58,161
Okay.

1547
01:54:14,419 --> 01:54:17,479
Dipankar is forming a group

1548
01:54:17,889 --> 01:54:18,947
How is that?

1549
01:54:19,057 --> 01:54:20,957
Famous gynecologist Dr. Biswas..

1550
01:54:21,059 --> 01:54:22,959
is openly canvassing for him

1551
01:54:24,162 --> 01:54:27,188
Dr. Banerjee, Dr.
Mitra are baking him

1552
01:54:27,298 --> 01:54:30,131
Some skin
specialists are praising him

1553
01:54:30,968 --> 01:54:32,765
Then, you better stop

1554
01:54:32,837 --> 01:54:35,704
Are we villains to run away?

1555
01:54:36,074 --> 01:54:39,237
Our group may be small,
but it's powerful

1556
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:40,800
I am going to unmask him

1557
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:42,906
I belong to no group

1558
01:54:43,414 --> 01:54:44,813
I'm on the side of truth

1559
01:54:44,882 --> 01:54:48,579
I agree. Let truth prevail

1560
01:54:48,853 --> 01:54:50,753
An enquiry committee is being set up

1561
01:54:51,556 --> 01:54:53,080
Enquiry committee? - Yes.

1562
01:54:54,325 --> 01:54:57,260
That's sure way to
suppress truth for ever..

1563
01:54:57,362 --> 01:54:59,523
..that's the only job of
an enquiry committee.

1564
01:54:59,597 --> 01:55:01,258
I beg to differ with you.

1565
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,425
Director of Health wants it

1566
01:55:04,836 --> 01:55:06,827
B.B.C has broadcast this news

1567
01:55:06,904 --> 01:55:09,464
The Anderson Foundation
has sent an invitation

1568
01:55:09,574 --> 01:55:11,940
The matter cannot be taken lightly

1569
01:55:12,443 --> 01:55:13,740
You are right.

1570
01:55:13,811 --> 01:55:16,644
Of course, we've to
think of our prestige!

1571
01:55:17,248 --> 01:55:18,772
Don't be sarcastic.

1572
01:55:19,384 --> 01:55:22,285
It's decided, who'll
be in the committee

1573
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:24,078
Who?

1574
01:55:24,155 --> 01:55:26,146
You.. as the Chairman

1575
01:55:26,524 --> 01:55:27,718
Me?
- Yes.

1576
01:55:27,825 --> 01:55:28,985
You must be joking.

1577
01:55:29,894 --> 01:55:32,829
I don't have time
for such silly matters

1578
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:36,959
Let's go.

1579
01:55:43,508 --> 01:55:45,032
I've arranged the
papers in this file

1580
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:47,009
Here's your coat

1581
01:55:47,445 --> 01:55:49,504
I don't need a file or coat

1582
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:53,412
Am I going for in interview?

1583
01:55:54,018 --> 01:55:56,316
That I should wear a
suit and carry this file.

1584
01:55:58,389 --> 01:56:00,857
Won't there be eminent
persons on the committee?

1585
01:56:02,226 --> 01:56:03,921
Enquiry committee my foot.

1586
01:56:06,597 --> 01:56:09,623
Am I some criminal,
that I have to face..

1587
01:56:09,734 --> 01:56:10,826
an enquiry committee?

1588
01:56:13,004 --> 01:56:15,632
Was there an enquiry
committee for Dr. J. C. Bose..

1589
01:56:17,809 --> 01:56:19,401
C. V. Raman, P.C. Roy?

1590
01:56:20,178 --> 01:56:21,577
But things have changed

1591
01:56:21,646 --> 01:56:22,806
Nothing has changed

1592
01:56:24,482 --> 01:56:25,710
We are still in the dark ages

1593
01:56:28,085 --> 01:56:29,814
Enquiry committee will judge me!

1594
01:56:34,992 --> 01:56:36,186
Is there a man in Calcutta..

1595
01:56:36,294 --> 01:56:37,625
who can talk to me about leprosy?

1596
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:40,222
One man.

1597
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:47,062
Listen.

1598
01:56:48,806 --> 01:56:50,501
Don't lose your temper

1599
01:56:52,176 --> 01:56:53,302
Okay, leave me

1600
01:56:57,815 --> 01:57:01,216
Don't go by bus or train

1601
01:57:01,285 --> 01:57:02,718
Take a taxi

1602
01:57:10,161 --> 01:57:11,389
You're late.

1603
01:57:11,462 --> 01:57:12,861
This is an enquiry committee meeting

1604
01:57:13,564 --> 01:57:14,656
Shut up.

1605
01:57:27,011 --> 01:57:28,979
Come, please sit

1606
01:57:30,147 --> 01:57:31,478
Shut the door

1607
01:57:34,752 --> 01:57:37,118
I'll introduce the
members of the committee

1608
01:57:37,889 --> 01:57:40,756
The chairman, Dr.
Ramanand Chatterjee

1609
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,550
Famous gynecologist.

1610
01:57:43,494 --> 01:57:46,395
Gynecologist, Dr. Sitapati Sengupta

1611
01:57:47,798 --> 01:57:52,064
Uma Shankar Upadhyay,
who runs a leprosy home

1612
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:56,169
Dr. Kedarnath Das, who
runs a leprosy clinic

1613
01:57:56,941 --> 01:58:01,469
And I'm a member secretary
appointed by the government

1614
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:05,747
You claim to have
invented a vaccine for leprosy

1615
01:58:06,217 --> 01:58:08,481
In scientific terms,
it's wrong to say so..

1616
01:58:08,953 --> 01:58:11,581
But there's a possibility..

1617
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:12,781
A definite possibility.

1618
01:58:13,457 --> 01:58:15,982
Do you have the papers
of your experiments?

1619
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:18,426
I didn't feel the need to bring them

1620
01:58:18,763 --> 01:58:23,097
In my leprosy home
there are 556 patients

1621
01:58:23,701 --> 01:58:25,362
We look after them

1622
01:58:26,003 --> 01:58:28,335
I think, this disease is incurable

1623
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,335
May I know the treatment?

1624
01:58:31,842 --> 01:58:34,936
There is just one treatement.
Chalmugra oil

1625
01:58:35,046 --> 01:58:37,071
That was used in the 19th century

1626
01:58:37,148 --> 01:58:41,107
No, in the 19th century
it was applied on the skin

1627
01:58:41,352 --> 01:58:42,580
Now we inject it

1628
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,348
Oh, God.

1629
01:58:45,289 --> 01:58:47,780
That's more painful than the disease

1630
01:58:48,092 --> 01:58:53,052
In our clinic we give
the modern treatment

1631
01:58:53,764 --> 01:58:56,699
I know, you treat with D.D.S.

1632
01:58:57,034 --> 01:58:59,832
Di Amino Di phenyl Sulpha,
commonly known as Depsone

1633
01:58:59,904 --> 01:59:02,338
Yes, Depsone.

1634
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,169
No, but there are other drugs

1635
01:59:04,275 --> 01:59:07,142
Such as.
- Ciba 1806. - Lamprene

1636
01:59:07,645 --> 01:59:09,306
In case you don't know,
It's a Swiss medicine

1637
01:59:09,413 --> 01:59:11,643
It's not a drug.. but a dye

1638
01:59:11,716 --> 01:59:14,150
After using it,
patient's skin colour changes

1639
01:59:14,251 --> 01:59:16,082
So patients decline to use it

1640
01:59:16,387 --> 01:59:18,321
We've no information about that

1641
01:59:18,856 --> 01:59:21,188
Search for it, you'll find it

1642
01:59:22,326 --> 01:59:24,260
Don't you try M.D.T?

1643
01:59:24,362 --> 01:59:26,592
I mean multi drug therapy

1644
01:59:29,166 --> 01:59:32,431
In non infectious type.. Dapson..

1645
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,028
Rifampicin

1646
01:59:35,906 --> 01:59:38,272
But owing to it's toxicity,
you can't give..

1647
01:59:38,342 --> 01:59:40,003
to a patient who has jaundice

1648
01:59:41,045 --> 01:59:45,277
In infectious type,
Dapson, Rifampicin and Lamprene

1649
01:59:45,783 --> 01:59:47,546
How long can one give?

1650
01:59:48,285 --> 01:59:50,583
Why? But Dapson
gives positive results

1651
01:59:52,123 --> 01:59:57,755
Owing to bacterial resistance
it won't work long.

1652
01:59:57,828 --> 01:59:58,954
Once the bacteria becomes
immune it will stop working. So.

1653
02:00:00,398 --> 02:00:04,994
So we can say no sign of
control of Leprosy so far.

1654
02:00:05,236 --> 02:00:09,639
That's why we want to
know about your work

1655
02:00:11,308 --> 02:00:12,400
You?

1656
02:00:15,713 --> 02:00:16,873
Who are you anyway?

1657
02:00:17,314 --> 02:00:19,839
Shut up, and give us
scientific explanation..

1658
02:00:19,917 --> 02:00:23,751
regarding your vaccine's
property of treating sterility

1659
02:00:23,988 --> 02:00:25,182
Sorry.

1660
02:00:25,589 --> 02:00:26,886
I cannot say anything about that.

1661
02:00:26,957 --> 02:00:29,152
Since this is not my subject.

1662
02:00:29,226 --> 02:00:31,956
My subject is leprosy
not your damned sterility!

1663
02:00:33,564 --> 02:00:36,863
The committee expects
some humility from you

1664
02:00:40,004 --> 02:00:41,631
Where are your research papers?

1665
02:00:42,006 --> 02:00:43,701
How can we judge?

1666
02:00:43,808 --> 02:00:45,036
You will judge me?

1667
02:00:45,543 --> 02:00:46,635
You?

1668
02:00:47,611 --> 02:00:49,306
Are you a molecular biologist?

1669
02:00:50,715 --> 02:00:51,909
Are you a cellular biologist?

1670
02:00:53,384 --> 02:00:54,578
Who amongst you is a microbiologist?

1671
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:57,280
You call yourself doctors?

1672
02:00:57,354 --> 02:00:59,686
You don't even know
the drugs for leprosy.

1673
02:01:00,357 --> 02:01:03,224
You are not even doctors.

1674
02:01:03,594 --> 02:01:04,754
You are bunch of jokers.

1675
02:01:05,062 --> 02:01:06,962
Are we to be insulted like this?

1676
02:01:07,031 --> 02:01:08,862
Is this what we
have been called for?

1677
02:01:08,966 --> 02:01:11,332
Don't we have any respect?

1678
02:01:11,402 --> 02:01:14,894
Doctors.
- Please calm down.

1679
02:01:15,372 --> 02:01:17,670
Sorry, gentlemen, I am very sorry.

1680
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:19,671
Calm down, please calm down.

1681
02:01:20,244 --> 02:01:23,475
You don't have the manners to talk.

1682
02:01:24,949 --> 02:01:28,544
Dr. Roy, you are ruining yourself

1683
02:01:29,854 --> 02:01:32,755
No, I am ruining the cause of Man

1684
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:37,654
Humans.

1685
02:01:41,365 --> 02:01:43,697
John Anderson
Foundation has invited me..

1686
02:01:44,869 --> 02:01:48,498
to read my papers.
Just allow me to go

1687
02:01:49,073 --> 02:01:50,233
Impossible.

1688
02:01:50,708 --> 02:01:53,006
We have a glorious
tradition in the field of science

1689
02:01:53,077 --> 02:01:55,978
We can't allow its
reputation to be spoilt..

1690
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,513
.. in a foreign land

1691
02:01:58,983 --> 02:02:00,382
What do all of you think?

1692
02:02:01,285 --> 02:02:02,479
Why do you need permission?

1693
02:02:02,787 --> 02:02:04,584
Just resign and go

1694
02:02:04,989 --> 02:02:07,787
Anderson Foundation
will gladly accept you

1695
02:02:07,892 --> 02:02:09,757
No, no, its not that.

1696
02:02:10,161 --> 02:02:12,823
Just a minute.

1697
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:15,396
I suggest Dr. Roy should..

1698
02:02:15,466 --> 02:02:17,024
apply through the proper channel

1699
02:02:18,202 --> 02:02:20,136
The government will think over it..

1700
02:02:20,204 --> 02:02:21,501
and do the needful

1701
02:02:21,605 --> 02:02:23,766
Right.
- I agree

1702
02:02:27,912 --> 02:02:30,346
It means, you want to finish me here

1703
02:02:37,788 --> 02:02:39,779
You hounded me from the beginning

1704
02:02:40,925 --> 02:02:42,017
From the beginning.

1705
02:02:43,794 --> 02:02:46,160
I am not afraid of you

1706
02:02:46,463 --> 02:02:47,555
Not even one.

1707
02:02:48,632 --> 02:02:52,159
And you. Look here Mr. Lion face.
Your face is like a lion

1708
02:02:53,037 --> 02:02:54,937
Your face is like a lion

1709
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:59,598
In ancient Ayurved that's
the first sign of leprosy

1710
02:03:00,811 --> 02:03:01,903
So be careful.

1711
02:03:03,147 --> 02:03:06,275
You are all lepers

1712
02:03:07,084 --> 02:03:09,109
You shout like a lion?

1713
02:03:20,197 --> 02:03:22,222
I admit, I have not
developed a vaccine

1714
02:03:24,768 --> 02:03:25,860
I surrender.

1715
02:03:49,727 --> 02:03:52,423
I made them suffer, Seema

1716
02:03:55,232 --> 02:03:57,359
I infected them with leprosy

1717
02:04:01,906 --> 02:04:03,931
They suffered for years

1718
02:04:09,847 --> 02:04:10,905
But why?

1719
02:04:12,483 --> 02:04:13,575
For what?

1720
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:30,728
Have you thought about the future?

1721
02:04:34,138 --> 02:04:35,230
Your papers are ready.

1722
02:04:35,306 --> 02:04:39,299
We can send your papers to
the Anderson Foundation

1723
02:04:40,444 --> 02:04:44,505
Prior to that, you have to resign

1724
02:04:45,716 --> 02:04:47,308
He will resign, Dr. Kundu

1725
02:04:48,385 --> 02:04:50,285
I won't allow him to work there

1726
02:04:51,555 --> 02:04:55,184
This job is the
cause of all problems.

1727
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:57,850
Since I'm working now

1728
02:04:58,228 --> 02:04:59,718
We will manage with that.

1729
02:05:00,798 --> 02:05:02,197
He will concentrate only on research

1730
02:05:05,769 --> 02:05:06,861
Brother.

1731
02:05:10,607 --> 02:05:11,733
Sir.

1732
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,572
Good, you are here

1733
02:05:15,412 --> 02:05:17,039
I've brought news..

1734
02:05:17,848 --> 02:05:19,645
published in a
foreign medical journal

1735
02:05:24,221 --> 02:05:25,313
Shall I read?

1736
02:05:26,156 --> 02:05:27,350
Read it

1737
02:05:28,392 --> 02:05:30,622
We are happy to say that,
vaccine for leprosy..

1738
02:05:30,728 --> 02:05:32,093
Has been developed..

1739
02:05:39,136 --> 02:05:41,627
based on Dr.
Altman's incomplete work..

1740
02:05:41,705 --> 02:05:44,071
With a hormone of the
Gonadotropin group as medium..

1741
02:05:44,375 --> 02:05:48,004
it has been possible
to grow lepro bacilli

1742
02:05:49,113 --> 02:05:52,276
As a result, brown
mice could be made host

1743
02:05:53,050 --> 02:05:55,712
This is what Dipankar did

1744
02:05:55,953 --> 02:05:57,580
You are right

1745
02:05:58,589 --> 02:06:00,750
The vaccine should be taken by
the mother during pregnancy ..

1746
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:05,719
so that her baby will
be immune to leprosy

1747
02:06:06,864 --> 02:06:08,422
At last. Dipankar.

1748
02:06:10,434 --> 02:06:12,334
The vaccine has another property

1749
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:14,965
It treats sterility in a woman

1750
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:17,940
This journal
congratulates the scientists

1751
02:06:18,809 --> 02:06:21,573
And hopes, leprosy
will soon be eradicated..

1752
02:06:21,912 --> 02:06:24,506
like pox and plague..

1753
02:06:26,583 --> 02:06:27,675
Yes, yes.

1754
02:06:29,653 --> 02:06:32,554
The names of the
scientists are Graham Jacob..

1755
02:06:32,656 --> 02:06:35,921
of the Research unit of
microbiology of Massachussettes..

1756
02:06:37,294 --> 02:06:39,159
and Dr. Alberto Bassilini

1757
02:07:08,392 --> 02:07:10,587
Here's news from India.

1758
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:15,462
A claim of developing the
vaccine also came from India

1759
02:07:15,833 --> 02:07:17,357
But the papers couldn't reach here

1760
02:07:18,969 --> 02:07:21,870
Also, neither the scientists,
physicians..

1761
02:07:21,939 --> 02:07:23,031
nor the government of India..

1762
02:07:23,107 --> 02:07:24,335
supported the claim

1763
02:07:32,349 --> 02:07:39,278
Scientific discovery is a race..

1764
02:07:40,557 --> 02:07:41,717
a competition

1765
02:07:45,362 --> 02:07:47,421
Research is going on
all over the world

1766
02:07:48,532 --> 02:07:50,124
Thousands of
scientists are involved.

1767
02:07:53,237 --> 02:07:56,297
There's no time to waste

1768
02:07:58,041 --> 02:08:02,205
All of us destroyed
such an original work

1769
02:09:33,036 --> 02:09:35,004
I had to kill them, Seema

1770
02:09:37,307 --> 02:09:38,831
I had no choice

1771
02:09:41,345 --> 02:09:43,939
They were suffering

1772
02:10:25,789 --> 02:10:30,123
Dipankar, Dr. Emily
Bernard has written to you..

1773
02:10:30,427 --> 02:10:33,624
at my address, so
that it reaches you

1774
02:10:34,998 --> 02:10:37,057
She's also written to me

1775
02:10:37,668 --> 02:10:40,228
She feels sorry for you

1776
02:10:43,106 --> 02:10:45,597
I'll read the letter, listen.

1777
02:10:46,677 --> 02:10:48,577
My dear Dr. Roy.

1778
02:10:48,679 --> 02:10:50,169
A new era has begun

1779
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:51,679
in the field of..

1780
02:10:51,748 --> 02:10:54,546
microbiology and molecular biology

1781
02:10:54,985 --> 02:10:57,180
Even then, we know..

1782
02:11:00,724 --> 02:11:05,661
Rest is as unknown as
the mysteries of space

1783
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:10,526
Many leading
scientists are working on it

1784
02:11:11,001 --> 02:11:18,100
We invite you to
join hands with them

1785
02:11:18,775 --> 02:11:23,735
General Electric has very recently
built a laboratory in Chicago.

1786
02:11:23,847 --> 02:11:28,113
They will be very happy
indeed if you can join them.

1787
02:11:28,552 --> 02:11:32,784
I assure you, you will
face no difficulties there.

1788
02:11:32,889 --> 02:11:34,356
We hope that..

1789
02:11:34,458 --> 02:11:36,153
I very sincerely hope..

1790
02:11:36,526 --> 02:11:37,993
..that like leprosy.

1791
