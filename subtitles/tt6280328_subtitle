1
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,639
My god! Do spirits possess
so much power?

2
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,549
I don't think anyone can stand
them if they are seeking revenge.

3
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,429
Enough! we are roaming around
here at night since 10 years.

4
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,330
Have you seen a single spirit?
There are no such things. Spirits?

5
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:17,211
RAJU GARI GADHI 2
(RESPECTED KING'S ROOM 2)

6
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,599
Hello! Hello!
Can you hear me?

7
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,349
I came in the morning
for land registration.

8
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,599
Not the land? Landrover?
Where is that site?

9
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,889
Uncle, that's not a site.
Its a car.

10
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,349
What are you talking?

11
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,071
You look like the brand
ambassador to black paint.

12
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:43,299
-Why would I even talk to you?
-Give him a big round of applause.

13
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,549
-Hello.
-Sir.

14
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,200
Mr. Raju is waiting in the car
since an hour.

15
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,099
What's the delay with the registration?
Tell me if there's no money.

16
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,759
I will arrange the registration
with someone else.

17
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,481
It's not about the money. The third
friend amongst us hasn't come yet.

18
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:55,389
Yes.

19
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,299
-Where is he?
-There he is.

20
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,383
Why are you late?

21
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:00,549
We are starting a business
for the first time.

22
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,969
I went to the temple and prayed for us
to be together forever.

23
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,290
Super! Come, we are late
for the registration.

24
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,370
<i>"One word! One path! One dream!"</i>

25
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,929
<i>"We will always be together"</i>

26
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:50,429
<i>"We are brothers from different
mothers, We live by the same accord"</i>

27
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:58,700
<i>"What else can we ask God for?
This friendship is a boon to us"</i>

28
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,540
<i>"Beautiful life! Beautiful life!"</i>

29
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,330
Thank you.

30
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,120
<i>"Beautiful life!"</i>

31
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,299
<i>"Every minute is wonderful"</i>

32
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,370
<i>"Beautiful life! Beautiful life..."</i>

33
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,719
<i>"Beautiful life! Beautiful life!"</i>

34
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,299
<i>"Fortune of many lives!"</i>

35
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,969
<i>"Beautiful life! Beautiful life!"</i>

36
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,790
<i>"We dedicate it to friendship"</i>

37
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,830
-What a beauty! What a beauty!
-Correct.

38
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,349
What a booty! What a booty!

39
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,250
Soft and smooth!

40
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,139
Hey! I can't take anymore
of your weird romance. Wake up!

41
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,639
-What are you doing? Get up!
-Sorry sir.

42
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,000
Your wife is like a sister to me.
I was just!

43
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,113
Was that a dream?

44
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,639
You will obviously have dreams
if you sleep for this long.

45
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,929
What are you talking?
This is our resort.

46
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,179
Nobody will object us for sleeping.

47
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,259
If the customer leaves without
the billing, we will be in trouble.

48
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,469
Go and collect the remaining
balance money from room number 8.

49
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,719
Guests and accounts is your department,
Food and alcohol is my department.

50
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,349
I will not interfere in yours business
and you don't interfere in mine.

51
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,549
-Would you touch my feet if I interfere?
-Was that supposed to be a joke?

52
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,549
-Doubt?
-Remind me at night. I will laugh at it.

53
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,469
-Enough.
-Hey! Be serious.

54
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,139
We have to work hard
for the next five years.

55
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,469
And open our branches in Chennai,
Kochi, Mumbai, Dubai, London and Paris.

56
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,609
This is our target.

57
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,889
Before doing all that,
we will open in Bangkok first.

58
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,639
-For what?
-For that.

59
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,420
-Really?
-It's legal there, you know?

60
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,599
Do they have that too?

61
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,799
Girls have license
and boys have workouts.

62
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,540
Superb.

63
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,259
If we have a resort there,

64
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,719
We can offer service to our customers
and enjoy the service in free time. Easy.

65
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,870
Isn't it?

66
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,969
-He will not enjoy and won't let us enjoy.
-Good boy. Leave him here.

67
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,389
-Alright but my body is craving for a girl.
-I too feel the same.

68
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,580
-Let's go.
-Come on.

69
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,349
Here are the vegetables you asked for.

70
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,259
-How much do they cost?
-350 rupees.

71
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,219
These vegetables won't cost so much,
I will give you 350 rupees.

72
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,099
Give.

73
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,580
Money is in my shorts. Take it.

74
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,330
Money means cash.
What are you holding?

75
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,799
The bell rang, I am going for prayers
and will be right back.

76
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,500
-You hold these vegetables.
-Ok.

77
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,450
My dear children, Lord is like a father
to all of us.

78
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,349
He had first created
Adam and Eve.

79
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,219
Dear Church Father, I have a doubt.
Shall I ask?

80
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,099
Go ahead.

81
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,349
There was no one born before
Adam and Eve? isn't that true?

82
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,799
Jesus was born later in a manger.

83
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,219
We happen to celebrate
Christmas since then. Isn't it?

84
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,599
-Dear.
-Father.

85
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,130
Meet me in the room after class.
I will answer it for you specially.

86
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,719
Alright.

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,139
So, everyone in this world
are Adam and Eve's children.

88
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,009
So, every woman is to be
respected like a sister.

89
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,139
-Father.
-Dear.

90
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,053
if every woman is
treated like a sister,

91
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,469
where will new
sisters come from?

92
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,799
-Wouldn't that be the end of the world?
-Dear.

93
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,719
-Will you answer this in the room too?
-Yes, my son.

94
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,540
Not finding an answer to my questions
would be a curse to this world, Father.

95
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,580
Sir, where do you want me
to put the coffee?

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,679
Sir, where do you want me
to put the coffee?

97
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,774
Put it in Kakinada. I
will fly to Rajahmundry,

98
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,639
then take a car to
Kakinada and drink it.

99
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,099
-Isn't that better?
-Alright.

100
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,139
-Hey... Where are you going?
-Didn't you ask me to keep it in Kakinada?

101
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,849
Hey... You really don't
understand humor.

102
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,790
-Come, put that coffee on my face.
-Ok.

103
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,259
Hey... I was just kidding.
Give it to my hands.

104
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,179
-In my hands.
-As you wish.

105
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,700
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

106
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,889
-Did you put jaggery in the coffee?
-Yes. I really like jaggery.

107
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,107
Hey... Use your brains.
Who puts jaggery in coffee?

108
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,580
Sir.

109
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,299
Know that there is a guy like me to stop
anyone from raising his hand on a woman.

110
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,509
-Enough of your heroism.
-Sir, you don't listen to me.

111
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,969
Haven't you seen Ashwin? Look how
he is dancing with those chicks.

112
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,429
-I am watching.
-Keep watching,

113
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,897
If you waste anymore time, you
would have nothing left to squeeze.

114
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:24,120
Shut up.

115
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,889
Nisa darling,

116
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,679
You are provoking me with your dance.

117
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,410
I will have some fun with you today.

118
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,549
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Silly question.

119
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,049
Does anyone run in a swimming pool?
I am swimming, man.

120
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,099
-I have a class going on here.
-So what? Not my problem.

121
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,719
-Hi, Nisa.
-Hi.

122
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,580
Refreshments.

123
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,849
Thanks.

124
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,785
This is for Nimmi...
Smoothie with less sugar.

125
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:55,549
Thank you.

126
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,969
This powerhouse drink is for
the pretty Suhasini.

127
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,799
'Suhanisa'.

128
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,009
-Suha... sona?
-No, No, Suhanisa.

129
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,049
-Whoever it is, you are wonderful.
-Thank you.

130
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,299
What rubbish! How can you compare
apples with oranges?

131
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,349
-Here comes the English dubbing king.
-Doesn't he speak Telugu?

132
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,349
He doesn't speak English too.
That is why he failed in Engineering...

133
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,719
I failed on purpose.

134
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,759
-Who knows?
-Because I quit,

135
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,389
This bloody education system in India.
I quit.

136
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,099
If I studied like them, I would
have ruined my career and vision.

137
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,299
-You don't look like their classmate.
-Hello Aunty.

138
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,549
Put some water on your face and
iron it. Your wrinkles would disappear.

139
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,679
-Everyone says I'm pretty like a doll.
-Do you know that?

140
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,639
You look like a grandma.
Who says you are pretty?

141
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,549
Don't hurt me,
I am still a bachelor.

142
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,250
You look like a mother to ten.
How can I believe you are a bachelor?

143
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,509
So, just remember one thing.

144
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,719
Everybody might be the same before law.

145
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,099
But everybody may not be the same
before biology.

146
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,889
-But zoology is different to Anthropology.
-What a statement!

147
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,969
Hey bold and beautiful,
Don't you want linda goodmen star sign.

148
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,799
-Ofcourse you have it?
-You say it. I have it.

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,889
Let's get out of this shit. Come on.

150
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,950
Bye guys. No,
I can't look at his romantic feats.

151
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,759
I will jump into this juice and die.

152
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,290
-All the best.
-Rest in peace.

153
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,160
Cheers.

154
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,252
What is that?

155
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,929
Spanish fly, World's
second best aphrodisiac.

156
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,330
What does it mean?

157
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,080
A drug to boost the lust in you.

158
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,429
Just a drop of this and you can show
stars to the other person.

159
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,179
-To whom?
-Suhanisa.

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,259
Hey... Nisa is my student.
Don't mess with me with all your crazy.

161
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,509
Go away good boy.

162
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,849
I already got Suhanisa to cancel your
Zumba class and set her for a date with me

163
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,849
Hey... You know that
I like Nisa, right?

164
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,469
-Will my car run with diesel in your car?
-What?

165
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,299
Won't we switch on lights
if there is moonlight in the sky?

166
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,259
It's the same. You love her.
I lust her.

167
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,639
I will see how you will
take Nisa on a date.

168
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,469
Even Kattappa
can't stop this date.

169
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,250
No one can stop me
from dating Nisa.

170
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,540
Smile please.

171
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,790
Show me.

172
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,870
-Click the three of us now.
-Me?

173
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,429
Click. Come.

174
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,302
I'm not worthy to stand
beside a beauty like you.

175
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,299
So sweet.

176
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,219
-Come... let's take a selfie.
-No please.

177
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,330
Is that it?

178
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,120
If you delay any more, that
Spanish fly will land on her.

179
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,660
Smile.

180
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,620
Can I place my hand here?

181
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,250
Happily.

182
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,009
-Is it nice?
-Yes, super.

183
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,370
You are so sweet.

184
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,000
-What is this touch? So soft.
-Is it? I will show you my touch now.

185
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,349
Nisa, Shall we discuss
the book I told you about.

186
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,049
Yes.

187
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,679
Do you believe in Star signs?

188
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,349
They are good for nothing,
how will they know about Star signs?

189
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,620
You are too innocent.
Come on. Let's go to my room.

190
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,830
-Why does your face look so sad?
-Do we look like useless salesman?

191
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,389
-Is that why you are sad?
-Yes.

192
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,179
I thought you are upset
as he took away your girl.

193
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,750
Correct, I should
be upset about her.

194
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,450
Stop it. I hate love stories.

195
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,989
Nice view...

196
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,510
-You like it?
-It's beautiful.

197
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,180
Amazing.

198
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,760
-Here we go.
-Hey.

199
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,760
Thank you.

200
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,840
I like this brand.

201
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,220
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I am okay.

202
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,510
Suhanisa... You know
you are quite special to me.

203
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,359
-You are married, right?
-Who told you?

204
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,649
I googled you.

205
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,689
Damn this google.

206
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,970
You know Google is not actually
spelled 'Google'.

207
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,779
Minton Sarota called it so.

208
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,189
He is the nephew of...
Tell me bro.

209
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,996
Are you married or not?

210
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,649
I am divorced too.
Didn't Google tell you that?

211
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,069
Why?

212
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,189
You know, Full mental torture,
Psychological abuse.

213
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,439
It's like acupuncture.
Very painful, you know.

214
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,819
No happiness at all.
If you look into the past,

215
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,140
Nisa, I am talking about my past.
if you look into my life.

216
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,899
I wouldn't even call it a marriage.

217
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,609
-I am sorry.
-Don't be.

218
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,470
I don't want you to show me sympathy,
cutie pie. I want a hug.

219
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,890
I want a shoulder.

220
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,680
Are you okay?

221
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,939
Selfie trick would be better.

222
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,649
Nisa, shall I click a photo of you?

223
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,970
-Ofcourse... Shall I pose?
-Absolutely.

224
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,609
By the way, look straight
into the lens. Okay?

225
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,050
-Photo should be amazing.
-You will be shocked.

226
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,510
Ready?

227
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,239
-What happened?
-Lens should be clean.

228
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,590
-Clarity is important.
-Yes.

229
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,840
Ready? Pose.

230
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,430
Any problem?

231
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,970
Lens needs to be cleaned.
Clarity is important.

232
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,050
Maybe this side is better.

233
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,470
-Come on, baby. Let's take a selfie.
-Selfie?

234
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,399
I hate selfies.

235
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,029
Hey... Let's take a selfie.

236
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,279
Selfies are injurious to health, ma'am.
Many die because of it, you know.

237
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,970
Hey cutie pie, One selfie,
Please...

238
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,939
Nice...

239
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,220
Where are you?

240
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,050
-Have some alcohol.
-Nothing goes in now, ma'am.

241
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,819
With your permission,
can I call my mom?

242
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,819
You can call later. Have this first.

243
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,050
-I miss mommy a lot, ma'am.
-Drink this first. Have it.

244
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,649
Hey... Ghost... There is a ghost
in our resort.

245
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,359
What happened?

246
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,689
-Did Nisa leave?
-Fool, That's not Nisa. It's a ghost.

247
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,319
An aghora in the form of a girl...

248
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,430
-Aghora?
-I will show you. Come.

249
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,300
-She looks fine.
-Click a photo. You will know.

250
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,260
See.

251
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,300
Look, you can't see the head, right?

252
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,319
What happened to you? Why are
you talking crap? Look properly.

253
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,899
-You can see her.
-No. It's true.

254
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,003
When I clicked earlier,
I couldn't see her.

255
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:52,220
So, nothing happened
between you two.

256
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,050
One minute.

257
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,529
Did you dance?

258
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,029
-I made dosas. Come and eat.
-This isn't the time for your sarcasm.

259
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,029
She is a ghost. She drank
a full bottle earlier...

260
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,793
Why would there be any
ghosts in our resort?

261
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:11,399
Come on... Let's
take Nisa to her room.

262
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,609
No, No, I will take care of Nisa.
You guys do your work. Nisa...

263
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,149
-Nisa!
-Your fate!

264
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,989
Romance with a ghost?
You will be dead.

265
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,109
Hey... there is no ghost.
Don't be scared. Let's go.

266
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,859
<i>"Nisa... I lay my hand
on your cheeks."</i>

267
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,010
You are so soft.

268
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,390
I can see her well now.
What happened yesterday?

269
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,279
-Hi.
-I was just thinking of you.

270
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,939
-Why?
-I typed 'Rascal' in Google.

271
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,090
-What popped up?
-Your picture.

272
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,239
Stop mocking and listen to me.

273
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,529
There is some mystery around Nisa.
How did she know I was married?

274
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,930
-I told her that.
-You?

275
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,949
Why did you do that?

276
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,789
Because a married guy
wouldn't have much demand.

277
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,109
Wouldn't we buy an iPhone 8
because we have iPhone 7?

278
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,180
Even I know this stupid comparison.
Close your exit door.

279
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,800
I have to test Nisa again.

280
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,930
Super, Nisa. You did a great job.

281
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,260
Hey... Ghost is coming.
It's a ghost.

282
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,319
What happened to him?
Why is he behaving so weird.

283
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,609
Nothing. He thinks
you are a ghost. Ghost?

284
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,819
My God.

285
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,689
-You know I went on a date with him.
-Sheep always believes the slaughter man.

286
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,430
-I have to teach him a lesson.
-What will you do?

287
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,340
Do you want to date me?

288
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,859
-What?
-Will you go on date with me?

289
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,140
Music.

290
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,859
Hello... Say yes or no.

291
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,430
-You have all the rights on me.
-I will show you what I am.

292
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,569
Hey Praveen, it's a dream.
Let's go to the resort.

293
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,189
-Wake up, dreamer.
-Hey!

294
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,989
Are you senseless?
Why are you provoking me?

295
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,819
What does that mean?

296
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,689
Nisa is in a bikini, calling me.

297
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,069
You obstructed me with
a coconut in your hand.

298
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,739
While he interferes in reality
and you interfere in my dreams,

299
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,939
When will I date Nisa
and build a house.

300
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,939
-Hey.
-Yes?

301
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,819
Though I am upset I couldn't have Nisa,
I am happy that she recognized you.

302
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,529
-Really?
-I swear.

303
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,689
Superb timing.

304
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,090
It must be your Nisa darling. We
wouldn't disturb you, Bye, Good night.

305
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,590
-It's Nisa.
-Really? Talk. Talk.

306
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,180
Hi, Nisa darling. Why did you call
at this hour?

307
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,819
Hello, Hello, She isn't talking.

308
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,109
You keep talking.

309
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,430
-I will check on her. ok?
-Yes, go.

310
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,859
Nisa darling, why are you quiet?

311
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,680
Our date is tomorrow
remember? Nisa...

312
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,640
Phone is off.
Nisa is asleep.

313
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,800
Who is speaking with him
on the phone?

314
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,939
Which cream makes your
body so soft? Tell me, baby.

315
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,050
Talk dear.

316
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,090
-Stop it. It's not real.
-Hey, Don't disturb me.

317
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,899
Tell me which cream.

318
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,689
-Shall I apply it on you?
-What will you apply?

319
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,989
Can't you understand what I am saying?
It's not real.

320
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,260
Wait.

321
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,470
Not you, baby.

322
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,260
-Express me your love through a song.
-Hey, Hey.

323
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,590
She will sing,
"Would he be six feet?"

324
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,069
Listen.

325
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,609
<i>"I am the shadow that follows"</i>

326
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,649
Didn't I tell you? I have been
telling you. It's not real. Hang up.

327
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,050
-Hang up immediately.
-I can't cut the call.

328
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,590
Hey... Come on. Let's go.

329
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,090
Please come.

330
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,430
You die here.

331
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,220
'Abracadabra'.

332
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,800
You can't hear anything else
except my voice.

333
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,510
Take a deep breath.

334
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,800
Exhale now.

335
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,399
Where are you inhaling
and exhaling from?

336
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,689
Look... You asked me to inhale. I did.
And then said exhale. I did that too.

337
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,640
You should specifcally tell me
from where to let it out.

338
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,609
Hey... I am fire.

339
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,109
That's something else.

340
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,739
Answer us without getting annoyed.

341
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,399
-What are the questions?
-Before we bought this resort.

342
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,470
Since Mr. Raju built the resort,
have there been any shocking incidents?

343
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,300
-What do you mean?
-I mean, any suicide or murder?

344
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,649
What are you talking, sir?

345
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,529
If there was any suicide or murder,
it would've appeared in the newspapers.

346
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,640
Go, sir. There are no ghosts here.

347
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,859
What happened, son?

348
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,550
As Mr. Nagarjuna suggested,
I shopped at Kalyan Jewelers.

349
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,840
As Mr. Venkatesh suggested,
she put them in Manappuram father.

350
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,319
My head is exploding for
marrying a crazy girl.

351
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,840
As NTR suggested, apply oil
to your scalp. It will be cool.

352
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,510
Come... Apply oil to me.

353
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,602
Stop crying.

354
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:19,590
Father, Father, Sit
down for two minutes.

355
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,109
-Why did you guys come here?
-Are ghosts for real, Father?

356
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,140
-Yes.
-Have you seen them?

357
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,939
-Is there air here?
-Yes father.

358
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,800
-Show me.
-Here.

359
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,319
No, Father.

360
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,859
When we agree there's air
that we can't see.

361
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,489
And believe there is God
that we can't witness,

362
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,029
Why don't you believe there are ghosts?

363
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,989
when there is too much air,
we switch off the fan.

364
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,319
-How do we stop the ghosts?
-How do we stop them, Father?

365
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,550
We can't stop them.

366
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,050
But the Lord can. This cross,
where he resides, can stop them.

367
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,029
What actually happened, son?

368
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,859
Father, there is a ghost in the resort.
We are really scared.

369
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,149
Take me there for purification.

370
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,899
Put it on my head as a sample
and purify me, Father.

371
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,439
I didn't even bathe out of fear.

372
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,252
You think this is like a test
drive before buying a car?

373
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:06,590
Please, father.

374
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,430
-Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

375
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,649
First listen to us, Ashwin.

376
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,890
If you repeat this,
I will forget you are my friends.

377
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,550
I worked hard, fought at home
and invested money on this resort.

378
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,189
If we spread the news about a ghost,
who will come to us?

379
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,609
-Damn!
-Sorry.

380
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,590
We didn't think that far.

381
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,470
Alright.

382
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,220
Don't tell anyone about this.

383
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,760
There is no ghost here.

384
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,590
We won't say it out loud but there
is really a ghost in this resort.

385
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,189
Damn!

386
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,349
I am also here.
How come I don't see a ghost?

387
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,350
Why can't I see it.

388
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,180
-Actually...
-Ashwin.

389
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,140
That's Ashwin.

390
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,800
Ashwin.

391
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,239
Ashwin.

392
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,140
Ashwin.

393
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,760
-No...
-Ashwin.

394
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,300
-Hey Ashwin.
-Where did you go?

395
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,430
-Talk... We are scared.
-Hey Ashwin.

396
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,939
Please stay with me... Ashwin.

397
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,220
You said there's no ghost.
Look what happened now.

398
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,510
-Don't go there.
-I will be fine.

399
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,470
Ashwin.

400
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,720
Hey Praveen.

401
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,930
What happened to him?

402
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,140
-Dad called me in the morning.
-What did he say?

403
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,609
He said business doesn't suit me.

404
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,680
He wants me to sell my share
of the resort and return home.

405
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,609
That's true. Rather than
the ghost beating us up here,

406
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,220
I would let our family do that.
What do you say?

407
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,890
I can't believe you guys.

408
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,640
I trusted you both, fought with my dad
and invested money on this resort.

409
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,430
You guys want to sell your share
and go home.

410
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,300
My dad asked me not to come home,
If my business fails.

411
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,800
To be precise, he kicked me
out of the house.

412
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,569
Parents support us until
we grow up.

413
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,640
Friends are our strength later.

414
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,510
If you guys also leave me,
how do I live?

415
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,649
This scene shouldn't have
any more sentiment. Take this.

416
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,779
What's this?

417
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,439
-Cassata
-Where did you get it?

418
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,800
From our kitchen.

419
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,300
It's been so long since we bought it.
That's why I gave you guys.

420
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,970
One minute.

421
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,180
Hello.

422
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,569
Bala.

423
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,189
I'll meet you guys later.

424
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,260
-I will freshen up and call you.
-It smells like a dead rat. Yucks!

425
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,939
-Hi, baby.
-Hi, Bala.

426
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,149
How is your business going?
I think you forgot me.

427
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,779
-I forgot you?
-No chance.

428
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,529
I can only see your face.
Why don't you sit behind?

429
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,439
-I want to see the whole of you.
-What, Ashu?

430
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,779
-Why do you always ask me to move back?
-Please move.

431
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,260
Ok.

432
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,470
Why am I sweating all of a sudden?

433
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,899
What are you looking at?
You too...

434
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,739
-No, Ashu.
-Do it for me. Please.

435
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,739
-No.
-Just on the phone. Please.

436
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,529
-There won't be any problem, right?
-No. It's just the two of us.

437
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,840
Alright.

438
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,800
Hey, What happened?

439
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,430
Nothing.

440
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,649
You open it.

441
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,640
Want to see everything now?
Boy is in a hurry.

442
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,899
-I can't see anything.
-What?

443
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,899
I removed everything.
Didn't you see?

444
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,859
-Really? Did you remove everything?
-Yes.

445
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,390
It might be a network problem.

446
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,779
-I am tensed, Ashu.
-Don't be tensed. I am right here.

447
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,029
-Ok. Can you see me now?
-No.

448
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,140
I might have woken up seeing
those idiots in the morning.

449
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,899
I think they are here.
I will call you back.

450
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,340
Ok, bye.

451
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,569
Father, this incident
shouldn't come out at any cost.

452
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,029
If it is leaked, our business will be
in huge loss.

453
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,140
We would have to beg.

454
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,279
-Stand properly, dumbo.
-Who are you calling 'dumbo'?

455
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,470
-Yesu here... Bala yesu.
-Shut up.

456
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,640
Is this the mirror
you were talking about?

457
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,989
'Praise the Lord in
the name of almighty'.

458
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,090
'Praise the Lord in the
name of Jesus Christ'.

459
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,359
Watch... It will come out now.

460
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,739
What will come out?

461
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,819
It's just the scent you sprinkled.

462
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,590
Hey... I am pleading you.
I am scared, man.

463
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,439
Praise the Lord
in the name of God,

464
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,239
In the name of almighty,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

465
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,640
In the name of supreme power.

466
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,569
In the name of God, in the name of
lord, in the name of the holy spirit,

467
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,114
in the name of almighty,

468
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:20,189
-This place is...
-Stop it.

469
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,149
I am listening to your
prayers since then.

470
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,819
Remove your hand. You look huge.
Why are you scared?

471
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,819
Why are you making
noises from inside?

472
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,239
You think you can scare me
with your noises?

473
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,489
Yesu... Balayesu... will rip your
skin off and stitch garments with it.

474
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,760
Stop it.

475
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,859
Look the noise has stopped. You shouldn't
plead when someone is scaring you.

476
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,609
Hey, giant...
I'm talking to you.

477
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,800
Where's the ghost?
Why doesn't it come out?

478
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,779
Brother,

479
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,550
Ashwin bro.

480
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,470
Everyone left me here alone.

481
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,550
Lord, save me... Father...

482
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,340
Where are you going, Father?

483
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
I haven't thought of it, son.

484
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,140
Save me, Father.

485
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,090
Son,

486
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,220
You messed it up.

487
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,220
You better deal with it.

488
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,300
Don't involve me.

489
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,149
This is not fair.

490
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,050
Ours is a very long bond,
A strong relationship...

491
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,720
Is this the time to talk about bonds
and relations? Let me go. Please.

492
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,859
I might die, Father.

493
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,899
I am frightened.
Pray, Father...

494
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,140
-You didn't want it earlier.
-I'm asking you to do it now.

495
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:57,720
-Run away.
-You messed it up.

496
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,569
Damn! What's happening in the resort?

497
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,989
What is it happening for?
This egomaniac,

498
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,720
Informic, oblique...

499
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,109
Is English necessary now?

500
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,149
-Did you just slap me?
-No. I gave you a French kiss.

501
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,439
-If you speak broken English again...
-How can you escape from the...

502
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,239
-There you go again.
-Good morning, sons.

503
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,899
-Good morning, Father.
-It's good days for your resort.

504
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,609
-Really, Father?
-Be ready tomorrow morning.

505
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,779
-We will be going to a place.
-Where to, Father?

506
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,569
To meet a person who can solve
your resort mystery.

507
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,819
Who is he, Father?

508
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,689
Since our ancestors...

509
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,890
One from the dynasty reputed for the
worship of Naga, Durga and Hanuman.

510
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,140
He is Rudra.

511
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,550
Why did you bring us here, Father?
I don't think this will work out.

512
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,010
May you live long!

513
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:20,090
You make me feel blissful, Rudra.

514
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,029
Being one of the most reputed
mentalists in the world.

515
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,899
And a strong believer of science,

516
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,050
you are still following
our culture and customs,

517
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,609
which is a great thing.

518
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,279
Master, science knows little.
There is a lot more.

519
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,890
So, no matter how updated I am,

520
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,800
I still follow our traditions.

521
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,260
-Someone is here for you.
-Father has come?

522
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,590
What's up Father.

523
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,180
Is everything working out well?

524
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,819
You think he heard us?

525
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,739
He is a mentalist.

526
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,529
He can look into our eyes
and say what's in the heart.

527
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,890
He is one among the top five.

528
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,430
How is it possible, Father?

529
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,140
Give me your phone.

530
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,510
Look into my eyes.

531
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,140
Just look like a normal human.

532
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,300
Think of your password.

533
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,550
Repeat it again and again.

534
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,510
-Nice wallpaper.
-What?

535
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,550
He unlocked my phone.

536
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,689
-Rudra.
-Yes.

537
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,359
What about the resort problem?

538
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,090
There is no problem without
a solution, Father.

539
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,439
I will definitely come.

540
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,340
Commissioner is on the phone, sir.

541
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,760
What's the case?

542
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,239
10 days back, in NGO's colony,
a lady by name Varalakshmi was dead.

543
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,279
She has no one.
Postmortem says it's a brain stroke.

544
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,930
It says a piece of apple was stuck in her
throat, depriving her of oxygen supply.

545
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,770
But as her neighbors
suggested her death

546
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:26,859
to be unnatural, I
am dealing the case.

547
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,180
Suspecting the maids,
we have them under custody.

548
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,650
Where is he?

549
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,839
Does anyone lie during
the holy Swami observation?

550
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,339
I am in no way related to her death.
She asked me to get milk.

551
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,839
She was dead by the time I returned.

552
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,219
He is repeating the same
since 10 days, Rudra.

553
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,469
Is he saying it this way
or saying the same thing?

554
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,509
He is repeating it almost word by word.

555
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,490
Then he is lying.

556
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,410
You are hiding the truth.

557
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,483
Commissioner, a person
who's not guilty will be

558
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:08,929
frustrated upon asking
the same thing repeatedly.

559
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,929
He starts to fumble.

560
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:17,179
But the guilty guy
will practice to not get caught.

561
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,870
You didn't do it, right?

562
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,700
-You didn't do it, right?
-No, no.

563
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,200
Have some water.

564
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,509
I'm telling you the truth,
I swear.

565
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,700
What was the time
when you returned that day?

566
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,469
It must be 1'o clock. I also heard
prayers from the mosque nearby.

567
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:49,120
-Commissioner, when was she dead?
-As per the reports, at 12:50.

568
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,910
-Where did you get the milk from?
-From a shop at the end of the lane.

569
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,540
How many times did you practice
to lie about the same thing.

570
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,160
Yes.

571
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,389
-You are lying for sure.
-No, sir. I am telling you the truth.

572
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,299
Trust me.

573
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,450
Your tongue might lie
but your eyes do not.

574
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,339
According to Neuron psychology,
there are two portions in the brain.

575
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,299
Visual cortex to the left
and creative cortex to the right.

576
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,262
For example, if I ask
about your favorite place,

577
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,139
your eyes automatically
roll to the left.

578
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,790
Your favorite place is recorded there
as a visual, which is real.

579
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,870
So, you are saying the truth.

580
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,790
But if I ask you what you would do
on becoming the PM,

581
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,700
Your eyes would roll to the right.

582
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,040
Which means, you are accessing
the creative side of the brain.

583
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,540
That's not real.
That's an imagination or a lie.

584
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,120
You don't have to imagine
if it really happened.

585
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,330
If you did imagine, it's not true.

586
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,040
For both the questions I asked,
you looked to your right.

587
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,240
So, you were lying.

588
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,370
What's the truth, Rudra?

589
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,910
Where did the murder take place?

590
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,299
Single property with 45 acres...

591
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,639
Four crores per acre,
which is 180 crores.

592
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,799
You will die soon.
You have no kids too.

593
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,200
-What will you do with the property.
-Who are you to question about my property?

594
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,740
-God of Death.
-Sathi call the cops.

595
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,219
You are also one of them.

596
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,639
I thought of giving you
five acers of land.

597
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,200
You would have got five acres.

598
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,839
But now, you have to roam around
police stations and courts.

599
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,950
What five acres?

600
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,290
He didn't murder her
but he assisted.

601
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,889
He tried to hide the truth.

602
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,009
As you would notice the fingerprints
on the property documents,

603
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,120
He erased the ink on his finger
with hydrogen peroxide.

604
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,839
Four people came.
Five including him.

605
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,469
They drank coffee in the joy
of gaining wealth,

606
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:34,200
Their fingerprints are on the cups
in the kitchen.

607
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,160
To trace the fingerprints,

608
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,910
Check who has registered her property
since her death.

609
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,370
There is already a real estate
venture board in those 45 acres.

610
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,450
Brilliant, Rudra. This information
is enough to close the case.

611
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,160
The holy observation is for correcting
our mistakes.

612
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,990
But not to hide your mistakes.

613
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,700
-Who is he, sir?
-He is a modern saint.

614
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,839
There are very few mentalists
like Rudra in the world.

615
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,389
They approached him to solve murder
cases in America, Russia and Australia.

616
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,509
Like mind reading, influencing,
hypnotism and body language.

617
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,589
Mentalist is a combination
of many psychological theories.

618
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,799
Is this a new kind of science?

619
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,139
We can't say it's completely
science or not.

620
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,179
-It's a phenomenon.
-Phenomenon?

621
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,700
-Is she Nitya Menon's cousin?
-Hey.

622
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,870
Sunny aunty's new video is out.

623
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,299
Why are we discussing it?

624
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,389
Hey good boy...
Look at your laptop.

625
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,339
-Hey.
-Shut up.

626
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,589
-Go connect TV to Bluetooth.
-I'll do it right away.

627
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,240
You guys will never change.

628
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,370
-Switch off that lights.
-Ok.

629
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,009
-Loading... Loading... Loading...
-Loading... Loading...

630
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,509
-Good boy say it.
-Say it.

631
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,549
Loading... Loading... Loading...

632
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,580
-Loading... Loading...
-90 percent.

633
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,339
-Why are we seen?
-Yes. It's us.

634
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,660
Switch off that TV first.

635
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,719
Do it.

636
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,910
-It's not happening.
-Give me.

637
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,799
-You got a voice message.
-Who would message you so late?

638
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,200
Open it.

639
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,589
Hey... We are not on the bed.

640
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,540
Yes.

641
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,910
No! Let's have a look.

642
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,799
Sir, it's not an ordinary ghost.

643
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,219
It is quite wild.
She is driving us crazy,

644
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,219
We slept in the church out of fear.

645
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,450
Please help us get rid of this ghost.

646
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:29,660
First thing that you should know is,
a human's fear is a ghost's strength.

647
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,719
The strength we have in humans,

648
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,370
is 10 percent after becoming a ghost.

649
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,299
I don't know the truth.
But It sounds great, sir.

650
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,049
It's encouraging, I like it.

651
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,429
-What do you think?
-Encouraging?

652
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,910
It's discouraging for me as my bladder
is going to explode. No out going.

653
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,759
Sir, I'm really sacred.

654
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,410
Half of our fears come
from not knowing the truth.

655
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,330
In fact,

656
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,389
I am using the word 'ghost'
so that you will understand.

657
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,639
According to me,
it's an invisible energy.

658
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,540
-Energy?
-Yes.

659
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,790
The thoughts left after a human's death
is the 'Invisible Energy'.

660
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,740
-Seems like a network problem.
-Wait.

661
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,700
-Sir...
-Don't do it.

662
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,950
It's here.

663
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,910
It's right here.

664
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,790
Ghost?

665
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,910
Yes.

666
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,580
Who are you?

667
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,790
Why are you here?

668
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,660
Speak out.

669
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,009
Are you scared to
come infront of me?

670
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,009
How long will you hide
and scare people?

671
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,200
Come, stand in front of me.

672
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,719
Sir, is it necessary
to call madam now?

673
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,839
I am already shivering with fear.

674
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,870
You need not fear. It doesn't
have the power to attack us.

675
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,080
Sir?

676
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,490
What happened sir?

677
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,910
Sir.

678
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,660
Please speak out sir.

679
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:48,759
She got into you, Is she
more powerful than you?

680
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,790
Who is that ghost, sir?

681
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,410
A girl.

682
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,040
A girl's spirit.

683
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,889
That spirit is with revenge.

684
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,950
It seeks vengeance.

685
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,290
Against whom?

686
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:04,910
Who is she?

687
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,200
What's her story?

688
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,340
We don't understand
our situation, sir.

689
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,970
We fought with our parents
to invest on this resort.

690
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,890
I stopped them from selling it.

691
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:54,529
We wouldn't even get half the price
if we sell now.

692
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,760
We don't know what to do.

693
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,649
For solving your problem
and the mystery in this resort,

694
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,779
All you have to do is
introduce me to Suhanisa.

695
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,300
Even he wants Suhanisa?

696
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,760
Calm down.

697
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,189
Let's do some magic, ok?

698
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,840
I will touch Praveen on the cheeks.

699
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,720
But Siri will feel my touch.

700
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,800
-Are you ready, Siri?
-Yes. I am ready.

701
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,430
-Did you feel it?
-No.

702
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,550
Close your eyes.

703
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,609
-Did you feel it hard?
-Yes.

704
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,430
-You shouldn't have lied then.
-I'm sorry.

705
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,069
-What happened?
-He beats you, she feels it.

706
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,189
-Crazy experiment, man.
-You mean, 'Interstellar'?

707
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,930
'Gravity' man.

708
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,430
How did Siri feel it
when you hit Praveen.

709
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,010
We all know twins
feel each other's pain.

710
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,989
All of us also have such connection.

711
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:29,859
But how do you know Siri
and Praveen are connected?

712
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,550
It's magic.

713
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,109
-Coffee?
-You tell me,

714
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,970
Will I have coffee with you or not?

715
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,890
Look into my eyes.

716
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,590
Yes, You are ready for hot coffee.

717
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:57,069
Let's all become mentalists.
We will be left as bachelors otherwise.

718
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:01,470
-What do you mean by that?
-I don't know, just said it in flow.

719
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,180
Hey.

720
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:18,180
There is something special about you.
Something in those eyes...

721
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,090
Let's take a picture?

722
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,510
No.

723
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,279
-Later.
-Now.

724
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,689
-Later.
-Right now.

725
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,050
-No.
-Go sit there.

726
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,180
Nisa, there's an expression
called 'smile' in life.

727
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,300
Familiar with it?

728
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,260
Nice.

729
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,689
Why aren't they here yet?

730
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,340
-They are coming.
-They are here.

731
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,859
-I'll see you again.
-Sure.

732
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,840
Touching again...

733
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,340
-Bye.
-Bye.

734
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,180
-What happened inside, sir?
-Did you find out about the ghost?

735
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,800
Yes. Suhanisa is not the ghost.

736
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,390
Then, who is the ghost sir?

737
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,680
Wait and see.

738
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,939
Fool! Why do you yell for everything?

739
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,029
It's you? What's that powder
on your face?

740
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,439
-New technique to avoid ghosts.
-Technique?

741
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,779
-How do ghosts look?
-Pale...

742
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,609
If we too look pale, they think of us
as fellow ghosts and ignore.

743
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,720
That is why I wore gloves
and applied powder on my face.

744
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,180
-Idea is brilliant.
-Powder is there.

745
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,529
Enough of your chuckling...
It's ghosts time, Let's go sleep.

746
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,359
If we sleep when they are roaming,
they might notice we aren't ghosts.

747
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,899
-That is why we applied powder.
-Yes, right.

748
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,970
Come.

749
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,010
Nothing.

750
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:24,640
Who are you, sister?

751
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,800
You said she wouldn't recognize us
with the powder.

752
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,489
Actually, it was his idea, madam.

753
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:36,140
-I just executed it.
-Idiot... You blame me for everything.

754
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,399
Sister, it was not even my idea.

755
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,300
It was Yesu's idea.

756
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,069
Thank god! She left.

757
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,090
Sleep now.

758
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,340
Even with so much tension,
I feel Suhanisa is beside me.

759
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,399
-It's not Suhanisa.
-Then?

760
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,470
It's the ghost in Suhanisa's body.

761
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,300
No matter how many times you
disturb me, I will keep drawing.

762
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,890
Who are you?

763
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,390
You are afraid to show your face.
You must have made some mistake.

764
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,220
I wanted to help you as you are a girl
and you are attacking me.

765
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:10,510
I don't care who you are.
Why should I bother?

766
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,050
Go to hell.

767
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,510
Can I turn?

768
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:10,470
Why did you want to meet
so early, Rudra?

769
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:15,140
Ashwin, Kishore, Ravi.

770
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,899
Your opinion about them?

771
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,989
I didn't know them earlier,

772
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,010
But I've been watching them
since they bought resort.

773
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,050
I can say they behave like boys
but are not bad people.

774
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,550
-Do you know that girl?
-No sir.

775
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,819
Tell me the truth.

776
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,090
You would know from our eyes
if we were lying, sir.

777
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,359
Do you have an affair with anyone
other than your wife?

778
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,819
Sir, there's nothing between
my wife and me.

779
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,510
My happy ending is still pending.

780
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,359
-What about you?
-I have nothing to do with his wife, sir.

781
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,840
-Hey.
-It's true.

782
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:01,029
-Weren't you a professional hacker earlier?
-Yes, sir.

783
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,029
I was working in the cyber
security wing for a major company.

784
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:07,439
-You said you had a girlfriend.
-Yes sir, Her name is Bala.

785
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,399
But I never met her directly.
We talk on Skype.

786
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,489
I am still a virgin.
You can check if you wish.

787
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,899
What will they check?

788
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,760
Checking?

789
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,430
Hey morons.

790
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,239
What does morons mean?

791
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,640
Do you know why the ghost is scaring
only you three in this resort?

792
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:34,069
Three of you had bad thoughts
about girls at some point of time.

793
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:38,800
It might be Nisa, Bala or Sunny Leone.

794
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,260
Stop it now atleast.

795
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,800
-What does morons mean?
-Fools.

796
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,220
Basically, it's a word originated
from Greek. Greek country...

797
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,149
I shouldn't teach English
to barbarians like you.

798
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,529
-Talk about Greek... I can't, man.
-Correct.

799
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,149
You should know Greek
for teaching us.

800
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:08,140
Get lost, moron.

801
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,899
-Why is the door open?
-What are you doing here, chaps?

802
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,510
Say that again and you are dead.

803
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,689
You eat those first.

804
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:20,329
I asked you not
to come here drunk.

805
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:22,239
Are you Supreme Court
judge to tell me?

806
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,609
You look like a cornhusk
doll clicking selfies.

807
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,189
-Talk more and I will stab you.
-Stab me?

808
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:31,180
-Spices would be better.
-You are waking up the animal in me.

809
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:34,840
A pig can't do much
after waking up.

810
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,489
-I will look for the right time and kill him.
-Hey!

811
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,439
-There's no time, my friend. War or surrender?
-Shut up.

812
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,819
These dialogues won't make you a hero.
So much attitude?

813
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:45,069
Attitude is in my body
and heroism is in my house.

814
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,939
Sugars are in peppermint.
Let's fight.

815
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,340
-Then Waiting...
-Waiting for what?

816
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,890
Hey... You said waiting...

817
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:07,649
I believe that you didn't do
anything wrong.

818
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:11,340
You doubt that I might do
something wrong.

819
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,489
Belief and suspicion
can't exist together.

820
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,090
That is why I am erasing
you from my thoughts.

821
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,890
Nice not to have
met you. Goodbye.

822
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,390
I am...

823
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,550
Amrutha.

824
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,680
Who?

825
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:39,260
Why?

826
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:44,720
What did they gain?

827
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,069
-Dad.
-Yes dear...

828
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:22,430
Why is everyone greeting you?
Is it because you are the Head Master?

829
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,739
Respect doesn't come
from some post.

830
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:29,180
But from our behavior and morals.

831
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,939
'Though revenge is
sought from the enemy'.

832
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,239
'Though revenge is
sought from the enemy'.

833
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,319
'Do no harm once he surrenders'.

834
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,069
'Do no harm once he surrenders'.

835
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:49,989
'Be kind and let him go'.

836
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,069
'Be kind and let him go'.

837
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:57,649
-What's your ambition in life?
-I'll become an engineer, Master.

838
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,779
I'll become a doctor, Master.

839
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,239
Amrutha, what about you?

840
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,319
-I'll become a lawyer, Master.
-Why?

841
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,689
I will make him stand in court

842
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:14,050
what mistake have I done to take my
mom away from me at such a young age.

843
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,649
No father...

844
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:59,859
Baby girl, today is Bhogi festival.
You should take a head bath.

845
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:03,359
-I will do, dad.
-You are a kid.

846
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,029
You might get the
liquid into your eyes.

847
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:10,489
-I'm a grown up now.
-I will not undress infront of you.

848
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,279
I am shy.

849
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,989
Why are you so stubborn?

850
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:18,430
How do kids grow up
without the father looking at them?

851
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,859
What's the meaning of the poem
you said in the school?

852
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,649
'Though revenge is sought
from the enemy'.

853
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:40,149
'Do no harm once he surrenders'.

854
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:44,800
It will reflect your
greatness, goodness.

855
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,649
Why do you like the
basil plant so much?

856
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,439
I don't know, dad.

857
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,180
But when I am with it,
Feels like I am with mom.

858
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,050
I will light it,
I will light it.

859
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,029
Don't be sad that mom
isn't beside you, dad.

860
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,890
Your baby girl is right here
to take care of you.

861
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,430
Master is here.

862
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:05,590
It's you, sister...

863
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,140
-What are you guys doing?
-We are studying well, sister.

864
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,069
One of you, Recite a rhyme
to me then.

865
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,720
I will say it, sister.

866
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:24,930
The same old Telugu poems again.

867
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:28,739
I will teach you a new
English rhyme today.

868
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,109
Ok, sister.

869
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:36,220
<i>"A for Apple, B for Bat"</i>

870
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,590
-Dad, Dad, Dad
-What are you doing?

871
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:47,032
You said no to Telugu
poems and teaching

872
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,359
them English rhymes in my house?

873
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,470
Do sit ups. Do it.

874
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,529
What's wrong in teaching
English rhymes, dad?

875
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,899
Nothing wrong in learning English,
Ignoring Telugu is a mistake.

876
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:07,689
The melody in Telugu cannot be found
in English rhymes.

877
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:09,851
That is why there's
a saying, 'Telugu

878
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:12,640
is the best among the
national languages'.

879
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:32,010
Next is Amrutha.

880
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,109
She is the most brilliant student
of our university.

881
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,649
She will reach the highest point
in this profession.

882
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,649
Nice to know about you.

883
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:51,819
So tell me... you have got a civil,
a criminal and a money laundering case.

884
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,840
How would you deal
with each one of them?

885
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:00,267
Your honor, it is my
finding that any case

886
01:20:00,268 --> 01:20:02,800
can be solved with
just three questions.

887
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:06,680
Who? Why? What did they gain?

888
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,149
Who? Why? What did they gain?

889
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:17,319
For not repeating yesterday's mistake,
it has to be stopped this moment.

890
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,800
Only lawyers can make it possible.

891
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,310
-See you. Happy journey, Nisa.
-Thank you.

892
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,369
Nisa, I miss you.

893
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:11,579
Baby, I am just going to Mumbai.
You can come whenever you feel like.

894
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,869
Give me one second.

895
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,739
We won't get a seat
on the flight right now.

896
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,100
It's alright. I will stand.

897
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,020
So sweet!

898
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,270
What about me?

899
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:26,060
Will you believe that
I am not the ghost?

900
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:29,940
Stop using that Spanish fly first.
Let's think about it.

901
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,440
-Bye guys.
-Bye Nisa.

902
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:35,239
Hey, Who told her about
the Spanish fly?

903
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,079
I told her.

904
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,119
Sufferings are personal. Let me suffer.
Why do you interfere?

905
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,079
Suffer then.
Come on.

906
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,449
-Bye.
-Bye Nisa.

907
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,489
Learn to act according
to the situation.

908
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:46,119
You are always annoyed at me.

909
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,869
What else do you expect?

910
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,810
Why do I even care?

911
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,640
Hey, Why is our door open?

912
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,480
Sir, what are you doing here?

913
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,060
-It happened here.
-What happened?

914
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,060
It happened here.

915
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,600
-This is our bathroom.
-She was treated unfairly right here.

916
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:32,390
That is why she is looking here
for answers.

917
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,489
-Is she here now?
-Who is that girl, sir?

918
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,640
She is Amrutha.

919
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:47,440
Topper of India's finest law college.

920
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:51,789
When she came here last year
for a college trip with friends,

921
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,600
This incident happened here.

922
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:58,310
She committed suicide four days
after that incident.

923
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,390
This is too much, sir. Does she have to
commit suicide for such petty things?

924
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,690
Correct.

925
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:09,980
It is petty for someone who watch
porn on the Internet like you.

926
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:15,350
But it's a huge deal for a girl
raised by her father alone.

927
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,140
Everyone saw it anyways,
Why don't you show me in private?

928
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:19,869
You don't know how the family is
mentally affected with such incidents.

929
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:25,190
You don't know the pain they feel when
the society frames them to be guilty.

930
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:29,230
Look at her skin, man.

931
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:35,060
-It is so smooth.
-She is his daughter.

932
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:44,789
When he can't raise his daughter well,
what will he teach at school?

933
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:47,520
They are people with
no shame or embarrassment.

934
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,140
Let's go.

935
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:56,980
What is this, Master? It is not fair
that she has to go through this.

936
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:05,690
She will not make a mistake.

937
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,270
She will not make a mistake.

938
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,119
This girl! Her mom died
as soon as she was born.

939
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,829
She now took her dad's life.

940
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:52,980
-Her existence doesn't matter anymore.
-Yes.

941
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:28,690
Dad, I was strong
with you by my side.

942
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:53,230
Get up dear, Get up.

943
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:34,390
Pity on her, sir. Who wanted
to hurt a girl like her?

944
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,520
I don't know.

945
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:42,440
But she is very special.

946
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,730
She deserves the answers.

947
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:51,520
Who? Why?
What did they gain?

948
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,440
What is it, sir?
Amrutha's death investigation?

949
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,520
She had a hot body.
She wasted it.

950
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,159
Why would she die just
because everyone saw her?

951
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:47,039
People like us enjoy
only when girls expose.

952
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,770
What do you say?

953
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,699
Being a guy, you are feeling shy.

954
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,230
Think about the pain she must have
gone through, being a girl.

955
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,619
You need a mother to become a son,

956
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,829
A sister to become a brother,

957
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:35,190
A wife to become a husband.

958
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,440
And basically a woman
for you to be born.

959
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,159
You can't even respect
her after death.

960
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,940
Your life has no value.

961
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,730
Remember one thing every time
you have wrong thoughts about a girl.

962
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:02,440
There is a mother in
every girl you see.

963
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,310
Idiot.

964
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,949
I spoke to the Vice Chancellor, Rudra.

965
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:14,579
I called all the students that were
with Amrutha at the resort.

966
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,449
Everything is prepped
for the investigation.

967
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:17,789
Ok.

968
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:21,079
Amrutha is a brilliant student.
She was like my daughter.

969
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:21,949
I am proud of her.

970
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:24,329
If the people responsible for her death
aren't punished,

971
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:26,329
They would become a big threat
to the society.

972
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:30,199
As a lawyer,
I don't like to let them go.

973
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,699
Law can be delayed but not denied.

974
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,140
That is what we teach
our students here.

975
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,489
Is it necessary for our college
to get into such nuisance, sir?

976
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:42,600
What the court and police couldn't
find, can he do that with mentalism?

977
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,770
He has done it in the past.

978
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,440
-Shall we?
-Yes.

979
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:55,060
Madam has an affair with sir.

980
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:59,159
Sir is showing interest to continue it.

981
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:05,020
But madam has no time recently
because her husband returned from Dubai.

982
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,329
How does he know?

983
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:10,730
Why are you asking me?
How would I know?

984
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:21,440
-Why did they keep so many cameras?
-To shoot a Bigg Boss episode with you.

985
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:25,789
Hey! Have some common sense.
Cameras are used to click pictures.

986
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,619
No one will attempt to click you.
Wait for a moment.

987
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,699
Did you forget?
Nisa first clicked a selfie with me.

988
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,449
So the problem began there.
We should kill you first.

989
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,289
Don't remind me the flash back.
My bladder will be blocked.

990
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:40,489
Alright, but I am unable to figure out
what Rudra is going to do here.

991
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:42,909
Sir, if you stay silent,
I can do my work.

992
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:46,119
Hello Mr. Operator, when the situation
is violent, I cannot be silent.

993
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,909
I need a coolant now
and you need a deodorant. Got it?

994
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:52,390
-What did you say?
-Welcome back to 'Na' TV.

995
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,409
He is Sarath Chandra.
Commissioner of Police!

996
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:06,239
And this is Mr. Rudra.
A mentalist.

997
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,329
Please.

998
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,989
Let's get to the point.

999
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:13,600
You all must remember your classmate
Amrutha from last year.

1000
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:18,310
One of you is definitely the reason
behind her suicide.

1001
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,770
And I know.

1002
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:24,466
The criminal is
really intelligent.

1003
01:33:24,467 --> 01:33:27,140
That is why he escaped
the police investigation.

1004
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,980
But he cannot escape today because...

1005
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,440
I can read your heart.

1006
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,690
I can read your mind.

1007
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:49,600
Play all the reactions.

1008
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,199
Shock! She can leave.

1009
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,640
Sad! He can leave.

1010
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,850
Tensed! He has to stay.

1011
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,199
Found him.

1012
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,239
Stay.

1013
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,940
Leave.
Stay.

1014
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,489
Stay! Leave!

1015
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,539
Leave! Leave! Stay!

1016
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,579
Stay! Stay! Leave!

1017
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,350
Stay. Stay.

1018
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,310
Send everyone except
these 12 people.

1019
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:17,869
-No doubt! I am damn sure it's him.
-How do you know?

1020
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:20,190
Future mentalist here.

1021
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,559
Were you ever so angry on Amrutha
that you wanted to kill her?

1022
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,309
What are you saying, sir?

1023
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,269
Amrutha is like my sister.

1024
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,010
Ok, leave.

1025
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,380
She is very service-oriented.
Very gutsy!

1026
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,859
But I didn't expect
her to commit suicide.

1027
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:46,210
I didn't expect for this to happen to
Amrutha. She is a really nice person.

1028
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,590
-Fool, That's my hand.
-Sorry.

1029
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:08,559
Were you and Amrutha roommates
in hostel since the beginning?

1030
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,050
No. After the first semester,

1031
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,809
Dad asked me to shift
to Amrutha's room.

1032
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,340
-Daddy?
-She is my daughter.

1033
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:18,920
Kiran.

1034
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,880
You can go.

1035
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,340
One second.

1036
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:58,130
-What's your boyfriend name?
-Boyfriend?

1037
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,359
-I don't have one.
-Kiran, you are lying to me.

1038
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,710
What nonsense are you talking?

1039
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,399
You are suspecting
my daughter's character.

1040
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:11,130
Sir, please! We are trying
to solve a case here.

1041
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,769
Who was it being so close
to you the other day?

1042
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:19,649
He is Nandu, my classmate.

1043
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,519
-Classmate?
-Yes.

1044
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,960
Why didn't he come here then?

1045
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,689
He didn't go to the tour with them.

1046
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:29,019
You only asked for the people
who went to the tour.

1047
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,859
Commissioner, I need to speak
with Nandu.

1048
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:35,380
Why him? He didn't come to the tour.

1049
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,710
-What's the password?
-That's personal.

1050
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:38,960
Personal? He's a mentalist.

1051
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,170
Ashwin.

1052
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:12,649
Your name is Kiran.
You could name the password as 'K'.

1053
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:13,729
But you didn't.

1054
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:18,960
Your dad is Chandra Sekhar.
You could have it as 'C' but no.

1055
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:22,920
You set it as 'N'.
Why is that?

1056
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,880
Because! 'N' stands for Nandu.

1057
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:33,380
Do you like Nandu?

1058
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,710
Yes.

1059
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:39,519
What about Nandu?

1060
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,760
That's it.

1061
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:46,800
You are just a friend to Nandu.

1062
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:49,050
The reason is Amrutha.

1063
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,630
This.

1064
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:54,630
-It's here.
-Forgot it?

1065
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,269
You didn't get the 'Pratibha'
scholarship you aspired for.

1066
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:00,380
The reason is Amrutha.

1067
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:04,510
You didn't receive much appreciation
from your dad.

1068
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:06,559
The reason is Amrutha.

1069
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,920
She is the most brilliant student
of our university.

1070
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,590
Thanks.

1071
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:31,229
You were roommates with Amrutha
even at the resort, right?

1072
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,359
So what?

1073
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,460
Will you take us through
what happened that day?

1074
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:42,920
Sorry. I forgot.

1075
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,630
You got the 'Pratibha' scholarship
after Amrutha.

1076
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:50,840
I know your memory isn't so weak.

1077
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,010
Tell me.

1078
01:39:57,650 --> 01:39:59,879
While everyone was at
the campfire that day,

1079
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,939
I came to the room
to charge my phone.

1080
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,439
I watched TV for a
while, had a bath.

1081
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,109
As I was dressing up,
Amrutha came into the room.

1082
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:10,109
She said her head hurts
and she would take a shower and rest.

1083
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:11,809
I asked if she wanted
any medicine.

1084
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:14,519
She said no and so,
I went back to the campfire.

1085
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,189
-That's all.
-Good.

1086
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:18,095
Good. Now, tell me everything
you said in reverse.

1087
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:19,130
What?

1088
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:21,399
Come on, sir.
This is harassment.

1089
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,729
Sir, please.

1090
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:24,899
-What does he mean by reverse?
-From the end to the beginning.

1091
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,840
She is so finished.

1092
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:32,050
I got changed,

1093
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,979
Slept,

1094
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:38,059
Watched TV later, had a shower,

1095
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,260
Charged my phone,

1096
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,300
Asked Amrutha!

1097
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,010
Proven fact in
criminal psychology.

1098
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:51,590
89 Percent criminals fail
trying to lie in reverse.

1099
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:57,130
And your eyes clearly suggest
that you are lying.

1100
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,010
Give me your hand.

1101
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,510
Shall I tell you the truth now?

1102
01:41:14,730 --> 01:41:18,550
While you were charging your phone,
you got a call from Nandu.

1103
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:23,109
When Nandu asked about Amrutha
instead of you, you couldn't take it.

1104
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,689
You decided to do something
to Amrutha.

1105
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:29,800
You then had an idea
to shoot Amrutha's video.

1106
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:34,300
You immediately pressed 'record'
and placed it in the bathroom.

1107
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,460
Amrutha took a shower unknowingly.

1108
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:43,380
You edited that video and uploaded it.

1109
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,840
You acted innocent and showered
sympathy on her.

1110
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:52,460
You acted like you are
consoling her.

1111
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,010
She couldn't find out your betrayal.

1112
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:01,090
She couldn't take her fathers death.

1113
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:23,510
I pity Amrutha.

1114
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:27,210
She did nothing wrong.

1115
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:31,479
You are the reason
for her death, Kiran.

1116
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:35,189
No, no. My daughter wouldn't do that.
You are completely wrong.

1117
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:38,920
I didn't come here to wrong
a girls character.

1118
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,460
Look at this.

1119
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,420
Daddy.

1120
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,510
I resign her from this institute.
Let her face the law.

1121
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:34,630
Law will take it's own course.

1122
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:37,260
Daddy.

1123
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,340
You made a mistake, Kiran.

1124
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,800
A huge mistake.

1125
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,960
You didn't just kill Amrutha,

1126
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:53,300
But also her dreams,
ambitions and character.

1127
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,300
Above all that, you killed her father.

1128
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,269
-What did you gain?
-What did you gain?

1129
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:04,359
You took me away from my father
for a dead girl.

1130
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,510
I will see your end.

1131
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,044
If one doesn't have
a mother, we can form

1132
01:45:46,045 --> 01:45:49,460
a bond by calling
someone 'mother'.

1133
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:57,340
But once the word 'dad' is taken away,

1134
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:03,760
No matter how hard you cry
or how loud you yell,

1135
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,510
It doesn't come back.

1136
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:11,210
Because,

1137
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:16,729
The word 'dad' only belongs
to the father.

1138
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:20,210
You've taken that away from me.
What do I do to you?

1139
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:42,880
I assured him
I would show him to the world.

1140
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:51,210
When everyone around him
was killing his trust on me,

1141
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:57,550
He was in agony.
Who will answer to that?

1142
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:21,479
The body I hid from my dad
by blindfolding him.

1143
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:26,340
You have easily exposed it to everyone.

1144
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:29,550
Why should I forgive you?

1145
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,880
Amrutha, I made a mistake.
I was ignorant.

1146
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,519
Please leave me.

1147
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:49,769
When you want to live
and someone is killing you,

1148
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:51,899
Depriving you of your breath,
When death approaches you.

1149
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:55,670
You have to know
how terrifying that is.

1150
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:04,380
Please save me, Rudra.
Please save me.

1151
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:08,760
A girl child cannot study
what she wants,

1152
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,880
Can't wear the clothes she likes.

1153
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,800
Can't marry the guy she likes.

1154
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,899
She doesn't even have a life.

1155
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:22,920
I had everything
but you didn't let me live.

1156
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:26,090
What was my mistake?

1157
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:34,729
Amrutha, please!
I made a mistake.

1158
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:36,399
Forgive me.

1159
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,519
Women have no safety
from men.

1160
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,189
When she doesn't have safety
even from other women,

1161
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,920
Where does she live?

1162
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:51,229
Even until the last moment
when my head touched the floor,

1163
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:54,260
I wanted to live.

1164
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:59,880
But there was no chance,
Now there is no reason.

1165
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,149
What did you gain?

1166
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:05,859
Amrutha, please don't kill me.

1167
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:09,260
-Please spare me.
-Why should I spare you?

1168
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:17,519
'Though revenge is sought
from the enemy'

1169
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,630
'Do no harm once he surrenders'

1170
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:24,019
'Be kind and let him go'

1171
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,840
'Hey Vemana, beloved of the universe!
Listen to me!'

1172
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:32,550
'letting your enemy go, even if he
surrenders for you to seek revenge'

1173
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:42,840
Your greatness, kindness and morals lie
in the fact of letting your enemy go,

1174
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:53,090
World is a beautiful place,

1175
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,840
Very good place.

1176
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:01,090
People are all good.

1177
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,550
Why did you lie to me, dad?

1178
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:14,340
He didn't lie, Amrutha.
You just didn't come across truth.

1179
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,800
You don't need courage to die.

1180
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:21,800
But to live, you need
a lot of courage.

1181
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:26,760
You didn't' have courage
so, you jumped to death.

1182
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,840
I didn't jump and die.

1183
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:38,210
I died and then jumped.

1184
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:46,710
I couldn't breathe not knowing
how to face my life.

1185
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:51,710
-So I jumped.
-That's life.

1186
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,090
Life always tries to defeat us.

1187
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:58,300
That is its nature.

1188
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,420
Winning is life.

1189
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:04,260
Instead of looking for
a 100 reasons to die,

1190
01:51:04,261 --> 01:51:06,960
look for a single
reason to live.

1191
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,380
You can win your life over.

1192
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:15,210
Our birth itself begins
with victory, Amrutha.

1193
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:21,710
A baby struggles in the mother's womb
with congestion, darkness and fluids.

1194
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,800
A baby struggles for 9 months.

1195
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:29,130
What's our struggle compared to that?

1196
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:34,380
The baby faces it all
and thrives to live.

1197
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,960
But doesn't stop breathing.

1198
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:43,960
God doesn't promise anyone
a life without problems, Amrutha.

1199
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:46,760
Life is a package of everything.

1200
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:50,170
We should learn to overcome it.

1201
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:56,760
When we are hurt, we should make sure
the responsible person knows it.

1202
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:00,550
You let Kiran know your pain.

1203
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:03,050
Be peaceful from now on.

1204
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:08,010
Weak people can never win.

1205
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:11,050
Because victory is a quality
of the strongest.

1206
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,630
Forgive Kiran.

1207
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:33,710
Your dad might already
be arguing with God

1208
01:52:33,711 --> 01:52:37,380
about the pain you
are going through.

1209
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:42,550
Doesn't he need a lawyer like you
to argue?

1210
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:49,300
Yes. You told your teacher already
that you would pull God into the court.

1211
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,170
You have that chance now.
Get him.

1212
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:58,800
Don't leave him.
Ask sternly.

1213
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:04,050
Ask him what he was doing until
we had to remind people about humanity.

1214
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:07,559
Ask him why there are situations

1215
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,420
where the heart is to
be reminded of love.

1216
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,210
Will you ask?

1217
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:29,050
What is it, baby girl?

1218
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:35,880
People these days
don't help each other.

1219
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:41,510
But you helped a spirit.
How can I repay you?

1220
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:44,760
Now go to your dad happily.

1221
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,859
He has no worries.
He was doing Zumba on land earlier.

1222
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:44,300
He is doing it in water now.
He might do it in air later on.

1223
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:47,510
Excuse me! Will you click
our family picture, please?

1224
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,309
Hello, brother!
No photos allowed.

1225
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:54,420
No selfies allowed.

1226
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,760
By the way, where is Rudra?

1227
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:59,460
Yes, where is he?

1228
01:54:59,461 --> 01:55:02,961
