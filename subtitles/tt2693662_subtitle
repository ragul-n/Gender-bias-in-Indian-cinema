Held a gun in his hand and.

My fiance is my feeling, Lawyer.

342
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:46,503
And my dignity is my modesty.

343
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:49,493
And modesty is always higher than feeling.

360
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,546
So, was he mad?

361
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:34,598
To take the gun and go to Chowdhary
Nitraj Singh's bungalow.

362

00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:48,127
Put this too around your neck.

543
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,964
When you face difficulties in life.

544
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:53,649
Then you open this.

545
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:57,380
All the sorrows will run away.

546
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:01,330
Police, police, run fast and
Don't stay here.

547
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:02,685
Go fast.

548
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:05,397
May Jesus Christ help you.

549
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,338
Prisoner number 410.

550
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:31,887
It's good...

551
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:34,029
...prisoner number 89 also finished.

552
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,611
Let's move back.

553
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:40,373
Be victorious Syndicate.

554
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,505
[LAUGHING]

555
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:44,434
We have seen big and big
Diamonds in the world...

556
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,209
...but this is also not bad.

557
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:51,373
That's why this Sevak Ram can serve
You people from two million.

558
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:52,949
What?

559
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,916
Rajratan is not such a small diamond,
Sevak Ram ji.

560
00:39:56,357 --> 00:40:00,172
Rather, it won't be wrong to say it as
The younger brother of Kohinoor.

561
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,060
And you're pricing it so low.

562
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,325
It is only due to friendship we have priced
It so low, otherwise.

563
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:09,968
Where does anyone ask in today's time,
Nawab Sahab?

564
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,244
What did you say gentleman?

565
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:18,052
May God grant heaven to my elders, they had
A same diamod but little smaller than it.

566
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,584
Nawab Sirajuddaula gifted him.

567
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,722
At that time a foreigner father asked
Tem million for that piece of diamond.

568
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:26,926
And you are bidding two million for this!

569
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:30,601
Red colored diamond is the only one
In the world, Servant Ram ji.

570
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:33,953
Just look at it, your eyes might deceived.

571
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:34,919
Hey old man!

572
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:40,009
- Your father will be old.
- Okey my father, I used to do the same.

573
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,911
Seeing is a far off thing,
I could tell by smelling.

574
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:46,292
That which stone has what power.

575
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,881
God must be praised and may grant heaven
To my ancestors.

576
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,983
Why do you repeatedly trouble God for the
Paradise of your ancestors?

577
00:40:56,102 --> 00:41:00,068
I am getting disturbed from tis word and
The price is getting down from the top.

578
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:02,188
Please don't use those words Nawab sahab.

579
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,790
And give Seventh Ram ji a chance to
Test the diamnd again.

580
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,836
Ok I put the word in my pocket this time.

581
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,421
- Thank you,
- and God bless you.

582
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,043
Now you test it again.

583
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:21,998
Come on, will you even remember that
From which rich person you were delt!

584
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:24,931
For the sake of our friendship

585
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,586
I raise price more half a million.

586
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:29,670
- Means 2.5 million?
- There is no state or powers to God.

587
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,855
In today's inflation.

588
00:41:31,946 --> 00:41:34,795
Even such a big piece of
glass can't found In 2.5 million...

589
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,246
...and this is Rajratan diamond.

590
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:41,143
- May God grant heaven to my ancestors.
- Again you fetch your ancestors in between

591
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:43,782
I said as much as I wanted.

592
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:46,324
And I don't want it
Go and sell it to someone else.

593
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,707
Like tis I need to warm the fists of
Many more people.

594
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:53,249
Today you'll take that from us,
What will we be left.

595
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:56,145
What we would have left,
They are dragging and eating it.

596
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:57,011
You old man.

597
00:41:57,037 --> 00:42:01,969
- Your father is old.
- Do not go to father, hold on your tongue.

598
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,865
Well I won't say anything but
You also be genuine.

599
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,150
Am I being dishonest or stealing someone.

600
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,140
This is not theft but robbery.

601
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:11,501
Yes, you are right.

602
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:14,919
- I won't sell diamond to a dacoit.
- Are you telling me a dacoit?

603
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,102
It is now a question of my respect,
Now I will offer 5 million for it.

604
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:23,135
Yes that's it,
May God grand paradise to my ancesors.

605
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,265
You again bring ancestors in between.

606
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,203
Now 5 million is reversed to 2 million.

607
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,400
When the decision have mbeen made
In between the children.

608
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:34,681
Then what is the need to bring the elderly
In the middle.

609
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:26,719
"We don't give punishment to."

610
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:31,460
"A painful heart in love."

611
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:36,087
"You should have told earlier."

612
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:40,593
"That you are so oppressed."

613
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:45,171
"We don't give punishment to."

614
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:50,229
"A painful heart in love."

615
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:54,614
"You should have told earlier."

616
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,440
"That you are so oppressed.
We don't give punishment to."

617
00:43:58,629 --> 00:44:04,266
"A painful heart in love."

618
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:50,609
"The jolly gathering was made."

619
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:55,568
"To be colourful."

620
00:44:55,929 --> 00:45:00,281
"The jolly gathering was made."

621
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:05,140
"To be colourful."

622
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:09,597
"The flowers have their own place."

623
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:14,451
"The flowers have their own place."

624
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:19,188
"It decorates the injury."

625
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:23,752
"The painful heart..."

626
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:57,217
"You did it right."

627
00:45:57,685 --> 00:46:02,189
"That you yourself broke the relation."

628
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,927
"You did it right."

629
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:11,563
"That you yourself broke the relation."

630
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,325
"Besides pain, what could you..."

631
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:21,031
"Besides pain, what could you."

632
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:25,939
"Have given me."

633
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:31,423
"The painful love..."

634
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:13,801
"If I would have not participated."

635
00:47:14,143 --> 00:47:18,543
"If I would have not participated."

636
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:23,322
"Without you."

637
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:28,013
"If I would have not participated."

638
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:32,971
"I would have unveiled my face."

639
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:37,410
"I would have unveiled my face."

640
00:47:37,971 --> 00:47:41,940
"In the gathering."

641
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:43,153
Hey!

642
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:46,566
- [SLAPS]
- [SCREAMS]

643
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:49,847
So you got leasure to come home

644
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,301
I am not a servant of anybody's father.

645
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:54,753
I am the master of my own.

646
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,238
Who are you to tell me about it.

647
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,622
This is a cry that
I myself do not know who I am.

648
00:48:02,735 --> 00:48:05,147
There are seven hoists in the
Marriage pavilion with you.

649
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:07,472
Also I am a mother o a child.

650
00:48:08,755 --> 00:48:09,985
It's now completed 10 years.

651
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:12,691
I never felt even once.

652
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:17,531
- That you are my husband.
- Nowadays you are talking a lot.

653
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:18,865
Take this letter.

654
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:20,402
It has come from the Headquarters.

655
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:31,051
Convict number 410, Madhav Singh has been
Killed in a police encounter while he was.

656
00:48:31,435 --> 00:48:33,162
Trying to escape from the jail.

657
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,533
Good.

658
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:38,773
You must be very sad on.

659
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,672
Reading this.

660
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:43,295
You must be quite happy, right?

661
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,029
Many Firons have come and returned from
This world.

662
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,776
Remember.

663
00:48:49,397 --> 00:48:51,764
One day your sins'll come in front of you.

664
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:52,540
Shut up.

665
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:02,835
- Hey! Listen it appears he is alive.
- Okay come on. Hold him.

666
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,326
- John hasn't come yet.
- He must be coming.

667
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:10,309
Here he is.

668
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:15,488
What news have you brought?

669
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:17,460
Why don't you say?

670
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:21,322
Lakshmi Devi has married DSP Sher Singh.

671
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:24,311
- They have an eight year old child.
- And my parents?

672
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,170
Where are my parents?

673
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,800
They are no more.

674
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,569
They longed for drops of water And died.

675
00:49:34,282 --> 00:49:35,487
Died?

676
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:38,625
Oh god!

677
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:45,157
What crime did I do that nothing remains
Of my family?

678
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:50,823
What mistake did I do that I was alive but
Couldn't be alive.

679
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:56,041
If you are truly there, then show me a way
In this darkness.

680
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,671
Tell me what should I do and
Where should I go.

681
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:00,741
Tell.

682
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:04,164
'When you will be extremely troubled... '

683
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:07,045
'...Then open this, all your trouble will.'

684
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:09,714
'Be eased.'

685
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:27,232
Now I can challenge the whole world.

686
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,112
Madhav Singh.

687
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:34,938
Because of your efforts and dedication.

688
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:38,582
You have all that features in you.

689
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:41,472
That must be there in a natural Prince.

690
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:44,038
This is just because of you, Queen mom.

691
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,785
Ten year is not less for Protocol
Training.

692
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,076
And now sometimes, I get.

693
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:53,336
Deceived.

694
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:55,312
If I am the real Prince or...

695
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,087
Who can say that you are not my son?

696
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:01,333
If my son had been alive...

697
00:51:01,454 --> 00:51:03,400
...He would be of your age.

698
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:06,970
But when he was 21 years old.

699
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:10,955
He died in a plane crash.

700
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,922
And my dream to return to the dominion.

701
00:51:16,713 --> 00:51:18,291
Was completely broken

702
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,820
I will fulfill your dream Queen mom

703
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:23,741
I have again got a mom in your form.

704
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,758
I will also cool this fire of revenge.

705
00:51:28,988 --> 00:51:32,193
That is burning in me for twenty years.

706
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:35,558
The day has come.

707
00:51:36,198 --> 00:51:38,118
For the fullfillment of this feeling.

708
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,949
I am handing this work to you.

709
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,073
These documents belongs to my.

710
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:47,899
Son.

711
00:51:49,012 --> 00:51:50,738
These are the certificates.

712
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,987
Here the king's signature is also there.

713
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,027
And the family's stamp also.

714
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:57,778
According to it, you.

715
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:59,936
Are my son from today.

716
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,756
Bless me Queen mom.

And our family diamond Rajratan
Is missing from that day.

842
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,131
Who has captured that Rajratan?

843
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:34,408
This secret has been hidden in the
Police files?

844
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:38,343
Due to time and circumstances, sometimes
Police also gets helpless.

845
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:39,985
Like I.

846
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:42,309
Can't revive Madhav Singh.

847
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,569
No way of Madhav Singh, Mr. Man
Singh.

848
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:49,272
According to the Police reports, he has
Died long ago.

849
01:01:49,614 --> 01:01:51,215
You are right, Sir.

850
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:53,662
But don't know why, I really believe.

851
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,462
That the King is not the King.

852
01:01:55,952 --> 01:01:57,126
But Madhav Singh.

853
01:01:57,695 --> 01:02:00,058
Now we can neither be lied nor.

854
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:03,105
Nor can we point out at the King's
Personality.

855
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,525
So, I want your permission to.

856
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:07,816
Reopen this case.

857
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:08,431
Okay.

I will be happy if you get to the root and
Expose the truth that is hidden.

01:02:18,377 --> 01:02:19,159
Thank you sir.

861
01:02:20,211 --> 01:02:24,195
- Oh! What about the Big Daddy?
- The investigation is going on for it.

862
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,054
But Police hasn't get to any conclusion.

863
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:29,760
As far as I think.

864
01:02:30,923 --> 01:02:32,586
Sevak Ram Mevalal is.

865
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:34,524
The biggest smuggler of this area.

- Today I have called you for a discussion.
- At your command, your Highness.

874
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:10,048
What can be more delightful for me
Than this?

01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:10,831
Thank you.

A business partner.

Have a secret also.

884
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:33,665
Desire and secret are like skirt and blouse
They are together in a business.

885
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:37,361
Without it, nothing can work.

886
01:03:37,436 --> 01:03:40,069
You appear as an expert player.

887
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:41,890

- Thank you king.

Whatever will be said in your behaviour's
Praise, is less.

Go ahead.

01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,028
Hmm.

903
01:04:26,704 --> 01:04:29,700
- What do you mean?
- There no income in the dominion.

But we can't let go the royality
Of the ancestors.

Be purchased.

Making him the target.

1298
01:30:30,739 --> 01:30:33,765
He was sentenced for lifetime because of
their false accusations.

Nathu Singh was also involved.

In Bhupi's case, that Nathu Singh was
killed.

He was innocent, DSP.

He has been given trial
for the crime he did not do.

1325

Yes he didn't.

1326
01:31:58,127 --> 01:32:01,230
He even did not know the people whose
killing accusations were on him.

You are saying as if you knew Madhav
Singh closely.

01:49:13,259 --> 01:49:16,010
- I know the reason.
- I'm not supporting him.

1643
01:49:16,551 --> 01:49:19,203
His name got in your crime list.

- Because he was innocent.
- Stop this nonsense.

1645

Why can't you say that his love is
still there in your heart?

01:49:25,919 --> 01:49:28,284
Because he was your lover.

Such an innocent guy should not
raise his hand on his wife.

And it doesn't look good on you either to
come in anyone's house.

He can handle every situation.

01:58:56,215 --> 01:58:59,131
Because there was money in your locker and
in your head.

1793
01:58:59,365 --> 01:59:00,513
There was proud for power.

1794
01:59:00,731 --> 01:59:01,997
This is absolutely wrong.

1795
01:59:02,466 --> 01:59:05,403
You don't have right to put such a false
accusation.

1796
01:59:05,739 --> 01:59:07,663
You should have proof for that.

1797
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,694
I have much proof.

1798
01:59:10,083 --> 01:59:10,867
Your honour.

1799
01:59:11,207 --> 01:59:12,487
In this case

1800
01:59:12,785 --> 01:59:14,263
I want to call Nawab Jagir Hussain.

1801
01:59:14,667 --> 01:59:15,806
As a witness.

1802
01:59:16,045 --> 01:59:18,806
- In this court.
- I allow.

1803
01:59:24,538 --> 01:59:25,567
Nawab.

1804
01:59:26,278 --> 01:59:27,464
You remember.

1805
01:59:28,436 --> 01:59:30,180
In the era of Narsingh.

1806
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:33,169
When late Sher Singh was there.

1807
01:59:34,135 --> 01:59:35,402
Then Mr Ram Singh.

1808
01:59:36,127 --> 01:59:38,104
Was a government lawyer.

1809
01:59:38,306 --> 01:59:39,697
And In King's dewan.

1810
01:59:39,806 --> 01:59:40,660
Yes.

1811
01:59:40,716 --> 01:59:42,577
He is a government lawyer...

1812
01:59:42,712 --> 01:59:44,375
...and Officer dewan.

1813
01:59:45,088 --> 01:59:46,576
Then you must be remembering that.

1814
01:59:47,112 --> 01:59:48,653
In King's.

1815
01:59:48,953 --> 01:59:51,557
He had full freedom to do money
transactions.

1816
01:59:52,003 --> 01:59:53,500
Even more than King.

1817
01:59:53,745 --> 01:59:55,213
He had more hand in the wealth.

1818
01:59:55,915 --> 01:59:59,862
His hand was not in wealth but wealth in
his hand.

1819
01:59:59,982 --> 02:00:01,956
And what was there.

1820
02:00:02,134 --> 02:00:06,428
He being the dewn, he made false papers.

1821
02:00:06,694 --> 02:00:07,277
My lord.

1822
02:00:07,564 --> 02:00:11,253
It is correct that all the king papers were
made by me.

1823
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:13,417
But was signed.

1824
02:00:13,555 --> 02:00:15,030
By king.

1825
02:00:15,218 --> 02:00:16,590
Absolutely.

1826
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:18,429
There is no doubt.

1827
02:00:18,615 --> 02:00:23,323
That the king had faith on his dewan.

1828
02:00:23,399 --> 02:00:28,179
For which he signed even before the papers
were made.

1829
02:00:28,262 --> 02:00:28,831
Because.

1830
02:00:29,026 --> 02:00:32,358
His interest and disinterest.

1831
02:00:32,565 --> 02:00:37,208
His legal and illegal things were also
approved by you.

1832
02:00:37,592 --> 02:00:39,814
In which everyone was involved.

1833
02:00:43,464 --> 02:00:44,748
All this.

1834
02:00:44,996 --> 02:00:46,245
Tell me in detail.

1835
02:00:46,384 --> 02:00:50,156
May god grant my ancestors heaven.

1836
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,605
The kings have very good life.

1837
02:00:52,694 --> 02:00:54,610
Take birth by giving precious gems.

1838
02:00:54,799 --> 02:00:58,031
And in this world.

1839
02:00:58,331 --> 02:01:02,517
Liquor and girls were their main interest.

1840
02:01:03,297 --> 02:01:05,076
You mean to say.

1841
02:01:05,388 --> 02:01:07,323
That Ram singh also did such work.

1842
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:11,543
There is no surprise even if his doing
such works.

1843
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:14,362
He has take the commands of King.

1844
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:16,199
Objection my lord.

1845
02:01:16,452 --> 02:01:18,959
Ask defence lawyer to behave nicely.

1846
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,230
Who doesn't know that the Kings of
those days.

1847
02:01:22,296 --> 02:01:24,670
Had bad character.

1848
02:01:24,834 --> 02:01:25,795
Then you.

1849
02:01:26,069 --> 02:01:28,438
How can you give your character
certificate?

1850
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,633
You were.

1851
02:01:29,765 --> 02:01:31,810
Also there in that environment throughout.

1852
02:01:32,885 --> 02:01:34,088
Your honour.

1853
02:01:34,952 --> 02:01:36,667
Those people were not of poor character.

1854
02:01:37,117 --> 02:01:38,471
People like lawyer.

1855
02:01:38,626 --> 02:01:39,842
Due to their desires.

1856
02:01:40,185 --> 02:01:41,523
Had destroyed them.

1857
02:01:41,701 --> 02:01:42,769
Mr Maan Singh.

1858
02:01:43,374 --> 02:01:46,857
You are trying the ruin the image
of Dewan Ram Singh?

1859
02:01:47,173 --> 02:01:48,804
You have to answer this.

1860
02:01:49,109 --> 02:01:50,461
The answer for this.

1861
02:01:50,983 --> 02:01:53,384
His actions are enough.

1862
02:01:54,507 --> 02:01:56,380
In the king's desires.

1863
02:01:57,076 --> 02:01:58,843
Mr Ram Singh's life.

1864
02:01:59,144 --> 02:02:01,039
Was filled with lavish.

1865
02:02:01,877 --> 02:02:03,675
When the person becomes lavish.

1866
02:02:04,117 --> 02:02:05,189
He becomes desirous.

1867
02:02:05,565 --> 02:02:06,362
Bad.

1868
02:02:06,585 --> 02:02:07,348
Tracheourous.

1869
02:02:07,511 --> 02:02:08,756
It doesn't take much time.

1870
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,489
Who doesn't know.

1871
02:02:10,725 --> 02:02:12,998
That in King's palace dancer Rajni Bai.

1872
02:02:13,353 --> 02:02:14,231
Was abused...

1873
02:02:14,506 --> 02:02:16,087
...by Dewan Ram Singh.

1874
02:02:18,705 --> 02:02:21,965
Don't try to make a
mountain out of nothing.

1875
02:02:22,165 --> 02:02:23,216
Mr Raam Singh.

1876
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:25,143
Don't interfere much.

1877
02:02:25,868 --> 02:02:27,050
Proceed Mr Maan Singh.

1878
02:02:27,153 --> 02:02:27,942
Nawab.

1879
02:02:28,469 --> 02:02:29,531
You tell me.

1880
02:02:30,436 --> 02:02:32,657
Dewan Ram Singh with Dancer Rajni Bai.

1881
02:02:33,031 --> 02:02:34,076
What all he gained from her?

1882
02:02:34,607 --> 02:02:37,897
May God grant my ancestors, Deewan Ram
Singh.

1883
02:02:37,923 --> 02:02:40,123
Is moody person.

1884
02:02:40,362 --> 02:02:43,768
And being a Deewan.

1885
02:02:43,999 --> 02:02:48,118
He always played double game.

1886
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:52,083
And being an intelligent lawyer, that was
his part.

1887
02:02:52,212 --> 02:02:56,404
He trapped innocent girl named Rajni.

1888
02:02:56,527 --> 02:02:58,771
And he bought her in front of king.

1889
02:02:59,415 --> 02:03:00,674
Objection my lord.

1890
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:02,842
These are false accusations.

1891
02:03:03,182 --> 02:03:06,107
And they are being said by Nawab Jagir
Hussain.

1892
02:03:06,292 --> 02:03:07,566
Because he has been sold.

1893
02:03:07,598 --> 02:03:11,731
Nawab Jagir Hussain cannot be bought
Deewan Ram Singh.

1894
02:03:11,862 --> 02:03:14,519
Neither anyone is born who can buy him.

1895
02:03:14,609 --> 02:03:17,588
Can you deny from the fact taht you
and Sher Singh.

1896
02:03:17,601 --> 02:03:20,476
Forced Rajni Bai to
give poison to the King.

1897
02:03:20,574 --> 02:03:22,411
Can you deny from this?

1898
02:03:22,452 --> 02:03:26,506
Can you deny that the moment King died
you and Sher Singh took away everything.

1899
02:03:26,579 --> 02:03:28,556
You can say that very easily Nawab.

1900
02:03:28,617 --> 02:03:30,956
Do you witness that I
have taken royal wealth?

1901
02:03:30,997 --> 02:03:31,929
Absolutely.

1902
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:35,004
To prove the truth.

1903
02:03:35,165 --> 02:03:37,344
Only one witness is required.

1904
02:03:37,429 --> 02:03:39,134
Who was present there.

1905
02:03:39,188 --> 02:03:41,209
Bring her to the court.

1906
02:03:41,502 --> 02:03:43,877
So that everything becomes clear.

1907
02:03:44,002 --> 02:03:45,475
Deewan Ram Singh.

1908
02:03:45,606 --> 02:03:48,157
Why are you proud of yourself?

1909
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:52,287
Because you think the main witness Rajni
Bai is dead.

1910
02:03:52,443 --> 02:03:54,645
But don't forget this.

1911
02:03:54,725 --> 02:03:58,608
For truth to come out, her soul can come.

1912
02:03:58,815 --> 02:03:59,667
Lawyer.

1913
02:03:59,969 --> 02:04:04,686
- Request the court and call Rajni Bai.
- My lordship.

1914
02:04:05,445 --> 02:04:06,748
I request.

1915
02:04:07,019 --> 02:04:08,862
That Rajni Bai is allowed

1916
02:04:09,207 --> 02:04:09,925
I allow.

1917
02:04:09,996 --> 02:04:12,529
Rajni Bai please come.

1918
02:04:14,836 --> 02:04:15,831
My lord.

1919
02:04:16,295 --> 02:04:19,030
There are making fun of court.

1920
02:04:19,601 --> 02:04:21,381
They are bringing fake Rajni Bai.

1921
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:23,489
By bringing her in the court.

1922
02:04:23,809 --> 02:04:24,536
Your honour.

1923
02:04:24,914 --> 02:04:27,361
I can say that with belief.

1924
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:29,300
That in trial box.

1925
02:04:29,512 --> 02:04:30,470
This lady.

1926
02:04:30,748 --> 02:04:32,341
Is not Rajni Bai.

1927
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:34,569
Because according to police reports.

1928
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,302
Rajni Bai is dead.

1929
02:04:36,383 --> 02:04:38,454
Rajni Bai is alive Dewwan Ram singh.

1930
02:04:41,777 --> 02:04:43,795
And she is standing in front of you.

1931
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:45,450
If you're brave enough.

1932
02:04:45,715 --> 02:04:46,968
Then tell me.

1933
02:04:47,126 --> 02:04:48,794
That Rajni Bai is not alive.

1934
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:49,986
Deewan.

1935
02:04:52,603 --> 02:04:53,683
Mr Maan Singh.

1936
02:04:54,103 --> 02:04:55,406
According to police report.

1937
02:04:55,813 --> 02:04:57,383
If Rajni bai is dead.

1938
02:04:57,641 --> 02:04:58,903
Then how is she alive?

1939
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,881
This is also a mystery.

1940
02:05:02,675 --> 02:05:04,401
Rajni named another woman.

1941
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:06,806
Was a victim of this incident.

1942
02:05:07,998 --> 02:05:11,374
Nawab Jagir Hussain.

1943
02:05:11,909 --> 02:05:14,596
He uncovered this woman's mask.

1944
02:05:15,022 --> 02:05:16,514
By making her wear.

1945
02:05:17,095 --> 02:05:19,724
Everyone believed the
death of this Rajni Bai.

1946
02:05:20,872 --> 02:05:21,894
Everyone.

1947
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:24,173
Dewan Ram Singh, Sher Singh.

1948
02:05:24,478 --> 02:05:26,169
And Mitraj Singh was also involved.

1949
02:05:26,446 --> 02:05:27,780
And all this.

1950
02:05:28,718 --> 02:05:30,659
In the supervision of IG Police.

1951
02:05:31,682 --> 02:05:32,892
Deewan.

1952
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,314
Now in camel's back.

1953
02:05:35,924 --> 02:05:37,589
Only one thing is left.

1954
02:05:40,306 --> 02:05:42,286
Look at King.

1955
02:05:42,774 --> 02:05:44,431
Try to save yourself

1956
02:05:45,446 --> 02:05:47,616
Singh has murdered Madhav Singh.

1957
02:05:49,027 --> 02:05:50,192
Not the King.

1958
02:05:50,839 --> 02:05:51,960
He is Madhav Singh.

1959
02:05:52,341 --> 02:05:53,889
Ship capt. Madhav Singh.

1960
02:05:54,416 --> 02:05:56,692
[INAUDIBLE]

1961
02:06:09,016 --> 02:06:11,531
[INAUDIBLE]

1962
02:06:32,538 --> 02:06:34,060
Number six.

1963
02:06:49,788 --> 02:06:50,750
Madhav.

1964
02:06:51,525 --> 02:06:52,740
Madhav Singh.

1965
02:06:53,188 --> 02:06:54,591
Come here Madhav.

1966
02:06:56,182 --> 02:06:57,611
Come here Madhav Singh.

1967
02:07:12,507 --> 02:07:13,452
Lakshmi Devi you?

1968
02:07:13,753 --> 02:07:14,449
And in this time.

1969
02:07:14,704 --> 02:07:15,894
Yes me.

1970
02:07:16,779 --> 02:07:20,410
I have come here to take the last
decision of my love.

1971
02:07:20,491 --> 02:07:24,438
- Which misunderstanding?
- Dont try to act smart.

1972
02:07:25,311 --> 02:07:28,714
You have put me in many problems after
your heart's poison.

1973
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:30,979
And I have suffered.

1974
02:07:31,295 --> 02:07:32,849
But today is my turn.

1975
02:07:33,416 --> 02:07:36,004
I will not return from here.

1976
02:07:36,424 --> 02:07:40,020
- Or else you'll go in the next world.
- But what have I done.

1977
02:07:40,762 --> 02:07:42,498
What have you left for me?

1978
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:46,751
You have killed me for your revenge.

1979
02:07:47,587 --> 02:07:49,142
Took away my brother

1980
02:07:49,521 --> 02:07:50,681
I was sad.

1981
02:07:51,332 --> 02:07:54,044
My husband was forced to suicide.

1982
02:07:54,831 --> 02:07:56,096
I suffered that.

1983
02:07:56,725 --> 02:07:59,721
You have made me suffer every time.

1984
02:08:00,475 --> 02:08:02,096
I din't say anything.

1985
02:08:02,761 --> 02:08:05,075
But what did my daughter do?

1986
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:08,586
That you have destroyed her life.

1987
02:08:09,219 --> 02:08:10,905
I have nothing with tha girl.

1988
02:08:11,629 --> 02:08:13,258
I have no such intentions.

1989
02:08:13,375 --> 02:08:16,090
Why did you do the drama of prince?

1990
02:08:16,467 --> 02:08:17,306
So that.

1991
02:08:17,438 --> 02:08:19,455
So that he take her far from me.

1992
02:08:20,144 --> 02:08:23,036
You have seen only one side of the picture.

1993
02:08:23,078 --> 02:08:24,723
And this has one way only.

1994
02:08:25,205 --> 02:08:27,191
Either you will remain alive or me

1995
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:30,286
I'll not shoot you.

1996
02:08:30,578 --> 02:08:31,912
Take this gun

1997
02:08:32,208 --> 02:08:34,254
I'll not fire you.

1998
02:08:34,596 --> 02:08:36,672
But you have taken revenge from women.

1999
02:08:36,913 --> 02:08:38,881
Take this gun and make me the target.

2000
02:08:39,476 --> 02:08:41,300
One has to die today.

2001
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,028
And the one who is alive.

2002
02:08:43,555 --> 02:08:45,059
His revenge is done.

2003
02:08:45,869 --> 02:08:47,198
I say you to pick up the gun.

2004
02:08:47,448 --> 02:08:49,153
Don't shout Lakshmi.

2005
02:08:49,877 --> 02:08:51,920
I am more louder than you.

2006
02:08:52,028 --> 02:08:54,309
If you have Rajputi blood.

2007
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:55,607
Pick up the gun.

2008
02:08:56,084 --> 02:08:57,127

2009
02:08:57,349 --> 02:09:00,198
If you want this, I accept your challenge.

2010
02:09:05,828 --> 02:09:08,322
In the count of three, we will fire.

2011
02:09:10,147 --> 02:09:11,043
One.

2012
02:09:13,292 --> 02:09:14,132
Two.

2013
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:17,837
Three.

02:09:34,892 --> 02:09:36,242
Madhav.

2016
02:09:36,516 --> 02:09:39,346
You have not done anything.

2017
02:09:40,425 --> 02:09:44,648
I am happy that you fired.

2018
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:47,699
My red blood.

2019
02:09:48,633 --> 02:09:50,513
Has bought you near me.

2020
02:09:51,537 --> 02:09:52,902
I loved you.

2021
02:09:53,127 --> 02:09:54,211
And hated you.

2022
02:09:55,109 --> 02:09:56,219
But the victory.

2023
02:09:57,108 --> 02:09:58,822
Is yours.

2024
02:09:58,989 --> 02:10:00,368
No Madhav.

2025
02:10:00,744 --> 02:10:03,165
