1
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:42,293
Game industried has always tried to bring
video games and digital far than 3d technology

2
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:48,732
have you ever thought if you send
any data over internet

3
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,905
how it will go from 1 corner
to other corner?

4
00:02:53,275 --> 00:03:00,408
We have lots of rays and frequencies
around us

5
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:09,050
it has been spread into our
world like fire

6
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:13,156
and this world is always around us

7
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:31,375
because of these days all digital
data travels

8
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:39,949
mr barren could not come here to
welcome you, he has sent his welcome photo

9
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:49,430
can i bring this photo in this conference
room without any gadget?

10
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:56,796
Our technology is about that

11
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:39,708
it has made from those rays which
are always around you

12
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,342
but you cant see them

13
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:48,822
with our technology you can
see and touch them

14
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:59,163
you can move the distance between
real and virtual world

15
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:08,001
sometimes to save life we have
to kill someone

16
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,371
for everyone

17
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:26,244
and i had a fight with father
of all

18
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:30,019
only he could fight with me

19
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:51,132
all girls love me

20
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:09,081
i dont like uninvited guests

21
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,124
i always come without invitation

22
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,363
just now i killed spider man

23
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:19,029
with baygon spray.
With insect are you?

24
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:39,282
Dont worry my girl.
Then will you come with me for dinner?

25
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,049
But i dont want to eat chinese

26
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:51,457
if your talk is finished than
can we start fighting?

27
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,531
Stand up

28
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:36,557
i cant talk on the phone

29
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,235
what is going on in office?

30
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,914
Someone has called him jackie chan

31
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:18,355
i'm not interested in looking at
your ugly face in the morning

32
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:23,534
our company has got a very big
contract to make a game

33
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,836
it will be released in india

34
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:30,475
my last 2 games were floped

35
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,744
if this game will also be flop
then i will shutdown this company

36
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:41,951
i will not fire anyone because
i will open a restaurant here

37
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:06,337
is anyone has any problem?

38
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,049
I have a problem

39
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,482
what is your problem?

40
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,729
I dont know how to make idlee

41
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,479
you are not taking me seriously

42
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:29,062
when my book will be on best seller list
than you will see how it helped me

43
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,028
it is necessary for all girls
of india

44
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,138
why all girls in india are like this?

45
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,195
I'm not singing,
i'm saying

46
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,478
tell me something about your
new video game

47
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,195
its a new game

48
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:14,099
it has a very fresh hero

49
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,203
then who do you like?

50
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,843
Villain dont have any rules.
They just have to win

51
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:37,849
make a game in which villain
will never lose

52
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,729
hero always wins

53
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,398
goodness always win against
badness

54
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,376
move fast we have to
go to school

55
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:08,279
your father will drop you at school

56
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:11,483
if father will drive then we will
reach office day after tomorrow

57
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,781
i want to tell you 1 thing

58
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:21,244
you like villains then i will make a game
in which villain will be more powerful than hero

59
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,860
badness is not good

60
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:09,260
whenever i use computer or play game
my name is whisper

61
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:24,818
it means her computer will connect
her computer with all of our computers

62
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:37,328
she will ask for permission.
We all will say no

63
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,999
one fat boy will say yes

64
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:24,904
i have a very good idea for
our new video game

65
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:03,118
i did not put this smile in program

66
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:09,089
then why ra. One is smiling in game?

67
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:13,694
Is program learning things by itself?

68
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:31,282
This is the main part of our game

69
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:50,763
it will be the power of all players

70
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:58,335
after winning each level it power
increases

71
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:15,260
until this heart is attaching ra. One or g. One
they cannot be died

72
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,731
they will not die by breaking heart

73
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:36,715
they will not die by beating them

74
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,116
if their both hearts are attached together
then we can kill them

75
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,254
how they will die?

76
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:58,438
Whoever shoot first on target
will win

77
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:10,783
so this heart is their strength and
weakness too

78
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,882
in this movie villain lost and
hero won

79
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:53,992
thats why film was flopped

80
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:55,955
did not you see villain was very cool?

81
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,526
People die by smoking

82
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:26,083
we both can break his teeths

83
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,036
take it as a tip

84
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:02,820
did you see how i scared them?

85
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,912
I'm not a coward

86
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,924
i'm not a coward

87
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:33,877
check correctly

88
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:38,425
there will be a game's launch in 2 days,
there should not be any problem

89
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,851
have a look at most fabolous game

90
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:38,311
he can become anything

91
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:45,077
any face, anything.
And this artificial program

92
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:48,514
he can learn anything

93
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:53,016
same danger will not come everytime

94
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:03,433
every player will get a super
hero to fight with ra. One

95
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:08,698
and you will get a suit to play
this game

96
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,992
every player can become g. One

97
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,909
i want to play this game now

98
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:10,447
this game will finish when i
will kill you

99
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,456
i have to stay in lab,
there is a problem in the game

100
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:59,180
you hugged your father

101
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,148
i wanted to say that game was great

102
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:07,352
we live in 1 house,

103
00:47:46,966 --> 00:47:49,696

104
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:05,869
where ra. One is gone?

105
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:05,037
I will kill you

106
01:01:27,453 --> 01:01:31,719
how it happened?

107
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:36,088
Ra. One told me he will find me

108
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:44,998
first control suit of this
game is yours

109
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:48,898
i have made ra. One like you want

110
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:56,414
if ra. One is made from bad thinking
then g. One is made from my feelings

111
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:13,491
you can see it and touch it too

112
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:21,699
if you will stuck in game then
my g. One will show you way

113
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:24,759
it means ra. One has become kashee

114
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:44,717
i was saying correctly,
ra. One has killed papa

115
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:49,055
ra. One has turned into kashee.
We are getting late for flight

116
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:51,793

if you will stuck in game then
my g. One will show you way

120
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:31,432
there is only 1 way to stop ra. One.
G. One

121
01:04:32,037 --> 01:04:35,268
if ra. One can come out then
g. One can also come out

122
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:42,774
we can try to follow these steps and
bring ra. One out

123
01:05:23,288 --> 01:05:25,313
i just saw akash going up

124
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:31,325

135
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:34,925
G. One saved us

I will reset him and press play button

01:19:28,032 --> 01:19:30,523
he is a man,
not a tape recorder

151
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:35,998
if someone is dead,
he cannot come back

152
01:19:38,309 --> 01:19:42,746
like people change clothes,
soul can change bodies

153
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:51,413
tell him to leave him

154
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:08,220
you cannot touch me here

155
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:11,254
you cannot touch me anywhere

156
01:22:25,877 --> 01:22:27,071
i have to touch you

157
01:23:01,045 --> 01:23:02,876
she is my mom

158
01:27:39,857 --> 01:27:43,384
yesteday is behind,
future is ahead

159
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:47,030
what did you say?

160
01:27:51,268 --> 01:27:55,500
There is a shekhar's folder in my program,
there are so many shekhar's line in that folder

161
01:28:44,755 --> 01:28:47,087
i have to go to electricity ward

162
01:28:50,327 --> 01:28:51,885
you scared me

163
01:28:54,298 --> 01:28:55,890
go and stand by somewhere else

164
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:07,032
when everything will be ok then
i have to do something for him

165
01:29:08,812 --> 01:29:10,143
he cannot live with us?

166
01:29:11,482 --> 01:29:14,918
He is not a tv or toaster that
we can keep him on side

167
01:29:15,386 --> 01:29:17,354
he talks like human

168
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:28,229
do you think g. One was
right about geeta?

169
01:29:31,035 --> 01:29:33,936
That dad has come back by becoming
g. One

170
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:41,335
do you remember whenever we are
in danger what papa said?

171
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:05,066
I have charged inverter

172
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:18,108
do say this infront of children

173
01:30:18,816 --> 01:30:21,376
i will run.
Do anything you want

174
01:30:29,326 --> 01:30:31,055
i know what i have to do
with him

175
01:33:22,533 --> 01:33:23,898
it was my mistake

176
01:33:24,401 --> 01:33:28,360
i told father to make a game in which
villain never lose

177
01:33:29,139 --> 01:33:33,200
if we beated ra. One that day
then papa would be with us

178
01:33:41,518 --> 01:33:43,952
there is no nutritional element in it

we will always run from him

203
01:45:18,114 --> 01:45:21,777
if we will not destroy heart then we
have to face him

204
01:45:28,358 --> 01:45:29,950
its a emotional decision

205
01:45:33,363 --> 01:45:34,990
you have to make a decision

206
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:47,033

memory left
