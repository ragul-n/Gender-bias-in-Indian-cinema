MAHARSHI [THE SAINT]

2
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:13,990
'Origin'

3
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,650
The trillion dollar company that has foot 
prints in 70 countries all over the world

4
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,050
is coming out with a 
big announcement today.

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,220
Hello!

6
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,050
As every story has an end,

7
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,470
My story as CEP comes to an end today.

8
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,650
I'm retiring as CEO of Origin.

9
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,610
In a week's time, 
we will be anouncing the new CEO.

10
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,160
John Bates, the CEO of Origin has 
taken the business world by surprise...

11
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,930
...by announcing his retirement.

12
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,840
There's a lot of 
speculation going around...

13
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,040
...as to who's going to 
be leading Origin next

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,700
One thing is for sure, 
this will be a dream job for that person.

15
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,280
Possibility for either...

16
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,840
Felix Eucipher, Joe Richards, 
Michael Angler and Rishi Kumar

17
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,810
Rishi Kumar... 
the name we didn't know till yesterday

18
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,210
Today he has a chance to 
be appointed as CEO of...

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,140
...the World's biggest Corporate Company, 
Origin group.

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,170
If this comes true...

21
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,300
his name will be a pride for every 
Telugu person all around the World.

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,620
Welcome!

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,380
Like you all, I'm equally excited 
to accounce the new CEO of Origin.

24
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,060
He is a man of commitment, 
a man of confidence

25
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,790
and a man of courage.

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,970
He is none other than...

27
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,590
Mr. Rishi Kumar

28
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,520
[applause]

29
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,750
[applause] Thank you! Thank you.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,040
A lot of tabloids and news 
channels have been stating that

31
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,790
it's a dream come true for 
whoever takes up this position.

32
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,770
[chuckles]

33
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,310
I just want to tell them, 
I don't believe in dreams

34
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,320
I believe in reality

35
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,240
This is where I always wanted to be, 
and that's the reality

36
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,930
Thank you sir, for having the trust in me.

37
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,010
Thank you. [applause]

38
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,990
-All the best Rishi. 
-Thank you sir.

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,550
The world is yours.

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,570
"You're everything and you're the policy"

41
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,780
"You're your challenge 
and you're infinite"

42
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,980
"Let every night turn into ashes" 
"Let the fire in you show direction"

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,790
"Dash ahead as a missile"

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,130
"In a way every Century..."

45
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,770
"...and every age listens to your name"

46
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,200
"Making victory stick to you always"

47
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,650
"You're everything and you're the policy"

48
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,860
"You're your challenge 
and you're infinite"

49
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,070
"Yours is a unique way"

50
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,490
"It can never be achieved by others"

51
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,970
[conversations muted by song]

52
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,450
"Yours is a chapter"

53
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,740
"Pride of the mountain peak"

54
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,400
"You may have studied the 
script used to write the fate"

55
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,570
"You are writing your own fate"

56
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,820
"You're the proof of being undefeated 
for people who fear defeat"

57
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,900
"You've been accustomed to victory"

58
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,200
"You're everything and you're the policy"

59
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,570
"You're your challenge 
and you're infinite"

60
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,490
As you became an example of success... 
we all wish to know about you.

61
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,200
How do we know whether 
we succeeded or not?

62
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Past!

63
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,030
Our past says us whether 
we succeeded or not

64
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,490
Where were we in the past 
and where are we now.

65
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,610
We'll understand based on that, 
whether we are successful or not

66
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,400
Did you ever think you 
would be at this position?

67
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,030
I did and that's why I'm here

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,320
Your salary per annum 
is 125 Million Dollars!

69
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,820
that is about 950 Crores in Indian 
currency plus Company shares.

70
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,200
You're already a Billionaire.

71
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,070
You're earning so much money... 
how do you feel?

72
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,250
Money!

73
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,570
My dad took a loan of ten thousand 
when I was in sixth standard.

74
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,820
He couldn't repay that loan

75
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,950
That money lender used to turn 
up at my house every week.

76
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,700
Why did you take a loan when 
you can't repay the money?

77
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,900
You said one month and it's been an year.

78
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,070
When will you repay?

79
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,570
What's that smile when I'm yelling at you?

80
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,030
Don't you have any shame?

81
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,320
Brother, Tea

82
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
Huh, nothing less in hospitality

83
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,450
You've been giving me Tea and sending 
me back, as and when I come here

84
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,950
You're born like a human, right?

85
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Don't you have that 
sense to stand by word?

86
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,860
Why do you need a wife and kids?

87
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,650
to live a pathetic life with you?

88
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,530
Damn!

89
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,900
On that day when my 
mom saw me like that...

90
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,900
with a fear that he may come again,

91
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,020
she used to get our house locked by 
neighbours even when we were at home

92
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,490
More than these thousands 
of Crores I earn today...

93
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,720
I remember that pain of not 
having ten thousand on that day.

94
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,320
Money is a strange thing.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,180
It's nothing.

96
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,460
But again, it's everything.

97
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,140
When we chase money, 
it runs faster than us.

98
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,860
And if we run not thinking of money, 
the same money comes running behind us

99
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,490
I never stopped running from that day

100
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,890
That's great sir!

101
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,320
Your definition of success?

102
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
There aren't any definitions for success.

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,780
When we succeed, 
we become it's definition.

104
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,070
"You're everything and you're the policy"

105
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,450
"You're your challenge 
and you're infinite"

106
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,840
[music]

107
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,780
[music continues]

108
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,260
Hi Rishi!

109
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,050
You are one of the most searched persons 
in Google in the last few months.

110
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,560
You can tell me something more important.

111
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,780
Okay...

112
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,780
It's my birthday today.

113
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,450
Okay...

114
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,900
Happy Birthday!

115
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm throwing a party this evening.

116
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,650
No excuses, you got to be there.

117
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,500
Sure... I'll be there.

118
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,770
Thank you!

119
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,020
Nidhi!

120
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,320
What bro?

121
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,320
You forgot your friends 
as you grew famous?

122
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,860
Do we let you forget if you forgot?

123
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,040
Huh?

124
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,540
Hey Kanna!

125
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,380
Uh!

126
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,030
Rishi, my lion!

127
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,070
-How come you are here? 
-Surprise!

128
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,230
Hi Rishi!

129
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,200
-Hey! 
-It's so nice to see you!

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
Hi!

131
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,620
-Hi! 
-Hello!

132
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,530
Hi dude!

133
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,780
How are you, Rishi?

134
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,700
Geetha, are you still on a diet?

135
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,910
[everyone laugh]

136
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,850
You haven't changed a bit, Rishi.

137
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,200
Hi Rishi!

138
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,430
-Sir! 
-Hi!

139
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,150
Sir, how come you are here?

140
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,610
They said it's a surprise for you and 
I kept aside everything and came here

141
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,490
Thanks, Nidhi.

142
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,950
She's the reason behind all this surprise

143
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,570
Yeah Rishi, 
today isn't even my birthday too.

144
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,910
It's a surprise for you Rishi.

145
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,290
Thanks Nidhi.

146
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,360
Rishi, I see many batches at 
the Institute as a Professor.

147
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,830
But very few batches are special.

148
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,790
But you... made your batch 
much more special for me Rishi.

149
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,530
Thank you, Sir.

150
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,360
Yeah.

151
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,850
And thank you all, 
for making it this far for me.

152
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,780
Lots of memories when I see all of you...

153
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,690
Where did all this start, Sir?

154
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,010
Hey dude!

155
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,250
Do you remember your first vehicle?

156
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,660
Tuk tuk tuk...

157
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,280
Hey... Give these to my dad

158
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,010
Dude...

159
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,610
A friend can involve in his friend's 
love problem, nothing wrong in that

160
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,700
But when the friend has a problem with 
his dad, another friend shouldn't involve

161
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,860
Go and give the key yourself, go.

162
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,900
-Hold it... 
-Oh no

163
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,530
Idiot, do you have any sense? 
Will you send him if there is nobody?

164
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,400
I spoke to Registrar, settled everything, 
but this guy went and ruined it all.

165
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,850
Sir, as per rules

166
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,700
Hey, shut up! What rules?

167
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,990
Why do yiou still have such idiots in 
the Company? Didn't I ask you to fire him?

168
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,740
Your dad likes him sir.

169
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,450
Why do you still stand showing 
your worthless facce to me? Get out!

170
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,730
Sorry Sir.

171
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,950
Who is that idiot?

172
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,200
You call him, idiot? 
He's our small boss, Rahul Sir

173
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,070
-Give this to Satyanarayana Sir 
-Okay.

174
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,810
Stay! Stay!

175
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,580
Watch the ball!

176
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,200
What are you planning to do?

177
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,280
What I wish should happen, 
but he shouldn't know why it is happening

178
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,040
Careful with this.

179
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
He is out!

180
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,070
Who are you, idiot?

181
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,410
What idiot?

182
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,170
Don't you know to respect elders?

183
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,530
Hey! How dare you hit me?

184
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,580
Hey!

185
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,340
Ah!

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,410
Hey, who are you?

187
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,610
Oh no, it's paining bro

188
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,780
It's between me and him... 
why do you care?

189
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,200
Do you need a cap? Go!

190
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,020
Hey!

191
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,440
[groans]

192
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,450
Actually, he's out now

193
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,680
[groans]

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
Didn't you wear a guard?

195
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,830
No.

196
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,260
You should've worn one!

197
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,820
Let us know why you are hitting us!

198
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,320
It seems you shouted on Principal 
at College in front of everyone.

199
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,030
Don't you know how to 
give respect to elders?

200
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,860
What's about this college and Principal? 
Who do you assume we are?

201
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,110
Aren't you Amit?

202
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,820
Who is Amit boss? My name is Rahul.

203
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,820
Stop bluffing! You are Amit

204
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,700
I swear, my name is Rahul

205
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,860
-Hey Kanna... 
-Yes dude.

206
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,450
He say he is Rahul and not Amit

207
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,950
I had the same doubt from long dude. 
That guy is fair and this guy looks dark

208
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,820
You should have told me when 
you've got that doubt!

209
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,200
You were in the flow dude, 
so I thought of not stopping you.

210
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,240
I hit him very hard.

211
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,240
Why didn't you say, boss?

212
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm a bit shy, dude.

213
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,990
Hey...

214
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,530
-Go home and put some ice. 
-Ok Sir.

215
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,400
I don't understand the logic.

216
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,360
You and your dad don't gel well.

217
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,490
Then why do you break the bones of 
any guy who disrespects your dad?

218
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,150
Me and my dad may have many differences,

219
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,110
But does that mean I stay calm 
if some idiot insults him?

220
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,280
I'll thrash that idiot.

221
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,650
Oh no, your dad's here. I'm leaving.

222
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Wait, it will take an hour for him to come

223
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,360
What, an hour to climb two floors? Why?

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,530
Look down once

225
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,400
Keep watching. 
People gather around him once he arrives.

226
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,860
Yes, they did.

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,240
Now they'd all sit on that park bench now, 
just like the assemnly.

228
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,530
Dude, you're giving a great commentary 
without even seeing the match.

229
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,570
It's a daily routine

230
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,450
See now, 
a mad guy would come searching for him.

231
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,780
Mad fellow?

232
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,900
-Sir 
-He came.

233
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,280
Did he put a hand in his pocket?

234
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,110
He did.

235
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Did he take out money?

236
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,610
He has given them too

237
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,070
He doesn't know how to pay 
interest for the loan every month.

238
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,530
But doesn't compromise on donations

239
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,070
But dude, 
your dad has a great following here

240
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,900
He's Kukatpally Gandhi! 
See now, he'd be laughing along with all

241
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,710
[group laughs]

242
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,530
Yes, all are laughing just like 
Gandhi on a 500 rupees note.

243
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,490
How?

244
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,530
How can he live smiling as if nothing 
happened even when so much happened today?

245
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,570
That's why my dad is my role model

246
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,610
-What, dude? 
-To know, how not to live.

247
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,700
Thank God!

248
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,240
Are you going to tell about your 
M. Tech plan to your dad or not?

249
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,030
That's a plan for us, but a shock to him.

250
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,900
He asked me to give this to you.

251
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,140
What's this?

252
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,290
What's that?

253
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,820
Its M. Tech admission 
letter from Vizag IIET, mom

254
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,360
Weren't we expecting him to 
prepare for Civils after B.Tech?

255
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,240
That wasn't my expectation... It was his.

256
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,200
How can he ask me to write Civils 
as he couldn't become a Collector?

257
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,780
-What will he do, after M. Tech? 
-I'll go to the US

258
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,760
And then?

259
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,740
I don't have to work 
under anyone like a slave.

260
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,570
Everyone has his own life 
and I can do what I want.

261
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,450
Name, fame, and money!

262
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,360
I just want to win, Mom.

263
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,740
Does succeeding in life 
mean just earning well?

264
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,780
If I keep thinking this way, 
I too will remain like him.

265
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,700
I can't live with a smile 
while losing everyday.

266
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,360
Watch what you talk. 
See, he left without having dinner.

267
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,030
If a lie turns into truth if we don't eat, 
then no one needs to eat on this earth.

268
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,610
Looking at him... I am frightened to lose.

269
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,780
I can't do this anymore.

270
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,490
I'm suffering in between you two.

271
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,730
I can't bear this anymore.

272
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,610
What happens to me if you say so?

273
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,350
Sit down.

274
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,780
You say no and I won't go to Vizag at all.

275
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,700
Hey, my mom got my ears pierced 
and put earrings when I was a kid.

276
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,570
You don't try to fill 
them with sweet lies.

277
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,900
Ok, when should you go to Vizag?

278
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,580
In two days

279
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,790
Geography says that the whole 
world revolves around the Sun.

280
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,200
But the reality is, the whole 
world revolves around success.

281
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,540
Look at the wall behind me.

282
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,410
50,000 students have passed since 
the day this institute was established.

283
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,580
But the photos of just seven 
people got on to that wall.

284
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,010
Because they were achievers.

285
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,100
Just imagine the 
competition in the outside world.

286
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,660
I too was a student here once.

287
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,390
While sitting there, I always wished 
to become the Dean of this institute.

288
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,320
And I achieved it.

289
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,580
This institute teaches you how to succeed.

290
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,830
A lot of students here 
would fear the word 'failure'.

291
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,540
But as they always say, 
failure is the first step towards success.

292
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,110
Well, if anybody has something to say,

293
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,230
the dais is open. Please come and speak.

294
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,740
-Hi, sir 
-Hi

295
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,470
I'm Rishi.

296
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,370
You just said that failure 
is the first step to success.

297
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,260
I don't believe that, sir.

298
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,980
These quotes would seem nice as 
morning messages on Facebook and WhatsApp.

299
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,540
The world which revolves 
around success according to you,

300
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,950
that same world would be waiting to take 
over and vanquish for just one failure.

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,410
Here, we shouldn't have any 
other goal than winning.

302
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,750
If you don't mind me saying this sir,

303
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,310
Even you aren't successful according to me

304
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,830
Because there won't be 
any full stops in success.

305
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,750
There would be only commas.

306
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,620
You've put a full stop 
to your success, sir.

307
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,790
How can you be successful?

308
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,870
You said that institute 
teaches how to be successful.

309
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,430
If if is true,

310
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,340
the walls of this institute won't 
be suffcient to put the photos, sir.

311
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,540
Because everyone has his 
own way in achieving success.

312
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,410
Success is not a destination, 
success is a journey.

313
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
[applaud]

314
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,200
Thank you.

315
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,540
Terrific bro, the speech was awesome.

316
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,750
Otherwise, everyone gives 
a lecture about success.

317
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,050
-Look he's there 
-Yeah... Yeah... I saw him.

318
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,820
Ahem... Ahem...

319
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,000
Water?

320
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,610
-Hi, I'm Nandini. 
-Hi.

321
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,820
I'm Keerthi. 
Hello.

322
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,210
What an insight about success?

323
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,050
You are amazing.

324
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,320
-Superb speech! 
-Thank you.

325
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,340
See you. 
See you.

326
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,930
Excuse me.

327
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,480
Keep in touch, ah.

328
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,100
-Sure 
-Sure

329
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,770
Smart guy, right?

330
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,320
Why didn't you even have 
a sip of water, bro?

331
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,570
It was not about water,

332
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,830
I just tried to see if 
it works out or not.

333
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,830
It worked out great.

334
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,950
-Hi... 
-Hi

335
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,170
Hi, Rishi.

336
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,370
This is Ajay.

337
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,750
I'm the top ranker in this 
institute's entrance exam.

338
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,370
You spoke greatly about 
success and scored well.

339
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,250
But don't try to 
compete with me in the exams.

340
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,160
Your opinion about success might change.

341
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,910
Hello top ranker.

342
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,830
Go and study.

343
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,940
[vehicle arriving]

344
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,830
This is so big? 
How will you live here?

345
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,830
I'll be fine, you take care.

346
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,790
Don't get carried away thinking 
about the village and fields.

347
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,330
Eat on time and take 
medicines properly. See you.

348
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,370
Hey Ravi...

349
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,040
You too eat food on time 
and don't worry about me.

350
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,120
-Call me every two days, son. 
-Okay dad, go now.

351
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,080
Boss...

352
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,870
Can you tell me the 
way to boy's hostel?

353
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,870
Go straight and take left, 
you'll find a notice board.

354
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,290
It'll be written in that. Go now.

355
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,410
It's heavy, can someone help me?

356
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,540
Hey, you've already arrived late. 
On top of that, you're asking for help.

357
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,910
Everyone has to carry their 
own burden here. Bugger off.

358
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,370
He said it, right? 
Bugger off.

359
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,560
Excuse me, can you please tell 
me where the girls' hostel is?

360
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,540
Go straight and take left, 
you'll find a notice board.

361
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,700
Everything will be written 
in that, go and search.

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,980
I have excess luggage, 
can you please help me?

363
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,330
Huh! Everyone has to clear their own 
backlogs and carry their own luggage here.

364
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,700
And you have to shut your mouth.

365
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,750
Hell with your senseless verses!

366
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,250
Don't you have the common sense to 
help her when she's asking for it? Idiots!

367
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,450
Come... Come, I'll help you.

368
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,590
Yeah. Thank you very much.

369
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,870
What's with him, bro?

370
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,390
Hey, instead of sitting there 
and gossiping about girls,

371
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,320
why don't you come here and help him?

372
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,060
It's strange,

373
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,860
that humanity is fading away in humans 
like oxygen fading away in the atmosphere.

374
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
-Where are you from? 
-Hyderabad

375
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,950
Hyderabad? 
I have never seen you.

376
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,700
Well, this is a college and 
you should be very careful.

377
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,000
About what?

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,370
There'd be many idiots like them.

379
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,620
Every guy plans to flirt ten 
girls at the beginning of the year

380
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,650
hoping that there'd be at least one girl 
who falls for them at the end of the year

381
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,810
after getting filtered in the semesters.

382
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,950
-By the way, do you like coffee? 
-Yes, why?

383
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,950
Well, all of this starts just with that 
single line, 'can we meet over a coffee?'.

384
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,450
After that, there would dating, 
meeting, chatting and what not.

385
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah, I know.

386
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,660
Shall we catch up over a coffee?

387
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,000
No... No... I'm unlike any other guys. 
I asked because I felt you're interesting.

388
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,450
Rishi!

389
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,540
You said we shall catch up over 
a coffee. Where did you go?

390
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,790
Timing.

391
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,700
What you said is true, 
there are many idiots in the college.

392
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,780
I can take care of myself. Thanks.

393
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,580
Then, who will take this?

394
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,440
Anyway, she's gone. 
Come over, let's have a coffee.

395
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,890
[coughs]

396
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,700
Hey, what are you doing?

397
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,200
Hey, are you my roommate?

398
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,830
I should ask you that. What's all this?

399
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,530
It's a hostel room.

400
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,510
Who knows who might have stayed 
here and what might have they done?

401
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,660
That's why I lit this incense so 
that the room gets cleansed.

402
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,270
Make some more smoke 
and you'd be gone too.

403
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,210
Take that out first. Out!

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,080
Hey... Go.

405
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,960
-Hi, Rishi. 
-Hi.

406
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,140
Sit down... Sit down... 
Please sit down.

407
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,160
Whenever we enter a new class, 
that energy would be different.

408
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,020
Something great.

409
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,080
Similarly, every professor 
would have a curiosity

410
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,930
to find out the brilliant 
student of his class.

411
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,790
So, this is solution board.

412
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,080
We give a toughest problem on this board.

413
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,930
To solve this, 
it might take a few months.

414
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,570
Sometimes, it might remain unsolved 
even after the end of the semesters.

415
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,290
But if anyone solves it,

416
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,470
their photo would be 
published in the college magazine

417
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,950
and they would be 
felicitated on the annual day.

418
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,090
So, the problem I'm going to give you is,

419
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,720
If the expression

420
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,970
x square - 4cx

421
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,870
divided by x square 
+ bx + c square = ?

422
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,500
This is the problem and 
let's see who'd solve it.

423
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,620
It's me, sir.

424
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,950
-Yes, sir. I'll do it. 
-Hmm... Great.

425
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,080
[door closes]

426
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,830
-Hey, switch off the light. 
-Can't you see? I'm solving the problem.

427
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,500
Is it necessary to solve that now?

428
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,450
Maybe you don't, 
but it's necessary for me.

429
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,580
Well, you seem like you 
have come here for timepass.

430
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,830
But I'm not like that.

431
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,580
My dad did farming, saved every penny 
and sent me here with great hopes.

432
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,660
So you too have a 
problem with your father?

433
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,250
So you won't switch off 
that light until you solve it?

434
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,430
Who knows? 
I may not switch off.

435
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,370
This is the solution.

436
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
Go and switch off the light.

437
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,040
Do you know the solution to 
this problem, right then?

438
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,660
Yes.

439
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,450
Then, why didn't you tell 
that in the classroom?

440
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,790
Oh, then?

441
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,330
The light didn't trouble me so much.

442
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,120
Switch off the light now.

443
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,250
Switch off!

444
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,080
The problem is solved?

445
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,700
Solving the problem overnight hasn't 
happened in the institute till date.

446
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,830
Come on, who did this?

447
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,910
-Ajay, was it you? 
-No, sir. I didn't do it.

448
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,250
Then, who was it?

449
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,830
He is the one, sir.

450
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,620
You did it?

451
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,200
The thing is...

452
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,250
I wrote it, sir. 
I wrote it...

453
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,040
Yes, sir. I saw him 
doing that. Ravi wrote it.

454
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,120
-I couldn't find even on Google, sir 
-Come. Come on... Come on.

455
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,570
See, that's the beauty of the institute.

456
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,660
Aha! We can't expect 
where we get surprises from.

457
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,120
I thought Ajay would 
solve it, but Ravi did.

458
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,410
Come on, everyone. Clap for Ravi.

459
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,560
[applaud]

460
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,360
It's really shocking to me.

461
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,450
Now, I should give you a 
tougher problem than this.

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,050
You haven't given me 
an ordinary task, man.

463
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,840
Thank you, sir.

464
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,380
Take your seat.

465
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,160
Excuse me. 
Congratulations.

466
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,380
Now, the problem for you is

467
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,810
The function f of x...

468
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,750
F(x) + pi/2 =

469
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,880
pi/2 - modulus of x.

470
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,680
Find the first derivative of pi/2?

471
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,760
What's with you, you solved this too?

472
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
I wrote it, sir. I wrote it.

473
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,250
How? 
How is it even possible?

474
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,710
-Sir... 
-Ah?

475
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,090
-Claps... 
-Yeah. Clap... Clap... Clap...

476
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,290
[applaud]

477
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:34,970
Thank you.

478
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,910
Ajay, I thought you'd solve at least 
this problem but Ravi did it again.

479
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,080
[knocks]

480
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:49,930
[gasps]

481
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,890
You!

482
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,160
They said this is Ravi's room.

483
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,290
Hey...

484
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,030
Yes. What can I do for you?

485
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,020
Nothing. I felt to meet you casually.

486
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,400
-You are such a genius, Ravi. 
-Thank you.

487
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,790
How did you solve such 
tough problems so easily?

488
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,100
Why do you want to 
talk about that now?

489
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,780
-Let's talk about it later. 
-Okay.

490
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,290
Shall we catch up over a coffee?

491
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,910
No, nothing as such.

492
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,660
I already have a girlfriend in my 
village and she trusts me a lot.

493
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,910
I'm fixed to her.

494
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,950
Ravi, I asked to catch up over 
a coffee just as a friend.

495
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,200
The thing is that it is better 
to have clarity in advance.

496
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,280
What if you had hopes on me, 
and that leads to another thing?

497
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,280
I don't want such mess.

498
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,950
You have exceeded my expectations, dude!

499
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,700
No... No. Nothing like that. 
Just as a friend. That's it.

500
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,870
Then, we shall meet tomorrow.

501
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,550
But just as a friend and 
you should pay the bill too.

502
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,410
-Okay, see you. 
-Okay.

503
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,750
And you! You are so lucky to 
share a room with a genius like Ravi.

504
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,910
Try to work hard a bit along 
with him. You'd at least pass.

505
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,750
Sure, madam.

506
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,270
Bye, Ravi. 
See you.

507
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,850
Come...

508
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,670
-Rishi, the thing is that... 
-Well, dude...

509
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,750
Why do you ask a girl to pay the bill 
when she was calling you over a coffee?

510
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,790
The thing is...

511
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,950
-Do you really have a girlfriend? 
-Don't you believe? Wait a minute

512
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,330
[cupboard door creaks]

513
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,250
This is Pallavi, my girl.

514
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
Her dad and my dad are good friends.

515
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,950
That's why there weren't any car chases 
or violence. Everything is normal.

516
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,950
-Who is he, your brother? 
-I don't know who he is.

517
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,250
Then, why is he here?

518
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,870
There is an old lady in our 
village and he is her grandson.

519
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,540
That guy went to the US and 
sends her photos from there.

520
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,540
She keeps roaming around the village 
showing those photos to everyone

521
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,360
and boasts about her 
grandson settling in America.

522
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,700
As I felt having some inspiration,

523
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,880
I got inspired from his photo

524
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,780
that I too shall go to America someday and 
photographed in midst of the skyscrapers.

525
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,660
Is he the inspiration 
for your American dream?

526
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,410
We should have some inspiration, right?

527
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,330
Close that first. I'm unable to bear 
the sight of him. Close it, please.

528
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,910
Hi, Ravi.

529
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,120
Ravi, the thing is,

530
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,150
these algorithms always 
appear to me as ghosts.

531
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,130
How do I crack this code?

532
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,870
This one.

533
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,940
Is this what you meant about 
catching up over a coffee?

534
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,540
Yes.

535
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,830
Do something, 
write down your doubts and give it to me.

536
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,580
I'll think about it the entire night 
and clarify you in the morning.

537
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,960
Actually, just one sum.

538
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,640
-See this is... 
-Hello... Hello, I'm coming.

539
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,340
Write down your doubts and give it to me.

540
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,160
I'll think about it the entire night 
and clarify you in the morning...

541
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,790
-Let's meet in the morning 
-Ravi...

542
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,540
Will you please explain the 
satellite functioning code?

543
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,410
First, do what you came for. We shall look 
into the satellite problem after that.

544
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,160
-Oh no, she'd torture me about the code. 
-Ravi.

545
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,160
Ravi, one second.

546
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,180
What's wrong with you?

547
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,950
Ravi, stop.

548
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,220
Oh!

549
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,660
Do you feel like a hero 
by solving the problems?

550
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,450
That's my problem too, boss. 
I know that I'm not a hero.

551
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,510
I'll tell the truth.

552
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,150
All of you come here. 
Come at once, I'll tell everyone.

553
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,830
Hello, you too come. 
You too ma'am.

554
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,400
Pooja, come. Stand here.

555
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,580
-It isn't me who solved those problems. 
-Then, who did?

556
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,370
Rishi!

557
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,700
K Rishi Kumar, my roommate.

558
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,380
-Rishi? 
-He is the one who solved those problems

559
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,700
If you have any doubts, go and ask him.

560
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
-Hi, Rishi 
-Hi, sir.

561
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,830
I had doubt when I saw Ravi 
for the first time itself.

562
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,810
But it got clarified now.

563
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,250
Why did you push Ravi in the front when 
it was you who solved the problems?

564
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,700
What do I get from that, sir?

565
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,580
Except a little applause and a 
photo in your college magazine.

566
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,620
I didn't come here for those things, sir.

567
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,200
-Then, why did you come here? 
-Necessity, sir.

568
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,040
I need the degree certificate from your 
college to achieve what I wished for, sir.

569
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,620
What exactly do you wish to achieve?

570
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,040
I wish to rule, sir.

571
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,120
What?

572
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,120
I wish to rule the world, sir.

573
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,200
Earlier, people like Alexander 
waged wars to rule the world.

574
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,000
But now, we don't need 
to wage wars to rule, sir.

575
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,910
Google, Youtube, 
WhatsApp, FaceBook, Twitter...

576
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,750
These things are ruling 
the world today, sir.

577
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,000
If we can develop one software like any 
of those, we can rule the world.

578
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,370
Life is a long race, Rishi.

579
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,540
You are thinking of shortening the 
race and running fast. Careful, careful!

580
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,660
At times, that may drop you down and 
even the world may forget you.

581
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,280
[scoffs]

582
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
Long race!

583
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,090
-Do you know Mo Farah, sir? 
-Huh?

584
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,290
-Mo Farah 
-Mo Farah?

585
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,000
Who's he?

586
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,000
What about Usain Bolt?

587
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,790
Who doesn't know Usain Bolt?

588
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,700
He won gold medals at three consecutive 
olympic games in 100 m and 200 m category.

589
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,750
He is a world champion.

590
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,310
Even Mo Farah is a world 
champion like Usain Bolt, sir.

591
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,390
Mo Farah won gold medal twice consectively

592
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,640
in the same Olympic 
games where Usain Bolt won.

593
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,500
But that wasn't in 100 or 200 meters 
run but in 5000 and 10,000 meters.

594
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,950
But nobody remembers Mo Farah.

595
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,660
People remember only Usain 
Bolt who ran for just 100 meters.

596
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,120
In this world which remembers 
only the fastest runners,

597
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,660
Why would I live otherwise?

598
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,690
You are right, sir.

599
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,080
I wish to run fast 
and I don't want to stop.

600
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,790
Anyways, thanks for your concern, sir.

601
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,750
Rishi...

602
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,290
Shall we catch up over a coffee?

603
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,750
-I quit. 
-What?

604
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,450
-I quit coffee 
-Why?

605
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,370
Heard that there is a chemical 
named Trimethylfuran in coffee.

606
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,540
That leads to heart problems, 
gastric problems, sleeping disorders...

607
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,160
ulcer, Alzheimer's and all 
the other diseases too.

608
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,500
We can't risk our life as a 
girl called for a coffee, right?

609
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,290
See you. Bye.

610
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,660
Hi, Rishi

611
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,000
What you said is true. 
Coffee has many side effects.

612
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,160
But I heard that green tea 
has many health benefits.

613
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,830
-Shall we have green tea? 
-Damn!

614
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,300
What's wrong?

615
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,160
Some 20-year old boy from Japan

616
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,790
invented some app and an American company 
bought it for half a billion dollars.

617
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,250
When the world is advancing,

618
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,540
we're still living by 
drinking coffee and green tea.

619
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,370
-Geetha 
-Hi, Rishi.

620
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,910
Shall we catch up over a 
coffee in the evening?

621
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,330
Yeah, sure.

622
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,100
What?

623
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,250
Should I explain the side 
effects of coffee only to you?

624
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,570
She too should know, right?

625
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,540
I understood. 
I messed up big time. Sorry!

626
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,160
What?

627
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:14,950
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,290
If you have said this yesterday, 
we'd have had four coffees by now.

629
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,580
-Take the order, Two coffees. 
-Okay, sir

630
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,660
I'm Pooja

631
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,040
You know my name, right?

632
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,870
I'm Ravi.

633
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,120
One more coffee.

634
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,790
"Small... little words"

635
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,950
"Sweet... Sugary souvenirs"

636
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,080
"Small... little words"

637
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,250
"Sweet... Sugary souvenirs"

638
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,020
"An acquaintance"

639
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:20,180
"is always small"

640
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,740
"In this friendship,"

641
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,670
"the time is always insufficient"

642
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,830
"There'd be thousands of stories"

643
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,750
"Yet another new 
story keeps adding up"

644
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,080
"There'd be thousands of stories"

645
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,200
"Yet another new 
story keeps adding up"

646
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,580
"Small... little words"

647
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,750
"Sweet... Sugary souvenirs"

648
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,000
"This isn't something that could 
be learn't like a song or dance"

649
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,120
"If you ask what friendship is... 
It's a lesson no book can teach us"

650
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,420
"It doesn't come to you when you wish for"

651
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,060
"And it doesn't leave you 
when you want to forgo"

652
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:33,500
"If you ask me who is a friend... 
I'd say a wealth that can't be inherited"

653
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,450
"Dedicating life for you... 
By sharing affection..."

654
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,000
"Driving away the loneliness in you"

655
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,200
"There'd be thousands of stories"

656
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,040
"Yet another new 
story keeps adding up"

657
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,000
"Small... little words"

658
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,160
"Sweet... Sugary souvenirs"

659
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,090
Attention guys! 
We have a college fest in two days.

660
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,120
The theme is Retro.

661
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,950
"One cannot appreciate their life if 
they can't remember their souvenirs"

662
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,080
"Friendships are sweet memories 
that are imprinted in our hearts."

663
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,370
"Even smile has no value without sorrows"

664
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,370
"It is the friendship that makes you 
smile though you have tears in your eyes"

665
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:17,500
"Considering your struggles as 
theirs and living your dreams"

666
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:23,120
"They entrust your success to yourself"

667
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,870
"There'd be thousands of stories"

668
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,200
"Yet another new 
story keeps adding up"

669
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,160
"Small... little words"

670
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,330
"Sweet... Sugary souvenirs"

671
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:01,170
[students chatter]

672
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
K Rishi

673
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,890
Rishi... Congratulations, top ranker.

674
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:15,970
Superb, yaar.

675
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,790
-What about you? 
-I passed

676
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,700
But, Ravi got two backlogs.

677
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,900
[phone rings]

678
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,370
Father...

679
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,410
Hey, you said results would be out today. 
What happened?

680
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,450
The thing is that I have passed the exams, 
father. And I scored good marks too

681
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,040
Hey, my son has passed the exams.

682
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,790
How are you doing, father?

683
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,370
I'm fine and we have a 
good yield this year.

684
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,660
The Mother earth whom we 
believe never lets us down.

685
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,750
Alright! Hey, don't be so engrossed 
in your studies. Eat on time,

686
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,580
-Take care. 
-Okay, father.

687
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,250
[door opens] 
Hey Ravi

688
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,360
[door opens]

689
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,830
Ravi...

690
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,620
What happened, dude?

691
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,040
I feel like dying

692
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,910
Why?

693
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,330
My father had kept great hopes on me.

694
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,910
And I thought to achieve 
something great by coming here.

695
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,870
But nothing is easy in here. 
I'm unable to cope with education.

696
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,290
I can't live lying to my dad 
about having two backlogs.

697
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,790
Will you die for just two backlogs?

698
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,750
What do you got to lose? 
You would say anything.

699
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,450
Everything is easy for you. 
I never even saw you studying.

700
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,910
I keep studying the entire night.

701
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,450
But you'd get first 
rank and I get failed.

702
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,540
Why does everything 
happen wrong with me?

703
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,660
Hey Ravi, your problem isn't your father.

704
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,700
It's you.

705
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,290
Do you know why so many people 
are left behind as failures here?

706
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,120
Instead of identifying their strength, 
they get scared of others' strength.

707
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,950
They keep thinking about what 
others are doing, how they are

708
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,880
and why it happens only to 
them and they lose themselves.

709
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,910
Here, everyone is a hero of their life.

710
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,370
Everyone has their own strength.

711
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,910
I've got my own strength 
and you've got yours.

712
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,500
Your confidence is that strength.

713
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,120
Stand on what you believe.

714
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,870
The bloody victory would come 
by itself and land at your feet.

715
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,370
Hey Rishi, I get great 
courage when you are by my side.

716
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,290
Your courage isn't me, it's your father.

717
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,910
Come on...

718
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,950
Hey, I have a small request...

719
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,830
What is it?

720
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,420
Don't tell me that you 
want to go to America

721
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,860
for getting photographed in 
the near those buildings.

722
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,160
Take out the photo of that 
guy in the cupboard too,

723
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,250
I'm unable to bear that sight.

724
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,160
Well, shall I say that I'm going 
to America to construct buildings?

725
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,540
Come... Come.

726
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,660
-Hey Rishi, someone's looking for you. 
-Who?

727
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,870
Don't know, he is waiting 
for you at the backfield.

728
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,830
Hi Rishi... Bhanu Prasad, MP

729
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,700
-I'm Ajay's father. 
-Hello, sir

730
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,280
Rishi, the thing is that,

731
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,040
Ajay went into depression from 
the time semester results came.

732
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,080
I came to know that you're 
the reason behind that.

733
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,410
Ajay wasn't interested in 
studies during his childhood.

734
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,610
It was me who made him to study hard by

735
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,610
promising him that I'd buy him 
whatever he wants if he tops the exams.

736
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,870
Gradually, getting first 
rank became his obsession.

737
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
No one came in his way till date.

738
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,450
First time... you came in his way.

739
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,700
I came to tell you that it'd be 
good if you slow down a little.

740
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,200
I envy Ajay for having 
a father like you, sir.

741
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,540
There is nothing wrong in 
wishing your son to achieve first rank.

742
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,040
But asking someone to step down 
for that... That's wrong.

743
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,290
I have a problem, sir.

744
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,120
When someone says I'd lose, 
it's my habit to win and show them.

745
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,120
Your son did that mistake and 
now, you are doing the same.

746
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,700
How much do you need?

747
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,040
Everything has a price.

748
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,080
Your father is a mere clerk

749
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,340
and you have a small flat in 
Kukatpally housing board colony.

750
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,080
Tell me, how much do you need?

751
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,540
How much do you need?

752
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,330
I think it's a habit for 
you to give and take.

753
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,040
Fix the price.

754
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:22,040
Exactly after five years from today, 
I'll pay you the amount with interest.

755
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,870
Hey, listen to brother. Or else...

756
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,290
Who the hell is that?

757
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:36,910
Who said that?

758
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,200
I did.

759
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,120
Or else...

760
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,910
Or else... What would you do?

761
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,230
[groans]

762
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:42,640
[groans]

763
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,470
Hey...

764
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,600
[clangs]

765
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,080
[leaves rustling]

766
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,330
Or else... What would you do?

767
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,910
Nothing.

768
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,410
If you had said this before, 
this mess wouldn't have happened.

769
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:33,160
Take them away from here 
without making any sound.

770
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,750
Your son has confidence in 
you that you'd do something.

771
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:42,540
If he comes to know about this, 
he loses his confidence in you.

772
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,770
At least, let that endure.

773
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,910
Fix the price.

774
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,910
Exactly five years from today.

775
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,000
Sister, why are you so tensed even 
after coming home for the holidays?

776
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,950
The thing is that I 
invited Rishi to our home.

777
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,670
I'm worried whether he'd turn up or not. 
[scooter honks]

778
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:10,290
He came.

779
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,160
-Hi Rishi 
-Hi.

780
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,200
I'm very tensed thinking 
whether you'd come or not.

781
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,370
It's just a casual meeting, 
right? Why do you take tension?

782
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,000
Come, Rishi.

783
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,160
I expected something else, 
but the house is very calm.

784
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,290
-Where is the restroom? 
-There...

785
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,980
He seems to be having 
not even a bit tension

786
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,650
about coming to our house as your 
lover and facing our family members.

787
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,750
It is just our family members 
whom I have told about my love.

788
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,700
I didn't say it to Rishi yet.

789
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,360
What? Rishi doesn't 
know that you love him?

790
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,160
Uhuh. He doesn't know.

791
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,700
-Poor guy! He'll be finished! 
-Shall we call everyone now?

792
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,580
He's here.

793
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,320
Be seated, son.

794
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,080
Have this, sir.

795
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,790
What's this?

796
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,870
Pooja said you like coffee, have it dear.

797
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,040
-I'm Pooja's grandpa 
-I'm granny.

798
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,450
-I'm her maternal Grandma 
-I'm her maternal Grandpa

799
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,830
-He's my eldest son... Pooja's dad. 
-Hello.

800
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,450
She's my daughter which 
means she's Pooja's mom.

801
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,370
-He's my second son and... 
-Oh, why all these?

802
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,790
It's like I'm watching Genes programme.

803
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,830
All of you are Pooja's family, right?

804
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,500
That's fine, what about you? 
How many siblings do you have?

805
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,040
No, I have none... 
I'm the only child in my family.

806
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,760
Have you heard it, brother-in-law? 
He is the only son.

807
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,420
Good.

808
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,000
What's good for you if I'm the only son?

809
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,430
Leave that...

810
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,170
After you finish your studies,

811
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,220
Would you earn 50,000 to 
one lakh rupees per month?

812
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,250
How can we say about earning now?

813
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:56,080
What's there in earning? How many 
members are earning in our house?

814
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,830
Right.

815
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,700
-Son, do you drink? 
-Yes

816
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,470
Do you drink occasionally 
or do you drink a lot?

817
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,280
I do drink 
occasionally, but I drink a lot.

818
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:06,840
Oh!

819
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:12,870
-Good. We got a good company. 
-Yes.

820
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,330
-You have a great facility 
-What's that?

821
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,790
You ask questions and you answer them too.

822
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,160
Son, your mother or father 
doesn't have diabetes or BP, right?

823
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,000
They don't have. But now, 
I am getting to know that I'm having them.

824
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,950
Come on, you look very healthy... 
How can you have diabetes and BP?

825
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,770
Why are you asking me all these questions?

826
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,710
Nothing dear,

827
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,300
we should know clearly 
about each other, right?

828
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,000
Pooja, I need to talk 
to you. Please come out.

829
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,660
-Go ahead... he is calling you. 
-Go, Dear.

830
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,700
Why are your people interviewing 
as if I came for matchmaking?

831
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:06,620
Won't they wish to know 
about the guy their girl loves?

832
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
Yes, why not? But they...

833
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:15,950
I love you Rishi.

834
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,540
When is this from?

835
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,580
From the time I understood you.

836
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,770
"To the dreams that dream"?

837
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,990
"Shall I give my eyes to them?"

838
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,750
"To confirm that it's not a dream"?

839
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,120
"Shall I show the proofs?"

840
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:11,660
"The rose that bloomed at the peak 
of the Everest has thrown a smile"?

841
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,590
"The star that hasn't been 
caught by the telescope"

842
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,500
"says that it's been caught in my love."?

843
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:28,690
"By detaching me from myself"

844
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,950
"It is swiftly taking me 
away through the clouds"

845
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,830
"The rose that bloomed at the peak 
of the Everest has thrown a smile"?

846
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,880
"The star that hasn't been 
caught by the telescope"

847
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,610
"says that it's been caught in my love."?

848
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,980
"To the dreams that dream"?

849
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,710
"Shall I give my eyes to them?"

850
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,190
"To confirm that it's not a dream"?

851
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,800
"Shall I show the proofs?"

852
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,750
"The illumination emanating 
from a diamond mine"?

853
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:50,250
"can be seen in my eyes when

854
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:54,740
"The colours in a painting room"?

855
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,290
"would be gleaming on my cheeks 
when you are standing next to me."?

856

"If there's a Nobel prize for the subject 
called romance, you'd win it for sure"

857
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:11,230
"The rose that bloomed at the peak 
of the Everest has thrown a smile"?

858
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,530
"The star that hasn't been 
caught by the telescope"

859
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,060
"says that it's been caught in my love."?

860
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,730
"To the dreams that dream,"?

861
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,950
"Shall I give my eyes to them?"

862
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,330
"To confirm that it's not a dream"?

863
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,760
"Shall I show the proofs?"

[students chatter]

865
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,420
I got it.

866
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,750
Six months of training in 
Mumbai and then a job in America,

867
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,540
all this is because of you.

868
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,830
It's your hard work, why are you 
giving the credit to someone else?

869
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,540
Tell your father first.

870
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,980
[mobile rings]

871
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,910
What happened, son?

872
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,160
Father, I got the job.

873
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,870
The salary is two lakh rupees per month.

874
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,580
Hey Saibabu, 
your son-in-law has achieved it.

875
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,160
Get the papers of rice mill ready, 
you should give them as dowry, right?

876
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,660
Hey Ravi, I knew it long back. 
I believed you more than your father.

877
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,160
Uncle, tell this matter to Pallavi.

878
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,700
Tell her yourself... 
She'd feel happy.

879
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,040
Okay, Uncle.

880
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,750
What's this?

881
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,910
My offer letter, one crore per annum.

882
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,370
This is the highest pay package 
in this institute's history.

883
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:08,410
-Try to beat this if possible, Rishi 
-K Rishi Kumar.

884
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:15,500
Good morning, sir.

885
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,700
K Rishi Kumar, first in all the semesters. 
Looks good.

886
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,210
Tell us which platform 
you wish to have the job,

887
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,790
And we'll decide if you are 
competent for this offer or not.

888
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,620
I haven't come to take your offer, sir. 
I came to give you an offer.

889
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,870
Your company is trying hard to compete 
with Google and Facebook since many years

890
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,580
to develop a social interface.

891
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,470
But this is something more than that.

892
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,710
An operating system based 
on artificial intelligence.

893
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,260
That's the user manual and 
you can go through the codes.

894
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,120
You can find my phone 
number on the last page, sir.

895
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,780
I will be waiting for your call.

896
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,370
Hello...

897
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,750
Seems like you're having excess 
pride. You are taking a risk

898
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,200
Be careful, 
you might even lose what you have.

899
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:19,580
If we step into the game having 
fear of losing, we can never win.

900
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:24,290
I've told you, right? 
You can find my number on the last page.

901
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,790
Just remember that.

904
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,750
What's this party for?

905
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,000
Come on... 
He had beaten Rishi, right?

906
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,830
Beaten him in what?

907
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,830
In today's campus interview, 
Ajay became the highest paid.

908
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,500
-Doesn't he still know the matter? 
-What's that?

909
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,390
Ah?

910
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:51,540
It is, you just took the offer 
letter given by the company.

911
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,000
But Rishi gave an offer 
to the company itself.

912
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,560
Tomorrow, the officials of the 
company are coming to the college

913
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,710
to make Rishi sign a contract with them.

914
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:00,620
Damn! 
[glass shatters]

915
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,950
Rishi, Rishi, and Rishi! The entire 
institute is talking about you, Rishi.

916
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,230
You are a hero.

917
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,830
I'm so happy for you.

918
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,280
So proud of you, Rishi.

919
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,790
Leave about me... What 
happened with your interview?

920
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:19,200
I got an offer from 
Infosys, but I rejected it.

921
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:19,950
Why?

922
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,160
I too should come with you 
when you leave to the US, right?

923
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,120
-Come and... 
-We'll get married.

924
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,950
We'll buy a nice house there. 
You, me and our kids...

925
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,450
It's my dream, Rishi.

926
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,250
You still don't understand, Pooja.

927
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,250
I haven't achieved anything yet.

928
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,700
I have a lot to achieve after going there.

929
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,860
Yeah, Rishi. 
I too will be there with you, right?

930
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,170
I will support you.

931
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:54,970
[scoffs]

932
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,950
All these things would 
seem good as words, Pooja.

933
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,370
But practically impossible.

934
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,580
I ran all these years for this day.

935
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,500
These responsibilities shouldn't 
be a hindrance after going there.

936
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,750
Do you think I am a hindrance in your way?

937
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,080
Not a hindrance, but burden.

938
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,700
If there is a burden here, 
this doesn't work.

939
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,450
I didn't know until now 
that I'll be a burden for you.

940
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,040
How long should I wait?

941
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,290
One year, two years or three years?

942
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,290
I don't have an answer 
for any of your questions.

943
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,950
-Then, what shall we do now Rishi? 
-Let's move on, Pooja.

944
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,040
Let's stop this right here.

945
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:50,540
What I want in my life is different and 
what you want in your life is different.

946
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,370
There won't be a life in the 
relationship if we both come together.

947
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,330
It's better for both of 
us to stop it right here.

948
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,200
You've said in a simple manner, Rishi

949
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:07,750
I thought I understood you 
but I understood nothing.

950
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,370
Hey, Pooja said that you don't want to be 
in a relationship with her? Is that true?

951
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,700
Leave about that topic.

952
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,540
So, will you forget Pooja so easily?

953
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,910
That relationship isn't 
good for both of us.

954
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,410
Leave it.

955
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:49,330
-Will you forget Pooja? 
-I will man!

956
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,200
All these days, 
I thought you were special.

957
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,660
I was wrong. 
You are just like all the others,

958
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,370
who uses and dicards.

959
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:05,000
Is this what you have 
understood about me?

960
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,510
Is that all?

961
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,160
Hope you got the last semester time table 
and your exams will start from tomorrow

962
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,600
All the best to everyone.

963
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,750
Rishi, I am sorry... Please say something.

966
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,280
-Good morning, sir. 
-Morning.

967
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,500
Today is the last exam. 
Final semester exam paper has been stolen.

968
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,150
K Rishi Kumar.

969
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,940
Rishi.

970
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,270
What's this Rishi?

971
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:52,060
I thought you're exceptional when you 
said that you'd top all the semesters.

972
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,450
So, this is your secret?

973
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:57,440
Sir, you know that I didn't do it.

974
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,850
It's not me who 
should know but the police.

975
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,400
There's no way you're going 
to get out of this one, Rishi.

976
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,940
To put this in your terminology, I can 
tell this is a full stop to your career.

977
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,220
Go out and wait. 
We'll call you.

978
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,310
What's this, sir? Is this a joke?

979
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,940
Do you believe that Rishi stole the paper?

980
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,060
What do you want to do 
with Rishi now, sir?

981
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,810
Rusticate him.

982
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,440
-Rusticate? 
-Yes

983
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,650
Are you are going to 
expelRishi from the institute?

984
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,100
Sir, if Rishi passes 
out from this institute,

985
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,790
Rishi wouldn't carry the fame of 
the certificate of our institute,

986
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,270
but our institute would get 
the fame because of Rishi.

987
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
Sir, we understand your emotion.

988
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,520
But the evidence is more 
important than emotion.

989
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,560
All the evidence are against him.

990
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,440
What's up, Rishi? 
Did they find the locker key?

991
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:08,520
You thought you will do something, 
achieve something and reach somewhere.

992
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,730
Where will you go? 
You'll remain like this right here.

993
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,100
This fear in you,

994
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,400
keep maintaining like this.

995
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,410
Go!

996
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,100
I think you're right, sir. 
Rishi might have not done this.

997
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,230
What happened?

998
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,060
We got another strong lead in this case. 
We are sure that Rishi didn't do this.

999
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,020
He can leave.

1000
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,350
Thank you, sir... I knew it, sir. 
I knew it.

1001
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,230
Rishi, you're free to go now.

1002
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,940
No one can stop you now. Go.

1003
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,020
Rishi, I've seen Usain Bolt.

1004
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,190
Now, I want to see you.

1005
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,650
Don't stop running. Just go!

I'll be always fine, Mom.

Would you visit us 
only when he's here?

1011

Well...

1012
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,900
Mom, I'm leaving to the 
US in the next two days.

1013
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,600
Rishi, tell your dad.

1014
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:20,710
I'll take leave.

1015
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,900

1023
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,240
Mr Mohan, your project is done.

1024
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,600
You can go ahead.

1025
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,420
When everyone around the 
world are competing to invent

1026
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,110
operating system based on 
Artificial Intelligence,

1027
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,850
Our Telugu guy, 
Rishi Kumar made it possible.

1028
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,150
This is going to be launched in 
the next two days in New York.

1029
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,150
-Hey, Rishi. 
-Sir.

1030
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,680
Good luck for your big day.

1031
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,930
-We're eagerly looking forward to it. 
-Thank you, sir.

1032
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,060
Rishi, you asked for 
the key points, right?

1033
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,180
You'll be called in around five minutes.

1034
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:45,470
[phone ringing]

1035
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:49,310
-Hey Kanna, I'll call later 
-Rishi...

1036
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,690
What happened?

1037
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:55,900
-You should come to India urgently. 
-What happened?

1038
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,520
Your dad... passed away.

1039
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:11,560
He passed away in his sleep last night.

1040
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:13,690
How's mom?

1041
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,810
Come to India to as early as possible.

1042
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:43,030
[applaud]

1043
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,280
AI...

1044
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,100
Till now, it has been an 
intellectual language.

1045
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,110
From now, it will be a common language.

1046
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,860
It can even integrate your lives 
like you can see it on the screen.

1047
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,800
Your personal computers and your 
mobiles are gonna talk back to you

1048
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:07,200
in a way you can't even imagine.

1049
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,820
From your basic holiday planning to 
the most complex defense analytics,

1050
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,600
this artificial intelligence integrated 
with human intelligence is the future.

1051
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,960
And that future is now.

1052
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:25,390
[applaud]

1053
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,070
[tyres screech]

1054
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,010
[weeps]

1055
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,230
Rishi...

1056
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:35,150
Your father told me to give you 
this whenever you come to India.

1057
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,770
But he might have not thought 
that you'd come like this.

1058
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,100
Rishi, I'm missing you a lot these days.

1059
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,060
Don't know why but the distance between 
us grew that we're not in talking terms.

1060
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,190
I think I'm the reason behind that.

1061
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,900
I know, you looked at me as a 
failure since your childhood.

1062
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,350
But I never felt like I am a failure.

1063
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:06,690
That's because of you.

1064
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,740
Because

1065
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:14,630
I'm the reason for your rage to win and 
the one who brought you to this position.

1066
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,730
I'm not a failure

1067
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,020
I am a successful failure.

1068
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,560
I know that you'd 
achieve whatever you wish.

1069
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:33,800
That's why I forced you to do what I 
couldn't do just like every father.

1070
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,160
Forgive me if possible, son.

1071
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,980
I'm missing you a lot, Rishi

1072
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,940
I'm remembering small things.

1073
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,230
Do you remember,

1074
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,770
I used to take you for a walk 
in the park when you were a kid.

1075
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,810
When you come back, please take me once.

1076
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,690
I wish to talk a lot with you.

1077
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,130
Your father was crazy about you.

1078
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:28,690
But don't know why there weren't 
any words between both of you.

1079
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:00,060
If your dad was alive, 
he'd have been very happy, Rishi.

1080
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,460
He would have been the 
proudest father ever.

1081
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,900
Yes, sir. He isn't here to see all this.

1082
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,600
Come on man, you achieved 
more than what he wished for.

1083
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,850
You shouldn't be dull today. 
You won it, dude.

1084
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,600
Can I take a selfie?

1085
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,270
No girl believes that you're 
my friend. Come on, dude.

1086
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,850
I'll rule the whole 
world now with this selfie.

1087
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:27,270
Smile dude, please.

1088
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:29,970
Woo-hoo! 
[camera clicks]

1089
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,270
-Do all of you like at the same place? 
-Yes, sir. Same campus.

1090
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,770
Nice, nice. It's nice.

1091
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:35,730
Sir, how is Pooja?

1092
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,970
Pooja? Yeah, she's doing good.

1093
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,690
She's the team leader in a top 
gaming company at Hyderabad.

1094
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,190
I asked whether she'd come with us.

1095
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:45,310
You know what the answer 
would be, right Rishi?

1096
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,100
Well Rishi, what happened to Ravi?

1097
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,190
It was a bad partition, right?

1098
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:52,800
He'd be angry on me.

1099
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,270
After that, he never spoke to me 
and I too never spoke with him.

1100
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,310
I heard about Ravi for the 
first time when you said, Rishi.

1101
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,650
It was your professor who 
gave me all the contacts.

1102
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,600
But he never mentioned about Ravi.

1103
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,400
Sir, Ravi was Rishi's 
best friend amongst us.

1104
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,730
How come you didn't mention about Ravi?

1105
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,350
Well... Ravi is not in contact with me.

1106
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,230
That's why I might have missed him.

1107
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:21,730
-By the way, where do you stay? 
-Virginia, sir.

1108
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:24,150
We'll meet there. 
I'll meet you.

1109
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,270
Rishi, this is 18th century wine!

1110
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:34,650
My friend used to say one should 
be very lucky to have such wine.

1111
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:36,100
And I got that luck because of you.

1112
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,600
What happened to Ravi, sir?

1113
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,690
What happened to Ravi? Nothing 
happened to Ravi. Nothing happened.

1114
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,940
-Sir, what happened to Ravi? 
-Why do you ask about him now, Rishi?

1115
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:54,060
-Sir, what happened to Ravi? 
-Ravi got rusticated, Rishi.

1116
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,440
What, sir?

1117
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:09,400
Your last day in the institute was the 
last day for Ravi's career too, Rishi.

1118
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,100
He was expelled from the 
institute on the very same day.

1119
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:13,690
Why, sir?

1120
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:17,270
When there was an allegation on 
you about stealing the exam paper...

1121
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:20,520
We thought you were 
absolved as you didn't do that.

1122
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:25,100
But I came to know it later that 
you were absolved because of Ravi.

1123
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:30,270
Ravi surrendered to police 
confessing that he stole that paper.

1124
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:33,850
Why did he do that, sir?

1125
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,100
I asked him the same question, Rishi.

1126
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,980
Sir, he is Rishi and 
they are trying to stop him.

1127
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,270
He shouldn't stop, sir.

1128
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,770
If he stops, everything here 
would be meaningless, sir.

1129
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,600
What am I, sir? I am nothing, sir. 
I'm just like all the others.

1130
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,350
But Rishi is unique.

1131
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:53,650
He's different and should be somewhere 
else. And he'll definitely achieve it.

1132
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:02,350
Then, I understood how much 
you have inspired Ravi, Rishi.

1133
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,690
You're a superman according to him.

1134
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:09,940
When it was about you, he didn't 
even care about his career.

1135
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:16,310
But his dad who had kept great 
hopes on him, couldn't think like him.

1136
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,690
Upon knowing about Ravi's 
rustication, he committed suicide.

1137
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,850
No one would have understood 
you like he did, Rishi.

1138
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:40,100
He knows that you don't 
like seeking anyone's help.

1139
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,730
That's why he took an oath from 
me to never let you know this.

1140
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,900
He did all of this only 
for your success, Rishi.

1141
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:53,310
Today, you are successful. 
You have proved his trust in you.

1142
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,880
You have turned into a 
definition of success.

1143
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,750
You did it. 
You did it, Rishi.

1144
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,560
But I don't feel so, sir.

1145
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:55,740
"Did you think this is you, 
this is true and this is all yours?"

1146
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,950
-"No, this is not what you've thought" 
-Is this...

1147
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,390
"or searched for" 
-...what you understood about me?

1148
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:05,520
"Are you standing like a 
question asking for an answer?"

1149
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,190
"Time never steps back and 
never gives what you asked for"

1150
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:14,760
"If walking is about 
learning by holding a finger"

1151
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,160
"did anyone ever learn it on their own?"

1152
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:19,820
I don't have an answer 
for any of your questions.

1153
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:24,390
"If you claim that life 
runs by receiving help"

1154
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:28,550
"did anyone ever live alone?"

1155
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:34,060
"Is this happiness that is 
appreciated by others, yours alone?"

1156
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,310
"Does the smile that 
made you win disappear?"

1157
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,870
Does succeeding in life 
mean just earning well?

1158
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,350
"Did you feel this is you, 
this is true and this is yours?"

1159
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,920
"No, this isn't what you've 
thought or searched for"

1160
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:55,900
"Are you standing like a 
question asking for an answer?"

1161
01:22:55,940 --> 01:23:00,520
"Time never steps back and 
never gives what you asked for"

1162
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,360
What happened, Rishi?

1163
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:05,970
I've been observing you since a 
few days... You aren't yourself.

1164
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:06,980
What's wrong, son?

1165
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,150
Did I win, mom?

1166
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,850
What's that question, son?

1167
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:26,230
This is what you have wished 
and worked hard for, right?

1168
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:28,980
You have achieved what 
you wished for, right?

1169
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:31,270
I too thought the same all these days.

1170
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:34,900
Ravi... He is my friend mom!

1171
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,150
He sacrificed his life for me.

1172
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:39,850
Today, I don't even know where he is.

1173
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,270
But I'm here like this.

1174
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,650
I just abandoned Pooja, who thinks 
I am her world and moved on.

1175
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,020
I couldn't even connect with 
father when he was alive, mom.

1176
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,850
What did I win, mom?

1177
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:02,560
What did I achieve?

1178
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:10,150
Rishi... Until now, you did what you felt.

1179
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:13,940
Now follow your heart.

1180
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:17,650
Now, you'll win.

1181
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:23,750
[music]

1182
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,690
Rishi... we called for a 
board meeting as you asked.

1183
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,930
Please.

1184
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:59,900
Well, I'm going on a leave.

1185
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,670
A CEO taking a leave?

1186
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,420
We're on a surge.

1187
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:06,870
At this point of time, 
we all think this isn't a right decision.

1188
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,980
Your schedule is fixed for the 
next six months, Rishi.

1189
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,210
Sir... Sir, you should have 
let us know in advance.

1190
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,270
What about his schedule?

1191
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,320
I think I'm the CEO of this company.

1192
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,590
I'm the CEO and I take calls here.

1193
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,640
No questions asked and no answers given.

1194
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,390
I'm going on a leave.

1195
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,550
I'm off to India.

1196
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:33,770
"Did the breath surge like a flood?"

1197
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:38,560
"Did your journey start afresh again?"

1198
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,520
"Did that sky stop you all these days?"

1199
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:48,310
"Did you see the ground now after 
the meltdown of those heights?

1200
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:53,980
"Even after you achieved 
victory by completing the sprint"

1201
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:58,780
"Is your destination 
still left to be reached?"

1202
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:03,690
"A friendship called you to come"

1203
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:08,240
"Something that never forgets 
you and never leaves you"

1204
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:13,260
"She hid her love just for you"

1205
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:18,190
"It is a memory in her heart, 
the heart waits wounded"

1206
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:22,940
"Though the worlds bowed 
their heads and are praising you"

1207
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:27,230
"Does the success you 
wish for lie elsewhere?"

1208
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:32,360
"When asked for the 
address of your heartbeat"

1209
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:36,870
"Is it showing you your roots?"

1210
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:41,980
"Are your steps guiding you 
back to the past you left behind"

1211
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:47,100
"Have you understood the meaning 
of the happiness you've achieved?"

1212
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:16,280
RAJIV GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, 
HYDERABAD.

1213
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,600
After being appointed as the CEO 
of World's top Company Origin,

1214
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:22,950
Rishi Kumar is visiting 
India for the first time.

1215
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:25,460
The reason behind his sudden 
visit is still unknown.

1216
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,460
Rishi Kumar is coming to invest 
6000 Crores in the Telugu states.

1217
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,790
Why did you say so, brother?

1218
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,390
It's news when we say knowing it 
and a breaking news without knowing it.

1219
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,100
We'd say he came to invest 6000 crores.

1220
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,070
If he invests, 
we will say we have said that first.

1221
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,380
If he doesn't invest, we write an article 
about him as to why he didn't invest.

1222
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,600
Who'll question us, we're sincere here.

1223
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:49,230
Pooja, where are you? 
[television playing]

1224
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,370
Your ex-lover is coming to India.

1225
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,820
-What's the reason behind Rishi's arrival?  
-Don't see such crap news.

1226
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,070
and don't tell me even if you see it.

1227
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,040
-Kanna, take mom to home. 
-Okay.

1228
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,790
This is Ramakrishna.

1229
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:12,900
-He'll be assisting you. 
-Hi.

1230
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:13,840
-Sir... Sir... 
-Sir... Sir... Sir...

1231
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,020
What's the reason for your 
sudden visit to India, sir?

1232
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,000
You have come to India to 
invest 6000 crores, right?

1233
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,760
-Sir, sir... 
-Please sir.

1234
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,570
-Please. 
-Tell us, sir.

1235
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,740
This is just my personal trip.

1236
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,250
There's nothing official about it.

1237
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,380
-Sir, sir please... Tell me sir. 
-Sir, one minute...

1238
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,780
Sir, we've booked a presidential suite 
in Park Hyatt for all your meetings.

1239
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,880
As per what you've said... [phone beeps]

1240
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,210
Check the pin I've sent you.

1241
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,680
Sir, looks like you've sent a wrong pin, 
this shows Ramavaram of Godavari district.

1242
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,970
-We should go right there. 
-Okay, sir.

1243
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,670
Sir, the Ravi you asked for 
is in that tent it seems.

1244
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:52,370
Ravi...

1245
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:05,640
Hey Rishi!

1246
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,450
Have it.

1247
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,600
I don't even understand what to give you.

1248
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,640
Why did you come for me?

1249
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:50,930
Sorry, Ravi.

1250
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,630
Sorry, for what?

1251
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,580
I forgot you, dude.

1252
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,520
Forgot? Who are you?

1253
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,140
CEO Rishi Kumar, 
you'll have so many works.

1254
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,460
Why should I be remembered among those?

1255
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:05,080
See, how you look? 
This is called victory man!

1256
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,000
You've lost, right?

1257
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,070
It's like I won when you win.

1258
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,160
-Come on, let's go 
-Where?

1259
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,880
Didn't you always want to get 
a photo between the buildings?

1260
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:22,800
Come on, let's both go and take a photo.

1261
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,360
Those things were back then Rishi, 
but not now.

1262
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,970
My dad was mad about this village.

1263
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:35,280
Whatever memories are left of him, 
are this village and this house.

1264
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:39,870
If I'm gone from here, 
my dad would no more be in my life.

1265
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:46,010
But, they're saying that this village, 
this house and nothing would exist.

1266
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,130
What happened to your village?

1267
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:51,210
They say they've found 
some gas in the sea nearby.

1268
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:53,900
And they'd dig down all the villages 
on their way to lay that gas pipeline.

1269
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:55,430
Our village is one among them.

1270
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,090
Your village people should agree on that, 
right?

1271
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:58,910
They've agreed.

1272
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,020
Few agreed being helpless

1273
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,900
some agreed in fear and few 
others sold themselves for money.

1274
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,340
But I haven't agreed.

1275
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,900
They've been destroying 
all the villages in their way similarly.

1276
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,750
They'd destroy our village too in the same 
way in the next four months it seems.

1277
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,820
They are all farmers.

1278
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,990
They are leaving their 
village and their own houses.

1279
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,870
No idea where to go and how to live.

1280
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,350
Huh! Look at those kids.

1281
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,230
They are not going to have an identity 
to say that this is their village.

1282
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:36,040
This was the land growing 
three crops per annum once.

1283
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,080
See, how they've made this.

1284
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,430
They threatened to grab 
this land three years back.

1285
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,700
Then, they made sure no one 
bought the harvested crops.

1286
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,070
They stopped any bank 
loans to be given to farmers.

1287
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,870
They made all the farmers go helpless 
and killed their hopes on these lands.

1288
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,780
Look at that old lady at the bus stop.

1289
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,320
Just like many other farmers,

1290
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:58,520
her son left to city to do labor 
having no hopes on farming.

1291
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,770
She comes here daily and 
keeps waiting for him.

1292
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,650
He won't come and her hope never dies.

1293
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:09,470
Hey Rishi, haven't you always told me?

1294
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,910
'I didn't understand then 
but now I understood'

1295
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,570
I didn't understand it then but now I did.

1296
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:18,150
This village is my strength.

1297
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:22,630
I'd rather die but wouldn't 
let anyone touch this village.

1298
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:28,340
You came so far to see me, 
that's enough for me.

1299
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,780
I can't come with you. You please leave.

1300
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,150
I came so far to take you with me.

1301
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,450
If at all I leave, 
I'll give what you need and then go.

1302
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,050
That isn't so easy as you think Rishi.

1303
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:50,200
It's not easy for Rishi.

1304
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,130
But there's this guy 
called CEO Rishi Kumar.

1305
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,280
It's a pleasure meeting you Mr. Rishi.

1306
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,190
It's not that you aren't aware of.

1307
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:08,990
You've come from the US.

1308
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:12,790
Such land acquisitions are common 
when development happens.

1309
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,230
But all those are agricultural lands, sir.

1310
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,800
That was once, 
no one is cultivating there now.

1311
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,460
All those are barren lands 
and are fit for nothing.

1312
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,460
And this is just beyond me, Mr. Rishi.

1313
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,690
I hope you can understand.

1314
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,340
[vehicles approaching]

1315
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:38,690
Won't you change? Won't you change at all?

1316
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:42,980
Do you know how hard am 
I working being your MP?

1317
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,570
When those Company people 
said they'll pay one lakh,

1318
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,800
I've been fighting to 
somehow pay Rs. 1,25,000.

1319
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,020
Do you at least know that?

1320
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,220
-Sir. 
-Yeah.

1321
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,920
Sir, Rs. 1,25,000 is too less.

1322
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,680
They're paying six Lakhs per 
acre in the neighbouring village.

1323
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,350
You wait man.

1324
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,720
Look, I'm telling you right away.

1325
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,770
Either you agree or don't, those 
Company guys will dig the whole village.

1326
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,390
What's this... 
when some rich man comes into the village,

1327
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,210
will you say everything 
that happened in the village?

1328
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,370
About whom are you talking?

1329
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:10,490
Some rich man came to meet 
your son-in-law, right?

1330
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:11,630
My son-in-law?

1331
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,840
Isn't that guy in the tent, 
your son-in-law?

1332
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,240
-That was once upon a time, sir. 
-Then, what about now?

1333
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:20,410
When his dad died for what he did, 
I and this entire village exiled him.

1334
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:23,800
He is playing dirty games to 
get close to us all again.

1335
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,200
Sir...

1336
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,100
We're talking about you, sir. Why did you 
take the trouble coming to this village?

1337
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,880
That's why I have come to meet you, sir.

1338
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,720
Hey old man, come here.

1339
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,980
Come here. Stand here. 
Can you identify sir?

1340
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,660
Who is he, sir?

1341
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,760
You can't identify, go.

1342
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,660
That's the matter, sir. Sir, you will 
have a crazy following in the city.

1343
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:02,560
But nobody knows you in this village.

1344
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,000
Sir, 
this is very deep than what you think.

1345
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:09,670
See you, sir.

1346
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:13,950
Sir, you look fair like an English Lord.

1347
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,060
Sir, it's too hot here in the village, 
careful, sir.

1348
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:21,410
Hey Saibabu, Rs. 1,25,000 is fixed.

1349
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,990
Rishi Kumar to meet the CM.

1350
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:30,270
After stating this as a personal trip, 
why is Rishi Kumar meeting the CM?

1351
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:32,170
On what topics is he going to discuss?

1352
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:34,120
I understand what you say, Mr. Rishi.

1353
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,340
But it's not the local Government, 
who gave the clearance for this project.

1354
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,820
Everyone here in India 
have a misconception.

1355
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:43,410
They think all this power 
is in Politicians hands.

1356
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:44,800
But that's not the reality.

1357
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,300
Politicians don't rule India.

1358
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,230
Corporates... Corporates rule India.

1359
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,970
Just think...

1360
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:57,050
When the natural resources found in 
this state are going to another state,

1361
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,500
we couldn't do anything 
than just keep watching.

1362
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:02,320
We are helpless

1363
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:07,330
But, only one man can 
help you with this matter.

1364
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,500
Who is that, sir?

1365
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:11,210
Vivek Mittal.

1366
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:12,980
Vivek Mittal...

1367
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,330
You mean the Trident group Chairman?

1368
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:16,620
Hmm...

1369
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,530
Sitting in Mumbai, 
he can turn the cards anywhere in India.

1370
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,850
Sir, Mr. Rishi Kumar is here.

1371
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,810
Ah!

1372
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,530
-Mr. Rishi Kumar. 
-Hello, sir.

1373
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,820
Please, come. What an inspiration!

1374
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,580
From nowhere to somewhere.

1375
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,080
Thank you, sir. 
Even no one knows about you.

1376
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:59,020
Mr. Vivek Mittal, one of the 
leading Corporate kings in India.

1377
01:37:59,280 --> 01:37:59,940
Thank you.

1378
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:01,780
What can I do for you, Mr. Rishi?

1379
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:06,150
-A small obligation. 
-Please say, Mr. Rishi. But...

1380
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:13,730
...a village named 
Ramavaram and a friend there

1381
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,380
and should leave that one village for him.

1382
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,160
Except that.

1383
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:22,480
Mr. Rishi, this is my decision board.

1384
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,330
Any of my dreams is before 
coming on to this board only.

1385
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:30,620
Once it enters on to this board, 
no one can change that.

1386
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:37,510
If I let go just this one village, 
there are 83 villages on the way.

1387
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:42,830
It's a ten billion dollar project, 
which is around 75,000 crores.

1388
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,700
But still Mr. Rishi, you're such a 
big man. You take away your friend.

1389
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,380
Give him a good life.

1390
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:52,980
I already told him sir, 
he isn't listening.

1391
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,920
I don't care how many thousands 
of crores you've invested

1392
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,310
and how many villages are going.

1393
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:03,680
I told him that, 
I'll give this one to him.

1394
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:06,910
Leave this one village.

1395
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:11,610
-It isn't possible Mr. Rishi. 
-It should be Mr. Vivek.

1396
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:13,100
What if it is not possible?

1397
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:16,230
Your dream will be left 
behind like a dream.

1398
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:24,120
Mr. Rishi, this is a national 
project and everything is legal.

1399
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,230
No, Mr. Vivek.

1400
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:29,850
This is your personal project and 
there is nothing legal about it.

1401
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,310
Cost of this project isn't 70,000 
crores but just 50,000 crores.

1402
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,140
You have overestimated the project by 50%,

1403
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,360
to make the Government invest 
more and for you to invest less.

1404
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,190
And...

1405
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,560
Just 33 out of these 83 
villages have voluntarily agreed

1406
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:47,500
and rest of the 50 villages 
were grabbed by force.

1407
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,020
This is not a national project.

1408
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,230
This is your personal project and 
everything is illegal about it Mr. Vivek.

1409
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:59,200
Wow! Do you think the 
Government isn't aware of all this?

1410
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,590
Or do you think that the 
opposition doesn't know about this,

1411
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,110
who is ready to jump in on 
Government's mistakes?

1412
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:05,880
Everyone knows about it 
but none would speak.

1413
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,350
When we step in somewhere, 
we make the world go away from there.

1414
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:14,570
Leave all that, 
your friend is there right?

1415
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:18,530
He's sitting alone in the tent. 
Is anyone behind him?

1416
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:22,670
There'd be none because 
they got habituated.

1417
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:26,000
No, we made it a habit.

1418
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:27,620
Habit...

1419
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:28,460
Huh!

1420
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:31,920
Habits change Mr. Vivek. I'll change them.

1421
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:38,050
I'll change their habits 
and your habits too.

1422
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,180
Careful, Rishi.

1423
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,560
I think you just have the 
habit of winning till now.

1424
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:49,360
Make a habit of losing from now.

1425
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:52,930
[chuckles]

1426
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,320
I told my mom, in my childhood.

1427
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:00,600
And I'm telling just you after that

1428
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,700
I have a fear of losing.

1429
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,800
I reached this far with that fear.

1430
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,690
You've introduced that fear to me again.

1431
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,350
Get ready Mr. Vivek... [snaps fingers]

1432
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,710
...to turn down that board.

1433
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,560
[phone ringing]

1434
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:35,820
Rishi, please tell me, 
you are coming back.

1435
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,570
It'll take time for me to come back.

1436
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:39,550
But Rishi, 
your appointments and meetings...

1437
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,290
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

1438
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,830
I'm opening an office in India.

1439
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,460
All my operations will be from here.

1440
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,850
Whoever wants to meet me or if there 
is any appointment divert them here.

1441
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,170
Where in India?

1442
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,430
Ramavaram.

1443
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,220
Why helicopter has come to our village?

1444
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:37,120
"Can anyone stop the rising tide?"

1445
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:45,280
"Can anyone stop the lightning thunder?"

1446
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:51,220
"Does Chanakya..."

1447
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:54,980
"...have a defeat ever 
in the game of chess?"

1448
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:59,360
"Does the thought that steps ahead,"

1449
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,170
"have any step back ever?"

1450
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:07,050
"Passing through the cyclone wind and 
laying a path like a shooted arrow"

1451
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,210
"It has started again"

1452
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:13,310
"Come on, my friend"

1453
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:17,300
"It has started again"

1454
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,430
"Come on, my friend"

1455
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:31,610
[music]

1456
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:35,140
What's your name?

1457
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,150
Sir, he is mute. He can't talk.

1458
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:44,880
Hey, press reporters are going that side, 
tell them that I'm here.

1459
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:48,010
They didn't come for you, sir. 
[chopper chuffs]

1460
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:50,360
What's happening here?

1461
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:54,690
Rishi Kumar starts his office in 
the remote village, Ramavaram.

1462
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:57,430
What are the reasons to start the 
office here, leaving New York?

1463
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:00,390
Ramavaram turns into a Global 
village with Rishi Kumar's arrival.

1464
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:04,630
A village that doesn't have a proper 
bus stand has got a chopper stand now.

1465
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,300
What our channel said came true now that,

1466
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,640
Rishi Kumar came to India 
to invest 6000 crores.

1467
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,450
News 100, the real news.

1468
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,370
What is this?

1469
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:21,760
If that's your tent, this is my tent.

1470
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,120
Sir, you got a call.

1471
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:30,820
[music]

1472
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:35,200
"If darkness is the word 
that says light isn't there,"

1473
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,980
"then there isn't anything like the night"

1474
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:43,370
"When you have the zeal to struggle,"

1475
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:47,050
"there is no place for defeat"

1476
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,130
"Will the speed of Arjuna..."

1477
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:55,170
"...without getting wet 
in the rain stop at all?"

1478
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:58,930
"Standing still and fighting 
back is stated as the victory"

1479
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:01,160
"It has started again"

1480
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:05,140
"Come on, my friend"

1481
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,260
-"It has started again" 
-Sir, sir!

1482
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,100
[indistinct Voices]

1483
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:12,150
Sir, tell us about where are you 
going to invest the 6000 crores.

1484
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:14,700
It's News 100. 
Don't you have respect for it?

1485
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,900
Sir, 
it's media and the pressure is building.

1486
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:19,830
-If you can speak for once... 
-What's your duty, Ramakrishna?

1487
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:23,900
I know when to speak with them. 
There's still time for that

1488
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,330
Sir, it seems Rishi Kumar 
opened his office in Ramavaram.

1489
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:30,860
Huh! Circus companies come and put 
up their tents in the villages.

1490
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,520
They take them out after ten days, 
this is similar too.

1491
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,220
Just leave it.

1492
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:38,920
We started off as a small 
Software Company in Hyderabad

1493
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,520
and developed into a leading 
gaming Company in Asia.

1494
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:44,440
But that isn't enough. 
We need to spread our wings.

1495
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,150
This fellow has started it again.

1496
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,440
We all have got a good chance for that.

1497
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:53,950
You all would've known that Mr. Rishi 
Kumar has opened his office in India.

1498
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:57,570
Pooja, 
I'm already trying for his appointment.

1499
01:45:58,050 --> 01:46:01,150
Once I get the appointment, as a team 
leader you should go and meet him.

1500
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:04,220
No, sir, I won't go. I'm sorry.

1501
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,920
Hey Pooja, Pooja...

1502
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,840
Maybe you don't know Sir. 
But Rishi Kumar and Pooja had a bad past.

1503
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:15,130
Sir, they had a relationship in the 
past and later on they got broke up.

1504
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:20,410
Crazy girl, you think I don't know? 
It isn't so easy to reach Rishi Kumar.

1505
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,060
The only profile I have 
got to reach him is Pooja.

1506
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:27,100
If you say so, she'd resign and go, sir.

1507
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:29,180
What about you if she resigns?

1508
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,190
-What about us, sir? 
-How many are there in your team?

1509
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,810
There are six hundred people.

1510
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:39,260
If Pooja resigns, 
your entire team will get pink slips.

1511
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:42,760
That means, 
even all of you will have to resign.

1512
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,520
Please agree.

1513
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:49,850
If you say no now, lives of 6000 
people will come onto the roads.

1514
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,190
What 6000 people? 
There are just 600 people, right?

1515
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:58,330
Huh! Do you know how many live 
on the salary of a software employee?

1516
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:04,320
Me, my mom, my dad, my brother, my maid...

1517
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:09,980
...her family, the paper guy and his 
family, the milkman and his family...

1518
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,200
Will you stop it?

1519
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,170
Please agree. I beg you.

1520
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:22,850
-Sir, did it work out? 
-Pooja is coming there as you said.

1521
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:24,670
She will be there by 
tomorrow in the morning.

1522
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,670
Sir, Pooja is here.

1523
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,040
-What do you call me? 
-Sir.

1524
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,660
-Then how should you call Pooja? 
-Madam.

1525
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:37,840
Sir, Pooja madam is here.

1526
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,310
Hi, sir.

1527
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:48,660
-How are you? 
-Hi sir, I'm Pooja.

1528
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,740
You call him 'sir'?

1529
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:54,610
Rishi.

1530
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:00,210
Ramakrishna.

1531
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:01,320
-Sir. 
-Order two coffee.

1532
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,670
I quit drinking coffee.

1533
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,610
You gulp down so many cups every day!

1534
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,890
I need to talk something 
personal with you, Pooja.

1535
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,250
-Yes, please go ahead. 
-Hey! Where are you going? Sit.

1536
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:14,360
Sit down.

1537
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:17,730
What's personal, sir?

1538
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,920
I'm sorry, Pooja.

1539
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:23,590
What are you talking about sir? 
I don't remember anything.

1540
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:27,080
I came here for a 
professional meeting and that's all.

1541
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:30,380
Professional?

1542
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:31,660
Yeah

1543
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,320
Please say, Miss. Pooja.

1544
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:42,620
Sir, actually we're from a video gaming 
company. We want to spread our wings.

1545
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:46,060
-So, we wanted to collaborate with you 
-Explain the concept and let's see.

1546
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,230
I'll stand and say, sir.

1547
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:48,200
[clears throat]

1548
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,930
-The title of the video game Blood Pool. 
-What?

1549
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:55,100
Blood Pool sir, hero's 
name is Hakuna Matata.

1550
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,860
Attack happens on the hero 
in an old ruined city

1551
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,620
when we cut the scene... 
[making gunfire sound] Stealth mode

1552
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,240
Then the helicopter attacks on the hero, 
sir.

1553
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,600
Then the hero fires... 
[making gunfire sound]

1554
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,750
Ninja blades... 
[kiai]

1555
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:14,270
Bazooka bomb blast... Three blood 
splashes, sir... [making gunfire sound]

1556
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:16,150
[panting]

1557
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:20,900
Finally, there would be as many points 
as the number of kills made by the hero.

1558
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,150
This is the concept.

1559
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,310
-How is it Ramakrishna? 
-There is no nativity in the story.

1560
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,830
There is no creativity in the concept.

1561
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,160
Violence is going high these 
days in video games, sir.

1562
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,670
Sir, where is the humanity?

1563
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,700
You said it correctly. 
What happens to kids?

1564
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,790
They will get spoilt, sir.

1565
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:41,560
You heard it. 
Encourage humanity in video games.

1566
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,020
What's humanity in a 
video game, sir? How is it sir?

1567
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,510
Develop a game on a love story.

1568
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,150
Uh?

1569
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,850
Video game on a love story? 
Sir, no one has done that till now.

1570
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:59,720
Do it now. 
Try something new.

1571
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:02,590
-There's one more thing. 
-Aah...

1572
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:05,170
-I don't like sad endings in love stories. 
-Oh...

1573
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:07,760
All the endings should be happy.

1574
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:12,030
This is the concept. 
Develop this and tell me.

1575
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,610
-Ramakrishna. 
-Sir.

1576
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:15,130
-Make arrangements for them to stay here 
-Ok, sir.

1577
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:17,680
It's not possible. 
No way I'm staying here.

1578
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:21,220
Hey Pooja! 
Pooja... Pooja...

1579
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:23,590
What happens to our lives if you do this?

1580
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,490
-My mom, my dad, my servant... 
-Will you stop it?

1581
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,930
-Enquire where's our stay. 
-In my house.

1582
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:34,700
Ravi! How are you, Ravi?

1583
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:36,200
I'm completely fine.

1584
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,680
What's all this, Ravi?

1585
01:50:38,450 --> 01:50:40,780
He won't come this far if 
he hasn't a selfish motive

1586
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:44,810
What's this office and what's this drama? 
What's happening here?

1587
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:46,330
Shall I tell you a secret?

1588
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:48,460
-What's that? 
-I don't know that either.

1589
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:51,370
But if he has come, 
he'll do something Pooja.

1590
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:53,630
I am asking you the same... 
what will he do?

1591
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,500
Rishi Kumar to address the 
media for the first time.

1592
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,650
Let's see if we will get an answer 
at least today for why Rishi Kumar,

1593
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,320
has opened his office in Ramavaram?  
[chaos]

1594
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:04,450
-Sir... Sir... 
-Sir... Sir... Sir...

1595
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:06,660
Why did you open your 
office here leaving New York?

1596
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:08,360
Is this a low-cost model, sir?

1597
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,390
Are you trying to say we 
should get back to our roots?

1598
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,290
Sir, tell them that you've come to 
invest 6000 crores. They don't get it.

1599
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:18,490
It's not what you people think, 
I came here to take my friend.

1600
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:24,520
He turned me down. That's why I 
opened an office right here for him.

1601
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,520
Did you open an office here for a friend?

1602
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,450
You wait, man.

1603
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:31,370
Sir, 
who is that friend who turned you down?

1604
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:37,310
The one who is sitting in that 
tent, Ravi. He is my friend.

1605
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,580
Sir, why did he say no to a man like you?

1606
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,010
How would I know? 
You go and ask him.

1607
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:47,540
RAMAVARAM 
VILLAGE REBELLION COMMITTEE

1608
01:51:58,630 --> 01:51:59,860
He is the one, sir.

1609
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
What man, are you Ravi?

1610
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:06,890
Yes, sir.

1611
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:09,750
-Is Rishi Kumar your friend? 
-Why sir, shouldn't he be?

1612
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,490
He says you turned him down when 
he asked you to come to America.

1613
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:12,550
Yes, sir.

1614
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:16,010
As you turned his offer down, 
he has opened an office right here, right?

1615
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:19,020
Is it, sir? 
I didn't know till you informed me.

1616
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,920
Don't you feel like going when such a 
big personality like him is calling you?

1617
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,700
Who won't I feel like going 
when such a person asks?

1618
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:26,870
Then why didn't you go?

1619
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,530
Well, how can I go 
leaving this village and house?

1620
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:33,140
Aren't all people who go to America 
leaving their village and houses?

1621
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,380
If you know that your village and house 
won't be there by the time you come back,

1622
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:37,690
will you go?

1623
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:43,480
I won't go. 
I won't leave this village at all.

1624
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:47,460
Is a village just about of a few 
walls and trees to dig it down?

1625
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:52,020
Village means some lives and 
a house means some memories.

1626
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:56,100
Ravi Shankar says 'my 
village and my house'

1627
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:00,040
Ravishankar says that he will not to leave 
Ramavaram even at the cost of his life.

1628
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,810
Will the lonely fight of 
Ravishankar bear fruit at least now?

1629
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:06,900
Ravishankar protesting 
there from six months...

1630
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:09,870
Hey, Ravi is sitting there 
in the tent without any work.

1631
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,960
We are sitting here in the 
tea stall without any work.

1632
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:14,500
Then why's this media is 
covering him instead of us?

1633
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:16,300
-He might've bribed them. 
-I'll kill you rascals!

1634
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,050
He's doing so much for the 
village, and you talk rubbish!

1635
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:24,830
Pals, there is no meaning to our lives 
if we don't sit behind him now at least.

1636
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:25,920
Come.

1637
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:34,030
"Though the fireflies are tiny, 
won't they light up the whole forest?"

1638
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:37,990
"Won't the ants being so 
tiny defeat the snake?"

1639
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:42,200
"Though stars are tiny, won't 
they fill the sky with colours?"

1640
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:46,190
"Though wings are so tiny, 
won't they dictate over the directions?"

1641
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:50,250
"Isn't the song of Cuckoo 
in the branches..."

1642
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:54,200
"...call for a new dawn?"

1643
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:57,950
"Sound of your fist is the 
awakening lesson for the world"

1644
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:00,380
"It has started again"

1645
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:04,180
"Come on, my friend"

1646
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:05,830
Hey old man!

1647
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,240
-Come and sit. 
-"It has started again"

1648
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,380
"Come on, my friend"

1649
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,810
They said the village exiled Ravi once.

1650
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,970
But now that entire village 
is sitting behind him.

1651
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:20,930
That's what.

1652
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:23,110
Did you hear that?

1653
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,900
You said what'll Rishi do, right? 
See what he did now.

1654
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:28,500
Will you stop it?

1655
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,880
Did you listen or see it? 
First mind the business we are here for.

1656
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,430
Okay.

1657
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,170
[blows whistle]

1658
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,320
Do you know the son of that old lady?

1659
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,980
He's from here and we grew up together.

1660
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,060
Why don't you call him once?

1661
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:55,100
He won't lift any call from this 
village, neither would he come.

1662
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:05,970
Hey...

1663
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,880
Isn't she Pallavi?

1664
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:16,670
Go, dude.

1665
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:21,860
[music]

1666
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:36,090
Please Ravi, take me away from here.

1667
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,440
Pallavi, you know that I 
can't come out of this village.

1668
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:41,750
My engagement is in the next two days.

1669
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:45,810
I won't be alive if that happens, Ravi.

1670
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,770
Pallavi, how do I explain it to you?

1671
01:55:58,210 --> 01:55:59,860
Haven't I already told 
you not to meet her?

1672
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,510
I'll kill you if you look at her again.

1673
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,350
Come

1674
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:17,590
What brings you here?

1675
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:21,780
Nothing, sir. 
I came to see the village and saw you.

1676
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:24,400
Isn't the rice mill running?

1677
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,810
How will the rice mill run 
when there are no crops?

1678
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:30,860
I have a doubt since long, sir.

1679
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:34,390
Does this paddy have 
more value or rice?

1680
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:36,460
The value of rice is more in the market.

1681
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:39,110
But in my opinion, paddy is more valuable.

1682
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:40,580
How is that, sir?

1683
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:44,700
Where does rice come 
when there is no paddy?

1684
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:49,350
You'd have been dependant once 
on this rice mill, right sir?

1685
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:51,070
You'd have run your family with this.

1686
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:53,730
You'd have got your kids educated 
with the income from this.

1687
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:59,090
Now it has become useless... 
did your love die on this?

1688
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:01,210
Why will it die?

1689
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:03,690
Then why is it dead over him, sir?

1690
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:08,730
Isn't that because he's not like 
what you thought of him then?

1691
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:13,410
Isn't it because he has done some 
mistake that you have exiled him?

1692
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:16,370
I'm the result of his mistake, sir.

1693
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:22,210
You just said there is no 
rice without this paddy.

1694
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:24,070
I don't exist without him.

1695
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,250
He's witnessed my victory even 
before the world did, sir.

1696
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,780
He put my blame onto him that day 
and gave away his life to me, sir.

1697
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:36,330
Because of that he lost his dad,

1698
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:40,770
your confidence and today he 
is losing the girl he loved.

1699
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,800
But till date, 
he never told anyone what really happened.

1700
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,080
That's him, sir.

1701
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,580
When he can do so much 
for a friend he trusted,

1702
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:53,050
how far will he go for the girl he loves?

1703
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,910
We should have the luck to have 
such a guy in our life, sir.

1704
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,950
But I don't know whether 
you have that luck or not.

1705
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:06,820
See you, sir.

1706
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:18,960
[phone ringing]

1707
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:22,750
No Pallavi, don't call me ever again.

1708
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:24,420
Look towards the temple once.

1709
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:35,050
What's this Pallavi? 
Let's stop it here. Please, go.

1710
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,000
Dad has agreed, Ravi.

1711
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:54,130
Rishi went and spoke to dad.

1712
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:06,550
Pooja!

1713
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,130
Pooja!

1714
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:10,500
Pooja!

1715
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,160
I said that day only, he'd do 
something if he's here. He did this.

1716
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,440
I thought Pallavi won't exist in my life.

1717
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:21,440
He brought her and made 
her stand beside me.

1718
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:25,100
That's him, Pooja. He's like that.

1719
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:30,100
Just believe him once again Pooja... 
you'll understand.

1720
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:39,810
If you think keeping the past in mind, 
you'd feel the present is also a mistake.

1721
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:41,650
I think he deserves a second chance Pooja.

1722
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:44,630
Oh no!

1723
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,570
She left without saying anything...

1724
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:54,500
Oh God, 
did I get a happy ending for my concept?

1725
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:06,260
"Some strange whispers within me,"

1726
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:13,440
"my heart stopped being nomadic 
and bloomed full of love"

1727
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:39,580
"Love has perched on your 
shoulder like a beautiful bird"

1728
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:44,340
"The shine of a flower basket has 
gotten into your attire"

1729
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:49,130
"Your sweet call has made me spellbound"

1730
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:53,770
"Oh girl you have built 
a home in my heart"

1731
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:58,560
"You have dampened the floor 
and drew a colourful Rangoli"

1732
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:03,540
"The spark of the end of a sickle 
has got into your sharp looks"

1733
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:08,240
"Turmeric painted to the door threshold 
has touched like your naughty kiss"

1734
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:13,100
"My heart has taken a turn towards you"

1735
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:17,810
"Oh boy you have built a home in my heart"

1736
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:22,850
"You've drove away off all my shyness"

1737
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:57,500
"While your body is shooting 
arrows like a bow,"

1738
02:01:57,670 --> 02:02:02,150
"My eyes flared up like 
a matchstick on hay"

1739
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:06,940
"While the rose thorns in 
your words are pricking"

1740
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:11,740
"I couldn't sleep at night 
like a smoked up beehive"

1741
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:16,250
"Your waist is like a string of jasmine"

1742
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:21,380
"And my heart is like a 
dragonfly embracing it"

1743
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:26,220
"You have slowly tossed new dreams"

1744
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:31,060
"Oh girl you have built 
a home in my heart"

1745
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:35,860
"You have dampened the floor 
and drew a colourful Rangoli"

1746
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:40,760
"Love has perched on your 
shoulder like a beautiful bird"

1747
02:02:40,950 --> 02:02:45,470
"The shine of a flower basket has 
gotten into your attire"

1748
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:50,300
"Your sweet call has made me spellbound"

1749
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,950
"Oh boy you have built 
a home in my heart"

1750
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:59,850
"You've drove away off all my shyness"

1751
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:24,810
Hey, that Subbarayudu is 
coming again with men.

1752
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:28,140
We shall finish those idiots. 
What are you seeing? Come on get up.

1753
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:30,290
[chaos]

1754
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:51,270
They are from the 
neighbouring village, sir.

1755
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:54,240
People of both these villages always 
fight for the water for crops it seems.

1756
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:03,520
We fought so long within ourselves to live

1757
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:05,880
Now someone came to ruin our lives

1758
02:04:06,110 --> 02:04:08,470
We sat silent helplessly all these days.

1759
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:13,540
But you alone have screamed 
aloud and opposed them.

1760
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:16,630
If you agree, we will stand behind you.

1761
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:20,810
From now, 
this protest belongs to all of us.

1762
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:26,130
Corwd: It belongs to us all...

1763
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:29,230
[music]

1764
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:36,430
The protest that was limited 
to just one village till now,

1765
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:39,160
due to the gathering of so many 
villages that might get ruined,

1766
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:42,030
support to Ravishankar of Ramavaram 
has increased heavily.

1767
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:45,650
Whom does the Government support now, 
is it the public or Vivek Mittal?

1768
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:49,750
Sir, call from the Central Minister, 
Mr. Murthy.

1769
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,320
Tell me, sir.

1770
02:04:53,590 --> 02:04:55,920
That Ramavaram matter is 
getting serious day by day.

1771
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:59,990
Handle it carefully before 
the matter goes to the head.

1772
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,530
Otherwise, 
the total project will be in jeopardy

1773
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:37,120
-Sir... Sir... 
-Media is on this side.

1774
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:39,120
-Mr. Vivek. 
-Sir, please...

1775
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:44,420
-Hi Rishi. 
-Welcome, Mr. Vivek.

1776
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:46,720
Please.

1777
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:49,860
Hmm!

1778
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:51,440
Good game Rishi!

1779
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:53,040
I never imagined.

1780
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,050
This was the idea given by you, Mr. Vivek.

1781
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,980
You said you have driven 
the world away from here.

1782
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,760
See now, I have brought 
the world right here.

1783
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,760
Ok, I'll let go of this 
one village as you asked.

1784
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:07,810
Huh! Not possible.

1785
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:10,280
The count has increased.

1786
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:13,120
41

1787
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:15,600
What?

1788
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,920
Look at that tent once.

1789
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:25,670
That day you said he 
sat alone in the tent.

1790
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:27,570
See how many are sitting behind him now.

1791
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,460
Now, I'm asking for all of them.

1792
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:32,980
Before the count increases... 41 villages

1793
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,830
Leave them!

1794
02:06:34,850 --> 02:06:35,940
[laughs]

1795
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,960
Impossible.

1796
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:40,170
You said not possible once 
sitting in an AC room,

1797
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:42,120
and now you're sitting under a tree.

1798
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:48,100
If you say not possible again, just 
imagine where'd you go and sit.

1799
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:53,750
Till date, 
I wanted to win with a fear to lose.

1800
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:57,610
For the first time, 
I feel like winning with love on victory.

1801
02:06:58,170 --> 02:07:01,460
Thank you, Mr. Vivek, 
for turning my fear into love.

1802
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,110
It was nice meeting you again Mr. Rishi.

1803
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:10,650
Sir... Sir... Sir... [chaos]

1804
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:13,210
Have you come to talk about 6000 
crores deal with Mr. Rishi Kumar,

1805
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,080
or to talk about the problem of 
the village? [camera clicks]

1806
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,020
Sir. 
[indistinct voices]

1807
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,050
Sir, please say something. 
We'll telecast a breaking news.

1808
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:22,840
Hey! Sir is coming. 
Get ready with the breaking news.

1809
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,720
-Sir... Sir... Sir... 
-Sir, this is cheating.

1810
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:33,050
Excuse me, Mr. Vivek...

1811
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:49,220
I'm really sorry.

1812
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,940
It wasn't my intention to bring it so far.

1813
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:55,500
There'd be so many in between you 
and us and we keep believing them.

1814
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,100
Why did he push it over us?

1815
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,670
How much did we quote per acre, 
Mr. MP?

1816
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:00,010
Rs. 1,25,000.

1817
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,330
We'll pay four lakhs per acre.

1818
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:10,600
You get land in turn of the land 
you give, and a house for your house

1819
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:12,780
and one job per house after 
the project work starts.

1820
02:08:13,050 --> 02:08:14,680
He's Shakuni in a suit.

1821
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:17,810
-Is it okay for you, Mr. MP? 
-Why do we deny when you say so?

1822
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:19,020
This is the best deal.

1823
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:22,140
Either for you or for us.

1824
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,160
Think and tell me.

1825
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,530
We've finally won.

1826
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,020
Four lakhs per acre, we get land instead 
of land and a job for every house.

1827
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:50,460
What more do we need than this?

1828
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:53,500
Yes, we were in fear about what 
they would give all these days.

1829
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:56,140
But now, he is going to give 
more than what we expected.

1830
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,660
Yes, we won.

1831
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,760
What did we win?

1832
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:02,940
You are going to give away our 
lands when he gives four lakhs.

1833
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:05,420
Will you give away your lives 
too if he gives six lakhs?

1834
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:10,590
Hey, we buried our parents in this land, 
right?

1835
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:13,210
How would we sell this land?

1836
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:19,130
I beg you all. 
No, let's not agree for anything he asked.

1837
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:27,720
Why do you say 'my parents 
died and buried them in the same land'?

1838
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:29,980
They say your dad died because of you, 
didn't he?

1839
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:32,640
Hey, 
if you say another word about my father...

1840
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,790
I will.

1841
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:40,600
What will you do?

1842
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:42,200
Huh!

1843
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:44,460
Hmm!

1844
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,630
What will you do?

1845
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:50,980
What will you do?

1846
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,800
He's my son-in-law

1847
02:10:10,130 --> 02:10:11,960
If you lay a han on him...

1848
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:14,450
I'll cut you into pieces

1849
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,380
Hmm! Yes, we've come here to be cut

1850
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:24,030
We are being treated badly as 
we came and sat by ourselves.

1851
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:26,870
Why should we let you 
decide on our behalf?

1852
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,170
We'll take our own decisions

1853
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:31,710
Hey, sit in this tent if you want to beg,

1854
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:35,130
come with me if you wish to live better.

1855
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:42,530
Hey don't! Please stop. I beg you all!

1856
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,540
How much did he give?

1857
02:10:52,050 --> 02:10:53,660
How much did he give and 
how much did you take?

1858
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:57,710
I saw the truth in your 
eyes when you came a week ago.

1859
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:00,960
That isn't there now. 
How much did he give?

1860
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,660
Why do we need any discussions with them? 
Let's go.

1861
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:13,340
Ah! What a splendid game you played, Sir!

1862
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:16,260
Half the villages moved out 
from the tent in a night

1863
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:20,010
Just half are left and they too would be 
gone after sitting for two days, Sir

1864
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:24,050
But I don't think Ravi would step back, 
I'm scared of him, Sir

1865
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:28,180
I didn't like the way he 
looked at me when I came there.

1866
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:33,300
Anyway, someone needs to die in 
a fight in between two villages.

1867
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:37,090
He's been saying he will 
die for the village anyways.

1868
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:40,430
-Let that happen 
-I got it.

1869
02:11:57,490 --> 02:12:01,560
[struggles to shout]

1870
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:10,080
[struggles to shout]

1871
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:17,040
[blows whistle]

1872
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,240
What happened?

1873
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:27,590
Hey Ravi!

1874
02:12:28,590 --> 02:12:30,550
Ravi! Ravi!

1875
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,090
Ravi!

1876
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:46,310
[cows moo]

1877
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:48,750
[cow moos]

1878
02:13:06,510 --> 02:13:08,180
Hey!

1879
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,010
Hey...

1880
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:24,260
Ravi... Ravi... Ravi!

1881
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:27,630
Ravi!

1882
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:32,930
Hey, Ravi!

1883
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,430
Hey... hey... Ravi!

1884
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:55,720
Look at me. Look at me

1885
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:58,050
Nothing will happen to you. 
Nothing will happen to you.

1886
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:02,430
Hey, I'm here. I'm here

1887
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,630
Two minutes... just two minutes.

1888
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,970
Hey, you tried to kill our village guy?

1889
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:32,760
[crowd roars]

1890
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:49,810
He is stable now.

1891
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:53,590
But, due to heavy blood loss, 
it will take some time to recover.

1892
02:17:53,930 --> 02:17:55,510
He has to be kept in 
observation for few days

1893
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:04,930
The protest that was going peacefully 
until yesterday turned violent at once.

1894
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:08,160
It is after Trident group Chairman Vivek 
Mittal visited Ramavaram village...

1895
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,510
...these incidents are taking place.

1896
02:18:09,710 --> 02:18:11,650
Will Vivek Mittal answer these questions?

1897
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:14,490
Or will he remain silent 
being called the conspirator...

1898
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:17,760
-...behind this violence. 
-Vivek Mittal called for a press meet sir.

1899
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:20,460
It has become a habit for the 
media and public in our country...

1900
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:23,040
...to blame to Corporates for everything.

1901
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,340
This project is going to 
put India on the World map

1902
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:29,050
A person came down from America 
knowing about this and asked for a share.

1903
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:30,380
He is Rishi Kumar

1904
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:32,320
CEO of Origin group.

1905
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:33,820
I denied him.

1906
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:36,300
He immediately opened an 
office in the same village...

1907
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:38,430
...and drew all your attention towards him

1908
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,630
Six months prior to his visit,

1909
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:42,750
he instigated his friend 
and made him sit in the tent

1910
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:45,430
He tried somehow to own this project.

1911
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:47,650
Later, he put up a fight 
in between the villages...

1912
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:50,440
...and made his own friend a scapegoat.

1913
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:53,800
Anyway, I have a small doubt

1914
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:57,620
Till you've started earning 
thousands of crores per annum,

1915
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:03,080
How come you didn't remember your 
forgotten friend Mr. Rishi Kumar?

1916
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:08,380
So... the real conspirator is Rishi Kumar

1917
02:19:08,630 --> 02:19:10,880
If you think all the present 
fights are about this project,

1918
02:19:11,210 --> 02:19:12,700
I'm ready to take the project back! 
[glass breaks]

1919
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:14,600
[crowd chaos]

1920
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:23,220
Come down you!

1921
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:27,340
Hey, why do you come from 
overseas and play with our lives?

1922
02:19:27,550 --> 02:19:29,830
He believed in you, 
but you risked his life?

1923
02:19:30,030 --> 02:19:31,620
What kind of human are you? Go back!

1924
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:34,550
Should we fight amongst us 
and die because of people like you?

1925
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:36,340
Go... go back from here!

1926
02:19:42,510 --> 02:19:44,380
I thought you changed, Rishi.

1927
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:47,220
You didn't change at all.

1928
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:52,340
You came into Ravi's life 
once and his career got ruined

1929
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:56,130
You came back again now, 
see what happened to him.

1930
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:59,630
Not that some guy have asked on TV,

1931
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:01,800
I'm asking you...

1932
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:05,970
Didn't you remember Ravi 
at least once in so many years?

1933
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:09,380
I still don't understand you, Rishi

1934
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:21,220
I don't know if I can say 
he's alive now because of you...

1935
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:24,050
...or he's in this 
position because of you.

1936
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,720
If you came so far for his well-being...

1937
02:20:27,130 --> 02:20:31,470
Now, I'm saying for his well-being 
Please go away from here.

1938
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:47,130
Rishi Kumar to return back to America

1939
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:51,090
We can understand by this that the 
accusations by Vivek Mittal are true.

1940
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:02,630
Rishi, what happened, son?

1941
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:04,630
We're going back to the US tomorrow, mom

1942
02:21:05,220 --> 02:21:06,220
What about the work you came for?

1943
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:09,760
That won't happen, mom

1944
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:16,680
I never expected that I'll 
see my son like a loser

1945
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:29,130
Didn't you always look at 
your dad as a loser, Rishi?

1946
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:34,090
If you leave now, 
won't you become a loser yourself too?

1947
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:39,130
You used to think how can he could 
live smiling even when he was losing.

1948
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:43,680
But in my view, 
your dad was always winning.

1949
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:48,300
You know, 
why he forced you to write Civils?

1950
02:21:50,550 --> 02:21:52,590
Your dad was a topper in Civils, Rishi.

1951
02:21:54,970 --> 02:21:58,130
If he'd given just one more interview, 
he'd have been a Collector.

1952
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:01,550
But he always wanted to serve people.

1953
02:22:02,050 --> 02:22:05,380
He joined farmers' 
protest and went along with them.

1954
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:09,760
Cops filed a case against your dad due to 
the fight that took place at the protest.

1955
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:14,300
Court issued a Memo stating that he is 
barred from getting any Government job.

1956
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,420
To take care of us,

1957
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:20,980
He who had to become a Collector, 
joined as a clerk.

1958
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,930
Even then he never lost 
the smile on his face.

1959
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:31,090
If he was alive today, 
the smile would have disappeared.

1960
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:35,540
Because he never wanted 
you to just win alone...

1961
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,740
...but he wanted you to take many 
people along with you and win

1962
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:45,180
If you leave today, all the people who 
live there will lose along with you.

1963
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,510
Go Rishi, go and make them win

1964
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:54,720
I know my son well.

1965
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:58,380
He never ever likes to lose.

1966
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:02,970
My husband never lost in my view.

1967
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:06,630
Even my son will never lose.

1968
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:17,970
Ramakrishna...

1969
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:19,790
Sir.

1970
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:23,300
Call to US and say it'd take 
more time for me to return

1971
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:27,510
There are still many 
things to finish here.

1972
02:23:39,130 --> 02:23:40,800
RAMAVARAM 
VILLAGE REBELLION COMMITTEE

1973
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:51,630
Why did he come back again?

1974
02:23:52,550 --> 02:23:55,880
Why do you watch the show standing 
like stones? Go and drag him out.

1975
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:07,680
Should I tell you guys again? 
He came to ruin your lives, go.

1976
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:13,910
[men shout]

1977
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:31,410
[blows whistle]

1978
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,930
You said he's into software?

1979
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:25,500
From today this village is mine...

1980
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:30,240
...and so is this problem!

1981
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:58,630
What's there to see? 
You've heard him. Let's go.

1982
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:04,180
The village is mine and so is the problem.

1983
02:26:05,130 --> 02:26:07,280
He couldn't do anything even 
when the locals believed in him.

1984
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:12,050
Now, we killed the confidence 
they had on him and their hope too.

1985
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:16,340
What can he do now? 
Leave him and he'll be gone by himself

1986
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,630
Don't know when you ate, have it son.

1987
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:47,740
Grandpa...

1988
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:53,510
-What are you doing? 
-Farming, Son.

1989
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:55,130
But everyone in the village left it, 
didn't they?

1990
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:58,470
If I too leave it... 
then what would you eat?

1991
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,430
If one has to eat... 
someone has to cultivate, right?

1992
02:28:04,470 --> 02:28:07,920
Anyway, 
they didn't leave it as they lost hope

1993
02:28:08,330 --> 02:28:09,130
...that's because they're tired.

1994
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:14,470
If they step back again on this land, 
mother earth would pull them back again.

1995
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:17,550
But someone is here to grab your land!

1996
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:20,470
Which rascal would grab my land?

1997
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:23,550
Ask him to come, this is mine

1998
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:28,130
As long as I feel this is ours, 
no one can lay a hand on this.

1999
02:28:28,930 --> 02:28:32,180
I'm born on this land 
and will die on this land

2000
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:38,300
If someone opposes and lays his hand, 
I'm not gonna keep watching son.

2001
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:39,830
Yeah!

2002
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:44,380
Grandpa!

2003
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,260
Will you teach me farming?

2004
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:55,550
I just said it son.

2005
02:28:55,800 --> 02:29:00,840
Once you step on this land, 
mother earth will drag you in.

2006
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:04,900
Come...

2007
02:29:17,050 --> 02:29:21,300
"Is it a blade of grass 
that broke the skies?"

2008
02:29:21,730 --> 02:29:25,990
"A floral drizzle on the 
face of a dry desert"

2009
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:30,850
"The suffering sea came to a 
sweet water well to quench it's thirst"

2010
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:36,050
"Even the mountain peak bent 
to kiss the mother earth"

2011
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:51,220
"Move on, sharpening your step ahead"

2012
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:56,380
"Level this forest and you'll find 
the treasure you are in search of"

2013
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:00,550
"Move on, ask this land and see"

2014
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:05,590
"This is the answer for all your questions 
asking where your victory is"

2015
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:20,240
"This is your story and your base, 
take the first step in it's path now"

2016
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:25,230
"Shout aloud that this is possible 
for you and not to anyone"

2017
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:29,310
"Move on, 
sharpening your step ahead"

2018
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:34,680
"Level this forest and you'll find 
the treasure you are in search of"

2019
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:39,220
"Move on, 
ask this land and see"

2020
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:44,130
"This is the answer for all your questions 
asking where your victory is"

2021
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:49,260
"Is it a blade of grass 
that broke the skies?"

2022
02:30:49,470 --> 02:30:54,010
"A floral drizzle on the 
face of a dry desert"

2023
02:30:54,130 --> 02:30:58,930
"The suffering sea came to a 
sweet water well to quench it's thirst"

2024
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:03,680
"Even the mountain peak bent 
to kiss the mother earth"

2025
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:15,680
Hey, you're all very lucky.

2026
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:17,880
For a land that fetches 
one or one and a half lakh

2027
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:20,480
I tried hard and got you four lakhs.

2028
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:24,880
We will pay a cheque of one and a half 
lakh now and take all the passbooks.

2029
02:31:25,050 --> 02:31:28,130
We'll pay the balance money only 
after the project is finished.

2030
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:30,970
Bathula Veerraju

2031
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:39,030
[whistle blown]

2032
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:42,060
[whistle blown again]

2033
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,180
Why is he here again?

2034
02:31:59,090 --> 02:32:00,090
Thank you

2035
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:04,090
If you sign now and give your passbooks 
to them, you will lose your lands forever.

2036
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:06,710
You heard their offer, didn't you? 
Now, listen to our offer too.

2037
02:32:07,050 --> 02:32:08,730
We need your lands for two years on lease

2038
02:32:10,300 --> 02:32:13,680
What'll you do if we give on lease for 
two years? You will make us beg?

2039
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:16,720
I'll give five Lakhs per acre

2040
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:22,430
Passbooks and the 
documents will be with you.

2041
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:25,180
But, there's just one condition

2042
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:27,960
You all have to put one signature

2043
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:30,470
See, he is again playing a trick.

2044
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,930
Why do you need the signature?

2045
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:38,680
Everyone has to cultivate their own lands. 
That's the only condition from me.

2046
02:32:46,220 --> 02:32:49,310
As per the Government rule, 
we'll give two Lakhs in cash

2047
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,070
...and the balance of 
three Lakhs as a cheque

2048
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:53,310
Those who want to live as a farmer, 
come this side.

2049
02:32:53,690 --> 02:32:54,860
If there's anyone left, go to that side.

2050
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,740
Oh my! Hey!

2051
02:32:58,110 --> 02:32:59,480
Do you have any morals?

2052
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:01,620
Did you also become like us?

2053
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:04,140
Is there any democracy at all? 
Where is democracy?

2054
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:06,970
Are you playing with their hope?

2055
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,680
Yes, I am

2056
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:16,340
He's playing to kill their hope and 
I'm playing to make them win.

2057
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:22,680
You get your rice mill ready sir, 
there's gonna be a lot of work.

2058
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:45,940
"The moving time burning in pain..."

2059
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:50,530
"...has released you 
like an arrow of reply"

2060
02:33:51,010 --> 02:33:55,500
"For the sorrow of mother 
earth's burning heart..."

2061
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:59,890
"...you are the boon of last help"

2062
02:34:00,470 --> 02:34:05,020
"Mother earth has no one to ask 
about the tears in her eyes"

2063
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:09,970
"Make her re-blossom with crops again"

2064
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:14,340
"Move on, 
move on with your plough on the shoulder"

2065
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:19,430
"Ask the earth to sprout up 
crops from its heart and move on"

2066
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:23,970
"Move on, holding the spear of light"

2067
02:34:24,050 --> 02:34:29,050
"The broken barren land will 
now give you the grains to eat"

2068
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:34,300
Sir, we don't need 5 Lakhs for an acre

2069
02:34:34,590 --> 02:34:37,010
Help us a bit to cultivate.

2070
02:34:40,130 --> 02:34:41,880
-Ramakrishna... 
-Understood, sir.

2071
02:34:49,010 --> 02:34:51,180
The old lady at the bus 
stand fell unconscious.

2072
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:53,550
They're doubtful whether 
she would live or not.

2073
02:34:58,770 --> 02:34:59,900
Hey, move

2074
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,850
Why didn't you take her to the hospital?

2075
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:11,020
She said she will not come 
anywhere till her son comes.

2076
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,480
He has started, he'll be here.

2077
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:23,810
How many times did I 
ask you to come with me?

2078
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:25,090
You won't.

2079
02:35:25,650 --> 02:35:27,710
You just stick to this village. 
Now see the result.

2080
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:31,600
You have come. So, I'll be good now.

2081
02:35:31,810 --> 02:35:34,650
Stop talking rubbish. 
We'll leave in the morning bus

2082
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:37,310
What's that? 
How will you take her when she is ill?

2083
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:41,770
Hey, don't you know that your mom 
doesn't like leaving this village?

2084
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:44,470
Hey, you left as you 
couldn't live here earlier.

2085
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:47,480
It's all good here now. 
Why don't you come back and live here?

2086
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:48,350
Stop it now!

2087
02:35:52,270 --> 02:35:54,480
What life? What's there to live here?

2088
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:57,900
The fields have just turned green 
after 5 years and you are celebrating!

2089
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:59,520
When will you realise?

2090
02:35:59,810 --> 02:36:02,350
The seeds have sprouted today 
and you get the yielding soon,

2091
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:05,100
And then? What next? What will you do?

2092
02:36:05,850 --> 02:36:07,150
You say we can live here!

2093
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:13,100
Hello sir

2094
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:15,400
I've seen you on TV sir.

2095
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:19,600
You wish to do something here. 
But that will not happen, sir.

2096
02:36:19,810 --> 02:36:21,940
-Hey, what are you talking? 
-You please wait.

2097
02:36:27,810 --> 02:36:31,980
Yes, Sir... 
Srinivas, B Sc Agriculture gold medalist.

2098
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:33,940
Farming is in my blood, sir.

2099
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:36,350
My dad was crazy about farming.

2100
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:38,270
He was dependant on it.

2101
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:40,320
and died consuming pesticide atlast.

2102
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:44,690
Don't know how the local 
pesticide work on crops,

2103
02:36:45,110 --> 02:36:46,530
...but it works great on humans sir

2104
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:49,150
Many farmers died the same way here.

2105
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:53,270
But the cameras that never looked at these 
villages then, came running as you came.

2106
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:57,230
Because the world doesn't care 
about the problems of a farmer, sir

2107
02:36:58,190 --> 02:37:01,020
A farmer has no value here, 
he doesn't even have respect atleast.

2108
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:05,350
The problem here isn't Vivek Mittal. 
If not him, someone else would come.

2109
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:08,810
The problem here is our society, sir

2110
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:14,810
Farmer has just become an item to 
show sympathy in this society sir.

2111
02:37:16,810 --> 02:37:19,600
Why do you bring life 
to their dead hope, sir?

2112
02:37:19,850 --> 02:37:21,150
Now they got hopes again.

2113
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:23,850
If that dies too, all of them 
would die of broken hearts, sir.

2114
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:30,020
At least if they are alive, 
they'd go somewhere and live like me.

2115
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:33,650
Our lives are like this sir. 
They will never change

2116
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:37,100
Leave it sir... please.

2117
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:01,150
WHEN WOULD THE FARMER SUICIDES END?

2118
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:02,370
15 FARMERS COMMIT SUICIDE

2119
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:03,670
THE VILLAGE THAT WAS HANGED WITH SUICIDES

2120
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:17,020
FARMER'S TOIL WASTED BY RAIN

2121
02:38:22,980 --> 02:38:24,840
BROKER'S RULE 
VEGETABLES HOT TO BUY AND PAINFUL TO SELL

2122
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:31,600
Sir, the old lady passed away.

2123
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:39,270
I've been into farming from 70 years.

2124
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:41,850
Farmer was the King those days

2125
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:44,870
Now the same farmer 
isn't good even as a labor

2126
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:48,690
They say it isn't good for 
the house when a girl cries

2127
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:53,100
Then how is it good for the 
nation if a farmer cries?

2128
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:02,310
Rishi Kumar calls in for a 
press meet again in Ramavaram

2129
02:39:02,550 --> 02:39:04,710
Rishi Kumar who transformed 
into a new role of a farmer

2130
02:39:04,910 --> 02:39:08,620
raked up interest in everyone about what 
he's going to talk in the press meet now

2131
02:39:17,650 --> 02:39:18,730
What sir?

2132
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:20,810
You've setup a press meet in the fields 
as if you didn't find any other place?

2133
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:23,770
-Why did you actually start farming? 
-What is the reason, sir?

2134
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:25,230
What's this drama?

2135
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:27,810
What is the relation 
between you and agriculture?

2136
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:35,060
I used to think the same sitting somewhere 
in the 70th floor in Manhattan, New York.

2137
02:39:36,650 --> 02:39:38,310
About what I have to do with agriculture?

2138
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:40,310
But I understood only 
after I stepped on this land

2139
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:44,000
that everyone living on this earth 
has a relation with agriculture

2140
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:46,790
From a Billionaire who has 
bread and jam for breakfast...

2141
02:39:46,990 --> 02:39:48,520
...to the poor who eats rice porridge

2142
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:52,020
everyone who needs food to live 
has a relation with agriculture

2143
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:56,190
But we are all living without any relation 
with the farmer who is cultivating for us.

2144
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:59,650
What relation Sir? Farmer is doing 
his job and we are doing ours

2145
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:02,190
Does that mean the farmer 
and we are the same, sir?

2146
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:04,630
Either it's a farmer or us, 
isn't it for money that we work sir?

2147
02:40:04,850 --> 02:40:06,730
Money! 
[chuckles]

2148
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:09,270
What'll you do if your salary isn't 
paid for two months, sir?

2149
02:40:09,310 --> 02:40:11,020
We will withdraw from 
our savings and spend it

2150
02:40:11,150 --> 02:40:13,190
What if your Company doesn't 
pay your salary for six months?

2151
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:15,190
We resign that job and 
search for another job

2152
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:17,440
What is our situation, 
if the farmer thinks the same way, sir?

2153
02:40:19,690 --> 02:40:23,440
We come on to roads and protest 
if our salary isn't hiked every two years.

2154
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:25,220
But the Farmer,

2155
02:40:25,430 --> 02:40:28,980
Even if he is or isn't profited for years 
together with the crop that he has sown,

2156
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:34,150
He keeps searching for his life in 
every seed he sows in hope of succeeding

2157
02:40:36,310 --> 02:40:38,440
How can such a farmer and we be the same, 
sir?

2158
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:41,750
So what do you say now, sir?

2159
02:40:41,950 --> 02:40:44,230
Do you want us to change our attire 
and get into the fields to cultivate?

2160
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:47,690
Farming isn't so easy as 
changing an attire, sir

2161
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:50,560
It's a beautiful relationship 
between man and earth

2162
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:52,980
This is a science which even 
the scientists can't understand

2163
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:55,730
Only a farmer can understand that

2164
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:59,310
We don't even care when 
such a farmer commits suicide.

2165
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:03,060
That has just become a 
casual news in daily news paper.

2166
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:07,650
We don't even understand the loss 
that occurs when a farmer dies

2167
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:11,940
The number of cultivators is coming down 
and the number of food consumers is rising

2168
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:16,190
Hence along with the price hikes in the 
market, adulteration is also on the rise.

2169
02:41:16,850 --> 02:41:20,400
If this continues similarly, the wealth 
you'd give your children in the future...

2170
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:23,310
won't be enough even for 
their hospital expenses.

2171
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,730
Price of land is growing and 
the value of farmer is coming down.

2172
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:34,240
If we go on constructing buildings 
as the price of land is growing,

2173
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:36,130
What would we eat to live?

2174
02:41:37,810 --> 02:41:40,520
That's why no farmer wishes 
to make his son a farmer.

2175
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:44,150
Already our generation 
doesn't know what agriculture is.

2176
02:41:45,350 --> 02:41:49,400
The future generations will see 
agriculture only in the history books

2177
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:52,350
The farmer once used to live with courage

2178
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:55,350
but now, the farmer is living in fear.

2179
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:58,350
He is scared to sow a crop not 
knowing if he'd have enough water.

2180
02:41:58,850 --> 02:42:01,310
If there is water, 
he is scared if he could reap the crop.

2181
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:04,060
If he reaps it, 
he is scared how to protect it.

2182
02:42:04,650 --> 02:42:09,440
With the same fear, he's selling off 
his crops even at a throwaway price.

2183
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,810
The buyer is selling the same for 
ten times the buying price in the market.

2184
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:15,640
So, the person who grows food is losing...

2185
02:42:16,330 --> 02:42:17,340
The food consumer...

2186
02:42:17,650 --> 02:42:19,400
[sighs] 
That's us.

2187
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:21,770
We too are losing.

2188
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:25,310
Do you know why all of this is happening?

2189
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:30,400
Because we're living without 
any relation with the farmer

2190
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:32,980
Are you posing these questions 
to the Government?

2191
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:37,350
No... to all of us

2192
02:42:38,810 --> 02:42:41,400
Who is Government? 
Isn't it us?

2193
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:45,340
Responsibility to safeguard the 
farmer isn't just the Government's job...

2194
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:47,880
...but of everyone living on this earth, 
including me.

2195
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:52,580
That's why to safeguard that farmer...

2196
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:57,720
I'm giving away 90% of my income 
towards farmers welfare.

2197
02:43:05,130 --> 02:43:07,440
CM Sir, I hope you're watching this.

2198
02:43:07,650 --> 02:43:09,400
One warehouse in every village,

2199
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:11,930
one cold storage in 
every Mandal headquarters

2200
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:14,650
I've made a project report 
ready to construct all these

2201
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:16,650
I hope we can do it, sir.

2202
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:22,230
From now on every farmer should sell 
his crops with courage and not in fear

2203
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:25,770
Why should the farmer who grows 
the crop face trouble to sell it?

2204
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:28,650
This isn't a favour 
we're doing to the farmer

2205
02:43:29,060 --> 02:43:30,760
but a favour we're doing for ourselves.

2206
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:35,400
I'm not doing all this with sympathy 
towards farmer, but with respect.

2207
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:41,020
Farmers don't need our sympathy, they need 
our respect and we owe them that respect

2208
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:50,520
[claps]

2209
02:43:51,470 --> 02:43:53,650
You looked to us like an American 
when you opened the office here.

2210
02:43:53,890 --> 02:43:55,220
But now you look like an Indian

2211
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:56,940
How do we look at you, sir?

2212
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:01,440
Have no doubts sir, I'm an Indian.

2213
02:44:02,650 --> 02:44:05,480
I too was born here and 
grew up here like you all.

2214
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:09,560
I am a local just like you.

2215
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:13,810
It is not CEO Rishi Kumar 
who spoke with you till now

2216
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:17,480
K. Rishi Kumar son of K. Satyanarayana.

2217
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:34,020
He reminded me 
that I'm a farmer's son again.

2218
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:36,850
Rishi Kumar creates a sensation.

2219
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:40,280
He donates 90% of his income...

2220
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:43,700
...that is appriximately 7000 
Crores for farmers' welfare.

2221
02:44:46,310 --> 02:44:50,770
Netizens extending huge 
support to Rishi Kumar.

2222
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:55,700
Only an honest person will 
have the right to question.

2223
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:58,080
That's why Rishi Kumar 
questioned us straight.

2224
02:44:58,690 --> 02:45:02,400
Farmer should be very happy for 
small-time vendors like us to live.

2225
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,810
Food consumers are increasing

2226
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:07,190
Hence along with the price hikes in the 
market, adulteration is also on the rise.

2227
02:45:08,770 --> 02:45:11,150
We have two thousand flats 
in our community only.

2228
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:12,660
That means just our community consumes...

2229
02:45:12,810 --> 02:45:18,330
...an average of 50,000 kgs of rice 
and 60,000 litres of milk per month.

2230
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:22,060
Added are the vegetables, salt and 
cereals we buy in the supermarkets.

2231
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:25,940
Every family is spending about Rs.10000 
approximately per month over these

2232
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:30,770
So, we are spending about 2 Crores per 
month just in our community on these

2233
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:34,440
Spending so much, we don't know whether 
what we buy are good or adulterated.

2234
02:45:34,650 --> 02:45:35,690
If this continues...

2235
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:40,530
as Rishi Kumar said, our wealth won't be 
enough for our children's hospital expense

2236
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:43,620
With the amount we spend, 
we can adopt some villages...

2237
02:45:43,960 --> 02:45:46,810
...and purchase all these 
groceries directly from the farmers.

2238
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:51,270
By that, we can save our 
money as well as our health.

2239
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,770
What Rishi Kumar said is absolutely right.

2240
02:45:53,850 --> 02:45:57,110
With immediate effect add 
farming classes to our curriculum

2241
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:59,280
and take kids on farming trips too.

2242
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:04,020
So, basically, habituate farming as a 
lifestyle to them rather than a lesson.

2243
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:06,100
Every weekend, we've been 
enjoying on the name of parties.

2244
02:46:06,270 --> 02:46:09,190
If we party just on Friday and go 
for farming on Saturday and Sunday,

2245
02:46:09,420 --> 02:46:11,460
We could learn something! 
And it's for our own good.

2246
02:46:11,730 --> 02:46:14,020
So, you are saying agriculture weekend?

2247
02:46:14,230 --> 02:46:16,400
Yes, you're right. Weekend agriculture.

2248
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:30,850
"Wouldn't this change in 
you turn into a sensation?"

2249
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:35,900
"Won't this story starting as 
a raindrop turn into a flood?"

2250
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:40,380
"With the disturbance that 
is a result of your force"

2251
02:46:40,830 --> 02:46:45,030
"Your journey starts as a 
victory and turns into a history"

2252
02:46:45,330 --> 02:46:50,020
"After knowing your goal 
is their hope and for them"

2253
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:54,840
"They'd shout aloud you're 
their destiny and saviour"

2254
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:59,190
"Move on, 
this is a new life for your past"

2255
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:04,400
"This is the right depth for your heights, 
open the first door and move on"

2256
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:08,810
"Move on, you're everyone's story"

2257
02:47:08,850 --> 02:47:14,310
"Your schooling the future in a right way"

2258
02:47:30,330 --> 02:47:31,520
-Ramakrishna 
-Sir.

2259
02:47:31,650 --> 02:47:33,440
-Order two Coffee 
-Ok sir.

2260
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:46,020
-Hello Sir. 
-Hi Rishi.

2261
02:47:46,850 --> 02:47:47,350
Please...

2262
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:51,020
Rishi proved what we could do, 
if we feel government is nothing but us.

2263
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:56,520
I never expected such a day will come 
in my 40 years of political career.

2264
02:47:57,690 --> 02:48:01,230
Not just the young generation, 
but Rishi inspired even our generation.

2265
02:48:01,310 --> 02:48:05,020
Sir, he started all this for this village. 
Will this village remain or not?

2266
02:48:06,350 --> 02:48:07,730
I'm here to say that only...

2267
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:13,400
This village won't be lost. 
It'll stay intact.

2268
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:20,600
We're appointing a commission to decide 
whether this project should proceed or not

2269
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:28,730
Didn't I tell you that he's do 
something now that he is here?

2270
02:48:29,980 --> 02:48:31,690
-Great work Rishi 
-Thank you, Sir.

2271
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:47,240
[sighs sarcastically]

2272
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:52,020
It took four years to 
kill their confidence.

2273
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:56,190
He gave back the same confidence 
to them in just four months.

2274
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:57,320
[message tone]

2275
02:48:57,810 --> 02:48:59,460
Hey, switch on the TV man!

2276
02:48:59,570 --> 02:49:00,890
This isn't a National Project.

2277
02:49:01,230 --> 02:49:04,690
It's Vivek Mittal's personal project. 
He's a financial fraud

2278
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:08,480
He's using this project as a guarantee 
to escape from his debts.

2279
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:12,920
He has taken about 70,000 
crores from National Banks as loans

2280
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:14,160
...and hasn't repaid them till now.

2281
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:17,750
As a Director of International bank, 
I have all the evidences

2282
02:49:18,270 --> 02:49:19,600
and I've already 
submitted them to the court

2283
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:22,540
Such financial criminals 
should be punished stringently.

2284
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:24,600
Otherwise it's dangerous 
for Indian economy.

2285
02:49:25,900 --> 02:49:28,090
We're from Enforcement Directorate, 
Mr. Vivek.

2286
02:49:28,350 --> 02:49:29,780
We have to take you under our custody

2287
02:49:32,770 --> 02:49:34,270
It was nice meeting you, sir

2288
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:37,600
Let it be, why shake hands before them?

2289
02:49:38,110 --> 02:49:40,440
-Will meet again 
-We won't meet again.

2290
02:49:41,350 --> 02:49:42,150
Thank you, sir

2291
02:49:42,690 --> 02:49:44,730
Why are you still here? 
Want to go with them?

2292
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:46,090
-Come on 
-No Sir, I'm coming

2293
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:49,020
Mr. Vivek, shall we go now?

2294
02:49:51,970 --> 02:49:52,870
[sighs]

2295
02:49:53,770 --> 02:49:59,330
That day... 
I should've left just that one village.

2296
02:50:01,690 --> 02:50:06,270
Vivek Mittal to ED custody, 
court permits for 15 days remand

2297
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:11,810
I should've come long back Rishi. 
But it took time to collect the evidence

2298
02:50:12,230 --> 02:50:14,310
I remained as a bad part 
in your success story

2299
02:50:15,730 --> 02:50:17,460
But I want to be a 
good part of your future

2300
02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:20,460
I got the chance now.

2301
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:22,360
I'm sorry Rishi.

2302
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:39,600
-See you 
-Take Care

2303
02:50:43,270 --> 02:50:44,400
Take good care of him

2304
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:49,900
See you, grandpa

2305
02:50:50,490 --> 02:50:52,690
That day I said I don't 
know who you are...

2306
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:55,980
Now, I don't know how long I would live...

2307
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:59,100
I will remember you as long as I live

2308
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:03,230
What can we give you who 
has done so much for us?

2309
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:06,520
We just believed in one thing 
since the day we are born

2310
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:19,730
This! We can just give this to you.

2311
02:51:38,560 --> 02:51:42,440
"This is your story"

2312
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:46,100
"It would go on forever with no end"

2313
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:50,270
"This is your story"

2314
02:51:50,350 --> 02:51:53,940
"It would go on forever with no end"

2315
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:59,880
"The tear of happiness in the eye 
that comes from a content heart"

2316
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:01,860
"Isn't it the wealth 
you are in search of?"

2317
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:05,980
"Every memory has hundred years of life"

2318
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:11,780
"Don't know how many are waiting, 
move ahead in search of them"

2319
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:17,370
"Won't your story stand in humans"

2320
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:21,030
"...like that of a saint"

2321
02:52:21,610 --> 02:52:25,090
"Won't your story stand in humans"

2322
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:29,040
"...like that of a saint"

2323
02:52:38,480 --> 02:52:41,210
[blows whistle]

2324
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:48,730
"This is your story"

2325
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:52,480
"It would go on forever with no end"

2326
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:56,600
"This is your story"

2327
02:52:56,690 --> 02:53:00,350
"It would go on forever with no end"

2328
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:04,350
"Won't this journey prove 
how great is selflessness?"

2329
02:53:04,570 --> 02:53:08,400
"It'll be written forever 
without being worn away"

2330
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:12,310
"Won't your sight say how 
small is the darkness?"

2331
02:53:12,350 --> 02:53:18,150
"Even the sky isn't enough 
to share the light emitted by you"

2332
02:53:20,180 --> 02:53:23,650
"Won't your story stand ahead 
as a great sage among the humans?"

2333
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:27,570
"...like that of a saint"

2334
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:31,450
"Won't your story stand ahead 
as a great sage among the humans?"

2335
02:53:31,870 --> 02:53:35,380
"...like that of a saint"

2336
02:54:00,970 --> 02:54:03,020
Rishi Kumar's journey 
in India ends like this.

2337
02:54:03,270 --> 02:54:04,980
Rishi Kumar goes back to America

2338
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:09,900
A journey that will be cherished and 
remembered for a long time to come

2339
02:54:20,730 --> 02:54:23,770
-Sir, Rishi Sir, why didn't you go? 
-What's the reason for you to come back?

2340
02:54:23,850 --> 02:54:25,520
-What's the reason for you to come back? 
- Sir, please

2341
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:30,400
I'm not going anywhere. 
I'm staying back in India.

2342
02:54:31,630 --> 02:54:33,400
I resigned as the CEO of Origin.

2343
02:54:33,850 --> 02:54:36,520
What sir? You resigned your post of CEO?

2344
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:40,810
Doe that mean Rishi Kumar's 
success story ends here?

2345
02:54:44,230 --> 02:54:48,600
There are no full stops in success. 
There are just commas

2346
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:54,650
Success is not a destination. 
Success is a journey!

2347
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:11,650
One who seeks Victory is a Man, 
one who spreads Victory is a 'Maharshi'.
