1
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:33,483
Who is Sun?
Our benefactor...

2
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Who is Moon?
Our benefactor...

3
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:45,534
Earth, water, sky, fire...

4
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,935
Air which breathes life into us...

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:56,509
if they all become selfish,
what would happen to us?

6
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:07,890
Share a little of everything...
be everyone's relative...

7
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:15,728
Spread goodness around...
be everyone's relative...

8
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,126
Don't go right, turn left.

9
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:47,565
Nothing wrong is right
becomes left or vice versa...

10
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,895
Nothing is lost...

11
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,594
Whose words were these?

12
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,170
Some direction less man.

13
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,899
You'll also become
a great man, brother.

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,077
Great!

15
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,610
Where do you want to go?
Right or left side?

16
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,907
Neither right nor left, go straight.

17
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,346
Are you new to Hyderabad?
- Yes.

18
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,353
Do you've any objection?
- Nothing like that brother.

19
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,850
We've reached, stop here.

20
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,457
No use if you own auto,
learn to drive it well.

21
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,261
No use if I know to drive well,
I must know the streets well.

22
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,797
You must be driving
Alto car not an auto.

23
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,602
I know it but God doesn't know it.

24
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,939
Found the address easily?
Come, let's meet MD.

25
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,206
I'll join today, sir.

26
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,681
You know about me, right?
- This is our canteen.

27
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,325
I'll drag you to road.

28
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,323
She has started it again.

29
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,656
Madam, it's my bad day, the size
of Samosa is little small today.

30
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,354
Will you file a case in court for that?

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,161
Who is she?
- Padhu, president of misers guild.

32
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,828
If you cheat people for a mere samosa,
how can ordinary people live here?

33
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,304
The Rs.5 samosa is 2 inches
smaller than yesterday,

34
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,477
how many samosas you make daily?
- 500.

35
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,579
It means...

36
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:12,547
How much flour, potatoe curry,
oil, he'd have saved?

37
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,380
I too don't know this.
- You want to build a 5 star hotel?

38
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,421
Can I build a 5 star hotel
with this money?

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,816
You can't even get a 5 star chocolate.
You know the prices have skyrocketed.

40
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,885
Why are you all laughing at me?

41
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,656
Say it in Telugu.
- I mean we'll not tolerate.

42
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,027
I'll pay for all samosas today.

43
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,329
Charity?

44
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,064
We are not ready to accept charity.

45
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,507
It's a party!
Celebrating joining here.

46
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,344
Just now he has come
and already started it.

47
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,080
Say your full name.

48
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:56,427
Fold your hands with respect
before seniors and... reply

49
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,263
Okay madam, anyway, you're senior.

50
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,266
Is it necessary to tell you
name as long as China wall?

51
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,540
It's a long list of hobbies.

52
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,375
Just show us a sample
of all your hobbies.

53
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,710
Go ahead.
You too can watch.

54
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,287
Okay, if you insist then...

55
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,794
Guavas in guava tree,
custard apple in custard apple tree,

56
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:41,065
Figs in fig tree, Jasmine in...

57
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,241
Fruits?

58
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:49,981
No fruits... only flowers.

59
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,189
You want another one?
- Yes, go ahead.

60
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,221
If you board a train, a train ticket,

61
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,657
if you board a bus, a bus ticket,

62
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,093
if you board a flight,
a flight ticket,

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,196
if you board an auto?

64
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,529
Board an auto...?

65
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,296
What's it? Auto ticket?

66
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:19,001
There's no ticket but you've a meter.

67
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,341
Well said!

68
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,951
Auto has meter but
your poem has no meter,

69
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,882
there's no matter in it.

70
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,182
Poetry is not just words.
There must by rhyme and rhythm.

71
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,522
Rhyme?

72
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,484
I'll tell you.
Very simple.

73
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,391
If you whistle
it's Andhra soda punches...

74
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,624
Your lips are like sweet punches...

75
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,926
This is rhyme.

76
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,263
That's all? Then, hear this.

77
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,563
You play the drum.

78
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,547
In my place I've a big bungalow...

79
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,483
There's wall around the bungalow...

80
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,320
A calf is standing near the wall...

81
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,292
The calf dropped...

82
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,467
Dung!

83
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,568
Great! You all are genius!

84
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
You and your dirty poetry.

85
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,170
This is what you call
natural pure organic poetry.

86
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:23,842
You know that?

87
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,442
What a great poetry!

88
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,737
Continue.

89
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,449
There's knife in kitchen...

90
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,593
if you touch live wire,
it'll give you shock...

91
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,690
You hit a nail into the wall...

92
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,762
if your back itches...

93
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,031
Scratch!

94
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,285
You don't about Padhu,
if house is on fire,

95
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,288
she'll give a missed
call to fire service also.

96
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,160
Stop!

97
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:21,965
Where are you going?

98
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,134
How much you took?
- Rs.5000.

99
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,242
When did you promise to repay?
- Last month, brother.

100
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,741
You're finished.

101
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,011
No...

102
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,651
Last month... it's 3 months since
your last month passed.

103
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,049
I don't want Rs.5000,
I want your 5 fingers.

104
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,655
No!

105
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,393
Watching a man being hit like
a live cricket match!

106
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,584
Are you humans?

107
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:51,827
What?

108
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,157
Who are you?

109
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,833
Where did you come from?
Go away!

110
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,300
Go to hell if you're Indian,
this is Jangaiah's area.

111
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,201
I'll show you my power
in your Jangaiah's area.

112
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,638
What power? What will you show?

113
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,503
Go away kid!

114
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,201
All of you will be in hospital.

115
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,839
Jangaiah will be in police station.

116
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:13,811
What's this sir?

117
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,783
Will you arrest if anyone saves
another man in Hyderabad?

118
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,185
Police in uniform are free
to arrest the criminals.

119
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,757
What do we do if we see
an accident on road?

120
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,824
We'll call 108.

121
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,623
If there's any fight on road?
You must call 100, right?

122
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,622
You mustn't become a film hero.

123
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,131
Is it wrong to stop a man from
getting his fingers chopped?

124
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,505
It's not wrong, money makes
humans turn into demons.

125
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,901
Though you haven't done any crime,
I've arrested you, right?

126
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,735
All because of money only.

127
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,309
Why do you say like that sir?

128
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,371
How much?
- Rs.3000 sir.

129
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,051
Leave him.

130
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,153
Look hero,

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,224
When you come to a city,

132
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,828
first know the roads
and then local goons,

133
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,725
go now and mind your work.

134
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,995
Never again cross Jangaiah's path.

135
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,003
How could you get bail
without a lawyer?

136
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,173
Look, money can even make
humans into Gods.

137
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,239
No need of lawyers and bails.

138
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,411
Greetings sir.

139
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,778
Where did you get the money from?

140
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,513
From who else?
Jangaiah himself.

141
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,027
East is that side?

142
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,697
Why are you offering prayers
to sun this side?

143
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,762
I'm leaving that to you,
offer the prayers.

144
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,030
But don't come this side.

145
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,208
What's this?

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,980
Children are allowed to watch
18 plus films, go kid.

147
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,376
Mind your work.

148
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,074
Come.
- I'll take a look again.

149
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:53,774
Come I say.

150
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,113
Then, you also watch it.
- Always the peeping Tom.

151
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,448
What a nasty habit.

152
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,085
Please think over it again.

153
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,784
You watch 3 days and
I'll watch 4 days a week.

154
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,793
Shut up and give me the tile.

155
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,464
Ram Babu, this is our bathroom,

156
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,666
what are you doing climbing over it?

157
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,330
Ask him.

158
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,733
From my floor we can see
everything inside the bathroom,

159
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,170
I don't want anyone fool to watch your

160
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,400
daughter taking bath so
putting tiles, uncle.

161
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,411
I've seen youngsters
who take photos with

162
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,776
cell phones if anything
is seen little,

163
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,472
youth like you are very rare.

164
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,484
Ram Babu is also a good boy,
he put a light inside.

165
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,411
Light?

166
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,453
I'll get you a coffee.
- Okay.

167
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,455
To watch taking bath
at night in summer.

168
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,184
You both seem to be close friends.

169
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,862
Yes, we hail from the same place.

170
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,329
We eat in one plate
and sleep in one bed.

171
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,596
I too made the same mistake with her.

172
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,495
We ate on in plate and
slept in one bed.

173
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,393
What's the mistake?

174
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,299
They say marriage and
throwing up can't be stopped.

175
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,668
She has morning sickness
and I had to marry her.

176
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,071
Come in, I'll introduce you
to my daughters.

177
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,564
Okay sir.

178
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,675
I've brought them with discipline.
Come in.

179
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,106
My eldest daughter Kamala.

180
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,940
She'll not do anything
without informing me.

181
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,614
I'll come home late,
don't wait for me.

182
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,679
I can see it.

183
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,320
That's my second daughter Vimala.

184
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,716
Very serious about serials.

185
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:05,652
My wife Dakshayani.

186
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,793
So intelligent that...
- We know sir.

187
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,858
We'll take leave.
- Okay.

188
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,656
They say love thy neighbour.
- I will love sir.

189
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,230
Shut up and come with me.

190
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,863
Please visit us often.
- I'll come even if you don't invite.

191
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,865
He himself told us to love,
you're spoiling my fun.

192
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,303
Stop it. I can't tolerate
watching it.

193
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,874
Do you've to stop and chide me?
Come.

194
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,743
Perfume is good, which brand?

195
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,245
It's been 3 days since had a bath.

196
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,476
Not you sir.

197
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,489
You look new today.

198
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,520
I like this for the past 25 years.

199
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,991
Of course moustache and
beard appeared much later.

200
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,655
Not you again sir.

201
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,833
Can you please step aside?

202
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,502
This time you only sir.

203
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,730
I didn't think it was for me.

204
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,409
We've reached our floor.
He's a sticky guy.

205
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,243
Isn't this ground floor?

206
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,906
Jump from here, you'll reach.

207
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,180
Uncle!

208
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,622
What are you doing here?
- What can I do you...

209
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,057
Lower your voice.
- What else can I do?

210
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,660
Where's Ram Babu?

211
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,796
Ram Babu is...
- Forget about him.

212
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,161
His father sent Rs.10000 with me,
he's not here so I'll go...

213
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,596
I'm here only! Give me.

214
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,529
Just for fun I said that
to bring you out.

215
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,334
In fact your father asked me
to get Rs.5000 from you.

216
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,037
This is cheating, betrayal,
I don't have money.

217
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,139
Did your father ever gave you money?

218
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,615
Your father bought a shirt
for you in the market.

219
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,216
Wear it.

220
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,653
How can I in office?
- Wear it, your father will be happy.

221
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,846
Tell him I wore it, uncle.

222
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:46,954
How would my father know it?

223
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,026
You're too much.

224
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,888
You wear it,
I'll show it to your father.

225
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,359
Don't think we don't have
that technology.

226
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,795
Wear it, he'll show it in our village.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,194
Stand.

228
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:56,993
You go ahead.

229
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,130
That's fine.

230
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,235
Wear it.

231
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:02,968
Great!

232
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,668
How handsome you are!

233
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,009
Walk a little.

234
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,403
You look like a hero.

235
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,740
You look very smart.

236
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,749
Your father will be very happy.

237
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,250
That's it.

238
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,151
Smile please.

239
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,981
Enough uncle, you sit there.

240
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,923
If you wait till my office is over,
we can go to my room.

241
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,629
I've lot of work here,
your aunt Parvathi

242
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,129
sent you these savouries and sweets.

243
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,833
Share with them,
they are yearning for it.

244
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,098
I will.

245
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,534
Are you coming home for the festival?

246
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,272
Yes, I'll come, till then look
after my father well.

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,678
Your father? Look after him?
He looks after entire village.

248
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,285
Send money this time.

249
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,453
Tell I inquired about them.

250
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,780
Take care, uncle.
- Okay.

251
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,053
My uncle.

252
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,688
Come.

253
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,489
Till yesterday you were taking Rs.5,
why Rs.6 from today?

254
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,725
Nobody to question you?
Have I put on weight?

255
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,037
Yesterday there were
three others with you.

256
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,172
Today one less.
That's why!

257
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,842
How am I connected with it?
Why should I pay a rupee extra?

258
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,977
Why are you troubling me for a rupee?

259
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,408
Keep the rupee and 5 also
with you, go away.

260
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,139
Get lost! Won't I get another auto?

261
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,716
Economic crisis befalls only when
you don't know the value of rupee.

262
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,116
I'm going that side, I'll drop you.

263
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,813
Drop? No... I know you
boys very well.

264
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,855
What do you know?

265
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,526
Today you'll offer lift,

266
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,388
tomorrow...
- Tomorrow?

267
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,756
You'll give a petrol bill.

268
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,890
I know everything.

269
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,732
What?

270
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,934
There's something wrong
with you, girl.

271
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,833
Any girl will say today lift and
tomorrow love letter,

272
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,067
why are you saying petrol bill?

273
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,208
You're worried about money, right?

274
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,573
Don't worry I'll not ask extra.

275
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,406
Get on.

276
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,746
What's that extra?

277
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,073
Love letter!

278
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,778
Good. I'll give 5.

279
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,582
Rs.5? I offered lift.

280
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,520
I'll not running a bike taxi.

281
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,925
I'll not take or give anything for free.

282
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:04,891
Okay or no?

283
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,258
Okay, get on.

284
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,799
Go.

285
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,443
Greetings Jangaiah.
- Greetings.

286
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,277
Why did you stop here?

287
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,180
Your house is near by,
can you walk to home?

288
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,218
Why?

289
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,753
I need money urgently.

290
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,118
I've come to pawn my bike
for taking loan.

291
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,293
But this is Ram's bike, right?

292
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,393
Nothing is yours.

293
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,292
Bhagawath Geetha.
Nothing is yours.

294
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,129
Till yesterday it was Ram's,
today it's mine,

295
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,032
after few minutes,
it'll be Seth Chamanlal's.

296
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,866
Okay, take Rs.4.

297
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,769
One rupee less for dropping here.

298
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:51,806
One rupee?

299
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,316
No problem if we go to office
in an auto for two months.

300
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,986
So what?

301
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,916
Feel proud that a girl is
studying because of you.

302
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:04,646
Then?

303
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,415
Let's take loan from office
and redeem the bike.

304
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,191
After redeeming?

305
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,759
Give it with your hands.

306
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,029
Am I so lucky?
- Come.

307
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,031
When I said I can't afford her studies,
you lent me money,

308
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:16,963
thank you very much.

309
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,932
Thank Ram Babu.

310
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,437
Thanks.

311
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,564
Your father may feel shy
to take money from us.

312
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,504
No way.

313
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,270
But he's taking in the hope
that you'll study well.

314
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,106
Study well. Okay?

315
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:29,780
Okay.

316
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,506
Bye.
Come.

317
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,981
We are grateful to you eternally.

318
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,949
It means we'll not get
back our money.

319
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,214
Bye.
- Okay.

320
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,425
Thanks Ram Babu.
- Why?

321
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,890
I thought you'll object to pawn bike.

322
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,093
Anyway we were planning to give
bike, chain and ring as dowry,

323
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,965
my uncles were planning to marry
my sister Subbalakshmi with you.

324
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,702
Marry with me?
Your sister is my sister too.

325
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,801
I gave you my room, my bike,
can't you do at least this for me?

326
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,808
Did you expect something
before helping me?

327
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,412
Anyone will expect, people are not fools
to help without expectation.

328
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,310
Sorry, let's find a better groom
for your sister.

329
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,216
I'll call Subbalakshmi here,
see her and then decide.

330
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,815
Not because I don't like her but
of difference of opinion with you.

331
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,024
Expecting help in return is business.

332
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,988
Barter system, I don't like it.

333
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,318
Are you vacating the room then?

334
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,892
Any doubt?

335
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,158
I'm not mad to stay here
after knowing your intentions.

336
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,393
Go, you'll find it hard to get
a room in this city, I'll be fine.

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,564
Are you vacating the room?

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,537
Not me, he's going.

339
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,141
You too go with him,
you'll have company.

340
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,209
Why?
- I've sold off this house.

341
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,677
Who permitted you to sell?
I'll not vacate the place.

342
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,281
The new owner will kill
to clear the house,

343
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,746
I've sold it to Jangaiah.

344
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,619
He has sold it to Jangaiah,
wait, I'm also coming.

345
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,846
Bye sir.

346
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,857
They don't have a place to live,
there's a portion vacant in your house,

347
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,359
they will stay there,
if you rent it to them.

348
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,625
To them?
- Yes.

349
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,926
Freshers getting a job and bachelors
getting room is very difficult.

350
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,535
You know it.

351
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,766
I need 3 months rent as advance,
I think they can't afford.

352
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,535
I'll pay the advance,
you give the room to them.

353
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,679
If you give your photo,
we'll pray along with Gods.

354
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,645
Giving him photo is waste.

355
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,949
Mailed the strategies and
pricing modules, sir.

356
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,056
She hasn't told...
- Come.

357
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:20,950
Thank you very much sir.

358
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:28,731
I'm very strict about time,
save electricity and water. Okay?

359
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,065
Our days of search is over.

360
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,169
What happened to the rent?
- I'll pay the rent on time.

361
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,835
All our luggage has come, right?
- Yes.

362
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,979
Where are you going?

363
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,174
What are you studying girl?
- How do I appear to you, uncle?

364
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,283
Girl?

365
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,418
What's that nonsense?

366
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,109
You come.

367
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,982
Your younger sister is just like you.

368
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,155
Greetings aunty.

369
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,323
My elder sister Seethalakshmi.
- All are like that only.

370
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,360
What's that?

371
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,397
They are taking their vessel.
- How many times to tell you?

372
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,326
Aren't you elder sister
of Padmapriya?

373
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,931
No, mother.

374
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,570
What's this for?
- For free coffees and breakfasts.

375
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,330
Are they here for donations?

376
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,836
No, new tenants for the
upstairs portion.

377
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,437
To bachelors?

378
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,440
What bothers you?

379
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,842
How can you dare rent it to bachelors
with such a beautiful younger sister?

380
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,513
First study for your
tenth class exam.

381
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,377
Ghost!

382
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,886
Don't serve them any coffees or
teas in my absence,

383
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,614
they are tenants, that's all.

384
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,126
What are you looking there?
Come.

385
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,125
Bye.

386
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,192
Bye.

387
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,563
That's your portion,
many other families live here.

388
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,204
Don't embarrass... I'm telling you.

389
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:43,971
Okay.

390
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,143
Take the keys.

391
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,470
What are you looking at? Go in.

392
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,407
Owns such a large building
but a miser.

393
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:58,887
Take it.

394
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,415
This one is yours.

395
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,838
If you want another pot, tell me.

396
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,905
How many times I've told
you not to waste oil?

397
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,445
Pooris have to be fried
in oil not in water.

398
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,977
You'll know money value
if you earn it the hard way.

399
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,449
Even men who earn well
don't harass so much.

400
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,985
The boys upstairs brought
2 pots of water for me.

401
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,180
Early morning?

402
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,794
Then coffee, breakfast... tell me,
you gave them coffee, right?

403
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,662
Oh God! Can I dare offer a glass
of water here? Forget about coffee.

404
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,303
Lord left me in lurch and this angel
has come down to look after me.

405
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,563
Leave me alone, you eat it.

406
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,205
Cigarette stubs.

407
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,909
I brought extra pooris
because it very tasty there.

408
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,051
What's this?

409
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,721
Is my home an ash tray?
- Ask him.

410
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,054
You...?

411
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,321
You're not even size of a cigarette,
you smoke?

412
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,084
Do you get cigarettes free?

413
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,660
Will anyone treat you free
if you get cancer or TB?

414
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,758
Life is expensive,
death too is expensive.

415
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,334
Got me or not?
- I got you.

416
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,663
Leave him, his sins will
take him down.

417
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,835
Pooris are very good,
would you like to have?

418
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,573
Free only.
- For you only.

419
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,007
Just a day here and
started it already.

420
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,477
What? Is it wrong to ask you
to join the breakfast?

421
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,516
No drinks, no dances, no cigarettes,
is it also in the conditions?

422
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,416
Is it prohibited to eat pooris here?

423
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,622
I knew it.

424
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,754
Shouldn't we eat anything here?
Should we live on air only?

425
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,955
What do they think of themselves?
Having free breakfast.

426
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:55,166
Ô Madonna! If you start free feeding
all useless guys here,

427
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,900
we may've to sell this building
and end up as paupers.

428
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,908
I didn't make these pooris,
there's potatoe curry with it,

429
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,774
I prepared tomatoe curry.

430
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,538
I thought you gave them.

431
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,615
Did you bring it from
someone's house?

432
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,146
Oh God! Make this miser
a little benevolent.

433
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,487
Where are the details of employees?

434
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,565
What's it Padhu?

435
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,798
Busy?
- Urgent work.

436
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:27,968
What's it?

437
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,798
Morning breakfast...
I misunderstood it...

438
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,978
You're here to misunderstand.

439
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,341
It's alright.

440
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,313
That is we...
- What?

441
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,748
Shall we go out to have a soft drink?

442
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:50,489
Come.

443
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,265
This is MD's car.
Are you going to pawn this too?

444
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,939
If there's a need,
I'll sell that also.

445
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,624
You made me donate blood
for a soft drink.

446
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,887
May be you'll take kidney
promising an idly next time.

447
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,222
Don't get angry.

448
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,030
Don't throw on road.

449
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,184
Donating blood is...

450
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,732
- Best but if it's yours
not force others.

451
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,370
Did I sell your blood in black market?

452
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,546
I had to do it to save
a mother and child.

453
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,217
Whatever it is, you're wrong.

454
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,058
I checked the personal records,
only your blood matched...

455
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,053
What's your problem?

456
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,559
No way with her.

457
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,601
What is he saying?

458
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,534
He's asking Rs.100, will you give?
- Why?

459
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,537
He thinks we are kissing.

460
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,902
Rs.100 for that?

461
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,737
Will you bargain for Rs.50?

462
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,738
My fate!

463
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,847
You paid him unnecessarily Rs.100.

464
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,512
You want to earn it back?

465
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:24,887
Let's go.

466
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,358
What's this sir?

467
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,523
You saved my niece and
her unborn child with your blood.

468
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,831
You saved two lives and
I wanted to felicitate you.

469
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,202
Praise her fully,
she donated blood free.

470
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,469
Eat as many samosas as
possible in the name of Padhu.

471
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,379
You don't worry,
MD will foot the bill.

472
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,045
Youth must make
Padhu your role model.

473
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:07,458
I congratulate and thank Miss Padmapriya
for donating blood voluntarily.

474
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,506
What are you writing
with so interest?

475
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,803
Letter to aunt's son.
- Love letter?

476
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,096
No...

477
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:27,178
- Don't worry, love
letter to him, right?

478
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,249
Show it to me.

479
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,813
No problem, show it to me.

480
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,751
To His Highness Chintakayala
Mukesh Kumar...

481
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,052
it's Mukthesh Kumar not Mukesh Kumar.

482
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,421
Okay, some Kumar.

483
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,460
Indeed you belong to stone age.

484
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,562
Is this a love letter?

485
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,960
It appears like an archeological find.

486
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,432
If he reads this,
he'll go for another girl.

487
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,695
What to do now?

488
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,566
You don't worry, I'm there for you.

489
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,367
Write as I tell you.
- Go ahead but in English.

490
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,175
Whatever it is, Go ahead.
Tell.

491
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,643
Brother-in-law!
- Why so many?

492
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,947
Don't you want to stress it?
- I do, go on.

493
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,693
What's this?

494
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,997
Temple bells ringing in heart.

495
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,190
Millions of lutes playing in my heart.

496
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,202
Stop your senseless poetry.

497
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,162
Seetha, write whatever you feel like.

498
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,669
What does she know to write?

499
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,137
My greetings to aunt and uncle.

500
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,976
Mother is preparing
mango pickle for them.

501
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,745
Do you like henna design on palms?

502
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:41,221
Do you like long hair with
jasmine or bobbed hair?

503
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,825
Give it to me, I'll write.

504
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,723
Her aunt's son will start loving you.

505
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,991
Moreover gave a clean chit too.

506
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,893
You don't talk, don't worry Seetha.

507
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,994
How much?

508
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,333
Take the change.
- Keep the change.

509
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,602
Looks like my buddy.

510
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,851
I told you nobody can drive
well in Hyderabad.

511
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,082
Did you learn to drive or not?

512
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,179
I'm managing but where's the fool?

513
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,147
Fool?
- Foolish driver.

514
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,585
I'm the driver.

515
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:17,027
You must own an alto car,
are you plying an auto?

516
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:17,853
Yes.

517
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,054
No problem. Do it.

518
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,358
Movie is not interesting, right?

519
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,762
Will you ply to Gandipet?
- Get in.

520
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,263
We'll not get late, right?
- I'll drop you if we get late.

521
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,774
Come closer.
- No.

522
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,277
Come closer I say.

523
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,187
Any problem with your auto?

524
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,882
No problem with my auto
but I've a problem with you.

525
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,288
Get down.
- Talk respectfully.

526
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,055
Will you marry her?
- Who are you to ask me?

527
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,564
But I don't like your business.

528
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,467
Why are you beating him?

529
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,337
Where is your home?
Where are you going at this hour?

530
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,405
My father will not dare ask me,
how are you related to me?

531
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,571
Related? I paid your MBA fees.

532
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,248
You didn't ask me then
how am I related to you?

533
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,746
So what? Will you beat my friend?

534
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:13,918
You want to see it.

535
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,815
If I see you again with her,
I'll kill you.

536
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,990
You turn back and take a long walk.

537
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,121
You turn back and get into the auto.

538
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,763
I'll tell my father about you.
- Okay.

539
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,663
Where are you taking me?

540
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,896
You must've asked that when he
was taking you to Gandipet?

541
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,165
Sit silently.

542
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,118
Honour is more precious than life.

543
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:54,118
You may be angry on me for this
but don't forget you've a brother.

544
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,690
If you need help, please call me.

545
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,703
Your Rs.5.

546
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,228
This is not good,

547
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,169
I don't know about you
but I'm embarrassed.

548
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,810
Plying an auto?
- Yes.

549
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,705
You don't have problem
if anyone cleans tables

550
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,543
or works in petrol bunks in foreign.

551
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,843
But in our country we must always
be white collar workers.

552
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,250
I don't like you plying
an auto for others.

553
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,323
I don't mind losing my bike.
I'll never ask you.

554
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,217
Who gave you the license?

555
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,389
To boss over my daughter,
who gave you the license?

556
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,068
Who gave you the license
to beat her boy friend?

557
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,499
You've an eye on her since beginning.

558
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,363
That's why you covered the
bathroom roof with tiles,

559
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,497
you paid her college fees,

560
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,905
you beat her rich boy friend
seeing them close,

561
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,012
who gave you the right to
interfere in family matters,

562
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,511
if it happens again
I'll beat you, mind it.

563
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,820
Don't play with the lives of girls.

564
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,082
Girl, be careful with him.

565
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,423
Move aside.

566
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,297
Get lost man!

567
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,195
Come.

568
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,394
How much you'd helped him?
Ungrateful fellow.

569
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,800
How could you tolerate him?

570
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,405
I didn't expect he'll be grateful,
I didn't get chided today,

571
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,873
why are you feeling for me?

572
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,274
She gave address when I asked
her phone number.

573
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,543
Is it?

574
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,785
If any girl sees her crying
face in the mirror,

575
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,723
it seems they'll never cry
again in life.

576
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,832
Elder sister gave Rs.300
for my hair cut.

577
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,131
I didn't use it for hair cut
but for something else.

578
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,437
We do have some hobbies
in this age, right?

579
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,474
We?

580
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,407
Don't worry, I mean like
learning to drive a scooty.

581
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,447
I hit an electric pole with
my friend's bike.

582
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,175
Headlight broke into pieces.

583
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,150
It took Rs.300 to repair it.

584
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,587
Padhu will kill me if she comes
to know I didn't have an hair cut.

585
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,194
Do you've to cry for this?

586
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,828
Will you lend me Rs.300?

587
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,061
You've good talent,

588
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,432
stop plying auto and start a saloon,
you'll hit big time.

589
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,665
How about a cobbler's shop next to it?
- Good idea.

590
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,401
Finished?
- Wait.

591
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,011
I'll make you Rani Mukherjee's sister.

592
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,842
I want to be Rani Mukherjee,
not her sister.

593
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,444
You be on the job.

594
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,415
Where did you've an hair cut?

595
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,885
Rs.300 for this? Silly hair cut.

596
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,786
Not silly hairstyle but
Rani Mukherjee style.

597
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:45,793
Silly hairstyle, show me the shop,
let's ask refund.

598
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:50,366
They'll not refund after the hair cut.
- Are you supporting them?

599
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,331
Look mother!
- What's your problem?

600
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,129
Leave her, it's fine.

601
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,204
What if her ear comes off?
She must get married.

602
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,496
Will she get married if she ears?

603
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,597
Misery will not.

604
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,005
You need English to get married.
- No need.

605
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,373
Marry someone who knows
English to learn.

606
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,841
My sister is reading a lot of
self help English learning books.

607
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,987
To impress American based aunt's son.

608
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,555
Mynah of the palace...

609
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,126
May I reveal the secret...

610
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,596
And fill your heart with happiness...

611
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,883
Ô playful parrot... shining star...

612
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,248
Prince charming will come...

613
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:51,991
Your lovely prince charming
will come as the groom...

614
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,431
Fun... have a go...

615
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:03,266
A man of heart...
he'll come to tie the knot...

616
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:09,344
He'll come flying in the sky
on a Pegasus...

617
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,779
He'll take you out of this world...

618
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:42,802
Welcome brother-in-law
and beat him...

619
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:50,315
Seetha is beautiful...
her bashfulness is gold...

620
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,772
You're going abroad...
plait is old fashion...

621
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:15,344
Get into beautiful curves
and shape...

622
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,948
There's no beauty in saris
and churidhars...

623
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,747
Wear minis and short skirts...

624
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,893
Woman must be like themselves...

625
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,761
Wherever you appear,
spread your charm...

626
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,699
Your aunt's son will go mad
seeing your beauty...

627
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,297
Why are you adding to it?
Hold the scales properly.

628
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,397
Remove few papers.

629
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,894
Never reform.

630
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,593
Need urgently Rs.5 lakhs,
do you have?

631
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,794
Rupees?

632
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:24,735
What?

633
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,243
Don't cheat because
I'm not seeing you.

634
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,538
I must get 10 kgs at any cost.

635
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,374
Give.
- I don't have.

636
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,482
No jokes please, you have or not?

637
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,180
Just a minute.

638
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,315
Mother!

639
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,655
Do you've any money
in your kitchen boxes?

640
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,754
No.

641
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,652
Not for me but for Nandu.

642
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,923
I think I've Rs.36 and paise 75.

643
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,388
Take it and arrange the
balance elsewhere.

644
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,830
Matter is very serious,
can't you understand it?

645
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,698
Rs.5 lakhs is not fun matter?

646
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,133
Why do you need it?

647
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,205
Do you know Jangaiah's place?

648
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,168
Come.

649
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,946
No, he's very dangerous man.

650
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,742
No need of character analysis,
take me to him, that's it.

651
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,010
I know but you don't know a thing.
- What's it?

652
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,285
The money lender will gain rights on
our pride too along with property,

653
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,287
my father unable to bear
the insults...

654
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,326
My father...
- Your father...?

655
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,463
Committed suicide.

656
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,669
Listen to me, don't do it.

657
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,239
I don't have time, take me
to Jangaiah immediately.

658
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,371
Won't you listen to me?
- Come fast.

659
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,010
Think again.
Jangaiah is not a good man.

660
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,240
He too is a human, right?
Come with me.

661
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,653
Have you lost your way to come here?

662
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,347
We've come seeking your help.

663
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,691
Jangaiah, I need loan of Rs.5 lakhs.

664
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,922
Stop that.

665
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,224
Hey, stop that.

666
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,896
I don't help, money lending
is my business.

667
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,225
What will you pawn?

668
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,170
I don't have anything
with me now to pawn.

669
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,669
I don't have much time too.

670
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,110
I too don't have time.

671
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,611
I need money to save a man's life.

672
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,508
I must save Chalapathi master's
son's life at any cost.

673
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,745
Did he teach you free?

674
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,785
Is he going to give his daughter
in marriage to you?- No.

675
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,019
When I was getting wet in rain,
he gave me an umbrella.

676
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,196
Umbrella?
- Yes.

677
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:31,529
It was raining heavily when I was going
to write tenth class exams,

678
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,702
he gave his umbrella to me
and walked in the rain.

679
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,701
Rs.5 lakhs for just an umbrella.

680
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,639
How am I to love fix the
price of that love?

681
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:46,377
Okay, this is today's collection list.
- Okay boss.

682
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,718
Give me something that
has Rs.5 lakhs value.

683
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,214
I don't have anything to pawn.

684
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,223
If you think anything in this
body is worth that, take it.

685
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,226
My eyes? My heart?
May I pledge my head?

686
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,497
Have you gone mad?

687
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,564
You wait.

688
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,401
Will you pledge your eyes and heart?

689
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,808
Did you hear it properly?
Boss wants your eyes and heart.

690
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,409
I'll pledge it in writing,
but I need money immediately.

691
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,507
Sign these papers pledging it.

692
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:23,920
Don't do this madness.

693
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,589
Needs immediate operation,
try to understand it.

694
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,423
Rs.5 lakhs.

695
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,429
I'm grateful to you.

696
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:40,263
Today is 15th, by next month 15th,
it'll be a month.

697
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,771
If you pay Rs.5 lakhs even after
a minute past midnight...

698
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,944
Your eyes and heart will become
Jangaiah's property. Got it? - Yes.

699
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,613
Return the money.

700
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,379
You're saving a man's life,
I'll never forget this gratitude.

701
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,295
No need to fear for his life,
I've money. Take it.

702
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,695
How did you get so much money?
- Forget about it.

703
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,131
Arrange for the operation
immediately. Come.

704
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:18,074
God has come in your form
to save my son's life.

705
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,138
May you be blessed with
my remaining life too...

706
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,313
You be on it sir.
Come, let's go.

707
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:31,981
The biggest pain is watching a
grown up son's death helplessly.

708
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:36,819
The biggest happiness is to see the
happiness when you help someone.

709
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,487
Don't you ever think about yourself?

710
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,996
You've been doing that for me.
- You...

711
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,772
Priyanka looks different today.

712
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,944
I think the new hair cut.

713
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,177
That's not hair cut,
it's hair burning.

714
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,184
New hair styling?

715
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,516
Is it good?
- Very good.

716
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,345
Tell me where did you get it done?

717
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,352
We'll also try it. Tell me.
- Tell me please, who did it?

718
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,018
I did it. Is it good?
- My foot! Nandu did it.

719
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,958
Nandu?

720
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,298
Did you do it Nandu?

721
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,363
A small experiment...
aren't we getting late to the movie?

722
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,799
Good you remembered it.

723
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,064
First explain about the hairstyle.

724
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:29,212
You know one thing,
you can go to office on moped.

725
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,211
Padhu drives perfectly, right?
- Yes. Come.

726
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,141
Come.

727
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:39,321
You never watch films, you're watching
a film to escape from Padhu.

728
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,387
Cool man.
- Wait a minute.

729
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,553
Let's go to watch this film.
I think it'll be good.

730
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,586
What are you looking at?

731
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,227
That is...
- Not you... carry on.

732
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,563
Don't look at indecent photos.

733
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,563
The eyes with which you see are
not yours, it's mine, remember that.

734
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,566
Come... come...

735
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,574
Stop... these eyes belong
to him, right?

736
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,574
I'll pluck it out, let me see
what can he do.- Idiot!

737
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,078
Pledged it, pledge mine too,
he'll come for it tomorrow.

738
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,211
My prince will come today...
- Pull it tight.

739
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:12,847
It's over.

740
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,354
Good job son.

741
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,356
I thought it was useless but
you turned into a new one.

742
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,188
My cot too is not proper.

743
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,695
Is it our job to correct your cot
and your husband?

744
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,626
What do you call it in English?

745
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:30,136
I'll tell you... lace,
weave it... tie it.

746
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,201
Father?

747
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,273
Koteshwara Rao has sent a message,
father serious start immediately.

748
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,377
What happened to him?

749
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,104
Call on phone.
- I'm trying it.

750
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,380
Is it ringing?
- No.

751
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,145
May be some problem,
I think may be in hospital.

752
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,217
What are you waiting for?
Get going.

753
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,053
Padhu, you too go with him.

754
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,055
His father is relative to us also.

755
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,888
I don't know...
- No problem. Go.

756
00:43:54,498 --> 00:44:00,994
This place... a house wife...

757
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,901
Greetings..
- Greetings Reddy. Have you come?

758
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,133
Please take your seat.
I'll start all over again.

759
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,669
At this place...

760
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:15,118
I think he'll never leave this place.
You move. - Bloody creep.

761
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,583
Can't you go from that side instead
going amidst women?

762
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,915
If not amongst women,
can I go from there?

763
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,021
Can't you sit at home?
Why did you come to watch this drama?

764
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,424
Move... move...

765
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,587
At this place...

766
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,257
Brother, Thayaramma is having fits.
You must come immediately.

767
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,098
You put some keys in her hands,
I'll follow you.

768
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,602
We've already, you come fast.

769
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,504
Fans and viewers must forgive me.

770
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:48,376
After treating Thayaramma, I'll start
from the same line of the poem.

771
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:54,287
Now you'll be entertained with
Draupadi's stripping scene.

772
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,289
Is it Pitapuram Nalla Padma
in Draupadi's role?

773
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,955
No, her younger sister.

774
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,396
Has her younger sister
grown up so big?

775
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,963
Isn't she in out hit list?

776
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,364
May be she'll not, it's been years
since you'd seen her.- Is it?

777
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,464
I'll take leave now.
- Why?

778
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,208
It's stripping of Draupadi,
it'll be fun to watch.

779
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,138
Umpteen times I've seen it.

780
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,313
He'll strip and she'll raise hands
and call, Ô brother,

781
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,209
and Lord Krishna comes
at right time to give saris.

782
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,474
That's all isn't it?
- Isn't it?

783
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,549
Krishna will not come today.
- Why?

784
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:27,986
Brother! Strip her in the
court as people watch. Go!

785
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,824
No, he'll not come.
He'll never come.

786
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,999
He'll not come.
- Why?

787
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,260
I've kidnapped Krishna and tied him.

788
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,174
You're very brainy.
- Brain is here not there. Unlike you.

789
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,676
Brother
- Brother!

790
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,682
How did Harischandra come
into Mahabharatha?

791
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,918
Why is he giving her sari?
Come, let's go.

792
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,191
Move.

793
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,606
Move... move... you may complain
I stamped on you.

794
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,969
Bloody rogue.

795
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,312
Why are you abusing though
I didn't stamp on you?

796
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,739
Are you angry for not touching you?
Move... let's go to Rastalu's house.

797
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,547
She has gone to watch night show.
- Are you managing her dates?

798
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,064
You've come so early?
Are you fine?

799
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,228
How is my father?

800
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,901
What happened to your father?
What's this hurry, Ram Babu?

801
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,572
At this place!...
- Bore!

802
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,410
Your son has come city.
- Really? Come.

803
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,670
Where could he be?

804
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,581
Aunt Parvathi is also not here.
- Your father is here!

805
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,856
Did the bus arrive before time?

806
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,824
I came rushing fearing
about your health.

807
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,086
Are you playing drama here?

808
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,755
No, Nandu...- You keep quiet.
Uncle, I must scold you.

809
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,466
You messaged father serious
start immediately.

810
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,504
Look how serious he's.
Aren't you?- indeed.

811
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:25,764
You left to a far off place leaving us
for a job, what did you achieve?

812
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,341
Much better than you.

813
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:28,811
It seems you're going
to far away villages

814
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,044
for loans as nobody trusts you here.

815
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,115
What about you?
Are you any less?

816
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,116
You'd have taken loans from everyone
in office and pawned everything you'd.

817
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,117
Is it necessary to hear
your loan tales?

818
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:42,782
You yearned to see him and
tortured me to send message.

819
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,961
Why are you fighting on seeing him?

820
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,796
Not only me, even his mother
is waiting for him inside. Right?

821
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:49,856
Tell him to speak to her.

822
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,630
Come Padhu, I'll show you my mother.

823
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,633
I got a good job in city and
a good place to live,

824
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,703
and good people around,
not liars like him.

825
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,913
Children are only till kids,
not after growing up.

826
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,582
He's the director of
this lousy drama.

827
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,148
I'm Harischandra to this village...

828
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,757
Don't get emotional, you wanted to
see him and I brought him here.

829
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,484
He has brought his friends too,
you calm down.

830
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:24,164
Are you working with Nandu or...

831
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,667
Uncle, we are living in their
building only.- Okay, no need.

832
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,836
I was very worried about
his food in the city.

833
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,509
She's very strict in that.

834
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:39,009
It's been four months,
why didn't you send your salary? Idiot!

835
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,181
I'm talking to you and
you're looking elsewhere.

836
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:45,682
Our home is this side, not that side.
- Forgot your home also, fool? Come.

837
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:50,482
Nandu, I've brought gravy for you.
- You have it, I'm going to bathroom.

838
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,092
This is soap nut gravy.

839
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,026
I'll apply without spilling
into your eyes.

840
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,359
Will you? Aren't you ashamed?
Go away.

841
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,862
As if you've shame. That room is
full of your naked photos only.

842
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,866
You apply it.

843
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,199
Okay, I brought you up
from childhood,

844
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,808
what do you've now
which I haven't seen it?

845
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,707
Is it? Come.
- Come.

846
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:19,288
Brother, I can't give your son
a bath any more.

847
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:24,119
Find a good bride...
- Every one takes me for granted.

848
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,990
Asking me what is that
I haven't seen?

849
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,893
What are you looking at?
Come and give me a bath.

850
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:30,965
No, I will not.

851
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,499
I think he has someone to scare him.

852
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,603
May be table would've been
better for her.

853
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,936
She must get used to it, right?

854
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,105
Nobody cooked here...

855
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,883
Food is coming.
- What did you bring, aunt?

856
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,953
Brought your favourite
cereal and chicken.

857
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,959
Priest sent tamarind rice & sweets.
- Chutney and curd.

858
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,147
I must have go at food.

859
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:04,394
Brother, have a serving of the chutney.

860
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:08,131
Hey city girl, eat everything served,
we'll not spare if you leave it.

861
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,640
In villages, they decide what
and how much you've to eat.

862
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:14,072
Isn't it dad?

863
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,881
You know your father sold off
the banana farm.

864
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:19,878
Really father?

865
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,064
Yes, weavers in our
village are starving.

866
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:26,044
Few had committed suicides.

867
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,817
It was for helping them, right?
One more thing.

868
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,819
I sold off the half acre
that side also.

869
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,761
For whose sake?

870
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,900
Ramana wanted to buy new machines
to do farming using new techniques.

871
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,396
Okay, land isn't greater
than Ramana, right?

872
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,670
By the way, who is Ramana, father?

873
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,777
Don't you know who is Ramana?
He won the best farmer award...- Okay.

874
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,444
Did you like the food here?
- Very good.

875
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:58,182
Is it good to sell your property
for other's sake?

876
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,782
I don't know if it's foolishness
or weakness,

877
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,890
I'm happy if village
is happy, I'll be sad

878
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:05,687
if village is in sorrows. That's all.

879
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,095
Brother-in-law is coming,
hide money.

880
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,034
Just for fun only. Isn't it?

881
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,705
We've staked Subbulu. Isn't it?

882
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,607
You're Dharmaraju and she's Draupadi.
Shameless creatures.

883
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,544
I'm not Dharmaraju but
she's Draupadi.

884
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,911
Play... why are you rushing?

885
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,885
It was open, I used to
wash him there.

886
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,824
Why are you standing here?
I'm losing, you go away.

887
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,387
Did you play?
- Look there, dropped.

888
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,398
Move... move...
Throw it.

889
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,239
That's it.
- Father, you're committing a mistake.

890
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,578
You've been playing my game and
your game since my childhood, father.

891
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,340
When I look behind my 25 years
of life, it's only you.

892
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,245
So what?
- Still you're holding my hand.

893
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,176
I made a mistake son.
- Great father.

894
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,919
'Bommarillu' knows by heart.

895
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:13,085
Only I'll be there in your 25 years
of life, will our neighbour be in it?

896
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,764
Am I not your father?
- Indeed it's you.

897
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,093
If you've a doubt,
how can the poor boy know it?

898
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,126
He's asking you something.

899
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,501
What will you ask me?
Mind your work.

900
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,934
Don't beat him, he has grown up.

901
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,936
What grown up?

902
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,201
Can't hold the cards properly
but comes to pay?

903
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,942
Like a champ.

904
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,945
Brother-in-law, our boy has
become champ in city.

905
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,017
Don't know who will marry,
she's very lucky.

906
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,781
What's your idea then?
- You'll never reform.

907
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,786
Where were you?
- Why are you tensed?

908
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,457
My daughter is getting married
tomorrow morning at 6 am.

909
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,432
You remember it, right?

910
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,961
You've been telling me this since
you printed the invitations.

911
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,365
How can I forget it?
- You go... you go.

912
00:52:55,572 --> 00:53:00,737
He's the first to bless
anyone in this village.

913
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,411
You go.
- Can I trust him?

914
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,580
How are you?
- I'm fine.

915
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:09,650
He may appear like this, he owns few
handloom weaves near bus stand.

916
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,382
Bullocks are scared, you go.

917
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,486
Will the pulses rate come down?
- Gold will get cheaper.

918
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,459
That's all?- Grandpa, Srinu threw
my bike into the well.

919
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,093
You play with another,
I'll fish it out later.

920
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,567
Come immediately and fish it out.
- I said I'll fish it out later.

921
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:26,895
I want it immediately.

922
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,270
Come and fish it out.
- No, I'll not.

923
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,898
Come grandpa... won't you?
- No.

924
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:30,829
Won't you do it?
- No.

925
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,803
Then watch out.

926
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,244
It's her slippers.

927
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:42,445
Don't throw it into the well...
Fish it out now. Gone!

928
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,249
Hold this.

929
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,420
Don't throw it into the well,
I can't see properly.

930
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:50,655
Lord Hanuman!

931
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:54,487
Kids are not scared of the elder man.

932
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,258
One must have love not fear.

933
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,262
No one fears father,
they all love him.

934
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:05,100
But in one place every
one pisses on seeing him.

935
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,206
Do they fear him so much?

936
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,213
The toilet he built in Upparapalli
is named after him.

937
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,612
Take your Benz car.

938
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,447
He's too much.

939
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,944
Your slippers.

940
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,890
He made me bath again for his bike.

941
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,393
Anyway you came in,
so please help me.- Me?

942
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,536
Yes, come. I don't know
to wear a sari.

943
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,803
Me... how do I know it?

944
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:40,400
Hold this.

945
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,979
What should I do?
- I will tell, hold this...

946
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,655
Leave it.
- How would I know?

947
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,492
How could I forget you?
Wait, I'm coming.

948
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,990
If you strike, then no milk
or curd for us.

949
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,259
Already nation is rocked by strikes.

950
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,663
Not like that...
- Father!

951
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,009
What happened?
- What happened father?

952
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,938
What happened?
- A scorpion stung me.

953
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,608
What happened to Hanumanthu?

954
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,339
What happened to uncle?
- What happened to brother?- Move...

955
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,248
Got stung by a scorpion,
we've to take him to hospital.

956
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,020
Get ready a vehicle to take
him to hospital.- Be careful.

957
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,918
Nothing will happen.
- How did it sting you?

958
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,355
Get the herbal concoction.

959
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,859
Can't you wear slippers?
- Move uncle.

960
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,191
I would've got you
a pair of slippers.

961
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,698
You don't care about yourself,
what will happen to us if you get hurt?

962
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,530
Can't you walk carefully?

963
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,370
What happened, brother?
- A scorpion bit Hanumanthu.

964
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,444
How are feeling now?
- Nothing will happen to me.

965
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,634
Is it painful, father?

966
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,040
My son is applying herbal concoction.

967
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,374
It seems Hanumanthu got stung
by a scorpion.- Is it?

968
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,217
I just went there.

969
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,951
That's why they say you're a fool,
take rest now.

970
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:04,325
What a misfortune!
- Why did you come, Papa Rao?

971
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,959
Your daughter is about
to get married.

972
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,659
How can I conduct her
marriage without you?

973
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,902
You didn't come there,
so I brought the marriage to here.

974
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,329
How did he earn so much
love and affection?

975
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,937
By selling his lands.

976
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,179
My father is king when he had property,
he's king when he doesn't have anything.

977
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,750
Hospital, school, water
tank, name anything

978
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:08,014
is built by my brother-in-law only.

979
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,692
Including toilets.
- Good.

980
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,791
You do everything on your own,
don't you've an MLA?

981
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,058
Why not? We do.
- No use at all.

982
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:23,404
Come, if you offer prayers there,
we believe you'll get married soon.

983
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,316
Then you'll get married soon.

984
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,917
I prayed for sister's marriage.
Not for me.

985
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,651
Prayers can't be transferred.
It's an age to pray.

986
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:44,725
Do you believe in Gods?
- Yes, don't you believe in God?

987
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,989
If priest puts dot, I'll not object.

988
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,332
If a Fakir puts holy smoke,
I'll not say no to him.

989
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,434
Religion means heart, all are equal.

990
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,834
Don't you offer prayers?

991
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,342
Yes, my prayers are
grains to birds, grass to cattle,

992
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,846
and help to other men.

993
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,342
Which religion can boast
of better ideals than this?

994
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,782
Here she is.

995
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:15,356
What's the rate?
- Rs.150.

996
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,254
Along with you?
- Don't you know my rate.

997
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:22,687
Just asked if there's any offer.
- Bloody idiot!

998
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,034
Move... move...

999
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,641
ls there any man to beat me?

1000
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,039
There is.
- You?

1001
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,544
No, my boss.

1002
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:44,550
Me? If you want you go.
I don't touch men, only ladies.

1003
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,154
I was just adjusting the flowers.

1004
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,959
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1005
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,063
What's the collection?
- Rs.16320.

1006
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,933
I didn't ask about the money
but girls in the temple.

1007
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,734
Bloody rogue! Won't you stop
talking bad even in a temple?

1008
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,566
Which philosophy says it's wrong?
What philosophy you know?

1009
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,240
I know all the philosophies.

1010
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:11,402
I know astrology, Vastu almanac,
Geography... etc,.

1011
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,581
What about sex manual?

1012
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,910
What's that nonsense even
on an auspicious day?

1013
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,245
Bloody idiot!
- Lt fell on your dress only.

1014
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:22,186
Priest! Had you known sex manual,
you wouldn't scold me?

1015
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,916
You would've joined me.

1016
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,518
Greetings Mangatayaru.
- Greetings.

1017
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,893
It seems your husband is not in town.

1018
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,924
Bloody rogue!
It's sin to see him.

1019
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,930
Come, let's go today's quota is over.

1020
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:15,905
Bliss... it's eternal bliss...

1021
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:28,748
Nandagopala, come to me
my anklet wearing Gopala...

1022
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:35,488
Govinda... Gopala... it's happiness
all the way today...

1023
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:45,434
You stole butter and milk...
You stole the young maiden's sari...

1024
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:52,170
You steal saris of women and
become epitome of love...

1025
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:59,382
Hail Lord Gopala!
Shower your mercy on us today...

1026
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,820
You play flute liltingly
and spread your charm...

1027
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,156
You make girls yearn
for your attention...

1028
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,562
When girls chase you
charmed by love...

1029
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,566
You innocently sit
in the lap of Radha...

1030
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,740
You're the desire...
you're the liberation...

1031
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:55,672
You're the clouds...
you're the essence of Gita...

1032
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,913
You ploy... your song...
your romance...

1033
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:16,125
Hail Lord Gopala!
Fulfill all our wishes...

1034
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:42,280
You appeared on the mount and reached
the hearts of people of Repalle...

1035
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:48,624
You destroyed evil demons
and protected the people...

1036
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,800
You're the saviour...
you're the friend...

1037
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:56,631
You're the protector...
you're the destroyer...

1038
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:05,674
Your ploy is love...

1039
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:17,045
Enough, don't make me too old,
I can dance for another hour, you know?

1040
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,720
Without leg pain or
running out of breath.

1041
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,816
Come, son sleep.
- I know father.

1042
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:26,617
Don't always think about others' welfare
only, take care of your health too.

1043
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:33,396
Don't you ever get angry on me?
- Why would I get angry on you, father?

1044
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,398
I'm selling away the property
I should be leaving for you.

1045
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,906
You're my biggest property, father.

1046
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,840
I know it, you'll understand me.

1047
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:19,447
What's this?

1048
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,947
They've all joined to give
you a gift. Take it.

1049
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,213
Give it.

1050
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,211
Nandu, see how beautiful it is.
- Very good.

1051
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,449
You're struggling to live here,
why this gift to me now?

1052
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:33,718
When we have such a fine man with us,
we'll never face any difficulty.

1053
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,629
Though leaders don't care about weavers,
Hanumanthu is there for us.

1054
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,895
I can never forget you
and your affection.

1055
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,469
It's our tradition to send
a guest with a gift.

1056
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,698
Am I right son?
- Yes.

1057
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,639
I'm taking so much from here.

1058
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,712
The more you share it,
the more it grows, uncle.

1059
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,476
Bye uncle. Bye madam.
- Okay.

1060
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,482
Bye madam.

1061
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,713
Don't put head out side,
keep your hands inside.

1062
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,084
Make a phone call on reaching there.
- Are you telling me or scolding?

1063
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,486
Got me?
- Send him happily.

1064
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,322
Come.- You don't rest till
you get slapped by him.

1065
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:12,061
Don't forget to make a phone call.
Careful son.

1066
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,508
Has the bus left?
- Left!

1067
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,836
I brought biesting milk for Nandu.

1068
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,539
What?

1069
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,437
I brought biesting milk for you.

1070
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,708
Do you've to come on bicycle
so far for this?

1071
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:11,253
I was feeling sad to see you leave,
I came back to see you again.

1072
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,392
Then, do one thing, come with me.

1073
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,731
No way! Leaving this place?

1074
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,237
Will he leave this place?

1075
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:28,243
You go.

1076
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,905
Conductor, don't get angry
for stopping the bus. Bye.

1077
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,411
Be careful... bye.

1078
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:46,252
Stop the bus... stop the bus...
- Stop...

1079
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,494
What's this time, father?
- Get down once, son.

1080
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,922
No problem, tell me.

1081
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:53,197
Get down I say.
You sit there.

1082
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:55,862
What?

1083
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,704
You love her, right?
- Father, that is...

1084
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,510
Express your love immediately
on reaching city.

1085
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,108
Don't think too much,
I too like her very much.

1086
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,785
Come quickly, else I may lose my job.

1087
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,453
Okay, take care of your health.

1088
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:18,789
Conductor, your job is safe.
I'll not stop again. Go... go...

1089
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,729
What did uncle tell you?
- I'll tell you.

1090
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,467
Where's Hanumantha Rao's house?

1091
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:39,307
Go straight, turn left near the temple,
ask anyone they'll guide you.

1092
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:50,321
My son is very lucky.
He's going to get a good wife.

1093
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:53,821
Uncle, you've a guest in a big car.

1094
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,094
Did you recognize me?

1095
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,331
It's me Sridhar!

1096
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:15,210
The child I left with you...
I mean my son. Where is he?

1097
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,032
I didn't knew Aruna had become
mother to my child.

1098
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,708
Poor woman!

1099
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,378
She too didn't know then
she'll get cheated by you.

1100
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:45,941
I went to America.

1101
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:49,815
I was forced to marry
another woman there.

1102
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,717
One you did wantonly and
another unwittingly,

1103
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,345
what brings you here now?

1104
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,295
Don't feel sad.

1105
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:06,124
My sin had become a curse to me.

1106
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,234
I don't have children.

1107
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,634
My wife too died recently
with cancer.

1108
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:17,979
I've billions now but I know
what I've lost in the past.

1109
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,374
Have you remembered lndia now?

1110
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:20,979
Has love brought you here?

1111
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:28,782
Recently I came to know Aruna
was pregnant when left lndia,

1112
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:32,654
and that she has left
the child with you.

1113
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,323
I've come to you with great hope.

1114
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,158
I too loved Aruna so much,

1115
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,315
after I came to know
her life was ruined,

1116
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:42,129
I thought it's better
to save her life.

1117
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:46,172
But no use... I couldn't.

1118
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:51,238
I don't know.

1119
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,414
He's a billionaire now!

1120
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,187
If you his whereabouts,
please tell me.

1121
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:10,188
I wasn't to repent for the sins
committed against him and his mother.

1122
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,736
Please don't say you don't know.

1123
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,877
I feel pity on you.

1124
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:27,281
No rich man like you
ever begged with me.

1125
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:35,917
I wanted to keep Aruna in my heart but
now she's just a photo on the wall.

1126
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,721
I know that much only,

1127
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:45,393
I don't know what happened to your
son or where he's now?

1128
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:56,105
I earned money but wasn't fortunate.

1129
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,071
I don't have anyone for me.

1130
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,741
I'm alone.

1131
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,418
Bye.

1132
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:15,627
Forgive me, Aruna.
I lied to him.

1133
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:22,831
Fear of losing my son Nandu,
I lied to his real father about him.

1134
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,268
Is it wrong?

1135
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,367
Yes, it is wrong.
It's wrong.

1136
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,377
Stopping him from becoming heir
to billions is wrong.

1137
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:37,580
It's a crime.

1138
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,876
Right.

1139
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,116
I didn't get it till you told me.

1140
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:47,987
Aruna, your son is a billionaire,
very great man.

1141
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,124
I'll tell the truth to his real father.

1142
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,794
Sorry, I'm telling him the truth.

1143
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,663
Finally, he got caught.

1144
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,229
I knew he wasn't that smart.

1145
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,195
So it was a comedy scene.

1146
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:29,832
Why are you closing the canteen?

1147
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:36,610
From today the relationship between
you, me and this canteen is over.

1148
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,974
Why? Is your canteen
contract expired?

1149
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:46,110
Yes, the loan I took from bank on this
canteen was spent on wife's operation.

1150
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,188
I'm not able to repay loans and
bank is sending me notices.

1151
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,289
How much you've to pay?

1152
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,790
Fell short by Rs.50000.
- Will you vacate for that?

1153
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,164
How much you spend on
cigarettes in a week?

1154
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,863
If it's others' 5 packs,
if it's mine only half pack.

1155
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,072
Rs.400.

1156
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,142
Stop smoking cigarettes for a week
and pay that to Durgesh

1157
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,381
Neelu, stop buying sari this month.

1158
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,380
I'll quit tobacco.

1159
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:23,087
If quitting our bad habits would help
a family from going to streets,

1160
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,088
it's very good.

1161
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,727
What are you quitting, Padhu?
Stinginess?

1162
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,631
I'll give you this month's salary.

1163
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:35,062
She got a good thought,
did we get thought?

1164
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,441
You always challenged to
close down my canteen,

1165
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:46,410
but you saved me and my canteen
from shutting down today.

1166
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,879
I pray God showers his mercy on you.

1167
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:53,214
Grains to birds, grass to cattle,

1168
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,855
a small help to humans,

1169
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,983
these are real prayers.

1170
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,459
How can you work alone when I'm here?

1171
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,524
You know how well I fold the clothes,

1172
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,033
if I do it, you don't need
to iron it also.

1173
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,770
How to fold this one?
- No!

1174
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,538
What's wrong if I want
to know about it?

1175
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:16,233
Give it to me.

1176
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:17,776
Don't poke your nose in everything.

1177
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:18,944
Why are you getting so angry?

1178
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:22,107
First time, right? I'll learn it.
Give it to me.

1179
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,043
I said no.
Do your social service outside.

1180
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,243
I don't want your help.

1181
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,315
She's refusing help.

1182
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,116
I wanted to fold the clothes but...

1183
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,288
Was my expression bad?

1184
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,463
She'll understand it.

1185
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,129
Take it.

1186
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,633
Nandu is in the room.

1187
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,970
Give me.
- No problem.

1188
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:53,776
What brings you here, father?

1189
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,649
You would've forgotten something,
he would've come to deliver it.

1190
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,646
He didn't forget anything,
his father forgot him.

1191
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,153
He's here.

1192
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,116
Are you fine?

1193
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,589
How can he be my father?

1194
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,422
Son...
- Just a minute.

1195
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,131
Father tell me.

1196
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,160
My angel left you in
my hands and died,

1197
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:17,270
I raised you as son but
I'm not your real father.

1198
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,864
He's your father.

1199
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,099
Son.

1200
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,175
I don't believe it.

1201
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,786
I showed you a photo on wall as
mother and you believed it,

1202
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,689
now I'm telling you a billionaire is
your father, won't you believe it son?

1203
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,865
Have you lost faith in me, son?

1204
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,571
Son, I'm repenting for my sins.

1205
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,532
Please forgive me.

1206
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:58,377
My business, my property and
money belongs to you.

1207
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:00,378
You've to come with me, that's all.

1208
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,149
Father!

1209
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,288
I can feel now what is
real property, son.

1210
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:18,056
Call me father once again.
- Father.

1211
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,732
Come in.
What would you like to have?

1212
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:23,902
No,

1213
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,596
I don't want anything son.

1214
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,742
You must to USA with me, that's all.

1215
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,909
To leave everything behind
here suddenly...

1216
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,413
What do you've here?

1217
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,989
In my 25 years of life...
- In your life...?

1218
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,291
The loans I've taken.

1219
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,690
No problem, I'll redeem my bike.

1220
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,527
You don't need to replace
the brief also.

1221
01:17:55,804 --> 01:18:02,437
Let it be crores, I'll
settle it in a day.

1222
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,441
Will you come then?
- I'll come father.

1223
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:11,151
Let's go for visa.

1224
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,949
Let's go tomorrow, you've come
travelling long distance.

1225
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,123
Take rest.

1226
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,987
Okay then, let's go to
our guest house.

1227
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,090
Nandu's father is very rich.
- Has he come here?

1228
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:27,859
Did you see him?

1229
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,901
He paid Rs.5000 Nandu owes me.

1230
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,470
How much?
- Rs.36000 with interest, sir.

1231
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,775
Take your keys, bike parked
outside, check it once.

1232
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,244
Clean the bike.

1233
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,318
You're giving the keys,
you want me to leave?

1234
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:48,318
Go.

1235
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,829
Just one more loan,
little big amount.

1236
01:18:57,165 --> 01:19:00,794
If you settle Rs.5 lakhs loan with
Jangaiah, I'm free of loans.

1237
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:01,832
That's all?

1238
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:19,852
It seems Nandu is big shot.
He stays in your building, right?

1239
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,319
By now you'd have put
a strong foundation,

1240
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:23,889
you're very lucky.

1241
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:41,570
Greetings. What's the matter?

1242
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,607
Who is he?

1243
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,577
I've come to settle the loan
he has taken from you.

1244
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,115
Your father?
He appears to be very rich.

1245
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,615
Why did you take loan from me?

1246
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,614
I came to know about him
yesterday only,

1247
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,822
he has come to settle the loan and
take me with him to America.

1248
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,222
He has come very late.
- Yes.

1249
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:02,188
24 years late.
- 24 hours late here.

1250
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,230
You know I'm very strict in
lending and collection.

1251
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,832
Your due date is over yesterday only.

1252
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,060
You'll charge more interest, right?

1253
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,466
Didn't you tell about the
agreement to your father?

1254
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,338
Tell him about our agreement.

1255
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,907
What's it? Tell me son.

1256
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,241
Eyes and heart.

1257
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,308
He has signed on stamp paper.

1258
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,978
Eyes and heart?

1259
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,311
Are body parts too pawned in lndia?

1260
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,772
This agreement is not
valid in any court,

1261
01:20:29,773 --> 01:20:31,620
in fact I'll put you in jail for that.

1262
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:35,024
Father, I'll talk to him...
- Your father is hot headed.

1263
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:40,096
Tell him about me, if you break the
promise, you know my reaction, right?

1264
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,997
Why did you take loan
from such a man?

1265
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:48,433
Can anyone take eyes and heart
while the person is alive?

1266
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,506
I didn't want it,
your son pledged it.

1267
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,809
You said you'll stand by your word.

1268
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,179
I still stand by it.
I came without knowing it.

1269
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:06,025
Tell me how many crores you want?
1 or 2?

1270
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,628
Are you putting a price
on your son's heart?

1271
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:15,702
You tell me your price,
I'll pay whatever it is right now.

1272
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:18,372
I want Nandu's heart.

1273
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:19,799
Father!

1274
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,744
I'm taking Nandu to America with me.

1275
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,005
Let me see who will dare stop me.

1276
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:27,909
Come son.

1277
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:29,716
I'll not stop you.

1278
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,483
He can't do anything.

1279
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,983
No court will accept this.

1280
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:45,830
Wipe.

1281
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,073
I must curse my mother.

1282
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,367
She should've married a rich man,
why did she marry my dad Somaiah?

1283
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,670
My fate.

1284
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,075
Padhu is leaving.

1285
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,076
Why are you leaving early?

1286
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,083
I'm having headache, going home.

1287
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:09,914
Are you leaving?

1288
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,357
Yes.

1289
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,425
I didn't expect Nandu will
change like this.

1290
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,525
Has he changed?

1291
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,697
How can he leave you for money?

1292
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:28,871
Nandu who changed a money minded girl
and made me understand love,

1293
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,375
I didn't imagine money will
change him so easily.

1294
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:35,982
Look, I taught Nandu only
one thing, to love,

1295
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,652
he doesn't know to cheat or hate.

1296
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:41,617
You're supporting him
because you love him.

1297
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,958
Isn't it wrong of Nandu to accept
a deserter as father?

1298
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,230
Who are we to tell that?

1299
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,795
Who else do you've in this
world other than Nandu?

1300
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:04,107
I grew up in this world.
Now I'm alone in this world.

1301
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:11,312
For me I've this... entire world.
I've the entire world.

1302
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:24,826
I can understand your pain.

1303
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:39,744
You understand my happiness.
Nandu is a rich man!

1304
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:49,350
I'll go away after meeting him once.

1305
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:08,940
Beer?

1306
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:11,976
Please come in.

1307
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:15,211
Please sit.

1308
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,049
What brings you here?

1309
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:20,219
Nothing, just wanted to see him.

1310
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,720
You've seen me, will you leave now?

1311
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:24,886
Why are you saying like that?

1312
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,728
Hanumanthu will stay with us
till we leave.

1313
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:29,658
Okay?

1314
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:31,990
Not we, Mr. Sridhar Rao.

1315
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,567
You! Alone.

1316
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:39,003
What happened to you?

1317
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,905
I was born because you were
husband to my mother for a day,

1318
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:49,508
as gratitude I spent a day
calling you as father,

1319
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,250
I couldn't make you spend
anything for me since childhood,

1320
01:24:54,389 --> 01:25:00,294
that's why, I made you settle
all the loans I took till now,

1321
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:04,130
the account is now settled,
you can go now.

1322
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,491
What are you saying?
He's your father.

1323
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:12,469
He came from America...
- Will you see me and leave?

1324
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,774
You raised in your heart
for 24 years,

1325
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:22,476
after 24 years if someone comes
and claims he's my father,

1326
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,619
would I go...

1327
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,120
if you say he's my father,
will you send me to him?

1328
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,722
Because he's rich.

1329
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:37,287
Do you think I'll be more
happy with him?

1330
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:41,627
Mad father!

1331
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,407
More than his billions,

1332
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:52,973
the characters you've imbibed in me
is enough to live life happily, father.

1333
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:57,917
Heir doesn't mean blood relationship.

1334
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:00,650
Good characters.

1335
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,548
My father gave a lot of them.

1336
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:06,090
Unlimited property. I've it.

1337
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,488
I don't want yours.

1338
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:15,701
I want only you!

1339
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,179
Don't ever leave me.

1340
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,886
Why did you send away
your billionaire father?

1341
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:41,285
Will you go away with anyone if they
promise billions leaving your father?

1342
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:41,962
Then what?

1343
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,528
You didn't give up foster father,

1344
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:47,565
but many are leaving
their fathers for money.

1345
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,327
Do you know how many crores it is?

1346
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:53,868
How would you feel if he leaves
you for money in future?

1347
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,209
Put some sense into them.

1348
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,007
Did you wet my shirt?

1349
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:05,574
Nandu, it seems if infants wet,
you'll get married soon.

1350
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,550
Then, come and pick him, up,
he'll wet on you too.

1351
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,783
You too are not married, right?

1352
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,386
It may not look good if we both
get married at the same time.

1353
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,552
Give me, I'll wash it.
- No problem.

1354
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:18,265
I used to pester her to dry
the washed clothes,

1355
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,492
now she's ready to wash,
indeed it's important.

1356
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:22,863
You season the food.

1357
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,732
With oil or water?

1358
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,000
Give me.
- No problem.

1359
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,232
Give I say.

1360
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:31,239
I think you'll get married soon
as your father said.

1361
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:32,504
I'm telling you.

1362
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,242
Go slow son, still 2 hours for
the train to leave.

1363
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:42,912
If we go slow, 2 hours is not enough
to reach station in this traffic.

1364
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:46,456
You don't have the speed
where it is necessary.

1365
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:48,386
Go and express your love to Padhu.

1366
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,928
Will she start loving me immediately?

1367
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:52,292
What do we have, father?

1368
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,024
What do you lack, son?

1369
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:58,965
Padhu likes a man of character
than a man of riches.

1370
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,266
Listen to me and express
your love to her,

1371
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:03,307
I'll arrange your marriage immediately.

1372
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:05,276
I'll tell her.

1373
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,801
You're in my heart...

1374
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:35,908
Love is keeping my heart ticking...

1375
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:40,979
What didn't happen for years...
may've happened in few days...

1376
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:46,176
I'm for you and you're for me...

1377
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:50,721
I was floating air to reach you...

1378
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:56,491
Right before my eyes...

1379
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,867
You're in imaginations...

1380
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:39,733
You're my breath...

1381
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:45,038
You're my wish...
you're in my thoughts...

1382
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:50,115
You're the love beat that's
keeping my heart ticking...

1383
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:55,051
You're in me... you're my dream...
my story...

1384
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:59,822
Reaching with yearning
and thinking about you...

1385
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:33,020
You're before me...
calling me again and again...

1386
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,545
What? You brought me here
to say something.

1387
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:52,474
Won't you come out?

1388
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,877
That is... I'll tell you.

1389
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,046
That's all.

1390
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:04,121
I want strawberry and
vanilla in one cup.

1391
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:13,791
It's there!

1392
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,464
Why am I not able to come out?

1393
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,773
Your dress today is great.

1394
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,309
I bought it on footpath in Koti.
- Not to you.

1395
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,084
Only we both are here, right?

1396
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:35,150
Torture.

1397
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:46,928
I'm not that type.
- My fate!

1398
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,362
I'm also not that type.

1399
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:50,369
I'll tell her.

1400
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,498
Why did you take so much time?

1401
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,073
I mustn't delay any further.
I must tell her.

1402
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,337
That is...

1403
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:04,681
What?

1404
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:07,585
I'm coming.

1405
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:10,117
Come, let's go.

1406
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:12,289
Urgent, come.

1407
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,991
We must go to RLM
hospital immediately.

1408
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,526
Why?
- I'll tell you later.

1409
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,197
Doctor, Kamala's family is here.

1410
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:25,865
Sit here.

1411
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:28,202
Sit.

1412
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:29,641
What happened?

1413
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,403
She tried to take some local medicine
and endangered her life.

1414
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,912
Her life is in danger
if you don't abort it.

1415
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:37,306
Then, do it immediately and save her.

1416
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,548
Father or husband must sign it.

1417
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:46,085
Sign.

1418
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:48,262
Where should I sign?

1419
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:50,993
Here.

1420
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:05,244
Get down carefully.

1421
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,315
What happened?

1422
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:11,746
What happened a month before?

1423
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:15,781
You chided me for beating when
she went out with a rich boy.

1424
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:16,854
So what?

1425
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:19,583
If you'd scolded her instead of me,
she would've gone for abortion now.

1426
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:23,127
I wouldn't have to sign as her
husband for the abortion.

1427
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:25,697
Bloody creep! How dare you!
- Stop!

1428
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:30,801
You don't have the right to scold
after leaving her carelessly.

1429
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,563
I gave them freedom as girls.

1430
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,263
Freedom doesn't mean going berserk.

1431
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,705
Self confidence to stand
on her own legs.

1432
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:41,271
Why did you tell him instead
of informing your father?

1433
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,111
You must understand
when she called me,

1434
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:45,808
how responsible father you are?

1435
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:47,443
Look at her.

1436
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:48,815
No man in the family.

1437
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,557
She's paying father's loan
by saving every penny,

1438
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:59,760
she's working hard giving up her
little wishes for the family's sake,

1439
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,296
that's why I respect her a lot,

1440
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:09,332
look, take it as an accident,

1441
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:13,105
it's wrong to think about suicide,

1442
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,672
at least hereafter concentrate
on studies.

1443
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:15,810
Okay brother.

1444
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:20,143
Really you are...
- I hate praise.

1445
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:21,316
Shall we go?

1446
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:27,925
You signed as husband
for the abortion,

1447
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:29,824
as a brother, you brought her home,

1448
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,726
though you're young,
you've shown your big heart,

1449
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,399
I'm feeling shame on seeing you,

1450
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,829
please forgive me.

1451
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,702
Stop feeling shy or at other's feet,
be a man to the family.

1452
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:39,668
Bye.

1453
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:46,773
Father told me to propose to Padhu.

1454
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,677
You spent almost entire day with
her in office and at home,

1455
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:50,851
can't you tell her?

1456
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:55,016
I want to tell but proper time
and mood is necessary.

1457
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:58,022
Are you fine, Jangaiah?

1458
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,298
Cigarette smoke is injurious to heart.
You know it, right?

1459
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,966
Nandu never smokes.

1460
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:09,193
Don't be a passive smoker too.

1461
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:11,636
I've dropped it.

1462
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:16,634
Are you here?

1463
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:17,868
Girl friend?

1464
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:20,846
Love?

1465
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:29,484
Girls will break hearts,
love is also injurious to heart.

1466
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,748
Got it?

1467
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:36,095
I told you he's a dangerous man,
you didn't listen to me.

1468
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:37,525
Thank God, he didn't pledge his nose.

1469
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,597
He may say nose is mine,
you mustn't blow it.

1470
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,825
Would you like to have tea?
Three teas please.

1471
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:42,764
Yes sir.

1472
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,631
I've been searching you.

1473
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,431
I want to tell you something.

1474
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,900
Nandu too wants to tell you something.

1475
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:48,531
Tell her.

1476
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:49,732
Is it?

1477
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,003
You tell me first.
- You first.

1478
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:56,082
You tell me first.
- You tell me first.

1479
01:35:58,219 --> 01:35:59,277
Okay, I'll tell you.

1480
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:01,552
My aunt's son is coming from America.

1481
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:04,251
Aunt's son?
- My elder sister's future husband.

1482
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,426
God! You're there!

1483
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,691
Why are you happy for
my sister's marriage?

1484
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:14,099
That's his character,
he's happy for anything good.

1485
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,462
Uncle's family is coming
from America,

1486
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:18,837
first engagement and then marriage,

1487
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,028
I'm worried.

1488
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,708
I'm very happy.

1489
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:25,276
You must look after all
the arrangements, okay?

1490
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,638
Leave it on us from this moment.

1491
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:29,543
Isn't your responsibility
my responsibility?

1492
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,445
Aren't your relatives my relatives?

1493
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:34,448
You'll spend, won't you?
- Shut up.

1494
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:35,952
Always mad after money.

1495
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:41,151
What?
Are you saying mad after money?

1496
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,196
Have to shop in the evening,
come home to take the list.

1497
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:47,160
If her elder's marriage is fixed,
your line is clear then.

1498
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:03,941
Watching you every day...

1499
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,244
Thinking ourselves King and Queen...

1500
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,590
Roaming in imaginations...

1501
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,920
Adoring you with my eyes...

1502
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:17,255
Hiding a wish in my heart...

1503
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:20,595
Living in your thoughts...

1504
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:25,138
Let happiness take over my life...

1505
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:31,642
May I become beauty spot
on your cheek...

1506
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:55,126
Your wishes...
are my difficulties...

1507
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,031
I'm losing because of you...

1508
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:58,432
I want that...

1509
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,837
What you lack, your anger and grief...

1510
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:03,968
Your thousand incarnations...

1511
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:05,243
I want that...

1512
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:08,381
I want the happiness you give...

1513
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:11,847
I want the message sent
by your silence...

1514
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:15,044
I want you and your tears...

1515
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:18,987
I don't mind tears also...

1516
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:28,326
I want the friendship with you...

1517
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,732
I want happiness and joy...

1518
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:34,999
I want your sweet chides...

1519
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:38,337
I want the love fights with you...

1520
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:44,040
In this chill weather,
I want you to warm me...

1521
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:48,454
All your beauty is mine...

1522
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:53,787
When love fructifies, I'll be yours...

1523
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,945
Though no man in the house, you're
running a family with 3 daughters.

1524
01:39:14,181 --> 01:39:18,083
I'm doing nothing,
Padhu is the man of the house.

1525
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:20,517
She was a fire brand from childhood.

1526
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:31,992
You mean aunt's son?

1527
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:38,334
No... no...

1528
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:40,337
I checked everything.

1529
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,198
Give it to me.
- No problem, give it to me.

1530
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:44,070
I'll carry it.
- No problem. You go.

1531
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,108
Who is he?

1532
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:47,746
He's Nandu,
Padhu's colleague in office.

1533
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:48,846
He stays upstairs.

1534
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:53,346
I thought he's Padhu's boy friend.
- Isn't he handsome?

1535
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:02,524
How you were as little girl?
How much you've changed?

1536
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:07,295
Had you been in America...

1537
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:11,534
They would've gone mad.
- Is it?

1538
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:17,306
Sister is waiting for you.
Did you meet her?

1539
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,384
We told him... your son is here.

1540
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:45,902
What's this? Have you gone mad?

1541
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:47,596
Yes, I'm mad.

1542
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:51,368
How well he's speaking English, brother?

1543
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:52,670
What is he saying?

1544
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:56,438
English is fine but may be
the matter isn't that nice.

1545
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:57,779
I'll tell you.

1546
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,584
Don't know how to break it to you.
- Tell me brother.

1547
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:04,855
He changed seats thrice
in the flight,

1548
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:07,152
after completing 3 years
in engineering college,

1549
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:09,955
in the final year he decided
to become a doctor.

1550
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:13,091
What did he say now, brother?
- What did he say now?

1551
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,867
Just now I saw Padhu,

1552
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,902
I'll not marry Seethalakshmi,
he insists on marrying Padhu.

1553
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,198
Padhu's beauty has made me go mad.

1554
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:31,350
I don't mind if Seethlakshmi or Padhu,
both are my nieces.

1555
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:32,610
Nothing to worry.

1556
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:44,992
I told you so many times to express
your love but you delayed it.

1557
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,793
Now that American eagle
is taking her away.

1558
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:49,966
Do one thing, clean the lefty overs
in their marriage feast.

1559
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,162
That'll be better.

1560
01:41:59,113 --> 01:41:59,977
Sister!

1561
01:42:06,186 --> 01:42:08,154
I imagined him as my husband
since childhood...

1562
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:16,820
Anyway who is he going to marry?

1563
01:42:17,297 --> 01:42:18,355
My sister.

1564
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:21,428
I don't mind, you marry him.

1565
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:25,864
I'm not that sad.

1566
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:31,200
My jeans, my T-shirt,
my English speaking course,

1567
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:35,245
everything... you don't need
all that, right?

1568
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:37,212
That's why he liked you.

1569
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:38,509
That's why he likes you.

1570
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:40,451
That's why...

1571
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:45,622
Please sister.

1572
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:52,127
Thank God! He didn't see me first.

1573
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:54,197
May be he would've insisted
on marrying me then.

1574
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:55,363
Shut up.

1575
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:03,977
Marriages don't happen or stop
on the wishes of the bride.

1576
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,908
Your uncle mustn't get insulted.

1577
01:43:07,114 --> 01:43:11,244
When your father left us in lurch
amidst loan sharks,

1578
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:15,285
our house was going on auction,
your uncle redeemed it for us,

1579
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:17,548
he saved our honour,

1580
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:20,154
can we put a price for it?

1581
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:22,823
So we must be grateful to him.

1582
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,157
If it was money,
Nandu would've given it.

1583
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,994
Where can he get it?
Will he pledge anything?

1584
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:32,703
He can do one thing from sister's
marriage getting cancelled,

1585
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:34,134
he can marry Seetha sister.

1586
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:36,935
Anyway I don't like that
American brother-in-law.

1587
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:39,044
Let Padhu marry him and
go to America,

1588
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:40,975
then you, me and Nandu
can live happily here.

1589
01:43:41,181 --> 01:43:42,409
Shut up.

1590
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:49,788
It's his wish to reject my sister.

1591
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:54,852
Is it also his wish to marry me?

1592
01:43:57,297 --> 01:44:01,028
Don't refuse this proposal
and split the family?

1593
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:07,368
Seethlakshmi will get a better choice.

1594
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:10,602
I'm sure she will.

1595
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:12,438
Isn't Nandu there for her?

1596
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,471
Stay out of it.

1597
01:44:16,283 --> 01:44:18,945
Okay, wait for 4 more years,
I'll marry Nandu.

1598
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:21,882
I'll break your face if you talk big.

1599
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:38,434
What would you like to have?

1600
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:42,473
Don't want wine?

1601
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:47,146
Indian girls are like that,
never change.

1602
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,581
Coffee must be hot.

1603
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:54,981
It's problem if one is not hot
or another is not cold.

1604
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:59,487
How did I deal him?
- I'm having headache.

1605
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:03,021
Indian girls have this problem,
you think too much.

1606
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,494
Don't they think there?
- Not for everything.

1607
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:15,603
Do you've a boy friend?

1608
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:17,269
Is it shocking you?

1609
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,240
I think it's a wrong question.

1610
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:20,611
I do have.

1611
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:23,273
Do have?

1612
01:45:24,584 --> 01:45:25,380
What's his name?

1613
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:26,381
Is it necessary?

1614
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:32,024
No need to tell if you're
not interested.

1615
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:36,360
What's your opinion about
pre-marital sex?

1616
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:41,460
Shocked again? I know the
answer Indian girls will give.

1617
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:44,570
In my opinion there's no problem.

1618
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:46,898
What's wrong in pre-marital sex?

1619
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:48,799
Are you shocked now?

1620
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:58,311
Just answer in yes or no,

1621
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:03,313
shocked again, right?

1622
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:05,382
Answer only if you wish to.

1623
01:46:14,334 --> 01:46:17,326
You would've got shock of life,
but I must tell the truth, right?

1624
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:36,581
I don't care about all that.

1625
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,526
I thought lndia would
be very backward.

1626
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:54,765
We are getting engaged.

1627
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,744
Did you tell him a white lie?

1628
01:47:02,482 --> 01:47:03,278
Yes.

1629
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,277
I told him shamelessly.

1630
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:07,613
I told him without any shame.

1631
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:13,425
I thought he would reject me
and marry elder sister.

1632
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:15,194
But that Yoyo man...

1633
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:19,993
What are you planning to do now?

1634
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:23,967
I thought over it again and again.

1635
01:47:29,876 --> 01:47:32,709
There's only one solution to it.
- What is it?

1636
01:47:34,581 --> 01:47:36,071
You must help me.

1637
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:41,551
Little difficult... forget it.
- What should I do?

1638
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:44,054
I'll tell you.

1639
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:50,921
To tell the story,
you and me are in deep love,

1640
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:54,063
just act like that, that's all.

1641
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:59,497
Isn't it little difficult?

1642
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:02,102
But you must do it for me.

1643
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,244
I mean I know you'll do
it for my sister.

1644
01:48:05,946 --> 01:48:06,844
Won't you?

1645
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:14,112
Logic is that when I told I'm not
a virgin, he took it easily,

1646
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:21,588
but if we both move close before him,
I think he can't tolerate it.

1647
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:29,096
May be he'll then reject me
and marry my sister.

1648
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:36,807
Nandu, you must help in
my sister getting married.

1649
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,708
They are not hands.
- They are hands.

1650
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:48,944
Please don't change his body parts
for your selfish needs.

1651
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:52,515
He's a good actor.

1652
01:48:53,393 --> 01:48:55,293
No, he lives the role, right?

1653
01:48:56,129 --> 01:48:57,027
You go.

1654
01:48:58,465 --> 01:48:59,432
Really?

1655
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:00,495
Yes.

1656
01:49:10,477 --> 01:49:14,743
You had to act like son with
your father for a day,

1657
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:19,312
now you had to act like a lover
to the girl you love.

1658
01:49:20,687 --> 01:49:22,245
What a lousy life is yours?

1659
01:49:44,044 --> 01:49:48,947
Your heart is damaged.
Transplantion is unavoidable.

1660
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:53,513
The earlier the better.

1661
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:58,683
If not... very difficult to live.

1662
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:08,231
Come... come...
- It's been years.

1663
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:10,027
Recently we came to America.

1664
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:12,864
I came there for a surgery
on my finger.

1665
01:50:13,073 --> 01:50:13,937
Yes... yes..

1666
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,132
After becoming MLA, you spend
more time in America than in lndia.

1667
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:19,034
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1668
01:50:19,245 --> 01:50:23,375
Hubby, he's chubby and cute,
shall we adopt him?

1669
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,544
Is he of age to adopt?
- Can I take it?

1670
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:27,811
What?
- Bag.

1671
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:28,817
Take it.

1672
01:50:29,022 --> 01:50:30,546
Come in.
- Okay.

1673
01:50:32,993 --> 01:50:33,891
My sister.

1674
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:36,051
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1675
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:37,854
Is she your daughter-in-law?

1676
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:39,258
My eldest daughter.

1677
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,893
You must say I love and
Yoyo must overhear it.

1678
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:47,938
Not so nervous, with little feel
and from deep inside.

1679
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:50,268
With little energy.

1680
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:53,411
He's coming...

1681
01:50:57,217 --> 01:50:59,412
I can't live without you.

1682
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:04,614
I came to know love is so
strong only after seeing you.

1683
01:51:07,727 --> 01:51:10,093
MLA uncle has come,
daddy is calling you.

1684
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:31,944
That's my future daughter-in-law.

1685
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:33,810
She's beautiful.

1686
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:36,782
But who is the boy with her?

1687
01:51:40,827 --> 01:51:41,985
What man?
He's saying her boy friend.

1688
01:51:42,095 --> 01:51:43,494
Times have changed.

1689
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,562
It's all western culture.
- Don't know what's that?

1690
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,130
Greetings.
- Greetings sir.

1691
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:51,633
How handsome he is!

1692
01:51:52,338 --> 01:51:54,465
You come here, Rajyam.
You go that side.

1693
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:55,972
Go.

1694
01:51:56,342 --> 01:52:00,073
Why don't you arrange marriage also,
needn't have to come again?

1695
01:52:00,647 --> 01:52:04,083
If he doesn't change after engagement,
I'll arrange the marriage.

1696
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:07,085
Then I'm sure he's good
material for politics.

1697
01:52:11,658 --> 01:52:13,387
What are you doing, Nandu?

1698
01:52:13,593 --> 01:52:15,493
I want to rip out your
aunt's son's skin.

1699
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:19,660
I mean I'm skinning
the mango for him.

1700
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:24,000
Can't you chew the skin?
Are your teeth so weak?

1701
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:29,531
Fertilizers and pollution on skin...

1702
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:31,540
Tissue papers for toilet.

1703
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,337
Don't you've economy size?

1704
01:52:33,546 --> 01:52:34,774
Anything will do for wiping.

1705
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:42,452
Bleeding!

1706
01:52:43,022 --> 01:52:44,785
Ram Babu, get bandage.

1707
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:53,358
Why did you try to skin it?
Why did you cut your finger?

1708
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,763
Is it painful, Nandu?

1709
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:59,029
I don't feel any pain when you put
the finger into your mouth.

1710
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:00,797
Is it?

1711
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,142
Has your pain eased?

1712
01:53:08,148 --> 01:53:11,549
She's so concerned about boy friend,
how concerned she'd be if it's husband?

1713
01:53:11,885 --> 01:53:12,817
She'll raise hell.

1714
01:53:15,355 --> 01:53:17,152
Padhu, he cut his finger.

1715
01:53:19,692 --> 01:53:20,659
Wait Nandu.

1716
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:25,896
I think it needs a doctor.
Wait...

1717
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:36,098
it's me! How are you?

1718
01:53:39,512 --> 01:53:40,570
What is she doing?

1719
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,779
Pumpkin sweet?

1720
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:45,883
I love it.

1721
01:53:48,087 --> 01:53:49,554
Oh I forgot.

1722
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:51,348
My brother-in-law cut his finger.

1723
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:52,422
What should I do?

1724
01:53:57,297 --> 01:53:58,195
That's all?

1725
01:53:58,398 --> 01:54:00,298
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1726
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:07,333
Don't get tensed,
nothing will happen.

1727
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:09,099
Just apply lime, that's enough.

1728
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:10,941
Lime?

1729
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:13,544
Nandu, come.

1730
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:17,542
Is the lime enough?

1731
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,944
Let's go to my room.

1732
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:31,630
Your finger is cut, may I feed you?

1733
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:34,197
Marry one who feeds not
one who applies lime.

1734
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,766
Nandu has brought his father.

1735
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,460
I recognized just like that.

1736
01:54:39,005 --> 01:54:40,939
He's just like him.

1737
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:43,574
Negative is someone else's,
print & development is by another.

1738
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:44,804
You mean?

1739
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,578
Had you expressed your love
when I told you?

1740
01:54:49,782 --> 01:54:51,647
Anger is something you
must tell to know it,

1741
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:54,176
love is something you must
know without expressing it.

1742
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:55,481
No use in talking about it.

1743
01:54:55,688 --> 01:54:58,418
Padhu will be happy if her
brother-in-law marries Seetha.

1744
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:00,156
That's more important now.

1745
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:02,926
I too loved a girl 25 years ago.

1746
01:55:03,129 --> 01:55:06,326
Suddenly a man came and
spoiled our love story.

1747
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:09,095
Should my son also face
the same fate?

1748
01:55:09,302 --> 01:55:10,599
What's wrong in your love, father?

1749
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:12,365
Your love is pure.

1750
01:55:13,106 --> 01:55:14,539
It won.

1751
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,140
But I'll not keep quiet in your matter.

1752
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:17,832
I'll make your love win.

1753
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,773
If my love is pure,
I don't need your help.

1754
01:55:22,682 --> 01:55:25,947
To tell about Padhu, I must tell
about the energy she has.

1755
01:55:26,953 --> 01:55:28,511
What great energy!

1756
01:55:28,721 --> 01:55:31,918
Are you fine doctor?

1757
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:33,250
You are...?

1758
01:55:33,459 --> 01:55:34,517
Didn't recognize me?

1759
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:37,863
You! Your wife had an abortion, right?

1760
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:39,522
How is she now?

1761
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:41,731
She wasn't my wife, just a friend.

1762
01:55:42,502 --> 01:55:45,027
She's fine now.
- Okay, bye.

1763
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:47,033
Please drop me at hospital.

1764
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:56,138
Did Padhu had an abortion too?

1765
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:59,213
No need to rake up the past.

1766
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:04,319
How?

1767
01:56:04,857 --> 01:56:07,553
How? Asking a silly
question like a kid.

1768
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,890
I mean... what made her go for it?

1769
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:18,336
On a rainy night...

1770
01:56:19,706 --> 01:56:21,230
Padhu's family didn't
have an umbrella.

1771
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:23,341
Umbrella...?
- I mean umbrella.

1772
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,175
If you stop me, I'll not tell you.

1773
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:28,843
She came upstairs for umbrella.

1774
01:56:30,216 --> 01:56:34,016
I was alone then.
- Were you alone?

1775
01:56:34,887 --> 01:56:36,855
In a weak moment...

1776
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:43,085
Has Padhu's stinginess drove
her to this condition?

1777
01:56:47,734 --> 01:56:49,201
Can't she buy an umbrella?

1778
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:52,603
It's all a strange game
played by the fate.

1779
01:56:53,673 --> 01:56:55,868
We are puppets...
- ...in the hands of God.

1780
01:56:56,909 --> 01:56:58,809
How do you know that?
- We too watch Telugu films.

1781
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:03,139
Enough of the drinks, come.

1782
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:14,719
Your mother, your sisters,
some useless guy,

1783
01:57:14,927 --> 01:57:16,622
never allow us to speak privately.

1784
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:17,896
What do you want to talk with me?

1785
01:57:19,532 --> 01:57:23,229
I'm going to marry you, how come
Nandu knows all the details?

1786
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:24,926
Are you feeling hurt?

1787
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:31,240
If you're so hurt,
why do you want to marry me?

1788
01:57:31,677 --> 01:57:34,237
Can't you marry an innocent
virgin like my sister?

1789
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:36,739
Forget about your sister.

1790
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:42,076
I heard Nandu speaking to the doctor.
About your abortion.

1791
01:57:43,823 --> 01:57:45,757
Brother-in-law, that is...

1792
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:49,583
Even if you hadn't aborted it,
I would've accepted you with the child.

1793
01:57:56,636 --> 01:57:58,001
How broadminded I am.

1794
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:02,139
Who is he now?

1795
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:09,110
Give him Rs.100.
- Rs.100? Why?

1796
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:11,110
Nandu used to pay him like that only.

1797
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:18,212
If we close the windows,
he thinks we are kissing inside.

1798
01:58:45,351 --> 01:58:47,979
He thinks Nandu is better
partner to me than you.

1799
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:58,429
Sunday, I mean day after tomorrow.
We are not getting engaged.

1800
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:00,660
We are marrying.

1801
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:36,857
A marriage I don't want.
How can I go ahead, Nandu?

1802
01:59:38,004 --> 01:59:38,800
How?

1803
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:44,133
I can't bear anymore.
I can't.

1804
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:14,832
What are you doing at this hour?

1805
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:23,579
What happened?

1806
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:27,419
Tomorrow I'm getting married.
- Okay, so what?

1807
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:40,422
Can I cry here for sometime?

1808
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:52,771
When I used to cry as little girl,
father used to put hand on head...

1809
02:01:01,387 --> 02:01:05,380
he used to console saying
I'll get what I wish.

1810
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:15,628
Calm down, you'll get what you want.

1811
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:43,991
Don't know why?
I felt like crying in your presence.

1812
02:01:49,468 --> 02:01:51,333
I'm not marrying you.
- What happened now?

1813
02:01:52,204 --> 02:01:55,002
Don't explain anything.
I saw everything.

1814
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,573
Your physical relations...

1815
02:02:02,248 --> 02:02:06,184
After knowing you're so close
to a man emotionally...

1816
02:02:26,138 --> 02:02:29,539
Brother-in-law!
- No problem, Seetha. Cry!

1817
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:34,776
I'm not crying.
- Don't you also want to cry before me?

1818
02:02:46,325 --> 02:02:49,954
I've hurt you so much.
Hurt you terribly.

1819
02:02:50,896 --> 02:02:57,062
The people I hurt must cry before me.
Cry Seetha, you must cry.

1820
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:01,996
You must cry before me.
Tomorrow we are getting engaged.

1821
02:03:14,787 --> 02:03:18,587
By God's grace everything
he settled on his own.- Yes brother.

1822
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:22,420
At last you got caught with me
as bride's father.

1823
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:27,256
I'm not a girl's father
but three girls.

1824
02:03:27,633 --> 02:03:30,932
In fact all the girls in my constituency
are like my daughters.

1825
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:34,337
Don't get so emotional.
People may misunderstand you.

1826
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:36,440
Not you, you carry on, priest.

1827
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:40,611
It's time, exchange the proposals.

1828
02:03:44,316 --> 02:03:45,316
Take it.

1829
02:03:46,318 --> 02:03:47,285
Give.

1830
02:03:58,230 --> 02:03:59,288
What are you thinking?

1831
02:04:02,168 --> 02:04:04,136
Thinking about you.
- About me?

1832
02:04:04,503 --> 02:04:05,470
What are you thinking?

1833
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:12,142
Why don't you tell me?

1834
02:04:14,013 --> 02:04:21,013
Yesterday you brought leaf plates,
you gave Rs.24 less in change.

1835
02:04:21,754 --> 02:04:22,982
That's I was calculating.

1836
02:04:24,089 --> 02:04:25,989
I thought it could be
something romantic.

1837
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:27,754
What did you expect?

1838
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:59,384
You're in my heart...
Love is keeping my heart ticking...

1839
02:05:02,561 --> 02:05:07,362
What didn't happen for years...
may've happened in few days...

1840
02:05:07,566 --> 02:05:12,629
I'm for you and you're for me...

1841
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:17,207
I was floating air to reach you...

1842
02:05:17,743 --> 02:05:22,646
Right before my eyes...

1843
02:05:22,848 --> 02:05:27,217
it's only you before my eyes...

1844
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:53,400
Happiness and friendship is you...

1845
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:58,572
Self respect and experience is you...

1846
02:05:58,784 --> 02:06:03,744
You're my wish and desire...

1847
02:06:03,956 --> 02:06:10,956
You're my word, life,
spirit and soul...

1848
02:07:40,552 --> 02:07:42,076
In a critical condition.

1849
02:07:42,421 --> 02:07:44,355
Have you found a donor
for the operation?

1850
02:07:49,428 --> 02:07:52,864
Her mother gave him birth is seventh
month unable to carry him.

1851
02:07:53,065 --> 02:07:54,223
That's why he's hasty in everything.

1852
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,029
Stop joking about him.
Have coffee.

1853
02:07:58,237 --> 02:08:00,603
Don't come before him
in such fine dress,

1854
02:08:00,906 --> 02:08:03,204
he may change mind and
decide to marry you.

1855
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:07,935
By God's grace he has agreed
to marry my elder daughter.

1856
02:08:08,313 --> 02:08:09,371
That's enough for us, brother.

1857
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:15,217
Not a queen, buddy.

1858
02:08:16,321 --> 02:08:18,551
Our Casanova would've taken the queen.

1859
02:08:18,757 --> 02:08:21,555
As they were entering
the room... he has come.

1860
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:36,440
Jangaiah is in hospital,
his condition is very serious.- Serious?

1861
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:39,236
Which hospital?

1862
02:08:44,616 --> 02:08:45,514
He won!

1863
02:09:28,761 --> 02:09:30,126
Have you come, Nandu?

1864
02:09:31,663 --> 02:09:33,460
You'll give me your eyes
and heart, won't you?

1865
02:09:33,665 --> 02:09:35,633
I've already written it in your favour.
Take it.

1866
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:41,133
You're a brave man.
I know it.

1867
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:46,377
I'm almost dying.

1868
02:09:54,686 --> 02:09:56,313
My son Bharath.

1869
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:02,388
Mother is dead.
Father is dying.

1870
02:10:04,763 --> 02:10:11,259
I'm handing him over to you.
He needs your eyes,

1871
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:19,404
show him the world as you see.

1872
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:23,678
He needs your heart,

1873
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:30,982
your heart which loves all,
teach him to love at least few,

1874
02:10:31,557 --> 02:10:32,854
take him,

1875
02:10:34,893 --> 02:10:38,294
that's why I made you bequeath
your eyes and heart,

1876
02:10:40,098 --> 02:10:43,033
please forgive me...

1877
02:10:46,338 --> 02:10:47,862
From now Bharath is my younger brother.

1878
02:10:49,741 --> 02:10:55,202
Your heart is abode of God.

1879
02:11:12,598 --> 02:11:14,657
No animal fears it's own ilk,

1880
02:11:15,434 --> 02:11:17,902
but why should humans
fear their own ilk?

1881
02:11:19,638 --> 02:11:21,936
You were scared of what Jangaiah
would take from me,

1882
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:25,233
did you see now? He gave something
before leaving the world.

1883
02:11:26,278 --> 02:11:27,677
He gave me a younger brother.

1884
02:11:28,614 --> 02:11:31,845
I was never afraid of Jangaiah.
Do you know why?

1885
02:11:32,784 --> 02:11:33,614
Faith!

1886
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,247
I've total faith in humans.

1887
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:38,917
I've faith in humanity.

1888
02:11:38,942 --> 02:11:42,942
