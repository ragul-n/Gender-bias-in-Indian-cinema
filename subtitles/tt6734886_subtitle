1
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,328
Hello, Paandi! Haven't seen you around
these past two days?

2
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:15,484
I went jogging at the beach.

3
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,175
Right!

4
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,148
Paandi, come eat a couple of idlies?

5
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,798
After jogging, I shall work out, shower
and then eat.

6
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:27,739
Oh, wow.

7
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:34,914
Hello, Master!

8
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:38,257
Thank you for catching that dope dealer.
You've earned us a good name, Master!

9
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:39,464
I've only done my duty.

10
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,203
Who is this guy?
So cool for his age.

11
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,140
His name is 'Power' Pandian.

12
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,218
He was a great stunt-master
in movies.

13
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:48,046
He's a famous guy
in our area.

14
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,898
Pack some meat for her, boy.

15
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,972
Look, Master is here.
Give him the meat.

16
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,430
I've packed the usual, Master.

17
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,914
I've also packed liver and
intestines, too. - Thank you!

18
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,265
I've been waiting for so long.
- Wait for your turn!

19
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:08,630
I turned it on the way you said.
But it suddenly got loud!

20
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:10,906
I finished a night shift
and just went to sleep, dad.

21
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,188
I need to go back to work
in some time now.

22
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,195
I'm so sleep deprived.

23
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,306
Why are you like this, dad?

24
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,072
We only get to sleep on weekends.
The kids don't have school, either.

25
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:35,051
Your father has just returned
from a night shoot.

26
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:36,271
You've woken him up!

27
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,906
He barely gets sleep.
Turn down the volume.

28
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:40,457
Let him watch.

29
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,110
Grandpa!

30
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,754
Little ones! Come to grandpa.

31
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:12,825
Punch!

32
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:14,415
Side punch!

33
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,148
Varun, if you don't study, no meal for you.
- Then I'll starve.

34
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,883
Leave me alone, dad.
I will study later.

35
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,348
You're always playing on your iPhone!
Come down!

36
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,749
Fine, dad!
Stop yelling.

37
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:26,899
So, Varun.
You're getting the full dose today?

38
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,221
Why won't you just study?

39
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,468
It's not like you're educated.

40
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:32,724
You're doing alright.

41
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,083
Always playing on your iPad!

42
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,383
You should run and play!
Your body will become fit.

43
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:39,864
I take my vitamins, man.
I'm fit enough.

44
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,099
In my time, 10-15 of us would get together
and play kabaddi, volley-ball.

45
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,207
We had fit bodies.

46
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,484
I haven't seen you playing even cricket!

47
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,526
When you hit oldage, you people start off your
'Back in my time...' speech.

48
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,259
Go practice your 'dishyoom' now.

49
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:57,952
Who do you fight anyway?

50
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:00,386
Go study, boy.

51
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:02,142
Father-in-law, your scutch-grass juice.

52
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,098
Please take the children to some mall?

53
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,490
I can't handle them on weekends!

54
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,738
You're saying that for two kids?

55
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:15,487
My mother raised six children!
I was the youngest of them.

56
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,767
Really?
Then why did YOU stop after one son?

57
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,534
Double standards, huh?

58
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,309
Get ready now. Let's eat breakfast.

59
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,168
We're just not able to have
a second child.

60
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:31,499
So what?
We'll just be happy with one child.

61
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,167
It's not that...

62
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:37,708
When we have many children,
if not one, another son will take care of us.

63
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,037
My son is not like that.
He will take such good care of us, you'll see.

64
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,662
Take them away!

65
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,454
Let's go?
- Yes, let's go!

66
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,675
Father-in-law, your coffee.

67
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,159
I've been seeing for years now...

68
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,350
you're wasting time on this
rusty old motorcycle you never ride!

69
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,092
Someday, I'll take it out for a spin.

70
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,495
What's the problem?

71
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,263
The car won't start.
- Is it?

72
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,691
Man, what have you done?

73
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,407
The car wouldn't start, so I pushed it.

74
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,067
That's my car!

75
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:16,744
Sir...

76
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,367
Is this stunt master 'Power' Paandi's house?

77
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,044
Yes, sir.
What is the problem?

78
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,337
What does he care
if someone somewhere sells stuff?

79
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:26,781
Your kids, huh?

80
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:29,921
Sweet family.

81
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:31,995
Don't you want to live in peace?

82
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,726
Ask him to go to temples or something
at this age.

83
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:38,291
He's an old man.
Why should he do this?

84
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,708
I've done my duty now.
Ask him to take back his complaint.

85
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,387
Or you'll be in trouble.

86
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,624
Let's go.

87
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,104
Go upstairs and bring your grandpa, Dhruv.

88
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,669
What is it?

89
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,056
What have you done now?

90
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,182
Fine, don't just stand there.
Go.

91
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,080
You called me, son?

92
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,646
What complaint did you file
at the police station?

93
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:19,697
Yes...

94
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,279
They're selling drugs.
In our area!

95
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:23,841
I can't stay quiet about it!

96
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,325
How is that our problem, dad?
Why can't you just stay out of it?

97
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,889
How could I!

98
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,536
Children in their formative years
will wreck their lives!

99
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,648
Those policemen are on their side, you know.

100
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,797
They're threatening us
to take back the complaint.

101
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,244
So?

102
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:38,841
We can't stand by and watch.

103
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,877
You have two children, too.

104
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,255
If they were to be exposed to drugs,
would you be fine with it?

105
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,471
Dad, I'm not interested in social service.

106
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,380
Please retract the case tomorrow.

107
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:48,645
Why are you scolding grandpa?

108
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:49,727
Go to your room!

109
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:51,044
Why are you scolding me?

110
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,580
Go upstairs, child.
I'll be right there.

111
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:56,788
Watch it.

112
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,776
What do you want from me?

113
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,755
Take back your complaint
first thing in the morning.

114
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,145
I'm begging you. Please.

115
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:12,461
You're going to school to study.
But you're always picking fights.

116
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,310
He hit me first, dad.

117
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:20,960
Your teacher insulted me,
asking me not to teach my cinema fights to my son.

118
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,367
Sorry, dad.

119
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,958
How will "sorry" cut it?

120
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,192
Let it go.
He's learning from you.

121
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,377
There are good things to learn from me, too!

122
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:33,599
Okay.

123
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:34,794
I'll take back the case.

124
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:35,819
Sign here.

125
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,747
I didn't do anything.
Please tell the inspector!

126
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,356
Get home now, grandpa.

127
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,283
Just mind your business now.

128
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,396
Don't poke your nose
in unnecessary things.

129
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,629
Don't come to the station.

130
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,885
So, grandpa!

131
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:53,404
Got scared?

132
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,968
You placed a complaint like some big-shot.
Now you're running like a fraidy cat.

133
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,076
What?

134
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,679
Boohoo!
Oldie is glaring at me.

135
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,494
Want to fight me, huh?

136
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:08,628
One on one.

137
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:10,278
Come on. Want to fight?

138
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:18,808
Take back your complaint
first thing in the morning.

139
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,869
Good for you.
Walk away!

140
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:24,144
Grizzly old fool!

141
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,858
He's messing with us
in our area!

142
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,728
I showed him!

143
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:34,696
Dad!

144
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:36,917
You took your complaint back?

145
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:37,942
I did.

146
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,349
Okay.

147
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:44,634
Why haven't you gone to sleep?
You've been working all day.

148
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,350
It's an important file.
I need it for the morning.

149
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,938
Master, got yourself a high dosage huh?

150
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,792
At this age,
why do you even bother doing all this?

151
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:57,042
Talk about my age again
and I'll knock your teeth off.

152
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,311
You won't admit it.

153
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:00,861
Is that beer?

154
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,579
Yes. Take a sip?

155
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:03,886
And ruin my health?

156
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:07,495
You don't do anything fun.
What's the point in living those extra 30 - 40 years?

157
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,597
You don't find happiness at home either.
What's the point of such a life?

158
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,732
What's wrong with my life?
He's given me my own room- Full freedom.

159
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,725
And two cute grandchildren!
What more could one want?

160
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,084
You're living for your son and grandchildren.
In my opinion, you don't have a life.

161
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,009
Anyway, Master.
Whatever makes you happy.

162
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,117
Here he comes. The Hitler.

163
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,817
Grandpa, don't talk to him.

164
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:34,331
Dude, you're the reason my grandpa's
always getting into trouble.

165
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,832
Grandpa, you better come
with me now!

166
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,402
Your grandson beckons!
- Get lost.

167
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:40,244
He'll abuse me more. Off I go!

168
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,714
He's corrupting you, grandpa!

169
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,017
Grizzly old fool!

170
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:52,318
What is it?

171
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:56,345
He had to submit this important file,
but he's left it behind at home!

172
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,829
Call up his phone?

173
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:59,963
He doesn't answer his phone
while driving, father-in-law.

174
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,361
Give it to me, then.
I'll give it to him.

175
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:03,517
How will you go, father-in-law?
- I'll take an auto-rickshaw.

176
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,959
Is that okay?
- No problem at all!

177
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:06,488
Thank you, father-in-law.

178
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,967
Hold on, sir.
Wait!

179
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,486
Whom do you want to see?
- I need to give this file to Manager Raghavan.

180
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,880
Please give me your ID card.
Or you can't see him.

181
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,673
It's an important file.
I must give it to him.

182
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,443
You can't see him like that, sir.

183
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm a stunt master called 'Power' Paandi...

184
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,759
You're Paandian, sir?
- Yes.

185
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:35,659
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Please go.

186
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,923
Why have you come to office, dad?

187
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:41,784
You left this file behind, it seems.

188
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:43,306
Why did you bring it, dad?

189
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:44,884
You said it's an important file?

190
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,993
If not today,
I'd have submitted it tomorrow.

191
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:48,310
Anyway, thanks.

192
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,236
How will you get home now?
- I'll take an auto-rickshaw.

193
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:52,786
Sure?
- Sure!

194
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,256
Okay. Get home safe.
- Okay!

195
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,861
Sir, this is the security
from downstairs.

196
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,330
Your father has been
standing here for an hour.

197
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:10,664
I think he's unable to find a ride.

198
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,272
Could you please take a look?

199
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:24,539
Why are you still standing here, dad?

200
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,336
You walked out of work?

201
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,561
You can't find a ride?

202
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:29,581
I'll manage!
I will find one.

203
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:31,605
Fine, I'll drop you home.

204
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,385
I'll be fine.
Don't trouble yourself.

205
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,446
Son, aren't you late for work?

206
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:46,971
Yes. But what can I do.

207
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,642
Thank you.

208
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,557
Buy a taller car.
It's hard to get down.

209
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,259
Drive safe!

210
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,205
Who asked you to bring the file?

211
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,022
I thought it's an important--
- That's my problem.

212
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,541
I'd have given it the next day.

213
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,517
Who asked you to come?

214
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,080
I wanted to be of help.

215
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,151
No, thank you!

216
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,197
Don't do anything!

217
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,612
Just don't do anything.
That would be a great help.

218
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,074
Go away, dad.

219
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:16,298
Don't get worked up.

220
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:18,791
I got so worked up,
I rammed the car and got it dented.

221
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,832
This time, it was the car.
What if it had been me?

222
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,030
Why do you talk like that, son?

223
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,368
Dad, just go.
Go away!

224
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,339
It's okay, grandpa.
Don't feel bad.

225
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,422
Sakshi, erase this and write it again.

226
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,296
Hi, grandpa!

227
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,451
I need to talk to you.

228
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,296
What's the matter, dad?

229
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:05,164
All this trouble happens
because I'm always home.

230
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:09,005
I'm thinking I'll get a job.

231
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,631
What do you need to
work and make money for?

232
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,935
You do take very good care of me.

233
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,877
And I've saved up some money, too.

234
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:23,461
I just need something to pass the time.

235
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,013
Must you really go to work?

236
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:27,589
I feel it's better if I do.

237
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,251
What job will you get at this age?

238
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,666
Eight!

239
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,671
Seven. Six.

240
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,248
Five. Four more.

241
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:38,687
Four.

242
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,964
One.

243
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,435
Relax.

244
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:43,365
Where's dad?
He's gone jogging?

245
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,882
He woke up at six
and left to the gym.

246
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,155
He's just being dramatic.

247
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:52,001
Look, if you want your body
to be strong and muscular...

248
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,275
you must drink porridge
made from finger millet.

249
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,970
What millet?
- Finger millet!

250
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:55,720
Finger millet!

251
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:58,370
Mr. Paandi, you must not ask them
to drink millet porridge!

252
00:21:58,612 --> 00:21:59,612
Protein shakes.

253
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:01,578
We're selling it right here
at the gym.

254
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:05,087
If you want to get muscles,
drink protein shake!

255
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,382
Okay, sir.

256
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,266
Grandpa, you're here already?

257
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,181
The gym only opens at six.

258
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,039
Open up.

259
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,603
You won't see results
if you don't do your reps.

260
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,003
Oh, I'm done.

261
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:24,419
So, Master!

262
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:25,906
Long time no see.

263
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,229
Been busy?

264
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:29,814
I'm not  jobless like you.
I've got work!

265
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:33,146
I know. From a stunt master,
you've become a gym master now?

266
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:37,196
One must work hard to earn a living.
That's a different feeling.

267
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:39,512
You've got your nose in your iPad.
You're so unfit!

268
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,464
Come join the gym.
I'll make you fit.

269
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:43,482
Workout?

270
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:46,368
I can't!

271
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:48,236
Slow down, man. I can't!

272
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,261
Two.

273
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:50,400
One.

274
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:51,837
Relax.

275
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:54,181
Relax?
Don't lie, there's four more left.

276
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,370
You should know whom to push,
and how much!

277
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:06,868
He was a puny fellow. You made him do
too many reps and now he's bedridden.

278
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,581
He's been hospitalised with a broken muscle.

279
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:11,095
Our job is to make the client strong!

280
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:14,334
You're not academically qualified.
I shouldn't have appointed you.

281
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,573
I've made a mistake.

282
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:18,123
This is not some cinema stunt,
that anybody can do.

283
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,135
Look.

284
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:21,451
You're crossing a line.

285
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,681
Think anyone can do a cinema stunt?

286
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:25,835
Wanna fight?

287
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Huh?
- Stop!

288
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,138
What?

289
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:30,026
Fool.

290
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:32,206
I don't need you
or your job.

291
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,820
Never speak ill of any trade.

292
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,118
Forgive me.

293
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:47,979
He picks a fight everywhere.
Who would hire him?

294
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,319
Who asked him to work anyway?

295
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:54,845
He could just sit quietly.
He's threatening people around like some thug.

296
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,132
Why do you laugh?

297
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:04,955
It's just...

298
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,938
You said you'd work hard to earn a living!
Now you're also a loafer like me.

299
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:12,071
See, Master.
Jobs may come and go.

300
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,979
This state of joblessness is perpetual.

301
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:16,845
Proud of it, huh?

302
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:19,720
You're jobless and you carry a beer around.

303
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,545
You're not a trainer anymore.
Stop lecturing.

304
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:25,123
I'm in love with a girl.

305
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,704
But she won't even look at me.

306
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,821
She makes me run behind her.

307
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:30,040
So I'm all depressed.

308
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:31,232
That's why I'm drinking beer.

309
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,411
You're depressed about that?
How many girlfriends have you had?

310
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,289
Being cocky, grandpa?

311
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,051
My first love.

312
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,980
I message, and she replies.

313
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:42,005
But as a friend.

314
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:44,104
I call her,
and she talks to me.

315
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:45,129
But as a friend.

316
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:48,143
I ask to meet,
and she meets me- as a friend.

317
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,174
I think she's friend-zoned me.

318
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:54,161
How do I tell her I like her
like a girlfriend?

319
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:55,092
I'll tell you?

320
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:56,288
Yeah!

321
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:58,116
Just tell her.

322
00:24:58,504 --> 00:24:59,254
Huh?

323
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:03,770
Tell her, 'I'd like you as my girlfriend'.
Fraidy cat!

324
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:05,457
Aren't you ashamed?

325
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:13,184
iPhones, iPads, PlayStation, Skype,
Facetime, chatting, WhatsApp, SMS...

326
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,230
what's the point of all this?

327
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,221
You don't have the gall to
tell a girl you love her!

328
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:20,983
You've never been in love,
so you wouldn't know it's burden!

329
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,395
You know that I've never been in love?

330
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,413
What do you mean?
You had a love-marriage?

331
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:27,520
No.

332
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:28,504
Oh, man!

333
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,067
You loved some woman
before your marriage?

334
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,994
Yes, my first love.

335
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,641
Oh, give me the details.

336
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,805
I'll tell you some other day.

337
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:41,445
Now my mind is occupied
with ideas for a new job.

338
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:42,793
You're going back to work?

339
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,082
What work?

340
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,539
Seize him!

341
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:55,965
I don't care how you do it,
by nightfall, tell me you've killed him.

342
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,051
You write an exam to pass.
I'll squish him like tomatoes with my gaze.

343
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:00,765
Cut.

344
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,231
Oh, he's started.
Those dialogues were not even in the scene paper.

345
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:06,325
Excuse me, Mr. Gautham.
Please come forward.

346
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,534
Don't cover me.

347
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,517
Thought we could do a low angle?
Will be more good, no?

348
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:13,207
Really?

349
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:14,401
Really.

350
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,809
Go, go.

351
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:19,126
I was thinking,
we could drop the 'tomato' dialogue?

352
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:21,772
Gautam! This is your film.

353
00:26:22,402 --> 00:26:25,942
That's why I used the word 'tomato'.
Or do you know the word I'd normally use?

354
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,379
Let's go for the take,
don't waste my time, Gau.

355
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:29,946
Okay, sir.
- Wipe my face.

356
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,885
Come. But don't touch.

357
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,993
Go away.

358
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:35,102
You come closer.

359
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:38,565
We need somebody mature
for the goon's dialogue.

360
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,471
Him?

361
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,159
No, I said someone mature.

362
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:46,018
Could you speak this dialogue, Master?

363
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,601
Get him to learn the dialogues.

364
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,206
You've got two minutes.

365
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,831
'Whatever the boss orders,
this servant shall do.'

366
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:56,799
'Boss, whatever you order,
this servant shall do it.'

367
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,317
It's in interior...

368
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:06,170
It's set in interior,
so we could lose the sunglasses?

369
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:08,528
If I take off the glasses,
my fans wouldn't like it, Gautam.

370
00:27:08,553 --> 00:27:10,136
My fans!

371
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,299
Sir, the coolers?

372
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:14,252
He won't take them off.
What can I do?

373
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,042
Ready? Ready, Master.
Take!

374
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,422
Roll camera... and action!

375
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,323
Boss...

376
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:26,377
Cut!

377
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,296
What happened, Master?

378
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,807
Sorry, sir. One more take.
- Okay, Master.

379
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:31,332
Come on, Gau.
- Ready, guys.

380
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:34,815
Roll cameras... ready.
Action!

381
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:38,651
Boss, whatever you say...

382
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:39,738
Cut!

383
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,722
I don't like that, Gau.
- Master!

384
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,581
Sorry, sir.
- It's a simple dialogue, Master.

385
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:47,104
First time in front of camera
so I'm a little nervous.

386
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,315
I will do it, sir.
- Okay.

387
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,135
Shall we change the person?

388
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,972
No, let him do it.
- Okay, sir.

389
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:53,580
Ready, Master. Let's go.

390
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,757
Ready?

391
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:55,969
Ready.

392
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:58,638
Roll cameras.
- Rolling.

393
00:27:58,663 --> 00:27:59,663
And action.

394
00:28:00,534 --> 00:28:01,409
Boss...

395
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,467
Cut it.

396
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,599
Gautam! Don't waste my time.

397
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:07,575
Change the funny guy.

398
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:09,931
He's a stunt master.
- Like he's some master-chef.

399
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:13,099
Sorry, Master.

400
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:15,870
The hero is getting stressed.
We'll do another scene, I'll tell you.

401
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:18,170
True. We mustn't waste time.
- Okay, Master. Thank you.

402
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:29,490
What happened next, grandpa?

403
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:30,701
What happened?

404
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:35,434
I finished my dialogue, in a single take
and the entire set applauded.

405
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,084
Superb, grandpa.
- Of course.

406
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:38,359
Your grandpa is not just anybody.

407
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:42,700
The director said I must do
a big role!

408
00:28:42,773 --> 00:28:43,865
Do it, grandpa!

409
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:47,027
But, dear. If grandpa starts acting...

410
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,398
the other actors would feel insecure.

411
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,548
If you become a big actor,
I'd show off!

412
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:54,528
Dear, acting is just boring.

413
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,075
Your grandpa is a fighter!
Much better.

414
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:58,716
Father-in-law, Manager Chockalingam
is on the phone.

415
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,477
Mom, can we watch wrestling?

416
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:02,246
Tell me, Chocku!
- There's a fight scene tomorrow.

417
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:04,113
A fight?
- 8 AM.

418
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,826
I'll be there by eight!

419
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,956
He never comes to eat early.
What's up with him?

420
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,552
Father-in-law...

421
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,440
Where are you going so early?

422
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,656
I've got a fight sequence today.

423
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,094
I must go there on time.

424
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,565
Then we pan right...

425
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,250
It's Pandian Master!

426
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:45,735
'Power' Paandi Master has come.

427
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:48,495
How are you?

428
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,436
Welcome, Master.

429
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,503
Hello!

430
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:56,191
Where is the Master?
- He's there.

431
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:57,854
Thanks.

432
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,373
Why does everyone respect him so much?

433
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:04,673
You're new here.

434
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:08,495
There was a time,when all stunt-men
wanted to be 'Power' Paandi.

435
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:11,549
All the stars would wait
for his dates.

436
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:15,052
Good morning, Master.

437
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:18,456
Master,  'Power' Paandi master is here.

438
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:20,793
Master, I'm sorry!

439
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,729
I didn't notice. How are you, Master?
- I'm so glad, Master.

440
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,199
Thank you for giving me this chance.
- Oh, come on.

441
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:28,557
I'm so proud to have you
in my stunt.

442
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,761
Master, are you ready?
- Ready!

443
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:36,786
Want to rehearse?
Or...

444
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,186
We'll go for the take.
- Sure?

445
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:39,995
First, a right miss.
Then a left miss.

446
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,096
A leg miss, a front kick miss.

447
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,325
A back miss.

448
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,049
A right weapon miss, left weapon miss,
then a double miss.

449
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:47,424
Superb, Master!
This is your forte.

450
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,032
Superb.

451
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:49,932
Boys, ready.
Velraj sir, is the camera ready?

452
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:51,040
Ready!

453
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:52,503
Roll cameras.

454
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:53,403
Rolling.

455
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,703
Action!

456
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:06,235
Cut.

457
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:16,443
Master, you were great!

458
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,373
Superb, Master!

459
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:51,453
Thank you, Master!
- You're doing such a great job.

460
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,206
Bless me, Master.
- Don't touch my feet.

461
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:54,251
Thank you.
- Not at all, Master.

462
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:55,901
I'm so happy.
- So long.

463
00:32:58,318 --> 00:32:59,527
Master,  I'll drop you home.

464
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:00,635
I'll walk home.

465
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:47,964
Schoolboy, come here.
- What, brother?

466
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:50,178
Check if he's got money.

467
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:51,864
I don't have money.

468
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:55,997
Just take it from him.
- But I don't have money, promise!

469
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:59,768
I only have fifty rupees to pay a school fine...
- You must pay for dope.

470
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:00,626
Look!

471
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:13,283
Hey, kid.

472
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,985
Come here.

473
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:20,212
What are you studying?
- Twelfth grade.

474
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:21,773
What do you want to be?
- An engineer.

475
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:23,088
My foot.

476
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:28,790
If you buy stuff at this age,
you'll be sitting there selling it someday.

477
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,308
Are you in love with some girl?

478
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,906
Does she love you back?

479
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:34,018
Why would she?

480
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:36,501
Your parents are toiling
to put you through school.

481
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:41,648
Study well, become an engineer,
marry the girl you love and live happily.

482
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:43,445
Don't you want that life?

483
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,255
Don't you?
Then throw that packet away.

484
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,402
Go.

485
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:52,544
I don't want to see you here again.

486
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:05,066
This is the old fool
who complained about us at the police station?

487
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:06,069
Yeah, boss.

488
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:07,594
And his name was some...

489
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:10,514
Can't recall his name.

490
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:13,041
Grandpa, won't you be quiet?

491
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,188
You're bored?

492
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:17,671
You give sermons to my customers,
won't my business take a hit?

493
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:20,443
You feel bad that we're selling to him?

494
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,093
We make spiked candy.
What about that?

495
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:28,881
Look, grandpa is pissed!

496
00:37:28,906 --> 00:37:30,561
Wanna fight, grandpa?

497
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,429
Come  on. Wanna fight?
Let's fight.

498
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,378
Why do you pick trouble
with an old man?

499
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,800
Just let him be.

500
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:38,560
Granny, you're his girl?

501
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,382
I am ageing a little, huh?

502
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:08,339
Who trashed my bed?

503
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,826
Oh. I'm in the market.

504
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,159
They're sleeping like little babies.

505
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:18,559
Who's that?

506
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,760
Oh no!

507
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,147
You said you forgot my name?

508
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,506
I'm Paandi.

509
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:25,721
'Power' Paandi.

510
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:28,142
Now you'll remember my name.

511
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:34,844
Get out of my way!

512
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:38,202
Prema!
- Grandpa is home.

513
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,577
Wait, little one. I'll come.

514
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,939
Prema!
- Yes, father-in-law?

515
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:45,481
I've got mutton.
Cook an elaborate dinner?

516
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:48,089
What's up, father-in-law?
- I'll tell you.

517
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,247
After so long, I was in the sets and...

518
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:56,255
all the young fighters touched my feet
to seek my blessings.

519
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:58,022
They look up to me.

520
00:40:58,293 --> 00:41:01,418
'Bullet' Raj is the Number- 1 stunt master
of this time.

521
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:03,591
He took my blessings, too.

522
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:05,178
Come here, kids.

523
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:06,619
Come on.
Come to grandpa.

524
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,091
Wanna know how your grandpa
fought today?

525
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:14,372
All in my first take!

526
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:16,553
Everyone around me applauded.

527
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:19,630
You said the same thing yesterday.

528
00:41:19,655 --> 00:41:20,879
That was different.

529
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:22,184
Today, they actually did it.

530
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:23,876
So you bluffed yesterday?

531
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:25,872
No, this was a fight!

532
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:27,049
Raghava...

533
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:30,567
The fighters treat me like a legend.

534
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,678
I got so emotional.

535
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:37,763
Prema, after a long time,
I'm really hungry.

536
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,716
I want to eat till I'm full.

537
00:41:39,962 --> 00:41:41,170
Cook a great meal!

538
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:46,507
'I searched this Google and everything...'

539
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:52,598
'Never found anything as good as mutton'

540
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:56,403
Sir!

541
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:57,551
Who is it?

542
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,458
I've come to take your father in.

543
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:06,083
A complaint has been filed against him.

544
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:08,111
Who has filed?
What's the complaint?

545
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:10,387
He's beat up 10 - 15 men
and broken their limbs.

546
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:12,663
Obviously, we must take him in.

547
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:14,397
Fine, let's go.

548
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,004
What is this?
- My fate.

549
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,186
Sign here.

550
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:32,793
He wants to do our job?

551
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:36,747
Mind your own business.

552
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:38,605
He beat up our guys.

553
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,422
I've put them in a hospital.
Ask him to compensate.

554
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,156
I've incurred expenses.

555
00:42:44,365 --> 00:42:45,824
Really, sir!

556
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,051
I'll pay.

557
00:42:48,822 --> 00:42:52,947
Take care of this guy, then meet the writer.
We'll work it out.

558
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,040
I've lost all my respect and dignity.

559
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:16,228
So, Master...

560
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:18,407
Heard the police came home
looking for you?

561
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:21,422
The things I don't even do in my age,
you're doing at your age!

562
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,834
You're something.

563
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:27,081
I thought you were some
beefed up body-double for cinema.

564
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,517
You actually beat up
and chased away all those men?

565
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,564
You're pretty solid, huh?

566
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:37,746
Give me that.

567
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:39,611
Beer?

568
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:41,553
No way. You can't handle it.

569
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:45,703
I could chug down a barrel of toddy
all by myself.

570
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:46,965
Throw it.

571
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:49,720
You never listen.

572
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,117
Take it easy.

573
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,352
Go easy, or it'll hit you.

574
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:04,193
Another.

575
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:06,878
What's wrong with this guy?

576
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:12,186
Dude, go easy!
That's not scutch-grass juice!

577
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:17,710
He's drinking some more?

578
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:22,107
He's done.

579
00:44:25,353 --> 00:44:27,019
I've got one left. Good!

580
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:30,559
Watch it, man.
Don't die tripping on the staircase.

581
00:44:30,649 --> 00:44:33,149
The little devil would yell at me.

582
00:44:33,221 --> 00:44:34,388
Master!

583
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:10,819
What dignity have you lost?

584
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:12,797
What is it, huh?

585
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:15,120
What have I done wrong?

586
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:18,865
You took your father for a coward?

587
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:21,742
That I'll keep my mouth shut,
no matter who does what?

588
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:23,828
I'm brave.

589
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:25,157
A brave-heart!

590
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,568
Who are you to question me?

591
00:45:27,593 --> 00:45:28,760
Tell me, who are you?

592
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:32,054
The other day when a cop came...

593
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:36,334
you sent my grandson to fetch me
and then you question me?

594
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:37,711
Why?

595
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:40,799
You won't come upstairs
to speak to me?

596
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,443
Am I your father
or are you mine?

597
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:49,909
The other day, I accidentally turned
the TV volume high...

598
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,268
and so much drama!

599
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:55,760
'Oh, he toiled all night!'
and 'I ruined his sleep'.

600
00:45:57,372 --> 00:46:04,080
So many sleepless nights I've toiled
just to raise you.

601
00:46:04,734 --> 00:46:07,487
Who will answer
for all the sleep I've lost?

602
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:08,751
Have I ever asked you?

603
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,271
You see this thigh?
It's torn from glass-breaking.

604
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,899
17 stitches.

605
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,272
For whom?

606
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:17,860
For you.

607
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,733
How long I've been patient!

608
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,267
Your mother said...

609
00:46:23,687 --> 00:46:26,937
"He's our only son.
You are raising a fine boy."

610
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:29,290
"He will have your back someday."

611
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:31,324
How you've got my back!

612
00:46:32,596 --> 00:46:33,596
Look...

613
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,554
I don't need anyone to back me up.

614
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,253
I'll stand alone.

615
00:46:38,593 --> 00:46:39,968
I'm Paandi.

616
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:41,188
'Power' Paandi!

617
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,374
Grandpa...

618
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:45,469
Oh, my little ones...

619
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:48,113
Your grandpa lives for you.

620
00:46:52,628 --> 00:46:54,461
I can't embrace my grandkids?

621
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:56,472
I don't have the rights to do that,
in this house?

622
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,649
Raghava, tell me.

623
00:47:02,415 --> 00:47:03,415
"Raghavan"

624
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:10,016
After much thought,
I gave you the name 'Rambo'.

625
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:13,908
You gave some reason or the other
and changed it to 'Raghavan'.

626
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:15,592
What Raghavan?

627
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:20,570
Not now.
I knew even back then...

628
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:25,787
That you won't listen to your father.
That you'll do whatever pleases you.

629
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:29,791
Your mother thought
you've got my back!

630
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:33,167
It's her fault.

631
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:35,254
Wait a minute.

632
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:37,907
We're not even yet.

633
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,364
We don't know what to do.

634
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,701
But you do whatever you want.

635
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,498
Stay home, go out, get drunk,
beat up people, get arrested.

636
00:48:36,723 --> 00:48:38,306
Want to beat us up?
Go ahead.

637
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,380
We won't question you.

638
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,559
We'll stay quiet.

639
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:44,425
Isn't that what you want?

640
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,153
From now, we'll do it that way.

641
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:48,896
Only your happiness is important.

642
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,230
Where is dad?

643
00:49:16,304 --> 00:49:17,429
Upstairs.

644
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,125
The kids are asleep?

645
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:23,914
Yes, by eight o clock.

646
00:49:24,501 --> 00:49:25,876
Has dad eaten?
- No.

647
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:29,095
Since you left in the morning,
he's been locked up in his room.

648
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:30,944
He hasn't eaten.

649
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:32,352
Not even dinner?

650
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,475
You could have knocked on the door
and given him food.

651
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:39,492
So egoistic.

652
00:49:40,137 --> 00:49:41,428
He'll come around in the morning.

653
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:49,052
Have you given dad?

654
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:50,275
No.

655
00:49:51,397 --> 00:49:52,935
He usually comes down by 6.

656
00:49:53,028 --> 00:49:54,695
But he's not opened the door yet.

657
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,490
What?

658
00:49:57,482 --> 00:49:59,649
At this age... he worries me!

659
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:07,946
Dad.

660
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:10,708
Open up, dad.

661
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:12,666
I didn't say anything wrong.

662
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,780
Please open up.
We'll talk it out.

663
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:16,542
Open the door, dad.

664
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,351
Open the door or I'll enter
with the spare key.

665
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:21,377
Bring the spare key.

666
00:50:22,735 --> 00:50:23,569
Please, dad.

667
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,776
I'm sorry, okay?

668
00:50:26,205 --> 00:50:26,996
Open up.

669
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,492
Dad!

670
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,602
Dear...

671
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:56,600
Dear Raghavan...

672
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,585
You are a good son.
You have given me good things.

673
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:01,938
You gave me a room to stay,
and took good care of me.

674
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,318
You gave me two amazing grandchildren.

675
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,385
You gave me freedom.

676
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:08,377
I had everything,
but I felt like I was in a prison.

677
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:12,944
I was your father, you were my son.
But now you've become the father, and I, the son.

678
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,635
This change is natural.
It had to happen.

679
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:18,422
But beyond a point, I couldn't take it.

680
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,044
You're facing a lot of
trouble because of me.

681
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,961
I tried to change,
but I couldn't.

682
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,263
What will I do now?

683
00:51:25,088 --> 00:51:27,346
He can't even walk down the street
without picking a fight.

684
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:28,857
What's happened?

685
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:31,341
I don't know where he's gone,
what he's doing.

686
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:32,992
I'm scared.

687
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:35,885
Don't know if he has any money.

688
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,027
They'll fool him.

689
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,499
He's very innocent.

690
00:51:41,496 --> 00:51:43,538
Where has he gone?
What's he going through?

691
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:45,380
I don't wish to be a burden
to anyone.

692
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:50,811
In my last days, I want to fly freely
rather than live in your golden cage.

693
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:53,838
Don't try to look for me.
I will be happy.

694
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:56,708
My blessings to my dearest daughter Premalatha.

695
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:59,420
Kisses to my dearest babies
Dhruv and Sakshya.

696
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,549
Paandi.

697
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:13,491
You could ask his friends?

698
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,319
You're lying.

699
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,553
Grandpa hasn't gone out of town.

700
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:24,699
He ran away from home
because you yelled at him.

701
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,182
My friend's mom told me.

702
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:30,141
Grandpa really has gone...
- Don't lie, mom.

703
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,495
You told me one mustn't lie.

704
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:34,946
It's all your fault, dad.

705
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:36,675
Why did you scold grandpa?

706
00:52:38,149 --> 00:52:39,441
Isn't he your father?

707
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:40,924
Would you like it
if I scolded you?

708
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:48,217
Jobless oaf. It's Paandi here.

709
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,459
Master! Where the hell are you?

710
00:52:53,615 --> 00:52:55,109
I'm in some highway.

711
00:52:55,134 --> 00:52:57,509
You ran away from home?

712
00:52:57,662 --> 00:53:00,245
You do the things
people my age are supposed to do!

713
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:01,523
You come home drunk...

714
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:02,978
the cops come looking for you.

715
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:06,375
Did you go alone
or have you eloped with some chick?

716
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:08,365
I'll knock your teeth out.

717
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:10,136
I'm safe here.

718
00:53:10,163 --> 00:53:12,163
Don't tell anyone I called.

719
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:15,623
No one must know that
I'm in touch with you.

720
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:16,375
Okay?

721
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:19,556
I wish to hear my grandchildren's voice.

722
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:21,203
I'll stay on the line...

723
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:24,102
you go talk to my grandchildren.

724
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,504
Don't get me in trouble, man.

725
00:53:26,618 --> 00:53:28,480
You'll be fine.
Please do this.

726
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:30,390
I even got you beer.

727
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:31,823
Touche!

728
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:33,014
Fine, I'll do it.

729
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:34,097
Hey, Dhruv!

730
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:37,145
The two of us should go
and find grandpa?

731
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,672
Keep quiet!

732
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:40,394
What if we get lost?

733
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:41,816
We're kids.

734
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,332
Little ones! What are you upto?

735
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:45,574
Little devil looks suspicious...

736
00:53:45,675 --> 00:53:46,842
Look who's here.

737
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,417
So...

738
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:49,449
Where is your grandpa?

739
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:50,974
Our grandpa...

740
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:54,180
my grandpa has gone missing!

741
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,464
Don't talk to him.

742
00:53:56,594 --> 00:53:58,428
What did I do?

743
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:00,524
Anyway...

744
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:01,847
Why are you so upset?

745
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:03,577
You like your grandpa a lot?

746
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:08,209
I like my grandpa
even more than my parents.

747
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:09,640
Me too!

748
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,641
Not anymore, though.

749
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,585
He went away without telling us.

750
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,380
Don't feel sad.

751
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:17,363
Where will the old one go?
It will be back.

752
00:54:17,443 --> 00:54:20,699
Don't talk about our grandpa like that!
I'll knock your teeth out.

753
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:22,714
Get out of here.

754
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:24,331
Fine, don't beat me up.

755
00:54:24,356 --> 00:54:25,606
Calm down. I'm going.

756
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:31,230
Poor things.

757
00:54:31,347 --> 00:54:32,363
Just come back home.

758
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,553
I do miss my grandchildren, too!

759
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:37,795
I just needed some peace and exploration.

760
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,568
I'll just come back to my children
when I'm done.

761
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,593
You talk about peace...
exploration...

762
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:45,558
Where are you going?
Kaasi or Rameswaram?

763
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:47,600
Hang up, moron.

764
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:30,349
Have you placed a complaint?

765
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:31,932
They've taken down the details.

766
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:33,124
They'll find him?

767
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:34,600
That's what they say.

768
00:55:34,648 --> 00:55:37,606
He's withdrawn his twenty five lakhs.

769
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:41,534
With so much money,
how will he be safe?

770
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:09,755
Two chapathis.
- Okay.

771
00:56:10,645 --> 00:56:11,687
Hello, boss!

772
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,747
Eat with us?

773
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:14,978
Come.

774
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,814
You've run away from home?

775
00:56:21,814 --> 00:56:22,873
Yes, how did you know?

776
00:56:23,857 --> 00:56:25,607
Who did you think we are?

777
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:27,994
We've all run away from home, too.

778
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,094
So why did you run away from home?

779
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:35,389
I just didn't want to burden anyone
in my ripe old days.

780
00:56:35,455 --> 00:56:36,955
That's not a good reason.

781
00:56:37,332 --> 00:56:40,858
Gurumurthy, you ran away from home
because your daughter-in-law hit you.

782
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:42,592
This is a much better reason.

783
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:46,783
There should be a paper ad.

784
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:48,381
What ad?

785
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:51,131
How long since you left home?

786
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,866
About two days.

787
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:54,911
Peter, pass me the newspaper.

788
00:56:59,101 --> 00:57:00,809
Here.
'Missing Person'

789
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:04,173
See.

790
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:06,489
Oh no.

791
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,119
This photo is funny.

792
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:15,799
Remember your first 'Missing Person'
photo?

793
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:18,174
Your photo belonged in
'Obituaries'.

794
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:19,928
But that wasn't the worst.

795
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:23,897
Your son gave an ad
requesting you never to come back home.

796
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:26,733
Where are you going now?

797
00:57:27,104 --> 00:57:28,498
I'm just going where
the bike takes me.

798
00:57:28,523 --> 00:57:30,398
Come join with us, then.

799
00:57:31,392 --> 00:57:34,142
I want to do something meaningful.

800
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:36,533
Like...

801
00:57:37,107 --> 00:57:38,155
soul searching.

802
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,455
What's so meaningful to you?

803
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:43,622
Meaningful to me...

804
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,153
is my Poonthendral.

805
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,859
Who is this Poonthendral?

806
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,955
My first love.

807
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:52,477
You're going looking for her?

808
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:56,639
I didn't leave home to look for her.

809
00:57:56,926 --> 00:58:00,009
But now that you mention it,
I feel like I could go looking for her.

810
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:02,811
At sixty, why do you bother?

811
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:03,878
Guru...

812
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,436
we don't even know why we do it,
we're roaming aimlessly.

813
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,641
At least he's got a purpose.

814
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:12,616
Who is this first love?
Tell me about her. Let's pass some time.

815
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:14,787
It's nothing far-out.

816
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:16,132
Just the usual love story.

817
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:18,719
But those were the golden days
of my life.

818
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,426
My Poonthendral.

819
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,749
We must win this game, somehow.

820
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:32,541
If we defeat these Sillamarathupatti folks,
we'll be the kings of our town.

821
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,129
They're a tough team, man.

822
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:35,612
We need one solid player.

823
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:38,134
We'll do it.
- Where is Paandi? Why isn't he here?

824
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,251
A Bruce Lee film is releasing today.
The guy must have gone.

825
00:58:40,276 --> 00:58:42,765
When an action movie releases,
he'd even steal money to watch it somehow.

826
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:43,790
He'll be here.

827
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:46,458
Get started, man.
- Hold on. Paandi isn't here yet.

828
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:48,483
You want us to squat here
till he comes?

829
00:58:48,637 --> 00:58:50,054
Get started, man.

830
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:52,010
Is this our home-town, dad?

831
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:54,171
Oh, this is your first time!

832
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:55,755
Yes, dad.
- Take a good look. That's our town.

833
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,238
It's superb, dad.

834
00:58:57,263 --> 00:58:59,471
It's been five to six years
since you came here, Poonthendral?

835
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,532
Poongodi, come!
The car has arrived.

836
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:04,765
Oh, I'm coming.

837
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:07,900
Shoo, make way!
Every time a car comes...

838
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:10,258
Welcome, all! Welcome!
How are you?

839
00:59:11,183 --> 00:59:13,532
Thendral, what are you studying?

840
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:15,109
Bachelor of Arts, uncle.

841
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:17,914
She studies well.
So I thought I'd let her study...

842
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:18,856
That's fine.

843
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:20,045
You could have let me study, dad!

844
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:22,282
You were a terrible student, donkey.

845
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:25,002
Listen to me, just marry Paandi...

846
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:27,402
have his children,
and start a family.

847
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,271
How is the farming coming along?
- Good, good.

848
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:30,796
Don't let them in!

849
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:33,444
Kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi...

850
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,975
Losing to a guest team
in our hometown is so embarrassing.

851
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,375
Where is Paandi?

852
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:39,534
Don't be mad.
He'll be here.

853
00:59:39,601 --> 00:59:41,559
They'll finish us off before that.

854
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:43,419
Let's go to the garden tomorrow?

855
00:59:43,444 --> 00:59:46,485
There's the Karuppuswamy Temple sacrifice
tomorrow... we'll go day after.

856
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,334
What are we doing today?

857
00:59:48,395 --> 00:59:49,732
We'll eat and sleep.

858
00:59:49,775 --> 00:59:50,900
Or we can play dice.

859
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:52,773
That's no fun.

860
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:55,226
We used to play
all the time when we were kids.

861
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:59,512
What's that?
- They're playing kabaddi. Jobless boys.

862
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,891
They'll go to every town,
play kabaddi and pick fights.

863
01:00:03,207 --> 01:00:04,124
Let's go watch.

864
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:05,816
We'll be fine.

865
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:07,466
Who is that newbie?

866
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,296
This creature is here!

867
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,605
Poongodi, no work at home?

868
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,551
You've come here to watch
our macho sport?

869
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:19,328
Yeah, as if you're playing Jallikattu.
And you just tamed a bull!

870
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:20,428
Macho sport!

871
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:23,828
You've lost in a silly kabaddi game
and sitting out here.

872
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,565
Don't embarrass our hometown!

873
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,406
If we had that mouth,
we could have chased them away by talking.

874
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:32,346
Who is this girl?
Your family from the town?

875
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,484
Hi, I'm Poonthendral.
We're from Madurai.

876
01:00:34,533 --> 01:00:35,991
What's she saying?

877
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:37,488
Go play kabaddi.

878
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:39,494
Most of your men are out.

879
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:40,989
We're playing one man short.

880
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:42,083
Paandi is not here yet.

881
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:44,342
Once he's here,
we'll send them running.

882
01:00:44,367 --> 01:00:45,073
Sure.

883
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:46,848
Get going now.
- What a big-mouth!

884
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:50,290
What a name. "Poongodi".
- Buzz off, filthy-mouth!

885
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:51,315
Sweet fellow.

886
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:52,315
Who is this Paandi?

887
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:54,893
He's my cross cousin. I will marry him.
He'll be here.

888
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:59,084
There's one guy left.
You celebrate like you've won already.

889
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:01,193
The game's over, buddy.

890
01:01:01,812 --> 01:01:03,562
The game has just begun, sweetheart.

891
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:04,908
Who's that?

892
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:17,737
Paandi is here,
now watch the game!

893
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,903
Shall we begin?

894
01:02:09,903 --> 01:02:10,919
Did you see that?

895
01:02:33,594 --> 01:02:35,761
Have you come to play kabaddi
or piggie-back?

896
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:38,862
Oh, we sent them flying!

897
01:02:41,901 --> 01:02:43,437
They've shot a fight
inside a room with mirrors.

898
01:02:43,462 --> 01:02:44,914
Looks terrific!

899
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:47,320
He lifts his leg higher than palm trees!
- Fiance, you were great!

900
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:48,887
Superb, Fiance!

901
01:02:48,987 --> 01:02:51,265
I told you not to call me "fiance".
What are you doing here?

902
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,226
Just...

903
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,884
Who is this girl from town?
Related to you?

904
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:55,326
They've come from Madurai.

905
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:59,187
I noticed the Pleasure car
outside your house.

906
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:01,117
How are you related?
- My paternal uncle's daughter.

907
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:04,609
Then she's my cross cousin!

908
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:06,250
Be quiet!
No, she's not.

909
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,265
What's your name, Miss?
- Poonthendral.

910
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:09,634
You played great kabaddi.

911
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:12,078
"Poo-thendral". You're "Breeze of Blooms"?
Thanks.

912
01:03:12,103 --> 01:03:14,289
It's getting dark, Poongodi.
Don't be standing here.

913
01:03:14,314 --> 01:03:15,814
You'll scare the spirits away.

914
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:16,773
Come on!

915
01:03:16,817 --> 01:03:18,483
Why do you laugh?
- Sorry!

916
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,586
He likes me a lot.
So he keeps talking like that.

917
01:03:21,685 --> 01:03:24,633
We're sacrificing the goat
at Karuppusamy Temple! Be there.

918
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:25,741
Right!

919
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:57,053
What is it, Priest?
You're just standing there like the goat.

920
01:03:57,078 --> 01:03:58,158
Who are you looking for?

921
01:03:58,183 --> 01:04:01,141
I won't sacrifice the goat.
The usual guy, Rasappan, is not here.

922
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,178
Is there no one else?

923
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:04,620
He usually slays the goats
for our temple.

924
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:06,103
Paandi!
- Yes, Uncle?

925
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:08,385
Rasappan is not here today.

926
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,770
You must sacrifice the goat for us.

927
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:10,984
Sure, Uncle.
- Get the machete.

928
01:04:11,009 --> 01:04:12,259
Here!

929
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:14,692
Oh no!

930
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,055
What?
- You're scared of that?

931
01:04:16,238 --> 01:04:17,822
No, dad. That's a sin.
We should let it go.

932
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,751
Is the Miss a vegetarian?
- She loves to eat non-vegetarian!

933
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:23,523
Then? If you don't slaughter,
how will you eat?

934
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:25,892
It's a sin.
- Eating it is not a sin?

935
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:27,277
The sin of slaying,
washes away upon eating.

936
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:28,657
I'll be on the other side, then.

937
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:33,051
If you're happy, what do you care?
Don't listen.

938
01:04:33,406 --> 01:04:35,807
Look, Missy from Madurai
is sitting here alone.

939
01:04:35,832 --> 01:04:37,416
Let's go find out.

940
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:38,360
So, Miss...

941
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:41,908
You were clapping and cheering
for the kabaddi game. Why are you quiet now?

942
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:43,186
They're sacrificing a goat there.

943
01:04:43,243 --> 01:04:45,047
Then let's not go that way.
Let's go this way.

944
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:49,379
Want to watch a dirty movie
at the touring talkies?

945
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:53,129
Look... my mom, dad and uncle are right there.
Just walk away.

946
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:56,029
Let them be.
You and I should go, like a couple.

947
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:59,564
You kissed the ground at kabaddi
and now you're playing macho to a girl?

948
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:01,673
Paandi, you're on an ego trip?

949
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,584
Winning in kabaddi
doesn't make you a hero.

950
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:06,806
Go on now.
Play some chick sport.

951
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,860
You've got no spine.
You're talking about heroism to me?

952
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:11,661
There's no need for a fight!

953
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:13,278
It'll be fun, Miss.
Hold this.

954
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:16,255
I should have done you off sooner...

955
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:18,733
You're talkers.
I'm a doer.

956
01:05:27,061 --> 01:05:29,353
He broke my nose.
You're just watching?

957
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:50,852
One guy is hitting all our men.
Let's go.

958
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,059
Come on!

959
01:06:05,558 --> 01:06:06,617
What are you doing here?

960
01:06:06,642 --> 01:06:08,767
Someone might fall on you!
Go away.

961
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,851
It's alright. This is interesting.
I'll watch and go.

962
01:06:10,974 --> 01:06:12,414
Oh yeah?
Right!

963
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:13,773
Wretched woman!

964
01:06:14,114 --> 01:06:15,187
They look strong.

965
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:23,840
They're running just fine,
but not one of them touch Paandi.

966
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:41,953
Paandi, I was called to fight.
It was you?

967
01:06:41,978 --> 01:06:43,145
They called you?

968
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:47,023
You called a fellow townsman to hit me?
- I didn't!

969
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:48,766
Is it Marimuthu's son again?

970
01:06:48,813 --> 01:06:49,992
He does this all the time.

971
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:51,392
Show some respect.

972
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:52,859
The fight will be over soon.
You get going.

973
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,565
You want respect?

974
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:11,958
Why are you falling on me?
Hit him.

975
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:14,867
More than his blows,
the sounds he makes are scary!

976
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,311
Go on now.
You're a hero, alright.

977
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:21,192
Thank you!

978
01:07:22,613 --> 01:07:23,836
Oh we sent them flying!

979
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:25,714
You fight just like Bruce Lee.

980
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:26,878
Bruce Lee is my hero.

981
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,727
Don't sit alone out here.

982
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:32,398
Don't tell your relatives about the fight.
They'll get mad.

983
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:34,251
The meat gravy smells great.
Go eat!

984
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:38,084
Keep that.
Run along and go play now.

985
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:57,990
Rummy!

986
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,086
Triple and duplicate.
How's that?

987
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:02,687
You've got all the Jokers.
- Uncle.

988
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:06,492
The expense for the feast, the sacrifice,
priest's fee... father sent 750 rupees totally.

989
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:07,600
Okay, Paandi.

990
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:10,203
Paandi, come eat a mouthful?

991
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:12,303
No, auntie. I'm still full from
the afternoon meal.

992
01:08:12,328 --> 01:08:13,328
Fiance!

993
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,461
Come, let's play dice?

994
01:08:15,486 --> 01:08:17,234
I've told you many times,
don't call me "fiance".

995
01:08:17,329 --> 01:08:18,592
What's wrong in that?

996
01:08:18,617 --> 01:08:20,100
She's going to be your wife, someday.

997
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:22,958
Look, I'm not going to be your son-in-law
or her groom.

998
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:24,876
You just want to trap me!

999
01:08:25,486 --> 01:08:26,694
Where are you off to?

1000
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,724
Poonthendral wants to go out.

1001
01:08:28,749 --> 01:08:30,041
At this hour, where?

1002
01:08:30,066 --> 01:08:31,441
She means "out".

1003
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,459
Oh, right.
- Play your card, man.

1004
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:34,873
Let's go to the town tomorrow morning?

1005
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:37,569
How can we go alone
without our parents?

1006
01:08:37,632 --> 01:08:38,924
Where's the thrill in that?

1007
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:43,194
Thorn pick your feet?
- Yes.

1008
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,623
How can we go alone in the dark?
Ask him to come with us.

1009
01:08:45,648 --> 01:08:47,725
Good idea. Watch my romance now.

1010
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,709
Listen...

1011
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:53,014
We need to go. It's dark out there.
Come with us?

1012
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,848
Are you stupid?
You call a man to keep watch while you go?

1013
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,981
Call your mother.

1014
01:08:57,182 --> 01:08:58,803
Mother is busy.
- Then take your father.

1015
01:08:58,828 --> 01:08:59,983
Father is playing cards.

1016
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:01,495
They're all talking.

1017
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,013
It's enough if you wait
at the street end.

1018
01:09:04,038 --> 01:09:05,497
Just come!

1019
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,723
You fought like a movie hero
in the afternoon, huh?

1020
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:14,819
I told you not to tell anyone.

1021
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:16,177
You told this babble-mouth!

1022
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:17,459
I let it slip by accident.
Sorry.

1023
01:09:17,522 --> 01:09:19,561
So you'll keep a secret from me, Thendral?
- No way.

1024
01:09:19,586 --> 01:09:21,044
Yes. She will.
What about it?

1025
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:22,736
Fiance!

1026
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:24,225
Go on then.

1027
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,076
That's where women go.
I'll wait here.

1028
01:09:26,101 --> 01:09:27,476
Okay, let's go.

1029
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:31,088
Paandi, you get into trouble
because of your helpful nature.

1030
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:35,354
Paandi!

1031
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,748
I'm bored in the village.

1032
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:38,773
Take us to the town tomorrow?

1033
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,749
My dad will kill me.

1034
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,164
I'll talk to my parents.

1035
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,522
I must go to the dairy farm tomorrow.

1036
01:09:45,726 --> 01:09:46,936
I'll talk to father.

1037
01:09:46,961 --> 01:09:48,503
She wants you to come. Just come.

1038
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:52,512
I'll feel safe if we go with you.

1039
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:54,530
Let him be. I'll talk to dad.

1040
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:57,678
You don't want to come with me?

1041
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:01,717
I mean, you won't come
as my chaperone?

1042
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:02,973
If you don't want to,
it's fine.

1043
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,418
No, it's not like that.

1044
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:10,400
You want me to keep you safe...
how could I not come?

1045
01:10:10,425 --> 01:10:11,717
It's a snake!

1046
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,130
You're afraid of snakes?

1047
01:10:17,155 --> 01:10:18,613
Who is this guy?

1048
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:21,267
It's Sinnarasu!
I saw him just two days ago.

1049
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,083
Go on, boy.

1050
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:23,893
He's gone.

1051
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,581
What's up, buddy?

1052
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:06,072
You're wearing a new shirt?
And your hair is neatly combed!

1053
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:10,337
Oh, is it for the Madurai girl?

1054
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:11,708
Shut it.

1055
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:13,651
You have fine taste.

1056
01:11:13,872 --> 01:11:14,992
I said, shut it.

1057
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:17,518
They're here.

1058
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:20,525
Here comes your darling cousin.

1059
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,059
Why have you brought him?

1060
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:23,771
Who is this kid?

1061
01:11:23,857 --> 01:11:26,044
My little brother.
They said I have to take him along.

1062
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:27,147
Oh!

1063
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:29,688
My buddy will handle it.

1064
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,926
You must sit next to
Poongodi at the bus somehow.

1065
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:34,701
We'll go to the cinema!

1066
01:11:34,726 --> 01:11:36,446
I understand.

1067
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:39,247
How much longer for the bus to come?
- It'll be here.

1068
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,805
Sankarapuram stop.

1069
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,130
Let's go!

1070
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:14,044
Poonthendral, sit down!

1071
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:26,011
Thendral, let's buy puffed rice balls
at the market.

1072
01:12:26,061 --> 01:12:27,181
Those are great.

1073
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:30,061
You like it?

1074
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:33,669
I need to pee urgently, sister.

1075
01:13:33,795 --> 01:13:34,915
Oh god.

1076
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:36,909
How can I take you?
- But I need to, real bad!

1077
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,214
I warned you earlier!
- Hey, take him.

1078
01:13:39,274 --> 01:13:42,275
I can't watch your brother-in-law peeing
for your love.

1079
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,140
If you want to make an impression,
you take him.

1080
01:13:46,747 --> 01:13:47,787
Done?

1081
01:13:47,812 --> 01:13:48,932
Wait.

1082
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:53,938
Are you done?

1083
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,399
I can't pee under pressure!

1084
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,920
Let's go, boy.

1085
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:07,055
Do you pee in ten seconds?
Why do you rush me?

1086
01:14:07,178 --> 01:14:08,532
Needs to be nipped in the bud.

1087
01:14:08,613 --> 01:14:10,109
My sister is to blame.

1088
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:19,369
Sankarapuram!

1089
01:14:29,328 --> 01:14:31,877
I'm feeling sleepy, Thendral.
I'll get going.

1090
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:33,058
Goodbye!

1091
01:14:51,597 --> 01:14:52,357
I'll leave?

1092
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:09,901
Why are you standing outside?
Come under the umbrella!

1093
01:18:10,048 --> 01:18:12,848
Why are you standing inside?
Come out of the umbrella!

1094
01:18:20,137 --> 01:18:22,337
What is the point of life
if you don't get wet in the rain?

1095
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:24,847
I love you.

1096
01:18:42,506 --> 01:18:43,866
I love you, too.

1097
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:08,254
Where are you going?

1098
01:19:08,312 --> 01:19:09,992
Just the temple...

1099
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:13,726
We're going back home tomorrow.
Pack your stuff.

1100
01:19:18,146 --> 01:19:21,266
I thought we had another ten days...
- Some urgent work has come up.

1101
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:27,146
I need to go to the temple, dad...

1102
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:29,251
No need. Go inside.

1103
01:19:29,379 --> 01:19:31,499
Go pack the clothes,
okay?

1104
01:19:51,564 --> 01:19:53,164
Thendral, where are you going?

1105
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,449
What's your plan, Poongodi?

1106
01:19:56,474 --> 01:19:57,707
What could I do?

1107
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,603
I'm not educated.
I must stay at home only.

1108
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,165
When do you plan to get married?

1109
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,190
How would I know?
My parents must decide.

1110
01:20:03,474 --> 01:20:06,314
Gold prices are rising...
- So is my age!

1111
01:20:06,459 --> 01:20:08,296
Just marry your cousin Paandi, then.

1112
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:10,521
I wish to.
But how could I tell my father that?

1113
01:20:10,546 --> 01:20:11,890
I'll talk to your father.

1114
01:20:11,915 --> 01:20:14,395
But Paandi is not showing interest at all.

1115
01:20:14,704 --> 01:20:17,144
It just needs to be dealt with
the right way.

1116
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,893
Let me handle it!

1117
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,410
Poongodi!

1118
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:35,659
What are you doing here
at this hour?

1119
01:20:36,315 --> 01:20:37,995
Just dropped by...

1120
01:20:39,111 --> 01:20:42,146
Haven't seen you... or your relatives
coming out of the house today?

1121
01:20:42,563 --> 01:20:43,687
Oh, that!

1122
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:47,345
Poonthendral, Uncle, Aunt... they're all
going back tomorrow.

1123
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:49,419
They were talking about that.

1124
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:58,467
But...

1125
01:20:58,492 --> 01:21:00,399
she said they'll be here for
two more weeks.

1126
01:21:00,424 --> 01:21:03,264
Who said that?
- No, I heard you talking about it.

1127
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:04,958
I don't know why.

1128
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,713
Uncle suddenly said they must leave.

1129
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:08,823
Thendral has been crying since noon.

1130
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:11,389
He won't let her go out.

1131
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,212
I think there's some trouble.

1132
01:21:17,598 --> 01:21:18,518
Fiance...

1133
01:21:19,572 --> 01:21:21,452
Come in and eat something?

1134
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,120
No... I'm fine.

1135
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:38,751
Put this in the back.

1136
01:21:38,776 --> 01:21:41,616
You said you'll stay for two weeks!
Can't believe you're already leaving.

1137
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:14,351
Be safe.

1138
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:15,718
I need to pee, mum.

1139
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,004
Just when we're about to leave.
Go now! Quick.

1140
01:22:18,221 --> 01:22:21,141
He always does this.
- He's just a child.

1141
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:24,745
You must visit us at Madurai.
- Have you packed all the snacks?

1142
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:25,590
Yes!

1143
01:22:25,658 --> 01:22:27,898
Paandi, we're leaving town.

1144
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:29,875
Okay, kiddo.

1145
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,350
Don't forget me!

1146
01:22:32,408 --> 01:22:34,928
My sister asked me to give you this.

1147
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:42,872
Okay.

1148
01:22:42,962 --> 01:22:45,242
My mom will worry.
I must go.

1149
01:22:53,504 --> 01:22:54,904
Goodbye.

1150
01:23:02,786 --> 01:23:05,506
Paandi, my father suddenly
said we're leaving.

1151
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,066
They didn't let me out of the house.

1152
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:09,095
I don't know how I'll live without you.

1153
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:13,184
In all my eighteen years,
these past two days have been my happiest.

1154
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:14,593
Don't forget me.

1155
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,570
I'll finish my studies in two years.

1156
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,190
We can get married then.

1157
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,010
Or I will come with you.

1158
01:23:20,123 --> 01:23:21,603
Please visit me in Madurai.

1159
01:23:21,628 --> 01:23:24,508
I wish to see you one last time
before I leave.

1160
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:26,429
Please come to see me.
Somehow.

1161
01:23:26,693 --> 01:23:28,253
I love you so much.

1162
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:29,758
I feel like I'm dying.

1163
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:32,742
I've written my address at the back
of this letter. Write to me.

1164
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:35,647
Don't forget me.
Love, Poonthendral.

1165
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:13,575
I haven't seen Poonthendral since.

1166
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:15,841
I wrote many letters,
I didn't get a reply.

1167
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,478
Life took strange turns.
I married the woman God gave me.

1168
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,067
She died a few years ago.

1169
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,920
Mr. Power, no one marries
the woman they love.

1170
01:24:27,087 --> 01:24:30,087
We all end up marrying the woman
that God wishes upon us.

1171
01:24:31,495 --> 01:24:34,895
Whether it's the woman we loved,
or the woman God gave us, it's all the same.

1172
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:36,146
So...

1173
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:37,574
You're going to meet her now?

1174
01:24:38,582 --> 01:24:39,822
Where will you find her now?

1175
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:42,290
I think I'll find her in Madurai.

1176
01:24:44,956 --> 01:24:45,956
Why do you laugh?

1177
01:24:46,023 --> 01:24:47,805
Which century are you living in?

1178
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,830
Haven't you heard of Facebook?

1179
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,643
Mr. Power, tell me your Poonthendral's
father's name.

1180
01:24:53,751 --> 01:24:57,071
In two minutes, we can find out
where she is.

1181
01:24:58,132 --> 01:25:00,212
Chandrasekar.
Poonthendral Chandrasekar.

1182
01:25:00,593 --> 01:25:01,753
One minute.

1183
01:25:02,832 --> 01:25:04,871
Here she is!
Your Poonthendral.

1184
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:06,249
Is this her?

1185
01:25:06,274 --> 01:25:07,634
She lives in Hyderabad.

1186
01:25:21,113 --> 01:25:22,801
She has a grand-daughter.

1187
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,960
Cute!
- Status says single.

1188
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:28,051
Looks like she doesn't have a husband.
- That must be her daughter.

1189
01:25:29,915 --> 01:25:31,601
Can I go there and meet her?

1190
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,546
No, no.

1191
01:25:32,658 --> 01:25:35,778
You can't just turn up
like that, Mr. Power.

1192
01:25:35,996 --> 01:25:37,879
You send her a message.

1193
01:25:37,938 --> 01:25:39,338
Ask her if she'd like to meet.

1194
01:25:39,484 --> 01:25:41,284
If she says okay, go there.

1195
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:43,710
You don't know what her life is like now.
- True!

1196
01:25:43,735 --> 01:25:45,895
We can't disturb that.

1197
01:25:45,955 --> 01:25:48,902
I don't have a phone now.
I must buy one at the town.

1198
01:25:48,927 --> 01:25:50,848
No problem. Use this.

1199
01:25:50,873 --> 01:25:51,899
What about you?

1200
01:25:51,924 --> 01:25:54,884
Let it go.
This phone is such a pain.

1201
01:25:55,705 --> 01:25:59,016
First, we must create an account for you
on Facebook.

1202
01:25:59,256 --> 01:26:00,736
Then send her a friend request.

1203
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,304
She needs to accept it.

1204
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:05,074
Then you can message her.

1205
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:05,883
Oh!

1206
01:26:06,596 --> 01:26:09,356
Tell me your full name.
- Paandiyan Pazhanisami.

1207
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:12,986
Age?
- Sixty four.

1208
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:14,584
Relationship status?

1209
01:26:14,664 --> 01:26:15,584
I am single.

1210
01:26:19,034 --> 01:26:20,557
You're funny!

1211
01:26:20,582 --> 01:26:23,717
We need a display picture.

1212
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:25,834
Strike a nice smiley pose.

1213
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:30,719
Check this out.

1214
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:33,163
This is not good.

1215
01:26:33,236 --> 01:26:34,916
Ready?
- Yes.

1216
01:26:44,103 --> 01:26:45,063
Look at this.

1217
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:47,176
You're killing it!

1218
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,214
All the best!
- Bye!

1219
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:54,291
My father, the stunt master
'Power' Paandi...

1220
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,596
I enquired. But no information.

1221
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:57,901
Did you enquire?

1222
01:28:21,222 --> 01:28:22,462
Is your father home?

1223
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:24,625
My father has been missing for two days.
I need to talk about it.

1224
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:27,317
My dad's been acting too cocky
for two days now.

1225
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:28,465
Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:28:28,669 --> 01:28:30,641
So, your dad's gone missing?

1227
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:32,666
Yes.
- Did you care for him when he was here?

1228
01:28:32,758 --> 01:28:35,118
Now you're searching for him.

1229
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,103
Continue.

1230
01:28:36,128 --> 01:28:38,553
I'll escape like this someday.

1231
01:28:38,578 --> 01:28:40,498
Then you'll know my value.

1232
01:28:40,598 --> 01:28:44,945
You think older people just sit at home
and watch TV shows...

1233
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:46,720
drop your kids at school

1234
01:28:46,745 --> 01:28:50,425
and be watchmen to your house
when you're going out?

1235
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,130
You should have thought about this before.

1236
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:13,574
Oh my god. You're still alive?

1237
01:29:15,326 --> 01:29:16,446
Luckily, I am.

1238
01:29:16,714 --> 01:29:18,394
I'm coming to Hyderabad on work.

1239
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:20,169
Thought I could come and meet you.

1240
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:25,331
I would love to.
Please let me know when you're free.

1241
01:29:25,887 --> 01:29:28,327
Tomorrow at five.
Anywhere you want to meet.

1242
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:31,676
I'll text you the place in a bit.

1243
01:29:50,836 --> 01:29:51,824
Hello? Who is this?

1244
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:52,900
Paandi.

1245
01:29:53,462 --> 01:29:54,582
'Power' Paandi.

1246
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:56,632
Master, you've got a new phone number?

1247
01:29:56,898 --> 01:29:57,722
Where are you?

1248
01:29:57,788 --> 01:29:59,988
I'm in Hyderabad.
Don't tell anyone.

1249
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:02,346
I won't...
what are you doing there?

1250
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,260
Remember I'd mentioned about my first love?

1251
01:30:07,982 --> 01:30:09,182
I've come to meet her.

1252
01:30:09,207 --> 01:30:11,447
You're just living the life!

1253
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,105
A new chapter of romance in your life?

1254
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:15,170
It's not romance or anything!

1255
01:30:15,195 --> 01:30:17,075
I just came to meet her.

1256
01:30:17,128 --> 01:30:18,331
I'm meeting her at 5pm tomorrow.

1257
01:30:18,393 --> 01:30:20,073
Awesome stuff.

1258
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:22,183
Dress sharp,
and go with a confident swag.

1259
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,191
Don't turn up with that long face of yours.

1260
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:26,839
What's wrong with my face?

1261
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:29,883
Go look in the mirror!

1262
01:30:34,026 --> 01:30:35,546
I'm handsome, alright!

1263
01:30:49,038 --> 01:30:51,438
The clock isn't ticking at all!

1264
01:31:22,772 --> 01:31:23,532
Yes!

1265
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:25,401
You don't have a single grey hair!

1266
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,297
We meet after all these years...

1267
01:32:28,602 --> 01:32:30,362
and this is the first thing you ask me?

1268
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:32,750
You've never heard of hair dyes?

1269
01:32:33,151 --> 01:32:35,071
But salt-and-pepper is the in-thing!

1270
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:38,494
Well... there is salt alright...

1271
01:32:38,691 --> 01:32:40,795
But I don't see any pepper.

1272
01:32:44,123 --> 01:32:46,643
You had a straight, full nose.
What happened?

1273
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,702
I don't work on a computer.
I'm a fighter!

1274
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:52,671
I had a fall during a stunt,
and it just splattered away.

1275
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:56,904
How is everyone at home?

1276
01:32:57,539 --> 01:32:58,659
All good.

1277
01:32:59,821 --> 01:33:01,661
Now, my life revolves around
my granddaughter.

1278
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:03,463
You?
- I have two!

1279
01:33:03,488 --> 01:33:05,048
A grandson, and a granddaughter.

1280
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,010
You have two grandchildren?

1281
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:09,953
I can hardly believe it.

1282
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,757
Oh.. how is Kannan?

1283
01:33:14,852 --> 01:33:16,432
Doing really well.

1284
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:17,419
He's in Dubai.
- Oh!

1285
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,840
Want to see?
- Show me.

1286
01:33:25,374 --> 01:33:26,854
Is this Kannan?

1287
01:33:27,275 --> 01:33:28,675
He's changed so much.

1288
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:32,001
What did you expect?
That he'd remain a kid forever?

1289
01:33:33,382 --> 01:33:34,542
How is Mani?

1290
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,127
He got married to Poongodi
and settled down at Sankarapuram.

1291
01:33:37,207 --> 01:33:38,662
He's a farmer now.

1292
01:33:38,725 --> 01:33:40,047
Really?

1293
01:33:40,284 --> 01:33:43,364
I heard that you've become
a cinema stuntmaster.

1294
01:33:44,511 --> 01:33:45,911
I think about you at times.

1295
01:33:47,675 --> 01:33:50,755
I looked up on Facebook and Twitter,
but I never found you.

1296
01:33:51,645 --> 01:33:54,285
Why didn't you reply to any of my letters?

1297
01:33:57,570 --> 01:33:59,290
Dad spotted us at the village.

1298
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:01,115
He locked me away carefully.

1299
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:04,488
When your letters came,
he tore and threw them away.

1300
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:06,026
I couldn't do a thing.

1301
01:34:06,776 --> 01:34:08,656
I cried a lot and went mad.

1302
01:34:13,892 --> 01:34:15,652
117 letters in total.

1303
01:34:17,766 --> 01:34:18,726
So...

1304
01:34:18,871 --> 01:34:20,502
Why didn't you come to find me?

1305
01:34:20,562 --> 01:34:21,762
I did.

1306
01:34:22,203 --> 01:34:24,083
I ran away from my home to see you.

1307
01:34:25,002 --> 01:34:26,762
I went to the address you gave me.

1308
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:28,707
They told me you've shifted town.

1309
01:34:30,269 --> 01:34:33,509
I couldn't see you,
nor could I go back home.

1310
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:36,181
I came to Chennai with a relative.

1311
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,421
Then I became a fighter...
and then a master.

1312
01:34:38,446 --> 01:34:39,686
Life took its own course.

1313
01:34:43,616 --> 01:34:44,576
So...

1314
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:47,450
It turned out to be a good thing
that dad tore all those letters.

1315
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:51,737
Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone to Madurai
looking for me.

1316
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:56,439
You wouldn't have gone from there to Chennai,
or become a great stuntmaster in cinema.

1317
01:34:57,046 --> 01:34:58,046
Right?

1318
01:34:58,836 --> 01:34:59,836
Anyway...

1319
01:35:00,604 --> 01:35:02,684
Why did you come to Hyderabad?
A film shoot?

1320
01:35:09,031 --> 01:35:10,118
I came to see you.

1321
01:35:18,498 --> 01:35:19,498
Well...

1322
01:35:22,027 --> 01:35:23,987
Okay...
let's go for a walk.

1323
01:36:58,926 --> 01:37:00,345
How did you come?
- On my bike.

1324
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:01,936
You?
- By car.

1325
01:37:01,967 --> 01:37:03,447
Shall I follow your car?

1326
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:06,366
Let's go by bike.

1327
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,850
We could do that!

1328
01:38:38,206 --> 01:38:39,848
Why are you standing out there?
Come under the umbrella.

1329
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,762
Why are you standing inside?
Come out of the umbrella!

1330
01:38:41,787 --> 01:38:43,987
What's a life where you don't
get wet in the rain?

1331
01:39:19,772 --> 01:39:20,610
Shall we go?
- Yes!

1332
01:39:20,635 --> 01:39:23,826
Since we got drenched in the rain,
when you go home--

1333
01:39:24,128 --> 01:39:24,781
Careful.

1334
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,780
Sorry!

1335
01:39:25,916 --> 01:39:27,567
You old hag! Are you blind?
- What?

1336
01:39:27,592 --> 01:39:29,752
Son, she apologized right?

1337
01:39:29,973 --> 01:39:31,613
Is this the way you talk to a woman?

1338
01:39:31,638 --> 01:39:32,506
It was your fault, too.

1339
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,711
As if she's some hot chick,
and I deliberately bumped into her!

1340
01:39:34,736 --> 01:39:35,776
Son!

1341
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:37,330
Talk with respect.

1342
01:39:37,522 --> 01:39:39,562
Apologize to her and leave.
- Or what?

1343
01:39:41,518 --> 01:39:43,718
Son, I'm telling you for your good...

1344
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,796
Just apologize and get going.
Okay?

1345
01:39:45,839 --> 01:39:47,639
I won't!
What now?

1346
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:50,117
Son...

1347
01:39:51,038 --> 01:39:53,739
Do you know a good orthopaedist?

1348
01:40:01,373 --> 01:40:03,013
What just happened?!

1349
01:40:03,273 --> 01:40:04,451
God!

1350
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,324
Son...
I gave you a fair warning!

1351
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:08,774
Are you okay?

1352
01:40:08,799 --> 01:40:09,919
I can't hear anything!

1353
01:40:09,944 --> 01:40:12,944
He'll remain like this for a while,
we'll talk to him later.

1354
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:14,870
You go stand there.

1355
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:16,467
Okay.

1356
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:18,018
Just go easy on him. Okay?

1357
01:40:18,077 --> 01:40:18,836
Okay!

1358
01:40:19,365 --> 01:40:20,725
Call up Satish for backup!

1359
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:35,949
We treat women like Goddesses
in our country.

1360
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:37,568
That's not the way to talk.

1361
01:41:37,753 --> 01:41:38,273
Go...

1362
01:41:41,973 --> 01:41:43,613
Oh, we sent them flying!

1363
01:41:59,769 --> 01:42:01,023
What happened?

1364
01:42:01,953 --> 01:42:02,838
What is it?

1365
01:42:02,863 --> 01:42:05,383
What...
What's happening to you?

1366
01:42:06,317 --> 01:42:07,877
My... my medicines!

1367
01:42:08,615 --> 01:42:09,415
Listen...

1368
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,400
Please don't end up dying here.

1369
01:42:12,696 --> 01:42:13,896
Pharmacy...
- What?

1370
01:42:13,971 --> 01:42:15,651
Need to go to the pharmacy.

1371
01:42:18,975 --> 01:42:19,648
Hello?

1372
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:21,950
Mom, I'm at work.
I'll call you back.

1373
01:42:23,622 --> 01:42:25,902
When your parents call,
talk to them!

1374
01:42:25,982 --> 01:42:27,102
It's just my mom!

1375
01:42:27,256 --> 01:42:31,176
I was careless like you,
and I've ended up losing my dad.

1376
01:42:31,556 --> 01:42:33,156
They don't expect much.

1377
01:42:33,181 --> 01:42:36,105
Just a few kind words, have you eaten,
did you sleep?

1378
01:42:36,339 --> 01:42:37,859
It won't make you any less of a man.

1379
01:42:39,055 --> 01:42:40,206
I'm sorry.

1380
01:42:57,341 --> 01:42:59,781
Dear...
- I should have taken better care of him.

1381
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:01,491
He was here with me.

1382
01:43:01,834 --> 01:43:03,256
I lost him.

1383
01:43:05,628 --> 01:43:08,788
Even though he was a fighter,
he's never laid a finger on me.

1384
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:10,541
He took good care of me.

1385
01:43:11,093 --> 01:43:13,933
Even when I was in a foul mood,
he always used to smile at me.

1386
01:43:15,096 --> 01:43:17,538
After mom died,
he was a companion to me.

1387
01:43:17,652 --> 01:43:19,391
After we got married,
he was our companion.

1388
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:21,246
Then he kept our kids company.

1389
01:43:21,475 --> 01:43:22,555
But, we...

1390
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:25,539
we left him all alone in this house.

1391
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:31,481
If I ever find him again,
I'll guard him like a precious treasure.

1392
01:43:32,927 --> 01:43:33,691
Come on!

1393
01:43:39,487 --> 01:43:40,607
Please...

1394
01:43:40,934 --> 01:43:42,334
Tell us if you know something.

1395
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:44,089
Even a small clue would help.

1396
01:43:44,317 --> 01:43:46,997
I don't know anything.
He hasn't spoken to me.

1397
01:43:47,236 --> 01:43:49,836
My kids are refusing to eat
without their grandfather.

1398
01:43:50,831 --> 01:43:52,151
The house looks dead.

1399
01:43:52,357 --> 01:43:53,837
If you know something,
out with it.

1400
01:43:53,884 --> 01:43:55,684
They've filed a police complaint.

1401
01:43:55,888 --> 01:43:58,514
If I come to know
that you did know something...

1402
01:43:58,578 --> 01:43:59,818
I'll kill you!

1403
01:43:59,908 --> 01:44:02,468
I'm telling you I don't know anything.

1404
01:44:10,617 --> 01:44:12,654
You just had your medicines
and recovered now.

1405
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:14,250
You already want a cake?

1406
01:44:14,655 --> 01:44:15,855
I love cake!

1407
01:44:17,178 --> 01:44:18,898
You look fit, alright...

1408
01:44:19,046 --> 01:44:20,086
but...

1409
01:44:20,646 --> 01:44:22,491
you're also getting old,
Mr. Power Paandi.

1410
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,540
Getting old? Me?
- Yes!

1411
01:44:24,702 --> 01:44:27,502
No young man can take me on,
one-on-one.

1412
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,020
Power Paandi.

1413
01:44:29,045 --> 01:44:30,245
Braveheart!

1414
01:44:30,486 --> 01:44:31,646
That's right!

1415
01:44:32,068 --> 01:44:35,086
What's with the name?
'Power' Paandi?

1416
01:44:35,146 --> 01:44:38,786
All stunt masters in cinema need to have
an attractive prefix to their names.

1417
01:44:38,996 --> 01:44:40,476
Otherwise we won't have an identity!

1418
01:44:45,887 --> 01:44:47,447
I'm happy you came to see me.

1419
01:44:47,564 --> 01:44:48,691
I'm happy I came.

1420
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:51,305
Look at that!
You speak English really well.

1421
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:53,094
My grandchildren taught me.

1422
01:44:57,992 --> 01:44:58,862
Hello?
- Yes, dear.

1423
01:44:58,895 --> 01:45:00,992
Where are you, mom?
When are you getting back?

1424
01:45:01,017 --> 01:45:02,657
I'll be back in half an hour.

1425
01:45:02,904 --> 01:45:04,494
What is Thendral doing?
- She's sleeping.

1426
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:05,602
Get back before she wakes up.

1427
01:45:06,192 --> 01:45:07,672
Okay. Bye.

1428
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,680
Thendral?

1429
01:45:09,964 --> 01:45:11,284
My granddaughter.

1430
01:45:11,414 --> 01:45:14,355
My daughter loves me so much,
she named her daughter after me.

1431
01:45:17,248 --> 01:45:18,928
I have a grandson too...

1432
01:45:19,328 --> 01:45:21,157
My son never thought about
naming him after me.

1433
01:45:22,193 --> 01:45:23,473
But he's a good man.

1434
01:45:23,498 --> 01:45:25,138
He's very responsible.

1435
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,720
But I think he isn't very sentimental!

1436
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,820
What's your grandson's name?
- Threw!

1437
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:33,198
What?
- Threw.

1438
01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:34,399
Threw?

1439
01:45:34,815 --> 01:45:35,975
Threw!
- Oh, Dhruv!

1440
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,120
What did I just say?

1441
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,440
Okay, I'll get going.

1442
01:45:42,465 --> 01:45:43,705
Keep in touch.

1443
01:45:51,758 --> 01:45:54,078
Hey... that looks like grandpa.

1444
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:56,156
That is grandpa!

1445
01:45:57,474 --> 01:45:58,706
He's in Hyderabad?

1446
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:01,211
Dad!
I've found where grandpa is.

1447
01:46:01,849 --> 01:46:02,891
What are you doing?

1448
01:46:05,981 --> 01:46:07,536
I was thinking about you.

1449
01:46:07,591 --> 01:46:08,591
You?

1450
01:46:09,714 --> 01:46:11,755
I messaged you because
I was thinking about you!

1451
01:46:13,132 --> 01:46:14,632
What were you thinking about me?

1452
01:46:16,066 --> 01:46:17,274
Everything.

1453
01:46:17,488 --> 01:46:19,904
From the start,
to the present.

1454
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:21,883
You?
- I was thinking what next.

1455
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:25,028
What next after this, Paandi?
I'm sure you know.

1456
01:46:25,542 --> 01:46:26,667
I don't know.

1457
01:46:46,348 --> 01:46:48,473
Do I still have a place
in your heart?

1458
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:29,148
What?

1459
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:32,570
Why didn't you reply?

1460
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:35,208
I asked you a very
important question.

1461
01:47:36,435 --> 01:47:37,348
God!

1462
01:47:37,613 --> 01:47:39,239
My daughter and granddaughter
are sleeping inside.

1463
01:47:39,403 --> 01:47:40,739
Are they doing well?

1464
01:47:44,653 --> 01:47:45,944
Go to the terrace.

1465
01:47:45,991 --> 01:47:47,491
Just go to the terrace,
I'll be there.

1466
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:56,614
'My heart,
oh it's filled with such colours'

1467
01:47:57,098 --> 01:48:03,056
'My eyes,
brimming with happy tears'

1468
01:48:03,081 --> 01:48:05,081
'Until I saw you-

1469
01:48:05,106 --> 01:48:06,332
Why did you come here now?

1470
01:48:06,457 --> 01:48:09,707
I asked you a very important question.
Why didn't you reply?

1471
01:48:12,145 --> 01:48:13,936
I shouldn't have given you my address!

1472
01:48:14,211 --> 01:48:16,211
Just answer my question.

1473
01:48:17,129 --> 01:48:19,004
Paandi, we have our
own families.

1474
01:48:19,524 --> 01:48:21,691
We have children...
and grandchildren.

1475
01:48:21,816 --> 01:48:23,191
What kind of talk is this?

1476
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:25,754
All of them have their own lives.

1477
01:48:25,779 --> 01:48:27,691
We need a life for ourselves, right?

1478
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,631
They are our whole life.

1479
01:48:33,598 --> 01:48:35,431
But... are we theirs?

1480
01:48:37,899 --> 01:48:38,982
Answer me.

1481
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:42,006
Are we their whole life?

1482
01:48:44,436 --> 01:48:45,686
This isn't important now.

1483
01:48:46,615 --> 01:48:47,990
This is important, too.

1484
01:48:48,407 --> 01:48:49,907
In fact,
this is the most important thing.

1485
01:48:50,494 --> 01:48:52,369
Paandi, what are you trying to say?

1486
01:48:53,579 --> 01:48:54,746
Nothing.

1487
01:48:55,641 --> 01:48:57,391
Whatever it is,
ask me straight.

1488
01:48:58,723 --> 01:48:59,676
I'm scared...

1489
01:48:59,704 --> 01:49:00,912
Then don't ask me.

1490
01:49:03,748 --> 01:49:05,415
Do I still...

1491
01:49:05,728 --> 01:49:07,270
have a place...

1492
01:49:08,193 --> 01:49:09,527
in your heart?

1493
01:49:25,073 --> 01:49:26,934
Answer me. Do I?

1494
01:49:26,959 --> 01:49:28,084
You fool!

1495
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:30,434
You always were in my heart,
and you will be!

1496
01:49:30,459 --> 01:49:31,959
Is that enough?

1497
01:49:32,543 --> 01:49:33,835
Stop smiling.

1498
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:37,152
What should I do now?

1499
01:49:40,106 --> 01:49:42,148
A future for us...

1500
01:49:45,002 --> 01:49:46,210
Paandi...

1501
01:49:48,035 --> 01:49:49,160
Turn around.

1502
01:49:55,684 --> 01:49:57,768
Come home tomorrow for lunch.

1503
01:49:57,854 --> 01:49:58,937
What for?

1504
01:49:59,128 --> 01:50:01,419
Meet my daughter,
and my granddaughter.

1505
01:50:02,241 --> 01:50:03,949
See what my life is like.

1506
01:50:04,171 --> 01:50:05,796
After that,
we'll talk it out.

1507
01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:09,098
Okay.

1508
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:10,979
I should go now.

1509
01:50:11,664 --> 01:50:13,206
My granddaughter
might wake up.

1510
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,755
Will you ride back safe?

1511
01:50:20,843 --> 01:50:22,218
I don't want to talk to you!

1512
01:50:22,329 --> 01:50:24,162
Fine!
Then get going.

1513
01:50:24,187 --> 01:50:26,324
Back in Sankarapuram,
I never knew you were such a big-mouth.

1514
01:50:26,349 --> 01:50:27,637
Your dad took you away!

1515
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:28,871
Get lost, old man!

1516
01:50:32,778 --> 01:50:34,362
Were you in love with him?

1517
01:50:34,596 --> 01:50:35,596
I was.

1518
01:50:35,683 --> 01:50:36,891
He's confused me now!

1519
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:38,038
And him?

1520
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,952
He was in love, too.

1521
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:43,324
Then I think you guys should hook up!

1522
01:50:44,296 --> 01:50:45,504
What are you blabbering?

1523
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:46,832
What's wrong in that, mom?

1524
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:48,629
You're single,
he's single too.

1525
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:50,565
You were in love--
- Hey, wait!

1526
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:52,434
It's not like we were in love yesterday.

1527
01:50:52,507 --> 01:50:55,132
It was my first love,
several ages ago!

1528
01:50:55,554 --> 01:50:57,403
Finding your first love
is the toughest!

1529
01:50:57,451 --> 01:50:59,762
You're going to live for
just another ten or twenty years...

1530
01:50:59,895 --> 01:51:02,598
You can live out the rest of your life in peace,
happily, with each other.

1531
01:51:02,623 --> 01:51:05,489
I wasn't fortunate enough
to make it work with my first love!

1532
01:51:05,514 --> 01:51:07,139
That wretch!

1533
01:51:08,821 --> 01:51:11,029
But people will talk!
- What people?

1534
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,818
People from Chennai, or Hyderabad?

1535
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,826
You're some Sridevi,
and he's Kamal Hassan!

1536
01:51:14,873 --> 01:51:18,832
The papers are going to write
about your love story, huh? Come on, mom!

1537
01:51:19,258 --> 01:51:21,466
I'm in my sixties.
This is absurd!

1538
01:51:21,898 --> 01:51:23,356
So what?

1539
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:26,928
If a woman loses her husband
in her twenties...

1540
01:51:26,984 --> 01:51:30,139
it is acceptable for her to remarry
or find a companion.

1541
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:33,029
But when she's in her sixties,
it's wrong?

1542
01:51:34,857 --> 01:51:37,816
Irrespective of the ages,
companionship is companionship!

1543
01:51:40,748 --> 01:51:43,290
You're blushing crimson!
Go to bed now.

1544
01:51:43,391 --> 01:51:46,412
They're coming to ask your hand in marriage tomorrow!
- Oh shut it!

1545
01:51:46,437 --> 01:51:47,729
Buzz off.

1546
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,584
Don't overthink it.

1547
01:51:49,655 --> 01:51:52,405
In a week's time,
my husband will take me with him.

1548
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:54,200
Then you'll be on your own.

1549
01:51:54,305 --> 01:51:55,513
You don't have to!

1550
01:52:22,315 --> 01:52:25,190
Have you ever shown this level of interest
when cooking for me?

1551
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:30,359
You should watch Paandi eating meat.
It's a beautiful sight!

1552
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:04,052
Forgive me, dad.

1553
01:53:04,542 --> 01:53:05,958
I've made a mistake.

1554
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:08,797
Please come home, dad.

1555
01:53:10,037 --> 01:53:12,579
Live as you please.
I won't say a word.

1556
01:53:13,062 --> 01:53:14,562
I'll change myself, dad.

1557
01:53:15,438 --> 01:53:16,521
Please, dad.

1558
01:53:16,579 --> 01:53:18,371
Please come home.

1559
01:53:19,497 --> 01:53:21,581
I'll listen to everything you say.

1560
01:53:25,334 --> 01:53:27,168
Without you,
it doesn't feel like home at all.

1561
01:53:28,157 --> 01:53:29,699
You were the reason it felt like home.

1562
01:53:29,956 --> 01:53:31,081
Please, dad.

1563
01:53:31,743 --> 01:53:33,035
Come home with us.

1564
01:53:33,295 --> 01:53:34,379
Let's go.

1565
01:53:34,496 --> 01:53:36,664
You run away from home,
and upload photos on Facebook?

1566
01:53:36,689 --> 01:53:38,156
Well... it was...

1567
01:53:38,181 --> 01:53:39,639
I put up that photo.

1568
01:53:40,505 --> 01:53:41,547
Sorry.

1569
01:53:42,255 --> 01:53:44,922
Sorry...
boy, I'm sorry!

1570
01:54:04,992 --> 01:54:06,450
Both of you...
get in the car.

1571
01:54:13,193 --> 01:54:14,485
We'll wait in the car.

1572
01:54:17,411 --> 01:54:20,077
Where are my toys, mom?
- Look around, it's right there.

1573
01:54:23,316 --> 01:54:25,608
Aren't you ashamed?
You ran away from home!

1574
01:54:26,617 --> 01:54:28,492
This is the second time
I've done that, for you.

1575
01:54:30,615 --> 01:54:31,414
Idiot!

1576
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:33,489
What's with that long face?

1577
01:54:33,603 --> 01:54:34,894
I'm right here.

1578
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:36,926
You leave now.
We'll meet later.

1579
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,684
Wait up...
