1
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,300
You ruined my life

2
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,770
About how much you awaited me

3
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,820
Everything was sent in the water

4
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,400
You ruined your life

5
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,750
You did it with a false love and married a drama

6
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,740
Trusting you and my parents,
 Everything is abandoned

7
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,310
They say that there is more,
Is not it shy?

8
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,770
I must be ashamed

9
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,190
Why should I be ashamed?

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,520
Why did you marry me?

11
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,830
I thought you were getting married and becoming a millionaire

12
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,030
Stay calm

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,090
You loved it

14
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,690
To see this day?

15
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,290
Now ask what else they need

16
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,840
Then go get the dowry

17
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,500
I will never go there

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,290
Everything is abandoned. How come again

19
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,980
I did not know that you would do this in a bad way

20
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,800
Even if I lose my life, I will not take the dowry

21
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,060
Is that your final decision?
"Yes"

22
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm leaving. Ai't never come in.
Go

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,540
No, I do not ... I do not want to

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,570
All right, give me my child
Take him with me

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,950
Do not touch the child ..
It's my child

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,990
You gave birth to this house,
That's my baby, I want him

27
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,550
What did you take with him?
To make someone slacker

28
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,540
Teach him to lie

29
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,190
I do not have the boy

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,490
You go to where you want to go. No, no, no

31
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,580
I tell the boy that your father died

32
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,450
I did not tell him anything about you

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,350
You are not welcomed,
Give me the boy

34
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,900
Leave,
Get off

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,300
Leave

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,920
This is my child

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,260
What are you doing?
If not, you will not have the child

38
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,910
Crazy?
I'll cut you down

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,640
Here, take it

40
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,290
Get out of here

41
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,920
do not

42
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,890
Where is my child?

43
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,420
This is my child,
Leave

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,620
Give my baby

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
Give me my child back

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,050
My child

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,970
Open the door

48
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,320
Give me my child

49
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,720
My child ...!

50
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,550
Do not ... do not

51
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,320
Do not cry, son

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,100
Your mother left us

53
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,740
He says I'm a bastard

54
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,400
Forget about your mother,
Do not worry

55
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,370
I'm with you

56
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,300
My son is doing you a little lazy

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,020
From today, you and I are the only ones we are with

58
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,770
Drink milk

59
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,320
Take good care of you

60
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,250
My wife died

61
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,550
At this point your situation is bad

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,820
There is no child in our life

63
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,130
We will make this child do not worry

64
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,780
Give Sunila the money

65
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,680
Give me one

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,450
Let me meet when you want to meet him

67
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,180
Do not worry, we can come at any time

68
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,830
Son

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Who is it?

70
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,080
I visited my son

71
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,300
He's with Garden Aya

72
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm your real father

73
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,360
True, come on, my child

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,480
With

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,250
Ma'am, you're working here

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Thirsty, give me a little water,

77
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,080
My son came

78
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,840
Your real papa is over

79
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,390
No one here to get out there

80
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,070
It's not what it's done right or wrong

81
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,240
But what's going on is good

82
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,070
You are my lucky lottery lottery son

83
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,270
Your mother then lied to me

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,440
father

85
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,490
I have no mom

86
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,890
You do not have a mummy

87
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
A cancer and she died

88
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,720
We took him to roche in our hands
I spent everything ... trying the best

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,640
But the son could not save him

90
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,100
I do not have a mother either

91
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,690
God forbade us

92
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,420
I will not abandon God if I find him

93
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,850
You eat

94
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,180
I ate two icons, but I do not have money

95
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,370
I'll get home from you

96
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,720
Do not lie,
Do not leave the money

97
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,300
This is in your hands

98
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,300
Put it here, you will not be angry

99
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,350
If you did not have this, my grandfather would be dead

100
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,820
Take the money and come

101
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,420
Who is this violet?
Consumers' sir

102
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,390
This is an Antic

103
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,640
That means a very old one

104
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010
Very valuable

105
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,490
So how much is this?

106
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,260
I do not care if it's two or three pounds. Meet me

107
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,210
He's gone out, sir

108
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,630
Do a job

109
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,180
This is my card, when he's here, call me

110
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,340
It's okay if you're more than a hundred thousand. The mate is stingy,
Understand

111
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,110
Sorry

112
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,560
How can I live in a society with no knowledge of the Antichrist?

113
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,660
Get in and get in

114
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,460
Here I am, your money, give me my vintage

115
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,060
Somewhere,
No, I do not

116
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,110
Zia will kill me

117
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,580
Do not worry, I'll get a new one
It's old

118
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,020
My grandfather said it was worth it

119
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,640
Shut up, we do not even get a couple of calls

120
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,460
Do not Cry

121
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,460
There are 5000 of them. Go tell the Vicar to say to him

122
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,030
If this number is not in the field, please check the number and call again

123
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,010
It's not a wrong idea to make a deception

124
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,560
But it is wrong to deceive

125
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,510
Look, son

126
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,740
My dear,
I'm yours

127
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,960
We're the only human son

128
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,090
No one can come among us

129
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,160
Understand

130
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,210
Your father has a dream to be a millionaire

131
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,610
I want to be a millionaire,
Ok Father,

132
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,780
Run

133
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,960
Jo??p?r

134
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,540
What we've stolen so hard,

135
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,110
You will not bother with us

136
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,660
I stole from thieves

137
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,410
If you come to the middle, it will crush you

138
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,430
We are nurses
The guy says we're crushed

139
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,460
Do not give our money back

140
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
Why are you worried?

141
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,090
Raised our money

142
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,460
He asks us why he is worried

143
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,210
If I get angry, I'll hit the dogs

144
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,210
What are you looking for?

145
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,660
What

146
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,260
What did you say?

147
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,290
Do not mess with me

148
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,760
My mother's surgery is money

149
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,110
What did you say,
Mother hospital

150
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,210
Money is needed

151
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,240
True, she says, Pam ...
I'm coming to the hospital

152
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,760
Let's take Mother or wait.
Let me show you

153
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,260
Let's go

154
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,690
Let's go

155
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,450
If I lie, I will do what you say

156
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,010
What does it say
How much he loves the son and his son

157
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,160
Who knows who his mother is

158
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,930
I'm sure this is his mother,
I do not have a mother

159
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Son

160
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,230
Hardly earned this money
Think about it

161
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,330
Here

162
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,360
Say thank you

163
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,590
Thanks for telling me he made us our money

164
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,530
He is not abandoned,
remember,
I saw the son

165
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,140
The way of the world

166
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,340
All of them are cricket balls

167
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,840
Do not be merciful to them

168
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,950
They do not deserve to be merciful

169
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,970
There is one rule and son,
Raise the place, money

170
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,920
To mercy,
We can not show kindness

171
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,400
father,
What?

172
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,860
Going this way,
Do I make a marriage?

173
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
This is not the age to marry me

174
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,370
Not mine yours

175
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,920
Daddy does not go to bed at night

176
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,150
Gadak sleeps intently

177
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,250
it's OK,
Do not get involved in the wedding

178
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,620
The girls stay now can not be trusted

179
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,630
Not like you, I will get a better person

180
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,250
Let's take a risk

181
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:31,340
Look at a village girl can look after her home well

182
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,910
Vermila, Vera Rehman, Muntatha were with your mother

183
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,040
Where are these girlfriends these days?

184
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,970
It's not girls today

185
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,950
They are not in our rule

186
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,970
At times, she escapes with anyone

187
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,090
If his girlfriend comes home
Imagine we're losing

188
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,620
I see that he is below

189
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,300
Go for him

190
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,890
Look here

191
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,690
Find him

192
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,490
Take a look

193
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Fine, brother

194
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,030
Did they find you

195
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,600
No

196
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,020
Come on, come on, the next train,
Do not worry

197
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,220
Then come and talk to me and I'll get you

198
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,690
Right

199
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,300
Pardon, ma'am

200
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,710
One need

201
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,650
You have to do some work for me

202
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,220
Come on, get me a photo

203
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,150
Right

204
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
Give your hand

205
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,670
Here's the camera

206
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,570
All right, I'm ready

207
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,150
Now take the full photo

208
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,700
Go quick, brother

209
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,720
For mature

210
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,750
I like Sharak Khan

211
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,450
I'm like a filmwriter

212
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,970
Get one of you?
It's very beautiful for that dress

213
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,500
do not

214
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,130
Come on, I'll take you

215
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,560
Feeling laughing, ma'am

216
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,960
The lady has been here till now .. I will take her completely

217
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,210
Smile

218
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,690
Smile so much

219
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,300
Where did she go?

220
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,410
One of my four

221
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,310
Do you want a machine?
What's the machine?

222
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,540
$ Slip strain

223
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,590
You're saying American dollars

224
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,180
They are testing everybody here
The Indian rupee ... no one checks the dollar

225
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,940
You can chew for a while,
What's up

226
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,790
Two thousand two

227
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,610
Right one point

228
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,650
The last 50000 is not ... no

229
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,200
If you have money,
You keep it

230
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,820
I feel suspicious of you

231
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,370
Tell me

232
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,290
I am new to this city

233
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,820
It's here today

234
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,420
I do not have anything here

235
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,300
Why did you see me?

236
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,170
I was scared

237
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,800
Something in this suitcase
You have to be scared

238
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,090
There's something

239
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,650
Take it

240
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,720
Show my suspicion
What's in it

241
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,650
Show

242
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,650
Both

243
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,470
Out

244
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,720
Appocciy?

245
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,650
I became pregnant when I was young

246
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,420
No work has been done yet

247
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,690
Where

248
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,940
I will not abandon when I can see it

249
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,770
Dad, what happened?

250
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,220
Tell him that the chest is in this chest

251
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,040
What do I know,
Recall those on top

252
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,690
This is the diamond in the box

253
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,640
He brought him a saree

254
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
What is this?

255
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,600
Moron,
Got a clothes shop

256
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,520
I do not know

257
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,320
God has not helped,
After seeing this suit, the son lost his faith in God

258
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,650
O

259
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,490
What are you doing here?

260
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,700
My own people called me

261
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,170
Why?

262
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,170
Who is in the picture?

263
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,320
your mother

264
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,070
My wife

265
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,120
From the Lord Buddha

266
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,710
From morning till noon

267
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,870
Your mother took a ritual for you

268
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,770
I asked for a mandate

269
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,000
A priest who does 20000 is a son

270
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,530
I did not ask for mercy

271
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,820
For your mother

272
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,450
For your mom's peace

273
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,270
For my deeds

274
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,520
What did you think?

275
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,580
Did you forget your mother died?

276
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,680
Why Crying

277
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,030
All of them tell us thieves

278
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,250
Do not worry

279
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,900
When I hear about my mom, I'm wrong

280
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,470
I could not even find it

281
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:21,330
There are 50000 here

282
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,100
father

283
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,620
You're fortunate to be my father

284
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,150
What are you talking about?

285
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,410
I do not know how to take 4,
Show

286
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,950
This red one will flip out

287
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,470
Close

288
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,750
Divide the leaves

289
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,800
Shanthi

290
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Bromley

291
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,100
How much did you call?
He does not answer

292
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
What happened?

293
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,020
A person in my room hit one of the four

294
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,220
After that, I met another foe,
I just put my suitcase on

295
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,650
At night, where were you?

296
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,300
Home forced me to force me to marry

297
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,850
Money with a car

298
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,000
He has plenty of property,
I do not know

299
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,020
Father is not accepted

300
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,560
Big brother is also for Dad

301
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,300
Little brother, I'm not listening

302
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,930
Anybody else did not listen to me

303
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,450
Mother was angry

304
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,200
The woman who never spoke

305
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,200
The first time I spoke against Dad

306
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,680
Until now, I did not say anything

307
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,520
You and your son always worked the wrong way

308
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,630
Kill property to snatch property ...
Those men do not care

309
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,970
You kill them with death

310
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,250
Get what you eat

311
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,630
The marriage of their daughter for money
I'm trying to get up with a nasty man

312
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,400
Like a father

313
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,000
I am shy

314
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,090
What did you say?

315
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,420
You talk tonight

316
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,800
I did not get married

317
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,860
The person I say is getting married

318
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,420
Do not like it or else kill it

319
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,920
After his death, let him marry someone he wants

320
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,700
My wife hit me

321
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,020
The woman who does not speak in front of me touched my hand

322
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,230
You killed my sons and sisters

323
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,100
Because I married her
I can not do anything to him

324
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,800
Kill

325
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,880
Kill

326
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,900
Papa, I shut your wife's mouth

327
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,050
As you wish

328
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,880
What are you doing?

329
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,150
I'm your son

330
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,730
do not

331
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,580
I miss it

332
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
Do not go home

333
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,550
What is this?

334
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,150
Not found,
Help Open

335
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,030
All right, all the goods are ours

336
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,620
That's help

337
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,950
We got a bet we got 20000 ... right
Whatever they are

338
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,250
Nothing,
That's the game

339
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,480
Right

340
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,550
Give me the right money

341
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,730
Which one has to open soon

342
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,800
Open it so easy and open it up

343
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,630
Possession of clothes

344
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,250
You do not have a job

345
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,070
Be a guide like me

346
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,050
Many foreigners come here ..
Tell them whatever they want

347
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,100
Get the money

348
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,230
You can say anything

349
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,680
Say something to a story

350
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,850
It's worth 150 to 200 years old

351
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,250
Good to be old

352
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,650
Do not worry, I'm there

353
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm mine

354
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,600
Excuse me, you want to buy clothes

355
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,730
Yes

356
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,730
Well, there's a 80% discount on a holiday at a discount,
S

357
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,980
It's 50

358
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,430
These are my clothes

359
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,480
Give it quick

360
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,550
These clothes are mine

361
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,000
This is a suit case

362
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,000
One man pushed this one

363
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,650
Who are you?

364
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,580
Why me?

365
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,780
Give me your belongings

366
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,910
I did not see the complaint either

367
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,860
true

368
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
Do not sell it

369
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,630
Look, this is my mother's suede

370
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,910
I love my mom so much,
It was his last memory

371
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,160
Give me that again

372
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,380
Give me the box

373
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,580
Give it back to the girl

374
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,830
This is ours

375
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,430
Do not play with me

376
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,130
Put 20000 on them

377
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,430
The last time is 12000
Said 20000 y

378
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,630
Give it quick

379
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,250
The box is yours, but it has one condition

380
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,460
As a condition

381
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,280
Take a single step

382
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,290
No, I will not

383
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,980
Will change

384
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,060
Only the eyes can feel,
Then I will understand

385
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,080
Sale

386
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,500
Give him one shot once

387
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,530
So to die

388
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,260
Come upstairs

389
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,180
Open your eyes

390
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,980
Remove your hand,
There is no shrewd box

391
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,800
come here

392
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,960
Open your eyes and see

393
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,550
What's your name?

394
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,290
My name is Flexi

395
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,080
Those who are blaming Monny

396
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,050
This is what I talk about,

397
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,230
come here

398
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Open your eyes

399
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,690
Dad, I met my girlfriend

400
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,160
Where,
Is he small? That's it

401
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,880
If you have money,
Or else

402
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,330
There's a box, it's a guide

403
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,830
If it was better if the chest had been shot

404
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,010
She's very good

405
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,460
I want a lot of money in my life

406
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,710
I want a beautiful girl

407
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,980
He's somewhere

408
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,460
Jaipur

409
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,160
You're going to make this Mafia Blower and go to Jayapur

410
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,160
If I take my daughter's phone

411
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,210
Find out where he is ...

412
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,330
Pandu

413
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,740
You do not take my energy into a joke

414
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:16,530
Then he will be destroyed

415
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,110
I'll tell you what

416
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,040
Talk to me in hours

417
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,520
From there, he did what

418
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:03,410
He had three women

419
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,040
What are three women?

420
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,140
From there I decided what kind of wife this is

421
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,510
Nowadays, ladies look at their husbands
 Looks like Cikiti is waiting

422
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,640
If they were not so, they would not be

423
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,730
Listen

424
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,290
Where is our son?

425
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,290
I just sat there

426
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,290
Where is my son?

427
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,910
You were in the lead crazy

428
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,510
Stop the nonsense

429
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:06,170
Look, I shot a tourist son

430
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,790
Let us do the blackmail

431
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,640
Hello

432
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,410
A passenger of a tourist was kidnapped
Do not understand what to do

433
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,760
It's like seven years old, red carpet

434
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,850
Do not worry,
If I find out, do not tell the police

435
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,010
His mother is in the police

436
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,740
Dad, let's get this child back

437
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,980
My girlfriend is waiting in the police station

438
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:46,060
Your new girl is your god
Would you dismiss your father?

439
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,460
We'll find the money for this boy

440
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,900
Is the brain rotten, yes
Wait there

441
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:59,510
Let's see if there's any money in the pocket

442
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,710
Let's go, son

443
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,790
How are you, your son?

444
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,190
Your girlfriend made a big mistake

445
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,190
My son

446
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,440
Whom did you go with?

447
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,020
You got caught up in this,
Doing anything for you

448
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,340
Tell me who you are with

449
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,540
His father sent me,
This elder brother loves this sister

450
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,590
My sister called my brother,
Brother brought me

451
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,940
Your dad,

452
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,300
His father is a thief

453
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,010
He's a big thief

454
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,960
I can not believe,
Why can not you believe it. Ismail is a thief

455
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,490
Look at him

456
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,720
He stole one of my four

457
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,090
This is your father

458
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,990
That means your family is ruined

459
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,470
You've met your son,
Why was Dad in? Take the case back

460
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,060
I thought I was crazy,
The police treat him well

461
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:40,100
If I did not remove the case,
Do not worry, this is my Alia

462
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,690
I'm always complaining to the police

463
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,730
My dad came out in an hour
Or I'll cut you down

464
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,610
Do not worry

465
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,390
It's the hour

466
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,690
Do you threaten me?

467
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,720
I loved a thief

468
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,710
A thief or too late
Know why

469
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:40,620
Until now, my son did not know what I was saying

470
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,760
Because of you, he's turning to me today

471
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:53,040
My son got away from me because of you

472
00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:03,660
Tell your situation,
Before you cut it

473
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,610
He's gonna kill you

474
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,890
What are you waiting for?

475
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,270
Sell ??your eyes out on the market

476
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,290
Would you send me a shade,

477
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,420
Cut if you do not go to your village

478
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:36,060
Remember, not a joke

479
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,990
What did you say would be a priest?
Yes

480
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,790
He came home from trouble

481
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,260
Here is your father

482
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,840
What's happening to me

483
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,570
Stay with your dad

484
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,420
I want to be a priest

485
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,820
Who is this?

486
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,940
My former lover

487
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,690
Do not come with him

488
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,470
This will hurt your training

489
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,520
But I forgot him,
It's you

490
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,490
But I'm telling you not to do anything hurry

491
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,270
I'm telling the truth

492
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,470
Think tomorrow for tomorrow

493
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,270
God bless

494
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,470
Wait till I wait

495
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,790
I'm not

496
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,400
You do not understand that I'm different from the two days

497
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,000
Give chance

498
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,140
After these two days, I am Father
Somebody might be

499
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,040
Do not ruin your small, small things

500
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Lower, Yoga,

501
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,690
But do not worry, or come here

502
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Right

503
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,320
Hmm

504
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,590
That girl did not know her daughter and threatened him

505
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,500
She got tired of trying to get her married

506
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,310
Go ahead

507
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,450
Our trouble is over

508
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,050
If I do not go, I will take him to the Himalayas

509
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,200
Do not talk like that

510
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,930
Or I'll do what you say

511
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,020
I suspect he is my father

512
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,700
Are you threatening me,
Kill me

513
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,030
I'll talk to him

514
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,380
The thief's employee

515
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,920
Auntie, I fell in love with a boy

516
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,130
What are you doing, boy?

517
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,720
Doing what is done

518
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,100
What's his name, Raja?

519
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,650
What's the full name?
Do not do it

520
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,200
Her village,
This is the city

521
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,880
His real village

522
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,730
Why do not you drop them?

523
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,850
Answer me

524
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:16,070
Look at my four of them. They are broken

525
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,620
This will have to be cut. Cut it

526
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,370
Masse came by on the way

527
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,280
Come home without a sound "Big Brother"

528
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,700
Whereever you're looking for,
Big brother

529
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,420
His phone is working

530
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,510
Talk to him

531
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,780
Where are you?

532
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,230
I'm not Monie

533
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,930
Who are you my sister?

534
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,100
You want to be sister

535
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,930
Then you can do anything

536
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,900
Who is yours?

537
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,660
Tell me what kind of money I will be given

538
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,130
Ask for how much money you need

539
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,180
Five lakhs

540
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,630
Ask him,
I'll give ten

541
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:53,380
If you start from the tenth, I will start on the 20th

542
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:59,760
Just in a minute

543
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,160
In Gihopur,
This guy made a crazy guy

544
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,860
Talk to our guys

545
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,380
Where's the money?

546
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,900
How much

547
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,930
Two lakhs

548
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:57,210
Let's go

549
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,980
Let's go check. Let's go

550
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,260
Monique

551
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,430
I do not know

552
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,400
You know, I'll say

553
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,930
Tell

554
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,930
It's his boy's girlfriend

555
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,680
In the Fort

556
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,450
Telling the truth

557
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,230
I told you about my message about you

558
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,230
My mother

559
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,200
I told him everything

560
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,280
If he ever wants you, he will marry you

561
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:02,660
Come on in front of him and make you really good

562
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,650
Think about it

563
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,680
Raja I'm dad

564
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,310
Let's hear briefly

565
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,380
His girlfriend is a big house

566
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:23,810
He's escaping from his house,
He asked for Rs

567
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:29,230
He's escaping from his house,
She took out the money that she had not used and got her thugs to take her girlfriend to get 20 million rupees.

568
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,910
Get 20 lakhs to get the girl,
Be careful

569
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,040
Give me 20 lakhs. Give me what to wear

570
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,940
What ?
Yo's brother spoke two lakhs

571
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,010
Empty?

572
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,110
How to do it

573
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,180
Take you home,
I get 20 million

574
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,270
Come on, come on,

575
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,480
I hate it

576
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:29,720
Give me Rs. 20 lakhs

577
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,680
Call home,
Or no one is alive

578
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,710
your mother

579
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,280
He loved you, too

580
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,010
I was called to meet him

581
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,710
It's not shame to sell the girl who loves this way

582
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,360
What kind of person are you?

583
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:53,760
Hold them

584
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,510
Do not give up

585
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,190
Let's go

586
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:07,280
Let's go

587
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,510
Why Crying

588
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,860
He's a good boy

589
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,330
Do not be crazy

590
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,680
Forget about him

591
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,410
If I did not come to you

592
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,580
Your life

593
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,210
It's in my place

594
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,030
The girl went mad behind my son

595
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:37,830
My businessman lost 200 million rupees

596
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,880
father

597
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,130
What happened?
It's not right for me

598
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,010
Someone like me talking to me

599
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,700
Since our day we lost our lives

600
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,630
Do not worry

601
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,580
Right

602
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,660
From today, if anyone comes to us
This cure will work

603
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,510
He has not left us

604
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,330
father

605
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,630
Tell Raja

606
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,330
What happened to Mom?

607
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,460
You say a lot, but you forget

608
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,760
Your mother died of cancer

609
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:26,280
The cancer is a terrible disease

610
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:30,760
He did not treat him with any hospital

611
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,520
Because the trousers spare the belt

612
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,020
What are you doing?

613
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,470
Will I?

614
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,950
Your father

615
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,050
What happened to him

616
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,700
Your mom looks at you

617
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,870
Mother is dead,
Where to watch?

618
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,520
Raj

619
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,950
Crazy

620
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,950
Save me

621
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,520
I was an error, I'm sorry

622
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,770
Your mother is alive

623
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,310
I left him

624
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,410
What does that

625
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,330
Why did you lie to me?

626
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,480
Tell

627
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:29,860
Do not hit me

628
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:36,330
I got you scared of my mother
If you knew it, you would not be afraid to say so

629
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,650
Sorry

630
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:45,380
From my kid, I cry because of my mother,
But I never thought of myself once

631
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,060
I will abandon you tonight,
Stay with Mom

632
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,930
Raj son

633
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,700
you go,
It's too late for a train

634
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,580
If I come to see me, I will be killed

635
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,360
Aunt

636
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,310
Aunt

637
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:56,680
As you flew away to him
 Does it help?

638
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,880
Do not destroy this life

639
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:01,830
You went to destroy

640
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,050
I'm marrying him

641
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:07,180
He's my daughter,
Why are you coming up?

642
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:14,160
About Auntie,
If he walks back

643
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:17,780
Not live,
Cut the nude

644
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,630
You understand her

645
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,340
They force my daughter to marry

646
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,830
If he does not, he will be killed

647
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,110
Save him

648
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:01,730
Get that girl to write

649
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:04,610
He can not come here

650
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,730
Put him in the room

651
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,600
Why you listen to what you say

652
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,380
You're helping the public,
At least try

653
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,060
Or you're going to take off your asthma

654
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,680
Are you telling me my job?

655
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,280
Have you touched my mother?

656
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,530
Have you touched my mother?

657
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:01,660
My hand touched my mother

658
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,360
Do not let the kill get killed

659
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,750
Shoot me

660
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:14,800
Shouted

661
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:20,180
You have never shot yourself,
I know

662
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:23,560
Now, let me tell you, you've got my mom in my hand

663
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,680
Now if I take the video

664
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,450
Where to send it

665
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,580
Your job is lost

666
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,830
That's why I read that woman more than that

667
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,630
Excuse me, tell my mother

668
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,430
Sorry, Mom

669
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:42,630
Thanks

670
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,630
Come on, Mom

671
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,110
Tell me, who are you?

672
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,310
I'm in his mother's name

673
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:08,730
If you are my mother, I'm burning up

674
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,530
Listen

675
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:13,830
You do not want to hear anything, you have not fooled the girl

676
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,730
He's bloody for you

677
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,980
I loved too

678
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,410
My husband is like you

679
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,210
I do not have what happened to you

680
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,370
I'm not cheating

681
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:29,090
I came here to accept my mistake

682
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,360
I want to meet her,

683
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,590
I'm not giving it

684
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,540
Listen

685
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,270
believe me,
He is my businessman

686
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,990
Otherwise, I will not,
The truth is, Mom

687
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,260
Do not say mother

688
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,940
Moni's aunt is like my mother

689
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,140
No matter how angry you are, I'm going to meet you

690
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,120
First, that house will take her

691
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,170
Then her husband will stop

692
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:16,560
I can do it

693
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,160
There's no one to go against them in this village

694
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,330
I'm the only one who can do this job

695
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,420
If you give permission

696
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,340
Tell

697
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,710
You have to tell me I'm your son

698
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,540
I'm not dead

699
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,240
I told the police station

700
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:43,990
Good to say to the people

701
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,110
You will not do anything

702
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,440
If you do this, you will ruin your life

703
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,190
As you wish

704
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,260
Mother

705
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:00,990
Go

706
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,710
That's the photo

707
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,610
My son

708
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,860
He saw her die

709
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:26,940
My husband called and told me

710
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:32,710
Talk to him. Tell him he is here

711
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,940
Mother

712
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,340
Mother

713
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:45,990
Open the door

714
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,260
Who are you, son?

715
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,360
I am the son of a millionaire

716
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,010
She may not have died

717
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,640
I'm living a crazy guy as if I'm dead

718
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,570
My mother trusts me

719
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:15,820
How much time later I met my mother

720
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,890
You understand yourself

721
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,440
Open your Lakshmi door, your son

722
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,140
This is my son

723
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,710
Greetings sir

724
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:51,340
You see your mother?

725
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:57,850
Yes, your mother will hear the news happily die because of that

726
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:53,020
What did you think,
You are being cured of cancer

727
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,550
You've been recognized, Mom

728
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,500
You've seen yourself cramped and crawling

729
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:11,620
I feel like blowing you up

730
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,870
Do not eat unless you drink

731
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,450
I keep it to myself

732
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:20,090
I'm talking to the morning,

733
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:21,290
Right

734
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:03,820
What did you say?

735
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,020
My sister's son

736
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,250
They beat you

737
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,870
She's so scary

738
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,420
He also has a video on us

739
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,220
Someone came to meet you

740
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,100
She

741
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,720
Greetings uncle

742
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:16,730
I'm Raja

743
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,050
You died while you were younger

744
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,400
You know everything about my dad

745
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,150
Where's your dad?

746
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:29,400
Father died a long time ago

747
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:35,150
Before he went, he told you about it

748
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,180
You have sons,
Where are they?

749
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,600
They're right

750
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,420
The family said you died

751
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,980
Tell me my uncle died,
How did I just come right now?

752
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,730
There is a daughter

753
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,650
This is your daughter

754
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,230
What's your name?

755
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,500
Quickly say,
M?nak?i

756
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:05,830
So Monny is someone out there

757
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,830
Love me, Moni

758
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,380
Tell that name, you do not need the name of your name

759
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,380
Let's go in

760
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:18,150
Uncle, you made the house

761
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,030
Very good

762
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,030
Get out of here

763
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:37,750
Your taste is awesome

764
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:44,350
Making this ground up,
Great

765
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,980
Why did she go inside?

766
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:56,150
I'm a good man. I am your son-in-law

767
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,730
It's a big mess

768
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,740
A lot of big rooms have been built

769
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,330
Whatever you are, you're super

770
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,030
He's been in such a big house
Why is my mother in a hut?

771
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,230
What if they ask a question when they answer?

772
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:34,830
What is this?

773
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:41,780
Keep inside the anger

774
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,780
Such speed is not good on the first day

775
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,980
I'm taking my ownership

776
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,440
Sure

777
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,540
Let's go with me,
Not spinning

778
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,460
You're playing me in front of Uncle

779
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,510
I'm scared for a minute. Sir

780
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,590
How to act

781
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,790
From today, you are my partner

782
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,360
Whatever you say, I will

783
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,960
Why did you bring the whole village here?

784
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:56,910
You're your uncle and the people in the village
There are real properties

785
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,410
This place is their

786
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,290
They cultivate it,
You're taking the fruit

787
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:05,380
They will not be separated,
Ask us questions who are you?

788
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,230
Work out with me
Remember that before, my mother

789
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:34,190
My mother is not ashamed to ask questions

790
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,390
Who are you?

791
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:39,960
I am your ancestor's son

792
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,260
Now go home and meet Uncle and Mom

793
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,730
You even met

794
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:48,310
Big big brother is going to meet him

795
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,430
The name is good

796
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,160
I'm rain,
This is the rain in the village

797
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:15,510
If I'm bothered by my mom, I'll be on the road

798
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,530
Your ancestors are also missing,
Remember

799
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,810
Who are you? Call me

800
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,760
It's a fight between me and my brother

801
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,830
Why did you come downstairs?

802
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,380
More for you

803
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,830
Instead, I lifted my son's life

804
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,490
Do not give up

805
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,740
Father sent this one

806
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,760
We're whipped to our people

807
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:38,740
He is with the village people

808
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,310
They ask for the right of the village,
What is he doing?

809
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,410
They attack us

810
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,390
Like dogs

811
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:03,110
Lakshmi looks like our grievances
God forbid your son

812
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,940
Look,
Super

813
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,540
This is you and me in a fight

814
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:21,570
The more they danced, that's why they beat them

815
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:25,260
I'm blaming everyone for bringing you home

816
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,710
Dad, I'm ending him

817
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,080
Sorry

818
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:48,630
Go him to the hospital

819
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,910
Whose side are you on, sir?

820
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:55,810
Take it off

821
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,140
Go

822
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:03,540
Go quickly

823
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,610
He hit him so badly

824
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:22,790
So, it's lurking like this

825
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:25,760
Therefore, I do not know whether your father will be killing people like this

826
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,860
What will happen to you now?

827
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,280
Looks like a climber

828
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,230
He's not shielding

829
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,800
Father, let me have you

830
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:51,260
Fighting

831
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:52,970
I'm coming,
Put in the guns

832
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,340
What are you doing?

833
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,540
Yoga

834
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:21,590
Well

835
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:25,840
In your daughter

836
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,810
If time's good, everything will be fine

837
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:48,310
I only saw your daughter in the picture,
If I'm giving him a call

838
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,320
Definitely

839
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,420
Look at that

840
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,270
I got my picture for you

841
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,240
Here

842
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:22,490
You can see at any time
No, there's no behind

843
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,240
I can talk

844
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:39,260
This is not a bad idea about my second marriage,
She went with someone else. I gave her the culprit

845
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,840
I do not want to be on top of this

846
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:50,290
We're here to get married,
We're going to honeymoon Belgium

847
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:57,020
Daddy is one way when he gets married to him

848
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,820
Let's dress them up in the honeymoon

849
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,220
Let's know how to know

850
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,720
We brought your son back to you

851
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,920
Let him in, please

852
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:31,870
Go

853
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,020
Your mom is talking

854
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:43,150
I know why you want to be my son

855
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:48,090
I'm ready to say that you are my son

856
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,840
And he does your word

857
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:58,270
And do not start your love story

858
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,450
Tell me what to do now

859
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,670
How much does he give?

860
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:10,890
A place to sleep,
And another 50000 book written for my son

861
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,570
I do not know how much it is now

862
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:25,170
Listen

863
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:31,700
Think of a way out there

864
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:35,900
Do not take it back

865
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,520
I'll take everything away

866
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:45,190
What are you doing?

867
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,650
Say something for something

868
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,220
Everyone in front of you

869
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:01,980
They sue their village women

870
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,150
What are you saying?

871
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,300
Who taught you

872
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,350
Which school you went to school?

873
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:19,450
We have money for ourselves

874
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:23,800
If we find money, we will be in front of us
 I do not think what ever I do

875
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,700
If we find money, we will be in front of us
I do not think what ever I do

876
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:34,220
What do you think now?

877
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,020
Bromley

878
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:41,220
Do not go to her

879
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:42,770
Right

880
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:44,650
Eat

881
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:10,350
get up

882
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,170
get up

883
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,500
Moni's room, where,

884
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,050
Moni's room, where,

885
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,350
Upstairs, sir

886
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:17,540
Tell him I'm going to his room

887
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,940
Do not go sir

888
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,460
It is for the first time here that the food is served by the hand of Mom

889
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:52,980
That's why you are

890
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,690
If you do not come to my life

891
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,390
I do not get my mother

892
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:10,940
I loved to meet my mom shortly

893
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:13,410
How happy you are to meet him

894
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,410
I can not say how happy I am

895
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,960
I can understand

896
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,190
You've never been so happy

897
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,460
Tell it with your tears

898
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:33,890
I came to see me

899
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:37,540
If you come in the middle, you will be killed

900
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,990
That brother says

901
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:40,460
Which brother?
Ram Ram

902
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,490
Where is he?

903
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:42,870
Sleep down

904
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,410
I'll understand now

905
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:46,710
Do not go

906
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,190
Ram's room Where?

907
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,280
Over there

908
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,030
Meet him

909
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:00,260
Do not say that

910
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:05,340
elder brother

911
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:07,740
get up

912
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:17,810
Who is this time?

913
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:25,820
I came two days,
I was hoping to meet you

914
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:26,990
Who

915
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,740
I'm Raja

916
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,940
He hit you

917
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:36,830
I am myself

918
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,610
What are you doing at my house right now?

919
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,860
This is your home alone

920
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,990
I came to my house

921
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,480
Kill him

922
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:33,480
Kill him

923
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:39,080
Ram

924
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,160
Cut him,
Uncle, Mom, they are you

925
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:44,090
You decided

926
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,640
do not do like that

927
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:01,410
Stay

928
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,190
Crazy

929
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,410
I do not want your uncle

930
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,460
Raja do not do this, your big brother

931
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:13,840
Do not kill me

932
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,590
I came to see you,
Not to argue

933
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,740
Do not understand

934
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,340
I came to your feet

935
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,990
But you're not fitting that

936
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:27,110
He put a hand on little boy

937
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,910
What happened

938
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,430
Today's day

939
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:05,290
My son was born

940
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,610
I am her

941
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,440
Remember

942
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:21,510
Remember him forever

943
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:25,410
I always remind him

944
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,630
Look at her

945
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,930
What have you decided?

946
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,180
what

947
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,880
How is your son missing?

948
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,480
I am a teacher

949
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:36,540
One woman gave birth to a baby
Screams in pain

950
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,940
But that's it

951
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:49,210
The name is born from a stomach a month

952
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:57,540
But after the boyfriend then

953
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:00,040
His
Boy

954
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,790
When somebody takes it in his eyes

955
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:11,140
Her pain is another woman
Only I can understand

956
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,590
Everyone else to understand

957
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,210
Who knows who died when the baby was born?

958
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,060
What

959
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,910
Your son is on the line

960
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:50,190
Why did not he speak to me?

961
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,060
Let him know

962
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,160
What's on my birthday in Aphrodite?

963
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,090
When is it today,
March 15th

964
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,060
Mother says that today

965
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:03,620
Pools

966
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,390
My mother is right

967
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:07,640
I do not remember exactly your birthday

968
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:10,920
To celebrate birthday with him today

969
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:18,370
I'm hitting something

970
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,720
I gave money to do that

971
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,850
What are they saying?

972
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:29,130
This makes me like an animal

973
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,580
It hurts

974
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,930
Do you hurt,
Do you know why I was not here and how much Mother suffered

975
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:44,220
My son is forgiving me

976
01:44:44,290 --> 01:44:46,570
Do not attack

977
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:49,450
Raja

978
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,820
They're doing a lot

979
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,600
He made me feel bad

980
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,800
It's a great deal, sir

981
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:05,620
I came to meet you

982
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,870
The girl gave a tip

983
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,570
He is going to get married

984
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,480
He does not want to marry that fighter, sir

985
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:16,820
Sir, you do something, sir

986
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:21,550
At 10.05 am there is a good choice

987
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,900
do not be late

988
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,530
I'm coming in before

989
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,050
I get married more than you

990
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:38,700
Who
Why are you hanging my picture?

991
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:40,800
I'm not your fan

992
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,800
You're a married man

993
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,800
I love the monster

994
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,800
Respect Our Love and Puskinus

995
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,630
Love is yours

996
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:56,950
I'm getting married

997
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,580
He has a boyfriend

998
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,780
He wants you to not marry him, but I will

999
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:07,900
He's got a Romeo boy. I have Juliet.
We can make this hide-and-seek hide

1000
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,430
I do not want to get married

1001
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,260
Do not know, I have to curl back

1002
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,430
It hurts so much

1003
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,910
What happened to you?

1004
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:25,480
Why do not you have to marry?

1005
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:29,030
Why are you guys coming to my boss?

1006
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:30,360
She already has a boyfriend

1007
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,480
He did me this way

1008
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:35,810
If I get married, I will die

1009
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,030
If not married,
I'll kill you

1010
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,360
Even if they get married, they will kill me

1011
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:45,760
Unmarried

1012
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:47,960
I'm killing myself

1013
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:51,960
If you say that you are a boy, I will get married

1014
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,580
Who was that,
Talk to her

1015
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:01,080
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is it?

1016
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:02,360
Tell

1017
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,030
I do not have any boyfriend

1018
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:05,610
So is he lying?

1019
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:08,560
She says she has no boy

1020
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,980
Right now, you know

1021
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:12,260
Ask your sister for who she is

1022
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:25,100
You can not spare anybody except in my heart

1023
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,510
No, it's my face, my face

1024
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:29,680
That's my face

1025
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,780
I will not want to be married,
I can not die

1026
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:34,360
Your daughter loves nobody else

1027
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:37,260
I do not want to die,
I want to live

1028
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,830
Why came helicopter to our village?

1029
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:09,680
There is no doubt

1030
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,910
Where to go

1031
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,780
We can not go to our sir

1032
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:17,470
Because sir, in our village

1033
01:53:17,470 --> 01:53:19,190
Who are you?

1034
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:20,880
Why shout

1035
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,860
Who yöu just asked?

1036
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:32,260
This is the village lantern

1037
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,640
Working together will work

1038
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:39,390
I'll give you a commission

1039
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:42,240
I've come to check up now

1040
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:45,760
After landing once, our land will be ours

1041
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,740
No problem will be separated

1042
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,460
If you come with us, we'll get you a partner

1043
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:13,110
Why look at each other's faces?

1044
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:15,710
Are you suspicious?

1045
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,180
Why are you talking to me?

1046
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:29,710
You can not beat me like that

1047
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:31,210
You talk again,

1048
01:54:33,710 --> 01:54:35,090
He can tell the truth

1049
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:38,440
Will not you be gone?
I am

1050
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:40,760
Then take it,
Take it

1051
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:44,890
Listen

1052
01:54:45,190 --> 01:54:48,290
Do not be quiet here

1053
01:54:53,290 --> 01:54:55,140
How big is your land?
"Pierce 20"

1054
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:57,760
Give the money

1055
01:54:59,060 --> 01:54:59,880
Here

1056
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,910
Do not do this

1057
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:08,790
Do not hit me

1058
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,590
Do not hit me

1059
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,260
Do not hit me

1060
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,840
Here you go

1061
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:27,360
How much do you have?
4 points

1062
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:32,360
I'll give you all the money tomorrow

1063
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:33,890
Going

1064
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,360
Come here

1065
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:51,210
Work in the proper time,
Written tomorrow

1066
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,410
Tomorrow the covenant

1067
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:55,810
You're allergic to colleagues

1068
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:56,560
Thanks

1069
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,060
I

1070
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:03,590
He has a right too

1071
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:08,160
If I have part of the site

1072
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:11,760
Oppose the whole village,
No registration is reserved

1073
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,660
Who is this boy?

1074
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:20,060
He's thinking he's smart

1075
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:25,710
Take care of him for this,
I want the land to be free

1076
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:29,710
Did he hit you too?

1077
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,690
This is not him

1078
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:33,460
Just do what you say

1079
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:39,030
Put it in

1080
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:41,260
See what

1081
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:50,510
Fiter Babu sent a complaint to him

1082
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:53,810
Take my step if people make a complaint
Because I am a servant of the people

1083
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,780
do not

1084
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:25,780
Why is it?

1085
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:29,540
Do not attack

1086
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:33,630
Leave him

1087
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:37,110
Get him out tomorrow

1088
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:56,240
Going

1089
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,510
Sir, do not kill him

1090
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:16,260
He's not my son

1091
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:18,260
Not my son

1092
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,110
What?
Is not it your son?

1093
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:30,860
father

1094
01:58:33,110 --> 01:58:35,110
What are you doing,
Hold him

1095
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,460
Kill your son

1096
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,360
Who would kill my son?

1097
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,830
Hold him

1098
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:42,830
The police are going to get him to Enkutter

1099
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:27,430
There is no one in the village

1100
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:29,480
Everybody's gone home,
What did you say?

1101
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:31,110
Is there no one in the village?
Yes

1102
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,160
Look at each other

1103
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:38,430
Go away

1104
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:43,930
Tramped there

1105
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:53,210
elder brother

1106
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,910
I ran and ran away from here

1107
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,660
father

1108
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:14,910
Hey

1109
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,680
My dad trained me

1110
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:19,460
Wailen

1111
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,260
Where's the valence,
Where to eat, where to eat

1112
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:32,980
Now, I'm just crying

1113
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:38,360
All the players of JayaPur

1114
02:00:41,330 --> 02:00:43,080
Every village has a gentleman
You took the money

1115
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:46,630
From that money, I sent them to vacation

1116
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:50,930
Finish it

1117
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,260
Why is this your son?

1118
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:05,330
Yes

1119
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:07,860
I do not know him

1120
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,010
But it

1121
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:14,430
I'm just saying that we and I are together
That there is some bond

1122
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,860
If anything happens to you, son

1123
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,710
You do not know what will happen to me

1124
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,930
I can not even live

1125
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:37,060
When you attacked everyone

1126
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,730
I understood

1127
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,210
God has sent this strength for us

1128
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,230
This is my son

1129
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,910
He will stand up

1130
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,410
I'm also fighting

1131
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:55,980
Yes, I will fight with you too

1132
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:34,730
Kill him

1133
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:43,980
Leave it

1134
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,230
You can not save anyone from it

1135
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:51,880
Listen

1136
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:54,930
He's dead in front of you

1137
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:56,480
In front of you

1138
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:04,230
Marapan Uva

1139
02:04:42,530 --> 02:04:43,030
You will not do anything

1140
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:17,580
My son

1141
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:49,630
do not

1142
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,880
Siva

1143
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:58,160
Son

1144
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:02,160
Do not give it away

1145
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,380
Kill

1146
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:11,280
I'm not getting you alive

1147
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:35,710
Do not give up, that

1148
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,160
Cut it down.

1149
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:42,580
You forget your marriage

1150
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:44,010
You're killing him

1151
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:47,640
Get her to marry him

1152
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,910
The mind is completely crazy with the mind

1153
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,680
Let's go

1154
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:54,110
Going

1155
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,360
Override

1156
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:04,590
Do not say mother

1157
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:06,590
You do not know the value of a mother

1158
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,640
Let him go without worry

1159
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:22,190
This one, son-in-law?
Shoot

1160
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,290
Override

1161
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:34,160
Thanks

1162
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,100
Son

1163
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,100
This is what is normal

1164
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:08,850
I waited for this day

1165
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:11,770
Your daughter-in-law has told me in my dream

1166
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:13,900
Love King

1167
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:17,870
I do not get a single rupee from me,
Tell him

1168
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:19,320
Why do not get me

1169
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,550
My son was liberated from this village

1170
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:29,420
God wants
This is the head of this village, this is his son's dream

1171
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:31,870
Or, thank you, my baby

1172
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:34,300
But there's a little difference,
Tell him, son
Tell

1173
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:37,380
Why was the belt out?
You beat your mother for wrongdoing

1174
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,500
Tell me, Mom

1175
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:44,020
This menu is also done,
He'll give me a drink

1176
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:44,950
Do not attack

1177
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:55,900
So if so,

1178
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:56,770
Right

1179
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:59,770
It happened to me

1180
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,570
Forgive

1181
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:03,870
I'm sorry to pardon you.
