1
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,594
Dear people

2
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,790
Swami Ullaasaananda Thiruvadigal
has opened his eyes

3
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:53,919
Let's wait for Swami's next miracle

4
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,647
Yes, it's about to happen

5
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,545
The miracle is about to happen

6
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,940
Here come ashes out of thin air

7
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:11,136
Our dear Ullaasaananda Swami
Thiruvadigal is hovering in air

8
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,018
and scattering holy ashes around

9
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,980
- He is distributing blessings for free
- Hey

10
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,579
Oh holy cross

11
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,899
What the hell is this?

12
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,616
Look, there is nothing underneath

13
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,355
Do you get it?

14
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,183
This is the trick behind this miracle

15
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:37,562
Do you see that?

16
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:42,593
Go

17
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:43,991
Listen up everybody

18
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,693
Over here

19
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,773
Do you see the boiling oil?

20
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:48,885
Have a look

21
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,161
See that

22
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,677
I'm going to put

23
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:53,788
this key

24
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,484
into this boiling oil

25
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,142
- Here it goes
- Yes

26
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,866
This key will be taken out

27
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,384
with bare hands

28
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:05,695
Lijo here will do it

29
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,791
Maashe (teacher)

30
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:07,892
I'm afraid, maashe

31
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,268
- Don't be afraid
- No maashe

32
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,732
- Do you see?
- I will burn my hand

33
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,779
Lijo is scared

34
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:12,868
Everyone will be scared

35
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:17,038
But a rationalist should be brave

36
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,359
Since Lijo is scared I will
take it out with this hand

37
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,218
- With this hand
- Maashu will do it

38
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,115
This is how it is done
(Lijo screaming)

39
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,223
Oh my God

40
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,710
He will spend the
night in hospital

41
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:30,289
- Now take it out
- My hand is fine

42
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,281
Didn't I say you will be fine?

43
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:35,357
Move aside

44
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:37,974
Look who's here

45
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,655
This trick is done with
the juice of a lemon

46
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,670
- Just a tiny lemon
- Lemon juice boils faster than oil

47
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,864
You think it's oil but it's not

48
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,716
Each and every belief is a bubble

49
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,563
I've written a new book
that exposes such lies

50
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:56,654
'God as a businessman'

51
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,342
Only Rs. 100 per copy

52
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,214
So this is another business

53
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,722
(Lijo screaming)

54
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,781
You put your hand into it again?
Blow at it

55
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,576
Silence

56
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,619
If anyone comes up to you with such tricks

57
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,126
Will you take him for God?

58
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,116
What do we learn from this?

59
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,876
Man can't be God, can he?

60
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,713
Now you tell me

61
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,395
Does God exist?

62
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:24,133
- Come on, tell me
- Yes

63
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,266
Does God exist?

64
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,582
Yes, God exists

65
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,817
(mocks) So God exists

66
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,074
How can you be sure?

67
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,880
If you ask me God exists or not

68
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,700
Maybe there is a God, maashe

69
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,024
Why don't you prove that
there is no God, maashe?

70
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:43,049
How can I prove something
that doesn't exist?

71
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:45,039
The future generation is promising

72
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,736
Okay, you tell me

73
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,650
Is it God who looks after us?

74
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,586
Maashe, God is all-powerful

75
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,883
God can do anything but can we?

76
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:57,224
- That boy is smart
- Did you drown in alcohol?

77
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,043
So this is what you think

78
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:01,933
That God is everywhere and can do anything

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,143
Let's see how

80
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,909
I will give your God three minutes

81
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:10,934
It's a simple challenge

82
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:12,655
Make me sneeze

83
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:13,821
(man chuckling)

84
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,341
Can your God do that?

85
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:17,919
Within three minutes

86
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
Oh God

87
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,620
Will God get a trophy for
this sneezing contest?

88
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:28,759
- This man is nuts
- Is he really a teacher?

89
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,567
He will mislead these children
Let's go

90
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:33,454
Friends, we are about to
witness a contest against God

91
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:38,303
You are watching a tough
sneezing contest between God

92
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:42,068
and C.S. Ullaaskumar maashu, the
stalwart of Kerala Rationalists' Movement

93
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,262
The rival is a fighter
C.S. Ullaaskumar maashu

94
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,861
Did he have steamed cake today?
See how he is letting off steam

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,783
Maashu is holding his breath and
dignity at the cost of his life

96
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,697
These are unpredictable moments, friends

97
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,966
The rival is a fighter
C.S. Ullaaskumar maashu

98
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:02,523
We are moving on to the last
minutes of the contest against God

99
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,180
This will be over in 10 seconds

100
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,562
Oh God make him sneeze

101
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,452
Save your face, God

102
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:11,481
Will Ullaaskumar maashu win?

103
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,596
God this is your last
chance to prove yourself

104
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:17,995
And that's the end of three minutes
Oh God, Ullaaskumar maashu has won

105
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,078
See, it's as simple as that

106
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:24,265
Maashe

107
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:26,942
- Hats off to you, maashe
- Thank you

108
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,884
(both sneezing)

109
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,359
Hey Vaavaachi

110
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,726
Did you have a bath?

111
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,323
No, I didn't drink, I'm sober

112
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,628
I asked if you had had a bath not a drink

113
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,198
Hey, make sure that your
feet don't touch the water

114
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,567
I'll have to jump in for that

115
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:17,999
Amma (mother)

116
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,184
- Tea
- I'm coming

117
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,080
Fix that motor quickly

118
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,861
Ullaas hasn't had his tea

119
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,869
And without tea he can't
have his newspaper

120
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,180
- Amma, where's my tea?
- In a moment

121
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,628
Couldn't you find anybody
else to repair the motor?

122
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:48,024
What's wrong with him?

123
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:49,781
Everything about him is wrong

124
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,578
Just sit there and gulp
down your newspaper

125
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,018
Oh no

126
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:14,210
Hey Ullaasa

127
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:16,527
Come quickly (whimpering)

128
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,012
You have polluted my water
you good-for-nothing

129
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,968
- Pull him out
- Don't shake the rope

130
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,303
Yes, here he is

131
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,170
Red salute comrade

132
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,717
- Red salute indeed
- He deserves it

133
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,092
Have they started?

134
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,979
Come on give your share

135
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,236
Kuttan aashaari, it's our programme
Where's your share?

136
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,110
- Go trouble somebody else
- What's the hurry?

137
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:49,847
Hey Eagle

138
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,743
Why don't you leave your black tea
and show us some moves?

139
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:54,898
- I'm taking a break
- I'll check out the stage

140
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,056
Come on everybody
put your share in this bucket

141
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,714
Sister, comrade
Let's go over there

142
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:09,465
Lift it up

143
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,980
- Careful
- Stop that

144
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,275
Stop

145
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,150
What's this?

146
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:15,453
Onam (a festival)

147
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,945
- Didn't we agree on harvest festival?
- Yes

148
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,631
But the public should
know what it is

149
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,683
- That's true
- We've not written Vamana Jayanthi

150
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,770
It's just Onam

151
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,167
This won't work

152
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:28,325
- This will give out the wrong message
- Maashe, it's already been printed

153
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,919
- Just let it be
- That's impossible

154
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,136
You read the minutes
from the 10th committee

155
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,650
Comrade, we discussed
and agreed to it

156
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:36,978
I'll not allow this on stage

157
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
You see

158
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,063
We should be alert on all
matters related to our party

159
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,323
In a similar situation, the great Lenin

160
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:48,018
- Hey, take it away
- This happened during their Onam too

161
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,153
- Their Onam?
- Of course

162
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,739
- Oh
- Yes I know all about it

163
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,044
It's one thing to talk
about changing the world

164
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:56,526
Thanks to some of us who recite
Ramayana and celebrate festivals

165
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:57,924
we are still here or else...

166
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,346
This is the only place
where it's left to bloom

167
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,365
Who cares if it blooms or withers
Take it away right now

168
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,069
- What's it?
- Hey Vaavaachi

169
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:09,968
Go away, you

170
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:15,912
Don't worry Nambiar chetta (brother)
You can use the flex for your chicken coop

171
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:17,450
Hey Kanna, give me the matchbox

172
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,863
That Ullaas is so full of himself

173
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,756
What's the point saying
what he did in the past?

174
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,069
He is not an office-bearer
of the party anymore

175
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,248
Nambiar chetta

176
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,449
Is the word bullet written
anywhere on this bike?

177
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:32,823
It's not

178
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:35,085
But when it runs and
makes that thumping sound

179
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,085
everybody knows that it's bullet

180
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,745
That's the thing about Ullaas maashu

181
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,886
For us Ullaas maashu is the party

182
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:42,704
- Isn't it so?
- Of course

183
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,625
Those who took tickets for
Chekkunnu can get off here

184
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,335
For Chekkunnu, please get off here

185
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,110
Make it fast

186
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,701
Mambaram, Koothuparambu
Kathiroor, Thalasherry

187
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,015
Make it fast
Alright, let's move

188
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:11,943
Let's go

189
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,649
Hello

190
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,087
Friends

191
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:21,501
Sorry, comrades

192
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,177
Mike testing

193
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,007
- How's that?
- Switch it off

194
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,071
Oh my God

195
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,998
Jeni I'm fed up with you

196
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:48,676
Why don't you sit
quietly for sometime?

197
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:50,270
(child weeping)

198
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,235
When the whole village
is celebrating Onam

199
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,353
I'm stuck with this stupid sewing

200
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,764
(child weeping)

201
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,319
Oops!

202
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:00,527
Are you hurt?

203
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,507
Stop crying

204
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,560
Aren't you amma's sweetheart?

205
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,943
(woman soothing the child)

206
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:07,670
Stop crying dear

207
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,755
- Vaavaachi will come soon
- Oh yes, he will

208
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,535
You can watch when he arrives on all fours

209
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,320
- Since it's Onam, it will be worse
- Vaavaachi will be here now

210
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,458
Are you coming?

211
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,186
Our people are taking
out a procession

212
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,694
One more person will add to our strength

213
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,637
Come along, your Vaavaachi will be late

214
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,028
I'm not coming, chechi (sister)

215
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:30,925
What will I do with this
child who can't see?

216
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,245
Anyway, Kannettan doesn't like such
caste programmes

217
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:38,503
Your beloved Kannettan
Does he even care about you?

218
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,362
It's because our people
do not stand together

219
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,378
that there are people like him who will
kill and die for the party

220
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,537
I'll keep my mouth shut

221
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,537
Don't worry about it

222
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:54,148
- If you are not coming, it's fine
- Where's that rooster?

223
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,647
I don't know

224
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:57,958
Stop playing with your birds, man

225
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,903
- Are you coming or not?
- Come, let's go

226
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,530
Goodbye, little girl

227
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:05,944
Now play with the child

228
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,405
- Why doesn't she join us?
- Now you are asking for it, man

229
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,190
Hello

230
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,573
We couldn't get Guru

231
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,287
Nobody is willing to shave their hair

232
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,955
- Children, be careful
- I'll call you

233
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,702
Next up is the prize distribution ceremony

234
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:36,999
Onam...

235
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:40,544
Sorry, harvest festival

236
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:42,263
Am I right?

237
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,920
Our MLA will distribute the prizes
for the winners of the events

238
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,087
held as part of the harvest festival

239
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,359
When we call your names

240
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:53,275

241

Go get it

248
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,643
We don't touch feet here

249
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,850
Inviting the captain of
Oruma team Bhagyasuyam

250
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:22,538
to receive the first prize for
kaikottikali (dance form) contest

251
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:25,537
Kindly pay attention

252
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:28,515
We are here to give out
the prize for kaikottikali

253
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,368
- Hello
- Thank you

254
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,444
- Yay
- Yay (fumbles)

255
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,154
Can I click a selfie with you?

256
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,105
- Thank you
- Second prize in kaikottikali contest

257
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,327
Nanma team captain Latha Suresh

258
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:53,313
A millet plant in your yard

259
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,938
And a millet plant in mine

260
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,314
Bhagavathy (Goddess)

261
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,995
Have you closed the temple doors to me?

262
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,689
But my nightly offering is here

263
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,197
Su...

264
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,258
Su...

265
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,940
In that house yonder lives
a girl who loves me madly

266
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:26,183
Her beauty is so, she’ll beat
the yellow bird verily

267
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:31,270
The moonlit sky is naught
when her face shines brightly

268
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,139
Su...

269
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:39,341
Silence

270
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,246
Pappadum

271
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:43,925
Break and mix

272
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,790
You seem to be walking on air

273
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:56,064
It's your payasam (desert)
that made me high

274
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:10,153
Behold me not with those eyes, miss

275
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:14,701
And, hey, taunt me not with your smiles

276
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,798
This feeling, for you, I feel

277
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:23,267
I can't name nor conceal

278
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:27,173
(folksong refrain)

279
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,320
(folksong refrain)

280
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,498
(folksong refrain)

281
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,209
(folksong refrain)

282
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,962
What's gotten into you?

283
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,572
Nowadays, you drink everyday

284
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:43,684
Not just drinking, Su

285
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:45,947
but my love for you

286
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,439
is also greater these days

287
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:52,398
(folksong refrain)

288
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,187
(folksong refrain)

289
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,110
The bus will be here soon

290
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,610
Yes it will

291
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:08,193
She isn't paying you to carry those
clothes back and forth

292
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:09,526
Is she?

293
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,360
She is struggling to support her family
So I do what I can to help her

294
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,151
And here you want a
commission for a favour

295
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:31,985
Kuttan aashaari

296
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:33,568
Over here

297
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:34,901
Let me see you

298
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,568
You disappeared after you
came home to keep your tools

299
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,568
And you show up now?

300
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,776
I don't go to work anymore

301
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:45,651
I'm not feeling well these days

302
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,651
In fact I'm planning to retire

303
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:49,776
Of course you can retire

304
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,526
Since this poor girl works
to look after the family

305
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:54,776
Is that why you are
not marrying her off?

306
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,443
I want to see her married
but she doesn't listen to me

307
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,776
Why don't you get married, miss?

308
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,943
If you don't get married on time
you may end up with the wrong man

309
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,193
- Chekkunnu
- The bus is here

310
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,276
- She hasn't come yet
- Don't worry about her

311
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,776
- Bhagyechi
- I thought you won't make it in time

312
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,735
- Have you got them all?
- Yes I have

313
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:21,860
Get in

314
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,526
- I will give the remaining ones next week
- Okay

315
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,110
'Women'

316
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:32,526
You stand there

317
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:34,276
Let's see

318
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:39,985
Do it properly

319
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,526
Ready one, two, three, start

320
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:53,735
Hello everyone

321
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,151
Over here

322
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,151
Listen up

323
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,776
- Was that a joke?
- No

324
00:23:02,985 --> 00:23:04,776
We are cancelling the
annual day celebrations

325
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,568
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes

326
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:11,443
Sebastian maashu of Chekkunnu school
was invited to felicitate this function

327
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:14,276
But that wayward has
attacked him in school

328
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,443
He is in co-operative
hospital with a head injury

329
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:20,985
So our institute should not go
ahead with the celebrations

330
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,110
Do you get it?

331
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,568
Tell him

332
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:26,151
Go

333
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:28,193
Maashe

334
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,776
But we have done our makeup

335
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,360
How can you cancel it now?

336
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,068
There is no change in my decision

337
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:37,193
Do you want to dance when
a man is seriously injured?

338
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,901
But it's your party member
who attacked him

339
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:45,735
You are crossing your limits

340
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:48,318
Ullaas maashe

341
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:50,068
Sorry maashe

342
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,443
Maashe

343
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,901
Come

344
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,526
Maashe, it has been decided that

345
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,443
the lad will not be
handed over to police

346
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,735
Then?

347
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:17,776
Vaavaachi Kannan hit maashu
with the school's bell hammer

348
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:20,693
He did it in school today
Who knows what he will do tomorrow

349
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,901
Maashe, if we hand him over to the police

350
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,526
they will beat him to pulp

351
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:26,526
You just follow what he says

352
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:27,985
That's the right thing to do

353
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,110
Maashe, let's discuss the matter

354
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,276
Maashe, stop there

355
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:43,276
God as...

356
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
God as businessman

357
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,360
- My fees
- Why so early?

358
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:49,985
So that you can't say I'm late

359
00:24:57,735 --> 00:25:00,193
Will you allow your son to burn my pyre?

360
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:05,943
I had dreamed of confessing my love to you
(poetry class)

361
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,735
But never once could I tell you, my love

362
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,276
(giggling)

363
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,193
- Silence
- I know indeed... (poetry class)

364
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,776
you want me to speak (poetry class)

365
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,360
I would like to clarify something

366
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:19,318
Men and women get attracted to each other

367
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,526
because of a natural phenomenon

368
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:24,568
At your age hormone
production is quite high

369
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:27,651
- Hence such tendencies are also greater
- Maashe, I...

370
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:28,985
Sit down

371
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:30,735
However

372
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,526
one should try to send
rational messages to the brain

373
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,985
and control such foolish thoughts

374
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,901
Otherwise you can
discontinue your studies here

375
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,485
Am I clear?

376
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:47,776
- Maashe
- Yes

377
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:52,193
If you had to say something to me
why not say it personally?

378
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,985
Why did you tell the whole class?

379
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:55,276
What do you think?

380
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,485
That C.S. Ullaaskumar is like the others

381
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,360
I don't know about the others

382
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,693
But...

383
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:01,776
Bhagyasuyam

384
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:04,735
You will...

385
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:06,485
Tomorrow

386
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,360
I would like to see
your father before class

387
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:22,485
Maashe

388
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,485
You wanted to see my father
about our wedding, right?

389
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:26,610
Here he is

390
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:35,068
Maashu wants to meet my father

391
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:37,776
Bhagyakuri (nickname), call your father

392
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,193
I will talk to him

393
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:41,776
Comrade Abu you don't
know what the matter is

394
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,193
I already know what it's all about

395
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,735
You know I have four kids

396
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:04,193
What are you up to?

397
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:05,568
Don't worry, maashe

398
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:07,276
I swear I didn't tell achan about us

399
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:09,276
What about us?

400
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:10,485
You know what

401
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,110
Why don't you look at me
when you take classes?

402
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,651
I...

403
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,151
There are so many tea stalls here

404
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,568
Why do you visit Dineshan's
tea stall every Saturday?

405
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,360
That too at the same time
I go to temple?

406
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:23,360
- Do you want more?
- Good job

407
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,526
Leave this to me now

408
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,485
Anyway I wanted to meet Kuttan aashaari

409
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,568
Why should you meet him?

410
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,985
Because I need to, maashe

411
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:36,110
I will present it before
the right committee

412
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:37,526
discuss it in stages

413
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,485
arrive at a rational decision

414
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:40,985
and inform you of the date and time

415
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,193
Until then you can play
this teacher-student game

416
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,360
Long live the revolution

417
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,776
I will teach you a lesson

418
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,776
Lazing over boughs of clouds

419
00:28:09,193 --> 00:28:10,485
Patting streaks of lightning

420
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,735
Pitter patter

421
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:13,693
Like pots cracking

422
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,776
The season brings
its virgin drops

423
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:19,568
The lone jasmine flower
in my garden

424
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:22,110
Yearns to be home

425
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:26,360
And spread its sweet bane

426
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:30,360
With our eyes closed

427
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,943
And our tongues tied

428
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,985
We love each other
Just so, my friend

429
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,318
The scent of frangipani

430
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:07,360
Scatters in the wind

431
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,193
As the wintry night
restlessly wakes

432
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,735
I will take wing

433
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:17,901
And hold you in my arms

434
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,985
I will be one with

435
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:23,443
The wind that gently glides

436
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,443
Do you see the playful moon

437
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:29,443
Teasing the shadows at night?

438
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:35,360
Do you hear me sing
my dear friend?

439
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,526
Lazing over boughs of clouds

440
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,151
Patting streaks of lightning

441
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:42,276
Pitter patter

442
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:43,776
Like pots cracking

443
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:46,193
The season brings
its virgin drops

444
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,318
The lone jasmine flower
in my garden

445
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,485
Yearns to be home

446
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,568
And spread its sweet bane

447
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,901
With our eyes closed

448
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,526
And our tongues tied

449
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:07,526
We love each other
Just so, my friend

450
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,318
Flowers drape and sway

451
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,443
With ripples in the waterway

452
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:48,276
Adding to the splendour
Of the first light of day

453
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:53,110
As you greet me at the doorway

454
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:58,776
I can't but embrace you
it's only fair, I say

455
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,526
Do you see the glow
of the new dawn

456
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,318
As it bids farewell
to the looming night?

457
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,731
Do you hear my heart beating
my dear friend?

458
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:11,582
- What are you doing?
- It's shaky

459
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:12,799
Your head?

460
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,068
Lazing over boughs of clouds

461
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,860
Patting streaks of lightning

462
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,110
Pitter patter

463
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,735
Like pots cracking

464
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,360
The season brings its virgin drops

465
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,985
The lone jasmine flower
in my garden

466
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:31,193
Yearns to be home

467
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,735
And spread its sweet bane

468
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,443
With our eyes closed

469
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:42,193
And our tongues tied

470
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:47,068
We loved each other
Just so, my friend

471
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,985
Fetch me a stick
Yes, a stick

472
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,110
For a snake lies in my way

473
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:53,776
Yes, a snake lies in my way

474
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:56,735
Neither elephant yam
nor elephant ear

475
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,735
A venomous viper I fear

476
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Yes, a venomous viper

477
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:02,360
A venomous viper

478
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:03,651
Can you come over here?

479
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,776
Ullaas maashu is here to speak with her

480
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,943
Karthikeyan master's elder girl Kaathu...
(song tapers off)

481
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,485
It's better you come
before I lose my cool

482
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,985
Why didn't you invite him in?

483
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:25,276
I have a few conditions

484
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,526
First of all

485
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:31,693
I won't wear a white shirt for my wedding

486
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,568
I will wear a blue shirt

487
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:35,568
Is that why you came now, maashe?

488
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,360
You can wear whatever you like

489
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:38,776
But please come dressed

490
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,193
Do you have any other condition?

491
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,943
Bhagyam shouldn't wear a saree

492
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,568
You should wear this churidar

493
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,360
No, that's not right

494
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,985
People will say things if
the bride is not in saree

495
00:32:57,235 --> 00:33:00,276
Our volunteers will make sure
nobody says a word about it

496
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:03,985
We should set an example
against customs

497
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:05,443
Who is this sage?

498
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,943
He is a philosopher, the guard and
guardian of the Kerala rationalist society

499
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:13,151
Owner of Therali
publications Mr.Therali

500
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:15,568
Veerali sir

501
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:17,860
Sorry, Veerali sir

502
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,901
But my daughter will wear
saree for her wedding

503
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,568
Amma, I'm okay with it

504
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:24,360
I will wear churidar

505
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:26,193
It's so sad, maashe

506
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,235
Why do you place such
conditions before us?

507
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:31,776
If she were from your community
will you tell her so on wedding eve?

508
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,776
- It's not...
- No sister, you're mistaken

509
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:38,776
Our time demands that this
wedding be held in this manner

510
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,485
So it's not your demand?

511
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,276
Acha, maashu will have his own plan

512
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,110
But his plan is pointless

513
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,693
Any other condition?

514
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:51,693
Like the bride's father
should wear shorts?

515
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:57,401
We can't have the sacred
thread tying ceremony

516
00:33:57,943 --> 00:33:59,485
- Oh my Muthappa (a Hindu deity)
- Amma

517
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,985
Maashe, there are certain
customs that we need to follow

518
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,360
There will be no sacred thread
ceremony or lighting of lamp

519
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:06,985
It's been discussed and finalised

520
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:08,651
It's in the minutes too

521
00:34:08,985 --> 00:34:10,276
What if we don't agree to it?

522
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Acha

523
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:14,110
We will do as you say, maashe
Please leave now

524
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,360
Our neighbours are watching

525
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,443
What do you mean?

526
00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:20,068
Maashe, we maybe from
a different community

527
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,776
But we are a respectable family

528
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,276
I have publicly spoken
against such customs

529
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,318
If I don't follow them
I will have a face to fix

530
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:27,776
Maashe please leave

531
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,110
I will talk to my parents

532
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:34,860
- Shall we go?
- Okay maashe

533
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:39,276
There are so many able men in our
village but she fell for this man

534
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:41,776
It would have been better
if you'd run away with him

535
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,985
My Muthappa, how will I face the guests?

536
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:58,485
I will hit 75 this April

537
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,360
This is the first time

538
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:04,068
that Chekkunnu will witness
a wedding of our kind

539
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:08,443
This will be a bolt from the blue
for the people of Chekkunnu

540
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:09,985
Let's go

541
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:16,485
Ullaas, your shirt...

542
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,193
Is it okay?

543
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,985
It's not white, it's blue

544
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:22,860
Yes it's blue

545
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:26,318
But it appears white from a distance

546
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,776
Especially in the photos...

547
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,151
Sir, we have colour photos now
not black and white

548
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,193
Exactly

549
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,485
Oh no what's this?

550
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:46,651
Sarojini aunty

551
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,651
What is she wearing?

552
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:52,193
- Take Sathyan uncle's blessing
- May Muthappan bless you

553
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:53,985
What is she wearing?

554
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,860
Garland, betel leaf, coconut flower

555
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:58,276
- Hey, where is the lamp?
- I don't know

556
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,985
- Pangan uncle
- Kuttan, have you forgotten our customs?

557
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,568
Or did you invite us so that
you can mock them before us?

558
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,110
Pangan uncle, we wanted to
set an example to others

559
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,068
Pangan uncle, we...

560
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:12,193
This is what the bridegroom's party wanted

561
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:15,860
If you are doing everything their way
then why did you invite us?

562
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,276
They can be the only guests

563
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:21,068
Can't you light a lamp so that the sacred
thread can be tied with fire as witness?

564
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,360
Hey Appu, bring the lamp and light it up

565
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:26,860
Let's see what will happen

566
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,568
Uncle, let's not do it

567
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:30,776
Why not?

568
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,360
We should have avoided traditional music

569
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:38,360
This marriage calls
for some exciting music

570
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:39,651
What are you wearing?

571
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,735
You managed to hijack
maashu, right?

572
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:47,651
Maashe, you would look hip
with a pair of sunglasses

573
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:50,568
- You are a joke, maashe
- Ullaas

574
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:51,776
What is that?

575
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,360
Who gave you permission
to light a lamp?

576
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,276
I asked myself before I lighted the lamp

577
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,568
I'm Kuttan's only uncle

578
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,276
Do you have a problem with it?

579
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:12,526
Hey get rid of that lamp

580
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:16,110
I swear by Muthappan if you dare touch
my lamp there will be a bloodbath

581
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,318
Then I will also shed some blood

582
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:20,443
Take care of him

583
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,360
Why are you after me?

584
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,276
Maashe please don't

585
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,943
Stay away you fake

586
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,193
Maashe

587
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,901
Acha

588
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:38,776
Stop it

589
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,276
- Acha
- Oh my God

590
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:49,026
You should have told me that
you were not interested in me

591
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,276
Why humiliate me like this?

592
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,985
Bhagyam, we had decided
that we won't have a lamp

593
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,318
Are you with these people?

594
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,151
I dressed up in this way for you

595
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,526
It's just a lamp, maashe

596
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,651
Can't you do this for me?

597
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,151
I realise it now

598
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,443
Great men like you should
never marry silly girls like me

599
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,151
Nobody has to put up
with it for my sake

600
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:11,776
Acha

601
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,360
I don't want to get married, acha

602
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:18,318
My poor child

603
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,110
Don't worry, Ullaaskumar

604
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,860
I will marry my daughter to you

605
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,068
- (curses)
- Sister

606
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:36,110
How dare you after breaking
off my son's wedding

607
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:37,318
Come with me

608
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,360
You come dressed up like a clown

609
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,526
You will have to pay for that girl's tears

610
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:48,651
Those who took tickets
to Caltex come forward

611
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Get down

612
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:52,735
Chechi, make it quick

613
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,110
Get in

614
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:59,151
Close that door

615
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:00,485
Let's go

616
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:06,110
Come, have your fill

617
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,360
Kanna

618
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:10,776
Kanna

619
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,985
The water supply has been
disrupted for two days

620
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
- Hey Kanna
- Yes

621
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,860
We have tools and stuff there
You just come with me

622
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,193
- Wait man
- Hello little girl

623
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,735
Bhagavathy...

624
00:39:31,776 --> 00:39:33,651
Acha, my goodbye kiss

625
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,443
Daddy's darling

626
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,110
Achan will be...

627
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:41,651
Oh no, this is not how you put it on

628
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,651
Stop playing with the kid and come along
They are waiting for you

629
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:45,943
My little princess

630
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:50,360
Let's go

631
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,651
Quick or she will start quizzing

632
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,693
Mohana

633
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,776
This is not our territory

634
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:07,360
- Is it okay?
- Be cool, man

635
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:10,943
What happens when you have a drink, Kanna?

636
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,360
It makes you light in the head, Kanna

637
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:17,985
(humming a song)

638
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,568
They told me they will be here

639
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:22,693
Yes, here they are

640
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,443
Hey Mohana

641
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:40,943
Move

642
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,360
Chop him up

643
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,985
- Hack him to death
- Go after him

644
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,110
- This way
- Hey

645
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,985
Hey, don't let him get away

646
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:48,860
Catch him

647
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:57,526
Stop you

648
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,943
La ilaha illa Allah
(Arabic - There is no deity but God)

649
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,568
La ilaha illa Allah

650
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,318
La ilaha illa Allah

651
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:51,943
Hey what's the matter?

652
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,360
- What are you doing here?
- Hey you

653
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:55,860
Go away

654
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:57,693
Bloody drunkard

655
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,360
La ilaha illa Allah

656
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,151
La ilaha illa Allah

657
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,901
La ilaha illa Allah

658
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:07,526
Stop there

659
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,651
Hey you

660
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,860
Don't let him go

661
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,276
La ilaha illa Allah (tapers)

662
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:31,526
You come to the police station
at 10 a.m. tomorrow

663
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:32,568
Okay sir

664
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:34,151
Hey who is that?

665
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:35,735
Get him out

666
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:39,193
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

667
00:42:39,485 --> 00:42:40,485
Get out you...

668
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,651
I said get out

669
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:43,193
Get in

670
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:58,854
Comrade, this can't be allowed anymore

671
00:42:59,101 --> 00:43:01,232
If we keep helping him out
he will create more trouble

672
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,150
Suma

673
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,545
LC secretary will not help him this time
You can leave

674
00:43:05,862 --> 00:43:07,069
Maashe, please don't say that

675
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,917
Knowing Kannettan, there will be more
trouble if he is not out soon

676
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,285
- What trouble?
- He might...

677
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,018
I'm afraid he might say
something to annoy the police

678
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:15,198
That's true

679
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,218
If he talks, the police will thrash
him even if they don't want to do it

680
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,793
Please maashe

681
00:43:19,906 --> 00:43:21,334
Let comrade make the call

682
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,335
Last time the police caught
him they beat him to a pulp

683
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:26,038
Now he is always sick

684
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,820
He even takes medicine every night

685
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:31,566
No comrade

686
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,098
We can't indulge him anymore

687
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,520
Let him remain locked up for a day

688
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,308
Don't interfere, comrade

689
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,308
My dear maashe, stop saying that

690
00:43:41,344 --> 00:43:43,008
Suma, think logically

691
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,224
He knows that we will help him

692
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,551
That's why he is always
getting himself into trouble

693
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:52,130
It's better he remains in jail at least
until his head is clear

694
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,075
Hello Chekkunnu station

695
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:10,309
You will see sir smiling at me now

696
00:44:10,702 --> 00:44:12,709
I was wondering why you hadn't called

697
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,488
- See that
- I'll release him right now

698
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,159
No, you don't have to come

699
00:44:21,753 --> 00:44:22,948
Hey get up

700
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:24,665
He is sitting on my lungi

701
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,367
(in Hindi) It's my party

702
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:28,504
(in Hindi) So what?

703
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:30,199
- Hey Suresh
- Yes, sir

704
00:44:30,308 --> 00:44:32,409
Who is Seethisahib's help Buddhadeb?

705
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:34,692
- He is sitting on the floor
- (in Hindi) That's me, sir

706
00:44:38,336 --> 00:44:39,641
- Buddhadeb?
- (in Hindi) Yes sir

707
00:44:39,736 --> 00:44:41,236
(in Hindi) You can go home

708
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:42,642
(in Hindi) Thank you, sir

709
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:54,821
Nobody will call about your release

710
00:44:55,314 --> 00:44:56,736
They don't need you anymore

711
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:13,814
Enhance the colour and
length of that bindi

712
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:15,742
Is that enough?

713
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:17,361
- Okay right?
- Yes that's good

714
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:20,157
It started with missed calls

715
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,407
Then he sent good morning
messages to my WhatsApp

716
00:45:22,728 --> 00:45:24,845
When I got good night messages
I blocked his number

717
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:27,732
Now I don't dare open my Facebook, comrade

718
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,732
Would you care to see the
photo he sent me last night?

719
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:32,717
What are you saying, chechi?

720
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:34,291
I don't have Facebook

721
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:36,095
I sold my phone with Facebook last month

722
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:41,267
Is Facebook your holy book that you
need to recite daily?

723
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,168
What is the merit in this complaint?

724
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,296
Sujatha, do one thing

725
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,522
Write a complaint in this paper and
give it at Chekkunnu police station

726
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,728
This is cyber case

727
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:52,638
If proven you will be
jailed for three years

728
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:53,703
Maashe

729
00:45:53,977 --> 00:45:54,977
Suja chechi

730
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,950
No matter who did this to you
I apologise on his behalf

731
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,403
Moreover we have no complaint here

732
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:02,882
I'll make sure that nobody
sends any message

733
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,679
not even a red salute to your phone

734
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,990
Hey you

735
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:07,862
Do you know what the great Lenin said

736
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:11,809
about the importance of morality
in a communist's life?

737
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,942
- This Lenin is such a pain in the neck
- Eh?

738
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:15,926
I said sorry and if you
want I can apologise

739
00:46:16,286 --> 00:46:17,286
Hoy

740
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:18,944
It's me, Vaavaachi

741
00:46:19,248 --> 00:46:22,217
Who wants to put Vaavaachi in jail?

742
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,284
Come outside and face me

743
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,002
- Who's that shouting?
- It's Vaavaachi

744
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:27,577
- He is up to something
- Hey Vaavaachi

745
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:29,423
Be off or I'll forget
you were a party person

746
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:31,164
- I were a party person?
- Why of course?

747
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,350
Who the hell are you to decide that?

748
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:36,029
- (men shouting)
- He's impossible

749
00:46:36,116 --> 00:46:37,842
- Don't cause trouble
- Vaavaachi, leave him

750
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,706
(several men shouting)

751
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:42,581
- Hey, stop that
- Stop

752
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:44,118
- Move aside
- Move

753
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:46,751
So Vaavaachi is an outsider now?

754
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,826
What do you get by freeing
such useless fellows from jail?

755
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,275
Kanna, you attacked that policeman
because our party is in power

756
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,002
Do you know what really happened?

757
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,483
- Don't speak without knowing the truth
- What truth?

758
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:01,228
You get drunk and ruin
the party's reputation

759
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:02,269
Maashe, you...

760
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,992
Kanna, back off

761
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:06,982
This man has always had a problem with me

762
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:10,821
Don't you dare listen
to him and mess with me

763
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,204
I'll be forced to
tell a story from the past

764
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:14,361
I'll tell the whole world

765
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:15,889
- How about that?
- Just say it then

766
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,446
- (men shouting)
- Be quiet

767
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,801
Maashe, you leave now
I need to talk to Kannan

768
00:47:21,163 --> 00:47:22,363
Go away, everybody

769
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:24,061
- Maashe, he...
- Go

770
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,295
You visited him in jail, didn't you?

771
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:59,038
- He went to jail instead of me
- Yes, he did

772
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:01,105
You do know that

773
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:05,413
The party protected you because
your wife was pregnant

774
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:07,393
But what for?

775
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,880
Who loses if you ruin
your life drinking?

776
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:14,028
- I lose
- No

777
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,561
It's my loss

778
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:17,358
It's the party's loss

779
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:21,058
I'm sure you know what is
at stake but you don't care

780
00:48:23,246 --> 00:48:24,269
Yes, I have killed a man

781
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,399
- But not for myself
- Then?

782
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:29,720
Did the party ask you to do it?

783
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:32,358
Nobody told me to do it

784
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:35,693
What else could I have done when
they hacked Chandrettan before me?

785
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,872
I stabbed one of them with what I had

786
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,493
And I don't regret it to this day

787
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,353
Though...

788
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:46,549
I got away with it

789
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:50,447
my daughter paid for it

790
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:55,657
Kanna

791
00:48:56,072 --> 00:48:57,853
The court doesn't know who the culprit is

792
00:48:58,557 --> 00:48:59,557
But they know

793
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,053
They know it's you

794
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:03,134
Be careful

795
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,202
Su...

796
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:47,665
My dearest Su...

797
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:50,282
Come here

798
00:49:50,986 --> 00:49:54,806
So this is where you are
What brings you here today?

799
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:56,368
(Vaavaachi howls)

800
00:49:58,573 --> 00:49:59,892
- Su
- Come

801
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:03,088
(mumbles) I tripped over my sandals

802
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:08,480
Kannamma, Kannamma, what's in your dish?

803
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:11,175
Crow's meat, toddy and fish

804
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:16,765
- La la la la la la
- Hey Vaavaachi

805
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:20,039
Save your health for our sake
We have work to do on it

806
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:21,445
(Vaavaachi hollers)

807
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:25,066
Am I some unfinished house
that you want to work on me?

808
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:26,551
Kannetta, stop it

809
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:28,133
Come on if you dare

810
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:30,704
- Come and get me
- Kannetta, let's go

811
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,728
- Come on
- Leave it

812
00:50:34,002 --> 00:50:36,415
We are coming to get you
Just wait

813
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:38,673
Let's go now

814
00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:50,679
Here's black tea

815
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:57,124
They serve puffs everywhere
but we still get dal vada

816
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,287
- Can we at least change this?
- So comrades

817
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:02,905
There is another issue we need to
discuss before we leave

818
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,382
Our member comrade Remya

819
00:51:05,776 --> 00:51:07,393
She saw a strange sight at the temple

820
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:09,179
Tell them yourself

821
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:11,502
Would you care to hear?

822
00:51:12,187 --> 00:51:15,296
That Vaavaachi Kannan was lying
stark-naked in the temple yard

823
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:16,798
- Fool
- He is right

824
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:18,889
The temple committee
was about to call the police

825
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:22,590
But I managed to pacify them
Then he started swearing at me

826
00:51:23,364 --> 00:51:24,676
I felt so insulted

827
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,770
He knows that the party will
save him no matter what

828
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,791
He has started issuing threats

829
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:34,361
Earlier only journalists bothered us

830
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:36,824
Now we have to be wary of
trollers and their mobiles

831
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:39,004
They are finding new
ways to defame the party

832
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:42,702
- So we should stop helping him
- Yes

833
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,741
We should expel people like him
for the sake of our party

834
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:47,663
- Very true
- That's right

835
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,202
But we have to discuss it

836
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,470
Let's assume that we discussed it

837
00:51:51,658 --> 00:51:53,853
It's only a matter of adding
four lines to the minutes

838
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:55,068
No

839
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:57,987
I object to expelling him

840
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,279
Maashe, don't oppose for the sake of it

841
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:04,214
We know that you don't like him

842
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:06,409
Is it because I suggested it?

843
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,541
Is that why you oppose?

844
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:10,069
I don't take a stand
based on who says what

845
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,085
I had presented the same thing at
the same committee many years back

846
00:52:15,107 --> 00:52:16,700
At that time everybody pampered him

847
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,593
Now you want to get rid of him
because he is not useful anymore

848
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:24,520
It is Ravi Nambiar's opinion

849
00:52:24,998 --> 00:52:26,027
Not our decision

850
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:28,514
If maashu has a different
opinion we will discuss it

851
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:30,621
Why discuss the matter at all?

852
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:32,103
He wasn't so bad earlier

853
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:34,204
But these days he drinks nonstop

854
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,331
I think that the party should
take charge of reforming him

855
00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:41,376
Of course Ullaas maashu
himself can take charge

856
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:42,985
You are the right person for the job

857
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:45,135
Maashu, you are the change
maker of this village

858
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:50,344
That's fine

859
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:52,234
But reforming a man

860
00:52:52,844 --> 00:52:54,640
is the collective duty of a society

861
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:56,874
The society is with you, isn't it?

862
00:52:57,137 --> 00:52:58,450
- Certainly
- Problem solved

863
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:01,145
However, Ullaas maashu
has to lead us

864
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:05,284
So I think that the responsibility
of helping comrade Kannan

865
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:09,502
to stop drinking and become a better man
should be given to Ullaas maashu

866
00:53:10,327 --> 00:53:12,725
- Any objection?
- No

867
00:53:12,945 --> 00:53:14,343
Let's applaud and approve it

868
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:19,949
I'm with Nambiar on this

869
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:25,403
If there is anyone whom Kannan
looks up to in Chekkunnu it's you

870
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:28,009
Take it up as a challenge

871
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:29,912
That family needs your help

872
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:44,608
How to stop alcohol drinking?

873
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:48,371
Ten ways to stop...

874
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:01,846
Maashe, sorry

875
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:05,028
I just wanted to prepare
some notes on the way

876
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,037
- Don't show your notes to anyone
- But...

877
00:54:17,677 --> 00:54:19,451
Here is your card
Let's go inside

878
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:20,568
Token number 16

879
00:54:20,951 --> 00:54:22,779
You may go in when they call your name

880
00:54:24,271 --> 00:54:25,288
Why are you here, amma?

881
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:27,679
You care about others so much

882
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:29,179
I'm growing old too

883
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:31,892
But you don't have time for me

884
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:33,470
You can't go in without a token

885
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:36,087
I managed to get a
token with some help

886
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:37,712
Token indeed

887
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,592
It's a kind of tumour in the eyes

888
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,209
A single surgery won't work
it may need two or three

889
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:52,793
What if we do it, doctor?

890
00:54:53,442 --> 00:54:55,831
It has to be done so that
your child gets to see again

891
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,106
Does it need a lot of money?

892
00:54:58,735 --> 00:55:00,762
Yes, it's expensive as well as risky

893
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,455
But that shouldn't discourage you

894
00:55:03,557 --> 00:55:04,869
We should take a chance

895
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,360
Think about it

896
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:09,270
My number is in this
file so you can call me

897
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,848
Okay

898
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,416
- Next
- Token number 24

899
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,099
- This will be on till 4 pm
- Did you hear what doctor said?

900
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,061
- Hold this
- We will be over there

901
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:20,412
- Shall we go home now?
- Suma

902
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,719
Suma, wait

903
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:25,482
- I need to talk to you
- Yes maashe

904
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,489
It's about Vaavaachi

905
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:29,583
He needs to stop drinking

906
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:32,822
Shivankunnu, Shivankunnu
Shinkunnu, Shinkunnu

907
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:34,469
Chekkunnu
Do you get it?

908
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:35,924
That's how Chekkunnu got its name

909
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:39,475
They called it Shinkunnu instead of
Shivankunnu and it became Chekkunnu

910
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:43,553
I realised it when I
heard the teacher's speech

911
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,538
But my son says that it was
called Chekkunnu after Che's visit

912
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:47,903
Che who?

913
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,809
Ernesto, our Che Guevara

914
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:50,974
Ernesto Che Guevara

915
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,365
Maashe, if you want to help
please do as I tell you

916
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,467
If so we can get it done without
Kannettan's knowledge

917
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,848
Can you do it secretly?

918
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:05,340
I'll be in trouble if someone
comes to know about it

919
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:06,879
Are you sure?

920
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:09,673
Maashe, it works, that's why

921
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:12,113
You know Shobhanechi's army husband

922
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,877
She slyly gave this medicine to him

923
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:18,034
- Really?
- He still doesn't know anything about it

924
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:21,656
It's true, maashe

925
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:24,475
I can't travel that
far with my little girl

926
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,397
Maashe, please buy this
when you go to Kannur

927
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,945
Suma, drinking is a mental health problem

928
00:56:30,601 --> 00:56:32,312
- I've been studying it in detail
- Okay

929
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:33,797
Carry on with your study, maashe

930
00:56:34,187 --> 00:56:35,874
But for now please buy this

931
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:38,675
And don't tell anybody
that I asked you to buy it

932
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,820
If Kannettan comes to
know it will be of no use

933
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,257
It's just a medicine, maashe

934
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:50,085
It will stop with this

935
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:52,604
It will stop as if you turned it off
Take my word for it

936
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,218
That's the power of Alambu-No

937
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,461
Maashe, like you, I believe
that there is no God

938
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,952
God installed a nerve in our body so that

939
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:06,140
we lose control when we have ethyl alcohol

940
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,937
It means he is an
agent of liquor lobby

941
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:11,376
From ***** to ******

942
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:16,546
I have tested all kinds of alcohol
on my body to develop this medicine

943
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:30,608
I've cured many great men

944
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:35,266
Give it mixed with rice

945
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:37,564
It's totally odourless

946
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,205
So they won't know

947
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:40,994
But it's highly effective

948
00:57:41,502 --> 00:57:43,900
So they will throw up everything
that they have had

949
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:45,611
And if they throw up it has worked

950
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,857
Trust Dr. Kochaniyan

951
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,950
495

952
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:01,736
Suma

953
00:58:02,697 --> 00:58:03,697
Suma

954
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,194
Hi little one, it's maashu uncle

955
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:32,675
Where is your amma?

956
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:34,553
Amma went to fetch achan

957
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,546
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

958
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:37,675
I have my doll

959
00:58:40,912 --> 00:58:43,216
Did I just ask a blind child
if she is afraid of the dark?

960
00:58:44,014 --> 00:58:45,108
It's such an irrational...

961
00:59:14,994 --> 00:59:16,814
I'll give you, move away

962
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:28,023
Hello

963
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,140
Hello

964
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,860
I'm here at Ravi's place

965
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,436
Yes I'm here already

966
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,714
- Come soon
- (Vaavaachi singing)

967
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:39,307
You give him food and join us
Our president is here

968
00:59:39,544 --> 00:59:42,849
He wants us to enlist for the show of
strength at Thiruvananthapuram tomorrow

969
00:59:43,982 --> 00:59:45,182
A show of strength?

970
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:47,100
- How about this?
- Kannetta

971
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:49,701
- I wasn't talking to you
- Hey you, go home

972
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,088
- Get lost
- Stop it

973
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:52,698
How dare you insult me, you drunk

974
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,285
He has no love for his community

975
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,784
Some people think that we are less
in number like the lion-tailed macaque

976
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:00,060
Don't we need a medical college?

977
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:02,011
Will we get one if we go
to Thiruvananthapuram?

978
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:03,097
Yes we will

979
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,491
(Vaavaachi singing)

980
01:00:05,592 --> 01:00:06,616
Vaavaachi is home

981
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,795
Kannamma, Kannamma, what's in your dish?

982
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:11,470
Crow's meat, toddy and fish

983
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:13,540
- [Vaavaachi] My sandals
- Maashu

984
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:16,540
[Vaavaachi] It doesn't fit

985
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:20,876
(Vaavaachi singing)

986
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,373
Here's your Vaavaachi

987
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,036
Sit here

988
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:27,317
- Acha
- (playful sounds)

989
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:29,333
Acha's darling daughter

990
01:00:30,355 --> 01:00:32,566
(Vaavaachi's playful sounds)

991
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:34,307
I came to give this to you

992
01:00:34,379 --> 01:00:36,785
That woman came when I was about to leave

993
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:40,475
I'm so sorry to have bothered you

994
01:00:40,663 --> 01:00:42,272
- How will you...
- That's okay

995
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:44,280
Give it to him and put him to bed quickly

996
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,428
Shall I tell you about
the science behind it?

997
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:48,647
- Please maashe
- Alright

998
01:00:50,382 --> 01:00:52,694
- Kannetta
- (Vaavaachi's playful sounds)

999
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,611
That's enough

1000
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,639
Now quickly wipe yourself

1001
01:01:03,046 --> 01:01:04,491
Stop it, woman

1002
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:06,179
What's the hurry?

1003
01:01:06,672 --> 01:01:08,805
We are not going to bed so early

1004
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:13,498
I'm going to play with my dear
daughter for some more time

1005
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,995
Let's sit under the moonlight tonight

1006
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:22,638
- Jenimol...
- Moonlight?

1007
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:25,428
- Do you see your moonlight now?
- Su

1008
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:30,663
Hey Su

1009
01:01:30,945 --> 01:01:33,046
- You will pay for this
- Kannetta

1010
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,830
Sit there

1011
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:01,978
Come

1012
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:03,228
Get inside

1013
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:04,541
- Acha
- What's it?

1014
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,933
- Go inside
- Kannetta

1015
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:18,118
Come on

1016
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:19,610
- You get off
- Hey Vaavaachi

1017
01:02:19,941 --> 01:02:21,415
It's Biju, Eagle Biju

1018
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:23,509
Somebody is lying in wait for you here

1019
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,181
Go check over there

1020
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:27,095
- Come on
- Over there

1021
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:30,883
- I didn't mean to...
- Bring him here

1022
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:34,791
Ullaas maashu, it's you?

1023
01:02:35,275 --> 01:02:36,383
Oh my goodness

1024
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:40,260
When the president called me
I thought it was one of them

1025
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:41,659
That's why I came running

1026
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:44,324
This is unbelievable, maashe

1027
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,902
Suma, does maashu visit
you at this time everyday?

1028
01:02:50,286 --> 01:02:53,361
I guess morality doesn't
apply to you, maashe

1029
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:56,727
Can I explain?

1030
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,713
Have you no women in your community that
you exploit women from ours?

1031
01:02:59,779 --> 01:03:01,511
Please leave maashu alone
I told him to...

1032
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,113
I knew there was something between you

1033
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:06,621
This is what happens when
you get drunk and go astray

1034
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:07,938
Do you realise it now?

1035
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:10,820
Who knows who is the
father of this blind girl

1036
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:13,936
President, let's go

1037
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,208
Why hit the president
for your wife's mistake?

1038
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:17,591
Hit this man if you dare

1039
01:03:22,523 --> 01:03:24,218
Take your hands off maashu

1040
01:03:25,842 --> 01:03:26,842
Hands off

1041
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,432
I'll kill you

1042
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:33,173
I'll call when I need
moral police in my home

1043
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:34,472
Get out

1044
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,065
Go away

1045
01:03:36,871 --> 01:03:37,871
Go

1046
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:40,675
So you are also part of this deal

1047
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:42,267
What does he care?

1048
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:45,056
He is only after money so he
can drink to his heart's content

1049
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:49,611
(people screaming in fright)

1050
01:03:49,729 --> 01:03:51,504
- Get in and close the door
- Not me

1051
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:52,786
Please not me

1052
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:55,191
He has gone crazy

1053
01:03:58,546 --> 01:04:00,553
Kanna, please listen to me

1054
01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:02,381
Maashe, you better leave

1055
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:03,491
I'm losing my mind

1056
01:04:03,585 --> 01:04:06,475
- I don't know what I will do
- I don't care

1057
01:04:06,657 --> 01:04:08,065
Let me tell you what I want to say

1058
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:09,449
I don't want to hear anything

1059
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:13,156
I know my wife so don't teach me
You better leave now

1060
01:04:14,562 --> 01:04:15,962
Maashe please go away

1061
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,897
I'll tell Kannettan that
you came here to help us

1062
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:20,514
Maashe...

1063
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,154
Maashe

1064
01:04:28,716 --> 01:04:29,872
Forgive me, maashe

1065
01:04:50,294 --> 01:04:51,694
Maashe, is it in today's paper?

1066
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:00,134
Everybody thought he was a decent man

1067
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,854
You are lucky you didn't marry him

1068
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:08,894
Men who talk big always
turn out to be frauds

1069
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:13,574
I'm shocked to learn that
your friend Suma did this

1070
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:18,894
Aren't you ashamed to gossip
on an empty stomach?

1071
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:21,734
I know maashu and Suma very well

1072
01:05:22,254 --> 01:05:23,734
The party had given him a task

1073
01:05:23,934 --> 01:05:25,254
That's why maashu went there

1074
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:31,094
It's true that the party
assigned him a task

1075
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:35,054
But that doesn't answer why he hid
in the backyard of the house

1076
01:05:36,374 --> 01:05:40,294
Whatever it is, people say it is
because he is still single

1077
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:44,614
It's easy to silence your rival
by linking him to a woman

1078
01:05:44,814 --> 01:05:45,814
Isn't it so?

1079
01:05:47,094 --> 01:05:49,014
However, Ullaas maashu
has given an explanation

1080
01:05:49,254 --> 01:05:50,534
and it is totally satisfactory

1081
01:05:51,134 --> 01:05:52,854
So there will be no further enquiry

1082
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:54,454
Whether you like it or not

1083
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,814
everybody in Chekkunnu is talking about it

1084
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,494
They say that maashu opposed
Vaavaachi Kannan's dismissal

1085
01:06:00,614 --> 01:06:03,294
from the party because
of his affair with that woman

1086
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:06,814
I won't oppose Kannan's dismissal anymore

1087
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:08,934
You can do as you please

1088
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:10,214
I will say nothing

1089
01:06:11,974 --> 01:06:14,334
I have failed in my assignment

1090
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:17,174
Besides some of our party friends
have taken it the wrong way

1091
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:20,374
So I apologise to each and every one

1092
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:23,334
Somebody else can take responsibility

1093
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:29,574
In that case comrade Ravi can do it

1094
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,654
I don't have a problem

1095
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:33,414
But I will take a different approach

1096
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:36,054
- This is an unpolitical move
- Yes it is

1097
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:38,374
Alcoholism is not a political issue

1098
01:06:38,653 --> 01:06:39,974
It's a mental health problem

1099
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:43,094
- But is this the only way?
- Maybe there are other ways

1100
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:45,054
This is what I consider best

1101
01:06:45,774 --> 01:06:48,054
I can convince him to agree to it

1102
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:51,094
But you should come
with me tomorrow morning

1103
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,374
We can ask maashu to join us

1104
01:06:54,534 --> 01:06:55,534
Just for fun

1105
01:07:07,894 --> 01:07:09,894
Su, tell them I'm not home

1106
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:12,294
Tell that I went to work

1107
01:07:17,254 --> 01:07:19,174
- Kannettan is not here
- (hushes)

1108
01:07:19,654 --> 01:07:20,654
Hey Kanna

1109
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:23,094
We saw you scrambling inside

1110
01:07:31,374 --> 01:07:32,894
Have you started so early?

1111
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:35,774
No, I wasn't drinking

1112
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:38,574
I went in to change my shirt
when I saw you coming

1113
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:40,574
Maashe

1114
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:42,334
Come in, maashe

1115
01:07:44,054 --> 01:07:45,054
Get some tea

1116
01:07:50,814 --> 01:07:53,934
Maashu tried to help you out
but you know where it got him

1117
01:07:54,734 --> 01:07:57,134
Now comrade Ravi is in charge of you

1118
01:07:57,814 --> 01:07:59,653
Comrade wants to speak to you

1119
01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:01,134
You should listen to him

1120
01:08:02,974 --> 01:08:05,974
Not just listen but obey him

1121
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:11,134
Two days ago

1122
01:08:11,814 --> 01:08:13,454
around sunrise

1123
01:08:14,134 --> 01:08:15,134
I had a dream

1124
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,374
I was told that you should
serve the 41-day penance

1125
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:21,974
and go on a pilgrimage to Sabarimala

1126
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:23,894
- Who told you?
- Who told me?

1127
01:08:24,174 --> 01:08:25,374
Do you really want to know?

1128
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:28,934
I may have deviated from the path

1129
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:31,734
But my household has a shrine
and Chathan (demigod) worship

1130
01:08:31,814 --> 01:08:32,814
Don't you know that?

1131
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:36,134
So it's better you obey me

1132
01:08:36,694 --> 01:08:39,974
You will go to Sabarimala following the
customs and observing strict penance

1133
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:44,654
Our reformation club
will bear the expenses

1134
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:47,734
No, that won't be necessary
Nambiar chetta

1135
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:50,534
- That will be inconvenient
- For whom?

1136
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:53,254
Of course, for me

1137
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:57,534
My legs are getting weaker these days

1138
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,254
How can I climb the
steep hill to the temple?

1139
01:09:01,814 --> 01:09:03,054
I have a better plan

1140
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:06,094
I will take medicines
and get well this year

1141
01:09:06,414 --> 01:09:07,774
and make the pilgrimage next year

1142
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:10,134
That will do

1143
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:14,734
Come here

1144
01:09:15,894 --> 01:09:18,094
The party watches over you

1145
01:09:18,814 --> 01:09:20,134
So you are safe

1146
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,854
What if the party doesn't care?

1147
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:23,894
When the party protects you

1148
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:27,454
obey what the party members
tell you to do for your own good

1149
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:30,534
I thought you believed in God

1150
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:32,534
That's why I told you about my dream

1151
01:09:33,694 --> 01:09:36,894
If you ignore this, I fear
there will be consequences

1152
01:09:37,494 --> 01:09:38,694
I will say no more

1153
01:09:39,094 --> 01:09:41,414
But you, she and your child will suffer

1154
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:43,374
None of us will help you

1155
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:50,094
- I didn't say that I won't go
- Then?

1156
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,054
I'm ill

1157
01:09:52,774 --> 01:09:54,974
I don't feel safe going
that far all by myself

1158
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:56,214
That's why

1159
01:09:58,054 --> 01:09:59,054
That's it?

1160
01:09:59,254 --> 01:10:00,694
I can come with you

1161
01:10:01,294 --> 01:10:03,174
Or you can choose anyone of us

1162
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:07,414
Choose any party member you
like and he will go with you

1163
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:10,054
You have secretary
comrade Abu's word

1164
01:10:10,534 --> 01:10:11,653
Tell us who you want

1165
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:14,653
Don't miss this chance because
there is nobody to accompany you

1166
01:10:16,294 --> 01:10:17,294
So?

1167
01:10:17,974 --> 01:10:19,494
So I have to go?

1168
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:21,854
Kanna, 100 percent, yes

1169
01:10:22,374 --> 01:10:24,574
You will go after serving
the 41-day penance

1170
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:27,134
There is no way you
can get out of it

1171
01:10:28,014 --> 01:10:31,694
If this is what comrades have decided
then I have something to say

1172
01:10:31,814 --> 01:10:32,814
Say it

1173
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:35,774
If so...

1174
01:10:36,214 --> 01:10:37,214
I...

1175
01:10:38,094 --> 01:10:41,214
I will go if Ullaas maashu
agrees to go with me

1176
01:10:56,454 --> 01:10:58,814
Imagine you are the driver
of a KSRTC (public) bus

1177
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:00,454
Just imagine

1178
01:11:01,054 --> 01:11:03,254
Suppose the bus has a service to Pamba

1179
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,254
In such a situation

1180
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:09,934
will you refuse to drive to Pamba
because you are a rationalist?

1181
01:11:11,054 --> 01:11:13,934
You are going on an
excursion with Vaavaachi

1182
01:11:14,174 --> 01:11:15,174
That's all

1183
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:17,014
So my beliefs are not important?

1184
01:11:17,854 --> 01:11:19,294
You are our most
important man now

1185
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:22,934
You will defeat him with
your humanity, won't you?

1186
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:26,134
When a helpless mother
and her child suffer

1187
01:11:26,534 --> 01:11:29,334
due to the serious drinking
habit of the father

1188
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:31,734
will the benevolent maashu ignore it?

1189
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:34,934
He will discard his
principles to help them

1190
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:36,534
That idiot thinks you won't do it

1191
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:41,574
There maybe others who will do it
after listening to your lecture

1192
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:44,494
But you can't fool me

1193
01:11:47,014 --> 01:11:49,294
Man is in charge of his life not...

1194
01:11:49,694 --> 01:11:53,534
Maashe, at least his family will be
relieved to see him sober for a few days

1195
01:11:54,014 --> 01:11:55,174
That's not my problem

1196
01:12:02,054 --> 01:12:05,054
Well done, Ullaasa
Your amma is so happy

1197
01:12:22,094 --> 01:12:23,094
Hey

1198
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,614
Do you know

1199
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,894
when I was a little girl I had
taken the vow to go to Sabarimala

1200
01:12:29,494 --> 01:12:32,174
But I started to menstruate
the day before we were to leave

1201
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:33,614
So I could never go

1202
01:12:34,414 --> 01:12:37,214
That curse still haunts our family

1203
01:12:37,934 --> 01:12:40,374
Anyway we will soon be free of it

1204
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:43,134
I know what you are thinking

1205
01:12:43,814 --> 01:12:45,054
But you can quit daydreaming

1206
01:12:45,414 --> 01:12:46,894
So you are not going?

1207
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:49,494
Don't be so enthusiastic about rumours

1208
01:12:49,934 --> 01:12:52,374
I can't set aside my principles
You go now

1209
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:55,214
Keep convincing yourself
that you are right

1210
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:57,934
Finally you will end
up like Therali maashu

1211
01:12:58,334 --> 01:12:59,334
Metam (Aries)

1212
01:12:59,894 --> 01:13:00,894
Idavam (Taurus)

1213
01:13:01,414 --> 01:13:02,454
Mithunam (Gemini)

1214
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:04,014
Karkhitakam (Cancer)

1215
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:05,454
Therali maashe

1216
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:09,214
Hey Ullaasa

1217
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,054
Wake up

1218
01:13:13,734 --> 01:13:14,734
Quick

1219
01:13:15,774 --> 01:13:16,774
She is here

1220
01:13:17,374 --> 01:13:18,654
- Who?
- Bhagyam

1221
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:22,934
She is waiting outside

1222
01:13:23,534 --> 01:13:26,094
When I told her you were sleeping
she asked me not to wake you up

1223
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:29,654
I asked her to come in but she refused

1224
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:31,854
You go, I'll come

1225
01:14:42,734 --> 01:14:44,414
I came to trouble you further, maashe

1226
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:47,414
I know that we have made
life difficult for both of you

1227
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:49,014
That's okay

1228
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:51,974
Anyway I wanted to meet maashu

1229
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:54,894
It's good that we met
to discuss this matter

1230
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:57,694
You know it better, Bhagyasuyam

1231
01:14:58,134 --> 01:14:59,814
I've never softened
my stand on any matter

1232
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,654
I've had to give up so
much because of it

1233
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:05,294
What did you lose, maashe?

1234
01:15:06,054 --> 01:15:07,254
It was others who lost to you

1235
01:15:08,134 --> 01:15:09,134
Oh no, Bhagyechi

1236
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:10,653
Please don't blame anybody

1237
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:12,534
I'm badly in need of help

1238
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,134
That's why I...

1239
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,094
Maashe

1240
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:19,094
Kannettan is not what he seems to be

1241
01:15:19,734 --> 01:15:21,454
He is not keeping well at all

1242
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,254
and he has so many medicines

1243
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:25,654
It's because of his drinking problem

1244
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,534
If he observes penance there will
be some respite for a few days

1245
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:29,854
That's why

1246
01:15:33,774 --> 01:15:35,774
Maashe, at least for
the sake of this child

1247
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:39,494
Suma, you can't move him with your tears

1248
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:43,334
For him tears are just a
fluid with sodium chloride

1249
01:15:43,934 --> 01:15:44,934
That's all

1250
01:15:48,494 --> 01:15:51,094
I didn't come here to argue with you

1251
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:55,214
I thought it would be great if you
could help save somebody's life

1252
01:15:56,214 --> 01:15:57,694
You can do whatever you like

1253
01:15:58,774 --> 01:16:00,374
Who am I to tell you?

1254
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:02,854

Swamiye (invocation to God)

1258
01:16:15,174 --> 01:16:17,414
Sharanamayyappo (Lord
Ayyappan is my refuge)

1259

01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:55,534
Don't laugh

1275
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,174
(chanting mantra)

1276
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:01,814

1280

- (chanting mantra)
- Son

1284
01:17:26,094 --> 01:17:28,374
Look who's here
He has taken the vow

1285
01:17:31,014 --> 01:17:33,454
I wonder if he will turn into
the chief priest at Sabarimala

1286
01:17:35,294 --> 01:17:36,534
It's happened before

1287
01:17:36,614 --> 01:17:39,134
Remember Srinivasan from the
film 'Chinthavishtayaaya Syamala'

1288
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:40,494
What if it comes true?

1289
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:48,294
What are you smiling at?

1290
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:58,734
What are you doing, maashe?

1291
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:01,654
Dinesha, there should be only
one tea on this table from now on

1292
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:05,094
Maashu can't eat or drink
anything from outside for 41 days

1293
01:18:07,614 --> 01:18:08,694
Don't stare at me

1294
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:10,174
See maashe

1295
01:18:10,294 --> 01:18:13,614
A large community of believers
is watching every single move

1296
01:18:16,334 --> 01:18:17,334
You see that?

1297
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,854
We should not break
long-standing customs

1298
01:18:22,653 --> 01:18:23,653
Customs

1299
01:18:24,254 --> 01:18:25,254
What customs?

1300
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:27,014
Have you seen some leaders who

1301
01:18:27,054 --> 01:18:29,214
observe 41-day penance and
visit Sabarimala every year?

1302
01:18:29,934 --> 01:18:32,134
They look as if they are
just out of a beauty salon

1303
01:18:32,614 --> 01:18:34,174
They can do whatever they want, maashe

1304
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:37,974
When we Communists set out for a task
we should do it the right way

1305
01:18:38,494 --> 01:18:40,374
So follow Nambiar's words

1306
01:18:40,814 --> 01:18:43,054
You should be a true Ayyappan
(refers to a male pilgrim)

1307
01:18:43,614 --> 01:18:45,214
in the way you walk, talk and dress

1308

As words you said come back to haunt you

1321
01:19:48,094 --> 01:19:52,494
Swallow them, there's nothing you can do
My son...

1322
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:56,694
No no no say no say no
No no no say no say no to the no

1323
01:19:56,934 --> 01:20:00,734
Who tempts me sweetly
and mocks me gladly?

1324

On the silk quilt laid out for the night

1325
01:20:03,054 --> 01:20:05,414
You will recline, rejoice and relax

1326
01:20:05,494 --> 01:20:07,454
No it's a dream, don't deem

1327

01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,296
Then here's my plan

1428
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,383
I have a friend who stays nearby

1429
01:26:50,463 --> 01:26:52,218
We will ask him
to lend us some money

1430
01:26:52,615 --> 01:26:53,615
That won't work

1431
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:56,292
Come with me, maashe
He will give us money

1432
01:26:58,492 --> 01:26:59,492
Stop here

1433
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:02,709
Come on, maashe

1434
01:27:05,406 --> 01:27:07,428
Swamiye... Sharanamayyappa

1435
01:27:07,545 --> 01:27:09,334
Hey, look who's here?

1436
01:27:09,673 --> 01:27:10,673
O my Vaavaachi...

1437
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,574
I thought of you, my dear boy
while I was praying last night

1438
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,583
You remember me in your
prayers so you can curse me

1439
01:27:18,078 --> 01:27:20,976
Will God listen to me
even if I ask for it?

1440
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:23,179
Chetta, just a minute
I'll be back now

1441
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:26,176
Who is this sage?

1442
01:27:26,293 --> 01:27:28,395
- Ammachi (granny), this is Ullaas maashu
- Ullaas?

1443
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:30,305
- Ammachi, please settle that driver
- Okay

1444
01:27:38,918 --> 01:27:39,918
Sebastian maashu

1445
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,103
- Good gracious, Ullaas maashe
- Maashe

1446
01:27:46,204 --> 01:27:48,892
Vaavaachi, I can't believe my eyes

1447
01:27:58,337 --> 01:28:00,853
He did tell me that he will
bring you here one day

1448
01:28:01,306 --> 01:28:03,509
But I never thought he had
such a thing on his mind

1449
01:28:04,407 --> 01:28:07,055
I'm sorry I didn't come to see
you after you left Chekkunnu

1450
01:28:07,601 --> 01:28:08,601
It's my fault

1451
01:28:09,094 --> 01:28:11,383
Why would I need another
help from Chekunnu?

1452
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:12,953
He is always there for me

1453
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:15,445
He visits me every two or three months

1454
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:18,315
He has no reservations about
the kind of job he will do

1455
01:28:18,696 --> 01:28:20,112
He does whatever he can

1456
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:24,565
Bring it

1457
01:28:25,924 --> 01:28:28,057
Here is our sweet robusta banana, maashe

1458
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,130
Straight from the garden

1459
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,505
He planted it himself so it has to be sweet

1460
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,490
Maashe

1461
01:28:37,918 --> 01:28:40,279
Rationalists like you may not believe in it

1462
01:28:41,138 --> 01:28:44,849
But for believers like us Sabarimala
pilgrimage is not just a journey

1463
01:28:46,558 --> 01:28:47,979
We repay our old debts

1464
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:50,784
meet our Gods on the way

1465
01:28:50,994 --> 01:28:53,536
pray to them, seek their blessings
and then go up the hill

1466
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:56,628
Maashe

1467
01:28:57,862 --> 01:28:59,330
Make sure everything is intact

1468
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:00,908
Don't blame this Vaavaachi later

1469
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,165
The seat reservation coupons
for the A/C bus to Bangalore

1470
01:29:25,507 --> 01:29:30,117
via Kozhikode, Sulthan Bathery
Gundalpettu, Nenjankodu, Mysore & Mandya

1471
01:29:30,484 --> 01:29:32,234
can be bought from the enquiry counter

1472
01:29:33,315 --> 01:29:35,033
Maashe, have you slept?

1473
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:37,456
Tell me

1474
01:29:39,346 --> 01:29:42,025
We don't know if God exists or not

1475
01:29:42,579 --> 01:29:44,298
You don't know but I know

1476
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:48,071
Suppose there is no God, as you believe

1477
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,798
We lose nothing by believing
that there is a greater power

1478
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:53,773
Now if at all God exists

1479
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,586
believing in God will be very useful

1480
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:57,709
and those who don't
believe will pay the price

1481
01:29:58,161 --> 01:30:01,075
I think that's why ordinary men
can't be rationalists

1482
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:02,478
Am I right, maashe?

1483
01:30:03,358 --> 01:30:06,037
There is no such thing as ordinary men
or extraordinary men

1484
01:30:07,346 --> 01:30:09,244
Basically, every man is a rationalist

1485
01:30:11,028 --> 01:30:13,411
Imagine it's raining suddenly

1486
01:30:14,637 --> 01:30:16,637
Most animals seek shelter

1487
01:30:17,231 --> 01:30:18,942
Some ignore the rain and go their way

1488
01:30:19,599 --> 01:30:20,665
But what about man?

1489
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:26,889
Man with his wisdom invented the
umbrella so that he doesn't get wet

1490
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:31,021
With an umbrella you can go out and
get your job done even if it's raining

1491
01:30:32,973 --> 01:30:33,973
Vaavaachi

1492
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:38,576
One who uses his wisdom to change
any situation in his favour

1493
01:30:39,069 --> 01:30:40,280
is a true rationalist

1494
01:30:40,967 --> 01:30:41,967
However maashe

1495
01:30:42,474 --> 01:30:46,084
Who creates such situations that
a man uses to his advantage?

1496
01:30:46,549 --> 01:30:47,549
Isn't it God's work?

1497
01:30:55,018 --> 01:30:56,018
Ayyappa (Lord Ayyappan)

1498
01:31:32,652 --> 01:31:35,754
- Chetta, can you stop at Punnapra-Vayalar?
- Not possible

1499
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:39,144
- There are two of us, if you can...
- The bus doesn't stop there

1500
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:49,209
I took this long route
because I wanted to see it

1501
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:51,179
Or we could have gone via M.C. Road

1502
01:31:55,716 --> 01:31:57,957
- Maashe, take this, quick
- They won't stop here

1503
01:31:58,004 --> 01:31:59,040
Just listen to me

1504
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,480
Step aside, maashe

1505
01:32:04,596 --> 01:32:07,518
Oh gosh, I want to pee
Please stop the bus

1506
01:32:07,594 --> 01:32:09,604
Stop or I will pee in the bus
I rang the bell

1507
01:32:09,662 --> 01:32:10,936
Driver sir please stop the bus

1508
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:13,038
I will pee right now
Come on

1509
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:15,199
Saayippe (slang for white
male), you want to pee?

1510
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:19,648
Come on maashe, get off the bus

1511
01:32:20,382 --> 01:32:21,382
Get down

1512
01:32:22,874 --> 01:32:23,874
Let's go maashe

1513
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:30,641
The wind here still has
the scent of the revolution

1514
01:32:32,016 --> 01:32:33,836
Maashe, you go on and greet the martyrs

1515
01:32:34,328 --> 01:32:36,237
I will get a soda

1516
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,749
- A glass of water
- I don't sell water

1517
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:48,835
Then give me a soda

1518
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:56,155
Now give me a glass of water

1519
01:32:59,922 --> 01:33:00,922
Here it is

1520
01:33:19,222 --> 01:33:21,535
(Punnapra-Vayalar Uprising
Martyrs' Memorial)

1521
01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:47,207
Oh my God

1522
01:33:57,081 --> 01:33:58,284
How do we go from here?

1523
01:33:59,058 --> 01:34:01,879
Since we are here we could visit
the nearby Ambalappuzha temple

1524
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:04,705
There...

1525
01:34:05,116 --> 01:34:07,359
Ambalappuzha pal payasam (sacred food)...
We... there...

1526
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,462
Since... it's a long journey...

1527
01:34:09,658 --> 01:34:12,454
Maashe... we can have some...
long journey...

1528
01:34:13,365 --> 01:34:14,365
Maashe

1529
01:34:15,064 --> 01:34:16,064
Maashe

1530
01:34:17,565 --> 01:34:18,759
It was a mistake, maashe

1531
01:34:19,379 --> 01:34:21,027
I didn't drink all these days

1532
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:22,388
I won't do it again

1533
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:25,731
Maashe, I swear on Jenimol I didn't
have a single drop for 41 days

1534
01:34:26,866 --> 01:34:28,773
- Trust me, maashe
- Stop it, you

1535
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:32,461
Here I'm making a fool of
myself for your sake and you...

1536
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:33,771
Maashe

1537
01:34:34,152 --> 01:34:36,441
This is the end of it all
I'm going back

1538
01:34:36,514 --> 01:34:37,514
- Maashe
- Get lost

1539
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:39,556
Maashe

1540
01:34:39,643 --> 01:34:41,600
- Ayyappo... Swamiye (pilgrims chanting)
- Maashe

1541
01:34:41,733 --> 01:34:44,015
(pilgrims chanting)

1542
01:34:44,134 --> 01:34:46,454
- (pilgrims chanting)
- Maashe, don't go

1543
01:34:46,527 --> 01:34:48,454
- Maashe, just listen to me
- (pilgrims chanting)

1544
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:50,430
- Maashe, please don't go
- (pilgrims chanting)

1545
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,130
- Maashe, let me explain
- Leave me alone

1546
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,965
- What the hell are you doing?
- Maashe stop

1547
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,338
- Maashe, don't go
- Hey you

1548
01:34:55,412 --> 01:34:57,525
- Maashe, I won't do it again
- I'll give you a whack

1549
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:11,237
Comrade

1550
01:35:14,755 --> 01:35:16,279
How can you do that, maashe?

1551
01:35:17,935 --> 01:35:20,052
How can you change your
decision without asking

1552
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:22,084
the people who gave you
this responsibility?

1553
01:35:23,702 --> 01:35:24,702
I'm not surprised

1554
01:35:25,413 --> 01:35:28,624
You are in the habit of running
away from your responsibilities

1555
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:31,280
What do you want me to do, comrade?

1556
01:35:31,444 --> 01:35:32,444
You are asking me?

1557
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,061
Give it to me

1558
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,100
Maashe

1559
01:35:36,304 --> 01:35:37,991
You have to be more responsible

1560
01:35:39,209 --> 01:35:41,802
Don't you know that his enemies
are waiting for an opportunity?

1561
01:35:42,498 --> 01:35:45,115
Besides, has he ever
travelled far from Chekkunnu?

1562
01:35:47,025 --> 01:35:49,322
You have walked out on a crazy fellow

1563
01:35:49,931 --> 01:35:50,931
Maashe

1564
01:35:51,236 --> 01:35:52,744
If at all something happens to him

1565
01:35:53,133 --> 01:35:54,352
you will be answerable

1566
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:56,118
Mark my words

1567
01:36:18,691 --> 01:36:19,691
Chetta, here

1568
01:36:29,937 --> 01:36:31,460
- Are you here for your friend?
- Yes

1569
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:33,249
He deserves a solid whack

1570
01:36:33,523 --> 01:36:35,045
I let him go because
he is a Swami

1571
01:36:35,139 --> 01:36:36,858
You would be killed
if you fell off the bus

1572
01:36:37,123 --> 01:36:38,123
You are lucky

1573
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:39,858
I was already calling up
for an ambulance

1574
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:41,279
This one is for your good luck

1575
01:36:41,568 --> 01:36:43,287
Have you seen him around since?

1576
01:36:43,392 --> 01:36:45,876
I pulled him away before
he was run over by the bus

1577
01:36:46,665 --> 01:36:48,580
He said he didn't have
money to go to Sabarimala

1578
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:52,016
I told him that he could travel for free
with a group from Ambalappuzha

1579
01:36:52,984 --> 01:36:56,594
So that's why he was hurrying to
the Ambalappuzha temple

1580
01:37:03,688 --> 01:37:04,688
- Hello
- Okay then

1581
01:37:04,782 --> 01:37:05,782
You are a strange guy

1582
01:37:06,492 --> 01:37:09,594
You travelled with him all these days
And you don't have his number?

1583
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:12,394
Oh yes, you were unhappy
about the trip from the start

1584
01:37:13,301 --> 01:37:15,496
Alright I will send his number right now

1585
01:37:16,022 --> 01:37:17,420
But you have to find him

1586
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,820
Or you can forget about returning home

1587
01:37:28,069 --> 01:37:29,069
Hello

1588
01:37:29,287 --> 01:37:30,795
- Hey Kanna
- Who is this?

1589
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:34,876
- Isn't this Kannan's number?
- Yes but who are you

1590
01:37:35,164 --> 01:37:36,164
I'm...

1591
01:37:36,478 --> 01:37:37,571
C.S. Ullaaskumar

1592
01:37:38,462 --> 01:37:40,129
Is it you, Ullaas maashu?

1593
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:41,990
Maashe, it's me Sebu

1594
01:37:42,178 --> 01:37:43,178
Sebastian

1595
01:37:43,982 --> 01:37:45,459
Yesterday just before you left

1596
01:37:45,889 --> 01:37:47,881
he gave this phone to me

1597
01:37:48,789 --> 01:37:50,281
I refused to take it but he insisted

1598
01:37:50,758 --> 01:37:53,578
He told me a friend gave it to
him on returning from the Gulf

1599
01:37:54,463 --> 01:37:56,665
He feared that if he kept it
he would lose it somewhere

1600
01:37:58,463 --> 01:38:00,463
But where are you guys now?

1601
01:38:02,017 --> 01:38:03,539
What about our good man?

1602
01:38:03,742 --> 01:38:04,742
He is with me

1603
01:38:05,032 --> 01:38:06,742
Hello can you hear me?

1604
01:38:07,078 --> 01:38:09,578
I can't hear you because of the fireworks

1605
01:38:09,702 --> 01:38:10,875
- Hello
- Hello

1606
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:12,885
Hello

1607
01:38:12,966 --> 01:38:16,278
Swamiye... Sharanamayyappa
(pilgrims chanting)

1608
01:38:16,754 --> 01:38:20,684
Hariharasuthane... Sharanamayyappa
(pilgrims chanting)

1609
01:38:26,354 --> 01:38:30,354
The Ambalappuzha group goes to Erumeli to
perform Pettathullal (a ritualistic dance)

1610
01:38:30,448 --> 01:38:33,354
But before they begin the dance
another group starts from here

1611
01:38:34,704 --> 01:38:36,016
Just like Swami said

1612
01:38:36,493 --> 01:38:39,626
I saw a man rushing towards the
vehicle from the western side

1613
01:38:39,993 --> 01:38:41,193
He got in just before it left

1614
01:38:42,642 --> 01:38:45,282
Swami, you should go
straight to Erumeli from here

1615
01:38:45,462 --> 01:38:46,555
That's better

1616
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:48,621
Those who went from here

1617
01:38:49,082 --> 01:38:51,808
go there to watch
Ambalappuzha group's Pettathullal

1618
01:38:52,316 --> 01:38:53,543
Only then they climb the hills

1619
01:39:30,676 --> 01:39:32,074
Swami Sharanam (pilgrim chanting)

1620
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,660
Swami

1621
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,386
Swami

1622
01:39:38,715 --> 01:39:39,715
We are in Pathanamthitta

1623
01:39:40,442 --> 01:39:41,442
This is the last stop

1624
01:39:56,228 --> 01:39:57,607
He is a troublemaker

1625
01:39:57,786 --> 01:39:59,200
But now that he is not with me...

1626
01:40:00,076 --> 01:40:01,107
That's the thing, sir

1627
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,833
When he is not with you

1628
01:40:04,178 --> 01:40:05,378
you miss him

1629
01:40:06,348 --> 01:40:07,735
When you search for him

1630
01:40:08,619 --> 01:40:10,954
you hope that you will
meet him somewhere soon

1631
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:13,704
That's what believing in God is about

1632
01:40:16,638 --> 01:40:17,871
When you are all alone

1633
01:40:18,364 --> 01:40:20,684
simply believe that somebody
who can't be seen is with you

1634
01:40:21,372 --> 01:40:23,193
And hope that something good will happen

1635
01:40:23,388 --> 01:40:24,388
That's all

1636
01:40:37,254 --> 01:40:38,370
Swami let's go

1637
01:40:39,059 --> 01:40:40,176
- Shall we go?
- Yeah

1638
01:40:41,059 --> 01:40:42,262
My irumudikkettu...

1639
01:40:49,904 --> 01:40:51,693
I hope you didn't have
a hard time finding me

1640
01:40:55,178 --> 01:40:56,178
Sir

1641
01:40:56,279 --> 01:40:57,475
- Get in
- Swami Sharanam

1642
01:40:57,763 --> 01:40:58,860
What's the matter, sir?

1643
01:40:58,977 --> 01:41:00,164
- Are you with him?
- Yes

1644
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:02,165
- Then you can join him, go on
- But sir...

1645
01:41:05,784 --> 01:41:06,784
What's the matter?

1646
01:41:08,011 --> 01:41:09,011
Sir, he is...

1647
01:41:12,565 --> 01:41:13,576
Get up

1648
01:41:15,434 --> 01:41:18,442
If you feel like tearing up your clothes
or slapping your own cheeks

1649
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:20,637
you may please carry on

1650
01:41:20,982 --> 01:41:22,488
We have installed cameras everywhere

1651
01:41:22,972 --> 01:41:25,058
Mr. S.I. on what grounds are you...

1652
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:32,357
Who's this newbie?

1653
01:41:32,529 --> 01:41:33,849
I'm C.S. Ullaaskumar

1654
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:35,139
That means

1655
01:41:35,326 --> 01:41:38,248
I'm the author of the popular
book 'God as a businessman'

1656
01:41:39,148 --> 01:41:40,815
So you do business with God?

1657
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:43,524
Do you believe in God?

1658
01:41:43,843 --> 01:41:44,843
I'm not...

1659
01:41:45,096 --> 01:41:48,510
Sir, he is Ullaas Swami
a well-known Ayyappa devotee

1660
01:41:48,886 --> 01:41:51,104
We just met at the bus stand
That's all

1661
01:41:51,476 --> 01:41:53,171
He is not a part of my gang

1662
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:56,716
Ullaas Swami and I have never
met each other before today

1663
01:41:58,211 --> 01:41:59,211
- Hey
- Sir

1664
01:41:59,297 --> 01:42:01,031
Get a copy of Ullaas Swami's ID card

1665
01:42:01,337 --> 01:42:02,337
Go with him

1666
01:42:03,141 --> 01:42:04,141
Come on

1667
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:15,102
Swami Sharanam

1668
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:35,625
Comrades

1669
01:43:37,219 --> 01:43:38,516
- Dear friends
- Swami

1670
01:43:38,915 --> 01:43:40,633
Say Swami Sharanam first

1671
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:43,297
- Friends indeed
- Swami Sharanam

1672
01:43:43,767 --> 01:43:46,048
Attention Comrade K.T. Kannan
of Puthiyangu Lakshamveedu

1673
01:43:46,463 --> 01:43:48,963
in Chekkunnu village of Kannur district

1674
01:43:50,142 --> 01:43:53,736
Friend and guide C.S. Ullaaskumar
is waiting for you at the counter

1675
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:56,927
I request Comrade Kannan
to take this as a notice

1676
01:43:57,326 --> 01:43:59,451
and present himself at
the counter immediately

1677
01:44:00,271 --> 01:44:02,958
If not Chekkunnu LC (local committee)
will be officially informed

1678
01:44:03,568 --> 01:44:05,076
and prompted to take strong action

1679
01:44:06,411 --> 01:44:08,427
Appa (father), I'm here, appa

1680
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:48,802
- Hello
- Hello (woman's voice)

1681
01:44:49,091 --> 01:44:50,091
Hello

1682
01:44:50,177 --> 01:44:51,690
- I had black tea
- It's Rs. 20

1683
01:44:52,456 --> 01:44:54,056
Why are you paying for one?

1684
01:44:54,575 --> 01:44:55,742
What about our Vaavaachi?

1685
01:44:57,896 --> 01:45:00,388
Don't forget that he is an Ayyappan

1686
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:54,268
Swami thinthakathomthom
Ayyappathinthakathomthom (devotional song)

1687
01:45:54,355 --> 01:45:57,120
Swami thinthakathomthom
Ayyappathinthakathomthom

1688
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:33,448
Maashe

1689
01:46:37,169 --> 01:46:38,170
Maashe

1690
01:46:41,614 --> 01:46:42,614
Maashe (murmurs)

1691
01:46:44,622 --> 01:46:45,622
Kanna

1692
01:46:51,184 --> 01:46:52,184
Hey

1693
01:47:15,434 --> 01:47:16,434
Hey

1694
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:18,708
Kanna

1695
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:22,982
Kanna

1696
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:27,161
Maashe

1697
01:47:38,259 --> 01:47:40,524
When you finally found
him he is flat on his back

1698
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,586
Do you realise now that if
you seek you will find?

1699
01:47:45,405 --> 01:47:47,536
You know sir was so worried
when you went missing

1700
01:47:50,102 --> 01:47:51,902
Sir, I'm no hardened criminal

1701
01:47:52,117 --> 01:47:54,414
But I had blown up a police
station in the past, that's it

1702
01:47:56,431 --> 01:47:58,431
Even we had a red flag

1703
01:47:58,937 --> 01:48:00,647
But it was the colour of blood

1704
01:48:00,955 --> 01:48:02,253
We were so young then

1705
01:48:02,752 --> 01:48:05,081
The police were after us and
I was tired of running away

1706
01:48:05,674 --> 01:48:07,481
So I wore a black mundu
and climbed the hill

1707
01:48:07,751 --> 01:48:09,632
Since then I have been
to Sabarimala every year

1708
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:11,265
Now I'm a periyaswami
(senior pilgrim)

1709
01:48:11,337 --> 01:48:13,479
However, the police often
come and ask questions

1710
01:48:13,828 --> 01:48:14,925
Maybe to kill time

1711
01:48:17,182 --> 01:48:20,493
You should wash your sins away in
River Pampa before going up the hill

1712
01:48:43,335 --> 01:48:45,335
Ayyanayyanayyan (Lord Ayyappan)

1713
01:48:45,444 --> 01:48:47,444
Ayyanayyanayyan

1714
01:48:48,592 --> 01:48:50,592
Ayyanayyanayyan

1715
01:48:50,896 --> 01:48:52,896
Ayyanayyanayyan

1716
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:56,825
Your ego wanes

1717
01:48:58,177 --> 01:49:00,812
Your notion of other fades

1718
01:49:00,992 --> 01:49:03,216
Into the infinite ocean of divinity

1719
01:49:03,497 --> 01:49:05,504
Everything is within you

1720
01:49:06,012 --> 01:49:08,293
Everything is within I

1721
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:11,992
This is the Supreme Truth
This is the meaning you seek

1722
01:49:13,656 --> 01:49:18,335
See the invisible
Beyond what eyes can see

1723
01:49:18,715 --> 01:49:23,355
See the manifest
Beyond what eyes can believe

1724
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:25,750
Ayyanayyanayyan

1725
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:28,394
Ayyanayyanayyan

1726
01:49:28,808 --> 01:49:33,644
The whole universe is nothing
But a dance of illusion

1727
01:49:53,933 --> 01:49:58,847
Though time like a serpent bites into life
You seek sustenance to keep alive

1728
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:03,652
Like travellers at the wayside inn
Who turn keepers and reign

1729
01:50:04,144 --> 01:50:08,417
You rest your head on
a deadly snake tonight

1730
01:50:09,222 --> 01:50:13,519
And dream of the money
you will earn in daylight

1731
01:50:14,324 --> 01:50:18,495
You caress the myth of self
As death dances on your shoulder

1732
01:50:19,206 --> 01:50:21,800
No one will come again
No one will douse the flames

1733
01:50:21,894 --> 01:50:24,470
As you feed the fire and ashen the pyre

1734
01:50:24,603 --> 01:50:26,603
Ayyanayyanayyan

1735
01:50:26,892 --> 01:50:28,892
Ayyanayyanayyan

1736
01:50:29,462 --> 01:50:31,462
Ayyanayyanayyan

1737
01:50:31,878 --> 01:50:33,878
Ayyanayyanayyan

1738
01:50:34,487 --> 01:50:36,487
Ayyanayyanayyan

1739
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:38,931
Ayyanayyanayyan

1740
01:50:39,572 --> 01:50:44,201
The whole universe is nothing
But a dance of illusion

1741
01:50:49,614 --> 01:50:52,160
You should not climb the hill carrying arms

1742
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:54,028
Not even a small piece of iron

1743
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,746
Your mind should be
without fear when you go up

1744
01:50:59,824 --> 01:51:04,136
Let no man know misery or pain
This is the quest to life’s purpose

1745
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,175
Let every man see God in everyone
This is the path to realising the true self

1746
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:14,152
Let your mind be free of the folly of caste
While you go up to the unknown

1747
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:19,355
Let your mind recall the oneness of life
While you go down to the known

1748
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:24,058
Though you stand divided in the world
You are bound by one thread in the soul

1749
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:27,425
You are nothing on your own
You are not absolute all alone

1750
01:51:27,582 --> 01:51:29,800
Stand together
Live for each other

1751
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,190
Ayyanayyanayyan

1752
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:34,561
Ayyanayyanayyan

1753
01:51:35,096 --> 01:51:37,096
Ayyanayyanayyan

1754
01:51:37,565 --> 01:51:39,565
Ayyanayyanayyan

1755
01:51:40,112 --> 01:51:42,112
Ayyanayyanayyan

1756
01:51:42,652 --> 01:51:44,652
Ayyanayyanayyan

1757
01:51:45,241 --> 01:51:49,163
The whole universe is nothing
But a dance of illusion

1758
01:52:00,312 --> 01:52:02,312
Ayyanayyanayyan

1759
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:04,861
Ayyanayyanayyan

1760
01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:09,452
The whole universe is nothing
But a dance of illusion

1761
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:12,928
Swamiye

1762
01:52:13,296 --> 01:52:15,560
Swamiye

1763
01:52:17,604 --> 01:52:19,604
Swamiye

1764
01:52:19,986 --> 01:52:21,533
Swamiye

1765
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:23,784
Sharanamayyappa

1766
01:52:27,896 --> 01:52:30,195
'The path to Pullumedu'

1767
01:53:09,633 --> 01:53:10,633
Swamiye

1768
01:53:18,228 --> 01:53:19,228
Maashe

1769
01:53:19,625 --> 01:53:20,625
Let's sit down

1770
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:23,962
Ayyappa

1771
01:53:45,804 --> 01:53:47,408
We could have left after praying

1772
01:53:47,835 --> 01:53:49,741
But no you had to come
all the way up Pullumedu

1773
01:53:50,025 --> 01:53:51,744
and see the sacred lamp being lit

1774
01:54:12,015 --> 01:54:13,122
Today...

1775
01:54:17,614 --> 01:54:18,614
What is that?

1776
01:54:23,255 --> 01:54:24,255
Is it blood?

1777
01:54:24,919 --> 01:54:25,919
It's nothing, maashe

1778
01:54:29,082 --> 01:54:30,082
Maashe

1779
01:54:31,956 --> 01:54:33,463
I'll die shitting blood

1780
01:54:34,058 --> 01:54:36,542
Someone might have
cursed me for what I did

1781
01:54:39,691 --> 01:54:41,871
Sometimes the pain is unbearable

1782
01:54:42,579 --> 01:54:43,579
That's when I...

1783
01:54:45,769 --> 01:54:47,448
That's my chemotherapy

1784
01:54:53,296 --> 01:54:54,296
Maashe, that's why

1785
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:57,495
I kept quiet when Saji
went to jail in my place

1786
01:54:58,484 --> 01:54:59,633
If at least for a few days

1787
01:55:00,203 --> 01:55:02,093
I can hold Suma and
my child in my arms

1788
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:03,857
What is wrong with you?

1789
01:55:04,671 --> 01:55:06,171
It's not incurable

1790
01:55:07,789 --> 01:55:09,031
What cure, maashe?

1791
01:55:10,179 --> 01:55:11,843
My Jenimol is blind

1792
01:55:12,667 --> 01:55:16,089
If I disclose my illness I may have
to sell my house to pay the hospital bills

1793
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:20,147
I want my little girl to start seeing again

1794
01:55:22,593 --> 01:55:24,194
My well-being is insignificant

1795
01:55:24,554 --> 01:55:25,983
How can you live with it, Kanna?

1796
01:55:27,053 --> 01:55:28,264
That's okay, maashe

1797
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,640
This has been with me for
the last couple of years

1798
01:55:31,154 --> 01:55:32,341
Now and then it hurts

1799
01:55:34,756 --> 01:55:36,022
Let's go, maashe

1800
01:55:37,379 --> 01:55:38,545
Could you give me some water?

1801
01:55:42,568 --> 01:55:43,649
Let me get it

1802
01:56:05,712 --> 01:56:08,110
(Jenimol's laughter)

1803
01:56:15,866 --> 01:56:17,983
(Jenimol's laughter)

1804
01:56:18,288 --> 01:56:19,928
[Jenimol] Acha...

1805
01:56:22,678 --> 01:56:24,405
[Jenimol] My goodbye kiss

1806
01:58:13,017 --> 01:58:14,017
Move aside, swami

1807
01:58:21,073 --> 01:58:22,073
Kanna

1808
01:58:23,392 --> 01:58:24,392
Here it is

1809
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:32,230
Kanna

1810
01:58:33,954 --> 01:58:34,954
Kanna

1811
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:37,719
Hey

1812
01:59:17,746 --> 01:59:18,746
Comrade

1813
01:59:48,613 --> 01:59:50,737
Swami, get away quickly

1814
01:59:50,946 --> 01:59:54,440
Nobody knows how many are injured
or how many died

1815
01:59:54,534 --> 01:59:58,144
Lord Ayyappa, it seems like the
hill is shaking people off it

1816
02:00:43,606 --> 02:00:44,606
Move

1817
02:00:45,977 --> 02:00:46,977
Move

1818
02:00:54,949 --> 02:00:56,168
Sir

1819
02:00:58,359 --> 02:00:59,573
Sir, please help

1820
02:01:00,637 --> 02:01:03,237
There are reports of a major stampede
in Pullumedu forest where

1821
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,348
thousands gather to witness the lighting
of the sacred lamp at Sabarimala

1822
02:01:06,563 --> 02:01:08,879
Details of the accident
are not yet available

1823
02:01:09,219 --> 02:01:12,946
The bulk of Sabarimala pilgrims are from
the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra

1824
02:01:13,213 --> 02:01:14,712
Most pilgrims go to Pullumedu

1825
02:01:14,892 --> 02:01:18,008
after praying at Sabarimala to
see the lighting of the sacred lamp

1826
02:01:18,281 --> 02:01:21,281
Reports confirm that a record number of
pilgrims went to Pullumedu this year

1827
02:01:21,585 --> 02:01:24,241
Devaswom Minister is speaking to
the media from Thiruvananthapuram

1828
02:01:24,329 --> 02:01:25,329
Over to him

1829
02:01:25,438 --> 02:01:27,626
No, we don't know about the death toll yet

1830
02:01:28,282 --> 02:01:30,962
There was an unprecedented
number of people at Pullumedu

1831
02:01:31,585 --> 02:01:34,483
All we know is that several
people died due to heavy rush

1832
02:01:35,423 --> 02:01:38,212
We are deploying more forces
to coordinate rescue efforts

1833
02:01:40,204 --> 02:01:41,596
There is no cause for concern

1834
02:01:42,063 --> 02:01:43,792
This government will support the affected

1835
02:01:44,407 --> 02:01:47,212
We will provide their families
with all kinds of assistance

1836
02:01:48,156 --> 02:01:50,080
The government will take
charge of these families

1837
02:01:50,642 --> 02:01:53,563
Moreover, the Tamil Nadu
government has promised to help

1838
02:01:54,345 --> 02:01:57,454
The government is handling
the matter with utmost care

1839
02:08:29,971 --> 02:08:30,971
Hold this

1840
02:08:31,846 --> 02:08:32,846
Move

1841
02:08:32,966 --> 02:08:34,203
Make way, swami

1842
02:09:14,394 --> 02:09:15,394
K.T. Kannan

1843
02:09:15,708 --> 02:09:18,105
Puthiyangu Lakshamveedu
Chekkunnu P.O., Kannur

1844
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:32,813
'The start of a new academic year'

1845
02:09:43,444 --> 02:09:44,444
Maashe

1846
02:09:49,545 --> 02:09:51,334
You look so pretty

1847
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:53,340
Do you like your new dress?

1848
02:09:57,066 --> 02:09:59,247
This blue sky

1849
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:01,830
This sunshine

1850
02:10:02,533 --> 02:10:06,892
These flowers down the lane

1851
02:10:08,275 --> 02:10:12,970
These hearts that sing the glory of love

1852
02:10:13,735 --> 02:10:17,939
These eyes that light up a thousand lights

1853
02:10:19,095 --> 02:10:21,595
What are they but

1854
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:22,680
Maashe

1855
02:10:22,822 --> 02:10:24,422
Your benevolent offering

1856
02:10:24,699 --> 02:10:27,724
Your showers of graceful blessing

1857
02:10:28,105 --> 02:10:31,347
Maashe, who creates situations that
a man uses to his advantage?

1858
02:10:31,885 --> 02:10:34,448
Your song of deepest longing

1859
02:10:36,117 --> 02:10:37,117
Maashe

1860
02:10:39,403 --> 02:10:40,403
Maashe

1861
02:10:41,669 --> 02:10:45,669
Let there be light in my life

1862
02:10:47,076 --> 02:10:51,068
With the spirit in your kind eyes

1863
02:10:52,747 --> 02:10:57,080
Let my mind dance with joy
With the eternal music in your soul

1864
02:10:58,175 --> 02:11:00,801
The compensation given by Kerala
and Tamil Nadu state governments

1865
02:11:00,895 --> 02:11:03,089
to the victims
of the Pullumedu tragedy

1866
02:11:03,381 --> 02:11:05,074
brought light into Jenimol's eyes

1867
02:11:06,115 --> 02:11:08,522
The thought of utilising a pointless death

1868
02:11:09,241 --> 02:11:11,787
to the benefit of the living
could have occurred

1869
02:11:12,183 --> 02:11:14,347
only in the mind of a rationalist
like Ullaas maashu

1870
02:11:15,355 --> 02:11:18,574
It's been two years but the debate
has not ended in Chekkunnu

1871
02:11:19,173 --> 02:11:21,470
Rationalists claim that maashu
did not go to Sabarimala

1872
02:11:21,837 --> 02:11:23,891
Devotees argue that Lord
Ayyappan saved his life

1873
02:11:24,603 --> 02:11:28,336
Ullaas maashu smiles in reply
burying the truth within him
