1
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,981
What do you think of my shot?
- Mind-blowing!

2
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:55,320
Appears as if you didn't like it.
- Relax. It wasn't so great

3
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,720
You haven't won the world cup.
- What do they do with it anyway?

4
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,726
Hi guys! Long time no see!
Where have you guys been?

5
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,328
Who's that with Deepak?
- Looks like a girl to me

6
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:11,827
"Thank you, thank you"

7
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,738
"Hey Deepak, how have you been?"

8
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:23,339
"Meet Aditya. And this is
his beautiful wife, Rashmi"

9
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,743
And that's Vivek;
he's still looking for a girl

10
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,345
And meet my fiance... Sheetal

11
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,349
You didn't tell us you got engaged!
- Amazing friend!

12
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,991
"It happened so quickly,
I didn't even realise it"

13
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:39,764
You never get to realise anything.
- Hold on... please sit down

14
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,032
"She comes here for the first time,
and you guys..."

15
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,363
"Vivek, what's all this about? Salim
called and asked me to get here"

16
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,374
But he didn't tell me any reason.
Would you know why we're meeting here?

17
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,771
He always keeps the reason a suspense.
Is that Salim? Where are you?

18
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,779
We've been waiting here for you!
What? Stuck in the traffic?

19
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,787
"Hurry up, I say!
What? All right"

20
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,117
He's still stuck in the traffic.
- That's his usual excuse

21
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,790
What book is this?
- A love story

22
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,793
"If one could have a romance like this
in real life, it'd be terrific"

23
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:20,137
"Deepak, haven't you told her
about Raj's love story?"

24
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,807
"No, I didn't get the opportunity.
- You're crazy"

25
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,541
"If you had told her, she wouldn't
have been talking like this"

26
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:30,406
Are you telling me that a fairytale
romance takes place even in real life?

27
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,411
I don't believe it.
- Decide that after you've heard it

28
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,419
I'll tell you how they met...
- One moment. You've started already!

29
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:43,418
"Before that, tell her
something about Raj"

30
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,831
"One moment. I'll tell her...
- No, I'll tell her"

31
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:53,838
Raj is from Punjab.
His father has a farm there

32
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:56,432
So Raj...
- Is a farmer?

33
00:04:56,843 --> 00:05:00,836
"No, Raj wanted to become an engineer.
So he moved to the city"

34
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,542
So Raj is an engineer?

35
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,842
"No, although he came to the city
to learn engineering, he was..."

36
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,455
taken up with the export business.
- And now...

37
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,057
he mustn't be in the exports
business either?

38
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,861
"This Raj of yours...
he does something, doesn't he?"

39
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,863
"That's Raj for you. What he
thought about, he never did"

40
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:24,865
"And what he did,
he never thought about again!"

41
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,891
"Hello, Raj!
- How are you doing?"

42
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,891
Give me that tape-recorder...
- Don't touch it

43
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:52,487
"I'm playing the music of "Gadar"
"and Sunny Deol's my favourite hero"

44
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,901
"Raj, you got here from Bangalore in
just two days instead of three?"

45
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,904
And you take three days
instead of two!

46
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:03,903
Can't help it. My truck stalls
and I get delayed

47
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,843
"So my truck's scrap, eh!
Know what?"

48
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:10,305
Three girls jumped before my truck
at Pune's check post and said...

49
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:11,916
brother-in-law's here!

50
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,919
He meets the girls and tells me
that my trucks are junk!

51
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:20,923
"I've fixed new tyres in the truck,
it has a rotary compression engine"

52
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,928
So don't use kerosene in it.
Use Castrol lubrication oil

53
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,931
"You don't have any more excuses
to come late, okay?"

54
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,869
"Raj, there's a phone.
- So? What's the matter?"

55
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,195
It's the owner of Tradelink.
- Tradelink!

56
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,532
Pass it to me! Quick!

57
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:53,958
"How could I forget the meeting!
Guys, where are my boots?"

58
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,960
"Must be right there, Raj"

59
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,908
Sonofagun! Stop singing!

60
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,974
The trucks haven't got there yet?
Lmpossible. I'll find out right now

61
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,983
Why haven't the trucks
reached there yet?

62
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,996
They're at the pump for air...
- I'll shove it all up yours! Morons!

63
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,620
"The trucks will be there, sir.
When? I'll find out from my engineer"

64
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:04,028
"How long will it take to get ready?
He's asking, you morons!"

65
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,631
Lt'll take at least half an hour.
- Half an hour?

66
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,028
I'm going to beat you guys up!

67
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,038
"The truck's there...
Any moment now, sir"

68
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:20,044
"I have a landline to mobile phone.
I'm following it, I sure am"

69
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,978
We must meet at the Oberoi's.
That's where I have my lunch

70
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,052
Damn you! Hurry up!

71
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,333
"I'd like to meet Raj.
- Sure, why not"

72
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:51,075
Anyone who hears about him
says the same thing

73
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,306
You were telling me
Raj's love story

74
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,008
Now tell me about the girl
in the love story

75
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,310
The girl?
It's Priya

76
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:08,691
"Actually, Priya is from Greece.
She was born and brought up there"

77
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,091
"After her graduation, she has
come to India, to her aunt"

78
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,101
Her first show was such
a big hit that...

79
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,752
What a difference between
Raj and Priya

80
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:20,092
How did they meet?

81
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,760
On the highway. During an accident.
- Accident?

82
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,766
"Yes, a real accident.
On the way to Mahabaleshwar..."

83
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,442
between Raj's truck
and Priya's car

84
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:09,811
Driver! Can't you drive?
There could have been an accident!

85
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,211
"It's your mistake, madam.
It's such a big truck..."

86
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,548
Well? Can't you drive?
What if there was an accident?

87
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,225
Who gave you a licence?
- Licence!

88
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,837
You're talking in English. Do you
think the driver will understand?

89
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:38,242
"You know Hindi, don't you?"

90
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,262
"Maybe he's a mute, Priya"

91
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,526
Raj...
- Shut up!

92
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:05,861
He's not a mute!
You asked me to shut up!

93
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,263
Not you. Him

94
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,277
"You can ask your help to shut up,
you can glare at me..."

95
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,879
but you can't say sorry!
You guys are all alike!

96
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,891
Look...
- Me? You ought to look...

97
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,892
how you were driving the truck!

98
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,890
Down! Down!

99
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:39,303
"Not down, it's behind
- My car was coming up from behind"

100
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:43,307
I only overtook your truck.
- Your car's going away from behind

101
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,907
"Tell me, where was
my car coming from?"

102
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,906
It's gone now

103
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:03,322
"You said it was coming from behind,
I said it was moving from behind..."

104
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,329
it's gone

105
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:36,952
"As Salim's bride, you look
just like Anarkali today"

106
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,360
Here's your gift

107
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,360
Well? You seem to be in
a poetic mood today?

108
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,961
"Yes, you do appear changed.
- A double opportunity"

109
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,973
"At a Muslim wedding, I can
get to be poetic..."

110
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,373
and it's about what happened
to me on my way here

111
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,969
What happened on the way?
- An accident with a girl

112
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,382
"Really? Is all well?
- All is not well, Salim!"

113
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:02,614
"It surely is not!
I met the girl, I lost the girl"

114
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,980
I don't know if I will
ever see her again

115
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:09,988
But what a girl!
What a girl!

116
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:20,404
"She's the one!
Who's she, Salim?"

117
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,997
Which one?
- In that white dress!

118
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,506
"That's my friend, Priya.
- Lovely friend, I say!"

119
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:30,005
She's coming right here. Just ask
her how her journey was

120
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,514
What?
- No questions

121
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:33,675
"Divorce her, Salim. She asks
many questions. Just ask her!"

122
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,431
"Priya, how was your journey?"

123
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,369
I narrowly missed having a
huge accident with a truck

124
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,441
I even stopped the truck.
But the driver was so weird!

125
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:04,039
"Truck-drivers are an insolent lot.
- No, he wasn't insolent"

126
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,443
"I kept swearing at him,
but he just looked at me"

127
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,455
What happened then?
- As usual...

128
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:15,721
I forgot to use the handbrake
and the car landed in a ditch

129
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,457
"He could've stopped your car, I think.
- No..."

130
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,064
he came forward to stop the car.
But I couldn't understand...

131
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:28,469
and I prevented him.
- So he wasn't bad at heart?

132
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,407
"Yes, that's what I've
been thinking about too"

133
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,478
"I should've said thank you
to him, shouldn't I?"

134
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,480
So say it now

135
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,424
Maybe you can't recognise me.
Must I wear a lungi and kurta?

136
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,087
I was the one

137
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,094
"Although he looks like a
truck-driver, he isn't one"

138
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,903
He has a transport business.
- A small one

139
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,509
"This is Priya, my special friend.
- I've already met her..."

140
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,906
but it's nice to meet you
all over again

141
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,111
"Let's have a photograph.
- Oh sure, come on"

142
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,512
"Sarah, step aside...
over here..."

143
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:24,528
"I was angry then,
but I realised later..."

144
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,929
that I was in the wrong.
- I knew it all the time...

145
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:31,535
that you were in the wrong.
- I said so much to you...

146
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,798
in a fit of anger.
- You said so much!

147
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,463
But you were still silent

148
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:41,144
"When you're angry, there's
a strange sparkle in your eyes"

149
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,541
"There really is. You can't notice it,
because you're angry"

150
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,552
And I kept looking at it.
I didn't pay attention...

151
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,146
to what was right or wrong

152
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,150
I seek your forgiveness
for what happened

153
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:00,157
Saying sorry won't do.
- Then?

154
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,563
You're getting a punishment.
- Punishment?

155
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,570
What punishment?
- Your punishment is...

156
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:09,174
you're going from Mahabaleshwar
to Mumbai with me tomorrow

157
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,835
In the truck.
- The truck?

158
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,171
How can I?
- Don't refuse

159
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:19,182
"You called me a menace to society,
I really felt bad"

160
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:23,584
I was deeply hurt.
You can't refuse me. Please...

161
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,210
"Sorry, it was a fly"

162
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,619
A colourful world...

163
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,217
and people from all across

164
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,225
To meet and separate...

165
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,235
is part of destiny

166
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,642
Witness to games like this...

167
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:32,653
"there's a flutter
in my heart"

168
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,278
"In a hundred hues, the world
is a unique place to be in"

169
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,281
So don't hold back your heart

170
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,684
"To the land of love,
let's go"

171
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,683
"I'm going there anyway.
So walk with me"

172
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,733
"When your scarf flies,
unfurled..."

173
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,732
our path is lit up

174
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,337
"When my scarf flies,
unfurled..."

175
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,744
our path is lit up

176
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:05,078
"At every turn,
there's a new story..."

177
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,752
for you and me

178
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,748
On our path...

179
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,351
we hum

180
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,362
"The blowing winds
say to us..."

181
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:28,773
"where are you, O travellers?
Come to us"

182
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,368
"To the land of love,
let's go"

183
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,782
"I'm going there anyway.
So walk with me"

184
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:04,808
"O Madhav,
where are you headed?"

185
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,209
I go to where my bride is

186
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,839
The clouds meet the mountains...

187
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,434
the bees meet the buds

188
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:51,447
"The river flows
in gay abandon..."

189
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,849
to meet the ocean

190
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,853
Slowly...

191
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,866
slowly...

192
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,870
"the songs of love
that flow in the streams..."

193
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:10,874
"make the birds sing
in harmony..."

194
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:14,878
"Tis the season to meet,
listen to what it says..."

195
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:20,478
"To the land of love,
let's go"

196
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:25,889
"I'm going there anyway.
So walk with me"

197
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,954
Get down!

198
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:34,958
"What's up, constable?
Why did you ask me to stop?"

199
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,961
Why? Can't you see the road?

200
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,554
"What happened?
- Nothing, I'll handle it"

201
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:46,561
This is the first time I see a boy
romancing a girl in a truck!

202
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:49,063
Nice style.
- What style?

203
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:52,233
The boy will take the girl in whatever
he has. What's your problem?

204
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:56,279
"I'm not the one with a problem, son.
See that board? What does it say?"

205
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:00,243
I can't see things at a distance.
- Can't you?

206
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,979
I'll tell you. No entry

207
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,983
"Get the truck out of here. Go on.
- Two minutes, sir"

208
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,994
I'll drop her a bit further
and catch the highway from there

209
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,993
"You think traffic laws are a joke?
- Raj, don't worry"

210
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,592
I'll go on my own.
- Hear that?

211
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:21,000
The poor girl says she'll go all alone!
- But I'm here at her service!

212
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:25,608
Get that truck out of here! At once!
- All right

213
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:29,009
Is this also a no-bye zone?
Can I at least say bye? Please?

214
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,138
Go ahead

215
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:40,280
This is for you... a sugarcane

216
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,634
What are you standing around for?
Go after the girl

217
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,037
"You get that truck out of here.
- Okay, you..."

218
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,643
I'll call later

219
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:12,321
I'll call later

220
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:19,056
One moment...
He says he'll phone you later

221
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:22,662
But he didn't even
take my telephone number

222
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,660
You didn't take her number?
- No

223
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:28,662
"So take it!
- Yes, one second"

224
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,075
What are you up to?
- Ask her... the number?

225
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,078
What's the number?

226
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,685
Talk clearly.
- I did. It's 3

227
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,190
Why're you yelling?

228
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,696
It's okay

229
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:01,036
Say bye-bye.
Say bye

230
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
That's enough. Go away

231
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,249
What?

232
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:55,158
"Where have you been, Priya?
- Auntie! Just try this step!"

233
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:00,163
You were supposed to be here at noon.
And it's 6 already

234
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:02,426
Have you ever stolen
sugarcane from the fields?

235
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:07,161
Did you steal this one?
- When did I say...

236
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:10,173
I stole sugarcane from the fields?
And that the farmer ran after me?

237
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,176
With a huge stick!
- Are you all right?

238
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,179
"Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, aunt. I'm perfectly okay!"

239
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,178
Now go and take a bath.
You look so dirty

240
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,775
"All right. But there's water
in the hand-pump, I hope?"

241
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:24,445
"Yes, there is
Handpump?"

242
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,191
There's water in the shower!
What's gotten into this girl?

243
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:29,783
She's going to drive me mad some day

244
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:34,197
Was that Priya's voice?
- She's gone for a bath

245
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,291
I've been waiting for her all day
and you didn't even tell her?

246
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:42,206
"I forgot, son. She was
saying strange things"

247
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:45,940
I'll go and tell her right now.
- Not you. I'll give her a surprise

248
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:55,213
"The large-hearted men
will leave with the bride"

249
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,822
"Nandu, you're always singing
that song. Sing this one..."

250
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:15,238
Nice song.
- Nice? So sing it

251
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:25,845
"The large-hearted men
will leave with the bride"

252
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:29,249
"You have no hopes, Nandu.
That's the song you will always sing"

253
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,855
"I'm happy singing this one.
One life, one girl..."

254
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:37,257
"one love and one song.
- That's my principle, too"

255
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,854
"One life, one girl,
one love and one song"

256
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,361
So that's how Raj and Priya met?
- Met?

257
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,565
That was only their first meeting

258
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:54,869
"If lovers had to meet so easily,
there wouldn't be any love stories"

259
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,874
"When they loved each other so much,
where was the problem?"

260
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:05,884
Where? Problem was the piece of
paper on which Raj wrote Priya's number

261
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:10,294
This is the limit! You should at
least check before you wash my clothes!

262
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:15,890
Every washerman always checks the
pockets before he washes any clothes...

263
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,696
to see if someone has left
some money in it

264
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:22,305
"In these five years, I couldn't
find a penny in your pockets"

265
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,898
And now I've stopped checking.
- Have you?

266
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:30,912
"Raj, I've made some piping
hot dhokla. Come to our place"

267
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,916
"Sister-in-law, no dhoklas...
Manubhai, ask her to leave"

268
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:37,915
"Go away, Savita. You know what
tension we have here?"

269
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,921
We're trying to find Priya's number

270
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:44,327
Who's that friend Priya has in Pune?
- Farah

271
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,920
Farah! Call her up and
take the number from her

272
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:48,930
Farah and Salim have
just been married

273
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,569
"They're away on a honeymoon,
I don't know where"

274
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:56,932
What's this? How did my shirt
land in Raj's house?

275
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:01,341
See? I've been looking for this
shirt and it's lying here!

276
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,607
You're worried about the shirt?
I have a problem. Give me an idea

277
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:06,947
"Your problem, you will solve.
This is what Ganpat does!"

278
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:10,354
We'd rather hand him to the police.
- Police?

279
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:27,371
How often will you say that?
A telephone number has eight digits!

280
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,372
It's difficult for me.
- Why?

281
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:33,372
I'm a traffic cop. I've got to remember
just four digits of a car number

282
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,777
So what am I supposed to do?
- Why don't you go to her house?

283
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:41,976
So you're scared of the
girl's father. Aren't you?

284
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,385
I'd be scared if I knew where she
lives. That was our first meeting

285
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,392
"And you're the one who stopped me.
- This sure is a mess, I say"

286
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:53,988
"She surely lives in this area. She
walked home the other day, didn't she?"

287
00:30:54,299 --> 00:31:00,397
You're right. Know what?
We'll ask the betel-leaf seller

288
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:12,415
Tell him.
- I'm looking for a girl

289
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,417
She lives somewhere around.
I'll tell you how she looks...

290
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:21,418
"Tiwari, I'm busy making betel-leaf.
I don't look at girls"

291
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,428
You know Laxman?
He still keeps ogling at girls

292
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:28,656
Take him there.
You'll get to know

293
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:32,428
"No, Tiwari. I look only at Radha.
No one else"

294
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:36,037
"Think about it, Laxman! Think!
- Don't be scared of me"

295
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,438
The poor guy's so desperate.
Tell him if you know

296
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:41,441
But I don't know.
- It all happened because of me

297
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:45,039
"But I was doing my duty...
and I've said sorry, haven't I?"

298
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:49,449
I have an idea. Postman Ganga
can give you the address

299
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,455
He's right! Let's go

300
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:56,050
Give me a chocolate.
- Take my heart instead

301
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:06,061
Priya Chopra? There's one Chopra
who lives in Swapnalok

302
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,401
"He has two sons,
but he has no daughters"

303
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:13,067
"Ganga, there's a Chopra
in Akashganga too, right?"

304
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:15,475
"He has a daughter too, right?
- Yes, doesn't he have a daughter?"

305
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:17,079
One moment

306
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:24,087
"Rustom, that girl is eight years old.
Eight years"

307
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,490
"No, mine is a bit older.
- Older, isn't she?"

308
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:30,726
There's another Chopra
who has just one daughter

309
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,088
But she lives in Australia
with her aunt

310
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,898
That's good!
Priya lives with her aunt too!

311
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:41,504
So tell me the aunt's name.
- Sure. The aunt's name...

312
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:44,101
I don't know.
- He doesn't know

313
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:48,106
"He doesn't know anything, Tiwari.
How are we going to find her?"

314
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,745
"So what are we going to do, Raj?
He doesn't know anything either"

315
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,512
"Do what? Whatever anyone says,
I'm sure..."

316
00:32:56,121 --> 00:33:00,524
"I'll find my Priya.
Aunt, or no aunt"

317
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:06,120
"How will he find her?
No name, no whereabouts..."

318
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:11,125
he'll find her!
Just like that! In thin air!

319
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,134
Missing...

320
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,547
someone's gone missing

321
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,542
where is she?

322
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:41,161
"I was right here,
so was she"

323
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:45,568
"I'm right here again,
but she isn't here"

324
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,569
Missing...

325
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:02,178
"She's beautiful to look at.
She stays somewhere around..."

326
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,185
but she has gone missing

327
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:10,588
"She's a fairy,
an alluring beauty..."

328
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,595
she has gone missing

329
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:19,599
"I look for her with
all my heart and soul..."

330
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:31,205
"I've looked for her all over
the world, I wonder where she is"

331
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:34,617
Missing...

332
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:10,650
O beloved...

333
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:14,654
"come unto my heart,
O beloved"

334
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:19,254
"I was ignorant
in matters of the heart"

335
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:31,670
"But that girl has
driven me crazy"

336
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:36,270
"Everywhere I look,
I think I see her..."

337
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:40,015
"it's her face
my eyes see all the time"

338
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:44,283
"What restlessness is this?
What's all this fuss about?"

339
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,681
Missing...

340
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:28,330
"Take me to that girl
somehow, my friends"

341
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,737
"Give me all the happiness
I've lost"

342
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,744
"Show me where she lives
and I'd give up my own house"

343
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:49,347
"If I meet her now,
I'll take her for my own"

344
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,754
"When will the poor man's
desires be fulfilled?"

345
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,753
Missing...

346
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,370
"She's beautiful to look at.
She stays somewhere around..."

347
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,373
but she has gone missing

348
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,775
"She's a fairy,
an alluring beauty..."

349
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,784
she has gone missing

350
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:27,184
"I look for her with
all my heart and soul..."

351
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:31,385
"I've looked for her all over
the world, I wonder where she is"

352
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:34,794
Missing...

353
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:04,284
"For 20 days, you've
been looking for me?"

354
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:07,089
"Every place, morning and night.
But I've found you at last"

355
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:10,430
Can I ask you out for dinner
and a drive after that?

356
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,666
"I can't go with you, Raj.
- Why not?"

357
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,996
I'm going to Athens tonight.
- Athens?

358
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:18,971
"Participating in the Olympics?
- Stop joking, Raj"

359
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,178
My folks will wait there for me.
- So we'll call make an excuse

360
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:26,108
No excuse will work.
It's necessary for me to go

361
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:29,784
What could it be that they can't
manage without you? What?

362
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,616
"I'm getting engaged, Raj.
- All right, so?"

363
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,711
And I thought you perhaps
like me

364
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:02,385
"Of course I like you, Raj.
And that's why I'm here"

365
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,020
So what's this about an engagement
and wedding? Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,494
How could I? It was all
decided only last week

367
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,297
Last week?
- Yes

368
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,159
"Papa called to ask whether I could
get engaged, and I agreed"

369
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:24,641
And you agreed to marry a man
you don't even know

370
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:28,509
I'm sure he doesn't even have
a truck driving license

371
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:34,315
"Sameer is a childhood friend, Raj.
I know very well"

372
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,255
How am I to blame if we didn't meet
in our childhood?

373
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,249
But get to know me now.
See what I'm worth

374
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:47,525
Please give me one chance.
You can decide anything after that

375
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,867
"Raj, this isn't how one
takes decisions in life"

376
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,206
Nor does one lead his life
the way you think

377
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:59,874
"There's something called commitment.
From London, Paris, America..."

378
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,202
my relatives from all over the
globe are arriving in Athens

379
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:04,538
"In fact, they must already
be there by now"

380
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,873
"It's necessary for me
to get there, Raj"

381
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,547
And what happens of me?

382
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,327
"You're a very nice boy, Raj.
You'll surely find a nice girl"

383
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:25,893
"I did, but she's talking
about going away too"

384
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:29,564
To Athens

385
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,821
"Raj, I must leave now"

386
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,589
Can I drop you somewhere?

387
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,267
You already have

388
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:21,917
"Moti, it happened when
you weren't even born yet"

389
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:26,222
That is where she lived

390
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:29,629
And this is where I sat
to look at her every day

391
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:37,097
"At the window, at the door,
coming and going"

392
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,980
"And one day, she went away
with someone else"

393
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,646
"It was my mistake too.
I wish, I had told her that I..."

394
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,651
maybe...

395
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,363
"When she was leaving as a bride,
everyone sang..."

396
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:06,333
"The large-hearted man will
take the bride away"

397
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:09,134
I sang with them too

398
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:24,146
Priya's the one who's going to Greece.
Why are you packing your bags?

399
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,479
I'm packing my bags because
I'm going away to Greece too

400
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:29,349
Stop arguing and pack my bag.
Get on with it!

401
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:34,688
"It's Greece, not a suburb where
you can go away in a jiffy"

402
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:38,698
"I have decided. For Priya, I can
reach any part of the globe in a jiffy"

403
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:41,504
"I've told Vivek, he's bringing
my visa to the airport"

404
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,504
Please pack this.
- That's all right...

405
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:47,606
but what are you going for?
- Why? Priya's getting engaged!

406
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:52,109
"You're going to stand in attendance?
- Priya is not yet engaged, okay?"

407
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,441
I don't want to argue with you.
Sister-in-law...

408
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,710
"you see Nandu every day, don't you?
Years ago..."

409
00:42:57,054 --> 00:43:00,387
he didn't stop his girlfriend.
He sits with a bottle and a dog...

410
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:06,061
"and laments every day,
If only I had stopped her once"

411
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:09,729
"I don't want to say,
If only all my life"

412
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,397
Give me my credit cards.
- Sure... it's in the drawer

413
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:17,139
It's my last chance to win Priya.
- You'll end up losing money you saved

414
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:19,466
You're talking like Manubhai now!

415
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,211
What will I do with the money
if Priya's not with me?

416
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:26,482
"No, it's not that. The truck
owners association is meeting tomorrow"

417
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:30,218
"You must attend, or they'll
cut off your subsidiary"

418
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:34,012
"Not subsidiary, it's subsidy.
- Right, it'll be cancelled"

419
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:36,417
To hell with the subsidy!
- What rubbish!

420
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:38,752
Is this the way to do business?

421
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:42,092
"Manubhai, I don't know
how business is done"

422
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:44,758
But love surely is done like this

423
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:48,231
"My foot, love is done like this!
Hear that?"

424
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:50,403
Is this how love is done?

425
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:05,221
"You?
- Yes, I'm going to Greece too"

426
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:07,581
"I mean, I'm coming.
- Suddenly?"

427
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,784
"What can I do, Priya?"

428
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:15,124
"Actually, I heard a love story
when I was a little boy"

429
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:19,469
"The heroine is leaving the hero,
and the hero gives up hope"

430
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:25,140
"All his life, he thinks he should
have atleast tried to stop her"

431
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:27,467
Maybe things would
have been different

432
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:31,475
"I know, I don't stand a chance..."

433
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:35,183
but I don't want to lament it
all my life

434
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,216
"I've made you see reason, Raj...
- I have seen reason, Priya. I have"

435
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:42,148
But my heart won't

436
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:46,156
Sit down. We're on
the same aircraft now

437
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:58,167
We're together.
- So? What am I to do?

438
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:02,506
I wondered if I could sit here?
- You'll sit on me?

439
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,250
"Why would I sit on you, Uncle?
I mean, I have another seat 3C"

440
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:09,576
You see that auntie sitting there?

441
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:14,521
"Over there? I'm not sitting there.
- Please, Uncle..."

442
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:17,327
"I told you, I'm not sitting there.
Go away"

443
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:22,555
Haven't you gone?
- I'm about to

444
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,706
"Actually, I wanted to sit
with that girl there"

445
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:40,882
She's a friend.
- So what am I to do?

446
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:46,880
I was wondering if you could sit
there and I could call her over?

447
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,554
I actually requested that
gentleman so much

448
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:54,558
But he wouldn't agree.
He's a terribly grumpy man!

449
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:57,493
I know. He's my husband

450
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:05,268
"The two of you ought to sit together,
isn't it? Husband and wife?"

451
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:07,907
"For a week now, we've been
having a fight"

452
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:31,791
This is terrible!

453
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,008
You have a cellphone?

454
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:55,344
"Papa, you know how bad the
weather in Athens is"

455
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:59,746
The flight is delayed
by eight hours

456
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:04,354
"Please make everybody
see reason, Papa"

457
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:27,040
"That boy has been playing for so long,
but no one is giving him any money"

458
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:29,514
Know why?
- Why?

459
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,051
"There's nothing in his music,
his tune, his talent..."

460
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,724
So you know a lot about music?
- Don't you remember Mahabaleshwar?

461
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:44,865
"To the land of love,
let's go?"

462
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:50,636
You know how well I sing. I'll wake
you up with a song every morning...

463
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:55,241
and put you to sleep with a lullaby.
I'll be your walking-talking radio

464
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:13,624
What an ugly dog! How horrifying!

465
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,092
Exactly. Such a cutely ugly dog

466
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,330
"Oh yes, sweetly ugly"

467
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,640
You like it?
- Yes

468
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:29,636
You want it?
- Yes

469
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:31,978
May I get it for you?

470
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,675
You have amazing aim.
Maybe the cans are at the wrong place?

471
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:05,481
"No, I was only practicing.
Just watch now"

472
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,619
Go ahead and laugh

473
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,152
"While you aim, I'll have an ice-cream.
- I'll do it right now"

474
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,497
"You can't do it, Raj.
- Of course, I can"

475
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,162
"Raj, you can't do it!"

476
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,774
"Raj, you can't do it"

477
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:40,512
I know I can't do it.
But what can I do?

478
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:13,549
Is that true?
- Lies

479
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:15,908
So how did you get this?
- That uncle gave it away to me

480
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:18,220
Just like that?
- Not just like that

481
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:21,752
He gave it away when he saw
how much I love you

482
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:24,117
But I regret...
- What happened?

483
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:27,624
A stranger in an alien land
understands my feelings

484
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,559
"But the one who ought to,
does not"

485
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:33,025
"Priya, I have decided.
- What?"

486
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:35,668
"After our marriage, one meal
I will cook on my own"

487
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,372
I'll take care of the kids too

488
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:52,251
I know a bit of homeopathy too.
You'll never have coughs and colds

489
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:55,251
"Your minor ailments,
I'll drive away in a jiffy"

490
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:03,055
"I am mechanic anyway, right?"

491
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,972
"That woman's wish will
be fulfilled, Raj!"

492
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,946
"Funny. Toss a coin in the lake,
get a naked kid to fetch it..."

493
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:26,654
"and your wish will be fulfilled.
- People here believe that, Raj"

494
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,515
Do you believe it?
- Yes. Do you have a coin?

495
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:34,291
"I have a coin of the commission.
Don't lose it, okay?"

496
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:07,126
"Look over there, idiot"

497
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:00,710
Found it!

498
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:12,084
Why did you jump into the water?
- To get the coin

499
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:15,057
I know. But who asked you to?

500
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:18,059
"Your face did.
- I'm not joking, Raj"

501
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:21,064
"Neither am I. The expression on
your face said, "Raj, take a jump"

502
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:23,202
And Raj took the jump!

503
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:40,883
"Nice photograph, isn't it?"

504
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:46,889
What did you ask for
at the wishing well?

505
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:50,423
Nothing.
- Oh come on. Tell me

506
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:57,601
I asked to reach home on time

507
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,603
That?
- Yes

508
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,083
Know what I'd have asked for?
- I know

509
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,013
"This is a new one...
- I know, Raj..."

510
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:15,689
Listen to it once...
- I don't want to

511
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,654
Listen Priya...

512
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:23,164
You didn't realise...

513
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:25,968
the crazy lover that I am...

514
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:31,270
"I had brought to you
my heart as a gift"

515
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:36,473
To the story of my heart...

516
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:42,479
"please listen,
lend me your ear..."

517
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,219
"choose me as your
companion"

518
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,732
You're silent...

519
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:09,564
and I wonder...

520
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:16,169
"how I will tell you
the secret"

521
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:20,573
I could die for you...

522
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:23,249
I speak the truth...

523
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:28,922
"ask for my life,
if you will"

524
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,160
"Please listen,
lend me your ear..."

525
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,797
"choose me as your
companion"

526
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,905
I'm lonely...

527
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,141
you're lonely too

528
00:58:29,686 --> 00:58:35,647
"lmagine how would things be,
if we got together?"

529
00:58:37,994 --> 00:58:42,124
"Every goal, had we crazy lovers..."

530
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:47,667
to take the caravan of our love...

531
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:53,670
"please listen,
lend me your ear..."

532
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:59,081
"choose me as your
companion"

533
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:06,479
You didn't realise...

534
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:09,508
the crazy lover that I am...

535
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,448
"I had brought to you
my heart as a gift"

536
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:20,758
To the story of my heart...

537
01:00:21,765 --> 01:00:26,168
"please listen,
lend me your ear..."

538
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:31,770
"choose me as your
companion"

539
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:05,474
"Not to worry, Priya.
I've made all enquiries"

540
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,936
Even if the flight is delayed
for another 12 hours...

541
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,269
there are several more places
we still haven't seen

542
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:13,480
"Look, I've even got the map.
The nightspots..."

543
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:16,809
It's very necessary for me
to get home

544
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:20,417
They must all be waiting for me

545
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:24,825
Papa had asked me to reach there
a day or two in advance

546
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:30,165
It's all my fault.
I have delayed everything

547
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,835
"Don't cry, please"

548
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:40,836
"You've got to get to Athens, right?"

549
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,409
I'll take you to Athens

550
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,244
Just don't cry

551
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:00,958
Not yet. Let me take you home first

552
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:03,589
What time have you got to be there?
- At eleven

553
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,861
I'll take you there by 7:30. C'mon.
- Are you going to drive all night?

554
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:12,664
Won't you be tired?
- Very much

555
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:17,870
"But once I've taken you there,
I'll get all the rest"

556
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:20,872
Let's go

557
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:33,285
We're home?
- Yes

558
01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:35,288
When?

559
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,491
Fourteen minutes ago

560
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:43,031
Why didn't you wake me up?

561
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:48,198
I thought of waking you.
But then I thought...

562
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,964
"if I woke you, you'd awaken..."

563
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:55,973
"and had you awoken,
you'd go away"

564
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:00,072
And if you had gone away...

565
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:03,316
how would I look at you
from so close?

566
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:11,784
"Raj, we have spent very little time
together. But it was beautiful"

567
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:15,294
So don't say such things
when you're going away

568
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:23,569
I'll get your luggage out

569
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:48,086
Are you keeping my jacket?
- No

570
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:53,359
I have a few things in this.
Look

571
01:04:55,038 --> 01:05:01,705
Our boarding passes from Mumbai.
I'll keep yours

572
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:07,542
And the amusement park tickets.
I'll keep one

573
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:14,048
The restaurant bills.
I'll keep these too

574
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:20,623
"This coin, you keep"

575
01:05:21,197 --> 01:05:23,256
I got it from the lake for you

576
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,407
All this?

577
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:36,068
When I miss you...

578
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,670
I'll have these things

579
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:43,748
And now for this photo

580
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:49,253
You keep it.
- No

581
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:54,385
We ought to be fair

582
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:00,433
You keep this part

583
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:08,333
Priya didi (didi: Sister)

584
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:10,111
"Didi, come!"

585
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:13,643
"Time to go away, isn't it?"

586
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:16,451
"But I had to go away, Raj"

587
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:18,584
True

588
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,528
"Make a wish, Priya.
- What?"

589
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:30,628
Just like that

590
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,537
"May you always be happy
in life, Priya"

591
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:43,138
"May you never have to say,
If only in life..."

592
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,239
like the hero of my story said

593
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,549
May you have everything
your heart desires

594
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:02,830
"Remember, Priya. There will be
a man in the world somewhere..."

595
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,157
who will be very happy...

596
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:11,163
because you are happy

597
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,344
"That's it, that's all"

598
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,180
Don't ask me to come in

599
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:32,194
I won't be able to refuse you

600
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,254
Nor will I be able
to go in

601
01:07:40,203 --> 01:07:44,003
"C'mon, Priya didi... c'mon!"

602
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:57,035
Very fine. Congratulations
on your daughter's engagement

603
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,077
"Thank you.
- Where's she, by the way?"

604
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:01,614
Where is she?
- She'll be here any moment

605
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,614
She's not ready yet?
- She's a girl

606
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:12,284
It takes time for them
to get ready

607
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,091
"I know I don't
stand a chance, Priya"

608
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:22,294
"But I don't want to say
If only all my life"

609
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:26,471
"I tried to make you see reason, Raj...
- I see reason, Priya. I see it"

610
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:29,304
But my heart won't

611
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:34,139
"A stranger in an alien land
understands my feelings..."

612
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:38,114
"but the one who must understand,
won't understand"

613
01:09:38,488 --> 01:09:40,718
"Priya, I have decided.
- What?"

614
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:43,114
"After our marriage,
I'll cook one meal for us"

615
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:46,326
I'll look after the kids too

616
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:07,912
"Remember, there will be someone
happy somewhere in the world..."

617
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:10,749
because you are happy

618
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:44,683
"Papa, I have something
to tell you"

619
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,418
"What is happening, grandma?"

620
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:30,598
Why have you to think so much?

621
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,430
"You're not going to
do as she says, will you?"

622
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:39,039
Priya's marrying Sameer
and Sameer alone

623
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:42,804
"Auntie, Priya won't be
happy with the marriage"

624
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:46,308
And I understand that pretty well.
- But Sameer...

625
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:52,645
"No, I don't want our marriage
to be based on a compromise"

626
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,626
"Sameer, I came here
for the engagement"

627
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:04,456
But how was I to know that
all this would happen on the way?

628
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:13,241
"I understand, Priya.
- You understand nothing, Sameer"

629
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:17,612
And why are you quiet?
You are the bride's father

630
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:19,647
Say something

631
01:12:27,256 --> 01:12:32,489
"My child, are you sure he's a nice
boy and that he'll keep you happy?"

632
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:36,490
Yes.
- Why don't you meet him?

633
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:40,298
What's gotten into all of you?
You even want to meet him now?

634
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,168
What's wrong in meeting him?
- He must be in the plane by now.

635
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:46,498
He left four hours ago

636
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:50,105
"No, aunt. He mustn't have gone away"

637
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:56,273
"Papa, if I know him well,
he must still be waiting for me"

638
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:05,721
May I and stop Raj? Please?

639
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,980
"Yours must be the first step
in our house, Priya"

640
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:19,189
What happened?
- One second

641
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,223
I'll go in for a while

642
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:24,231
Something important to do...
I'll be back soon

643
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,502
"Don't worry. I'll take you in.
I've married you, after all"

644
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:29,134
One minute

645
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,684
"I'm coming in, Raj.
- Wait..."

646
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:53,927
Let no one say that we didn't
complete the rituals

647
01:15:54,663 --> 01:15:57,689
"It's actually meant to be done
by my mother, but right now..."

648
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:13,710
Red ink

649
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,247
Let me do it

650
01:16:26,528 --> 01:16:28,519
This is also meant to be done
by someone elderly...

651
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:31,063
"but since I'm doing everything,
this one too..."

652
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:39,808
Now for this ritual.
I don't know who performs it...

653
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,842
but it's performed all right.
I know that

654
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,581
May I come over?
- Please

655
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:52,410
But mind your step.
Don't slip on the talcum powder

656
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:24,881
"Priya, this is our house"

657
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:42,797
It's nice

658
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,373
"You're already up, Raj?"

659
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:54,413
I didn't go to sleep all night

660
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,480
And I never got better sleep
than this

661
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:03,820
"What are you wearing, Raj?
- This is Allah Mian"

662
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,221
Allah Mian?
- God

663
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,996
You know Salim?
His mother gave it to me

664
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:15,936
"Know what? Whatever I ask Him for,
He gives it to me"

665
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:18,930
Like you. I have you

666
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:24,842
"You always carry Him with you?
- Yes, He's always with me"

667
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:30,642
I feel incomplete without Him

668
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:34,385
Won't you even give Him to me?

669
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,191
One moment

670
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:48,200
"God, if something
ever happens to me..."

671
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:51,366
if I'm no more...

672
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,866
do look after my Priya

673
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:58,211
Because even she doesn't know
how much I love her

674
01:18:59,882 --> 01:19:04,876
I love Priya very very much

675
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,191
We'll always remain together Raj

676
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:35,114
I didn't find a love story
like this even in fairytales

677
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:41,922
"Sorry guys, I'm late.
I'm sick of this traffic"

678
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:45,917
"I told you, you're never on time.
And they..."

679
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:54,463
"Salim, this is my fiancee Sheetal"

680
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:58,729
"This is Salim and that
is his wife, Farah"

681
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:02,604
We got stuck in the traffic...
- I told him

682
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:06,608
"No, it isn't about that. Actually,
while waiting for you..."

683
01:20:06,949 --> 01:20:09,611
I heard a wonderful love story.
- Which one?

684
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,943
Raj and Priya's love-story

685
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:19,621
I'd like to meet
Raj and Priya some day

686
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,486
Oh certainly

687
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,822
"You're very lucky, Sheetal.
- How come?"

688
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,762
Because today is the first wedding
anniversary of Raj and Priya!

689
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,975
It's their surprise party
we're going to today

690
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:43,374
Sonofagun! Couldn't you tell me
that over the phone?

691
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:46,381
"If I told you, the surprise
wouldn't be a surprise anymore"

692
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:49,190
"Let's go, we're getting late.
- But where is the party?"

693
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:52,494
On the terrace of their building.
C'mon

694
01:20:54,963 --> 01:20:56,260
"Come, come..."

695
01:20:57,766 --> 01:21:02,362
"Manubhai, why have you brought us here?
- Don't ask, just see what I've done"

696
01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:05,332
Now look...
- What will I look at in the darkness?

697
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,335
What's here anyway?

698
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,011
"I'm Sheetal, Deepak's fiance!"

699
01:21:22,124 --> 01:21:25,389
"When they told me about your
love story, I couldn't believe..."

700
01:21:25,727 --> 01:21:28,355
that someone could have a romance
like yours in our times!

701
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:38,836
"Manubhai, this surprise party
is great fun!"

702
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,847
"Quiet, quiet!"

703
01:21:50,652 --> 01:21:52,711
"For two hours, this is what
we were talking about..."

704
01:21:53,055 --> 01:21:56,752
"and you want to fight even here!
- Not me, Raj. You want to fight"

705
01:21:57,059 --> 01:22:00,460
Priya! You've changed so much
in the past one year

706
01:22:00,862 --> 01:22:03,524
You are the one who has changed?
- Have I?

707
01:22:03,865 --> 01:22:06,060
You're fighting with me
on our first wedding anniversary...

708
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:08,733
and you say I've changed?
- Do you think I like fighting...

709
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:13,235
with you on our first anniversary?
But you're not the man I got married to!

710
01:22:15,844 --> 01:22:17,778
You married the wrong man!

711
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,071
Just leave me then!

712
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,816
At least sweeten
each other's tongue first

713
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,892
Your turn. Come on!

714
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:09,923
Looks like the lady isn't
in a nice mood this morning

715
01:23:10,428 --> 01:23:13,022
You were even late in coming.
Is everything all right?

716
01:23:13,431 --> 01:23:16,161
I didn't sleep well last night.
- No? That's nice

717
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:18,628
Were you thinking about me?
- No

718
01:23:19,671 --> 01:23:22,105
I was thinking what a huge
nuisance marriage is

719
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,431
What does it mean?
- Problem if you marry...

720
01:23:24,642 --> 01:23:27,076
problem if you don't.
- What makes you say that?

721
01:23:27,412 --> 01:23:30,313
Look at Raj and Priya. It was
supposed to be a great love affair

722
01:23:30,648 --> 01:23:32,775
"But what happened?
- Yes, what happened?"

723
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:36,249
Hold on... are you talking
about last night?

724
01:23:38,656 --> 01:23:41,124
Every man and wife have
their share of problems

725
01:23:41,459 --> 01:23:43,450
That doesn't mean they aren't
happy with each other

726
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:46,459
I know Raj.
He loves Priya very much

727
01:23:46,798 --> 01:23:49,494
Loving your wife doesn't
make you a very nice husband

728
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:53,463
"Really? The way you talk, it seems as
if you've done a Phd on marriages"

729
01:23:53,805 --> 01:23:55,136
What?
- You haven't said this...

730
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,137
"to anyone else, have you?
- No"

731
01:23:57,442 --> 01:24:01,071
And please don't!
People will laugh at you

732
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:04,073
Raj and Priya love
each other very much

733
01:24:20,298 --> 01:24:24,029
Raj is always late. He knows
Priya doesn't like it at all

734
01:24:34,312 --> 01:24:37,372
Your son-in-law hasn't arrived yet?
- What can I do?

735
01:24:37,715 --> 01:24:41,378
I asked him before holding a ritual
for their peaceful future

736
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:45,849
But the boys nowadays!
- Praise the Lord!

737
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:51,325
His phone's not working

738
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:58,001
See your friend?
He's still missing

739
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:01,962
"He's late, but I'm sure
he'll come"

740
01:25:06,744 --> 01:25:11,545
"My child, the ritual is over
and your husband hasn't arrived?"

741
01:25:11,883 --> 01:25:15,216
He has already left the office.
He should be here any moment

742
01:25:15,553 --> 01:25:18,545
It was necessary for both of you
to be present at this ritual

743
01:25:19,757 --> 01:25:21,918
The auspicious hour has
passed already

744
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,028
We can't wait anymore

745
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:32,361
All right. You may do
as you think fit

746
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:39,499
We will now pray to God
to bless you both

747
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:55,148
This spinach looks delicious.
And the chickpeas smell great

748
01:25:55,493 --> 01:25:58,223
Nobody makes chickpea
like you do... enough

749
01:25:59,697 --> 01:26:01,460
Sit... down

750
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:07,999
"How will this do, Priya?
I've said sorry, sought forgiveness"

751
01:26:08,506 --> 01:26:10,599
It's all over...
at least talk to me now

752
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:13,811
How will it do if you don't talk?

753
01:26:16,848 --> 01:26:21,080
"All right. If you're not eating
with me, I'm not eating too"

754
01:26:25,823 --> 01:26:30,260
"Priya, talk to me! I told you,
I made a mistake. I'm sorry!"

755
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:33,826
"You say sorry, but how about the
ritual aunt Anna held for us?"

756
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:36,156
Do you realise how
insulted I felt?

757
01:26:38,836 --> 01:26:42,602
I was coming any way.
But Mr Malhotra showed up

758
01:26:42,941 --> 01:26:45,501
And you know how important
Mr Malhotra is for our business

759
01:26:45,843 --> 01:26:47,834
I know how important
your business is!

760
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:50,909
Where was your business when you
followed me all the way to Greece?

761
01:26:51,683 --> 01:26:54,914
It had to do with love then.
- With love?

762
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:57,551
So where is your love now?
- But we're already married

763
01:26:57,855 --> 01:27:00,050
"What does that mean, Raj?"

764
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:05,124
Just that one marries
the one he loves

765
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:07,454
"And love is always there,
or why would the marriage be?"

766
01:27:07,665 --> 01:27:10,259
"I mean, love goes in a bit of a
background after marriage..."

767
01:27:10,602 --> 01:27:13,867
"You're in love, I'm in love...
we're loved ones"

768
01:27:15,873 --> 01:27:17,864
Shit! What am I saying!

769
01:27:19,577 --> 01:27:22,546
"Priya, listen to me.
That wasn't what I meant to say"

770
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,541
I was confused

771
01:27:24,882 --> 01:27:27,715
"What I meant to say is that after
marriage, one becomes responsible"

772
01:27:28,052 --> 01:27:31,385
So you say you're responsible?
- Hundred per cent responsible!

773
01:27:31,723 --> 01:27:33,623
"You're hundred per cent
responsible, right?"

774
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:37,691
"This is your shirt, isn't it? But you
took it off and kept it on the sofa"

775
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:40,589
"If you wished, you could also keep
it with the laundry, couldn't you?"

776
01:27:40,898 --> 01:27:43,230
But you won't.
And your shoes always...

777
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:45,229
Which shoes?

778
01:27:48,673 --> 01:27:50,698
"What?
- You just picked them up, didn't you?"

779
01:27:51,776 --> 01:27:55,303
"You just picked them up, didn't you?
- All right, but I picked them up"

780
01:27:55,647 --> 01:27:58,013
Why wouldn't you do it earlier?

781
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:05,248
"All right, I won't smile! But let's
decide what you're complaining about!"

782
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:08,582
"That I'm late, I didn't get to the
temple, my shoes, my smile?"

783
01:28:08,926 --> 01:28:11,690
What is it that you complain about?
- I complain about everything you do!

784
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:14,590
"Everything?
- There's a way of living together, Raj"

785
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:17,332
Now hold on! You're going to
teach me to live together?

786
01:28:17,669 --> 01:28:19,603
The large-hearted one...

787
01:28:19,971 --> 01:28:25,034
Shut up! What silly song is that!
We're have a fight going here!

788
01:28:31,749 --> 01:28:34,616
I'm no kid for you to...

789
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:35,941
Shut up!

790
01:28:37,088 --> 01:28:39,613
"So stop lecturing me, please"

791
01:28:39,957 --> 01:28:42,289
"It's not wrong to point
someone's mistakes, Raj"

792
01:28:43,895 --> 01:28:44,953
Mistakes?

793
01:28:48,966 --> 01:28:52,129
"You say mistakes, Priya. But it's
not always my mistake"

794
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,200
You make mistakes several times
and I still say sorry

795
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:59,772
So you're saying you're perfect?
- Did I say that?

796
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:05,646
"I'm not perfect, Priya. You...
you think Nandu's perfect?"

797
01:29:05,983 --> 01:29:08,975
He's not.
None of us is perfect

798
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:14,349
I come back home after
a hard day's work...

799
01:29:14,692 --> 01:29:17,126
I feel like sitting down
and chatting with you...

800
01:29:17,762 --> 01:29:21,994
or the two of us having
a cup of coffee in the balcony

801
01:29:26,904 --> 01:29:29,998
You want romance?
And chat with me?

802
01:29:30,742 --> 01:29:32,403
With the tv on?

803
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:38,413
"I switched on the tv because...
- That's your daily routine, Raj"

804
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,446
You come home every day
and sit down before the tv

805
01:29:41,786 --> 01:29:44,448
I too want you to talk to me
when you come back home

806
01:29:44,789 --> 01:29:46,484
But you'll never understand...

807
01:29:48,025 --> 01:29:51,859
I've switched off the tv.
So let's talk. Please. Come on

808
01:29:52,196 --> 01:29:55,131
What did you do in the office today?
- Let's not talk about the office

809
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:58,361
Because I'm sick of office-talk
while I'm in the office

810
01:29:58,803 --> 01:30:01,499
"When I come back home, I feel like
talking about something else"

811
01:30:01,839 --> 01:30:04,467
But you talk of nothing else Raj.
You begin to watch tv!

812
01:30:04,809 --> 01:30:07,243
"But I only catch up with the news!
- News, Cricket match and!"

813
01:30:08,045 --> 01:30:11,503
"You're right and I'm wrong, okay?
- No, you're not wrong"

814
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:16,718
"I'm wrong! And I'm sorry!
- Please, Raj! Stop saying sorry"

815
01:30:17,054 --> 01:30:19,716
And I'm not going to forget
today's insult ever

816
01:30:20,057 --> 01:30:23,049
What insult?
And I can't even say sorry!

817
01:30:23,795 --> 01:30:25,786
I want to sleep.
- So sleep

818
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:28,054
Have your food and switch
off the lights

819
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:30,724
Why must I eat? You took away
my plate! And the lights?

820
01:30:31,068 --> 01:30:33,730
Why must you have everything your way?
The lights are not being switched off!

821
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:37,063
Let me see who switches them off!
- All right. Let the lights remain

822
01:30:52,089 --> 01:30:54,649
"Milkman, can't you come
a bit early?"

823
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:58,493
My husband's been pestering
me for tea all morning!

824
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:01,560
"But I can come only when the
Buffalo starts milking, right?"

825
01:31:01,899 --> 01:31:04,766
You have a new excuse every day.
If you don't come on time tomorrow...

826
01:31:05,102 --> 01:31:08,765
I'll stop your supply and
take milk from the dairy instead

827
01:31:09,106 --> 01:31:10,937
You get that?
- All right

828
01:31:14,812 --> 01:31:16,643
Milk for 2 rupees

829
01:31:18,115 --> 01:31:21,676
"Nandu, have you given up booze
and started drinking milk instead?"

830
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:26,786
Not for me. It's for Moti.
Can't you see how skinny he's become?

831
01:31:27,124 --> 01:31:28,455
Smell him

832
01:31:29,794 --> 01:31:34,231
He's in bad shape.
He needs calcium

833
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:44,103
"Your juice, Raj"

834
01:31:44,141 --> 01:31:46,473
Breakfast is lying on the table.
Have it before you leave

835
01:31:47,144 --> 01:31:49,408
There's no saying when
you'll have lunch anyway

836
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:53,642
"I just scrubbed the floor, Raj.
What are you doing?"

837
01:31:54,085 --> 01:31:56,815
What?
- You've wet the pillow

838
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:59,679
It's my pillow.
I use it

839
01:32:00,024 --> 01:32:01,651
And... all right

840
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,322
Is it okay now?

841
01:32:10,968 --> 01:32:13,436
"What's that now?
- You'll wet the bedsheet, Raj"

842
01:32:14,105 --> 01:32:17,165
What arguments do we get
caught up in every morning?

843
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:19,841
"I haven't started the argument, Raj.
- The way you..."

844
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:22,304
how will I do any work at
the office in this mood?

845
01:32:22,647 --> 01:32:24,672
Your mood gets spoilt
every now and then

846
01:32:25,182 --> 01:32:27,980
"But naturally, Priya!
It's because of what you say!"

847
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:31,345
You tell me how to go about
every little thing

848
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:34,852
"This isn't right. Don't keep
the shoe here, someone might trip"

849
01:32:35,192 --> 01:32:39,424
Must I keep the shoes on my head?
How's anyone going to trip on shoes?

850
01:32:39,897 --> 01:32:41,990
Do you fall over this ironing board
which is lying here?

851
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,597
Do you fall over the bed?
But you'll trip over the shoes

852
01:32:44,936 --> 01:32:47,871
"You're always picking on my shoes!
- What wrong have I said, Raj?"

853
01:32:48,205 --> 01:32:50,196
"I just want some cleanliness
to be maintained, isn't it?"

854
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,533
"What's wrong if our house is clean?
- It's wrong, very wrong!"

855
01:32:54,211 --> 01:32:56,304
I like to have my room littered

856
01:32:56,914 --> 01:32:59,883
"I want one of my shoes to lie here,
and one to lie there"

857
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:02,014
I want to see who
trips over them!

858
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:05,347
It's because I'm illiterate!
I'm a bloody bum!

859
01:33:05,756 --> 01:33:09,351
"I like to have my pillow
at my feet, not my head"

860
01:33:09,727 --> 01:33:12,560
And these blankets mustn't be
on the bed when I'm about to sleep

861
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:16,024
"And this towel, wherever I take it off
is the right place"

862
01:33:17,168 --> 01:33:20,695
"I agree, I don't know how to live.
I don't know it at all"

863
01:33:21,038 --> 01:33:23,563
Only you know it!
And what can I do?

864
01:33:23,941 --> 01:33:25,932
I got married for the first time!

865
01:33:28,012 --> 01:33:30,003
"It's my first marriage too, Raj"

866
01:33:31,115 --> 01:33:33,345
And throw away that bedsheet too

867
01:34:25,102 --> 01:34:26,763
"What are you doing, Priya?"

868
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:30,798
People are watching!

869
01:35:14,318 --> 01:35:17,947
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

870
01:35:19,356 --> 01:35:23,019
they make me crazy about you

871
01:35:24,895 --> 01:35:29,355
What secrets are you exposing...

872
01:35:30,101 --> 01:35:34,561
"what are you telling me
with your eyes?"

873
01:35:35,106 --> 01:35:38,371
You do wield all the magic

874
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:43,378
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

875
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:48,551
they make me crazy about you

876
01:35:50,187 --> 01:35:54,920
"You are the one who
touches my heartstrings"

877
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:59,852
Why would anyone meeting you...

878
01:36:00,231 --> 01:36:03,667
not lose her heart to you

879
01:36:30,728 --> 01:36:35,028
"Your lush body,
casts a spell"

880
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:40,027
"Your dense tresses
exude a fragrance"

881
01:36:40,504 --> 01:36:45,134
"On my breath
lingers a scent..."

882
01:36:45,643 --> 01:36:49,841
"because your eyes
are going astray"

883
01:36:50,214 --> 01:36:55,117
"Your body is as beautiful
as the rosegardens..."

884
01:36:55,786 --> 01:36:59,051
"the sight of it
drives me out of my senses"

885
01:37:00,324 --> 01:37:04,454
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

886
01:37:34,024 --> 01:37:38,290
"An intoxication
is taking over..."

887
01:37:38,729 --> 01:37:43,063
I'm barely in my senses

888
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,994
I'm lost to myself too...

889
01:37:48,505 --> 01:37:52,839
"I awake
but I feel as if I'm asleep"

890
01:37:53,177 --> 01:37:58,114
"Keep swaying,
keep melting..."

891
01:37:58,582 --> 01:38:02,040
when you are in my arms

892
01:38:03,354 --> 01:38:07,313
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

893
01:38:08,325 --> 01:38:12,318
they make me crazy about you

894
01:38:13,631 --> 01:38:18,534
"You are the one who
touches my heartstrings"

895
01:38:19,236 --> 01:38:23,639
Why would anyone meeting you...

896
01:38:24,008 --> 01:38:27,535
not lose her heart to you

897
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:32,342
"Goodness!
The signs you make..."

898
01:38:33,384 --> 01:38:37,548
they make me crazy about you

899
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:43,750
What secrets are you exposing...

900
01:38:44,495 --> 01:38:48,932
"what are you telling me
with your eyes?"

901
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:52,825
You do wield all the magic

902
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,604
Take care of this small car.
It might get lost

903
01:39:34,311 --> 01:39:36,939
Let me tell you again. Whenever
I go to your high society parties...

904
01:39:37,281 --> 01:39:41,081
it ruins my mood. Like my small car
here among big ones...

905
01:39:41,418 --> 01:39:43,978
I will also feel awkward...
small and out of place

906
01:39:44,321 --> 01:39:46,312
"Not again, Raj! Sameer has
invited us with such a lot of love"

907
01:39:46,623 --> 01:39:50,024
"I know, so you can go ahead. I'll go
to Irfan's garage in the neighbourhood"

908
01:39:50,361 --> 01:39:52,352
"Give me a call when the party is
over, I'll come and collect you"

909
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:55,154
"Raj, does it look nice for me to
go parties alone after my marriage?"

910
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:59,435
"You're not alone, it's your family,
your friends. What would I do?"

911
01:40:01,438 --> 01:40:03,303
"Okay, I'm going with you"

912
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:17,643
"Wow! You look extra beautiful
in that sari! What say, Raj?"

913
01:40:21,358 --> 01:40:23,349
You remember we went to Athens
during our vacations?

914
01:40:26,363 --> 01:40:28,661
"Of course, I remember. Know what, Raj?
There was a lovely lake by the house"

915
01:40:28,999 --> 01:40:31,524
In which Sameer and I went
boating all day

916
01:40:31,869 --> 01:40:36,806
"Remember, Sameer? We insisted with our
parents that we wanted that very house?"

917
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:41,301
I remember. And I've
fulfilled the condition

918
01:40:41,678 --> 01:40:44,169
"You mean, you?
- I've bought the house"

919
01:40:47,684 --> 01:40:50,482
You must see that house.
It was beautiful

920
01:40:52,489 --> 01:40:54,548
Why don't you take Raj there
for a holiday?

921
01:40:54,892 --> 01:40:56,883
Lt'll be a break
even for you Raj

922
01:41:11,408 --> 01:41:15,572
You talk about this? How about
the Versace suit you're wearing?

923
01:41:20,451 --> 01:41:23,978
The girl who marries you
is going to be really lucky

924
01:41:32,529 --> 01:41:34,520
What are you guys playing
the boring couple for?

925
01:41:39,536 --> 01:41:41,731
"Must I ask for permission?
Please let me, sir!"

926
01:42:10,767 --> 01:42:14,259
"How's my suit?
- It's nice, sir"

927
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:16,898
I got it stitched during my wedding

928
01:42:19,776 --> 01:42:22,973
"How about my watch?
- It's nice too, sir"

929
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:43,162
"Ramji, tell me what price
you're selling ladyfinger for"

930
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,663
10 rupees for a quarter kilo.
- You think we're industrialists?

931
01:42:51,475 --> 01:42:54,467
I hope you liked it Rustom Uncle?
- I loved it

932
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:56,802
"Your biscuits were nice
too, sister-in-law"

933
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:59,471
"They were from my shop.
- This is for you, Radha"

934
01:42:59,816 --> 01:43:02,614
Aunt! What a pleasant surprise!

935
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,818
"Do come again, okay?
- Very well. Good bye"

936
01:43:12,829 --> 01:43:14,421
Aunt!

937
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:19,358
"Tell me what you'll have.
Tea, coffee?"

938
01:43:19,703 --> 01:43:21,261
I don't want anything

939
01:43:21,605 --> 01:43:24,130
Do these people come
even to your house?

940
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,643
They hadn't seen me in a
long time and came over...

941
01:43:27,978 --> 01:43:31,505
to ask about my well-being.
But tell me how you have been!

942
01:43:31,848 --> 01:43:34,248
"I'm all right.
- Hello, sister-in-law"

943
01:43:34,585 --> 01:43:36,610
How many eggs?
- 6. Keep them in the refrigerator

944
01:43:38,855 --> 01:43:42,518
"Be careful, don't break the eggs.
- Very well, sister-in-law"

945
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:47,654
"What's happening here, Priya?
Vegetable sellers and egg sellers!"

946
01:43:47,998 --> 01:43:49,989
Are these the only people left
in your life?

947
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:53,565
"Hello, Lady. Your clothes.
- You got my sari, Ganpat?"

948
01:43:53,904 --> 01:43:56,304
Of course.
- All right. Keep it here

949
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,631
I'll take it in later.
- Very well. Good bye

950
01:43:58,875 --> 01:43:59,864
Good bye

951
01:44:00,444 --> 01:44:03,538
Priya! You even know
your laundryman's name?

952
01:44:04,615 --> 01:44:05,604
"Yes, aunt"

953
01:44:05,983 --> 01:44:08,508
What kind of a life
are you leading?

954
01:44:08,885 --> 01:44:13,515
What have you come to?
And I had such dreams for you

955
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:17,348
"There's nothing of the sort, aunt.
I'm very happy here"

956
01:44:17,694 --> 01:44:19,685
I'm starting my work
all over again and...

957
01:44:19,896 --> 01:44:23,696
"Raj is landing a new contract too.
- What new contract, Priya"

958
01:44:24,034 --> 01:44:27,936
"I've been hearing that for ages!
Anyway, I've made up my mind"

959
01:44:28,305 --> 01:44:30,569
I've brought you
two tickets to Greece

960
01:44:30,907 --> 01:44:32,898
Go and have a holiday

961
01:44:33,644 --> 01:44:37,045
"But how can I accept it, aunt?
I'm already married"

962
01:44:37,381 --> 01:44:40,248
Why can't you accept it?
I'm like your mother

963
01:44:40,651 --> 01:44:44,348
And a mother can give her daughter
anything and any amount she wants to

964
01:44:44,688 --> 01:44:47,122
You get that? It's her right

965
01:44:51,728 --> 01:44:56,927
"The large-hearted one
will leave with the bride..."

966
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:02,700
"Raj doesn't like my song and...
- No, Nandu. Go ahead and sing"

967
01:45:03,073 --> 01:45:07,942
Can I? Even in the night?
- You may sing all night

968
01:45:09,646 --> 01:45:12,615
So I'm going to sing
for Raj tonight!

969
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:17,283
"Raj, you sing so well too.
Join me in the nights"

970
01:45:17,754 --> 01:45:21,349
"I'm all alone.
- Some other time, Nandu"

971
01:45:21,692 --> 01:45:23,683
"Tonight, I have a programme
for romance"

972
01:45:24,027 --> 01:45:25,051
Really?

973
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:28,759
You provide the background music
and I'll get on with the romance

974
01:45:36,973 --> 01:45:38,964
Is this Mr Raj Mathur's house?

975
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:43,103
"Yes, but he's not in right now"

976
01:45:44,748 --> 01:45:48,309
What's the hurry? It's wonderful
that Raj Mathur is not at home

977
01:45:48,985 --> 01:45:51,317
Let me shut the door...
- You?

978
01:45:51,688 --> 01:45:55,647
I'm your immediate neighbour.
The building opposite yours...

979
01:45:55,992 --> 01:46:00,224
"third floor, third window.
- Oh yes, I've seen you"

980
01:46:00,564 --> 01:46:02,327
And I saw you watching

981
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:07,329
Know what? I've been waiting
for this opportunity for many days

982
01:46:07,938 --> 01:46:09,997
Frankly speaking... so was I

983
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:17,002
"What do you mean by "so was l"?
What?"

984
01:46:17,347 --> 01:46:18,678
I'll explain

985
01:46:19,015 --> 01:46:21,006
What are you doing?
- Taking advantage

986
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:23,819
What advantage?
- He hasn't any time from his trucks

987
01:46:24,154 --> 01:46:27,089
Lay off! Doesn't he have
to work and make money?

988
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:30,587
Let him make money. You come inside.
- With a stranger...

989
01:46:31,027 --> 01:46:33,222
"What's all this, Priya?
You're kidding, aren't you?"

990
01:46:34,965 --> 01:46:36,023
Mr Neighbour!

991
01:46:36,366 --> 01:46:39,802
I've never seen you
in this light before

992
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:42,799
"I'm very happy today, Raj.
- Always be happy"

993
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,040
But not with the neighbour

994
01:46:45,809 --> 01:46:47,800
I've got to give you 2 bits
of good news

995
01:46:48,044 --> 01:46:50,035
Give me the second one first

996
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:53,378
"Remember, I sent my designs
to an Australian company?"

997
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:55,574
They've approved

998
01:46:56,853 --> 01:46:58,844
And listen to the second
good news

999
01:47:00,757 --> 01:47:02,748
Tickets for Greece. Look

1000
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:10,055
Tickets for Greece?
You've won a jackpot?

1001
01:47:11,067 --> 01:47:13,297
Aunt Anna gifted it to us

1002
01:47:14,871 --> 01:47:16,065
Aunt Anna?

1003
01:47:17,207 --> 01:47:21,234
"Since we haven't been on a honeymoon,
she asked us to visit Greece, Raj"

1004
01:47:25,982 --> 01:47:29,611
What happened?
- Well... one second

1005
01:47:30,187 --> 01:47:32,087
What happened?
- One second

1006
01:47:32,622 --> 01:47:35,489
"Nothing.
- What happened, Raj? Tell me"

1007
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:38,851
"Priya, if you don't mind,
let me tell you something"

1008
01:47:39,095 --> 01:47:43,498
"We'll surely go to Greece,
but with our own money, okay?"

1009
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:46,769
"But this is our money too.
- No, it isn't our money"

1010
01:47:47,103 --> 01:47:49,765
It's Aunt Anna's money.
- But aunt's like our mother too

1011
01:47:50,106 --> 01:47:54,099
"No, Priya. For you, she is.
Not for me"

1012
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:57,375
Why're you making a prestige
issue out of this?

1013
01:47:57,714 --> 01:48:01,673
"C'mon, Priya! It hasn't to do
with prestige, honestly"

1014
01:48:02,118 --> 01:48:05,781
So what is it?
- What is it?

1015
01:48:07,123 --> 01:48:09,557
I'll tell you what it is

1016
01:48:09,893 --> 01:48:12,487
I've always got the feeling
that your folks...

1017
01:48:12,829 --> 01:48:15,923
are not very happy with our marriage.
That's how I feel

1018
01:48:16,266 --> 01:48:19,064
They probably think that if you
had got married to Sameer...

1019
01:48:19,402 --> 01:48:22,599
he could have given you everything
that I haven't been able to

1020
01:48:22,939 --> 01:48:25,203
And that's right too. There's
no question of prestige at all

1021
01:48:25,542 --> 01:48:28,340
"Raj, I think you haven't been able
to understand me at all"

1022
01:48:28,712 --> 01:48:30,703
Did I ever say anything
in this regard to you?

1023
01:48:30,881 --> 01:48:31,905
No.
- Did I ever complain?

1024
01:48:32,182 --> 01:48:35,310
So why must you misunderstand?
- Don't raise your voice!

1025
01:48:36,453 --> 01:48:38,444
You're the one who doesn't
get it right

1026
01:48:40,023 --> 01:48:41,957
You are the one they want
to send away on a holiday

1027
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:43,853
You are the one they pity

1028
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,151
You are the one they want to
see happy... not me or us

1029
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:50,293
They've got to tolerate me because
I am unfortunately their son-in-law!

1030
01:48:55,171 --> 01:48:57,162
I don't know why you
take things to such limits!

1031
01:48:57,507 --> 01:48:59,566
You think of things
that make no sense!

1032
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:03,846
Makes no sense?
For you it must be senseless

1033
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:07,877
"For me, it's a truth
I feel every day..."

1034
01:49:15,325 --> 01:49:17,350
"May we end this discussion here?
- Yes, please!"

1035
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,997
Are you going to sleep?

1036
01:49:46,022 --> 01:49:49,651
"Trouble with Priya again?
- No, no trouble with Priya"

1037
01:49:49,993 --> 01:49:52,689
"No, you do have trouble with her.
- Okay, okay"

1038
01:49:53,029 --> 01:49:56,362
"Last night, I had another
argument with Priya. Happy?"

1039
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:59,567
Happy my foot!
Now listen to me

1040
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:03,565
"When we buy a new truck, we have
a few problems initially, don't we?"

1041
01:50:03,907 --> 01:50:05,898
What are you talking about?
- Hear me out first!

1042
01:50:06,242 --> 01:50:08,676
"A new truck also stalls
when it heats up, doesn't it?"

1043
01:50:09,012 --> 01:50:10,843
"All right, it does.
- So what do we do?"

1044
01:50:11,047 --> 01:50:13,038
Don't we shut it down
and start it again?

1045
01:50:13,249 --> 01:50:15,911
So there's not much difference
between a truck and marriage

1046
01:50:16,252 --> 01:50:19,050
They ask for a bit of adjustment
which you've got to make...

1047
01:50:19,389 --> 01:50:22,916
and carry the story further. Right?
- How does one take it further?

1048
01:50:23,994 --> 01:50:26,929
Silly arguments! Are marriages
and trucks like each other?

1049
01:50:27,263 --> 01:50:29,697
Isn't it her fault too?
- Now get one thing clearly

1050
01:50:30,033 --> 01:50:32,934
"Between man and wife, never try to
find out who's right and who's wrong"

1051
01:50:33,269 --> 01:50:35,703
Just say sorry and finish
the matter there and then

1052
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:39,702
That's what I always do.
- I'm prepared to say sorry too

1053
01:50:40,043 --> 01:50:43,274
"I don't like fighting,
I don't want to fight"

1054
01:50:43,847 --> 01:50:46,213
"But the same rule applies
to her also, doesn't it?"

1055
01:50:46,549 --> 01:50:50,986
"Now look, now don't split hair.
I know the problems with you"

1056
01:50:51,388 --> 01:50:54,414
What's my problem? What?
- Want me start counting?

1057
01:50:56,292 --> 01:50:59,523
"I know, Manubhai. There are
problems with me too"

1058
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:03,295
That's exactly why I am asking
you to take my advise

1059
01:51:04,467 --> 01:51:07,959
"What am I to do, Manubhai?
- Go to Priya today..."

1060
01:51:08,304 --> 01:51:10,898
like the perfect husband.
The ideal husband

1061
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,302
Ideal?
- Like me

1062
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:19,445
Is it funny?

1063
01:51:31,327 --> 01:51:35,923
"Priya, I got this gourd,
ladyfinger, carrot..."

1064
01:51:36,332 --> 01:51:41,326
and other stuff from the vendor.
And this one too

1065
01:51:43,339 --> 01:51:47,605
I'll put all this in
the refrigerator

1066
01:51:48,344 --> 01:51:50,005
That is where it is kept

1067
01:51:50,346 --> 01:51:52,678
I bought it all
from the wholesale shop

1068
01:51:53,216 --> 01:51:56,344
The vendor there took me for a fool

1069
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,782
"I asked him for the price of carrots
and he says "30 rupees for a kilo"

1070
01:52:00,056 --> 01:52:04,015
"I asked him to give it at 20 rupees,
or I was leaving"

1071
01:52:05,128 --> 01:52:06,925
He gave it to me at once

1072
01:52:08,131 --> 01:52:10,361
How much would you buy it for?
- 10 rupees a kilo

1073
01:52:16,172 --> 01:52:19,699
But this is fresh... and red

1074
01:52:25,381 --> 01:52:28,612
"If there are any chores to
be done, just tell me"

1075
01:52:34,324 --> 01:52:38,192
I'll wash these utensils.
I'm in the mood today

1076
01:52:40,196 --> 01:52:44,565
I forgot to tell you about the office.
Manubhai came calling today

1077
01:52:45,201 --> 01:52:47,192
He had a cup of tea
and went his way

1078
01:52:49,272 --> 01:52:52,070
Mohammadbhai also came calling.
He had a cup of tea and...

1079
01:52:52,408 --> 01:52:54,899
he went his way too

1080
01:52:57,413 --> 01:53:01,816
And then came Vivek.
He asked me for two trucks

1081
01:53:02,152 --> 01:53:05,087
"I said I didn't have two trucks,
they're away for servicing"

1082
01:53:05,421 --> 01:53:08,618
"One had an axle broken,
another's bonnet wouldn't open"

1083
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:12,291
"And I said, I couldn't
give him the trucks"

1084
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:14,563
I asked him to have a cup of tea...
and go his way

1085
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:18,430
He went his way too

1086
01:53:19,369 --> 01:53:21,963
Everybody went his way
at the office today

1087
01:53:26,176 --> 01:53:30,442
Where do I keep these utensils?
- Keep it where you picked it up from

1088
01:53:32,115 --> 01:53:34,447
But here...
- They're washed utensils

1089
01:53:37,187 --> 01:53:38,984
I washed them

1090
01:53:39,455 --> 01:53:41,650
So I washed them again!

1091
01:53:42,325 --> 01:53:44,452
These big vessels
get dirty very soon

1092
01:53:44,794 --> 01:53:46,785
One must wash them
as often as one can

1093
01:53:48,298 --> 01:53:52,132
Look at this one...
gleaming!

1094
01:53:52,468 --> 01:53:58,134
"Raj, I know what you're trying to say.
But you needn't do all this"

1095
01:53:58,474 --> 01:54:01,466
That you realise it
is enough for me

1096
01:54:06,482 --> 01:54:08,814
"Go and sit down. Let me warm the food.
- No, we're having carrot halwa"

1097
01:54:09,152 --> 01:54:11,052
with our dinner tonight.
And I'm making it.

1098
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:14,948
Can you?
- But I'll keep trying till you hug me

1099
01:54:15,325 --> 01:54:18,488
And what's so great about carrot
halwa? Grate a bit of carrot and...

1100
01:54:19,262 --> 01:54:20,923
Does it hurt?

1101
01:54:27,237 --> 01:54:29,831
Know what Priya?
It isn't that finger...

1102
01:54:30,506 --> 01:54:32,497
this is the one I nicked

1103
01:54:33,009 --> 01:54:35,000
I've cut my finger.
Please give me a hug!

1104
01:54:46,289 --> 01:54:47,347
How are you doing?

1105
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:49,681
"Manubhai, coming for
a cup of tea?"

1106
01:54:51,995 --> 01:54:54,293
"Good morning, my foot!
Have you read the newspapers?"

1107
01:54:54,631 --> 01:54:57,657
Why? Has news of your fight with
your wife been printed in it?

1108
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:05,207
Look at this.
The company you worked for...

1109
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:07,532
has closed down overnight.
It has gone bust

1110
01:55:09,545 --> 01:55:11,536
What are you talking about?
- Read it

1111
01:55:13,349 --> 01:55:15,442
"Yes, Raj.
We're in serious trouble"

1112
01:55:15,785 --> 01:55:18,345
The bankers called thrice.
They want to see you

1113
01:55:48,051 --> 01:55:50,986
How will he be able to repay
2.5 million in a single week?

1114
01:55:51,354 --> 01:55:53,254
I can't do anything about that

1115
01:55:53,589 --> 01:55:57,389
"Mr Mathur, if the bank is not
repaid its dues in a week..."

1116
01:55:57,727 --> 01:56:00,594
we'll have to seize
all your properties

1117
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:48,302
"Raj, where have you been
all this while?"

1118
01:56:48,644 --> 01:56:52,045
I've told you so often to telephone me
if you're going to be late

1119
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:54,373
Your telephone in the office
wasn't reachable

1120
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:57,744
I spoke to Vivek and Deepak. Even
they didn't know where you were

1121
01:56:58,421 --> 01:57:01,652
"You know how worried
I get for you, Raj"

1122
01:57:09,332 --> 01:57:10,993
What is the matter?

1123
01:57:11,467 --> 01:57:13,128
"What is it, Raj?"

1124
01:57:13,703 --> 01:57:15,671
Tell me what happened

1125
01:57:17,573 --> 01:57:20,667
The company we have most of
our business dealings with...

1126
01:57:21,477 --> 01:57:25,470
has gone bankrupt. With that
goes the money they owed us

1127
01:57:28,451 --> 01:57:29,543
You mean?

1128
01:57:29,886 --> 01:57:33,686
I have bank loans and other
debts to repay...

1129
01:57:35,691 --> 01:57:37,682
I don't know what to do

1130
01:57:38,895 --> 01:57:42,456
Don't be upset. Come and
eat something first. Come on

1131
01:57:42,799 --> 01:57:43,788
No

1132
01:57:47,437 --> 01:57:49,701
Do you want me to
have a word with Papa?

1133
01:57:51,741 --> 01:57:53,038
"No, Priya"

1134
01:57:55,478 --> 01:57:58,413
Every decision I have taken in life
has been my very own

1135
01:57:59,715 --> 01:58:01,706
I never sought any help

1136
01:58:02,485 --> 01:58:07,286
"And from this difficult situation,
we will have to find our way out"

1137
01:58:13,596 --> 01:58:18,056
"Don't lose hope, Raj.
The two of us will think of a way"

1138
01:58:18,501 --> 01:58:23,734
"You have your Friend with you.
You have faith in Him, don't you?"

1139
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,337
He will help us

1140
01:58:42,692 --> 01:58:45,752
I expected business from your
company and took an extra loan...

1141
01:58:45,895 --> 01:58:49,160
"for two trucks, sir...
- You're getting so worked up..."

1142
01:58:49,765 --> 01:58:52,757
as if it's not my company
but yours that has sunk

1143
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:59,173
"Actually, sir, there is lot of
money your company owes me"

1144
01:58:59,275 --> 01:59:02,438
"No, no... the company
owes you nothing"

1145
01:59:02,778 --> 01:59:07,772
"It "owed" you money. Past tense.
Because the company is no more"

1146
01:59:09,785 --> 01:59:12,345
"But I did my work with
all honesty, sir..."

1147
01:59:12,889 --> 01:59:16,791
Why did you?
Did I ask you to be honest?

1148
01:59:17,326 --> 01:59:22,195
Look at me! My company has sunk!
But have I sunk? No

1149
01:59:22,365 --> 01:59:24,196
Learn something

1150
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:29,203
"I'm no match for you, sir.
All I want..."

1151
01:59:29,539 --> 01:59:34,476
Now don't bother me. I'm going
away to Europe for two months

1152
01:59:34,944 --> 01:59:37,469
I'm very tired.
I want to relax

1153
01:59:39,815 --> 01:59:44,218
"But yes, I'm thinking of starting
a new company after I return"

1154
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,812
You can meet me then.
I'll do something for you

1155
01:59:48,057 --> 01:59:50,218
"In the meantime, you can
take a holiday too"

1156
01:59:50,393 --> 01:59:53,226
Where do you folks go?
What do you call that place?

1157
01:59:53,362 --> 01:59:57,822
"Khandala? Go to Khandala.
- Thank you, sir..."

1158
01:59:59,035 --> 02:00:03,233
but I don't want to go anywhere.
It's just that by the time you return...

1159
02:00:03,839 --> 02:00:05,568
the time the bank has given me
will be over

1160
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:09,834
You're ruining my time
and my mood now

1161
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:14,847
There are many people like you who
are upset at the company going bust

1162
02:00:15,151 --> 02:00:19,850
And I haven't started a charity to
distribute alms to everyone coming here!

1163
02:00:20,856 --> 02:00:23,848
"I'm not asking for alms, sir.
I'm asking for my rights"

1164
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:30,526
Rights? You don't ask for rights!
You only ask for alms

1165
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,860
"If you want your rights,
go to the courts"

1166
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:08,898
"Raj, have this coffee.
And change your clothes quickly"

1167
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,104
"What is the matter, Raj?"

1168
02:01:24,153 --> 02:01:25,916
"What happened, Raj?"

1169
02:01:28,924 --> 02:01:30,915
I... I just felt like crying

1170
02:02:02,958 --> 02:02:06,359
"Nothing's working, Manubhai.
I've tried everything"

1171
02:02:06,962 --> 02:02:08,953
We'll have to sell the trucks

1172
02:02:10,466 --> 02:02:13,367
Everything's going to go away.
- No way

1173
02:02:13,469 --> 02:02:16,961
I'll telephone Jignesh right away.
- Why keep calling Jignesh!

1174
02:02:17,106 --> 02:02:20,371
How many people will you talk to?
You spoke to... Saeed earlier

1175
02:02:20,976 --> 02:02:22,967
Did he give you any money?
Nobody's going to

1176
02:02:23,479 --> 02:02:26,607
You've given me so much already.
This chap is cancelling his wedding

1177
02:02:26,982 --> 02:02:29,974
"Everybody's trying his best,
but nothing's happening. Nothing"

1178
02:02:30,086 --> 02:02:34,989
"Look, have patience. Ups and downs
are part of business. Right?"

1179
02:02:35,091 --> 02:02:38,993
"Oh yes, don't lose hope, Raj.
We'll find a way out"

1180
02:02:39,128 --> 02:02:40,993
What way will we find? What?

1181
02:02:41,163 --> 02:02:44,394
Someone else's company closes down
and the bank holds me by the throat!

1182
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:45,990
Let me try

1183
02:02:47,203 --> 02:02:51,003
There's another notice from the bank.
- What new notice is this?

1184
02:02:51,307 --> 02:02:54,401
"It says, you've got to 3.5 million,
not 2.5"

1185
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:59,413
3.5 million? How come?
I've settled it at 2.5 with the bank!

1186
02:02:59,682 --> 02:03:02,014
"Look at how the bankers
are behaving, Manubhai"

1187
02:03:02,184 --> 02:03:04,414
I had a clear understanding
with them that...

1188
02:03:08,424 --> 02:03:11,018
This is a cheque. For 2.5 million

1189
02:03:13,662 --> 02:03:16,426
It's yours.
- Ours

1190
02:03:16,832 --> 02:03:19,426
Don't worry. I haven't taken it
from Papa. I swear

1191
02:03:20,035 --> 02:03:22,435
Remember my assignment
from the Australian company?

1192
02:03:24,039 --> 02:03:26,200
It has been approved.
And this is the advance

1193
02:03:27,209 --> 02:03:31,441
"But who'd give 2.5 as an advance?
- Big folks, big business"

1194
02:03:32,047 --> 02:03:35,039
They have hefty advances too.
They aren't beggars like us

1195
02:03:36,185 --> 02:03:39,052
You can have the money.
I'll manage on credit

1196
02:03:41,724 --> 02:03:44,454
"What a narrow escape! Else,
we'd have lost this office too..."

1197
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,461
and we'd sit under the
staircase with our accounts

1198
02:03:53,469 --> 02:03:56,461
"Manubhai, don't drink too much.
- This is my first drink!"

1199
02:03:59,074 --> 02:04:01,474
This is the photograph Raj had
torn up in a fit of emotions

1200
02:04:07,082 --> 02:04:09,073
Why're you roaming around
with the photo?

1201
02:04:10,085 --> 02:04:15,489
I've had to work so hard for Priya...
and the photo's damaged anyway

1202
02:04:28,103 --> 02:04:31,095
"What are you upto, Raj?
What will Priya think?"

1203
02:04:31,607 --> 02:04:34,508
It's Priya I'm doing it too.
- I see. Go ahead

1204
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:39,103
"Know what, Manubhai? I'll telephone
Sameer and call him over"

1205
02:04:39,281 --> 02:04:42,512
"All right... who's that?
- Her friend from Europe, remember?"

1206
02:04:42,751 --> 02:04:46,118
"No, he'll find it odd here!
- He'll talk to her..."

1207
02:04:46,455 --> 02:04:49,117
"and she'll be happy. Else,
we keep talking only about the garage"

1208
02:04:50,125 --> 02:04:52,525
"Sameer, this is Raj here.
Where are you?"

1209
02:04:53,128 --> 02:04:56,529
You're so close to our house!
Come over

1210
02:04:58,133 --> 02:05:01,125
"We're having a party,
a small get-together..."

1211
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:03,534
come over. Priya's here too

1212
02:05:04,807 --> 02:05:06,138
Talk to her

1213
02:05:10,279 --> 02:05:13,544
It's Sameer. I've called him over

1214
02:05:18,153 --> 02:05:21,145
"No, it's a small get-together.
- One moment"

1215
02:05:22,157 --> 02:05:24,557
"Sameer, Priya's busy
for a second"

1216
02:05:28,564 --> 02:05:31,158
"Yes, Sameer. Talk to her"

1217
02:05:35,437 --> 02:05:37,166
Raj insists that you must come

1218
02:05:40,175 --> 02:05:42,666
"And listen, I'm talking to you
from another room now"

1219
02:05:43,579 --> 02:05:46,571
Don't even make the mistake of
telling Raj...

1220
02:05:46,682 --> 02:05:48,582
that you're the one I took
the money from

1221
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:51,914
"It should remain between
you and me, Sameer"

1222
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:56,481
Raj mustn't get to know

1223
02:06:10,606 --> 02:06:12,369
I've been talking to Sameer

1224
02:06:16,712 --> 02:06:18,202
"Is there anything you want, Raj?"

1225
02:06:20,683 --> 02:06:21,707
No

1226
02:06:28,223 --> 02:06:30,623
So Sameer was the one
who gave you the money?

1227
02:06:33,228 --> 02:06:36,629
Just tell me whether Sameer
gave you the money or not

1228
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:40,232
"Raj, I...
- Yes, or no!"

1229
02:06:42,237 --> 02:06:43,226
Yes

1230
02:06:43,639 --> 02:06:46,403
Why did you take the money from Sameer?
- Raj...

1231
02:06:46,575 --> 02:06:49,237
Why did you take it from Sameer?
- Talk softly

1232
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:52,642
We have guests at home.
We'll end up having a drama...

1233
02:06:52,881 --> 02:06:56,248
But we're already part of a drama!
You're worried about the guests?

1234
02:06:56,552 --> 02:06:59,646
I'll show you what a drama is!

1235
02:07:03,258 --> 02:07:06,250
Thanks for coming to the party.
Shut that music!

1236
02:07:08,964 --> 02:07:10,898
Go home. This moment!

1237
02:07:13,936 --> 02:07:15,267
I'm not kidding!

1238
02:07:16,572 --> 02:07:17,834
Go away!
- It's only 10

1239
02:07:17,906 --> 02:07:21,273
The party at my house is
over at 10. Get going!

1240
02:07:23,278 --> 02:07:26,270
What's gotten into you?
- I'm sorry

1241
02:07:26,682 --> 02:07:29,674
"Before I get nastier, go away.
- All right"

1242
02:07:42,398 --> 02:07:44,298
"The drama is over, okay?"

1243
02:07:44,633 --> 02:07:48,296
"Now tell me, why did you
take the money from Sameer?"

1244
02:07:49,605 --> 02:07:52,938
"You had a bank loan to repay...
you were so upset, Raj"

1245
02:07:53,308 --> 02:07:55,469
And so you took the money
from Sameer?

1246
02:07:56,111 --> 02:07:58,306
"You didn't sleep all nights, Raj."

1247
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:02,710
Now I won't sleep all my life!
You took money from Sameer!

1248
02:08:03,318 --> 02:08:05,718
What would be the worst
thing to happen? What?

1249
02:08:06,021 --> 02:08:09,320
"Our business would have wound up,
this house would have been sold..."

1250
02:08:09,458 --> 02:08:12,723
and we'd have been out on the streets.
But there are millions on the streets!

1251
02:08:12,928 --> 02:08:16,329
"Their life is a struggle, but
they have faith in each other"

1252
02:08:16,665 --> 02:08:19,725
"They trust each other.
- I tried everywhere, Raj"

1253
02:08:20,469 --> 02:08:22,835
I even spoke to the export company

1254
02:08:23,338 --> 02:08:26,136
"But when they didn't give me
any money, I asked Sameer..."

1255
02:08:26,341 --> 02:08:28,332
I didn't take a penny
from my own father!

1256
02:08:28,844 --> 02:08:31,472
"I didn't borrow from my relatives,
not even from your father!"

1257
02:08:31,747 --> 02:08:35,740
And you went and begged Sameer?
What will he think?

1258
02:08:36,351 --> 02:08:42,756
That it's because of his favours
that I'm so happy and delighted!

1259
02:08:42,891 --> 02:08:45,758
"It's no favour, Raj.
It's business"

1260
02:08:45,994 --> 02:08:48,360
"I've got to make garments for him, Raj.
I've only taken an advance"

1261
02:08:50,766 --> 02:08:53,166
Are you going to
teach me business now?

1262
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:58,763
Does anyone give such a big advance?
And you know why he gave the advance!

1263
02:08:58,907 --> 02:09:01,375
"You know it and I know it,
you will not say it..."

1264
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:04,770
But I'll tell you!
He gave you the advance...

1265
02:09:04,913 --> 02:09:07,381
because he's still in love with you.
- Raj!

1266
02:09:08,517 --> 02:09:10,382
And you know that he's
in love with you!

1267
02:09:10,519 --> 02:09:12,009
Which is why he gave the money

1268
02:09:14,056 --> 02:09:16,388
You know he loves you
and gave you the money

1269
02:09:16,692 --> 02:09:18,785
Does anyone give such a huge
advance just like that?

1270
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:29,794
"Priya, Sameer's here.
Welcome, Sameer"

1271
02:09:30,405 --> 02:09:33,806
You're the one we were waiting for.
We were talking about you

1272
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:38,811
It's your house...
he has brought you flowers!

1273
02:09:40,716 --> 02:09:43,810
"Sorry, I've broken all the bottles.
- What is the matter, Priya?"

1274
02:09:43,919 --> 02:09:45,819
I'll tell you what the matter is

1275
02:09:46,421 --> 02:09:49,822
The truth is that the two of you
have made a fool out of me

1276
02:09:50,425 --> 02:09:53,417
All I want to know is
why you did it?

1277
02:09:53,595 --> 02:09:57,554
"It's between you and me, Raj. Why
are you dragging Sameer into it?"

1278
02:09:57,733 --> 02:10:02,830
"Don't stand up for Sameer!
Don't... okay, okay, I'm sorry"

1279
02:10:03,138 --> 02:10:06,835
"Do stand up for him! Go ahead!
You're made for each other, right?"

1280
02:10:08,076 --> 02:10:11,136
"She's wearing such a lovely sari,
and look at your suit..."

1281
02:10:11,446 --> 02:10:12,845
Which suit is this?

1282
02:10:13,448 --> 02:10:15,848
"I'm not fighting, I'm only
taking a look at the suit"

1283
02:10:16,451 --> 02:10:18,442
Don't touch me! I'm taking
a look at his suit!

1284
02:10:28,463 --> 02:10:29,953
"What are you talking about, Raj?"

1285
02:10:35,771 --> 02:10:38,865
I've got nothing. You've got the money!
It's aunt who sends tickets for me

1286
02:10:39,474 --> 02:10:42,466
And your dream of childhood
in Switzerland...

1287
02:10:48,483 --> 02:10:50,883
And there's Sameer
to lend us money

1288
02:10:52,721 --> 02:10:54,882
This is between the two of you.
I must leave

1289
02:10:54,990 --> 02:10:57,891
Where d'you think you're going?
It's between the two of you!

1290
02:10:57,993 --> 02:11:00,154
Rather I go away!

1291
02:11:01,496 --> 02:11:04,897
"Actually, I'll call a priest and
have the two of you married"

1292
02:11:06,235 --> 02:11:08,897
"Why even call a priest? I know
the rites, I was recently married"

1293
02:11:09,004 --> 02:11:11,495
I remember everything.
Give me your hand...

1294
02:11:12,507 --> 02:11:13,906
"What are you up to, Raj?"

1295
02:11:57,552 --> 02:12:00,544
I'm in love...

1296
02:12:01,556 --> 02:12:04,548
you are in love...

1297
02:12:05,227 --> 02:12:09,960
so what have things come to be?

1298
02:12:12,734 --> 02:12:15,828
I am not unfaithful...

1299
02:12:16,571 --> 02:12:19,563
you are not unfaithful...

1300
02:12:20,242 --> 02:12:25,976
"so why do we hold
so much against each other?"

1301
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:32,985
We were walking together...

1302
02:12:35,223 --> 02:12:39,990
"so what caused these
distances between us?"

1303
02:12:46,101 --> 02:12:49,002
We don't even know...

1304
02:12:50,605 --> 02:12:55,599
where we are headed

1305
02:13:19,301 --> 02:13:24,034
"I'm in love,
you are in love..."

1306
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:28,632
so what have things come to be?

1307
02:13:29,644 --> 02:13:31,635
I am not unfaithful...

1308
02:13:32,047 --> 02:13:34,038
you are not unfaithful...

1309
02:13:34,649 --> 02:13:38,050
"so why do we hold
so much against each other?"

1310
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:44,048
We were walking together...

1311
02:13:44,893 --> 02:13:49,057
"how have we come to be distanced
from each other?"

1312
02:13:54,669 --> 02:13:57,069
We don't even know...

1313
02:13:58,106 --> 02:14:01,075
where we will go

1314
02:14:23,498 --> 02:14:27,696
"My heart is immersed
in pain..."

1315
02:14:29,471 --> 02:14:32,702
my eyes are filled with tears

1316
02:14:34,009 --> 02:14:38,105
This season of loneliness...

1317
02:14:38,713 --> 02:14:42,114
isolates me from my path

1318
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:48,112
"We had dreamt of achieving
our goal together"

1319
02:14:49,291 --> 02:14:53,728
But our paths are now different

1320
02:14:53,929 --> 02:14:58,127
Even as we walked together...

1321
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:02,131
"I wonder how we
have lost our way"

1322
02:15:16,384 --> 02:15:20,753
"I'm in love,
you are in love..."

1323
02:15:21,089 --> 02:15:25,150
so what have things come to be?

1324
02:15:38,173 --> 02:15:41,165
Look at the lovebirds.
They're at it again

1325
02:15:41,776 --> 02:15:47,180
Their romance is beginning and Raj
and Priya's love is coming to an end

1326
02:15:47,782 --> 02:15:52,185
It's almost a month now.
- No one knows what caused the trouble

1327
02:15:52,287 --> 02:15:54,187
One moment. I'll explain

1328
02:15:54,456 --> 02:15:56,185
"Radha, come here"

1329
02:15:56,791 --> 02:16:00,454
Let's suppose Radha is Priya
and he's Raj

1330
02:16:00,795 --> 02:16:04,526
Now say something to each other.
Anything... get started

1331
02:16:06,134 --> 02:16:07,192
Go on

1332
02:16:07,802 --> 02:16:11,397
It's the man who starts it all.
- Why? It's the woman who starts it

1333
02:16:11,473 --> 02:16:14,203
"A woman speaks only when the man
does something wrong, isn't it?"

1334
02:16:14,543 --> 02:16:16,977
Are you telling me that it's the man
who's always at fault?

1335
02:16:17,145 --> 02:16:20,205
"Whatever, it's the man who
actually starts it all"

1336
02:16:20,315 --> 02:16:22,806
Won't the man react
when his wife keeps nagging him?

1337
02:16:22,984 --> 02:16:26,818
"Don't say anything against women, okay?
- Not against men either, okay?"

1338
02:16:27,122 --> 02:16:29,488
"Because you're a man, you've
got the power to scream at me?"

1339
02:16:29,624 --> 02:16:31,148
And who gave you the
power to scream at me?

1340
02:16:31,326 --> 02:16:33,817
"Enough, enough!
I get it"

1341
02:16:34,329 --> 02:16:36,229
Neither of them are at fault

1342
02:16:36,831 --> 02:16:38,822
They've separated for
no rhyme or reason

1343
02:16:40,835 --> 02:16:45,238
Wash the windshield properly.
It's the last time

1344
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,833
So you've examined the truck?
Tell us if there is a problem

1345
02:16:51,846 --> 02:16:56,840
"Raj, think it over again
with a cool mind"

1346
02:16:57,152 --> 02:17:00,246
"You're not making a mistake by
selling off your trucks, are you?"

1347
02:17:02,157 --> 02:17:05,251
"I know I'm making a mistake, Manubhai.
- So why?"

1348
02:17:05,527 --> 02:17:09,258
I'm making a mistake.
But I have no other choice

1349
02:17:09,864 --> 02:17:12,856
"Unless I return Sameer's money,
I can't have any peace"

1350
02:17:23,378 --> 02:17:26,677
I wish to meet Mr Sameer Arora.
My name is Raj Mathur

1351
02:17:26,815 --> 02:17:29,375
"Mr Mathur, he's in a meeting
right now. Please be seated"

1352
02:17:30,085 --> 02:17:33,543
Tell him Raj Mathur is here.
It's urgent

1353
02:17:33,788 --> 02:17:36,552
"He's busy in a personal
meeting, Mr Mathur"

1354
02:17:36,691 --> 02:17:39,285
He has told us not to disturb
him for the next half hour

1355
02:17:39,394 --> 02:17:40,884
Please sit down

1356
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:40,353
"When he's through with his personal
meeting, give him this cheque"

1357
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:50,621
I'm telling you again.
Keep the cheque

1358
02:18:51,966 --> 02:18:55,367
"You can return it to me later.
- No, Sameer"

1359
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:58,632
My work with the Australian
company has already begun

1360
02:18:59,274 --> 02:19:03,370
"I know that, Priya.
But I'm feeling very strange..."

1361
02:19:04,179 --> 02:19:06,704
the way you're returning
this cheque to me

1362
02:19:07,315 --> 02:19:09,977
"For me, it's very important to
return the cheque to you, Sameer"

1363
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:14,379
"In fact, I shouldn't have
taken it from you at all"

1364
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:20,994
"No, Priya. If a friend doesn't
help a friend, who will?"

1365
02:19:22,130 --> 02:19:26,396
"No, Sameer. It was my mistake"

1366
02:19:28,636 --> 02:19:33,005
"Before taking the money from you,
I should've considered..."

1367
02:19:34,209 --> 02:19:37,372
how much it would hurt Raj

1368
02:19:47,021 --> 02:19:51,424
If you think your relations with Raj
will be okay if I take back the money...

1369
02:19:51,693 --> 02:19:54,685
"I'll take it back.
- No, Sameer"

1370
02:19:55,597 --> 02:20:00,432
It isn't about money.
It's not money

1371
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:08,439
"I admit, I made a mistake.
But what Raj said and did..."

1372
02:20:09,043 --> 02:20:13,446
no woman can ever tolerate.
She can't ever

1373
02:20:19,254 --> 02:20:23,452
"I had to relieve myself of a burden,
and I've done it"

1374
02:20:37,372 --> 02:20:39,397
Raj is such a fortunate man

1375
02:20:41,376 --> 02:20:43,207
You love him so much

1376
02:20:49,083 --> 02:20:54,487
"Let me drop you home.
- No, Sameer. I'll go on my own"

1377
02:21:05,099 --> 02:21:07,499
"I'm glad you're here, Manubhai.
- What happened?"

1378
02:21:07,635 --> 02:21:12,095
"Raj has been drinking all evening,
talking about Priya. Look"

1379
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:19,102
Not a word from you.
I'll talk to him

1380
02:21:23,284 --> 02:21:26,913
"Raj, what's up?
Stop it now"

1381
02:21:27,121 --> 02:21:29,112
Let me drink this up

1382
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:30,452
"What happened, Raj?"

1383
02:21:31,626 --> 02:21:36,529
All I want to ask Priya is:
Why did she go to Sameer?

1384
02:21:37,131 --> 02:21:40,123
"They're childhood friends,
we all know that"

1385
02:21:40,535 --> 02:21:45,802
"Raj, you aren't suggesting?
- What rubbish! No!"

1386
02:21:46,608 --> 02:21:48,542
"I didn't mean that... no, not at all"

1387
02:21:48,643 --> 02:21:52,135
All I want to ask is why
she went to Sameer. That's it

1388
02:21:54,148 --> 02:21:57,140
"You're no longer together,
it could be anything else"

1389
02:21:57,218 --> 02:21:59,152
"What say, Manubhai?
- What anything else?"

1390
02:22:00,555 --> 02:22:04,548
What if she's not with me?
She's still my wife and I...

1391
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:09,160
"Why're you getting sentimental?
- Yes, I'm sentimental!"

1392
02:22:10,164 --> 02:22:13,565
"And she knows that too and
despite that, she went there"

1393
02:22:21,509 --> 02:22:24,171
I'll be back in a moment.
- Where to?

1394
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:27,811
I'll just go and ask Priya
why she went to Sameer

1395
02:22:27,882 --> 02:22:29,179
Listen...

1396
02:22:30,518 --> 02:22:34,716
"You think I'm going to fight with her?
Bansi, get us some more drinks"

1397
02:22:35,189 --> 02:22:38,181
"If I had to fight, I'd have
given Sameer a punch right there"

1398
02:22:39,193 --> 02:22:41,923
I'm only going to ask her.
Only to ask her

1399
02:22:42,864 --> 02:22:44,991
Go ahead and drink.
I'll be back

1400
02:22:47,201 --> 02:22:48,600
"No, I don't want the car"

1401
02:22:48,736 --> 02:22:51,204
Theirs is a strange love.
I can't understand it

1402
02:22:52,907 --> 02:22:55,933
I think there's going to be a fight

1403
02:22:56,978 --> 02:22:59,708
But I also get the feeling that...

1404
02:23:00,081 --> 02:23:04,643
"since he's meeting her after
many days, they'll get cozy"

1405
02:23:04,986 --> 02:23:07,216
lt'll all be settled.
Take it from me

1406
02:23:07,555 --> 02:23:09,750
"Bansi, get us some glasses"

1407
02:23:19,534 --> 02:23:22,401
"Madam, one Raj Mathur
is here to meet you"

1408
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:27,298
Raj Mathur? At this hour?
Ask him to come tomorrow morning

1409
02:23:27,642 --> 02:23:30,236
"Tomorrow morning? Okay, madam...
- Tomorrow morning, my foot!"

1410
02:23:30,578 --> 02:23:32,239
Give me the phone

1411
02:23:33,982 --> 02:23:37,474
"Aunt, it's Raj.
I want to have a word with Priya"

1412
02:23:37,852 --> 02:23:40,980
You can't meet her at this hour.
Is this any time for decent folks?

1413
02:23:41,322 --> 02:23:46,259
What decent folks? I want to talk
to my wife. Please give her the phone

1414
02:23:47,862 --> 02:23:50,330
I told you once.
You can't meet her. That's it

1415
02:23:50,665 --> 02:23:51,927
What's once?

1416
02:23:53,267 --> 02:23:55,064
She hung up on me!

1417
02:23:55,636 --> 02:23:57,934
I don't need anyone's permission
to meet my wife!

1418
02:23:58,272 --> 02:24:00,706
"What are you doing, sir?
- Please leave"

1419
02:24:01,042 --> 02:24:03,010
I want to see my wife

1420
02:24:17,091 --> 02:24:18,752
"Guard, don't let him get in"

1421
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:22,225
Will I have to take your permission
to meet my wife?

1422
02:24:22,563 --> 02:24:25,088
We have so many problems
only because of you!

1423
02:24:26,034 --> 02:24:27,695
Don't talk like a thug

1424
02:24:27,902 --> 02:24:29,563
You call me a thug!

1425
02:24:29,804 --> 02:24:30,964
"Yes, you're a thug"

1426
02:24:31,305 --> 02:24:33,967
"You're a thug, a ruffian!
- Get the hell out of here!"

1427
02:24:34,308 --> 02:24:36,003
Why're you pushing me?

1428
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:39,370
What drama is this? Stop it!
Let us sleep!

1429
02:24:39,714 --> 02:24:42,114
Go inside and sleep!
- Stop this drama

1430
02:24:42,450 --> 02:24:44,441
Decent folks live here.
- You're decent...

1431
02:24:44,786 --> 02:24:48,119
"because you live in tall buildings?
She calls me a thug, a ruffian!"

1432
02:24:48,456 --> 02:24:50,651
I'm going to beat her up!

1433
02:24:51,092 --> 02:24:52,457
Stop pushing me

1434
02:24:55,496 --> 02:24:57,760
What's the matter?
What racket is this?

1435
02:24:58,099 --> 02:25:00,795
"It's your son-in-law, the thug.
He's showing his true colours"

1436
02:25:01,135 --> 02:25:02,659
Leave me alone!

1437
02:25:29,363 --> 02:25:32,491
I'll tell the police you are
not letting me meet my wife

1438
02:25:32,834 --> 02:25:34,961
Even the police have arrived!

1439
02:25:35,369 --> 02:25:37,701
Let go of my hand!
I'll report you guys

1440
02:25:38,172 --> 02:25:39,833
Let go of him. Leave him alone.
- Sir...

1441
02:25:40,174 --> 02:25:42,165
I want to meet my wife.
- You get drunk and cause trouble?

1442
02:25:42,376 --> 02:25:43,365
No

1443
02:25:43,611 --> 02:25:45,602
Say whatever you want to
at the police station

1444
02:25:49,117 --> 02:25:52,848
"What are you doing, sir?
I want to meet my wife"

1445
02:25:53,187 --> 02:25:53,846
Hold it

1446
02:25:56,057 --> 02:25:57,684
Please let him go

1447
02:26:00,261 --> 02:26:02,024
He's my husband

1448
02:26:03,164 --> 02:26:05,792
Your husband?
- Yes

1449
02:26:08,503 --> 02:26:12,200
"All right. I'll let him go,
because you're asking me to"

1450
02:26:13,107 --> 02:26:15,735
You are educated and decent folks

1451
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:19,011
Does it look nice to publicly
behave like a thug?

1452
02:26:19,347 --> 02:26:21,645
Get in... go on
Get on with your work

1453
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:24,948
It's a husband-wife quarrel.
Go on

1454
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:58,241
"Go home, Raj. Please"

1455
02:27:01,355 --> 02:27:03,789
"You've made a mockery
of our marriage, Raj"

1456
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,120
It wasn't my intention
to do that

1457
02:27:09,163 --> 02:27:13,065
All I came to ask you was...

1458
02:27:13,467 --> 02:27:16,800
"and they stopped me.
Called me a thug, a ruffian"

1459
02:27:18,673 --> 02:27:21,642
"I don't know why it happened.
- It happens all the time, Raj?"

1460
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:26,947
All the time?
In Sameer's presence the other day...

1461
02:27:27,348 --> 02:27:31,478
"and now, in the presence
of the whole world? Why?"

1462
02:27:32,553 --> 02:27:36,182
Have you ever thought
what I'm going through?

1463
02:27:39,293 --> 02:27:42,888
"I try to do one thing, but I always
end up doing something else"

1464
02:27:44,365 --> 02:27:48,665
"I know that.
I know you very well, Raj"

1465
02:27:49,537 --> 02:27:52,631
But I can't take it anymore.
I can't

1466
02:27:55,276 --> 02:27:58,837
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1467
02:28:00,214 --> 02:28:02,045
we'd better separate

1468
02:28:04,285 --> 02:28:06,515
"Don't say that, Priya"

1469
02:28:07,321 --> 02:28:10,654
"Remember what you once told me, Raj?"

1470
02:28:13,294 --> 02:28:16,855
"In the world somewhere,
there will be someone very happy..."

1471
02:28:17,531 --> 02:28:20,523
because you are happy
Remember?

1472
02:28:24,338 --> 02:28:26,806
Go on. Go home

1473
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:15,286
"My child, think again.
It's a very crucial step"

1474
02:29:15,656 --> 02:29:18,250
And you can't take such decisions
in haste

1475
02:29:18,592 --> 02:29:21,026
"Kishore, what's gotten into you?"

1476
02:29:21,395 --> 02:29:24,387
If Priya has decided to leave India
and go away to Greece...

1477
02:29:24,732 --> 02:29:27,166
she must've thought about it

1478
02:29:27,501 --> 02:29:30,834
You saw the racket
he created last night

1479
02:29:31,305 --> 02:29:32,397
Priya?

1480
02:29:36,377 --> 02:29:39,608
It's very difficult for me
to live with Raj

1481
02:29:41,615 --> 02:29:46,882
And it's also difficult for me
to live here and stay away from him

1482
02:30:02,336 --> 02:30:04,327
"What have I gone
and done, Manubhai?"

1483
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:08,738
What did I set out to do?
And what did I end up doing!

1484
02:30:09,076 --> 02:30:14,036
That's the trouble with you!
You think after you do!

1485
02:30:17,718 --> 02:30:21,245
What am I to do now?

1486
02:30:21,655 --> 02:30:24,988
What can you do?
You've done what you had to!

1487
02:30:25,326 --> 02:30:28,591
So why're you asking us
what to do? Why ask us!

1488
02:30:28,929 --> 02:30:32,660
After doing everything...
- Calm down

1489
02:30:37,605 --> 02:30:41,200
"Son, let's go home"

1490
02:30:41,809 --> 02:30:45,142
"No, I'm not going home"

1491
02:30:45,546 --> 02:30:46,808
Hear that?

1492
02:30:48,482 --> 02:30:50,473
I feel very lonely there

1493
02:30:52,453 --> 02:30:57,686
Tell me... what should I do?
I don't want to lose her

1494
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:03,355
"Raj, Priya called to say she's
going away to Greece forever"

1495
02:31:03,697 --> 02:31:06,689
She has left for the airport.
The flight leaves at 10:30

1496
02:31:07,568 --> 02:31:10,503
Hear that? What are you
going to do now?

1497
02:31:10,805 --> 02:31:12,705
She's leaving!

1498
02:31:13,407 --> 02:31:15,932
"No, I won't let her go"

1499
02:31:17,244 --> 02:31:19,212
I'm not letting Priya go away

1500
02:32:15,569 --> 02:32:17,298
Where's Priya?
- She has left

1501
02:32:17,638 --> 02:32:19,367
Where?
- She's in there

1502
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:22,202
"Where to? Where's your ticket?
- Mister, I've got to in"

1503
02:32:22,543 --> 02:32:25,307
"He's not going abroad,
he's going to meet his wife"

1504
02:32:25,646 --> 02:32:27,113
That's not allowed

1505
02:32:29,783 --> 02:32:31,580
Mr Tiwari...
- What happened?

1506
02:32:31,919 --> 02:32:33,910
Priya's going away.
- Where to?

1507
02:32:34,288 --> 02:32:35,949
She's leaving me and going away.
- Don't tell me!

1508
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:39,250
I've got to stop her. Please ask him
to let me go in for five minutes

1509
02:32:39,593 --> 02:32:41,458
Let me talk to him

1510
02:32:41,795 --> 02:32:43,592
"Listen, Yadav"

1511
02:32:49,503 --> 02:32:52,131
"Go on, Raj. Hurry up.
- Just 15 minutes"

1512
02:32:53,607 --> 02:32:56,474
Where are you going?
- One moment

1513
02:32:56,810 --> 02:32:59,142
Listen...

1514
02:33:03,817 --> 02:33:05,148
Hurry!

1515
02:34:55,729 --> 02:34:56,923
Don't go

1516
02:34:58,065 --> 02:35:01,933
I know I've made a mistake.
Please forgive me

1517
02:35:05,806 --> 02:35:10,175
"Raj, that's just what I was trying
to explain to you last night"

1518
02:35:11,745 --> 02:35:14,543
Rather than live together
and hurt each other...

1519
02:35:14,948 --> 02:35:16,540
we'd better part

1520
02:35:18,852 --> 02:35:21,753
Whether you take the decision
to separate or I...

1521
02:35:22,089 --> 02:35:25,957
"isn't it one and the same thing?
- No, Priya"

1522
02:35:27,661 --> 02:35:29,652
"I know, I'm the one
who has made a mistake"

1523
02:35:30,964 --> 02:35:34,297
But give me one more chance.
Please Priya

1524
02:35:36,303 --> 02:35:38,168
"Can you be happy without me, Priya?"

1525
02:35:41,775 --> 02:35:43,640
"Maybe not, Raj"

1526
02:35:44,978 --> 02:35:48,311
But it isn't necessary to have
the company of someone you love...

1527
02:35:49,116 --> 02:35:51,175
"for a lifetime, is it?"

1528
02:35:58,759 --> 02:36:02,991
"How many times will you say that, Raj?
How many times?"

1529
02:36:04,998 --> 02:36:08,832
"Don't make it any more difficult
for me to go away, Raj. Please don't"

1530
02:36:11,939 --> 02:36:14,999
Maybe this is what was
to come out of our marriage

1531
02:36:24,218 --> 02:36:27,346
"No, Priya. This isn't
the outcome of our marriage"

1532
02:36:34,027 --> 02:36:37,019
"Priya, I've had a dream"

1533
02:36:39,032 --> 02:36:44,026
We have two children.
A son and a daughter

1534
02:36:45,939 --> 02:36:48,032
The son is just like you

1535
02:36:49,042 --> 02:36:53,172
He only has a nose like mine

1536
02:36:58,051 --> 02:37:02,147
The daughter is very pretty.
She has your eyes...

1537
02:37:02,923 --> 02:37:06,359
she's very nice too. Like you

1538
02:37:12,166 --> 02:37:14,225
"You're a very nice person, Priya"

1539
02:37:15,869 --> 02:37:18,463
"I could've changed for the
better too, in your company"

1540
02:37:19,773 --> 02:37:22,367
"Don't go away, Priya.
I'll change my ways..."

1541
02:37:23,877 --> 02:37:27,074
"I'm sorry, Aunt Anna"

1542
02:37:32,553 --> 02:37:35,784
I'll even say sorry to Sameer

1543
02:37:38,091 --> 02:37:41,754
"When the children wake up at night,
I'll look after them"

1544
02:37:42,095 --> 02:37:46,657
"I won't give you any trouble.
Please don't go away, Priya"

1545
02:37:48,101 --> 02:37:51,901
"If you go away,
it'll shatter my dream"

1546
02:37:54,808 --> 02:38:01,577
"Raj, I've had the same dreams.
The same dreams, Raj"

1547
02:38:05,919 --> 02:38:08,410
But reality is otherwise

1548
02:38:15,195 --> 02:38:18,130
O beloved...

1549
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:11,380
"My loneliness, the ache
in my heart, never went away"

1550
02:39:11,985 --> 02:39:14,647
"The whole world
pokes at fun"

1551
02:39:18,091 --> 02:39:21,583
"You and I break up, my love..."

1552
02:39:22,996 --> 02:39:25,988
"like a star breaking away
from the skies"

1553
02:40:22,155 --> 02:40:24,919
"God, if I'm no more..."

1554
02:40:26,059 --> 02:40:28,050
look after Priya

1555
02:40:29,262 --> 02:40:34,529
Because I love Priya
very very much

1556
02:40:49,383 --> 02:40:54,286
"You are bidding me a farewell
and leaving me in God's care"

1557
02:40:55,022 --> 02:41:00,289
But you have broken my heart

1558
02:41:05,065 --> 02:41:08,626
"Broken hearts
are never put together again"

1559
02:41:11,071 --> 02:41:14,768
"You and I breaking up, my love..."

1560
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:20,302
"like a star breaking away
from the skies"

1561
02:42:02,055 --> 02:42:05,354
"How often have I told you to keep
your shoes at the right place, Raj?"

1562
02:42:28,248 --> 02:42:31,376
"I couldn't go away, Raj.
I couldn't"

1563
02:42:35,655 --> 02:42:39,648
I can't live without you

1564
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:47,557
"I realise, Raj, that I belong here.
In this house. With you"

1565
02:42:50,170 --> 02:42:54,903
And this talisman belongs
with you

1566
02:43:01,114 --> 02:43:04,675
"The dreams we saw
were the same, Raj"

1567
02:43:06,286 --> 02:43:09,517
And we can fulfill them
only by living together

1568
02:43:45,192 --> 02:43:48,593
"Promise me, Priya.
You will not leave me ever again"

1569
02:43:49,162 --> 02:43:51,289
And you must promise
never to shout at me again

1570
02:43:51,631 --> 02:43:54,122
"When do I?
All right, I won't"

1571
02:43:54,467 --> 02:43:58,130
But why did you leave me and go away?
- You said such nasty things to me

1572
02:43:58,471 --> 02:44:01,736
"I know, but I went to Aunt Anna's
house to bring you back"

1573
02:44:02,075 --> 02:44:04,976
"Not to bring me back, to fight with me.
- That's what Aunt Anna says"

1574
02:44:05,612 --> 02:44:08,137
That's it! You get wrong
things in your mind!

1575
02:44:08,481 --> 02:44:10,278
I know what's on your mind right now!
- What?

1576
02:44:10,584 --> 02:44:12,609
When I'm picking up the shoes.
- No...

1577
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:16,956
"All right, but did I say anything?
- No, but I understand"

1578
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:19,155
This is love.
- This isn't love

1579
02:44:19,492 --> 02:44:22,017
"Shoes are where shoes should be,
and love is where love is"

1580
02:44:22,362 --> 02:44:25,820
So my love is a shoe?
- That's not what I said

1581
02:44:26,499 --> 02:44:27,830
Don't shout at me.
- Am I shouting?

1582
02:44:28,101 --> 02:44:31,298
You promised you wouldn't shout.
- But I shout to show my love

1583
02:44:31,638 --> 02:44:34,300
That's your way of showing love?
- Yes

1584
02:44:36,509 --> 02:44:38,500
"Shut up, will you?
We're making love"
