Do you have a heart or stone?
Poor guy.

12
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:59,064
He is waiting for you
since three years at that place.

13
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:01,400
You didn't even look at his face.

14
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,235
Do you know how good he looks?

15
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,902
What is it? Why don't you speak
when l am talking to you?

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,014
You too like him, don't you?

17
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:15,449
No. -Then why do you feel tensed
whenever he comes to bus stop.

18
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,954
Leave it. Am l not saying no?
- Then do something.

19
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:20,285
Tell him in person saying
that you don't like him..

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,291
.. and don't come to see me.

21
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,960
Not that.. -Then?

22
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:28,623
l am afraid that l will start
loving him if l see him.

23
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:32,431
Oh! You will not love him but
he should run behind you.

24
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:35,097
Selfish! -Yes.

25
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:37,102
l am selfish.

26
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:42,103
l don't have father.
l have two younger sisters.

27
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,647
My mother has pinned
all her hopes on me.

28
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:46,149
She is working very hard
in educating me.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,311
ln these situations..

30
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:50,486
Sorry, dear.

31
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:51,988
At least meet him and tell his lies..

32
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:54,991
..saying that you don't like him.

33
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,152
Don't raise hopes in him
with your silence.

34
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,490
You know how much
he waited for you..

35
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,326
...since three years of our college.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,331
Tomorrow is the last day

Your looks are my life.''

''l am waiting like moonlight.''

41
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:38,031
''Bring Diwali festival.''

42
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,496
''Oh, dear. Why do you
stay like a dream..

43
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,699
..that is stuck between the eyelids?''

44
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:49,042
''Watch the eyes longing to see
your beautiful eyes.''

45
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:54,210
''Eyes and heart belong to you.''

46
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:59,222
''l ran behind the time.''

47
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,223
Hey, friend.
Why doesn't she look at me?

48
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:05,228
''Will l not stop breathing
if she would..''

49
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:11,064
''..see me at least in my next birth?''

50
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:45,893
What happened?

51
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,562
She looked at my hand.

52
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:48,900
Did she see you?

53
00:04:55,248 --> 00:05:00,276
''Everyday is a new day for me.''

54
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,448
''The feelings inside me say that.''

55
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:10,790
''You are watching me all the time.''

56
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:18,598
''This is a strange experience for me.''

57
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:21,104
''Your cool presence is
granting me happiness..''

58
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:24,107
''lt doesn't matter
l have to walk under the sun.''

59
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:26,802
''The heart is hiding
its suffering in the name of love.''

60
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,277
''Let the moments spent in waiting for..''

61
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:31,815
''..you become my pleasant memories.''

62
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,477
''Let this continue even
in coming births.'' -Srinidhi!

63
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:40,649
His name is Krishna.
- ''Eyes and heart belong to you.''

64
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,820
Madam! Don't you know

''Will l not stop breathing
if she would see me..

68
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,682

Sir, l will talk to her once and leave.
Sir.. Please, sir.

75
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,788
How is Krishna?

76
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:09,336
He died after saving you.

77
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,177
Why didn't l see you?

78
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:51,813

l had that dream again.

89
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:14,043
Don't tell your stupid dream again.

90
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,711
Till now you have said it 1000 times.

91
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:19,221
Did you see his face at least today?

92
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,553
No. l couldn't see
because of the light.

93
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,217
But you said l love you.

94
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:27,226
Even l don't understand that.
What do you think it is?

95
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,561
This is called mental
in medical terms.

96
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,867
Maybe the person who appeared
in your dream..

97
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,236
..is Lord Tirupati Venkanna's
third incarnation.

98
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,536
Are you joking?
- Not that..

99
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,579
You say that his face is
glowing and all that.. That's why.

100
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,741
Asha, if that dream comes true
then l will love only him..

..irrespective of his looks
and the place he lives in.

00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:51,314
l will marry only him.

103
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:04,599
This is not original gun!

104
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:05,726
Stop it!

Sorry, madam.

Really sorry.

Don't want your friendship.
- Come on. Let us go.

110
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,773
This is the way to treat friends?

00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,786

..the bomb blasts
that happened in Mumbai..

114
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,458
..Delhi Hyderabad and Meerut.

00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:31,285
Excuse me.

116
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,629
According to lndian lntelligence

- Father..

119
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:40,265
..why are you torturing me like this?

120
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,669
ls it necessary to have this
useless security everywhere l go?

121
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:46,934
So what?

122
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:50,313
Madam, you have to go now.
Right now.

123
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,644
Father..
- Sorry, gentlemen.

So exhibit his photographs in
all the hotels,

public places and malls.

126
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,822
We have to nab him immediately.

127
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,652
Are we here to do agriculture?

128
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,660
How long should l wait for passport?

129
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,823
Paid you money,
but didn't get till now.

130
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:09,990
l've been noticed now.

131
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:13,627
All of us may get caught!

132
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,470
Why are you behaving
like this in spite of..

133
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:16,972
..knowing the threat against
your father?

134
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,974
Threat is for him,
so give the security to him.

135
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,635
Leave me alone.

136
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:23,976
What if terrorists kidnap you
and blackmail your father?

137
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,345
You have to follow the protocol.
- You just shut up! Okay?

138
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,181
Sravanthi, why are you talking
like that without showing any respect?

139
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,350
Who do you think he is?
He is my chief security officer.

140
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,857
Oh! He is more important than me.

141
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:36,358
lt is not like that, Sravanthi.

142
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,696
Sir, why do you hurt her?

143
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:46,167
Sravanthi, who else do l have
other than you?

144
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:47,829
Try to understand.

145
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,672
Should l alone understand
every time, father?

146
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:53,838
Excuse me, sir.
Time to catch the flight.

Okay, father.

''Happiness shouldn't become
the Swiss bank account..

155
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,610
...that has never been used.''

156
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:12,952
''Let my money purse be filled
with happiness and spill out.''

157
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:10,680
''l am my hero.''
''l am my role model.''

158
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,342
''l stay like a monarch in my world.''

''There is no use of the
speedometer needle.''

163
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:33,994
''l am a whirlwind. l am the festival
of lights.''- ''That's right!''

164
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:37,540
''There is no volume control
to my voice.''

165
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:45,173
''Hey, how can you say that
l am wasting time?''

166
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:53,383
''This work should be taken
seriously like ajob.''

167
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:39,730
''What did my mind say?''
''This universe might exist.''

168
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:43,602
''l will become a parrot
that is ready to fly away.'' -''Oh, yes.''

00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:06,461
''l will play crazy carom with planets.''

175
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:14,095
''l will give my smile to everyone.''

176
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:22,112
''l will increase the happiness
thinking it to be sky.

177
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,978
''Life means merry go round.''

178
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:29,814
''Let me go round and round.''

179
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:33,652
''There is no rewind till yesterday.''

180
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:37,819
''Let me enjoy every second.''

181
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,487
''Happiness shouldn't become
the Swiss bank account..

182
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,496
..that has never been used.''

183
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:45,626
''Let my money purse be filled
with happiness and spill out.''

184
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:53,472
''Let my money purse be filled
with happiness. ''

185
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,189
Hyderabad

186
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:15,026
What is it with your nephew?
He is into fights all the time.

187
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,361
He lands up in jail once
in every two months.

188
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,834
This time your boy has
beaten a minister's son.

189
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,495
lt is very difficult to get bail.

190
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:24,175
Since you are a famous doctor
l forgive me and release him.

191
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:27,005
Leave me! Leave me!
- Stop, father!...

192
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,876
Please, brother!
- Leave me! Leave me!

193
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,714
Listen to me, brother!- No, brother!
- No, brother!- Don't shoot him.

194
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,219
l cannot leave him like this.
l will shoot him!

195
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:39,880
l will shoot him!
- Leave it!

196
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,393
He is creating nuisance everyday.
l am losing my respect because of him.

197
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,065
They will come, brother!
Within five minutes everyone will come.

198
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,395
Did you find something, uncle?

199
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,195
Hey! Where did you till now?

200
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,364
Me? l was in Ramesh's room.

201
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,540
Six families. 16 rooms.

202
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,543
Nobody is taking advantage
ofjoint families as you do.

203
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,545
Your father has abused you badly.

204
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,911
Why do you give him tension?
Why don't you come on time?

205
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,075
Tell this to him, uncle.

206
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:10,744
Didn't l tell you that every
useless fellow will give us..

207
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,754
..advices if we roam around
useless places at midnight?

208
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:14,256
Yes. You said. -Just miss.

209
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,257
Sister! l am coming.

210
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,424
What? Will you come now?
- Didn't we come, sister?

211
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,729
What is this carnival for?
- Today l underwent scanning.

212
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:28,395
l am going to have a girl child.
That's why this party.

213
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:30,405
Oh! Okay? Will you not give
party if it is a boy?

214
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:32,567
No! What if the boy turns out
to be like you?

215
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:34,936
l am so lucky.

216
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:38,940
Have you seen it?
lt has been 22 years since we are born.

217
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:40,779
Ever did they throw any party?

218
00:21:40,953 --> 00:21:43,114
She is not born yet and
there is already a party.

219
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,450
Attack! -Yes!

220
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,125
Brother, why did you take
2000 rupees from my box in morning?

221
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:58,299
What?

222
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:03,268
Today l saw your boy friend
Raghu in the pub.

223
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,270
With a girl.

224
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:09,144
Brother, did you take the
money or not?

225
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,442
Don't divert the topic.

226
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,313
Sukanya, she is beautiful than you.
That is my fear.

227
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:16,148
She is looking darn good
in a short skit, isn't it?

228
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:18,217
She is superb!

229
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,821
ls there a tattoo on her shoulder?

230
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:24,659
l will teach him a lesson.

231
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:29,664
Don't you have shame for 2000?

232
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:33,969
You too found it?
- Yuck!

233
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:37,472
Okay. Come.

234
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:42,003
Silence! Silence! Don't talk

235
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:45,344
Now father will speak.
Father, speak.

236
00:22:50,355 --> 00:22:54,018
When l first came to Hyderabad.

237
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:00,187
Hey! Stop!

238
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,026
What is that teasing?
Don't you have respect for elders?

239
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:03,190
Don't speak!

240
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,330
Father, you too don't speak.
l will speak.

241
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:08,996
Okay. - One good news is that
one more girl is going..

242
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:11,335
..to take birth instead of
a useless boy.- Father, l will..

243
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,671
Another good news is that
our business..

244
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,347
..turnover has crossed 50 crores.

245
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:19,040
There is another great news than this.

246
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:20,515
This gathering is held for
disclosing the same.

247
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:22,711
This is not a gathering.
lt is bothering.

248
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,220
Our partners from Paris
have put forth a proposal..

249
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,382
..asking us to open a branch there.
l said okay.

250
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:33,224
What is it?

251
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:35,893
They told us to send one person from..

252
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,559
..us for studying the market.

253
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:40,365
That's why l have decided
to select one from..

254
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:44,373
..your generation rather than
my generation.

255
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:47,205
They can take another person
with them if they wish.

256
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:49,244
Nephew, give it.
- Take it.

257
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:54,084
Everybody's name is put
in this except one.

258
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:55,743
Why didn't you put my name?

259
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:58,082
You came to know that your name
is not in it even without being told.

260
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:00,589
So you must also know why
we didn't put it.

261
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:03,592
So do something.

262
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:05,593
Give me in writing saying
that l am not your son.

263
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,095
l will leave this house.

264
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,930
Oh! Bring a stamp paper.
l will write it right now.

265
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:11,934
Wait, brother!
- Go! Go!

266
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,071
What is all this?

267
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:15,934
Did you think that l will leave
the house if you leave out my name?

268
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:17,939
l will send everyone present here
to jail and then leave.

269
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,407
To jail? Why?

270
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,409
What, aunt?

271
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,105
Don't you know that it is against
the law to undergo scanning?

272
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,445
Brother, he might do it.

273
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:33,955
So what?
- lnclude his name too.

274
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:37,618
Revathi! - Brother, l will be debarred
from the medical council.

275
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:38,956
Okay.

276
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:41,622
You have achieved it.
- What did you think then?

277
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:44,291
Hey, take me too if your name comes.

278
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:46,266
l never saw Paris even in books.

279
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:47,928
You? No chance.

280
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,303
Ram!

281
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:58,472
Yes. l know. Thank you.
- Sit down. Sit down.

282
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,611
Hey, Raghava!- Yes, brother!
- Ask whom he will take with him.

283
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,650
Hey! ls it me?

284
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:04,652
Uncle! We are very close
since childhood.

285
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:05,812
Who else will he take?

286
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,161
Nonsense!

287
00:25:17,336 --> 00:25:18,667
There are so many people
in the house.

288
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:20,965
Nobody knows where Sravanthi went.

289
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,470
So what are you all doing?

290
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:26,467
Sir, we have inquired with
Sravanthi's friends.

291
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,010
They say they don't know anything.

292
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,807
l am not sure if they are
telling the truth.

293
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:32,347
But if you say yes then
we will file a complaint with..

294
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:35,008
..the police and inquire
at all airports and railway stations.

295
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:40,181
No. No. She was asking for freedom.
She must be somewhere around.

296
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,350
lf this matter gets leaked
then it will be a problem for us.

297
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:45,185
Let us wait for some more time.

298
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:53,501
Hey, Ram! How are you?
How is the journey?

299
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:55,003
lt is going on since long time.

300
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,333
ls it?
- Give it to me. Hey..

301
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,499
How is Paris? -Who is it?

302
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:01,840
lt is me. Sukanya.
- ls that you, Sukku?

303
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,845
How badly you tortured me
for mere 2000.

304
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,847
Do you know what my range is now?

305
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:10,044
White people carry my luggage
and Benz car drives me around.

306
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:12,554
You are acting smart.
Come to lndia. l will see you.

307
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,052
Why did you become silent?

308
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:18,060
Hey! Ramya.

309
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,222
lt seems there is something burning around.
- Hey! Give it!

310
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,890
Hey, Ram! -l didn't finish talking.

311
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:24,558
You rogue! You would take me
to all worst places..

312
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:26,203
..when you were in Hyderabad.

313
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:29,204
But now will go alone to Paris.
l am feeling jealous here.

314
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:33,071
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't feel jealous
of few people in life.

315
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:35,076
Ranji in style, Sachin in cricket,
Rahman in music..

316
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,238
And it is me from our house.

317
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:41,583
Aunt, he is giving punches to me.

318
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,244
Hey! ls it Ram? Give it to me! Hey, Ram!

319
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:47,256
How are you?- Tell him..
- Hey! Go inside!- Tell me! Tell me!

320
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:02,570
Luck is chasing me like a dog.

321
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:05,471
Excuse me, sir. Passport please.
- Yes.

322
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:08,906
Thank you. -Keep the change.
- Where were we? -Dog.

323
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:13,278
Dog.. You know puppy?
- Puppy? Hey, l like puppies a lot.

324
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:16,114
Bring 4, 5 puppies when you come.
Don't forget.- Hello.

325
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:20,122
By the way, why did you leave
our Ramesh and go?- Yes. Okay.

326
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,125
Okay. Okay. Dear, give the phone.
- Take it, brother-in-law.

327
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:26,119
Hey.. - Father?

328
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:29,461
Do you know where you are now?
ln front of wine factory.

329
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,930
Wine factory? Father, l like wine.

330
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:36,131
Too much, father.

331
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:37,832
Turn back and see.

332
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:42,311
The car that brought you has left.
- Yes.

333
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,949
They must have taken your passport too.
- Yes.

334
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,778
Hey! Listen to me carefully.

335
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:51,320
From today you are a coolie
in that wine factory.

336
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:56,317
You have to earn your bread
and butter by yourself.

337
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:58,486
Finally you only have to earn
the expenses required..

338
00:27:58,663 --> 00:28:02,827
..to travel back to lndia.

339
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,992
lt means you need to
slog down like a donkey.

340
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,139
Then you will understand what life is.

341
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,968
lt is difficult to escape from there.

342
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:13,804
lt is not a palace. lt is prison.

343
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:17,638
Father!

344
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:19,181
What is this, brother?

345
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,978
Not that only he knows
the sketches and schemes.

346
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,017
l too know them. l am his father.

347
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:25,679
Will you steal money from
me citing income tax?

348
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,848
Fights, police stations..
Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

349
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,857
l gave him many chances
but he didn't change.

350
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,189
That's why l made this plan.
He has fallen.

351
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:37,700
Brother.. Then what about the
branch in Paris.. Chits..

352
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:39,530
lt is my plan.

353
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:41,832
l wrote his name in all chits.

354
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:43,838
But you said you will send
one person with him.

355
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,672
Who else will he take other
than this rogue? He has escaped.

356
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:49,837
Just miss.

357
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:51,710
Brother, you have committed
a big mistake.

358
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,215
He doesn't have a mother.

359
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,546
He is taking advantage of
this sentiment.

360
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,880
He should go through this.

361
00:28:57,055 --> 00:28:59,216
His boss over there is not
an ordinary person.

362
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:02,554
Very strict. Disciplined.
lron man.

363
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,718
My friend. Pulla Reddy.

364
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,557
Hey, Pandu. Tell me
why l am beating you.

365
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,396
l told you to crush grapes
and make juice.

366
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,198
Will you eat 25 kilograms like a pig?

367
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:15,361
Don't beat me, sir!
- Will you eat like a pig?

368
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,031
Sir.. -Did you give some gap
or ate everything together?

369
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:19,403
Sir, l was hungry and
l didn't know it.

370
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:21,239
Did you feel hungry? Eat me too!

371
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,881
Oh! Oh! lt is okay, sir.
There is lot of waste material in it.

372
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:27,044
Oh! Sir, he is the son of
your friend Krishna Rao..

373
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:28,241
..from Hyderabad.

374
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,752
Oh! ls that you?

375
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:34,255
You look innocent.
But they said you are a tough guy.

376
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:40,428
lf you wag your tail here,
l will cut it.

377
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,092
Henceforth live on your earnings.

378
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,570
Otherwise spend your entire life here.

379
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:53,070
One bottle ofjuice is made
by crushing..

380
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:54,745
..25 kilograms of grapes.

381
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:57,074
One bottle fetches you 5 rupees.

382
00:29:57,282 --> 00:30:00,080
lf you pay 5 rupees,
you will get half bottle of water.

383
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,447
Sir, what is the ticket fare to Hyderabad?
- 45,000 rupees.- 45..

384
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:07,614
lt means 9000 bottles.

385
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,625
Will l not go to Hyderabad if l
don't crush 25,000 kilograms of grapes?

386
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:13,457
Hey, take him with you.

387
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,962
ls Pulla Reddy your father's friend?

388
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:21,436
ls he your father's friend too?
- Yes.

389
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,604
Friend of my father too.

390
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,100
So are they running this
like a business?

391
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:30,645
No. lf the children of rich fathers'
enjoy their father's status..

392
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:33,478
So are you rich?
- Yes.

393
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,150
How did you enjoy..

394
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:42,156
Everyone would call me
Romeo Raja in Vizag.

395
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:47,321
Any girl would fall for me.

396
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:51,666
100 wickets went down.
My father couldn't tolerate it and..

397
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:57,131
Being so rich you have eaten
25 kilograms of grapes..

398
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,707
lt is hitting somewhere.

399
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:00,633
lsn't it?

400
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:05,839
Good morning, madam Anusuya.
Coffee please.

401
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,973
What is that?
- Why is he addressing the car as madam..

402
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:07,982
...Anusuya and giving it coffee?

403
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:11,520
Pulla Reddy's mother Anusuya died
suddenly in this car.

404
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,521
That 's why this car is
sentiment for him.

405
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:14,522
ls it sentiment for dead
people and punishment..

406
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:17,184
..for people who are alive?
- Not only coffee..

407
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:18,852
Lunch in afternoon..
Dinner at night..

408
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,021
Alcohol too is offered on festivals.

409
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:30,168
Hey, friend. New admission? Come.

410
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,366
Come, friend. Come.

411
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,842
What? Did he say that he belongs
to a rich family?

412
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:37,846
Don't believe it.
They are my sycophants.

413
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:41,713
My father booked tickets for them too
saying enjoy Paris tour.

414
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:45,049
l got a doubt then.
But these rogues didn't believe me.

415
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,884
They suppressed my freedom
like this by thinking..

416
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:48,719
...of enjoying Paris tour for free.

417
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:51,054
Why did you stop?

418
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:53,561
We will get food only
if we crush 60 bottles by evening.

419
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:56,223
Crush them! Crush them!
Paris is taking my life.

420
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,892
Mister, this is not wine.

421
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,197
lt is our blood.
Start music!

422
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,752
Swamy, our house has changed
after he left the house.

423
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:20,755
You stop. There is peace
in the house after he left.

424
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,756
l worked hard and made this
plan for sending him there.

425
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,417
He will not understand unless
he works hard.

426
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:25,426
What, father?

427
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:30,091
Krishna...you think you have sent him.

428
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:35,573
Lot of strange incidents will
take place in his life.

429
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,741
Everything for good.

430
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:47,084
Mother! Where is my mother?

431
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,956
My goodness!
Why is the same factory seen?

432
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:24,985
What is this? Suicide case?

433
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,499
Hey, you!

434
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:37,050
Are you talking to me?
- Then?

435
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,220
Are you really talking to me?

436
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:42,059
Yes. l am talking to you.

437
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:45,559
lt seems she has become mad
and thereby roaming around Paris.

438
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:50,871
Hey! Mrs. Anasuya!

439
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,039
Mrs. Anasuya!

440
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:06,583
Oh!

441
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:20,234
Take him away?
- Hey! What is this?

442
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:21,565
Mother!

443
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,606
Leave me!...

444
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:27,067
Did you try to escape? Bring him!

445
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:29,236
What are you watching?

446
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:33,411
All this happened because of you.
Jump! Jump!

447
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:34,778
Jump and die!

448
00:35:37,622 --> 00:35:38,782
With whom is he talking?

449
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:40,288
You will die if you don't jump.

450
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:43,120
Hey! With whom are you talking?

451
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:45,360
Where is she?

452
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:50,032
Hey! You! -Go!

453
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,597
What is it with him?
Has he gone mad?

454
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:01,643
Sir, mother is coming.

455
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:05,449
Hey!

456
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,141
Hey! l am sparing you because
you are my friend's son.

457
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:09,981
Otherwise l would have drowned
you in that..

458
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:12,315
..river by putting you inside a bag.
- Sir.. Sir.. Sir..

459
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,982
Enough! l will leave Johnny at night.

460
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,821
Should l fear if you leave Johnny?

461
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:19,657
l will not fear Johnny or Tony.

462
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:22,322
Not just me, we all will
escape this time. What, Romeo?

463
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,331
No chance.
Who you do think Johnny is.

464
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,629
ls it a dog?
- No. Tiger.- Tiger?

465
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,850
Sir.. Sir.. Sir.. Save me, sir.

466
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:45,519
Sir, it is me.
You have seen me in the morning.

467
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,181
You? lt was good that
l saw you in the morning.

468
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,519
Otherwise l would have
thought you are a devil.

469
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:51,685
Sir, are you afraid of devil?

470
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,092
Deadly!

471
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,864
Well, what are you doing here?

472
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:58,696
Sir, four goons are chasing me.

473
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,839
l escaped them and reached.
And you are present here.

474
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:04,505
What is your fate, sir?

475
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,506
Why? What happened to my fate?

476
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,008
What, sir?
Why do you say that?

477
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:12,513
When l saw you in the morning
l thought what a handsome guy.

478
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,709
Those eyes.. Style.. Personality..

479
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:17,445
l was totally impressed.

480
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:20,884
When l saw you for the first time,
l too felt the same.

481
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,890
But l don't talk rubbish like this.

482
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:25,722
Continue.. l mean you got impressed..

483
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:28,058
Yes, l was totally impressed.

484
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:29,392
But l couldn't tolerate when
those rowdies..

485
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,229
..were dragging you away like a dog.

486
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:39,206
31 10

487
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:42,369
And over here you seem to be
living in jail..- Hey, father!

488
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:43,547
What, sir?

489
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:45,739
Why do you address father like
that without showing any respect?

490
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,908
Then what? ls he a human being?

491
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,410
l am college topper in my city.

492
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:54,251
l couldn't study properly due to the
T-20 matches in last semester.

493
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:55,255
l told him frankly

494
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:56,916
that l will get second rank
and you have to adjust with it.

495
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,924
But that person didn't show
any mercy and..

496
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,260
..thereby sent me here like a coolie.

497
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:06,229
Sir, is it necessary to come this
far for working as coolie?

498
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:08,064
l will escape from there.

499
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,069
He said Paris.

500
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,764
l slipped over there and
fell down here.

501
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:14,070
Don't feel bad anymore.
What is your story?

502
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:21,411
l told very fast.
You too say like that. Start.

503
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,112
My name is Sravanthi.
l am from Nellor.

504
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,620
l am studying medicine final year.

505
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,624
l met a friend by name
Janvu on Facebook.

506
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:31,955
He looks very handsome.

507
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,462
l fell for him watching
his profile picture.

508
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:39,596
He would send me funny jokes daily.

509
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:43,263
As the days passed by,
our friendship turned into love.

510
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:47,801
Oh! There is lot of romance
behind her.

511
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,442
He said.. Come to Paris,
we will get married.

512
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:54,608
l came. But..

513
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:56,480
Did he have fun with you?

514
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:58,982
Sir?- Then why are you crying?

515
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:02,315
Janvu.. - Janvu..

516
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:04,154
Janvu is a 40 year old man.

517
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:06,660
Then profile picture?
- Graphic.

518
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,296
Janvu..

519
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:18,206
Silly girl.

520
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,641
What can l do, sir?

521
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:22,843
l too slipped like you
when l heard Paris.

522
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,180
Hey! What? Are you making fun?

523
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,648
ls it okay if you make fun of me?

524
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:32,850
Tell me.
-Janvu's age and money are more.

525
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:35,857
He has sent rowdies
when l escaped from him.

526
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:39,019
l will stay here for one night.
Please!

527
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:41,695
What is that sound, sir?

528
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:44,596
Tiger. -Tiger?

529
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,163
Yes. Will you see? Come.

530
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,507
What a silly boy?- Hey!

531
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:00,515
Sir, it is not an original tiger.

532
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:03,711
You know blue rays?
German technology.

533
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:06,379
Through the blue rays they
create a high definition image..

534
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:08,718
..that makes the image look realistic.

535
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,728
So..
- lt is not a tiger.

536
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,563
That is..
- Blue ray.

537
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:21,035
Which is..
- German technology.

538
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:22,900
Yes. Good boy.

539
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:33,706
Where is she?

540
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:41,418
Not an original tiger?
How do you know?

541
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:42,581
You know blue ray?

542
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,421
You?

543
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:46,085
You?- No.

544
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:47,754
Bloody illiterates.

545
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:49,593
Blue ray, lt is a German technology..

546
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:58,402
lt is not a tiger.
lt is a blue ray.

547
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:03,111
Whatever it is,
l am escaping this night.

548
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,579
lf anybody from you wants freedom,
come with me.

549
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,948
What is that discussion?
Will you stop it and work?

550
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:12,282
Or should l increase
the size of drums? Crush it!

551
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:16,791
Will you scare me using useless
technology and create tiger?

552
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:18,121
l will see you.

553
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:20,620
Mister, l too..
Hey, come. Come. Fast.

554
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,480
Tiger!

555
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,157
lt is a real tiger!

556
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:51,989
Yes! Come! Come! -Tiger!

557
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:56,497
You said that it is some effect.
Run! Tiger!

558
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:32,358
Oh, my god! Hey!
- Run! Tiger is coming!

559
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:34,663
Tiger! -Raja!

560
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,331
Come! Run!

561
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,500
Lie down! Lie down!

562
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:48,381
Get up!

563
00:42:56,227 --> 00:43:00,391
Hey, don't you wish to live?
l will shoot all of you.

564
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:03,894
Sir, he said it is not a tiger.
lt is a blue film.

565
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:06,866
lt is not blue film. lt is blue ray.
-Shut up!

566
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:09,370
Are you the reason behind this?

567
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:59,949
Sir! Sir! Sir! Save me, sir.

568
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:05,125
Today also..
Four of them, sir..

569
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:07,787
You are right, sir.
They are chasing me.

570
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:09,796
Janvu gang, sir.

571
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:15,428
Sir, they have started the
projection again.

572
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,430
German Technology.

573
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:21,135
My boy.. Come on.. Come on..

574
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:22,609
l will hit you!

575
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:25,638
Get out! First get out!

576
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:27,307
Sir.. -What sir?

577
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:29,146
German technology.. Blue ray..

578
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,810
You have caught me like an ill-fate.

579
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:33,149
l am facing continuous problems
from the time l met you.

580
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:35,155
Sir.. -l will kill you..
l will kill you..

581
00:44:35,326 --> 00:44:38,818
Sir.. -l will kill you!
Go out! l say get out!

582
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:52,169
'My goodness! She doesn't know
it is a real tiger.'

583
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:54,538
'She will die if she goes near
it thinking it to be blue ray.'

584
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:12,522
Where did she go?

585
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:37,218
What Johnny?
Why do you look so dull?

586
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:42,719
Sir, that fat guy fell on stomach.

587
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,724
Stomach is paining.

588
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,561
Okay. Okay. Drink one peg.

589
00:45:53,237 --> 00:45:55,364
Enough! Enough! Go and do the work.

590
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:57,868
Come out. l will tell you.

591
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:03,576
Next?

592
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:05,875
What is this? He is having a
discussion instead of getting scared.

593
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,315
l will jump.- Tell me.
- What will l tell?

594
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:15,255
My goodness! He removed it!

595
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,087
Did l run so far by getting
scared of you?

596
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:20,094
One! Two! Three! Now enough!

597
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:22,926
This tiger is injured from top to bottom.
Spare me, brother.

598
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,432
So do something.
Go and bring my passport.

599
00:46:25,603 --> 00:46:27,070
Oh, yes. Oh! No!

600
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,728
Pulla Reddy has hidden
it inside the locker.

601
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:30,396
So wait. l will tell this
matter to everyone.

602
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:31,268
Brother! lf Pulla Reddy comes
to know then he will kill me..

603
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,742
He is doing great business
in this area because of me.

604
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,745
l don't know what and
how you are going to do.

605
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,282
First let me escape from here.
l will take care of the rest.

606
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:43,784
Deal is okay.

607
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:49,949
Hey! Hey! Hey! My bag!

608
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:52,459
This is more for you. Go away!

609
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:10,007
'l say get out!'

610
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:12,639
l shouted unnecessarily.

611
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:22,148
Hi! -Hi!
-What? Jumped again?

612
00:47:22,326 --> 00:47:23,816
Hey, who is that elder person?

613
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:27,820
Who? Him? Janvu.

614
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:29,659
Janvu..
- l have decided to marry him.

615
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:31,994
Why do you say that you will marry him?

616
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:34,967
70 year old man.
Will he look like Mahesh Babu?

617
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:38,036
Fate! l will adjust.

618
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:39,809
l will not adjust even if you adjust.

619
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:42,138
Hey, what are you and your beauty?

620
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:43,677
What is it with that old man?

621
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:47,147
Didn't you say that l am ill-luck?
Bad time.

622
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,978
Anyways, l cannot go to lndia.

623
00:47:49,153 --> 00:47:52,350
l will become Mrs. Janvu
in the next two days.

624
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:57,020
Janvu! Janvu! Janvu! Janvu!
l feel irritated with the name.

625
00:47:57,194 --> 00:47:58,752
What do you want?
You want to go to lndia, isn't it?

626
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:02,021
Leave it to me. l will take care.

627
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:04,857
You will say like that now.
After that you will scold.

628
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:07,833
Oh! l will not scold.
Promise. l will not scold.

629
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:09,336
Okay. Then one condition.

630
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:10,666
You shouldn't take advantage
and touch me..

631
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:12,832
..since l am depending on you.

632
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:13,999
You shouldn't tell me any work.

633
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:15,839
l will not touch you even by mistake.

634
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:17,844
You say that you will not do any work.
What does it mean?

635
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:21,007
l will sweat if l do work.
And l hate sweat.

636
00:48:21,185 --> 00:48:23,551
Not only her beauty
but her pride too is big.

637
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,053
Have you seen it?...
You are thinking immediately.

638
00:48:26,223 --> 00:48:29,056
lt is nothing. l am thinking
how to take you to lndia.

639
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:38,057
o you don't have passport.
Then how will you take me.

640
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:45,539
Okay. Do as l say.
Don't ask why and what. Okay?

641
00:48:49,413 --> 00:48:50,744
How, DK?

642
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,577
For one week she left the house in the
morning and returned by evening.

643
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:54,911
Now she is not coming
home at all.

644
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:56,246
l don't understand
what l should do.

645
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,083
You don't worry, sir.
We will find where madam Sravanthi is.

646
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:05,417
Yes.

647
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:07,587
Sir, there is someone here
who says he is..

648
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:09,426
..your friend's son from Hyderabad.

649
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,431
Yes. Yes. Send him in.

650
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:16,899
Good morning, sir.
- Are you Sharat's son?

651
00:49:17,074 --> 00:49:20,737
Mr. Sharat is his close friend.
Poor man. He died six months back.

652
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:23,243
So he will become bit emotional
after seeing you.

653
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:25,847
l didn't think that Sharat will
die suddenly like this.

654
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:28,949
l couldn't come.

655
00:49:30,454 --> 00:49:32,285
Don't over react.

656
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:35,114
Well, how many siblings are you?

657
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:37,123
l am alone.
- Correct.

658
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:39,626
lt was when you were born
that l saw Sharat for the last time.

659
00:49:39,797 --> 00:49:41,958
By the way, what for you
came to Paris?

660
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:43,793
Uncle, l came on Europe tour
with my friends.

661
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:45,628
Someone has stolen
my bag two days back.

662
00:49:45,803 --> 00:49:47,270
My passport was in it.

663
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:50,467
l was thinking what to do
and l remembered you.

664
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:52,768
When you ask for passport,
he will get a doubt.

665
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:55,776
Well, what is the guarantee
that you are Sharat's son?

666
00:49:55,946 --> 00:49:57,641
You tell him without
holding any fear,

667
00:49:57,815 --> 00:49:58,804
Uncle, he would always
say that you passed..

668
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:01,975
..intermediate exams by
copying from his paper.

669
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,144
After that in college,
you were involved with a girl..

670
00:50:04,321 --> 00:50:07,154
Okay. Okay. Well,
where are you staying? -Hotel.

671
00:50:07,324 --> 00:50:08,313
Why don't you come to my house?

672
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,820
You will get caught
if you go to house.

673
00:50:10,994 --> 00:50:13,485
No, uncle. l will stay with friends.

674
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:16,497
lf you look into passport's
matter immediately..

675
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:22,969
Give your photo and details
to my secretary outside.

676
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,506
Come and collect your passport day
after tomorrow at 3 o'clock.

677
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,974
lf you face any problem before
that then show this card.

678
00:50:28,145 --> 00:50:29,134
Okay, uncle.

679
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,977
Your daughter, uncle?

680
00:50:33,684 --> 00:50:35,015
Hey!- Bye, uncle.

681
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:38,678
How did you say it so correctly?
Who is he?

682
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,188
How do you know him?
Why didn't you come?

683
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,689
Had you come then it
would have happened easily.

684
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:45,859
Didn't l say not to ask
what and why?

685
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:48,691
He is Janvu's friend.
l can tell you till there.

686
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,194
l will get the passport.
That is okay.

687
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:55,327
But for going to lndia..
- l will tell you that later.

688
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:57,667
Two more days are left for
getting the passport.

689
00:50:57,841 --> 00:51:01,004
We have to earn money
if we have to survive till then.

690
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:04,011
How? But how?

691
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:07,048
Do as l say.
lf you do then
you will get money.

692
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:11,382
Sir, l don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.

693
00:51:11,555 --> 00:51:13,887
Sir, l don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.

694
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:16,548
Hey, Ram. Look over there.

695
00:51:19,062 --> 00:51:20,222
Go there and do it.

696
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:27,533
Excuse me, madam.
- What?

697
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:30,195
Sir, l don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.

698
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:40,376
Excuse me, sir.

699
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:43,212
Sir, l don't have money to eat.
Give me some work.- Okay.

700
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,607
Hey! What are you doing?
- Sir, movie aside!

701
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,248
Stop! Stop! -Stop! Look!

702
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:14,407
No. -Sir!
- He is dead!

703
00:52:18,956 --> 00:52:20,787
Wonderful! Superb idea.

704
00:52:22,626 --> 00:52:24,457
Do this on road.

705
00:52:41,812 --> 00:52:42,801
Put money.

706
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,993
'l will sweat if l do work.
And l hate sweat.'

707
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:14,674
Boss, who is that girl?

708
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,006
That girl?
Daughter of lndian ambassador.

709
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:30,853
What? Why are you silent?

710
00:53:31,028 --> 00:53:32,359
Which place you said that
you belong to? Nellore?

711
00:53:32,529 --> 00:53:34,690
Yes. Nellore.- Nellore.

712
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:38,528
Janvu.- Yes. Janvu!
- Janvu!

713
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:42,665
What happened to Janvu now?
- Nothing has happened to him.

714
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:46,502
But you would have married him and
settled down if he was bit young.

715
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:49,702
But he is old and so you left him.

716
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,043
What?
Why are you talking differently?

717
00:53:53,216 --> 00:53:56,879
Sravanthi, if your love was true
then marry Janvu.

718
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:58,385
Come.
- Where?

719
00:53:58,555 --> 00:54:00,546
To Janvu. Come!

720
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:02,214
Don't come closer to me.
l will not come.

721
00:54:02,392 --> 00:54:04,451
Then you too don't come chasing me.

722
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:06,893
Good bye.

723
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:12,224
Don't go by leaving me.
Please, Ram!- Bye!

724
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:29,545
Help! Help me.

725
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:37,086
Help!...

726
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:35,508
Why did you come again?

727
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,046
Oh! You didn't feel like
going by leaving me.

728
00:56:40,684 --> 00:56:42,379
You have misunderstood me.

729
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:45,386
l really loved him.
But he is not a good person.

730
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:46,715
l will thrash you!

731
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:50,724
How do l look?
Do you think l am mad?

732
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:54,227
l came to know everything.
You are ambassador's daughter.

733
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:57,560
lf you say Janvu and rubbish
then l will strangle you.

734
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:00,396
Fraud! Fraud!
- Who is fraud?

735
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,538
You couldn't survive in the factory
forjust two days.

736
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:05,698
But l lived like a prisoner
for ten years.

737
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:09,208
Everywhere l went, there was security.
My friends too left me.

738
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:10,710
l had been through torture.

739
00:57:10,914 --> 00:57:14,315
That's why l wanted to
live my own life. ls it a mistake?

740
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:19,252
l was afraid to go to lndia alone.
And then l met you.

741
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:21,754
l have a close friend by name
Savita in Hyderabad.

742
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:24,758
She is a doctor in Gandhi hospital.
l too studied medicine.

743
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:27,260
l decided to settle down
there
with her help.

744
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,593
lf l escape for another two days
from my father's men..

745
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,930
..then l will have freedom all my life.
Please help me.

746
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:38,234
Help? l will do.
But l want 10,000 Euros.

747
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:42,105
What? Are you joking?
Where do l have so much of money?

748
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:43,940
But you said that you will give
money for flight tickets..

749
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:46,742
..when l asked you.
From did you think of bringing it then?

750
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,110
Ram, it is very risky.

751
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:49,752
We shouldn't use that idea expect
at the last minute.

752
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:51,113
Otherwise we will get caught.

753
00:57:51,288 --> 00:57:53,950
Not we will get caught.
You will get caught!

754
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:56,456
The work on which l came to Paris
should be completed.

755
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,787
Otherwise l will directly go to
your father and meet him.

756
00:57:58,962 --> 00:58:02,454
Not for my passport but
to book you permanently.

757
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,462
What do you say?
Deal or no deal?

758
00:58:10,974 --> 00:58:13,272
'Go to the main building
in the university campus.'

759
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:17,303
'After you enter inside..

760
00:58:17,447 --> 00:58:20,314
..go to first floor by taking
the staircase on the right.'

761
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,480
'There are many statues
in the hall.'

762
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:27,487
'The third one belongs to
Albert Richardson.'

763
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:31,487
'My locker's key lies behind it.'

764
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:35,828
'Locker number is 1133.'

765
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:41,964
'My ATM cards are inside a
brown pouch lying in it.'

766
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:50,643
Where is Sravanthi?
-lt is.. l am Sravanthi's friend.

767
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:53,647
Please tell her to go
to her house.

768
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:56,843
Tell her to call at least
her father.

769
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,512
Police is torturing us.
- Okay.

770
00:59:07,697 --> 00:59:10,188
Father! Father!

771
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:14,197
Father! -Hey, son. How are you?

772
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:16,839
Father, my life should become a
lesson to everyone.

773
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:20,340
l want to tell lot of things
if you can call everyone.

774
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:21,670
l will definitely call, dear.

775
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:25,838
Here.. Ramya! Ramesh! Sukanya! Gopi!
Everyone come here.

776
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:29,382
Father, has everyone come?
Now turn the speaker on.

777
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:31,543
Okay. Okay.
l did. Now tell.

778
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:35,384
Now pour out your entire grief!
Cry as much as you can.

779
00:59:35,558 --> 00:59:38,391
After that you will not have money
to make any call.

780
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:42,224
Forgive me, father.
Now l have understood what life is.

781
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:45,061
Did you think that l will say
like this, Mr. Father?

782
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:53,699
What, father?
Will you teach me what life is?

783
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:55,538
Don't try comedy, father.

784
00:59:55,712 --> 00:59:57,873
Hey! Do you know with whom
you are talking to?

785
00:59:58,081 --> 00:59:59,548
Who is this?

786
00:59:59,716 --> 01:00:03,914
Oh! The one who drinks local
liquor in imported glass.

787
01:00:04,087 --> 01:00:05,577
ls it uncle Raghav?

788
01:00:07,257 --> 01:00:09,589
Ram, what are you talking?

789
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:10,748
Aunt..

790
01:00:13,596 --> 01:00:16,258
Tell me, dear.- Aunt..
- Tell me, dear.

791
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:18,765
Aunt!- Hey, tell me!

792
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:22,564
You too joined hands with
them and did this to me.

793
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:25,731
Was my mother doing this
to me if she was alive?

794
01:00:25,909 --> 01:00:28,742
Hey, l too didn't know until you left.

795
01:00:28,912 --> 01:00:30,903
Listen to me.
Have patience for few days and..

796
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:32,741
..then come back as your father said.

797
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:35,282
What, aunt?
Are you playing with me?

798
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:37,443
Look, Mr. Pattapagalu Krishna Rao.

799
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:40,111
For making my life dark..

800
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,281
For torturing an
lndian citizen like this..

801
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:45,622
lPC section 8, 10, 15, 20..

802
01:00:45,795 --> 01:00:48,457

803
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:53,462
l am.. Not yours..

804
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:58,601
''There is a kick felt inside the body.''

805
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:02,438
''The entire body is shaking.''

806
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:21,486
How big is the TVtower?

807
01:01:21,664 --> 01:01:25,498
''Why is it standing in my way?
What is its pride?''

808
01:01:25,668 --> 01:01:29,468
''You are in Paris now.''

809
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:32,631
''This TVtower is the Eiffel tower.

810
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:36,973
''So what is the great thing about it?''

811
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,809
''Nobody is greater than me.''

812
01:01:40,984 --> 01:01:44,681
''Henceforth l am the owner.''

813
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:48,187
''l will give it my name.

814
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:52,021
''You are not the Tippu Sultan
of olden days.

815
01:01:52,195 --> 01:01:56,188
''lt is better if you stop
your bubble like talks.

816
01:01:56,366 --> 01:02:00,029
''Oh, TVtower. You are very tall.''

817
01:02:00,203 --> 01:02:03,661
''Henceforth you and
l will bear the same name.''

818
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:22,718
''Everything is class.
Everything is posh.''

819
01:02:22,892 --> 01:02:26,384
''Money is there.''

820
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:30,221
''Oh, yes.''
''But still the dress is very small.

821
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,234
What to do?''

822
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:38,363
''Paris is like that.''

823
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:42,409
''lt is like this all around.''

824
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:46,037
''This place is synonymous with fashion.''

825
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:50,049
''This place is world famous.''

826
01:02:50,253 --> 01:02:53,916
''Let it be anything.

827
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,753
But is it necessary to do all this.''

828
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:01,419
''Why don't you teach our headgear and..

829
01:03:01,598 --> 01:03:05,261
...loin cloth outfit to these people?''

830
01:03:05,435 --> 01:03:09,064
''Oh, is he is a boy or girl?

831
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:12,902
''He is wearing a pony tail.
He is a queer.''

832
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:16,739
''lt is disgusting in the
name of fashion.

833
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:20,610
''Everybody is confusing.''

834
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:51,103
''What is this romance and
crazy nuisance in public?''

835
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:58,982
''There is no secrecy.
Everything is out in the open.''

836
01:03:59,155 --> 01:04:06,652
''lt is called crime.
Don't watch like that.''

837
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:14,668
''These kinds of scenes
are very common here.''

838
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:22,142
''Have they used superglue
instead of lipstick?''

839
01:04:22,345 --> 01:04:29,842
''Have they locked themselves
in kisses by missing out on life?''

840
01:04:29,986 --> 01:04:33,854
''Oh, my god. You behave as
if you don't know French kiss.''

841
01:04:34,023 --> 01:04:37,515
''You don't talk with
sarcasm like that.''

842
01:04:37,694 --> 01:04:41,186
''l am telling you the truth.
l swear on you.''

843
01:04:41,364 --> 01:04:45,357
''l don't posses any
talent in kissing.''

844
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:56,539
So didn't we go around Paris?

845
01:04:57,547 --> 01:05:01,005
Finished! Everything is finished!

846
01:05:01,184 --> 01:05:04,017
You were sleeping for
18 hours.

847
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:07,712
l tried a lot to wake you up.
But you didn't wake up.

848
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,051
He told you to come at 3 O'clock
for collecting the passport.

849
01:05:10,226 --> 01:05:11,386
Now the time is 4 o'clock.

850
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:13,722
Embassy too will be closed
in another hour.

851
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:16,062
Flight is at 8 o'clock.

852
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,224
l don't think we can make it.
- But l am sure we will.

853
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:25,871
Ram, l will come to the
airport directly.

854
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:28,567
You collect the passport
and wait for me.

855
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:31,043
lf l am not seen then it means that
the security has caught me.

856
01:05:31,214 --> 01:05:33,910
Don't wait for me.
You go.

857
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:36,575
Bye, Ram.
- lt will not happen like that.

858
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:38,914
We both are going to
lndia together. That's it.

859
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:43,585
lt should be circulated *immediately.
- Okay, sir.

860
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,921
Hello, uncle.
- Yes.

861
01:05:46,095 --> 01:05:49,758
Didn't l say my friend's son?
lt is him- Hello.

862
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,761
Find out from David whether
the passport is ready or not.

863
01:05:52,935 --> 01:05:53,833
Sure, sir.

864
01:05:58,441 --> 01:06:00,068
Hello, Subbu.
- David, come in.

865
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,238
What?
Are you sure?

866
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:06,438
Darn it!
- What happened, sir?

867
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:07,947
Money has been withdrawn
from Sravanthi's account.

868
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:10,780
So she is here.
What are you searching?

869
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:13,611
Sir, will you please give the phone?

870
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:16,452
Hello. DK here.

871
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:17,782
lf the money is withdrawn
from ATM then everything..

872
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,450
..will be recorded in
security camera.

873
01:06:19,629 --> 01:06:22,621
Send the video footage
immediately to the embassy's email.

874
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:33,769
We will know within
five minutes who has withdrawn it.

875
01:06:33,943 --> 01:06:36,275
Why will others do it?
Sravanthi will only do it.

876
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:37,275
Uncle, if you give
my passport immediately..

877
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,641
Hey.. What are you we
doing here?
Wait!

878
01:06:39,816 --> 01:06:41,283
Son, we are worried about something.

879
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:42,644
Come and collect the
passport tomorrow.

880
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:44,810
lt is not that, uncle.
lt is urgent..- Get out l say!

881
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:46,819
l said get out!

882
01:06:52,662 --> 01:06:55,495
Excuse me, sir. Passport is ready.
- Oh, that's good.

883
01:06:59,669 --> 01:07:01,296
Okay, you can go.
- Thanks, sir.

884
01:07:10,146 --> 01:07:12,671
He has hidden his
face from camera.

885
01:07:12,849 --> 01:07:17,149
DK, l find both the reasons
that you said are wrong.

886
01:07:17,353 --> 01:07:21,187
He is not her friend.
He is not a thief.- Then sir?

887
01:07:21,357 --> 01:07:24,190
l think she is in love
with this boy.

888
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:29,191
All my doubts have come true in
Sravanthi'a matter since her childhood.

889
01:07:55,224 --> 01:07:57,715
'lf l am not seen then it means that
the security has caught me.'

890
01:07:57,894 --> 01:08:00,294
'Don't wait for me. You go.'

891
01:08:40,603 --> 01:08:41,262
Ram!

892
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,403
Hey!
- Don't talk anything.

893
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:46,234
Come to the Gandhi hospital directly.

894
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:48,400
Dr. Savitha. Don't forget.

895
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:50,909
Hey! Sravanthi!

896
01:08:57,787 --> 01:08:58,776
Excuse me.. Dr. Savitha..

897
01:08:58,955 --> 01:09:01,116
She is in lCU on first floor.
- Thanks.

898
01:09:13,135 --> 01:09:14,625
Yes. Whom do you want?

899
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:17,432
Dr. Savitha..
- Yes. lt is me. Tell me.

900
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:19,438
l am Sravanthi's friend.

901
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:20,939
Sravanthi? Who is Sravanthi?

902
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,635
Sravanthi who lives in Paris..

903
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:25,110
Medical student.. Your friend.

904
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:27,806
Sorry. l don't know any Sravanthi.
l think you are mistaken.

905
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,451
By the way, this is lCU.
You shouldn't enter inside.

906
01:09:29,652 --> 01:09:30,448
Please wait outside.

907
01:09:30,653 --> 01:09:31,984
You are dr. Savitha, isn't it?
-Yes.

908
01:09:32,154 --> 01:09:34,645
No. Sravanthi told me about you.
You too have..

909
01:09:48,337 --> 01:09:49,304
Didn't l tell you to go out..

910
01:09:53,676 --> 01:09:55,667
What happened to Sravanthi, doctor?

911
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:58,040
Do you know this girl?
ls her name Sravanthi?

912
01:09:59,315 --> 01:10:02,182
She was with me at the airport
just half an hour back..

913
01:10:02,318 --> 01:10:03,012
What happened to her, doctor?

914
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:06,018
Accident case. We have admitted
her one week back.

915
01:10:06,188 --> 01:10:07,348
She is lying in coma since then.

916
01:10:07,523 --> 01:10:10,185
We are worried because
we don't know who she is.

917
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:13,688
Admitted one week back?

918
01:10:13,863 --> 01:10:16,855
You stay here. l will talk
to my superintendent.

919
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,361
Sir, we have admitted a
coma patient last week.

920
01:10:20,536 --> 01:10:22,663
Her acquaintance has come.

921
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:40,215
Thank god! Nothing happened
to you, right?

922
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:42,550
Have you seen this girl?
She looks exactly like you.

923
01:10:44,727 --> 01:10:47,719
l have brought you so far
for showing you this.

924
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:51,726
Your sister?

925
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,038
What happened, Sravanthi?

926
01:11:00,209 --> 01:11:04,543
l too was excited like you
to enjoy life.

927
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:06,544
But because of my father's position..

928
01:11:06,749 --> 01:11:09,081
..l have grown up in the midst
of tight security.

929
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:13,745
His position and status
has robbed me of my freedom.

930
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:18,087
Two weeks back my father went
to America on conference work.

931
01:11:19,762 --> 01:11:21,423
l took advantage of it and
escaped from the..

932
01:11:21,597 --> 01:11:25,761
..house alone with the
help of uncle Madhav.

933
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:27,766
l would go out and enjoy
a lot with friends.

934
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:33,772
One day my car gave
some trouble and..

935
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:35,774
...l was waiting at a restaurant.

936
01:11:35,945 --> 01:11:39,938
Over there l saw DK who was
supposed to be with my father.

937
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:43,415
l got suspicious and
thereby followed him.

938
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:58,630
l was shocked to see
DK meeting the..

939
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:00,792
..most wanted terrorist
wanted by lndian government.

940
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:12,804
DK saw me and chased me to kill me.

941
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:16,608
l tried a lot to tell this
matter to my father.

942
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:18,650
But l couldn't reach his number.

943
01:12:22,658 --> 01:12:23,818
Oh! No!

944
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:46,838
Hello. Excuse me.
- Any problem?

945
01:12:47,016 --> 01:12:49,917
Please.. He is trying to kill me.
Save me please.

946
01:12:51,687 --> 01:12:52,847
What is your problem?

947
01:12:56,859 --> 01:12:57,689
Hey, man!

948
01:13:25,054 --> 01:13:26,885
Are you safe?

949
01:13:27,056 --> 01:13:28,546
Don't call anybody because
the entire..

950
01:13:28,724 --> 01:13:30,885
..network is in his control.

951
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,049
lf you tell this matter
to your father..

952
01:13:32,228 --> 01:13:33,058
..then he too will not believe it.

953
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:34,890
DK is suspicious with me.

954
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:37,726
Now l too will get caught for
sending you out.

955
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,061
Tell me where you are.
l will come there.

956
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,240
Madhav uncle felt that it is not
safe for me to stay in Paris.

957
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:55,407
He made arrangements for
sending me to lndia.

958
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:59,581
Here is the duplicate passport.
Name is Kalpana.

959
01:14:00,923 --> 01:14:03,084
There is no option left
to save you, dear.

960
01:14:03,259 --> 01:14:04,749
There is a flight to
Hyderabad after one hour.

961
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,919
My friend Sitaram will pick
you after you get down there.

962
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:09,758
You talk to me from his phone.

963
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:12,423
Till then don't talk to
your father or anybody.

964
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:13,932
You will be caught by DK.

965
01:14:14,103 --> 01:14:16,071
ln case if you face any
problem with immigration..

966
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:18,638
...then our men are present there.
They will take care.

967
01:14:32,955 --> 01:14:35,116
Hey, Koka.- Greetings, sir.

968
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,283
What are you doing here?
- My cousin is coming from abroad.

969
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,621
lt is not more than a week
since you got released from jail.

970
01:14:40,796 --> 01:14:42,787
Have you started a
new business immediately?

971
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:44,796
Whom are you planning
to dupe this time.

972
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:48,130
Microsoft?
When did you join there?

973
01:14:48,304 --> 01:14:49,430
Did you get recruited from jail?

974
01:14:49,605 --> 01:14:52,972
l understood that the person sent
my uncle Madhav is a criminal.

975
01:14:53,108 --> 01:14:55,440
l escaped from them.

976
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,811
Otherwise you will get
thrashed again.

977
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:11,323
Rogue! He came at the right time.

978
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,651
Hey, Giri! Are you ready?

979
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:50,024
Brother, she is dead.

980
01:15:55,504 --> 01:15:57,495
There shouldn't be any evidence
of hers. Check it.- Okay, brother.

981
01:16:05,214 --> 01:16:06,681
How can you say it with
guarantee that she is dead?

982
01:16:06,849 --> 01:16:08,840
Brother, if the person bleeds
from ear then they are dead.

983
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:10,848
No! l didn't die!

984
01:16:11,053 --> 01:16:14,045
Who are you?
Why did you do this to me?

985
01:16:15,391 --> 01:16:16,551
Brother.. Patrolling.

986
01:16:36,245 --> 01:16:37,542
Sir.. Sir..

987
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:43,718
Sir, she is dead.

988
01:16:44,586 --> 01:16:45,245
lnform the station.

989
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:48,254
They have confirmed that
the driver and l have died.

990
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:50,585
They have sent our bodies to mortuary.

991
01:16:50,926 --> 01:16:52,416
l am alive.

992
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:55,256
Please, listen to me.

993
01:16:57,099 --> 01:17:00,262
Doctor! Doctor, please help me.
Please help me.

994
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:04,566
l am alive, doctor.
Listen to me, doctor!

995
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,231
Please! Tell them not to take me.
- What happened, Giri?

996
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:09,400
Madam, she died on the spot.
Accident case.

997
01:17:09,578 --> 01:17:10,909
Anyways you don't give respect
to people who are alive.

998
01:17:11,113 --> 01:17:13,445
At least give respect to
the people who are dead.

999
01:17:18,954 --> 01:17:19,943
Oh! My god!
Her pulse is beating.

1000
01:17:20,122 --> 01:17:21,453
Shift her to the lCU immediately.

1001
01:17:21,623 --> 01:17:23,955
ln this matter Dr. Savitha
shifted me to lCU..

1002
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:25,957
..and started the treatment.

1003
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:29,291
l tried a lot to tell
this matter to my father.

1004
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:31,296
But he didn't listen to me.

1005
01:17:31,467 --> 01:17:33,458
We have inquired all
friends of Sravanthi.

1006
01:17:33,635 --> 01:17:34,932
Everyone is saying
they don't know anything.

1007
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:37,264
Father, don't believe him.
He is lying.

1008
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:40,602
She wanted freedom all the time.
She must be somewhere around.

1009
01:17:40,776 --> 01:17:43,609
lf others come to know this matter
then it will be a problem to us.

1010
01:17:44,313 --> 01:17:49,307
Let us wait for some more time.
- No! No! Father! l am here!

1011
01:17:49,485 --> 01:17:51,476
lf you had acted in haste
and have killed her here..

1012
01:17:51,653 --> 01:17:53,484
..then we would have been
caught easily.

1013
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:55,646
Now we made him say by
himself that..

1014
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:59,487
..she left in the name of freedom.

1015
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:03,825
Though l knew that DK
and uncle Madhav..

1016
01:18:03,999 --> 01:18:05,830
..were behind this,
l couldn't tell this to anyone.

1017
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:08,492
l understood that
l am going to die like..

1018
01:18:08,637 --> 01:18:11,299
..an orphan in an lndian hospital.

1019
01:18:11,473 --> 01:18:13,634
l lost all hopes.

1020
01:18:14,343 --> 01:18:16,811
But you called me and that
gave me a new lease of life.

1021
01:18:19,648 --> 01:18:22,674
There are billions of people
in this world.

1022
01:18:22,818 --> 01:18:25,343
lt was only you who saw me.

1023
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:28,922
Also you were the only person
who talked to me.

1024
01:18:29,358 --> 01:18:32,521
l thought of telling you
everything that time.

1025
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:34,025
But what if you didn't believe.

1026
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:37,188
l was afraid that l will lose
the only hope that l had.

1027
01:18:37,366 --> 01:18:39,527
That's why l brought you so far.

1028
01:18:39,701 --> 01:18:42,534
l thought of telling you the truth
only after showing you me.

1029
01:18:42,671 --> 01:18:45,663
Till then l remained careful
so that you..

1030
01:18:45,841 --> 01:18:48,002
..wouldn't come to know about me.

1031
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:52,374
That is me.

1032
01:19:13,068 --> 01:19:14,729
lsn't it strange?

1033
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:18,199
There are so many people
in this world.

1034
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:20,364
How is it that only
l am able to see you?

1035
01:19:21,543 --> 01:19:23,534
How come l alone hear your words?

1036
01:19:24,546 --> 01:19:26,639
Even l am not able to
understand it.

1037
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,883
What do you think the reason is?

1038
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,411
'Why didn't l see you?'

1039
01:19:35,424 --> 01:19:36,755
'l want to see you.'

1040
01:19:38,594 --> 01:19:42,086
'l want to see you!'

1041
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:59,741
So you know who that girl is.

1042
01:19:59,915 --> 01:20:02,782
l know. She is my friend.
- Her father..

1043
01:20:02,918 --> 01:20:05,284
lt is good not to tell them
anything until father arrives.

1044
01:20:05,454 --> 01:20:08,290
l know. -Tell me if you know.

1045
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,120
Mr. Jayasuriya.

1046
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,449
What does he do?
- l don't know, sir.

1047
01:20:11,627 --> 01:20:13,117
Her mother?
- Mrs. Jayasheela.

1048
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:15,126
Oh! What does she do?

1049
01:20:15,964 --> 01:20:17,295
She married Mr. Jayasuriya.
- Okay.

1050
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:17,795
Sir, l don't know what
she did after that.

1051
01:20:19,635 --> 01:20:21,466
Am l talking correctly?
- Correct, sir.

1052
01:20:21,637 --> 01:20:23,434
Do you know where they are?
- ln Africa.

1053
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:25,766
Where in Africa? -l don't know, sir.

1054
01:20:25,941 --> 01:20:28,102
Africa is not a village or a country.

1055
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,608
lt is a continent.
There are 56 countries in it.

1056
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:33,771
Population is 100, 03, 65, 690.
They are...

1057
01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:36,315
Superb, sir! Today l learnt a
lot of information from you.

1058
01:20:36,485 --> 01:20:39,147
But l am not getting anything from you.
- Sir, l have an idea.

1059
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:41,312
How about giving an ad in
the entire Africa.

1060
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:43,651
You and l should sell everything
that belongs to us.

1061
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:46,157
Don't give suggestions for fun.
- Now you may go.- Okay.

1062
01:20:46,328 --> 01:20:47,317
lf you remember something then come
and tell me.- Okay, sir.

1063
01:20:47,496 --> 01:20:48,986
Pen is mine.
- Okay, sir.

1064
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:52,322
What?

1065
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:54,162
Why did you confuse him like that?

1066
01:20:54,336 --> 01:20:56,702
Why? l was in confusion and
in addition to that..

1067
01:20:58,974 --> 01:21:00,805
Well, you are a devil..

1068
01:21:01,977 --> 01:21:04,502
lf one dies then only they
are called devil.- She is still alive.

1069
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:08,847
Then spirit.. l mean soul..

1070
01:21:08,984 --> 01:21:11,509
Consider it anything. First talk slowly.

1071
01:21:11,687 --> 01:21:14,349
Why? -Everyone is watching you.

1072
01:21:20,696 --> 01:21:23,028
Everyone is thinking me
as mad, isn't it?

1073
01:21:27,536 --> 01:21:31,336
Ram, l should call up my father
and tell him everything.

1074
01:21:31,506 --> 01:21:37,843
Hail! -Farmers employee! Rajanna!...

1075
01:21:38,013 --> 01:21:39,002
The present force is not
sufficient, sir.

1076
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:42,014
Send additional force.
Please. Okay.

1077
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:43,711
Excuse me, sir. -Yes.
- What is the matter?

1078
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:47,713
Doctors said that their leader
will die if he undergoes fast.

1079
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:50,221
That's why we are giving him treatment
after arresting him.

1080
01:21:50,392 --> 01:21:53,884
This sloganeering is for the same.
Hey! Don't allow inside. Hey!

1081
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:57,221
Hey! -We have to see Rajanna!

1082
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:00,561
Boss, l have to make a call to Paris.
- Do it.

1083
01:22:01,236 --> 01:22:03,704
Don't take it easy.
l am very serious about the decision.

1084
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,203
Sir, listen to me carefully.
Don't ask who l am.

1085
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,207
l know you are searching
for your daughter.

1086
01:22:10,412 --> 01:22:13,040
She is lying here in a government
hospital in Hyderabad.

1087
01:22:13,215 --> 01:22:16,048
Your chief security officer DK
is responsible for all this.

1088
01:22:16,218 --> 01:22:18,049
He has got links with
the terrorists' organizations.

1089
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:19,242
He tried to kill your daughter
too when he came..

1090
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:21,252
..to know that your daughter is
aware of it.- Sir, you come fast.

1091
01:22:21,423 --> 01:22:23,084
We will be waiting here in the
government hospital.

1092
01:22:23,258 --> 01:22:24,418
She badly needs your help.

1093
01:22:27,095 --> 01:22:28,756
Who is it, DK? Anything important?

1094
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,090
Wrong number, sir.

1095
01:22:30,265 --> 01:22:33,757
With your permission l will change
this number for security reasons.

1096
01:22:36,405 --> 01:22:37,394
lt is DK.

1097
01:22:37,906 --> 01:22:39,066
What are you doing there?

1098
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:42,438
Sir, a small love story is at the climax.
Small settlement.

1099
01:22:42,611 --> 01:22:45,239
Tell me. Why did you spare that girl
without killing her?

1100
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:50,251
Hey! Come.

1101
01:22:50,786 --> 01:22:52,617
What are you talking, sir?
She died on the spot.

1102
01:22:52,788 --> 01:22:54,449
Her body is lying in the
Gandhi hospital mortuary.

1103
01:22:54,623 --> 01:22:57,786
Hey, fool! Not in the mortuary.
lt is in lCU.

1104
01:22:57,959 --> 01:23:00,450
Someone has called up.
Go and find out those two people.

1105
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:02,620
lf she is alive then my life
will fall in danger.

1106
01:23:05,467 --> 01:23:07,298
..l had given you lot of trouble.

1107
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:09,437
For how long will you stay here?

1108
01:23:09,604 --> 01:23:13,836
Anyways my father is coming.
He will now take care.

1109
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:16,475
You go.

1110
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:19,273
Oh! Your father is coming, right?

1111
01:23:22,984 --> 01:23:25,316
What? Why are you talking
in a strange manner?

1112
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:29,321
Nothing. You said Janvu is your love.
And that is one lie.

1113
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:30,321
You said you had fallen for me when..

1114
01:23:30,492 --> 01:23:32,323
..you saw me for the first time.
That too is a lie.

1115
01:23:32,661 --> 01:23:36,825
Similarly our meeting too
is going to become a lie. Right?

1116
01:23:40,669 --> 01:23:41,499
Sravanthi..

1117
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,631
Oxygen..

1118
01:23:52,314 --> 01:23:53,838
Hey! Hey! Who are you?

1119
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:58,149
Doctor!

1120
01:24:04,025 --> 01:24:06,858
Connect a fresh cylinder.
lncrease the pressure. Quick!

1121
01:24:27,349 --> 01:24:30,716
Hello. You were outside. How did you
know that the oxygen is finished?

1122
01:24:30,886 --> 01:24:31,545
lt is..

1123
01:24:32,888 --> 01:24:33,718
What?

1124
01:24:34,222 --> 01:24:36,213
l felt something like that.
Therefore l came.

1125
01:24:41,396 --> 01:24:45,389
So if something happens there then
the reaction will be felt here.

1126
01:24:45,901 --> 01:24:47,892
lt is good for me to stay here
till your father comes.

1127
01:24:52,707 --> 01:24:54,732
Hey, stop! Where is your pass?

1128
01:24:55,577 --> 01:24:56,566
Go!

1129
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,377
For how long will you sit like this?

1130
01:25:03,919 --> 01:25:08,253
Go downstairs and eat something.

1131
01:25:09,925 --> 01:25:10,914
Please.

1132
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:28,598
Ram!

1133
01:25:30,412 --> 01:25:33,939
What?- The person who tried to
kill me is going towards lCU.

1134
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:36,781
Ram, it is him.

1135
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,281
So we didn't talk to your father.

1136
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:43,450
Hey, l am Shiva.

1137
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:45,456
Take 10,000 and come to
Gandhi hospital urgently.

1138
01:25:45,627 --> 01:25:46,787
We should get uncle discharged.

1139
01:25:46,962 --> 01:25:49,453
Why? Some person by name Rajanna
has died here.

1140
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:51,462
We will take uncle before
the matter gets leaked.

1141
01:25:52,634 --> 01:25:55,797
Rajanna is dead!

1142
01:26:21,997 --> 01:26:22,986
lt we stay here then it is
dangerous all the time.

1143
01:26:23,164 --> 01:26:24,324
We have to shift urgently.

1144
01:26:27,502 --> 01:26:29,129
Please give me two days time, DK.

1145
01:26:29,337 --> 01:26:32,465
Take it. Take three days.

1146
01:26:32,674 --> 01:26:35,302
lf the work is not done
then you will not stay alive.

1147
01:26:36,478 --> 01:26:40,312
DK, l am afraid that
we will get caught.

1148
01:26:41,683 --> 01:26:44,481
One shouldn't live in fear.
lt is more fearsome.

1149
01:26:45,854 --> 01:26:47,845
Madam, Ram has come.
- Did Ram come?

1150
01:26:48,023 --> 01:26:51,356
He has brought a patient.
He is saying to admit her.

1151
01:26:51,526 --> 01:26:53,858
Okay. Admit her.
l am coming immediately.

1152
01:27:00,702 --> 01:27:03,500
Do you think l am mad to believe
everything you say?

1153
01:27:03,672 --> 01:27:06,334
Soul? Body is here and
soul is there?

1154
01:27:06,508 --> 01:27:09,170
Aunt, it is there.
- Hey, don't act stupid.

1155
01:27:09,344 --> 01:27:11,869
l don't know how l should
make you believe.

1156
01:27:14,516 --> 01:27:16,507
Aunt, you go there.
Sravanthi, you go there.

1157
01:27:16,718 --> 01:27:19,209
Ram.- Come, aunt.
- What are you doing?- l will tell you.

1158
01:27:19,387 --> 01:27:21,548
You go.

1159
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:24,385
What?- Keep your hands behind.
Keep your hands behind.

1160
01:27:24,559 --> 01:27:26,550
Show me some number with your hands.

1161
01:27:28,063 --> 01:27:29,894
Tell me. -Two. -Two.

1162
01:27:32,734 --> 01:27:34,065
Five. -Five.

1163
01:27:34,903 --> 01:27:36,370
Three. -Three.

1164
01:27:36,538 --> 01:27:38,369
One. -One.

1165
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,531
Two. -Two.

1166
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,040
Two... -Two...

1167
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:45,202
She is not changing. She is showing
the same two fingers.

1168
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,371
Two.. Two.. Two.. For how long
will you show two fingers?

1169
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:56,921
Aunt, will you at least now believe me?

1170
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:06,423
Swamy, how come a person's soul leaves
the body when they are alive?

1171
01:28:06,601 --> 01:28:10,059
How come only my nephew is
able to see it?

1172
01:28:10,739 --> 01:28:13,902
l don't believe this.
Why is it happening like this?

1173
01:28:48,443 --> 01:28:49,603
There are many things in
this world that are..

1174
01:28:49,811 --> 01:28:54,145
..beyond science and
technology's reach.

1175
01:28:54,282 --> 01:28:55,442
Some religions believe that
the soul comes out..

1176
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:59,644
..even when the person is alive.

1177
01:29:00,488 --> 01:29:04,652
So Hindu religion believes that
the soul leaves the body..

1178
01:29:04,826 --> 01:29:08,990
..only when the person dies.

1179
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:12,822
There is a strong reason behind
all these happenings.

1180
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:15,162
You will not believe it
even if l say it now.

1181
01:29:15,336 --> 01:29:17,201
Whatever has to happen, will happen.

1182
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:19,834
You do whatever is possible with you.

1183
01:29:19,974 --> 01:29:20,963
Okay, Swamy.
- Greetings.

1184
01:29:23,645 --> 01:29:25,306
What is the reason, Swamy?

1185
01:29:26,848 --> 01:29:29,009
Every human being takes birth
seven times.

1186
01:29:29,184 --> 01:29:33,177
Their love is becoming unsuccessful
since six births.

1187
01:29:33,354 --> 01:29:35,845
Now this is the last birth.

1188
01:29:36,024 --> 01:29:39,357
Love is longing to become successful
at least now.

1189
01:29:39,527 --> 01:29:43,019
Very sad. Will their love succeed
at least in this birth, Swamy?

1190
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:46,031
This is a fight between
destiny and love.

1191
01:29:48,536 --> 01:29:53,496
Destiny will win in this fight.
Destiny will win.

1192
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:57,038
Swamy, pray for their love's victory.

1193
01:29:59,047 --> 01:30:00,344
Oh, god!

1194
01:30:30,912 --> 01:30:32,379
What, aunt? Why don't you speak?

1195
01:30:32,547 --> 01:30:34,538
She will not speak anything now.

1196
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,911
My condition is like that.

1197
01:30:37,418 --> 01:30:40,251
There is a blood clotting inside the brain.
lt should be melt.

1198
01:30:41,422 --> 01:30:44,755
Very critical.
lt is difficult to survive.

1199
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,592
That's why she is afraid to tell you.

1200
01:30:48,763 --> 01:30:51,596
Why are you watching like that?
l am too a medical student.

1201
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,761
l am telling this only after
checking the reports.

1202
01:30:56,738 --> 01:30:59,571
Aunt, is there a blood clotting
inside her brain?

1203
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:02,235
Hey, how do you know?

1204
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:03,741
ls it difficult for her to survive?

1205
01:31:05,413 --> 01:31:07,108
No, dear.
There are chances of survival.

1206
01:31:08,449 --> 01:31:11,282
Recently a medicine has been
invented in German.

1207
01:31:11,452 --> 01:31:13,943
That medicine should be injected into
the brain through blood vessels.

1208
01:31:14,122 --> 01:31:16,454
lf three doses are given in an interval
of 48 hours then..

1209
01:31:16,624 --> 01:31:18,615
..there are chances of that
clot getting melt.

1210
01:31:18,793 --> 01:31:21,353
Then the patient might
come out of coma.

1211
01:31:22,463 --> 01:31:24,795
But there is a risk
involved in it.

1212
01:31:24,966 --> 01:31:26,456
Risk? What risk, aunt?

1213
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:29,626
lf we begin these doses
then the next two doses..

1214
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:32,103
..should be given on time.

1215
01:31:32,273 --> 01:31:34,969
lf there is any delay then
the heart will..

1216
01:31:35,143 --> 01:31:38,135
..stop beating and the
patient might die.

1217
01:31:39,314 --> 01:31:41,976
lt has already happened
with a patient.

1218
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:45,608
After giving the first dose
there was a delay in giving the next dose.

1219
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:47,048
Finally he died.

1220
01:31:47,488 --> 01:31:48,978
l am afraid of the same.

1221
01:31:49,157 --> 01:31:52,149
The two doses brought for
that patient are here.

1222
01:31:52,327 --> 01:31:54,488
We have to bring the third
dose from Germany.

1223
01:31:54,662 --> 01:31:59,156
Main problem is that if we start
the treatment immediately..

1224
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:00,995
..then the patient might survive.

1225
01:32:01,169 --> 01:32:04,138
Then start is immediately, aunt.
- We can start.

1226
01:32:04,305 --> 01:32:06,637
lf we start it without informing
her family then..

1227
01:32:06,808 --> 01:32:09,003
..you will face problem later.

1228
01:32:09,177 --> 01:32:13,011
Aunt, you start it. Let there be
any problem, l will face it.

1229
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,522
Yes.
- What happened, aunt?

1230
01:32:32,867 --> 01:32:36,030
l will make this girl stand
in another four days.

1231
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:39,662
Superb, aunt. Thank you, aunt!
Thank you, aunt!- Okay.

1232
01:32:39,841 --> 01:32:41,172
Love you! Love you! Love you!
- Enough! Leave me!

1233
01:32:41,342 --> 01:32:42,206
Hey! Why are you watching like that?

1234
01:32:42,343 --> 01:32:43,833
Fall at aunt's feet and
seek her blessings.

1235
01:32:44,045 --> 01:32:45,205
God bless you, dear.
God bless you, dear.

1236
01:32:45,346 --> 01:32:47,439
Aunt.. She didn't fall yet.

1237
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:49,839
Didn't fall yet?

1238
01:32:58,393 --> 01:33:01,726
Everything good will happen to you.
You will definitely live, dear.

1239
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:05,393
Ram, l want to see your family.

1240
01:33:05,566 --> 01:33:06,726
Aunt, shall we go home?

1241
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:14,372
Had l found you during that time
then l would have killed.

1242
01:33:14,542 --> 01:33:16,533
Want to come home? Want to come home?

1243
01:33:16,711 --> 01:33:18,144
Where? Where is the girl?

1244
01:33:19,547 --> 01:33:23,074
Look, dear. Both of you keep
talking and stay here.

1245
01:33:23,251 --> 01:33:26,243
Hey, if you have any plans of coming
home then you better forget them.

1246
01:33:27,588 --> 01:33:29,419
Let us go fast. Come. Come.

1247
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:30,579
Come. Come. Come.

1248
01:33:31,259 --> 01:33:34,092
Hey! Who are you?- Come on.
- Why are you entering the house directly?

1249
01:33:34,262 --> 01:33:35,752
ls it Mr. Pattapagalu Krishna Rao's house?
- Yes.

1250
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:37,090
So we came to the right house.

1251
01:33:37,265 --> 01:33:40,098
Come. Let us go inside.
- Hey, stop. Who are you?- Media.

1252
01:33:40,268 --> 01:33:42,896
The state government has announced the
best industrialist award to you.

1253
01:33:43,071 --> 01:33:44,561
Your feelings? -Stop! Stop!

1254
01:33:44,739 --> 01:33:47,731
That award.. Krishna Rao..
He is inside.

1255
01:33:47,909 --> 01:33:50,275
lnside? Come on. Come inside.

1256
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:52,402
What if you are from media?
Will you trample me?

1257
01:33:52,747 --> 01:33:54,510
Come. Come. Good morning, Krishna Rao.

1258
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:57,611
Hey, who are you?

1259
01:33:57,752 --> 01:34:00,619
Media. Government has given the best
industrialist award to you.

1260
01:34:00,955 --> 01:34:02,286
You eat. Don't stop.

1261
01:34:02,457 --> 01:34:04,186
Sir, how many dumplings
you eat every day?

1262
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:07,788
What is the advice that you want to give
to the industrialists of the state.

1263
01:34:08,796 --> 01:34:12,129
Excuse me. Let us sit in the
garden and talk. Come.

1264
01:34:13,134 --> 01:34:14,965
Now tell me. What is the
name of the award?

1265
01:34:15,136 --> 01:34:16,933
lndustrialist.. Pundit of business..

1266
01:34:17,105 --> 01:34:22,600
Beloved entrepreneur..
Acute and leading pioneer..

1267
01:34:22,777 --> 01:34:25,610
lt doesn't look like an award.
lt looks like a letter of appreciation.

1268
01:34:26,614 --> 01:34:29,947
lt is a very prestigious award.
That's why it is so big.

1269
01:34:30,651 --> 01:34:33,313
By the way, how are you
feeling on receiving this award?

1270
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:35,149
Should l tell?

1271
01:34:39,327 --> 01:34:41,488
Father, they have asked for
brother's feelings.

1272
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:43,493
They may feel something else
if you tell your feelings.

1273
01:34:43,664 --> 01:34:47,156
Truly speaking l feel surprised.
- We are shocked.

1274
01:34:47,668 --> 01:34:48,157
He heard it.

1275
01:34:48,336 --> 01:34:50,634
Though l feel surprised for
being chosen for this award..

1276
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:52,636
..in spite of having so many
industrialist in our state..

1277
01:34:53,641 --> 01:34:54,801
l also feel happy.

1278
01:34:56,344 --> 01:34:58,175
Who do you think is behind
your success?

1279
01:34:58,346 --> 01:35:00,814
We have to find the same.
lsn't it, brother?

1280
01:35:01,182 --> 01:35:03,810
There is nobody in front and behind me.
lt is just my handwork.

1281
01:35:03,985 --> 01:35:05,350
How many children do you have?

1282
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,681
One daughter and only one son.

1283
01:35:07,855 --> 01:35:09,516
Revathi, why do you talk about him now?

1284
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:12,352
Sir, where is your son now?
- He is in Paris.

1285
01:35:12,527 --> 01:35:14,859
He should take care of the
business after brother.

1286
01:35:15,029 --> 01:35:16,519
That's why my brother has
sent him to Paris.

1287
01:35:16,697 --> 01:35:18,688
lsn't it, brother?
- Are you missing him?

1288
01:35:18,866 --> 01:35:21,699
Which father wouldn't miss his son?
- Superb, father!

1289
01:35:37,385 --> 01:35:39,046
Congratulations, father!

1290
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,551
Today everyone has come
to know that you are not..

1291
01:35:40,721 --> 01:35:43,053
..only a good father but
also a good businessman.

1292
01:35:44,058 --> 01:35:45,389
l am proud of you, father.
l am proud of you.

1293
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,891
Hey! Hey! Go inside and
freshen up.

1294
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:49,222
Hey, Revathi! -Brother.. Media.

1295
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:54,064
Okay.. Go.
- Father, should l enter the house?

1296
01:35:54,235 --> 01:35:57,204
Are you sure, father?
- Yes.. Sure. You go.

1297
01:35:57,538 --> 01:35:59,699
Okay. One second. Close up.

1298
01:36:00,374 --> 01:36:01,534
Smile, father.

1299
01:36:06,414 --> 01:36:08,575
Hey, you are a big thief.
- Yeah.

1300
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:11,578
Hey, uncle? What's up?

1301
01:36:11,752 --> 01:36:13,583
Your time is good and
because of the media..

1302
01:36:13,754 --> 01:36:15,244
..your father allowed you inside.

1303
01:36:15,423 --> 01:36:17,254
That's why you just missed.

1304
01:36:18,092 --> 01:36:19,252
l have sent it.

1305
01:36:20,094 --> 01:36:21,755
Just twist.

1306
01:36:22,263 --> 01:36:26,927
Hey, is this your sketch?
Wait. l will tell your father.

1307
01:36:27,101 --> 01:36:28,261
Uncle. -What?

1308
01:36:28,436 --> 01:36:32,065
lf you tell about the sketch then
who will drink the scotch lying in my bag.

1309
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,400
l will.

1310
01:36:44,785 --> 01:36:47,447
Anything serious, sir?
- My daughter is in Hyderabad.

1311
01:36:48,456 --> 01:36:50,117
How do you say that, sir?

1312
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:51,622
The other day a person
took the passport..

1313
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:53,282
..saying he is the son of my friend.

1314
01:36:53,628 --> 01:36:56,620
He is not my friend's son.
lt is not just that, DK.

1315
01:36:57,131 --> 01:37:00,965
Only my daughter knows how
close l was with my friend.

1316
01:37:01,135 --> 01:37:02,466
How did he come to know about it?

1317
01:37:02,637 --> 01:37:06,437
So she has guided him and has
sent him to me for passport.

1318
01:37:06,607 --> 01:37:09,098
He left for the Hyderabad on the
same day he took the passport.

1319
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:11,938
But Sravanthi left for
Hyderabad five days..

1320
01:37:12,113 --> 01:37:13,944
..before using a different name.

1321
01:37:14,115 --> 01:37:15,480
l have received a call now.

1322
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:23,153
Don't know why.. l am afraid to
tell this matter outside.

1323
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:28,485
l should know where my daughter is.
And how she is.- Sir.

1324
01:37:32,667 --> 01:37:34,328
What are you saying?

1325
01:37:34,502 --> 01:37:36,970
ls that award a drama played by him?

1326
01:37:37,805 --> 01:37:38,294
Yes, father.

1327
01:37:38,472 --> 01:37:40,463
Chanti told everything last night
under the influence of alcohol.

1328
01:37:40,641 --> 01:37:45,635
Me? l thought not to tell.
Did l tell? Just miss.

1329
01:37:46,347 --> 01:37:48,508
Father, look at those steps.

1330
01:37:53,187 --> 01:37:56,020
Poor guy. He is still under
the impression.

1331
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,024
His gait too has changed like NTR's from
the movie Kondaveeti Simham.

1332
01:38:00,194 --> 01:38:01,855
lt seems he will come to know
of it because of your fun.

1333
01:38:02,029 --> 01:38:04,020
Poor brother. Let us tell the
truth to brother, father.

1334
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:07,031
Think well. Brother is already
suffering from a weak heart.

1335
01:38:07,201 --> 01:38:10,659
No. No. Brother should never come
to know the truth.

1336
01:38:14,175 --> 01:38:19,545
Savitri, had you been alive then
you would have felt very happy.

1337
01:38:19,714 --> 01:38:22,376
The name of the award is..
Hey, what is the name of the award?

1338
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:24,017
Great lndustrialist..
Pundit of business..

1339
01:38:24,185 --> 01:38:28,383
Beloved entrepreneur..
Acute and leading pioneer..

1340
01:38:28,556 --> 01:38:31,218
l have received such a big award.
But you are not there.

1341
01:38:31,392 --> 01:38:33,223
Don't feel sad, brother.

1342
01:38:33,394 --> 01:38:35,385
Satellites are present in the sky.

1343
01:38:35,563 --> 01:38:37,724
Sister-in-law must know it before us.

1344
01:38:38,065 --> 01:38:39,225
Just miss.

1345
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:42,563
Revathi.- Brother.
- Last night l watched TV and l even read..

1346
01:38:42,737 --> 01:38:44,204
..today's newspapers.

1347
01:38:44,372 --> 01:38:46,033
My news is not found anywhere.

1348
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:52,202
This is not an ordinary award.
lt is a prestigious award.

1349
01:38:52,413 --> 01:38:54,210
They will check the TRP
ratings and announce it..

1350
01:38:54,415 --> 01:38:56,406
..either on Sankranthi or
Deepavali festival.

1351
01:38:56,584 --> 01:38:59,747
Correct.
- We can burn crackers
after watching it.

1352
01:39:00,087 --> 01:39:01,076
Just miss.

1353
01:39:01,255 --> 01:39:04,747
Uncle, father is not giving me 10,000
when l asked him.

1354
01:39:04,925 --> 01:39:06,916
l will tell him. Chinna.
- Brother.

1355
01:39:07,094 --> 01:39:08,925
Don't give him even ten paisa.

1356
01:39:09,096 --> 01:39:10,757
Are you happy?
- What is it uncle?

1357
01:39:10,931 --> 01:39:11,761
l have invited all my friends
for party...

1358
01:39:11,932 --> 01:39:13,422
...because you have won a great award.

1359
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:15,091
Now watch how insulting it will be.

1360
01:39:16,103 --> 01:39:17,570
Hey! Hey! Ramesh, is it award party?

1361
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:19,399
lf he doesn't give you
then l will give you.

1362
01:39:19,573 --> 01:39:21,564
Take it.
- Brother, it is..

1363
01:39:21,742 --> 01:39:23,607
Enjoy..
- Brother, think with your heart.

1364
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:25,742
Enjoy.. Hey.. Savitri..

1365
01:39:25,913 --> 01:39:27,073
Uncle.. - Who?

1366
01:39:27,248 --> 01:39:29,443
lndustrialist..
Pundit of business..

1367
01:39:29,617 --> 01:39:34,452
Beloved entrepreneur..
Acute and leading pioneer..

1368
01:39:34,622 --> 01:39:36,112
Hail! Pattapagalu Krishna Rao!

1369
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:38,622
Though he is a kid, how well he said.

1370
01:39:38,793 --> 01:39:42,957
Uncle, l told my friends
that l will give them pizza party.

1371
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:45,792
At least 5,000..
- You gave birth to a good boy.

1372
01:39:45,966 --> 01:39:50,926
Enjoy coke with pizza.
- Hail! Pattapagalu Krishna Rao!...

1373
01:39:51,105 --> 01:39:53,096
We can buy the award in real
with these expenses.

1374
01:39:53,774 --> 01:39:55,264
Then why did you give up.

1375
01:39:55,476 --> 01:39:57,637
Sister, l tried a lot to
memorize this award.

1376
01:39:57,778 --> 01:39:59,643
l am unable to even pronounce it.

1377
01:40:03,818 --> 01:40:08,653
How happily he is sleeping after
torturing such a good family.

1378
01:40:14,328 --> 01:40:15,659
Hey, friend! lt is me.

1379
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:17,661
Tell me.
-Results are out.

1380
01:40:17,832 --> 01:40:19,493
Our entire batch is out.

1381
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:21,658
None of them has passed
even in one subject.

1382
01:40:23,971 --> 01:40:26,303
Wow! What a good news, dear?

1383
01:40:26,507 --> 01:40:28,498
Am l college first?
- Ram!

1384
01:40:29,977 --> 01:40:33,310
And you?
- Hey, what first?

1385
01:40:33,514 --> 01:40:36,677
l should beat myself with
footwear for copying..

1386
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:38,682
..from your chits instead of my chits.

1387
01:40:38,853 --> 01:40:40,343
Party? No. No.

1388
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:42,682
lf needed then l will distribute
books to poor children..

1389
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:46,020
..but l will not spend money for such
useless parties. You know it.

1390
01:40:47,194 --> 01:40:50,857
Hey, Balu. l am telling something and
he is replying something else.

1391
01:40:51,031 --> 01:40:54,194
So there must be some girl
by his side.- Oh, l see.

1392
01:40:54,368 --> 01:40:56,700
Dear, poor people over here say
that they don't want books.

1393
01:40:56,871 --> 01:40:59,840
They want full. Should l order from
Amar wines in your name?

1394
01:41:00,007 --> 01:41:03,841
Hey! Hey! Why are you in a hurry?
l will come to college.

1395
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:05,342
Even if you say that you will come,
they will not allow you.

1396
01:41:05,546 --> 01:41:06,342
They have debarred you.

1397
01:41:06,547 --> 01:41:08,879
We will be allowed to enter the college
until we bring our father.

1398
01:41:09,049 --> 01:41:10,038
That is principal's order.

1399
01:41:12,887 --> 01:41:14,218
What happened, Ram?

1400
01:41:16,724 --> 01:41:18,885
What?
- Uncle is calling.

1401
01:41:19,059 --> 01:41:21,391
Why?- There is a phone call
from college.

1402
01:41:21,562 --> 01:41:22,051
So quickly?

1403
01:41:23,731 --> 01:41:26,222
ls everyone downstairs?
- Everyone is present.

1404
01:41:26,734 --> 01:41:28,395
How happy you look.

1405
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:32,205
Wow! What a beautiful moment?

1406
01:41:35,876 --> 01:41:37,571
Go. l am coming.
- Okay.

1407
01:41:38,746 --> 01:41:40,907
Sravanthi, you have to promise
me something.

1408
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:42,379
What?
- lt is nothing.

1409
01:41:42,583 --> 01:41:45,746
You shouldn't come downstairs in
the next one hour.- Why?

1410
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,909
Didn't my father send me to
Paris as punishment..

1411
01:41:47,087 --> 01:41:49,419
..because l would be getting
second rank?- Yes.

1412
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,080
Now he will feel bad after
knowing that l got first rank.

1413
01:41:51,258 --> 01:41:52,748
He will feel shy.

1414
01:41:52,927 --> 01:41:54,417
He will become emotional.
He will burst..

1415
01:41:54,595 --> 01:41:56,586
Sravanthi, it will be difficult
to control him.

1416
01:41:56,764 --> 01:41:59,426
lf you watch my father
like that, l may..

1417
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,400
Okay. Okay. l can understand.
You go. l will not come.

1418
01:42:04,738 --> 01:42:06,228
Hey, you shouldn't come.

1419
01:42:06,407 --> 01:42:09,899
l will not come. This is your moment.
Go ahead.

1420
01:42:15,783 --> 01:42:20,117
Uncle, he is coming.

1421
01:42:20,287 --> 01:42:22,448
Come, dear. Come.
Did you wake up?

1422
01:42:22,623 --> 01:42:25,456
You studied very well without passing
even in one subject.

1423
01:42:25,626 --> 01:42:27,617
How did l allow you to
enter the house?

1424
01:42:27,795 --> 01:42:29,956
Brother.. lndustrialist..
Pundit of business..

1425
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:33,293
Beloved entrepreneur..
Acute and leading pioneer..

1426
01:42:34,969 --> 01:42:37,267
l spare you because l agreed
in front of the media..

1427
01:42:37,438 --> 01:42:40,771
..but l will not go to the college
and beg principal for him.

1428
01:42:40,941 --> 01:42:43,273
Tell him that he doesn't have father.
- Mother!

1429
01:42:44,812 --> 01:42:47,440
Mother, l thought l didn't
have mother till now.

1430
01:42:47,648 --> 01:42:49,809
Now father is saying that he is not there
for me in spite of being alive.

1431
01:42:49,984 --> 01:42:53,476
What? Are you planning to hang my
photo on the wall?

1432
01:42:53,654 --> 01:42:54,814
l will not fall for your tricks.

1433
01:42:54,989 --> 01:42:56,650
lf you get up then only you will fall.

1434
01:42:56,991 --> 01:42:58,481
Just miss.

1435
01:42:58,659 --> 01:43:01,492
You may play any number of dramas
l will not come to college.

1436
01:43:01,662 --> 01:43:04,153
Uncle.. Mother.. Bye.
- Hey, wait.

1437
01:43:04,331 --> 01:43:06,492
lf Ram doesn't study then nobody
should study in this house.

1438
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:07,656
Go inside.

1439
01:43:08,502 --> 01:43:11,300
Okay. l am going. Don't do blackmail.

1440
01:43:28,188 --> 01:43:29,416
Yours.

1441
01:43:41,368 --> 01:43:42,699
Sir, l...

1442
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:45,494
ls this marks list?

1443
01:43:45,673 --> 01:43:48,164
984867..

1444
01:43:48,342 --> 01:43:50,708
lt looks like a mobile number.
Does it look like a marks list?

1445
01:43:52,012 --> 01:43:54,503
Sir, 72 percent in economics paper.
- You will get it.

1446
01:43:54,715 --> 01:43:55,875
lf you threaten the lecturer
saying that..

1447
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,516
..you will pour acid on his face
and write by..

1448
01:43:56,717 --> 01:43:57,706
..cheating then you will
definitely score it.

1449
01:43:57,885 --> 01:44:01,719
Oh! Father, it is not acid.
lt is water. Mineral water.

1450
01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:02,878
Sir is in third year.

1451
01:44:03,057 --> 01:44:04,718
18 subjects are remaining
to be cleared.

1452
01:44:04,892 --> 01:44:06,382
So sir didn't begin his
studies till now..

1453
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,391
..after entering the college.

1454
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:11,720
lf there are 4 boys like
your son then we have..

1455
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:13,890
..to shut our colleges and
start wedding halls.

1456
01:44:15,903 --> 01:44:16,733
l have understood, sir.

1457
01:44:16,904 --> 01:44:19,702
l was busy and lf you could
give a chance this time..

1458
01:44:19,873 --> 01:44:21,363
l didn't call you for giving chance.

1459
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:23,442
l have called you to give TC. Yes.

1460
01:44:23,744 --> 01:44:25,735
Give it! What have l got to do?
Give it!

1461
01:44:25,913 --> 01:44:26,743
Father..
- Give it right now.

1462
01:44:26,914 --> 01:44:28,541
Father.. Father..
- Why is he leaving by saying to give it?

1463
01:44:28,749 --> 01:44:30,546
Sir.. Sir..
- He is your father, isn't it?

1464
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:31,911
Please, sir. Please, sir.

1465
01:44:32,086 --> 01:44:34,919
Why are you talking as if a merit student
is being given TC? Get out!

1466
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:37,250
Take TC and get out.

1467
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:43,252
Hi, Pandu. -Hi, Nimmi. Tell me.

1468
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:47,423
ls your husband in town
or did he go to Mumbai?

1469
01:44:47,601 --> 01:44:48,761
Why are you not picking
up the phone?

1470
01:44:48,936 --> 01:44:52,235
Two idiots were sitting
in front of me till now.

1471
01:44:52,406 --> 01:44:54,567
Just now they left and
l received your call.

1472
01:44:54,775 --> 01:44:56,936
By the way, what did you
do about my new flat?

1473
01:44:57,945 --> 01:44:59,412
l have sold five medical seats without..

1474
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,241
..my correspondent's knowledge.

1475
01:45:01,415 --> 01:45:04,407
l have made one crore from it
and kept it in the dust bin.

1476
01:45:04,585 --> 01:45:06,280
ls it? So my flat is ready.

1477
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:11,289
Flat number 401 in My Home apartments
belongs to you from tomorrow.

1478
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:12,948
Thank you, Pandu.

1479
01:45:13,293 --> 01:45:15,625
Come to Green Park hotel
in the evening.

1480
01:45:15,796 --> 01:45:19,630
Both of us will sit there and
talk about interior decoration.

1481
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,961
Pandu! Flat for me.

1482
01:45:22,136 --> 01:45:23,933
Hey, there are waiting in
line over there.

1483
01:45:24,138 --> 01:45:26,436
l will come to you once they
are finished.- Hello, Pandu!

1484
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,602
Pandu! Hello, Pandu!

1485
01:45:30,611 --> 01:45:31,805
l will definitely give.

1486
01:45:43,991 --> 01:45:46,323
Hey, who allowed you inside?

1487
01:45:46,493 --> 01:45:48,654
You will get the TC from the office.
Take it and go.

1488
01:45:49,997 --> 01:45:52,329
Hey! Hey! What is this?

1489
01:45:52,499 --> 01:45:53,989
Pandu, my father is very hurt.

1490
01:45:54,168 --> 01:45:58,298
What is Pandu? Am l your friend?
Pandurangarao. Principal. Give respect.

1491
01:45:58,472 --> 01:46:01,839
Okay. What is the rate of
one flat in My Home apartments?

1492
01:46:04,011 --> 01:46:07,003
Why do you want the rate of
flat in My Home apartments?

1493
01:46:07,181 --> 01:46:08,170
l got my own home.

1494
01:46:08,315 --> 01:46:10,010
So is this our second home, Pandu.

1495
01:46:10,184 --> 01:46:12,015
Hey! What hey?

1496
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:15,678
Your activities are cheap.

1497
01:46:15,856 --> 01:46:16,845
But you have put
Gandhi's photo behind you.

1498
01:46:17,024 --> 01:46:20,016
One is at home.. One is at Green Park.
One is under the table.

1499
01:46:20,194 --> 01:46:21,354
Hey, who are you?
Go away.

1500
01:46:21,528 --> 01:46:22,358
ln order to cover these activities

1501
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:25,191
..you fool the correspondent and
hide money in dust bin.

1502
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:28,691
Give your hands, son.

1503
01:46:30,671 --> 01:46:31,831
What do you want?

1504
01:46:32,005 --> 01:46:35,338
l want to see happiness in
my father's face. Call him.

1505
01:46:35,676 --> 01:46:36,870
Why did you call me again?

1506
01:46:37,044 --> 01:46:39,035
Why, sir?
Your son is a wonderful boy.

1507
01:46:39,179 --> 01:46:40,339
What if he didn't score marks?

1508
01:46:40,514 --> 01:46:42,209
Behaviour..
Behaviour is important, sir.

1509
01:46:42,349 --> 01:46:44,214
Do you know how much
he respects his father?

1510
01:46:44,384 --> 01:46:45,681
What is the use of gold medals, sir?

1511
01:46:45,886 --> 01:46:47,581
They should be thrown into the dustbin.

1512
01:47:10,377 --> 01:47:13,073
Stop it. ls there admission or not?

1513
01:47:13,213 --> 01:47:17,240
Sir, l am taking this stress
to say that there is admission.

1514
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:20,250
What? -Sir, l want to see
happiness in your face.

1515
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,911
l will never feel happy in his matter.

1516
01:47:25,425 --> 01:47:27,916
Oh! My boy.

1517
01:47:32,099 --> 01:47:33,589
College topper!

1518
01:47:37,404 --> 01:47:39,065
No need to top the college.

1519
01:47:39,406 --> 01:47:41,067
First come to college.
That is sufficient.

1520
01:47:42,943 --> 01:47:45,104
Had there been a Cinderella
like you in this college..

1521
01:47:45,245 --> 01:47:46,576
..forget about myself coming
to college..

1522
01:47:46,747 --> 01:47:48,112
..l wouldn't have left it.

1523
01:47:56,957 --> 01:48:01,121
''Has the London's Cinderella
come in front of me?

1524
01:48:01,295 --> 01:48:05,129
''Has she pinched my heart?''
''ls it dream or real?''

1525
01:48:05,299 --> 01:48:07,130
''My eyes have felt the thunder.''

1526
01:48:07,301 --> 01:48:09,132
''My heart felt the tender touch.''

1527
01:48:09,303 --> 01:48:13,262
''Did she throw the love net
with that smile?''

1528
01:48:21,148 --> 01:48:28,987
''The waterfall inside my heart
has come to see you.''

1529
01:48:29,156 --> 01:48:32,990
''Your face is fixed in my eyes.

1530
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:36,823
''l have forgotten the world
by watching it.''

1531
01:48:38,999 --> 01:48:41,160
''But that is not you.''

1532
01:48:43,003 --> 01:48:45,301
''lt is a sweetie naughty hutch dog.''

1533
01:48:47,007 --> 01:48:49,475
''You are not the Cinderella.''

1534
01:48:50,811 --> 01:48:53,302
''lt is the simple looking slum dog.''

1535
01:48:58,518 --> 01:48:59,348
Move aside!

1536
01:50:05,886 --> 01:50:10,084
''You are that London's Cinderella.''

1537
01:50:10,257 --> 01:50:14,091
''Will you forgive me and
come out for dinner?''

1538
01:50:14,261 --> 01:50:15,922
''Oh, Surrender Subbaiah.''

1539
01:50:16,096 --> 01:50:22,092
''Will you tell in simple words
what the special dinner is?''

1540
01:50:22,269 --> 01:50:24,066
''Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!''

1541
01:50:24,237 --> 01:50:31,905
''Let us drink mint leaves soup
as starters for dinner.''

1542
01:50:32,112 --> 01:50:35,912
''Let us eat dumpling mixed with
curd before the main course.''

1543
01:50:36,116 --> 01:50:37,913
''lf we could sip the best of
milkshakes then..

1544
01:50:38,118 --> 01:50:39,949
..our hearts will feel very happy.''

1545
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:43,783
''Shall we finish it by
directly eating the deserts?

1546
01:50:43,957 --> 01:50:47,449
''No. No. Shall we have
milkshakes in between?''

1547
01:50:48,628 --> 01:50:55,796
''Let us eat fish,
lentils and vegetables.

1548
01:50:55,969 --> 01:51:03,603
''Let us both watch movie
with excitement.''

1549
01:51:03,777 --> 01:51:07,941
''This London Cinderella
appreciates your taste.''

1550
01:51:08,148 --> 01:51:11,948
''But where does she have
time for the date.''

1551
01:51:12,152 --> 01:51:16,145
''lf this wonder princess
likes it within two minutes..

1552
01:51:16,323 --> 01:51:19,486
..then she will love it.''
''Nothing more than that..''

1553
01:51:24,331 --> 01:51:25,992
''What is there with luck?''

1554
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:28,498
''l will do it, baby?''

1555
01:51:45,819 --> 01:51:46,683
Hey.. Soup.

1556
01:51:51,191 --> 01:51:52,021
My favourite.. Fish.

1557
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:57,360
Will you pay?

1558
01:52:02,702 --> 01:52:04,670
Hey, shall we go for movie?
- Movie?- Come on.

1559
01:52:31,565 --> 01:52:34,056
lt is mind-blowing, dear.
- lt is good.

1560
01:52:34,568 --> 01:52:36,729
Hey, will you drink milkshake?
- Yes.

1561
01:52:41,241 --> 01:52:43,402
Actually.. Hey, come. Come.

1562
01:52:46,046 --> 01:52:47,707
Actually it wasn't that bad.

1563
01:52:51,751 --> 01:52:52,581
Enough now.

1564
01:52:54,254 --> 01:52:55,585
Hey, you didn't eat well. Right?

1565
01:52:57,257 --> 01:52:58,087
For you.

1566
01:53:01,761 --> 01:53:03,092
And two minutes.

1567
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:04,919
l love you.

1568
01:53:08,602 --> 01:53:11,730
What? Did you plan to kill me?
- Brother..

1569
01:53:11,905 --> 01:53:14,066
Then why did you meet
Puranapool Ashok.

1570
01:53:14,274 --> 01:53:16,435
Why will l meet that rogue?

1571
01:53:16,576 --> 01:53:18,441
Do you know what this is?
Navigator.

1572
01:53:18,578 --> 01:53:19,909
l kept it inside your
scooter's dickey.

1573
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,446
This will tell which places you visited.

1574
01:53:23,283 --> 01:53:27,344
lt went to Puranapool Ashok's house
yesterday at 11 o'clock.

1575
01:53:29,456 --> 01:53:32,289
From there you both went
to Urvashi bar.

1576
01:53:32,459 --> 01:53:34,450
Everything is said by this babe.

1577
01:53:35,295 --> 01:53:38,458
Koka doesn't believe people.
He believes in technology.

1578
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:43,462
What? Will there be no bleeding
if you perform an operation.

1579
01:53:43,637 --> 01:53:45,434
Our operation too is similar.
Sit down.

1580
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:47,428
Sit down.

1581
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:51,941
You have treated the girl in
Gandhi hospital, isn't it?

1582
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:57,473
Can we treat the girl by keeping her
in some house or hotel?

1583
01:53:57,651 --> 01:54:00,313
No.. Not possible, sir.
Patient needs ventilator.

1584
01:54:00,487 --> 01:54:01,977
We should keep her on
life supporting system..

1585
01:54:02,155 --> 01:54:04,146
..and get MRl's done regularly.
- Stop it!

1586
01:54:04,324 --> 01:54:05,814
How many such cases are
there in the city?

1587
01:54:05,992 --> 01:54:08,825
There must be around 10 to 15.
- That's it?

1588
01:54:09,496 --> 01:54:10,986
Hey, is it difficult to catch?

1589
01:54:11,164 --> 01:54:12,995
Go and search all the hospitals
in the city.

1590
01:54:15,669 --> 01:54:17,796
What will you do now? Play.

1591
01:54:18,805 --> 01:54:22,332
l will take my bishop..
- l have understood..

1592
01:54:23,143 --> 01:54:25,338
Check. How is it?

1593
01:54:27,347 --> 01:54:28,678
Superb game.

1594
01:54:29,349 --> 01:54:30,839
You are very brilliant.

1595
01:54:30,984 --> 01:54:33,350
Hey, we should say that.

1596
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,010
lt is not sufficient if you
compliment yourself.

1597
01:54:35,188 --> 01:54:36,519
Okay. Okay. Go and bring coffee.

1598
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:38,021
Allowing you to enter the house
is a big thing.

1599
01:54:38,191 --> 01:54:40,523
ln addition do you need coffee?
Go... and bring yourself.

1600
01:54:40,694 --> 01:54:43,857
Ram, l think you command lot of
respect in this house.

1601
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:45,019
You are mistaken.

1602
01:54:46,199 --> 01:54:49,191
l never feel angry when this sister
says anything.- Why?

1603
01:54:49,369 --> 01:54:52,338
When we went to Annavaram
in my childhood..

1604
01:54:52,505 --> 01:54:56,373
..we saw an infant girl crying on
the temple's staircase.

1605
01:54:56,543 --> 01:55:01,003
l saw her and cried saying that
l want that girl to be my sister.

1606
01:55:01,848 --> 01:55:05,375
And then my uncle brought
that girl and..

1607
01:55:05,552 --> 01:55:06,883
...he is bringing her up
like his daughter.

1608
01:55:07,554 --> 01:55:10,887
That girl is this girl.
- Does she know it?

1609
01:55:11,057 --> 01:55:13,048
How, Sravanthi?
How can we tell these matters to her?

1610
01:55:13,226 --> 01:55:15,387
Ram, you are so great.

1611
01:55:15,895 --> 01:55:18,728
Have you seen her?
Today she is going without caring for me.

1612
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:23,562
Okay. Let it be.
- Your house is superb.

1613
01:55:23,903 --> 01:55:25,200
Let us go to my room. Come.

1614
01:55:25,872 --> 01:55:29,535
Friends of my orphan sister.
Today is Sunday. lt is nonsense.

1615
01:55:29,709 --> 01:55:31,199
lt looks really nice.

1616
01:55:31,411 --> 01:55:33,402
Okay. What is it with you?

1617
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:35,207
Why didn't you turn and
look there?

1618
01:55:36,049 --> 01:55:38,210
l will see. They will turn and see me.

1619
01:55:38,418 --> 01:55:39,578
They will fall for me after
watching my cute face.

1620
01:55:39,753 --> 01:55:42,415
After that SMS', MMS',
love letters and suicide threats..

1621
01:55:42,589 --> 01:55:45,752
Do we need all this?
This is experience, dear. Experience.

1622
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:48,257
ls it?
Did so many girls propose you?

1623
01:55:48,428 --> 01:55:50,089
Then?
- Hey!

1624
01:55:51,264 --> 01:55:52,424
Okay. Okay. Sorry.

1625
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:55,591
Who proposed you for the first time?
Please. Please. Tell me.

1626
01:55:55,769 --> 01:55:57,600
First..

1627
01:55:58,738 --> 01:55:59,397
Sarita.

1628
01:56:02,242 --> 01:56:04,437
Hey, why did you give it to me?
l am your teacher.

1629
01:56:04,611 --> 01:56:07,079
lt is okay, teacher. Please, teacher.

1630
01:56:09,616 --> 01:56:11,243
Too much romance.

1631
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:12,440
Second?

1632
01:56:12,619 --> 01:56:14,610
Second?

1633
01:56:14,788 --> 01:56:17,279
Malavika! Malavika!

1634
01:56:17,457 --> 01:56:20,187
Malavika!...

1635
01:56:24,297 --> 01:56:25,286
Are you going out of town?

1636
01:56:25,465 --> 01:56:28,127
Yes. l am going to my grandma's house
for summer holidays.

1637
01:56:28,301 --> 01:56:29,632
l will come back after a week.

1638
01:56:29,803 --> 01:56:31,134
l cannot wait for so many days.

1639
01:56:31,271 --> 01:56:32,761
Sorry. -lt is okay.

1640
01:56:32,939 --> 01:56:35,772
Will you go after introducing
your friend Usha till then?

1641
01:56:39,646 --> 01:56:41,637
There is too much violence.
- Violence?

1642
01:56:41,815 --> 01:56:43,282
Have you seen it? You too got scared.

1643
01:56:43,483 --> 01:56:44,108
Brother.

1644
01:56:46,986 --> 01:56:49,318
Hey, brother. My friends have come.

1645
01:56:50,657 --> 01:56:52,488
They don't know anything about you.

1646
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,991
New batch.

1647
01:56:55,161 --> 01:56:57,652
All my old friends have left me
because of you.

1648
01:56:57,831 --> 01:57:00,322
Sukanya friends are not coming
to this colony at all.

1649
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,831
Please don't come to my room today.

1650
01:57:02,001 --> 01:57:03,832
Please, brother. lf you want then
l will hold your feet.

1651
01:57:04,003 --> 01:57:06,130
Get up. Get up!

1652

You shouldn't come.
- l have heard. Go.

01:57:16,149 --> 01:57:18,674
Ram. Call her.

1655
01:57:18,852 --> 01:57:20,342
Why?
- Call her.

1656
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:24,353
Ramya. -Louder.
- Ramya!

1657
01:57:25,358 --> 01:57:26,256

1658
01:57:29,028 --> 01:57:30,017
Come.

1659
01:57:30,864 --> 01:57:31,694

1660
01:57:31,865 --> 01:57:34,356
Tell her what you did to her friends
and Sukanya's friends.

1661
01:57:34,534 --> 01:57:36,024
Tell me.

1662
01:57:36,202 --> 01:57:37,999
What did l do to your friends
and Sukanya's friends?

1663
01:57:38,171 --> 01:57:40,002
What? -Louder.

1664
01:57:40,173 --> 01:57:42,664
What did l do to your friends
and Sukanya's friends..

1665
01:57:47,714 --> 01:57:48,874
Are you asking me?

1666
01:57:50,717 --> 01:57:51,706
Sukanya.

1667
01:57:53,887 --> 01:57:57,880
He is asking what he did to our friends.
- What he did?

1668
01:57:58,057 --> 01:58:00,048
Hey, don't you know what you did?

1669
01:58:09,903 --> 01:58:12,872
Oh! Silence! Are you still
listening to his stories, dear?

1670
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:15,030
No, father. Before he went aboard..

1671
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:16,573
..he told me to introduce
him to uncle Seth's daughter.

1672
01:58:16,743 --> 01:58:18,040
Hey, stop! What is the need
for that topic now?

1673
01:58:18,211 --> 01:58:20,042
Hey, you wait.
l didn't introduce her.

1674
01:58:20,213 --> 01:58:21,737
He then went to that girl
and told her that l am..

1675
01:58:21,915 --> 01:58:26,909
..an orphan and was found
at Annavaram temple.

1676
01:58:28,922 --> 01:58:31,914
Hey, when your aunt was suffering
in giving birth to her..

1677
01:58:32,091 --> 01:58:33,922
..l went to the bank and
took a loan of two..

1678
01:58:34,093 --> 01:58:36,425
..lakhs and got the caesarean
surgery done.- Yes.

1679
01:58:36,596 --> 01:58:39,087
No, uncle. Seth's daughter didn't
understand the Hindi l spoke.

1680
01:58:39,265 --> 01:58:42,257
Hey! Hey! Hey! Shut up!
Don't l know you?

1681
01:58:51,411 --> 01:58:53,242
Hey, what is this meeting?

1682
01:58:53,413 --> 01:58:57,247
Why are you torturing a good boy?
Go. Go from here. Go.

1683
01:58:58,251 --> 01:58:59,411
Everything is revealed.

1684
01:58:59,619 --> 01:59:01,780
So who will believe when
you call me good boy?

1685
01:59:07,293 --> 01:59:08,282
Sravanthi..

1686
01:59:16,469 --> 01:59:20,098
Ram! l am going to hospital.
Will you too come?

1687
01:59:27,113 --> 01:59:28,273
Hello. Tell me, doctor.

1688
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:34,809
What happened, aunt?

1689
01:59:42,495 --> 01:59:44,156
Hey! Hey! Who are you?

1690
01:59:59,846 --> 02:00:00,835
Sravanthi!

1691
02:00:37,884 --> 02:00:38,714
Ram..

1692
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,212
We should give second injection
in another five hours.

1693
02:00:57,904 --> 02:00:58,871
Hey, Bobby!
- Ram!

1694
02:00:59,038 --> 02:01:01,029
l need your help urgently.
- What?

1695
02:01:01,207 --> 02:01:02,731
Turn on the camera that is put
in front of our hospital.

1696
02:01:03,743 --> 02:01:04,903
Freeze it! Freeze it!

1697
02:01:05,745 --> 02:01:09,078
Now follow this ambulance and see
at which signals it stops.

1698
02:01:29,102 --> 02:01:32,230
lt didn't cross any signal
after SR Nagar.

1699
02:01:32,405 --> 02:01:35,397
So it should be in SR Nagar.

1700
02:01:36,242 --> 02:01:37,072
Thanks, friend.

1701
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,775
We will finish the entire family.

1702
02:01:42,949 --> 02:01:44,416
Yes, boss.

1703
02:01:44,584 --> 02:01:46,279
Where is the girl's body?

1704
02:01:46,419 --> 02:01:47,943
first if we talk about payment..

1705
02:01:48,121 --> 02:01:50,954
What? Didn't l pay you already?

1706
02:01:51,124 --> 02:01:54,787
You said your life will be in danger
if the girl is missed.

1707
02:01:54,961 --> 02:01:56,792
ls your life's value mere 25 lakhs?

1708
02:01:58,965 --> 02:02:01,627
How much you want?
Two crores.
- Okay.

1709
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:07,266
Since you have agreed so easily
it means the matter is quite serious.

1710
02:02:08,107 --> 02:02:09,802
25 crores.

1711
02:02:10,109 --> 02:02:15,445
Hey, you are acting smart.
Girl is already dead.

1712
02:02:15,615 --> 02:02:17,446
You cannot do anything.

1713
02:02:18,317 --> 02:02:22,151
Sir, if you are DK, l am KD.

1714
02:02:22,989 --> 02:02:25,480
l didn't kill the girl.
l kept her safe.

1715
02:02:50,183 --> 02:02:52,014
Are you mad? l will..

1716
02:02:54,854 --> 02:02:56,185
Where did you go? What happened?

1717
02:02:56,355 --> 02:02:58,016
l felt someone was taking me away.
Therefore l came.

1718
02:02:58,191 --> 02:03:00,352
Body is here. Rowdies are present here.

1719
02:03:03,863 --> 02:03:06,354
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1720
02:03:07,033 --> 02:03:08,022
Why are you looking there?

1721
02:03:11,204 --> 02:03:13,832
Sir, why do you think so much?

1722
02:03:14,006 --> 02:03:15,667
You don't have other option too.

1723
02:03:23,349 --> 02:03:26,682
Sir, we don't need that much money.
We are ten people.

1724
02:03:26,886 --> 02:03:27,875
Give us ten crores.
That is sufficient.

1725
02:03:28,054 --> 02:03:30,887
We know where the girl is.
We will kill her.

1726
02:03:31,057 --> 02:03:34,220
l will give.
First kill the girl.

1727
02:03:52,378 --> 02:03:53,902
Sir, two minutes.
Two minutes.

1728
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:39,121
Hey! What happened to you?
Why doesn't anyone lift the phone?

1729
02:04:39,292 --> 02:04:41,783
Brother, some guy came here
and he is beating us.

1730
02:04:43,462 --> 02:04:47,455
Hey, first remove her oxygen mask.
Don't spare hi too.

02:06:20,559 --> 02:06:22,720
No. Everything is not fine.

1733
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:28,564
What happened to her, aunt?
- Not about her. lt is about you.

1734
02:06:28,734 --> 02:06:30,725
l don't agree with anything you do.

1735
02:06:30,903 --> 02:06:33,770
Why were you running like a
mad person sometime back?

1736
02:06:34,206 --> 02:06:37,073
l got scared thinking what
would happen to you.

1737
02:06:37,243 --> 02:06:38,369
Will you die for her?

1738
02:06:39,078 --> 02:06:42,707
Tell me. Tell me. Will you die for her?
- Aunt, she is listening.

1739
02:06:42,882 --> 02:06:45,407
Let her listen. She too must
understand my grief.

1740
02:06:46,585 --> 02:06:49,247
Where is that girl?
Where is she?

1741
02:06:49,588 --> 02:06:52,751
Sravanthi..
- Dear, l beg you.

1742
02:06:52,925 --> 02:06:55,917
Spare my son.
l want my son.

1743
02:06:56,095 --> 02:06:59,428
l will give you life even by
giving up my life.

1744
02:06:59,598 --> 02:07:01,930
But please don't play with him.

1745
02:07:02,101 --> 02:07:03,432
Please, aunt! Please!

1746
02:07:47,146 --> 02:07:49,478
Nothing will happen to her.
She will survive.

1747
02:07:49,782 --> 02:07:52,148
Hey, it is not good to stay
here for long time.

1748
02:07:52,318 --> 02:07:54,309
We should change the place urgently.

1749
02:07:54,487 --> 02:07:58,480
Not just place. We should change
the vehicle too. Come.

1750
02:08:09,168 --> 02:08:12,137
Aunt. -Bring her and come
to our warehouse.

1751
02:08:12,304 --> 02:08:13,293
Okay, aunt.

1752
02:08:14,473 --> 02:08:17,465

ldiots! He thrashed all of you
and took her away.

1754
02:08:23,349 --> 02:08:24,680
Where are you taking me to?

1755
02:08:25,985 --> 02:08:27,509
Sir, you don't take tension.

1756
02:08:27,686 --> 02:08:29,847
Koko has put a navigator in the
girl's stretcher.

1757
02:08:30,022 --> 02:08:32,684
Let him take the girl anywhere,
they will not escape from us.

1758
02:08:32,858 --> 02:08:34,348
Here is the navigator machine, sir.

1759
02:08:40,199 --> 02:08:41,860
Yes! Go!

1760
02:08:42,034 --> 02:08:43,023
Come, sir.

1761
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:56,371
Card problem. Come here once.

1762
02:09:35,087 --> 02:09:37,988
'Dear, l beg you.
Spare my child.

1763
02:09:39,592 --> 02:09:41,082
'l want my son.'

1764
02:10:28,607 --> 02:10:29,938
Bring the vehicle.

1765
02:10:49,828 --> 02:10:52,319
Hey! That is navigator.
They are following us.

1766
02:10:52,498 --> 02:10:53,487
First throw it away.

1767
02:11:12,851 --> 02:11:15,684
Why? Why doesn't this
society understand us?

1768
02:11:15,854 --> 02:11:18,015
Because you have got a wife
and l have got a husband.

1769
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:22,023
What did they do to us?

1770
02:11:22,194 --> 02:11:25,186
Ramani, our good time has begun.

1771
02:11:34,006 --> 02:11:36,998
Hey, Pandu.
l think they might rape me.

1772
02:11:38,844 --> 02:11:41,369
Hello. Are you expecting it?

1773
02:11:41,547 --> 02:11:42,707
No! No!
- l will thrash you!

1774
02:11:43,382 --> 02:11:45,873
Who is she?- Your wife?
- Yes. Wife.

1775
02:11:46,018 --> 02:11:50,216
l mean some other person's wife.
My life.

1776
02:11:50,389 --> 02:11:52,380
Oh! Affair?

1777
02:11:52,558 --> 02:11:54,890
Sir, you guessed it correctly.

1778
02:11:55,060 --> 02:11:58,052
Physics lecturer.- What is the need
for my physique now, Pandu?

1779
02:11:58,230 --> 02:11:59,390
Where is the body?

1780
02:11:59,565 --> 02:12:01,055
What body, sir? This is my body.
- Not your body. Girl's body.

1781
02:12:01,233 --> 02:12:04,396
This is the girl's body, sir.
- Not this girl's body.

1782
02:12:04,570 --> 02:12:06,367
That girl's body.
- Which girl's body, sir?

1783
02:12:07,706 --> 02:12:08,536
Why do you beat me, sir?

1784
02:12:08,707 --> 02:12:11,403
Not just beating.
l will shoot you. -Why, sir?

1785
02:12:11,577 --> 02:12:13,044
Where did you keep the girl's body?

1786
02:12:13,212 --> 02:12:15,043
l don't know the girl, sir.

1787
02:12:15,214 --> 02:12:16,408
Then what is this.

1788
02:12:16,749 --> 02:12:18,410
What is it, sir?
lt looks different.

1789
02:12:18,584 --> 02:12:20,051
lf you don't know the body
then how come..

1790
02:12:20,219 --> 02:12:23,245
..this navigator is found
in your car's backseat?

1791
02:12:23,422 --> 02:12:25,083
How can l tell you if you
ask like that?

1792
02:12:25,257 --> 02:12:27,589
For example. She is someone's wife.

1793
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,251
She is in my car. lf you ask
why then what will l say?

1794
02:12:30,429 --> 02:12:32,260
Sir, there are no answers for
certain things.

1795
02:12:32,431 --> 02:12:35,764
Sir, l will consider her as
my sister from today.

1796
02:12:35,934 --> 02:12:37,765
Yuck! Useless fellow! Go.

1797
02:12:39,071 --> 02:12:41,733
What did l say, sir?
Why is she calling me useless fellow?

1798
02:12:42,241 --> 02:12:44,732
Yuck! Go.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1799
02:13:18,777 --> 02:13:20,108
Are you doing everything
as per your wish..

1800
02:13:20,279 --> 02:13:22,474
..by thinking that nobody
is coming here?

1801
02:13:22,815 --> 02:13:25,113
Why are the doors of
warehouse open?

1802
02:13:25,284 --> 02:13:27,980
Father?
- Hey, you. Who has opened it?

1803
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:30,145
Sir, your son took the
keys from me saying..

1804
02:13:30,322 --> 02:13:31,880
..that nobody should come
here for two days.

1805
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:40,320
Father.

1806
02:13:50,676 --> 02:13:51,802
What is the mistake that
you committed..

1807
02:13:51,977 --> 02:13:52,966
..due to which you came
here to hide?

1808
02:13:55,981 --> 02:13:58,211
What trouble did you invite to me?

1809
02:14:01,687 --> 02:14:03,848
Father!
- Brother!

1810
02:14:04,022 --> 02:14:06,183
Brother!
- Brother!

1811
02:14:06,358 --> 02:14:08,519
Father!
- Brother! - Father!

1812
02:14:09,528 --> 02:14:11,689
Father!
- Why did you do like this?

1813
02:14:11,864 --> 02:14:13,525
Brother, let us take him to hospital.
- Father!

1814
02:14:13,699 --> 02:14:16,361
How? There is no hospital
till 20 kilometres.

1815
02:14:16,869 --> 02:14:19,337
Revathi. -Father! Father!

1816
02:14:19,838 --> 02:14:21,999
lt is okay. Let us take
him to the hospital.

1817
02:14:22,174 --> 02:14:25,541
There is no time.
First make uncle lie down on the ground.

1818
02:14:27,546 --> 02:14:28,240
Do it!

1819
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:32,539
Touch below the chest.

1820
02:14:33,719 --> 02:14:34,708
Does it look swollen?

1821
02:14:35,721 --> 02:14:38,053
Yes.
- Tell them to bring a sharp..

1822
02:14:38,223 --> 02:14:39,713
..knife and something like spirit.

1823
02:14:39,892 --> 02:14:41,382
Uncle, there is a
first aid kit in father's car.

1824
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,391
Bring the knife from it and
vodka bottle from the dickey.

1825
02:14:43,562 --> 02:14:44,392
What is the need for them now?
- Bring them, uncle!

1826
02:14:44,563 --> 02:14:46,554
Are you coming? -Hey! Hey!

1827
02:14:47,399 --> 02:14:50,562
Why are you doing all this now?
Revathi is coming.

1828
02:14:50,736 --> 02:14:52,533
There is no time, uncle.
- What are you talking?

1829
02:14:52,704 --> 02:14:54,535
This is tension pneumothorax
- This is tension pneumothorax

1830
02:14:54,706 --> 02:14:56,367
Air from his lungs is escaping
into his chest.

1831
02:14:56,575 --> 02:14:58,566
Air from his lungs is escaping
into his chest.

1832
02:14:58,877 --> 02:14:59,866
Open the shirt.

1833
02:15:00,379 --> 02:15:01,903
When we inhale when we
are in tension..

1834
02:15:02,047 --> 02:15:03,742
..and if lungs walls don't open up..

1835
02:15:03,916 --> 02:15:04,905
..properly then air gets locked.

1836
02:15:05,083 --> 02:15:06,914
So the air has to be
released immediately.

1837
02:15:07,219 --> 02:15:09,084
Fast! -Take it.

1838
02:15:09,755 --> 02:15:11,416
First pour vodka in that
place and clean it.

1839
02:15:13,091 --> 02:15:15,082
Now stab in that area.

1840
02:15:16,428 --> 02:15:18,089
Please believe me.

1841
02:15:18,430 --> 02:15:21,422
We are just making a small hole
to release that air.

1842
02:15:33,912 --> 02:15:35,072
Open the cap of that bottle.

1843
02:15:36,248 --> 02:15:37,237
Keep it on that.

1844
02:15:38,417 --> 02:15:39,247
Press it.

1845
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:54,962
Brother! What happened, brother?

1846
02:15:55,133 --> 02:15:57,294
Revathi, like a big doctor.

1847
02:15:57,469 --> 02:15:59,266
He said bring the knife..
Tension pneumothorax

1848
02:15:59,438 --> 02:16:02,635
He did something and saved brother.

1849
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:16,981
Though aunt doesn't like me,

1850
02:16:17,155 --> 02:16:19,988
l couldn't tolerate your pain
and therefore came in front of you.

1851
02:16:20,826 --> 02:16:22,157
l am sorry.

1852
02:17:07,673 --> 02:17:11,006
''Oh, fly away my heart.

1853
02:17:11,176 --> 02:17:14,703
''Go to any distance.''

1854
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:18,714
''Will l not find you and come to you?''''

1855
02:17:18,884 --> 02:17:22,877
l am living in my heart.''

1856
02:17:23,055 --> 02:17:26,047
Whether it is a dream..

1857
02:17:26,224 --> 02:17:29,887
''Or if l am wide awake..

1858
02:17:30,228 --> 02:17:33,720
''Will l be able to live without you?''

1859
02:17:33,899 --> 02:17:37,733
''l am alive because of you.''

1860
02:18:08,767 --> 02:18:11,759
''lt is because of love.''

1861
02:18:11,937 --> 02:18:15,566
''l will stay wherever you are.''

1862
02:18:15,774 --> 02:18:23,408
''l will come with you as you wish
by becoming a shadow.''

1863
02:18:23,582 --> 02:18:30,784
''l will live for thousand years in
the fort of your love.''

1864
02:18:30,956 --> 02:18:33,948
''Oh, l am the moving wind.''

1865
02:18:34,126 --> 02:18:38,460
''You are the waves inside me.''

1866
02:18:38,630 --> 02:18:40,791
''We cannot move without
staying together.''

1867
02:18:40,966 --> 02:18:42,627
''Oh, l am the lightening thunder.''

1868
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:46,259
''You are the spark inside me.''
''We will stay together.''

1869
02:18:54,279 --> 02:18:57,612
''Oh, fly away my heart.''

1870
02:18:57,816 --> 02:19:01,445
''Go to any distance.''

1871
02:19:01,653 --> 02:19:04,486
''Will l not find you and
come to you?''

1872
02:19:05,323 --> 02:19:09,487
''l am living in my heart.''

1873
02:19:44,029 --> 02:19:51,026
''Love is the oasis in sun.''

1874
02:19:51,203 --> 02:19:55,867
''However one may drink,
the thirst of love..

1875
02:19:56,007 --> 02:19:58,339
..cannot be quenched.''

1876
02:19:58,510 --> 02:20:01,673
''However one may fill
their hearts with love..

1877
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:06,044
..it cannot be filled completely.''

1878
02:20:06,218 --> 02:20:13,715
Love has blossomed between us
long back.

1879
02:20:13,892 --> 02:20:22,391
''Love has disturbed our sleep
and brought us together.''

1880
02:20:43,755 --> 02:20:46,747
'Sir, Madhav went to lndian saying
his mother is unwell.

1881
02:20:46,925 --> 02:20:47,914
'He will return within a week.'

1882
02:20:48,093 --> 02:20:51,426
'Sir, l will change this number
for security reasons.'

1883
02:20:51,596 --> 02:20:53,086
'Has he done all this?'

1884
02:20:58,603 --> 02:20:59,570
Sir, this is the doctor's house.

1885
02:20:59,738 --> 02:21:00,898
Do you want me to go and
drag her out?

1886
02:21:01,072 --> 02:21:03,632
We don't want doctor.
We want patient.

1887
02:21:03,942 --> 02:21:06,240
She might not be here.
We will wait.

1888
02:21:14,286 --> 02:21:16,618
The last vaccine will
be given today.

1889
02:21:16,788 --> 02:21:18,278
lt is coming from morning's flight.

1890
02:21:18,456 --> 02:21:20,447
You go to the courier office
and bring..

1891
02:21:20,625 --> 02:21:22,616
..it so that there is no delay.

1892
02:21:23,295 --> 02:21:26,128
Hey, who is Sravanthi?

1893
02:21:29,301 --> 02:21:32,600
Sravanthi? Who is it, brother
- He should know.

1894
02:21:32,938 --> 02:21:34,599
Tell me. Who is Sravanthi?

1895
02:21:37,108 --> 02:21:38,769
Sravanthi.. Who is it, father?

1896
02:21:38,977 --> 02:21:41,775
So did you call her name all
night without knowing her?

1897
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:43,971
Did l take her name?
- Yes.

1898
02:21:44,149 --> 02:21:47,141
l came to your room last night
after seeing the lights on.

1899
02:21:47,319 --> 02:21:48,149
You were moving around in sleep and..

1900
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,312
..calling out Sravanthi.. Sravanthi

1901
02:21:51,489 --> 02:21:52,820
Who is that girl, son?

1902
02:21:54,326 --> 02:21:56,317
She is my friend, father.
There is a small problem.

1903
02:21:56,494 --> 02:22:00,487
That's why.. l might have
called her name..

1904
02:22:02,667 --> 02:22:06,467
ls it a problem not to be
disclosed to me? Love?

1905
02:22:06,972 --> 02:22:08,803
Did her family come to know of it?

1906
02:22:09,007 --> 02:22:11,475
ls her father creating any problem?

1907
02:22:11,643 --> 02:22:14,168
Tell me. l will meet and talk.

1908
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:17,642
My son is gold.
l will say that my son is gold.

1909
02:22:18,183 --> 02:22:19,343
Thanks, father.

1910
02:22:36,034 --> 02:22:37,023
Left! Left!

1911
02:22:50,849 --> 02:22:52,214
Come, guys!

1912
02:22:52,851 --> 02:22:54,375
Hey, you go this side.

1913
02:22:58,556 --> 02:23:00,217
Boss! lt is bit urgent.
Give it fast.

1914
02:23:00,392 --> 02:23:02,553
lt is not possible if you say urgent.
Wait for half an hour.

1915
02:23:02,727 --> 02:23:04,058
There is an important medicine
in that courier.

1916
02:23:04,229 --> 02:23:05,719
Why do you talk without
knowing its urgency?

1917
02:23:06,064 --> 02:23:08,396
Look, the life of a girl
depends on it.

1918
02:23:09,234 --> 02:23:10,895
lf you don't give it on time
then she will die.

1919
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:13,367
Please, boss.
Try to understand.

1920
02:23:13,538 --> 02:23:14,197
One minute, sir.

1921
02:23:14,539 --> 02:23:16,700
Sir, he is in the
courier office upstairs.

1922
02:25:30,842 --> 02:25:32,833
Ram! What happened?

1923
02:25:50,395 --> 02:25:52,886
Hey! Leave it!

1924
02:25:57,068 --> 02:25:57,898
Go.

1925
02:26:08,413 --> 02:26:08,879
What is it?
- Aunt, take it.

1926
02:26:09,047 --> 02:26:10,878
Why are you coming running?
- First give the injection.

1927
02:26:19,424 --> 02:26:20,584
Where is Ram?

1928
02:26:51,289 --> 02:26:52,449
Hey! Ram!
- Aunt, wait!

1929
02:26:52,624 --> 02:26:54,285
Hey! Who are you?

1930
02:28:27,185 --> 02:28:28,174
No! No!

1931
02:28:45,737 --> 02:28:47,102
You rogue!

1932
02:28:48,873 --> 02:28:49,862
Arrest him!

1933
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:08,081
First my daughter needs to be shifted
to the hospital urgently.

1934
02:29:08,259 --> 02:29:09,089
Put this rogue in jail.
- Sir, don't act in haste.

1935
02:29:09,427 --> 02:29:14,592
lt is because of him that
your daughter is still alive.

1936
02:29:14,766 --> 02:29:17,098
Mr. Commissioner. l called you up
thinking that the situation..

1937
02:29:17,268 --> 02:29:18,599
..here is going out of control.

1938
02:29:18,770 --> 02:29:21,238
No! He and DK have planned
it together.

1939
02:29:21,406 --> 02:29:24,239
Sir, you will not believe even
if we tell what has happened.

1940
02:29:24,442 --> 02:29:27,240
Not only you but nobody in this
world will believe it.

1941
02:29:27,445 --> 02:29:29,072
You daughter should tell
the truth.

1942
02:29:53,604 --> 02:29:55,936
lt is me, dear. Father.

1943
02:30:33,978 --> 02:30:35,809
Who are they, father?

1944
02:30:40,518 --> 02:30:41,678
Arrest him.

1945
02:30:46,524 --> 02:30:52,019
''Oh heart, don't break down.
Don't become furious.''

1946
02:30:52,196 --> 02:30:57,862
''Don't change even if love turns
out to be dangerous.''

1947
02:30:58,035 --> 02:31:03,166
''Oh, love is the reason for likes
and troubles.''

1948
02:31:03,341 --> 02:31:08,711
''Love will not give the reason for
anything anytime.''

1949
02:31:08,846 --> 02:31:14,341
''lt is written already.''

1950
02:31:14,552 --> 02:31:19,216
''lt is taking place as destiny.''

1951
02:31:19,390 --> 02:31:25,886
''Though memories pierce the heart,
tolerate them as love.''

1952
02:31:26,063 --> 02:31:31,558
''You cannot avoid this ordeal.''

1953
02:31:31,736 --> 02:31:34,364
''Will love draw us apart?''

1954
02:31:34,539 --> 02:31:43,379
''Let the memories continue with
the cycle of births.''

1955
02:31:54,425 --> 02:31:59,761
''Oh heart, don't break down.
Don't become furious.''

1956
02:31:59,931 --> 02:32:05,927
''Don't change even if love turns out
to be dangerous.''

1957
02:32:11,909 --> 02:32:15,401
Sir, that boy and his aunt have taken
lot of risk for your daughter.

1958
02:32:15,613 --> 02:32:16,602
lt is true.

1959
02:32:16,781 --> 02:32:18,772
Excuse me. Dr. Revathi..
- Yes.

1960
02:32:18,950 --> 02:32:20,417
She is in operation theatre. You?

1961
02:32:21,118 --> 02:32:22,608
l am Chakradhar from Paris.

1962
02:32:22,787 --> 02:32:25,779
lt will take one hour for the doctor
to come out. Please wait.

1963
02:32:27,458 --> 02:32:29,790
l am going to Paris.

1964
02:32:29,961 --> 02:32:32,122
Tell her that l will call later.
- Okay sir.

1965
02:32:39,136 --> 02:32:42,594
Sorry, son. l didn't believe it
when your aunt said it.

1966
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:44,339
But now l have understood the truth.

1967
02:32:45,443 --> 02:32:46,637
Thanks a lot, son.

1968
02:32:54,151 --> 02:32:57,643
What? Did Sravanthi's father come?
Why?

1969
02:32:59,323 --> 02:33:01,484
Aunt, he said thanks.
- Thanks?

1970
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:05,151
What does he think?

1971
02:33:05,329 --> 02:33:07,661
Did we take this risk for thanks?

1972
02:33:07,832 --> 02:33:09,993
Why doesn't he tell the truth
he knows to Sravanthi?

1973
02:33:10,167 --> 02:33:11,327
l will go and ask.

1974
02:33:13,804 --> 02:33:14,634
No, aunt.

1975
02:33:15,306 --> 02:33:18,139
When she said that
she doesn't know me..

1976
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:20,470
..then l don't have the strength
to even go in front of her.

1977
02:33:21,979 --> 02:33:23,469
What if she is not there in my life?

1978
02:33:23,681 --> 02:33:24,841
She is alive, isn't it?

1979
02:33:27,485 --> 02:33:30,181
That's enough, aunt.
My love has won.

1980
02:33:37,695 --> 02:33:39,856
Farther, l am very sorry.

1981
02:33:40,531 --> 02:33:43,193
l gave you lot of trouble
asking for freedom.

1982
02:33:44,201 --> 02:33:46,192
l will never say no to you any time.

1983
02:33:52,877 --> 02:33:55,175
What happened?
- Tyre is punctured, sir.

1984
02:34:48,933 --> 02:34:51,766
'lf that dreams comes true
then l will love only him..

1985
02:34:51,936 --> 02:34:54,404
...irrespective of his looks
and the place he lives.'

1986
02:34:54,572 --> 02:34:56,062
'l will marry only him.'

1987
02:34:57,000 --> 02:37:44,000
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
