<i># Why quarrel? #</i>

14
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,831
<i># Why fight? #</i>

15
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,525
<i># Why wars? #</i>

16
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,204
<i># Why shed blood? #</i>

17
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,838
<i># Why quarrel? #</i>

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,473
<i># Why fight? #</i>

19
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,937
<i># Why wars? #</i>

20
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,701
<i># Why shed blood? #</i>

21
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:31,248
<i># Love is like the sweet honey. #</i>

<i># ...and you also fall in love. #</i>

28
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,467
This village is green & beautiful, right?

29
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,040
I was born in this peaceful
and beautiful village.

30
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,212
My name is...

31
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,245
Kundavi, c'mon eat.

32
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,816
No way.

33
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,184
What do you want, dear?

34
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,136
Yes, I'm Kundavi.

35
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,100
Our family is the richest family
in the village.

36
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,798
Everyone come to my father
to solve their problems.

37
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,602
Sometimes, they come to me.

38
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,608
What you did was wrong.

39
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:11,113
You rap her head twice & give her
the candies. This is my judgement.

40
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,949
I had 2 very close friends.
Tamizh & Subbu.

41
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,792
We studied together from 1st std.

42
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,227
Sorry... We roamed together.

43
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,568
Local, Government Higher Secondary school.

44
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:32,766
11.

45
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,269
This school will go to ashes.

46
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,642
And then to Women's college in Ambai.

47
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,576
Yesterday, a doctor came to see my father.

48
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,287
He was wearing goggles and
had a small mole near his eye.

49
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,080
He was very handsome.

50
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,984
How did you see the mole when
he was wearing goggles?

51
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,158
Just a second...

52
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,253
We were unlucky not to study
in co-education school or college.

53
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,694
Our principal is...

54
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,071
Give it fast. She might come.

55
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,405
You cheats.

56
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:15,981
Your parents have to be blamed.

57
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,213
Sometimes boys from near by village
come to our college to ogle at us.

58
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,887
But they will be beaten
black & blue by the police.

59
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,854
Stop running. - Please leave us, sir.

60
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,155
Devil.

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,136
Who will come to our college to ogle at us?

62
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,274
There was no one to ogle at us.

63
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,007
Poor we girls!

64
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:51,743
So, we decided that day.

65
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:56,783
We decided that our marriage
must be a love marriage.

66
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,991
We started to look out for good boys.

67
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,831
He looks nice, ah?

68
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,544
Girls, look at him.

69
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,348
Theatre is full. Get the film.

70
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,077
Why're you both staring at me?!
His moustache is very big.

71
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,253
So what?

72
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,424
That means he'll be very good in sex.

73
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,130
Look at the one in red shirt. - Him?

74
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,325
He looks like rogue.

75
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,266
He is much better than your moustache guy.

76
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,302
Get lost.

77
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,475
She likes him.
Why don't you get her married to him?

78
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,802
No. She can marry him only after my death.

79
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,171
Then die.

80
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,745
Asking your father to die?

81
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,639
If I can marry only afteryour death,
then die.

82
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,348
There were big fights.

83
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,848
No one was ready for a compromise.

84
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,393
We took a bold decision.

85
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,698
They got very good men
meeting their expectations.

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,861
Inform my father, Kundavi.

87
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,644
But I was unlucky.

88
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,012
There is an alliance for
Kundavi from Courtallam.

89
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,584
Shall we fix the alliance?

90
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,849
At her age I was a mother
to 2 children.

91
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,856
Fix her marriage soon.

92
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,460
Oldie, I will kill you.

93
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,892
How can I marry a stranger
all of a sudden?

94
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,259
I prayed to god not to let
this marriage happen.

95
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:55,202
Sister... - What?

96
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,273
The groom has agreed for this alliance.

97
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,577
Next month is your marriage.

98
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,007
Get lost.

99
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,578
She feels very shy.

100
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:07,709
God too gave up.
Everything is over.

101
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:12,415
How will be my husband?

102
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,208
Give it to me if it tastes bitter.

103
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:43,011
Why do friends come for a marriage?

104
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:48,291
With a hope that the groom
will buy them drinks.

105
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,156
But you never even bought us
a water bottle to drink.

106
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,161
And you are having beer all alone.

107
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,597
Are we here to throw empty bottles?

108
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,140
Are you blind? Drive carefully.

109
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,241
If you want to commit suicide,
do it alone.

110
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,979
We missed death by a whisker.

111
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,110
If I had to marry a man like him,
I would've listened to my father.

112
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,483
But I got carried away
by his moustache.

113
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,056
Has everyone come?

114
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,169
He is your father-in-law.

115
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,004
Give way. Here comes the bride.

116
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:36,970
Smile please.

117
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,438
Move.

118
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,055
Buy me a skirt in her sari's colour.

119
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,726
Isn't the red little bright?

120
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,326
Look at her henna.

121
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,893
Send messages later.

122
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,733
Beat the drums.

123
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:33,329
My life is finished.

124
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:52,876
Subbaiah, did your daughter eat raw rice?

125
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,620
It's raining very heavily today.

126
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:23,776
<i># Walked down the aisle. #</i>

127
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,554
<i># And taken the marriage vows. #</i>

128
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:38,328
<i># The bride now holds the
hands of her husband. #</i>

129
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:45,067
<i># Beat the drums. #</i>

130
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:53,576
<i># Our song will be as beautiful

131
00:11:54,446 --> 00:12:02,251
<i># Our song will be as beautiful
as the waterfalls. #</i>

132
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,774
<i># She is like the sweet of Ambasamudram, #</i>

133
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,942
<i># And fresh as Thazhampoo. #</i>

134
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,622
<i># He is like Azhagu Thevar's sickle
of Aalvarkuruchi, #</i>

135
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,783
<i># ... and strong as Burma teak. #</i>

136
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,453
<i># Let's dance... #</i>

137
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,567

let's dance. #</i>

138
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,466
<i># Let's dance... #</i>

139
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,131
<i># ... like the bee buzzing around
a flower for honey. #</i>

140
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,973
<i># Hey girls... #</i>

141
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,049
<i># Our king has now a new queen. #</i>

142
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:13,988
<i># God brought them together,
since they were made for each other. #</i>

143
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,993
<i># Let's ward off the evil eyes. #</i>

144
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,826
<i># Let's offer prayers to God. #</i>

145
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,164

146
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,264

<i># ... like the bee buzzing around

154
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,233
Talk to him.

155
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,405
Talk what?

156
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,399
Whether your first night can
be arranged right here?

157
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,571
Get lost.

158
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,744
<i># The food is waiting for the dry fish gravy. #</i>

159
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:53,517
<i># Like well prepared Biryani,
both of your hearts are well baked. #</i>

160
00:14:53,726 --> 00:15:00,598
<i># Delay not, else the fish gravy
will get spoilt. #</i>

161
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,102
<i># Shall I wait for you near the door? #</i>

162
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,263
<i># Your hearts will be yearning
to come closer. #</i>

163
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,102
<i># You can't sleep alone. #</i>

164
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,937
<i># Even the cot & the bed never sleep. #</i>

165
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,104

<i># I'll come home singing. #</i>

178
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:47,471
<i># This goat will jump the fence,
because it is very eager to do it. #</i>

179
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,203
<i># I'm the rooster & you are the hen. #</i>

180
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,211
<i># Won't they kiss with their beaks? #</i>

181
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,212
<i># The groom is so hot, #</i>

182
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,214
<i># and their souls yearning to get closer, #</i>

183
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,719
<i># they'll weave themselves to one. #</i>

184
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,552
<i># Let's dance... #</i>

185
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,560
<i># ... like the rain drops dancing on earth,
let's dance. #</i>

186
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:16,393
<i># Let's dance... #</i>

187
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:20,727
<i># ... like the bee buzzing around
a flower for honey. #</i>

188
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,521
Go.

189
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,558
You're doing too much.

190
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,724
There is a saying that
"It is a god's gift to get a good wife".

191
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,960
That applies to husband too.

192
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:56,734
My formula that love marriages are good
now stands failed and disgraced.

193
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,279
After 6 years...

194
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,950
Mumbai.

195
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,875
Are you a rogue to whistle?

196
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,668
You don't behave like a school boy.

197
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,641
Like father like son.

198
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,576
Don't spoil my mood early morning.

199
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,375
And don't make me a beast.

200
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:44,615
Beast? Look at you, eating like a pig.

201
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,918
What? Pig? You are a soar.

202
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,219
What do you think of yourself?

203
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,329
How dare you abuse me?

204
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,490
What do you think of yourself?

205
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,901
What are you? Awoman or a loud speaker?

206
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,112
Eat.

207
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,620
Aren't your parents at home?

208
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,883
They are very irresponsible.

209
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,688
Without worrying about me at home.
They go out & romance.

210
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,861
You eat.

211
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,432
Even my parents' marriage was
a love marriage.

212
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,042
They fell in love before marriage.
So, they are fighting now.

213
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,904
But my parents didn't love before marriage.

214
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,273
So, they love each other & go out.

215
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,747
Oh god! It's getting late. I've to go.

216
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,317
You take care. - Okay I'll take care.

217
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,147
See you on Monday. - Bye

218
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,457
Bye. - Bye...

219
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,626
See you Kundavi.

220
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,057
Kundavi... - Yes Mam.

221
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,294
Where are you going? Sit.

222
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,933
It's alright. Tell me.

223
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:56,602
Today evening's my son's birthday party.
Come there with your hero at 9.

224
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:03,238
Madam, today is Saturday. So...

225
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,344
Okay. - Okay mam, bye.

226
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,082
Oh No! - I told you not to...

227
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,029
You...

228
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:26,027
<i># College girls & young women are after me. #</i>

229
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,604
She has come. - Is it?

230
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,437
Keep this inside.
- Why? Can't you keep it inside?

231
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,668
I said go.

232
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,608
Makes me do everything.

233
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,016
I saw a superb scene in the lift.

234
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,714
They were kissing in the lift.

235
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,519
So what?

236
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,495
I shouldn't have told you.

237
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,967
I've finished my dinner.

238
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,640
Can't you see the mirror?
Think you're too clever!

239
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,445
Daddy... - Yes dear.

240
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,084
She is from Ambasamudram
but trying to become American.

241
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,580
What did you say?

242
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,083
What did she say?

243
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,957
You are from Ambasamudram
but trying to become an American.

244
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,363
Donkey!

245
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,701
Open the door.

246
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:31,932
Hey, what?

247
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,105
She is so young.
How dare she speak like that!

248
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,706
You've grown so old.
But you haven't learnt Hindi yet.

249
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,236
Open the door.
Why should I learn Hindi?

250
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,209
O my Tamil girl! It's getting late.

251
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,582
Come fast.

252
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,613
Cheers!

253
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,524
Yuck! Will you never give up
that nasty localite's habit?

254
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,860
We are class only to look,
but really mass.

255
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,963
Do you want me to sip it slowly?

256
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,570
If I gulp it, it must rock me.

257
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,373
Don't talk nasty things.

258
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,237
Pour.

259
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:26,556
Angel! There won't be any problem in this
world if all wives are like you, right?

260
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,584
Pour.

261
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,352
Finished! Your quota is over.

262
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,157
My sweetheart! Just one more peg.

263
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,791
Don't be adamant.

264
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,664
Didn't I tell you about
a free show in the lift?

265
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,533
To celebrate it, come on... pour.
- I saw it, then I should also drink.

266
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:46,434
I drink oryou drink is same,
my darling, please one peg.

267
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,141
You'll do a bottoms up.

268
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,714
A digestive tomorrow will ease it.

269
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,145
No... give it to me.

270
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:11,296
Lily... Jasmine...

271
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:24,672
You are keeping me happy,
am I keeping you happy?

272
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,616
Say it.

273
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:37,021
I'm more happy with you
than with my parents.

274
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:37,990
Are you happy?

275
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,765
I'm the happiest man in the world!
- Don't shout! It's midnight.

276
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:52,100
Dear, a happy man will never do wrong.
- Started it, he'll not stop it.

277
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:59,105
My dear, you're the reason
for my happiness.

278
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,984
Where are you going?
- I want to share my happiness with others.

279
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:06,919
Come here.

280
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,320
I'm the happiest man in the world!

281
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:17,491
Enjoy young man... enjoy.
- Thank you.

282
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,866
<i>Dad, I can't bear this late night drama,
go to sleep now.</i>

283
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,438
Got the stick.

284
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,172
Ishu, your father is asleep.

285
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,030
How many village problems
should I settle man? -Yes, brother.

286
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:50,759
Look, people are waiting
with children in tow.

287
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,194
Are all the people of 18 villages here?

288
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,534
Later don't complain about that man
or this man is missing.

289
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,213
I've to visit many such village meetings.

290
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,283
If you get a man,
settle your problem instantly.

291
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,215
Bloody idiot! Come here
and do as we say.

292
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,322
Why are you shouting at me?

293
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,950
Bloody, didn't I tell you not to
take individual decisions?

294
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,926
Wait man, I'm not here foryou,
I'm here for all the people here.

295
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,222
Why are you shouting like the President?

296
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:22,729
Given a chance everyone becomes
a self appointed president... move.

297
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,027
Brother is coming...
move, brother is coming.

298
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:25,827
Finish quickly.

299
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,732
Take your leg, bloody.

300
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,931
Bloody, will you pinch the hip
of a child's mother?

301
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,133
If hip is alluring, who will bother
about if she's a mother or virgin.

302
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,539
Just for pinching a woman's hip,

303
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:40,309
you've all gathered here leaving your work,
were you born to guests?

304
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,919
Wait... wait... don't rush.

305
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,089
Is it ready?

306
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,715
It's ready, brother.

307
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,018
Don't cry, isn't it a shame
to me, you rascal?

308
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,430
Okay, for pinching her hip,
please forgive me your own son.

309
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,865
After misbehaving with a woman,
are you claiming to be our son?

310
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,038
Bash him up!

311
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,069
How proud he's feeling?

312
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,806
Take it out.

313
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:10,912
This is the last.

314
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,846
I've a strong body and it's taking
all the public beating.

315
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,411
Wear it brother.

316
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,622
We couldn't see this,
how could you bear it?

317
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,727
Got used to it.

318
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,261
I'll contest elections with this.
- Election?

319
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,831
Yes, how much stick I got from public.

320
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,003
If I ask votes, people will vote me to
become CM on sympathy wave.

321
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,570
I'll make you all MLA's
- MLA's?

322
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,700
Use powder, you're a genius, brother.

323
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,642
The only leader to accept his
mistake and get punished. - Long live!

324
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,180
Leader of great self respect.
- Long live!

325
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,452
Bye... bye... let's meet in the next meeting.

326
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:58,823
Long live future CM, future PM,
future President.

327
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,157
Stop it.
- Have we reached home?

328
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:03,500
I wanted to ask you this for long time.
- What is it?

329
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,961
You face bravely so many
problems everyday,

330
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,660
how many meetings you attend,

331
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,898
but you're entering your
home from back door?

332
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,907
Isn't it cheap foryour status?
- There's a reason for it. -What's it?

333
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,275
My father-in-law is always
in the front yard,

334
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,451
if he stops me & asks any question,
I'll get furious,

335
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,677
if I get angry, criminal inside me will
come out and it will wreck my family.

336
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,616
Do I need it?
- How can you think all this?

337
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:27,518
We must always have foresight.

338
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,526
Where are you coming in?
- To your home.

339
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:35,298
Friendship stops with the gate,
don't come in to have free meals.

340
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,560
Vellaisamy brother! - What?
- Do you know this?

341
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,032
How can I know unless you tell me?

342
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,262
Get lost man.

343
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,032
You're beating me for coming
to tell you a news.

344
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,406
I beat you unwittingly, tell me now.
- No, I'll not tell.

345
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,808
If you don't tell, my head will break.
- That's...

346
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,911
Start with usual brother.

347
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:53,947
Okay.

348
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,984
Brother, your family is starting
a new rice mill, right? -Yes.

349
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,182
Instead of naming it on you, they are
planning to name it after someone else.

350
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,224
Guruvamma!

351
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,057
Brother, you pinched a woman's hip,
that's her name.

352
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,833
Yes... Chellathai...

353
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,558
That's perfect... make a grand entry.

354
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,466
Can't you hear my call?

355
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:21,077
I did hear, both Chellathai and Guruvamma.

356
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,077
Don't talk about that.
Answer my question.

357
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,078
Who am I?

358
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,073
Father of my children.

359
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,582
Who am I to you?
- Husband.

360
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,515
Who am I to your father?
- Worst son-in-law.

361
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,212
What?
- I said eldest son-in-law.

362
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:36,553
Got it? I'm your husband, father to your children,
son-in-law to your father,

363
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,059
I'm holding three positions
in this family,

364
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:42,426
it seems you're discussing about
a name to the new rice mill.

365
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,827
Yes, so what?

366
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,299
Asking me what? One slap and
you'll come to senses.

367
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,905
How many problems I'm facing
outside for this family,

368
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,473
how many sacrifices I'm making,

369
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,373
will you lose anything if you
name it after me?

370
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,208
What's that noise?
- I'm talking here, father-in-law.

371
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,111
Will I get scared if he asks me?

372
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,377
Is your father a great Madurai Veeran
with that big moustache?

373
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,953
What's that noise again?
- I'm talking father-in-law.

374
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,956
Will I get scared if he calls me?
- Loweryour voice. -Why should I?

375
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,751
That's better.

376
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,293
I'll thrash everyone here.

377
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,456
How? Like you got beaten up just
now in a public meeting.

378
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,929
Has the news reached so fast?

379
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,798
Not only this news another news
has also reached us.

380
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,405
Children! Come here.
- What's it mother?

381
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,267
Who didn't beat your father?
- Venkatesh's father and Suresh's father.

382
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,038
Have they left you so early?

383
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,310
What a great children you've begotten.

384
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,484
How will your children be?

385
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:37,620
Can you name the rice mill after
me or not? Answer me first.

386
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:43,759
No chance.

387
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,228
What's that noise?
- Why are you after my life?

388
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,230
You can hear it clearly,
why are you asking again?

389
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,732
You want to know everything.

390
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,699
He's asking too many questions
sporting a big moustache.

391
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,167
Wait, I'll also sport a big moustache.

392
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,807
Oh God! I got angry...
they'll poison my food.

393
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,137
Take it sir.

394
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,972
Why is son-in-law raising hell there?
- Nothing father.

395
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,620
Devar... - Yes sir.

396
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,450
What is Kundavi's husband doing?

397
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,286
He's working with a car
company in Bombay.

398
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,760
Ask him to check ouryounger
son-in-law's horoscope also. - Give me.

399
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,126
Sir... my younger son-in-law's horoscope.

400
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:41,409
Sir.

401
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,318
Did you fix marriage of Kundavi after
matching horoscopes, right? -Yes sir.

402
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,485
Why are you asking that sir?

403
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:53,528
Nothing... according to the horoscope
your son-in-law has two wives.

404
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,398
What's this shocking news sir?
- I'm telling truth.

405
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,009
In which world are you in?

406
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,804
Hey, look there.

407
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,310
Isn't he smart and handsome?

408
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,347
From which state he'll be?

409
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:19,585
Can't you smell the South Indian
Idli sambar from him?

410
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,849
I've come with my friend.

411
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:26,226
Didn't I tell you about a dream boy
coming regularly in my dreams?

412
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,088
He's just like him.

413
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,267
Stop lying.
- I promise.

414
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:34,097
Which school are you studying?
- If you like him propose immediately.

415
00:34:34,805 --> 00:34:38,536
How can I propose in the first meeting?
No chance.

416
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:44,214
Look, boys get good girls very easily.
But for we girls, no way.

417
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:49,444
Excuse me, I overheard your conversation.
Can I help you?

418
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,082
We can take care of ourselves,
take a walk.

419
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,754
Coming forward to help.

420
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:01,864
She's more beautiful than you,
chubby like a Teddy bear, be careful.

421
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,528
Will he be still alone without
any woman in his life?

422
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,332
You like Rajinkanth?
- Rajinikanth?

423
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:15,740
Did you see his face?
See how happy he is smiling always.

424
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,943
That means there's no woman in his life.

425
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,955
Come fast... he'll go away.

426
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,731
Come fast... he's going away.

427
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,502
Please do something.

428
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,338
Are you a Madrasi?
- Yeah.

429
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,601
Didn't I tell you?

430
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,403
You want me to do anything?

431
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,982
No, she's up to something.
- Shut up. Don't put me in a fix.

432
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:56,486
Come out clearly, he's asking you.
- Tell me.

433
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,283
I... please don't mistake me.

434
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,016
No... no... it's okay, you carry on.

435
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,585
I like you very much.

436
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:10,128
So I love you & want to marry you,
that's what you want to say, right? Tell him.

437
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,323
Why is she interfering?

438
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:12,695
Clear her out.

439
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:14,700
Come with me.

440
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,202
What do you think of yourself?

441
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,938
Listen if you say anything...

442
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,868
No... you've mistaken me.

443
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,545
What? Are you in love with me?
- Yes.

444
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:27,315
You want to marry me?
- Yes.

445
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,615
She's good... tell her I'll marry her.

446
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,253
Hey, stop shouting.

447
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,893
But, there's a small problem.

448
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,325
Tell me, whatever may be the problem,
let's solve it.

449
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:44,125
I've married only once.

450
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,365
So what? Divorce her and marry this girl.

451
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,299
This idea is good.

452
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:54,742
Okay... okay.

453
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:58,073
I'm also bored living with her.

454
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,413
I'll divorce her.

455
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,242
Divorce?

456
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,383
Get lost.

457
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,682
Will you divorce?

458
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:12,326
Who are you?
How dare you beat him?

459
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,526
Are you bored living with me?

460
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,290
You're telling this with
some unknown girl.

461
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,593
Listen to me.
They just asked me.

462
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,300
You say what's in your heart.

463
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,268
What? So proud?
- They just asked me. Just for fun.

464
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,966
Fun... will you divorce me for fun?

465
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,612
If any woman other than me
enters your life I'll kill you.

466
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,676
Hey! Rogue stop. - Sorry girls.

467
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,476
If you see any girl I'll kill you.

468
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,351
It's all fate.

469
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,122
You went little overboard.
- Poor girl.

470
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,289
They asked if I'm from Madras.

471
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,522
She was swooning on you.

472
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:50,625
One minute.

473
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,799
Tell me Kavi.

474
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,060
Are you busy Gowtham?

475
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,966
We'll get Ananda Vikatan here,
I'll buy and come. - Okay.

476
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,271
No... no... tell me.
- Our Nithish... the thin guy...

477
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,439
What happened to him?

478
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,737
He has run away with our senior's wife.

479
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh my god!

480
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,173
Very strange. After that...

481
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:11,146
What did he do?
- He's crying loudly in office.

482
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,822
She'll be more than 40...

483
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,513
No age bar for eloping.

484
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,386
Who is it? Bloody...

485
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,135
What man?

486
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:02,902
How are you?

487
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,012
Well gentlemen, as I told you earlier,

488
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,189
European cars are the best in the world,

489
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,621
what they have done on the European
model is something fundamental,

490
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:26,062
now, let's take a look at what they
have done on the Indian models,

491
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,758
as you see here in the Indian model cars,

492
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,230
we don't have enough stroke
length for the piston,

493
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:35,371
and hence the torque and the power
is very normal for a normal rpm,

494
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,032
now what I'm going to do here is,

495
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,869
I'm going to increase the
stroke length of the piston,

496
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,669
see... as simple as that,

497
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,007
since I've increased the
stroke length of the piston,

498
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,376
the volumetric efficiency...

499
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,551
This will not work in Indian conditions.

500
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:51,050
...the power and torque automatically
increases for the same normal rpm.

501
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,587
Well, that's about it, gentlemen.

502
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,056
Sir, what you say may suit to
your European standards,

503
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:01,220
you don't seem to know about the Indian roads,
and Indian attitude towards driving,

504
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,163
for that we may have to increase
the bore die of the cylinder,

505
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,896
to get volumetric efficiency, power,
torque for the same rpm.

506
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,035
Was it you? -Yes sir.
- Who are you?

507
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,278
In what capacity you say this to me?

508
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,744
Sir, this is Gowtham,
one of our chief mechanic.

509
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:23,443
Mr. Ranganathan, I don't need any
mechanic to design my cars. You got it?

510
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,248
I mean mechanic.
Just ask him to get out.

511
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:31,292
Sir, foryour information, he's from
our side near Tenkasi.

512
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,120
Do you want to fix any alliance
with him? Send him out.

513
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,561
Mechanic, know your limitations.

514
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,800
We are not so foolish to take advises
from a mechanic. Just get out of here.

515
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:47,403
Sir, I'll continue only if he leaves
this place. Sorry gentlemen.

516
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,373
Leave me sir.

517
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,222
Security, whose car is this?
Remove it.

518
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,375
Hey Mechanic! Come here.

519
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,153
Father has come.

520
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,898
What's it mechanic?
You've come early?

521
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,372
Good mechanic or bad mechanic?

522
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,135
Good bad mechanic.

523
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,344
I'll prepare it tomorrow, okay?

524
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,042
Sure?

525
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,687
What mechanic? Deaf?

526
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:05,919
Why are you off the mood?

527
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,050
Will you please stop calling
me a mechanic?

528
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,062
What am I to call a mechanic other
than a mechanic, a doctor?

529
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:19,267
Okay, hereafter don't call me like that.
- I'll call you like that only.

530
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,067
Mechanic... mechanic...

531
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:25,571
I'll slap you.

532
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,903
I'm just a mechanic not a pimp, right?

533
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:28,669
Go away.

534
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,837
Wait for 15 minutes,
I'll fix your breakfast.

535
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,983
Excuse me sir. - Yeah. Thanks.

536
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,921
Let's try this in

537
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,161
Just try this.

538
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:46,115
I don't think this will go well...
- Don't discourage me. - Okay then...

539
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,648
Not yet started?
Still what are you doing there?

540
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:54,216
Buddy, I've to go now...

541
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,551
Hey, what's all this?
Why are you calling me often?

542
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,728
Since morning, your wife
called me several times.

543
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,304
Why don't you call her back?
- I'll call her sir.

544
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,239
I'll talk to her.

545
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,491
That's great!

546
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,144
Hey, what are you doing here?

547
00:45:58,488 --> 00:45:59,546
Get inside the car.

548
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,593
Please listen to me...

549
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,330
It's raining. Get inside the car.

550
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,571
You got bored living with me, right?

551
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:25,076
There was a problem in my office...
Come home, I'll explain it to you.

552
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,214
Since morning, I called you several times...

553
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,112
You didn't even bother to attend
even a single call, did you?

554
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,859
How badly you abused me
as our child was watching?

555
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:43,462
I just didn't mean it...
- Don't lie. It wasn't like that...

556
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:56,643
Mom, let's excuse dad this time.

557
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,715
Mom, excuse him this time...

558
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,548
Poor dad! Let's go... come on...

559
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,857
Come on, mom. Listen to me...

560
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,966
Dad, do I've to tell you separately?
Come on, dad.

561
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,422
They made me drench in
the rain in their fight.

562
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,255
Go and sleep without making fuss.

563
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,141
Leave me...

564
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,348
I'll beat you... leave me...

565
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,315
Getting angry on me?

566
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,149
Don't try to cajole me...

567
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,364
<i># It's a joyful moment... #</i>

568
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,697
<i># Come on, my dear... #</i>

569
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,769

00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,379

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,548

<i># Oh my love! I'm calling you... #</i>

573
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,720
<i># There is no one to stop us. #</i>

574
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:59,956
<i># Who is going to seep down like
water to the roots? #</i>

575
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:05,061
<i># I'll try to quench your thirsty. #</i>

576
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:15,837

577
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:22,779

<i># Oh my love! I'm calling you... #</i>

581
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:07,455
<i># Give me a memorable kiss. #</i>

582
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,760
<i># Come on, let's follow give and take policy. #</i>

583
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:19,635
<i># Hey, what are you talking? #</i>

584
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,342
<i># Hey, what are you talking? #</i>

585
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,810
<i># What is going on here? #</i>

586
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,314
<i># Shall I give you a sweet kiss? #</i>

587
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,712
<i># It's a joyful moment... #</i>

588
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,218
<i># Come on, my dear... #</i>

589
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,227
<i># It's a cool ginger beer! #</i>

590
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:23,805
<i># Fill up the glass as it gets empty. #</i>

591
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:34,047
<i># Our souls have merged into one. #</i>

592
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:39,917
<i># It's a cool ginger beer! #</i>

593
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,256
<i># It's a joyful moment... #</i>

594
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,295
<i># Come on, my dear... #</i>

595
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:55,936
<i># It's a joyful moment... #</i>

596
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:06,211

00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,579

00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:15,950

602
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:35,207

603
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:48,182
<i># There is something fishy
in the night... #</i>

604
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,482
Gowtham...

605
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,056
Shall I ask you one thing? - Yes.

606
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,261
Shall we change this bed?

607
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,762
Why? What's wrong with this bed?

608
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,228
It's a big and comfortable cot, isn't it?

609
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,341
Midnight, you're going away from me.

610
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:42,500
I'm not able to get you...

611
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,041
You should always be closer to me.

612
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,380
I should always feel your breath.

613
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,386
Shall we change it?

614
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,390
Let's have a small and compact cot.

615
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,662
Coming straight from Nepal,
why are you killing me?

616
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,025
Did you call me?

617
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,231
Mr. Ranganathan wants to see you. Come...
- What is the matter?

618
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:12,636
Why?

619
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:13,740
I don't know.

620
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,206
Sir, did you call me?

621
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,214
Please sit. - Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

622
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,442
What man?

623
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:37,495
Excellent! You've made it!

624
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,160
I sent your design to R & D.

625
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,532
They approved it and sent it to America.

626
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,231
They have called you there. That's it.

627
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,443
Sir, when did you do all these things?
- Just I sent it.

628
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,310
Sir, give me your hand... thanks a lot.

629
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,880
Hey buddy, thanks.

630
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,084
Sir, you're great!

631
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,015
I can't believe this!

632
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:00,650
Sorry...

633
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,461
Where is Kundavi?

634
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,521
I won't spare him.

635
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:09,590
Thanks...

636
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,259
Hey dear...

637
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,795
What? - A good news...

638
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:19,439
I'm going to America for a Designers' meet
on behalf of our Company.

639
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,633
Wow! Congrats!

640
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:22,971
Another important matter...

641
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,478
I'll deliver my speech to same dog
that threw me out.

642
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,483
First I'll tell this to my father.

643
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,389
Sorry... - Congrats.
- Thank you. Excuse me...

644
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,957
Do you know why we all have gathered here?

645
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:43,597
Though my husband is good for nothing...

646
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,291
But my sister's husband,
my brother-in-law...

647
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,529
Is going to America on a job.

648
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:57,305
So, my father has decided to go to
Bombay and give him a send off.

649
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,778
Who else is interested to come with us?
Raise your hands.

650
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,379
What man! She is teaching a lesson?
- It's good news, isn't it?

651
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,712
Why are you raising your hand?
- I want to go to Bombay.

652
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,754
Look, she has insulted me.
How dare you raise your hand?

653
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,982
Put down your hand.
Or else, I'll cut it tonight.

654
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,296
Father, my husband isn't
interested to come.

655
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,660
Let's leave him alone and let's all go there.

656
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,331
Brother, you've committed a mistake.
- What did I do?

657
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,631
Mumbai girls are fairer.

658
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,434
If they see a black man like you...

659
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:31,012
They will take you home & keep you
with them to admire you...

660
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,444
5 days?! What are you talking man?

661
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,517
First, reserve your ticket.
I'll give you further details later.

662
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,682
If I go and tell her, she'll think bad about me.
You go and tell her.

663
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:46,595
I've forced brother and he too
has agreed to come there.

664
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,423
Are you all happy now?

665
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:53,364
No need to force or compel
him to come there.

666
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,765
Let him be here and do his work.

667
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:00,170
Hey, In the interest of our family,
a great man is advising you.

668
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,207
Why are you opposing him?

669
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,880
I'll also come there.
- So, are you also coming there?

670
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,173
Didn't I tell you I'll come?
Buy a ticket for me too.

671
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,543
Okay father. Count him also in the group.

672
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,616
He will be helpful to carry this old woman.

673
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,545
Am I here to carry an old woman?
- Brother, you can carry her easily.

674
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:14,814
One important matter... - What's it?

675
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:19,552
You ask your brother in Bombay
to give you a separate room.

676
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,390
Only then, you can have great time.

677
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,563
I will.

678
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:28,961
I'll open the door.

679
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,606
Welcome...

680
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,803
I didn't wash my hand...

681
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,848
Welcome uncle...

682
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,040
Welcome Periyappa...

683
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:48,683
How are you, grandma?

684
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,086
Welcome...

685
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,598
Hey, hold the mirror properly.
- Hey, are you going to marry?

686
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,960
Take off the hair from your chest.
I can't bear that smell.

687
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,593
Hey, come out...

688
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:05,036
Why are you breaking the line?
Stand in a line...

689
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,004
It's like a queue in a ration shop.
What happened?

690
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,577
Some one is inside and
not opening the door...

691
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,769
Whom so ever it may be!

692
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,449
When he comes out,
I'll punch his face...

693
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,947
Oh! It's our Vellaichami brother.

694
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,883
Why did you take so much time in the toilet?

695
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,784
Last night, did you allow me to
sleep in the train? - For that?

696
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,118
So, ljust overslept inside.
Can't you bear that?

697
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,726
Is this the place to sleep?

698
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,561
Shut up! What's wrong in that?

699
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:28,890
Two people use toilet at one time.

700
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,293
Two people?
How can two people use one toilet?

701
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,402
Go man! You know only to
make the place dirty!

702
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,572
Brother, don't stop me.

703
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,900
What did I tell you?
- What did you tell me?

704
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,043
Didn't you tell you'll ask him to give
me a separate room? -Yes.

705
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,147
Did you tell him?
- Before that let me use the pot first.

706
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:51,149
Brother, he wants to know where
you've allotted room to him.

707
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,981
Why? Can't he open his mouth?

708
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:58,650
Since you've great respect for him.
He doesn't wants to lose it.

709
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:00,820
What man?

710
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,997
What?

711
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,927
It's very urgent and
I'm controlling myself...

712
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,725
Brother, it's me. - Is it you?

713
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,232
Had you told me this earlier,
I would've arranged a room foryou?

714
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,096
Come on...

715
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,398
Come with me. You should go to toilet
only after getting a room.

716
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,431
You had told me this and that
and encouraged me to come here...

717
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,806
Is going to toilet important now?
I'll kill you...

718
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,037
Sleep comfortably...

719
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:24,152
Why did he bring us here?
- I don't know...

720
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:25,684
That's it. Leave some space...

721
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,855
Brother, come on. Your room is ready.

722
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,253
Sleep comfortably.

723
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,725
Do you want me to sleep here?
- Adjust and sleep.

724
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,826
Brother, are you making fun of me?

725
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,729
Didn't you tell me you'll give a room?
Now asking me to lie down here?!

726
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,870
They are all very bad people.

727
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:46,235
If I sleep with them, I will completely
get destroyed. Do you know that?

728
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,034
Do you know the meaning of brother?
- What?

729
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,541
We have married sisters
to become brothers.

730
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,680
Is it? - Yes.

731
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,372
My wife is a elder sister to your wife.

732
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,052
How dare you behave like this with me?

733
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:00,686
I've taken so much trouble to come here.
Betteryou give me a separate room.

734
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,382
What's your problem?
Is it uncomfortable to you? -Yes.

735
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,989
You go back to your place.
- What?

736
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,390
I said go back to your place.

737
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,862
What is this brother?
I just don't want to sleep here.

738
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,001
Did I tell you that I won't sleep in terrace?
Why are you getting angry?

739
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,170
Shut up and sleep here, you idiot!

740
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,103
You've made the toilet dirty
and raising voice here?!

741
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,173
Hey, Serve Biryani for brother.

742
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:24,244
Shall I go to toilet now?
- Get lost man!

743
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,105
You stupid fellow!

744
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,508
Sleep man. I'm getting sleep...

745
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,648
Where are you going?

746
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:35,115
Why are you stopping here?
Is this the place? - Yes.

747
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,313
Shake hands...

748
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:42,590
Didn't you tell me that Mumbai girls
are very fond of black men? - Yes.

749
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:51,969
I've managed to get some money
on loan without anyone's knowledge.

750
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,972
It shouldn't go in waste.
And I should enjoy it fully.

751
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:58,170
I shouldn't forget Mumbai in my life.
- Yes. You won't forget this place.

752
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,939
I'll choose the best...

753
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,285
Go... go...

754
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,095
Hey, why are you following me?

755
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,734
To help you.
- To help me?

756
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:24,168
I don't need your help now...
especially here...

757
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,399
Stand outside, you skin head!
- I'll sit in a corner and watch the show...

758
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:30,405
What! Is there any show going inside?

759
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:34,208
I'll rip you apart. Get lost man!

760
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,643
I say get out...

761
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:39,583
Hey, why are you showing a long face?

762
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,789
My happiness is yours. Go.

763
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:44,685
Okay.

764
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:46,894
You shouldn't cry...

765
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,494
I thought of enjoying the show watching it,
but you spoilt that also.

766
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,192
Let your fun time turn into
testing time, go man!

767
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,098
I thought he will take me inside.
But left me alone!

768
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:05,747
Everything is wrong! - Brother, what happened?
Did any snake bite you?

769
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:10,882
It's double inside.
- You paid for single, why double inside?

770
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,953
I didn't mean that. This is different.

771
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:15,350
Brother, what are you talking?
- It's coming...

772
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,693
Why did you come outside?

773
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,027
Am I not beautiful?

774
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,196
You get back Rs. 5000 from her.
Get back Rs. 5000...

775
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,524
Brother, they won't return money here.

776
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,860
I don't want such type of women.
Where are the girls of my taste?

777
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,036
Get back Rs. 5000 from her.
- Return Rs. 5000 to him.

778
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:31,035
What Rs. 5000? Who gave me Rs. 5000?

779
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,937
You didn't give me anything...
Why are you lying?

780
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,806
All of you come out...

781
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,039
Oh no!

782
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,047
All of them belong to the same group!

783
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,225
Why are they clapping hands?

784
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,954
This man stayed here for 3 days.
He slept with everybody.

785
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,894
He should pay us Rs. 50000.

786
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,998
What is she saying man?

787
01:03:59,201 --> 01:03:59,724
I've forgotten the language.

788
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:00,903
I'll tell you, sir.

789
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,230
Wow! Tamilian! A person from our place!

790
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,736
Tell me the matter.

791
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:06,499
Since you've stayed here for 3 days
and had a great time,

792
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,142
she wants you to pay Rs. 50000.

793
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,072
Oh my god!

794
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,408
Hey, give my ball.
- Don't disturb grandma...

795
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,244
Father, did you call me?
- Yes dear...

796
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:18,579
Sit on the chair. - It's okay. Tell me...

797
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,080
When is son-in-law leaving?

798
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,347
At 10 pm.

799
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,186
Are you happy? -Yes. I'm happy...

800
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:30,191
Is son-in-law coming home correctly
after office hours? -Yes.

801
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,263
Why are you asking me that?

802
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,765
I thought he will be busy in office.

803
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,437
He won't work extra hours.

804
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,435
He will follow office timings strictly
and return home.

805
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,268
This is the first time he is staying
away from me and our child.

806
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,667
That's why I'm little worried.

807
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,012
Okay then. Carry on with your work.

808
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,274
You haven't changed!

809
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,951
Father, would you like to have coffee?
- No.

810
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:50,777
Okay bye...

811
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:51,954
Goggle wearing man... - Yes brother...

812
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,121
Come here...

813
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,453
Hey, look at there...

814
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,625
Here, Servant maid is looking marvelous.

815
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:00,955
How can we remain silent?

816
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,289
Is everything ready? -Yes.

817
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,624
It won't go wrong like earlier, will it?
- No way!

818
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,390
Then do one thing...

819
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,624
When my brother is leaving...

820
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,803
Ask some money on behalf of me.

821
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:08,971
Will you ask? -Yes brother.

822
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,803
Brother... greetings...

823
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:12,474
What's it?

824
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,576
My brother, I mean your brother
wants some money.

825
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,239
Oh! Take this...

826
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,139
What is this? - Money!

827
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,480
Money!?

828
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,486
Yes. It is also a money.

829
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,655
I'll kill you man...

830
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,654
Ask him a big amount.
- He wants a big amount!

831
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:32,259
Big one! I'll give you... take it.

832
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:34,762
How much? - This is a ticket.

833
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,494
Why are you giving your ticket to me?
- It's your ticket.

834
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,827
I'll buy my ticket when
I go back to my place.

835
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,330
I'm giving this to you before going...
Here you have 20 tickets.

836
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,164
My flight starts at 10 pm.
And your train starts at 8 pm.

837
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,169
You should start from here at 6 pm
to catch the train.

838
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,344
Take this and go back to your place.

839
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,843
We've come here to give you a send off,
but you're giving us a send-off?

840
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,242
Uncle... - What dear?

841
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,940
If you don't go back,
who will they respect there?

842
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,347
Sister-in-law, have you also
started kidding me?

843
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,024
We were looking after our work.

844
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,023
You only phoned and called us
to stay here for few days.

845
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,195
Have you forgotten it?

846
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,860
I said so a week ago.
Now I'm asking you to leave.

847
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,034
You...

848
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,033
Bombay is getting bombed everyday.

849
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,363
That's police force's headache.
Why are you giving us a shock now?

850
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,039
Then why did you call us here?

851
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,707
I'll definitely book a room and
stay here for 2 days.

852
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,035
I know your plan!

853
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,710
All of you come here.

854
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,881
I'll go man... I'll leave this place.

855
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,380
I've come to send you off but
you're giving me a send off.

856
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:29,380
Did you call me, brother-in-law?

857
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,213
What brother-in-law?! He has asked you to
go back to your place.

858
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,879
Let's go from here. Go man...

859
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,285
He may mistake me.
Please convince him...

860
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,396
Don't bother about him.
You go happily.

861
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,293
Son-in-law, I've kept all the
things inside the car.

862
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,338
I'll take leave then... - Happy journey.

863
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,073
Even if I'm busy, you keep calling me.

864
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,738
She will, don't worry. - Bye...

865
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,992
Always playing...

866
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,433
Where is your calendar?

867
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,272
What's this?

868
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,612
They've asked you to prepare
an Insect box. Did you do it?

869
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,110
Read properly...

870
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,643
Parents should make it for children.
That's you and your husband.

871
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,955
Oh no! I can't catch insects in Mumbai.
I can't do this!

872
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,124
Otherwise, they will throw me
out of the class.

873
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,354
Then, I'll start playing games.

874
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,786
What? Are you blackmailing me?

875
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:48,964
I'm serious, mom.

876
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,865
your father isn't here.

877
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,320
Call security guard.

878
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:16,548
You go, mom.

879
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,327
If you want an insect box, call him.

880
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,899
Is there an insect box inside it? - No.

881
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:30,498
Your dad treasures all that he
used in school and college.

882
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,230
Let's try... may be we can find it.

883
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,609
I'll help you.

884
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:41,175
Security, don't put it on my
mother's head. - Move.

885
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:49,851
Mom, I'll cut it.
- Hey, keep quiet. Don't be in a hurry.

886
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,377
Your insect box!

887
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,904
Gowtham, B.E.

888
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,182
That was my childhood ambition.

889
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,984
My role model was Engineer Raman
of my native place.

890
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:54,249
He wasn't a smart guy.

891
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:57,650
But all girls used to fall for him.

892
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,425
I liked it very much.

893
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:04,858
So, I was also interested to
become an engineer.

894
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:10,163
But like other boys, I started smoking,
drinking in my school days.

895
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,771
And scored less in my exams.

896
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:13,964
But I didn't give up!

897
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:18,978
I forced my uncle and got a B.E.
Seat by paying donation.

898
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:35,795
Since I was from village, everybody
ragged me in my first year.

899
01:10:36,598 --> 01:10:40,125
In the second year,
I took control over my college.

900
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,316
You're looking like a ladies' finger.

901
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:05,652
How dare you bring boys from outside?

902
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,183
A senior is chasing our classmate
and beating him.

903
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:44,145
Please sir... please...
Please spare him for my sake.

904
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,581
Hey, are you okay?

905
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,749
Bleeding heavily. Please sir.

906
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:53,661
Please sir.

907
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,259
Amazing look!

908
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,366
Hey, I thought you will rip him apart.

909
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:39,370
But why did you break the bulb?

910
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,208
She asked me to leave him, didn't she?

911
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,375
Who? Mother Teresa.

912
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,047
That girl...

913
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,045
Hey, it's too much, man.

914
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,378
You used to ogle every lady
professor in the college.

915
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,385
Now you're respecting a fresher?!

916
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,057
Did you stop beating him
hearing her words?

917
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:59,625
Hey, catch him... Hey, stop...
Leave me.

918
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:03,728
We didn't stop you.
Why are you showing-off like this?

919
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,730
He isn't listening to me.

920
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,061
He is looking at her only. -Yes buddy.

921
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,898
Hereafter he is the don of this college.
You should kiss his hands only.

922
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,073
If we overrule you.

923
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,901
Then you must offer me a beer.

924
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,407
Immediately send this circular
to the Principal.

925
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,762
I like 2 things very much.

926
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:38,433
One, playing football.

927
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,441
Two, drinking liquor and having fun.

928
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,623
Buddy, let's go to the hostel.

929
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,128
Here... here...

930
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,964
Stop laughing, senior.

931
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:19,067
Did I throw up?

932
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:21,640
No. Withdrew money from ATM.

933
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,071
Hey, clear him out.

934
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,814
Now, I've started liking
one more thing.

935
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:59,507
Faster... come this side...

936
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:07,349
Buddy, got tired?
- Hey, shut up man!

937
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,701
Hey, hold it... - I'm holding it...

938
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,198
First, loosen your grip on the brake.

939
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,202
Ishu, don't raise accelerator

940
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,706
Listen to me... - I know...

941
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,640
Look, I've learnt so quickly.

942
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,148
No way! - Don't shake, stupid.

943
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,375
I didn't, I'm turning that side, you fool!

944
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,389
Be careful... - Take off your hand.
I'll drive myself.

945
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,282
I know how you will drive!

946
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,323
You may pull me down along with you.

947
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,556
If I tell this to your father.

948
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,727
What will you do?

949
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,060
Hey...

950
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,085
Let's go on the road.

951
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:12,583
Got scared?!

952
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,089
Got scared of him?!

953
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,757
Is he a great man?!

954
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:18,919
Don't over act.

955
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,755
If he rules over there.
I rule over my place.

956
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:22,759
Just words!

957
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,861
If he crosses my line again, then...

958
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,432
Hey, buddy, what's spicy?

959
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,541
Here I've come to give you a shock!

960
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,278
Didn't get me?

961
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,286
Will your father teach her
to release the stand?

962
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:50,951
Teach her properly.

963
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,141
Hey Ishu, HOD is searching you.

964
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,143
I'll go...

965
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,427
Won't you greet your senior?

966
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:31,666
You were sleeping.

967
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,831
Even if I sleep, you should
greet me! Come here.

968
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,233
If you're an MP's daughter, that doesn't
mean you should be arrogant.

969
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,342
Come here.

970
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:53,686
What's your father's victory margin?
- 140004 votes

971
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,851
How many bogus votes out of them?

972
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,185
There were no bogus votes.

973
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:01,677
Wow!

974
01:20:03,055 --> 01:20:03,851
Senior!

975
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:08,860
Hey, Senior, what the hell are you doing?

976
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:09,857
Lakshmi Mills owner...

977
01:20:10,062 --> 01:20:11,529
No... Supervisor...

978
01:20:12,731 --> 01:20:13,857
He is my senior.

979
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,192
I'm senior, Anandha Narayanan.

980
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:20,360
Hey, sit man...
- Okay. Back to Pavilion.

981
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:23,869
He wants a Supervisor job in Lakshmi Mills.

982
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,544
It seems your father is a great man.

983
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:30,711
Get a recommendation letter
from him tomorrow.

984
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:33,316
No. He won't do such things.

985
01:20:44,596 --> 01:20:46,325
You should come with the letter, okay?

986
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:57,075
Senior, you didn't study well.

987
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:58,799
Atleast you could've learnt to piss properly?

988
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,911
If they offer Govt. Jobs to those
who stand and piss,

989
01:21:02,114 --> 01:21:03,240
Then, I'll stand and piss.

990
01:21:03,615 --> 01:21:08,678
Move that side man. - Clean it man.

991
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:10,419
Brother.

992
01:21:11,123 --> 01:21:12,750
Who's this?

993
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:14,755
What are you seeing here instead
of holding burette in the lab?

994
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,756
Sister is calling you.

995
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:17,428
If sister calls, ask your uncle to go.

996
01:21:17,629 --> 01:21:18,254
Why are you calling me?

997
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:20,090
Not my sister. It's Ishwarya sister.

998
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:22,426
Ishwarya?!

999
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:39,950
What?

1000
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:44,945
Letter.

1001
01:21:46,725 --> 01:21:47,521
Recommendation.

1002
01:21:47,826 --> 01:21:49,293
Senior... - What junior?

1003
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:57,457
Buddy, I love you da.

1004
01:21:58,670 --> 01:21:59,637
She is like my sister.

1005
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:00,799
Go man... go...

1006
01:22:01,006 --> 01:22:03,474
Thank you sister.
Junior, I'll throw a party tonight.

1007
01:22:06,178 --> 01:22:10,808
Very good! You're obeying me.

1008
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:13,484
Go.

1009
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:19,884
Buddy, what is it in his hand?

1010
01:22:20,358 --> 01:22:22,826
He asked for a recommendation letter.
That's why...

1011
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:24,262
Whose recommendation?

1012
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:25,156
From MP

1013
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:26,159
MP?!

1014
01:22:26,364 --> 01:22:28,832
Even a Councillor will recommend only
after taking a bribe,

1015
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:32,003
But an MP's daughter is coming
to you and giving a letter,

1016
01:22:32,204 --> 01:22:35,332
so, what's going on between you?
Tell me...

1017
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:37,504
Hey, open your mouth and tell me...

1018
01:22:37,709 --> 01:22:38,767
If I disclose it,
you will go to town with it!

1019
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,002
Is it an Ad to splash all over the town?

1020
01:22:41,213 --> 01:22:43,340
Tell me buddy... tell me...

1021
01:22:43,548 --> 01:22:44,845
She was pestering me for long...

1022
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:47,008
For the past 2 months...

1023
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:48,579
Wherever I go, she followed me...

1024
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:50,851
If I go to gym, she's there.

1025
01:22:51,556 --> 01:22:54,525
If I go to a mechanic shop, she's there.
- Is it?

1026
01:22:54,726 --> 01:22:56,523
I was buying snacks from a shop.
She followed me to there also.

1027
01:22:56,728 --> 01:22:57,194
Shit!

1028
01:22:57,896 --> 01:22:59,864
4 days back, she was having
handful of tablets.

1029
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:01,365
Vitamin pills?

1030
01:23:02,234 --> 01:23:03,132
Sleeping pills!

1031
01:23:03,835 --> 01:23:04,859
She said that she will die...

1032
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:06,533
How can I allow a girl to
die because of me?

1033
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:09,036
Oh no! Police will catch you.
You shouldn't allow it to happen.

1034
01:23:09,241 --> 01:23:11,539
That's why I gave her permission to love!

1035
01:23:12,344 --> 01:23:15,040
Who? - Me!

1036
01:23:15,247 --> 01:23:18,546
Hey, This morning, I ate a burger
from Nair's shop.

1037
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:24,279
It wasn't good at all.

1038
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:27,049
I'll knock you out man!

1039
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:33,061
PSB Coimbatore vs K.E. C Thiruchi.

1040
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:52,742
Beautiful pass...

1041
01:23:54,286 --> 01:23:55,412
That's Gowtham...

1042
01:23:55,654 --> 01:23:57,588
Star striker of PSB.

1043
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:02,260
That was a marvelous hit...

1044
01:24:03,128 --> 01:24:04,595
Oh! He is rushing fast.

1045
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:06,927
This looks danger.

1046
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,430
PSB College hits a goal.

1047
01:24:14,306 --> 01:24:15,933
They are celebrating their victory.

1048
01:24:16,474 --> 01:24:18,601
Boost must be the secret of their energy.

1049
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,608
What's the use of playing nicely?
- What man?

1050
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:28,382
Then what! Average girls are
cheering the opposing team.

1051
01:24:28,586 --> 01:24:30,781
Look at your girl friend...

1052
01:24:33,425 --> 01:24:34,289
Eating nicely!

1053
01:24:35,327 --> 01:24:37,295
We are all decent guys.

1054
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:54,812
Ishu, look at me.

1055
01:24:58,016 --> 01:24:59,074
Look at me.

1056
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,978
Ishu, look at me.

1057
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,214
Ishu, look at me.

1058
01:25:13,865 --> 01:25:14,661
What happened?

1059
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:33,673
Why are you running as if your wife
has delivered a child?

1060
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:35,011
Hey, stop joking. I'm serious.

1061
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,120
If you go inside,
all of us will become serious.

1062
01:25:37,322 --> 01:25:42,692
There are many honchos inside the room.

1063
01:25:42,894 --> 01:25:49,527
They are planning to ban football
matches in Coimbatore.

1064
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:52,032
If they come to know that you
hit the ball on her face.

1065
01:25:52,237 --> 01:25:54,034
They will... - Stop it man!

1066
01:26:00,578 --> 01:26:01,704
Give way to them.

1067
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:06,882
He is the MP.

1068
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:07,710
Greetings sir.

1069
01:26:10,922 --> 01:26:14,153
I suffered a lot without seeing
her for 2 days.

1070
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:34,173
Sorry. - It's okay.

1071
01:26:35,547 --> 01:26:36,980
That was an accident.

1072
01:26:38,883 --> 01:26:39,907
I did it purposely.

1073
01:27:00,038 --> 01:27:02,768
Ishu, did that rowdy tell you that
he did this purposely?

1074
01:27:05,009 --> 01:27:06,943
Did you tell your father? - No.

1075
01:27:07,645 --> 01:27:09,442
I'll tell this to your father and
teach him a lesson.

1076
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:13,542
Peter, don't make it a big issue.

1077
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:19,953
Buddy, buy Cigarettes. - Shit!

1078
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:22,956
Can't you buy a cigarette?
Why do you live then?

1079
01:27:23,161 --> 01:27:24,958
I don't have money, buddy.
- Sell your Kidney.

1080
01:27:25,163 --> 01:27:27,290
You don't have even Rs.1.50 paise
to buy a cigarette.

1081
01:27:27,499 --> 01:27:30,127
Foryou, it's not wrong to lose a kidney.
- Is it ready?

1082
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,960
Didn't I tell you that I'll go at 5 pm?
Why are you delaying?

1083
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:35,969
You can go at 6.30 pm.

1084
01:27:38,743 --> 01:27:40,540
You scoundrel! I meant the time!

1085
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:42,039
Has aunty left?

1086
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:44,808
Instead of this, you could've loved some girl.

1087
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:47,985
Hey, Love is like itching.

1088
01:27:48,186 --> 01:27:49,653
You feel good as you scratch.

1089
01:27:49,854 --> 01:27:53,255
But you'll get ugly swellings later.

1090
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:53,981
Buddy, look there.

1091
01:27:54,192 --> 01:27:56,387
He's already deep in love trouble.

1092
01:27:56,794 --> 01:27:57,317
Buddy,

1093
01:28:04,302 --> 01:28:06,167
He'll go to toilet after smoking a cigarette.

1094
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,737
After that he'll ask something to eat.

1095
01:28:14,879 --> 01:28:16,506
Senior is eying you.

1096
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:17,738
From now, your chapter is closed.

1097
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,355
I doubt you... - Hey, keep quiet...

1098
01:28:32,397 --> 01:28:34,695
Something is on between you two.

1099
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:37,333
Tell me the truth... tell me...

1100
01:28:37,535 --> 01:28:38,365
Hey, keep quiet...

1101
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:39,628
What are you doing?

1102
01:28:40,171 --> 01:28:43,299
I'm going to spread the news.

1103
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:45,766
I'll definitely tell this to everyone.

1104
01:28:46,177 --> 01:28:50,045
There is something between Senior & Ishu,
I'm going to paint the town red with it.

1105
01:28:58,856 --> 01:29:00,380
Ishu... Hey...

1106
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,534
Sorry...

1107
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:30,145
Are you a rowdy?

1108
01:29:30,355 --> 01:29:32,846
You're behaving indecently with a girl?

1109
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:36,386
We shouldn't spare him.

1110
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:40,653
Go and see that girl...

1111
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:41,593
Sir, lorry...

1112
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:43,096
Look how innocently he looks!

1113
01:29:43,301 --> 01:29:44,268
Why are you still standing here?

1114
01:29:45,403 --> 01:29:46,233
Get lost man!

1115
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:51,769
Get lost, you stupid.

1116
01:29:51,976 --> 01:29:53,170
Slap him.

1117
01:29:53,378 --> 01:29:54,845
What are you looking at?

1118
01:29:59,817 --> 01:30:02,115
Hey, get lost man.

1119
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:06,522
I became zero infront of her.

1120
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:11,694
Her cries were still lingering in my ears!

1121
01:30:12,764 --> 01:30:16,393
My intelligence knew that
there was another road.

1122
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:22,366
But my heart wasn't ready to accept logic.

1123
01:30:23,608 --> 01:30:27,271
How can I face her?

1124
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:41,624
Ishu, did you finish your records?

1125
01:30:43,194 --> 01:30:44,786
Sorry. - It's okay.

1126
01:30:45,663 --> 01:30:47,995
I'm not able to concentrate on my studies.

1127
01:30:57,642 --> 01:30:58,506
Give me a samosa.

1128
01:31:00,545 --> 01:31:01,944
Ishu, one more tea.

1129
01:31:03,648 --> 01:31:04,876
One more tea. - Okay.

1130
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:22,962
I didn't do it purposely...

1131
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:27,067
You didn't see that lorry...

1132
01:31:28,172 --> 01:31:34,771
In fear... I tried to pull you...
but your dress... and it tore...

1133
01:31:37,248 --> 01:31:38,510
I'm a fool!

1134
01:31:40,518 --> 01:31:41,849
I hate myself.

1135
01:31:43,387 --> 01:31:44,911
I'm sure, you will be angry with me.

1136
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:47,554
Yes, I'm angry.

1137
01:31:50,762 --> 01:31:52,286
The body which you should only see.

1138
01:31:54,332 --> 01:31:55,765
Why did you allow others to see it?

1139
01:33:11,409 --> 01:33:12,501
Hey, buddy!

1140
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:15,611
Why are you removing my towel, buddy?

1141
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:17,640
Hey buddy, do you know the news?

1142
01:33:17,982 --> 01:33:20,143
Ishu said 'I love you' to me.

1143
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:23,682
You were saying this standing,
sleeping and

1144
01:33:23,888 --> 01:33:25,947
now you're circling me and saying this,
how can we believe it?

1145
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:28,819
If you don't believe,
see tomorrow's newspaper.

1146
01:33:29,026 --> 01:33:31,859
I'm the happiest man in the world.

1147
01:33:34,098 --> 01:33:37,261
Ishu was part of my life.

1148
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:44,574
She accepts me as for what I am
and I like that very much in her.

1149
01:34:03,895 --> 01:34:06,159
Hey MP's daughter!

1150
01:34:06,464 --> 01:34:08,227
I was searching you all over the place.

1151
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:11,028
Come & sit here.
- But where?

1152
01:34:11,502 --> 01:34:13,436
Just for fun. Let's zoom around.

1153
01:34:13,704 --> 01:34:16,605
Not now. Sometime later, okay?

1154
01:34:17,141 --> 01:34:20,008
I can't find an auspicious hour to
take you out. Come & sit.

1155
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:21,543
Please...

1156
01:34:23,547 --> 01:34:27,745
A lover will love to take his
sweetheart on his bike.

1157
01:34:27,952 --> 01:34:29,146
I also love to do that.

1158
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:32,015
Stop asking for reasons!
Stop playing & come.

1159
01:34:32,223 --> 01:34:34,487
Let's be different.

1160
01:34:34,992 --> 01:34:36,152
Not necessary...

1161
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:39,555
Ishu, I'll leave.

1162
01:34:39,764 --> 01:34:42,232
I will meet you in the evening.
- Stop. I'll also come with you.

1163
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,660
Let's meet in the college tomorrow.

1164
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:45,028
Where are you going?

1165
01:34:45,236 --> 01:34:47,727
Gowtham, everyone is looking at us.
Leave my hand.

1166
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:49,998
I don't care. You're my wife.

1167
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:52,175
Let it happen first.
Now, leave me.

1168
01:34:53,611 --> 01:34:54,373
You go.

1169
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:11,552
Gowtham... please...

1170
01:36:13,257 --> 01:36:15,248
I'm scared of you Gowtham.

1171
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:17,153
Why are you so wild?

1172
01:36:17,628 --> 01:36:18,822
You're the reason.

1173
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:20,998
Gowtham, please don't say that.

1174
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:23,166
Many people in the city know me very well.

1175
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:26,564
If anyone tell this to my father.

1176
01:36:28,072 --> 01:36:31,906
Gowtham, I want to live with you all my life.

1177
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:35,235
Try to understand.

1178
01:36:48,893 --> 01:36:50,417
Wow!

1179
01:36:50,628 --> 01:36:53,028
Don't leave her. Keep kissing.

1180
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:54,788
You call this a kiss!

1181
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:56,364
When are we going to taste such a kiss?

1182
01:36:56,567 --> 01:37:00,367
I think we may not.
Go & romance in the phone.

1183
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:03,032
He was sleeping...

1184
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:14,551
Hello... - Hi! What are you doing?

1185
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,516
Gowtham... one sec...

1186
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:22,291
Why did you call me now?

1187
01:37:23,294 --> 01:37:25,558
You are my wife.
I will call you at anytime.

1188
01:37:25,763 --> 01:37:29,756
O Yes! Tell me.

1189
01:37:29,967 --> 01:37:31,161
I want a kiss. It's urgent.

1190
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:37,039
What was that!?
This isn't enough.

1191
01:37:43,147 --> 01:37:45,240
What was that?

1192
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:46,279
Hello...

1193
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:48,309
Hello... - Mother.

1194
01:37:48,919 --> 01:37:53,583
Hello... - One sec...

1195
01:38:22,353 --> 01:38:23,149
Now tell me.

1196
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:25,679
Are you ready now?

1197
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:28,220
I asked you for a kiss, didn't I?
- I gave you, didn't I?

1198
01:38:28,592 --> 01:38:31,686
What you gave me was a kiss!

1199
01:38:32,663 --> 01:38:36,622
I need it in person. Lip to lip.

1200
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:38,597
That's possible only after marriage.

1201
01:38:39,136 --> 01:38:43,800
I didn't ask for a baby.
Just a kiss.

1202
01:38:44,108 --> 01:38:45,132
I will give you.

1203
01:38:45,409 --> 01:38:49,903
You say this always.
- Okay. Listen to me.

1204
01:38:50,214 --> 01:38:53,342
Get me a mobile & a sim card immediately.

1205
01:38:53,784 --> 01:38:54,648
What for?

1206
01:38:55,219 --> 01:38:59,087
My mother is suspecting me.

1207
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:04,091
If she complains to my father,
we're finished.

1208
01:39:05,162 --> 01:39:06,629
They will take my mobile.

1209
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:08,821
And all the phone lines at
home will get snapped.

1210
01:39:09,033 --> 01:39:10,500
How will I contact you then?

1211
01:39:10,701 --> 01:39:11,326
You're right.

1212
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:13,066
So, we need a secret number, don't we?

1213
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:17,806
Only now you're talking like
a politician's daughter.

1214
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:20,567
Ishu...

1215
01:39:20,811 --> 01:39:21,470
You're finished.

1216
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,874
One sec... what's it mother?

1217
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:26,447
Why are you taking so long?
Come fast.

1218
01:39:26,951 --> 01:39:29,283
I'm coming.

1219
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:34,023
Hold on. - Okay.

1220
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:36,658
Come fast.

1221
01:39:37,061 --> 01:39:40,030
Is this the only bathroom in this house?

1222
01:39:40,231 --> 01:39:42,324
You don't know my emergency.

1223
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:44,699
Escaped.

1224
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:49,501
Hello shorty! Talk...

1225
01:39:50,174 --> 01:39:52,836
When in college, you speak nothing.

1226
01:39:53,811 --> 01:39:55,608
Hello... what are you doing there?

1227
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,270
Hello... - Yes tell me.

1228
01:39:58,482 --> 01:40:00,712
Tell you what?

1229
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:01,875
Yes tell me.

1230
01:40:02,086 --> 01:40:03,815
I'm in a... mood.

1231
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:06,216
Don't move around.
The signal is getting low.

1232
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:10,351
Ishu, my lips have gone dry.

1233
01:40:11,228 --> 01:40:13,287
My tongue has gone dry.

1234
01:40:14,665 --> 01:40:19,125
If you could spare me your
lips for sometime,

1235
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:20,559
I will live.

1236
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:22,567
What do you say?

1237
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:24,172
Sounds good.

1238
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,175
After marriage, I'm all yours.

1239
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:29,938
Do whateveryou want to do with me.

1240
01:40:30,281 --> 01:40:32,681
For now, be patient. Okay?

1241
01:40:33,684 --> 01:40:37,745
Till then, even if you try to seduce me.

1242
01:40:37,955 --> 01:40:39,217
What then?

1243
01:41:20,064 --> 01:41:22,089
What are you doing at this late hour?
Go & sleep.

1244
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:29,529
Okay.

1245
01:41:32,843 --> 01:41:33,502
Shit!

1246
01:41:42,019 --> 01:41:42,951
How did he come here?

1247
01:41:43,787 --> 01:41:44,754
How did he go away?

1248
01:41:52,096 --> 01:41:52,755
Sleeping...

1249
01:42:57,928 --> 01:43:01,056
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1250
01:43:01,265 --> 01:43:04,462
<i># Come. You're my mind, body & soul! #</i>

1251
01:43:04,668 --> 01:43:07,899
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1252
01:43:08,105 --> 01:43:12,064
<i># Let's blossom as flowers
in the garden of love. #</i>

1253
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:18,875
<i># I asked my heart "Who am I?" #</i>

1254
01:43:19,082 --> 01:43:25,078
<i># It replied that I'm yours. #</i>

1255
01:43:25,289 --> 01:43:28,281
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1256
01:43:28,492 --> 01:43:31,655
<i># Come. You're my mind, body & soul! #</i>

1257
01:43:31,862 --> 01:43:35,229
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1258
01:43:35,432 --> 01:43:39,892
<i># Let's blossom as flowers
in the garden of love. #</i>

1259
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:21,337
<i># You adore me with flowers. #</i>

1260
01:44:21,545 --> 01:44:24,810
<i># You adorned a flower with flowers. #</i>

1261
01:44:25,015 --> 01:44:31,682
<i># You sparked a fire in the flower. #</i>

1262
01:44:31,889 --> 01:44:38,453
<i># When you dance in the rain, I go dry. #</i>

1263
01:44:38,662 --> 01:44:45,864
<i># You flow in my veins & you are
my heart beat, O my love! #</i>

1264
01:44:46,069 --> 01:44:56,843
<i># I stood alone like a statue. #</i>

1265
01:44:57,047 --> 01:45:02,007
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1266
01:45:02,286 --> 01:45:06,154
<i># Come. You're my mind, body & soul! #</i>

1267
01:45:06,356 --> 01:45:12,886
<i># I asked my heart "Who am I?" #</i>

1268
01:45:13,096 --> 01:45:19,899
<i># I asked my heart "Who am I?" #</i>

1269
01:45:20,103 --> 01:45:23,368
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1270
01:45:23,674 --> 01:45:28,839
<i># Let's blossom as flowers in
the garden of love. #</i>

1271
01:45:54,171 --> 01:46:00,167
<i># Shall we hire the moon
for us to live in it? #</i>

1272
01:46:00,377 --> 01:46:07,408
<i># Will it be nice if strangers
get into our house? #</i>

1273
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:13,648
<i># How could you let bees build
a hive on your bosom? #</i>

1274
01:46:13,857 --> 01:46:20,922
<i># Will it be nice if someone takes shelter
in the place reserved for me? #</i>

1275
01:46:21,131 --> 01:46:33,839
<i># We are united like water and earth. #</i>

1276
01:46:34,044 --> 01:46:37,411
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1277
01:46:37,614 --> 01:46:40,640
<i># Come. You're my mind, body & soul! #</i>

1278
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:44,082
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1279
01:46:44,287 --> 01:46:48,246
<i># Let's blossom as flowers in
the garden of love. #</i>

1280
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:55,227
<i># I asked my heart "Who am I?" #</i>

1281
01:46:55,432 --> 01:47:01,166
<i># It replied that I'm yours. #</i>

1282
01:47:01,371 --> 01:47:05,330
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1283
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:08,978
<i># Come. You're my mind, body & soul! #</i>

1284
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:12,205
<i># Come infront of me, O my darling! #</i>

1285
01:47:12,416 --> 01:47:17,979
<i># Let's blossom as flowers in
the garden of love. #</i>

1286
01:48:11,575 --> 01:48:12,872
Ishu...

1287
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:14,938
You carry on.

1288
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:18,945
Dressed in silk sari,

1289
01:48:19,149 --> 01:48:20,138
...jasmine,

1290
01:48:21,084 --> 01:48:23,018
you look pretty awesome.

1291
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,751
Do I look a groom?

1292
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:35,296
Looks like the bride isn't so happy?

1293
01:48:36,466 --> 01:48:37,330
I'm happy.

1294
01:48:40,704 --> 01:48:42,535
I know, dear.
What's the matter?

1295
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:45,500
Tell me.

1296
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:50,610
Have we taken the right decision?

1297
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,444
I didn't take this decision on my own.

1298
01:48:58,955 --> 01:49:00,013
Tell me if you are not interested.

1299
01:49:00,824 --> 01:49:02,052
I'll stop everything.

1300
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:09,592
Your wish is mine.

1301
01:49:10,867 --> 01:49:12,232
From the moment I fell in love with you,

1302
01:49:13,103 --> 01:49:20,373
I've been living with you.

1303
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:26,911
Now I'm just going to sign.

1304
01:49:36,426 --> 01:49:39,156
Who are they?
Going with a harmonium box?

1305
01:49:39,362 --> 01:49:40,659
He is the Registrar.

1306
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:50,171
She is an MP's daughter.

1307
01:49:53,443 --> 01:49:56,378
The boy's name is Gowtham,
and the girl's name is Ishwarya.

1308
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,672
We can finish the formalities.

1309
01:49:57,881 --> 01:49:59,405
Are you college students?

1310
01:49:59,616 --> 01:50:02,779
I told you not to go to him with
your bald head. He's suspecting us now.

1311
01:50:02,986 --> 01:50:05,045
Getting married before
completing your studies?

1312
01:50:05,255 --> 01:50:07,416
If they have to marry after graduation,

1313
01:50:07,624 --> 01:50:12,118
it would take more than 40 years
to clear all the arrears.

1314
01:50:12,329 --> 01:50:16,425
You're very young. It's inauspicious time.
Wait for another hour.

1315
01:50:16,733 --> 01:50:20,191
I don't believe in that. Get it ready.
- Just 1 hour please.

1316
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:24,799
Okay. We'll wait.

1317
01:50:25,008 --> 01:50:26,942
He has started dancing
to her tunes. Come.

1318
01:50:31,748 --> 01:50:33,909
Is it tea beans?
- No, it is a filter.

1319
01:50:34,117 --> 01:50:35,948
Why is your face like that?

1320
01:50:36,152 --> 01:50:38,211
Only coffee has beans, right?

1321
01:50:39,322 --> 01:50:40,118
Get us tea first.

1322
01:50:40,523 --> 01:50:42,616
Give it. How long will you
take to make tea?

1323
01:50:42,993 --> 01:50:44,893
Tea is free. Drink.

1324
01:50:45,328 --> 01:50:46,488
How is the atmosphere?

1325
01:50:47,664 --> 01:50:49,962
Give it to Geetha first.

1326
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,928
Careful. It's hot.

1327
01:50:54,604 --> 01:50:58,563
It's not God's offerings, Ishu.

1328
01:50:58,775 --> 01:50:59,833
Don't drink like that.

1329
01:51:00,043 --> 01:51:01,135
Take it.

1330
01:51:01,344 --> 01:51:02,641
Shake it.

1331
01:51:02,846 --> 01:51:04,473
Place your hand on it.

1332
01:51:04,681 --> 01:51:06,615
And just drink it in one go.

1333
01:51:06,816 --> 01:51:09,717
If you try to taste it, you'll throw up.

1334
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:15,688
Tea at home will be strong.
But here, we will go dizzy.

1335
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,492
If you don't like it. Don't drink.

1336
01:51:20,163 --> 01:51:21,187
Would you like to eat anything else?

1337
01:51:21,398 --> 01:51:21,887
Vadai?

1338
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,058
Get us medhu vadai.

1339
01:51:25,268 --> 01:51:27,964
Medhu Vadai please.
- Medhu Vadai?

1340
01:51:31,675 --> 01:51:32,733
What is he doing?

1341
01:51:32,943 --> 01:51:35,207
Wait. He has started to search only now.

1342
01:51:35,412 --> 01:51:36,936
He will pluck it out from there.

1343
01:51:37,147 --> 01:51:38,114
Hey, take your hands off, man.

1344
01:51:38,315 --> 01:51:40,283
I think he will make us throw up.

1345
01:51:40,483 --> 01:51:42,451
She once hesitated to get on his bike.

1346
01:51:42,752 --> 01:51:44,617
But today, she has come
to the Registrar's office.

1347
01:51:44,821 --> 01:51:46,948
It's all because of love.
Am I right, Ishu?

1348
01:51:47,357 --> 01:51:50,884
I've been thinking about getting
married in a Registrar's office.

1349
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:54,862
Don't be in a hurry.
Better inquire with the Registrar.

1350
01:51:55,065 --> 01:51:57,693
Usually they don't perform
marriages for people above 60.

1351
01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:05,832
Have you ever fallen in love?
- Yes. But only I love.

1352
01:52:06,042 --> 01:52:07,737
She is like an angel.

1353
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:10,979
She has left everything behind
and has come with you.

1354
01:52:11,648 --> 01:52:16,312
At any point in life, she must not regret
for taking this decision.

1355
01:52:20,623 --> 01:52:22,454
What are you going to tell your uncle?

1356
01:52:24,627 --> 01:52:25,389
No.

1357
01:52:25,996 --> 01:52:28,260
Even my parents wouldn't have
given me so much freedom.

1358
01:52:29,132 --> 01:52:31,657
From my childhood,
he fulfilled all my desires.

1359
01:52:32,635 --> 01:52:35,900
He wanted to conduct my marriage grandly.

1360
01:52:39,009 --> 01:52:40,442
We'll go to him after marriage.

1361
01:52:42,012 --> 01:52:43,445
I believe everything will be fine.

1362
01:52:45,982 --> 01:52:47,381
Has your inauspicious hour over?

1363
01:52:50,253 --> 01:52:53,814
Wait for another 10 minutes.
- Why? Should the MP come here?

1364
01:52:54,824 --> 01:53:01,559
If you are so clever,
how clever should we be?

1365
01:53:01,765 --> 01:53:04,131
I will do the formality of signing
afteryour MP comes here.

1366
01:53:04,334 --> 01:53:06,495
And now, we'll get married
in the traditional way.

1367
01:53:06,703 --> 01:53:09,331
Senior, bring the garlands.
- The garlands are ready. Take them.

1368
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:10,130
Take it.

1369
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,968
You adorn me with flowers.

1370
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:16,474
You adorned a flower with flowers.

1371
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:19,944
You sparked a fire in the flower.

1372
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:21,777
Junior, give the auspicious
thread to the groom.

1373
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:30,050
When you dance in the rain, I go dry.

1374
01:53:30,393 --> 01:53:32,657
You flow in my veins & you are
my heart beat, O my love!

1375
01:53:32,862 --> 01:53:34,853
He wants to put all the knots.

1376
01:53:37,567 --> 01:53:38,659
Friend...

1377
01:53:38,868 --> 01:53:39,698
One.

1378
01:53:42,372 --> 01:53:43,498
Two.

1379
01:53:46,042 --> 01:53:47,031
Three.

1380
01:53:48,078 --> 01:53:49,409
Happy married life.

1381
01:53:49,813 --> 01:53:50,677
Ishwarya...

1382
01:53:55,452 --> 01:53:58,546
You back stabbed me, you...

1383
01:53:59,522 --> 01:54:02,355
Kill everyone.

1384
01:54:05,095 --> 01:54:07,290
Father, tell them not to beat him.

1385
01:54:14,237 --> 01:54:16,296
Please father.

1386
01:54:16,673 --> 01:54:19,870
Father, don't beat him...

1387
01:54:35,525 --> 01:54:38,255
Kill him.

1388
01:54:51,841 --> 01:54:54,469
Please father.

1389
01:55:06,289 --> 01:55:07,551
Leave him...

1390
01:55:08,658 --> 01:55:17,259
Tell them to leave him.

1391
01:56:10,887 --> 01:56:13,412
Come home. I will kill you.

1392
01:58:26,656 --> 01:58:29,887
I thought my life was with Ishu...

1393
01:58:30,827 --> 01:58:36,788
...but I didn't expect time will put
an harsh end to it so quickly.

1394
01:58:43,373 --> 01:58:50,506
Don't strain yourself...
nothing... please sleep.

1395
01:59:05,228 --> 01:59:07,924
Have it... have water.

1396
01:59:22,745 --> 01:59:25,873
I wasn't just in love with Ishu,

1397
01:59:27,016 --> 01:59:32,215
beyond that I felt she was
a part of my life.

1398
01:59:33,756 --> 01:59:35,553
I don't want to live all
the my life with her,

1399
01:59:36,125 --> 01:59:37,217
just one day,

1400
01:59:38,127 --> 01:59:39,560
if I had lived with her,

1401
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:42,398
I would've been content like
living with her for an eon.

1402
01:59:43,933 --> 01:59:46,231
But I wasn't lucky for that.

1403
01:59:59,682 --> 02:00:03,743
Buddy! - What happened?
- We searched everywhere for her.

1404
02:00:04,454 --> 02:00:06,581
But nobody knows her whereabouts.

1405
02:00:14,697 --> 02:00:18,258
What are you doing?
- Hey listen to me.

1406
02:00:19,302 --> 02:00:19,768
Buddy.

1407
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:22,938
Listen... be careful.

1408
02:00:23,139 --> 02:00:28,270
No... he's still angry on us.
- Listen to me.

1409
02:00:28,978 --> 02:00:33,677
Please listen to us for God's sake.
- We can see after few days.

1410
02:00:33,883 --> 02:00:34,941
When? -Won't you listen to me?

1411
02:00:35,151 --> 02:00:35,947
Son!

1412
02:00:36,819 --> 02:00:39,617
What's that noise?! - Come fast.

1413
02:00:44,727 --> 02:00:47,628
Can't you get down carefully?
He fell suddenly.

1414
02:00:49,265 --> 02:00:51,790
Go... go... call the doctor.
Come fast... - Be careful.

1415
02:01:00,743 --> 02:01:04,474
People say man proposes God disposes.

1416
02:01:05,448 --> 02:01:09,475
God refused my wish but
fulfilled my uncle's wish.

1417
02:01:15,925 --> 02:01:21,158
He's not a human one who refuses
the last wish of a dying man.

1418
02:01:21,931 --> 02:01:24,661
I wanted to be humane.

1419
02:01:26,202 --> 02:01:31,504
I decided to marry Kundavi. He died.

1420
02:01:32,708 --> 02:01:36,166
'Sundarakandam' comes only
once in epic 'Ramayana'.

1421
02:01:37,213 --> 02:01:40,011
Is my life any exception?

1422
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:52,747
My darling... my dearest one...

1423
02:02:53,122 --> 02:02:53,850
Where's your mother?

1424
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:55,084
Mother...

1425
02:02:56,125 --> 02:02:57,422
Is it? Come.

1426
02:03:06,636 --> 02:03:09,605
Hey Dear! How's your health now?

1427
02:03:10,473 --> 02:03:12,600
She's fine, just over acting dad.

1428
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:16,709
Shall we go out?

1429
02:03:17,647 --> 02:03:18,443
Let's go.

1430
02:03:18,648 --> 02:03:21,446
Okay, I've 3 hours work,
we'll have lunch & dinner out.

1431
02:03:21,651 --> 02:03:25,280
After an outing,
let's do it at home. Okay?

1432
02:03:26,088 --> 02:03:28,716
Dad, I and my Maths teacher
had a fight.

1433
02:03:28,991 --> 02:03:29,958
Dad...

1434
02:03:30,259 --> 02:03:30,953
Dad.

1435
02:03:32,428 --> 02:03:33,292
Yeah... yes sir.

1436
02:03:34,163 --> 02:03:35,130
I just came.

1437
02:03:35,898 --> 02:03:37,957
Okay... within half an hour.

1438
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:39,297
Alright... yeah.

1439
02:03:39,669 --> 02:03:40,863
Gowtham... success.

1440
02:03:41,237 --> 02:03:42,465
GM is waiting, I'll just get back to you.

1441
02:03:42,672 --> 02:03:45,300
I'm very happy with you.
- Thank you, I'll catch you later.

1442
02:03:50,513 --> 02:03:53,073
Hey Rohit... be careful.

1443
02:03:56,085 --> 02:03:57,643
Sorry... sorry...

1444
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:00,484
Where's your mother?

1445
02:04:01,123 --> 02:04:01,885
No.

1446
02:04:04,026 --> 02:04:10,329
Come to me dear... come to me...
Okay... let's call your mother.

1447
02:04:10,533 --> 02:04:13,331
Mummy, you're late.

1448
02:04:29,051 --> 02:04:30,177
Hello... hey...

1449
02:04:30,619 --> 02:04:32,678
Hello Gowtham, Neha here.

1450
02:04:33,222 --> 02:04:33,847
Oh! Hi!

1451
02:04:35,224 --> 02:04:36,691
Kundavi is busy in a meeting.

1452
02:04:37,226 --> 02:04:38,693
Any important message.

1453
02:04:39,061 --> 02:04:41,359
No, just tell her I had called.

1454
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:44,029
Okay, I'll pass the message. Bye.

1455
02:05:53,803 --> 02:05:54,770
When did you come last night?

1456
02:05:55,037 --> 02:05:55,833
At 1 am.

1457
02:05:59,141 --> 02:06:00,199
Leaving so early?

1458
02:06:01,243 --> 02:06:02,540
I've lot of work in office.

1459
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:08,617
Any problem?

1460
02:06:08,984 --> 02:06:11,282
No problem, client meeting in Lokhandwala,

1461
02:06:11,487 --> 02:06:14,115
we must fix the locations,
madam is waiting there for me.

1462
02:06:16,826 --> 02:06:17,793
Send Ishu to school.

1463
02:06:21,163 --> 02:06:21,959
Hey Dear, wait.

1464
02:06:30,339 --> 02:06:31,966
When will you learn to dress well?

1465
02:06:34,276 --> 02:06:38,076
Everything will be alright. Go.

1466
02:06:46,689 --> 02:06:50,250
I'll definitely come, don't worry. Bye.

1467
02:06:55,531 --> 02:06:56,930
Oh God!

1468
02:06:57,466 --> 02:06:59,400
Gowtham, I'm Nimmi.

1469
02:06:59,869 --> 02:07:00,665
I'm Nirmala.

1470
02:07:02,204 --> 02:07:03,262
Sorry... sorry madam.

1471
02:07:03,472 --> 02:07:05,667
Even if it's kiss, so unabashedly.

1472
02:07:07,643 --> 02:07:09,270
Don't know how Kundavi is bearing with you?

1473
02:07:09,979 --> 02:07:11,844
Anyway if you're happy.
That's enough.

1474
02:07:12,381 --> 02:07:14,508
You didn't allow us to be happy. -Why?

1475
02:07:14,717 --> 02:07:16,514
It's ten days since I returned from US,

1476
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,186
didn't even see her face to speak also,

1477
02:07:18,387 --> 02:07:19,354
you kept her so busy.

1478
02:07:19,722 --> 02:07:20,188
Me?

1479
02:07:21,223 --> 02:07:22,747
She doesn't have any work in this office,

1480
02:07:23,058 --> 02:07:25,026
she takes on herself to do other's jobs.

1481
02:07:25,394 --> 02:07:26,361
She used to leave at the strike of 5,

1482
02:07:26,562 --> 02:07:29,030
now she's refusing to leave
even on my orders.

1483
02:07:29,398 --> 02:07:30,194
Is it madam?

1484
02:07:30,833 --> 02:07:33,700
Doesn't she have any work there?

1485
02:07:33,903 --> 02:07:35,871
Gowtham... any problem?

1486
02:07:36,171 --> 02:07:38,833
Madam... no... no... I'm okay.

1487
02:07:40,409 --> 02:07:42,707
Okay, call me if you have anything. Okay?

1488
02:07:43,012 --> 02:07:43,706
Yeah... okay.

1489
02:07:43,913 --> 02:07:45,210
Bye. - Bye.

1490
02:07:48,417 --> 02:07:50,214
Stop those calls and eat.

1491
02:07:51,086 --> 02:07:53,213
Always talking on phone in lunch time.

1492
02:08:30,793 --> 02:08:31,487
Mother.

1493
02:08:33,062 --> 02:08:34,757
Mother, give me the disc.

1494
02:08:35,064 --> 02:08:35,758
I'll give later.

1495
02:08:37,533 --> 02:08:38,591
I need now.

1496
02:08:38,968 --> 02:08:41,368
I want it right now. - Move aside Ishu.

1497
02:08:58,554 --> 02:08:59,612
Sorry dear.

1498
02:08:59,888 --> 02:09:00,946
I don't want.

1499
02:09:01,323 --> 02:09:03,951
I said sorry, didn't I?

1500
02:09:06,495 --> 02:09:07,621
Take it and play.

1501
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,129
Are you changing only channels?

1502
02:09:23,178 --> 02:09:24,543
Will your father tell lies?

1503
02:09:24,747 --> 02:09:27,147
Dad never lies, you tell lies.

1504
02:09:28,684 --> 02:09:29,309
Me?

1505
02:09:31,787 --> 02:09:34,153
You lie you've work in office.

1506
02:09:37,526 --> 02:09:38,322
You know it.

1507
02:09:43,532 --> 02:09:45,159
Does your father really love me?

1508
02:09:45,367 --> 02:09:46,493
Shall I ask dad?

1509
02:09:49,705 --> 02:09:52,833
Like all men he'll also lie.

1510
02:09:53,208 --> 02:09:54,232
Dad.

1511
02:09:55,978 --> 02:09:56,945
I've a doubt.

1512
02:09:58,147 --> 02:09:59,171
What is it dear?

1513
02:09:59,815 --> 02:10:02,283
How much you love my mother?

1514
02:10:05,821 --> 02:10:08,517
Is it your doubt oryour mom's doubt?

1515
02:10:08,824 --> 02:10:11,349
Mother's doubt is do you really love her?

1516
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:14,461
My doubt is how much you love her?

1517
02:10:18,067 --> 02:10:18,931
Come dear.

1518
02:10:20,836 --> 02:10:21,359
Come.

1519
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:37,284
I've stopped writing diary 6 years ago.

1520
02:10:37,653 --> 02:10:39,484
I felt like writing after staying
away from your mother.

1521
02:10:39,755 --> 02:10:41,723
If she has time ask her to read it.

1522
02:10:45,427 --> 02:10:46,724
What has dad written in it?

1523
02:10:50,099 --> 02:10:52,226
New York city is sleeping.

1524
02:10:52,634 --> 02:10:53,896
Loneliness was growing.

1525
02:10:54,103 --> 02:10:55,570
Mist was enveloping.

1526
02:11:05,948 --> 02:11:09,679
<i># New York city was sleeping. #</i>

1527
02:11:09,885 --> 02:11:11,853

1530
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:31,271

in a glass cage. #</i>

1531
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:38,102

1532
02:12:06,675 --> 02:12:10,133

<i># Moon didn't kiss and offer me

1541
02:13:26,355 --> 02:13:33,318
<i># She's not here to blow out
a speck falling into my eyes. #</i>

1542
02:13:33,996 --> 02:13:40,902
<i># Why aren't you here with me
to calm my ruffled mind? #</i>

1543
02:13:41,103 --> 02:13:44,300
<i># I'm here and you are there. #</i>

1544
02:13:44,506 --> 02:13:49,409

are like years for me. #</i>

1545
02:13:52,614 --> 02:13:55,583

1546
02:13:55,784 --> 02:14:01,586

02:14:47,569 --> 02:14:54,634
<i># My pen writes imposition
of your name in my diary. #</i>

1551
02:14:55,110 --> 02:15:03,484
<i># My pen acquires sweetness
with ants swarming it. #</i>

1552
02:15:06,254 --> 02:15:09,314
<i># Though it's chill out here. #</i>

1553
02:15:09,524 --> 02:15:14,985
<i># Why this chilly winter has turned
into summer this moment? #</i>

1554
02:15:17,532 --> 02:15:20,763
<i># If you come my dear. #</i>

1555
02:15:20,969 --> 02:15:25,668
<i># Even hot lava
will frost into ice. #</i>

1556
02:15:29,544 --> 02:15:32,513
<i># New York city was sleeping. #</i>

1557
02:15:32,714 --> 02:15:34,841
<i># Loneliness was growing. #</i>

1558
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:38,519
<i># Mist was enveloping. #</i>

1559
02:15:39,388 --> 02:15:45,850
<i># Boarding down from ships.
Wind is walking on land. #</i>

1560
02:15:47,896 --> 02:15:54,358
<i># I'm crying locked up
in a glass cage. #</i>

1561
02:15:54,569 --> 02:16:01,873
<i># Loneliness surrounding me. #</i>

1562
02:16:02,077 --> 02:16:05,877
<i># It's a torture. #</i>

1563
02:16:20,028 --> 02:16:23,225
I'm sorry Gowtham. Sorry.

1564
02:16:26,935 --> 02:16:28,664
I know you're angry on me.

1565
02:16:30,038 --> 02:16:33,132
I didn't want to ask and hurt you.

1566
02:16:34,843 --> 02:16:40,406
Whatever it may be,
don't stay away from me. Please.

1567
02:16:44,786 --> 02:16:45,844
I'm sorry Gowtham.

1568
02:16:48,056 --> 02:16:49,648
I'll never do like this in future.

1569
02:16:51,526 --> 02:16:52,857
Okay? Okay.

1570
02:16:54,629 --> 02:16:55,095
Okay.

1571
02:16:58,133 --> 02:17:00,601
Kovai.

1572
02:17:27,162 --> 02:17:27,787
Greetings. - Greetings.

1573
02:17:27,996 --> 02:17:28,690
Please take your seat.

1574
02:17:30,932 --> 02:17:33,025
Are you Ishwarya's friend? -Yes.

1575
02:17:34,102 --> 02:17:35,899
What would you like to have?
Coffee or Buttermilk?

1576
02:17:36,838 --> 02:17:37,805
Anything is okay.

1577
02:17:42,344 --> 02:17:44,312
Muruga, send two buttermilk to my cabin.

1578
02:17:49,351 --> 02:17:50,477
How many children you've?

1579
02:17:52,687 --> 02:17:53,483
One girl.

1580
02:17:55,357 --> 02:17:56,915
Tell me, what do you want from me?

1581
02:17:58,527 --> 02:17:59,585
I want to meet Ishwarya.

1582
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:02,724
You've come at the right time.

1583
02:18:03,198 --> 02:18:06,167
She's coming from Australia tomorrow
to see her ailing mother

1584
02:18:14,042 --> 02:18:14,838
Look there!

1585
02:18:15,143 --> 02:18:21,844
Dear... Ishu... give the bag I'll carry.

1586
02:18:23,318 --> 02:18:26,344
I know what I did was wrong,
but not talking to me is too much.

1587
02:18:26,555 --> 02:18:29,524
Come, let's go in our car.

1588
02:18:30,125 --> 02:18:35,188
Dear, I accept my mistake,
you haven't talked to me for 6 years,

1589
02:18:35,397 --> 02:18:38,195
that punishment is enough,
listen to me. - Driver, go.

1590
02:19:23,278 --> 02:19:26,907
I'm Kundavi, Gowtham's wife.

1591
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:30,017
Who am I then?

1592
02:20:19,768 --> 02:20:20,564
Thank you.

1593
02:20:58,139 --> 02:21:00,107
What are you doing honey?
Door bell is ringing.

1594
02:21:02,143 --> 02:21:03,110
What is she doing?

1595
02:21:05,714 --> 02:21:06,612
What are you doing inside?

1596
02:21:17,325 --> 02:21:18,292
Hi Gowtham.

1597
02:21:29,504 --> 02:21:30,801
Won't you let me in?

1598
02:21:35,176 --> 02:21:36,473
Come.

1599
02:21:48,022 --> 02:21:48,488
Please sit.

1600
02:21:59,534 --> 02:22:01,001
How are you Gowtham?

1601
02:22:04,706 --> 02:22:05,502
Fine.

1602
02:22:14,382 --> 02:22:15,349
How are you doing?

1603
02:22:16,885 --> 02:22:17,681
Good.

1604
02:22:31,766 --> 02:22:35,224
You... you...

1605
02:22:37,739 --> 02:22:38,671
One sec.

1606
02:23:10,271 --> 02:23:11,738
Leave it, I'll clear it.

1607
02:23:22,784 --> 02:23:34,093
Someone's here to meet me... my friend.

1608
02:23:42,971 --> 02:23:43,938
I invited her.

1609
02:23:45,673 --> 02:23:46,264
Why?

1610
02:23:46,541 --> 02:23:48,441
Because I love you.

1611
02:23:53,982 --> 02:23:55,779
I love you.

1612
02:23:59,821 --> 02:24:04,622
A day lived with her would've been
like a life living together with her.

1613
02:24:05,326 --> 02:24:06,793
But I was unlucky.

1614
02:24:07,896 --> 02:24:10,126
You wrote this with tears.

1615
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,628
How painful you would've
been through to write this?

1616
02:24:24,345 --> 02:24:26,313
I didn't just love you,

1617
02:24:27,515 --> 02:24:30,973
I love your dream, your desires,

1618
02:24:31,352 --> 02:24:36,153
your feelings, I love everything.

1619
02:24:37,525 --> 02:24:39,152
I want you too.

1620
02:24:43,865 --> 02:24:45,162
I want you totally.

1621
02:24:51,205 --> 02:24:58,839
Today your Ishu...

1622
02:25:08,056 --> 02:25:11,685
Today your Ishu is here foryou.

1623
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:21,358
For today, I and our daughter
are non-existent.

1624
02:25:22,971 --> 02:25:23,869
What are you saying?

1625
02:25:26,741 --> 02:25:28,709
Even after spending all
our life happily together,

1626
02:25:29,243 --> 02:25:32,872
if you feel atleast for a moment feel
this didn't happen in your life,

1627
02:25:33,081 --> 02:25:37,211
my life with you will
become meaningless.

1628
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,544
No.

1629
02:25:41,456 --> 02:25:43,219
No guilty conscious.

1630
02:26:00,608 --> 02:26:01,734
Where to mother?

1631
02:26:10,284 --> 02:26:11,080
Hi Kundavi.

1632
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:12,911
Hi little Ishu.

1633
02:26:14,622 --> 02:26:15,748
I got a gift foryou.

1634
02:26:18,626 --> 02:26:19,752
Hope you like it.

1635
02:26:22,964 --> 02:26:23,760
Say thank you.

1636
02:26:23,965 --> 02:26:24,932
Thank you.

1637
02:26:25,133 --> 02:26:25,758
You like it?

1638
02:26:26,968 --> 02:26:28,265
It's just like you.

1639
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:29,595
Thank you.

1640
02:26:29,804 --> 02:26:31,271
What's wrong with her?

1641
02:26:31,639 --> 02:26:34,107
She's not well, running fever.

1642
02:26:34,375 --> 02:26:35,433
I've to take her to the hospital.

1643
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,607
Okay, I'm leaving.

1644
02:27:08,076 --> 02:27:09,976
I don't know what you've done
before coming here?

1645
02:27:10,178 --> 02:27:13,147
But I can guess you've done
something really wrong.

1646
02:27:20,188 --> 02:27:23,487
Ishu is not well,
did you take her to a doctor?

1647
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:27,327
What happened to you?

1648
02:27:27,528 --> 02:27:28,825
Why are you like this?

1649
02:27:30,698 --> 02:27:32,825
Any problem with Gowtham?

1650
02:27:33,101 --> 02:27:35,501
Oh No! Nothing like that.

1651
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:38,500
Okay, you take rest.

1652
02:27:39,907 --> 02:27:42,671
I'll take Ishu to a doctor.

1653
02:27:47,882 --> 02:27:49,509
We both will go to a doctor.

1654
02:27:51,219 --> 02:27:52,345
Tomorrow is Deepavali, right?

1655
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:55,848
On the way back,
I'll buy crackers foryou.

1656
02:27:56,057 --> 02:27:57,024
Okay?

1657
02:27:58,126 --> 02:27:59,024
Come... come.

1658
02:28:00,895 --> 02:28:02,192
Good.

1659
02:28:05,566 --> 02:28:07,033
Aren't you coming mom?

1660
02:28:07,235 --> 02:28:09,203
Let your mom take rest, let's go.

1661
02:28:11,572 --> 02:28:15,372
Mam, I want to sleep for a while.

1662
02:28:16,410 --> 02:28:18,207
I want to forget everything.

1663
02:28:18,913 --> 02:28:20,039
Do you have sleeping pills?

1664
02:28:20,581 --> 02:28:21,878
Can you get me one?

1665
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:25,048
It's in my bedroom cup board. Take it.

1666
02:28:32,093 --> 02:28:33,560
Mr. Gupta gave this foryou.

1667
02:28:38,099 --> 02:28:39,396
Security... - Yes mam.

1668
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:41,397
Take her to the car.
I'll be back in a sec.

1669
02:28:44,772 --> 02:28:48,401
How many did you take? - Just 2.

1670
02:28:54,982 --> 02:28:57,883
Okay. You take rest.

1671
02:29:00,988 --> 02:29:01,579
I'll leave.

1672
02:29:03,291 --> 02:29:04,258
Thank god!

1673
02:29:29,317 --> 02:29:30,614
Let's break this silence, Gowtham.

1674
02:29:32,653 --> 02:29:33,278
Look at me.

1675
02:29:34,488 --> 02:29:36,786
I don't want to waste this one day
which I've got.

1676
02:29:36,991 --> 02:29:38,959
Every minute is precious.

1677
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:41,458
Don't sit idle. C'mon cheer up.

1678
02:29:41,662 --> 02:29:42,959
Take me out.

1679
02:29:43,164 --> 02:29:45,291
Where? - Anywhere.

1680
02:29:45,499 --> 02:29:48,127
Park, beach, pub,
restaurant... anywhere.

1681
02:29:50,504 --> 02:29:53,962
With you, even a cemetery is fine.

1682
02:29:55,676 --> 02:29:58,304
C'mon... Gowtham, get up.

1683
02:29:58,579 --> 02:30:00,479
Let's go out. Get up.

1684
02:30:00,681 --> 02:30:02,649
C'mon. Let's go.

1685
02:30:11,025 --> 02:30:13,152
No need for a car.

1686
02:30:14,028 --> 02:30:15,325
Take me on a bike.

1687
02:30:18,032 --> 02:30:19,829
I don't have one, Ishu.

1688
02:30:20,067 --> 02:30:20,999
Oh! Shit

1689
02:30:30,411 --> 02:30:31,673
Hi! I'm Gowtham's friend.

1690
02:30:31,946 --> 02:30:33,004
Could you do me a favour?

1691
02:30:33,214 --> 02:30:36,012
I need your bike.
I want to go on a ride with him.

1692
02:30:36,217 --> 02:30:37,013
I'll give it back soon.

1693
02:30:37,218 --> 02:30:38,515
I will give you my car keys.

1694
02:30:40,554 --> 02:30:41,521
Please...

1695
02:30:51,565 --> 02:30:52,190
Come here.

1696
02:31:02,777 --> 02:31:04,210
Why this now?

1697
02:31:05,079 --> 02:31:09,038
I don't like to see you in formals
and as a responsible husband.

1698
02:31:38,446 --> 02:31:39,242
This is my Gowtham.

1699
02:31:41,949 --> 02:31:42,745
Come, let's go.

1700
02:31:50,157 --> 02:31:53,752
Wow! It was a dream to go
with you on a bike.

1701
02:31:53,961 --> 02:31:55,428
Go faster.

1702
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:57,927
Still faster...

1703
02:32:00,634 --> 02:32:05,936
No one in Mumbai should
drive faster than us.

1704
02:32:44,345 --> 02:32:46,313
Do you think about me
atleast once a day?

1705
02:32:47,681 --> 02:32:49,979
Or atleast when you call your daughter?

1706
02:32:53,854 --> 02:32:54,650
One beer please.

1707
02:32:55,189 --> 02:32:57,657
Green colour beer bottle. Thank you.

1708
02:33:01,695 --> 02:33:03,322
Earlier, you used to talk a lot.

1709
02:33:05,199 --> 02:33:06,996
But now, everything has changed.

1710
02:33:14,208 --> 02:33:18,338
Can you leave everything
behind & come with me?

1711
02:33:24,718 --> 02:33:25,514
I'll do that.

1712
02:33:25,719 --> 02:33:26,845
Thank you. -Welcome.

1713
02:33:30,724 --> 02:33:31,691
Have.

1714
02:33:32,893 --> 02:33:36,192
Drink. C'mon. Have it.

1715
02:33:43,904 --> 02:33:46,202
Gowtham, this isn't the way you drink.

1716
02:33:46,407 --> 02:33:48,034
You do the bottoms up.

1717
02:33:48,275 --> 02:33:52,871
Drink that way. - Now I can't.

1718
02:33:53,914 --> 02:33:58,874
Can't you do it for me? Please.

1719
02:34:14,435 --> 02:34:15,732
This is my Gowtham.

1720
02:34:18,939 --> 02:34:21,737
I like that. Even better.

1721
02:34:27,114 --> 02:34:32,074
Hey Gowtham! MTV Grind show in Mumbai!
That too when I'm here.

1722
02:34:32,286 --> 02:34:35,084
Please take me there.

1723
02:34:35,289 --> 02:34:37,416
Yeah! Come let's go.

1724
02:35:17,097 --> 02:35:19,895
Good evening everybody.
Listen now, people on the floor.

1725
02:35:21,268 --> 02:35:23,566
We've a surprise foryou today.

1726
02:35:23,771 --> 02:35:25,398
We have a little draw happening here.

1727
02:35:25,639 --> 02:35:28,574
For which... - Hold on your breath.

1728
02:35:28,842 --> 02:35:31,072
You have to perform on the floor.

1729
02:35:31,445 --> 02:35:34,414
And the winners are...

1730
02:35:34,648 --> 02:35:37,412
Just can't wait to know
who they are. I got it.

1731
02:35:38,285 --> 02:35:40,753
Gowtham & Ishwarya.

1732
02:35:46,627 --> 02:35:48,925
Put your hands together...

1733
02:35:55,135 --> 02:35:55,931

1734

<i># I'm a lucky girl. #</i>

1735
02:36:58,666 --> 02:37:01,965
<i># I'm the one who dares to touch the sky. #</i>

1736
02:37:02,169 --> 02:37:05,798
<i># I'm a lucky girl. #</i>

1737
02:37:06,006 --> 02:37:09,305
<i># I'm the one who dares to touch the sky. #</i>

1738
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:20,483
<i># You're lucky girl. #</i>

1739
02:37:20,688 --> 02:37:24,146
<i># You dare to touch the sky. #</i>

1740
02:37:24,358 --> 02:37:27,816
<i># You're the mixture of lightning and breeze. #</i>

1741
02:37:28,195 --> 02:37:32,495
<i># Your song is creating sensation here. #</i>

1742
02:37:39,373 --> 02:37:49,510
<i># Oh my dear!
Tell me the purpose of our living? #</i>

1743
02:37:50,384 --> 02:37:58,018
<i># Oh my love!
Why don't you enjoy this moment? #</i>

1744
02:37:58,292 --> 02:38:02,194
<i># I have a great fortune! #</i>

1745
02:38:38,932 --> 02:38:42,060
<i># I craved for your kiss, my love. #</i>

1746
02:38:42,336 --> 02:38:45,737
<i># I hope that you will help me. #</i>

1747
02:38:46,006 --> 02:38:49,407
<i># You craved for me. #</i>

1748
02:38:49,676 --> 02:38:53,237
<i># I was arrested by your love. #</i>

1749
02:38:53,947 --> 02:38:56,745
<i># I surrender myself to you. #</i>

1750
02:38:57,017 --> 02:39:00,748
<i># You lost the way. #</i>

1751
02:39:00,954 --> 02:39:04,583
<i># Oh maiden! I've forgotten myself. #</i>

1752
02:39:04,792 --> 02:39:10,094
<i># What is happening to me, tell me! #</i>

1753
02:39:15,135 --> 02:39:18,593
<i># I'm a lucky girl. #</i>

1754
02:39:18,806 --> 02:39:22,765
<i># I'm the one who dares to touch the sky. #</i>

1755
02:39:23,043 --> 02:39:26,103
<i># You're a lucky girl. #</i>

1756
02:39:26,313 --> 02:39:29,282
<i># You're the one who dares to touch the sky. #</i>

1757
02:39:29,483 --> 02:39:37,447
<i># I'm a mixture of lightning and breeze. #</i>

1758
02:39:37,658 --> 02:39:40,957
<i># You're the mixture of lightning and breeze. #</i>

1759
02:39:41,161 --> 02:39:44,961
<i># Your song is creating sensation here. #</i>

1760
02:39:45,165 --> 02:39:52,628
<i># I'm a mixture of lightning and breeze. #</i>

1761
02:39:54,675 --> 02:39:58,805
<i># I have great fortune! #</i>

1762
02:40:09,523 --> 02:40:10,490
Am I looking beautiful?

1763
02:40:11,525 --> 02:40:12,992
Am I up to your mark?

1764
02:40:13,694 --> 02:40:14,661
50%

1765
02:40:15,863 --> 02:40:16,659
Why?

1766
02:40:17,531 --> 02:40:23,993
There is a big difference between
present Ishu & college girl Ishu.

1767
02:40:24,872 --> 02:40:25,668
May be you're right.

1768
02:40:25,873 --> 02:40:29,001
Only my physical appearance has changed.

1769
02:40:31,211 --> 02:40:33,179
Gowtham, my heart is still the same.

1770
02:40:36,450 --> 02:40:37,849
Am I talking too much?

1771
02:40:38,385 --> 02:40:39,682
I can't help it.

1772
02:40:40,454 --> 02:40:41,853
Because I've lost many things.

1773
02:40:44,892 --> 02:40:47,019
Oh sorry! I upset you.

1774
02:40:47,895 --> 02:40:48,862
Sit...

1775
02:40:49,062 --> 02:40:49,858
Sit...

1776
02:40:51,398 --> 02:40:53,195
I've cooked all that I know.

1777
02:40:53,567 --> 02:40:55,535
Taste every dish.

1778
02:41:00,140 --> 02:41:02,540
Hope it will be good.
Just taste and see...

1779
02:41:07,481 --> 02:41:08,880
This is my special one.

1780
02:41:12,252 --> 02:41:12,877
It's enough.

1781
02:41:15,422 --> 02:41:17,720
You also join with me. -Yeah.

1782
02:41:32,439 --> 02:41:33,736
Gowtham, don't hesitate. Come on.

1783
02:41:52,192 --> 02:41:54,092
Gowtham, I can't forget this day!

1784
02:41:59,132 --> 02:42:00,429
Say something.

1785
02:42:02,469 --> 02:42:03,936
My time is elapsing.

1786
02:42:05,806 --> 02:42:06,932
Please...

1787
02:42:13,981 --> 02:42:18,281
Ishu, I can't forget any day spent with you.

1788
02:42:24,891 --> 02:42:27,121
Ishu, will you forgive me?

1789
02:42:28,028 --> 02:42:30,622
Hey, what's this?

1790
02:42:32,165 --> 02:42:33,291
Crying like a child?!

1791
02:42:34,835 --> 02:42:37,463
What did you do to excuse you?

1792
02:42:39,706 --> 02:42:47,738
You took me to all the places.
Beach, MTV show, restaurant, bike ride.

1793
02:42:47,848 --> 02:42:53,480
Wow! In one day,
you did several things for me.

1794
02:42:54,688 --> 02:42:57,156
Do you know why I asked to
take me to all these places?

1795
02:42:58,859 --> 02:43:09,167
When I visit the places we had visited now,
you must be seen there.

1796
02:43:11,038 --> 02:43:14,007
I should live in your memories.

1797
02:43:15,275 --> 02:43:17,505
I should die thinking you.

1798
02:43:19,546 --> 02:43:24,176
Gowtham, will you give that right to me?

1799
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:34,587
Let's brake the silence.

1800
02:45:30,210 --> 02:45:31,472
Hello, drive fast.

1801
02:45:46,226 --> 02:45:46,988
What happened?

1802
02:45:47,227 --> 02:45:49,161
Traffic jam. It will take some time.

1803
02:48:44,037 --> 02:48:45,004
Where is Ishu?

1804
02:48:55,615 --> 02:48:57,014
My dear Kundavi...

1805
02:48:57,717 --> 02:49:03,019
I can't forget you in my life since you
presented a memorable day to me!

1806
02:49:03,957 --> 02:49:04,855
Thanks.

1807
02:49:06,059 --> 02:49:08,027
When you left Gowtham to me,

1808
02:49:08,228 --> 02:49:12,028
I understood the compassion
in your eyes.

1809
02:49:13,066 --> 02:49:16,035
You gave me one day
to spend with Gowtham.

1810
02:49:16,302 --> 02:49:18,702
But all we needed was just an hour!

1811
02:49:19,406 --> 02:49:20,873
Silence for40 minutes.

1812
02:49:21,241 --> 02:49:22,708
Formal inquiries for 10 minutes.

1813
02:49:23,076 --> 02:49:24,703
10 minutes to talk.

1814
02:49:24,978 --> 02:49:33,386
He talked only about you even
in those ten minutes.

1815
02:49:34,254 --> 02:49:39,055
I realized how well you've
merged in his life.

1816
02:49:39,759 --> 02:49:46,892
When we fear of losing our beloved,
we become possessive of them.

1817
02:49:47,267 --> 02:49:53,900
We will be at peace if we realize that
they're with more safer hands than us,

1818
02:49:54,274 --> 02:49:57,732
I'm taking leave from you
in that state of mind.

1819
02:49:58,278 --> 02:50:00,576
In my next birth also,
I should love Gowtham.

1820
02:50:01,114 --> 02:50:05,073
Not as Ishu, but as Kundavi.

1821
02:50:05,685 --> 02:50:07,243
Thanks, Kundavi.

1822
02:50:21,968 --> 02:50:22,935
Where is Ishu?

1823
02:50:24,504 --> 02:50:25,266
I want to see her.

1824
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:40,286
I've asked you many times.

1825
02:50:42,055 --> 02:50:44,455
"Have you ever loved any one"?

1826
02:50:46,159 --> 02:50:48,127
Such a big thing has happened.

1827
02:50:48,995 --> 02:50:50,963
You never thought of revealing it to me.

1828
02:50:51,831 --> 02:50:53,458
Gowtham, why did you hide it from me?

1829
02:50:54,634 --> 02:50:59,469
Kundavi, a woman can tolerate anything,

1830
02:50:59,839 --> 02:51:08,804
but can never tolerate another girl
sharing her husband's love.

1831
02:51:10,183 --> 02:51:13,812
I don't want to give you that pain.

1832
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:16,320
That's why I hid it from you.

1833
02:51:18,858 --> 02:51:25,161
But you've searched
that girl and found her,

1834
02:51:26,032 --> 02:51:28,330
and brought her infront of me,

1835
02:51:29,702 --> 02:51:32,000
at that time, I don't know,

1836
02:51:34,774 --> 02:51:37,334
I became speechless!

1837
02:52:07,907 --> 02:52:09,033
Hi darling!

1838
02:52:09,742 --> 02:52:11,710
Look there!

1839
02:52:11,911 --> 02:52:13,208
Mom, look there!

1840
02:52:15,248 --> 02:52:17,375
Aunty bought me many crackers.

1841
02:52:17,617 --> 02:52:19,050
I've kept everything down.

1842
02:52:37,103 --> 02:52:40,072
<i># New York city was sleeping. #</i>

1843
02:52:40,273 --> 02:52:42,741
<i># Loneliness was growing. #</i>

1844
02:52:42,942 --> 02:52:46,241
<i># Mist was enveloping. #</i>

1845
