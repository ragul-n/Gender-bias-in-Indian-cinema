1
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,875
Yeah, I was supposed to order something.

2
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,208
{\an8}Sir, it's been two weeks.

3
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,625
{\an8}The media is getting impatient.

4
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,666
{\an8}The foreign embassies have
been questioning as well.

5
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,125
We can't dodge them anymore.

6
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,000
What do you expect me to say?

7
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,500
We haven't made any progress in this case.

8
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,625
Shall we hand over this
case to the NIA, sir?

9
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,333
NIA?

10
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,500
National Investigation Agency.

11
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,208
They are a new organization.
Can they handle this?

12
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,000
We've trained them to handle
these types of situations.

13
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,125
Who is the best we have?

14
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,416
Vijay Varma…

15
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,541
also known as the "Wild Dog."

16
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,250
But he is not in the NIA anymore.

17
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,333
What?

18
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,583
Why?

19
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,291
Zohra House, Hyderabad.

20
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,750
-What?
-Sir, I have a package for you.

21
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,916
It's not mine.

22
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,916
Check the address, sir.
It says, "313, Zohra House."

23
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,083
-You are Ashok Hussain, right?
-No, you've got the wrong address.

24
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,666
But the address mentioned here--

25
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,791
They are definitely terrorists.

26
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,958
I saw their weapons.
There are more than five people in there.

27
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,708
-Ali, take the shot!
-Yes, sir!

28
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:53,958
Sir!

29
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,750
They have AK-47s.

30
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,250
They are more than five men
as per the information we got.

31
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,541
-How many entries and exits are there?
-Just one.

32
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,166
Clear, sir.

33
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,333
Boys, let's move. Spare no one.

34
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,375
-Ali, cover me.
-Okay, sir.

35
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,125
Sir!

36
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,708
You'd be killed if you don't kill them.

37
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,875
<i>Two people have been murdered in</i>
<i>Samastipur in the last 24 hours.</i>

38
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,041
<i>A young man was shot dead.</i>

39
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,416
<i>And the leader of a political party…</i>

40
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,375
Hey!

41
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,041
Stop hiding!

42
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,708
Hey! Come on!

43
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,333
Please arrest me, sir.

44
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,083
Arrest me, sir.

45
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,958
<i>He doesn't believe in half measures.</i>

46
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,541
<i>There are no criminals alive in any case</i>
<i>Vijay Varma has ever handled.</i>

47
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,958
That's the reason they
call him the Wild Dog.

48
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,208
Was he suspended or transferred?

49
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,083
He's been given a desk job.

50
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,458
Wild Dog.

51
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,791
The press is going to have a field day.

52
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,708
Summon him.

53
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,583
Priya, I am back.

54
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,458
Hey, sir!

55
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,875
What a lovely surprise!

56
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,916
I should say that.

57
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,666
Priya, you deserve an award.

58
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,958
You have domesticated our Wild Dog.

59
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:34,375
He might be the Wild Dog for your
department and the media, but not for me.

60
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,416
Sir, please have a seat.

61
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,875
How are you?

62
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,166
I am starving.

63
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,666
Priya!

64
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,750
I haven't eaten food prepared
by you for a long time.

65
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,875
How is sister-in-law?

66
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,416
She is very angry.

67
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,625
Why?

68
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,958
You haven't called her
for the past three years.

69
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,125
You could've at least called my daughter.

70
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,208
She misses you.

71
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,791
I know.

72
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,208
But I just couldn't do it.

73
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,458
Talking to her…

74
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,916
reminds me of Navya.

75
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,333
Excuse me.

76
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,333
I'm sorry, Vijay.

77
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,583
It's okay.

78
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,875
Please.

79
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,083
Dad, you can't do this!

80
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,500
Mom, please tell him!
He does this every time!

81
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,375
Navya, please don't go.
That place is overcrowded.

82
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,875
You want to eat <i>chaat,</i> right?

83
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,583
I will send a constable and get
it for you in a jiffy. Okay?

84
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,958
No! Not okay!

85
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,291
I want to have <i>chaat</i> with
my friends at Gokul Chat.

86
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,125
Mom, at least, you tell him!
Please, tell him!

87
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,250
Not possible.

88
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,750
Vijay, stop being so possessive.

89
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,666
Her friends are going along with
her, right? She will be fine.

90
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,333
Navya, you can go.

91
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,541
I love you, Mom!

92
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,541
How is Priya doing now?

93
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,375
She is slowly recovering.

94
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,750
I know.

95
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,208
It's very difficult
even for me to accept…

96
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,583
that Navya is not a part
of our lives anymore.

97
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:53,916
Vijay…

98
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,708
we need you back.

99
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,125
Why me?

100
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,458
Because you are still the best.

101
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,958
Did you get any leads in the blast case?

102
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,250
No.

103
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,625
Vijay.

104
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,750
We must get them!

105
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,708
I'll come back…

106
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,083
on one condition.

107
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,333
I need my team back.

108
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,791
They want me to rejoin the NIA.

109
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,666
Don't worry about me.

110
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,833
I will be fine.

111
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,166
-Note down the names of these four guys.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

112
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,083
And put them on the Pune blast case.

113
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,291
Ali Reza.

114
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,166
Rudra Goud.

115
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,583
Hashwanth Manohar.

116
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,666
And Caleb Matthews.

117
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,000
And the special investigative
team shall be led by Vijay Varma.

118
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,208
It is great to be back
with you again, sir.

119
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,458
Yeah. How's life?

120
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,083
Our lives are awesome, sir…

121
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,583
but he got married.

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,833
Sorry, I couldn't attend your marriage.

123
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,041
-That's okay, sir.
-Who is the girl?

124
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,166
-We attended college together in the US.
-Oh.

125
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,083
Brother Caleb,
when are you going to get married?

126
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,000
Brother… didn't you tell him?

127
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,916
Tell me what?

128
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,250
-He met a girl for an arranged marriage!
-Oh, really?

129
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,208
-The bride's family was waiting for him.
-Okay.

130
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,875
The bride's mother asked him
a question when he got there.

131
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:46,833
What question?

132
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,916
"Why did you come alone, sir?
When will your son arrive?"

133
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,708
Good to see you back, sir.

134
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,541
I need the dog squad's report.

135
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,125
Ali, give me a pen!

136
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,416
What kind of explosives did they use?

137
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,958
IED with RDX and Ammonium Nitrate.
These are commonly used explosives.

138
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,958
They're easy to get their hands on.
Tracking them is difficult.

139
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,416
Do you have the CCTV
footage of that camera?

140
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,791
There's only one closed-circuit
camera outside, sir.

141
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,375
I watched the entire footage.
I found no one suspicious as such.

142
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,708
No suspect identified.

143
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,000
Hey… that could be a lead. Be careful.

144
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,291
-Yes, sir.
-Come.

145
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,416
Any other eye-witnesses?

146
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,916
There's no evidence, sir.
The waiters are also in the ICU.

147
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,083
-Yeah?
-Yes, sir.

148
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay.

149
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,500
I need the CCTV footage and
forensic expert's reports immediately.

150
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,541
Sure, sir.

151
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,333
Sir, here are the forensic
reports you'd asked for.

152
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,500
How was your honeymoon?

153
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,708
What can I say?

154
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,291
I got a phone call as soon
as we landed in Shimla…

155
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,291
from the Wild Dog.

156
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,208
Bad luck, bro!

157
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,416
A honeymoon is the best part of marriage!

158
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,708
And you have missed that.

159
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,750
<i>Who am I?</i>

160
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,458
Brother Caleb… I watched
Mr. Bachchan's <i>Rann</i> last night.

161
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,500
Wow! He's a great orator!

162
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,250
"There is a government,

163
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,375
there are businessmen,
who create wealth for the nation,

164
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,000
and there are politicians.

165
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,041
It is their duty to--"

166
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,375
Now, I understand…

167
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,000
why you couldn't become an actor.

168
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,000
How could you say that!

169
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,500
I would have been the next
Amitabh Bachchan if I had luck.

170
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,458
It is ready. Inform the boss.

171
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,416
Because of people like you,
good actors like me are being oppressed.

172
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,041
Pause.

173
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,958
Rewind a little.

174
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,708
Stop.

175
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,666
Now, play it at the same pace.

176
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,625
Stop.

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,125
Look at that guy wearing a cap.

178
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,333
What about him, sir?

179
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,916
People generally look for tables
when they go to a restaurant.

180
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,458
Or a waiter guides them to the table.

181
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,125
But he went directly to the table.

182
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,416
It means he already knows
that he has to go to that table.

183
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,625
He must be familiar with that place.

184
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,750
Maybe, he's a regular customer.

185
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,000
Maybe.

186
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,666
Hashwanth, zoom in.

187
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,625
Hazy footage.

188
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,875
On top of that,
the cap is covering his face.

189
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,375
He escaped very quickly
from the CCTV camera range.

190
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,666
It doesn't seem like an accident.

191
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,291
Hashwanth,
play the footage of him going out.

192
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,875
There he is. Nothing suspicious, sir.

193
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,958
He is clean. Everything looks normal.

194
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,875
Play the footage of the second camera.

195
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,208
There's nothing much happening in there.
We've already checked it.

196
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,375
Zoom in on the reflection on the counter.

197
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,708
Play the entry footage.

198
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,125
Rewind it.

199
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,541
Pause.

200
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,500
Sir, he's got something in his right hand.

201
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,458
Play the exit footage now.

202
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,500
Pause.

203
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,333
Rewind it.

204
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,208
Now, play it.

205
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,125
Boss… he's got something
in his right hand.

206
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,250
Yes! Lights on!

207
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,541
Oh, shit!

208
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,500
He was ready! He knew where
the CCTV cameras were positioned!

209
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,250
This means that he had already
inspected John's Bakery.

210
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Sir!

211
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,708
That's why we couldn't see his right hand,
and he covered his face with a cap.

212
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,250
Now the question is…

213
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,750
Sir!

214
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,416
One of the waiters regained
consciousness this morning.

215
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,458
Doctor, how is he now?

216
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,666
Manish, my name is Vijay Varma.

217
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,666
I'm an officer of the
National Investigation Agency.

218
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,041
I am here to inquire about
the bomb blast at John's Bakery.

219
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,041
On the day of the blast at 6:30 p.m.

220
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,333
the person who we think is the suspect
was sitting at table number 12.

221
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,416
You served him his food.

222
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,583
Can you identify him?

223
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,500
Can you describe anything about him?

224
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,083
Any clue about him.

225
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,000
Any information you give us
would be very useful to us.

226
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,041
-Manish--
-Vijay!

227
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,375
You cannot pressurize
the patient like this.

228
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,708
I am sorry,
but I'll have to ask you to leave.

229
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,125
He is the one, sir.

230
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,416
What?

231
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,458
He was sitting at table number 12.

232
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,041
Doctor, I need to record this statement.

233
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,250
This is very important
evidence for the charge sheet.

234
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,125
You need to get his
parents' permission for that.

235
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,666
Sir, do you have any objections?

236
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:20,166
Sir, every word uttered by your son
would help us nab that terrorist.

237
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,250
No one except the judge in
the court would see that video.

238
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,041
I guarantee that Manish will be safe.

239
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,500
Promise me, sir.

240
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,541
Promise me that you would
nab that bastard, sir!

241
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,125
I promise you, sir.

242
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,125
He came to the restaurant at 6:30 p.m.
on February 13th.

243
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,250
He was carrying a black
bag in his right hand.

244
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,458
He sat at table number 12.

245
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,166
He ordered a sandwich and cold coffee.

246
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,833
He also gave me a 500-rupee bill.

247
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,250
By the time I returned to the table
to give him the change, he was gone.

248
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,041
But he left the black bag behind.

249
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,291
I thought he might've forgotten about it.

250
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,583
So, I was going to the table
to take it and give it to the owner.

251
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,125
Suddenly…

252
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:39,083
Manish, can you describe his
face to our sketch artists?

253
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,833
-Salaam alaikum.
-Wa-alaikum assalam.

254
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,583
The stuff is ready, right?

255
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,708
Ten cases of RDX.

256
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,958
Okay. Load it into the vehicle quickly.

257
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,125
It's done, brother.

258
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,166
Brother, if you could introduce
me to the commander…

259
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,333
Not now. We will do it later. Leave.

260
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,583
Brother… you didn't let me
meet him the last time either.

261
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,250
-I really wish to meet him--
-Let him come.

262
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,625
You wanted to see me, right?

263
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,333
Brother, your…

264
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,833
Send this sketch to
the Intelligence Bureau,

265
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:48,958
the ATS teams in all the states,
and the local police here in Pune.

266
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,833
Use all your sources.

267
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,708
Check every hotel, lodge,
and guest house thoroughly.

268
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,750
{\an8}PUNE GUEST HOUSE

269
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,875
He might have eaten or slept somewhere.

270
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,375
He might have met someone
somewhere as well.

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,750
Auto-rickshaw drivers, taxi drivers, real
estate brokers, landlords, shopkeepers…

272
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,583
someone must have seen him!

273
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,000
He stayed in this town,
roamed around, and planted a bomb.

274
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,416
He cannot get away.

275
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,708
We need to get him.

276
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,625
And by the way…

277
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,416
no one can go home until we nab him.

278
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,458
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

279
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,500
How is the investigation going on?

280
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,583
It is going on, sir.

281
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,083
Vijay…

282
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:46,083
two weeks ago, an incident took place
at the Andhra-Tamil Nadu border.

283
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,833
Hey, where are you going?
And what's inside?

284
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,625
We're going to the godown.
It's a load of sweet lemons.

285
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:04,541
We need to check it.

286
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,500
It's just sweet lemons, sir.

287
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,708
Hey… just do as I say!

288
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,708
Two policemen have died.

289
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:36,750
Exactly three days before
this incident happened,

290
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,916
the Intelligence Bureau passed us
information about the transportation

291
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,833
of 50 kilograms of RDX from
the Andhra-Tamil Nadu border.

292
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:44,833
Vijay…

293
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,875
he is onto his next move.

294
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,666
We need to nab him before
another blast happens.

295
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,541
Sir… we know what he looks like.

296
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,083
We'd also find out his name in a few days.

297
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,958
I just need a small breakthrough.

298
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,625
Hello? Okay, sir.

299
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,125
Give me 20 copies of this.

300
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,416
-Twenty?
-Yeah.

301
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,583
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

302
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,041
Okay, sir.

303
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,083
Oh, this guy!

304
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:16,833
Why do you have his sketch?

305
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,166
-Hold on.
-I know this guy.

306
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,375
-Do you know him?
-Yeah.

307
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,916
He had rented the room
on my terrace for a week.

308
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,333
Hey, Dinesh! Call Mr. Vijay immediately!

309
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,458
He told me that he had
come to Pune for college.

310
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:34,166
He vacated the room after a week and left
because he couldn't get an admission.

311
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,916
Hey! How could you just let people live
in your house without inquiring anything?

312
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,250
Actually, sir… I did it on
Mirza Baig's recommendation.

313
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,625
Find out where he is.

314
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,291
Baig!

315
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,833
Come here!

316
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,125
Don't run away!

317
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,791
Bastard!

318
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,250
I told you not to run away, didn't I?

319
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,750
Got it, boss!

320
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,166
Hey, get up! Come on!

321
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,500
Ali, did he talk?

322
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,083
Yes, sir.
Our pliers have worked as usual.

323
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,500
Tell me.

324
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,666
One day, I received a call…

325
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,750
from Pakistan when I was at the shop.

326
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,541
It was Brother Riaz.

327
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,166
Why do you refer to him as "brother"?
Is he your sibling?

328
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,541
Tell me his full name!

329
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,291
Riaz Khan.

330
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,250
He told me that someone is coming to Pune.

331
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,708
He asked me to take care of his
accommodation and explosives.

332
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,000
What's his name?

333
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:36,916
Khalid.

334
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,000
<i>I met him at the bus stop.</i>

335
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,958
<i>There was a guy who was accompanying him.</i>

336
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,166
<i>His name is Khatil.</i>

337
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>I took them to Mr. Shamshad's house</i>
<i>and gave them the explosives.</i>

338
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,541
<i>He had two targets.</i>

339
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,083
<i>The Dagdusheth temple and John's Bakery.</i>

340
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,458
Khalid thought that the
bombing would get more attention

341
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,250
because many foreigners
visit John's Bakery.

342
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,291
<i>According to the plan,</i>
<i>on 13th February…</i>

343
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,208
<i>Khalid went to the bakery</i>
<i>and Khatil went to the temple.</i>

344
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,125
<i>A VIP was visiting the temple that day.</i>

345
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,833
<i>The security at the temple</i>
<i>scared him away.</i>

346
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:11,291
<i>He dumped the bomb</i>
<i>in the gutters without planting it.</i>

347
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,250
But Khalid did his job.

348
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,791
Where can we find Khalid?

349
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
I don't know, sir.

350
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,791
They call and give us an order.

351
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,166
That's how Indian Mujahideen operates.

352
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,000
Boys.

353
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,833
Contact all the agencies.

354
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:32,708
I need all the information about
every Khalid who has a criminal record.

355
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,416
-Okay, sir.
-Do it quickly.

356
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,333
-Hello.
-Sir, I'm calling from the Gujarat ATS.

357
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,833
Khalid was involved in the
2008 Ahmedabad Blast case.

358
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,000
What?

359
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,708
There's one criminal who
was arrested for this blast.

360
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,750
Wait a minute.

361
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,125
What's his name?

362
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,208
Mohammed Peerbuoy.

363
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,791
He's currently at Yerwada Central Prison.

364
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,875
Sir, you wanted to see me?

365
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,583
Yeah… close the door.

366
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,750
Have you watched Amitabh Bachchan's <i>Don?</i>

367
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,916
I've watched it 25 times, sir. Why?

368
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,000
Do you wish to be Amitabh Bachchan?

369
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,583
Of course, sir. But… how?

370
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,166
What did he do?

371
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,291
He is involved in the blast
that happened at John's Bakery.

372
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:47,666
Have a seat.

373
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,291
What's your name?

374
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,666
Moin Ali.

375
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,500
Where are you from?

376
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Nagpada, Mumbai.

377
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,750
I'm Mohammed Peerbuoy.

378
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,333
Eat.

379
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,875
Are you really involved in the bomb blast?

380
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,125
No, bro.

381
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,583
They've framed me because I'm a Muslim.

382
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,208
Tell me exactly what happened.

383
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,625
I work as a laborer at
a shipping company in Dubai.

384
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,833
I load and unload goods
in a cargo container.

385
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,583
I have been to Pakistan twice for work.

386
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,375
While I was enjoying
holidays with my family…

387
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,000
the cops came and arrested me.

388
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,750
They brought me here claiming
that I work for the ISI

389
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,583
and I'm the one who supplied
explosives to some guy named Baig,

390
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,833
which he used, to blow up the bakery.

391
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:10,208
They are torturing me to give
details about someone named Khalid.

392
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,125
Forget about going back to Dubai now.

393
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,333
What are you planning
to do if you get out on bail?

394
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,958
I don't know, but I won't go back home.

395
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,958
Would you like to go to Bihar?

396
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,666
There is a library called "Darul-Ul-Islam"
in Darbhanga.

397
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,375
Tell him that Peerbuoy has sent you.

398
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,958
He will take care of the rest.

399
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,291
Okay.

400
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,041
{\an8}-Did you cross-check all the documents?
-Yes, sir. We are hundred percent sure.

401
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,916
Here is his duplicate passport.

402
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,458
Oh, my God!

403
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:02,916
Boss, the suspect we are looking for
is definitely a resident of Bhatkal.

404
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,375
He had a different name before
changing his name to Khalid.

405
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,625
{\an8}This is our man, Khalid Bhatkal.

406
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,875
His real name is Mohammed Siddibappa.

407
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,750
He was born in Bhatkal, Karnataka.

408
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:19,750
{\an8}He joined hands with Indian Mujahideen
members, Iqbal and Riyaz.

409
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,958
He came to Mumbai in 2005.

410
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:25,083
{\an8}He sold lungis in local trains
posing as Abdul Kareem.

411
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,125
That was his research for
the 2006 Mumbai Blasts.

412
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,583
Then, he went to Pakistan
and got trained in the ISI.

413
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,583
He is a specialist in making bombs.

414
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,291
Then, he returned to India…

415
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,833
{\an8}and worked as a caretaker by the name
of Imran in a farmhouse in Udupi.

416
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:43,625
The bombs made there were used in
Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, Varanasi…

417
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,000
and Hyderabad as well.

418
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,916
Now, Khalid is Indian
Mujahideen's commander-in-chief.

419
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,791
He can change his
attire like a chameleon.

420
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:58,041
Such a man is wandering among
the people as an ordinary man.

421
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,333
They don't know who he is, what
he is, and where he is!

422
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,291
He is extremely dangerous.

423
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:28,000
Commander, what is our next target?

424
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,333
The biggest event in India is cricket.

425
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:35,333
IPL.

426
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,250
We'd use a high-intensity bomb,

427
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,916
which would kill at least 2000 people.

428
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,166
The stampede that follows
will take care of the rest.

429
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,666
The blast should happen in
the two states at the same time.

430
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,416
Hyderabad and Chennai.

431
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,416
This is how I'll hit a home run in India.

432
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,000
You'll be in charge of
Hyderabad while I go to Chennai.

433
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,041
Salaam alaikum.

434
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,250
Wa-alaikum assalam.

435
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,375
I'm here to meet Mr. Asadullah.

436
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,000
I am Asadullah. Tell me.

437
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,750
Peerbuoy has sent me.

438
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,083
What's his full name?

439
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,458
Mohammed Peerbuoy.

440
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,666
But he is in jail right now, isn't he?

441
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,791
That's where I met him.

442
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,291
Hello, Mr. Khatil.

443
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:42,208
Let's go.

444
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:51,166
How are we going to get the bomb inside
the stadium? Do you have any plans?

445
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,791
I know someone who works there.

446
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,416
There is nothing to worry about.

447
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,375
Everything will go as planned.

448
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,916
-Hello.
<i>-Hussain is very ill.</i>

449
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,250
-What?
<i>-I've taken him to the hospital.</i>

450
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,250
When did it happen?

451
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,666
Hey, stop the car!

452
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:22,958
Hello.

453
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,500
Sir, Ali here.

454
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,166
Ali, is everything alright?

455
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,916
Yes, sir.
I have some important information.

456
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:34,416
<i>Khalid's accomplice, Khatil, has come</i>
<i>to Bihar for his son's treatment.</i>

457
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,333
Asadullah told me about it.
I just gave him some money.

458
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:38,916
Superb!

459
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:40,791
-Ali…
<i>-Yes, sir?</i>

460
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,166
-Take care.
<i>-Okay, sir.</i>

461
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,458
-How much is it?
-Twenty rupees.

462
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,916
His family is in the hospital…

463
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,666
but he is not in there.

464
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,041
Let's wait and watch.

465
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,208
Someone just got out of an auto-rickshaw.

466
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,625
He could be Khatil.

467
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,541
Yeah!

468
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,833
It's definitely him.

469
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,208
Let's do this.

470
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,166
DISTRICT CLINIC

471
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,708
-Excuse me, brother!
-Yes? Hey, what are you--

472
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,625
NIA.

473
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,125
Come on, get in.

474
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,291
Get in, idiot!

475
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Your son has a heart condition, right?

476
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,458
I think, he immediately
needs heart surgery.

477
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,208
I'll take you to Delhi
if you don't speak up.

478
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,541
You can bid goodbye to your family.

479
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,375
They'll never know the reason
behind your disappearance.

480
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,625
You'll be responsible
for your son's death.

481
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,916
No, sir. Please, don't say that.

482
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,541
I'll take care of your son.

483
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,291
He will be alright.

484
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,500
But for that to happen,
you need to start talking.

485
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,625
Had I been in your position
I would've accepted this deal.

486
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,083
First, tell me about…

487
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,666
the Indian Mujahideen's hideouts.

488
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:38,791
I promise…

489
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,666
your son will be safe.

490
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,791
I will take care of it.

491
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,125
Hey, stop!

492
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:10,916
Stop it!

493
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,708
They've been raiding our
hideouts after Khatil's arrest.

494
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,375
It's not safe out here.
We need to lay low for a few days.

495
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,166
We'll keep in touch.
Moin, go to Bombay.

496
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,333
Okay, brother.

497
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,208
Commander, Khatil has revealed
all our hideouts to the police.

498
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,333
None of our hideouts are safe.

499
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,625
Tell me what's our next plan!

500
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,041
I have a new hideout.

501
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,375
I have a new recruit as well.
His name is Moin Ali.

502
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,500
He will be in Nagpada, Bombay.

503
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,166
<i>I will inform him. You can go there.</i>

504
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,416
<i>You'll be safe there.</i>

505
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,166
Tell me, Ali.

506
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,125
Asadullah, the librarian,
had just called me.

507
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,708
<i>An important person is</i>
<i>coming to Mumbai tomorrow.</i>

508
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,791
He wants me to take him to a safe house.

509
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,750
-Did he tell his name?
<i>-No, sir.</i>

510
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,416
But it seems like he
is an important person.

511
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:27,750
Khalid.

512
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,500
He is definitely Khalid.

513
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,291
He is going to meet me tomorrow
at 5:00 p.m. at Kala Ghoda.

514
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,583
COBBLER

515
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,291
Boys… Ali is here.

516
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,333
Be alert.

517
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,291
Okay, boss.

518
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,916
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

519
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,791
Khalid will call Ali anytime now.

520
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:29,750
Ask our surveillance team
to trace Khalid's number…

521
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,458
<i>and triangulate his location.</i>

522
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,833
We will know Khalid's exact position.

523
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,000
Yes, sir.

524
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,916
Hello.

525
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,041
Walk towards the trash can on your left.

526
00:45:58,666 --> 00:45:59,750
Where are you?

527
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,958
Don't ask questions. Just start walking.

528
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,833
Switch off your phone
and throw it into the trash can.

529
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,791
Take the phone that's lying
in the other trash can.

530
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,875
Throw the phone. Stop wasting time.

531
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,375
Shit!

532
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,958
Bastard!

533
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,250
He is very smart.

534
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:58,583
Hello.

535
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,291
Follow my instructions carefully.

536
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,500
Walk straight ahead.

537
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,333
Hashwanth, follow Ali immediately!

538
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,083
<i>Don't let him out of your sight!</i>

539
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:40,416
Run.

540
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,583
Hashwanth, he is watching you.
Go to your left.

541
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,833
Now, head towards your right.

542
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,416
Yes!

543
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,541
Caleb, Ali is coming towards you.

544
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,583
You take over.

545
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay, boss.

546
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,541
Are you sure it's him?

547
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,416
Yes, sir. It's him.

548
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,041
Caleb, go straight.

549
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,375
Don't follow Ali.
Hashwanth will take over.

550
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:55,958
Get into a taxi.

551
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,791
Okay, brother.

552
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,750
Yes!

553
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,625
-Bro, let's go.
-Hop in.

554
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,166
Wait.

555
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:08,125
-What?
-Not this taxi.

556
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,041
Board the taxi no. 2124 that's behind it.

557
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,625
Okay, brother.

558
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,833
-Sorry, bro.
-Come on, man!

559
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:17,916
Brother.

560
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:28,625
Boys, Khalid will get here any minute now.

561
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:31,916
I'm coming down.

562
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,541
I'm coming.

563
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,166
Come on, get out!

564
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,666
-Come on!
-Who are you?

565
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,791
Hey, let go of me!
What are you doing, man?

566
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,166
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

567
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,041
Let go of me!

568
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:43,958
Hey!

569
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,166
Hey, stop it!

570
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,458
Let go of me!

571
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,583
Shit!

572
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,958
Sir, they are from the Mumbai ATS.

573
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,875
They are following Moin Ali because they
had a tip-off from the Bihar intelligence.

574
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,583
-You guys ruined our plan!
-What did we do?

575
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,875
-Do you understand what you're saying?
-Sir--

576
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,875
-Sir--
-What the fuck did you do?

577
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:33,500
Boss, we missed him.

578
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,875
I know! He's gone!

579
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,583
Bastard!

580
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:39,208
Oh, shit!

581
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:44,708
What rubbish is this!

582
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:46,291
I thought you've changed.

583
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,250
How can you slap
a police officer like that?

584
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,458
On a busy street?

585
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:54,250
Sorry… you've left me with
no option but to suspend you!

586
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:57,000
-Sir, he--
-No, Hemanth! It's an order!

587
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,625
-Tell me, boss.
<i>-Caleb, I may be suspended officially,</i>

588
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,833
<i>but the operation</i>
<i>shouldn't be stopped.</i>

589
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,708
<i>Stay in touch with every agency.</i>

590
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,375
<i>I don't care where he's hiding!</i>
<i>We'll get him.</i>

591
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,083
Speak up!

592
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,666
-Bastard, speak up!
-Come on!

593
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,500
<i>Sir, we have beefed up the</i>
<i>security at every state border.</i>

594
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,583
<i>We've interrogated</i>
<i>everyone who was arrested.</i>

595
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>But none of them has any</i>
<i>information about Khalid.</i>

596
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,333
Boss, as per your order,
our surveillance team…

597
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:48,666
has been tapping all the phones
related to Khalid's family.

598
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:52,833
<i>Khalid hasn't contacted his family.</i>

599
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,333
Give me a call whenever you get any news.

600
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:58,458
-Bye.
-Bye.

601
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:09,333
Every ATS team and cybercrime division
in India has been looking for him,

602
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,750
<i>but we don't have any</i>
<i>information about him.</i>

603
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:18,625
<i>We've been constantly watching</i>
<i>all the Mujahideen hideouts.</i>

604
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,291
-Just find out and let me know.
-Ali, check here.

605
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,041
-I'll check the next floor.
-Okay.

606
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:29,458
Sir, we have sent his details to all
our agents in the foreign countries.

607
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,791
<i>But we haven't got any</i>
<i>information about him yet.</i>

608
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,083
<i>No one knows where he is.</i>

609
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,041
<i>That animal just</i>
<i>disappeared like a ghost.</i>

610
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,750
Navya!

611
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:13,958
Hello.

612
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,583
Sir, Khalid is in Nepal.

613
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,166
You know you've been suspended, right?

614
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,833
Officially, yes.

615
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,041
But I have been working unofficially.

616
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,666
How do you know he is in Nepal?

617
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,416
A month ago, Khalid's wife
had received a phone call.

618
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,291
Our surveillance team tapped it.

619
00:55:56,208 --> 00:56:00,083
We suspected that it was Khalid who had
called and we traced the scrambled number.

620
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,125
We traced it to Kathmandu.

621
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:05,041
Later, I contacted my
source and confirmed it.

622
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,541
-Who is your source?
-Arya, sir.

623
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,833
Your information is correct.

624
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:12,041
<i>My sources tell me that the</i>
<i>ISI has relocated a new asset.</i>

625
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,458
They call him Dr. Yousuf.

626
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,000
A religious preacher.

627
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,958
<i>But no one knows his location.</i>

628
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,125
<i>He is under the protection of the ISI.</i>

629
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:20,250
He could be Khalid.

630
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:21,750
Are you sure?

631
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:22,916
I am pretty sure.

632
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:28,750
Sir, the ghost we have been trying
to catch all these years is Khalid.

633
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:31,166
We've got the information about
his location for the first time.

634
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,500
We have to nab him before
he flees from Nepal.

635
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,625
We have to do this, sir.

636
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,333
India needs to get him.

637
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,708
Do you know what's the secret
behind a great bomb?

638
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,833
It's not about science or chemicals.

639
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,500
It's love.

640
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:15,250
Love for Allah.

641
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,958
Love for our creed.

642
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,791
Every time I make a bomb…

643
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,958
I remember my mother.

644
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,375
She used to cook for
me with a lot of love.

645
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,000
She used to make tiny portions…

646
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,791
and feed me with her own hands.

647
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:35,083
That is when I realized that we
should do everything with love.

648
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:37,166
God is in small details.

649
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:40,166
Now, our dish is ready.

650
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,500
We'll garnish it with some nails
and some ball bearings.

651
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,125
It will give it an extra zing.

652
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,333
After the blast, every nail and
ball bearing acts like a bullet.

653
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:54,875
Now…

654
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,583
place this bomb in a special cooker.

655
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:02,291
It multiplies the effect of the blast.

656
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,333
Take this.

657
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,583
God is with you.

658
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:17,541
{\an8}<i>The CBI has submitted a report</i>
<i>to the Ahmedabad court today.</i>

659
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,833
<i>The report states that Ishrat Jahaan and</i>
<i>three others were killed extrajudicially.</i>

660
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,875
-May I come in, sir?
-Come in.

661
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,958
<i>On 14th June 2004, the crime</i>
<i>branch of Ahmedabad Police</i>

662
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,750
<i>and Intelligence Bureau</i>
<i>executed these extrajudicial killings.</i>

663
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,750
I have read your proposal
of catching Khalid in Nepal.

664
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:32,666
Sir.

665
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,416
After this Ishrat Jahaan
controversy, I can't take any risk.

666
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:37,541
Sorry.

667
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:41,125
Sir, we've received information
from a valid source.

668
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,583
It is not possible under
the current circumstances.

669
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,208
Let the situation cool down.

670
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:48,333
Sir, to hell with the minister!

671
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:51,250
Khalid is certainly in Nepal.

672
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,583
We have to do something.

673
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:56,750
Khatil told us in the interrogation that
Khalid is preparing for a bigger blast.

674
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:58,791
We have to nab him before it happens.

675
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:05,250
Damn it, sir! We have to do something!

676
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,375
I understand what you are saying, Vijay.

677
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,416
Do you think I didn't try?

678
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:15,291
But I am just a part of the system.

679
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,291
I am completely helpless here, Vijay.

680
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:18,875
I am sorry.

681
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:29,333
Every human being born in this world

682
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,708
is born as a Muslim.

683
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:36,958
But due to their parents,
grandparents, and great-grandparents,

684
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:38,625
they turn into infidels.

685
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:44,958
Whenever someone
wants to come back to Islam,

686
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,666
Allah gladly welcomes them.

687
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:53,958
Make sure that you
remember the hymns well.

688
00:59:58,625 --> 00:59:59,833
Welcome.

689
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,666
-Salaam alaikum.
-Salaam alaikum.

690
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:02,875
Wa-alaikum assalam.

691
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,166
-How are you guys?
-Good.

692
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,125
All is well.

693
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:07,916
Please have a seat.

694
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,375
-Brother Khalid.
-Yes?

695
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:17,833
We've been silent for a long time.

696
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,583
The high command has
started questioning us.

697
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,541
The explosion can be the loudest…

698
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,583
only if there is silence.

699
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,708
Listen to this silence.

700
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,291
Boom!

701
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:18,708
<i>The first blast happened at 7:00 p.m.</i>
<i>at Konark Theater.</i>

702
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:24,541
{\an8}<i>Five to six minutes later, there was</i>
<i>another blast at Dilsukhnagar bus stop.</i>

703
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:27,958
{\an8}<i>More than a hundred people are</i>
<i>estimated to be injured in these blasts.</i>

704
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:31,666
{\an8}<i>The situation is excruciating</i>
<i>and the visuals are horrifying.</i>

705
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,875
<i>Our sources tell us that</i>

706
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:37,791
<i>Indian Mujahideen has sent an email</i>
<i>claiming the responsibility for the blast.</i>

707
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:45,041
I'm sorry, Vijay.

708
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,333
You don't need to apologize to me.

709
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,416
You need to apologize to the
families who lost their loved ones.

710
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,666
Rejecting your proposal
wasn't my decision.

711
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,375
But that doesn't make us less guilty.

712
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,250
We all are responsible for this disaster.

713
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,208
We know about Khalid.

714
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,875
Had we nabbed him,
this wouldn't have happened.

715
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,166
Now don't be a coward… and make excuses.

716
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,958
I'm not a coward, Vijay!

717
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,541
The system has made us impotent!

718
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:20,291
It has tied our hands! What can we do?

719
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,541
Tell me!

720
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,333
Let's execute a covert operation.

721
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:32,333
What?

722
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,875
The ministry doesn't
need to know about this.

723
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,125
We can use guerrilla
warfare to nab Khalid.

724
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,333
Vijay, it's not a movie.

725
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,125
Be practical.

726
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:46,166
I am being practical!

727
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,000
Tell me why this is not possible!

728
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:53,916
Adolf Eichmann was responsible for the
death of many Jews during World War II.

729
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:58,166
He was hiding in Argentina using
an alias for 23 years after the war.

730
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,333
Israeli Agency, Musad,
infiltrated Argentina, captured him,

731
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,708
brought him back to Israel
and hung him to death.

732
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,416
If they could do it back in 1967,

733
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,250
why can't we do it today?

734
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,458
Do you really think we
can execute this operation?

735
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,208
Don't worry, sir.
I will bring Khalid back.

736
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,791
You should reconsider your decision.

737
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,958
If you get caught in Nepal…

738
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,166
our department and the
government will disown you.

739
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:35,083
You might have to spend the
rest of your life in Nepal Jail.

740
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,583
You might just die there.

741
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,416
This is a very dangerous mission.

742
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,833
We might lose our life or
end up in jail for the rest of our lives.

743
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:48,250
We won't have any weapons or IDs.

744
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,250
If we die, we remain anonymous.

745
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:53,875
If the mission is successful,
if we bring Khalid back to India,

746
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:57,083
we will remain anonymous.
We won't have a place in history.

747
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:01,625
I am not forcing any of
you to join this mission.

748
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,375
I am doing it and I
have my reasons for it.

749
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,375
If a man thinks he can kill
hundreds of innocent people

750
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,958
and get away with it,
I am not okay with that!

751
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:18,166
I can't live like that!

752
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,666
I am not doing this just for my daughter.

753
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:27,791
I'm doing it for every single citizen
of our country who is living in fear.

754
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,958
I don't want my country to live in fear.

755
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,000
Tell me, what is your decision?

756
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:37,666
Sir…

757
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,750
I have made my decision.

758
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:41,666
I am ready to come with you.

759
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:45,458
This is a role of a lifetime.
How can I give it up?

760
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,291
Sir, my father was an army officer…

761
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,458
and I still remember the day…

762
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:54,500
they told my mother that my dad
lost his life in the line of duty.

763
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:55,875
She didn't cry, sir.

764
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,458
She said, "I have three more sons

765
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,416
who are willing to sacrifice
their lives for the country."

766
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:02,916
Today, my day has come, sir.

767
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,875
I can't think of a better reason to die.

768
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:10,541
I am in.

769
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,083
Hashwanth…

770
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,958
I understand if you don't
want to be a part of it.

771
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:24,500
Sir, can I meet my wife before we leave?

772
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,583
Sure.

773
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:29,250
Sir, what should we name this operation?

774
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Why don't you decide?

775
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,583
Operation Wild Dog!

776
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,250
Bastard!

777
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,333
Hemanth, are you out of your mind?

778
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:45,750
Transferring the NIA funds to Arya
for unauthorized operations

779
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:48,333
without informing the higher
authorities is extremely dangerous.

780
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,625
I could be prosecuted!

781
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,291
Trust me, Vinod.

782
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:52,666
I promise…

783
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:56,750
I'll take complete responsibility
if there's a departmental inquiry.

784
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,625
Okay?

785
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,541
You are taking a huge risk, Hemanth.

786
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,208
They are risking their
lives for the country.

787
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,875
This is the least I could do.

788
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,875
Sir, is this the right place?

789
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,291
Arya has asked us to come here.

790
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:02,875
That must be her.

791
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,416
Boys… run!

792
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,166
-Sir, who the hell are these guys?
-How the fuck would I know?

793
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,708
Arya!

794
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:36,083
-Arya, who are they?
-I don't know.

795
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:57,041
You idiot!

796
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,250
I wanted him alive.

797
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,333
Shit!

798
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:05,375
You killed him!

799
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,708
Who are they?

800
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:13,625
Why did they try to kill us?

801
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,625
How did they know that we are here?

802
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:18,291
Boss, something is really wrong.

803
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,875
Vijay, your lives are in danger.

804
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,458
We must get to a safe house.

805
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,500
She is Arya. She is a RAW agent.

806
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,666
I trust her.

807
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
-I think we need to leave right now.
-Yeah.

808
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,083
Shall we?

809
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:33,125
What about our car?

810
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:08,041
Someone is watching our movements.

811
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:10,500
We need to be careful.

812
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:15,541
Who knew that you were coming to Nepal?

813
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,583
Only DIG Hemanth.

814
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,375
Does that mean DIG Hemanth has…

815
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,041
Shit!

816
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,375
I can't believe this, sir!

817
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,333
Traitor!

818
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,416
All of you, switch off your cell phones.

819
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,666
No one will use their phones.
Arya will get us new ones.

820
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,958
Our cover has been blown.

821
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:42,208
No one will make a phone call to India,
especially to your families.

822
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,083
One more important thing.

823
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:47,166
We need to know who those
four Nepali guys were.

824
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:48,458
We can find out.

825
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:52,166
I have a source. His name is Laxman.

826
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:58,333
<i>Who is Laxman?</i>

827
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,916
He's a senior inspector
at Nepal Intelligence.

828
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,166
He has a strong network in Nepal.

829
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:05,208
He has a lot of connections.

830
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,583
Can we trust him?

831
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:08,916
I have known him for a long time.

832
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,750
He has given me some
information earlier as well.

833
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:24,041
Oh, my God! I must say you
are looking pretty hot.

834
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:27,041
-Did you receive the money?
-Yes.

835
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,250
Okay, then. Let's get to the point.

836
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:31,125
That car belongs to Bomzan.

837
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:35,041
His men attacked you.

838
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,375
Who is Bomzan?

839
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,125
He is a don.

840
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:43,791
His men are involved in shady
businesses all over Nepal.

841
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,875
Why did he attack them?

842
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,666
I have no clue.

843
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:54,916
Where can we find him?

844
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:58,125
Finding him is a difficult task.

845
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,291
I'm sure difficult tasks have a price.

846
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:05,541
Got it!

847
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:09,083
We need some weapons
from the black market.

848
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,333
How many?

849
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:16,750
So many?

850
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,083
Is this some kind of war?

851
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:24,875
Yes, it is a war.

852
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:07,250
Bomzan is coming to Kathmandu tomorrow
via the Chinese border.

853
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:10,083
It's a brown Range Rover
and an escort vehicle.

854
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,583
Okay, thank you.

855
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,041
Sir, the target is
approaching the destination.

856
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:44,625
Almost three kilometers away.

857
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,250
-All stations, get ready.
-Copy, boss.

858
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,958
-Copy that, sir.
-Copy that, sir.

859
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,375
Slow down the car.

860
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:19,041
Sir, I think he's suspicious.

861
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:36,291
Speed up.

862
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,208
Sir…

863
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,416
I had to stop at a hotel.
Target is close to the destination.

864
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,583
<i>Almost 500 meters away.</i>

865
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:53,166
Stop the car.

866
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:55,500
Right now?

867
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:57,458
Okay, I'll come.

868
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,291
Let's go to Pokhara.

869
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:03,291
We are not going to Kathmandu.

870
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,250
Tell the security guard to follow us.

871
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:17,291
Okay, brother.

872
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,875
Something is wrong.
Target has changed the plan.

873
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,166
<i>He's going towards Pokhara, not Kathmandu.</i>

874
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,708
-What?
-Shit!

875
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,541
You handle the escort vehicle.

876
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,458
I'll handle the target.

877
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:32,000
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

878
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:42,500
Oh, no!

879
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,375
Why is she blocking the way?

880
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,833
Hey! Hey, old woman!

881
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,083
Step out of the way! Can't you hear me?

882
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:10,083
Who are you, fucker? Come on!

883
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,250
Show yourself!

884
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,666
This is how you're supposed to
attack, you motherfucker!

885
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:32,833
Who are you?

886
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,875
Now, tell us.

887
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:46,875
Who gave you the order to attack them?

888
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:49,625
Abdullah.

889
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,125
He is an MP.

890
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:54,875
He works for the ISI.

891
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:58,833
He had hired me to kill him.

892
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,791
What do you know about Khalid?

893
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:04,791
Abdullah asked me…

894
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,916
to arrange a meeting
between Khalid and Maus.

895
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,083
The ISI pays him and he
gets explosives in return.

896
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:13,916
Where is Khalid now?

897
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,625
I really don't know where Khalid is!

898
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:18,250
I swear!

899
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:22,208
But Adbullah's son is
getting married in two days.

900
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:24,583
Khalid might attend the wedding.

901
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,041
Call him.

902
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:32,208
Tell me.

903
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,083
I have killed those five Indians.

904
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,291
Good.

905
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,208
What now?

906
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,333
Rest in peace, my friend!

907
01:18:56,958 --> 01:19:00,000
I am unable to contact them.
Their cell phones are switched off.

908
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:02,625
Hemanth, I trusted you
and took a huge risk.

909
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,041
I cannot protect the secret
about our funds for a long time.

910
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,791
-Please, do it for another week.
-How?

911
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,250
You can be on sick leave.

912
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:18,041
I just hope they are safe.

913
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,541
They have left.

914
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:52,500
Copy.

915
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,208
Hey, are you fucking blind?
Is this how you drive?

916
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,916
-Look, ma'am! It was your mistake!
-No, it wasn't!

917
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,666
-Stop cussing, ma'am!
-Shut up!

918
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,500
Who's going to pay for the damage?

919
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,500
-Will you pay? Just shut up!
-It's your fault!

920
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,875
-I'll show you what I can do!
-Yeah, go on!

921
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,666
-We've dealt with many like you!
-Plan activated.

922
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:37,333
It's your fault! How dare you shout at me!

923
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,000
You were driving the car!

924
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,875
Stop talking nonsense, got it?

925
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,166
So what? Just tell me your name!
I won't spare you!

926
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,000
Enough! Look, ma'am!
First, learn to drive properly!

927
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,750
Yeah, I will show you!

928
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:49,708
Let him come!

929
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,125
-Hey, enough!
-Sir, I was just driving…

930
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,250
-and they just crashed into my car!
-I will listen to everyone, ma'am.

931
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:56,208
But we'll have to go
to the police station.

932
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:59,625
-Okay, let's go to the police station!
-You guys will have to come as well!

933
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:15,666
Khalid could be anywhere in there.
Check thoroughly. Be alert.

934
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,875
-Okay, boss.
-Yes, sir.

935
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:17,875
-Ali.
-Sir?

936
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:19,541
Go and wait in the parking lot.

937
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,166
Okay, sir.

938
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:37,125
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

939
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:39,000
Thank you.

940
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,500
Smile. Move to the right.

941
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:51,416
He is not here.

942
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:04,125
Khalid is not here.

943
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:05,875
Thank you.

944
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:07,875
There's no one here, sir.

945
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:12,416
Negative.

946
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,708
Hey! What's up, bro?

947
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:30,291
Someone has arrived.

948
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:34,666
I couldn't see his face
clearly, but it could be Khalid.

949
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:39,875
I will confirm it.

950
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,083
Boys… be alert.

951
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:47,666
Yes?

952
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,125
Okay.

953
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:50,958
Please meet him.
I'll be right back.

954
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,250
Welcome, brother.

955
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,000
Please, come.

956
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,916
Yes… it's Khalid!

957
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,166
<i>Confirmed!</i>

958
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,291
Caleb and Rudra…

959
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,541
<i>go to the balcony.</i>

960
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,875
I'm on my way sir.

961
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,166
Hashwanth… to the reception.
I'm coming there.

962
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,125
Okay, sir.

963
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,875
Bless my children, sir.

964
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:42,708
Thank you.

965
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:46,458
He is my son and she
is my daughter-in-law.

966
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:47,666
May God bless you.

967
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,416
Please, have a seat.

968
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:56,750
Please.

969
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,791
I'm really happy that you made it.

970
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:05,708
Your family is like my own family.

971
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:11,458
Caleb…

972
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:14,041
you'll handle Abdullah security.

973
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,583
<i>Rudra…</i>

974
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:22,625
you'll handle Khalid's security.

975
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:29,416
The moment I get the opportunity,

976
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,458
I will take Khalid and
escape from the backside.

977
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,375
Ali…

978
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:39,416
after you hear the first gunshot,
come to the back entrance.

979
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,375
Okay, sir.

980
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:42,916
Hashwanth, cover me.

981
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,166
Rudra, ready?

982
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:05,083
Caleb, ready?

983
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:10,125
Hashwanth, get ready.

984
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:18,083
Yes.

985
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:20,833
Hey, get some kebabs for Mr. Yousuf.

986
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:25,208
-I hope you're doing well.
-Yes, Allah has really blessed me.

987
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,458
Boys, get ready. On my mark.

988
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:30,875
Three…

989
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:32,541
two…

990
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:35,500
Hey, sir is asking for kebabs!
What are you doing?

991
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:50,041
Yeah, serve it to him.

992
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,958
Mr. Abdullah… something is fishy.

993
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,125
Get ready, boys.

994
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:27,875
Sir, Hashwanth…

995
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,250
Alright.

996
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,083
Sir, he is leaving!

997
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,250
Guys, what's happening?

998
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:56,333
Who are you?

999
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,250
I'm from Lucknow Kebabs.

1000
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,375
Hit him again.

1001
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:04,291
Now, tell me.

1002
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:06,458
Who are you?

1003
01:27:06,541 --> 01:27:09,000
I'm telling the truth…
I'm from Lucknow Kebabs, sir.

1004
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,125
Shoot him!

1005
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:12,583
Grandpa!

1006
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,750
-Hey, drop the gun! Abdullah!
-Adil!

1007
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:20,333
-Adil!
-If you hurt my man, I'll shoot him!

1008
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:22,875
-Please, don't harm him!
-Drop the gun!

1009
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:24,416
-Hashwanth, come on!
-Please!

1010
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,541
-Adil--
-Shut up!

1011
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,458
-No one will follow you.
-Shut up!

1012
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:32,250
No one will follow them.

1013
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,291
I repeat, no one will follow them!

1014
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,708
Adil.

1015
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:39,666
The high command is
worried about your safety.

1016
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:43,916
You will be moved to Islamabad
in the next 48 hours.

1017
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:46,208
Until then, you must stay in a safe house.

1018
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,583
No house is safe.

1019
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,625
They have come all the way from India…

1020
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:55,208
and attacked me in an MP's house.

1021
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,000
Do you think they will stop here?

1022
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:04,833
I will go to Pakistan,

1023
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:08,083
but only after I deal with them.

1024
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:10,958
Do one thing immediately.

1025
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:16,083
Call the Maoists and tell them
that I need their protection.

1026
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,166
Make sure someone leaks this story.

1027
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:20,875
What?

1028
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,416
I'm sure that the source
who is helping them…

1029
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,416
will get his hands on this information.

1030
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:29,291
It's okay.

1031
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,583
They have just five men.

1032
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,000
We have many.

1033
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:36,791
Don't worry. Let them come.

1034
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,083
Bloody shit!
I can't believe we missed him!

1035
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,250
We had almost got him.

1036
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,583
Sorry, sir.
I should've been more careful.

1037
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,375
Vijay, we've received
information from Laxman.

1038
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,416
The Maoists are protecting Khalid.
He's in a forest.

1039
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,041
They're going to move him to their
base in Pakistan in 48 hours.

1040
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:26,041
Shit!

1041
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:28,291
We don't have time.

1042
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,625
Let's move!

1043
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:52,750
Brother… are you sure they
will come to the forest?

1044
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:54,833
One hundred percent!

1045
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:09,625
The rascals are here.
Take your positions.

1046
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:21,708
They're close. Let's go.

1047
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:23,500
Hey, put the fire out.

1048
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:33,375
Fall back!

1049
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,666
Why do you have this scar, Dad?

1050
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:55,500
I was injured in a war.

1051
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:56,541
What is a war?

1052
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:59,333
War means killing bad boys.

1053
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:01,791
They'll kill us if we don't kill them.

1054
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:04,250
What if these bad boys hurt you?

1055
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:06,833
I will kill them.

1056
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:09,333
I will kill all of them.

1057
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:19,291
Assault!

1058
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:03,250
I'll ask you only once.
Tell me, where is Khalid?

1059
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:15,833
Rudra, there are two men on your right.

1060
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,333
Caleb, there is one on your left.

1061
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,875
Eighty-five degrees, south.

1062
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,083
North, three huts.

1063
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:36,041
<i>One tower.</i>

1064
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:42,833
Six targets. North-right.

1065
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:44,291
<i>Five degrees. Bridge.</i>

1066
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:46,041
<i>Five huts.</i>

1067
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:48,000
<i>One bunker.</i>

1068
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:50,333
<i>I'm sure Khalid's here.</i>

1069
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:53,666
Boys, I am moving in.

1070
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:02,375
What happened to you?

1071
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:04,875
Were you shot?

1072
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:09,125
Speak up!

1073
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,500
How did these scoundrels get away?

1074
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,041
Bloody rascals!

1075
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:50,375
Bastards!

1076
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:51,291
Boys!

1077
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:52,291
Grenades!

1078
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:35,458
-Where is Khalid?
-Please, don't kill me!

1079
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,208
Boys…

1080
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:49,125
we've got Khalid's location.

1081
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:52,958
Rudra and Caleb, cover me.

1082
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,125
Okay, boss!

1083
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:57,208
The rest of you, kill them all.

1084
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:58,375
Yes, sir.

1085
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,375
I'm going after Khalid!

1086
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:41,875
Where is Khalid?

1087
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:27,625
Caleb, open it!

1088
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:53,750
Alert all the Nepali forces!

1089
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:57,458
Beef up the security
at borders and airports!

1090
01:38:57,791 --> 01:39:01,500
I want those Indians at all costs!

1091
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:56,166
Arya.

1092
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,250
We must get rid of this truck.

1093
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:02,041
Dump it somewhere and mislead them.

1094
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:03,041
Sure.

1095
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,708
Why is this truck here at this hour?

1096
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:18,375
Call the checkpoint!

1097
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:40,916
Do you feel you have achieved
something great by nabbing me?

1098
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:45,458
What do you think is going to
happen if you take me to India?

1099
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,875
Let me tell you.

1100
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:53,625
They will treat me like a special
guest in a high-security jail.

1101
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,833
I will be served biryani twice a week.

1102
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,875
The newspapers will publish my
photos on their front pages.

1103
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,833
I will get VIP treatment
and Z-category security.

1104
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:05,750
And policemen like you…

1105
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,625
will be guarding me like dogs.

1106
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:14,125
To tell you the truth,

1107
01:41:15,458 --> 01:41:17,750
your nation is lifeless.

1108
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,958
It has got no pride or honor.

1109
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:23,500
I've killed your people like insects,

1110
01:41:24,416 --> 01:41:26,208
but all you can do is arrest me.

1111
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:28,166
You'll keep pleading
to the court to punish me.

1112
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,958
You'll keep moving me
from one jail to another.

1113
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:32,500
Your country is nothing
but a big fat circus!

1114
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:35,875
Don't you have any pride?

1115
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,833
Doesn't your blood boil?

1116
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:44,458
Bloody eunuchs!

1117
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:46,291
You bastard!

1118
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:47,333
Ali!

1119
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:49,833
-Sir, please allow me to do it!
-Ali, no!

1120
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:51,041
I'll kill him right here!

1121
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:53,583
-Come on, kill me!
-Sir, please!

1122
01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:56,125
-Sir, I won't spare him! Please!
-Shoot me! Just shoot me!

1123
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:57,791
Sir, please let me do it!

1124
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:59,458
He is provoking you, Ali!

1125
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:04,708
But we will not kill him!

1126
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:09,083
He doesn't want to come to India.

1127
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,916
He doesn't want to talk about
his organization in jail.

1128
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,541
He doesn't want us to defeat him.

1129
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:20,083
He wants to die like a hero.

1130
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:28,208
Every inch of my body…

1131
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:31,708
is begging me to kill you right now.

1132
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:35,750
But I won't do that.

1133
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:39,083
You'll be an example…

1134
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:43,666
to the people who believe they can
terrorize my country and get away with it.

1135
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,000
You'll remind them

1136
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:50,541
that our country can drag them out
of any tiny hole they choose to hide in!

1137
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,333
I want people like you to know this.

1138
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:58,333
<i>We have noticed suspicious activity, sir.</i>

1139
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:01,541
<i>An unidentified truck has gone</i>
<i>towards the northern belt.</i>

1140
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,958
<i>They could be the Indians</i>
<i>we are looking for.</i>

1141
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:04,958
Commissioner…

1142
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:09,250
<i>I want you to comb the villages</i>
<i>surrounding the forest.</i>

1143
01:43:09,333 --> 01:43:10,875
<i>Get the army into action!</i>

1144
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:12,833
<i>Search every single house.</i>

1145
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:14,541
<i>Search every single area.</i>

1146
01:43:14,666 --> 01:43:17,041
<i>I want those Indians at any cost.</i>

1147
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:18,208
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1148
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:32,000
-How much am I supposed to pay?
-Wait, I'll tell you.

1149
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,333
Hey, listen to me.

1150
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,791
We are looking for five Indians.
Have you seen them?

1151
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:38,208
No, sir. I have not.

1152
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:41,833
You seem to be an Indian.
Have you seen them?

1153
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:42,958
No.

1154
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:46,666
What's the total?

1155
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:47,875
Two thousand rupees.

1156
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:14,250
Where are you going, ma'am?

1157
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,375
Kapan.

1158
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:20,791
That's a lot of stuff.

1159
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:22,333
Yes. It's for my guests.

1160
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:25,250
Okay. You can go.

1161
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:46,083
Vijay, there are policemen everywhere.
They are combing this area.

1162
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:48,500
We need to leave from
here as soon as possible.

1163
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:01,166
You can try as much as you want,

1164
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:04,458
but you'll never be able to
get me out of this country.

1165
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:07,083
You have only two options.

1166
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:10,250
You could either release
me and flee from here…

1167
01:45:10,541 --> 01:45:11,750
or you could kill me.

1168
01:45:20,916 --> 01:45:22,958
We won't go back to India without you.

1169
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,958
It's a promise.

1170
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:48,750
Safe to go!

1171
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:26,625
Listen carefully.

1172
01:46:27,333 --> 01:46:30,291
Every step is really important.

1173
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:34,666
We can't afford to make any mistakes
if we want to succeed in our mission.

1174
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:37,583
Arya, call Laxman.

1175
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:39,458
-Tell me, Arya!
<i>-Laxman!</i>

1176
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:42,291
We're moving towards the Kakarbhitta
border as per your instructions.

1177
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:45,375
Good. I have made all the
arrangements for your escape.

1178
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,000
You won't face any problems.

1179
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:49,208
You'll be able to cross
the border easily.

1180
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,375
All set.

1181
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,833
Boys… let's do this.

1182
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:11,666
<i>Sir, we looked everywhere,</i>
<i>but we couldn't find them.</i>

1183
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,791
They must not cross
the border at any cost!

1184
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:18,875
I want them dead or alive!

1185
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:22,416
Sir, someone wants to see you.

1186
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:25,583
He says he has information
about those Indians.

1187
01:47:26,416 --> 01:47:27,291
What?

1188
01:47:27,375 --> 01:47:29,416
Send him in. Send him in right now.

1189
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:47,000
Sir, I know the location of
the Indians you are looking for.

1190
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:51,791
If you're willing to give me what I
want, I am willing to help you.

1191
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:56,333
If your information about
those Indians is correct,

1192
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:58,375
I will pay whatever amount you quote.

1193
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,750
The Indians you are looking for…

1194
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:05,208
are going towards the Kakarbhitta
border in an ambulance.

1195
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:09,708
Connect me to the Kakarbhitta
Immigration Center.

1196
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:16,041
Arya, we are not taking the
Kakarbhitta border route.

1197
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:19,208
But Laxman said that
it'd be the safest exit.

1198
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:22,041
We can't trust anyone now.

1199
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:36,083
Vijay, where are you?

1200
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:38,166
Sir, we got Khalid.

1201
01:48:40,166 --> 01:48:41,000
That's great.

1202
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,583
We are taking the Sunauli border route.

1203
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:45,166
Meet me there.
Make sure you call for backup, okay?

1204
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,125
Okay.

1205
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:48,958
Now, we will find out who
the traitor really is.

1206
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:49,958
Exactly!

1207
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:51,541
-Vinod
-Yes?

1208
01:48:51,916 --> 01:48:54,958
Send some force to the
Sunauli border immediately.

1209
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:57,041
-Okay.
-They are bringing Khalid.

1210
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:58,791
I'll inform the Home Minister.

1211
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:00,166
-Okay, sure.
-Okay.

1212
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,333
Yes, okay!

1213
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,750
I've just received
information from India that

1214
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:15,125
they are taking the Sunauli
border route, and not Kakarbhitta!

1215
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:19,125
Hello, commissioner.

1216
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:24,833
Send the force to the
Sunauli border immediately!

1217
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:26,041
Right now!

1218
01:49:26,583 --> 01:49:28,708
I wonder what these rascals are up to!

1219
01:49:34,166 --> 01:49:35,250
-Caleb!
-Boss!

1220
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:38,041
We're not taking the Sunauli route.
Take the Hetauda route.

1221
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,416
What? Hetauda?

1222
01:49:47,625 --> 01:49:50,375
But the Hetauda route will
take us to the Raxaul border.

1223
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:51,791
It is a high-security zone.

1224
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:53,625
Getting through the security
on that route is impossible.

1225
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:55,375
That's the reason we
are taking that route.

1226
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:57,625
They won't expect us to take that route.

1227
01:49:58,375 --> 01:49:59,250
Are you sure?

1228
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:36,250
Caleb! Stop the ambulance!

1229
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:38,625
No! Don't stop! Keep moving!

1230
01:51:57,875 --> 01:51:58,750
Sir!

1231
01:51:58,916 --> 01:52:00,458
-Yeah?
-We're at the border.

1232
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:02,708
Okay.

1233
01:52:06,875 --> 01:52:09,375
-Arya, get the defibrillator ready.
-Why?

1234
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:10,833
I know what I'm doing! Come on!

1235
01:52:16,125 --> 01:52:16,958
Do it!

1236
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:23,666
Zap him.

1237
01:52:23,833 --> 01:52:25,166
-But he will die.
-Zap him!

1238
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:52,750
Sir, they're going to take the
Raxaul-Birgunj route to cross the border.

1239
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:53,916
How do you know?

1240
01:52:54,208 --> 01:52:57,625
I was told that they would take the
Kakarbhitta route, but they didn't.

1241
01:52:57,708 --> 01:53:00,250
Your source told us that
they'd take the Sunauli route.

1242
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,416
But that's also wrong.

1243
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,958
So, they'll have to take
the Raxaul-Birgunj route.

1244
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:07,375
By the time we know that the
information we had was wrong,

1245
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:10,125
they would have an eight-hour lead.
We'll be too late.

1246
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:12,416
Please call the Birgunj Police Station.

1247
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:19,666
Alright! Come on, move!

1248
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:21,416
Stop!

1249
01:53:25,375 --> 01:53:26,916
Crap! There are too many cars.

1250
01:53:29,791 --> 01:53:31,041
They're checking thoroughly.

1251
01:53:31,125 --> 01:53:32,416
Can we cross the border?

1252
01:53:38,916 --> 01:53:41,083
Hello. Is this the Birgunj Police Station?

1253
01:53:41,166 --> 01:53:42,000
Yes, tell me.

1254
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:43,458
<i>This is Minister Abdullah.</i>

1255
01:53:43,541 --> 01:53:44,375
Yes, sir.

1256
01:53:44,875 --> 01:53:48,666
Five Indians are crossing
the border in an ambulance!

1257
01:53:49,083 --> 01:53:50,166
Stop them now!

1258
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:51,291
Okay, sir.

1259
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:52,625
Bahadur, let's go!

1260
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:21,416
Plan activated.

1261
01:54:23,041 --> 01:54:24,666
We are from the Indian embassy, Nepal.

1262
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:27,791
We need to get one of our VIPs
to Bihar urgently for his treatment.

1263
01:54:28,083 --> 01:54:29,833
Please let that ambulance go ASAP.

1264
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:46,708
You'll have to talk to
the immigration officer.

1265
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:47,833
-Sure.
-Take them.

1266
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:48,750
Come.

1267
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:50,208
Thank you.

1268
01:55:16,916 --> 01:55:17,750
You can go in.

1269
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:23,125
We are from the Indian embassy.

1270
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:24,208
Please have a seat.

1271
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:29,500
We need to get one of our VIPs
to Bihar urgently for his treatment.

1272
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:30,958
Please let our ambulance go.

1273
01:55:32,416 --> 01:55:33,333
Pick up the phone!

1274
01:55:33,666 --> 01:55:37,708
Look, sir. Everyone has
to follow rules and regulations.

1275
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,583
Pick up the phone!

1276
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:44,000
Pick it up, damn you!

1277
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:50,625
I don't care about your
bloody rules and regulations!

1278
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:53,041
Excuse me! Please mind your language!

1279
01:55:53,125 --> 01:55:54,000
Oh, really?

1280
01:55:54,083 --> 01:55:55,125
Looks like you wouldn't budge.

1281
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,125
Let me call the PM's office right now.

1282
01:56:12,958 --> 01:56:13,791
Excuse me.

1283
01:56:14,916 --> 01:56:17,125
Please, wait.
You don't need to call anyone.

1284
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:19,416
I'll see what I can do.

1285
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:23,458
Hey, check the ambulance
back there very carefully.

1286
01:56:23,666 --> 01:56:26,083
-Let me know if everything is alright.
-Yes, sir.

1287
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,583
-Sir!
-Yeah?

1288
01:56:32,666 --> 01:56:33,666
They're coming!

1289
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:40,666
Arya, do it quickly! Come on!

1290
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:48,208
Faster, Arya!

1291
01:56:48,833 --> 01:56:49,750
He is dead!

1292
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,250
Keep doing it!

1293
01:57:01,125 --> 01:57:02,083
Don't stop!

1294
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:08,583
Doctor, please do something!

1295
01:57:08,916 --> 01:57:10,083
Please, save my brother!

1296
01:57:10,166 --> 01:57:11,041
Doctor!

1297
01:57:12,166 --> 01:57:13,375
You can't let him die!

1298
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:15,208
-His condition is critical.
-Doctor!

1299
01:57:21,958 --> 01:57:22,875
He is back!

1300
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:24,125
-Yeah.
-Thank God!

1301
01:57:26,708 --> 01:57:28,416
It is an emergency! Please, let us go!

1302
01:57:38,083 --> 01:57:39,500
-Step on it!
-Yes, sir.

1303
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:40,916
<i>Sir, the ambulance is alright.</i>

1304
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,666
Let the ambulance pass.

1305
01:57:45,875 --> 01:57:46,750
Sir…

1306
01:57:46,916 --> 01:57:47,791
you may go.

1307
01:57:49,333 --> 01:57:50,291
Thank you.

1308
01:57:50,583 --> 01:57:53,125
Boss, we are crossing the border.

1309
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:12,708
I've direct orders from the minister.
Don't let any ambulance cross the border.

1310
01:59:12,791 --> 01:59:14,750
What? One ambulance
just crossed the border.

1311
01:59:19,916 --> 01:59:20,750
Did you get them?

1312
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:22,958
Sir, they have already crossed the border.

1313
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:25,833
Oh, no!

1314
01:59:30,958 --> 01:59:32,958
CHIEF BUILDING

1315
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,958
HAIL INDIA

1316
01:59:47,916 --> 01:59:49,958
HAIL INDIA

1317
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:16,833
What is he doing here?

1318
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:20,333
Boss, Hemanth?

1319
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:36,125
<i>Sir, our mission has been compromised.</i>
<i>We have a rat in our department.</i>

1320
02:00:36,208 --> 02:00:39,541
<i>I'm the only one who knew about</i>
<i>this mission. Who could be the rat?</i>

1321
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:42,000
They've got Khalid.

1322
02:00:42,083 --> 02:00:43,666
I'll inform the Home Minister.

1323
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,083
-Okay.
-Okay.

1324
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:50,583
-Are you sure?
<i>-Absolutely!</i>

1325
02:00:50,833 --> 02:00:52,166
Yes, okay.

1326
02:00:53,458 --> 02:00:55,666
Tap Vinod's phone calls and messages.

1327
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,166
Yeah, okay.

1328
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,958
I'm proud of you, Vijay!

1329
02:01:34,291 --> 02:01:35,291
I'm not the only one…

1330
02:01:35,375 --> 02:01:37,125
but the whole country is proud of you.
