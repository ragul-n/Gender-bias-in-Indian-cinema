Anyway, did you get the watch I asked you for?

What happened to that?

You lost it?

132
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,383
You don’t seem to value gifts.
Why should I give you any?

133

Sorry.

Don’t cry. I know you would cry like this...

140
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,717
Hey, haven’t you stopped smoking?

141

Dad! Dad!
-Hey, no!

143
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,508
Hey, careful. It will burn.

144
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,383
Bro, an English poet once said...

145
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:09,133
‘The relationship with a cigarette is far better
than the relationship with the people around you.’

146
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,800
I still don’t understand why he said that, bro.

147
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:15,800
Don’t work your brain so hard.

148
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,550
His was trying to say that some people
come into our lives to stay with us lifelong.

149
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:24,008
But in the end, even if we beg them to stay,
they will leave us and go.

150
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:29,133
But the one thing that comes without intimation
and stays till the end even if we ask it to leave is a cigarette.

151
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,175
Is there so much meaning to this?

152
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,717
How come I never understood it, bro?

153
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:34,675
It doesn’t matter if the guy who wrote it was intelligent.

154
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,925
The one reading it should be one too.

155
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh!

156
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,175
No one is inside!

157
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,842
Hey, who do you think it is?
-What if it is uncle?

158
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,383
Then you go and open the door.
-No. You go.

159
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,383
Shall we open the door together?

160
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,050
Whose bathroom is this?

161
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:50,758
Go open the door!

162
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,592
Hey, Happy. Where are you going?

163
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:55,217
Come here.

164
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,883
Hey! If he asks, say we have lit incense sticks.

165
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,467
Why would we light incense in the bathroom?

166
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,467
I don’t know what the hell I am saying.

167
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:09,133
Hey, what are you doing here at this time?

168
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,258
It won’t be good if someone sees us like this.

169
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,008
Stop. I can’t breathe!
Wait a minute!

170
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,675
Isn’t it!

171
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:17,467
This is how I left when you were not here with me all these days.

172
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,883
How many stories you told me when we were in college!

173
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,008
‘Neha, I cannot spend a moment without you'.

174
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,342
Five years!
It’s been five years!

175
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,258
But did you even come to India once to see me?

176
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,383
You even asked me not to come to the airport to see you.

177
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,758
I knew this would happen if you had come to the airport.

178
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,050
That’s why I asked you not to come.

179
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:38,342
Not just you.

180
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,633
Every day I was in the US, I missed you a lot too.

181
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:42,675
Do you understand?

182
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:46,675
Shall I tell you something?

183
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:50,592
There’s a magic in having a long-distance relationship.

184
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:55,258
All the sadness you feel when you are apart...
Disappears the moment we are together.

185
00:15:56,258 --> 00:15:56,925
Isn’t it?

186
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,717
Haven’t you stopped jumping walls?

187
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:34,133
For you my darling.
I have been waiting.

188
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:41,383
Never tired, no boundaries
But time is never enough.

189
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:48,758
The sweet evidence of love
Has made us one.

190
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,675
Even the dark night sky lights up like a full moon
When you smile.

191
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:56,467
After I found you in my heart
I have forgotten about myself.

192
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,175
For you my darling.
I have been waiting.

193
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:12,633
Never tired, no boundaries
But time is never enough.

194
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:03,758
My heart sings love songs
When it looks into your eyes.

195
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:11,050
My eyes watch your beauty and
are lost in your curves.

196
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,633
You are always, in my eyes, in my dreams,
and in my every thought.

197
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:22,967
In the beginning, in the end,
in every moment of time,

198
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,717
Darling, you are always with me.

199
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:33,717
The sweet evidence of love
Has made us one.

200
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:37,633
Even the dark night sky lights up like a full moon
When you smile.

201
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:41,425
After I found you in my heart
I have forgotten about myself.

202
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:48,300
For you my darling.
I have been waiting.

203
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:55,758
Never tired, no boundaries
But time is never enough.

204
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:37,633
Happy...

205
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:39,383
come and sleep.

206
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:42,717
Ah!

207
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,675
What is all the commotion about?

208
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,758
Wait, I’m coming.

209
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:48,178
Happy!

210
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:49,470
Happy! Don't shout.

211
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:51,553
Hey, what..?

212
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:54,803
Hey, everyone is sleeping.

213
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:55,678
Come.

214
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:57,803
What's your problem?

215
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:32,553
Brother...

216
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Priya, what happened?

217
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:15,637
Priya, I am asking you.

218
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,262
I’m pregnant, brother.

219
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,595
You wanted to die for this?!

220
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:38,595
If you had said the same thing three months after
you got married, the whole house would have celebrated.

221
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:43,220
Give me your phone, let me talk to Ravi.

222
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,637
It’s not Ravi’s.

223
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,137
I didn’t understand. What did you say?

224
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:52,720
It’s not Ravi’s.

225
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,220
Then whose is it, Priya?

226
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:06,637
Tell me, Priya.

227
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,970
I will fall at the feet of our parents, your in-laws
and my brother-in-law if I have to, to convince them.

228
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:15,678
Tell me who it is, Priya.

229
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:19,345
I don’t know, brother.

230
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,970
It’s okay, Priya.
You can tell me.

231
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,345
I am telling you I will take care of it.

232
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,262
I truly don’t know who it is, brother.

233
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:36,178
Did you go to a party?

234
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:37,428
Did something happen there?

235
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,053
Whatever it is, Priya, you can tell me.

236
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,553
I am telling you I will take care of it.

237
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:41,678
Whatever it is.

238
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,345
I don’t know, brother.

239
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:45,887
Hey!

240
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:49,095
I’ve been asking you for some time now.

241
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:50,845
Why are you just repeating that?!

242
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:54,262
I am telling you, whatever happens,
I will take care of it!

243
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:57,762
How can a woman get pregnant without
her knowledge?

244
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,762
You tell me. I don’t know how she can!

245
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:02,053
Do you know how a woman can
get pregnant without her knowledge?

246
00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:04,678
Tell me, Priya!

247
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:29,970
Pinky promise.

248
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,595
I honestly don’t know how it happened.

249
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,678
What is it, brother-in-law?
Why did you ask me to come here so urgently?

250
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:16,470
Write down the patient’s name
and your relationship to her.

251
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,678
He’s writing down that he is her brother.

252
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:21,012
I have never seen them write anything else.

253
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,887
Brother in law...

254
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:28,053
Excuse me.

255
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:29,178
Not her brother.

256
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:30,678
Write that I’m her husband.

257
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,220
She’s my wife.

258
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:39,387
Sorry, sir.

259
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,178
Shut up!

260
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:55,053
I know what I’m doing is wrong,
but it doesn’t feel wrong brother-in-law.

261
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,220
About this...
-No one needs to know about it.

262
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,803
Go inside. I’ll come.

263
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,887
Priya, don’t cry. Quiet now.

264
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:11,262
Quiet now, dear. Don’t cry.

265
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:14,178
Why are you crying for this?

266
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:15,470
This is all common.

267
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,428
Is she a small girl?
She is feeling bad she’s leaving after her wedding.

268
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:20,470
Why are you all surrounding her and
making her feel worse?

269
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,095
Stop it!

270
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:24,678
Dad?

271
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:27,720
Mom! You are crying and are making her cry too.

272
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,095
Have you come?
come on. You go.

273
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,095
Uncle, come on. You go.
-Come. Come. Let’s go.

274
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:32,053
Go on now, mother.
Come. Let’s go.

275
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,387
Go on now. Go on.
-Uncle, take them along.

276
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:35,220
Let’s go.

277
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,012
You go on now, uncle.
Let’s go, uncle.

278
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:41,470
Bring her soon.
I'll take care everything. You go on.

279
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:44,720
Mom, you are the reason behind all these..
Dad, you tell me.

280
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:47,637
I’ll bring her. You carry on.

281
00:26:58,512 --> 00:26:59,970
Are you still thinking about it?

282
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:01,678
Come out of that now.

283
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,428
Forget about the past.
Think about the future.

284
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:08,012
The house you are going to, a loving husband...

285
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,637
from tomorrow onwards, your life will be very good.

286
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,887
Trust me.

287
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:18,178
When the man you want to spend your life with is with you,
I don’t know why you are still so sad about.

288
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:25,553
When you were crying we got worried, but that’s fine.

289
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:26,845
See...

290
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,012
When you are crying now, look how worried they are.

291
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:34,595
To die, one good reason is enough.

292
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:39,470
But to live all we need is one person to love us.

293
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,887
You have two families who love you.

294
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:47,303
Do you understand?

295
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,595
If anything happens to you...

296
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,678
Oh, what is this?

297
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:04,137
Hush now.

298
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:08,095
Ah! Our daughter is here.
-Look. My darling daughter is here.

299
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,553
Mom, this is my sister's wedding!

300
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,845
How can each one be like this?
Look, how nice Priya looks.

301
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:27,053
"You are just looking like that..."

302
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,220
"Just Like a beautiful doll."

303
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,470
"You are just looking like that..."

304
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,720
"Just Like a beautiful doll."

305
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:45,470
"Trying to walk while holding on
to your brother’s finger."

306
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:50,553
"With a spark in your eyes...
With hopes in your heart..."

307
00:28:50,803 --> 00:28:55,220
"You have now grown to be
a beautiful blushing bride."

308
00:28:55,345 --> 00:29:00,053
"You have become the air that we breath."

309
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:04,553
"Do I become naughty like you now?"

310
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:09,845
"Thadhim Dhim Tanaka Dhimtha Dhimthaka
Behind the groom."

311
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:14,678
"Thadhim Dhim Tanaka Dhimtha Dhimthaka
A queen is walking."

312
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,553
"Till the in-laws’ house"

313
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,637
"Taking the seven steps."

314
00:29:54,012 --> 00:30:03,053
"Two hearts came together as one
and have made them a couple."

315
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:12,845
"A dream that I didn’t know I had is
coming true this every moment."

316
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:18,470
"Even though we are separate,
I am like the shadow that is always with you."

317
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:23,512
"He is the companion to your coy laughter."

318
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:28,345
"Even though our precious is going away."

319
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:32,803
"You have found a partner to
whom you are precious too."

320
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:38,012
"Thadhim Dhim Tanaka Dhimtha Dhimthaka
Behind the groom."

321
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,845
"Thadhim Dhim Tanaka Dhimtha Dhimthaka
A queen is walking."

322
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,720
"Till the in-laws’ house"

323
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,803
"Taking the seven steps."

324
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:56,720
Thanks.

325
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:03,137
I thought this wedding would never happen.
Only because of you I am on my way to my new life.

326
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:11,178
I want to forget everything and be happy,
just like you said.

327
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:15,553
But...

328
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,762
without knowing what happened to me...

329
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:28,220
You will be happy.

330
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:30,845
Go Priya.

331
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:41,803
Namaste.
See you again.

332
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,637
See you again, brother-in-law.
-Namaste. Okay, brother-in-law.

333
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:14,137
Hey throw the ball.

334
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,553
Hey catch it.

335
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:17,970
Take it.

336
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,595
Hey, make him out.

337
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:23,220
Catch it.

338
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,262
<i>There was one guy who was</i>
<i>after her in high school, brother.</i>

339
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:27,803
Make him out.

340
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,720
Hey, you missed it.
-Brother, wicket.

341
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:49,262
We are playing, right?

342
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,178
Hey! See who it is.

343
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:13,095
Hey! who it is?

344
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,678
Okay. I’ll come, mother.

345
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,678
I can’t get up!

346
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,012
Can’t you hear? Have you gone deaf?!

347
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,137
Hey! Who are you?!

348
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:48,553
Hey! Who are you?!

349
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,303
Do you recognise her?

350
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,095
No, I don’t?!

351
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:03,262
Yes, I remember. Priya!

352
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:04,637
She’s Priya, right?

353
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,803
Bro! I know her.

354
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:09,887
It’s true that I stalked her.
But then I didn’t see her again.

355
00:36:11,678 --> 00:36:12,345
It’s true, brother.

356
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:14,137
I was studying abroad and I just got back the other day.

357
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,428
Leave me! Please!

358
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,220
Please...

359
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:17,178
True.

360
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:28,470
After him, there was a senior in college
who told her that he loved her.

361
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:36,095
Hey! Who are you?!

362
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:37,137
Why are you hitting me?!

363
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:59,012
Hey! What do you want?!

364
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:37,428
No! Stop it!

365
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:42,470
Hey! Why are you hitting me?!
Hey! No! Please!

366
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,428
What do you want?

367
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,428
Do you remember her?

368
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:46,970
This girl?!
-Do you remember her?

369
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,678
It’s true I followed her around in college,
but no matter how hard I tried she never responded.

370
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:53,137
So I stopped, brother.

371
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,678
Please, I don’t know anything!
Leave me!

372
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:59,137
There was another guy on Facebook
who disturbed her a lot, brother.

373
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:01,303
He used to send her many abusive messages.

374
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:05,012
Even though she blocked him, he would still
send her messages from different accounts.

375
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:32,095
Hey! Who are you?!
Why are you hitting me?!

376
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:36,512
Hey, do you know who this girl is?

377
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,303
Do you recognise her?

378
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,762
She’s Priya Vadlamudi, know?

379
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,887
I understood, brother. I stopped messaging her.

380
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:44,845
Tell me the truth!

381
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,012
I am telling you the truth!

382
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,720
Tell me the truth!
-It’s true!

383
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,970
I am telling you the truth.
It’s true, brother!

384
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,720
One minute, brother!

385
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:59,303
Here. If you want you can check my chat with her.

386
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:03,428
Because she wasn’t responding to my messages,
I stopped messaging her.

387
00:40:04,262 --> 00:40:05,387
It’s the truth, brother.

388
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:17,359
<i>[Recollecting the dialogues]</i>

389
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,609
Hey, what happened, son?

390
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,984
Oh my! What is this blood?
-Nothing happened, mom.

391
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,484
What do you mean nothing happened
when you are losing so much blood?!

392
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:33,942
Come, let’s go to the hospital.

393
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,359
Mom, don’t worry. I am telling
you nothing has happened!

394
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:36,609
Don't talk...come along...

395
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,901
I have written medicines for three days.
Don't worry. It will be healed soon.

396
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:44,484
I’ll be back, mom.

397
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,567
Be careful.

398
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:47,442
Hello?
-Hello.

399
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:48,734
Neha... Tell me.

400
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:52,151
Gana, it’s my friend Shruthi’s birthday.
She’s invited the both of us. She insists that you come.

401
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,526
I can’t come today. You go.

402
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:54,526
Hey, why not?

403
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:56,942
I am telling you that I can’t come today, Neha!

404
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,734
Where are you now?
-I’m in the hospital.

405
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:00,276
Hospital? What happened?

406
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,984
Nothing. I scratched my hand and
mom was worried that...

407
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,609
<i>My name is Keerthi.</i>

408
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,651
<i>Mom, dad, please forgive me.</i>

409
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:30,776
<i>I have done no wrong.</i>

410
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:35,151
<i>I never had a lover or a boyfriend.</i>
<i>But the doctor said I am pregnant.</i>

411
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,942
<i>I truly don't know how this happened.</i>

412
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:39,776
<i>As soon as I heard this, I didn't know what to do.</i>

413
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:41,734
<i>I thought this is the only way.</i>

414
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:42,859
Gana?

415
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:44,484
Mom.

416
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,401
I just saw this girl...just now...
-Mom, you come here.

417
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:48,817
Ganesh, Inform to police.

418
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:50,234
I just saw this girl...just now...
Mom, you come here.

419
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:51,026
Mom...
-Gana...

420
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:53,984
Come this way, mother.
-Gana, what happened to her, poor girl!

421
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:56,317
Taxi.

422
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:00,484
Come.

423
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:02,734
Sit down. Please, mother.
-How sad for that girl!

424
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:04,984
Careful.

425
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:13,942
Brother, do you have a water bottle?

426
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:14,484
Yes, sir.

427
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:15,901
Please give me one.
-That girl...

428
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:19,109
Mom, have some water.
First, drink.

429
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:21,692
Drink, mother!

430
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:29,442
I can’t show my face to my parents at home.

431
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,359
Please, madam! Please do the abortion, madam.

432
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:33,984
We cannot do anything without
your parents’ permission.

433
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:34,984
I saw her begging the doctor.

434
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:36,359
Sorry, I can’t do anything.

435
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,484
Even the doctor was saying that without any
older family members around, she cannot do the abortion.

436
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,901
Without any thought, if they do something like this...

437
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:49,526
what will happen to the parents like us,
whose children mean the world to them?

438
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:56,317
Having a girl child in this generation,
taking care of them till they are old enough to get married...

439
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:58,734
is not an easy thing, Gana.

440
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:01,067
What if something like this happened in our house...
-Mom! Please, stop, mother.

441
00:43:01,817 --> 00:43:02,817
Our Priya is gold!

442
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:05,401
She will never let something like that ever happen to us.

443
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:13,651
Is the writer here?

444
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:14,901
There he is.

445
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:19,317
Sir, my name is Gana.

446
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:20,692
You called me this morning.

447
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:21,484
Sit down, son.

448
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:24,359
Your father called me.

449
00:43:24,984 --> 00:43:26,484
All the formalities are done.

450
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:27,734
The papers will come.

451
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:30,234
If you sign the papers, you can claim the insurance.
-Ok Sir.

452
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:31,567
Hey, order for some tea!

453
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:34,609
'Jabardasth' comedy show.
You will get a burst of laughter.

454
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,984
Sir, we can’t find our daughter since last night!

455
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:43,609
Yes, sir.

456
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:44,609
I am a little busy.

457
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:46,109
Hey, 402. See what they want.

458
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:47,567
Sir?

459
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,359
I am going to the court to submit these, sir.

460
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,067
602? See what is it they want.

461
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:53,859
Sir, it’s our daughter’s missing case.

462
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:55,901
The writer is looking into all these missing cases.

463
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,484
Writer sir?
Look into this case, sir.

464
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,942
Sir, since last night we cannot find our daughter.

465
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:06,109
Sir, since last evening,
my daughter hasn’t returned home.

466
00:44:07,901 --> 00:44:11,859
Sir, we are telling you we can’t find our daughter
and you are looking at your phone?

467
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:13,859
You wait, dear.

468
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:15,984
Here you go.

469
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:27,276
Your daughter’s name, her phone number,
the name of her college...

470
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:31,442
Your daughter’s friends, their names,
their phone numbers, their addresses...

471
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:33,526
Write them down. We will start the enquiry.

472
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,776
If we find her, we will inform you.

473
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:40,067
We wrote them down.

474
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:42,026
Please find her!

475
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:43,734
Madam, didn’t I make it clear to you.

476
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:45,609
If we find her, we will inform you.

477
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:46,234
That’s it.

478
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,609
Sir, it’s not that. She’s a girl.
-He said he will, right.

479
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:50,442
Let's go.

480
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:56,776
Sir, tea.

481
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:10,609
An animal that eats grass at least gives us milk.

482
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,901
You have taken a bribe from them.

483
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,609
Couldn’t you at least properly assure
them you will find their daughter?

484
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:15,734
What if the same happens in your house?

485
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:18,776
What, sir? Is this some sort of social responsibility?

486
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:22,317
Anyone who sees a Policeman wants
to make a snarky comment.

487
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:27,609
Everyone is after us for taking bribes.
But what about those who give them?

488
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:32,984
These days, missing people’s complaints have become
cheaper than the pamphlets distributed on the roads.

489
00:45:32,984 --> 00:45:35,276
Anybody and everybody come and lodge a complaint, sir.

490
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:36,442
Very cheap.

491
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:43,317
See, all these missing complaints?

492
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:44,901
At least ten per day.

493
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,317
Look how many we get per day.

494
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:50,776
One says, my son’s gone missing.

495
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,484
The other says, my daughter’s gone missing.

496
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:54,984
Another complains that he’s lost his dog.

497
00:45:55,109 --> 00:46:03,026
We feel like crows in uniform, get fed up searching
the streets for months, trying to finding these people.

498
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,609
And we keep informing them.

499
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:06,026
When we finally do not find them...

500
00:46:06,026 --> 00:46:10,484
With sadness in our hearts, before we even can say,
‘Sorry, we couldn’t find your daughter...

501
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:15,067
They laugh and say, ‘oh, dear constable,
are you still enquiring about our daughter?’

502
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:19,151
‘The day we lodged a complaint,
she came back home on the very same day, sir.’

503
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,734
‘We forgot to inform you. Sorry, sir.’

504
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,609
They say this laughing at us and hang up.

505
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,526
When they lodge a complaint that
their daughter is missing,

506
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:30,109
don’t they know they need to
take their complaint back once she’s returned?!

507
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:32,317
It’s not us who are stupid, sir,
these people are!

508
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:34,151
Everyone wants to point fingers at us!

509
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:36,567
Hey, get me another tea. This tea has gone cold.

510
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:58,276
Sir, please sign it.

511
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:09,609
Venkojipalem, near Hanuman Temple.

512
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:10,276
Okay.

513
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:27,026
Hello?

514
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:29,776
I’m calling you from the police department.

515
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:30,359
Tell me, sir.

516
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,026
You gave a complaint that your
daughter is missing, know?

517
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:32,609
What happened?

518
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:35,067
Sir, she came back on the very same day.

519
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:36,067
But I forgot to take the complaint back, sir.

520
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:37,401
Hey! Auto! Auto!

521
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:40,234
Hey! Auto! Hey!
-Hey, can you please stop!

522
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,859
Hey! Auto!

523
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:44,109
Sir! Sir! Sir!

524
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,984
Son, my daughter’s in the hospital.
Can you please drop us there?

525
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:48,567
Get in.

526
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,276
Get in.

527
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:53,609
Thank you, son.

528
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:54,901
Please go to Omni hospitals.

529
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:13,942
Doctor?

530
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:29,901
Nothing to worry about.
t’s a small issue called Hypoglycemia.

531
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:31,234
Don’t worry.

532
00:48:31,234 --> 00:48:36,026
When the sugar levels or the sodium levels
of the body drastically fall, this happens.

533
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:37,651
Just ask your daughter to eat well.

534
00:48:37,651 --> 00:48:38,692
Thank you, doctor.
-Okay.

535
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:40,151
Let’s go.

536
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:43,901
Why don’t you listen? You keep going
on these ridiculous diets.

537
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:45,026
Eat well!

538
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:46,734
Sir, you called me from the department, know?

539
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:49,859
Yes, tell me.

540
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,859
I called back because the line
got cut while we were speaking.

541
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,442
Can I speak to your daughter once?
-One minute, sir.

542
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,067
Hello, Sir?
-What happened that day?

543
00:48:57,276 --> 00:49:02,609
That day, when I was waiting for my
bus at Gajuwaka, I felt very weak, sir.

544
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:06,609
I just closed my eyes.
I don’t know what happened afterwards.

545
00:49:06,984 --> 00:49:09,526
When I awoke, I saw that I was in
a hospital on the beach road.

546
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:10,359
Which hospital?

547
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,109
Prerna Hospital, sir.

548
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:28,692
Sir, namaste.

549
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:31,526
You are...?

550
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:32,859
I...

551
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,442
came here to talk to you about
your daughter Keerthi.

552
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,317
Please sit, son.

553
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:42,234
Your daughter Keerthi.
-Will you have some water?

554
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,567
Give him some water.

555
00:50:00,776 --> 00:50:02,442
I want to talk to you about your daughter...

556
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:03,734
First, have some water.

557
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:10,317
Your daughter Keerthi...

558
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,234
You can leave, sir.

559
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:17,484
Sir, but I want to talk about what happened to...
-What is it, sir?

560
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:20,942
My daughter had an affair with someone.

561
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:22,817
She got pregnant.

562
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:24,692
She was betrayed.

563
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,067
Isn’t this what you want to say?

564
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:31,442
The police that just left a while ago,
said the same thing.

565
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:38,026
Not just them, from the paperboy to every
stranger on the road is saying the same nonsense!

566
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,942
I am tired of listening to it.

567
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:44,109
Why are you so interested in the death of a young girl?

568
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:49,401
Won’t you rest till you create hundreds
of rumours and a thousand stories about her?

569
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:52,276
Please leave, now.

570
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:03,276
What is this, sir?

571
00:51:03,484 --> 00:51:07,567
This is about the time my daughter
fainted three months ago.

572
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,776
Someone admitted her in a hospital.

573
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,942
These are her reports.

574
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:20,692
Mom...

575
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,776
when I was in the US,
you told me Priya was in the hospital.

576
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:24,526
What had happened?

577
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:26,651
That’s enough!

578
00:51:27,276 --> 00:51:30,901
Look, just like you, she too didn’t eat well and fainted.

579
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:31,609
Eat well.

580
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:48,067
Yes, tell me.
-Hi.

581
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:51,067
Did a girl call Sadhana, get admitted
in the hospital three months ago?

582
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:51,817
One second.

583
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,192
Yes, she was.

584
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:55,401
Who admitted her?

585
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,151
It was an emergency.

586
00:51:57,151 --> 00:52:00,026
Generally, all emergency cases come in an ambulance.

587
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,484
Can you give me the details of the ambulance?

588
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:02,567
Are you the police?

589
00:52:02,692 --> 00:52:03,192
No.

590
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:07,234
Sorry, we cannot give this information
out to anyone except to the police department.

591
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,901
Did a girl call Lakshmi, get admitted here?

592
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:17,567
They brought her here in an ambulance, sir.

593
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:19,234
Can you give me the ambulance details?

594
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:21,276
Sorry, sir. We cannot give you that information.

595
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:58,734
Five months ago, a girl called Monica was admitted here.

596
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:00,442
One minute, five months ago?

597
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:04,609
They brought her to the emergency.

598
00:53:05,317 --> 00:53:06,776
On an ambulance?
-Yes, sir.

599
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:35,276
Hey, Veerayya, I think tomorrow is not good.

600
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,401
Tomorrow is very good.

601
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:40,817
Tomorrow, everyone will be occupied
in the festivities of Immersion.

602
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,942
By tomorrow morning we should catch the fish.

603
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:22,567
Tell me, Neha.
-I'll call you later.

604
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:24,484
Why did you call me then?

605
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:28,859
No, Gana. My friend Shruthi,
is admitted in the hospital because she had fainted.

606
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,817
That is what I am talking about.
Can I call you later?

607
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:31,692
Which hospital?

608
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:37,942
What happened?

609
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,734
Sir please sir...
Madam please.

610
00:54:41,317 --> 00:54:42,401
Sir please go.

611
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:43,901
Where is Shrithi?
-Sir please clear sir.

612
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,817
Madam please... clear.
Sir please sir...

613
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:49,817
Ok, all clear.

614
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:52,526
Excuse me.
-Yeah.

615
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:53,234
What, Madam?

616
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:55,609
Did you see a girl in a white dress
that was just here?

617
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,192
Yeah. That girl in a white dress?
- Yes.

618
00:54:57,192 --> 00:55:00,526
That girl suddenly fainted,
so I called for an ambulance.

619
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:01,692
They have just taken here.

620
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:02,776
Where..?
-That way.

621
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:05,359
Shruthi...

622
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:07,526
Shruthi...

623
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:09,651
I am tensed, Gana.

624
00:55:09,692 --> 00:55:10,942
Why do they not bring her yet?

625
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,234
Is this the hospital?
-Yes.

626
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,734
I saw the name on the ambulance.

627
00:55:13,734 --> 00:55:14,609
Did you see it correctly?

628
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:15,234
Yes, I did.

629
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,609
Hello? Where is the technical department?

630
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,901
Where is the technical department?!

631
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:22,942
That way.

632
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:26,317
Sai, give him the information
whatever he needs.

633
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:27,026
Okay, sir?

634
00:55:27,026 --> 00:55:28,151
Okay sir.
-Thank you, sir.

635
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:30,234
How many ambulances do you have?
-Nine, sir.

636
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,651
Do all of them have trackers?
-Yes, sir.

637
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:33,234
Open all of them.

638
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:40,151
One is at downstairs, but the others are all out.

639
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,359
On one side of the mall is the sea.

640
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:44,359
The city is steeped in the festivity.

641
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:47,442
As far as I can tell, there is no way they can
go for more than 5 km in this crowd.

642
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:50,734
Circle a 5 km radius around the mall.

643
00:55:51,234 --> 00:55:51,817
What, sir?

644
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,776
From the mall, circle a 5 km radius on all sides!
-Okay, sir.

645
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:00,442
There are five of them, sir.

646
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:08,026
Neha, guide me with the directions.

647
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:08,526
Ok.

648
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:11,859
<i>[Crowd chatter]</i>

649
00:56:26,692 --> 00:56:29,692
Gana, they are going from
Daspalla junction towards Jagadamba.

650
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:30,234
Okay.

651
00:56:32,151 --> 00:56:32,859
I’m right here.

652
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:35,776
Hey! Hey! How can you block an ambulance!
Who are you?

653
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:37,651
Ah? Who are you?!

654
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,442
Neha, Shruthi is not in this ambulance!

655
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:40,984
Is it?

656
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:43,151
An ambulance is just crossing Siripuram junction.

657
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,067
Okay. Okay, I’m on my way.

658
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,942
Gana! Gana, they have taken a left from
Sampath Vinayaka temple towards the flyover.

659
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:49,942
flyover.
Okay.

660
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:51,276
Gana, they are right in front of you.

661
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:52,317
Ah? What?

662
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,984
They are 100 meters away from you.

663
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:55,567
What? A 100 metres?
-Yes!

664
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:09,651
Hey, stop!

665
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:11,151
Stop!

666
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:13,109
She’s not in this one as well.

667
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:13,984
What? She’s not in that one as well?

668
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:16,526
Madam, towards the railway station...
-Gana, there is another ambulance going towards the railway station.

669
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:17,067
Okay.

670
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:22,526
Neha left or right?!

671
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:24,192
Left. Left. Take the left, Gana.
-Ok.

672
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:29,442
Gana, they are very close to you.
-I am going.

673
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:32,942
Hey! Who are you?!

674
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,651
Who are you?

675
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:34,442
Neha, She’s not in that one as well!

676
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:38,609
Gana, there is an ambulance near Alipuram junction
post, that is not moving for some time now.

677
00:57:38,984 --> 00:57:40,567
I think that is the one we are looking for.
-Okay, I’m on my way.

678
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:42,817
Hello, Neha.

679
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:43,942
Yeah?

680
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:45,776
If the ambulance moves from that spot,
call me immediately.

681
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:46,276
Okay... Okay.

682
00:57:57,276 --> 00:57:58,317
Neha, there is no one in this ambulance as well.

683
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,317
Hello, sir. Who are you?

684
00:58:03,526 --> 00:58:04,817
Where is this girl?

685
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:07,109
I don't know sir.
Sir, my vehicle has been here since the breakdown.

686
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,151
Gana! Listen.

687
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:09,817
Tell me.

688
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:11,942
There is an ambulance going towards Rose Hill.

689
00:58:11,984 --> 00:58:12,567
Okay. I’ll go.

690
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:21,442
Take left.

691
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:27,401
Take right.
-Right?

692
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:31,359
Keep going straight.

693
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:38,651
Take a left.

694
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:41,151
Take a left, Gana.

695
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:41,984
left?

696
00:58:43,526 --> 00:58:44,651
Keep going straight.

697
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,609
Gana, why have you stopped?!

698
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:54,734
This is a dead-end, Neha.

699
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,192
Do something. We are running out of time.

700
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:01,859
Gana, listen.
The ambulance has stopped near the signal.

701
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:03,442
Hurry up. Make it fast. Go!

702
00:59:03,526 --> 00:59:04,234
I am going.

703
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:35,442
Gana...
-Tell me.

704
01:00:35,442 --> 01:00:36,734
the ambulance is moving from there.

705
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:51,734
Oh, no! You crossing it.
You’ve crossed it, Gana!

706
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,484
What do you mean I’ve crossed it?
-Yes, you’ve crossed it.

707
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,817
There’s nothing in front of you.
The ambulance is going behind you.

708
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:15,442
The ambulance is crossing you on your right side.
You are not moving, Gana.

709
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:16,984
Move fast!
Move fast!

710
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:19,317
Hello? Gana?

711
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:21,942
Talk to me. Hello?
Can you hear me? Gana?!

712
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:24,567
"Ashwathama..."

713
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,109
"Ashwathama..."

714
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,859
"Ashwathama..."

715
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:17,151
Who the hell are you?!

716
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:26,526
"An angry man
With fire in his eyes.."

717
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:29,984
"Fierce warrior
This fearsome man."

718
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:34,026
"Like the timeless Lord Shiva
A hero who’s like a torrent!"

719
01:02:34,026 --> 01:02:37,526
"He doesn’t spare wicked and cruel people."

720
01:02:38,859 --> 01:02:40,901
Hey, he’s no ordinary fish! He’s a piranha.

721
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,901
Hey! Give me that halberd!

722
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:45,026
Here, take it!

723
01:02:47,734 --> 01:02:49,442
"Ashwathama!"

724
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:53,692
"Ashwathama!"

725
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:57,359
"Ashwathama!"

726
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:03,734
"He has unexpected intelligence."

727
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:07,359
"His life is like an invincible
electric current!"

728
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:11,567
"His mental strength is stable like the
arrow of the Sagittarius!"

729
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:15,151
"His determination is a Tsunami."

730
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:19,026
"He is always there to protect."

731
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:22,817
"His life’s mission is to
fight for the truth."

732
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,984
Hey, guys come on...

733
01:03:31,984 --> 01:03:33,401
Come fast...

734
01:04:15,692 --> 01:04:19,442
"Waste fellow, useless fellow...
you don’t care for relationships."

735
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:21,526
"You don’t even consider their age!"

736
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:23,234
"It’s enough if she’s a woman."

737
01:04:24,984 --> 01:04:28,026
"Lower your gaze, down!"

738
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:34,276
"Who do you think a woman is?
She’s the Divine Feminine!"

739
01:04:34,276 --> 01:04:38,234
"When you come in front of the divine mother,
with the respect..."

740
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,234
"Bow your head down."

741
01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:46,859
Do you know this girl?

742
01:04:49,984 --> 01:04:50,651
Tell me.

743
01:04:50,776 --> 01:04:54,567
I took this girl, sir!
But after they gave me money to let her go, I did.

744
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,234
I swear.

745
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,109
I don’t know more than that, sir!

746
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:00,609
Who asked you to let her go?!

747
01:05:02,276 --> 01:05:02,817
Who?

748
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,192
Who asked you to let her go?!

749
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:13,734
Tell me!

750
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:28,526
Hey, let's go.

751
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:35,276
There is someone else apart from him.

752
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,359
Who is it?

753
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:51,411
Neha, I’ll be right back.

754
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:57,495
This guy is not an ordinary fish. He’s a piranha!

755
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:00,620
I was the one who took that girl.

756
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:03,078
But after they gave me money and
asked me to let her go, I did.

757
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,536
Doctor, Sir...

758
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,911
A postmortem case...
It's an emergency, Sir.

759
01:06:23,828 --> 01:06:26,203
Don't you know that we cannot do
a postmortem after 6pm?

760
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:27,911
I am sorry.

761
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:31,536
Sir, please sir... It's an emergency.

762
01:06:33,495 --> 01:06:34,828
She is the Judge's daughter.

763
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,786
Ok, get ready.

764
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:52,245
Body is get... heavier after death.

765
01:07:00,453 --> 01:07:02,036
Bodies get...

766
01:07:03,036 --> 01:07:04,786
heavier after death.

767
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:27,745
I wish it moved just a bit.

768
01:09:01,495 --> 01:09:03,328
Hey, with a corpse?!

769
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,870
A human has a desire.

770
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:09,411
Beast has longing.

771
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:12,453
A Beast doesn’t care if it is alive or just a corpse.

772
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:14,328
Only whether his desire is satisfied or not.

773
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,411
Kumar...
-I am here, sir.

774
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,620
Seshaiah
-I've come.

775
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,245
Daniel?
-Ah!

776
01:09:28,328 --> 01:09:29,578
Seenayya?
-I’m here.

777
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:33,036
Hey, you donkey! How can you go
without telling me you are here?

778
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:34,995
I can only write down, f you tell me.

779
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:37,245
When you can see such a grown-ass man in
front of you, do we have to tell you too, grandfather?

780
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:37,911
Write it down.

781
01:09:38,328 --> 01:09:40,036
Joseph?
-Here, grandfather!

782
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:41,078
Manikyam?

783
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:42,036
I’m here.

784
01:09:42,203 --> 01:09:43,911
Grandfather, what is this?

785
01:09:43,911 --> 01:09:45,578
Everyone is saying they are here and then they leave.

786
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:47,453
The ocean is like our mother.

787
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:52,620
Every morning we trust the ocean
and go into it to fish.

788
01:09:52,745 --> 01:09:58,078
Sometimes, mother ocean absorbs
a few of her children back into her.

789
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,495
She lets people she doesn’t need back to the shore.

790
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:06,036
We can catch the fish in the ocean,
but we cannot be the ocean, sir.

791
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:10,995
That is why we keep track of all those
who come and go into it every day.

792
01:10:11,078 --> 01:10:12,828
By the way, who are you, sir?

793
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,661
I came from the election survey, old man.

794
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,620
How many people live in your area?

795
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:23,703
There are 390 houses.

796
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:26,786
In that 207 fishermen who live here.

797
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:29,120
Does that mean everyone is
back from the ocean?

798
01:10:29,995 --> 01:10:32,203
Here, The kingfish you asked for.

799
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:33,620
Go give it to mother.

800
01:10:34,453 --> 01:10:35,453
Hey, Ramudu?

801
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,995
I haven’t seen David, Ravi, Chandu and
Veerayya, in two days.

802
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,120
Have you seen them in the ocean?

803
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,828
Don’t know.
I have been on the north side of the ocean.

804
01:10:45,953 --> 01:10:47,703
Maybe they are on the south side.
I don’t know.

805
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,786
Okay.

806
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,661
Anyway, 12 people are there in the ocean,
They should be back today or tomorrow.

807
01:10:53,578 --> 01:10:54,828
Do one thing, sir.

808
01:10:54,953 --> 01:10:58,411
Why don’t you come back tomorrow morning
and get your work done?

809
01:10:58,911 --> 01:10:59,828
I’ll take your leave now.

810
01:11:05,453 --> 01:11:06,370
Tell me, grandfather.

811
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:07,536
Son, I mean...

812
01:11:07,953 --> 01:11:10,161
Don’t, grandfather... done for today.

813
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:11,203
Not that, son.

814
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,995
I heard someone stopped our
ambulance and hit them I believe.

815
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,120
Okay, come home.

816
01:11:16,328 --> 01:11:18,078
Get them along with you.

817
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:26,745
Who are you?
-Is this Shivashakti Travels?

818
01:11:27,578 --> 01:11:28,453
The building at the back.

819
01:11:28,745 --> 01:11:29,745
Okay, sir. Thank you.

820
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:30,245
Come on.

821
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:33,370
Don't know why everybody comes here
and asks Shivashakthi travels.

822
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:44,536
Hello.. sir.

823
01:11:44,536 --> 01:11:45,911
Come in. Come in.
-You are our god, sir.

824
01:11:45,995 --> 01:11:48,328
Because of you our kids are
studying in a convent school.

825
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,245
All of you have come home for the first time.

826
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:53,328
Come, we shall have lunch together.

827
01:11:53,411 --> 01:11:54,995
Oh no! With you?

828
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:57,120
It’s okay, sir.

829
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:01,286
You have worked hard for me all these days.

830
01:12:01,953 --> 01:12:03,453
Can’t we at least eat together?

831
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:04,786
Please, sit down.

832
01:12:05,328 --> 01:12:06,036
Sit. Sit.

833
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:08,703
Sit.

834
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:10,536
Please. Even you.

835
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,036
Please be comfortable.

836
01:12:17,786 --> 01:12:20,036
Grandfather?
-Oh, yes, sure, son.

837
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:27,328
I got this fish made especially for you.

838
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:29,911
Please eat.
Come on. Come on.

839
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:40,203
Please eat.

840
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,328
Eat.

841
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:46,495
Don’t hesitate.

842
01:12:47,036 --> 01:12:47,870
Eat.

843
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:54,620
What actually happened?

844
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,286
Don’t know, sir.
We don’t know who he is.

845
01:12:57,495 --> 01:12:59,411
He just came and rammed into us.
-Yes, sir.

846
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:00,703
Yes, sir.

847
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,495
I understood.

848
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,328
You want to make good with them
so that you can kill him, isn’t it?

849
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:20,328
Don’t worry, sir.

850
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:22,411
Next time we won’t leave him. We will kill him!

851
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:24,203
Ah, yes. We will kill him.

852
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,161
Eat first.

853
01:13:29,286 --> 01:13:32,828
These guys are like a bridge between him and me.

854
01:13:33,953 --> 01:13:36,411
So, I think after they eat, I will kill them all.

855
01:13:40,995 --> 01:13:43,620
Go on. Only after you finish eating.

856
01:13:45,495 --> 01:13:48,161
Oh, come on!
Eat!

857
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:54,078
You didn’t try the chicken?

858
01:16:14,228 --> 01:16:19,686
Don’t you see? Death feels so much
better in your hands.

859
01:16:45,228 --> 01:16:47,186
Don’t look at me like that.

860
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,228
You will put an evil eye on me.

861
01:16:49,811 --> 01:16:57,895
Eyes that have seen the Devil and God,
has no right to see anything else, grandfather.

862
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,520
That’s why I put them to sleep.

863
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,520
Did they see you ?!

864
01:17:06,811 --> 01:17:07,603
No, son.

865
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,103
No, son... They haven’t seen me.

866
01:17:10,895 --> 01:17:11,686
You don't get caught.

867
01:17:11,686 --> 01:17:12,936
Okay.

868
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,103
Don’t know at what time his mother gave birth to him...
that he was born with the cruelty of 100 Kauravas in him.

869
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:27,186
Oh, God!

870
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,945
This is my uncle Veeraiah's boat.
Get down.

871
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:38,278
Hey, you go back and start again.

872
01:17:42,611 --> 01:17:44,278
I was the one who took that girl.

873
01:17:44,611 --> 01:17:45,986
Hey, what you did was wrong.

874
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:47,195
Hey, Chinna...

875
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:48,403
whose boat is this?

876
01:17:48,445 --> 01:17:51,070
This one? It is my uncle’s Veerayya.

877
01:17:52,528 --> 01:17:54,153
Do you know where his house is?
-Hey, get up.

878
01:17:57,611 --> 01:17:59,320
How much further?
-Almost there, brother. Come.

879
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:05,070
Aunty, someone has come to see uncle Veerayya.

880
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:09,778
I have come from the election survey, madam.
Can you please call your husband?

881
01:18:10,778 --> 01:18:13,361
He’s not here, sir.
It’s been two days since he left to go fishing.

882
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,445
As far as I know, he should be back today or tomorrow.

883
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:19,361
Can you give me a glass of water?

884
01:18:20,486 --> 01:18:21,486
Ah? Yes, please come inside.

885
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,445
Come.

886
01:18:30,278 --> 01:18:30,986
Here you go.

887
01:18:32,153 --> 01:18:34,820
Rajamma? You said you would give me the money.
-Yes, wait. I’ll be right there.

888
01:18:37,778 --> 01:18:39,195
Sir, please sit, I’ll be back.

889
01:18:57,486 --> 01:18:59,903
That...that watch..,

890
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:01,945
I lost it.

891
01:19:13,657 --> 01:19:14,032
Mother...

892
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:15,699
Gana, where are you?

893
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:17,157
I am at outside.

894
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:19,866
Today Rakhi festival, right?
That's why your sister is here.

895
01:19:20,116 --> 01:19:20,657
Come fast.

896
01:19:54,407 --> 01:20:02,824
"My heart is silent because
it doesn’t know who it is."

897
01:20:03,449 --> 01:20:11,824
"The pain I feel deep in my heart."

898
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:16,657
"If the darkness of the night, fall on you..."

899
01:20:16,657 --> 01:20:21,032
"Shall I turn into the light?"

900
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:29,574
"No matter who chases you away
I am always with you."

901
01:20:33,282 --> 01:20:36,532
"Like a shadow."

902
01:20:37,907 --> 01:20:40,199
"Like a companion."

903
01:20:42,366 --> 01:20:49,657
"Like a supporting brother."

904
01:21:02,574 --> 01:21:05,491
Aunt, see how cute Gana is in this photo.

905
01:21:07,949 --> 01:21:09,949
This was the photo we took when Priya was born.

906
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:14,407
He was adamant that no one could see his sister,
till his father got there.

907
01:21:14,407 --> 01:21:17,824
No one can see my sister until my father gets here.
He locked the door and stood guard.

908
01:21:27,907 --> 01:21:29,449
Before you come, couldn’t you knock first?

909
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:31,991
I didn’t know we had such formalities between us, Gana.

910
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:32,782
Sorry.

911
01:21:32,907 --> 01:21:33,366
Sit.

912
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,574
Did you like the gift I gave you the other day?

913
01:21:40,949 --> 01:21:42,116
I saw it, Neha. It’s very nice.

914
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:45,991
You lie to those who believe in your words.
Not to those who know you.

915
01:21:48,616 --> 01:21:50,366
I was too busy to look at it.

916
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:51,907
If you didn’t see it, then tell me that.

917
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,657
Why did you have to lie to me that you saw it?

918
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:56,907
Neha, that is what I am trying to tell you.
I was caught up in some work and I didn’t have the time to see it.

919
01:21:56,907 --> 01:21:58,366
Let me see. I will see it right away.

920
01:21:58,449 --> 01:21:58,907
Give it to me.

921
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,241
Give it here. Give!

922
01:22:06,907 --> 01:22:07,532
It’s a nice gift.

923
01:22:08,074 --> 01:22:09,949
Why are you behaving so weirdly, Gana?

924
01:22:10,032 --> 01:22:12,741
I am not behaving weirdly, Neha.
I am normal.

925
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:14,074
You are definitely not normal.

926
01:22:14,074 --> 01:22:19,282
You used to call me to tell me,
Neha this happened, Neha that happened...

927
01:22:19,907 --> 01:22:25,324
But now... every time I call you,
you tell me you are busy and hang up rudely.

928
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:29,032
You were so happy when you told me that we
were going to get married, after your sister’s wedding.

929
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:30,782
What happened to that Gana?

930
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:32,199
Talk to me!

931
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:34,157
Are you planning to leave me?

932
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:38,616
If you wanted to leave me halfway,
then why did you bring up the topic of marriage?!

933
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:40,616
Why did you convince your family and mine?

934
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:42,241
Talk to me, Gana.

935
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:43,782
Do you understand my pain?

936
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:45,282
You also have a sister, right?

937
01:22:45,532 --> 01:22:47,824
What if some had used her like this and left her?

938
01:23:02,657 --> 01:23:03,491
What do you want me to say?

939
01:23:04,282 --> 01:23:06,282
I found my sister about to kill herself
two days before her wedding.

940
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:07,199
Do you want me to tell you that?

941
01:23:08,324 --> 01:23:11,241
Do you want me to tell you that she was
pregnant before she was married and didn’t know how?!

942
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,866
There are some things which one cannot share
not with the woman they love...

943
01:23:18,241 --> 01:23:19,866
but even with their own mother.

944
01:23:23,241 --> 01:23:24,907
With these hands I had Priya abort her pregnancy.

945
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:28,657
It’s a punishment worse than death.

946
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:30,782
But the one responsible for all this...that Idiot...

947
01:23:30,782 --> 01:23:32,699
the anger that he is living happily somewhere.

948
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:34,157
Who do I tell this to?!

949
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:35,574
Neha, who do I tell this to?!

950
01:23:50,866 --> 01:23:58,574
"Even though I see tears in your eyes,
I will be there to wipe them for you."

951
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:07,782
"No matter how heavy your heart feels
I will be there to carry your burden."

952
01:24:09,116 --> 01:24:16,824
"The questions that come to you,
I will be your answer to them."

953
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:21,616
"Like a shadow."

954
01:24:22,741 --> 01:24:25,907
"Like a companion."

955
01:24:27,449 --> 01:24:34,741
"Like a supporting brother."

956
01:24:36,407 --> 01:24:39,657
"Like a shadow."

957
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,324
"Like a companion."

958
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:52,782
"Like a supporting brother."

959
01:24:53,824 --> 01:24:55,616
Yeah, yeah. I’m coming. I’m starting now.

960
01:24:55,616 --> 01:24:56,157
Sister! Sister!

961
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,241
Come fast!
-Sister? Sister?

962
01:24:57,574 --> 01:24:58,699
You look good, sister.

963
01:24:58,782 --> 01:24:59,407
Thank you.

964
01:24:59,532 --> 01:25:01,532
But the body spray you use is horrible, sister.

965
01:25:02,157 --> 01:25:04,449
I have a nice spray for you, sister.
Look here, sister.

966
01:25:09,032 --> 01:25:10,282
It’s nice.
-It’s only Rs. 200, sister.

967
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:12,366
But I only have Rs. 500 notes with me.

968
01:25:14,991 --> 01:25:16,241
I don’t have any change with me, sister.

969
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:17,032
Keep it.

970
01:25:18,324 --> 01:25:19,032
Thank you, sister.

971
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:41,574
A incident in the financial capital of Visakhapatnam.

972
01:25:41,574 --> 01:25:44,241
The kidnapped victim,
Bommadevara Sowmya's dead body has surfaced.

973
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:47,116
The criminals have dumped the body in front of
the police station creating a stir in the city.

974
01:25:47,116 --> 01:25:48,657
Gana, watch the news on TV.

975
01:25:52,866 --> 01:25:56,032
City commissioner, Rajnath Takur
is personally looking into this case.

976
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:59,741
Yes, brother. I am at the Minister's house.

977
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:13,699
Damn this life! They spend millions
of rupees building houses.

978
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:15,282
They can’t even give us a cup of coffee.

979
01:26:15,282 --> 01:26:18,574
If they don’t pay attention to anything but themselves,
what else will the kids do apart from running away?

980
01:26:20,407 --> 01:26:21,866
Brother, give me a cup of tea.
-Okay, Sir.

981
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:24,116
Why are they so many people here, bro?

982
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:25,199
What do you want me to say, sir?

983
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:26,824
It’s been 6 hours since the girl has gone missing.

984
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:28,532
Now they have leisurely come to give us a complaint.

985
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,324
These fools don’t know that people
can cross countries in 6 hours, sir!

986
01:26:31,366 --> 01:26:32,824
But my senior officers are to be blamed, sir.

987
01:26:32,949 --> 01:26:35,199
If a wealthy man gives a complaint, means that’s it.
They cannot control themselves.

988
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,449
And they stress us out!

989
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:40,449
<i>All PS alert... All PS alert...</i>

990
01:26:41,074 --> 01:26:45,407
<i>The black colour Honda City used by Bommadevara</i>
<i>Sowmya has been spotted in West Vizag.</i>

991
01:26:45,407 --> 01:26:46,241
<i>All PS alert...</i>

992
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:47,407
This is our lives, sir.

993
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:48,574
They don’t even give us time to have a cup of tea.

994
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:49,949
Damn! What kind of life is this?!

995
01:26:50,157 --> 01:26:51,366
I wish I was a day labourer somewhere.

996
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:04,199
Hello, Neha?

997
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:10,199
You are?

998
01:27:10,741 --> 01:27:12,074
Uncle, I’m Sowmya’s friend.

999
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:14,449
Where is aunty?
-She’s upstairs. You can go.

1000
01:27:14,741 --> 01:27:15,407
Okay, uncle.

1001
01:27:16,574 --> 01:27:18,616
Dear, one minute.

1002
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:23,199
She hasn’t eaten anything since morning.

1003
01:27:23,574 --> 01:27:24,866
Please try to feed her something.

1004
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:26,241
Okay.

1005
01:27:54,657 --> 01:27:56,866
Gana, I am in the girl’s room
-Good. Good. Good.

1006
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,407
What kind of phone is she using?

1007
01:27:58,407 --> 01:27:59,491
How will I know that?

1008
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,949
There must be a company charger in the
electric socket next to her bed. Look!

1009
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,616
I see it. One minute.

1010
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:07,699
It’s an iPhone.

1011
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:11,866
All iPhone users sync their back up data
to the iCloud or their iPads.

1012
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:12,616
See what is there around.

1013
01:28:13,907 --> 01:28:16,032
There’s a laptop here.
-Open it.

1014
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:19,782
It’s asking for a password.

1015
01:28:19,866 --> 01:28:21,157
Password? Password? Password?

1016
01:28:21,616 --> 01:28:22,782
What do you see around you?

1017
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:27,199
Dolls, pens, pictures with her parents...

1018
01:28:27,532 --> 01:28:29,241
There are more pictures with her mother, Gana.

1019
01:28:30,032 --> 01:28:31,074
Her mother’s photos.

1020
01:28:31,074 --> 01:28:32,407
Raghupathi Raju... Prabhavathi...
-<i>[Tv News]</i>

1021
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:35,324
Her mother’s name is Prabhavthi.
Try typing Prabhavathi.

1022
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:38,824
Password is wrong.

1023
01:28:46,616 --> 01:28:47,824
Try 5004 once.

1024
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:48,407
Are you sure?

1025
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,616
How do I know? Her car number is 5004. Try it!

1026
01:28:53,782 --> 01:28:55,407
Gana, wrong password.

1027
01:28:56,574 --> 01:28:59,241
Sir, we need to check your daughter’s personal belongings.

1028
01:28:59,866 --> 01:29:01,699
Shanthi?
-Sir?

1029
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:04,074
Take him to Soumya's room.
-Thank you, sir.

1030
01:29:04,657 --> 01:29:05,616
Come this way.

1031
01:29:11,366 --> 01:29:12,699
This too is the wrong password.

1032
01:29:13,032 --> 01:29:13,866
One minute, stay on the line.

1033
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:17,032
Instagram.

1034
01:29:21,866 --> 01:29:23,324
Try ‘Justin’ once.
Justin?

1035
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:26,199
J-U-S-T-I-N. Justin. Try it!

1036
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:31,699
Gana, it’s opened!

1037
01:29:31,782 --> 01:29:34,241
Now quickly transfer all the data to me.

1038
01:29:42,032 --> 01:29:43,116
That’s the room.

1039
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:13,824
Do you know anything about Sowmya?

1040
01:30:14,032 --> 01:30:14,657
Not yet, madam.

1041
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:16,449
We will try to get some information this evening.

1042
01:30:16,657 --> 01:30:17,074
Okay.

1043
01:30:17,157 --> 01:30:18,866
We need to check her belongings.

1044
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:19,991
Thank you, madam.

1045
01:30:34,907 --> 01:30:37,741
<i>Hey, babe...</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

1046
01:30:38,116 --> 01:30:40,241
<i>And don't forget Red bull drink.</i>

1047
01:30:55,157 --> 01:30:56,116
Where is your surveillance room?

1048
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:56,907
There, sir.

1049
01:31:03,032 --> 01:31:04,324
Open the first camera.

1050
01:31:04,366 --> 01:31:04,949
Okay, sir.

1051
01:31:05,282 --> 01:31:05,907
The second one?

1052
01:31:07,866 --> 01:31:08,949
Hmm...opening the camera in the parking area.

1053
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:09,741
Yeah, Sir.

1054
01:31:13,074 --> 01:31:15,366
The girl seems to have started from here, but...

1055
01:31:15,616 --> 01:31:16,824
Can I check the CCTV camera footage once again?

1056
01:31:16,824 --> 01:31:17,491
Who are you?

1057
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:19,116
I’m from the Media. I’ve come here with them

1058
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,824
Is it? Come with me.

1059
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:21,366
Ok.

1060
01:31:24,782 --> 01:31:25,407
Play this.

1061
01:31:25,616 --> 01:31:27,032
Okay, sir. This one?

1062
01:31:29,449 --> 01:31:30,991
Play the B camera.
-Playing it now, sir.

1063
01:31:31,824 --> 01:31:32,157
Pause it.

1064
01:31:34,282 --> 01:31:34,824
Zoom in.

1065
01:31:37,907 --> 01:31:38,657
Who is that guy?

1066
01:31:39,032 --> 01:31:40,866
He sells flowers at near the signal.

1067
01:31:40,991 --> 01:31:41,407
Thank you.

1068
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:43,991
Have you seen this girl?

1069
01:31:44,782 --> 01:31:46,949
Oh yes! I also sold her a spray.

1070
01:31:47,866 --> 01:31:48,824
Do you sell sprays too?

1071
01:31:49,032 --> 01:31:51,241
No, brother. But that day an old man asked me too.

1072
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:04,199
One...four...five.

1073
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:06,282
Son? Come here, please.

1074
01:32:06,366 --> 01:32:07,324
What is it, Grandpa?

1075
01:32:07,616 --> 01:32:08,741
I am feeling dizzy.

1076
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:11,282
Can you please sell these sprays for me?

1077
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:14,157
I will give you fifty rupees.

1078
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:17,532
Okay, fine. Give it to me.

1079
01:32:24,866 --> 01:32:26,491
Look properly. Is this the old man you saw?

1080
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:27,741
Yes, this is him, brother.

1081
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,157
Think carefully and tell me.

1082
01:32:29,616 --> 01:32:31,782
Is this him?
- Yes, brother. I remember him well.

1083
01:32:32,532 --> 01:32:34,532
<i>What is the relationship with those</i>
<i>fishermen and this old man?</i>

1084
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:38,282
If I found him... then that old man is found easily.

1085
01:32:38,574 --> 01:32:39,866
He went fishing and never came back!

1086
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:43,074
He betrayed me!

1087
01:32:46,366 --> 01:32:47,074
What happened?

1088
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:50,157
I told you that day that,

1089
01:32:50,282 --> 01:32:52,282
that another 12 people have to come back from the sea.

1090
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:57,949
Everyone is back except for Ravi,
Chandu David and Veerayya.

1091
01:32:58,532 --> 01:33:00,324
It’s been over a week now.

1092
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,949
We don’t believe they will ever come back.

1093
01:33:03,282 --> 01:33:06,032
That is why all the women-folk at home are crying.

01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:35,741
Do you think dumping a body in front

Hey! What are you doing?

1111
01:34:34,324 --> 01:34:35,241
She’s a drug addict

1112
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:39,241
A normal dose of anaesthesia is not enough for drug addicts.

1113
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:43,366
That is why she is conscious. She’s seen me.

1114
01:34:44,824 --> 01:34:46,949
If she gets out, I will be caught.

1115
01:34:47,491 --> 01:34:49,449
I shouldn’t be caught.

1116
01:34:49,782 --> 01:34:51,324
I need to kill her.

1117
01:34:51,324 --> 01:34:52,866
I need to kill her.

1118
01:34:52,907 --> 01:34:55,032
She should not be alive...

1119
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:06,199
Hey, you fool!

1120
01:35:06,407 --> 01:35:08,074
What are you doing?! Wait.

1121
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,991
She knows about me now.
She should not be alive...

1122

Are you going to kill her?

1123
01:35:13,991 --> 01:35:15,657
Otherwise? Do you think I will let her go?

1124
01:35:15,907 --> 01:35:21,074
If I let her go, it’s like giving my
address along with my door number.

1125
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,949
If you kill her now, it will become a huge issue.

1126
01:35:23,949 --> 01:35:25,907
If I let her go, when she’s out...

1127
01:35:26,949 --> 01:35:28,574
she will make an even bigger issue.

1128
01:35:28,574 --> 01:35:29,782
Hey, don’t be impulsive.

1129
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:31,449
We’ll think about it.

1130
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:32,824
It is not wrong to commit a crime.

1131
01:35:33,782 --> 01:35:35,449
It is wrong to leave a witness.

1132
01:35:36,532 --> 01:35:38,032
That's why I am going to kill her.

1133
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:42,741
Can’t you understand?!

1134
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:47,491
Don’t you understand what I am saying?!

1135
01:35:48,074 --> 01:35:49,491
I've already told you ...

1136
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:55,907
The eyes that see the Devil or God,
they are never allowed to see anything else!

1137
01:35:56,032 --> 01:35:57,657
No! You will get caught!

1138
01:35:57,657 --> 01:35:58,782
No, I won’t!

1139
01:35:58,991 --> 01:36:01,324
Hey! Who are you?
- I am talking here!

1140
01:36:01,574 --> 01:36:02,407
Shhhh...

1141
01:36:03,324 --> 01:36:03,907
Shut up.

1142
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:37,782
Do you know why demon Ravana was killed?

1143
01:36:38,116 --> 01:36:39,532
Because he kidnapped Sita.

1144
01:36:43,366 --> 01:36:45,157
No. No.

1145
01:36:48,157 --> 01:36:50,532
It is because he didn’t finish off Jatayu.

1146
01:36:50,782 --> 01:36:52,824
Had he killed Jatayu completely,

1147
01:36:52,824 --> 01:36:59,824
Rama would not have known that it was Ravana
who kidnapped Sita and that he was going towards the South.

1148
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:24,449
Hey, you have made a grave mistake!

1149
01:37:24,574 --> 01:37:28,949
All these days, you brought girls here and after
your desires were satisfied, you used to leave them in the hospital.

1150
01:37:29,032 --> 01:37:31,991
Because they were alive, no one had a doubt.

1151
01:37:32,032 --> 01:37:34,616
Now if this girl is not found, the Police will become alert.

1152
01:37:34,657 --> 01:37:36,199
What will you do with her corpse now?

1153
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:39,366

It’s not connecting.

1162
01:38:15,491 --> 01:38:18,699
Oh, sorry. I haven’t looked at my phone.

1163
01:38:18,699 --> 01:38:20,032
You must have heard the news.

1164
01:38:20,574 --> 01:38:24,032
They have killed Bommadevara Raghupathi
Raju’s daughter and dumped her in front of the police station.

1165
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:26,907
You have to perform the autopsy on that body.

1166
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:30,032
Okay. You carry on.
I will be right there.

1167
01:38:30,574 --> 01:38:31,449

There are a hundred hospitals
to make even a last stage man live.

1172
01:39:09,782 --> 01:39:14,199
But, after he dies, even if he’s the CM or
the son of a CM...

1173
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:18,407
their corpses have to come to me only.

1174
01:39:22,699 --> 01:39:25,616
Now, do you understand?

1175
01:39:34,014 --> 01:39:41,223
<i>In all my career, my hands shook for the</i>
<i>very first time while performing an autopsy on a body.</i>

1176
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:46,889
The culprit hit her head multiple times
with an iron rod and killed her.

1177
01:39:46,889 --> 01:39:48,514
He’s definitely not a human.

1178
01:39:48,764 --> 01:39:51,973
To dump a body he murdered in front of the police station...

1179
01:39:54,056 --> 01:39:55,889
Look at his bloody confidence.

1180
01:39:58,056 --> 01:40:01,598
He’s openly challenging that no one can catch him.

1181
01:40:01,598 --> 01:40:05,264
I request all the policemen to find him immediately.

1182
01:40:05,389 --> 01:40:08,598
I will give my 100% support to the police department.

1183
01:40:08,723 --> 01:40:11,514
If anything like this happens in the future,
please come to me.

1184
01:40:11,723 --> 01:40:13,889
My deepest condolences to her parents.

1185
01:40:16,223 --> 01:40:17,556
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

Girls who have gone missing.

1190

Sadhana, Keerthi, Sowmya...
Priya is also among them.

1191
01:41:03,889 --> 01:41:05,973
Like, so many girls are missing out.

1192
01:41:06,181 --> 01:41:09,931
There is no personal, professional or
mutual contact between any of them.

1193
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:11,181
They are not even acquaintances.

1194
01:41:11,264 --> 01:41:14,181
There is no reason for him to select them

1195
01:41:14,181 --> 01:41:18,098
Priya went missing in Bombay Colony but
was found admitted to an RK hospital in Gajuwaka.

1196
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:22,514
Sadhana went missing in Seethamadhara
and she was found in a nursing home, close by, in Isukathota.

1197
01:41:24,223 --> 01:41:28,598
Sanjana went missing in Mindi and she was
found admitted in Mindi’s Krishnamoorthy’s hospital.

1198
01:41:30,014 --> 01:41:31,764
All of them were admitted with only one reason.

1199
01:41:34,098 --> 01:41:38,598
Hypoglycemia, that is when the sugar levels
in the body fall, the body gets dehydrated and the person faints.

1200
01:41:39,056 --> 01:41:42,223
If there were one or two people who joined
with this condition, then I wouldn’t have paid attention to it.

1201
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:45,431
But every girl who got admitted
was admitted with the same reason.

1202
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:48,764
That is when I changed my perspective with
which I looked at the issue.

1203
01:41:49,306 --> 01:41:51,014
And then I started researching for this.

1204
01:41:51,223 --> 01:41:54,389
I came to understand that,
one can induce a hypoglycemia state.

1205
01:41:55,014 --> 01:41:55,598
I’ll explain you.

1206
01:41:56,098 --> 01:42:00,931
In 1960, a scientist called Robert D’souza
invented a drug called Hypomacene.

1207
01:42:01,473 --> 01:42:04,681
The reason he invented this was to reduce weight.

1208
01:42:05,181 --> 01:42:08,556
As soon as you take this medicine,
the body starts to dehydrate.

1209
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:13,139
If you workout for even one hour in this state,
it would give you the result of five hours.

1210
01:42:14,056 --> 01:42:18,181
They have certified this to be the world’s greatest invention.

1211
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:25,514
But a lady athlete, to regain her fitness,
started using Hypomacene shots with out professional supervision.

1212
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:29,014
But because of an overdose,
the body had completely dehydrated and she died from it.

1213
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:35,264
Then the UK Government and the World Medical
Council made it illegal to use this drug without medical supervision

1214
01:42:35,431 --> 01:42:39,014
All the paths are leading to dead ends.
People who have no connection to each other.

1215
01:42:39,223 --> 01:42:40,806
Fishermen who are following us like bloodhounds.

1216
01:42:40,806 --> 01:42:42,514
An old man who reminds me of Shakuni.

1217
01:42:42,598 --> 01:42:44,681
All of these people are just actors in this play.

1218
01:42:46,014 --> 01:42:48,598
I wonder who is directing them in this play.

1219
01:42:49,681 --> 01:42:50,973
Totally confused, Gana.

1220
01:42:51,223 --> 01:42:52,389
I don’t understand anything.

1221
01:42:52,389 --> 01:42:57,014
Not just you, even if Arjuna comes down himself,
this is a maze that even he cannot solve.

1222
01:42:58,264 --> 01:43:00,014
But the one thing he doesn’t understand is that...

1223
01:43:00,681 --> 01:43:02,681
Arjuna is not searching for him.

1224
01:43:03,473 --> 01:43:06,473
The one who can spin the whole of Kurukshetra
on his little finger...Ashwathama is.

1225
01:43:17,639 --> 01:43:22,139
What is the guarantee that the people
we will find are telling the truth?

1226
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:28,389
I won’t trust their words, Neha.
I will look at their eyes.

1227
01:43:29,806 --> 01:43:34,931
<i>[TV news about missing girls]</i>

1228
01:43:43,681 --> 01:43:44,723
Sir, who are you?

1229
01:43:45,556 --> 01:43:46,723
I need to see your CCTV camera footage.

1230
01:43:46,723 --> 01:43:48,764
Sorry sir. It’s confidential.
I can’t show to anyone.

1231
01:43:51,806 --> 01:43:52,223
Rs. 10,000

1232
01:43:53,848 --> 01:43:55,431
Sir, I finish my shift at 11 pm in the night.

1233
01:43:55,556 --> 01:43:57,264
If you come ten minutes earlier than that,
I will show it to you.

1234
01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:03,348
Hello..
-Hello..

1235
01:44:03,473 --> 01:44:04,806
Neha, did you get the photo?

1236
01:44:05,348 --> 01:44:06,014
Got it.

1237
01:44:06,223 --> 01:44:07,473
Okay, now quickly do as I say.

1238
01:44:13,848 --> 01:44:14,306
Why?

1239
01:44:14,431 --> 01:44:15,223
Do what I said.

1240
01:44:22,181 --> 01:44:23,181
Show me the second floor.
-Ok, Sir.

1241
01:44:25,848 --> 01:44:26,348
Stop.

1242
01:44:28,764 --> 01:44:30,181
Follow that girl.
- Okay, sir.

1243
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:31,889
Next.

1244
01:44:34,056 --> 01:44:34,514
Stop... Stop.

1245
01:44:35,848 --> 01:44:36,264
Pause it.

1246
01:44:37,848 --> 01:44:38,473
Zoom in.

1247
01:44:42,848 --> 01:44:43,639
Follow that old man.

1248
01:44:43,639 --> 01:44:44,348
That old man, sir?

1249
01:44:45,598 --> 01:44:46,056
Okay, sir.

1250
01:44:46,764 --> 01:44:47,223
Follow him!

1251
01:44:47,598 --> 01:44:48,764
There’s no camera in that area, sir.

1252
01:44:54,806 --> 01:44:56,431
What should I do?

1253
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:04,931
Back.
- Okay, sir.

1254
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:05,931
Back it up.

1255
01:45:06,556 --> 01:45:07,306
Back it up.

1256
01:45:07,931 --> 01:45:09,431
Go back. More. More!
- Okay, sir. I am doing it.

1257
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:11,556
Stop it.

1258
01:45:15,473 --> 01:45:16,223
Follow him.

1259
01:45:17,973 --> 01:45:19,889
First floor. First floor.
-Sir, he’s not in camera range.

1260
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:21,723
What about the parking?
- Parking? Okay, sir.

1261
01:45:26,181 --> 01:45:26,848
Pause it.

1262
01:46:05,056 --> 01:46:07,264
Ah, Shiva Shakti Travels?
- The building at the back.

1263
01:46:07,681 --> 01:46:08,306
Thank you.

1264
01:46:10,264 --> 01:46:10,889
Excuse me...

1265
01:46:16,223 --> 01:46:18,306
You are Dr. Manoj Kumar, right?
-Yes.

1266
01:46:18,306 --> 01:46:20,139
You did the postmortem of that girl Sowmya.

1267
01:46:21,473 --> 01:46:23,889
I need some information on that case.

1268
01:46:25,973 --> 01:46:27,264
Are you police?
- No, sir.

1269
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:29,639
But I need information on the drug called Hypomacene.

1270
01:46:29,723 --> 01:46:30,514
Okay.

1271
01:46:32,223 --> 01:46:33,306
Let me make a coffee for you.

1272
01:46:34,723 --> 01:46:35,223
Come inside.

1273
01:46:45,223 --> 01:46:47,181
Sit. I’ll get the coffee.

1274
01:46:48,514 --> 01:46:52,764
Sir, I feel there is a connection between
all the kidnapping in our city and the drug called Hypomacene.

1275
01:46:52,764 --> 01:46:57,306
When you recently conducted the autopsy on Sowmya,
did you find any traces of this drug in her?

1276
01:46:57,306 --> 01:46:58,681
Shall we chat over coffee?

1277
01:46:59,181 --> 01:46:59,723
Sit.

1278
01:47:10,598 --> 01:47:11,348
Who is that guy?

1279
01:47:11,348 --> 01:47:14,098
He doesn’t know it’s me
but has come looking for me.

1280
01:47:14,098 --> 01:47:15,598
I have been telling you this from the beginning.

1281
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:16,473
Now, what will you do?

1282
01:47:16,723 --> 01:47:17,723
Excuse me, sir.

1283
01:47:22,056 --> 01:47:24,764
This is my grandfather.
He’s been missing for the last two days

1284
01:47:24,806 --> 01:47:26,139
My family was worried about him.

1285
01:47:26,264 --> 01:47:27,348
Gana...
-Tell me, Neha.

1286
01:47:27,348 --> 01:47:29,764
as you suggested, I gave a police complaint.
- Okay. Good good.

1287
01:47:29,848 --> 01:47:30,723
What is the plan next?

1288
01:47:31,389 --> 01:47:32,014
I will tell you

1289
01:47:35,806 --> 01:47:36,389
Neha?!

1290
01:47:40,889 --> 01:47:43,848
Gana, someone is throwing a dead body
in front of the police station and going away.

1291
01:47:44,473 --> 01:47:45,848
What?! Did you look properly?!
- Yes, I have!

1292
01:47:45,973 --> 01:47:47,098
Follow them!

1293
01:47:47,223 --> 01:47:48,014
Follow them!

1294
01:47:48,306 --> 01:47:49,389
I’m coming!
-Okay.

1295
01:48:01,389 --> 01:48:01,848
Coffee.

1296
01:48:04,764 --> 01:48:05,681
That means...

1297
01:48:25,014 --> 01:48:26,098
Hello?
-Son!

1298
01:48:26,389 --> 01:48:28,181
Son, someone is following me.

1299
01:48:28,348 --> 01:48:29,264
Don't worry.

1300
01:48:30,473 --> 01:48:31,264
Do as I tell you.

1301
01:48:31,556 --> 01:48:32,681
Okay, son.

1302
01:48:34,598 --> 01:48:35,389
Grandfather, where are you?

1303
01:48:35,431 --> 01:48:37,973
From MVP road, I am taking a turn to
Ushodaya junction, son.

1304
01:48:38,098 --> 01:48:39,306
Take a left from that junction.

1305
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:40,056
Okay.

1306
01:48:40,056 --> 01:48:42,348
Gana, he’s taken a left from Ushodaya junction.

1307
01:48:42,348 --> 01:48:42,889
Okay, Neha.

1308
01:48:45,723 --> 01:48:46,431
Grandfather, where are you now?

1309
01:48:46,556 --> 01:48:47,389
Kamat road.

1310
01:48:47,473 --> 01:48:48,473
Come towards Pedda Waltair junction.

1311
01:48:48,473 --> 01:48:49,306
Gana...
-Neha, Tell me

1312
01:48:49,306 --> 01:48:51,098
He’s going towards Pedda Waltair junction.

1313
01:49:08,098 --> 01:49:09,348
He’s entered the Port area.

1314
01:49:09,348 --> 01:49:09,848
Port area?

1315
01:49:12,973 --> 01:49:13,473
Neha...

1316
01:49:13,931 --> 01:49:14,973
It seems someone is guiding him.

1317
01:49:14,973 --> 01:49:15,973
You go from there.

1318
01:49:15,973 --> 01:49:16,598
What happened?

1319
01:49:16,723 --> 01:49:17,848
Someone is trying to trap you.

1320
01:49:18,264 --> 01:49:18,681
What?

1321
01:49:18,681 --> 01:49:20,181
I don’t want to get you involved in this.

1322
01:49:20,223 --> 01:49:20,764
Gana!

1323
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:21,848
Do as I say, Neha!

1324
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:31,473
Come towards the Port.

1325
01:49:34,306 --> 01:49:36,181
Now enter the Port.

1326
01:49:37,723 --> 01:49:38,473
I’ve entered.

1327
01:49:38,514 --> 01:49:39,264
Now take a right.

1328
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:40,473
I had.

1329
01:49:40,556 --> 01:49:41,348
Come straight down.

1330
01:49:41,764 --> 01:49:43,139
Come straight. Fast!

1331
01:49:43,306 --> 01:49:43,931
Coming, son.

1332
01:49:44,264 --> 01:49:45,848
Fast! Fast!
- Coming, son.

1333
01:49:46,014 --> 01:49:47,139
Stop!
- Okay, son.

1334
01:50:03,806 --> 01:50:05,806
Son, he’s coming right at me.

1335
01:50:05,806 --> 01:50:06,681
Let him come.

1336
01:50:07,556 --> 01:50:08,389
He’s coming.

1337
01:50:09,056 --> 01:50:10,014
He’s here, son!

1338
01:50:10,014 --> 01:50:11,514
Let him come.
- Do something!

1339
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:14,014
Son! Son! Son!
I’m scared, son!

1340
01:50:14,139 --> 01:50:16,264
Don’t be scared, grandfather.
- I’m scared, son!

1341
01:50:16,681 --> 01:50:18,264
Come fast, son.

1342
01:50:18,264 --> 01:50:19,556
Do something, son!

1343
01:51:15,889 --> 01:51:17,306
Brother, someone has came.

1344
01:51:24,806 --> 01:51:25,973
Do you know who is the owner for this car number?

1345
01:51:25,973 --> 01:51:27,723
This is Dr. Manoj Kumar's car.

1346
01:54:04,306 --> 01:54:06,181
Welcome Dr. Manoj Kumar.

1347
01:54:06,181 --> 01:54:08,264
What a story you had run by using your white coat.

1348
01:54:16,389 --> 01:54:18,181
We are caught, Dad.

1349
01:54:21,931 --> 01:54:23,556
I had warned you from the beginning.

1350
01:54:23,889 --> 01:54:24,348
Dad...

1351
01:54:24,348 --> 01:54:25,639
Did you listen to me?!

1352
01:54:26,389 --> 01:54:27,431
Did you listen to me?!

1353
01:54:27,431 --> 01:54:29,056
Father, don’t hit me!

1354
01:54:29,056 --> 01:54:30,306
Father, don’t hit me!

1355
01:54:30,431 --> 01:54:33,556
Did you listen to me?!
Tell me!

1356
01:54:34,973 --> 01:54:37,098
Will you do it again?!
Tell me!

1357
01:54:37,848 --> 01:54:40,348
Father! Father!
-Tell me?! Will you do such a thing again?!

1358
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:41,514
He is not even having mother...

1359
01:54:41,514 --> 01:54:42,139
You move aside

1360
01:54:42,139 --> 01:54:44,306
Tell me?! Will you do such a thing again?!
- Father! Please father...don’t hit me!

1361
01:54:44,473 --> 01:54:47,764
Tell me?! Will you do such a thing again?!
-I don't do it again.

1362
01:54:47,764 --> 01:54:50,764
Please father...don’t hit me!
- Tell me!

1363
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:52,514
He will listen. He will surely listen.

1364
01:54:52,514 --> 01:54:55,806
Sir, what is this? He’s a small child.

1365
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:58,389
He didn’t mean to do it.
He’s a small child.

1366
01:54:58,389 --> 01:55:02,348
The damages that you have incurred
is not something that money can fix.

1367
01:55:02,348 --> 01:55:06,264
If this word gets out, his career of being a doctor will end.

1368
01:55:06,598 --> 01:55:09,056
Please don’t talk about this anywhere.

1369
01:55:12,431 --> 01:55:13,889
Please, don’t say no.

1370
01:55:25,223 --> 01:55:26,639
Are you feeling bad that I hit you?

1371
01:55:27,848 --> 01:55:29,431
No, it’s painful.

1372
01:55:37,598 --> 01:55:39,223
Remember one thing...

1373
01:55:41,306 --> 01:55:43,764
If you do something without knowing that is a mistake.

1374
01:55:44,848 --> 01:55:47,598
If you do something where everyone knows, its valour.

1375
01:55:49,473 --> 01:55:53,681
No matter who, he’s only great
until no one discovers his mistakes.

1376
01:55:53,889 --> 01:55:56,473
As long as you don’t get caught, the world will respect you.

1377
01:55:56,473 --> 01:55:58,431
The bodies get heavier after death.

1378
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:01,014
The bodies get heavier after death.

1379
01:56:01,556 --> 01:56:03,639
The bodies get heavier after death.

1380
01:56:04,306 --> 01:56:07,514
The bodies get heavier after death.

1381
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:10,806
The bodies get heavier after death.

1382
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:15,139
The bodies get heavier after death.

1383
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:20,223
No matter how many mistakes I commit,
I should never get caught.

1384
01:56:21,431 --> 01:56:22,056
That's why...

1385
01:56:23,098 --> 01:56:25,223
These two who knew about my mistake...

1386
01:57:09,931 --> 01:57:11,639
I killed them along with you.

1387
01:57:14,598 --> 01:57:16,139
I did as you told me to, dad.

1388
01:57:17,514 --> 01:57:19,389
Now no one will ever know about this mistake.

1389
01:57:28,681 --> 01:57:31,556
Grandfather!
I did this by mistake.

1390
01:57:32,014 --> 01:57:33,556
Do not tell anyone about it, grandfather!

1391
01:57:33,889 --> 01:57:36,556
If you do, then I will have to kill you too, grandfather!

1392
01:57:36,556 --> 01:57:37,598
Then I will become an orphan.

1393
01:57:37,598 --> 01:57:39,223
Please, grandfather.
Don't tell this anyone about it, grandfather!

1394
01:57:39,556 --> 01:57:40,556
Please, grandfather.

1395
01:57:40,556 --> 01:57:42,348
You have to look after me now.

1396
01:57:42,514 --> 01:57:43,681
I am a small child, grandfather.

1397
01:57:44,139 --> 01:57:46,848
Please...
Don't tell this to anyone, grandfather.

1398
01:57:58,431 --> 01:58:00,389
Why did you kill them like that?

1399
01:58:00,389 --> 01:58:01,098
Grandfather...!

1400
01:58:01,806 --> 01:58:03,806
That girl has seen me while doing that...

1401
01:58:03,806 --> 01:58:05,806
That's why she told to her mother.

1402
01:58:07,181 --> 01:58:08,806
And her mother told to my father.

1403
01:58:09,639 --> 01:58:13,056
If she didn't seen me then
there would be nothing like this.

1404
01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:17,473
Everyone don't be calm like you by seeing it.

1405
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:20,431
Yes, yes.

1406
01:58:21,306 --> 01:58:21,889
Yes.

1407
01:58:49,764 --> 01:58:50,431
Dad...

1408
01:58:52,848 --> 01:58:53,598
Dad?

1409
01:58:55,556 --> 01:58:56,306
Dad?

1410
01:59:00,056 --> 01:59:02,348
What are you doing? you... idiot.

1411
02:01:24,139 --> 02:01:26,181
Wait... wait...

1412
02:01:30,889 --> 02:01:34,598
For whom, you are doing all these?

1413
02:01:35,473 --> 02:01:36,723
I don’t know.

1414
02:01:38,431 --> 02:01:43,014
The culture of abducting girls, harassing them...

1415
02:01:43,306 --> 02:01:51,848
These all are followed from our Epics, Ancestors
and from the generations.

1416
02:01:53,681 --> 02:01:55,556
This is our inheritance.

1417
02:01:57,639 --> 02:01:58,681
How can you tell me this is wrong?

1418
02:01:58,889 --> 02:02:00,348
The same epics says...

1419
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:07,889
If you mess with a woman, then it won’t matter
if they have ten heads or 99 brothers, they will be destroyed!

1420
02:02:47,264 --> 02:02:48,598
Dad?
- Gana, where are you?

1421
02:02:49,389 --> 02:02:50,389
I’m outside, dad. Tell me.

1422
02:02:50,389 --> 02:02:51,431
Come home fast.

1423
02:02:51,431 --> 02:02:52,389
What happened, dad?

1424
02:02:52,389 --> 02:02:56,473
Someone is threatening your sister,
that he will come home and harass her.

1425
02:02:56,556 --> 02:02:57,348
Come home, fast.

1426
02:03:06,139 --> 02:03:06,848
Gana!

1427
02:03:07,723 --> 02:03:08,681
Who is that guy, dad?

1428
02:03:10,306 --> 02:03:11,264
Who called you?

1429
02:03:11,764 --> 02:03:13,514
Why isn’t anyone saying anything?
Priya, what happened?!

1430
02:03:15,181 --> 02:03:16,014
Why isn’t anyone saying anything?

1431
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,348
Some guy who says he’s your nephew!

1432
02:03:17,348 --> 02:03:17,806
What?

1433
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,598
You are going to be a maternal uncle!

1434
02:04:37,944 --> 02:04:38,861
<i>The Earth.</i>

1435
02:04:39,278 --> 02:04:40,528
<i>Mother is just like the earth.</i>

1436
02:04:41,111 --> 02:04:44,278
<i>She will bare us no matter how difficult</i>
<i>and carry us no matter how heavy it feels.</i>

1437
02:04:44,569 --> 02:04:49,111
<i>There are some men who are like animals,</i>
<i>who like to show off their strength by overpowering women.</i>

1438
02:04:50,194 --> 02:04:52,153
<i>The true strength is what we give them...</i>

1439
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:53,944
<i>but not what we show on them when we overpower them.</i>

1440
02:04:54,694 --> 02:04:57,278
<i>They asked us to plant a tree in every house to save the planet.</i>

1441
02:04:57,486 --> 02:05:00,778
<i>What do we plant to save a woman</i>
<i>who's like a mother?</i>

1442
02:05:16,236 --> 02:05:19,569
"Ashwadhama!"

1443
02:05:23,653 --> 02:05:26,986
"Ashwadhama!"

1444
02:05:31,236 --> 02:05:34,569
"Ashwadhama!"

1445
02:05:38,736 --> 02:05:42,069
"Ashwadhama!"

1446
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:04,944
"An angry man
With fire in his eyes"

1447
02:06:04,944 --> 02:06:08,653
"Fierce warrior
This fearsome man"

1448
02:06:08,778 --> 02:06:12,611
"Like the timeless Lord Shiva
A hero who’s like a torrent!"

1449
02:06:12,611 --> 02:06:16,153
"He doesn’t spare wicked and cruel people."

1450
02:06:18,903 --> 02:06:20,819
"Ashwadhama!"

1451
02:06:26,569 --> 02:06:28,194
"Ashwadhama!"

1452
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:31,944
"Ashwadhama!"

1453
02:06:34,028 --> 02:06:35,736
"Ashwadhama!"

1454
02:06:38,694 --> 02:06:42,361
"He has unexpected intelligence."

1455
02:06:42,444 --> 02:06:45,903
"His life is like an invincible electric current!"

1456
02:06:46,236 --> 02:06:50,111
"His mental strength is stable like
the arrow of the Sagittarius!"

1457
02:06:50,111 --> 02:06:53,653
"His determination is a Tsunami."

1458
02:06:53,653 --> 02:06:57,778
"He is always there to protect."

1459
02:06:57,778 --> 02:07:01,653
"His life’s mission is to fight for the truth."

1460
02:07:16,236 --> 02:07:20,028
"Waste fellow, useless fellow...
you don’t care for relationships."

1461
02:07:20,028 --> 02:07:21,944
"You don’t even consider their age!"

1462
02:07:21,944 --> 02:07:24,528
"It’s enough if she’s a woman."

1463
02:07:25,694 --> 02:07:26,903
"Lower your gaze, down!"

1464
02:07:26,903 --> 02:07:28,736
"Lower your gaze, down!"

1465
02:07:31,361 --> 02:07:34,819
"Who do you think a woman is?
She’s the Divine Feminine"

1466
02:07:34,819 --> 02:07:39,403
"When you come in front of the divine mother..."

1467
02:07:40,611 --> 02:07:42,069
"Bow your head down with limitless respect."

1468
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:43,778
"Bow your head down!"

1469
02:07:46,319 --> 02:07:49,653
"Ashwadhama!"

1470
02:07:53,736 --> 02:07:57,069
"Ashwadhama!"

1471
02:08:00,986 --> 02:08:04,319
"Ashwadhama!"

1472
02:08:08,403 --> 02:08:11,736
"Ashwadhama!"

1473
02:08:16,278 --> 02:08:19,569
"He has endured the sharp
wound deep within his heart."

1474
02:08:19,903 --> 02:08:23,069
"He stored the poison in his throat."

1475
02:08:23,694 --> 02:08:27,861
"He is like the hot burning lava."

1476
02:08:27,861 --> 02:08:30,986
"The womenkind have him as their strength."

1477
02:08:30,986 --> 02:08:38,569
"For those cruel men who do not value women,
He will definitely ensure their death sentence."

1478
02:08:53,736 --> 02:08:57,528
"An angry man
With fire in his eyes"

1479
02:08:57,528 --> 02:09:01,236
"Fierce warrior
This fearsome man"

1480
02:09:01,361 --> 02:09:05,194
"Like the timeless Lord Shiva
A hero who’s like a torrent!"
