2
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,999
In every girl's life,
comes that moment

3
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,999
when she craves to be a woman.

4
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,999
Rosy's desire was
blooming like a rose.

5
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:17,999
Dreams from beyond her caged body,
were driving her crazy.

6
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:20,999
And in the garden of her body,

7
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,999
her aching youth
bore into her insides.

8
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:43,834
Rosy stood trapped behind
the iron bars of the window.

9
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,999
Through the binoculars,
she watched the dazzling city lights.

10
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,999
Jeans-clad girls,
clinging to their boyfriends,

11
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,999
rode freely on motorbikes.

12
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:57,999
And Rosy's fantasies
spiralled out of control.

13
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,999
When I was finding my ways

14
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,999
Walking in certain places

15
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,999
Why didn't you come around?

16
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,999
And confinement...

17
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,999
Oh hello, freshman! Intro?

18
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:23,999
Sorry.

19
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm Rehana Abidi. My song
is inspired by '7 things'.

20
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,999
Bhopal's third Britney Spears!

21
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:36,999
Actually... '7 things' is a
Miley Cyrus song.

22
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,999
Yes, it's the same thing.

23
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,999
- What do you think?
We don't know?

24
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,999
- Can you please
start singing now?

25
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,999
I walk outside as it rains

26
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,999
Looking for you but in vain

27
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,999
Found a paper...

28
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:57,999
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:00,834
Sorry... once more?

30
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:03,999
Go home and sing in the shower.

31
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,999
Try again,
when something else is banned.

32
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,999
But the moment Rosy
puts on her dancing shoes

33
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:14,999
the lights go out.

34
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,999
Through the binoculars,
Rosy now sees new images.

35
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,999
Far from these crowded lanes

36
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:26,999
Riding a Harley Davidson,
her hair flying in the wind.

37
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,999
How do I look?
- Smashing!

38
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,999
Come fast!

39
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,999
Hold me close!

40
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:44,999
Leela darling - can we get on with
the real honeymoon?

41
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,999
Look straight, Mr Honeymoon!

42
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,999
You look quite the Casanova.

43
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,999
These photos are
the ticket to our success.

44
00:04:58,999 --> 00:04:59,999
Let them work their magic...

45
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,999
We'll be roaming freely in the
mountains, relaxing by the beach.

46
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,999
Where all will your lover boy
have to follow you?

47
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:13,999
I'll show you all of India!

48
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,999
The Taj Mahal in front,
your honey besides you.

49
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,999
Now, that's what I call a
perfect honeymoon!

50
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,999
We provide all honeymoon
related services.

51
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,999
Heart shaped teddy bear, heart shaped
condom... I mean, candle

52
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:36,999
What about a photography package?

53
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:37,999
Photography package?

54
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:42,999
We can't ask strangers
to take our photos.

55
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,999
We can't get intimate
in front of them.

56
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,999
It's the age of selfies.

57
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,999
But selfies are not flattering.

58
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,999
Imagine a professional photographer
accompanying you.

59
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,834
The perfect scheme.

60
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:00,999
We photograph the couple

61
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,999
from the wedding,
till the honeymoon!

62
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:07,999
I'll do the make up.

63
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,999
The bride will look like a
movie star!

64
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,999
He'll take the photos.

65
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,999
Your agency gets a
20 percent cut!

66
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,999
What say?

67
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,999
What a scam!
Spare me.

68
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:20,999
My scheme is perfect!

69
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:22,999
Mark my words.

70
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,999
There are better agents in Bhopal!

71
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:35,999
Rosy loved the shops on the street.

72
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,999
She stood at the window
calling out to passers-by.

73
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,999
"Come buy these spicy
sizzling magic dreams!!!"

74
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,999
Her voice was haunting.

75
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,999
I found this outside.
Is it yours?

76
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,999
No... I only wear real gold.

77
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:05,999
Of course, God has been generous.

78
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,999
A glass of water? Please?

79
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,999
Cold preferably... and some ice.

80
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,999
This Bhopal heat!

81
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:20,999
If I had lemon and sugar...
I'd have lemonade!

82
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,999
I'll get the sugar!

83
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,999
What are you doing?

84
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:35,999
What do you want?

85
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,999
Relax!

86
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,834
It's the Magic Products'
pest control gun!

87
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,999
Smells great! Gets rid of

88
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,999
ants, mice

89
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:50,999
and cockroaches.

90
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,999
Spray once

91
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,999
and you'll be pest free
for the next six months!

92
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,999
Try it!

93
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,999
Does this gun rid all pests?

94
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,999
Well... try it.

95
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,999
Don't you need pest control
at your house?

96
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,999
My 'pest' stays under control
without the gun.

97
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,999
Lucky girl!

98
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,999
Call to order the Supergun.

99
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,999
Shirin Aslam, Magic Products.

100
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:38,999
I didn't hear the phone ring.
I'm at the school.

101
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,834
Class isn't over yet.

102
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,999
The curtains were thick.

103
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,999
In the darkness, nobody could see Rosy.

104
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,999
Rosy's screams were lost
in the sounds of the street.

105
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
And Rosy's shop remained a fantasy.

106
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,999
Father!

107
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:08,834
Trapped inside a dingy room
of the dilapidated house.

108
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,999
Alone with just her racy
dreams for company.

109
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,999
Only the shadows of men
ever reached Rosy's window.

110
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,999
Her burning desire
never to be satiated.

111
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,999
Because the key to the door was lost.

112
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,999
Auntie, here's the one million.

113
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,999
We'll pay five million
over the market rate!

114
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,999
Hold it!

115
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,999
The lights should dazzle!

116
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,999
One string won't do!
Put a few more!

117
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,999
We'll build a glittering,
fancy mall here.

118
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,999
Our Hawai Manzil already glitters!

119
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,999
So what's so special about your shop?

120
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,999
Not a shop, it's a mall!

121
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,999
Here... our Limca Record
breaking snack!

122
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,999
With some Limca!

123
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:03,999
Auntie

124
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,999
I only want
what's best for you.

125
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,999
I've been your tenant for years.

126
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,999
Then act like a tenant, Rahim!

127
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,999
Will you sell off the house
just for your commission?

128
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,999
Haven't you earned enough
in Saudi Arabia these seven years?

129
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,999
Shut up, you two!

130
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:20,999
Control yourselves!

131
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:24,999
Mr. Gupta?

132
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:29,999
When their parents...

133
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,999
my husband... their uncle

134
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,999
all died in the gas tragedy.

135
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,999
We had nothing left.

136
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:42,999
You know.

137
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,999
All we had was Hawai Manzil.

138
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,999
Hawai Manzil is not for sale.

139
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,999
Remove that!

140
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:05,999
Auntie.

141
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,999
God himself couldn't have
found a better match for my daughter

142
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,834
like the one you've found.

143
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,999
And what a match!

144
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,999
She'll be living right next door
after the wedding.

145
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,999
We'll just hop across
for our beauty treatment.

146
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,999
Leela won't work after marriage.

147
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:22,999
She'll have fun at home.

148
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,999
I'll have fun, but won't sit home.

149
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,834
Won't sit at home?
So what'll you do?

150
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,999
I'll go on my honeymoon!

151
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,999
Suddenly Rosy chanced upon
a bouquet of red roses.

152
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,999
The florist was fixing the flowers.

153
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,999
If only Prince Charming would
caress her with those roses.

154
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,999
Trapped behind the window bars

155
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,999
a frenzied Rosy took off her bathrobe.

156
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,999
She stood waiting for Prince Charming.

157
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,999
Just madness in her eyes
and red lipstick on her lips.

158
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,999
Smile!

159
00:11:58,999 --> 00:11:59,999
Lovely!

160
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,999
Profile please.

161
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:03,999
Perfect.

162
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,999
Fingers on your
earring.

163
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:08,999
Lovely!

164
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,999
Chin down.

165
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:13,999
That's right.

166
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:15,999
Smile.

167
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,834
The camera is fixed on the girl.

168
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,999
It's the boy's engagement as well.

169
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,999
Sure... call the groom.

170
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:25,999
Hey, mister!

171
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,999
Stop sticking to the bride.
Shift!

172
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:29,999
Sorry.

173
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,999
Getting too close.

174
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,999
Smile.
Look in front.

175
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:37,999
Hey, mister!
- Yes?

176
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,999
Not your profile. Look straight.

177
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,999
It's your engagement.
I'm taking your photo.

178
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,999
That's enough.

179
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,999
How about a group photo?

180
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:54,999
Auntie?

181
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:55,999
Yes?

182
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,999
Group photo!

183
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,999
Yes, of course.

184
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,999
Auntie, stand in
between the two of them.

185
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:04,999
No!

186
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,999
Not between the couple.

187
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,999
Come on, everybody.

188
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,999
The entire Hawai Manzil family.

189
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,999
Oh, Faiz is crying.

190
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:15,999
Smile now.

191
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,999
Anyone else?

192
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,999
One... two... three.

193
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:22,999
One more!

194
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:31,999
Who is it?

195
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:33,999
Sorry!

196
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:36,999
You startled me.

197
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,999
Don't worry.

198
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,999
Going this way?

199
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,999
Yes, you carry on.

200
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,999
I'll come along.

201
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:48,999
Okay.

202
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,999
The fuse box is somewhere up here.

203
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,999
Let's take a look.

204
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,999
Harder! Harder!

205
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,999
Bastard, if you ditch me

206
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,999
I'll post this video on Facebook.

207
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,999
You won't be able to show
your face any where in Bhopal!

208
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,999
Darling, will the video show my face

209
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,999
or my package?

210
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,999
Delhi is far.

211
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:27,999
Really?

212
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,999
Let's start a porn business right here!

213
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,999
Tell me, are you coming for
the interview tomorrow?

214
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,999
Of course!

215
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,999
Baby Doll! First let me interview
every inch of your body.

216
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:52,999
Where is Leela?

217
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,999
Haven't seen her.

218
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,999
Keep playing.

219
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,999
It fits right into your purse.

220
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:08,999
Like magic.

221
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,999
Your husband got it
from the Middle East?

222
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,999
Who's that?

223
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,999
You can keep it.
I'm not interested.

224
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,999
But you...

225
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,999
Excuse me.

226
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,834
God! These saleswomen.

227
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:20,999
They just start off.

228
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,999
They're sly.
Who knows what all they do.

229
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:24,999
Stay away from them.

230
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:25,999
Kids!

231
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,999
If he even touches you

232
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,999
I'll chop his hands off!

233
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,999
Bloody slut!

234
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,999
Go on!
Get me married against my will.

235
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,999
Go on!

236
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,999
Shameless wretch!

237
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:53,999
Even if gifted a diamond

238
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,999
you'll still choose the piece of coal.

239
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,999
Hold this, asshole!

240
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:23,999
Have you ever noticed?

241
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:24,999
What?

242
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:28,999
When the lights go off, our eyes
just adjust to the darkness.

243
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,999
You're right.

244
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,999
We get used to the dark...

245
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,999
Auntie!

246
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,999
You've met my brother.

247
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,999
Brother, this is 'Auntie'.

248
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,999
Our neighbourhood celebrity!

249
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:53,999
My brother... poor thing,
lost his wife at 56!

250
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,999
He has his entire life ahead of him.

251
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,999
So I'm looking for a
brand new sister-in-law!

252
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:05,999
If you know a nice girl
let me know.

253
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:09,999
Even if she's 35-40!

254
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,999
Say thanks to 'Auntie'.

255
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,834
Thank you... 'Auntie'.

256
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,999
O dancing heart

257
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:38,999
O dancing heart

258
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:45,999
O dancing heart

259
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,999
O naughty heart

260
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:49,999
O dancing heart

261
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,999
O naughty heart

262
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:54,999
The love of groom and bride

263
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:58,999
Blossoms with desire so sweet

264
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,999
O yes, she wants him

265
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:01,999
And, she'll have him

266
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,999
Desire drives her

267
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,999
She's shy no more

268
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,999
O she's bitten

269
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,999
Yes, she's smitten

270
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,999
Her precious flower
Stolen by her beloved

271
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:37,999
Her wild tresses across the pillow

272
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:41,999
The rhythmic dance of love

273
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:44,999
Their breaths moist

274
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,834
With the sweet perfume of union

275
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,999
His soft caresses

276
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,999
Covered her with dew drops

277
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,999
O dancing heart

278
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:57,999
O naughty heart

279
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:01,999
These crazy tales of love

280
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,999
These charming romances

281
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,999
Hearts full of naughty desire

282
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,999
The love of groom and bride

283
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,999
Blossoms with desire so sweet

284
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,999
Now don't play games

285
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,834
Or I'll suffer

286
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,999
I'm faint with yearning

287
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,999
Cure me with your love

288
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,999
Just a little

289
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,999
Potion of pleasure

290
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,999
Love me again

291
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:36,999
I'm faint with yearning
Cure me with your love

292
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,999
Rehana! Have you no shame?

293
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,999
Such obscenity! Go to your room.

294
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:18,999
Move the camera,
mister or I'll slap you.

295
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,999
Will dancing get you good grades?

296
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,999
Your father has worked hard
to put you into college.

297
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,999
Not so you can shame us!

298
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,999
Concentrate on your studies.

299
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:38,999
Shameless girl!

300
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:20,999
The rent is due.

301
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,999
The salary transfer from Saudi...

302
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:23,999
Oh, come on!

303
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,999
Don't interfere in money matters.

304
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:29,999
It's complicated.

305
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,999
I've started work with
Bemisaal Builders.

306
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,999
It's burning!
- Really?

307
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:39,999
Didn't burn before.

308
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,999
It's started only after I got back?

309
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,999
In the dark of the night
the street was silent.

310
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,999
Rosy, in her flimsy nightie,
lay down by the window

311
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,999
And dreamt her secret dreams.

312
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,999
In Prince Charming's arms

313
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,999
Rosy was flying amidst the stars.

314
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,999
Inside the airplane he's kissing

315
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,999
Rosy's body with his wet lips.

316
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:34,999
Rosy touched herself as she fantasized
about Prince Charming.

317
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:38,999
And she used the pillow to stifle
her own screams.

318
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,999
Jeans we will wear! Yes we will!

319
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,999
Jeans are my right!
My right!

320
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:10,999
Stop us if you can!

321
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,999
We'll fight till our last breath!
Last breath!

322
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,999
- A message for our video blog?

323
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,999
I'm just a freshman.

324
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,999
- New rule. No jeans for girls.
Any comment?

325
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:49,999
There's no end to rules in a girl's life.

326
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,999
Don't sing, don't dance

327
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,999
you'll shame us.

328
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,999
Don't walk like that,
people will stare.

329
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,999
Keep your eyes down,
what will people say?

330
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,999
Don't breathe, you're heaving chest
will attract attention!

331
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,999
Don't wear lipstick,
you'll have an affair!

332
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,999
Don't wear jeans,
you'll create a scandal!

333
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,999
I want to ask the authorities,
what exactly will happen?

334
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,999
Why does our freedom scare you so?

335
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,999
Don't we have the right to live freely?

336
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:17,999
We want our right!

337
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,999
Our right to jeans! Our right to live!

338
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,999
Right to jeans! Right to live!

339
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:42,999
It was the first shower of the monsoon.

340
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,999
The raindrops of youth beckoned Rosy.

341
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,999
A fierce storm was
raging inside Rosy

342
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,999
Far stronger than the
storm outside.

343
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:56,999
Rosy was totally wet
with the flood of desire.

344
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,999
Her white shirt was now transparent.

345
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,999
Rosy's body was drenched.

346
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,999
She was drowning in a whirlpool of lust.

347
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,999
The binoculars slipped from her hand.

348
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:14,999
In the window outside,
the new tenant was taking a shower.

349
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,999
Totally naked!

350
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,999
Auntie!

351
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:25,999
Oh my God!

352
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,999
Duggu! Guddu!

353
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,999
Guddu, look at your brother!

354
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:32,999
Somebody! Anybody!

355
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,999
Help him!

356
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:35,999
I'm coming!

357
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,999
See, auntie? I can swim now!

358
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,999
What? You think that's funny!

359
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,999
That's enough! Show's over!
Back to the pool.

360
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,999
Guddu and Duggu,
get going.

361
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,999
She's fine.

362
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:10,999
What!

363
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,999
Want me to lose my job?

364
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,999
Why the hell did you get into
the pool if you can't swim?

365
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:18,999
How rude!

366
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:20,999
If the child had drowned...

367
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,999
Can't swim and trying to be a lifeguard!

368
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,999
I'm going to lodge a complaint.

369
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,999
Go ahead.
But first tell me your name.

370
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:33,999
Auntie!

371
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,999
Whose 'auntie'? Not mine!

372
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:37,999
What name should I put down?

373
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:42,999
Usha.

374
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,999
Usha Parmar.

375
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,999
Once you learn how to swim

376
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:53,999
you can dive all you want.

377
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:03,999
And don't come in a sari.

378
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,999
Usha-ji.

379
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,999
It's called a condom.

380
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:28,999
Right?

381
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,999
I know, doctor.

382
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,999
Then why don't you use them?

383
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,999
Your husband comes to India
for barely two weeks a year.

384
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,999
And you've had three kids
and three abortions!

385
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:41,999
And after every night of sex,
you take the pill.

386
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,999
If this continues, you'll need surgery.

387
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:51,999
What about a diaphragm?

388
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,999
Diaphragm? Impossible!

389
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,999
Your uterus is already infected.

390
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,999
This is the only option.

391
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:07,999
He gets carried away
in the heat of the moment.

392
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:10,999
Send your passionate husband to me.

393
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,999
I'll deal with him.

394
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:24,999
'Cap'! Which brand?

395
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,999
Mother, I want a cap too.

396
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,999
Me, too.

397
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,999
It's sunny on the cricket field.

398
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,999
Any good brand will do.

399
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,999
Mother, I want that chocolate.

400
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,999
I want that chocolate too.

401
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:38,999
Chocolate.

402
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:41,999
Chocolate?
Or the new flavour... strawberry?

403
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:04,999
You won't believe

404
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:09,999
Mr. Mathur loved my Brazilian wax!
He was so happy.

405
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:13,999
When in Delhi,
he took me to Maya Spa everyday.

406
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,999
If you ever go to Delhi,
you must check it out.

407
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:16,999
I'm going soon.

408
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:18,999
You're going to Delhi? When?

409
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:21,999
Leela.
- Yes!

410
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:22,999
Open the door.

411
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:23,999
What is it?

412
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:25,999
Your fiancÃ© is here.

413
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,999
Here?

414
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:43,999
Hi!

415
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:45,999
Hi!

416
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:54,999
Tea?

417
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:58,999
Here.

418
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:04,999
You take it.

419
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,999
It's my first time inside
a ladies parlour.

420
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:20,999
You men never need to.

421
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,999
Just keep growing the jungles!

422
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,999
Joke!
You're funny.

423
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:37,999
For you.

424
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,999
I wanted to give it to you
at the engagement

425
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,999
but I never got a chance.

426
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:48,999
My first...

427
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,999
First girlfriend?

428
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,999
Sorry. My mistake.

429
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:56,999
You are my fiancÃ©.

430
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:02,999
This is also for you.

431
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:13,999
Shall we activate the phone?

432
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,999
Not now.

433
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,999
You don't like the model?

434
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,999
It's okay...
- We can exchange it at the store.

435
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,999
Not now!

436
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,999
Lots of appointments today.

437
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:31,999
Sorry... I should have called and come.

438
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,999
Sir, people in Delhi
have a lot of money.

439
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,999
That's the Qutab Minar!

440
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,999
The Delhi wedding market
is huge

441
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,999
as seen in the film 'Band Baaja Baraat'.

442
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,999
Big stars.

443
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:51,999
Very good film!

444
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,999
Sorry.

445
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:57,999
Got a little late.

446
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:02,999
Did you like the photos?

447
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,999
We'll make the honeymoon
memorable for the couple.

448
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:07,999
You can count on us!

449
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:10,999
They'll feel like they're
in a Bollywood film.

450
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:11,999
That's for sure.

451
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,999
From these photos, it seems the
two of you are on honeymoon.

452
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:19,999
Sample photos!

453
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,999
Are the two of you in a relationship?

454
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,999
Yes, we're engaged!
- No, sir!

455
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:47,999
Damn it! This piece of junk is
just like your business plan.

456
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,999
A complete flop!

457
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:50,999
Shut up!

458
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,999
Couldn't you lie and say we're engaged?

459
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:55,999
Why should I lie?

460
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:57,999
This is all your fault!

461
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,999
My fault?

462
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:01,999
You're getting on my nerves.

463
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,999
Am I?

464
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:05,999
Getting on your nerves?

465
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:09,999
Go throw these tantrums

466
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,999
with your Mr. Moneybags!
Not with me.

467
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:17,999
If it's money I wanted, I wouldn't be
wasting my time with you, fucker.

468
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,999
Wasting your time?

469
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,999
That's what you're doing with me?

470
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:29,999
That's not what I meant.

471
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,999
I know exactly what you meant!

472
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:32,999
That's not...

473
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:33,999
Now you watch!

474
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:35,999
Arshad, if you walk away right now

475
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,999
you'll never see me again!

476
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,999
Go to hell! Bloody gold digger.

477
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:50,999
Rosy stared wistfully
at the bouquet of red roses.

478
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,999
It was getting dark.

479
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,999
The florist was shutting shop.

480
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,999
The bouquet was beyond reach.

481
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,999
And though he was just
outside the window

482
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,999
the tenant was beyond reach.

483
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,999
Rosy wanted to shower with him.

484
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:38,999
Rosy wanted the tenant to
shampoo her long hair.

485
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,999
And his slippery fingers to provoke
Rosy's burning youth.

486
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:34,999
Alter these.

487
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,999
How long will it take?

488
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,999
Rehana, your mother
asked you a question.

489
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:47,999
A couple of hours.

490
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,999
Don't forget to turn the lights off.

491
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:45,999
- Hello!

492
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:02,999
- Hello!

493
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:15,999
One minute.

494
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,999
What?

495
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,999
Where did that come from?

496
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,999
I got it.

497
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,999
From a shop? You bought it?

498
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,999
Of course not! Got it from the clinic.

499
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,999
I thought you've been shameless

500
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,999
buying condoms
instead of groceries!

501
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,999
How could I do such a thing?

502
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,999
Chocolate flavour!

503
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,999
Your clinic has become quite fancy.

504
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,999
Hey Rehana, cool speech.

505
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:38,999
Drag?

506
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,999
You don't smoke?

507
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:49,999
I do, of course.

508
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:50,999
But I have a bad throat.

509
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:52,999
Follow me.

510
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:03,999
Not bad.

511
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:07,999
Not just jeans

512
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,999
they should ban women from college.

513
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:11,999
100 rupees

514
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:12,999
Got that.

515
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:14,999
Thanks! I didn't have the change...

516
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:21,999
Namrata.

517
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:30,999
Hi... can I audition again?

518
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,999
Let's chat at the party?

519
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:32,999
Party?

520
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,999
Friday night, Veer's party.

521
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,999
Sure.

522
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:40,999
I'm wearing gold.

523
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,999
I'm taking silver.

524
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,999
You can take copper.

525
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,999
A great salesgirl is one

526
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:05,999
who can sell fairness cream
to a white American.

527
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:08,999
Our Best Salesgirl for this quarter is

528
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,999
Shirin Aslam!

529
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,999
Congratulations, Shirin!

530
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,999
This is for you.

531
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,999
Don't sell it.

532
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:25,999
Magic makes homes spic and span.

533
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:29,999
Sweep left, sweep right.
Abracadabra!

534
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,999
Is popping out babies
your only plan?

535
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,999
Or do you want more?

536
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,999
Will you be a Sales Trainer?

537
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,999
40 thousand plus benefits.

538
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:53,999
Will I need to be in
office 9-6 everyday?

539
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,999
You still haven't told your
husband about this job?

540
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,999
Isn't he back from Saudi Arabia?

541
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:02,999
Think about it.

542
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,999
The announcement will be
made at the Diwali Carnival.

543
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:06,999
The boss herself is
coming down from Delhi.

544
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:11,999
And

545
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,999
with the new job

546
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,999
no more of the
pregnancy-abortion business.

547
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,999
Yes, ma'am... girl or boy?

548
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:30,999
Girl.

549
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,999
Not so revealing.

550
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:37,999
Something with sleeves?

551
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:38,999
There's some with shorts as well.

552
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,999
Yes! Show those.

553
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,999
She's about this big.

554
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,999
This size?

555
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,999
Oh no! That's way too small!

556
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:49,999
Something bigger?

557
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:53,999
Maybe larger.

558
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,999
This one?

559
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:58,999
It's a nice colour too.

560
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:01,999
Still larger.
The girl is chubby.

561
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:04,999
This is our largest size.

562
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:10,999
You could've just said
the swimsuit was for you.

563
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,999
Are you crazy?

564
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,999
You think I'd wear this?

565
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,999
Have some respect for a woman my age!

566
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:20,999
Auntie!

567
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:26,999
What are you doing at the mall?

568
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,999
Shirin, I didn't see you!

569
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,999
Listen.

570
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:35,999
If the money hasn't been
transferred from Saudi Arabia

571
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:37,999
don't worry about it.

572
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:41,999
Pay your rent later.

573
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:43,999
There's no need for that.

574
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:45,999
I won't tell anyone.

575
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:50,999
You want a swimsuit, right?

576
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:15,999
Isn't the cake delicious?

577
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:17,999
I baked it in the microwave.

578
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,999
Where did the microwave come from?

579
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:21,999
I won it as a prize.

580
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:24,999
I'm the best salesgirl
at Magic Products.

581
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:28,999
I'm the best salesgirl
at Magic Products!

582
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,999
Mother, can't we eat this?

583
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,999
Let's bake the cake and
we'll feed your father too.

584
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:47,999
Just two weeks
left as a free man!

585
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:50,999
With a blessed boy like Manoj

586
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,999
every date is auspicious.

587
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:57,999
Here, have some sweets.

588
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,999
Come... come.

589
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,999
Mother, I made a century
with this bat.

590
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,999
Ruined my shirt.
Rascal!

591
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:32,999
I'll wash it... with Magic bleach.

592
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:38,999
Don't worry, finish eating.

593
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,999
Pack the curry
for lunch tomorrow.

594
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,999
Uncivilized kids!

595
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:47,999
Why are all these toys
on the table?

596
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:48,999
Get rid of them!

597
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:01,999
I've baked a cake.

598
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:10,999
The wedding's in two weeks?

599
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:12,999
What's the hurry?

600
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,999
I asked you a question!

601
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:18,999
I don't trust you.

602
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:20,999
You'll bring me dishonour.

603
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:22,999
Dishonour?

604
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:24,999
What about my happiness?

605
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:28,999
No mother would have done
what I've done for you.

606
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:29,999
Stop being a martyr.

607
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:31,999
You choose to do that job!

608
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:32,999
I didn't tell you to.

609
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:02,999
Chocolate cake.
I baked it in the microwave.

610
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:04,999
Where did the microwave come from?

611
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,999
The money should come in
by next week.

612
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,999
Bemisaal Builders are
going to pay me soon.

613
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:13,999
Don't worry about the expenses.

614
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,999
Try the cake.

615
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:16,999
It's delicious!

616
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,999
I baked it in the microwave.

617
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,999
Where did the micro...?
- Hand me the remote.

618
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:54,999
Auntie, where are you off to?

619
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:57,999
Didn't you want to check the accounts?
- You go ahead...

620
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:00,999
I'll come back and check.

621
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,999
I'm going for a prayer meeting.
- Prayer meeting?

622
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:06,999
At this time?

623
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,999
A new swimmi...

624
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,999
'Swami' is in town.

625
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:12,999
He speaks only in the afternoon.

626
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:14,999
He keeps a vow of silence
for the rest of the day.

627
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:20,999
Prepare 100 boxes of sweets
for the Shivratri prayers.

628
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,999
Note that down.
- Okay.

629
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,999
I will, you carry on.

630
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:28,999
Do it in front of me!
You'll forget.

631
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,999
Oh, come on.

632
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:35,999
Come to the prayer meeting sometimes.

633
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,999
God help my nephews.

634
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:35,999
Komal, move your legs!

635
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:42,999
Come on, Usha-ji!

636
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:45,999
Come on in.

637
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:57,999
Come.

638
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:06,999
Come.

639
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:10,999
I'm scared.

640
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,999
Let's go!

641
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,999
Nothing will happen.

642
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:19,999
You're fine.

643
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:30,999
Everyday Rosy looked
through her binoculars

644
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:32,999
to see the young tenant bathing.

645
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:37,999
His broad shoulders, the water
streaming down his chest.

646
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:42,999
And down below, immersed
in the water, his long manhood.

647
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:46,999
Like a wave, Rosy wanted to engulf
Prince Charming's body.

648
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:49,999
Rosy was certain the tenant
was her Prince Charming.

649
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:52,999
And it is only for the
pleasure of Rosy's lustful eyes

650
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,999
that he bathes with the window open.

651
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:07,999
Stop!

652
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,999
Here, check my bag.

653
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:18,999
Nothing here.

654
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:20,999
Sorry for the inconvenience ma'am.

655
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,999
I'm sorry about yesterday.

656
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:22,999
Mother, I don't want to get married.

657
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:30,999
You want to be that Muslim's plaything?

658
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,999
Or end up like me?

659
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:38,999
I've been here 17 years.

660
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:44,999
Heat, cold, illness

661
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:46,999
even if I have my periods.

662
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:48,999
Then quit.

663
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:50,999
I'll manage.

664
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:53,999
You know your alcoholic father
left us in deep debt.

665
00:55:56,999 --> 00:56:00,999
I'll start my own business,
I'll earn, I'll run the house.

666
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:04,999
But you'll never be able
to buy a house.

667
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:09,999
Manoj is buying me a house.

668
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,999
Sister, your beauty
could get you a Taj Mahal.

669
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:25,999
Lovely.

670
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:27,999
Who is it?

671
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:31,999
I want to talk to you.

672
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:36,999
How can I help?

673
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:38,999
I'll come later.

674
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,999
I'm listening, ma'am!
Tell me.

675
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,999
I wanted to make a booking.

676
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:45,999
Sure.

677
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:49,999
For my wedding.

678
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:55,999
The Sunday after the Diwali Carnival.

679
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:00,999
Could you hurry it up?

680
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:08,999
Is the booking confirmed?

681
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,999
But I'm not carrying any money.

682
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:20,999
I'll come back tomorrow?

683
00:57:20,999 --> 00:57:23,999
You don't need to come back.
Your booking is confirmed.

684
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:25,999
I guess I'll leave.

685
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:26,999
Congratulations on your wedding!

686
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,999
You've made the right decision.

687
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:36,999
By choosing our photo studio
for the wedding.

688
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:26,999
I should have done this at home.

689
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,999
Is your wedding dress ready?

690
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,999
The skirt is pink.
The blouse, yellow.

691
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:47,999
The stole is golden,
so are the sandals.

692
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:51,999
Jewellery on rent...
a gemstones set.

693
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:55,999
A satin negligee for the honeymoon.

694
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:59,999
I just need a new bra
for the wedding night.

695
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:04,999
A special bra for a girl's
most special night.

696
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,999
Doesn't your company make
these special bras?

697
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:09,999
I'm sure you wear them.

698
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:12,999
That's why every night
is your wedding night.

699
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:16,999
The perfect life!

700
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:23,999
What happened?

701
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:26,999
Why are you crying?

702
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,999
Just hurts a little.

703
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:32,999
Nobody hurts when I wax.

704
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:36,999
He...

705
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:40,999
He doesn't love you down there?

706
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,999
Does he at least kiss you?

707
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,999
Why are you asking
if you know?

708
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:55,999
You know what our problem is?

709
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:00,999
We dream too much.

710
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:48,999
Don't forget to turn the lights off.

711
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:00,999
Rosy was touching herself
with her bare hands.

712
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:03,999
Soon Prince Charming
would caress her body

713
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:05,999
with red roses, she hoped.

714
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:09,999
Rosy wanted to fly out of the window

715
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,999
and jump straight into
Prince Charming's bed.

716
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:17,999
But was Prince Charming also
aching to caress Rosy's body?

717
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:21,999
This question haunted Rosy.

718
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:30,999
[Lipstick Dreams - Book Title]

719
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,999
Hello?

720
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:55,999
Who is it?

721
01:01:56,999 --> 01:01:58,999
Forgotten your name, bastard?

722
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:02,999
I'll kick your ass!

723
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:15,999
Hello!

724
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:21,999
Hello... Jaspal?

725
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:23,999
Yes?

726
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:25,999
Who's this?

727
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:30,999
Hello...
- Hello...

728
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,999
Just wanted to say hello?

729
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,999
I wanted to say hello.

730
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:40,999
Are you a telephone operator?

731
01:02:42,999 --> 01:02:46,999
Also, I've not forgotten my name.

732
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:49,999
And I'm not a telephone operator.

733
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:53,999
So tell me your name.

734
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:01,999
You know my name

735
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:04,999
but I don't know yours.

736
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:06,999
Isn't that unfair?

737
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,999
Rosy.
- Rosy? Are you Christian?

738
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:15,999
You don't talk to Christian girls?

739
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:21,999
That depends on the girl.

740
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:27,999
Tell me more about Rosy.

741
01:03:33,999 --> 01:03:38,999
Rosy gazes out of her
window every evening.

742
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:40,999
What does she see?

743
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:41,999
Dreams.

744
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,999
What kind of dreams?

745
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:51,999
Rosy will tell you tomorrow.

746
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:52,999
Listen... hello...

747
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,999
First love

748
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:53,999
Love

749
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:57,999
Sweet love

750
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:00,999
First love

751
01:05:00,999 --> 01:05:01,999
Endless love

752
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,999
Sweet love

753
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:05,999
Hot dress!

754
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:07,999
Thanks!

755
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:08,999
Boots?

756
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:13,999
Hottie!
- Thanks!

757
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:15,999
Senseless love

758
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:16,999
Shameless love

759
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:19,999
Namrata, about the audition...

760
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,999
Pout!

761
01:05:23,999 --> 01:05:25,999
I'm sorry!
- Ms. Ripped Jeans!

762
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:27,999
What are you drinking?

763
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:29,999
Anything.

764
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:30,999
Beer.

765
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:32,999
Cheers!

766
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:38,999
Virgin?

767
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:44,999
No... no. Are you crazy?

768
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:48,999
Naughty love

769
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:52,999
First love

770
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:12,999
Swept away by the heady wind

771
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:20,999
I fly, I soar, it's you!

772
01:06:21,999 --> 01:06:27,999
Your shadow grooving with me

773
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:35,999
By my side, it's you!

774
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:40,999
Like fireflies in my veins

775
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:42,999
Burning love

776
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,999
First love

777
01:06:57,999 --> 01:06:58,999
Namrata!

778
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:00,999
Are you alright?

779
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:11,999
Such an awesome party.
I'm having so much fun.

780
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,999
I completely forgot to ask
about the audition.

781
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,999
You've had too much to drink.
Take it easy.

782
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,999
I'm pregnant, not drunk!

783
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:13,417
You like Led Zeppelin?

784
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:15,999
Stairway to Heaven
is one of my forever favourites.

785
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:22,999
Wow! I don't know any girl
in Bhopal who...

786
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:26,417
How come I never
noticed you before?

787
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,999
Were you hiding under a burkha?

788
01:08:29,999 --> 01:08:31,999
Exactly! I've taken it off now.

789
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:42,999
Let's jam tomorrow?

790
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:45,999
Are you crazy?
Remember my audition?

791
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,999
I'll take care of that.
- Really?

792
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:57,999
Thank you.

793
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:06,999
What?

794
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,999
I really like girls who sing.

795
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:17,999
And girls who sing Zeppelin?

796
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:30,999
I can't!

797
01:09:35,999 --> 01:09:38,999
I'm... sorry?

798
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:51,999
Dhruv!

799
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:04,999
Rehana!
- Coming, mother.

800
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,999
Rehana!
- Almost done.

801
01:11:25,999 --> 01:11:29,999
- Seems the coach is stroking
some new girl in his thoughts.

802
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:39,999
Usha, chest out!
- Chest?

803
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:41,999
Out.

804
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:48,999
How dare you threaten to evict us?

805
01:11:48,999 --> 01:11:49,999
You'll have to vacate this house.

806
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:51,999
It's a government notice.

807
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:53,999
Bastard, you know who I am!

808
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:55,999
Watch your tongue.
We are government officials.

809
01:11:55,999 --> 01:11:57,999
Did you find auntie?

810
01:11:57,999 --> 01:11:59,999
She's not at the prayer meeting.

811
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:29,999
What did you say, asshole?

812
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:31,999
Don't raise your hand.

813
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,999
I'll get you locked up.

814
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:35,999
Try... try!

815
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:38,999
Your property is gone!

816
01:12:39,999 --> 01:12:40,999
Don't mess with the government.

817
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:43,999
How did the government
think of Hawai Manzil?

818
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:47,999
Auntie, they're threatening to
tear down the building.

819
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:50,999
I'll tear you down first!

820
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,999
That's enough, Ram!

821
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:55,999
Auntie, the house was built in 1902.

822
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:58,999
If it collapses, the government
will be held responsible.

823
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:02,999
Are there no other
old buildings in Bhopal?

824
01:13:02,999 --> 01:13:05,999
That the government is
picking on Hawai Manzil?

825
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:09,999
We all know who's
put you up to this.

826
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,999
How much has
Bemisaal Builders paid you?

827
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:18,999
Keys?

828
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:28,999
You weren't at the
prayer meeting, auntie.

829
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:29,999
Where were you?

830
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:31,999
At another temple.

831
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:34,999
And the silent swami?
Nobody knows of him.

832
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:38,999
To know him
you need to be silent.

833
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,999
That you can't do!

834
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:54,999
Mrs. Aslam... have a seat.

835
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:56,999
Tea or coffee?

836
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,999
No, thank you.
Just wanted to meet my husband.

837
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:03,999
Is he coming here again today?

838
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:07,999
Please tell him

839
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,999
we'll hire him only if he can
help us buy Hawai Manzil.

840
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:13,999
Otherwise, he need not come here.

841
01:14:42,999 --> 01:14:44,999
Sorry...

842
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:16,999
Why are we having
breakfast at dinner?

843
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:17,999
Eat it, or go to bed.

844
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:20,999
Mother, let's buy firecrackers.

845
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,999
No one's bursting crackers.

846
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:24,999
Always creating commotion.

847
01:15:24,999 --> 01:15:25,999
No crackers this Diwali.

848
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:08,417
His wide forehead,
his twinkling eyes

849
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:11,999
his firm, wet lips.

850
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,999
Rosy thinks that
behind that chiselled chest

851
01:16:14,999 --> 01:16:20,999
Jaspal has a tender (Komal) heart.

852
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,999
Komal?
- Yes.

853
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:24,999
Komal.

854
01:16:24,999 --> 01:16:26,999
Surprised?

855
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:32,999
And Jaspal's voice is intoxicating.

856
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:39,999
And Rosy's voice is... sweet.

857
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:44,999
- And sometimes it's very...
- Very?

858
01:16:44,999 --> 01:16:48,999
Rosy's voice is very sexy.

859
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:51,999
Not just her voice

860
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:56,999
Rosy herself is very sexy.

861
01:17:01,999 --> 01:17:04,999
Jaspal wants to see Rosy.

862
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:08,999
Jaspal can see Rosy everyday

863
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:10,999
in his dreams.

864
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:12,999
In my dreams?

865
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:17,999
'Lipstick Dreams'

866
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:19,999
'Lipstick Dreams'?

867
01:17:20,999 --> 01:17:25,999
Interesting.
- Rosy wears red lipstick.

868
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:29,999
And in these dreams,
what is Rosy wearing?

869
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:33,999
Blouse.
- Blouse?

870
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:36,999
Sleeveless blouse.

871
01:17:37,999 --> 01:17:39,999
Ah... sleeveless blouse!

872
01:17:41,999 --> 01:17:44,999
And a rose sari.

873
01:17:47,999 --> 01:17:49,999
And under the blouse?

874
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:51,999
Brassiere.

875
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:54,999
Br... Brassie...?

876
01:17:55,999 --> 01:17:56,999
Bra.

877
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:58,999
Bra.

878
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:02,999
What colour?

879
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:03,999
Black.

880
01:18:04,999 --> 01:18:08,999
Rosy, put your hand
inside your blouse.

881
01:18:10,999 --> 01:18:12,999
And open up the hooks.

882
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:42,999
- Love... love... love... love!

883
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:46,999
- There's someone special in everyone's life.

884
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:52,999
- One look and your heart races wildly.

885
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:56,999
- So this song's dedicated to the
love birds of Bhopal.

886
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,999
- With love from RJ Reshma.

887
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:00,999
- Stay tuned to Radio Bhopal.

888
01:19:10,999 --> 01:19:13,999
That special look

889
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,999
Those shy eyes

890
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:20,999
Those unspoken words

891
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:27,999
My eyes search you out

892
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:34,999
Even though it's sheer madness

893
01:19:49,999 --> 01:19:53,999
Right to jeans, right to live!

894
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:57,999
Fuck you!

895
01:20:18,999 --> 01:20:20,999
Your father's phone number?

896
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:23,000
8-7-1-9-5....

897
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:26,999
This number's incorrect.

898
01:20:26,999 --> 01:20:28,999
Rehana Abidi!

899
01:20:28,999 --> 01:20:30,999
Messing with the police?

900
01:20:30,999 --> 01:20:33,999
Give us the correct number
or we will find it.

901
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:37,999
8-7-1-9-5....

902
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:52,999
After the honeymoon,
we'll come straight

903
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:55,999
to our permanent residence.

904
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,999
We'll put another TV here.

905
01:21:16,999 --> 01:21:18,999
The entire world in your living room.

906
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,999
You'll never have to set foot
outside the house.

907
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:29,999
The apartment on the second floor.

908
01:21:29,999 --> 01:21:32,999
You can greet your mother
every morning from here.

909
01:21:34,999 --> 01:21:36,999
Her house will be ready in two months.

910
01:21:37,999 --> 01:21:38,999
I've planned everything.

911
01:22:12,999 --> 01:22:17,999
Father... no, they didn't arrest me.
Go home.

912
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:21,999
I'll explain once I'm home.

913
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:34,999
Where are you running off to?

914
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:37,999
Shameless girl!

915
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,999
Disgracing the family.

916
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:42,999
Locked up inside the police station.

917
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:43,999
What were you protesting against?

918
01:22:44,999 --> 01:22:45,999
I wasn't.

919
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:48,999
Other students were
protesting the jeans ban.

920
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:49,999
I wear a burkha.

921
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:51,999
Jeans don't concern me.

922
01:22:52,999 --> 01:22:54,999
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

923
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:56,999
Why were you in the wrong place?

924
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:00,999
Next time round,
I won't forgive you.

925
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:00,999
We're cursed!

926
01:23:05,999 --> 01:23:06,999
Where to?

927
01:23:06,999 --> 01:23:07,999
Who'll finish the work?

928
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:23,999
[Jam tomorrow?]

929
01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:29,999
[I don't know]

930
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:36,999
[Please]

931
01:23:39,999 --> 01:23:41,999
There's some times

932
01:23:41,999 --> 01:23:46,999
I think I just forget where I belong

933
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:52,999
I feel I'm just meant to lie
in your arms, baby

934
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:56,999
The way you're looking at me

935
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:59,999
I can tell I'm hypnotised

936
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:02,999
I'd jump off a cliff

937
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:05,999
Into your arms, baby

938
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:09,999
[Dhruv Bose in a relationship
with Rehana Abidi]

939
01:25:16,999 --> 01:25:17,999
Follow that rickshaw.

940
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:29,999
Komal, I never imagined.

941
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:30,999
What?

942
01:25:32,999 --> 01:25:33,999
That you'd pick up so quickly.

943
01:25:33,999 --> 01:25:34,999
Sir.

944
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:37,999
I'll leave?

945
01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:41,999
Bye.

946
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:46,999
You're so quiet in the pool.
- Really?

947
01:27:13,999 --> 01:27:14,999
What are you doing here?

948
01:27:15,999 --> 01:27:18,999
Bastard! I'm marrying
someone else

949
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:20,999
and you won't even stop me?

950
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:26,999
Is that how much you love me?

951
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:33,999
The bathroom's empty, let's go.

952
01:27:38,999 --> 01:27:40,999
Rosy's taken her clothes off.

953
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,999
Doesn't Rosy want Jaspal
also to undress?

954
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:49,999
She does.

955
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,999
Rosy wants Jaspal so bad.

956
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:56,999
Won't Rosy unzip Jaspal's jeans?

957
01:27:56,999 --> 01:27:58,999
Yes.

958
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:07,999
Rosy is unbuttoning Jaspal's jeans.

959
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:14,999
And she's unzipping his jeans.

960
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:22,999
Jaspal's lips are kissing

961
01:28:22,999 --> 01:28:25,999
Rosy's lips down there.

962
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:46,999
I've planned everything.

963
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:51,999
We'll leave for Delhi the day after
the Diwali Carnival.

964
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:55,000
I've booked our train tickets.

965
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,999
Hear me?

966
01:29:05,999 --> 01:29:07,999
I wouldn't even go to London with you.

967
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:12,999
Who's asking you to go London?

968
01:29:19,999 --> 01:29:21,999
Don't act smart.

969
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:25,000
We'll have a blast in Delhi.

970
01:29:32,999 --> 01:29:34,999
Why don't you ask
your Mr. Moneybags?

971
01:29:36,999 --> 01:29:37,999
He'll take you.

972
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:41,999
Because he'll bring me
back right here.

973
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:46,999
The same rotten lanes,
the same rotten life.

974
01:29:46,999 --> 01:29:48,999
I don't want to live here!

975
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:50,999
You are coming with me.
That's final.

976
01:29:52,999 --> 01:29:54,999
I'm your Baby Doll after all.

977
01:29:54,999 --> 01:29:57,999
You are just a doll, baby!

978
01:30:01,999 --> 01:30:04,999
I can't do this anymore, Leela.

979
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:05,999
What can't you do?

980
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:15,999
Arshad, let's at least have sex.

981
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:17,999
Sex? Is that all you ever want?

982
01:30:18,999 --> 01:30:20,999
If you want sex so bad

983
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:21,999
I'll call the boys in.

984
01:30:24,999 --> 01:30:25,999
Don't touch me!

985
01:30:26,999 --> 01:30:28,999
Get your hands off.

986
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:33,999
Get out of here!

987
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:35,999
I'm done with you.

988
01:30:36,999 --> 01:30:38,999
Get out.

989
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,999
Fuck off!

990
01:30:58,999 --> 01:31:01,000
Rosy's hair was dishevelled.

991
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:03,999
She didn't have the guts
to look into the mirror.

992
01:31:03,999 --> 01:31:07,999
In the mirror she would see
the graveyard of her desires.

993
01:31:09,999 --> 01:31:14,999
But amidst the thousand graves
of buried desire, one dream was alive.

994
01:31:14,999 --> 01:31:18,999
A dream, Rosy had not given up on.

995
01:31:25,999 --> 01:31:27,999
Rosy picked up the shovel

996
01:31:27,999 --> 01:31:31,999
and set off into the graveyard
in search of that dream.

997
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:39,999
Hello!

998
01:31:39,999 --> 01:31:40,999
Yes?

999
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:44,999
I'm from Magic Products.
Some Diwali offers...

1000
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,999
But I have guests over.
Another day perhaps?

1001
01:31:47,999 --> 01:31:53,000
Your guests will enjoy the demo.
Just five minutes.

1002
01:31:55,999 --> 01:31:58,999
I've got something that will
leave you stunned.

1003
01:32:09,999 --> 01:32:12,999
Magic Lollipop Exerciser!

1004
01:32:12,999 --> 01:32:14,999
It's Japanese.

1005
01:32:15,999 --> 01:32:16,999
Suck on it harder.

1006
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:18,999
Have you seen the cheeks
of Japanese women?

1007
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:21,000
Not a wrinkle at the age of 50!

1008
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,999
Use this and you'll have
the smile of a geisha.

1009
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:27,999
Suck a little longer.

1010
01:32:28,999 --> 01:32:30,999
Great practice for keeping
your boyfriend happy.

1011
01:32:33,999 --> 01:32:35,999
Here, try mine.

1012
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:38,999
But, this was in your mouth!

1013
01:32:38,999 --> 01:32:43,999
Of course, you can't put
what's mine into your mouth.

1014
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:49,999
Shirin Aslam, wife of Rahim Aslam.

1015
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:03,999
At last, the night Rosy had been
desperately waiting for!

1016
01:33:04,999 --> 01:33:07,999
It was the Carnival of dreams.

1017
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,999
The street was dressed like a bride.

1018
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:14,999
At the window,
lay the bouquet of red roses!

1019
01:33:14,999 --> 01:33:16,999
There was a note too.

1020
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:19,999
"Tonight I'm coming
to kiss your inner jewels.

1021
01:33:19,999 --> 01:33:21,999
Your Prince Charming."

1022
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:24,999
Rosy's insides now
erupted into a volcano.

1023
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,000
As though the burning desire
of women through the ages

1024
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,999
was all embodied in
Rosy's body.

1025
01:33:29,999 --> 01:33:32,999
Tonight was going to be
a night of reckoning.

1026
01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:35,999
Rosy was sure all her dreams
would come true tonight.

1027
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,999
Auntie, I've never seen you
in a rose sari.

1028
01:33:44,999 --> 01:33:45,999
You look very pretty.

1029
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:49,999
Did you speak to your husband?

1030
01:33:50,999 --> 01:33:53,999
Passion, you took my life

1031
01:33:53,999 --> 01:33:55,999
Without asking

1032
01:33:55,999 --> 01:33:58,999
Passion, I gave you my life

1033
01:33:58,999 --> 01:34:00,999
Without knowing

1034
01:34:02,999 --> 01:34:03,999
[Are you with Dhruv
at the Carnival?]

1035
01:34:06,999 --> 01:34:08,999
Where on earth is this Hawai Manzil?

1036
01:34:18,999 --> 01:34:20,999
Aren't you from Bhopal Arts College?
- Yes.

1037
01:34:20,999 --> 01:34:21,999
Do you know Rehana Abidi?

1038
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:25,999
Red lipstick on my lips
The black net can't veil my desire

1039
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:26,999
Enough pictures.

1040
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,999
One more.
So we can see the rose.

1041
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:31,999
Here, click the rose.

1042
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,999
I was drunk on passion

1043
01:34:34,999 --> 01:34:39,999
T'was a romantic night
Just like in the story

1044
01:34:41,999 --> 01:34:44,999
Auntie, we want a photo too!

1045
01:34:44,999 --> 01:34:47,999
Not now.
- Yes, now.

1046
01:34:47,999 --> 01:34:48,999
Coach-sir!

1047
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:49,999
Hi!

1048
01:34:49,999 --> 01:34:51,000
Come join us.

1049
01:34:51,999 --> 01:34:52,999
Sure.

1050
01:34:55,999 --> 01:34:57,999
Hello, Usha-ji.

1051
01:34:57,999 --> 01:34:58,999
Happy Diwali!

1052
01:34:58,999 --> 01:35:01,999
Shift in please.

1053
01:35:03,999 --> 01:35:04,999
A little more.

1054
01:35:05,999 --> 01:35:06,999
You are looking good.

1055
01:35:09,999 --> 01:35:12,999
And our new Sales Trainer is

1056
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:13,999
Shirin Aslam!

1057
01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:17,999
In the carnival of dreams
I borrow a smile

1058
01:35:17,999 --> 01:35:21,999
In the market of happiness
I shop for dreams

1059
01:35:21,999 --> 01:35:22,999
Congratulations!

1060
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:27,999
Thank you!

1061
01:35:27,999 --> 01:35:30,999
- Get a family photo this Diwali!

1062
01:35:31,999 --> 01:35:32,999
Bangles?

1063
01:35:35,999 --> 01:35:36,999
Let's get a photo.

1064
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:42,999
You were at our engagement?

1065
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:44,999
Recognise him?

1066
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:46,999
I don't know.

1067
01:35:46,999 --> 01:35:48,999
All photographers look
the same to me.

1068
01:35:50,999 --> 01:35:51,999
She's kidding.

1069
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:54,999
50 Rupees.
- Sure.

1070
01:35:55,999 --> 01:35:56,999
Careful.

1071
01:35:57,999 --> 01:35:59,999
Show some intimacy.

1072
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:03,999
Hurry up.

1073
01:36:03,999 --> 01:36:05,999
Strike a romantic pose.

1074
01:36:05,999 --> 01:36:07,999
Well... okay.

1075
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:09,999
Anything goes.

1076
01:36:10,999 --> 01:36:11,999
Ready?

1077
01:36:13,999 --> 01:36:16,999
Passion, you took my life

1078
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:18,999
Without asking

1079
01:36:18,999 --> 01:36:21,999
Passion, I gave you my life

1080
01:36:21,999 --> 01:36:23,999
Without knowing

1081
01:36:24,999 --> 01:36:27,999
I was hoping you'd make it

1082
01:36:27,999 --> 01:36:30,999
so we could talk...

1083
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:33,999
Pardon?

1084
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:35,999
How's the coffee?

1085
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:36,999
Good.

1086
01:36:40,999 --> 01:36:44,999
Get an icicle for the coach also.
- Which flavour?

1087
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:45,999
Rose.

1088
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:57,999
It's knotted.

1089
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:14,999
Should we wait till
the wedding night?

1090
01:37:14,999 --> 01:37:15,999
Why?

1091
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:20,999
For our first time,
we'll play some music

1092
01:37:20,999 --> 01:37:23,999
under the moonlight.

1093
01:37:25,999 --> 01:37:27,999
Not on the sly.

1094
01:37:27,999 --> 01:37:30,999
They say the first time is special.

1095
01:37:31,999 --> 01:37:33,000
You remember it for life.

1096
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:37,999
Why do I have to steal
My moments of desire?

1097
01:37:37,999 --> 01:37:42,999
Why is the game of passion so unfair?

1098
01:37:44,999 --> 01:37:50,999
It's like we've left all our
problems down below.

1099
01:37:52,999 --> 01:37:55,999
I want to stay here forever.

1100
01:37:55,999 --> 01:37:57,999
Passion, you took my life

1101
01:37:57,999 --> 01:37:59,999
Without asking

1102
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,999
Passion, I gave you my life

1103
01:38:02,999 --> 01:38:04,999
Without knowing

1104
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:27,000
Your wife is extremely talented.

1105
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,999
She'll definitely rise
in the company.

1106
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:33,999
Thank you.

1107
01:38:37,999 --> 01:38:39,999
How dare you, bastard!

1108
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:40,999
Asshole!

1109
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,999
Stay within your limits.

1110
01:38:43,999 --> 01:38:44,999
Cheapskate!

1111
01:38:53,999 --> 01:38:55,999
Rehana Abidi, the thief!

1112
01:39:00,999 --> 01:39:02,999
Remember?

1113
01:39:08,999 --> 01:39:09,999
Look, what we have here!

1114
01:39:14,999 --> 01:39:16,999
Right to jeans, right to live?

1115
01:39:17,999 --> 01:39:19,999
Who are you?

1116
01:39:26,999 --> 01:39:28,999
Serves you right, Dhruv Bose!

1117
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,999
You left me for this bitch.
This bloody fake!

1118
01:39:36,999 --> 01:39:39,999
Now you know how I got pregnant.

1119
01:39:46,999 --> 01:39:49,999
Boys, have you seen the coach?

1120
01:39:49,999 --> 01:39:51,999
He's left.

1121
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:52,999
He left?

1122
01:39:55,999 --> 01:39:56,999
Show me those.

1123
01:39:56,999 --> 01:39:58,999
Some ice cream for you?

1124
01:40:00,999 --> 01:40:01,999
Sure.

1125
01:40:09,999 --> 01:40:10,999
What're you doing?

1126
01:40:12,999 --> 01:40:13,999
Have you lost your mind?

1127
01:40:13,999 --> 01:40:16,999
I'm burning with jealousy.

1128
01:40:16,999 --> 01:40:20,999
Let me go, Arshad.
- Please listen to me, Baby Doll!

1129
01:40:20,999 --> 01:40:21,000
What?

1130
01:40:22,999 --> 01:40:24,999
Have you cancelled the tickets?

1131
01:40:26,999 --> 01:40:28,999
Tell me.

1132
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:31,999
No.

1133
01:40:34,999 --> 01:40:36,999
The train is tomorrow morning?

1134
01:40:41,999 --> 01:40:43,000
Yes or no?

1135
01:40:43,999 --> 01:40:45,000
Yes.
- What time?

1136
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:47,999
Eleven.

1137
01:40:50,999 --> 01:40:52,999
I'll see you at the station by 10:30.
Promise!

1138
01:40:52,999 --> 01:40:55,999
You are lying.
- I swear, Baby Doll.

1139
01:40:55,999 --> 01:40:56,999
We'll have a blast in Delhi.

1140
01:40:56,999 --> 01:40:58,999
We'll roam free
in the mountains.

1141
01:41:02,999 --> 01:41:03,000
Let's go!

1142
01:42:07,999 --> 01:42:08,999
You're a thief, Rehana.

1143
01:42:11,999 --> 01:42:14,999
An honest shopkeeper's daughter,
steals from others' shops.

1144
01:42:16,999 --> 01:42:18,999
Didn't we instill the right values?

1145
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,999
You are disowning our
identity and heritage.

1146
01:42:24,999 --> 01:42:27,999
Embarrassed by the very burkha
that earns us our daily bread?

1147
01:42:28,999 --> 01:42:31,999
You're ashamed of wearing a burkha!

1148
01:42:32,999 --> 01:42:34,999
I'm ashamed you
are my daughter.

1149
01:42:41,999 --> 01:42:43,999
- Start looking for a groom for her.
- Yes.

1150
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:46,999
- No need to study further.

1151
01:42:47,999 --> 01:42:48,999
- Stay at home and work at the shop.

1152
01:43:29,999 --> 01:43:31,999
I left it in the car?
Glad you found it.

1153
01:43:35,999 --> 01:43:37,999
You forgot to delete the video clip.

1154
01:43:41,999 --> 01:43:43,999
Wasn't it the night
of our engagement?

1155
01:43:45,999 --> 01:43:47,999
Why did you go
through my phone?

1156
01:43:47,999 --> 01:43:49,999
You're the one
who's cheated on me.

1157
01:44:08,999 --> 01:44:11,999
I've been trying to
talk to you for a while.

1158
01:44:36,999 --> 01:44:38,999
You've become very gutsy.

1159
01:44:38,999 --> 01:44:42,999
Taking a job,
without my permission.

1160
01:44:42,999 --> 01:44:46,999
If I earn, it'll help
pay the bills.

1161
01:44:46,999 --> 01:44:48,999
You want to roam
the streets as a salesgirl?

1162
01:44:48,999 --> 01:44:50,999
And why did you
go to her house?

1163
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:52,999
To embarrass me?

1164
01:44:52,999 --> 01:44:55,999
If we talked to each other
I would never have gone.

1165
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:56,999
Raising your voice!

1166
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:59,999
Just because you've earned
a few cents?

1167
01:44:59,999 --> 01:45:02,999
To talk to you,
I have to meet your mistress!

1168
01:45:03,999 --> 01:45:04,999
Shameless!

1169
01:45:07,999 --> 01:45:08,999
You're the one who's shameless.

1170
01:45:08,999 --> 01:45:11,999
Seeing another woman...
no job, no salary.

1171
01:45:11,999 --> 01:45:13,999
You don't care about your family.

1172
01:45:19,999 --> 01:45:20,999
Now talk!

1173
01:45:35,999 --> 01:45:36,999
You're a woman.

1174
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:39,999
Don't try to wear the pants.

1175
01:45:41,999 --> 01:45:42,999
Turn down the job offer

1176
01:45:43,999 --> 01:45:45,999
and sit home quietly.

1177
01:46:00,999 --> 01:46:01,999
What is it?

1178
01:46:02,999 --> 01:46:03,999
What's the problem?

1179
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,999
The kids are sleeping.

1180
01:46:06,999 --> 01:46:07,999
What has happened?

1181
01:46:08,999 --> 01:46:10,999
Will someone tell me what's going on?

1182
01:46:10,999 --> 01:46:13,999
What do you think you're doing?
- I'll tell you.

1183
01:46:13,999 --> 01:46:15,999
Stop! That's mine.

1184
01:46:16,999 --> 01:46:18,999
Stop it! Let go of my things.

1185
01:46:18,999 --> 01:46:20,999
Get out of my way.
- Don't you touch anything!

1186
01:46:20,999 --> 01:46:22,999
What's all this?

1187
01:46:23,999 --> 01:46:26,999
Give it to me.
- Come outside!

1188
01:46:27,999 --> 01:46:29,999
Behave yourself...

1189
01:46:29,999 --> 01:46:31,999
What's all this?

1190
01:46:32,999 --> 01:46:34,999
You should be ashamed
of yourself, auntie!

1191
01:46:35,999 --> 01:46:37,999
So much for her piety!

1192
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:41,999
Auntie, you've sullied
the family name.

1193
01:46:41,999 --> 01:46:43,999
Shame on you!

1194
01:46:43,999 --> 01:46:45,999
Look at this.

1195
01:46:49,999 --> 01:46:52,000
Lewd books,
indecent clothes.

1196
01:46:52,999 --> 01:46:55,999
Such obscenity at this age!

1197
01:46:55,999 --> 01:46:57,999
A 55-year old widow!

1198
01:46:57,999 --> 01:47:01,999
Making dirty phone calls
to a young boy.

1199
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:04,999
Disgusting!
- The old woman has no shame.

1200
01:47:04,999 --> 01:47:07,999
We look up to her as a mother.

1201
01:47:07,999 --> 01:47:09,999
And see what she's been doing.

1202
01:47:09,999 --> 01:47:11,000
Getting horny at this age!

1203
01:47:11,999 --> 01:47:13,000
Shameful!

1204
01:47:13,999 --> 01:47:14,999
What will you teach our kids?

1205
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:16,999
What did auntie do?
- Nothing.

1206
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:20,999
Get out of here!
Go live on the road.

1207
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Take these with you.

1208
01:47:23,999 --> 01:47:25,999
You were never Rosy.

1209
01:47:27,999 --> 01:47:29,999
Have you looked in the mirror?

1210
01:48:35,999 --> 01:48:37,999
All my things!

1211
01:49:22,999 --> 01:49:23,999
Auntie.

1212
01:49:25,999 --> 01:49:26,999
Let me.

1213
01:50:14,999 --> 01:50:16,999
Dreams.

1214
01:50:23,999 --> 01:50:25,999
Race Driver... Dreams.

1215
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:32,999
Love or Lust... Dreams.

1216
01:50:36,999 --> 01:50:37,999
Love Me Baby... Dreams.

1217
01:50:40,999 --> 01:50:42,999
Now or Never... Dreams

1218
01:50:46,999 --> 01:50:48,999
Lipstick Dreams.

1219
01:50:50,999 --> 01:50:54,999
I had three pages left...
read them.

1220
01:50:56,999 --> 01:50:58,999
When Rosy opened the door

1221
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,999
it wasn't the tenant standing there.

1222
01:51:01,999 --> 01:51:03,999
It was the florist!

1223
01:51:04,999 --> 01:51:06,999
Rosy had never
paid attention to him.

1224
01:51:06,999 --> 01:51:11,999
Now she saw his broad
chiselled shoulders

1225
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:13,999
and the passion in his eyes.

1226
01:51:15,999 --> 01:51:18,999
So he sent the flowers,
not the tenant?

1227
01:51:23,999 --> 01:51:24,999
Go on.

1228
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,999
Before the florist could speak

1229
01:51:27,999 --> 01:51:29,999
Rosy turned towards him.

1230
01:51:29,999 --> 01:51:34,999
Instantly, he pulled Rosy
into his big strong arms.

1231
01:51:34,999 --> 01:51:37,999
And began kissing her neck softly.

1232
01:51:37,999 --> 01:51:41,999
Then he pressed his lips
into Rosy's red lips.

1233
01:51:41,999 --> 01:51:44,999
Oh, God! He smudged her lipstick.

1234
01:51:47,999 --> 01:51:49,999
These stories mislead us.

1235
01:51:49,999 --> 01:51:53,999
Promising us that we too
can live like Rosy.

1236
01:51:56,999 --> 01:51:59,999
They are misleading.

1237
01:52:00,999 --> 01:52:03,999
But they also give us
the courage to dream.

1238
01:52:06,999 --> 01:52:08,999
Rosy is lucky!

1239
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:12,999
It's hard to gain the love
of one man

1240
01:52:12,999 --> 01:52:15,999
but Rosy here is basking
in the love of two men!

1241
01:52:15,999 --> 01:52:17,999
How is that lucky?

1242
01:52:17,999 --> 01:52:19,999
She's stuck between the two of them.

1243
01:52:23,999 --> 01:52:27,999
The florist told Rosy his name
â?? Prince Charming.

1244
01:52:28,999 --> 01:52:30,999
Rosy laughed out loud.

1245
01:52:30,999 --> 01:52:31,999
How silly she was!

1246
01:52:32,999 --> 01:52:35,999
Now she won't stare
stealthily at the bouquet.

1247
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,999
She'll openly call out
to her Prince Charming.

1248
01:52:38,999 --> 01:52:41,999
She won't veil her desire.

1249
01:52:41,999 --> 01:52:44,999
The iron bars at the window
cannot hold Rosy back now.

1250
01:52:45,999 --> 01:52:51,000
Rosy fixed her hair, wiped her tears
and jumped right out of the door.

1251
01:52:51,999 --> 01:52:53,999
The key to Rosy's caged dreams

1252
01:52:53,999 --> 01:52:55,999
always lay within her own heart.
