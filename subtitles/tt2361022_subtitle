l am your crazy lover, beloved.

5
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:42,018
After falling madly in love.

6
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,283
l got estranged from myself.

7
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,292

Crazy..

l am your crazy lover, beloved.

11
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:17,688
Stop! Don't come forward!

12
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,164
What do you think of yourself?
Don of town?

13
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,568
You are right. We are friends.

14
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:38,939
We are friends.

15
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,910
And in friendship chasing
each other, fighting, beating..

16
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:43,142
..that's ourjob.

17
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,547
He beat you.

18
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,976
And whoever
interferes in our friendship..

19
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:48,781
..he will be knockout.

20
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,480
He will checkout from the world.
Did you understand?

21
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,122
So the verse goes like this..

22
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,751
Wow! Wow! Wow!

23
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,092
Let me first recite it.
You have started applauding.

24
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,363
So the verse goes like this..

25
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:04,263
Now when we separate,
we might meet in dreams.

26
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,771
Wow! Marvelous! Amazing!

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,068
Did l finish it?

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,170
Now when we separate,
we might meet in dreams.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,044
The way you find
dried leaves in books.

30
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,879
Wow! Wow!
- Thanks.

31
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:20,613
You are talking about meeting whom?

32
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,054
After meeting you, my
desire of poetry died.

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:26,058
l had to pay such a
heavy price for my wife.

34
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,491
Wow! Wow!
- Keep quiet!

35
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,858
Why are you praising?

36
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:30,930
And you...what are you saying?

37
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,760
l am your wife.

38
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,325
You have a young son.

39
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,835
Does it suit you to recite poems?

40
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:41,439
O proud woman, you dwell in His world.

41
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:44,500
A damsel like you
can't dwell in this world.

42
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,239
Wow! Amazing! Marvelous!

43
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,281
Stop these praises and applauds.

44
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,747
Freeloaders, leave from here.

45
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:53,251
Don't you have any work to do?

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,220
Where are you taking the spoon?

47
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,449
What kind of people you bring? Leave.

48
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,252
Thieves.

49
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,888
Stealing my spoon.
- Look.

50
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,326
Did you see your friends?

51
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,920
Forget these sycophants.

52
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,159
Have you thought of
something for Basant?

53
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,326
Who is Basant?

54
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,925
Basant! Our son!

55
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,970
Yes. Of course.

56
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,029
He is of marriageable age.

57
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,367
Let him enjoy life before marriage..

58
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,910
..something that l couldn't do.

59
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,745
What do you mean?
- What kind of woman are you?

60
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,848
l mean, first let him fall
in love and then get married.

61
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,111
What! Love marriage!
- Yes.

62
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:28,814
ln arranged marriage l
didn't enjoy this merriment.

63
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,412
After getting married,
my son should say..

64
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,185
..Dad, l got a
chance to experience it.

65
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,557
Stop your useless rhyming slang.

66
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,787
Think about Basant.

67
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,397
The whole day he roams
with his vagabond friends.

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,174
l am ecstatic.

69
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,142
ln merriment.

70
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:04,690
l paid Re.1 and saw
her from the peephole.

71
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:11,931
She saw me and opened
the door trustingly.

72
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,568
And then there was a scuffle.

73
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,263
Her intention was bad.

74
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,898
That shameless girl
made my plight bad.

75
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,135
Shameless.

76
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,008
Shameless. Shameless girl.

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,072
Shameless girl. Shameless.

78
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:34,217
Shameless. Shameless girl.

79
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,381
Shameless girl. Shameless.

80
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:49,427

81
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,266

00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,242
l am crazy.

83
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,907
She is also crazy.

84
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:07,545
ln this thrilling world
our youth is smoldering.

85
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,486
We will sing and dance.

86
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,251
And have fun.

87
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:15,488
We will have a gala time,
my friends.

88
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:20,363
l paid Re.1 and saw
her from the peephole.

89
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:27,570
She saw me and opened
the door trustingly.

90
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,308
And then there was a scuffle.

91
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,039
Her intention was bad.

92
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,641
That shameless girl
made my plight bad.

93
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,878
Shameless.

94
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:04,438
l am ecstatic.

95
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,672
ln merriment.

96
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:09,442
ln merriment.

00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:11,541
ln merriment.

98
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,376
We will smolder.

99
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,114
We will die.

100
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:19,521
We will keep doing
something in merriment.

101
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,120
l am crazy.

102
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,961
She is also crazy.

103
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,628
ln this thrilling world

00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,477
Shameless. Shameless girl.

Shameless girl. Shameless.

107
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,616
Shameless. Shameless girl.

108
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,815

l am ecstatic.

112
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:35,259
l am ecstatic.

113
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,807
Ma'am, see her.
- Pathetic.

114
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,503
You said pathetic without seeing her.

115
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,240
l said it for the card.

116
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,340
Son, look. Did you like her?
- Very bad.

117
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:54,085
Son, at least look.
- lf l look, l will lose the game.

118
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,953
Ma'am, her name is Meeta.
- Yes.

119
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,116
Until now, nobody has won her heart.

120
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,059
And she is a very decent girl.

121
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,423
Show us the photos. Why
are you reciting poems?

122
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,466
l am a poet.
- Sir, l was also a poet.

123
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,967
ls that so? You must
have been a pathetic poet.

124
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,300
Now l understood why poets'
gathering has stopped in lndia.

125
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:17,241
Ma'am, she is Shalini. Her
mother's name is Malini.

126
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,039
She is an expert in sweeping.

00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:20,807
She is an expert in washing clothes.

She is an expert in cooking.

00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,415
She is an expert in swabbing.

130
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:27,248
Priest, are you searching
for a bride or a maid for me?

131
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,478
l can't take it anymore,
mother. l am leaving. l am sorry.

132
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,716
Son, where are you going?

133
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,657
Basant, listen. Have a look.
- He won't listen to anyone.

134
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,853
He is my son. He is romantic.

135
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,524
l will nab you. Where are you running?

136
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,965
l am an expert in catching girls.

137
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,502
My name is..

138
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,561
Hold on. Where are you running?

139
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,902
You are calling me as
if l am your boyfriend.

140
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,202
l am your husband.

141
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,210
Ape, come down. Get down.

142
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:00,184
You jumped and grabbed the fan.

143
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,483
Did your father have a fan shop?

144
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,489
No. Electric shop.

145
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,321
l am not running on battery. Get down.

146
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:12,922
l won't. - Get down. Why
are you spoiling my youth?

147
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:18,403
My darling, come. Come into my arms.

148
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:21,565
Come into loving arms.

149
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:24,906
Come. Come.

150
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,172
Shall l get down?
- Yes.

151
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,405
Current is passing through my body.

152
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,611
Who ruined the fuse?

153
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,116
Who is it? Come.

154
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,988
Wow! So much love
between father and daughter.

155
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,291
What did you say? She
must be your daughter.

156
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:46,161
She is my wife. Did you understand?

157
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,733
Did you bring any letter?

158
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,892
l didn't come to give a letter.

159
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,492
l came to ask your neighbor's address.

160
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,834
l couldn't find it.
So l came to inquire.

161
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:56,034
ls this my house or an
inquiry office? Get lost!

162
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,201
Get lost!
- Listen!

163
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,836
God knows from where they
barge into decent people's home!

164
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,772
Milkman. Oil vendor. Snack vendor.

165
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,647
The sweeper comes to sweep every hour.

166
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:07,515
ls she for sale?

167
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:11,179
lt's not their fault. l am beautiful.

00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:12,656
That's why they get attracted.

169

What are you?
- Beautiful.

170
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,691
Beautiful.

171
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,993
Should l send you to the
confectioner and make your sweet?

172
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,556
Let people taste it?
Distribute it in the locality?

00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,865
l will stitch your face.
l am a tailor.

174
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,064

And stitch you.

What are you doing?
- Running the machine.

177
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,507
You look so sweet when you are angry.

178
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,481
Quiet! Don't fool me
by making me laugh.

179
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,744
The postman spoiled my mood.

180
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,423
l will fetch liquor and come.
- What?

181
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,485

182
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,787
l will fetch liquor and come.

183
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,557
Uncle, why do you
always lock your wife?

184
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,068
You should trust her.

185
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,435
The way your father
trusts your mother?

186
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:03,236
Yes, absolutely. He is
in Dubai since 10 years.

187
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,901
He always sends money.

188
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,304
And he never doubted my mother.

189
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,910
What's your age, son?
- 8 years.

190
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,746
Yes. He is living
abroad since ten years.

191
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:13,945
And you are eight years old.

192
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,818
The day your father finds out,
he might lock your house too.

193
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,788
Son, leave. Leave.
- What is this, uncle?

194
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,291
Leave.

195
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,223
This is the ambiance of the locality.

196
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,057
lf l don't lock the door,
what else do l do?

197
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:32,036
Live performances by music
talents of lndia at Jodhpur, Rajasthan.

198

Venue, King's auditorium.

199
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,466
What are you doing?

200
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,935
There is a music
competition in Jodhpur.

201
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,704
The winner will
become a music director.

202
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,405
You want to go?
- l am not so lucky.

203
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,879
l can just see the poster.

204
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:44,244
You are right. Come.

205

00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:09,334
lt's okay.
- You are great.

213
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,794
What did you do?
- l am so sorry. l am so sorry.

214
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,754
l broke it by mistake. lt was
for Rs.2000, right? Rs.2000.

215
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,355
Take Rs.2000.
- Sir?

216
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:35,992
l am so sorry.
- But, sir..

00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:37,929
Sir, listen..
- l didn't break it deliberately.

218
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,766
l broke it by mistake. l am so sorry.

219
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:42,401
What will l say to the customer?

220
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,035
Basant, you broke it deliberately,
didn't you?

221
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,238
Yes.
- Why?

222
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:51,009
Because l gain whatever l like.

223
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,615
lf it can't be mine, it can't
belong to anybody else too. Come.

224
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:55,881
Hello everybody.

225
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:59,516
Why do all of you look so sad?

226
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,456
l was thinking that
our names are so similar.

227
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,791
Basant and Vasant.

228
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,889
But our luck is so different.

229
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,332
You are a billionaire.
And l am a pauper.

230
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:13,271
Friends, to eradicate
your poverty forever..

231

..l have brought a magical box.

232
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,932
lf you have such a box,
open it quickly.

233
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,874
Yes! Open it! Open it!

234
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,674
Open sesame!

235
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:23,909
Open sesame! Open sesame!

236
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,210
lt's an invitation card.

237
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:28,378
Will you read it? Read.

Hey..

247
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,848
My name among such famous names?

248
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:05,249
But..

249
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,251
..to include my name among them..

250
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,495
..you must have spent
at least 10-12 lakhs.

251
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:16,431
Come on. lf 10-12 lakhs can
bring a smile on your face..

252
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,094
..then it's a cheap deal for me.

You are most welcome, sir.

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,230
Yes, sir. Thank you.

259
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,901
Wow! What aroma!

260
00:14:58,244 --> 00:14:59,643
Keep it. l will handle the rest.

261
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,838
First handle yourself.

262
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:03,143
He is eating in a
five-star hotel for the first time.

263
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:04,443
Have some shame.

264
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,847
Funny.
- You guys are fighting over food.

265
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,442
You guys tolerate him.
l will just come.

266
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,679
Hey..

267
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:21,620
Hey..

268
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,994
Where did my other earring go?

269
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,195
l don't know where it fell down.

270
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:34,766
Hello. Hi, dad.

271
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:38,668
Yes. Basant, how are you?

272
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:42,135
Dad, your son is madly in love.

273
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,936
But l lose the girl every time.

274
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,567
That's why l am very sad.

275
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:49,408
Dad, she is mind-blowing.
She is beautiful!

276
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:52,517
Dad, l see her again and
again and then lose her.

277
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,016
Why do l lose her every time, dad?

278
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,348
That's the thing.

279
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:56,911
Before marriage you
lose sight of the girl.

280
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,650
After marriage she becomes your wife.

281
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,925
But grab that girl.

282
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,954
l will never leave her, dad.

283
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,259
Your son has liked a
girl for the first time.

284
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,096
l just need your blessing.
- lt's with you.

285
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,328
Bye, dad.
- Bye.

286
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,529
l will hang up now.

287
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,735
What happened?

288
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:20,277
lf you want to
praise someone, praise me.

289
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,903
l taught him. l will show you.

290
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:23,541
ln college..

291
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:24,741
lt's too big.

292
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,115
ln college l was the
football champion for three years.

293
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,349
l will show you how it's done.

294
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,663
ls this yours?
- This is my spoon.

295
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,094
No problem.

296
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:52,303
This is Jodhpur. Where
are you leaving me alone?

297
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:59,613
l am a crazy lover.

298
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,525
l am a crazy lover.

299
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,289
l am a crazy lover.

300
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,833
l am your crazy lover, beloved.

301
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:19,803
l am a crazy lover.

302
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,101
l am a crazy lover.

303
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,374
l am your crazy lover, beloved.

304
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,650
l am a crazy lover.

305
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,083
l am your crazy lover, beloved.

306
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:42,710
An ocean dwells in a drop.

307
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:47,882
lt can drown the place.

308
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:52,824
A desert dwells in a grain.

309
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,065
That makes you go crazy.

310
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:03,969
Your eyes' single spark is enough.

311
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:12,013
Your eyes' single spark is enough.

312
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,012
lf you lay your sight on someone.

313
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,318
You make him go crazy.

314
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:25,861
Crazy lover.

315
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,867
Where did everyone go?

316
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,671
l think l am not destined to meet her.

317
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,137
lt's said..

318
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:43,106
ln love a moment's
wait seems like centuries.

319
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:47,016
But without waiting, love
doesn't hold that charisma.

320
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,780
Wow! Wow! Wow!
- Thanks. Thanks.

321
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,218
Wow! Wow! Wow!

322
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,916
What happened? What happened?
- Wow! Wow!

323
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,358
Excuse me, sir. Everyone
has left. You also leave.

324
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,622
Can you tell me that tall
girl who had worn a red dress..

325
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,462
..and this mask, who is she?

326
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,694
l don't know her name.

327
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,431
But she comes to central
library every evening at 5.

328
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,469
Central library.
- Yes.

329
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,668
Thank you very much.
- Yes.

330
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:14,278
He is taking so long.

331
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,337
Since morning he is changing
one dress after the other.

332
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,679
l think today Salim is
going to meet Anarkali.

333
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,514
Hello.
- Hi.

334
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,913

ls this fine?
- Yes. - Yes. Come.

336
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,048
Basant.

337
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:29,227
l am very nervous. l will
win this competition, won't l?

338
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,690
For sure.

339
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:33,058
With the aid of hope, a small
boat also crosses the ocean.

340
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,565
So what is this competition?

341
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:39,093
l am tense. Will she come in my life?

342
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,306
She will come. She will surely come.

343
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:45,536
But come for the competition on time.

344
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:49,411
Because you are my
courage and strength.

345
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,040
l will be there. Come on. Let's go.

346
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:13,328
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

347
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,059
Take care.

348
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,257
What happened?

349
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,593
What have you done?

350
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,160
Oh no!
- Carry her.

351
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:47,262
Carry her. Take her to the hospital.

352
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:48,498
Carry her.

353
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,481
Our belongings.

354
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,388
Driver! Hey!

355
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,320
Where is he taking the car?
- Damn!

356
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,919
All our instruments are in the car.

357
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,488
Okay. Do one thing. Both
of you reach the auditorium.

358
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,227
Satya and l will get the instruments.
- Yes. Come on.

359
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:19,096
That's it. Stop her.

360
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:25,406
Driver, you are here.
Our luggage is in your car.

361
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:26,671
We have to go for the competition.
Come on.

362
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:29,179
Sir, that girl is badly hurt.
She is unconscious.

363
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:31,739
Doctor, take all my blood.

364
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,784
Take each drop.

365
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,683
But save my daughter.

366
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:38,220
Look, l understand your feelings.

367
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,917
But you also
understand my helplessness.

368
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,959
We can't take your blood.
- Why?

369
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,025
Because your daughter and you..

370
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,927
..don't share the same blood group.

371
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,129
Your daughter blood's
group is A1B positive.

372
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,327
lt's very rare.

373
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:53,199
So..
- No. Don't worry.

374
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,865
We have sent the
requisition in other blood banks.

375
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,772
We will have to wait
till we get the blood.

376
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:02,245
God forbid. What if
it's too late by then?

377
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,872
What will happen, doctor?
- Doctor.

378
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,080
My blood group is A1B positive.

379
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:07,277
To save his daughter's life..

380
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:08,876
..you can take as much
blood as you want from me.

381
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:13,821
l will remain indebted to you
all my life. - No, uncle. Please.

382
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,019
Don't embarrass me. Please.

383
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:17,889
Come. Come with me. Quick.

384
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,482
Why? What's the matter?

385
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,246
Seems like you are
waiting for someone special.

386
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:18,482
Once upon a time l also
used to wait for someone.

387
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:24,293
The library is closed. Come,
my friend. Let's go. Come.

388
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,645
What is this? With great
difficulty we got a chance..

389
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,112
..to participate in
the music competition.

390
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:44,773
Why did you go to the hospital?

391
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:47,850
He is very generous. He
has donated his blood.

392
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,047
You didn't think that you
have hurt your friends so much..

393
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,747
..by donating blood.

394
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,584
But..
- Just shut up.

395
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,650
Do you know? Basant
had spent so much money..

396
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,888
..and sent us for the music
competition with great difficulty.

397
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,122
And you..

398
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,230
Sorry.

399
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,668
l don't know whether what
l did is right or wrong.

400
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,439
Vasant...you did the right thing.

401
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:20,850
Look, there will be many more
music competitions and opportunities.

402
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,712
But if a person dies,
he never comes back.

403
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:28,283
l think you have done a great job.

404
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,654
Just relax. Chill, man.

405
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:32,889
Thanks.

406
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,570
Basant.
- Yes.

407
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,876
Did you find that girl?
- No.

408
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,282
l liked a girl for the first time.

409
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,445
l don't know where she
disappeared in the crowd.

410
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,184
l think l am not destined for love.

411
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:04,484
Don't feel dejected. l am sure
you will find that girl someday.

412
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,265
Sir, your Mumbai tickets.

413
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,696
Thanks. l will see.

414
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,279
One.

415
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:30,479
Shall we teach him a lesson?
- lt will be fun.

416
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,649
Two.

417
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,789
See his plight.
- Give me. Give me.

418
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,036
Three.

419
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,576
From where is this
tearing sound coming?

420
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,672
l have seen pants,
pajama getting torn.

421
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,216
From where is the loincloth tearing?

422
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:00,545
From where is the loincloth tearing?

423
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:03,450
l will spin it. l can't see it
anywhere. From where is it tearing?

424
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:05,853
Why are you dancing in
the name of exercise?

425
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,893
l am checking from where
this tearing sound is coming?

426
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:10,726
By caste you are a tailor.

427
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,764
At times you will hear tearing sound.
At times stitching sound.

428
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,629
At times you will hear
machine's sound in your dream.

429
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:18,100
What nonsense! Talking rubbish!

430
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:21,464
Why are husband and
wife brawling, Mr. Singh?

431
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,768
You are calling husband
and wife's love as brawling?

432
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,242
No. He was doing push-ups.
- Yes.

433
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,575
He is an expert in that.

434
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:29,978
Who is he?
- Do it.

435
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,515
This blind man will do push-ups?

436
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,915
He can't see properly.
He will do push-ups.

437
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,417
Come on! Go to your room! Leave!
- No. Wait.

438
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:39,953
You don't do it. And you
don't let others do it.

439
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:43,119
Wait. You do push-ups. You hold this.

440
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,559
Do it.
- Thank you.

441
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,154
Where do l have to go?
- Where are you going?

442
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,927
Come to the ground.
Do you sniff and walk?

443
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:51,763
When you see a woman,
your eyesight gets restored.

444
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:56,206
Wow! Amazing! Amazing!

445
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,504
What?
- Learn something from him.

446
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:00,408
What's there to learn?

447
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,071
Can't l do what he is doing?

448
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,479
You can't do it. You
only do this the whole day.

449
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,812
So what should l do?

450
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:09,547
Hey! How did you brainwash her?

451
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:10,982
What does he have?

452
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,752
Look, see his arms. See his biceps.

453
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:15,383
He will burst. Look, he is so fat.

454
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,359
Oh, God.
- Oh, God. What?

455
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,454
Wow! Amazing!

456
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:25,534
lf you maintain yourself,
someday you will be Mr. lndia.

457
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:28,663
On this note drink a glass of milk.

458
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:29,831
Where is it?
- Here.

459
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,739
What are you doing? Giving milk
to a snake? - Poor guy is tired.

460
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,369
Shameless blind man.

461
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,704
Had l known you will drink milk, l
would have laced it with poison.

462
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:37,907
What are you saying?
- Black man.

463
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,143
You will burst.

464
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:46,687
Doctor, you saved my life. Thank you.

465
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,459
l don't deserve thanks.

466
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:53,724
lf that boy had not come on
time and donated his blood..

467
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,132
..maybe you wouldn't
have been talking to me.

468
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,202
l don't know who that messiah was.

469
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:05,034
He saved my life and left.
- Yes, dear.

470
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:10,377
He was really a messiah. He
was a very good human being.

471
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,314
Had he not donated blood, l
don't know what would have happened.

472
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,678
Daddy, you thanked him, didn't you?

473
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,619
No, dear. l wasn't in my senses.
- Oh, no.

474
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:23,621
l was so worried that l
didn't know what l was doing..

475
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:24,821
..and where l was.

476
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:26,586
God has been very kind to us.

477
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,792
Yes, l have his card.

478
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,802
His name and telephone
number is written on it.

479
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,438
Dad.
- Yes.

480
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,040
Dad, are you sleeping?

481
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:41,612
No. l am awake. What is this?

482
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,013
Her eyes were like this, right, dad?

483
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:47,146
Eyes. You saw her
and you are asking me.

484
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,745
Why are you taking so long to draw?

485
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,387
When l was of your age,
l would see a girl..

486
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:54,357
..and make her portrait immediately.
Do you know?

487
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,393
Here, the drawing is ready.
How is she?

488
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,624
Amazing. That's all
l can say about her.

489
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,960
What do l say?

490
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:06,333
Only she will be my daughter-in-law.

491
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:07,869
Only she.

492
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,565
What do you have to
say about my selection?

493
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,404
Your selection is amazing.

494
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:14,877
Your selection is better than mine.

495
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,845
She is nothing compared to your wife.

496
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:20,576
ls that so? Who is she,
compared to whom l am nothing?

497
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:26,020
Tell me something. Are
your ears glued to the wall?

498
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,025
As soon as l take
your name, you arrive.

499
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:33,593
l see. So l am
nothing compared to her?

500
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,997
No. Show her. Tell her.
- What do l say?

501
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:38,035
Mother, how did you
tolerate daddy for so many years?

502
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:41,869
Look. - My simple mother
and my playboy father.

503
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,201
You..
- You won't change.

504
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,106
You were like that in
school as well as in college.

505
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:48,008
Will you spoil my son as well?

506
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:49,239
l am spoiling him?

507
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,846
Shall l tell you something?

508
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,778
lf your son is capable, he is like me.

509
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:56,285
lf your son is useless,
he is like you.

510
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:59,221
Great! You eat my food.

511
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:01,656
And you have become a great poet.

512
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,785
Come, l will serve you such breakfast.

513
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:07,491
That you won't be able to
speak or recite poems. Thanks.

514
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:09,396
What will you feed me?
- Just see.

515
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:10,928
Listen.
- Hi, dad.

516
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:13,533
Hi?

517
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:17,533
Are you my son? Or did you
get exchanged in the hospital?

518
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,736
Why, dad?
- Okay. From hi to why.

519
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:21,278
You are using my poem on me.

520
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:23,573
Son, today l will make
your plight such.. - Come.

521
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:25,138
Breakfast is ready.
- Coming.

522
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,376
The entire family is my enemy.

523
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,548
Eat breakfast. You
will get some energy.

524
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,284
What kind of man is he?

525
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,794
Beautiful face.

526
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:20,564
What charm!

527
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:24,866

No. No. l have to thank him.

580
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:50,672
lf he calls and l say thank you.
That wouldn't be nice.

581
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:53,433
So for good manners call

582

Stop it.

587
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,656
Vasant, there's good news for you.

588
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,935
The girl you had donated blood
to and saved her life in Jodhpur.

589
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,232
She called up asking for you.

590
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:22,799

591
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:23,999
And that l will ask you to call back.

592
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:27,407
So she said l'll
talk to him personally.

593
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:29,876
What does this mean?

594
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:33,747
lt is clear. She must have
imagined he is a pauper.

595
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:34,909
How can he call?

596
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:38,080
Shut up, you butterball. She
must have called to thank me.

597
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:40,384
No, mister. lt felt like
much more than thanks.

598
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,149
She sounded as if she was in love.

599
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,693
She is going to call me
tomorrow at 4 in the evening.

600
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:44,887
Come to my house.

601
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:48,762
Seems like you gave her blood.
And she has lost her heart to you.

602
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,907
lt will ring. lt will ring.

603
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:06,608

There are lots of mental people here.
But this isn't a hospital.

606
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:16,218
Sorry. Wrong number.

607
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:17,919
He is saying something
in praise of himself.

608
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,356
lt's 4. She still hasn't called up.

609
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,696

That girl is going to call.

619
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:46,285
The call was from Star Ad agency.

620
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:48,917
Today if l get a
chance l will be on my way.

621

This will also set you on your way.

622
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,592
Look, these are competitive times.

Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.
- Yes.

At least say bye to me.

627
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:05,970
Selfish rascals.

628
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,108
Hello.
- This is Priya.

629
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:15,652
Hi Priya. Oh my God! He
missed you by one minute.

630
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,382
He just left. Let me see. l will
call him if he is at the gate.

631
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,218
Hold on. Okay. Please.

632
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:22,483
A girl is after him.
And he doesn't care.

633
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:26,726
Vasant. Vasant.

634
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:37,508
Loser. Hello. Yes Priya. He just left.

635
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,706
You were supposed to call
at 4 in the evening, right?

636
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:41,506
He waited for quite a while.

637
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:44,840
Oh no. l have been
trying since so long.

638
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,075
l couldn't get through.

639
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,946
These days all you
get are wrong numbers.

640
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:51,153
But you have called
at the right place.

641
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,888
Do this. Call at 9 in the morning.

642
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:57,355
Look, l am coming to Mumbai
by Jodhpur express tomorrow.

643
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:01,027
Can you ask Vasant to come
and meet me at the station?

644
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:02,493
l will really like it.

645
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,859
Oh definitely. l will
bring him personally.

646
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,528
But he said he didn't see you.

647
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:07,798
How are we to recognise you?

648
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:12,207
Your attention please.

649
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:16,235

lt is already 20 minutes late.
Now half an hour more.

Thank God it is coming.

654
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:27,757
Well, in love wait for a
minute seems like eternity.

655
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,492
And love is no fun without wait.

656
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,829
Don't worry. She'll come. For sure.

657
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,728
And will pass by.
- Meaning?

658
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,230
Neither have you seen her nor me.

659
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:39,462
So how are we going to recognise her?

660
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:42,597
Look, l am not as big
an idiot you think l am.

661
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:44,234
Don't hurt my ego.

662
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,501
She told me that she'll
be wearing blue jeans..

663
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:50,172
..blue top and blue cap. And
she'll be holding an English novel.

664
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:53,649
And l told her that you will
be standing at Sagar Book stall.

665
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:54,912
Do you any other identity?

666
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:57,481
How do l look?
- Handsome.

00:42:58,322 --> 00:42:59,482

What happened? - Vasant, your
guru is not well. Don't worry.

675
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:20,410
lt's not very serious.
But he is hospitalised.

676
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:24,314
Go. Go. - Do this. Receive her.

Coolie.
- Madam, may l carry your luggage?

680

Madam, shall l?

681
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:55,272
A beautiful girl. And an admirer.

682
00:43:55,346 --> 00:44:00,613
A beautiful girl. And an admirer.

683
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:20,063
People in love don't stop...

684
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:25,603
..No matter how many turns.

685
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:39,412
What's good or bad. l
have left it to God.

686
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,315
Hi. l am Priya from Jodhpur.

687
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:46,089
l am the admirer. l am your
admirer. - Hi. l am Vasant.

688
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:54,833
May l ask something? l
troubled you a lot, isn't it?

689
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:57,938
You didn't give me trouble. You
have done away with my trouble.

690
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:00,410
How come?
- By coming to Mumbai.

691
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:02,571
l am the admirer. l am your admirer.

692
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:05,114
Couldn't help it. l couldn't
talk to you despite calling twice.

693
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,342
So that's good.

694
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,244
We wouldn't have met
today if we had talked.

695
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:11,814
Perhaps l wouldn't
have been here today..

696
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:13,787
..if you hadn't donated blood to me.

697
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:18,017
l am the admirer. l am your admirer.

698
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:20,928
Look, blood donation is
nothing extraordinary.

699
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,465
Don't build it up so much.

700
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:27,997

But your friend said

This was out of order then.

00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,809
But now slowly
everything is getting in order.

717

Order me on the phone
when you need anything.

718
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,309

00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:25,146
l waited for her for 2 hours.
l searched the whole train.

735
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,290
That day too she called up late.

Tell me. ln which hospital is guru?

737
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,151
Bandra municipal hospital.

738
00:47:32,763 --> 00:47:36,130
Why did you admit him to a
municipal hospital when l am there?

739
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,768
Come. Let's shift him to
some good hospital. - Okay.

740
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:39,961
This is not done.

Today l am very happy.

742
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:47,007
Ever since you have come

You are such a sweet...

Yes, uncle. You were saying something.

00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:58,979

00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,986
Uncle, he has called up ten
times in the last minutes.

Do you need anything?
Can l be of any help?

750
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,324
How many times do l talk to him?

751
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:10,059
This means he is
harassing you. Give me the phone.

752
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:14,164
l will slap him here and he
will feel it there on the phone.

He is a good man.

00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:25,348
This means you liked
him in a single meeting.

757
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,441
No. lt isn't that.

758
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:33,078
You like me. And as
they say life partner.

759
00:48:33,357 --> 00:48:34,619
What do they say in
Hindi that lifetime?

760
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:35,885
Uncle, you've gone a bit too far.

761
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:40,423
Hear him out.

762
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,295
Or you'll have to give
blood to him this time around.

763
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,697

Dad's girlfriend?

00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:48,283
Sorry, sir. Good morning, sir.

815
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,919

817
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:56,593
Sir, l have making the rounds
of your office since many weeks.

818
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,567
You heard my jingle last week, sir.

819
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:01,229
Oh. How is sister-in-law?

820
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:04,932
Sorry. Sorry. You are that
music director, aren't you?

821
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,839
Yes.

Sir, here's my cassette.

824
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:16,276
Seems like you gave

00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,681
ls Rajni Priya the
name of your girlfriend?

826
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:23,090
No, sir. Actually
Shivranjini is the name of a note.

827
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,594
An astrologer told me to
associate myself to this note.

00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:26,754
And l will be a hit.

829

Oh.

Because a talented man can
recognise another talented man.

00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:41,068
But my kids say that l
have no talent at all.

833
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:43,412
You are right. They are wrong.

834
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,072
A talented man can
recognise another talented

835
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:47,876
No. only a young talent can
recognise another young talent.

836

00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:03,643
My house is close by.

878
00:55:04,548 --> 00:55:08,109
lf you don't mind

879
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,516
Some other time.

880
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,386
Actually l have to go somewhere.
l am really late.

881
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:14,884
lt's just the matter
of 5 minutes. Please.

Please. Don't go by the
condition of the room.

885
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,935
Actually it's a bachelor's room.

886
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:29,563
With cold, cold water...

887
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,107
Don't be scared. He is
a butterball by birth.

888
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:33,608
We call him rhino with love.

889
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:34,837
He bathes once a year.

890
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,641
And this is Michael
Jackson from America.

891
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:40,214
He is an MTVfanatic.
Keeps moving all the time.

892
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:43,343
And this is Mr. Satya.
He is a liar to the core.

893
00:55:44,788 --> 00:55:48,349
This is Ms. Priya.
- Oh. - Hello.

894
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:51,120
You are Ranjini Priya.
And she is Priya. - Yes.

895
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:53,185
She has got me a
chance in music direction.

896
00:55:53,497 --> 00:55:55,829
Okay. Bless me.

897
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:57,927
What will you have?

898
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:59,468
Horlicks. Bournvita. Apple juice.

899
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:02,069
l will not ask that.
Because all of us are paupers.

900
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,008
All there is tap water. Superb.

901
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:09,303
No. No. Thank you very much.

902
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:15,983
Him there? He is here and not there.

903
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:19,684
ln our hearts. He is
our dearest friend.

904
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:21,514
Not a friend. He is everything to us.

905
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,657
He provides us with food, clothing.

906
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:26,294
Everything in this
house is given by him.

907
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,856
He is not a friend. But an angel.

908
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:34,997
l know this angel like
friend of yours very well.

909
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:36,637
Hello. Who is this?

910
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:39,141
This is Prakash. Come here quickly.

911
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,673
Quickly? What's so urgent?

912
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:44,344
You'll know once you come here.

913
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:45,710
Okay. l am coming.

914
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:14,373
What you did in friendship?
Do you think that's right?

915
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,200
l am sorry.

916
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:20,441
But give me a chance to clarify.
- What chance should we give you?

917
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:22,538
You grabbed the
opportunity with both hands.

918
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:26,280
You hid from me. From me?

919
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:30,420
But Priya has told us everything.

920
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:36,461
We have come to know that
you and Priya love each other.

921
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:44,762
Actually you can never
hide love and problems.

922
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:47,801
You hid such a
beautiful girlfriend from us.

923
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:50,102
Did you think that we will
snatch Priya away from you?

924
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:54,970
No. l was going to tell
you at the first opportunity.

925
00:57:56,583 --> 00:58:00,041
This line matches that of Aishwarya.

926
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:05,113
And this line matches
that of Karishma Kapoor.

927
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:09,821
And this small line is
exactly like that of Rekha.

928
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:12,329
You will rock the movie industry.

929
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:14,696
Oh my. You mean l'll become a heroine?

930
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:19,136
l am not saying that. Your lines are.

931
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:21,799
Are you telling the truth?
- He is lying.

932
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:25,367
Who spoke?
- Your daddy.

933
00:58:25,445 --> 00:58:29,279
Who is this saying untoward
things on this auspicious moment?

934
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:32,182
This is my...
- l am her husband.

935
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:36,386
Are you done? - No. l was
just telling her the future?

936
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:38,354
Where you telling the
future or caressing her hand?

937
00:58:38,424 --> 00:58:40,585
No. l wasn't caressing her hand.

938
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,788

and l have such knowledge..

940
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,834

943
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:55,438
lt's 11.30, right?

944
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:59,911
You will die a dog's death at
my hands a second past 11.30.

945
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:01,844
What are you saying?
- The second is up.

946
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:04,778
Darn you.

Heroines are made and
destroyed every day here.

964
00:59:45,058 --> 00:59:47,583
And such ruffians go
around fooling women.

965
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,957
Don't fall for them.
Look, l am telling you.

Albeit old one. Just as
Ashok Kumar and Madhubala.

969
00:59:58,338 --> 00:59:59,532
They worked together, didn't they?

taken if the door was open.

01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:38,176
One who keeps my spirits up.

01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:40,769
l want such a husband.

1043
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:54,625
A block rope. A black rope is
stopping the latch from opening.

1044
01:05:54,727 --> 01:06:00,131
A block rope. A black rope is
stopping the latch from opening.

1045
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:05,637
No boy. l don't like any boy.

1046
01:06:05,738 --> 01:06:08,206
No boy.

1047
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:35,258
Silly girl. Silly girl,

1048
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:40,704
You'll get a groom. You'll
get a groom as you want.

1049
01:06:40,806 --> 01:06:43,240
You'll get a groom.

1050
01:06:45,177 --> 01:06:50,615
l am a saint. l am a saint.
l have renounced the world.

l am a saint. l am a saint.
l have renounced the world.

1052
01:06:56,055 --> 01:07:01,618
Or l would have...Or l would

1053
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:04,093
Or l would have.

1054
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:08,063
You old man. Have some shame.

1055
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:11,467
l am old. But l am young at heart.

1056
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:16,872
l am affair proof. l am
affair proof. l am still unmarried.

1057
01:07:16,976 --> 01:07:19,467
l am affair proof.

1058
01:07:30,456 --> 01:07:34,756
l am a poet too. l
can do disco as well.

1059
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:40,127
l will shower you with love.
Make me your husband.

1060
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:45,701
The world will sing
this song when they see us.

1061
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:50,572
The world will sing
this song when they see us.

1062
01:07:50,643 --> 01:07:52,736
What? What? What?

1063
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:58,515
A beautiful girl.
- And an admirer.

1064
01:07:58,584 --> 01:08:02,884
A beautiful girl.
- And an admirer.

1065
01:08:02,955 --> 01:08:07,289
A beautiful girl.
- And an admirer.

1066
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:12,592
A beautiful girl.
- And an admirer.

1067
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:28,012
Brother, you have
worked so hard in life.

1068
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,405
What will you do
living alone in Jodhpur?

1069
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:33,543
And Priya has also learnt
the work. She is helping me.

1070
01:08:34,019 --> 01:08:37,250
l suggest leave Jodhpur
and live here with us.

1071
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:39,314
And what is that
responsibility in life..

1072
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:41,154
..for which you are working this hard?

1073
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:42,792
There is a responsibility.

1074
01:08:42,862 --> 01:08:45,763
The biggest
responsibility is still unfulfilled.

1075
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:47,324
Thank you.

1076
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,865
And that is my
daughter Priya's marriage.

1077
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,168
l want to find a nice boy for Priya.

1078
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:57,135
To see her happy in her married life.

1079
01:08:57,877 --> 01:09:02,314
And then my brother-in-law,
l'll do where and what you want.

1080
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:05,714
That's my promise. - Brother,
don't worry about that at all.

1081
01:09:05,985 --> 01:09:09,148
Priya has found a boy.
She has fallen in love.

1082
01:09:09,221 --> 01:09:10,552
What nonsense are you talking

1083
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:13,386
You have this habit ofjoking.
This is impossible.

1084
01:09:13,592 --> 01:09:16,026
Brother, it doesn't take time
for impossible to become possible..

1085
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:17,756
..in this day and age.

1086
01:09:18,164 --> 01:09:19,995
And then l got the inside information.

1087
01:09:20,065 --> 01:09:24,468
The boy is 100% perfect.
And they love each other.

1088
01:09:24,537 --> 01:09:27,267
Love and stuff. This
is absolutely nonsense.

1089
01:09:27,339 --> 01:09:31,275
l sent Priya here to help you so
that she can also learn something.

1090
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:35,675
l very well know how these
promises made in youth break and when.

1091
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:37,612
This is all stupidity. l
don't believe in love.

1092
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,479
Where is Priya? Priya. Priya.

1093
01:09:39,652 --> 01:09:41,643
Brother, please. Why are you shouting?

1094
01:09:41,854 --> 01:09:43,048
Hear me out first.

1095
01:09:43,522 --> 01:09:44,989
You won't tell Priya anything.

1096
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,887
Do you know who does Priya love?

1097
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:48,956
Whom she wants to
make her life partner?

1098
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:51,056
This is the same boy who
gave Priya a new life..

1099
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:52,562
..by giving her blood.

1100
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:56,091
And brother, you would
also always praise that boy.

1101
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:01,397
He is left alone in this world.
- Who cares?

1102
01:10:01,507 --> 01:10:03,099
Come up with a second line.

1103
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:06,503
He is left alone in this world.

1104
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:10,973
So he must either be a loser or
his own must be bitter people.

1105
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,617
And if he is dying he'll be Pele.

1106
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:15,186
How was that?

1107
01:10:15,354 --> 01:10:16,616
Why are you destroying the couplet?

1108
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:18,919
Dad, if l have my way...
- You will destroy me.

1109
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:21,050
No. What are you saying?
You are my darling dad.

1110
01:10:21,293 --> 01:10:25,627
Look, stop all this. l am fed up
of this darling and daddy and all.

1111
01:10:25,898 --> 01:10:31,928
Make me a grandfather.
- Okay. Tell me. How?

1112
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:37,333
That's up to you.
- You want to be a grandfather? - Yes.

1113
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:39,434
Here you are. Hello.

1114
01:10:40,045 --> 01:10:41,842
Hi.
- Hi Priya.

1115
01:10:41,914 --> 01:10:44,781
Vasant, listen. Papa is
here and he wants to meet you.

1116
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,681
Come here right now.

1117
01:10:48,754 --> 01:10:52,190
Hello.
- Priya, l can't come now.

1118
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:55,551
Well, actually my dad is not well.
- What happened?

1119
01:10:56,028 --> 01:10:59,361
He sweats. His heart palpitates.
And what not.

1120
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:01,294
l will take him to dispensary.

1121
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:05,761
Oh. But father is going
back by this evening's flight.

1122
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:08,897
So Priya, l'll do this. l'll
directly come to the airport and meet.

1123
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:11,599
Sure? Look Vasant, do come.

1124
01:11:11,844 --> 01:11:14,210
Father is very sensitive.
He'll take offence.

1125
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,344
No. l will come for sure.
- Okay. - Bye.

1126
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,788
Your attention please.

1127
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:27,424
What's the matter, dear? Mr.
Vasant Kumar hasn't come yet.

1128
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:30,189
He must be on the way. Wait for a
little while. - 'Security check.'

1129
01:11:30,262 --> 01:11:33,425
l can wait for
son-in-law till eternity.

1130
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:36,627
But this flight to
Jodhpur will not wait.

1131
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:38,834
l guess he must be
stuck in a traffic snarl.

1132
01:11:38,904 --> 01:11:40,963
He must be coming.
Just two minutes. Please.

1133
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,538
'May l have your attention please.'

1134
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:48,204
'lndian Airlines' flight lC618
is ready to fly to Jodhpur.'

1135
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:52,450
'Passengers are requested to

1136
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:57,378
Dear, l'll have to go now.

1137
01:11:57,456 --> 01:11:59,651
Wait. Wait, dad. l'll
call him. Wait. Wait.

1138

What happened?
- l am sorry, papa.

1139
01:12:29,855 --> 01:12:31,652
Seems like the network is busy.
- 'Your attentions please.'

This is the final call
for passengers.' - See.

'Travelling by flight lC6.'

1142

You had told me the
place and time, right.

1143
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,761
l have given him all this information.

1144
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:42,392
Dear, l had imagined l'll
be able to meet my future..

1145
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,833
..son-in-law before l leave.
But it's okay.

1146

Oh. l am so...l am so sorry, Priya.

Do you know there was such traffic?

1152
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:14,556
l jumped all the
signals to meet uncle.

1153
01:13:14,633 --> 01:13:15,827
You don't need to say anything.

1154
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:17,698
Do you know how long
dad waited for you?

1155
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,260
l have been insulted
so much because of you.

1156
01:13:19,338 --> 01:13:21,397
Oh, l am so sorry. No problem.

1157

1162
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,554
Stupid.

Sorry. - You beat me so
badly and then you say sorry.

01:14:23,302 --> 01:14:24,394
Darn you.

1170
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:28,670
What happened to you? Why
were you beating him so badly?

1171
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:32,008
l felt he pushed you intentionally.

1172
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:41,419
'No chance. He was lucky to cut
off the boundary' - What a shot!

1173
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,683
'Straight. Brilliant shot.'

1174
01:14:45,891 --> 01:14:47,085
Yes.

1175
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:49,150
'Everyone's on the boundary.'

1176
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:51,695
One four. One four.
- One minute. One minute.

1177
01:14:51,797 --> 01:14:53,389
What's happening? ls cricket going on?

1178
01:14:53,932 --> 01:14:57,265
Who is playing?
Where is the ball going?

1179
01:14:57,503 --> 01:14:59,061
What is he hitting? Where is it going?

1180
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:01,002
Six. Six. Six.

1181
01:15:05,677 --> 01:15:07,372
Four.

1182
01:15:07,646 --> 01:15:09,170
'That's a fantastic shot.'

1183
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:10,712
One more six.

1184
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:12,977
'Stand down the ground.'

1185
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:14,345
Come on, Yuvi. Come on.

1186
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,210
One...six. Six. Okay.

1187
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:17,481
lt's a six. lt's a six.

1188
01:15:17,656 --> 01:15:18,748
'Six.'

1189
01:15:22,794 --> 01:15:24,022
Bowled.

1190
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:27,791
Yes. Six. Seven.

1191
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:30,735
l have got both of
them out with one ball.

1192
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:34,464
How can you take two wickets
in one ball? - Shall l show?

1193
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,734
l haven't seen cricket.
lt might be happening.

1194
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:38,675
Let me show you.

1195
01:15:41,013 --> 01:15:42,947
Now a blind man is watching.

1196
01:15:43,048 --> 01:15:45,039
And a handicap is walking.

1197
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,516
So can't l take two
wickets in one ball?

1198
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,582
With one ball.

1199
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:53,725
This is my ball. And l
am taking two wickets.

1200
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,019
These wickets.

1201
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:01,698
Okay. We are out.

1202
01:16:06,538 --> 01:16:09,336
Wow. Beautiful. Fantastic.

1203
01:16:11,176 --> 01:16:13,235
That's enough. Vasant, do you
know why l have called you here?

1204
01:16:13,312 --> 01:16:14,973
Little to the right. Smile.

1205
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:17,041
Beautiful.

1206
01:16:17,349 --> 01:16:18,782
Enough. Listen to me.

1207
01:16:18,884 --> 01:16:20,579
Daddy called from Jodhpur yesterday.

1208
01:16:20,652 --> 01:16:23,052
He's retiring.
- So, what's the problem?

1209
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:26,318
Daddy wants to throw a
party before his retirement.

1210
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:29,724
So, go attend the party and
come back. What's the problem?

1211
01:16:29,828 --> 01:16:31,159
The problem is my darling, that..

1212
01:16:31,263 --> 01:16:33,493
..daddy wants to
introduce his future son-in-law..

1213
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:36,762
..which means you, to his friends.

1214
01:16:36,835 --> 01:16:39,770
And that means you will have
to come to Jodhpur with me.

1215
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:47,501
What are you thinking?
- No, no, but how is that possible.

1216
01:16:47,946 --> 01:16:49,880
You know that l handle
daddy's entire business.

1217
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:51,943
And tomorrow's the
all-lndia Dealer's conference.

1218
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,683
ln this situation, if l go
to Jodhpur to meet uncle..

1219
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,146
..then everything will be ruined.

1220
01:16:56,355 --> 01:16:57,788
l don't care.

1221
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,389
We'll see what happens.

1222
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:01,050
Daddy has sent tickets for Jodhpur.

1223
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:02,918
We're going to Jodhpur tomorrow.

1224
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:04,257
That is my order.

1225
01:17:14,806 --> 01:17:16,433
Driver, get the luggage.

1226
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:24,208
Papa.

1227
01:17:24,783 --> 01:17:26,546
Papa. Pa..

1228
01:17:28,553 --> 01:17:30,578
Welcome. Welcome, my dear.

1229
01:17:31,823 --> 01:17:34,018
l'm sorry l couldn't
come to the airport.

1230
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:36,356
Mr. Khanna's daughter
was getting engaged..

1231
01:17:36,428 --> 01:17:37,827
..so l had to attend it.

1232
01:17:38,163 --> 01:17:40,723
Everyone was asking one question.

1233
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:41,925
Everyone was asking..

1234
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,161
..when are you getting Priya married.

1235
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,098
Where is son-in-law?

1236
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:47,396
Where is he?

1237
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:48,996
Actually, papa, he had
to go meet someone..

1238
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:50,268
..regarding his business.

1239
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,036
He must be on his way.
- What's going on?

1240
01:17:52,778 --> 01:17:54,905
When l was in Mumbai,
l couldn't meet him.

1241
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,448
Now that he's here, l
can't meet him either.

1242
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:01,678
Fine, l think he loves his business..

1243
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:03,983
..more than his father-in-law.

1244
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:05,148
No, papa.

1245
01:18:05,257 --> 01:18:08,852
Every time we talk he
keeps asking about you.

1246
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:10,890
How's papa?

1247
01:18:11,096 --> 01:18:12,723
How short-tempered is he?

1248
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:15,496
Does he pardon mistakes, or not?

1249
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:20,534
l can forgive everyone, but not him.
- Why?

1250
01:18:21,073 --> 01:18:25,305
Because, he tried to
snatch my dear daughter from me.

1251
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:27,875
Papa, we're here to
take your permission.

1252
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,740
Your order brought him
from Mumbai to Jodhpur.

1253
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:33,075
He'll prove to be a good son-in-law.

1254
01:18:34,553 --> 01:18:36,384
You're...you're serious.

1255
01:18:36,455 --> 01:18:38,514
l was just joking.
- Papa.

1256
01:18:38,623 --> 01:18:41,057
Let's have a hot cup of tea.

1257
01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:43,993

1258

Hello.

1260
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,478
Priya, there's no petrol in the car.

1261
01:19:10,555 --> 01:19:11,681
l'll go get it filled.

1262
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:12,849
Papa, l'm going out for shopping.

1263
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:15,791

01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:42,886
Why are you playing
hide and seek with me?

1270
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:45,421
l couldn't meet you
when l was in Mumbai.

1271
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:48,388
And now that you're in Jodhpur,
we can't meet either.

1272

Will he like it?

How do you know this is my
papa's favourite colour?

1305
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:33,459

1316
01:22:40,932 --> 01:22:44,060
He didn't leap to his death,

1317
01:22:45,337 --> 01:22:46,463

01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,167

Priya, l...want to ask you something.

1354
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:27,688

..l saved your life giving my blood.

Look, Vasant.

1359
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,241
Sometimes you need just
one reason to love someone.

1360
01:26:46,644 --> 01:26:48,976
And sometimes, 100
reasons are not enough.

1361
01:26:49,847 --> 01:26:53,374
Why do l love you so much, l
don't have an answer to that.

1362
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:56,983
All l know is that l
cannot live without you.

1363
01:27:04,429 --> 01:27:07,193
l think someone's here.
- l'll take a look.

1364
01:27:09,601 --> 01:27:10,863
Yes.

01:27:11,236 --> 01:27:12,828
Hi, Basant.

01:27:13,638 --> 01:27:14,798
Vasant, you?

No calls, or message direct Jodhpur.

01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:19,675
Actually, l got a chance to
give music in an ad agency.

01:27:19,744 --> 01:27:21,439
When l went home to
give you this good news..

l want to book a room in your hotel.

ln the name..

1378
01:27:42,533 --> 01:27:44,160
ln the name of Ranjini Priya.

1379
01:27:44,269 --> 01:27:46,396
Okay, sir. How soon will you be here?

1380
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:47,904
We'll be there in half an hour.

1381
01:27:51,342 --> 01:27:53,310
You should've called.

1382
01:27:53,378 --> 01:27:55,278
Actually, l start
working from tomorrow.

1383
01:27:55,346 --> 01:27:56,836
l came a day earlier.

1384
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,147
Do you know why?
- Why?

1385
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,952
l'm here to meet the girl
to whom l donated my blood.

1386
01:28:06,057 --> 01:28:07,422
Are you crazy?

1387
01:28:07,759 --> 01:28:10,193
Why are you wasting your
time in such useless things?

1388
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:12,520
Where will you look for
that girl in this big city?

1389
01:28:12,964 --> 01:28:14,363
l am not crazy.

1390
01:28:14,432 --> 01:28:16,297
l know where the hospital is.

1391
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:19,029
There l will find
her name and address..

1392
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,331
..and then go meet her at her house.

1393
01:28:20,605 --> 01:28:21,936
You're coming along with me.

1394
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,438
Me?
- Yes.

1395
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:27,936
Buddy..

1396
01:28:28,246 --> 01:28:29,804
l am not feeling well.

1397
01:28:29,881 --> 01:28:31,109
You do one thing.

1398
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:32,911
You go to the hotel.
l'll pick you up at 4 pm..

1399
01:28:32,984 --> 01:28:34,451
..and then we'll go to the
hospital together. - Okay.

1400
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:36,850
Will you come?
- Definitely.

1401
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:04,776
Sir, what are you doing?

1402
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,590
Basant.

1403
01:29:57,168 --> 01:29:58,260
You here?

1404
01:29:58,636 --> 01:30:00,228
Didn't you go to the hotel?
- l did.

1405
01:30:00,304 --> 01:30:02,636
But l got bored sitting
there alone, so l came here.

1406
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:04,501
You did the right thing.

1407
01:30:05,343 --> 01:30:06,935
l haven't gone out since morning.

1408
01:30:07,812 --> 01:30:09,279
l was getting bored too.

1409
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:11,548
Let's go get some fresh air.

1410
01:30:11,649 --> 01:30:12,980
Didn't you have a headache?

1411
01:30:13,317 --> 01:30:16,514
Yes, l did. But not now.

1412
01:30:16,988 --> 01:30:18,216
l am fine now.

1413
01:30:18,556 --> 01:30:20,285
You were saying that..

1414
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:21,585
..you wanted to go to some hospital.

1415
01:30:23,027 --> 01:30:24,688
What did you say the name was?

1416
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,061
City Hospital.

1417
01:30:27,698 --> 01:30:29,529
Yes, City Hospital.

1418
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:31,060
Let's go to the hospital..

1419
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:32,261
..and you'll get
Priya's address from there.

1420
01:30:32,336 --> 01:30:33,735
Let's go, l'll get ready.

1421
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,360
Vasant.

1422
01:31:05,203 --> 01:31:07,569
Shall we? Come.

1423
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,444
We were supposed to
go to the hospital?

1424
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:26,882
Why bring me here?

1425
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:28,284
Keep this aside.

1426
01:31:29,327 --> 01:31:30,760
l want to talk to you.

1427
01:31:40,171 --> 01:31:41,638
Do you want to talk about this?

1428
01:31:44,475 --> 01:31:49,276
l saw you take the
picture from the album.

1429
01:31:51,449 --> 01:31:53,314
And l saw you tear Priya's address..

1430
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:57,615
..from the hospital's register.

1431
01:31:59,156 --> 01:32:01,090
l saved Priya by donating my blood.

1432
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:02,587
And, you used my name..

1433
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,719
..to trapped her in your false love.

1434
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:06,319
Don't call my love fake, Vasant?

1435
01:32:07,532 --> 01:32:09,557
lt's true that you saved her life.

1436
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:10,964
You saved my love.

1437
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:12,866
But you had met
Priya long before that.

1438
01:32:13,204 --> 01:32:14,330
Remember Jodhpur.

1439
01:32:14,405 --> 01:32:16,236
l saw a girl on Valentine's Day.

1440
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,602
And l lost my heart to her.

1441
01:32:17,942 --> 01:32:20,570
And l lost my peace and slumber.

1442
01:32:20,645 --> 01:32:22,340
And l also mentioned that to you.

1443
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,771
And that girl was Priya.

1444
01:32:25,049 --> 01:32:27,847
And, when l saw her at the
railway station, l lost my senses.

1445
01:32:27,952 --> 01:32:31,115
And.. - And you thought just
like rich brats did, you cheat.

1446
01:32:31,222 --> 01:32:32,484
Don't call me a cheat.

1447
01:32:32,557 --> 01:32:34,855
You've been unmasked, that's
why you're putting up this drama.

1448
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:37,019
You're a bloody cheater, liar..
- Have you gone mad?

1449
01:32:38,429 --> 01:32:40,727
Do you want me to repay your favour?

1450
01:32:40,798 --> 01:32:42,629
What repayment?

1451
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:44,292
When did l say anything like that?

1452
01:32:44,368 --> 01:32:46,495
l'm saying let's go talk to Priya.

1453
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:48,732
l don't want to talk to her.

1454
01:32:48,839 --> 01:32:51,171
You stabbed your friend in the back.

1455
01:32:51,275 --> 01:32:52,799
Stop it, Vasant. There's a limit.

1456
01:32:53,144 --> 01:32:55,408
lf you say another word,
you'll regret it. - Shut up.

1457
01:32:56,047 --> 01:32:57,844
You're not worthy of
love or friendship.

1458
01:32:57,915 --> 01:33:00,349
Vasant. Vasant.

1459
01:33:00,418 --> 01:33:01,885
Basant
- Vasant, no.

1460
01:33:01,986 --> 01:33:03,317
Hold on to my hands.

1461
01:33:03,387 --> 01:33:04,513
Hold on to my hands, Vasant.

1462
01:33:04,589 --> 01:33:06,056
No, no. Vasant, no.

1463
01:33:07,224 --> 01:33:09,089
Come up.

1464
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,684
Come up, Vasant.

1465
01:33:11,195 --> 01:33:12,389
Come up.

1466
01:33:13,197 --> 01:33:15,461
Come up, Vasant.

1467
01:33:19,937 --> 01:33:21,666
Vasant, no. No, no.

1468
01:33:27,545 --> 01:33:29,638
Vasant, no.
- Save me.

1469
01:33:29,747 --> 01:33:32,307
No!

1470
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,635
No!

1471
01:33:57,975 --> 01:33:59,670
Vasant! What's wrong with you?

1472
01:33:59,777 --> 01:34:02,610
Vasant! Why don't you say something?
Are you alright?

1473
01:34:04,215 --> 01:34:05,739
Nothing.

1474
01:34:06,817 --> 01:34:08,375
l was just missing uncle.

1475
01:34:13,724 --> 01:34:14,986
Vasant.

1476
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:17,221
You're my only support.

1477
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:20,288
lf you don't control yourself..

1478
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:22,722
..then who will look after me?

1479
01:34:24,702 --> 01:34:27,364
Why don't we head out of
the city for a few days?

1480
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:49,650
What's this?
- Sir, Jennifer Lopez and Spice Girls.

1481
01:34:54,031 --> 01:34:55,259
And this?

1482
01:34:56,467 --> 01:34:57,695
Sir, we're bachelors..

1483
01:34:57,768 --> 01:34:59,326
..so we just have some fun.

1484
01:34:59,437 --> 01:35:01,462
So, you also smoke the pot.
- Some..

1485
01:35:01,539 --> 01:35:03,404
No, sir. Never. Never.

1486
01:35:03,507 --> 01:35:04,804
What's your name?

1487
01:35:05,142 --> 01:35:06,404
Sir, my name's Prakash..

1488
01:35:06,477 --> 01:35:07,603
..but people call me Genda adoringly.

1489
01:35:07,712 --> 01:35:08,872
Genda!

1490
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:10,071
And you?

1491
01:35:10,147 --> 01:35:12,206
Sir, my name's Satya.

1492
01:35:12,717 --> 01:35:14,878
But people call me
'Jhoota' (liar) adoringly.

1493
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:16,543
What love!

1494
01:35:24,161 --> 01:35:25,253
Who is this man?

1495
01:35:25,329 --> 01:35:28,196
He's Basant and he's Vasant..
- You shut up.

1496
01:35:28,466 --> 01:35:31,094
Sir, he's Basant and
he's Vasant Kumar.

1497
01:35:32,303 --> 01:35:35,704
Yes.

1498
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:38,674
Are you sure?
- Yes.

1499
01:35:39,143 --> 01:35:41,304
So, why did Vasant
Kumar go to Jodhpur for?

1500
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:44,376
Sir, an ad agency
invited him to compose a music.

1501
01:35:46,817 --> 01:35:50,548
So, did Vasant Kumar go to
Jodhpur only for the ad agency..

1502
01:35:50,654 --> 01:35:53,054
..or something else?
- No, sir.

1503
01:35:53,357 --> 01:35:54,517
There was another thing.

1504
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,219
Last time we went to Jodhpur
for the music competition..

1505
01:35:57,461 --> 01:36:00,123
..and a girl met with an
accident with our car.

1506
01:36:00,397 --> 01:36:02,228
And Vasant Kumar even
missed the music competition..

1507
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:04,324
..to donate blood to her.

1508
01:36:05,269 --> 01:36:06,395
This time, he was saying..

1509
01:36:06,504 --> 01:36:08,699
..he will certainly meet with
the girl when he goes to Jodhpur.

1510
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,114
Listen.

1511
01:36:57,354 --> 01:37:00,517
Look carefully and
tell us who was here.

1512
01:37:01,192 --> 01:37:05,595
Sir, this man tore the
address from the hospital register.

1513
01:37:05,696 --> 01:37:07,994
After that, this man came here..

1514
01:37:08,065 --> 01:37:09,930
..asking about that
same girl's address.

1515
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:11,327
Sir, l..

1516
01:37:11,402 --> 01:37:12,869
lt's not my mistake, sir.

1517
01:37:37,194 --> 01:37:38,957
Priya, you go on, l'll go
fill up the petrol tank.

1518
01:37:39,263 --> 01:37:40,457
Be back soon.

1519
01:37:44,869 --> 01:37:46,063
Bye.

1520
01:38:01,552 --> 01:38:04,487
Hello.
- Are you Ms. Priya? - Yes.

1521
01:38:04,555 --> 01:38:06,079
This is the CBl.

1522
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:09,782
CBl?
- The matter is very serious.

1523
01:38:10,194 --> 01:38:14,824
The person with you, isn't
Vasant Kumar, he's Basant.

1524
01:38:14,999 --> 01:38:16,227
What?
- Yes.

1525
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,693
And he has murdered your father.

1526
01:38:18,769 --> 01:38:19,736
What nonsense.

1527
01:38:19,904 --> 01:38:22,873
Not just that, he has
also murdered his friend.

1528
01:39:01,578 --> 01:39:02,704
Priya.

1529
01:39:03,514 --> 01:39:04,606
Priya.

1530
01:39:04,882 --> 01:39:06,042
Priya.

1531
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:12,114
Priya.

1532
01:40:06,877 --> 01:40:08,208
Priya!

1533
01:40:09,013 --> 01:40:10,674
Priya! Priya!

1534
01:40:11,849 --> 01:40:13,043
Priya!

1535
01:40:15,686 --> 01:40:17,176
Priya!

1536
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,386
Priya!

1537
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,328
Priya!

1538
01:40:35,406 --> 01:40:36,805
Priya!

1539
01:40:43,814 --> 01:40:45,076
Priya!

1540
01:40:48,052 --> 01:40:49,178
No!

1541
01:40:50,154 --> 01:40:51,485
Priya!
- No!

1542
01:40:51,822 --> 01:40:53,255
Don't come any closer.

1543
01:40:54,091 --> 01:40:55,524
Why are you go away from me, Priya?

1544
01:40:55,826 --> 01:40:57,453
Don't come any closer.

1545
01:40:57,628 --> 01:40:59,027
Priya.
- Don't touch me.

1546
01:40:59,329 --> 01:41:00,887
l hate you.

1547
01:41:01,265 --> 01:41:03,631
You scare me.

1548
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:06,429
You're an impostor, a cheat.

1549
01:41:06,804 --> 01:41:08,829
You killed my father.

1550
01:41:08,906 --> 01:41:10,430
You even killed my friend.

1551
01:41:11,775 --> 01:41:13,504
Why are you after me now?

1552
01:41:13,577 --> 01:41:15,772
Do you want to kill me too?
- No, Priya.

1553
01:41:15,846 --> 01:41:17,245
Don't you come near me.

1554
01:41:18,082 --> 01:41:19,310
Go away.

1555
01:41:20,551 --> 01:41:22,314
l hate you! l hate you!

1556
01:41:22,386 --> 01:41:23,853
l hate you!

1557
01:41:23,921 --> 01:41:25,081
Priya!

1558
01:41:26,023 --> 01:41:27,456
You're a murderer.

1559
01:41:27,524 --> 01:41:28,889
You're an impostor, a cheat.

1560
01:41:28,959 --> 01:41:30,290
l hate you!

1561
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,330
Why did you stop?

1562
01:41:41,638 --> 01:41:44,607
Hit me. Hit me.

1563
01:41:44,842 --> 01:41:50,803
l curse myself, that l
loved an impostor like me.

1564
01:41:51,715 --> 01:41:53,979
Why did l do it? Why did l do it?
- Priya!

1565
01:41:54,084 --> 01:41:56,450
Priya, stop it.
- Why did l do it?- Priya, stop it.

1566
01:41:56,687 --> 01:41:58,951
Priya, what have you done?

1567
01:41:59,256 --> 01:42:02,783
l can't see tears in your eyes,
and you shed your blood.

1568
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:07,627
You can't see my blood,
but you can kill my father.

1569
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:12,925
You can't see my blood,
but you can shatter my faith.

1570
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:16,200
Who else do you want to kill? Me?

1571
01:42:16,306 --> 01:42:18,774
Tell me. Kill me. Kill me.
- No, Priya. Priya.

1572
01:42:36,493 --> 01:42:37,619
Priya.

1573
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:41,564
l can be an impostor, a cheat.

1574
01:42:41,832 --> 01:42:45,199
But this earring. This cannot lie.

1575
01:42:46,036 --> 01:42:47,128
Do you recognise this?

1576
01:42:48,172 --> 01:42:50,538
Think. Think, when did you lose it?

1577
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:52,068
When had l seen you?

1578
01:42:52,676 --> 01:42:53,904
And l lost my heart at first sight.

1579
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:58,743
This earring is the
evidence of my love.

1580
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:01,347
Think. Remember?

1581
01:43:04,688 --> 01:43:08,488
l...l remember every moment.

1582
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,420
Think.

1583
01:43:11,795 --> 01:43:14,355
Jodhpur, 14th February.

1584
01:43:14,965 --> 01:43:16,193
Valentine's day.

1585
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,062
When all the lovers in the world..

1586
01:43:18,168 --> 01:43:19,760
..were celebrating lover's day.

1587
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:24,971
That day, l saw my
love hidden in your face.

1588
01:43:25,809 --> 01:43:27,003
Remember that hotel.

1589
01:43:27,644 --> 01:43:32,547
That hazy glass, when l
saw you for the first time.

1590
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:36,416
l loved you. And
thought you were mine.

1591
01:43:39,923 --> 01:43:41,288
Five seconds.

1592
01:43:41,792 --> 01:43:44,886
ln five seconds l lived
five life-spans with you.

1593
01:43:47,264 --> 01:43:48,424
Priya.

1594
01:43:49,266 --> 01:43:54,499
Since that day, you've
always been with me..

1595
01:43:55,272 --> 01:43:57,069
..and l've always been with you.

1596
01:43:57,674 --> 01:43:59,733
Since then, this earring
meant everything to me.

1597
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:01,577
And, believe or not..

1598
01:44:02,246 --> 01:44:07,548
..l kept this earring here,
close to my heart.

1599
01:44:09,886 --> 01:44:11,444
l was lost in your thoughts.

1600
01:44:12,089 --> 01:44:15,923
And you dwelled in my heart.

1601
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:21,087
After that, l longed for you.

1602
01:44:21,832 --> 01:44:23,732
l yearned for you, l was restless.

1603
01:44:25,035 --> 01:44:26,832
Forjust a glimpse.

1604
01:44:27,604 --> 01:44:28,935
And suddenly, one day..

1605
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,037
Suddenly, l saw you at
the railway station.

1606
01:44:32,442 --> 01:44:34,603
What else could l do,
Priya? What else could l do?

1607
01:44:35,045 --> 01:44:36,512
A person who never lied all his life..

1608
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:39,413
..told the biggest life of his life.

1609
01:44:39,516 --> 01:44:41,950
When Basant Kumar saw
the love of his life..

1610
01:44:42,019 --> 01:44:45,216
..l became Vasant
Kumar only to get my love.

1611
01:44:45,422 --> 01:44:48,050
And that's it.

1612
01:44:48,759 --> 01:44:51,489
That one mistake, one lie..

1613
01:44:51,595 --> 01:44:53,062
..became the foundation of my love.

1614
01:44:55,299 --> 01:44:57,631
l've committed a sin,
l'm your culprit.

1615
01:44:58,201 --> 01:45:02,297
And you, the law or God
can punish me for it..

1616
01:45:02,406 --> 01:45:03,668
..l'm ready to accept it.

1617
01:45:04,007 --> 01:45:06,737
But if someone asks me to leave you..

1618
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:10,309
..stop loving you,
then l cannot do that.

1619
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,705
And if such a situation comes up..

1620
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,742
..then l'll leave this world.

1621
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,312
The things l had imagined.

1622
01:45:19,489 --> 01:45:21,855
l will start a new life with you.

1623
01:45:22,492 --> 01:45:25,552
Where there'll be just you
and me, and no one else.

1624
01:45:25,629 --> 01:45:29,190
But...but...

1625
01:45:29,566 --> 01:45:32,330
Your daddy, interfered in my plans.

1626
01:45:32,402 --> 01:45:34,563
Rascal!
- Hit me, sir.

1627
01:45:35,038 --> 01:45:36,130
Hit me.

1628
01:45:36,306 --> 01:45:38,399
Don't just slap me.
Shoot me if you want.

1629
01:45:38,642 --> 01:45:40,701
l am ready to die for Pooja.

1630
01:45:40,944 --> 01:45:42,536
Have you gone mad?

1631
01:45:43,146 --> 01:45:46,843
Love without insanity is not love.

1632
01:45:47,951 --> 01:45:49,680
Whenever l think about Priya..

1633
01:45:49,953 --> 01:45:53,787
..how will she come in my life,
will she ever be mine?

1634
01:45:53,857 --> 01:45:56,121
These thoughts make me go crazy.

1635
01:45:56,526 --> 01:45:57,959
Sir, you can do anything.

1636
01:45:58,028 --> 01:45:59,256
You can punish me anyway you want.

1637
01:45:59,329 --> 01:46:01,695
l beg you, sir.

1638
01:46:01,765 --> 01:46:03,460
Don't snatch Priya from me.

1639
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:04,898
Let go.

1640
01:46:05,535 --> 01:46:06,832
You cheat.

1641
01:46:07,037 --> 01:46:10,871
Uncle. lf l was a cheat, a fraud..

1642
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:13,072
..then l would've
married Priya in Mumbai.

1643
01:46:13,643 --> 01:46:15,907
And would've come
here for your blessings.

1644
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,470
But l didn't do that.

1645
01:46:19,216 --> 01:46:22,151
l didn't do it...because
l wanted your approval.

1646
01:46:22,886 --> 01:46:24,285
l wanted your blessings.

1647
01:46:25,455 --> 01:46:29,858
Uncle, you're much more
experienced than l am.

1648
01:46:30,961 --> 01:46:32,656
Love is innocent.

1649
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:35,997
lt holds a storm. lt's so helpless.

1650
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:37,393
Don't you know that?

1651
01:46:38,502 --> 01:46:42,370
Don't you know what love is?
- l do.

1652
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:49,404
And l especially know what
youngsters like you call love.

1653
01:46:50,447 --> 01:46:52,677
They see one girl in the morning..

1654
01:46:52,749 --> 01:46:55,343
..say l love you to a
second girl in the afternoon..

1655
01:46:55,585 --> 01:46:59,919
..and another girl waits for you
in the hotel room in the evening.

1656
01:47:01,024 --> 01:47:03,549
And the next morning, you set out..

1657
01:47:04,161 --> 01:47:08,757
..to trap innocent girls
with your charade of love.

1658
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:11,327
lsn't this what you call love?

1659
01:47:11,501 --> 01:47:12,627
What do call it?

1660
01:47:12,702 --> 01:47:14,431
Love! Love! Love! Love!

1661
01:47:14,871 --> 01:47:17,840
You term your lust as love..

1662
01:47:17,908 --> 01:47:25,940
..and malign some poor
innocent girl and.. - Stop it, uncle.

1663
01:47:26,016 --> 01:47:29,782
Stop it, stop it. Stop.

1664
01:47:30,587 --> 01:47:32,282
Don't insult my love.

1665
01:47:32,355 --> 01:47:34,721
Try to understand, uncle.

1666
01:47:35,826 --> 01:47:37,851
We love each other.

1667
01:47:38,728 --> 01:47:40,753
Uncle, please give me my Priya.

1668
01:47:41,131 --> 01:47:42,223
Please give me my Priya.

1669
01:47:42,332 --> 01:47:45,392
l won't let go until
you don't say yet.

1670
01:47:45,469 --> 01:47:46,868
Stop this nonsense.

1671
01:47:48,472 --> 01:47:52,431
l will go right now and
tell Priya everything.

1672
01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:54,902
l will tell her that
you aren't Vasant Kumar..

1673
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:59,744
..but Basant Kumar,
who's a cheat and a fraud.

1674
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:04,686
After that she will only hate.

1675
01:48:04,754 --> 01:48:07,052
Only hate.
- Uncle. Uncle.

1676
01:48:07,123 --> 01:48:08,317
Uncle, please.

1677
01:48:08,792 --> 01:48:12,159
Sir, please listen to me.

1678
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:15,323
Sir, please listen to me. Please.

1679
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:18,690
Uncle. Uncle.

1680
01:48:21,671 --> 01:48:23,468
Uncle, don't punish me so
severely for a small lie.

1681
01:48:23,573 --> 01:48:24,938
l will surely tell her.

1682
01:48:25,275 --> 01:48:28,369
You've betrayed her. l
will surely tell her. - Uncle.

1683
01:48:28,712 --> 01:48:30,509
Sir..
- Move aside.

1684
01:48:30,614 --> 01:48:31,842
l beg you.

1685
01:48:31,915 --> 01:48:33,678
Priya can never be yours.

1686
01:48:33,783 --> 01:48:34,977
Forget her.

1687
01:48:37,454 --> 01:48:39,615
Uncle. Uncle, please. l beg you.

1688
01:48:39,689 --> 01:48:42,556
l plead you. - l don't want
to see you anywhere near her.

1689
01:48:42,659 --> 01:48:43,751
Uncle, please.

1690
01:48:43,827 --> 01:48:45,317
Don't punish me so severely.

1691
01:48:45,395 --> 01:48:48,091
You cannot marry Priya
as long as l am alive.

1692
01:48:48,198 --> 01:48:50,462
Uncle, please. l cannot
live without her. - Never.

1693
01:48:50,534 --> 01:48:56,234
Uncle, please.
- Never. - Uncle..

1694
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:01,270
Priya.

1695
01:49:02,112 --> 01:49:04,205
Priya, l did commit a crime in love.

1696
01:49:04,915 --> 01:49:07,383
But...l am not a killer.

1697
01:49:07,817 --> 01:49:09,011
l am not a killer.

1698
01:49:09,085 --> 01:49:11,417
l am a lover.

1699
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:13,654
l am a lover.

1700
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:15,389
l am a lover.

1701
01:49:18,562 --> 01:49:21,861
l accidentally
killed my friend as well.

1702
01:49:22,132 --> 01:49:23,497
How could l kill him?

1703
01:49:23,967 --> 01:49:26,629
l couldn't stand
even a ant biting him?

1704
01:49:26,937 --> 01:49:28,336
How could l kill him?

1705
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,532
l would've given up my life for him.

1706
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:36,234
But he...he asked for Priya.

1707
01:49:38,248 --> 01:49:40,011
And l wouldn't have attacked him..

1708
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,945
..if he hadn't insulted my love.

1709
01:49:43,453 --> 01:49:45,819
As soon as hit him,
he fell in the ravine.

1710
01:49:45,889 --> 01:49:47,356
l tried to catch him.

1711
01:49:47,424 --> 01:49:52,657
l tried my best to
catch him...but, he slipped.

1712
01:49:54,097 --> 01:49:55,394
Believe me, Priya.

1713
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:56,827
l didn't want to kill him.

1714
01:49:57,167 --> 01:49:58,725
l wanted to save him, Priya.

1715
01:49:58,802 --> 01:50:00,030
l wanted to save him.

1716
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:02,670
l am not telling you this
so that you take pity on me.

1717
01:50:02,872 --> 01:50:04,897
lnstead, l want you
to understand my love.

1718
01:50:04,975 --> 01:50:08,206
l...l don't want to live
this life without you.

1719
01:50:08,278 --> 01:50:09,370
l..

1720
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,574
Priya, the police is coming.

1721
01:50:11,681 --> 01:50:12,739
l don't fear getting arrested.

1722
01:50:12,849 --> 01:50:14,749
But...but l don't want
to separate from you.

1723
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:18,682
l don't want to separate from you.
- Vasant!

1724
