1
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:44,797
'In Kanchana we saw how people used
to be petrified on seeing Kanchana.'

2
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,703
'Heartbeats used to stop.'

3
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,572
'There would b complete
darkness in front of the eyes.'

4
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,078
'Or one could say that the second
name for being scared was Kanchana.'

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,513
'If Kanchana looks
into someone's eyes..'

6
00:00:57,593 --> 00:01:00,326
'..that person can
see his death coming.'

7
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:07,720
'If someone is scared of Kanchana
then the crying of the baby..'

8
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:12,497
'..the sound of the wind
and the knocking of the doors..'

9
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:15,222
'..also seem like a death call.'

10
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:22,004
'If a human gets scared, he
will see Kanchana in his dreams too.'

11
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:23,161
'And then..'

12
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,978
If Raghava hears about it,
he will come here running..

13
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:27,606
Oh grandmother, oh grandmother.

14
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,712
Brother in law,
you have climbed the wrong tree.

15
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:31,940
The tree does not matter,
sister in law.

16
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,887
Being safe from the
ghost is more important.

17
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,217
If your brother sees this,
he will not spare me.

18
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:36,302
Sorry sister in law.

19
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:40,786
'In Kanchana 2, if people
used to look into Nandini's soul..'

20
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:44,994
'..strong people
used to be terrified..'

21
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:48,747
'Bravest of the bravest
would get scared.'

22
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,792
'People used get scared to such an
extent that he used to pray for death.'

23
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:58,895
'Not only ordinary people, even those
saints who used to control the ghosts..'

24
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:03,786
'..the people to work in the crematory
and the priests of the church..'

25
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,816
'..could not control Nandini.'

26
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:18,861
This time she has come
across some weird people.

27
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:22,101
'Such stupid idiots
in front of whom..'

28
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:25,960
'..the scariest ghost
finds himself useless.'

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,043
'He is Tulsi Chande.'

30
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:29,861
'He seems to be a
pure soul by his name..'

31
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,565
'..but he is the world's
biggest drunkard in reality.'

32
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:36,615
'After drinking a bottle in one go,
he does not care whether..'

33
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:37,979
'..there is a ghost in front
of him or the ghost's father.'

34
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,746
'He is not less than a demon.'

35
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,680
Hey stop, stop, stop..

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,835
A heavy toll has been
put for a good collection.

37
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:47,718
- Let him go.
- Go.

38
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,091
Hey listen I will buy
you a new and expensive bottle.

39
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,102
Hey, where are you coming from?

40
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,240
You will stop me?

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,700
I am a local citizen.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,537
- Really? - I am neither driving
a car nor am I on a bike.

43
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,808
I am going walking
then to you have a problem.

44
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,528
Okay okay go.

45
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,347
Oh I understood that you
have drunk an entire bottle.

46
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:04,719
Stop it and come here.
I said stop it.

47
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,016
- Mr. Bansay, keep the phone.
- Quite..

48
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,456
Hey, let that men come here.

49
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:09,813
Come, let's go to the head.

50
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:10,843
Go to the head.

51
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,996
- I will tell him who am i.
- Come.

52
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,432
My dear citizen,
how many bottles have you finished?

53
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,184
Should I do the alcohol test sir?

54
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,723
- Johnny, Johnny..
- Yes police.

55
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,770
- Drinking whiskey?
- No police.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,853
- Telling lies?
- No police.

57
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,980
- Open your mouth..
- Ha ha ha.

58
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:45,155
Dear citizen, how do you save money
to drink whiskey after paying tax?

59
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:48,039
Drinking and driving is dangerous.

60
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,833
Walking after drinking
is more dangerous.

61
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,695
Please take Mr. Citizen to the jail.

62
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,993
Who am I? Pure Pandit.

63
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:58,270
Officer,
let's have a parade competition.

64
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,493
If I lose, then put me into jail.

65
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:05,504
If drunkards are to parade, then
you will surely come first, citizen.

66
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:08,692
But to take part in it
you have to fill the entry from.

67
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,135
For this you have to go to jail.

68
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,782
I will not go to jail.

69
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,570
I will sleep here and
you will put up a tent for me.

70
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,995
Whatever you want to do, do it here.

71
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,024
Put that hot iron rod into my chest.

72
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:22,823
Or put me into piping
hot mustard oil and fry.

73
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,508
But I will not to the police station.

74
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:28,629
Oh Mr. Citizen,
you gave me a great idea.

75
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,051
I will obviously fulfill your dream.

76
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,639
In that too,
the idea of the iron rod is the best.

77
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,261
- Take him and put the iron
rod into him. - Leave.

78
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,925
Officer, leave me.

79
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,623
- Yes I am here. I shall talk to him.
- Go, go.

80
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,751
Sir, he is my friend.

81
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:44,688
He drank too much in tension.

82
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:45,692
Does this citizen drink every day?

83
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,619
No sir.

84
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,003
He lives in my neighborhood.

85
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,498
- He tried to be very smart.
- He will not do it now onwards.

86
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:50,633
- Tell it to him.
- Okay.

87
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:51,698
- Take him.
- Thank you sir.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,141
'So we shall now meet a skillful,
simple..'

89
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:59,256
'..and a happy family
with moral values.'

90
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:02,788
'This family is satisfied
with their small happy moments..'

91
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:06,206
'..that they do not care
about the rest of the world.'

92
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,426
Father, take the blessings.

93
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:13,887
Stay blessed.

94
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,398
- And now the offering.
- What are you doing?

95
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,111
And that's it.

96
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,297
You take good care of me.

97
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:29,181
Hey..

98
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,942
If you see it very closely,
you will get spectacles.

99
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:37,505
When will you learn?

100
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,525
How did this happen?

101
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,127
Deepa?

102
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,035
Wow, so beautiful.

103
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,966
Very nice.

104
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,385
What a great thing child.

105
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,245
Very nice.

106
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,126
M for Mango.

107
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:40,621
Sister..

108
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,840
Sister where are you?

109
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,594
Sister..

110
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,101
Where are you?

111
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,612
I don't know how is grandmother?

112
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,733
Should we call up brother
and ask him how he is?

113
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:02,146
Savitri was being stubborn
for going to Malaysia.

114
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:04,111
Your brother will handle everything.

115
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:07,738
Whenever we talk about
brother you become emotional.

116
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,177
It's not like that.

117
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,784
I had decided to stay separately
by carefully thinking everything.

118
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,004
- Grandfather, grandfather.
- What happened Deepa?

119
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,733
Do you know I have magical powers?

120
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:20,957
When I clap, the doors will open.

121
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,578
Really? Show me.

122
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,801
It was a good try.

123
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,245
Now go and play.

124
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,175
You are so cute.

125
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:47,719
This is my toy.

126
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:08,388
Abracadabra..

127
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,694
Give me the toy back.

128
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:25,517
- Sister..
- Deepa..

129
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,803
- Sister..
- Deepa..

130
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,326
- Sister..
- What happened?

131
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:30,157
What happened to you Deepa?

132
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,560
Sister, a boy came and he
snatched my doll and went away.

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,580
Where is he?

134
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,272
And where is the doll?

135
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:39,815
A cute fat boy came
and he took my doll away.

136
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,749
You are becoming naughty day by day.

137
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,816
Go and play with grandfather. Go.

138
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,133
Deepa, Deepa..

139
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:07,332
- Chandu..
- What happened, sister?

140
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,266
Chandu..

141
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,329
- Chandu..
- What happened, sister?

142
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,459
Deepa was right. There is someone
else in this house other than us.

143
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,129
Don't be scared.
I am with you. Nothing will happen.

144
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,092
Come..

145
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:24,978
Now it is your turn, okay.

146
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:31,725
Grandfather, you go and hide. After
you clap three times I shall find you.

147
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:34,779
Understood.
I have to clap three times. Okay.

148
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,094
Keep standing here.

149
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:39,822
Ready..

150
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:46,924
1, 2, 3..I will find you grandfather.

151
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:56,461
I have come to know
where you are hiding.

152
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,687
I will catch you.

153
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,878
I found you. Now you cannot escape.

154
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:11,886
Deepa, child Deepa..

155
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,463
- What happened, child?
- Grandfather, grandfather..

156
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:16,330
- What happened, child?
- What happened to you, Deepa?

157
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:33,998
'He is Babu. By work he is a barber.'

158
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,526
'But his actions and attitude
is such that even film star.'

159
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,369
"Number 1 girl.."

160
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:43,973
Oh no..

161
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,526
"Number 1 girl.."

162
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,083
Come, come up..

163
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,927
What do you Ramesh babu
the value of two tears?

164
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:24,089
Wait, I will kill you..

165
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:30,693
Enough..look towards left..that side..

166
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:36,150
Great, great, this side..

167
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,508
Go back, go back..

168
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:44,773
Very good..back..stop..

169
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:48,007
Here is Babu Gote
and here is Babu star..

170
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,066
Here is the razor
and there is the sword.

171
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:53,584
- Absolutely useless.
- I..

172
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:55,146
To hell with industry.

173
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:59,540
Instead of being in film industry you
are making the heads of people shine.

174
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,705
Films need a hit hero.

175
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,286
Hello Raju, I am Paanikum speaking.

176
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,870
The fourth idiot of
4 idiots has been found.

177
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,108
How does he look?

178
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:15,156
Face like a pumpkin, round eyes,
dry lips as if thirsty for 100 years.

179
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:16,811
The nose seems to
be like hard lady finger.

180
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:18,662
It will become better
with plastic surgery.

181
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,743
It is a rich party so
arrangements will be made.

182
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:23,367
There is no need for screen test.
We will start straight with shoot.

183
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,342
Is Deepika Padukone the heroine? Okay.

184
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,411
It was Raju's phone.

185
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,589
Who was this Raju?

186
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,017
Directors of Three Idiots.

187
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:32,059
Do you know people die to meet him?

188
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:36,084
If I want then I can
get you the film in 5 minutes.

189
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:38,381
Just one role. One small role.

190
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,614
Not small role but you will lead.

191
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,081
Will you give me heart attack now?

192
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,406
- 3-3 films.
- Listen carefully.

193
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,377
You will have to spend some money.

194
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,971
How much money?

195
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,733
Is this your own shop or is on rent?

196
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,531
My father's..

197
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,607
Give me 10lakhs and
I will brighten your future.

198
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,827
Where will I get this much from?
Please lessen the amount.

199
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:00,568
Is it more?

200
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:04,199
Think it over brother. There
are many people who want the role.

201
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,094
10 lakh 1, 10 lakh 2, 10 lakh..

202
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,781
This is 10 lakhs.

203
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,375
Your shop has become famous.

204
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,608
It was not a shop but waste.

205
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,109
We shall start shooting from tomorrow.

206
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,716
Jhumri talaiya,
Deepika Chopra, 5 star hotel.

207
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:27,705
I will put your posters in the entire
country, you will become a superstar.

208
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,653
Your life is going
to take a turn Gote.

209
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,501
Why have you got this razor?

210
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,068
This is my lucky razor.

211
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:34,297
I had shaved the first man with this.

212
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,509
- Should I throw this?
- No need.

213
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,847
If you become a big star
in future this will help you..

214
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,549
..to cut the ribbons
in the inauguration.

215
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,270
- Yes, you are right. - Come on it's
the time to take the first shot.

216
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,329
- Hey you, carrying an umbrella.
- Yes I am coming.

217
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,612
Don't cover me. Cover the hero.

218
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:45,879
Oh the hero.

219
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:47,058
But why for me?

220
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:48,464
You are the hero.

221
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,030
Do you know this rule of the industry?

222
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,337
The hero never walks in the sunlight.

223
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,120
- Really?
- Come on now.

224
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,490
- Just a minute.
- Come on.

225
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,802
Bless me, oh industry.

226
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:58,765
The press is present here.

00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,708
I shall give your breaking news.

228
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,169
Hey there.

229
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,831
Hey Paanikum, have you
found another man to cheat on.

230
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:06,237
Hera me out bro,
just telecast a fake news of him.

231
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,294
Just about four five lines.

232
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,192
Here keep this money.
Thank you.

233
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:11,501
Who is there?

234
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,306
The press is eagerly
waiting to meet you.

235
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,983
Wear the goggles so that the
flash doesn't fall into your eyes.

236
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:15,757
What if I don't wear them?

237
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,113
If you don't wear it you
won't be considered as a hero.

238
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:17,965
- Wear it.
- Sorry sir.

239
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:20,446
Hello.

240
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:21,784
Hello, Mr. Subhash Ghai.

241
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:23,218
How are you?

242
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,499
The new hero? Babu Gote? He is here.

243
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,059
You will cast him in the next film?

244
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,888
Along with Salman and Shahrukh..
He is not available sir.

245
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,096
Salman sir I am ready.

246
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,452
We shall see him in the next film..

247
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:34,604
Okay sir, okay. Bye.

248
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,273
Subhash Ghai wasn't in a hurry,
so why were you?

249
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,092
You are such a fool.

250
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:37,991
First you wear the shades.

251
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:40,076
Never do a double hero film.
Understood?

252
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,641
Rule number 3,
never work with upcoming heros.

253
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,827
- Never.
- Now action.

254
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,005
If you have washed your hands,
bless me.

255
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:46,816
May you become hit soon.

256
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:48,892
- Don't let him move out
of the umbrella. - Okay.

257
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,755
Sir, what is your secret to success?

258
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,986
You are offered three
big films together.

259
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,708
How did this happen sir?

260
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,688
Sir did you ever work in serials?

261
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,578
- Sir go on the stage.

262

You keep taking pictures.

263
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,850
Did you call him?

264
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,086
- I did not.
- Hi.

265
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,853
Sir I am Prakash.

266
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,783
Would you like to tell
us about your upcoming film?

267
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,447
- Greetings to all of you.
- Greetings to all of you.

268
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,022
Mike is working.

269
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:39,523
Even mine is working.

270
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:40,391
Okay.

271
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,152
I would be really happy
to work with the 70mm banner.

272
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:49,621
The 70mm banner crew has promised me..

273
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:51,517
..that I will be seen
on the entire 70mm banner.

274
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:52,915
That to as a hero.

275
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,022
Who has called him?

276
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,710
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

277
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,492
Babu Gote, the hero of this film.

278
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,471
So who do you think am I?
Villain?

279
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,090
He is the hero Salman Hashmi.

280
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,529
If he is the hero then who am I?

281
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:04,574
The one who cooks?

282
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,428
I don't do duet hero films.

283
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:07,729
I have had a deal with Paanikum.

284
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,687
I will do only solo hero
films and reject the rest.

285
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,749
- Who is Paanikum?
- This man doesn't know Paanikum.

286
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,007
Ghai Subhash, Mustan Abbas, Bhanssali,
he has made them t great directors.

287
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:15,941
- You don't know him?
- Get out.

288
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:17,027
Keep your hands down.

289
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:18,570
Take him out.

290
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,161
I hope the media sees it.
You are getting some good news.

291
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,083
- I have given 10 lakhs to the film.
- Get out.

292
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,886
- Let me go inside or I will be ruined.
- Get out of here.

293
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:46,788
There is a flood expected in
Uttarakhand due to the heavy rainfall.

294
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:48,803
Many buildings have collapsed.

295
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,410
The roads have been blocked
due to heavy rocks falling down.

296
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:55,446
There is a lot of chaos in the city.

297
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:57,234
The Alakhnanada river
is overflowing with water..

298
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:58,655
..that has reached a dangerous level.

299
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,422
There is a lot of destruction
in the low lying areas.

300
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:04,807
The highway connecting Delhi
and Haridwar has been stopped.

301
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,359
According to the
meteorological department..

302
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:10,160
..such weather conditions are supposed
to continue for the next 48 hours.

303
00:21:10,397 --> 00:21:11,442
- Hello.
- Hello.

304
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:12,764
- Hey Vimal.
- Say.

305
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:15,033
Oh Vimal, listen to me carefully.

306
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:17,358
Did you get any news about my parents?

307
00:21:17,438 --> 00:21:19,324
I am tensed about them
after seeing the news.

308
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,537
I am trying for the
past four five days..

309
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:22,105
..but I am not able to get
any information regarding them.

310
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:24,153
Please try brother,
I am really tensed.

311
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,232
Have some patience.
I am trying my best.

312
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,386
Due to rains everything is hay wired.

313
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,904
My friend,
you have a lot of resources.

314
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:34,391
Try and get some information.

315
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:36,163
- Please.
- Okay I will see.

316
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,337
Don't worry Ram.

317
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:42,029
It was my fault.

318
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,755
I agreed to them and sent them alone.

319
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,842
Nothing will happen
if I sit here calmly.

320
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,218
I have to go to India.

321
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:50,623
Yes okay.

322
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:11,815
Why have you got me here?

323
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:12,860
I am sorry.

324
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:17,063
I could not find
your parents anywhere.

325
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:19,094
I had to stop the search operations.

326
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,849
There are some unidentified
bodies in the hospital.

327
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:22,541
Just go and check.

328
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,174
You may recognize them.

329
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,455
Ram.

330
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,350
I could not even see
the before they died.

331
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,418
Whenever I see this house,
it reminds me of my parents.

332
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:23,658
I will not be able
to stay here without them.

333
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:29,043
I will finish all the
formalities till next week..

334
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,063
..and then return to Malaysia.

335
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:34,456
I may not even come
to India after this.

336
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:35,939
What will you do of this house?

337
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:40,384
What will I do of this house
when my parents aren't alive?

338
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,055
I shall sell it soon.

339
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,266
Will have to find
someone who will buy it.

340
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:52,562
Take this aunt.

341
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:55,171
May every parent get a child
as capable and humble as you.

342
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:58,671
Ram, I have talked
to an agent whom I know.

343
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:01,897
He told me that a family
is interested in buying your house.

344
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:03,303
See, tomorrow is an auspicious day.

345
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:07,177
If you like their offer they shall
do the housewarming rituals tomorrow.

346
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:15,585
Grandfather, are ghosts for real?

347
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:18,414
I am really scared grandfather.

348
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,242
Deepa, no need to be scared.

349
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,766
I know a good priest,
I will call him tomorrow.

350
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,526
- Okay?
- Okay.

351
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,859
Hey come here.
You are overacting now.

352
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:46,959
- Come here.
- Sir, sir, sir, sir..

353
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,568
Hey where is the ghost? Show me.

354
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,173
I swear upon my late mother.
It is here only.

355
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:53,614
- Sir, sir, sir..
- Are you playing a game with us?

356
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,476
Sir, the ghosts play games here.

357
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:57,095
They play hide and seek at night, sir.

358
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,458
Ask Narayana.

359
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,070
What if this is a lie?

360
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,239
Then don't give me money.

361
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,713
And shave off my beard and
hair and make me sit on a donkey.

362
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:16,034
Come Mr. Narayana.

363
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,608
- This is the main hall.
- Okay.

364
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:22,379
You have to cook food there.

365
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,575
That side is the bedroom
where you can sleep together.

366
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,270
And upstairs is the
room to sleep alone.

367
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,097
I shall show you the bathroom.
Come madam.

368
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,090
That toy is mine.

369
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,035
That's my toy.

370
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,755
Give me my toy back.

371
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,690
- Father, father.
- What happened child?

372
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,489
There is a ghost's
daughter in that room.

373
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,607
There is nothing like ghosts.
Go and play.

374
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,448
Hey wait.

375
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,672
There is a ghost in this house.

376
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,393
You want to kill us. Fool.

377
00:27:35,473 --> 00:27:36,711
Hey wait.

378
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,086
I found you.

379
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,078
I found you, grandfather.

380
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:58,613
Grandfather..

381
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,198
If you want to stay
alive run from here.

382
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,247
I swear upon my hair.
There are many ghosts here.

383
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,773
I can't believe this
young man's talks.

384
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,754
But we can earn a lot from his story.

385
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,952
Hey, take this and enjoy.

386
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,428
We shall spread rumors in the market..

387
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:28,169
..that there are forty and
not four ghosts in this house.

388
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,467
Exaggerate and speak.

389
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:31,632
- What will happen then?
- Get lost.

390
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:35,546
Yadav, Ram wants
to sell this house fast.

391
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,305
And there are rumors
of ghosts in this house.

392
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:40,230
We can get a lot of
money from this house.

393
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,698
Such opportunities don't come often.

394
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:45,024
We shall destroy this
house and bring up a multiplex.

395
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,314
We will divide the profits as well.

396
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:48,097
- Isn't this a great deal?
- It's a great deal.

397
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:49,907
- Let's get to work.
- Let's go.

398
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:51,544
Grandfather.

399
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:53,740
Grandfather, grandfather.
Careful.

400
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,376
Sister..

401
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:59,043
Are we all dead?

402
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:01,650
Have we become ghosts, sister?

403
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:11,448
Grandfather, none of us remember
that how and when we died.

404
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,077
I am desirous of seeing grandmother.

405
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:41,182
Once the body dies then
even human relationships die.

406
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:44,685
No doubt we are dead but
love for grandmother is still alive.

407
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:48,465
That is why our souls
are still not at peace.

408
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,880
Why don't we stay here
till grandmother returns?

409
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,057
The people who are going to
come here will not let us stay here.

410
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:02,841
They have come to
know that we are ghosts.

411
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,354
They will try to make
us run away from here.

412
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:06,599
I am not bothered.

413
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,647
Till grandmother does not
come we will not go from here.

414
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:12,494
Sister, till we were alive
we lived under the shadow of fear.

415
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,553
Now what will we do after dying.

416
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,725
Along with body the
fear of mind has also died.

417
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:27,921
Now we have nothing to lose.

418
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:31,895
Till yesterday whatever was our
weakness will now become our strength.

419
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,090
To scare others is
our weapon from today.

420
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,421
Father really loved this car.

421
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:49,298
Sir, keep these keys with you.
This house is haunted.

422
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,363
- I will not be able to sell it.
- What nonsense are you talking?

423
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:52,641
There is nothing as ghosts..

424
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,528
To reduce the rate you
are spreading unnecessary rumors.

425
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:57,849
Sir, if the house is sold at a good rate
then I will get a good commission.

426
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,938
- Forgive me, sir. I have
small children.. - Hey, listen..

427
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,363
Are there really ghosts in the house?

428
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:05,804
How could you get influenced by him?
He is an uneducated agent.

429
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:08,367
I know a big builder.
His name is Yadav.

430
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:10,747
He is not scared of
ghosts..he will buy it.

431
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,039
Today evening we will go
to his office and talk to him.

432
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:24,085
Greetings. Here comes the fool.

433
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:25,729
Sit down.

434
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,653
He wants to eat chicken
but a vegetarian one.

435
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,296
- Has the vegetarian chicken come?
- Yes sir.

436
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:33,329
- Fry it and get it.
- He is a drunkard..

437
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,872
Thank you.

438
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,149
Sit down.

439
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:41,063
Sir, you cannot drink too much.

440
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:44,279
You drink juice,
offer prayers and earn goodness.

441
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,719
Do you know priest and
children are not allowed in bar?

442
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,182
I will teach you a
crash course in drinking.

443
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,922
I have made many people drunkard
and so I will make you also.

444
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,368
Do you know my name?
Blockbuster drunkard.

445
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:00,498
Nice meeting you.

446
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:03,609
Pick up the bottle
and feel its weight.

447
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:07,417
Tap it from top and bring
its intoxication above.

448
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:12,433
Sometimes the intoxication is stubborn
and it does not come up in once.

449
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:16,629
For that tap it from below
and open the cap immediately.

450
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,704
That's well played. Great shot.

451
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,010
He has played it against the time.

452
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:49,370
Hey, brother what are you doing?

453
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,042
I am checking the book.

454
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,740
Match is going on
there and book is here.

455
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,223
So he is a bookie.

456
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,712
He will surely hit
a six on the next ball.

457
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:01,947
He hits very comfortably.

458
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,242
This is good one..

459
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:06,684
The ball goes out.

460
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:08,599
Very very big..

461
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,504
Hit again for a six.

462
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:13,692
Bookie brother,
even this ball will go for a six.

463
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:15,753
Bet. The entire match is fixed.

464
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,502
The next ball will also go for six.

465
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:19,390
-This drunkard is going to be smashed.
- Ball is in air..

466
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,132
- Priest..
- Leave me..

467
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,768
The planetary condition is not good.

468
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,692
- Keep quiet. let him play.
- Correct..

469
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,412
I am going to become rich.

470
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:29,408
Oh no..

471
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:34,916
Foolish, this is an old match.
Go and see the horoscopes..

472
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,735
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

473
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,022
You were not ready
to listen and see anything.

474
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:41,496
By showing me an old
match you made me a fool.

475
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:43,855
- Give me money back.
- Hey, take him out..

476
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:45,165
Listen..

477
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:47,659
- Leave me..
- Listen to me..

478
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,659
Friends work in progress..

479
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,388
Sir, he is a poor man. In frustration
he will give birth to children.

480
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:55,007
Quiet. Go and take order.

481
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,845
Look Ram Babu,
finalize the deal in 1crore.

482
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,402
I shall make the entire payment today.

483
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:07,066
The market value is 10crores
and you are giving 1crore.

484
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,958
It is very much for
a house that is haunted.

485
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,463
What is this?
In modern times you believe in ghosts.

486
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:15,576
God is not to be
seen but men are seen.

487
00:34:15,656 --> 00:34:18,593
Even then there is more
believe in God than in men.

488
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:21,435
It is not matter of being
seen but it is of faith and belief.

489
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,258
Yadav, 1crore is very less.

490
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,538
It is not more important than life.

491
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:27,669
Think it over. This is final offer.

492
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:29,771
Rest is your wish.
I will give full cash.

493
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,299
Hey Siddhu,
do not take bill from them.

494
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,198
I got you, sir.

495
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,366
Did you hear?
You want to go to Malaysia.

496
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:39,474
He says that the house is haunted.
Now what will you do?

497
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,289
Talk to him and finalize
the deal in the correct rate.

498
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,498
I will talk to him again and then
will call you. Don't take tension.

499
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:47,669
Greetings..hello..

500
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:55,054
Sir can I say something
which I should not be saying.

501
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,506
I have n idea that will
neither cause loss to you..

502
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,056
..and the profit will not be known.

503
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:01,265
People say that it is haunted.
No one will be able to stay there.

504
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:02,632
Sir if a human being cannot
stay then how will ghosts stay.

505
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,682
Then tell me what should be done.

506
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:07,952
We will give the house on rent and will
give cash back offer to the tenant.

507
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:10,728
We will give free stay
for 3nights and 4 days.

508
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,687
They will stay there. The matter will
spread. They will comment and share..

509
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,152
Then many people will come
and will pay as per your rate.

510
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:19,940
Will you be able to find such people
who will be ready for this offer?

511
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:25,043
Sir I know an unqualified person.
He can do anything for money.

512
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,850
That rascal is
appropriate for this work.

513
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,675
Shall we start mission roommate.

514
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:33,647
Sir, do not miss my
commission of the mission.

515
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:35,947
I will give him a missed call.

516
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:46,974
I think Siddhu is right. I remembered
ghost on seeing this bungalow.

517
00:35:47,054 --> 00:35:51,177
How will ghosts harm us?
We are godfather of ghosts.

518
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,135
Hey, did you call the photographer?

519
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:19,059
If we find any ghost
then we will make a video..

520
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,401
..and earn money through you tube.

521
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:22,665
The photo would have
come if there was ghost here.

522
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,353
Hey, why are you taking my photograph?

523
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,392
For safety, brother.

524
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,477
If we do not find any ghost
then we will upload your horror face.

525
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:31,701
- Get lost..
- Hey, get lost from here..

526
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:32,835
Go..

527
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:37,109
That is my toy.

528
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:26,803
Cute..

529
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,785
Oh no..

530
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:29,030
Phulwari, get up.
There is ghost in the house.

531
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,487
Phulwari, wake up.

532
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:34,720
Brother Shankar, where are you?

533
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:36,303
Phulwari..

534
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:41,052
This house is ours.

535
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:55,431
Dear nurse cum mother.

536
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:56,671
Water..

537
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,519
The water given by drunkard
must be intoxicated.

538
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,483
Mother, after eating
one tablet the BP will lower..

539
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,095
..but if I eat two then I will die.

540
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:07,394
- Come on drink coffee. Come on.
- No.

541
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:10,429
- Laxmi..
- I am coming.

542
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:12,706
Hurry up. Laxmi,
take mother inside and let her rest.

543
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:14,011
- She needs rest very badly.
- Mother.

544
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,397
She is losing her memory.
Rest in peace, mother.

545
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:17,657
Slowly, slowly cross the road.

546
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:18,590
Okay, brother.

547
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,053
Why are you so sad?

548
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:23,564
What to tell you?
The intoxication ruined everything.

549
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,712
I lost money in gambling which I had
kept aside for operation of the son.

550
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,762
My wife has stopped giving me food.

551
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:31,197
I would be grateful if
you help me to get money back.

552
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:35,391
Impossible. It is impossible
to get money back from Yadav.

553
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:37,585
We will have to earn this
lost money from somewhere else.

554
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:38,775
Brother Setu.

555
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,051
Only you can help my dying son.

556
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:47,569
Make arrangements for
money for his operation.

557
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:49,424
I have no expectation
from that drunkard.

558
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:53,256
Please save my dear son.
I will make you eat delicious food.

559
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:55,428
Please give me money for operation.

560
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,895
This will cause trouble.

561
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,116
Where is she gone?

562
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:00,146
Emotional blackmail.

563
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:01,863
- Get my money back.
- Stop doing over acting.

564
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:03,689
Sister-in-law made me emotional..

565
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,294
..otherwise I would
have taught you a lesson.

566
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:06,760
- Wait, the money would come.
- Till when?

567
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,028
Hey, you beggar. I am going
to finalize the deal. Have patience.

568
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:15,213
Is everybody home? Brother, Shankar..

569
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:18,981
Get a side. Open the door..

570
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:23,516
Hey, let me go..

571
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,140
Who is there..

572
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,108
Wait, wait..where are you going?

573
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:29,164
Mr..there is marathon in the village.

574
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,756
Phulwari, what happened?
Why are you lying down here?

575
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,058
Wake up Sid. No hartbeat.

576
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,261
Brother Shankar, hey brother Shankar..

577
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:39,541
Sir.

578
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:41,690
Hey, you had said that there are
three people. Where is the third one?

579
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,271
He must be here.

580
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:43,760
Who will be responsible
if anyone dies?

581
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,790
Only Yamraaj..

582
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,384
You are wasting time by getting
involved in his foolish talks.

583
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:48,565
No one will give
better money than Yadav.

584
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,603
Sir, one last chance please..

585
00:44:50,683 --> 00:44:52,590
If you could not do it this
time then what will you do further.

586
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,540
I will stay here.

587
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,618
I will stay here and prove
that there is no ghost. Sir, please..

588
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:56,587
- Yadav..
- Yes, brother.

589
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:57,832
- Where are you now?
- In the bar.

590
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:00,356
Okay I am coming with
Ram to finalize the deal.

591
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:01,026
- Okay.
- Sir, please..

592
00:45:01,106 --> 00:45:02,332
Come on Ram let's go and meet Yadav.

593
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:03,678
Sir, please give me one last chance.

594
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:05,172
Okay, I will give you one last chance.

595
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:06,590
Last and final chance.

596
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,376
If you stay here and prove that there
is no ghost then I will give you 10%

597
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:10,896
Thank you.

598
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:12,280
Just check whether this
old man is dead or alive.

599
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,188
Okay sir.

600
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,406
- Come on..
- Phulwari..no reply.

601
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:17,631
Brother Shankar..brother Shankar..

602
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:19,778
Where are you, Shankar?

603
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:21,389
Oh no..

604
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,900
Sorry, I could not
see anything in tension.

605
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,339
- Get a side.
- Doctor has come.

606
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:37,297
So, patient..

607
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:41,809
Your condition is like a dead body.
We will have to do post mortem.

608
00:45:41,937 --> 00:45:45,075
The pulse rate is zero.
I think you are about to die.

609
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:46,198
But I am there.

610
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:50,626
God should give this power to doctor
that whom to kill and whom to save.

611
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,969
Look at him. He consumed
poison but we did not let him die.

612
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,032
Just chill doctor..just chill..

613
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:58,639
Do not do too much chill otherwise
I will have to give you pill.

614
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:01,019
Next time consume
poison of better quality.

615
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:03,626
If you die then your
postmortem will be free.

616
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,071
If your condition deteriorates
then take medicine with Ganges water.

617
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:09,930
Take care of him.

618
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:22,334
Why did you try to die?

619
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,058
It is a long story. If you make
a movie then will give two points.

620
00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:12,103
Please don't cry. Please don't cry.
How much money you want?

621
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:13,963
Heroine, location,
director all together I need 50 lakhs.

622
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:15,663
If you give me 1crore
then I will become a hero.

623
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:17,190
- Give me your lucky razor.
- Okay, I will give.

624
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,447
I hope you will not cut my throat.

625
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,595
What else will I cut?

626
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:21,228
Get my 10lakhs back.

627
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:23,000
I am telling the truth that I
shall shave your beard with new blade.

628
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,301
I shall get it back for you.

629
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:28,764
Do you think I am Reverse bank
of Bangkok? Don't push me from behind.

630
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,801
Shah Rukh of poor,
Your life on road is useless.

631
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:33,690
In three days of your
life let me spend money.

632
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,576
And then you will become
famous at the multiplex.

633
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:38,491
He took 10lakhs but you are
trying to take everything I have.

634
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,782
I have this razor
left so how shall I give.

635
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,886
Shall I make you
fortunate with this razor?

636
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:44,097
Sir..

637
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:50,593
He still has razor but I have nothing.

638
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:53,298
I will do your work. Give me 10lakhs.

639
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:56,668
Or give me 7.5 lakhs
or even 4 lakh would do.

640
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,252
I will do your work.

641
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,658
Okay, deal done.

642
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:03,712
From 10lakhs you have come straight
to 4 lakhs. What happened with you?

643
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,818
Hey brother, is the AC on inside.
Superb..

644
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,258
Thank you.

645
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,327
As soon as bank knows
about the theft in ATM..

646
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:30,777
..our security agency will get closed,
brother-in-law.

647
00:49:30,857 --> 00:49:32,565
That is why we have kept money in ATM.

648
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:35,158
When he will be thrashed 2-4
times then he will tell everything.

649
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:38,422
Sir..

650
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,230
- Raja..
- Sir..

651
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,576
Is this an ATM or
hotel for entertainment?

652
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:56,192
That they gave rent
for the room and went away.

653
00:49:56,467 --> 00:50:00,058
Or public toilet in which
they passed urine and stool?

654
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:01,032
No sir.

655
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:03,424
Did you see the video?
What did you understand after seeing?

656
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:06,488
What were you doing?
Show the film after the interval.

657
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:14,593
- Raja..
- Sir..

658
00:50:14,673 --> 00:50:20,146
I am not boasting
but you play it well.

659
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:27,009
Your aunt has spoiled my mood. Play
such a tune that I forget your aunt.

660
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,177
You play it so well.

661
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:42,563
Your case is closed before writing.

662
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:44,715
This is promise by police.
Now we are friends.

663
00:50:44,831 --> 00:50:46,265
Sir, thank you.

664
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:47,646
- Now do one thing.
- Yes, tell me.

665
00:50:47,726 --> 00:50:49,789
- Return that stolen money.
- Okay.

666
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:52,920
Sir, I don't have that money..

667
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,782
- Child..
- I swear sir.

668
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:56,066
- Don't you have money?
- No sir.

669
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,899
- Will you play flute?
- Why would I lie?

670
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,533
Father..

671
00:51:04,117 --> 00:51:05,197
Stop playing flute.

672
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,872
After hearing the tune tears
have started falling from my eyes.

673
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:10,763
I understood. We all are in pain.

674
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:13,992
If you work for me then
I will give everyone 10lakhs cash.

675
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,369
- Yes.
- What?

676
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,472
Even after hearing 10lakhs
this useless man has not become happy.

677
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:19,659
- His ear machine is out.
- A good chance.

678
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,445
If you work for me then
I will give you 10lakhs.

679
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:25,891
- 10 lakhs..
- Control..

680
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:27,458
- You are great sir.
- Wait.

681
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:07,725
[Sanskrit slok]

682
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:08,845
Oh God.

683
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:12,694
Come.

684
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:14,589
What is this?

685
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:19,187
Where are you?

686
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,474
Who are you people? The keys are
with me then how did you get inside?

687
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,014
Please sir, please do not disturb me.

688
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:26,854
Wait for 2 minutes.
It will be completed. Please..

689
00:52:38,604 --> 00:52:41,966
I know you are hiding somewhere here.

690
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:46,285
Come out.
Your brother has come to meet you.

691
00:52:46,423 --> 00:52:47,205
Brother..

692
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,603
Brother..

693
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:57,631
Sister..

694
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:00,565
What is going on?

695
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:01,506
I don't know what is going on.
Everyone is sitting.

696
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:02,336
I do not know who they are.

697
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:04,814
What are you doing here?
Whom did you ask before coming here?

698
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,297
- Come on get up..
- Sir, I will tell you.

699
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:10,142
Please listen, sir. The soul
of my family members is stuck here.

700
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:13,023
After asking them that where my
Aadhaar card is I will go from here.

701
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,512
- In which age are you living?
- Please sir.

702
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:16,691
And what is the soul of
your family doing in my house.

703
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:18,881
- Believe me, they are here.
- What nonsense is this?

704
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:23,343
No, no..Vimal,
remove everything from here.

705
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:26,376
- Sir please, don't do this.
- Get lost from here.

706
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:29,309
Hey, he threw the Tantric.

707
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:32,372
Hey, these souls are
trapped here for some reason.

708
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:33,773
They have to take revenge.

709
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:37,769
I can see your death close by..

710
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,216
Tomorrow morning dead bodies
of you all will be lying here.

711
00:53:40,296 --> 00:53:42,435
All will have a painful end.

712
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:44,566
- Okay, okay..go.. Okay, go from here.
- Everyone will be finished.

713
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:48,319
- Get lost from here.
- What you have done.

714
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:49,508
She will not spare you..

715
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:51,728
You did not believe the agent.

716
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:54,360
Out of the three people who stayed
here last night two have become mad..

717
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,746
..and the third one is still missing.

718
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:58,142
- By now he must have died.
- Ghosts stay here.

719
00:53:58,222 --> 00:54:00,019
This means it is a haunted bungalow.

720
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,435
All these are fake talks.
That is not the case.

721
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:03,077
Hey, have you brought
them here to die.

722
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,461
Have you all come here for picnic?

723
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,121
If anyone dies then
who will be responsible.

724
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,334
- Why will anyone die?
- What is this Ram?

725
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:09,382
Enough is enough..

726
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:10,677
- Sir..
- One second..

727
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,937
Siddhu, you wanted one last chance.

728
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,094
- Wanting, sir.
- Okay I give it.

729
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:17,093
If everything happens
according to the plan..

730
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:19,810
..then not 10% but will give you 20%

731
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:21,424
Done sir.

732
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:22,889
I will come and check
tomorrow morning.

733
00:54:23,212 --> 00:54:25,085
It is fine if you are
able to stay the entire night.

734
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:28,454
Otherwise I will finalize
the deal with Yadav.

735
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:29,796
- Staying, sir..
- Let's go Vimal.

736
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:36,855
Nonsense naughty, sage.

737
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,918
So much lemonade would have
been made with these many lemons.

738
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:41,970
Consider it your residence.

739
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:45,312
Bathroom is that side
and bedrooms on first floor.

740
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,462
Why are you worried?

741
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,985
Sir you did not do right with us.

742
00:54:50,065 --> 00:54:52,063
You did not tell us
that there are ghosts here.

743
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:53,096
You cheated us.

744
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:54,978
Believe me that I did not cheat you.

745
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,236
I am a priest but
believe more on ghosts.

746
00:54:57,316 --> 00:55:01,564
I will not believe even if God
comes and says that there is no ghost.

747
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,523
In childhood I never used to stammer..

748
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:06,701
..but after seeing the ghost
I got into the habit of stammering.

749
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:09,346
I will not be able to do this.
Please..

750
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:11,034
But..

751
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:15,866
On losing 10lakhs I was not so scared
as I am now on hearing about the ghost.

752
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:21,140
I can fight with Bahubali but do not
have strength to fight with ghosts.

753
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:24,141
For the sake of my
future mother-in-law..

754
00:55:45,556 --> 00:55:48,700
Fear, fear..from
who will you be scared?

755
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:53,083
Fear of losing child,
fear of wife leaving..

756
00:55:54,406 --> 00:55:57,196
..the fear of not giving
a hit after becoming a hero..

757
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,949
..fear of living a life
in jail after doing robbery.

758
00:56:02,122 --> 00:56:04,146
You will live in fear, die in fear.

759
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,080
You will be scared
of God as well as ghost.

760
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,024
You will live in fear
and will die of fear..

761
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:10,078
If you want to live
then kill the fear and live.

762
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,546
I will face fear alone..

763
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:13,880
..and that too by staying
here alone without three of you.

764
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:20,693
God help those who show courage..

765
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:23,580
If because of fear your mothers
would not have given birth to you..

766
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,387
..then would you be existing now.

767
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,625
You are lucky that nature
gave you another chance to live.

768
00:56:28,705 --> 00:56:30,888
And I am giving you
a chance to make it better.

769
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:38,200
If today you accept defeat because
of fear then you will always lose.

770
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,991
- Who will support me?
- I..

771
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:43,941
- Who will win over fear?
- I..

772
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,898
- Who will face fear boldly?
- I..

773
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,233
Hail to Maheshmati..

774
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:53,239
Hail to Maheshmati..

775
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:13,684
- Is everything okay?
- Yes sir.

776
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:16,032
- Is everyone ready?
- Ready, sir..

777
00:57:19,957 --> 00:57:21,418
Why are you standing behind?

778
00:57:21,498 --> 00:57:23,532
You face it. We will encourage you.

779
00:57:23,612 --> 00:57:24,950
We will cheer you from behind.

780
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,461
You are our leader, sir.

781
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,615
And the leader cheats everyone.
Don't you know this?

782
00:57:29,256 --> 00:57:31,105
Joking..responsibility..

783
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:38,544
Hey..sometime back you
shouted that you were ready.

784
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:40,215
And now you are vibrating.

785
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:42,938
By shouting I have gained confidence.

786
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:45,140
You carry one.
Today I will do shave of ghost.

787
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,514
Maintain your confidence.
Raju, no one is leader here.

788
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:52,198
We are team her and team members..

789
00:57:52,278 --> 00:57:54,801
Learn something from him.
He has lifted his dhoti to fight..

790
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,602
I have lifted to run away from here.

791
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,654
Will you run after
defeating ghost in race?

792
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:02,316
Suddenly I remembered that I had
to go for a naming ceremony of child.

793
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,485
So I shall go and make offerings.

794
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:04,846
He will not go anywhere.

795
00:58:04,926 --> 00:58:06,033
Everyone will stay together.

796
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:08,372
Hold each other's hand.
Come on hold it.

797
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,769
- Ready..
- Ready..

798
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:13,421
- Everything okay.
- Okay..

799
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:18,073
One, two, two and a half, three..

800
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,893
Hail Mahismati..

801
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,184
Leave me. Leave me.

802
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:25,631
What are you doing here?
Do you want to die?

803
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,629
There is ghost here as well as inside.

804
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,898
If you want to save your
life then go from here. Go..

805
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:32,653
- Who is he?
- I am going.

806
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:35,582
- Sir, was he a ghost?
- He is a man.

807
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:37,651
But he drinks a lot so
his face is like that of ghost.

808
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:39,649
I had kept him inside so
that no one is scared of him.

809
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:42,897
Sir, does the fear become
less by eating this tablet.

810
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,195
I will die if I do
not eat this tablet.

811
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:45,367
What are you talking?

812
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:47,412
If you die then you
will also become a ghost.

813
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:48,793
Don't die sir.

814
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:51,216
That is not in my hands
but in the hands of the heart.

815
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:52,784
It was okay if you
talked about bad liver..

816
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,689
..but what is the matter of bad heart.

817
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:56,142
What should I tell you?

818
00:58:56,507 --> 00:58:58,258
A woman disempowered me.

819
00:58:58,338 --> 00:58:59,710
- Are you going in flashback?
- Yes.

820
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,583
I will give background music.

821
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:01,647
- Give an emotional one.
- Okay.

822
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:08,426
'Greetings future mother-in-law.'

823
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,670
'What are you doing?'

824
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,258
'I am not touching your
feet but picking up the paper.'

825
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:14,339
'Your daughter and
I want to get married.'

826
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,276
'Not that one but this one..'

827
00:59:17,356 --> 00:59:19,680
'As soon as you give green
signal we will get married.'

828
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,920
'Is this true?'

829
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,117
'Yes, I want to get married to him.'

830
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:27,888
'If you marry him and go then
who will marry your younger sister.'

831
00:59:28,304 --> 00:59:33,853
'I am old and may die anytime.'

832
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:37,892
- 'If I die then who will
get her married. - Mother..'

833
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:40,385
'What about me? Once I die
no one is going to be bothered.'

834
00:59:40,465 --> 00:59:44,401
'But do not think about us.
Start planning your honeymoon.'

835
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,039
'If she had good figure
then even she might get someone.'

836
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,503
'God, I want to die
before their marriage.'

837
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:53,510
- 'And you go and eat poison.
Oh God, my luck.. - No! No!'

838
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,059
'Mother, I may die..'

839
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:02,092
'..but before my sister gets married
I will neither get married nor die.'

840
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,918
- 'I swear upon my mother.
- I am so proud of you my child.'

841
01:00:06,138 --> 01:00:08,468
'You take so much care
of your younger sister.'

842
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:11,619
'Let me go and see if she
has really consumed poison.'

843
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:17,875
- 'Dear, understand the situation.
- I understood.'

844
01:00:17,955 --> 01:00:22,372
'Before our marriage we will
have to fix your sister's marriage.'

845
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,375
- 'Am I right?
- Yes, you are right.'

846
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,984
'Mother, you strong
on has got job in Belgaum.'

847
01:00:29,064 --> 01:00:31,801
- 'Take this and live your life.
- May God bless you?'

848
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:34,259
'You got this foolish boy a job.'

849
01:00:34,695 --> 01:00:36,128
'The work of both children is done..'

850
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,436
'..so now when will you give
us permission to get married.'

851
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,772
'You fulfilled all the
wishes of this old woman..'

852
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:45,626
'..and now want to fulfill
your own wish, son.'

853
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:47,894
'Correct. You are right.'

854
01:00:47,974 --> 01:00:50,208
'Child, even you are fluttering.'

855
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:54,650
'I am dying to marry him just
like a frog jumps without water.'

856
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,366
'Marry him.'

857
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,568
'I do not know what kind
of daughter-in-law will come..'

858
01:00:58,648 --> 01:01:00,400
'..when your brother gets married.'

859
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,738
'Maybe she thrashes
me or gives me poison.'

860
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,141
'Don't worry about me. Go..'

861
01:01:08,321 --> 01:01:10,584
'May God rest my
husband's soul in heaven?'

862
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:15,242
'By putting three children
in my lap he went to heaven.'

863
01:01:15,669 --> 01:01:16,632
'Mother..'

864
01:01:16,712 --> 01:01:19,351
'I worked hard to
bring up three of you.'

865
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:21,984
'And now you all are
leaving me and going.'

866
01:01:22,064 --> 01:01:23,578
- 'Old woman..
- Mother..'

867
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:25,318
- 'My daily needs..
- I promise..'

868
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:27,177
- 'Her youth..
- Whatever may happen..'

869
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:28,995
'May go waste but will
not let her be mine.'

870
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:31,005
'First you will die and
only then I will get married.'

871
01:01:31,085 --> 01:01:32,360
'I will not speak further.
You only speak.'

872
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,473
'I swear upon you.'

873
01:01:34,553 --> 01:01:36,242
'You are not my daughter but son.'

874
01:01:36,322 --> 01:01:38,773
'I did not make a mistake
by giving birth to you.'

875
01:01:39,691 --> 01:01:42,775
- 'Dear..
- My dear..'

876
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:43,996
'When will we get married?'

877
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,407
- 'Forgive me.
- Enough..'

878
01:01:45,487 --> 01:01:48,458
'I feel scared seeing your hand.'

879
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,769
'Now I feel that I will lie down on
the death pyre along with your mother.'

880
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,214
'There is only one option left.
In one room kitchen..'

881
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:53,767
'..we will adjust mother as well.'

882
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,427
'And we will do work together..'

883
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:58,881
'Naughty boy..'

884
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,872
'Shelu..mother-in-law, call Shelu.'

885
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,549
'I have brought samples
of cards so that she can select.'

886
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:05,611
'Now card will not be required.'

887
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:07,146
'Why mother-in-law? Where is Shelu?'

888
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:10,605
'She had gone to cow shed to
get milk but has still not returned.'

889
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,377
'She knows that I put
more milk in my coffee.'

890
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:13,510
'So she must be getting it.'

891
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,473
'From today get into
the habit of black coffee.'

892
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:19,589
'She eloped with the milkman.'

893
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:26,871
'I am sorry Siddhu. The fault is mine.
I fell in love with him.'

894
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:30,549
'He was very honest.
He never added water in milk.'

895
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:34,020
'No knows what God
has in store for everyone.'

896
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,069
'That day the packet
milk got over for tea.'

897
01:02:37,149 --> 01:02:41,385
'I went to his cow shed to
get milk and fell in love with him.'

898
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:43,611
'Ask mother to buy packet milk.'

899
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:46,273
'Consider my mother as
yours and take care of her.'

900
01:02:46,353 --> 01:02:50,860
'I am sorry Siddhu. The fault is mine.
I fell in love with him.'

901
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:52,442
'He was very honest.'

902
01:02:52,824 --> 01:02:55,519
'He never added water in milk.
That was God's willingness.'

903
01:03:13,813 --> 01:03:15,437
'My God..'

904
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:17,980
'What happened, sir?'

905
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,877
'Normally there are
nine holes in the heart.'

906
01:03:19,957 --> 01:03:22,430
'But very few have an extra hole.'

907
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:23,795
'Am I that lucky man?'

908
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:26,199
'Not you but I am lucky.'

909
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:29,187
'Because of that hole
I will become rich.'

910
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:32,934
'Oh no..my girlfriend is responsible
for making this hole in my heart.'

911
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:35,816
'This is not because
of your girlfriend..'

912
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,178
'..but you have been
gifted with it at birth.'

913
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:40,451
- 'We have come to know about it today.
- How much would be the cost?'

914
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:42,164
'Just a matter of 50.
I will sew the hole.'

915
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:44,364
'50,000/- I will have
to break the piggy bank.'

916
01:03:44,444 --> 01:03:46,429
'Not 50,000/- but 50 lakhs.'

917
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:48,354
'Mother, I am dead.'

918
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:52,131
'Hey don't touch him.
The deal hasn't been finalized.'

919
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:53,923
'If you take tension
on every matter..'

920
01:03:54,003 --> 01:03:55,765
'..then instead of operation
we will have to do postmortem.'

921
01:03:55,845 --> 01:03:57,186
'How much does that cost?'

922
01:03:57,406 --> 01:03:59,241
'It is free of cost
in government hospital.'

923
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:00,934
'For free?
Then I shall go and get it done now.'

924
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:03,112
'That cannot happen now.
For that you will have to die.'

925
01:04:03,192 --> 01:04:05,989
'Oh..but sir I have 49lakhs less.'

926
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,127
'With such a small amount
I cannot sew such a big hole.'

927
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:11,816
'If you want then shall
I give you an advice for free?'

928
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:12,624
'If it is free then give..'

929
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:14,095
'Have you heard about
reverse emotional therapy?'

930
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:16,901
- 'What does that mean? - How do
you react when you are very happy?'

931
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,056
- 'I laugh a loud.
- From now try to cry.'

932
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:23,597
'What do you do when you are scared?'

933
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:25,324
'I start vibrating because of fear.'

934
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:27,582
'Look, when you feel
scared then laugh aloud.'

935
01:04:28,096 --> 01:04:30,281
'Now tell me what will
you do on seeing the ghost?'

936
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:31,744
'I will laugh, sir.'

937
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,421
'And when you hear a joke.'

938
01:04:33,763 --> 01:04:35,787
- 'I shall cry.
- Very good.'

939
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:39,041
'Till you follow this
therapy you will live.'

940
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:40,597
- 'What if I do not follow?
- Then you will die.'

941
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:42,096
'Discharge this poor fellow.'

942
01:04:42,176 --> 01:04:43,800
'Take 25,000/- for
the water we sprinkled..'

943
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,215
'..to help him gain consciousness.'

944
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:48,182
- 'Doctor..
- Reverse emotional therapy.'

945
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:49,654
'I forgot..doctor..'

946
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:53,577
'Make payment or otherwise
stay back in hospital.'

947
01:04:58,317 --> 01:05:03,631
One thing is common among us.
Bad luck and no money.

948
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:06,712
- Money is oxygen for us.
- He is right.

949
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:10,468
Life without money is
just like a flat Mercedes tyre.

950
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:12,971
We will have to take risk
to lift up from the poverty line.

951
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:16,437
If there are ghosts
here then we will die.

952
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:18,745
Even outside this
house we were dying only.

953
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:21,704
Till we do not stay here for four days
we are not going to get any money.

954
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:35,533
Hey, how did you come
in this haunted house?

955
01:05:35,613 --> 01:05:38,531
I shall make cocktail
of your blood and drink.

956
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:47,549
"There is happiness round when
she comes and sadness when she goes."

957
01:05:47,629 --> 01:05:49,892
Hey, will you make me deaf?
Lower the volume.

958
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:53,635
Learn something from this watchman.
He is sitting so peacefully..

959
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:55,533
- About whom are you talking?
- About you. Who else?

960
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,236
- Okay.
- I wish I had mute button.

961
01:05:57,316 --> 01:05:58,680
You want me to go mute.

962
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:01,398
His concept is different.

963
01:06:01,478 --> 01:06:03,394
What is that thing
that takes the man inside..

964
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:04,827
..and makes him move up and down?

965
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:06,479
Lift..

966
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:07,972
Why are you asking me if you know it?

967
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:09,225
Brother Siddhu, what is the time?

968
01:06:09,305 --> 01:06:11,263
Is it a medicine that
you have to take it on time?

969
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,758
- It's more than a medicine..
- After 8 comes 9..

970
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:14,810
It's not 9o'clock.

971
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,519
Hey drunkard, it is still not
9o'clock. He was solving a puzzle.

972
01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:30,595
I got the courage.

973
01:06:38,008 --> 01:06:40,791
- Greetings..
- Where are you going?

974
01:06:41,392 --> 01:06:44,376
Hey, how dare you ask me a question?

975
01:06:44,456 --> 01:06:46,016
You are younger to me.

976
01:06:46,096 --> 01:06:48,561
Just learn from him as to
how to give respect to a priest.

977
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,579
- Look down..look down..
- Listen..

978
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:54,767
How dare you argue with the priest?

979
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:56,502
I will not spare you.

980
01:06:56,582 --> 01:06:58,763
How many times does
the sun rise in a day?

981
01:07:01,015 --> 01:07:01,905
Hey, do you think I am a fool?

982
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:06,767
"Here I am.."

983
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:07,970
Toy?

984
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:12,821
This is not a good thing. Got it.

985
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:18,548
Because whomever drinks,
I don't go there for ritual offerings.

986
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:20,785
Listen, now I am going to sleep.

987
01:07:20,865 --> 01:07:24,459
If you feel like urinating
then do it on me. Understood.

988
01:07:30,387 --> 01:07:31,825
What kind of sound was this?

989
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:33,714
- Did you hear?
- No, not at all.

990
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,103
Great. Whenever he feels
he stops hearing things.

991
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:42,099
What art is done on human
body that has 6 alphabets?

992
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:44,927
Art on body that has 6 alphabets.

993
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:47,418
- Tattoo.
- Okay, tattoo.

994
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:48,979
The art reminds me of heart.

995
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:52,598
- Let me eat my medicine? - Siddhu
does not know this. Dumb fellow.

996
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:54,820
Where is water?

997
01:08:28,115 --> 01:08:30,028
Raju, Raju..

998
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,312
Hey..

999
01:09:41,273 --> 01:09:43,738
'Doctor had asked me to laugh.'

1000
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:17,486
Raju..he cannot hear
so that means he is safe.

1001
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:09,267
On hearing Krishna's
flute Gopis used to come..

1002
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:10,975
..and on hearing your
flute the witch ran away.

1003
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:14,125
Great. Keep playing.
With flute do away with their peace.

1004
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,960
Babu, are you playing the drum?

1005
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:49,099
Fool..

1006
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:57,915
Hey, can't you help a
person who has fallen down?

1007
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,986
Hasn't your mother taught you manners?

1008
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,438
You are useless as a ghost.

1009
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:04,315
- Did you find a ghost to do dram?
- You get nothing after voting.

1010
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:06,785
Pizza reaches in half
an hour but not ambulance.

1011
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:08,059
What kind of a country is this?

1012
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:12,128
Leader sir, I want food to eat,
clothes to wear and house to live.

1013
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,315
Quiet, poor public of this country.

1014
01:12:14,395 --> 01:12:16,141
But you had promised to give me this.

1015
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:17,947
I make promises to break.

1016
01:12:18,027 --> 01:12:19,569
- I will die.
- I don't mind.

1017
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:21,342
Swear on your kids.

1018
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,230
Stay away from me. You are stinking.

1019
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,156
You are right.
I will go and have a bath.

1020
01:12:30,543 --> 01:12:35,939
By cheating you defeated Pandavas and
learnt cheating from uncle, Duryodhan.

1021
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:39,323
I will have to find some
other way to set you right.

1022
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:44,869
Why do you have pride on yourself?
You are the biggest hypocrite.

1023
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:47,957
When you have committed excess sins..

1024
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:52,432
..then you will come straight to me.

1025
01:12:52,512 --> 01:12:54,580
And then your sins
will come to an end.

1026
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,851
Be ready to get your clothes removed.

1027
01:12:56,931 --> 01:12:58,920
Hey, drama company..

1028
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,314
..you speak the dialogues of actor,
actress and villain yourself.

1029
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:02,909
Who are you?

1030
01:13:06,536 --> 01:13:09,467
I have become hit after being flop.
That means I am a Baazigar.

1031
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,896
Some have beautiful cheeks,
some have beautiful hair..

1032
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:13,287
..but I say that girls are not good.

1033
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:15,972
If alcohol is a bad thing
then let's drink and finish it.

1034
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:17,820
Whether it is Obama or someone else..

1035
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,863
..all has had tea herewith
milk of my buffalo..

1036
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:22,349
I will make you drink as well.

1037
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:26,711
Do you know once I was going
by helicopter from Patna to Mumbai..

1038
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:29,513
..to take plaid and
by mistake ate tobacco.

1039
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:31,628
After eating tobacco
I felt like spitting.

1040
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,880
I tried to open the
window but it did not open.

1041
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,598
Tell me what happened next?

1042
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:38,831
Will you see the entire
movie at one time?

1043
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:40,901
One plays a flute
and the ghost runs away.

1044
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,387
The second speaks dialogues
and the ghost escapes. Great!

1045
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:48,654
- Why are you laughing?
- Why are you laughing?

1046
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:50,862
I thought you called me.

1047
01:13:50,942 --> 01:13:53,311
- I want to go to the washroom.
- But why are you asking me for that?

1048
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:55,906
Will you hold till
I go to the washroom?

1049
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:57,077
- What should I hold?
- Flute..

1050
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,202
Okay, this flute. Go..

1051
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:02,145
It would be fun if we went together.

1052
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:03,814
Tell me one thing.
Are you going to washroom..

1053
01:14:03,894 --> 01:14:05,948
..or going to do painting on
the wall that I should come with you.

1054
01:14:06,028 --> 01:14:07,704
- Go alone. - Nowadays
it is not good to help others.

1055
01:14:07,784 --> 01:14:10,220
Go otherwise I will..go..

1056
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,880
As it is because of
fear y entire body is wet.

1057
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,666
Yes babu, one minute.
It is almost done.

1058
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:28,878
- Are you blind too?
How did you know?

1059
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,582
- Can you read minds?
- Because you did it in the pot.

1060
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:32,468
Nowadays has the commode
started coming in pot shape?

1061
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:34,407
Hey silent mode, this is not commode.

1062
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:37,093
- Sir, are you joking?
- Kidding..

1063
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,789
Okay flush now and get out.

1064
01:14:39,527 --> 01:14:41,244
Do flush..flush.. Can't you hear?

1065
01:14:41,553 --> 01:14:43,550
I feel shy in flushing
in front of others.

1066
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,256
I am going. Wash hands and then come..

1067
01:14:45,336 --> 01:14:46,501
Okay.

1068
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,205
Will you keep flushing
the entire night?

1069
01:14:51,285 --> 01:14:54,360
- Haven't you gone yet?
- Liar! Shall I kill you in the toilet?

1070
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,053
Sir, listen to me.
Actually there is one more problem.

1071
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:59,970
- Oh God..
- After sunset I cannot see.

1072
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,444
- Don't tell it anyone.
- Leave it. This is not my foot. Stop.

1073
01:15:02,743 --> 01:15:04,395
- You have night blindness.
- Yes sir.

1074
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:06,064
All your connections are loose.

1075
01:15:06,144 --> 01:15:08,737
Shall I ask you something?
Why do you play flute day and night?

1076
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:11,971
Sir, I play the flute
whenever I feel scared.

1077
01:15:12,051 --> 01:15:13,532
It is musically therapy.

1078
01:15:13,612 --> 01:15:14,910
Why did you play in the ATM?

1079
01:15:15,212 --> 01:15:17,147
- I was scared.
- And on the sofa.

1080
01:15:17,227 --> 01:15:18,451
I was scared that time also.

1081
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,940
Hey, with whom is that
drunkard playing kabbadi?

1082
01:15:24,904 --> 01:15:27,062
Hold it.
Play it whenever you are scared.

1083
01:15:27,142 --> 01:15:29,063
Your speaker and display
both are defected.

1084
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,217
You are caught today..stupid..

1085
01:15:36,471 --> 01:15:39,248
Chate, Chate..

1086
01:15:40,109 --> 01:15:42,642
Chate..where did he go
after drinking the entire bottle?

1087
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:52,602
He is sleeping here.

1088
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:57,728
This is my toy.

1089
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:09,609
This is my toy. Give it back to me.

1090
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:16,567
Are you deaf? Can't you hear?

1091
01:16:16,647 --> 01:16:18,315
Why are you banging?

1092
01:16:18,395 --> 01:16:21,529
- That toy is mine.
- How come the toy is yours?

1093
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:24,985
You've put chalk lime on
your eyes so will you cheat me also.

1094
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:27,454
I am telling you that is mine.

1095
01:16:27,534 --> 01:16:29,379
I am not going to give you.

1096
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:32,020
If you want that toy
then go and do case on me.

1097
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:36,515
But remember that if you lose the
case then I will take all your toys.

1098
01:16:36,595 --> 01:16:38,159
Get out. Go and do homework.

1099
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,983
You fool. How dare you bang
the bed from below and wake me up?

1100
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:43,333
You sleep.

1101
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:46,654
Listen, Chate..come down..

1102
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:49,208
Come down?
No I will not come. Get out.

1103
01:16:49,903 --> 01:16:50,890
We will open the bottle. Come on.

1104
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:53,483
I will come.

1105
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:54,547
The world is my home.

1106
01:16:54,627 --> 01:16:56,535
Earth is my mother and
the bus stand is where I stay.

1107
01:16:56,615 --> 01:16:58,182
I do business of snacks on platform..

1108
01:16:58,262 --> 01:16:59,315
- ..and I am a very useful person.
- Keep quiet! Keep quiet!

1109
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:00,730
But nowadays the business is slow.

1110
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:03,884
Brother Babu, brother Babu..

1111
01:17:03,964 --> 01:17:05,302
- Siddhu..
- Brother Siddhu..

1112
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:07,441
Call brother Tulsi and Babu.
It would be great fun.

1113
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:08,839
They are sitting
on your left and right.

1114
01:17:08,919 --> 01:17:09,882
- Tulsi..
- Don't scare me..

1115
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:10,988
Let's pay Antakshari.

1116
01:17:11,068 --> 01:17:13,471
Are you DJ of ghosts that
you will play remix for them?

1117
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:14,577
And the ghosts will dance.

1118
01:17:14,657 --> 01:17:18,068
Are you drunk?
This house is mine. No DJ here.

1119
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:20,236
This house is ours.

1120
01:17:20,316 --> 01:17:21,923
This house is ours.

1121
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:25,822
Shut up!
This house is not yours but mine.

1122
01:17:25,902 --> 01:17:28,713
It is of Tulsi Chate. Tulsi Chate.

1123
01:17:39,252 --> 01:17:41,394
This house is ours.

1124
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:50,534
Get out from here otherwise I will
thrash you hard and make you a ghost.

1125
01:17:54,396 --> 01:17:59,906
If you are not scared of dying
then we will scare you to death.

1126
01:18:00,772 --> 01:18:03,068
Hey, do you know that we ghosts..

1127
01:18:03,148 --> 01:18:06,288
..do not have one thing
and that is fear of death.

1128
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:10,141
We have friendship with fear..

1129
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:11,997
We are feeling very good..

1130
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:13,632
- ..seeing fear in your eyes.
- I want to go to washroom.

1131
01:18:13,712 --> 01:18:16,772
You want t go to
washroom because of fear.

1132
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:22,581
Don't spare them.

1133
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,900
Acting is fine but
where is voice modulation?

1134
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,822
In the scene of ghost you need
to have expression along with voice.

1135
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:29,623
This happens in films.

1136
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:34,059
In just two hours I will
tell you how to scare people.

1137
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:35,496
- Oscar shot..
- Okay..

1138
01:18:35,576 --> 01:18:38,407
- He has taught. - Grandfather,
I will teach him acting.

1139
01:18:38,487 --> 01:18:40,296
I do not do any commitment nowadays.

1140
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:41,203
Hey..

1141
01:18:44,035 --> 01:18:46,167
Hey stupid ghost,
how much over acting do you do?

1142
01:18:46,247 --> 01:18:47,565
I will teach you how to scare others.

1143
01:18:47,645 --> 01:18:49,129
So get ready to learn.

1144
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:51,860
One more thing.
You cannot learn acting by class.

1145
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,769
If you learn then bell will ring.

1146
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:56,188
Get out, get out.. You too..

1147
01:19:05,223 --> 01:19:06,598
Fear is gone..

1148
01:19:07,296 --> 01:19:10,358
Doremon, pokemon, Chhotta Bheem..

1149
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:20,016
Four ghosts came in my
dream and were scaring me.

1150
01:19:20,096 --> 01:19:21,892
Again acting started. Sleep quietly.

1151
01:19:22,347 --> 01:19:25,167
Partner, have the other two
gone in the reception of the ghosts?

1152
01:19:25,247 --> 01:19:27,901
Have you gone mad? Look there.

1153
01:19:28,536 --> 01:19:30,106
He troubled us at
night after drinking..

1154
01:19:30,186 --> 01:19:31,906
..and now he is troubling
our eyes by spreading fumes.

1155
01:19:31,986 --> 01:19:33,098
Look there.

1156
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,149
- Yes.
- How going on?

1157
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:39,297
Hello, what are you
doing in the morning?

1158
01:19:39,377 --> 01:19:40,061
You want to hit. Take it.

1159
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:41,950
Hey defected piece,
put the ear phone in your ear.

1160
01:19:43,873 --> 01:19:44,936
Now tell me what are you doing?

1161
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:46,117
I was trying to aim..

1162
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:47,289
Just like a government office..

1163
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:50,415
..the shutter of your
eyes close then this aiming..

1164
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:54,506
If I give you signal of money then
you will listen everything properly.

1165
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:56,414
Don't try to be smart.
Why do you remove the ear machine.

1166
01:19:56,494 --> 01:19:57,664
Take Ganges water..

1167
01:19:57,744 --> 01:19:59,332
He is priest in the
morning and drunk at night.

1168
01:20:02,605 --> 01:20:05,859
There is no ghost. Someone is at
the door. Keep this rocket in pocket.

1169
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:07,449
You are deaf. Put on your speaker.

1170
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,749
Hey stomach inside
and chest out. Come.

1171
01:20:10,846 --> 01:20:11,676
Better morning, sir..

1172
01:20:11,756 --> 01:20:13,001
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1173
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:14,382
- Is everything fine?
- Yes everything is fine.

1174
01:20:14,462 --> 01:20:15,744
We slept well at night.

1175
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:18,874
- Greetings, sir..
- Stand up.

1176
01:20:19,197 --> 01:20:21,783
We have proved that there is
no ghost here. We ate and slept well.

1177
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:24,913
- Even played antakshari at night.
- We slept peacefully.

1178
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:26,420
He slept so peacefully
that I forgot to get up.

1179
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:27,699
Sir..

1180
01:20:29,928 --> 01:20:31,978
- Hey, hello..why have
you come here again? - Sir..

1181
01:20:32,058 --> 01:20:33,020
- Sir, please..
- I had asked you not to come.

1182
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:33,979
- Sir, please listen to me.
- Out.

1183
01:20:34,059 --> 01:20:35,585
I have to link my Aadhaar
card to bank account.

1184
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:37,084
I shall ask my sister and then leave.

1185
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:38,868
- What is he saying?
- Sister, whose sister..

1186
01:20:38,948 --> 01:20:39,744
She is my sister.

1187
01:20:39,824 --> 01:20:41,521
Does anyone know her sister?
We don't know..

1188
01:20:41,601 --> 01:20:42,420
Give me your number.

1189
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,816
If we find your sister
then I shall give you miss call.

1190
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:45,427
Then you keep on playing rakhi-rakhi..

1191
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,984
- Now go away.
- Can't you understand?

1192
01:20:48,064 --> 01:20:49,208
Tell me in which language
should I explain you?

1193
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:51,047
There are ghost in the house.

1194
01:20:51,127 --> 01:20:52,629
Today is no moon night..

1195
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:56,262
..and this is the day when the
last desire of ghosts is fulfilled.

1196
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:00,014
Hey, if you wait here for a second
then I shall call the commissioner..

1197
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:01,475
- ..and put you behind bars.
- Sir, please don't call him.

1198
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:03,717
- Sir, please do not do this way.
Please forgive us. - No! No!

1199
01:21:03,797 --> 01:21:05,498
- Please forgive us.
-Tell him to go away quietly.

1200
01:21:05,578 --> 01:21:07,741
- Go from here. Come on full moon day.
- Please, explain them..

1201
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:11,262
Today is fast and I will
make you eat food eaten on fast.

1202
01:21:12,408 --> 01:21:14,973
Sir, now till next no moon
day they will not show their face.

1203
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:18,394
A buyer has been found.
He will reach here in 2-3 days.

1204
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:19,917
Till that time you will have
to stay here without any fear.

1205
01:21:19,997 --> 01:21:21,805
Scared? Why will we
be scared of anything?

1206
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:23,408
There are only 3-4 ghosts here.

1207
01:21:23,488 --> 01:21:25,766
About whose sister was
that tantric talking about?

1208
01:21:25,846 --> 01:21:27,606
Let's go inside and I will tell you.
Hey deaf, get inside..

1209
01:21:27,686 --> 01:21:29,399
Hey Pandit Chaurasia, get inside..

1210
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:30,413
Hello, Yadav sir..

1211
01:21:30,493 --> 01:21:34,672
Hey broker,
you are going to do deal worth crores.

1212
01:21:35,241 --> 01:21:37,981
Sir, we were really in need
of money so that is why we did this.

1213
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:41,564
Hey, I will do the deal of this house.

1214
01:21:41,644 --> 01:21:43,516
It is better you stay
away from that matter..

1215
01:21:43,596 --> 01:21:46,541
..otherwise I will thrash
you all and make you ghosts.

1216
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:49,219
- This is my last warning.
- Hello, hello..

1217
01:21:49,532 --> 01:21:51,462
- Hello!
- Hello..

1218
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:53,024
Hello..

1219
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:56,221
He has not disconnected
the phone but his life line.

1220
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,537
- Has the work been done or not?
- They do not believe on ghosts.

1221
01:22:04,617 --> 01:22:07,721
Fake tantric decided to scare
them but they did not get scared.

1222
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:09,203
I don't think this
plan is going to work.

1223
01:22:09,283 --> 01:22:12,101
If they stay there for two
more days then you will lose the game.

1224
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:15,144
- They are not going to agree easily.
- Then what should be done.

1225
01:22:15,224 --> 01:22:19,104
How will anyone believe
in ghosts without eyes?

1226
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,344
We will show them ghosts.

1227
01:22:20,424 --> 01:22:23,591
On seeing that they will get scared.
And they will escape because of fear.

1228
01:22:36,798 --> 01:22:42,275
I am missing grandmother a lot.
Will she come and meet us here?

1229
01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:44,908
She will surely come one day.

1230
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:48,629
Who knows in what condition
and where madam would be?

1231
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:50,735
Would she be missing us or not?

1232
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:53,507
What if she has also died like us?

1233
01:22:53,587 --> 01:22:55,940
My heart says that
she is absolutely fine.

1234
01:22:59,378 --> 01:23:01,445
She will surely come here finding us.

1235
01:23:01,525 --> 01:23:03,289
That is why we will wait for her.

1236
01:23:05,469 --> 01:23:08,042
Even if many years pass by.

1237
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,319
Why have you put red
lipstick and worn white sari?

1238
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:20,445
Ghosts have long
nails and shining eyes.

1239
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:22,603
If there is really a ghost
then it will not spare you.

1240
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:26,121
This is not first night
but a night to kill. Stupid.

1241
01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:29,433
Even a ghost would get scared
on seeing this black dress and face.

1242
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:31,329
You need glamour to scare. Come on.

1243
01:23:31,797 --> 01:23:33,395
You seem to be a witch
even without make up.

1244
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,672
If we have to stay in this house..

1245
01:23:34,752 --> 01:23:36,595
..then we will have to
throw those four people out.

1246
01:23:36,675 --> 01:23:40,124
There is victor ahead of fear.
I will go and scare them.

1247
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:46,101
We have to scare them to the core.

1248
01:23:46,263 --> 01:23:47,805
This is brother Yadav's order.

1249
01:23:47,885 --> 01:23:49,039
Don't teach me acting.

1250
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:51,727
Great elder brother,
what a performance?

1251
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,498
Has brother Yadav sent you here?

1252
01:24:55,252 --> 01:24:57,265
We will talk about payment later.

1253
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:02,332
Where does brother Yadav get
good actors from? Absolutely original.

1254
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:11,440
I got energy.

1255
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:14,076
What is common between
human beings and shoes?

1256
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:16,383
Soul..

1257
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:22,349
What is relationship
between Abhishek and Amitabh?

1258
01:25:22,429 --> 01:25:23,932
Brother, Siddhu!

1259
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,321
May I go to toilet?

1260
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:33,687
- Surely.
- This is called moral values.

1261
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:36,922
You just play the flute.

1262
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:41,669
I swear if Salman sees his acting..

1263
01:25:41,749 --> 01:25:46,280
..then he will surely give
him 2-3 scenes of his movie.

1264
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,669
- Brother Sidhu..
- I swear I have not done anything.

1265
01:25:48,749 --> 01:25:51,286
Don't try to be sweet. I know it.

1266
01:25:52,225 --> 01:25:53,662
After drinking he does double role.

1267
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:56,167
Brother Sidhu, why is fan
getting off again and again.

1268
01:25:56,247 --> 01:25:57,624
There is no electric supply.
It won't work.

1269
01:25:57,704 --> 01:25:59,943
- There is no electricity. Oh, God!
- How will electric supply affect you?

1270
01:26:00,023 --> 01:26:01,963
- Blind man..
- Right.

1271
01:26:02,043 --> 01:26:04,532
How will it matter to me?
My condition is also the same.

1272
01:26:04,612 --> 01:26:05,793
Brother Sidhu..

1273
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:06,915
Talk without touching me.

1274
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,045
Sleep with me at night,
brother Siddhu.

1275
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,434
How unhygienic?

1276
01:26:10,514 --> 01:26:12,581
Sometimes you want me t accompany
you to toilet or sleep with you.

1277
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,285
I can't sleep alone.

1278
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:15,543
First answer my riddle.

1279
01:26:15,623 --> 01:26:17,794
If I slap you hard
then what will tear first?

1280
01:26:17,874 --> 01:26:19,931
- How many alphabets are there?
- Two alphabets of Hindi.

1281
01:26:20,011 --> 01:26:20,992
I understood..

1282
01:26:24,903 --> 01:26:26,671
Strange people.

1283
01:26:26,919 --> 01:26:29,159
I am scared of them
more than from the ghosts.

1284
01:26:39,776 --> 01:26:41,947
Elder brother, you look superb.

1285
01:26:42,027 --> 01:26:45,499
What a great make up and get up.
You look like real ghost.

1286
01:26:45,579 --> 01:26:47,420
You should get extra payment.

1287
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:51,125
Hey, do not take my payment.

1288
01:26:55,061 --> 01:26:57,140
Can't you see and walk?

1289
01:26:57,887 --> 01:27:01,100
If you come in between
then I shall not spare you. You..

1290
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:07,014
I am your lover and
you are my beloved.

1291
01:27:07,094 --> 01:27:09,988
Why don't you agree?

1292
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:27,252
Do you have match box, idiot?

1293
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:30,573
If not match box then
even match stick would do.

1294
01:27:31,528 --> 01:27:33,311
Hey deaf, give me match stick.

1295
01:27:33,391 --> 01:27:36,636
- While buying cigarette why
don't you buy match box. - Shut up!

1296
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:40,811
I asked for match box and instead you
are giving me lecture. Bloody fool..

1297
01:27:41,914 --> 01:27:44,548
There is anger on your forehead.

1298
01:28:06,384 --> 01:28:07,676
For the first time I have seen a man..

1299
01:28:07,756 --> 01:28:09,486
..who takes out dirty sound
while seeing a good video.

1300
01:28:09,566 --> 01:28:11,270
I shall thrash him with slippers..

1301
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:32,301
Ghost competition.

1302
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:45,085
[English rap song]

1303
01:28:59,102 --> 01:29:02,408
[English rap song]

1304
01:29:02,668 --> 01:29:06,189
[English rap song]

1305
01:29:06,269 --> 01:29:09,773
[English rap song]

1306
01:29:09,853 --> 01:29:13,568
[English rap song]

1307
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:17,960
[English rap song]

1308
01:29:21,473 --> 01:29:23,940
Seeing her dirty act
even the witch got scared.

1309
01:30:07,794 --> 01:30:09,064
Where did I get trapped?

1310
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:17,393
Siddhu sir..

1311
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:20,527
Siddhu sir..

1312
01:30:33,785 --> 01:30:36,400
What is he doing here?

1313
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:06,017
You are great God..

1314
01:31:16,478 --> 01:31:18,114
Listen, there are real ghost here.

1315
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:20,555
Not just one but the
entire family is there.

1316
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:22,213
Why did you slap me?

1317
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:23,712
Enough..

1318
01:31:24,966 --> 01:31:26,248
I will not be able to do this.

1319
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:37,684
Hey, didn't you feel the pain?

1320
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,464
A man never feels the pain.

1321
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:41,794
- Hey you, give me a kiss.
- Very good.

1322
01:31:42,254 --> 01:31:45,766
One more character.
Go enjoy with the witch.

1323
01:32:09,629 --> 01:32:11,252
I will not be able to do this.

1324
01:32:17,342 --> 01:32:18,554
What happened?

1325
01:32:19,855 --> 01:32:22,738
- Ghosts are really there.
- Are you making fool of me?

1326
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:24,596
Why should I fool you?
There are really ghosts there.

1327
01:32:24,676 --> 01:32:26,665
Then how come those four
are still staying there?

1328
01:32:27,017 --> 01:32:29,232
Those four are not human beings
but seems to be worse than ghosts.

1329
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,147
- They are not going to get scared.
- Get lost.

1330
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:32,320
Okay..

1331
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,254
- Hey, keep the bottle.
- Poor fellow..

1332
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:38,550
Yadav, these men are of no use.

1333
01:32:38,793 --> 01:32:40,647
- We will have to do
something on our own. - Okay.

1334
01:32:41,114 --> 01:32:45,259
God made you human being but
forgot to make lines on your hand.

1335
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,530
One minute..

1336
01:32:49,887 --> 01:32:52,041
- Hello..
- Mother is missing you..

1337
01:32:52,272 --> 01:32:53,583
..and is being stubborn to meet you.

1338
01:32:53,663 --> 01:32:55,620
Tell her that I will
return in two days.

1339
01:32:55,884 --> 01:32:58,074
- If there is something urgent
then call me. - Okay brother.

1340
01:32:58,154 --> 01:33:00,016
Even then I shall
message you my address.

1341
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:01,155
Okay.

1342
01:33:01,235 --> 01:33:03,647
Is my son okay?

1343
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:05,908
Take care of mother.

1344
01:33:08,025 --> 01:33:12,292
Hey partner,
are you a cool or an emotional person?

1345
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:15,905
You can fight with
fear but not with emotions.

1346
01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:18,051
Hey partner, what is the
difference between the two?

1347
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:20,512
- In pain only tears are shed..
- And in fear..

1348
01:33:20,592 --> 01:33:22,143
- Your pant also becomes wet.
- Really..

1349
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:24,364
- Brother Siddhu, brother Siddhu..
- I think even he has become wet.

1350
01:33:24,444 --> 01:33:26,712
I am not able to talk
to my wife on phone.

1351
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:27,914
She must be sitting
in the beauty parlor.

1352
01:33:27,994 --> 01:33:30,058
- She is already beautiful.
- Keep quiet. You speak.

1353
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:32,742
You are very well aware that
my son is going to undergo a surgery.

1354
01:33:32,822 --> 01:33:35,015
- So I thought of going and meet him.
- Okay, okay.

1355
01:33:35,095 --> 01:33:37,177
- Go and meet him.
- Okay.

1356
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:39,694
- Don't sit to drink on the way.
- No.

1357
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:43,719
Eat.

1358
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:47,781
- I will get more for you.
- So you have come to show false love.

1359
01:33:49,267 --> 01:33:50,894
You must want money for drinking.

1360
01:33:50,974 --> 01:33:54,166
Take this money and
give it to that rich fellow.

1361
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:56,829
- I have changed the brand.
- Then drink local.

1362
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:59,791
Believe me that in two days
I will get money for the operation.

1363
01:33:59,871 --> 01:34:03,702
I have changed. I swear
that I will take care of everyone.

1364
01:34:03,782 --> 01:34:05,383
I know how big a rascal you are.

1365
01:34:05,463 --> 01:34:07,929
As soon as money comes in
your hand you will start drinking.

1366
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:10,037
As it is I am finding
a second husband online

1367
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:12,275
Just have faith on
me for the last time.

1368
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,613
I have really changed.

1369
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:18,572
I swear upon my son. Have faith on me.

1370
01:34:25,338 --> 01:34:27,414
How will there be
entertainment in the night?

1371
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:29,046
Why did it stop working?

1372
01:34:29,126 --> 01:34:31,225
This is entertainment's package.

1373
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:33,549
This is not the way to drink.
Drink in the glas.

1374
01:34:34,147 --> 01:34:36,036
Chate, come..

1375
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:39,489
There is good news for all.
Our efforts have borne fruit.

1376
01:34:39,569 --> 01:34:41,428
From tomorrow we will
leave this haunted house.

1377
01:34:41,508 --> 01:34:42,778
Owner called and said..

1378
01:34:42,858 --> 01:34:45,255
..that agreement has been done with
the builder and he will buy this house.

1379
01:34:45,335 --> 01:34:47,040
He will demolish
this and make multiplex.

1380
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,044
- Great..
- Congratulations.

1381
01:34:48,124 --> 01:34:51,744
- Thank you..
- Congratulations..

1382
01:34:51,824 --> 01:34:53,421
We shall come here to see the movie.

1383
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:54,864
Hey, everyone is going
to become a millionaire.

1384
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:55,987
Why are you sitting so sad?

1385
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:57,764
Eat these snacks.

1386
01:34:58,537 --> 01:35:01,921
- Congratulations.
- No one is here so let's enjoy.

1387
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:04,875
- Today we will drink unlimited.
- Drink it.

1388
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:06,506
- I will not drink.
- Why?

1389
01:35:06,586 --> 01:35:08,387
Because it is still not 9. Today there
is no time to start. Come on drink.

1390
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:09,824
I have sworn upon
that I will leave this.

1391
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:11,575
- You swore upon this Raju..
- Don't joke at this time..

1392
01:35:11,775 --> 01:35:13,281
- I have sworn upon..
- You swore on this Filmy..

1393
01:35:13,361 --> 01:35:14,647
Not of him but of my son.

1394
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:16,718
That is not valid now. Drink now.

1395
01:35:16,798 --> 01:35:19,785
Even if I die but I swear
upon my son that I will not drink.

1396
01:35:19,865 --> 01:35:22,409
Drink it for the last time
with us then leave it from tomorrow.

1397
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:24,277
Why are you forcing him
if he does not want to drink?

1398
01:35:24,357 --> 01:35:25,987
Whether he has sworn
up on his son or anyone else..

1399
01:35:26,067 --> 01:35:27,108
Come on you pour it for me..

1400
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,913
- Stop doing acting..
- One minute.

1401
01:35:28,993 --> 01:35:31,043
It is an emergency.
I shall go to the washroom.

1402
01:35:31,123 --> 01:35:32,649
- Where will you do it?
- I will do it at the right place.

1403
01:35:32,729 --> 01:35:34,517
- Don't worry.
- Ask him to hold and do it..

1404
01:35:34,597 --> 01:35:35,514
..otherwise the ghost
will catch hold of him.

1405
01:35:35,594 --> 01:35:38,835
Not this side but go that side. Go.

1406
01:35:42,758 --> 01:35:46,300
Where ahs the toilet gone?
It should be here.

1407
01:35:47,536 --> 01:35:49,831
1, 2, 3, 4..

1408
01:35:50,799 --> 01:35:51,865
I have reached..

1409
01:35:58,266 --> 01:35:59,783
I will not drink.

1410
01:36:00,623 --> 01:36:02,632
I don't have lots with me.
I just have a bottle.

1411
01:36:03,608 --> 01:36:10,175
Chate, swear upon all the drunkards
and the ingredients of this bottle..

1412
01:36:10,255 --> 01:36:11,574
Drink it..

1413
01:36:20,126 --> 01:36:23,167
The drunkard is not ready to drink and
Babu's mobile is not ready to start.

1414
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:25,968
If today by chance the ghost comes
then the entire plan will be spoilt.

1415
01:36:26,887 --> 01:36:28,966
Hey over actor,
one last bottle remains.

1416
01:36:29,046 --> 01:36:30,528
- It's the last one.
- Babu, come here..

1417
01:36:30,608 --> 01:36:31,595
Coming.

1418
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,305
Is he going to hang himself?

1419
01:36:34,385 --> 01:36:36,606
I'll can't control myself after 9 pm.

1420
01:36:36,686 --> 01:36:39,798
Even if I beg do not open me.
Tie me with the chair..

1421
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:41,853
Tie me tightly with the chair.

1422
01:36:41,933 --> 01:36:44,079
Even if God comes then
also do not let him open me.

1423
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,538
I swear upon friendship
that I will not open the rope.

1424
01:36:46,618 --> 01:36:47,851
- Babu..
- Tell me.

1425
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:49,276
Even if there is storm..

1426
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:52,692
- ..or bad weather conditions.. or
God comes.. - I won't open it. Never.

1427
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:55,354
- That is why I was making you
all drink. - ..do not open me.

1428
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:58,988
Even if you have to go to
washroom this rope will not open.

1429
01:36:59,068 --> 01:37:00,549
- Understood.
- Yes, I understood.

1430
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:03,766
- Hey, don't tie him.
- Spot boy, get some tea.

1431
01:37:10,577 --> 01:37:12,344
Babu, open the rope.

1432
01:37:12,424 --> 01:37:14,476
Without alcohol I have
become a thirsty crow.

1433
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:16,936
My tongue is also getting dry.
Open me..

1434
01:37:17,228 --> 01:37:19,586
Why did I ask you to tie?
Open the rope quickly.

1435
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:21,752
Please. Swear upon the alcohol,
open it..

1436
01:37:21,832 --> 01:37:23,432
Don't take tension.

1437
01:37:23,512 --> 01:37:26,434
I will show you acting and then
you will not pay attention to alcohol.

1438
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:29,721
Two ghosts used to stay in a mansion.

1439
01:37:30,014 --> 01:37:33,095
One was tall like Amitabh
and the other was fat like Babita.

1440
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:37,594
Hey, there are really
ghosts behind you.

1441
01:37:37,674 --> 01:37:39,062
Turn around and see..

1442
01:37:39,142 --> 01:37:40,762
Open the rope otherwise
I will not be able to escape.

1443
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:42,052
Oh, God save me.

1444
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:45,375
You are saying there is
ghosts around..where are they..

1445
01:37:45,455 --> 01:37:46,810
You open the rope. I'll show you.

1446
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,656
- Open it.
- Stop it.

1447
01:37:48,766 --> 01:37:51,728
Crime branch of 50 countries is
finding me. I am such a big criminal.

1448
01:37:52,045 --> 01:37:57,462
Hey, even a blind cannot look
at me and no one can dare to face me.

1449
01:37:57,542 --> 01:38:01,092
I have body of lion,
skin of deer and swiftness of Cheetah.

1450
01:38:01,172 --> 01:38:03,497
If you have courage then
come and do Kabaddi with me.

1451
01:38:07,278 --> 01:38:10,064
Oh, God! Save me.

1452
01:38:11,723 --> 01:38:14,628
Hey swear upon the stars
and superstar. Open the rope.

1453
01:38:14,966 --> 01:38:17,129
I will show you the ghosts.
There is ghost here.

1454
01:38:17,209 --> 01:38:18,744
Brother Sidhu, come here. Open it.

1455
01:38:18,824 --> 01:38:21,622
There is no ghost. You are in your
senses so that is why you feel so.

1456
01:38:21,702 --> 01:38:22,688
Babu..

1457
01:38:24,251 --> 01:38:27,303
Brother, I was just doing acting
then how did the chair come forward.

1458
01:38:27,383 --> 01:38:28,915
- That is not the case..
- Then there is some other case.

1459
01:38:28,995 --> 01:38:29,875
Nothing of that sort too.

1460
01:38:29,955 --> 01:38:31,638
Stop your argument and open my rope.

1461
01:38:31,718 --> 01:38:32,800
One minute. Keep your mouth shut.

1462
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,992
Look, let me show you.

1463
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:36,533
I hit you on your thigh.
Did the chair come forward? No.

1464
01:38:36,613 --> 01:38:37,958
- Hit on your thigh..
- On my thigh..

1465
01:38:38,038 --> 01:38:38,798
Yes.

1466
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:44,156
Brother Siddhu,
I request you to bring me down.

1467
01:38:44,236 --> 01:38:46,238
I am hanging upside down.

1468
01:38:46,318 --> 01:38:47,507
I told you that there
is ghost in this house.

1469
01:38:47,587 --> 01:38:48,696
Hold on. I will do something.

1470
01:38:48,776 --> 01:38:51,158
You will die at my hands.

1471
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:51,994
I will bring you down..

1472
01:38:52,074 --> 01:38:56,087
- Get me down otherwise
I will die here. - Hold on.

1473
01:38:57,533 --> 01:38:59,308
Babu, come into senses..babu..

1474
01:38:59,388 --> 01:39:01,398
I am a priest..help me..

1475
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:03,536
Babu, you will break your head..wait..

1476
01:39:03,616 --> 01:39:05,824
- Wait..
- Brother Siddhu, come soon..

1477
01:39:06,098 --> 01:39:07,243
- Stop it.
- Get me down.

1478
01:39:07,323 --> 01:39:08,889
I have a wife and family..

1479
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:11,386
Stay there and I will get a ladder.

1480
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:16,766
Open, please open..open,
exit..something..

1481
01:39:17,574 --> 01:39:19,543
The door is not opening. Raju..

1482
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,616
What are you looking at? You..

1483
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,743
Raju..

1484
01:39:29,092 --> 01:39:30,430
Raju..

1485
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:42,261
Raju, come here. First get a ladder.

1486
01:39:42,754 --> 01:39:45,476
Come here quickly and save me.

1487
01:39:45,556 --> 01:39:47,252
Save me. I am a priest..

1488
01:39:47,332 --> 01:39:48,780
You will be blessed
if you save the priest.

1489
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:52,669
Help, help me..I am asking
you to save me and you are lying down.

1490
01:39:52,749 --> 01:39:53,701
- Save me.
- Come.

1491
01:39:53,781 --> 01:39:55,179
I will do all religious
offerings in the house..

1492
01:39:55,259 --> 01:39:56,991
- ..and will not take money..
- Come.

1493
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,695
- Come..
- I will have to pray.

1494
01:39:59,775 --> 01:40:01,260
First get this aside..

1495
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:06,333
If I die then my wife and
children will go with someone else.

1496
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:09,934
Down..

1497
01:40:11,752 --> 01:40:13,653
- Down..
- No, no..

1498
01:40:14,185 --> 01:40:16,402
Siddhu, get up.

1499
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:19,589
Help my wife and children
from becoming orphan.

1500
01:40:20,484 --> 01:40:22,370
Brother Siddhu, come quickly..

1501
01:40:22,799 --> 01:40:24,130
Save me.

1502
01:40:54,626 --> 01:40:55,984
Son..

1503
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:00,297
Save me..

1504
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:04,848
Hey, I am saved. I came down.

1505
01:41:06,633 --> 01:41:07,763
Slowly, slowly..

1506
01:41:07,843 --> 01:41:09,379
- I am coming. Coming.
- Open it.

1507
01:41:11,284 --> 01:41:12,434
Breathe..

1508
01:41:13,559 --> 01:41:15,492
I was almost dead.

1509
01:41:17,326 --> 01:41:18,265
Why did you get mother here?

1510
01:41:18,345 --> 01:41:19,454
She wanted to meet you.

1511
01:41:19,534 --> 01:41:20,842
- Go back.
- I had told you earlier.

1512
01:41:20,922 --> 01:41:22,502
No one believed me
that there is ghost here.

1513
01:41:22,582 --> 01:41:24,325
There is something here.
Let's all run away.

1514
01:41:24,909 --> 01:41:26,705
- How did the door close?
- Grandmother..

1515
01:41:26,785 --> 01:41:27,678
Open the door..

1516
01:41:29,143 --> 01:41:30,594
Mother, what happened?

1517
01:41:30,926 --> 01:41:32,673
Mother, do not go that side.

1518
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:34,633
Mother, there is ghosts trap.

1519
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:39,290
Mother, listen to me.

1520
01:41:40,151 --> 01:41:43,103
Mother, will you listen or not?

1521
01:41:43,947 --> 01:41:44,980
Grandmother..

1522
01:41:48,388 --> 01:41:49,421
What is this, mother?

1523
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:51,354
Why is she calling you grandmother?

1524
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:52,915
What kind of relationship is this?

1525
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,183
She is my wife.

1526
01:41:56,746 --> 01:41:58,231
This is her house.

1527
01:41:58,557 --> 01:42:02,687
Since 2004 we were waiting for her.

1528
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:10,368
Take the offering son.

1529
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:13,386
Sweet..give..

1530
01:42:19,923 --> 01:42:23,316
Father, father I have got
a good business offer in Malaysia.

1531
01:42:23,396 --> 01:42:25,764
Great opportunity. I will
have to stay there for six months.

1532
01:42:26,684 --> 01:42:27,996
Mother, make father understand.

1533
01:42:28,848 --> 01:42:29,918
Let him go.

1534
01:42:29,998 --> 01:42:31,984
He is saying that he
will come back in six months.

1535
01:42:32,064 --> 01:42:33,916
- Father..
- Okay, go..

1536
01:42:33,996 --> 01:42:35,976
Thank you, Thank you father.

1537
01:42:36,736 --> 01:42:38,685
- Bye mother.
- Take care of yourself, son.

1538
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:41,183
- Eat food at proper time.
- Okay mother.

1539
01:42:41,263 --> 01:42:42,963
You too take care of father.

1540
01:42:43,043 --> 01:42:44,803
- Bye.
- Bye, son.

1541
01:42:47,435 --> 01:42:49,385
Son ram, is everything fine?

1542
01:42:49,986 --> 01:42:52,327
Here, drink milk.

1543
01:42:53,652 --> 01:42:54,658
Give.

1544
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:58,750
Even today we could
not get through Ram's phone.

1545
01:43:01,247 --> 01:43:03,874
Take this and go and make
your grandfather eat this.

1546
01:43:06,464 --> 01:43:07,457
Sweet.

1547
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:13,342
Your grandfather should
not be eating sweet.

1548
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,162
Ishka..

1549
01:43:23,372 --> 01:43:26,029
From today we will
also sit down and eat food.

1550
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:32,876
Not this way but keep
the finger like this.

1551
01:43:32,956 --> 01:43:34,155
Understood.

1552
01:43:39,365 --> 01:43:40,872
Very good..

1553
01:43:47,996 --> 01:43:50,382
Very good..great..

1554
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:56,589
Very nice..

1555
01:43:57,283 --> 01:43:58,174
Take this bangle.

1556
01:43:58,254 --> 01:44:00,549
- No, I don't want.
- Wear it.

1557
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,961
- Give me blessings.
- Have a long life.

1558
01:44:11,351 --> 01:44:13,586
From today you are
my younger daughter.

1559
01:44:14,485 --> 01:44:16,597
There is someone else with me.

1560
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:19,194
There is no need to bring him.

1561
01:44:19,484 --> 01:44:21,078
- Come inside..
- Listen to me..

1562
01:44:21,158 --> 01:44:23,167
- Even you all come. Come on.
- Where are you doing?

1563
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:25,106
Will you take pickle?

1564
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,191
- Son Ram, so you have come.
- Mother.

1565
01:44:30,996 --> 01:44:33,745
I used to tell her that
one day he would surely come.

1566
01:44:33,825 --> 01:44:34,945
- Come.
- Come, come inside.

1567
01:44:35,237 --> 01:44:38,180
Father, I have suffered
huge loss there.

1568
01:44:38,373 --> 01:44:44,905
If I do not repay it then
reputation will be at stake.

1569
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,948
If you wish then you can
take me out from this problem.

1570
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:51,377
I do not have so much money.

1571
01:44:52,318 --> 01:44:56,063
If you do not have
cash then sell this house.

1572
01:44:56,143 --> 01:44:58,418
Son, I was thinking that you have..

1573
01:44:58,498 --> 01:45:00,833
..come here from Malaysia
to meet your mother.

1574
01:45:01,684 --> 01:45:04,356
After selling the house you
all can come with me to Malaysia.

1575
01:45:04,436 --> 01:45:05,568
There are all the luxuries there.

1576
01:45:05,648 --> 01:45:08,347
But we have adopted these children.

1577
01:45:08,519 --> 01:45:12,043
How can we leave them
and come to Malaysia?

1578
01:45:12,391 --> 01:45:14,371
You are not worried
about your real son..

1579
01:45:14,451 --> 01:45:16,147
..and now these orphans
are dearer to you.

1580
01:45:17,622 --> 01:45:18,782
What did you say? Orphan?

1581
01:45:18,862 --> 01:45:22,089
What are you saying?

1582
01:45:22,332 --> 01:45:23,787
They are not orphans.

1583
01:45:23,867 --> 01:45:26,384
They have loved us
more than our real child.

1584
01:45:26,464 --> 01:45:28,358
In fact you made
us orphan and went away.

1585
01:45:29,959 --> 01:45:31,342
- Father, I did not mean that..
- No.

1586
01:45:32,271 --> 01:45:35,799
This is my real family.

1587
01:45:35,968 --> 01:45:40,230
I shall transfer my property
in the name of these orphans.

1588
01:45:40,386 --> 01:45:43,765
So that tomorrow no
one can call them orphan.

1589
01:45:44,355 --> 01:45:46,579
- Son Ram..
- Why are you stopping him?

1590
01:45:46,659 --> 01:45:50,860
Being alive he threw
us as orphans from his life.

1591
01:45:52,434 --> 01:45:54,318
- Ram..
- Let him go.

1592
01:45:55,252 --> 01:46:01,019
Even you go with him if you
still have motherly love for him.

1593
01:46:01,985 --> 01:46:04,247
Go. Go away from here.

1594
01:46:08,646 --> 01:46:13,939
After that day we did not know
what happened and how did we die.

1595
01:46:20,836 --> 01:46:22,737
Ram killed you all.

1596
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,434
What?

1597
01:46:25,514 --> 01:46:26,388
Yes.

1598
01:46:28,098 --> 01:46:29,722
Ram killed you all.

1599
01:46:30,089 --> 01:46:32,009
Ram killed you all.

1600
01:46:44,676 --> 01:46:47,461
An orphan would snatch
away my home from me.

1601
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:48,811
Die..

1602
01:46:52,436 --> 01:46:55,354
Come, I will perform
your last rites too.

1603
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:04,780
'What are you doing?
He is your father.'

1604
01:47:07,598 --> 01:47:09,604
'But then how will
you get this house.'

1605
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:13,602
'Rest in peace.'

1606
01:47:31,999 --> 01:47:36,872
Mother, mother..

1607
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:19,492
You must have been shocked
seeing your son killing your family.

1608
01:48:19,572 --> 01:48:23,872
What curse can be more
than this for a mother?

1609
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,602
God should never give
a son like this to anyone.

1610
01:48:31,157 --> 01:48:33,430
It is better not to have a child
rather than having one like this.

1611
01:48:35,016 --> 01:48:37,307
We were thinking that
we four are in trouble..

1612
01:48:37,826 --> 01:48:40,180
..but these ghosts are
in more trouble than us.

1613
01:48:40,636 --> 01:48:42,238
You are right.

1614
01:48:42,754 --> 01:48:44,884
We are in trouble
but at least are alive.

1615
01:48:45,926 --> 01:48:48,736
We will have to do something
to get these unfortunate souls.

1616
01:48:48,948 --> 01:48:51,123
- And they will get liberation
by justice. - You are right.

1617
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:00,881
- Hello, Mr. Ram..
- Tell me Siddhu..

1618
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:02,588
Your mother has come
back from Uttarakhand.

1619
01:49:02,668 --> 01:49:04,282
- Really?
- Come as soon as possible.

1620
01:49:04,362 --> 01:49:05,610
- I'll be there in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

1621
01:49:14,988 --> 01:49:16,949
I was going through pending cases..

1622
01:49:17,029 --> 01:49:19,135
..then I came across
a file of missing complaint.

1623
01:49:19,534 --> 01:49:23,419
On enquiring we came to know
that this woman lives with Siddhu.

1624
01:49:23,868 --> 01:49:27,891
He found her near his house.
That woman never went to Uttarakhand.

1625
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:31,545
Having a real son someone else
gave him the position of a mother.

1626
01:49:31,701 --> 01:49:33,299
Do you know who the real son is?

1627
01:49:33,844 --> 01:49:37,611
I may not be as rascal
as you but I am no less.

1628
01:49:37,856 --> 01:49:39,734
Listen, I shall give you a suggestion.

1629
01:49:39,814 --> 01:49:42,093
Take this one rupee coin,
transfer the house in our name..

1630
01:49:42,173 --> 01:49:44,103
..and go to Malaysia
by the first flight.

1631
01:50:18,096 --> 01:50:21,482
Hey Mr. Yadav.
How can you enter like this?

1632
01:50:21,562 --> 01:50:23,964
- This is cheating.
- Tell me where is his mother?

1633
01:50:24,044 --> 01:50:26,272
- Come in the corner.
- Go or I'll kill him.

1634
01:50:27,293 --> 01:50:28,721
Tell me where is Ram's mother?

1635
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:30,638
Tell me.

1636
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:35,186
- Where is she?
- Brother Yadav, one minute.

1637
01:50:35,419 --> 01:50:36,884
Siddhu, thank you.

1638
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:38,215
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

1639
01:50:38,295 --> 01:50:40,495
You gave very good news.
Tell me where is my mother?

1640
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:43,074
Mother, mother..

1641
01:50:46,932 --> 01:50:48,032
Mother, how are you?

1642
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:50,087
I am happy to see you alive.

1643
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:52,673
Was the journey good? Sit down.
Why are you standing? Come. Sit down.

1644
01:50:53,108 --> 01:50:53,958
Come.

1645
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,266
Come..sit down.

1646
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,945
Where is father?

1647
01:51:02,086 --> 01:51:03,667
He must be taking resting upstairs.

1648
01:51:04,107 --> 01:51:05,054
What is this mother?

1649
01:51:05,134 --> 01:51:06,773
You left for pilgrimage
without telling me.

1650
01:51:06,853 --> 01:51:10,171
I found you everywhere
from hospital to old age home.

1651
01:51:10,368 --> 01:51:11,537
Now you are found.

1652
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,243
I felt very happy to see you.

1653
01:51:17,308 --> 01:51:19,451
Wait for a minute.
I will just be back.

1654
01:51:27,259 --> 01:51:31,883
Hey, I killed my father for this..

1655
01:51:32,738 --> 01:51:34,515
..and this secret was revealed to you.

1656
01:51:34,892 --> 01:51:36,656
So you should also be killed.

1657
01:51:36,938 --> 01:51:38,192
Sir, please..

1658
01:51:39,229 --> 01:51:40,230
Sir..

1659
01:51:40,665 --> 01:51:45,120
Yadav, along with mother
send them to heaven as well.

1660
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,810
- No, you cannot do this.
- Please don't kill us.

1661
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:48,271
I don't want to die.

1662
01:51:48,351 --> 01:51:49,841
Don't kill us. No.

1663
01:51:49,921 --> 01:51:51,435
No! I don't want to die.

1664
01:51:51,515 --> 01:51:53,858
Hey, hey..

1665
01:52:53,158 --> 01:52:56,318
Thank you, God. We are saved.

1666
01:53:32,173 --> 01:53:34,965
'You made us orphans.'

1667
01:53:40,949 --> 01:53:44,552
'Ram, you killed everybody.
Ram, you killed everybody.'

1668
01:54:47,474 --> 01:54:48,394
Ram.

1669
01:55:17,459 --> 01:55:20,079
What has happened?

1670
01:55:26,526 --> 01:55:27,636
- What is this?
- Come.

1671
01:55:27,716 --> 01:55:29,664
- Footage king, come..
- Friends, wait..

1672
01:55:29,744 --> 01:55:30,814
What happened?

1673
01:55:33,303 --> 01:55:34,956
Great! This is magic.

1674
01:55:35,036 --> 01:55:36,674
Oh, God!

1675
01:55:51,921 --> 01:55:53,504
Thank you..
