Is this Mrs.Rathi of famous film 'Rathinirvedham' 7

2
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,706
Don't you think its Mrs. Kareena Kapoor 7

3
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,710
No. MrsJayabharathi is still our dream girl.

4
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,068

5
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,708

It's you Mrs.Rathi

7
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,466
Come on; Get me a cup of tea fast
instead of flirting in the morning

8
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,499
I need to go to toilet.

9
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,672
Oh

10
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,707

11
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,639
You are really unromantic.

12
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,710
Hello madam...Haven't you seen yesterday,
how romantic I'm?

13
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:49,467
It's only 6.30 am now.
If you're willing still there is a scope for another 20-20.

14
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,676
Have a nice bath and go for you
job before your life gets rotten

15
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:13,643
How many days before I entrusted you my
passport to renew? Do it at least today.

16
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,466
Mumthaz has delivered again.

19
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,466
How many times has she delivered?

20
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:30,499
Hey...

21
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,643
Either you ask her to stop this or ask her
husband not to come from gulf for leave.

22
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,466
Some people has taken it as a profession

23
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,673
And we people loose money.

24
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,639
Oh.. its time for live.

25
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,432

Can you tell me some wordings for valentine's day.

28
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,432
It's you who only told that I'm unromantic.

29
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:00,107
So, I don't think it would be proper I say.

30
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:00,640
Oh.

00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,438

We need all the youth to participate in it.

43
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,440
It must be our aim. Understand.

44
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,473

What did you tell her 7

51
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,439
She didn't see me.

52
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,473
She would only pretend as if she hasn't
seen you even if she saw you also.

53
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:18,409
Of course.
The most envied lovers of college days.

54
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:24,410
She left on the last day telling that she
would present your case before her parents.

55
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,440
Finally you received her Wedding Card

56
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,444
The word 'FIRST is a different experience in life

57
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,372
Some enjoy it.

58
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,410
There will be a face you love when you're in college.

59
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:09,377
There can be only one face like that even
inspite of several faces we see and forget.

60
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,410
I can't never forget her and my first love.

61
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,166
Hey dude...tell me the truth.

62
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,340
Do you want her to get attracted to you 7

63
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,306
Sure. But she doesn't even look at me.

64
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,374
If you want so, get in front of her and
let her know that you are an aspirant

65
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:00,342
Nothing would work out if you peep like this.

66
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,305
Can you give me an idea?

67
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,273
Wasn't it an idea what I told you?

68
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,339
That's all.

69
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,340
Be brave. Move ahead.

70
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,238

71
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,305
Why doesn't he speak anything 7

72
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,240
Will she give him alms thinking he is dumb 7

73
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:42,477

74
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,099

She was sitting here tired of
waiting bus when I came here.

89
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,274
We should help old people however,
Its what my dad advises me.

90
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,066

91

I forgot to look at you when I peeped

113
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:43,437
Soul whispered to love when I saw you

114
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:47,637
you are fading away now again.

115
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,905
There's one in home who eagerly waits to hear of us

116
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,576

117

India returns with no gold from the Olympics.

135

Can't I ever see India wins a
gold in Olympics before I die?

136
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,437
Even if we decide to buy and give
them some gold from the jewellery"

137
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,776
...the hike of gold price is so high

Then...

144
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,345
Why did you park your scooter here?

145
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:24,779
It's because I had an urgency.

146
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:28,438

147
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,870

00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:30,410
Usually husbands are reluctant
to attend the calls of wives.

159
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:34,872

Good morning Kochi... On this valentine's Day I wish".

206
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:05,514
"Valentine's day greetings to all lovers

207
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,970
There is no one who hasn't fall in love

208
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,743
To say the sweet feeling of the love

209
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:17,473
While sitting near without
uttering aword where had you flown

210
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,908
When the same wind touches me today

211
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,039
I see that old face again near to me

212
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,004
It's enough to stop here.

213
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,070
<i>Kimmy</i>

214
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,809
Can you spend just 10 minutes with me 7

215
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,513
Excuse me. We're conducting
a valentine's day programme.

216
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,746
If you are interested you can participate.

217
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:12,069
Io thanks.

218
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:13,341
It's okay.

219
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:22,572
Why did you come to our show room?

220
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,012
I had given the car for availing service

221
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:26,640
I came to buy that.

222
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,674
Family

223
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,599
He is..

224
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,433
\fishnu

225
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:37,678
I know; still I keep that card with me.

226
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,309
Very good together.

227
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,909
I've also married just before
one year. Aan its her name.

228
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:04,046
It's always lucky to fall in love and to
marry the same person whom we loved most.

229
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:10,306
I talked about you only first, When I
reached home after the last college day

230
00:33:10,434 --> 00:33:14,473
But you weren't there for me to show
my mother saying that this is my girl

231
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,905
I tried in your number for many days

232
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:29,386
When I received your wedding letter
only I got relief of all sadness.

233
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,810
<i>Do you hale me AM '2</i>

234
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:45,012
If I want I can just say something
like Our old heroes in Hindi films say.

235
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,947
But just leave all that.

236
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,371
Is that your husband?

237
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:06,610
Husband call while having capuchino with your ex-lover,
It's in like this situation any wife gets upset.

238
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,506
Hello Hai.

239
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:14,213

240
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:15,775
<i>'(ah Okay.</i>

241
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:23,409
You are tensed as if I'm your husband and he is your lover.

242
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,540
You can't change

243
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,214
Oh it's late

244
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,641

Let me go

246
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:54,613
You can either leave this in dust bin or you can
keep this for in remembrance of an old friend.

247
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,511
Bye

248
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,406
Do you know which is the most sweetest silence?

249
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,275
Io...

250
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:53,742
The noise produced when lips
are jointed together like this.

251
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,401
Are you drunk 7

252
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:56,375
Yes

253
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,175
It's only when you drink you speak like 'Padmarajani

254
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,436
or you naughty Jayakrishnan

255
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:05,279
Are you planning for something else 7

256
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,499
There was a good news

257
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,066
Do you know who won the best
employee's award of the year 7

258
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:15,636

259
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:21,446

award goes to Ann's husband

260
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:27,113

Albi; its me

263
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,373
Hai Ilimmy. How are you 7

264
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,879
I need to meet you urgently.

265
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,141
Where are you now 7

266
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,466
I'm in a Bus stop in Eroor

267
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:03,775
I'll come there.

268
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:23,939
You're late I thought ..you won't come

269
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,844
Sorry. Why do you want to meet me 7

270
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:30,081
I didn't drop the tissue on which
number of my old friend was written.

271
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,837
So I thought to call him for a help.

272
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,444
Any help 7

273
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,810
Hello do you get in 7

274
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,411
Some really cause trouble .

275
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:48,908
Why you are alone in this night ..\fishnu 7

276
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,346
I would have answered it if
you asked it before one hour.

277
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:57,843
But now it is an unknown topic.

278
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,742
Vishnu likes me a lot.

279
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,174
But there was another \fishnu
in him whom I didn't see first.

280
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,201
\fishnu

281
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:28,147
There is a good vehicle for sale. Audi A6

282
00:42:29,034 --> 00:42:30,240
It's a doctor's vehicle

283
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,203
He has driven it only for 8000 Km.

284
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,804
Do you want it 7

285
00:42:35,134 --> 00:42:36,010
Io man.

286
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:38,080
I don't like to even hear the word 'second hand'.

287
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,143
You know why?

288
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,143
I don't like to use anything
what others have used..

289
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:44,972
...As well I don't like anybody to use what I've used

290
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,372
Whether it is my car or my girl.

291
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:55,905
Hai Buddy come on say.

292
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,812
Wow..are you serious 7

293
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,903
So we celebrate today

294
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:02,839
I'll come soon.

295
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,110
What's the matter?

296
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,271
There is a very happy news

297
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,907
<i>Kimmy is pregnant.</i>

298
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:16,240
It's told that because of infertility problem.
You couldn't bear a child?

299
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,403
Now is she pregnant ?

300
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,304
It's miracle. God is grate.

301
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,668
Hello.

302
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:36,645
What happened 7

303
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,970
Did anything happen to your vehicle 7

304
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:39,078
Aye Sorry-

305
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,814
Eversince Vishnu was transformed
to another personality.

306
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:46,069
He started always doubting.

307
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:49,578
A man who lives in the web of
imaginary tales and thoughts.

308
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,810
Cigarette smell

309
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:10,877
<i>Kimmy Did any one come here today '2</i>

310
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,010
Io... Why did you ask so 7

311
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,842
Nothing.

312
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:30,676
Dear..

313
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:35,581
Sir has given instruction to the security
to watch whether some men visit here

314
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:38,805
He also gave money to Security
to hide this as a secrete.

315
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:46,645
But today

316
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:53,211
I'have had enough food.

317
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:54,837
Please brake the suspense.

318
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,174
Tell me why did you give me treat 7

319
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:58,008
I'll say . You just open that dash box.

320
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,174
There's a white cover in it. Take it.

321
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:02,239
What is it 7

322
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,308
We gave treat to everyone
when we married each other

323
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:25,139
I thought we should have
treat before we get separated.

324
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:27,974
Vishnu..let me explain.

325
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,513
I'm leaving for Banglore by 1030's ﬂight.

326
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:39,872
You can't have access to my
ﬂat, Bank, account, and car.

327
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,742
Wshnu...

328
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,605
\fishnu please...

329
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,138
Hello Albi its me..

330
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,145
I need to meet you urgently.

331
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,606
Now I feel that I shouldn't have met you again.

332
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:04,179
Vishnu and me became one just to get separated.

333
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,810
Shall we go for a walk 7

334
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,076
low... it still rains

335
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,010
Isn't it right time for a walk?

336
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,506
You can laugh. But don't laugh while you cry.

337
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:33,674
For it doesn't suit for your face.

338
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:10,769
At night...?

339
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,709
I was about to got mom's home.

340
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:17,382
But it's too far. My friend is living here.

341
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,638
I ow I can stay there.

342
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:28,380
Us'?

343
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:29,339
Yes.

344
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:33,477
Give me your bag.

345
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:41,578
Okay. Bye.

346
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,675
I'll come and drop you.
-N o. Thanks please.

347
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,805
It's okay. I'll come with you.
-No need.

348
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,004
Do what I say.

349
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,672
Please stop the car here.

350
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,674
House is locked.

351
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,304
Hello. Where are you 7

352
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,711
Okay. Right

353
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,841
She has gone to Guruvayoor for a marriage.

354
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,507
I should have called her before I come here.

355
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:43,610
Is there any hotel here to stay.

356
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:44,937
This is a rural area.

357
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,380
Here there is a home stay here.

358
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:48,643
It's enough.

359

It was something undesired
happened between us.

396
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,438
I had even forgot my commitment to Ann.

397
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:03,238
What ever it is .. Ilimmi it
should be within us alone.

398
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,075

01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,070

407
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,804
Haven't I told you that I'll be late.

01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:28,871
Someone has come here to see you.

01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,178

01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,504
I just bluffed Albi for a joke.

413
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,543
How do you do sir?

414
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:55,878
A murder case has been reported in the morning.

415
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,910
It's a lady.

416
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:58,741
She took room with her lover.

417
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,004
Lover left the place after murdering her.

418
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,769
This is why it is said men aren't trustworthy

419
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:06,911
Men are always bluffed by women.

420
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,877
If Thacholy chandu had an I phone Camera
Unniarcha would have been seen in youtube

421
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,114
My god.. My chicken curry...

424
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:27,112
I had some job at night

425
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,410
Nowadays you are having some night works.

426
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:34,635
When did you start lying?

427
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:41,943
Yesterday you parked your vehicle on the road.

428
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:47,643
In the morning it was not there right ?

429
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:48,745
Yes.

430
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,141
Both women and liquor consumed are equal.

431
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,210
Both will cause you vomit.

432
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:56,947
This is why I don't marry yet.

433
01:01:58,567 --> 01:02:02,105
I got your vehicle from a regular vehicle thief.

434
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:04,145
L'ven't registered the case yet.

435
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:06,614
You can get vehicle tomorrow.

436
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,607

437
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,602
Did you see that lady 7

438
01:02:12,034 --> 01:02:12,876
Which lady 7

439
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,409
The lady who was murdered in a hotel?

440
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:18,175
That hotel is not in my station limit.

441
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:19,877
Its forty kilometer far away.

442
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:22,713
So you need not interfere"

443
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:25,071
Can't say anything.

444
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:28,837
If this rascal lover is within this
limit I'll have to involve in the matter.

445
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,445
Bye. Take care.

446
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:20,876
Stop here.

447
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,476
Stop.

448
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:47,940
Come on go..go..go..

449
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,778
Good morning Albi

450
01:05:19,334 --> 01:05:21,314
There's courier which came yesterday.

451
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,240
Hello.

452
01:05:41,434 --> 01:05:45,405
Hello Albi. You may not be familiar with this voice.

453
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:51,445
But henceforth this will be your most familiar voice.

454
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:55,943
Because this will by your navigator hereafter.

455
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:01,871
Who are you? Are you bluffing me?

456
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,443
Yes. I'm going to bluff you.

457
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:06,877
Hereafter you will obey only what I say.

458
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:14,532
Don't get hot tempered.

459
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,876
Now you received a courier.

460
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,843
It's just before your table.

461
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,440
Yes. It's there...What so 7

462
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:23,873
And the twist is now; just open it.

463
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,871
Hello.

464
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:28,613
The real calculation is that for
every man there are two women.

465
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:31,844
Every man gets trapped in this calculation.

466
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:34,712
Do you think that there was no need of anything?

467
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,506
But its late now.

468
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,647
I called you at 10.30 am it was beginning of a game.

469
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:43,599

470
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,840

472
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:00,542

473
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:03,580

474
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:05,238
I'll call you later.

475
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:07,338
I'm little busy today.

476
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:17,705
Hello.

477
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,633

01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:23,205
So you wait for my call now.

479
01:09:23,467 --> 01:09:24,241
Who are you 7

480
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,147
I'm the seller of danger.

481
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:32,971
I don't have any relation with the murder of Ilimmy.

482
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:37,143
Promise. Its braking of promise.

483
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,449
Its all candles that are placed before the Lord.

484
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,036
You are my holy candle.

485
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,073
You are left only with the minutes of the game.

486
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,439
A courier containing a CD would reach
your home within fifteen minutes.

487
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:13,577
You'll get it if you reach before that.

488
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,366

Which one would you prefer me 7

506
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,505
Everything suits to you.

507
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,573
Don't ﬂatter me. Tell which one is better.

508
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:28,377
This one.

509
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,979

Yah. Come on quick. Don't we need to go?

511
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,109
Albi just two minutes ...you get ready fast.

512
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:46,106
Guys we should concentrate more
on our Permanent seevil model.

513
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,974
New commercials will arrive by next week.

514
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:53,310
We should concentrate on our
service too just like the sale.

515
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:57,177
We should treat our customers
who come for service.

516
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:19,404
Who is that.

517
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:21,003
Don't know it's an unknown number.

518
01:13:23,434 --> 01:13:24,310
Hello.

519
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,504
What coffee would Albi prefer 7

520
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,973
Irish or Italian?

521
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,171
I like Black.

522
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:37,212
Move to coffee maker of Office

523
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:43,266

524
01:13:43,267 --> 01:13:44,075
Kill you..

525
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:46,675
I don't like to repeat any word.

526
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,946
Now you can have some lime.

527
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:31,472
Now have a sip

528
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:38,341
Come on enjoy it.

01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,873
Is it hot and spicy?

530
01:14:45,601 --> 01:14:47,376
We'll meet day after tomorrow.

531
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:49,971
I'll prepare a nice coffee than this then.

532
01:14:50,234 --> 01:14:51,838
When you come for meeting

533
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:55,280
You should bring something for me

534
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:57,906
I'll tell you what to bring.

535
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,305
No.l won't do that. I never do it.

536

0k. Then you can watch those scenes in
You-tube in the list world scandal videos.

537

You'll be there. Not only you
but Ann also will be in trap.

538
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:27,308
Because her passport is found from the spot.

539
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:30,713
So Ann also will be with you.

540
01:15:32,134 --> 01:15:35,240
Tomorrow I'll light two candles for her.

541
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,203
This is the advantage of the technology.

Is this a lady's only station ?

01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:57,178
It's psychology. You don't understand it.

552
01:16:58,467 --> 01:17:00,777
Don't turn psychology to gynecology.

553
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:04,111
There is a good news.

01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:05,536

The body was first found by a news paper boy.

609
01:22:59,834 --> 01:23:03,281
Who might have killed him?

610
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:05,035
Hello Roy

611
01:24:05,134 --> 01:24:05,635

Another thing is Jayashankar

624
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,504
Someone is trying to trap me.

625
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:15,136
It's an unknown number.

626
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,077
It's his game.

627
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:19,711
Can't the number be traced.

628
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:21,208
Io we can't.

629
01:25:22,234 --> 01:25:23,304

630
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:24,208
Io.

631
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:26,574
If you say I'll be trapped.

632
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:33,182
I replaced another bullet instead
of the one which killed Jayan.

633
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,375
Some one chases me.

634
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:43,081
He knows my every movement.

candidate of Travencore gets controversial.

The death caused by close range gun shot.

641
01:26:16,401 --> 01:26:19,405
That means someone who is
very close to Jayashankar.

642
01:26:19,534 --> 01:26:24,033
He brought the bullet.
And he was dying there itself.

643
01:26:24,034 --> 01:26:27,379
The police suspects it as a political murder.

644
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:31,641
You.

645
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,038

I didn't take it because I thought
I shouldn't tamper the evidence.

01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:12,078
When I came on hearing a cry

650
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,611

Don't play too much.

676
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:39,805
I got it from your Jeep.

677
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,670

Let me wash my face.

682
01:32:24,634 --> 01:32:25,669
Don't you go home then 7

683
01:32:25,867 --> 01:32:28,677
Yah. But I need one more drink before that.

684
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,844
Another hike in the price of petrol is expected.

685
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:55,712
Oh no.

686
01:32:57,134 --> 01:32:59,978
A reshuffle is likely to take place in the Ministry

687
01:33:08,267 --> 01:33:09,678
Hello Ann please.

688
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,743
Don't trust anything in that CD.

I was going to reveal everything.

690
01:33:15,434 --> 01:33:16,845
If you had confessed early.

691
01:33:16,934 --> 01:33:18,106

I don't hand over that CD to police.

694
01:33:21,867 --> 01:33:24,973
It's just out of my pure generosity.

695
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:33,986
The investigation on murders of
Jayashankar and Vasu turns stunning.

696
01:33:34,634 --> 01:33:38,081
Your nature of ignoring me

697
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,111
I just hate it.

698

01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:22,610
That's what I don't understand .

706
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,202
Somebody has taken that gun that day.

707
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,540
It's all done by him who
calls from an unknown number.

708
01:34:28,034 --> 01:34:29,033
Try to understand Roy.

709
01:34:29,034 --> 01:34:30,069

I want some time.

719
01:37:20,934 --> 01:37:22,914
'Fme to hear me.

720
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:34,006
This gun and half paralyzed
body would be enough to kill you.

721
01:37:36,701 --> 01:37:41,616
Every man is connected with his wife on the
truth of her 'Tali' a small piece of gold

722
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:47,582
But no time is needed to
melt that small piece of gold.

723
01:37:49,634 --> 01:37:51,636
The same thing happened to you also.

724
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:54,973
You were fallen prey before a girl.

725
01:37:56,867 --> 01:37:58,471
That was my dock card.

726
01:37:59,867 --> 01:38:02,609
In the drama you acted upon my direction

727
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,338
There were another person
other than you and Ilimmy.

728
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,578
Gouth am.

729
01:38:16,434 --> 01:38:19,142
\fishnu...the imaginary husband of Ilimmy.

730
01:38:19,401 --> 01:38:21,642
In fact he is Goutham.

731
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,912
<i>There was nobody other than Kimmy to trap you.</i>

732
01:38:57,734 --> 01:38:58,872
I'm in service centre.

733
01:38:59,134 --> 01:39:01,307
I'm here to pick the car. I'll be back.

734
01:39:06,434 --> 01:39:09,506
Albi, I need to meet you urgently.

735
01:39:10,334 --> 01:39:11,200
Where are you now 7

736
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:12,339
I'm in a Bus stop in Eroor

737
01:39:12,501 --> 01:39:13,707
I'll come there.

738
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:22,203
My friend is living here.

739
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:24,172
The house is locked.

740
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:26,711
Where are you 7

741
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:30,580
Taxi driver will take you to hospital.

742
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:35,240
When hotel boy brings food there will
be a red packet; that is meant for Albi.

743
01:39:36,334 --> 01:39:37,540
There's drug in it.

744
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:41,480
If he takes it. He'll be fainted within minutes.

745
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:11,168
Is everything Okay.

746
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,043
Come. Come on.

747
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,138
The effect of drug will be there for 7 hours.

748
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:25,076
He'll get up at anytime.

749
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,277
Okay. Done.

750
01:40:58,234 --> 01:41:01,374
She was cheating me every time on various issues

751
01:41:03,034 --> 01:41:05,446
What did I do to her to treat me like this?

752
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:12,540
A big lie...that was our truth.

753
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:16,078
Don't you want to know the truth 7

754
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:21,440
Do you remember your returning journey
on the last day of your college days ?

755
01:41:33,567 --> 01:41:34,477
Hey Buddy...

756
01:41:35,134 --> 01:41:36,374
You seem to be mood off?

757
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:39,175
Come on. We'll make you happy.

758
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:41,574
Come on ...Come "trust us.

759
01:41:42,534 --> 01:41:43,478
Let us move Buddy.

760
01:41:45,867 --> 01:41:47,938
So education is over.

761
01:41:56,934 --> 01:41:59,437
He is mood off because he had to leave her.

762
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,344
Every vacation brings different mood offs

763
01:42:04,567 --> 01:42:06,945
Remya, Mariya, Meera.

764
01:42:07,434 --> 01:42:09,971
A reason to become mood off.

765
01:42:12,067 --> 01:42:13,978
I'm serious in this case.

766
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,012
Hey...don't drink more.
You're unfamiliar with drinks.

767
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:20,512
Let him. He is really troubled.

768
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:24,204
Some one is troubling us behind.

769
01:42:26,267 --> 01:42:27,507
Hey. What's up 7

770
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,211
He'll get beaten by us.

771
01:42:29,267 --> 01:42:31,133
He is troubling us for a long time.

772
01:42:31,134 --> 01:42:31,669
Leave it.

773
01:42:35,467 --> 01:42:37,344
He is about to get beaten by Roy.

774
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,911

Come on Buddy. Sit straight.

778
01:42:56,001 --> 01:42:57,173
There is nothing.

779
01:42:57,334 --> 01:42:59,336
Vasu help him to lie there.

780
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,572

01:43:01,834 --> 01:43:03,033

784
01:43:26,434 --> 01:43:28,937
Hello. It's not clear here.

785
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:33,010
Hello. There is a complaint with my vehicle.

786
01:43:33,534 --> 01:43:35,514

01:43:41,434 --> 01:43:46,281
My car is brake down. Driver
has gone to bring the mechanic.

790
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,473

791
01:43:49,867 --> 01:43:52,939
Can you drop me at home.

792
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:53,603

798
01:44:03,734 --> 01:44:04,838
He is sleeping.

799
01:44:07,734 --> 01:44:09,111
He is gone off early.

800
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,540

01:44:20,434 --> 01:44:21,572
Will we reach home 7

807
01:44:21,834 --> 01:44:22,835
Oh..

01:44:22,934 --> 01:44:23,844
Who knows 7

809
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,979
Who'll get this car then 7

810
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,304
Driver will come.

811
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:55,510
Four young drunkards with a beautiful girl.

812
01:44:55,867 --> 01:44:56,845
Don't miss them.

813
01:44:57,034 --> 01:44:57,910
Yes brother.

814
01:45:03,234 --> 01:45:04,144
Why did you stop here 7

815
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:05,974

01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:12,211

Who are they 7

829
01:45:50,634 --> 01:45:51,266

I'll come there.

832
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:56,111
Don't come there.

833
01:45:56,167 --> 01:45:57,271
What are you talking about?

834
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:58,966

01:45:58,967 --> 01:45:59,843

836
01:46:00,067 --> 01:46:01,705
Jaya. .-J W3"

837
01:46:10,634 --> 01:46:11,806
What happened?

838
01:46:12,267 --> 01:46:15,840
Ask her to get in the vehicle.

839
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,206
I told her.

840
01:46:17,267 --> 01:46:19,042
They are somewhere else here.

841
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,407
VasumJaya ...Roy...

842
01:46:25,067 --> 01:46:27,308
Hey vasu..

843
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:28,270
<i>ROY-</i> '

844
01:46:31,734 --> 01:46:32,804
Hey Roy what happened 7

845
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:34,209
You please get in the vehicle.

846
01:46:34,267 --> 01:46:35,769
That strangers are somewhere else here.

847
01:46:36,134 --> 01:46:38,011
You get in please.

848
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:38,874
Listen him.

849
01:46:38,967 --> 01:46:39,672
Go..

850
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,736
Roy Vasu..

851
01:47:04,934 --> 01:47:05,935
Ilimmi

852
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,008
Jaya..

853
01:48:48,634 --> 01:48:49,840
Buddy... Now let me go.

854
01:48:50,134 --> 01:48:51,875
Wear this mask when you approach her.

855
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:58,617
If she becomes conscious; she should think
that she was raped by some masked strangers.

856
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:01,874
All your ideas were always success.

857
01:49:02,067 --> 01:49:03,569
Is this something new to us 7

858
01:49:03,767 --> 01:49:06,213
We've started all this very successfully.

859
01:49:06,534 --> 01:49:10,539
What happened to Sarha and
Remya still exist as mystery.

860
01:49:10,734 --> 01:49:15,183
They still think its all by masked strangers.

861
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:20,580
Even Albi who accompanied all
this year do not know about this.

862
01:49:21,734 --> 01:49:23,680
Come on buddy. Go and have some fun.

863
01:49:23,901 --> 01:49:26,472
Have this mask too.

864
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:11,838
Let me go once again.

865
01:50:19,434 --> 01:50:21,710
Have this too.

866
01:50:21,901 --> 01:50:23,380
It's not necessary.

867
01:50:23,734 --> 01:50:25,145
Dude

868
01:50:25,567 --> 01:50:26,477
What happened 7

869
01:50:26,601 --> 01:50:28,137
She is not breathing.

870
01:50:28,534 --> 01:50:29,638
What 7

871
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:31,801
What will we do then 7

872
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:33,880
Relax. It's Kerala -Tamilnadu border.

873
01:50:34,034 --> 01:50:36,537
It's forest here; just 100 meters away.

874
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,136
Thick forest where tigers are seen .

875
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,880
Nobody would see her again.

876
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:43,580
We should leave the place immediately.

877
01:50:46,034 --> 01:50:47,775
What we'll say to Albi; if asks something 7

878
01:50:48,134 --> 01:50:49,408
Nothing will happen.

879
01:50:49,767 --> 01:50:52,714
We'll leave her on the way by
cutting the radiator wires of car.

880
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:56,179
If we could keep him like
this by mixing drugs in drinks;..

881
01:50:56,501 --> 01:50:59,971
...We can handle this also easily.

882
01:51:00,934 --> 01:51:03,505
Albi would believe what we say.

883
01:51:04,067 --> 01:51:06,980
We tell him that Ilimmy had another affair.

884
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,413
We'll also send him afake invitation card.

885
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,370
Do you understand?

886
01:51:41,434 --> 01:51:43,880
Io... I wont bereave this...

887
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:47,445
Can you believe all this 7

888
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:53,983
The Ilimmy whom you loved
once is only a memory now.

889
01:51:55,467 --> 01:51:59,711
I was living on that memory.

890
01:52:02,434 --> 01:52:11,445
Do you know I'm a bloody helpless father
who had to witness my daughter being raped.

891
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,606
Are you llimmy's father?

892
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,504
I was on the other side of the phone.

893
01:52:27,934 --> 01:52:30,414
No..No..

894
01:52:31,634 --> 01:52:32,866
H ello...H ello my daughter

895
01:52:32,867 --> 01:52:33,811
Hello can you hear me 7

896
01:52:33,967 --> 01:52:34,877
Have you started 7

897
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,877

898
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,777
Hello can you hear me 7

899
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,601
Where are you now?

900

What happened 7

901
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:50,400
Some one is there...with mask.

902
01:52:50,401 --> 01:52:51,233
Who are they 7

903
01:52:51,234 --> 01:52:51,905
Don't know.

904
01:52:56,934 --> 01:52:58,277
HEY <i>---my</i> daughter...

905
01:53:10,867 --> 01:53:11,868
What is happening there 7

906
01:53:34,801 --> 01:53:36,803
Come on dude Go and have some fun.

907
01:53:37,468 --> 01:53:38,879
Take this mask also with you.

908
01:53:43,267 --> 01:53:44,940
What happened Buddy 7

909
01:53:45,434 --> 01:53:46,811
She doesn't breath"

910
01:53:48,434 --> 01:53:49,811
What will we do then 7

911
01:53:50,934 --> 01:53:52,470
It's Kerala -Tamilnadu border.

912
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:55,240
It's forest here; just 100 meters away.

913
01:53:55,301 --> 01:53:58,305
Thick forest where tigers are seen .

914
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:19,674
I had never hurt her even with a look.

915
01:54:20,134 --> 01:54:28,485
But then I couldn't do anything;
Had to stand still hearing her voice.

916
01:54:37,567 --> 01:54:41,276
I was a soldier who one bravery awards thrice.

917
01:54:43,267 --> 01:54:49,912
But this Major Gouri Das
couldn't save his own daughter.

918
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:57,684
Eversince the death of her mother;
I was her best friend until she meets you.

919
01:54:58,834 --> 01:55:01,542
She loved you more than me.

920
01:55:04,367 --> 01:55:10,477
God was betraying your friends who
left my child for wolves of forest.

921
01:55:12,334 --> 01:55:14,541
Look...there.. someone is lying there.

922
01:55:17,534 --> 01:55:19,172
She is alive..

923
01:55:22,367 --> 01:55:23,846
Has her relatives come 7

924
01:55:24,467 --> 01:55:26,777
She was found unconscious in the forest.

925
01:55:27,534 --> 01:55:28,911
There was a mobile phone with her.

926
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,277
I had informed her parent.

927
01:55:31,467 --> 01:55:32,878
It was his father who attended phone.

928
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:36,509
I didn't reveal anything but asked
him reach here as possible as fast.

929
01:55:38,567 --> 01:55:39,910
Patient's father has come.

930
01:55:43,201 --> 01:55:45,909
Her condition was bad when she was brought here.

931
01:55:47,034 --> 01:55:50,072
You should be brave enough to hear what I say .

932
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:54,606
I would just want to know whether she is alive nor not.

933
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:40,339
Life took revenge on me two times.

934
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:46,778
Once it was in the form of a
mine which took my one of my legs.

935
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:52,347
Again it revenged on me through your
friends Who made my daughter like this.

936
01:56:52,701 --> 01:56:55,580
Can't you just let me know of this 7

937
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:02,476
I took firm step that world should
not know what happened to my daughter.

938
01:57:03,034 --> 01:57:05,275
I took my daughter to everywhere I can.

939
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:16,384
But I realized she can't be again my old Ilimmy.

940
01:57:23,267 --> 01:57:24,337
Albi..Do you know 7

941
01:57:25,034 --> 01:57:28,538
After that incident she never came out of her room.

942
01:57:29,168 --> 01:57:32,274
She stayed in her room for five years.

943
01:57:42,267 --> 01:57:46,306
But; she once came out of that room.

944
01:58:08,067 --> 01:58:09,512
I don't know who they are.

945
01:58:11,034 --> 01:58:12,604
But I want to kill them.

946
01:58:22,501 --> 01:58:25,243
Thereafter it was my aim.

947
01:58:26,567 --> 01:58:29,980
I started investigation from her college.

948
01:58:32,234 --> 01:58:37,149
I studied each moment of her like each day of her life.

949
01:58:38,134 --> 01:58:42,014
I traveled with all the faces she met with.

950
01:58:46,534 --> 01:58:49,105
The only clue I had to find out those faces;..

951
01:58:49,167 --> 01:58:56,608
...which were hidden between masks and darkness
were some sentences which God forgot to complete.

952
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,941
N ow it's your turn.

953
01:59:10,034 --> 01:59:10,637
Yes.

954
01:59:10,934 --> 01:59:12,242
Take mask with you.

955
01:59:12,834 --> 01:59:17,146
If she becomes conscious"

956
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,879
She is not breathing"

957
01:59:30,134 --> 01:59:31,272
It's Kerala Border...

958
01:59:31,501 --> 01:59:33,071
It's forest 100 meters away...

959
01:59:33,434 --> 01:59:37,883
Io cases till the day...

960
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:41,581
What happened to Sarha...

961
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:43,912
'l'lll today...

962
01:59:54,367 --> 01:59:55,505
Finally I recognized.

963
01:59:56,301 --> 01:59:59,874
What I had written was not mere words;

964
02:00:01,034 --> 02:00:10,148
But a handful of truths with the smell of my blood.

965
02:00:13,167 --> 02:00:19,277
Along with that llimmy could recollect something.

966
02:00:19,401 --> 02:00:23,281
When I analysed what she told
me my Every calculation was right.

967
02:00:25,067 --> 02:00:28,981
I could differentiate three faces.

968
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:32,406
Vasu.. Roy...J ayashankar.

969
02:00:33,034 --> 02:00:37,210
Then I started to write a screen
play. A screen play of revenge

970
02:00:37,767 --> 02:00:42,433
My buddy Goutham was with me.

971
02:00:42,434 --> 02:00:45,005
For us this game was a hunting.

972
02:00:45,267 --> 02:00:48,248
But here the hunter and
the prey were same person.

973
02:00:49,167 --> 02:00:51,272
The fake news paper and..

974
02:00:55,901 --> 02:01:04,377
...the police we created together made
Albi exactly new Albi for our screenplay.

975
02:01:20,334 --> 02:01:21,278
Hello.

976
02:01:21,334 --> 02:01:24,076
Now you reach near Sun Rice Hotel with gun.

977
02:01:24,167 --> 02:01:27,046
Keep the gun on a telex box there.

978
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,635
You...

979
02:02:58,834 --> 02:03:02,577
We needed only three seconds
to finish those three.

980
02:03:02,801 --> 02:03:06,647
But we needed you to have
a safe landing to them.

981
02:03:07,734 --> 02:03:09,372
It was like chess game.

982
02:03:10,301 --> 02:03:15,307
Io 64 columns but only 24 hours.

983
02:03:15,634 --> 02:03:19,047
Now Roy alone is responsible for everything.

984
02:03:20,201 --> 02:03:21,202
<i>Where is Kimmy '2?</i>

985
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:38,239
Her part is completed when she brought you here.

986
02:03:38,901 --> 02:03:44,908
She wanted to inform you everything
and decided to never come before you.

987
02:03:45,068 --> 02:03:48,845
But both Ann and Ilimmy will be with Albi.

988
02:03:58,201 --> 02:03:59,578
When did this happen 7

989
02:03:59,767 --> 02:04:02,111
She had met Ann.

990
02:04:11,034 --> 02:04:13,071
Are you Ann ?..I'm Ilimmy.

991
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,609
You are lucky to have her.

992
02:04:39,267 --> 02:04:40,245
Sir,

993
02:04:44,201 --> 02:04:48,115
It was my dream to give my daughter to you.

994
02:04:48,734 --> 02:04:52,705
I'll cherish that dream in my next birth also.

995
02:04:57,767 --> 02:04:59,576
Sorry Albi. Sorry for everything.

996
02:05:39,067 --> 02:05:41,445
It's off today. It's like a honeymoon

997
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:43,799
How can we know 7 Don't spoilt this please.

998
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,800
Hot news.. Hot news..

999
02:05:44,801 --> 02:05:46,474
Sub Inspector Roy committed suicide.

1000
02:05:46,567 --> 02:05:47,238
Sir, do you need news paper 7

1001
02:05:52,634 --> 02:05:53,738
Hot news.. Hot news..

1002
02:05:53,834 --> 02:05:55,040
Sub Inspector Roy committed suicide.

1003
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:05,738
Now Roy alone is responsible
for everything before law.

1004
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:08,637
You just do me a favour.

1005
02:06:08,967 --> 02:06:10,640
My lawyer is trying for bail.

1006
02:06:11,167 --> 02:06:14,580
Get some money from my cup board at home.

1007
02:06:41,634 --> 02:06:46,447
I got released on bail.

1008
02:06:47,034 --> 02:06:48,638
I need to meet you.

1009
02:06:48,867 --> 02:06:49,971
Let's celebrate this.

1010
02:06:50,101 --> 02:06:54,072
You can start. I shall join you.

1011
02:07:40,067 --> 02:07:41,273
Just stop here.

1012
02:07:43,367 --> 02:07:44,300
Whom did you post the letter 7

1013
02:07:44,301 --> 02:07:45,336
I'll tell you later.

1014
02:07:45,434 --> 02:07:46,777
Come on. It's time for live.

1015
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,573
A letter without address ...?

1016
02:07:58,667 --> 02:08:01,614
I don't know the date and address to greet you.

1017
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,814
But I've found a date and address in my mind.

1018
02:08:08,234 --> 02:08:10,942
It's today. It's today Albi
met Ilimmy for the first time.

1019
02:08:11,301 --> 02:08:15,613
I know how deep your love for Albi is.
Of course. It's too deeper than my love.

1020
02:08:15,734 --> 02:08:20,581
The face, which Albi forgot
for me once; is in my heart now.

1021
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,610
Remain with the hope that you will come one day.

1022
02:08:23,734 --> 02:08:26,237
Your own Ann.

1023
02:08:43,201 --> 04:17:26,401

1024
