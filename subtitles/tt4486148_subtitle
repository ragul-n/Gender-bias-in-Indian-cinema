1
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,333
Avi, I need to ask you something.

2
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,208
Please don’t say, "no."

3
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,791
What if I say "yes" before you ask?

4
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,500
Then, I will always be grateful to you.

5
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,791
Why are you being so formal?
It’s me.

6
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,041
Actually, I...

7
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,166
I don’t know how to say this.

8
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,583
I...

9
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,291
I mean my...

10
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,666
-You as well?
-No.

11
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,791
It’s easy.
You can say it.

12
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:18,708
You can do it.

13
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,208
My mom is in love with you.

14
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,250
Come on.

15
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
What are you guys doing?

16
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,416
We’re enjoying ourselves.

17
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,416
You've come to Shimla after two years.

18
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,666
What do you know?

19
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,791
Just wait and watch,
sister-in-law.

20
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,500
Soon, he’ll stop coming
to Shimla for good.

21
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,083
I disagree, Kannu.

22
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,625
Next year, he'll be here with a girl!

23
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,041
His girlfriend.

24
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,375
Or Mrs. Avinash.

25
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,291
Right, Avi?

26
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,375
Don’t worry, Grandma.

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,833
Everything will be normal
once he gets married.

28
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,375
You've poisoned the child's mind as well.

29
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,708
Have I ever complained about coming here?

30
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,208
I am bored of coming to
the same hill station, all my life.

31
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,791
-But do I ever complain?
-No.

32
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,041
You haven't complained yet.
But I don't trust you.

33
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,000
You’re very unpredictable.

34
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,000
No, Auntie, never.

35
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:15,958
I’ll never complain.

36
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,208
I’ll just leave quietly, if I'm bored.

37
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,041
We’re here just for a week.

38
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,083
“Leave quietly!”

39
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,791
I know, Mom.

40
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,416
And I’ll seriously try to
stay for a couple of days.

41
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,750
Uncle, stop making excuses.

42
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,708
It’s such a beautiful place.

43
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,000
You’re not leaving.

44
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,916
You find it beautiful,
just because this is your second trip.

45
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
This is my twenty-second trip.

46
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,458
But, if I still find something attractive...

47
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,041
I promise I won't leave.

48
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,666
Couldn’t you guys relax?

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,458
You could've attacked the market later.

50
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,958
Not everyone comes here to sleep.

51
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,041
Talking to you guys is a waste of time.

52
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,916
My love!

53
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,833
-How’s it going?
-Great.

54
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,541
Come on don't be shy!

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,583
Alright.

56
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,541
-How have you been?
-I'm good.

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,458
-And you?
-Great.

58
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,416
-I have a new book for you.
-Which one?

59
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,958
-Do you want to see?
-Of course.

60
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,375
100 ways to woo a girl.

61
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,541
Bastard!

62
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,208
-Any luck?
-Not yet.

63
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,166
Whenever I try to convey
my feelings to a girl...

64
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,333
I get totally dumbstruck.

65
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,500
Yeah?

66
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,125
I was trying to say...

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,583
I was saying that...

68
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
So, you couldn't ask a girl out.
What's the big deal?

69
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,500
There’s always arranged marriage.

70
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,250
You won't have to talk there.

71
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,291
The family takes care of everything.

72
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,541
You don’t need to worry.

73
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,458
The day I find true love...

74
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,166
I’ll ask her out in grand style.

75
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,750
Wait. Wait.

76
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,416
What’s taking them so long?
What are they doing?

77
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,708
Grandma! Auntie!
Let’s go.

78
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:41,958
Where?

79
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,500
-Come on.
-Where are you taking us?

80
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,458
Wait. Wait.

81
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,000
I came over to borrow a hammer,

82
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,500
not to be a part of
your silly photo shoot.

83
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,708
Cover your head.
Cover it.

84
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,291
And give me a good pose.
Something like this.

85
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,375
That’s more like it.

86
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,958
What a beautiful girl.

87
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,916
Yes, Sonu. She’s very beautiful.

88
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,125
But she’s a little too pretty for our Avi.

89
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,833
Your shop is doing well.

90
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,416
Maybe you should think
about my café as well.

91
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,291
Don't be jealous!

92
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,500
You’re not the sole owner of that café.

93
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,833
I’ve invested in it as well.

94
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,666
Talking to you is a waste of time.

95
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,250
Go ahead, click.

96
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,166
You didn’t wear
the head ornament.

97
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,083
Head ornament?

98
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,333
Look, I don’t have time
for that.

99
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,666
-This is your last and final pose.
-Please.

100
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,166
Sangeeta, get the head ornament
quickly.

101
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,166
I wish Avi was good enough to ask her out.

102
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,291
She would become our
daughter-in-law.

103
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,416
Daughter-in-law?

104
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,333
Hold on, sister.

105
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,541
She’s not a piece of mango
which you can pick and take home.

106
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,083
Wait, let me talk to her.

107
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,500
Just two minutes.

108
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,291
Just a minute.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,375
Hi, dear.

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,166
Namaste.

111
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,875
Are you... married?

112
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,125
No... I'm not.

113
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,041
And I don't intend to.

114
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,458
Just one minute!

115
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,333
This Vikas is good for nothing.

116
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,583
Yeah, Captain Uncle.

117
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,291
-The false ceiling fell down!
-What?

118
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,875
The false ceiling fell down?

119
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:10,916
Yes... the false ceiling.

120
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,208
Stay there, I am coming over.

121
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,750
I will show that bloody...

122
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,625
-Naina, my photo-shoot.
-My child!

123
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,666
Mishti will love this!

124
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,041
Mishti, where are you going?

125
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,875
I want to sit with Auntie.

126
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,125
Did you pack the walnuts?

127
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,333
Listen...
I had fun this time.

128
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,791
Mishti, say goodbye to Riz Road.

129
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,750
-What's wrong, Avi?
-Nothing.

130
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,666
You know what, you guys go on.

131
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,791
I’m going to stay.

132
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,458
Don’t translate it.
Tell us what's wrong.

133
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,416
Why do you want to stay back?

134
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,333
Nothing.

135
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,291
I just don’t want to leave yet.

136
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,750
What’s wrong, Avi?

137
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,666
Nothing, Mom, I just...

138
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,291
Do you guys get
why Avi wants to stay back?

139
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,750
Of course, son.
You can stay as long as you want.

140
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,958
May God give you the strength

141
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,458
to propose the girl this time.

142
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,375
Mom!

143
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,125
But who is she?

144
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,666
I don’t know.

145
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,916
What?
No, there’s no one.

146
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,166
Your uncle used to say...

147
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,416
Mishti, cover your ears.

148
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,458
Yes, Auntie.
I’ll try my best.

149
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,916
Here’s your luggage.

150
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,458
And this time come back only
after you have wooed her.

151
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,583
I admit it's a big order...

152
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,125
but, we don’t deliver food.
We’re short-staffed.

153
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,208
What can I do if you’re all alone at home?
I can’t come over.

154
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,333
I said I cannot come over.

155
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,541
I’m a changed man now, madam.

156
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,458
And...

157
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:53,291
Captain Uncle, I’m going to
crush that contractor Vikas today--

158
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
Candidates for the interview are here.

159
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,625
He's been working for six months and
the place is already falling apart and--

160
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,083
What are you doing?

161
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you blind?

162
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
What are you doing, Naina?

163
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,250
You know what, why don’t you
break a few more.

164
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,166
Hey! Hey!

165
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,833
Hey... what are you doing, Naina?
What are you doing?

166
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,375
We need to hire people

167
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,333
who are willing to stay and work.

168
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,833
If you keep behaving like this...

169
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,291
who would want to stay here?

170
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,916
I’ll get on with the interviews.

171
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Send them in one by one.

172
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,833
Guy number one... come in.

173
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,458
Keep your file.

174
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,958
Tell me about your education.

175
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,375
You’ll have to do everything here.

176
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,958
I’ll even make you clean
the bathroom.

177
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,041
Why?

178
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,208
I’ll pay you 5,000 rupees.

179
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,333
No?
Please leave.

180
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,291
Why do you show up for the interview
if you don’t want to work?

181
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,541
Come, please.

182
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,083
Who's next?

183
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,583
...for all the chores.

184
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,541
You're cooking almost after a year.

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,166
Well, the weather’s quite
special today.

186
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,666
This 24 karat smile is the most special.

187
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,875
Just like you started cooking...

188
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,916
you should resume your
dance practice as well.

189
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,041
I will.

190
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,625
Kidney beans.
Okra.

191
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,208
You know what...

192
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,166
Let’s sign the divorce papers as well.

193
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,500
Let’s start with a clean slate.

194
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,625
Should I call Tilak and tell him...

195
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,416
that you’re signing the
divorce papers.

196
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,583
Why do you call him "Tilak"?

197
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,375
Call him Papa.

198
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,625
Mom... he’s no longer my papa.

199
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,833
And he’s never coming back here either.

200
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,041
So, I am telling him that you’re
signing the divorce papers.

201
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,458
Do call him...

202
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,208
and wish him a happy birthday.

203
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,541
In fact, pay him a visit as well.

204
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,875
So, all this is for Tilak’s birthday.

205
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,083
Amazing...
You've made desserts as well.

206
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,375
Then we don’t need this.

207
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
What are you doing?

208
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,333
Don’t do it.

209
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,500
I've spent the entire day cooking.

210
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,416
Give me that!

211
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,791
Please, don’t throw the food away.

212
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,208
-Give it!
-Leave it.

213
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,041
Give me the sweets.

214
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,458
Give me the sweets, Mom.

215
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,250
He doesn’t want to divorce me.

216
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,541
He dumped you a long time ago.

217
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,916
And you’re still holding on to him.

218
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,125
-Give me the sweets, Mom.
-No.

219
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,125
For the past one &amp; half year, he’s been
living a few miles away

220
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,250
with a girl half his age.

221
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,916
He does this sometimes.

222
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,375
But eventually comes back to me.

223
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,875
You just wait and watch,
he'll come back.

224
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,291
Dear...

225
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,708
Wow!

226
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,083
One’s crying after cooking the food.

227
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,666
And the other one’s crying after
throwing it away.

228
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,583
And what for?

229
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,708
My good for nothing son, Tilak.

230
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,458
This is way too much drama.

231
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,166
What are you looking at?

232
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,625
Want some?
Go ahead.

233
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,541
It’s really tasty.

234
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,416
It’s called National café.

235
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,666
The board will change soon.

236
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,041
And you’re going to be
her employee...

237
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,208
as long as the café
doesn’t open?

238
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,166
It will open soon.

239
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,625
Everyone in Shimla knows...

240
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,458
she keeps announcing every month
that her café’s opening shortly.

241
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,000
Do you know how much
she has delayed it?

242
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,416
In fact, she had to setup few
coffee tables outside,

243
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,041
just to meet her expenses.

244
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,791
Fine. Everyone goes through a
bad phase in their life.

245
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,125
So what?

246
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,916
But soon, everyone in Shimla will know...

247
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,208
that I’ve joined the café now.

248
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,416
I’ve planned everything, Jude.

249
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,125
When the time’s right...

250
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,958
I will finally say what I never could.

251
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,000
I couldn’t have imagined
a bigger surprise!

252
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,791
My daughter personally
coming over to wish me.

253
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,333
Not just to wish you,
I also brought sweets.

254
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:53,000
-Mom made it.
-It’s a little too sweet.

255
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,250
A bitter man like you...

256
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,583
needs an extra dose
of sweetness.

257
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,458
Take this.

258
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,625
Why do you blame me for everything?

259
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,583
Because you’re adding years
to your life...

260
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,916
by celebrating your birthdays.

261
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:14,666
But your wife’s losing
on hers waiting for you.

262
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,666
Look dear, you’re still
very young...

263
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,833
and you haven’t fallen in love yet.

264
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,958
One day you will understand
my situation.

265
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,958
Mr. Sensible man...

266
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,958
why don’t you talk some
sense into my mother as well?

267
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,750
I already sent her the divorce papers.

268
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,791
It's not my fault that she
isn’t signing them.

269
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,000
Why marry a woman...

270
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,833
who can’t divorce you?

271
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,583
A man getting divorced, and remarrying
is not that big a deal anymore.

272
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,791
Then you should know that...

273
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,416
I will ensure that a woman
getting divorced and remarrying

274
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,000
will not be that big a deal
here in Shimla.

275
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,583
for bringing me to the temple.

276
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,041
Thank you for what, Mom?

277
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,166
You’re feeling good, right?

278
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,583
Mom, let’s do something that
will make you feel better.

279
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,000
-What?
-Come on.

280
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:08,958
Just stay quiet.

281
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,000
-Hello, priest.
-Bless you, child.

282
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,666
Now that we’re here...

283
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,541
I am sure we’ll be blessed.

284
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,541
Praise the Lord!

285
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,458
Praise the Lord!

286
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
Can you read my sister's palms?

287
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,125
Sister?

288
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,250
Have a look, please.

289
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,333
Have a look, please.

290
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:27,958
What does it say?

291
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,916
Don’t worry, dear.

292
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,833
It did take some time...

293
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,958
but her prince charming
is on his way.

294
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,875
Your sister’s blushing.

295
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,291
Anyway, thank you, priest.

296
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:44,833
You’re very naughty.

297
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,541
If this is bad, then so be it.

298
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,833
I see...

299
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,750
Be happy.
Enjoy your life.

300
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,583
Look at yourself.

301
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,708
Why? What’s wrong with me?

302
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,583
Mom, do you need me to tell you
how beautiful you are?

303
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,250
How talented you are?

304
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,541
And how graceful you are?

305
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,625
Are you going to waste all this?

306
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,000
And for what?
For that Tilak?

307
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,541
I understand, dear.

308
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,500
Change is an important part of life.

309
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,041
And I am trying my best.

310
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,375
Don’t try, Mom,
just do it.

311
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,041
Say it out loud...

312
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,166
Rukmini’s going to live
life on her own terms

313
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,625
Rukmini’s...
going to live life on her own terms

314
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,875
She's doesn't give a
damn about this world.

315
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,916
She's doesn't give a
damn about this world.

316
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,541
All Rukmini wants is...

317
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,625
Tilak.

318
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,666
Mister.

319
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,708
The picture on the back,
that’s my husband.

320
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,916
But he's with someone else.

321
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,916
What can he do if some girl
forces herself onto him?

322
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,166
Let me take a look.

323
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,583
Just a minute.

324
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,375
Why don’t you buy a copy
for yourself?

325
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,875
I just want to take a look.

326
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:09,791
But I--

327
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,458
Let me see.
It’s my husband’s picture.

328
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,375
Let go.

329
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,041
You’re such a strange man.

330
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,541
Look what you’ve done.

331
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,041
Wait, wait.

332
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,250
Give that back.

333
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,416
And use this cheaper one.

334
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,416
I’m going to use this at
the Marina.

335
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:33,083
Hey, Mr. Vikas contractor.

336
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,625
Are you going to think about your
own progress in every contract...

337
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,500
or, will you let others live
peacefully as well?

338
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,166
Captain sir, I've already had
enough of Naina's blabbering.

339
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,291
Please spare me the lecture.

340
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,291
I am designing this place.
I'm not digging a pit.

341
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,375
I think you’re trying to complete your
incomplete designing course in our café!

342
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,333
You know...

343
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,708
that I am trying my best
to finish the job.

344
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,541
Naina should’ve never dreamed so big
if she didn’t have money.

345
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,583
Why should I suffer?

346
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:03,833
Bloody contractor...
this light will go up here.

347
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,041
-Naina, this bloody--
-Why are you scolding the poor guy?

348
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,625
Let's resolve this issue calmly.

349
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,833
Right?

350
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,250
Have you lost your mind?

351
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,458
Those are expensive!

352
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,833
Who's gonna pay for that?

353
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,625
How would I know?

354
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:26,000
-All I know, is that I am...
-Naina, wait!

355
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,708
cancelling your contract today.

356
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:33,416
-I am throwing all your stuff out.
-Naina, listen to me.

357
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,375
You’re crazy.

358
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,500
I don’t want to see your face.

359
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,125
He has left.

360
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,208
He’s absolutely right,
Captain Uncle.

361
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,416
This is just a dream.

362
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,541
Tear it down!
I don’t want this!

363
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,375
Shut it down!
I don’t want this!

364
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,708
She’s leaving. Please stop her.

365
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,500
There's a storm raging in her life.

366
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,083
No one can stop her.

367
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,291
Shambhu. Janak.
Sorry, guys.

368
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,208
Please clean this up before
you leave for the day.

369
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,916
Can I stay back with them?

370
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,000
You’re new here.

371
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:14,958
And this isn't your job.

372
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,416
I’ll do anything for Naina madam.

373
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:21,458
Anything?

374
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:22,666
Wow!

375
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,416
Such is the plight of lovers...

376
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,291
they build their own little world,
without a hint of hope.

377
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,750
You’re finally here.
I’ve been waiting for so long.

378
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,041
Let's start.

379
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,041
Bring it in.

380
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,458
We’ll finish upstairs first.

381
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,916
-Me?
-Yes.

382
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,291
-Are you out of your mind?
-Why?

383
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,041
I opened a bookshop so that
I wouldn't have to dirty my hands.

384
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,416
You never dirty your hands
for a good deed.

385
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,833
And I know how clean you are.

386
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,291
But I have brought people along.

387
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:05,875
So you aren’t coming?

388
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,625
Come on, guys.

389
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,041
Now you’re dirty.

390
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,041
Let's go.

391
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,541
Before you give me credit
for all this...

392
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,416
let me tell you,
I have done nothing, as usual.

393
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,458
This is Avi’s magic.

394
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,541
Who’s Avi?

395
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,583
Poor boy did the unthinkable
overnight...

396
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:01,916
and you don’t know who’s Avi.

397
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,541
Avinash, the guy you employed
yesterday.

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,833
Please sleep.

399
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,250
-I’ll--
-No, no.

400
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,625
I was about to get up, anyway.

401
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:21,250
How can I sleep,
now that you're here.

402
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,250
I couldn’t sleep all night...

403
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,875
thinking about how I will fix the café
after firing Vikas in a fit of rage.

404
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,333
That's the bond which a
employer and his employee share.

405
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,958
They understand each other.

406
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,708
I wish to start a café, as well.

407
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,125
But if I don’t help you with your dream,
how will I build my own?

408
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,500
-Am I right, madam?
-Absolutely right.

409
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,458
But please stop calling me "madam."

410
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,791
I hate these formalities.

411
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,166
What else can I call you?

412
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,333
Call me Naina.

413
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,625
Or call me "sister" just
like Shambhu and Janak do.

414
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,250
Sister?

415
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,500
Why?
What’s wrong with "sister"?

416
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,916
Well, I already have a sister.

417
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,958
Her name is Sonu...

418
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,291
Then call me Naina.

419
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:06,125
If we’re on first-name basis,
does that make us friends?

420
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,291
Then let’s be friends.

421
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:48,750
Yeah?

422
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,708
I have something to say.

423
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,416
No...

424
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:04,375
I think we should buy
a water purifier for the café.

425
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,666
I think this--

426
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:13,083
Because Mom says that this purifier
gives you the purest water.

427
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,166
I was hungry,

428
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,416
but you seem to be
enjoying the food more.

429
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,625
What can I say?

430
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,791
I have never had a dinner
like this in my life.

431
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:34,708
-Excuse me, a paper towel, please.
-Have some more.

432
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,250
-No, I am done.
-Don’t be shy.

433
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,166
-Should I call for more?
-No, I'm not being shy.

434
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,791
This is just the beginning,
Naina.

435
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,875
I’m sure we'll be having
many more dinners together.

436
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,208
Did someone ever tell you that...

437
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,958
you look really ugly
when you smile?

438
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,208
No.
Why?

439
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,208
Then why don’t you smile?

440
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,416
I seldom get an opportunity to smile.

441
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:19,166
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you off to?</span>

442
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:31,458
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you off to?</span>

443
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,083
Can I say something,
if you don’t mind?

444
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,125
Of course.

445
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,166
I feel there is something
wrong with your café.

446
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,083
Well...

447
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,166
people go to the temple,
to pray.

448
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,958
They go to the theatre,
to watch a film.

449
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:55,083
Similarly, they don’t go to a café,
just to have some coffee.

450
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,625
They go there...

451
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,500
I mean... they go there
to do a lot more.

452
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,250
Like what?

453
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,750
To each his own.

454
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:11,250
A café should attract the attention
of any person.

455
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,083
Make him feel like this is
the place to be.

456
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,416
Why didn’t I think of that?

457
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,041
Why do you have to think
as long as I am here?

458
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,041
Just wait and watch...

459
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,666
how I transform your National café into
an International café.

460
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:27,708
Here's your bag.

461
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:38,625
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you off to?</span>

462
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:44,750
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you off to?</span>

463
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:57,083
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you off to?</span>

464
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,541
You better talk to your mother.

465
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,916
Next time... if she tries to sneak
into my room...

466
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:30,541
I’ll either call the police
or send her to a mental asylum.

467
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,125
All I wanted...

468
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,791
was a glimpse of him.

469
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,083
-What happened?
-Nothing.

470
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,916
Tell me what happened?

471
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,166
Why are you crying?

472
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,208
I... broke a heel.

473
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,250
That's no reason to cry.

474
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,791
That happens often.
And they can be fixed.

475
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:47,875
Right?

476
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,625
Not every broken thing can be fixed, Avi.

477
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,208
You can, if you try with a little love.

478
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,041
And, no need to cry over
what can’t be fixed.

479
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,583
You can always get a new one.
Right?

480
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,500
You can’t solve all my problems, Avi.

481
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,541
This is just the beginning.

482
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:09,500
I wouldn’t let any problem touch you.

483
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,291
Aren’t you doing a little too much...

484
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,000
for a job that pays just 5,000 rupees?

485
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,083
Am I now?

486
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,250
Why don’t you enjoy the service?

487
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,500
You can decide if you
want to raise my salary...

488
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,083
to 7,500 or reduce it
to 2,500 rupees later.

489
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,250
Please, smile.

490
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,458
What can you do for me right now?

491
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:42,916
Right now?

492
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,833
Your feet are gorgeous, my lady.

493
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,875
Don’t let them touch the ground,
they are getting dirty.

494
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:31,625
<span style="style.center_1">My heart has fallen in love</span>

495
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:36,083
<span style="style.center_1">Your name is now etched on my soul</span>

496
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:40,250
<span style="style.center_1">Your love is enchanting</span>

497
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,291
<span style="style.center_1">All I want is you</span>

498
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,791
<span style="style.center_1">Everything happens for a reason</span>

499
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:17,583
<span style="style.center_1">I know you’re unaware</span>

500
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:22,958
<span style="style.center_1">Everything happens for a reason</span>

501
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:27,333
<span style="style.center_1">I know you’re unaware</span>

502
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,958
<span style="style.center_1">To make you mine</span>

503
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:36,041
<span style="style.center_1">My heart made many mistakes</span>

504
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:40,083
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

505
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:44,333
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

506
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:52,750
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

507
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:07,666
<span style="style.center_1">My dawns and dusks</span>

508
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,541
<span style="style.center_1">My nights are sleepless</span>

509
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:21,750
<span style="style.center_1">All I can do, is wait for you</span>

510
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:26,250
<span style="style.center_1">Our distance makes me restless</span>

511
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:30,541
<span style="style.center_1">All I can do, is wait for you</span>

512
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:38,625
<span style="style.center_1">Your voice is what makes my heartbeat</span>

513
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:47,375
<span style="style.center_1">Your image dwells even in my dreams</span>

514
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,208
<span style="style.center_1">To make you mine</span>

515
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:56,625
<span style="style.center_1">My heart made many mistakes</span>

516
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:00,958
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

517
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:05,125
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

518
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:09,416
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

519
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:15,583
<span style="style.center_1">Many mistakes...</span>

520
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,041
<span style="style.center_1">My heart has fallen in love</span>

521
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:24,375
<span style="style.center_1">Your name is etched on my soul</span>

522
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:28,750
<span style="style.center_1">My heart has fallen in love</span>

523
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:32,916
<span style="style.center_1">Your name is etched on my soul</span>

524
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,041
<span style="style.center_1">Your love is enchanting</span>

525
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:42,458
<span style="style.center_1">All I want is you</span>

526
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:48,708
I wonder what every lovestruck
guy tries to find in the moon?

527
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,666
Stop staring.
It will fall down.

528
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,875
A guy whose love lasts
only for a couple of hours...

529
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,833
will never know how long
one can stare at the moon.

530
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,375
Get some sleep, bro.

531
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,333
I know you’re a Romeo at night

532
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,041
but in the morning,
you’re just her employee.

533
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,291
I can’t get enough sleep these days.

534
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,500
Can’t sleep?

535
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,250
Why don’t you take her along?

536
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,208
I swear, if she doesn’t put you
in coma...

537
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,541
I’ll change my name.

538
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,166
You are just...

539
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:16,500
Hold on.

540
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,333
Who is she?

541
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:19,916
What happened to the other one?

542
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,375
She was asking me to tattoo her name
on my arm.

543
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,166
I broke up with her on chat.

544
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,791
At least have the balls
to say it in person.

545
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:34,041
If you're not comfortable saying it,
write it down.

546
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,541
Of course.

547
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,958
If you're not comfortable saying it,
write it down.

548
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,750
Janak, clean this place.

549
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:42,291
<span style="style.center_1">You won my heart,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the moment I saw you for the first time.</span>

550
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,083
<span style="style.center_1">You must be wondering</span>
<span style="style.center_1">who is crazy enough</span>

551
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,000
<span style="style.center_1">to write a letter in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">today’s time.</span>

552
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,916
<span style="style.center_1">It’s me...</span>

553
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,666
<span style="style.center_1">Your Secret Admirer.</span>

554
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,541
Avi, throw that away.

555
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,333
Yeah, that paper in the dustbin.

556
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:19,416
Avi, hold on.

557
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,208
Finish the other chores first.

558
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,000
-Someone's at the door.
-Sure.

559
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,791
Do this later.

560
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:43,083
<span style="style.center_1">You give me sleepless nights,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and make my days restless.</span>

561
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,666
<span style="style.center_1">I think the only way to cure</span>
<span style="style.center_1">this pain...</span>

562
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,666
<span style="style.center_1">is when you’ll</span>
<span style="style.center_1">utter my name.</span>

563
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,375
<span style="style.center_1">Just like I chant your</span>
<span style="style.center_1">name all day.</span>

564
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,791
<span style="style.center_1">I have just one desire now.</span>

565
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,083
<span style="style.center_1">Bear your attitude,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">alleviate your sorrows...</span>

566
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,750
<span style="style.center_1">and make you smile.</span>

567
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,166
You know, Brownie,
I wrote that letter to Mom...

568
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,791
so that she can get over
that Tilak for good.

569
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:35,250
So that, she get rid of these heavy-duty
thoughts like "together-for-life"

570
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,500
and face the reality,
and accept the truth.

571
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,916
So Naina smiled after reading
your letter.

572
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,041
Yeah!

573
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,291
And she gave it a tight hug?

574
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,041
I mean I've never seen her this happy.

575
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,541
I know you won’t lie to me...

576
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,708
but, I find it hard to believe.

577
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:07,666
<span style="style.center_1">You won my heart,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the moment I saw you for the first time.</span>

578
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,625
<span style="style.center_1">Say it out loud...</span>

579
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,916
<span style="style.center_1">Rukmini’s is going to live</span>
<span style="style.center_1">her life on her own terms!</span>

580
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,083
<span style="style.center_1">She doesn't give a damn about this world.</span>

581
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:31,708
What’s wrong?

582
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:33,625
What’s wrong with you?

583
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,500
You look really happy.

584
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,416
I see...

585
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,416
Is it that obvious?

586
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,041
Only con artists hide their feelings.

587
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:45,500
Honest people are not capable of doing it.

588
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,625
You know, Avi, I have never done
anything like this before.

589
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,333
I am really scared.

590
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,125
Everything will go as per your plan.

591
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:57,791
You know, I always thought that
money can make the world move.

592
00:44:58,666 --> 00:44:59,500
Me too.

593
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:03,916
But, I've just realized that even a piece
of paper can change someone’s life.

594
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,291
Of course, it can.

595
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:10,583
But I’ll have to wait and watch
to see if this is true.

596
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,541
People bitten by the love
bug are at every nook and corner.

597
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,541
Millions dead...
and yet, billions are queuing up.

598
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,041
Captain Uncle, where can one buy
flowers in Shimla?

599
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,166
For a funeral?

600
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,416
No, for love.

601
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,416
Grandma, is Mom there?

602
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:43,291
She isn't home.

603
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,500
What do you mean?

604
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,666
I can’t say.

605
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:19,958
Are you a writer?

606
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,375
Yes.

607
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,541
Do you write well?

608
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:40,333
Did you write this?

609
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,833
It's good.

610
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,166
But... I didn’t write this.

611
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,291
Then, why are you wasting my time.

612
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,083
Just because someone wrote you
a letter

613
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,541
will you look for him on the streets?

614
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,791
Ask any random person?

615
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,166
But just like you said...

616
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,666
Rukmini, you must live
life on your own terms.

617
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,791
I was shocked to read this letter...

618
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,708
because someone thinks about me
more than I do.

619
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:24,750
I will find my secret admirer.

620
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,458
What is it?

621
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,208
Flowers?

622
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,125
Who called for these?

623
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,083
I...

624
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:47,708
I don’t know.

625
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:49,541
Someone left them outside.

626
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,125
Someone left them outside.

627
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,083
-Outside?
-Yeah.

628
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:56,916
He must have done it.

629
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,750
He sent these flowers.

630
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,083
He must be around.

631
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:05,625
This...

632
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,083
What?

633
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,458
Flowers?

634
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,041
Keep it.

635
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:46,750
Hey!

636
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,750
That’s mine.

637
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,208
Read your own letter.

638
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,375
I was reading my own letter.

639
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,541
She used my emotional letter
to heal her mother’s heart.

640
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,041
It’s okay, buddy.

641
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,125
There's no shortage of
girls in this world.

642
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,291
Your decision to leave is
absolutely right.

643
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:24,458
When did I say that?

644
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:25,541
So you're not leaving?

645
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:26,625
Why would I leave?

646
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,583
This was just a temporary setback,
not a loss.

647
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,625
I’ll start afresh.

648
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:32,750
I'll think of something new.

649
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:33,916
Right?

650
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,416
And anyway, her mother’s definitely in
a better mood after reading the letter.

651
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,125
If her mother's happy,
obviously, Naina will be happy.

652
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,166
Right?

653
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,875
And when everyone’s happy,
everything goes well.

654
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:47,625
My daughter says bad is good.

655
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:50,208
So I’m going to be bad.

656
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,208
Mom, I didn't tell you
to be so bad.

657
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,500
Look...

658
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,625
Tilak’s divorce papers.

659
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,583
They were lying in the cupboard
all this while.

660
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:04,333
But now I am taking them out
and keeping them on this table.

661
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:06,791
Look!

662
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:10,333
Now that’s like my girl.

663
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,458
Now that Tiku will learn his lesson.

664
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:13,750
And look...

665
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,541
I'll resume my practice today!

666
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,750
You’re doing a great job
at being bad.

667
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,125
After the divorce,
I’m going to stay with you.

668
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,416
Of course.
You will stay with us.

669
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,416
I don’t want to live with that idiot.

670
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:31,791
Of course, grandma.
We won’t let you!

671
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:35,833
Come on, Mom. Now sign these
papers quickly, please.

672
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,291
Of course not.

673
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,458
I'll do it,
only after I find my secret admirer.

674
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,958
Sorry, I am late.

675
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,291
-Is your mother alright?
-Yes.

676
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,208
She is absolutely fine.

677
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:49,208
Hey!

678
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,083
Let’s get these done today.

679
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,333
We have been ignoring it
for a long time.

680
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,708
-But the accounts are done.
-Done?

681
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:55,750
Did you do it?

682
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,125
-I thought you did them.
-No.

683
00:50:58,833 --> 00:50:59,666
Strange.

684
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
-Actually, I did it.
-He did it.

685
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:06,375
-You know accounting?
-Yes, I do.

686
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,291
You never asked, so, I never
mentioned it.

687
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,958
Wow! Wow!

688
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:16,208
Words aren’t enough to praise you!

689
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:19,875
It's hard to find such hard-working
boys on a tight budget.

690
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:46,916
What happened?

691
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:50,833
Avi, what are they saying?

692
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:51,791
Avi, what are they saying?

693
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,000
I don’t understand their language.

694
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:55,416
I don't know,
someone was staring at the girl.

695
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,708
It's good to know that
these fights are common.

696
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,166
I thought this was just an Indian thing.

697
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,750
So... you know accounts
as well as Chinese.

698
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,208
I do.

699
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,833
But they were speaking Japanese.

700
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,291
So, you know Japanese as well?

701
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,375
And about 10-12 more languages.

702
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,291
And of course, you didn’t tell
me because I didn’t ask.

703
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,208
Right?

704
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,625
Mr. Avinash, before I inform the police...

705
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:03,208
that some secret agent has
infiltrated my café...

706
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,041
tell me who you are.

707
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,625
Honestly, I am Avinash.

708
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,541
I'm not some secret agent.

709
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,208
But I am on a secret mission.

710
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,333
Actually, my family left
me here...

711
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:20,500
warning me that I cannot return
until I find a bride.

712
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,333
I thought I’ll work at a café.

713
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:24,750
Girls frequently visit cafés,

714
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,208
maybe someone will notice me.

715
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,083
You just wait here,
I will take a decision right now.

716
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,083
Captain Uncle. He’s a bloody fraud.

717
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,708
How does he know
so many foreign languages?

718
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:43,708
He wanted to make an
international café, didn’t he?

719
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:47,083
He’ll just add "inter"
to our "National" café.

720
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,708
And make it an international
café.

721
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:52,625
Naina... he cannot just take over
our café.

722
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:56,083
Do you want me to believe
his stupid excuse...

723
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,833
that he's trying to find
a bride?

724
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,416
No.

725
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,666
He’s got his hands in every
single department of our café.

726
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,583
Imagine.

727
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,875
And much more.

728
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,958
No, dear.

729
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,083
I don’t think so.

730
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,833
What do I look like?

731
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,833
There’s no way I will let him
take me for a ride.

732
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,708
I will show him.

733
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,833
Come along.

734
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,208
Wong Ching Pong, here we go.

735
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,208
Your services are no longer required.

736
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:35,125
You’re fired.

737
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,375
Why are you being so formal?
We’re friends.

738
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,583
No, we're not. You are not the
guy you were pretending to be.

739
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,458
And you’re definitely not the guy I hired.

740
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,458
How does it matter?

741
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,458
The fact is that I am the best
man for this café.

742
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:53,125
Let me be the judge of
what's best for this café.

743
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,416
I know its National café,
but it’s mine.

744
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,875
And I’ve no intentions of
taking it over.

745
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,958
Uncle, please talk to her.
What is she thinking?

746
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:03,458
The owner says that you’re a cheap man.

747
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,208
-And, I don’t even know you.
-What?

748
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,666
Okay anyway,
stop wasting my time and get out.

749
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,625
I don’t care, and I don’t want
to know.

750
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,208
You really don’t know.

751
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,458
You’ve to give 30 days' notice
before you fire an employee.

752
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:21,000
If you don’t want to end up in
legal trouble before the opening...

753
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,666
then, you must bear with me
for 30 days.

754
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:23,916
Right?

755
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:28,375
So, I’ll leave now and
come back tomorrow.

756
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,416
Okay?

757
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,083
Sayonara.

758
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:33,166
Sayonara.

759
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36,541
He knows the law as well.

760
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,458
I think this man is trouble.

761
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:44,125
Captain Uncle,
don’t give him any work.

762
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,208
No work at all.

763
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,833
Dear Lord, benevolent one.

764
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:58,708
How long will you mischievously
keep admiring me from a distance?

765
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:02,333
Step into the light,
and into my life.

766
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,333
Please reply to my letter
as soon as possible.

767
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:11,833
Yours, Rukmini.

768
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Priest.

769
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,208
What’s going on?

770
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:30,583
The priest says that
he secretly loves me.

771
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:33,000
But he’s afraid to admit it.

772
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,083
There is no one.

773
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,583
Sit down, Naina...

774
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,208
and listen to what the priest
has to say.

775
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,125
Hey, priest!

776
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,958
What bullshit are you
feeding my mother?

777
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,625
What is your problem?

778
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,375
Why will a priest have a problem?

779
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,583
Priests have solutions.

780
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,375
Look... I’ve found a solution.

781
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:54,458
Rukmini has written a love letter to God.

782
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,625
Soon, the Lord will initiate
his divine game...

783
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,500
and things will fall in place.

784
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:03,208
Priest, all I want is
a reply to my letter.

785
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:04,250
You'll get it tomorrow.

786
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,083
-Tomorrow?
-What nonsense!

787
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,208
-No, you won't.
-Of course, I will.

788
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,750
Mom, it’s not going to happen.

789
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,375
If I don't get a reply,
I’ll harm myself.

790
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:36,000
-Mom, I am leaving.
-Okay, dear.

791
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,166
Drive safe.

792
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:41,583
-What are you doing there?
-Waiting... for the love letter.

793
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,375
Are you going to stand there all day?

794
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:47,958
Whether I sit, stand, sing, or
dance, it’s my wish.

795
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:49,958
Mind your own business.

796
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:55,958
I said leave.

797
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:07,708
Here you go.

798
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,750
-Don’t do it.
-What’s wrong? Let me do it.

799
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:18,708
That’s my job.

800
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,625
I’m just checking the stock.
Let me do it.

801
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,291
I was halfway through,
you’ll just make a mess.

802
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,791
-It’s alright. Let me do it.
-Like I said...

803
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,958
I know how many cakes have arrived today,
you don’t.

804
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,250
-Fine, you do it.
-I was doing it!

805
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
What’s wrong with him?

806
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:40,791
Are they fresh?

807
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:42,791
Oh, God.

808
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,250
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.

809
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,125
This is not your job, either.
This is my job.

810
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,958
-Let me--
-I know where to keep these.

811
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,125
Why did you get these?

812
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,041
-You keep them!
-I am doing it!

813
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,833
You'll get a heart attack.

814
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,916
These two have a fight...

815
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,458
and I've to bear the brunt of it!

816
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:04,958
Oh, God!

817
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,208
Don’t climb up there.

818
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,750
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.

819
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,208
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.

820
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,125
Don’t do anything.

821
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,708
-What’s wrong?
-How do I explain?

822
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,250
My job’s at stake here.

823
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:18,166
-Job--
-Don’t do anything.

824
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,083
Don’t do anything.

825
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,583
And anyway, you look so tired.

826
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,583
I know you’ve worked
really hard...

827
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:24,625
and made this café what it
is today.

828
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,375
-Look! Look!
-What are you doing, Captain Uncle?

829
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:55,958
What’s... going on here?

830
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,208
We’ll have to tolerate him for 30 days.

831
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,833
Please come to my office.

832
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,541
If you behave like this...

833
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,500
no one will get anything
for you.

834
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,625
Go on!

835
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,916
What’s going on, Captain Uncle?

836
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,833
Some people achieve what they perceive.

837
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,541
And some are losers like him
who just waste their time.

838
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:32,583
Let him be.

839
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:34,375
That's alright.

840
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,250
But, at least you focus on
your work.

841
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,166
What happened?

842
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,125
The café invites are still here.

843
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:43,166
Anyway, please have these delivered.

844
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:56,458
Just a minute.
Listen to me.

845
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:57,416
What?

846
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,000
Don’t be mad.
I said sorry.

847
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,333
-I have a small job for you.
-Now you want me to work.

848
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,625
Come on.

849
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:06,541
Do it for me.

850
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,083
These are the invites for our
café’s opening.

851
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,083
Please have these delivered.

852
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,375
-What a stupid job?
-It’s a job after all.

853
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,333
And you said you want to work.

854
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,333
Please do it for me.

855
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:21,333
Here’s the money.

856
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:23,833
I have money.

857
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:25,708
I’ll talk to you when I get back.

858
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:39,375
You seem to have a lot of money!
Why don't you give me some?

859
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:44,083
I'll walk over to the third
street and deliver it.

860
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:46,333
Is the address close-by?

861
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,375
It's the second house on the third street.

862
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,416
Listen.

863
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:40,041
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">There she goes</span>

864
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:42,166
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk. Ruk. Rukmini</span>

865
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,375
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk. Ruk. Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">There she goes...</span>

866
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,208
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>

867
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:03,375
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">There she goes...</span>

868
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:04,458
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>

869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,541
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">There she goes...</span>

870
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,750
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>

871
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:10,666
Hey...

872
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,708
Looking nice, Auntie.

873
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,250
Who are you calling auntie?

874
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:18,916
Don’t come again.

875
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:46,250
Captain, the boy who just walked in,

876
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,541
does he work here?

877
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,625
You mean... Avinash?

878
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,208
-So, his name is Avinash?
-Yes.

879
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,583
I see...

880
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:17,708
Namaste.

881
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:19,708
Namaste?

882
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:25,583
You've good manners
even at such a young age.

883
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:30,708
-Age has nothing to do with it.
-That’s true.

884
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:34,458
Age has nothing to do with anything.

885
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,500
-Mom, please come inside.
-Coming.

886
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,833
Come meet me in the office.

887
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:47,083
"You look so cute
when you deck up.”

888
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:51,583
“I see you in my dreams
day and night.”

889
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,208
It’s not right to read out
your love letter.

890
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,500
But, between us...

891
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:02,166
this letter, as compared to
the earlier one, lacks passion.

892
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,458
But still... Avinash,
you’re such an amazing writer.

893
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,208
How did Avinash get into all this?

894
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:13,125
Avinash is my secret admirer.

895
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:23,500
-What nonsense, Mom?
-Call me sister.

896
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,208
I am sure he knows,
but still...

897
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:30,708
sister sounds so much better.

898
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:37,458
-May I come in?
-Yes, of course.

899
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:46,250
How did you know I was thirsty, Avi?

900
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:52,583
-Can I call you Avi?
-Call me anything you want.

901
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:58,666
By the way, how long have
you been--

902
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,708
You’ve been wasting time.

903
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,166
Go and do some work.
Go on.

904
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,208
But you said I shouldn’t work.

905
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,291
But now I am telling you to work.

906
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,333
Go.

907
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,208
-Go, go.
-Strange.

908
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,958
Mom, he’s my employee.

909
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:17,000
He can't dare to write a
love letter to you.

910
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,500
I am sure there’s some confusion.

911
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:25,333
Naina, I loved a blue-blooded man.

912
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:26,666
But what did I get in return?

913
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
But this common man changed my life.

914
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:31,791
Fine.

915
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:36,000
But as long as we don’t confirm
that Avinash is your secret admirer,

916
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,250
please stop this drama...

917
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:40,125
and go home.

918
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,625
Take those anklets off and
wear my shoes.

919
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:43,958
-Come on.
-Yeah, I know.

920
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:49,125
You’re feeling embarrassed.

921
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:52,583
Because, a guy your age is hitting on me.

922
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:57,250
What if he’s your employee,

923
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,916
he’ll available in the evening
after his working hours.

924
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:03,666
Until then, I'll go to
Pinky's parlor

925
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,250
and get ready for him.

926
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,916
Avi, what’s wrong?

927
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,500
I can’t change clothes again.

928
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:30,041
I apologize for everything
that happened inside.

929
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:39,500
Actually... I wanted to say
something to you.

930
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:42,500
Me?

931
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,500
But... it’s a little personal.

932
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:14,791
Where are you taking my boyfriend?

933
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:19,208
No, Mom...
I am with Brownie.

934
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,958
If you are with Brownie,

935
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:24,958
am I sitting here
with her twin sister?

936
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,833
-Yeah, Jude.
-Where are you?

937
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,750
Naina’s brought me out of the city.

938
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:35,916
I think something is going to
happen today.

939
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:37,666
What?

940
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,000
Just hold on for a second.

941
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:44,458
Say that again.

942
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,750
I was saying that something’s
going to happen today.

943
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,583
-Really, son?
-Mom?

944
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,083
I just made a conference call
to give them the good news.

945
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,083
You--

946
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:55,958
Avi, can we come over
to watch you.

947
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,833
Stop embarrassing me, Sonu.

948
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,125
If it's all set, why are you
feeling embarrassed?

949
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,458
Come over, Sonu.

950
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,708
Jude! Stop this nonsense!

951
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,125
I’ll call you later.

952
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,250
Listen...

953
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:09,541
Don’t waste your time holding hands.

954
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:10,625
Just kiss her.

955
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,875
Okay, bye.

956
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:17,666
Don't call me again. Bye.

957
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,750
If you want me to sign the
divorce papers...

958
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,791
then it's crucial I meet Avi.

959
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,833
You’re getting me wrong, Mom.

960
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:27,875
It's not what you think.

961
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,750
I’ll explain everything later.

962
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,416
Avi, I need to ask you something.

963
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,291
Please don’t say "no."

964
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:48,750
What if I say "yes" even before you ask?

965
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,541
Then, I will always be grateful to you.

966
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,083
Why are you being so formal?
It's me.

967
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:59,000
Actually, I...

968
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,125
I don’t know how to say this.

969
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,083
I mean my...

970
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,708
-You as well?
-No.

971
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,416
It’s easy.
You can say it.

972
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,500
You can do it.

973
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,125
My mom’s in love with you.

974
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,625
So, you brought me all the way
out here...

975
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,541
to tell me this.

976
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:52,833
Actually, my mom
was pretty depressed.

977
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,708
Then one day I got a letter
from some secret admirer.

978
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,750
I thought, if Mom receives a
letter like this,

979
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,625
maybe, she will forget
about her problems.

980
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:08,500
I sent that letter to my mom.

981
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,125
Please, just pretend for a few days.

982
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:24,083
Just pretend that you are
my mom’s secret admirer...

983
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:25,666
and you wrote those letters to her.

984
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:33,166
I promise that I’ll tell her
everything when the time is right.

985
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:34,875
Just for a few days, Avi.

986
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,958
So, Rukmini suggested meeting here.

987
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:50,916
Why not?

988
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,416
It's my daughter's café after all.

989
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,125
Why are you here?

990
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,875
And, how dare you bring her here.

991
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,541
We didn’t come here to meet you.

992
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,250
Can we get a table for four?

993
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,666
You can forget about getting a
table here even after the opening.

994
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:08,875
And for four people?

995
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,541
-Who did you invite?
-I didn’t invite anyone.

996
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:15,208
Your mother invited me over to
introduce me to her boyfriend.

997
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,375
Yes, Naina.
I invited him.

998
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:31,000
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What’s wrong with you?</span>

999
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:35,833
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What’s wrong with you?</span>

1000
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:42,208
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What’s wrong with you?</span>

1001
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:45,333
I won’t leave without meeting Avi.

1002
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,333
And, I must introduce him to
these guys as well.

1003
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:49,083
What are you doing, Mom?

1004
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:52,333
I will definitely let you
meet Avi...

1005
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:54,541
but why introduce him to these guys?

1006
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,750
That's necessary.

1007
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,958
We lovebirds will often
bump into each other.

1008
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:05,416
At the park, the theatre,
sunset point.

1009
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:11,000
I don’t want us to bump into each
other without a formal introduction.

1010
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:12,541
That would be so awkward.

1011
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:14,000
Isn’t this awkward as well?

1012
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,875
Please send the man of the hour.

1013
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,958
Mom, I don’t know how to say this,

1014
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,000
he is not coming.

1015
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:28,500
Promises once made must be kept.

1016
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:29,416
See...

1017
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,083
Make it quick.

1018
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,333
Tilak, how are you?

1019
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:12,250
I am fine.

1020
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,500
He has that effect on people.

1021
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,375
Karishma... how old are you?

1022
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,875
And Avi?

1023
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,833
Just a year younger to her.

1024
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:33,416
Karishma, how educated are you?

1025
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:36,041
-I’ve completed my graduation.
-Graduate?

1026
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,208
Is that all?

1027
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,375
Avi. You’re highly educated, aren’t you?

1028
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,791
-Come on.
-Highly!

1029
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,833
Highly!

1030
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:49,375
Tilak... do you have any questions?

1031
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:50,875
Yes.

1032
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,125
What did you say your name was?

1033
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,791
-Avinash I--
-How much sugar?

1034
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,416
No sugar, no milk.

1035
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:02,208
I’ve stopped drinking coffee.
And Rukmini knows.

1036
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,041
That’s even better.

1037
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,916
Your loss is my gain. Again!

1038
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,458
You’re so naughty, Avi.

1039
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:12,458
Really sorry, guys.
But I am a little drunk.

1040
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:17,666
Of course, if you don't have a problem,
let’s have some more.

1041
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,833
I am sure you know.

1042
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,583
This is how they drink coffee in Ireland.

1043
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,500
Right?

1044
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,333
How about I make your coffee
Irish as well?

1045
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,916
As far as I know,
Rukmini doesn’t drink alcohol.

1046
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:34,416
I've come a long way from
the woman you once knew.

1047
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:44,708
By the way...

1048
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,166
-What do you do?
-What do I do?

1049
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,500
Actually, I do everything.

1050
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:55,166
The chair you’re sitting on,
resting your hands...

1051
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,250
the glass you’re drinking water from,
and the place where you’ll take it out.

1052
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,250
I deserve the credit for it all.

1053
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,125
-I work in this café.
-You don’t look like an employee.

1054
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:10,833
That’s because these days I am
someone’s prince charming.

1055
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:17,500
With a catch like this, the happiness
will clearly show on the face.

1056
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,000
Right, Rukmini?

1057
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,958
You know, the name Rukmini is too long.
Too long.

1058
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,416
If I can call you Avi,

1059
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:41,000
you can definitely call me Mini.

1060
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:48,916
It’s your personal affair.

1061
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,583
You can call each other anything you want.

1062
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,041
Why will it matter to us?

1063
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,916
How do I address our
ever changing relationship?

1064
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:24,125
I mean it’s changing at the
speed of a rocket.

1065
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,416
A few days ago,
you were my boss.

1066
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,375
Then we became friends.

1067
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,125
What do I call you now?

1068
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,375
Daughter?

1069
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,875
Only I have a right to call her daughter.

1070
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,458
Even I have a right to call her daughter.

1071
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:57,000
In fact, why don’t we let Naina
and Avi decide that?

1072
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:01,083
Fine, you guys can decide among
yourselves who will address whom as what.

1073
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,208
Come, darling. Let’s go.

1074
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:08,375
You’ll have to make new
divorce papers.

1075
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,541
I didn’t want to sign these
at first.

1076
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,250
But, now I am so happy that,

1077
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:18,333
I couldn’t stop signing.

1078
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,500
Must have been hard...

1079
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:32,458
for Tilak.

1080
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
Yes.

1081
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,291
But do you feel sad for him?

1082
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,333
Why will I feel sad?

1083
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,958
-You’re here for me.
-Yes.

1084
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,625
Why? What’s wrong?

1085
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:51,875
You’re okay, right?

1086
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,416
Sorry I...

1087
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:58,583
Well, I tried Irish coffee
for the first time.

1088
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,958
So, I’m sloshed.

1089
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,375
The things you do for love.

1090
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,500
I know them pretty well.

1091
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,583
Well, I'll take your leave.

1092
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:41,541
Avi, I am really sorry for
whatever happened inside.

1093
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,250
I didn't know the situation--

1094
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,916
You got what you wanted, right?

1095
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:51,333
Avi, I know it was a
difficult job.

1096
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,791
You don’t know what you’ve done
for me.

1097
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:46,291
Wow, Mom!

1098
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,083
It seems like you never stopped
practicing at all.

1099
01:20:52,083 --> 01:20:56,708
By the way, you look like you're in a
very happy mood today.

1100
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,041
Why wouldn’t I be?

1101
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:03,125
Last night, my boyfriend Avi

1102
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,583
blew Tilak out of the water.

1103
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:06,500
Yeah.

1104
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:12,333
Mom, are you sure about Avinash?

1105
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,416
Why?
Is he interested in someone else?

1106
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,333
No.

1107
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,875
I mean, how would I know.

1108
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,083
Then...
why are you asking me about him?

1109
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:26,000
-Are you in love with him?
-Who me?

1110
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:26,958
Yeah.

1111
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:32,000
You know that I don’t waste
my time thinking about love.

1112
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:36,750
Love cannot be explained,
or perceived in thoughts.

1113
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,958
-Love just happens.
-I see.

1114
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:42,458
Just like dengue and malaria.

1115
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:49,125
When someone stays up all night
to fulfill your dreams...

1116
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:53,625
and the mere mention of his
name makes you restless...

1117
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,083
and fireworks go off in
your heart.

1118
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:03,583
When nothing seems impossible
because he’s with you.

1119
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:08,625
-Have you ever felt that way?
-Yes, I did.

1120
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:11,333
No. I mean never.

1121
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,208
Yes... never.

1122
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:14,958
That means yes.

1123
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:17,458
Don’t be shy.
Tell me who he is.

1124
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:19,333
Mom, stop it.

1125
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:23,875
Now listen, you've finally
taken a decision about Dad.

1126
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:24,916
Yes, I have.

1127
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,375
And you've resumed practicing.

1128
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:28,875
Yes, I have.

1129
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,666
-So, life’s back on track again?
-Yes.

1130
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:35,208
Now, let's end Avi's track at this point

1131
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,125
What is your connection
with my love story?

1132
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,541
This is between Avi and me,
which he started.

1133
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:47,875
Mom, let’s not worry about
who started what and why?

1134
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,791
Let’s end this here.

1135
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,583
My daughter’s getting insecure.

1136
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,416
Mom will never forget you.

1137
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,416
And Avi will love you a lot as well.

1138
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:03,250
Mom, you don’t know anything.

1139
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,083
And dear...

1140
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,291
you don’t know me.

1141
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,083
Just wait and watch...

1142
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:13,875
Avi and I will be inseparable!

1143
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,833
Me?

1144
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:48,625
Sit.

1145
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,208
Are you alright?

1146
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,083
Yes.

1147
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,000
You’re mad...

1148
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,000
at Naina?

1149
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,833
No.

1150
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,333
Is she mad at you?

1151
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,916
-How would I know about her feelings?
-Really?

1152
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,041
They say that if you want
the daughter...

1153
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,625
then you must keep her
mother happy.

1154
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:26,041
And if you like the mother,
you must keep the daughter happy.

1155
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:27,500
Right?

1156
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:31,291
-Are you getting me?
-Yes.

1157
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,541
You are smart.

1158
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:57,083
-How was your date, Rukmini?
-It was amazing.

1159
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,833
You should get a boyfriend as well.

1160
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:02,791
-We can go on a double date.
-Of course.

1161
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:04,458
I am always ready.

1162
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,583
Thank you.

1163
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,666
Everything was going well.

1164
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,166
I mean random conversations.

1165
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,083
But then it happened.

1166
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,041
It?

1167
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:23,791
What happened?

1168
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,375
Uncle.

1169
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,125
Uncle.

1170
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:33,291
-He's with a lady.
-What?

1171
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:41,208
Now there’s good news
and there's some bad news.

1172
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,708
Give me the good news first.

1173
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:47,583
My family didn't see my
so-called girlfriend’s face.

1174
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:49,791
And the bad news?

1175
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:52,166
I am pregnant and it's your child.

1176
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,791
...they want to meet her now.

1177
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:01,875
Let them meet her.

1178
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:03,750
Who? Your mom?

1179
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,166
Her daughter.

1180
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:08,750
I’ll be your girlfriend.

1181
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,500
-You?
-Why?

1182
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:13,708
Am I not good enough?

1183
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:19,041
-I mean, you and me--
-We’ll look like a really cute couple.

1184
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:20,000
Wait, let me show you.

1185
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:29,708
Be careful!

1186
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,291
See... we look so cute.

1187
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:37,541
I look like the crazy type,
and you look so mature.

1188
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,416
Should I wear a traditional
outfit tomorrow?

1189
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:49,375
Yeah, just like I saw you
for the first time.

1190
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,458
Yeah. Since, they'll be
seeing you for the first time.

1191
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:58,291
And, they will never know.

1192
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:01,208
I’ll pretend to be completely
lovestruck.

1193
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,958
Me too.

1194
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,875
In fact, I will be...

1195
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:13,208
the better actor.

1196
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Of course.

1197
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,083
It's just acting.

1198
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:20,500
You did it for me, and
I’ll do it for you.

1199
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,666
It's just acting.

1200
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:35,916
Avi, if my eyes tear up
when I see her...

1201
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:38,000
please don’t be embarrassed.

1202
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,583
Don’t be embarrassed
if I start crying, either.

1203
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,125
No, this is the first time.

1204
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:44,083
I mean tears of joy.

1205
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,625
But where is she?

1206
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,208
Exactly.
Where is she?

1207
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:57,458
-Sonu, isn’t she the same girl?
-Yes, Mom.

1208
01:27:57,708 --> 01:28:01,875
This girl very confidently proclaimed
that she'll never get married.

1209
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,791
Yeah...

1210
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:04,666
And you made her fall for you.

1211
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:06,625
Bravo, son.

1212
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,708
She’s already approved.

1213
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:09,750
-Am I right?
-Yes!

1214
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:13,125
You really proved yourself, Avi.

1215
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:16,291
Auntie! Please.

1216
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,250
Uncle, she isn’t the one
who was on the bike with you?

1217
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:21,958
That's her, Mishti.

1218
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,666
She looks different in a helmet.

1219
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:25,875
Have your juice.

1220
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,291
Namaste.

1221
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:36,166
-That's my mom, my aunt, sister...
-Namaste.

1222
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:48,833
Avi talks about you guys so much...

1223
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:51,166
that I don’t feel like we’re
meeting for the first time.

1224
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:53,041
We’re quiet just because of Avi.

1225
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:54,916
Or else, I can tell you right now,

1226
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,250
-where and when we--
-What?

1227
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,791
It’s nothing.

1228
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:02,916
Auntie is just joking.

1229
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:05,666
You’re looking nice.

1230
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,666
So how do you like my Naina?

1231
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
This is the happiest day of my life.
This is better than...

1232
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,166
the day you were born.

1233
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,083
-Dear...
-What is this?

1234
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:23,750
I can’t take this.

1235
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:26,458
This--

1236
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,750
Mom, I think you’re getting late.

1237
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:40,666
Let's wrap this up.

1238
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,666
We just got here,
and you’re asking us to leave?

1239
01:29:44,958 --> 01:29:47,083
Actually, Naina has to leave as well.

1240
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,125
Her mother is feeling unwell.

1241
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:53,750
-I am so sorry, dear.
-No, she’s okay, Auntie.

1242
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,375
Actually, her mother has
a mental condition, you know.

1243
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:02,791
What?

1244
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:06,208
But Avi, we must meet her mother.

1245
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,916
Why Mom?
What’s the point?

1246
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:13,000
Well, we’ll have to discuss the
wedding with her mother.

1247
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,000
What do you want to discuss?

1248
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,000
You just book a venue and
we’ll be there.

1249
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:17,916
-Right?
-Yes.

1250
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,458
This is not some yoga class.
"We’ll be there."

1251
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,958
I am sure her mother has some opinions.

1252
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:26,375
Auntie, I think it's best not to
ask her mother about her opinion.

1253
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,333
She has a mental--

1254
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,625
What’s wrong, Avi?

1255
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:32,666
-This place is infested with mosquitoes...
-Mosquitoes?

1256
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:35,666
-You go home, dear.
-Okay.

1257
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:38,291
We’ll come over tomorrow for tea.

1258
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:40,208
-Tomorrow evening?
-Tomorrow evening?

1259
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,916
Mom is getting ready.

1260
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,375
She will be down soon.

1261
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:58,500
She takes time to get ready.
Right.

1262
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:00,583
Let’s come back later.

1263
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,500
Yes.

1264
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,250
Come on. Let’s go.

1265
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,500
Sit down.
Sit.

1266
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,875
He’s very shy.

1267
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:12,375
You call that being shy?

1268
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:15,708
They should see our Rukmini.

1269
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:24,875
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk...Ruk...Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What’s wrong with you?</span>

1270
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,333
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>

1271
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:29,000
-Hey... is that her mother?
<span style="style.center_1">-What's wrong with you?</span>

1272
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:35,250
<span style="style.center_1">Ruk... Ruk... Rukmini</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What’s wrong with you?</span>

1273
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:38,125
Well, it can’t be her father
in a sari.

1274
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,041
Namaste.

1275
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,708
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

1276
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,583
Avi, pass the plate.

1277
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:50,208
-Help yourself.
-Thank you, dear.

1278
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,791
How are you feeling now?

1279
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:56,541
What?

1280
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,041
What's wrong with me?

1281
01:31:58,291 --> 01:31:59,791
Avi was saying...

1282
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,583
I am so sorry.
I dropped my glass.

1283
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:06,625
I should be the one who's nervous.

1284
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,583
After all, the groom's family is here.

1285
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,708
-Avi didn’t want us to meet you.
-I see.

1286
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,458
He’s a shy guy.

1287
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:16,083
Maybe he wanted to
surprise everyone.

1288
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:20,458
When Avi first told us
his love story...

1289
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,625
we were really surprised!

1290
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,333
We couldn’t believe it.

1291
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,250
But God works in mysterious ways.

1292
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,750
He has a plan for everyone.

1293
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,208
Yes. Right.

1294
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,500
Mom, can I sit with Auntie?

1295
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:39,583
Of course.

1296
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:41,875
Go on, Mishti.
You don’t need to ask.

1297
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,750
You’ll be sitting next to her
for the rest of your life.

1298
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:45,666
Go on.

1299
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:47,625
Come on, dear.

1300
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:49,541
Come here.

1301
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,000
Come, Mishti.
My child.

1302
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:59,250
So, what do you think about Avi?

1303
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,250
I can't praise him enough.

1304
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,500
Avi’s the only guy in our
entire family...

1305
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:15,666
who has bagged such a
big trophy in love.

1306
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:22,125
I hope you’re happy
with this relationship?

1307
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:23,791
What are you saying?

1308
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:27,333
I hope you don’t have any
objection to his choice?

1309
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,000
Why would we object?

1310
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,583
Our son always wanted a beautiful,
talented and mature girl,

1311
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:35,500
which he got.

1312
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,583
In fact, Avinash deserves
all the credit.

1313
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,833
Ever since he has--

1314
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,875
What happened?

1315
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:48,458
-Are you okay?
-I am fine.

1316
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:50,250
Are these samosas?

1317
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,416
I am allergic to samosa.

1318
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,250
-Allergic to samosa?
-Yes.

1319
01:33:56,375 --> 01:34:00,708
-Since when?
-Since last month.

1320
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:02,083
I’ll keep this in mind.

1321
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:06,333
We’ll never make samosas again.

1322
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:07,916
Take these away.

1323
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:09,833
These samosas are really bad.

1324
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,166
So, shall we leave?

1325
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,375
Sit. Sit.

1326
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,041
We haven’t discussed
the important stuff.

1327
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,083
I was waiting for you to
bring it up.

1328
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:24,500
I feel a little embarrassed to
fix the date of the wedding myself.

1329
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:26,125
That's strange.

1330
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:28,416
You must fix the date.

1331
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:30,791
You guys are really modern people.

1332
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,166
I am so fortunate...

1333
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,916
that I’ll soon be part of your family.

1334
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,250
Me too, Mother.

1335
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:47,166
Now fix a date quickly
and come to Delhi.

1336
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,500
We’ll have a grand wedding.

1337
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:51,708
The girl is so beautiful.

1338
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:53,500
But the relationship between
mother and daughter--

1339
01:34:53,625 --> 01:34:55,083
Hold on. Hold on.

1340
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:58,083
Naina doesn’t know that
you wrote that letter to her.

1341
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:03,375
And Rukmini thinks that you
wrote that letter to her.

1342
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:08,416
Your family thinks that
Naina is your girlfriend.

1343
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:13,291
And Rukmini thinks that
you’re going to marry her.

1344
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:15,416
And you...

1345
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:19,500
love Naina.

1346
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,625
But she doesn’t see that.

1347
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,875
I am in a big mess.

1348
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:29,333
Don’t you see a way out?

1349
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,333
No, there is.

1350
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:32,958
That’s why I am leaving today.

1351
01:35:34,291 --> 01:35:36,000
But today is the café’s
opening ceremony.

1352
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,666
I will leave once it's done.

1353
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:48,666
<span style="style.center_1">Many poets perished...</span>

1354
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:52,833
<span style="style.center_1">Lovers died...</span>

1355
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:57,958
<span style="style.center_1">And Romeos lost</span>

1356
01:35:58,041 --> 01:35:58,958
<span style="style.center_1">-their lives</span>
-Wow, that's great!

1357
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:06,875
<span style="style.center_1">Anyone who dared to</span>
<span style="style.center_1">cross the sea of love...</span>

1358
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:13,541
<span style="style.center_1">drowned in the middle</span>

1359
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,041
Getting me, Son?

1360
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:37,708
<span style="style.center_1">There’s a girl at the party</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Looking so gorgeous</span>

1361
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,583
<span style="style.center_1">There’s a girl at the party</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Looking so gorgeous</span>

1362
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:46,125
<span style="style.center_1">She’s a little traditional, and</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a little modern</span>

1363
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:49,375
<span style="style.center_1">She looks so sweet,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And she packs some heat</span>

1364
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:53,291
<span style="style.center_1">I never thought</span>
<span style="style.center_1">She will be so feisty</span>

1365
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:59,083
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot hot beat...</span>

1366
01:36:59,208 --> 01:37:03,125
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">this sizzler of Shimla</span>

1367
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,833
<span style="style.center_1">She adds sparkle to the party...</span>

1368
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:12,000
<span style="style.center_1">And keeps dancing,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1369
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,500
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot hot beat...</span>

1370
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:20,625
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">this sizzler of Shimla</span>

1371
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:41,125
<span style="style.center_1">You send out two</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Wedding invites</span>

1372
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:44,625
<span style="style.center_1">Your phone’s running two sim-cards</span>

1373
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:48,875
<span style="style.center_1">You have your sights here,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And there as well</span>

1374
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:52,458
<span style="style.center_1">No matter how hard you try to hide,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">But I know</span>

1375
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:55,583
<span style="style.center_1">You have your sights here,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And there as well</span>

1376
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:59,333
<span style="style.center_1">No matter how hard you try to hide,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">But I know</span>

1377
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,458
<span style="style.center_1">She used me,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Confused my heart</span>

1378
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:05,875
<span style="style.center_1">When will she change her flavor</span>

1379
01:38:09,833 --> 01:38:12,000
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot hot beat...</span>

1380
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:16,333
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1381
01:38:18,583 --> 01:38:21,083
<span style="style.center_1">She adds sparkle at the party...</span>

1382
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:24,958
<span style="style.center_1">And keeps dancing,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1383
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,125
<span style="style.center_1">Listen up...</span>

1384
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:33,625
<span style="style.center_1">The year was 1950,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And I was the apple of everyone’s eye</span>

1385
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:35,333
<span style="style.center_1">The boys in the neighborhood</span>

1386
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:37,166
<span style="style.center_1">-Were crazy about me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-What are you saying?</span>

1387
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,500
<span style="style.center_1">Look at my moves</span>

1388
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,333
<span style="style.center_1">Look at me groove</span>

1389
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:42,083
<span style="style.center_1">As I sway my waist</span>

1390
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:43,750
<span style="style.center_1">Their hearts skip a beat</span>

1391
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:48,458
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot hot beat...</span>

1392
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:53,333
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1393
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,333
<span style="style.center_1">She adds sparkle at the party</span>

1394
01:38:57,458 --> 01:39:02,083
<span style="style.center_1">And keeps dancing,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1395
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:05,708
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot-hot beat...</span>

1396
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:10,708
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1397
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:14,500
<span style="style.center_1">She adds sparkle at the party...</span>

1398
01:39:15,041 --> 01:39:19,833
<span style="style.center_1">And keeps dancing,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla.</span>

1399
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:23,250
<span style="style.center_1">As she sways to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Hot-hot beat</span>

1400
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:28,125
<span style="style.center_1">And moves her waist,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1401
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,125
<span style="style.center_1">She adds sparkle at the party</span>

1402
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:37,416
<span style="style.center_1">And keeps dancing,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This sizzler of Shimla</span>

1403
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:03,500
What are you doing here?

1404
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:05,500
Were you expecting someone else?

1405
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,708
You showed me the trailer of
your love...

1406
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:11,875
do you want to show the
movie to someone else?

1407
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,041
That’s not true, Rukmini.

1408
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:20,583
But the situation is such that
I have to leave.

1409
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:24,208
Are you leaving...
or are you running away?

1410
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:26,750
Something like that.

1411
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:31,666
Actually, Ms. Rukmini...

1412
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:38,416
I don't--

1413
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,708
You don’t love me.

1414
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:42,791
But you do love someone else.

1415
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,625
When you met Tilak at the café...

1416
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:51,416
you had at least four drinks.

1417
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:54,750
Two for showing your confidence to Tilak...

1418
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:58,458
and two more for showing
someone how frustrated you are.

1419
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,958
You pretended to be in love
with me because of Naina.

1420
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,916
Because you...

1421
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,458
love her.

1422
01:41:13,625 --> 01:41:14,625
How do you know?

1423
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,708
What do I call you now?
Daughter?

1424
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:24,833
Flowers.

1425
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:35,625
I also know that Naina’s
secretly watching us.

1426
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:47,333
I did take my daughter’s advice
and got carried away.

1427
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:49,750
Maybe, that was the right
thing to do back then.

1428
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:53,041
But now I am in my senses.

1429
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:55,916
I won’t let her get
carried away.

1430
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,875
I won’t tell her that you love her.

1431
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:09,541
Always love the one who loves you.

1432
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,916
And trusts you more than herself.

1433
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:32,583
Where are you going?

1434
01:42:33,125 --> 01:42:34,125
Back where I came from.

1435
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:37,583
What did Mom say?

1436
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,208
She said that she got
carried away...

1437
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:43,166
but now she’s in her senses.

1438
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:47,708
Why are you leaving suddenly?

1439
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:51,916
Actually, there's something...

1440
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,041
In fact, I had a lot to say to you.

1441
01:42:56,541 --> 01:42:57,666
What do you want to say, Naina?

1442
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:05,083
You have done a lot for me.

1443
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:11,416
And sorry that you didn't find

1444
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,250
your dream girl...

1445
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,500
the one you came to Shimla for.

1446
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,958
Actually, I did find her, Naina.

1447
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:23,708
But I could never get her.

1448
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:30,416
Who?

1449
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:35,791
Forget it.

1450
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:38,625
Your café’s open now.
And your mom’s back to normal.

1451
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,458
Everything that happened
between us--

1452
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:50,416
Did anything happen between us, Naina?

1453
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:55,750
I mean all the problems that we had...

1454
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,875
So, is that all we had?

1455
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,333
No.

1456
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:06,666
It’s...

1457
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:09,875
It’s that stupid letter
writer’s fault.

1458
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:11,958
That’s where all the problems started.

1459
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:25,875
I’ll solve this problem for
you as well.

1460
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:28,875
You won’t be getting
letters anymore, Naina.

1461
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:32,791
Your stupid letter writer
is leaving.

1462
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:55,875
<span style="style.center_1">It was your heartbeat in my heart</span>

1463
01:44:56,125 --> 01:45:00,625
<span style="style.center_1">But I couldn't see it</span>

1464
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:07,625
<span style="style.center_1">Your love was keeping me alive</span>

1465
01:45:08,166 --> 01:45:12,083
<span style="style.center_1">But I didn't realize</span>

1466
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:19,000
<span style="style.center_1">Everyone else knew...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Except me</span>

1467
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:25,333
<span style="style.center_1">How much you loved me</span>

1468
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:28,708
<span style="style.center_1">But how could I not know</span>

1469
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:33,958
<span style="style.center_1">That you love me?</span>

1470
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:42,458
<span style="style.center_1">How could I not know</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That you’re waiting for me?</span>

1471
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:18,125
<span style="style.center_1">I’m looking everywhere for you</span>

1472
01:46:18,458 --> 01:46:23,708
<span style="style.center_1">And trying to trace your footsteps</span>

1473
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:30,166
<span style="style.center_1">The tears of joy...</span>

1474
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:35,333
<span style="style.center_1">Never ever dry up</span>

1475
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:41,125
<span style="style.center_1">Since this distance has become</span>
<span style="style.center_1">So unbearable...</span>

1476
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:47,125
<span style="style.center_1">My heart is afraid to live on</span>

1477
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:55,291
<span style="style.center_1">But how could I not know</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That you love me?</span>

1478
01:46:56,125 --> 01:47:03,958
<span style="style.center_1">How could I not know</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That you’re waiting for me?</span>

1479
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:19,458
Such guys should be
publicly shamed.

1480
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:21,250
God knows how many more hearts
will he break.

1481
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:26,166
Mom... what’s wrong with you today?

1482
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:29,500
That idiot Avinash tried to
flirt with me first.

1483
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:31,750
Then he broke your heart and
ran away.

1484
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:35,333
He did it for me, and you know that.

1485
01:47:35,541 --> 01:47:36,666
Yes, I know.

1486
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:40,500
He tried really hard to make
you happy.

1487
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:42,041
But what was the result?

1488
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:44,125
If he wanted to see you happy,

1489
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:45,291
he should’ve done it properly.

1490
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,250
He should’ve stayed back.

1491
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:48,791
You’re being really hard on him.

1492
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:52,333
For the past one week...

1493
01:47:52,625 --> 01:47:55,541
you’ve been sleeping in my room,
your mother’s room.

1494
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:56,791
Holding me tight.

1495
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,333
All this while, you took care of me.

1496
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:00,875
And now I’ve to look after you.

1497
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,250
And all this for a letter.

1498
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:05,458
Hey!

1499
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:06,541
What’s this?

1500
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:08,541
Didn't you notice this?

1501
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:11,916
If this was for me,
I would’ve thrown it away.

1502
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,583
-When did this arrive?
-I don’t know.

1503
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:15,916
I’ve stopped reading letters.

1504
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:17,375
And you don’t read it either.

1505
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,875
Stay out of this mess.

1506
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:21,833
And listen, get ready.

1507
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,000
Don’t you have a café to run?

1508
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:56,666
Children, what will you do,
when Uncle and Auntie enter?

1509
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,750
Throw flowers.

1510
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:03,541
Hi, Auntie.

1511
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:06,458
Mishti says absurd things.

1512
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:11,583
Didn't I tell you?
See Naina’s here.

1513
01:49:11,666 --> 01:49:13,666
That’s not what you said,
sister-in-law.

1514
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:16,625
You asked whether Naina will
show up or not?

1515
01:49:16,958 --> 01:49:19,083
But I knew that Naina will
show up.

1516
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:23,250
Why wouldn't she?
After all, this is Avi’s wedding.

1517
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:26,083
Where is Avi?

1518
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,625
Sorry, but I was just rehearsing
dance moves with my friends.

1519
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:55,208
Wait a second.
How am I looking?

1520
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:01,833
You look very happy.

1521
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:03,625
Well, I have a reason to
be happy.

1522
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:07,291
But... when did you get here?

1523
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,833
Just now.

1524
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:14,833
I am getting married!

1525
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:17,541
This is my first wedding.

1526
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,333
What is it?

1527
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:38,208
This marriage was fixed
by your family, right?

1528
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:41,458
So...

1529
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,500
why are you so happy?

1530
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:45,208
Why do you look so excited?

1531
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,291
It's the excitement of
getting the one I love.

1532
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:48,291
And don’t hit me.

1533
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:49,750
I am not that same old Avi anymore.

1534
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:54,416
Is she really very beautiful?

1535
01:50:55,833 --> 01:50:58,833
Yes, Naina. She’s very beautiful.
Like an angel.

1536
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:03,000
I mean... big black eyes.

1537
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:05,583
Pink lips.

1538
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:07,458
That’s how Mom described her.

1539
01:51:07,583 --> 01:51:08,416
She’s the one who saw her.

1540
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,208
And do you know what Sonu
was saying?

1541
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:13,125
Whoever marries her...

1542
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:17,833
And your aunt?
She must have said something as well.

1543
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:23,208
Totally sexy, dude.

1544
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:25,291
So Avi... do I have pale eyes.

1545
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,166
Or rugged lips.

1546
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:28,875
And my figure?

1547
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:32,291
-Don’t I look sexy?
-Naina, what are you doing?

1548
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:33,958
Naina, there are people around.

1549
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:43,166
Avi, I know I think I am
very smart and clever.

1550
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,291
But I am very stupid.

1551
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:50,625
When you helped me with the café
and the accounts...

1552
01:51:51,291 --> 01:51:53,875
I should’ve known how special you are.

1553
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:03,708
I could’ve googled you
when you spoke in Japanese, at least

1554
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:10,375
And all the time you were with me,

1555
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:13,208
I should’ve realized it back then.

1556
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:20,708
If you would've confessed your love...

1557
01:52:20,958 --> 01:52:23,166
maybe, I would’ve lost my
temper, but I...

1558
01:52:24,708 --> 01:52:26,083
would’ve understood your
feelings eventually.

1559
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:29,333
And all this wouldn't have...

1560
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,916
So, after all this... it's still my fault.

1561
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:36,250
No.

1562
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:38,958
You're impossible.

1563
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:44,583
Avi, wait.

1564
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:47,458
Is that your problem?
That I could never go beyond "I"?

1565
01:52:48,208 --> 01:52:49,208
And why should I?

1566
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,166
Can’t you see my emotions?

1567
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:54,291
And why do I have to say it
if it’s clearly visible?

1568
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:59,500
A decent, well-educated guy
was sweeping your café floor.

1569
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:01,250
Instead of playing golf on
sundays,

1570
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:03,500
he’s cleaning your chimneys,
and you still didn’t get it.

1571
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:08,375
Don’t say that.

1572
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:10,166
-You think all this is a joke?
-No.

1573
01:53:11,666 --> 01:53:14,166
Naina, the fact is,
that I am getting married.

1574
01:53:29,416 --> 01:53:30,250
These.

1575
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:33,416
Your mom gave me these bracelets.

1576
01:53:37,083 --> 01:53:38,166
Let me help you with that.

1577
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:45,125
Don't say another word to
my daughter.

1578
01:53:48,041 --> 01:53:49,416
Just because she bothered you...

1579
01:53:49,958 --> 01:53:54,166
that doesn't give you the right...
to bother her.

1580
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,083
What should I do with your daughter?

1581
01:53:57,958 --> 01:54:00,375
When I give her a love letter,
she passes it on like a football.

1582
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:03,000
And what have I done?
I'm just blabbering.

1583
01:54:03,791 --> 01:54:05,125
In fact, I’ve been blabbering
since the day we met.

1584
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,375
But for the first time, she's
blabbering.

1585
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,500
And doesn't know that she’s
the scapegoat.

1586
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:12,375
Scapegoat.

1587
01:54:14,083 --> 01:54:16,625
And I am really stupid.

1588
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:25,500
I could never tell you that
I can be anyone for you.

1589
01:54:25,583 --> 01:54:26,625
Naina, I can do anything for you.

1590
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:27,541
Like?

1591
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:29,625
I am so restless without you...

1592
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:32,583
whether I'm in Shimla, or in Delhi.

1593
01:54:32,916 --> 01:54:34,333
And so is my heart.

1594
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:38,333
And that’s why I want to say this
in everyone’s presence...

1595
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:39,541
that...

1596
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,458
Not fair, Grandma.

1597
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:03,458
Hey...

1598
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:08,708
Wow, Rukmini.
Your plan was...

1599
01:55:12,125 --> 01:55:14,708
Please, get them married quickly.

1600
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,583
Tell me something.

1601
01:55:25,125 --> 01:55:29,750
Avinash, our son-in-law, what does he do?

1602
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:33,375
He’s the language translator for
the External Affairs Minister.

1603
01:55:58,791 --> 01:56:00,333
I must leave now, son.

1604
01:56:00,958 --> 01:56:01,958
Sir, it’s my wedding.

1605
01:56:02,166 --> 01:56:03,666
You must have a drink.

1606
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:06,375
Isn’t that Rukmini?

1607
01:56:07,416 --> 01:56:11,250
-What is she doing here?
-She’s my mother-in-law.

1608
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,083
Sit.

1609
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,250
Years ago, when you were just 20...

1610
01:56:30,166 --> 01:56:32,166
and you would walk down the street...

1611
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:33,833
people would keenly wait
to catch a glimpse of you.

1612
01:56:33,958 --> 01:56:35,375
You would make their hearts skip a beat.

1613
01:56:35,833 --> 01:56:39,958
-And I was one of those Romeos.
-I see...

1614
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:43,500
-I wrote many letters to you.
-Really?

1615
01:56:43,666 --> 01:56:47,458
Yes...
but I never had the guts to send them.

1616
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:53,291
And then one day I found out
that you were married.

1617
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:57,541
And I also found out that you
didn't have a happy marriage.

1618
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:01,958
Someone's been doing their homework!

1619
01:57:02,208 --> 01:57:04,833
<span style="style.center_1">It’s love after all,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Although one-sided...</span>

1620
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:07,083
<span style="style.center_1">But it’s true love</span>

1621
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:16,625
Well... Rukmini,
what have you thought about your future?

1622
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:17,833
I will give it a thought.

1623
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:21,125
I hope that you don’t take too long
to think...

1624
01:57:22,416 --> 01:57:26,625
and I’ll have to climb up
some water tank,

1625
01:57:26,708 --> 01:57:29,708
jump down, and die.
