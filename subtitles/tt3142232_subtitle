People from 36 villages draw inspiration from you

163
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,493

I didn't know Rakesh would do such a thing

183
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,674
If I had any clue..

184
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,144
..then I would've strangled him myself.

185
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,203
Get up

186
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,005
Who is he?

187
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,345
Rakesh's friend

188
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,817
Three years ago they Studied together in Delhi

189
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,220
Get lost.
- Whenever someone elopes..

190
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,249
..their friends definitely know.

191
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,564
Hey, who are you?
- Move aside.

192
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,305
Hello, who are you?

193
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,432
Are you Jitesh Jaiswal?

194
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,408
Yes..

195
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,340

211
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,542

213
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,019
Sir please, ask Bablu sir

214
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,054
Who's the one they are speaking about?

215
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,217
That boy seems clever

216
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,124
He's very cunning

217
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,796
We sent our boys after him.

218
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,524
But he's never at home

219
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,159
Kidnap him..get him.

220
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,597
Okay sir

221
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,565

Get the cars

223
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,738

224
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,245

225
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,186

226
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,763
Take few more along..

227
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,866
ls he so tough?

228
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,128
No, he's an entire army.

229
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,652
Are you Bablu?

230
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,992
You didn't have to corner me to ask that

231
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,295
Where can we find Rakesh?

232
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,657
Which Rakesh?

233
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,398
Rakesh Gupta? Rakesh Tiwari?

234
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,629
Rakesh Roshan?

235
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,061
Which Rakesh?

236
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,868
The one who studied with you

237
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,635
He eloped with our niece.

238
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,500
What are you saying?

239
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,669
Rakesh!

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,673
Rakesh eloped with a girl!

241
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,956
This calls for a celebration.

242
00:13:57,982 --> 00:13:59,536
I'll have to tell everyone about it.

243
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,286
Listen up..

244
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,623
Son...this is Blackberry

245
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,930
Doesn't give miss calls

246
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,765
Connects directly.

247
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,639
Don't push

248
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,175
Mister, why use your hands when we can talk?

249
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,240
Why? What will you do?

250
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,045
Will you hit us?

251
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,320
Hit us? Hit

252
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,296
I didn't think about it

253
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,462
But I will have to now

254
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,936
Oh...so you've a big attitude

255
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,338
What to do?

256
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,366
Others can't use it

257
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,607
I can't lose it.

258
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,275
Son, just tell us...
Otherwise we'll waste you

259
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,311
Fine

260
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,552
Okay

261
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,847
I'll tell you

262
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,947
Choose one

263
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,887
Hold on. No one interferes

264
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,895
- I'll choose
- Yes please

265
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,625
This one.

266
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,925
Where are you hiding those two?

267
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,899
Who hit me from behind?

268
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,438
Tell us where's our daughter?

269
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,499
First who hit me from behind?

270
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,732
Tell us.

271
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,673
Where's our daughter?

272
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,310
Tell us.

273
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,538
Tell us where she is.

274
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,674
Quiet!

275
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,754
Speak one by one.

276
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,187
Or let it be.

277
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,720
Look.

278
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,719
Your daughter eloped from home, didn't she?

279
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,125
She didn't runaway to become P.T Usha

280
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,134
I'm sure she eloped with the boy she loved

281
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,336
She eloped to get married.

282
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,273
She wouldn't have eloped..

283
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,470
..if you would've allowed her to choose her groom.

284
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,471
He was showing the same attitude back there

285
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,611
Back there I hit you on the head from behind

286
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,244
But here I will knock your head off.

287
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,014
Hey enough..

288
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,451
Come on...

289
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,584
...give me Rakesh's address

290
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,358
You want Rakesh's address

291
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,258
Okay

292
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,894
Let's do one thing

293
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,096
Whenever he calls I'll let you know.

294
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,872
Give me your cell number

295
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,607
What's wrong?

296
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,296
Don't have one

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,880
Okay... I'll post a letter for you

298
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,410
See you.. Okay. Thanks.

299
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,045
Wait!

300
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,071
Understand one thing clearly

301
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,442
Until I don't find my daughter"

302
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,320
..you will stay here.

303
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,620
Get in

304
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,427
Close the door

305
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,325
Bablu..

306
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,796
Bablu..

307
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,926
You too?

308
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,338
With friends like you, who needs enemies?

309
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,437
Who took my name?

310
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,806
He did

311
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,173
He..

312
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,339
Come on

313
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,113
Bablu..

314
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,781
What happened?

315
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,819
Thank God you're here

316
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,359
Save us

317
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,485
Don't be scared

318
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,788
I am here

319
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,790
I won't let anything happen to you

320
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,762
They ruined my face

321
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,428
If you show your face only on Facebook..

322
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,576
..then this is bound to happen to you

323
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,403
You're joking

324
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,547
Bablu

325
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,210
Rascal

326
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,145
We are in such a situation and you are thinking about reunion

327
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,446
- You..
- Leave me

328
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,646
Excuse me

329
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,957
Can ljoin in too?

330
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,486
Who are you?

331
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,621
lam Kiki

332
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,790
I live in London

333
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,133
I came to India for the first time

334
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,170
All I asked these Jats was a lift..

335
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,500
..but they thrashed me up

336
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,006
And kidnapped me.

337
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,667
It's all because of his red pants.

338
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,904
The Jet's tantric must have told them to find a man..

339
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,007
..wearing red pants in the north direction.

340
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,548
He'll know Rakesh's address

341
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,049
- Kiki
- Yeah!

342
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,689
Do you know where Rakesh is?

343
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,754
I don't know about Rakesh

344
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,123
How would he know?

345
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,025
Yeah!

346
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,688
- We thought you do
- I don't know

347
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,222
Oh hell

348
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,627
We are in a big trouble

349
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,859
See

350
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,663
I warned you in college that he's a big flirt

351
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,432
Fine, let's just sit around here

352
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,239
Listen. Listen. Listen.

353
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,105
You can find a way out

354
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,576
Yes, please Get us out of here

355
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,708
Yeah, please

356
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,950
Then choose one

357
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,418
Enough of you

358
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,552
Can I choose?

359
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,453
No

360
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,649
This one

361
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,122
Good

362
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,964
Let's party tomorrow...in DU

363
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:35,963
He started again

364
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,557
Like old times

365
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,433
The same attitude again.

366
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,230
What to do?

367
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,807
Others don't use it

368
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,139
And you can't lose it We know. We know.

369
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,105
But you don't know..

370
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,416
"that your hero has found his heroine.

371
00:22:55,006 --> 00:23:00,922
"Like the lost moon...
shying away"

372
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:07,058
"A shattered dream...
which was only for you"

373
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:13,635
"An incomplete hope...
which found reason again"

374
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:20,475
"Since I found you...
we've still been miles apart"

375
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:25,982
"My heart's restless.."

376
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:31,043
"Without you. Without you"

377
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,353
Who is she?

378
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,140
What's her name?

379
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,243
Where does she live?

380
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,815
That's all I don't know

381
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,383
Everything else is all set

382
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,952
Excuse me. Excuse me.

383
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,587
We were making a plan to runaway

384
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,656
So what is the position?

385
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,102
Simple

386
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,302
A slow train leaves from the outskirts of this village

387
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,107
Tomorrow morning we escape from here

388
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,137
And then we get on the train

389
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,775
In the train I will tell about rest of the plan.

390
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,554
Listen"

391
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,719
Any plans on coming back?

392
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,321
Are you crazy?

393
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,927
Why will we come back?

394
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,798
I need to take care of business.

395
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,960
Bablu, hey stop.

396
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,107
Hey, who is there?

397
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,103
- Take this
- Hey I...

398
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,047
- Help..Help..
- Move quickly

399
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,689
Who is there?

400
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,023
I will not spare you, who are you?

401
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:55,221
"l yearned for you always"

402
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,702
"Your memories were fresh in my heart every moment"

403
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:08,078
"An incomplete hope...
which found reason again"

404
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,416
"Since I found you...
we've still been miles apart"

405
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:21,152
"My heart's restless.."

406
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:26,863
"My heart's restless.."

407
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:32,732
"Without you. Without you"

408
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:38,966
"Without you. Without you"

409
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:45,908
"Without you. Without you"

410
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,946
Quickly, train has come.

411
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,048
- Where is Bablu?
- I don't know

412
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,113
He was behind only, along with us

413
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,920
- Where is Bablu?
- Bablu!

414
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,587
The train's leaving

415
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,993
Some one stop it

416
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,498
Come on, Bablu!

417
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,425
- Bablu!
- Bablu!

418
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,700
The train has left, oh no

419
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,700
Bablu the train is leaving

420
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,071
- What are you doing?
- Oh no

421
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,172
Bablu, It's gone.

422
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,604
Come on. Bablu..

423
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,042
Come on. Bablu..
- The train is leaving.

424
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,905
Bablu, let's go!
- The train is leaving.

425
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,917
Hurry up!
We'll miss the train

426
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,111
Come on hurry up!

427
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,078
Stand in a line.

428
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,607
So...these are the fools that escaped.

429
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,646
Fatty

430
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,583
Scoundrel

431
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,755
You..

432
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,057
Don't you dare!

433
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,924
So you're their hero!

434
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,100
I'll burn you in the furnace

435
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,733
No one will know where you disappeared

436
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,102
Rajjo enough!

437
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,452
You're a big goon, aren't you?

438
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,053
What? They were in your custody, aren't they?

439
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,593
They were in your custody, aren't they?

440
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,386
How did they escape?

441
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,356
These boys will die sooner or later.

442
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,598
But I might end up killing you.

443
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,537
Don't ever think of running away again.

444
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,639
Don't worry

445
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:04,181
We won't leave until that girl isn't found

446
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,485
He has an attitude

447
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,325
Let's see

448
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,563
Look, enough of your big attitude.

449
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,664
Why did you have to stop?

450
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,136
I didn't, she stopped me

451
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,028
Who?

452
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,604
That girl

453
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,607
She lives in this village

454
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,044
Bro...this is Jat Land

455
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,680
It's forbidden to even think about their girls.

456
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,619
I can find you one if you come to London.

457
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,011
After meeting her..

458
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,621
..l don't need anyone else.

459
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,593
Have you lost your mind?

460
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,422
Maybe..

461
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,024
I don't know

462
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,265
Feels like every-thing's stopped

463
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,696
You mean constipation types

464
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,531
Will you shut up?

465
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,268
Okay, okay. I'm shut up

466
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,071
But what is the position now?

467
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,778
First we must find out who that girl is

No, no

489
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,491
This news shouldn't be out in the newspapers.

490
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,621
Bless you, dear

491
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,625
May you be successful in your efforts today

492
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,221
They are relatives of master"

493
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,426
..keep an eye on them.

494
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,633
There was a shootout!

495
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,568
Few died on the spot

496
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,534
It was fun

497
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,411
Where is daddy's dearest girl going?

498
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,678
College

499
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,613
To submit my Home Science Project

500
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,685
Your sister submitted many such Home Science projects

501
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,081
Aren't you ashamed?

502
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,120
Your sister ran away and you're going to college

503
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,250
What nonsense?
Renu's the one who ran away

504
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,316
Shut up!

505
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,118
Wild one. Go inside.

506
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,656
And no more college

507
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,592
Home Science

508
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,665
She ran away and they are stopping me from going to college.

509
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,030
DirﬂPY

510
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,498
Stop going to college

511
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,771
Learn cooking

512
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,741
Brother Rajjo, don't you have a home?

513
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,511
You're always lying around here

514
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,942
Listen

515
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,274
Don't call me brother

516
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,382
Soon we'll be related in a different way

517
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,945
How's that?

518
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,282
Are you making me your mother?

519
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,516
I will make you mother of my kids.

520
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,272
See papa, they are stopping me from going to college.

521
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,506
Everyone suspects that"

522
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,476
..even I will run away like Renu.

523
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,315
No, my child

524
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,313
I trust you

525
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,153
Renu wouldn't have eloped either

526
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,286
That boy misled her

527
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,561
Fooled her

528
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,598
How can my daughter elope?

529
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,601
Remember...

530
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,234
...when you were small..

531
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,604
..you used to play with my moustache.

532
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,439
I used to keep my moustache down..

533
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,977
..and you turn it up.

534
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,909
You couldn't see your father's moustache down.

535
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,782
I wish...

536
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,184
...my daughter had not eloped.

537
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:36,597
Papa, I'll never do what Renu did.

538
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,601
Do you trust me?

539
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,971
So please let me go to college.

540
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,211
Let's talk later

541
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,646
Papa, please..

542
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,784
Okay, Papa

543
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,549
Go.

544
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes, you were saying something

545
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:08,190
Tradition says those who indulge in love marriage..

546
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,926
...will be killed by their own family.

547
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,492
My daughter didn't run away, she was misled

548
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:26,611
And if she eloped willingly, then I'll burn her alive.

549
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,248
You don't do anything

550
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,380
These uncles and aunts"

551
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,251
"they had fun when it was their time

552
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,551
But when it's my time they declared an emergency.

553
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,557
- As if..
- Why?

554
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,459
Don't you have fun secretly?

555
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,863
What do I do?

556
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,196
I just lie to go to college

557
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,199
I don't lie to go around with boys

558
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,735
That's exactly what I am wondering

559
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,304
Don't you want to?

560
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,098
I don't have time for such nonsense.

561
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,308
I have two years, for myself

562
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,873
To enjoy my freedom

563
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,346
I've to complete my college Learn dancing

564
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,109
Become Miss. Haryana

565
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,314
And then marry whoever papa chooses..

566
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,984
..and have a kid every year.

567
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,850
If I stop going to college..

568
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,087
..then what about my two year plan?

569
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,363
I hope Renu gets caught

570
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,356
Her husband leaves her on the night of their honeymoon

571
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,193
I hope she comes back crying

572
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,361
<i>T ha‘ baud: h</i>

573
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,028
She escaped herself... and left me in a coop.

574
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,739
They made me leave college

575
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,672
You can resume college only after Renu is caught.

576
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,439
And those boys know where Renu is..

577
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,104
..and they will never tell us.

578
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,974
Of course they will. I'll deal with them.

579
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,788
So what is the position?

580
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,389
Good.

581
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,532
There are just 300 houses in the village

582
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,999
It's not that difficult to find the girl

583
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,263
There's a crematorium as well

584
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,937
Your cremation won't be difficult

585
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,301
Excuse me

586
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,972
Hello! Listen! Excuse me.

587
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:00,395
English in Jat Land?

588
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,137
<i>A Sin-g?</i>

589
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,046
Although I never entertain boys..

590
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,514
..but now I have no option

591
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,675
Just tell me where my sister is.

592
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,547
I am not interested in your waist

593
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,693
Show me your face

594
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,751
You..

595
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,434
Look. Tell me.

596
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,533
I won't tell anyone. Honestly!

597
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,264
Okay, listen

598
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,700
Yes

599
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,173
Your sister"

600
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,868
Okay

601
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,104
And her boyfriend..

602
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,210
Okay

603
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,745
The place they are hiding..

604
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,211
- We don't know.
- Okay.

605
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,383
You think you're a hero?

606
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,855
People say it

607
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,060
I can't stop everyone from talking

608
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,495
Look...my entire family is in trouble because of you.

609
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,193
Not because of me, blame your father.

610
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,702
Don't dare insult my father

611
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,403
There can't be a better man than him

612
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,995
I see

613
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,935
Then why did your sister leave him?

614
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,708
And if I tell you..

615
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,711
..imagine what will happen to them when they are caught?

616
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,672
So?

617
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,151
They ruined the family name They will have to be punished

618
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,681
If they are wrong then who's right?

619
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,348
Me. And my Papa

620
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,686
There's one more

621
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,687
- Who?
- Me

622
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,522
Then we should help each other

623
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,064
I mean we're both in trouble"

624
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,034
..because of those two

625
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,666
Right?

626
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,063
- Then do one thing

627
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:41,193
- Hold on. Please..

628
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,576
- Come on...don't..
- Let him speak

629
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,547
Whatever it is, we'll do it together. Speak up.

630
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,974
Okay, I'll find your sister.

631
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,681
Okay

632
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:52,944
And you find that girl

633
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,990
Girl?

634
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,287

Love?

636
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,922

But maybe

638
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,692
Who knows...

639
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,330
How dare you

640
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,399
You want some other family to face the same plight as ours

641
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,495
And again some girl will be stopped from going to college.

642
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,702
Just wait and watch I'll go tell papa

643
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,937

She is going. Stop her.

647
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,214
"Paste this photo on your chest"

648
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,251
He's been here for just two days..

649
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,649
..and already in love.

650
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,683
And look at his audacity

651
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,515
He's asking for my help

652
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,225
I felt like kicking him.

653
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:34,760
What are you doing?

654
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:35,885

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,024

Yours, Rakesh!

665
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,491
Why did that b***h hide it here?

666
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,320
Pick everything up quickly

667
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,924
Switch off the fan It's scattering everywhere

668
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,973
Oh no

669
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,071
This is serious

670
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,912
Bhuppi uncle has got his hand's on one of the letters.

671
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,418
Hide them

672
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,920
They even kissed

673
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,251
"Touch me! Touch me! Touch me!"

674
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,555
"Kiss me.."

675
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,336
This isn't the time to enjoy.

676
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:41,318
Hide them quickly.

677
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,025
Quickly!

678
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,865
What are you doing?

679
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,073
Where's Dimpy?

680
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,473
She must be in her room Why?

681
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,909
Here
Throw them away

682
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,810
No. Burn them. Burn them.

00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,474
- Who me?
- No me. Go quickly

684
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,512
DirﬂPY

685
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,516
What's this?

686
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,387
What?

687
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,083
Your sister's love letter.

688
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,583
I see

689
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,887
So that's how they look.

690
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,529
I never saw one..

691
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,005
You...stop

692
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,042
What's in that?

693
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,776
Nothing

694
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,673
-Tenna
-Sir

695
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,553
Check what's in the basket.

696
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,713
Ok sir

697
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,204
What's in the basket?

698
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,369
Nothing

699
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,465
Nothing

700
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,376
It's nothing, just rubbish

701
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,577
If I find out someone else was involved..

702
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,847
...I'll shoot them

703
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,054
This is amazing

704
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,889
Love letters in the age of mobiles

705
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,653
- How romantic
- Show us

706
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,922
- Love letter.

707
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,432
Rakesh was really desperate

708
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,065
Time to show off!

709
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,430
Hey Kiki, we can get out of here...
see the letters

710
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,473
Look here

711
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,470
Call that Chaudhary

712
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,608
Quiet!

713
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,474
Call your father

714
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,010
These letters clearly indicate"

715
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:50,582
"that you played a role in your sister's love story

716
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,352
Now we'll tell him

717
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,657
We'll...tell...him

718
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,331
You will do whatever we say

719
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,660
Listen. Please. See...

720
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,703
We don't want to see all this

721
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:04,972
God!

722
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,063
Look..

723
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,740
Look, don't try to blackmail me

724
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,577
Till now I didn't

725
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,308
But now I will

726
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,184
But I had no clue about Renu's affair.

727
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,820
But...it's clearly written in these letters.

728
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,391
"that you watched English films with them

729
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,388
Sometimes...

730
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,190
And also took your sister's share of pocket money to keep quiet

731
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,391
Sometimes...

732
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,131
But I didn't know she would run away

733
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,169
I see

734
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,400
Yes honestly, I didn't know

735
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,241
So you mean to say..

736
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,267
Falling in love is right"

737
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,012
..but love-marriage is a sin!

738
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,104
Now I get it

739
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,516
Whatever tarnishes family honor is a sin.

740
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,654
So why did you help Renu run away?

741
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,023
Where's that written?

742
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,428
It's not

743
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,857
But what if I write it?

744
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,293
What nonsense

745
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,132
God. You're such a rascal

746
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,862

Forget your papa and think about me

779
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,043
Think about the one I love

780
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,369
By the way...

781
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,080

Okay I won't, don't do this Its over acting

812
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,545
What are you doing?

813
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,844
Hey you..

814
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,748
Choose one

815
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,254
- I won't
- Come on please do it

816
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:01,916
Can I?

817
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,324
Okay. This one

818
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,120
But what is the position?

819
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,459
I am going

820
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:08,655
Where?

821
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,330
Chaudhary's house

822
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,465
Why didn't I think of it before?

823
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,693
Hold on

824
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,030
What if we had chosen the other one?

825
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,201
Then I would've talked to Chaudhary directly.

826
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:22,776
You're crazy

827
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,369
Why you always put us in trouble?

828
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,744
You may listen if you want.

829
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,106
N--

830
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,815
Love..

831
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,755
I love what?

832
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,490
I'm not in the mood.

833
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,284
"Without Dimpy's love Rajjo is sad"

834
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,352
Shut up!

835
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,791
Dimpy was just in 5th grade..

836
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,061
..when I decided that she'll be my wife.

837
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,962
If her sister hadn't eloped..

838
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,670
..we would've been enjoying our honeymoon

839
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,967
I would be kissing her

840
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,044
Chaudhary sir has given his word

841
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,510
What will I do with his promise?

842
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,020
Oh God!

843
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,652
What happened to the lights?

844
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,187
You're drunk, brother-in-law

845
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,124
- Tenne
- Let me check sir

846
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,339
Finished?

847
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,536
Yes, sir

848
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,328
The TV's switched off

849
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,058
It was a nice song

850
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:54,496
"Without Dimpy's love Rajjo is sad"

851
00:49:54,858 --> 00:50:01,241
"This chaudhary doesn't listen to what is being said."

852
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,072
Where's the bottle?

853
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,736
It's next to the glass

854
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,610
Where's the bottle?

855
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,407
Em ptY

856
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,418
The glass is empty

857
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,552
Forget it

858
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,317
Here. Have some fritters

859
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,088
Give me the fries

860
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,388
Brother-in-law, you're trying to fool me

861
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,422
What are you saying?

862
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:24,588
There were some fritters left

863
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,530
Right

864
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,461
Who said that?

865
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,356
I did. What will you do?

866
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,171
You slapped me!

867
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,169
Turn your face that side while talking, you spit while talking.

868
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,570
Do you have any respect at home?

869
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,736
Go home

870
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,447
Brother-in-law, I will teach you a lesson

871
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,413
Go home.

872
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,704
Hey"

873
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,377
Listen up, girl

874
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,813
You didn't find that girl

875
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,383
You're good for nothing.

876
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,186
Now...

877
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,423
...I'll tell your father..

878
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,891
"that you had a role in Renu's love story

879
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,433
Now get UP

880
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,405
Couldn't even find a girl.

881
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,164
What are you doing here?

882
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,431
Are you crazy?

883
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,373
Damn this electricity!

884
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,382
You?

885
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,245
Who was that?

886
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,252
You fool...that was Shalu.

887
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,015
Ohh...yes..

888
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,687
Wait here. I'll go apologise.

889
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,316
What are you doing?

890
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:03,653
Can't even see anything

891
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,530
You'll get us both killed

892
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,600
Where has she gone?

893
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,273
You're drunk

894
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,702
Maybe?

895
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,971
Maybe?
Where did you get it?

896
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,875
Coming

897
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,681
Stay here

898
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,807
- Don't move.
- Okay.

899
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,681
I'll be right back Don't move

900
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,352
I can't see his face

901
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,421
Did someone call the emergency helpline?

902
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,672
There's electricity in the village.

903
00:52:30,698 --> 00:52:31,380
Why don't we?

904
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,583
Sukhi, go check the meter.

905
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,264
Where did he go?

906
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:42,497
"The water is chilly.."

907
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:47,833
"And the day is sunny.."

908
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,777
"Come to the beach, click my photograph"

909
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,848
Stop singing

910
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,346
sorfY

911
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,910
Did you come here to take a bath?

912
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:04,282
I've been locked up in that coop for so many days

913
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,020
What if I find that girl tomorrow?

914
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,828
He and his damn girl

915
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,661
She won't like me

916
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,961
Yeah right

917
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,536
If she wants to embrace me then?

918
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,406
But you haven't found her yet, you good-for-nothing.

919
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,843
It hurts

920
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,410
Get out

921
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,251
We'll all die.

922
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,654
- Here
- What are you doing?

923
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,752
Just giving you her memorabilia

924
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,757
Find her in 24 hours

925
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:43,987
Fine, leave

926
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,000
Or else I'll tell your father

927
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,764
I know.

I am going

929
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,837
Don't know about her beauty but figure is good

930
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,770
Stupid. Fool

931
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,553
Listen

932
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,489
Put a lantern in Dimpy's room

933
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,027
Sukhi. He was here

934
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,468
Who?

935
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,061

936
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,238

937
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,671
He hit me again

938
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,235
H ow?

939
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,366

940
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,971
The boys are locked up in the shed

941
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,639
You have been drinking too much

942
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:40,382
Please Lord... help that crazy boy find that girl

943
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,485

946
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,479
Hey, take these guys out of the shed

00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,715
Come, take these guys out of the shed

948
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,052
Put them in the jeep

949
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,989
Come on, quick

950
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,240
Where are you taking us?

951
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,140
So that you witness your friend's death.

952
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,805
He had a knack of eloping with girls

953
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,437
How did you find where he is?

954
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,776
The rascal called his mother

955
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:17,842
He's hiding in Mohali

956
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,583
Where will he run now?

957
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,034
Come on, move

958
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,668
Where are they?

959
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,263

960
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:42,974

964
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,587
Forget it. Take the stairs

965
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:42,593
Hey what are you doing?

966
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,334
- Where are you going?

967
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,375
Get down.

968
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,002
Bablu, what are you doing here?

969
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,098
I couldn't take the front door

970
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,235
Where's Rakesh?

971
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,678
What's going on?

972
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,574
Bablu, what are you doing here?

973
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,342
Why didn't you stick to the plan..

974
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,747
..why did you switch off your phone?

975
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,083
I didn't switch it off.

976
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,483
Her family broke it.

977
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,789
My family?

978
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,656
Sir, this side

979
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,592
After you fled we were all abducted

980
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,823
Why did you call your mother?

981
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,232
Her family found out.

982
00:58:46,258 --> 00:58:47,749
Reception committee's outside

983
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,297
Open the door

984
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,874
Open the door, otherwise we will break it.

985
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,271
Renu, come on

986
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:56,739
Renu, come on

987
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,506

Bablu, take care

990
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,280
You will fall down

991
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,484
Bablu

992
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,393

00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,917
Hey Rajjo, search the balcony

Where are they?

1001
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,725

1002
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:52,789

Why should I?

1102
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:42,926
Few blows and you spilled everyone's whereabouts

1103
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,670
Another blow and..

1104
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,003
..you would've told them about Rakesh and Renu.

1105
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,545
But, Bablu, why don't you understand?

1106
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,238
That girl has a family

1107
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,881
They must be worried

1108
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,976
I don't care about them

1109
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,039
Rakesh is our friend, that's it.

1110
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:01,472
I want to see him happy.

1111
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,422
We don't have a big attitude like you

1112
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:05,523
- We're your friends too
- I know

1113
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,456
And when the time comes..

1114
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,598
...I'll do what I did for Rakesh.

1115
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,726
Bablu we don't mean that, try to understand.

1116
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,905
Idiots, people used to quote our friendship

1117
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:22,474
If you can help us all escape from here..

1118
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,874
..then why are you risking our lives for that girl?

1119
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,911
Do you want to die for her?

1120
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:32,881
I haven't thought about it yet?

1121
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,225
You have gone crazy about that girl

1122
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,292
Someone please explain to him

1123
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,421
What spell has that girl cast on you, that you don't even care about us?

1124
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,565
He has gone crazy

1125
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,148
You'll get ruined after her and will also drag us along.

1126
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,211
That...that girl

1127
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,086
She heard everything

1128
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,284
- Who was she?
- Oh, no

1129
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,987
- Oh, no
- Someone stop her

1130
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:21,932
You're amazing You got all the letters

1131
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,700
Actually that boy is amazing..

1132
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,799
..who's been helping Renu and Rakesh.

1133
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,041
He's been guiding them all along

1134
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,111
How they will elope, where they will go

1135
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,149
Where they are..

1136
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,979

..who murdered 18 people in a single night.

I'm helpless because of my daughter

Had she been at home, I'd have killed her by now

Not him

1216
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:31,229

..with Chaudhary's daughter?

1237
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,123
Please don't look, please don't look

1238
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:06,628

01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,261
Come on

1241
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:14,907
Yes

1242
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:16,635
We are leaving now

1243
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:17,733
Yes

01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,341
Get in the car, come on

1245
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:21,714
Listen

1246
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:27,216
Do you love someone?

1247
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,283
Confess if you do?

1248
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,554
Otherwise someone might get beaten up again like us.

1249
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,494
You are talking nonsense in front of Mr. Chaudhary.

1250
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,467
There's nothing wrong

1251
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,071
We're all going to Delhi.

1252
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:47,274
What if she elopes behind our back?

1253
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,874
Same thing will happen that's happening now.

1254
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,143
Be brave if you do

1255
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,583

Come on!

1260
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,143
This attitude looks good only on screen

1261
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,441
In real life the villain always wins.

1262
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,275
Understood?

1263
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,418

DirﬂPY

1268
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,418
The hero wins even in real life.

1269
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,709
The love story begins now.

1270
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,243

1271
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,413

1281
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,557

We're in Delhi

1317
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,335
But what's the position?

1318
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,372
Make your will, it's time to die.

I didn't understand one thing

1320

You revealed their secret

01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,780
So now they will be caught.

1322
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,415
They'll be caught if they were in Delhi.

1323
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:37,550
I lied.

1324
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,382
You're such a scoundrel.

1325
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:43,291
Friends who aren't scoundrels, aren't actually friends.

1326
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,763
They boarded the bus to Shimla

1327
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,310
Sir, these are the details received from the other police stations of Delhi.

1328
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,012
Will you not speak?

1329
01:19:08,038 --> 01:19:09,177
Come on, tell me.

1330
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,350
Inspector, this will not do

1331
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,723
Stop it

01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,652
Hello, Chaudhary sir

1333
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,163

1338
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,937
- But we're trying"
- Trying..

Otherwise I won't be sorry next time.

1344
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,823
Please

1345
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,560
I am really scared

1346
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,829
Bablu, can't we run away?

1347
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:00,265
Here

1348
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,397
Very good

1349
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,408
We won't run anymore

1350
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:07,707
We'll make these Jats run from one end to another

1351
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,844
How much are you going to eat?

1352
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:11,907
This is the first one

1353
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,850
The first one's just like the last one

1354
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:14,979
Green chutney

1355
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,113
Forget the green chutney"

1356
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,249
..or else they'll get married

1357
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,292
Hey"

1358
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,723
Get to the point

1359
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,963
As far as I know Rakesh

1360
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,429
He'll first go to a temple to get married.

1361
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:30,728
What did you say?

1362
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,101
Let's go to the temple

1363
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:41,864
Community wedding!

1364
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:43,732
I want to get married too

1365
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,217
Do you have a heart?

1366
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,149
"l want to get married"

1367
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:48,982
God..

1368
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,985
Get my Renu back

1369
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,126
Don't show me the day when I get to know..

1370
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,589
"that Renu eloped willingly.

1371
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,564
I beg of you

1372
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,798
Renu"

1373
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:17,672
What are you doing?

1374
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:18,979
Are you crazy?

1375
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,282
I haven't thought about it yet

1376
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,880
But I guess I'll go crazy now.

1377
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,951
Do you know why I brought you here?

1378
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,224
Because no one lies here.

1379
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,394
Honestly...

1380
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,435
...l like you

1381
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:39,337
And if you try,

1382
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,306
then I guarantee"

1383
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,902
..you'll start liking me too.

1384
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,500
Attitude again

1385
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,443
What to do?

1386
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,076
Everyone doesn't use it.

1387
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,208
I can't lose it.

1388
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,319
Let go of my hand

1389
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,110
Okay

1390
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,754
What's going on?

1391
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:00,019
Don't look at Shiv-Parvatiji

1392
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,587
Look at Hanumanji.

1393
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,061
Wait, I'll tell Chaudhary sir.

1394
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,223
- No!
- Tenne. Come here.

1395
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,598
Why are you beating him?

1396
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,230
He's getting fits.

1397
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,401
Then make him smell leather boots.

1398
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,670
- Do you have one?
- I do. I do.

1399
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:18,904
Then do it

1400
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,742
No!

1401
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,244
Check properly

1402
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,612
See her face

1403
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,598
Please find someone else

1404
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,060
I won't find one like you

1405
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:41,930
Of course you will

1406
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,492
There are so many girls in this world

1407
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,626
At least try.

1408
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,367
That's what I am doing?

1409
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:48,901
But I can't find one

1410
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,240
I am not handsome.

1411
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,247
You are..

1412
01:22:58,873 --> 01:22:59,715
Really?

1413
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,186
Yes. You're very handsome.

1414
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,412
Really..

1415
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,251
Look...you have a good height

1416
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,654
What are you saying?

1417
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:09,691
Proper face-cut

1418
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,026
Anything else

1419
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,481
You have a good nose too.

1420
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:14,621
What else do you want?

1421
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,430
I don't have proper lips

1422
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,030
They are fine

1423
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,240
No one's going to kiss me, what's the point?

1424
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,038
She will Of course she will.

1425
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:25,704
She will?

1426
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,854
Then what are you waiting for?

1427
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,734
This network"

1428
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,006
See. He held her hand.

1429
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,077
Didn't I tell you he held her hand?

1430
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,646
What are you doing, Chaudhary sir?

1431
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,373
You left her all alone.

1432
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,981
It's so crowded.
And the kind of people..

1433
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,415
Please hold on to her.

1434
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,456
We couldn't find anyone here, brother.

1435
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:12,657
She isn't here

1436
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:15,953
As far as I know Rakesh..

1437
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,255
..he may have gone to the court to get married.

1438
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,658
Let's check there

1439
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,083
Hey love commando, you're acting too smart

1440
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:43,782
Stay within your limits or else I will burn you..

1441
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,747
That's what lam going to do to you

1442
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,018
Better stay away from me

1443
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,330
Brother, you sit here

1444
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,491

You two wait here, I'll make arrangements inside.

1446
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,816
Sit. Sit.

1447
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,650
Be comfortable, sister

1448
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,515
We're comfortable, brother

1449
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,592
Why are you crying?

1450
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,361
Soon we'll be together forever

1451
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:31,332
The judge's asking where are the parents?

1452
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,972
Tell him...her father's busy looking for us.

1453
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:36,664
Don't cry

1454
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:37,766
Don't cry

1455
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,277
Excuse me

1456
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,236
Why is she crying?

1457
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:42,974
She's missing her father

1458
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,141
She has a cheap father

1459
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,485
sorfY

1460
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:49,448
He makes millions, drives a Mercedes

1461
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,415
But he has a tiny heart.

1462
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,323
Don't cry

1463
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,485
And who are you?

1464
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,563
I drive her father's car

1465
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,297
lam his driver.

1466
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,358
In fact, I was.

1467
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,694
Her father paid me less

1468
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,637
He beat me up

1469
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:09,534
He said "Why do you love her?"

1470
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,207
I eloped with his daughter

1471
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:13,210
Now let him search.

1472
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,572
Won't your father be worried?

1473
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,842
He will. For few days.

1474
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,049
He'll look for us.

1475
01:26:18,075 --> 01:26:20,742
Go to the police station. But what then..

1476
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,414
We'll already be off to Manali for our honeymoon.

1477
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:27,424
Don't worry

1478
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,892
He'll come back to me begging

1479
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,021
He'll say "Son-in-law, let's go home"

1480
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,425
Where do you get the courage?

1481
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,027
From friends

1482
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,432
Best friends

1483
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:38,101
Love you buddy

1484
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:40,899
Haven't you heard that saying..

1485
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,464
"Love can't be controlled."

1486
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,268
You must have, it's a famous one

1487
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,971
By the way, what do you think?

1488
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,206
The lady sitting next to you..

1489
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,442
..will never fall in love

1490
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:55,984
Tell me sister, will you stay all your life with this man!

1491
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,489
I mean with your father!

1492
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,621
Listen, her relatives are looking for her

1493
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:02,355
Damn these relatives

1494
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,861
That's their nature

1495
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:06,894
Looking for them means squandering money

1496
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:10,102
Pepsi's, snacks...having fun

1497
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,032
Am I right, mister?

1498
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:16,636
Rascal..

1499
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,344
You think you can substitute marriage..

1500
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,107
..by getting married in the court?

1501
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,277
Don't you have a soul?

1502
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,213
You eloped with the girl

1503
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,344
Didn't you think about her parents?

1504
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:28,452
And you?

1505
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,414
Do you like hurting your parents?

1506
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,091
You should be ashamed.

1507
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,925
- And you
- Brother...

1508
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,085
Brother, they aren't inside

1509
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,565
Their application isn't even in the register

1510
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:45,553
Don't cry Don't worry.

1511
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:46,694
That man's worried

1512
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:48,139
I love you, nothing will happen

1513
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:16,367
"My heart's restless.."

1514
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:22,470
"My heart's restless.."

1515
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:28,338
Mister

1516
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,313
Have you seen them?

1517
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,282
No, sir. I haven't seen them.

1518
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,670
Go away or you'll die.

1519
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:56,207
Listen to me

1520
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:59,676
I told you, we have no future

1521
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,113
Thank God you told me

1522
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,012
I don't like easy jobs anyway

1523
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,376
That's why I made you my wife

1524
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,150
Look

1525
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,618
Marriage form

1526
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,624
I already signed

1527
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,620
50% marriage is done

1528
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:18,791
Now we need just your signatures

1529
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:20,088
What?

1530
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:27,468
Chaudhary sir, Renu is in that van

1531
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:44,214
Hey stop, you Idiot

1532
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:52,056
Hey stop, you Idiot
Stop the vehicle

1533
01:29:58,526 --> 01:29:59,869
Come out

1534
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:01,531
Come out everyone

1535
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,801
Come on

1536
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:04,471
You too, come out

1537
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:05,806
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1538
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:09,505
Come on, get down

1539
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,543
You too, out

1540
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,377
You..

1541
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,612
Come on

1542
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:16,655
- Renu!
- Didn't you hear me?

1543
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:18,482
- Get down
- Renu!

1544
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:19,916
Renu!

1545
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:25,522
Move!

1546
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,705
What's this hooliganism?

1547
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,173
Troubling people

1548
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:39,571
Madam...forgive me..

1549
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:43,509
It was a mistake

1550
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,673
Everyone makes one

1551
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:48,515
Let's go

1552
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:14,143
Dimpy! Dimpy!

1553
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,364
There was a girl sitting here.

1554
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,106
Did you see her?

1555
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,209
No

1556
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:22,486
Mister. My daughter was sitting right here. Did you see her?

1557
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,181
She was dressed in blue..

1558
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:25,947
- Dimpy!
- Look there

1559
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:27,856
Chaudhary sir.
It's your mistake.

1560
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,312
Why did you bring her along?

1561
01:31:29,338 --> 01:31:30,916
Now you've lost both your daughters.

1562
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:39,531
NO, leave me, help

1563
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,804
Move, what are you doing?

1564
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:55,378
No, No, No..

1565
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,488
Help, leave my hand

1566
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:06,422
Save me, help

1567
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,136
Leave me, help

1568
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:20,111
Oh Almighty lord!

1569
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:25,474
Let me go, help

1570
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,394
Let me go

1571
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:40,361
Save me, no

1572
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,693
Leave my hand, leave my hand

1573
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:46,738
Leave me, no.. no

1574
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,330
Hey, move on

1575
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:52,739
It's a small word

1576
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:55,474
'Nahi' in Hindi

1577
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,476
'No' in English

1578
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,613
And 'NO' means 'NO'.

1579
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:06,876
Bablu..

1580
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:32,342
"My heart's restless.."

1581
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:38,445
"My heart's restless.."

1582
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:04,974
Dimpi

1583
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,637
Search there

1584
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:08,142
Papa..

1585
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:21,950
How dare you touch her!

1586
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,419
How dare you!

1587
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,594
Are you a kid?

1588
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:29,864
Don't you know that you should stay together?

1589
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,232
If anything happened to you then"?

1590
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:34,204
Hey...stay within your limits

1591
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:35,171
Raj] <i>°</i>

1592
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:44,983
Thanks, get fixed

1593
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,478
Come on

1594
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,600
Listen...

1595
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,337
.. so much happened

1596
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:16,510
I couldn't even thank you

1597
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:18,106
What for?

1598
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:20,281
For saving my life

1599
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:23,421
No one can save you, Dimpy

1600
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:25,918
Your life's already over.

1601
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,123
I never got along with my father

1602
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:33,455
He would ask me to do something

1603
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,824
And I always said no.

1604
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,627
Have you ever said no to your father?

1605
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:43,034
No, right?

1606
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,438
Have you ever lived the way you wanted?

1607
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,171
No

1608
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:51,683
Your family treats women like animals

1609
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,479
Have you ever revolted?

1610
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:56,785
You have to fight

1611
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:58,955
That's when you get equality.

1612
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:03,252
You just have one life, do you get it?

1613
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:04,795
We only live once.

1614
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:06,831
Bablu, I want to live too

1615
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:08,901
- But..
- No ifs and buts"

1616
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:10,558
Be brave

1617
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:13,838
Admit to your father that you love me.

1618
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:31,950
But you do love your dreams, don't you?

1619
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:33,383
Yes

01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:16,880
<i>"Fall down and stand up again"</i>

1648
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:18,147
<i>"And fly"</i>

1649
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:22,354
<i>"Let me give you my wings"</i>

1650
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:28,199
<i>"Let's live a lifetime tonight"</i>

1651
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,062
<i>"An entire lifetime"</i>

1652
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:33,570
<i>"Tonight"</i>

1653
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,702
<i>"Tonight"</i>

1654
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:37,400
<i>"Tonight"</i>

1655
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,310

1656
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:44,247

1657
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,376
<i>"Tonight"</i>

1658
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,613
<i>"Tonight"</i>

1659
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:26,886
<i>"Let's not go home"</i>

1660
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:30,385
<i>"Let's not go home"</i>

1661
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:47,970
Sir, this is the guest house.

1662
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:50,680
Clean the mess, and vacant room number 2

1663
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:52,644
Open room number 7

1664
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:28,816
Tell their whereabouts

1665
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:32,824
I never ask who's eloped with whose daughter?

1666
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,960
Or whose wife?

1667
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:37,886
I just charge them for the room per hour.

1668
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:39,444
But who are you guys?

1669
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:40,517
What's the matter?

1670
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:43,028
Just tell us where we can find them.

1671
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:45,201
They ran out of money

1672
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:47,268
The girl kept her chain as collateral

1673
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:49,696
And then she had nothing left.

1674
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:52,204
But I said "No, first pay the rent.."

1675
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:53,369
"..only then I'll let you stay here".

1676
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,310
Are you going to pay that money now?

1677
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,473
Rascal

1678
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:57,907
Don't touch him

1679
01:42:58,805 --> 01:43:00,443
How do you know it was them?

1680
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,614
Did they look like this?

1681
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:06,351
That's them

1682
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:08,351
It was them

1683
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,423
Now pay UP

1684
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:13,356
Come on

1685
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:21,639
Hey... do you want to die!

1686
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:25,172
Come on!

1687
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:26,375
What's wrong with you?

1688
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:27,308
Come on!

1689
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,539
What's wrong with you?

1690
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,144
Calm down

1691
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,346
Come on!

1692
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:33,645
Let's go home, Chaudhary sir.

1693
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:34,742
Everyone is looking for you.

1694
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:35,980
What home?

1695
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,148
Yes

1696
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,417
The lodge, where my daughter stayed"

1697
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,659
You saw, didn't you?

1698
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:50,933
Where he kept my daughter

1699
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:56,875
ls this why they eloped from home?

1700
01:43:58,532 --> 01:44:00,136
ls this what you call youth?

1701
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:03,946
Don't these teens understand?

1702
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:07,916
Even I was young 25 years ago

1703
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:12,083
I was so arrogant that I never listened to anyone

1704
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:13,422
No one

1705
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,756
Mother, father, wife, no one

1706
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:20,261
But then I became a father

1707
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,130
Of my Renu.

1708
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:28,937
She was this small when I held her first.

1709
01:44:31,231 --> 01:44:32,869
I left everything

1710
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:36,611
I slogged hard

1711
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:40,784
Earned wealth, respect.

1712
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,347
I even learnt English for her

1713
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,550
And then someone took her away from me.

1714
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:49,460
Love..

1715
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:51,692
ls this what you call love?

1716
01:44:52,753 --> 01:44:54,061
No money

1717
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,524
No capability

1718
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:58,661
Just took the help of his friends and eloped with her

1719
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:00,068
And became her hero

1720
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,236
ls this how you become a 'Hero'?

1721
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:10,544
When there is no money, he sold her gold chain

1722
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,244
And if they don't get along..

1723
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:17,352
..will he divorce her, leave her?

1724
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,418
But...

1725
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:24,428
...l can't leave my daughter

1726
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,022
I am a father

1727
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:32,432
For 20 years I took care of her, raised her

1728
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:37,740
Fulfilled every responsibility of a father

1729
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,339
I just wanted to see her married

1730
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:46,042
I wanted to see her happy.

1731
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:49,945
But where's my daughter?

1732
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:52,581
Where is she?

1733
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:55,721
I have lost.

1734
01:45:56,983 --> 01:46:00,760
I've lost my respect, honor, everything.

1735
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:04,059
I want my daughter

1736
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:06,927
Where's my daughter?

1737
01:46:07,728 --> 01:46:10,231
Where's my daughter?

1738
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:14,572
Where's my daughter?

1739
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:19,280
Where's my daughter?

1740
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,562
The day I find her...

1741
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,766
...I'll kill her

1742
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,360
I'll kill her on the spot

1743
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:03,686
Listen

1744
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,994
Do you think they will be caught?

1745
01:47:08,188 --> 01:47:09,326
I don't know

1746
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:11,828
You know...

1747
01:47:11,892 --> 01:47:14,304
...earlier, even I wanted them to be caught.

1748
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,275
But everyone has a right"

1749
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:20,805
..to make decisions of their own life.

1750
01:47:22,035 --> 01:47:23,673
I should too

1751
01:47:25,305 --> 01:47:27,307
Because we only live once, right?

1752
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:32,823
Will we keep running around like this?

1753
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:41,462
I can't tell papa

1754
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:45,325
But I'll tell you

1755
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:56,179
I love you!

1756
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:00,315
I love you, Bablu

1757
01:48:06,246 --> 01:48:07,884
Renu

1758
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:11,657
Renu stop

1759
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:13,629
Get the car

1760
01:48:13,687 --> 01:48:15,166
Renu

1761
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:17,497
Renu

1762
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:23,233
Renu

1763
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,668
Stop the bus

1764

1765
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,044
Papa!

1766
01:48:29,135 --> 01:48:30,705
Renu

1767
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:34,151
Stop the bus

1768
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:42,855
Renu

1769
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,766
Renu stop

1770
01:48:50,991 --> 01:48:51,969

1771
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:52,968
Renu!

1772
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,430
Renu, come on

1773
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:56,533
- Renu
- Renu, come on

1774
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:57,768
Renu

1775
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:20,323
Beat him

1776
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:23,663
Let him go..

01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:25,327
Leave him..

1778
01:49:25,792 --> 01:49:27,897
No papa, don't beat him

1779
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:30,407
Leave me

1780
01:49:40,874 --> 01:49:42,820
- Move..

1781
01:49:46,546 --> 01:49:49,322

Move back

01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:53,796
Don't touch them

Forgive them, please

1785
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,102

Sir, please..

Beware

1790
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:17,479
Don't you dare touch him?

1791
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:19,719
I'll file a complaint with the police.

1792
01:50:21,047 --> 01:50:22,355
He's my husband

1793
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:26,123
Would you let me marry him?

1794
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,932
Why don't I have the right to take any decision?

1795
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,630
Why?

1796
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,936

ls it a big sin to fall in love?

1799
01:50:44,204 --> 01:50:46,309
Why don't you let us live in peace?

1800
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:49,250
You've been chasing us like dogs.
Like dogs.

You ran away from home

1807
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:12,869
I used to wonder..

1808
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:16,438
..where you'd be, in what condition

1809
01:51:18,538 --> 01:51:22,816
I've been wandering from one city to another looking for you.

1810
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:25,580
Fighting with people

1811
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:27,452

Let's forget all differences

1853
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:01,003
I spared your life, because of Chaudhary's presence

1854
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,904
Otherwise I would've
burnt you in a furnace.

1855
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:10,373
Bablu. It's alright

1856
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:12,643

"nothing will ever happen to me in this house

Today I am scared.

1909
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:25,459
Papa took me to Delhi...

1910
02:00:26,786 --> 02:00:29,130
...because he didn't trust me

1911
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:32,901
But I was completely sure that"

1912
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:37,964
...I'll never do what Renu did

1913
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:44,012
But when I left Bablu I understood why Renu eloped.

1914
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:48,848
In this family a girl child is killed right after birth.

1915
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:51,516
Papa didn't kill us then..

1916
02:00:53,012 --> 02:00:54,821

Good, very good.

1943
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:57,117
Till now you've only witnessed our fury

1944
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:58,946
Now you'll see our love.

I am not scared anymore

1951

Bablu? Why, brother?

1955
02:02:34,313 --> 02:02:35,758
Forget it, I'll see it myself

1956
02:03:02,441 --> 02:03:03,681

1957
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:05,086

I didn't expect you'd show up uninformed

1977
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:11,150
But...you did the right thing

1978
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:13,686
Because everyone's busy with the marriage..

1979
02:04:13,746 --> 02:04:15,191

1980
02:04:15,247 --> 02:04:17,488

2002
02:05:20,246 --> 02:05:21,748
..until the wedding isn't over.
Come on

2003
02:05:21,814 --> 02:05:22,451
No, no..

2004
02:05:22,548 --> 02:05:25,028
The guests are about to arrive.
Come on

2005
02:05:25,484 --> 02:05:27,088
- I'll be right back
- Come on

2006
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:33,762
Not this... this...

2007
02:05:36,262 --> 02:05:37,741
Brother. Your turban Brother

2008
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:39,932
- Where's Bablu?
- I don't know

2009
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:41,251
Where's Dimpy?

2010
02:05:41,277 --> 02:05:42,704
We don't know

2011
02:05:43,736 --> 02:05:44,544
Forget it..

2012
02:05:44,603 --> 02:05:45,768
- You look there

2013
02:05:45,794 --> 02:05:47,541
- I am looking for her

2014
02:05:54,179 --> 02:05:55,214
Bablu

2015
02:06:30,516 --> 02:06:32,462
Has anyone seen Dimpy?

2016
02:06:38,324 --> 02:06:41,100
Remember...you always said..

2017
02:06:41,727 --> 02:06:43,764
"that you stopped because you saw me.

2018
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:47,942
You inspired me to live my life.

2019
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:50,380
I started flying

2020
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,381
I started living

2021
02:06:56,442 --> 02:06:58,388
How do I tell papa...

2022
02:06:59,111 --> 02:07:00,681
...that I want to choose my love?

2023
02:07:02,781 --> 02:07:04,021
He knows everything

2024
02:07:05,317 --> 02:07:06,125
Oh my God

2025
02:07:06,185 --> 02:07:07,858
What is our position now?

2026
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,490
Their position is worse than ours.

2027
02:07:09,555 --> 02:07:11,193
Have the sweetmeats arrived?

2028
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,325
Let's go

2029
02:07:26,438 --> 02:07:28,247
What happened, papa?

2030
02:07:29,008 --> 02:07:30,510
What are you staring at?

2031
02:07:31,543 --> 02:07:32,578
Nothing

2032
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:45,665
You took such good care of me

2033
02:07:45,958 --> 02:07:46,936
Yes

2034
02:07:47,326 --> 02:07:49,067
Like a shadow

2035
02:07:55,801 --> 02:07:57,872
Today you're sending me to an alien place..

2036
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:02,916
..where you won't be there.

2037
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,624
But you must have thought right

2038
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:13,554
I can see my entire life, papa

2039
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:21,332
But... I will live it

2040
02:08:24,396 --> 02:08:26,239
Don't worry, Papa-

2041
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:46,595
What happened, brother?

2042
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:50,032
She has to leave someday

2043
02:08:50,656 --> 02:08:52,158
Enough

2044
02:08:55,127 --> 02:08:56,197
Get up

2045
02:08:56,862 --> 02:08:58,136
Get her ready

2046
02:09:37,669 --> 02:09:39,671
You know what's going on in my house

2047
02:09:41,173 --> 02:09:42,880
My daughter's getting married

2048
02:09:45,244 --> 02:09:46,746
And you are also aware that"

2049
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:50,592
..a boy eloped with my elder daughter

2050
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:53,957
And now you

2051
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:56,231
Why are you here?

2052
02:09:57,322 --> 02:09:58,562
Be honest

2053
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:04,066
You came here to elope with my younger daughter, didn't you?

2054
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:08,074
Eloping isn't difficult, Chaudhary sir

2055
02:10:11,503 --> 02:10:12,811
Nor am I scared

2056
02:10:17,342 --> 02:10:18,821
When Renu ran way...

2057
02:10:20,145 --> 02:10:21,818
...your plight amused me

2058
02:10:23,816 --> 02:10:25,227
But when I saw you..

2059
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:29,597
I gradually realized what a father feels..

2060
02:10:30,856 --> 02:10:33,132
..when his daughter runs away.

2061
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:39,100
Today...

2062
02:10:40,699 --> 02:10:44,408
...your plight scared me.

2063
02:10:47,139 --> 02:10:48,413
I was never like this before

2064
02:10:51,009 --> 02:10:52,420
I was happy

2065
02:10:54,112 --> 02:10:55,489
I was always happy

2066
02:11:00,085 --> 02:11:01,758
But today...

2067
02:11:04,289 --> 02:11:05,597
Today I am sad

2068
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,166
There is no one..

2069
02:11:11,897 --> 02:11:13,535
No one to share with...

2070
02:11:16,735 --> 02:11:18,146
And no one to understand either

2071
02:11:21,073 --> 02:11:22,677
But you can understand.

2072
02:11:27,112 --> 02:11:29,388
That day Dimpy went missing for 20 minutes"

2073
02:11:30,582 --> 02:11:32,061
..and I was worried

2074
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:37,059
Then I realized that... Renu was missing for 20 days.

2075
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:45,871
Do you know what's going on in this house?

2076
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:50,313
The girl I love is getting married

2077
02:11:52,137 --> 02:11:54,139
And also the daughter you love.

2078
02:11:56,508 --> 02:11:58,613
You're wishing that nothing obstructs this wedding

2079
02:12:00,779 --> 02:12:02,850
And I am wishing that this wedding doesn't go through.

2080
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:07,020
You want to save your honor

2081
02:12:10,956 --> 02:12:12,230
And l, my love.

2082
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:18,304
We're both in the same condition

2083
02:12:20,532 --> 02:12:22,534
You love Dimpy more than me

2084
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,047
But if there's anyone who loves her..

2085
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:31,779
"after you, then that's me.

2086
02:12:36,648 --> 02:12:38,924
I came here to elope with her

2087
02:12:42,487 --> 02:12:44,330
But I am not going to elope with your daughter.

2088
02:12:58,236 --> 02:12:59,738
What are you doing?

2089
02:13:00,172 --> 02:13:02,482
When it was your turn, you got scared

2090
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:07,523
One needs courage to do what I am doing

2091
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:11,186
Chaudhary knows that Dimpy loves you

2092
02:13:11,717 --> 02:13:13,355
Still he's getting her married to that Rajjo

2093
02:13:13,719 --> 02:13:15,255
This is wrong

2094
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:18,059
Fathers are not always wrong.

2095
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,587
Love commando.
 Where are you going?

2096
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:40,981
As soon as I found out that you're here..

2097
02:13:41,079 --> 02:13:43,025
..l came here to welcome you personally.

2098
02:13:44,383 --> 02:13:46,488
You came here for Rajjo's wedding..

2099
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:48,297
..so you got to have something.

2100
02:13:49,454 --> 02:13:50,592
Choose

2101
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:54,493
What would you like to have this or this?

2102
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:56,164
Please let us go

2103
02:13:56,261 --> 02:13:58,138
You can't leave alive

2104
02:13:59,331 --> 02:14:00,776
You came prepared

2105
02:14:01,066 --> 02:14:03,012
Brought these three boys along too

2106
02:14:03,602 --> 02:14:04,842
Kill him

2107
02:14:08,373 --> 02:14:09,909
Don't beat him

2108
02:14:10,008 --> 02:14:11,510
Bablu

2109
02:14:12,744 --> 02:14:13,745
Bablu

2110
02:14:20,485 --> 02:14:21,589
Bablu!

2111
02:14:31,663 --> 02:14:32,903
Bablu!

2112
02:14:36,535 --> 02:14:38,481
Only that much strength you have.

2113
02:15:02,194 --> 02:15:03,036
That's it!

2114
02:15:03,095 --> 02:15:04,904
Was that all the attitude you had?

2115
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:07,172
I'll put an end to you here.

2116
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:09,970
And back there, it'll be Dimpy's opening ceremony.

2117
02:15:23,381 --> 02:15:24,553
You..

2118
02:16:26,111 --> 02:16:27,181
Bablu, kill him

2119
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:30,556
Beat him. Don't spare him

2120
02:16:31,349 --> 02:16:33,158
Beat him

2121
02:16:33,685 --> 02:16:37,827
Bablu, kill him

2122
02:17:08,086 --> 02:17:09,190
Stop!

2123
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,408
Mr. Chaudhary..

2124
02:17:27,172 --> 02:17:28,549
What's so special about you?

2125
02:17:29,708 --> 02:17:31,334
Why does Dimpy love you?

2126
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:32,714
I can't understand

2127
02:17:34,779 --> 02:17:36,281
The wedding procession ls about to arrive..

2128
02:17:36,348 --> 02:17:38,021
..and I'm standing here

2129
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:39,956
Why?

2130
02:17:41,553 --> 02:17:43,555
Because you love your daughter a lot

2131
02:17:45,624 --> 02:17:47,103
I don't want to take away your right"

2132
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,967
..to decide whom she marries.

2133
02:17:51,863 --> 02:17:53,501
But wherever she's getting married..

2134
02:17:55,033 --> 02:17:56,910
..if she is troubled...

2135
02:17:59,070 --> 02:18:00,344
then I won't spare you.

2136
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:12,323
...If she faces any trouble..

2137
02:18:13,752 --> 02:18:15,561
..then you won't be spared.

2138
02:18:26,331 --> 02:18:27,401
Go on

2139
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:30,006
She is yours

2140
02:19:14,846 --> 02:19:16,917
But, brother, what about family honor?

2141
02:19:17,015 --> 02:19:19,825
I just want to see respect in Dimpy's eyes.

2142
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:23,265
You mean...love marriages are okay in Jat Land?

2143
02:19:23,355 --> 02:19:25,892
If the boy's worthy, then okay.

2144
02:19:27,459 --> 02:19:31,566
Brother, I am having an affair too

2145
02:19:32,430 --> 02:19:34,068
Me too, sir

2146
02:19:40,205 --> 02:19:41,582
Bless you, son

2147
02:19:43,742 --> 02:19:45,585
Please forgive Rakesh and Renu too, please

2148
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:46,917
Yes

2149
02:19:47,812 --> 02:19:49,723
You've a big attitude

2150
02:19:50,715 --> 02:19:51,887
What to do?

2151
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:53,560
Others can't use it

2152
02:19:53,952 --> 02:19:55,226
I can't lose it.
