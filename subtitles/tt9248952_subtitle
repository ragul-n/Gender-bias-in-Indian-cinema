1
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,890
"When I see your grace, 
my heart says.."

2
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,010
"Ole-Ole.."

3
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,010
"Your style is totally unique.."

4
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,050
"My heart says.."

5
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,260
"Ole-Ole.."

6
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,250
"I get tempted by the young girls.."

7
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,250
"And those who like to have fun."

8
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,450
"My heart doesn't listen and says.."

9
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,080
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

10
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,230
"Whenever I see a girl, 
my heart says.."

11
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,860
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

12
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,520
"I sing while slowly 
dancing to the beat.."

13
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,060
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

14
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,160
"Your blue eyes call out to me.."

15
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,290
"Ole-Ole.."

16
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,120
"Your blue eyes call out to me.."

17
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,950
"The boys in the 
club check you out."

18
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,320
"My heart says..that 
you must be mine."

19
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,190
"Forget the world, 
and come in my arms."

20
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,770
"I always do what I like.."

21
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,390
"..you like me better 
when I am mischievous."

22
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,970
"When I saw you, 
my heart clearly says.."

23
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,550
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

24
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,750
"Whenever I see a girl, 
my heart says.."

25
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,370
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

26
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,950
"Same old swag, but my heart says.."

27
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,660
"Ole-Ole.. Ole-Ole.. "

28
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,400
It's indeed a nice place.

29
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
Jazz isn't here yet?

30
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,810
He'll be here any minute.

31
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,860
Wait.

32
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,510
Where are you?

33
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,630
Coming.

34
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,010
The meeting is inside your complex, 
at least be on time here.

35
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,670
Coming, coming. Relax

36
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,540
He's coming.

37
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,870
What are you doing, Jassi? 
- Sorry, Sorry brother.

38
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,570
How do you like the place?

39
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,360
Unbelievable, Jazz.

40
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,280
It's a top-class 
location you've found.

41
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,400
I've been to your 
place so many times..

42
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
..but never saw it 
from this point of you.

43
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,350
We can create 
a building complex here.

44
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,100
I admit you've an 
eye for good things.

45
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,560
A bad one..

46
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,890
Let's talk about the property.

47
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,720
No one knows that the 
owners are ready to sell.

48
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,220
Once the word gets 
out on the market..

49
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,630
..buyers will flock to this place.

50
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,380
Only If the word gets out.

51
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,130
We like her.

52
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,080
You've a deal. 
Come I'll give the token.

53
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,790
Oh, man..

54
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,320
What a car.

55
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,070
What's the mileage?

56
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,230
It's electric.

57
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,230
Once we crack this deal, Jazz..

58
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,730
..you can buy a dozen like this.

59
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,100
When are we meeting 
with the investors?

60
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,180
Oh, man..

61
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,420
Yeah, you like it?

62
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,670
Looks just like a basket of muffins.

63
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,580
I was talking about your hair, Jazz.

64
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,040
When you see such a 
beautiful thing in the mirror..

65
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,500
..who wants to look at himself.

66
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,160
Next time should we try highlights?

67
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,290
Highlights look 
best only in cricket.

68
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,620
I like to play the entire innings.

69
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Bad joke.

70
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,030
What is the plan for Diwali?

71
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,440
Not mine.

72
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,570
But the family does, with me. 
Of dinner.

73
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,480
Same old praying and worshipping.

74
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,770
What are your plans?

75
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,730
Working. 
Diwali is a good time for business.

76
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,890
And Happy Diwali.

77
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,680
Happy Diwali.

78
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,970
Happy Diwali my firecrackers.

79
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,640
Happy Diwali, Jazz.

80
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,680
From one firecracker to another.

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
Shall we?

82
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,930
So how is business?

83
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,550
Business is great, dad.

84
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,670
There is a new deal.

85
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,750
Hopefully Jassi will spare some 
time for work as well.

86
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,710
You see, bro..

87
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,710
..I measure time in 
quality and not quantity.

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,500
I take only four hours 
to do an entire day's work.

89
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,830
When have you ever been 
in the office for four hours?

90
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,570
He wakes up at 12, 
comes to office at 3..

91
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,570
..and leaves at 5.

92
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,240
Are you my partner or warden.

93
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,200
Brother..

94
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,240
Juliet, pay attention to your Romeo.

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,610
He's always chasing me.

96
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,360
Jassi, you should come to see 
us more oftenthan just on Sundays.

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,480
I am working late night now a days.

98
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,310
- Are you ever going to change? 
- Next year.

99
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,600
Pass me that.

100
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,890
I am thinking of 
taking a sabbatical.

101
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,260
A-year-long vacation.

102
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,630
5-star hotel, 
butler, healthy food, jacuzzi.

103
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,880
No phone calls, no work, no 
restrictions on sleeping or waking up.

104
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,380
Just me and my freedom.

105
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,910
Young man like you should 
plan marriage, kids..

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,160
Not think about holidaying.

107
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,080
Young man?

108
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,240
Dad, I don't want wife and kids..

109
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,660
I've said that before.

110
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,740
I wonder what's the hurry?

111
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,230
Pammi's son is gay.

112
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,770
So?

113
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,640
No, they've been coaxing 
him to get married for so long.

114
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,140
Recently they argued 
and he confessed..

115
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,470
I am gay.

116
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,090
Ohh..

117
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,880
so now you all know.

118
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,130
Jassi!

119
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,170
No, mom, I am not gay.

120
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,000
And what is the 
problem even if I was.

121
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,200
He can't be gay, mom.

122
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,580
And I can vouch for him.

123
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,910
Now that's like my bro..

124
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,200
Enough bro..

125
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,400
Jassi..

126
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,730
..this deal is very important.

127
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Pay attention.

128
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,690
Don't worry.

129
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,190
We're two hearts but one soul.

130
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,140
We're not two hearts..

131
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,260
..you are a dil-do.

132
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,410
One of the best developers 
of the city, The Grover Group..

133
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,160
..wants to invest in Hounslow.

134
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,570
And they have chosen this 
property for the development.

135
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,030
I was only 18 when 
I joined this business..

136
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,900
..and in my 15-years-of experience, 
I've never seen an offer like this.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,230
We all know that your homes 
are worth 200,000 pounds.

138
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,220
And their offer is 300,000 pounds.

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,390
This offer alone answers 
all your questions..

140
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,970
..but if you still 
have any queries..

141
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,470
I am right here.

142
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,260
Jazz, you know we've been 
looking for a developer.

143
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,630
Let's begin the paperwork

144
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Agreement is not the issue..

145
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,000
what about Mrs. Malika.

146
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,080
look, this deal is valid 
only if all the owners agree.

147
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,870
Else, the project 
will never get approved.

148
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,080
We've tried convincing her, 
but she pays no heed.

149
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,780
She owns three apartments.

150
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,160
You live in one of them.

151
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,570
She is a very stubborn lady.

152
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,030
If you guys are ready to sell..

153
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,360
..then convincing her is my job.

154
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,480
- Okay.. 
- Okay..

155
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,350
You have committed but will 
you be able to convince Mrs. Malika?

156
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,470
I'll have to pay the rent 
first and try convincing her.

157
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,300
You haven't paid your rent yet.

158
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,470
What do you do with all your money?

159
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,510
Rocky.

160
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,760
Buddy..

161
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,920
My rocket.

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,920
I am just a rocket, but 
you're surrounded by firecrackers.

163
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,250
Ladies, meet my brother 
from another mother.

164
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,290
My twin, Jazz.

165
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,570
- Hi, Jazz. 
- Hi.. Hello.

166
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,740
Let's get a selfie.

167
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,650
Sure, come on. 
I'll do it for you.

168
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,230
Now that's what you call life.

169
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,900
This is called flying solo.

170
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,230
You're cute too.

171
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,100
I love the colour of your hair.

172
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,550
Which dye do you use?

173
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,260
You're kidding, right.

174
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,500
It's all-natural, babe..

175
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,210
Ohh..doesn't seem like that.

176
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,580
[indistinct chatter]

177
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,230
Hey Jazz.. 
Hey can I have a double, please.

178
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,890
Hi..

179
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,720
Tia.

180
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,010
Hello. Jazz.

181
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,130
I spilt my drink on you yesterday.

182
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,220
Doesn't matter.

183
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,550
You can spill it on me again.

184
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,670
No no, I mean.. 
Can I get you a drink?

185
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,040
This club belongs to my friend.

186
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,500
I have a tab here.

187
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,080
Hey bartender.. can i have my drink.

188
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,710
Bartender..?

189
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,870
Here you go, Jazz.

190
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,410
Everyone around here knows you.

191
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,450
I grew up here.

192
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,820
Never seen you here before.

193
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,490
Actually, I am from Amsterdam.

194
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,940
Damn.. Amsterdam.

195
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,270
I love that place.

196
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,480
- Have you Ever been there? 
- Many years ago.

197
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,140
I failed in my graduating year..

198
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,680
..so we went there to party.

199
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,220
But now I don't get time 
from my responsibilities.

200
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,840
Responsibilities like?

201
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,090
Business. Work.

202
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,340
Family? Kids?

203
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,790
No..

204
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,750
Do I look unhappy? 
Married types.

205
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,160
I don't know.

206
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
No!

207
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,660
I believe in love, but..

208
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,490
..wife and kids..

209
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,650
I love my freedom.

210
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
So..what brings you here?

211
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,890
I am here for some work..

212
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,470
Personal.

213
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,550
I am very good about 
personal things.

214
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,920
Don't hesitate to 
ask if you need help.

215
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,040
Actually..I've been observing 
you for the past few days.

216
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,290
I think there can be 
a lot more common between us.

217
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,280
Really?

218
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
I like it.

219
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,030
I really like it.

220
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,980
I love it.

221
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,940
So..shall we move somewhere 
quieter and talk?

222
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,600
Sure. Where?

223
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,430
My home?

224
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,180
Cool. Let's go.

225
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,920
Put it on my tab.

226
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,230
You like it.

227
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,970
Who else lives here?

228
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,640
Just me and my swag.

229
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,970
And sometimes guests like you leave 
their essence behind.

230
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,970
Wine?

231
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,590
Yeah, sure.

232
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,650
What's the matter?

233
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,400
Trying to find more similarities?

234
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
No..

235
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:52,940
No..

236
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,810
So..

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,760
..what else do you do 
except for looking so gorgeous?

238
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,390
I am a translator.

239
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,850
And I've applied for a job in Paris.

240
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,130
Paris.

241
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,130
Romantic city.

242
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,620
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

243
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,700
I don't know where to begin.

244
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,700
You can begin from 
wherever you like.

245
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,700
Actually, it's a little personal.

246
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,150
I am personal too.

247
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,110
And can be private.

248
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,640
So the thing is..

249
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,180
..I am 21-years-old.

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,390
Born and brought up in Amsterdam.

251
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,390
I was happy.

252
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,130
My books, 
my celibate mom, my friends.

253
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,420
Chatting over the phone for hours.

254
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,250
You getting me right?

255
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,370
Of course, I am.

256
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,370
I am drinking to 
understand you better.

257
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,190
But then do you know what happened?

258
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,110
What?

259
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,400
I grew up.

260
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,020
That's what normally 
comes after childhood.

261
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,310
Sometimes..

262
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,220
Eventually, the questions 
inside me started hating poetry.

263
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,340
Even I hate poetry.

264
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,340
Questions like why 
aren't people happy.

265
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,840
Who am I? 
What is the meaning of life?

266
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,830
I felt lost..

267
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,450
Till the age of 15, 
I didn't realise it..

268
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,200
And suddenly I felt really bad to 
find out that I don't have a father.

269
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,110
Wow!

270
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,150
What do you mean wow?

271
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,110
Wow, I mean..

272
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,190
..your story is so painful.

273
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,310
Wow.

274
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,550
Then I asked my mom, 
mom, where is dad?

275
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,300
Do you know what she said?

276
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,300
He's dead.

277
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,210
No.

278
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,330
She smiled and said no idea.

279
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,790
I said what do you mean by no idea.

280
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,740
She said you have three options.

281
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
You have three fathers?

282
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,280
Three options..

283
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,530
..and one of them is my father.

284
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,110
Understood.

285
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,190
Understood what?

286
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,300
So there is a 33.333 
percent chance..

287
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,680
..that you're my papa.

288
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,240
Are you out of your mind?

289
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,740
Why do you drink if 
you can't handle alcohol?

290
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,440
It's true. There's a 33.333 
percent chance that you're my papa.

291
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,600
Get out.

292
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,600
You're uttering nonsense.

293
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,390
I am no one's papa, understand.

294
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,090
Take a look..

295
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,920
A picture of your Amsterdam trip.

296
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,210
That's where you met my mom.

297
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,420
You two met..

298
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,250
..and nine months later I was born.

299
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,190
Don't be scared.

300
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
I didn't come here to claim 
any stake in your property.

301
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,440
We just need to get a DNA test, 
that's all.

302
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,390
There are two more contestants 
in this competition.

303
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,050
One of them is dead and 
the other one is in Paris.

304
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,260
I am sorry, 
Tia, but your claim doesn't stand.

305
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,500
Because your mom and I never 
did it without using safety..

306
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
I mean..

307
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,370
I never bat without 
wearing a guard.

308
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,040
I have a tab at the medical store.

309
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
I am sorry, 
but I am not your father.

310
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,190
Your father is in Paris, and if he 
isn't then I am sorry for your loss.

311
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,030
But I am not getting 
a DNA test done.

312
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,270
Understand.

313
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,470
Where is your mom?

314
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,220
Amsterdam.

315
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,130
She misses you a lot.

316
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,410
Just kidding.

317
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,620
She is very happy in her life.

318
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,530
By the way, 
do you do anything for a living..

319
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,650
..or do you just dress up and party.

320
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,190
I am a very busy man.

321
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,350
I've a Real Estate, 
Transport, Courier business.

322
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,890
Wow..

323
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,810
Rich dad, huh!

324
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,340
When will we get the results?

325
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,300
Three days.

326
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,630
So soon.

327
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,800
That depends..

328
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,330
If the reports are positive, 
then you'll find out..

329
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,040
..after 21 years that you're my dad.

330
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,790
I am not your dad.

331
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,000
Ms. Tia, you're next.

332
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,030
Okay, then.

333
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,900
Okay..

334
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,270
See you in three days, I'm excited!

335
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,940
Okay. Bye.

336
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,750
Jazz..

337
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,460
You okay?

338
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,370
Rhea, do you have kids?

339
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,120
No.

340
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,740
Wait..why?

341
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,450
Just..

342
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,700
Finally, you want a family.

343
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,990
Never. I am a lion.

344
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,860
And a lion is the king 
as long as he's alone.

345
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Family makes a man loser.

346
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,890
Are you telling me or trying 
to convince yourself.

347
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,310
You know what, just accept it.

348
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,180
We're in the phase of life, where 
our past is longer than our future.

349
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,170
And anyway..

350
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,710
..everyone needs a family.

351
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,710
Not me.

352
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,830
Fine, I do..

353
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,920
But I can have a future with myself.

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,330
You know what, you should 
try a serious relationship.

355
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,120
Are you hitting on me?

356
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,950
Excuse me, I've already 
crossed you out long ago.

357
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,030
And anyway, after my divorce 
I know exactly what I don't want.

358
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,230
Wow..

359
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,110
Wow Rhea, 
you're the reflection of my life.

360
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,820
"The Suit Suits me.."

361
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,400
"The Suit Suits me.."

362
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,610
"I look Punjabi.."

363
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,940
"I look amazing.."

364
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,100
"I look different.."

365
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,810
Bro..

366
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,640

367
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,930
We will invest.

368
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,170
And Grower will be 
the face of the project.

369
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,840
Permissions will 
be our responsibility.

370
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,040
Vacating the property will be yours.

371
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,710
For this, you will be paid 2%

372
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
2%

373
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,580
But we want more.

374
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,450
Sorry, what?

375
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,870
He means he wants more.

376
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,150
Well..this deal can make you 
boys the best broker in London.

377
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,280
That we already are.

378
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,680
Eat only what you can digest.

379
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,760
No..

380
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,260
Eat as much as you work hard.

381
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,590
The residents can be difficult.

382
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,630
Jazz lives there.

383
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,420
And they trust him.

384
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
He is the guy.

385
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,330
Done.

386
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,870
4%

387
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,450
Done deal, sir.

388
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,900
1..2..3.. Cheers!

389
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,140
You dance really well.

390
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,800
- Really? 
- Yes?

391
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,760
You like it?

392
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,930
Yes, I do like it.

393
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,710
What is your name?

394
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,630
Tanvi.

395
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,820
What happened?

396
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,570
Your perfume.

397
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,480
Lavender, and a hint of Vanilla.

398
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,570
How do you know?

399
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,350
Gucci Rush.

400
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,140
That beautiful 
fragrance of the '90s..

401
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,270
..which is hard to find these days, tell me 
the truth have u stolen it from your mom?

402
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,140
What?

403
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,560
This perfume and your eyes..

404
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,510
Can someone stop time.

405
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,800
I don't want this 
night to end, Tanya.

406
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
Tanvi..

407
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,460
No..

408
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,330
You're a cat.

409
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Meow..and I'm going to eat you.

410
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,870
No, no, don't eat me.

411
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,160
I am coming to get you.

412
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,070
No.

413
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,900
Oh yes, I am going 
to come and eat you.

414
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,990
No, I am scared.

415
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,150
Oh you are my cutie pie.

416
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,150
And I am going to eat you all up.

417
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,520
I am coming.

418
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,020
I am coming.

419
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,430
I am coming.

420
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,600
Gotcha!

421
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,760
I am going to eat you.

422
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,970
Hi..

423
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,920
Who is she?

424
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,590
Hi, Tia.

425
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,960
Nice to meet you.

426
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,750
Sorry, I didn't mean 
to interrupt you two.

427
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,530
Jazz, can I talk 
to you for a second?

428
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,330
No.

429
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,240
Please, you've no clue 
what happened with me tonight.

430
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,280
Please, can I stay 
at your place tonight?

431
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,570
No, no, no!

432
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,740
Who is she?

433
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,110
Daughter..

434
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,190
Of my brother.

435
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,690
Your niece.

436
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,940
That is no way to 
talk to your family.

437
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,980
Go on, speak to her.

438
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
I'll wait.

439
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,470
You promise you won't go anywhere.

440
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,630
I am not going anywhere 
without eating you.

441
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,590
And then he came on to me.

442
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,880
I said back off you pervert, 
go to hell..

443
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,500
You can keep the money, 
and I am going over..

444
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,540
..to my uncle's place.

445
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,080
Since I live in Amsterdam.

446
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,120
Can I have some cookies, please?

447
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,570
You did the right thing 
by coming over here.

448
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,730
Because every girl 
is safe with Jazz.

449
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,980
Isn't that right, Jazz?

450
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,980
Anyway, you look really tired.

451
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,850
You take some rest 
and I'll see you soon.

452
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,520
- Okay. You take care of yourself. 
- You too.

453
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,140
Okay, Jazz, I am leaving now. 
I'll see you.

454
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,300
Wait, wait, wait..

455
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
Why are you leaving?

456
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,550
We have a room.

457
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,000
Jazz, she's right there.

458
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,960
Doesn't seem nice. 
Don't worry.

459
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,790
Then, I'll come with you.

460
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,990
Where do you live?

461
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,740
Look after Tia, she looks harrowed.

462
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,650
Don't worry, I'll take a cab.

463
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,110
See you.

464
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,730
By the way, 
you two look quite similar.

465
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,550
Spent my childhood studying.

466
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,460
And soon after I grew into an adult.

467
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,460
And as I became an adult, 
I got married.

468
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,870
My husband liked to drink..

469
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,990
..and whenever we got time..

470
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,740
..we would drown ourselves in beer.

471
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,110
But as I grew older, 
I stopped drinking beer.

472
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,980
Because I couldn't stop burping.

473
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,810
Now I only have gin and tonic.

474
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,430
Gin and tonic is 
my favourite drink too.

475
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,430
- Really? 
- Yes.

476
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,640
- Let's have it tonight. 
- Okay done.

477
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,090
What about Biryani?

478
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,590
- I love Biryani. 
- Really?

479
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,170
Then let's meet in the evening.

480
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,090
Okay, done.

481
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,040
- I'll see you later then. 
- Okay..

482
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,340
- Bye. 
- Bye.

483
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,950
Look at you.

484
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Good morning.

485
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,650
Why was Mrs. Malika here?

486
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,360
She came to ask for the rent.

487
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,980
I said we'll send it soon.

488
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,360
- Why didn't you call me? 
- You were sleeping.

489
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,690
Then you should've woken me up.

490
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,770
What is that?

491
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,890
It's a kitten.

492
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,810
Poor thing was crying 
outside the window.

493
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,970
Kitten?

494
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,850
Tia, this is my home, not a zoo.

495
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,390
And I didn't want to 
create a scene last night..

496
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,220
..but what you did is not cool.

497
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,550
Tanya is my girlfriend.

498
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,880
That's Tanvi, not Tanya.

499
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,670
Really?

500
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,500
Her name is Tanvi?

501
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,750
Whatever. But you cannot do this.

502
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,070
The DNA test results 
will arrive at 5 pm today.

503
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,860
I don't know what the 
Results are going to be..

504
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,320
..but I wanted to 
spend some time with you

505
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,190
That's all.

506
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,140
You know..

507
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,350
..I hope you are my daughter.

508
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,560
Really?

509
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,600
No!

510
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,130
Tia.. Tia.. Tia..

511
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,960
Sing Chow Lou..

512
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,330
This can't be you.

513
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,490
Tia..

514
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,300
Do you know why I became a doctor?

515
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,880
It's for this day.

516
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,670
What is the link that 
connects love and truth..

517
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,670
..in its purest form?

518
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,500
Don't know.

519
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,160
Medical Science. Come on.

520
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,540
Take this report for instance..

521
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,370
I didn't mean physically, 
take it as an example.

522
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,240
This is the link that 
connects love and truth.

523
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,690
Can you please tell us the results?

524
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,270
Of course. 
This is why you are here.

525
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,140
Hello, Dr. Kriplani here.

526
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,680
It's you, baby.

527
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,390
Cook whatever you like.

528
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,430
Everything you cook 
is always delicious.

529
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,590
Make some okra.

530
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,800
We had that two days ago.

531
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Then potatoes.

532
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,090
Yes, right potatoes are fattening.

533
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,670
Cottage cheese..

534
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,120
Yes, cottage cheese..

535
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,750
Not porridge, cottage cheese.

536
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,210
Cottage cheese, baby.

537
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,500
Hello..

538
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,660
My wife, very good cook.

539
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,650
So..

540
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,230
So according to your reports..

541
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,140
He will have cottage cheese.

542
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,760
She says she will make it.

543
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,680
Tell us the results.

544
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,970
Yeah..

545
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,090
So..

546
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,880
..as the report says..

547
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,550
..congratulations to both of you.

548
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,170
Why?

549
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,880
Because you are going to be parents.

550
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,830
- Parents? 
- Yes..

551
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,290
You'll be the mother, 
he'll be the father. Parents.

552
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,200
I think you've got it wrong.

553
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,030
We just got a DNA test done.

554
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,490
DNA?

555
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,650
Oh yes..

556
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,730
I am so sorry, my mistake.

557
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,020
Like I said..

558
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,730
..I cannot be the father.

559
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,060
Why? Some gent's problem?

560
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,640
No, just asking.

561
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,390
Just asking..

562
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,340
Because your reports 
don't show any such problems..

563
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,970
..since you are the father.

564
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,500
And she is your daughter.

565
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,130
And along with that..

566
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,870
..your daughter is pregnant as well.

567
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,160
So you're going to become a mother.

568
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,910
And technically speaking, 
you're going to be a grandfather.

569
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,230
I am so happy.

570
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,890
Who is the father?

571
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,640
You?

572
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,390
No..

573
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,090
Who is the father of your child?

574
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,720
Rohan. My ex-boyfriend.

575
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,300
I love him, 
but he loves his freedom more.

576
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,420
He's scared of commitment.

577
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,290
So what should we do now?

578
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,490
About what? Rohan, you being 
my father, or the pregnancy?

579
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,900
About you.

580
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't know. 
I don't have any experience in this.

581
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,600
Can I stay with you tonight?

582
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,890
I don't want to be alone.

583
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,060
Please.

584
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,170
Must be a fused bulb.

585
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,570
Jazz..

586
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,110
Don't call me Jazz.

587
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,570
Dad.

588
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,940
Jazz is fine.

589
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,890
Do you know how long I've 
waited for this day?

590
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,640
Like the sun waits for the monsoons.

591
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,390
I waited all my life.

592
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,890
And finally when it rained..

593
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,130
..my life was also flooded 
by this pregnancy news.

594
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,550
Life never goes 
according to your plan.

595
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,380
Strange.

596
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,950
There's a letter here..

597
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,450
..from the electricity board.

598
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,320
What does it say?

599
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,740
To Mr. Jaswinder Singh, 
c/o Mrs. Malika Zaid..

600
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,490
Thank you. Thank you.

601
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,270
What's written inside the letter?

602
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,400
Oh..

603
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,640
Says your electricity has been 
disconnected due to non-payment of bill.

604
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,510
What?

605
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,830
Jazz.

606
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,750
Hi..

607
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,540
What are you doing here?

608
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,910
I just bought this huge property..

609
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,240
..and had to get the electricity 
connection set up.

610
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,820
Next.

611
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,610
Sir, your line has 
been disconnected, right?

612
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,440
What?

613
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,070
They must have disconnected your 
line due to non-payment of bill.

614
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,350
Sharon, where do defaulters go?

615
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,230
- Defaulters? 
- Yeah.

616
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,890
Where do defaulters go?

617
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,680
Defaulters?

618
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,220
That way.

619
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,390
That way.

620
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,260
I am not a defaulter.

621
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,300
Good Indian.

622
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,790
Jazz..

623
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,950
Are you done here?

624
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,740
Yes..

625
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,700
They made a mistake.

626
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,360
But it's done now.

627
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,450
Everything is fine.

628
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,070
Okay, look.

629
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,110
I am going through a little problem.

630
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,310
But things will be fine soon.

631
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,770
There's a deal, 
and I've almost cracked it.

632
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,770
Once it's done, everything 
will be again top of the pop.

633
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,970
Jazz, in case you need some money..

634
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,970
No..

635
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,340
That's not what I meant.

636
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,380
Everything is A-Okay.

637
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,340
See you.

638
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,590
Bye.

639
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,040
Sorry, it's a bit cold.

640
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,330
Alright.

641
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,980
So..that right there is your uterus.

642
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,650
And that's the placenta.

643
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,480
And that..

644
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,310
..right there..is your baby.

645
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,840
It's only as tiny 
as a bean at the moment.

646
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,630
But in a couple of weeks..

647
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,670
..those little lumps..

648
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,370
..will become hands and little feet.

649
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,200
And That..that right 
there is his head.

650
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,270
It's amazing, isn't it?

651
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,890
Greetings.

652
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,220
Go ahead.

653
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,720
I know I can't pay 
your rent on time.

654
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,300
Forgive me for the delay.

655
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,420
Your daughter's 
already paid your rent.

656
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,040
Wait here. I'll be right back.

657
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,730
This is chicken tikka, made at home.

658
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,110
Tia loves it.

659
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,110
Give it to her. 
Don't eat it yourself.

660
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,110
Take it.

661
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,380
Why did you tell Mrs. 
Malika that you're my daughter?

662
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,380
- I didn't tell her. 
- Don't lie to me.

663
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,840
She must have assumed.

664
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,750
Girls never stay here for 
more than one night, do they?

665
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,590
Very smart.

666
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,580
Did she send these?

667
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,790
Don't pay my rent next time.

668
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,080
Sorry.

669
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,330
I thought you needed some help.

670
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,410
I don't need anyone.

671
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,150
I forgot to go to the bank, 
that's it.

672
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Okay, but if you need money 
then I have some.

673
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,400
That's my champagne bucket.

674
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,060
Sorry, I thought that's a vase.

675
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,180
Next time don't do anything 
here without asking me.

676
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,470
I don't like changes.

677
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,930
Okay, I am sorry.

678
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,260
I am sorry.

679
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,210
I need to talk to you.

680
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,630
Can you please sit?

681
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,460
Sorry.

682
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,870
Please sit.

683
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,570
I've decided.

684
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,450
I am keeping it.

685
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,610
What?

686
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,320
Keeping the baby.

687
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,690
Okay.

688
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,680
Did you talk to your mother?

689
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,890
I can't contact her.

690
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:31,970
Is she in jail?

691
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,510
No phone, no internet, till her 
Vipasana course doesn't get over.

692
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,430
How long.

693
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,470
6 days or maybe 6 months.

694
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,130
And your boyfriend.

695
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,000
That idiot.

696
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,330
Doesn't make a difference to him.

697
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,210
What do you mean doesn't 
make a difference?

698
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,250
He's the child's father.

699
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,910
Will he take responsibility or not?

700
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,290
My question exactly.

701
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,820
I want to deliver here.

702
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,110
What do you mean here?

703
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,230
Here..

704
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,230
..with you.

705
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,090
It's shocking..

706
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,960
..for both of us.

707
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,660
I..

708
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,490
We can't think straight.

709
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,410
Since this is our 
first time as parents.

710
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:43,860
Okay..

711
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:46,730
Okay..

712
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,940
What do you see?

713
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,680
A very scared man.

714
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,520
No.

715
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,220
A normal man..

716
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,930
..who turns into a monster 
when his freedom is threatened.

717
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,550
And who would like to 
raise a baby around a monster?

718
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,710
You might think that 
I am trying to get rid of you.

719
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,130
No. No.

720
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,920
We'll chat on the phone every day.

721
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,370
I'll visit you a couple 
of times in a year.

722
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,750
Send gifts on occasions.

723
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,370
But right now I cannot take 
responsibility of something as big as this.

724
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,660
I cannot do it.

725
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:23,110
I'll book your ticket 
to Amsterdam.

726
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,900
And anyway..

727
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,690
..a pregnant girl should stay 
with her mother for her own sake.

728
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,860
I get it.

729
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,140
No need to book tickets. 
I will leave today itself.

730
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,120
Here you go.

731
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,830
If you need anything, 
please let me know.

732
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,700
Thank you.

733
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,630
"Youth's on a fervor."

734
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,580
"Love is crazy."

735
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,080
"Youth's on a fervor."

736
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,030
"Love is crazy."

737
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,240
"I want to shower my love on you."

738
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,530
"Come and take me in your arms."

739
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,110
"No, no, no.."

740
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,850
"Don't steal my heart."

741
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,520
"Don't steal my heart."

742
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,010
"Youth's on a fervor."

743
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,850
"Love is crazy."

744
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,880
"I want to shower my love on you."

745
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,760
"Come and take me in your arms."

746
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,750
"No, no, no.."

747
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,830
Hello.

748
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,290
Hi, it's Tia.

749
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,290
Just a second, Tia.

750
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,950
Sorry..

751
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,070
..I was on the treadmill.

752
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,190
Did you reach Amsterdam?

753
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,650
I called up to say just that..

754
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:48,940
Cool.

755
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,310
Listen, can you a 
call-back a little later.

756
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,310
I am busy at the moment.

757
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,430
Okay. 
I just wanted to tell you..

758
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,020
Text me, please.

759
00:47:58,850 --> 00:47:59,930
- Okay? 
- Fine..

760
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,640
Okay then, let's talk later.

761
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,920
You're looking cute in the bathrobe.

762
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,170
What?

763
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,630
Red bathrobe.

764
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,250
- Where are you? 
- Here.

765
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,200
- Where here? 
- Here.

766
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,530
Where here, Tia?

767
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,820
Look here..

768
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,030
Outside your window.

769
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,010
What are you doing here?

770
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,260
Can you believe I 
got this place on Airbnb?

771
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,880
What did we decide?

772
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,750
- What? 
- What did we decide?

773
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,380
That I will leave..

774
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,540
And.

775
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,960
And I left.

776
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,330
I said I want my freedom.

777
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,870
So I gave you your freedom.

778
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:02,780
This?

779
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,490
Feels like I am living 
in Big Boss' home.

780
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,490
Please..

781
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,900
No, listen. I cannot do this.

782
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,190
I need my privacy. 
You can't look at me.

783
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,980
Do you do anything illegal?

784
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,940
What?

785
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,230
- No. 
- Then?

786
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,350
Then?

787
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,020
Do you feel guilty looking at me?

788
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,680
Or embarrassed?

789
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,580
Poor Rocky.

790
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,120
He was a happy, and a cheerful guy.

791
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,120
How did he suddenly die?

792
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,450
He's alive but wants to die.

793
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,570
Some girl showed out of nowhere, 
who is his daughter.

794
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,490
And she is pregnant herself.

795
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,110
Meaning he didn't just become 
a father, but a grandfather.

796
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,230
Not to mention that 
she wants to live with him.

797
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,190
That's such a great story.

798
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,890
Your friend is really lucky.

799
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,680
These things only happen in movies.

800
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,470
Horror movies.

801
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,930
Look, your friend's 
life is going to change.

802
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,640
He already looks like he's doomed.

803
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,260
And the poor guy's still so young.

804
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,970
How young is your friend?

805
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,720
Rocky..

806
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,510
I mean..

807
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,460
..he's young.

808
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,790
As young as Nazia?

809
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:28,410
No.

810
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,250
As young as me?

811
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,500
No.

812
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,080
Oh, wait, as young as you.

813
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,870
He's in trouble, Rhea.

814
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,990
Poor guy was living 
an independent life.

815
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:37,990
He's stupid.

816
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,150
And even though his name is Jazz, 
he's calling himself Rocky.

817
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,650
Come on, Jazz. Congratulations.

818
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,940
You could never have 
had a family on your own.

819
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,310
And God's blessed with you 
everything without any extra effort.

820
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,510
I can die.

821
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,800
Will you relax?

822
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,930
Your life has a new purpose.

823
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,930
All this sounds so sweet..

824
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,170
..but please don't 
tell anyone about this.

825
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,710
I'll be devastated.

826
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,750
Okay, grandpa.

827
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,390
Two shots, please.

828
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,850
Hey Jazz, what's up?

829
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:30,760
Come Join us.

830
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,800
I am not in the mood.

831
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,420
Have some shots.

832
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:35,380
No thanks .

833
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,840
Leave it, uncle looks tired.

834
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,840
Okay.

835
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,120
Two shots, please.

836
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,180
Yo..no music.

837
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,510
What?

838
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,050
Three shots, please.

839
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
No music! No music!

840
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,370

Jazz you don't need to do this

873
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,320
I'm fine.

874
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,320

No music!

886
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,300
Where did you stick 
your foot in this time?

887
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,590
Cricket.

888
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,580
Is that your new codeword?

889
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,330
I fell off the bar.

890
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,830
You should act 
according to your age.

891
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,280
What now?

892
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,910
It will get better in 2 weeks.

893
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,200
Not you.

894
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,070
What about Mrs. Malika?

895
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,730
I'll talk to her.

896
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,680
Greetings, aunty.

897
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,640
That's my brother Dimpy.

898
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,640
We're here to talk 
about your property.

899
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,380
I got to know, 
but I don't want to sell.

900
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,130
It's a pretty nice deal.

901
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,460
You have three homes, and..

902
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,840
..you can ask the 
builder to pay extra.

903
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,210
I said I don't want to sell.

904
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,580
Mrs. Malika, 
the deal is on hold because of you.

905
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,370
Don't you want to 
continue living there?

906
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,140
Happy Birthday to me.

907
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,600
Happy Birthday, Rocky.

908
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,510
Bartender..let the booze flow so 
they go crawling back to their home.

909
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,760
Guys, the drinks are on the house.

910
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,290
I need more drinks.

911
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,490
It's your birthday.

912
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,490
- Happy Birthday, Rocky. 
- Rocky..my brother.

913
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,360
Happy birthday.

914
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,740
Lets burn the dance floor.

915
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,400
Hi.

916
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,230
Rhea.

917
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,190
Jazz.

918
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,560
- Wow.. 
- Thank you.

919
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,520
How come you are here?

920
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,310
You're not the only one who 
gets his hair dyed at my place.

921
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,390
You mean..

922
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,100
Original. Original.

923
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,050
Where is your drink?

924
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,090
- Yeah, where is your drink? 
- No, I have a broken leg.

925
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,550
- I am on anti biotics. 
- Come on, it's his birthday.

926
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,340
- Can I have a glass of water please. 
- No no no water.. Come on, come on.

927
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,790
Whiskey is the best anti biotic. 
Get him one more. One more.

929
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,380
Jazz..

930
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,840
..where is your home?

931
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,880
There means what?

932
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,210
Jazz..

933
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,130
Jazz..

934
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,410
..what do you want?

935
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,580
I want Malika aunty's home.

936
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,660
Malika aunty..

937
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,860
..please give me your home.

938
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:34,820
Jazz..

939
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,060
You have a nice home.

940
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,020
Good morning.

941
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,720
How did I get here?

942
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,350
Alcohol is not advisable 
when you're on antibiotics.

943
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,590
I am sorry, Rhea.

944
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,460
What happened yesterday?

945
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,460
A lot..

946
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,160
Did anything happen..

947
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,950
..between us?

948
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,450
It was amazing.

949
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,480
Nothing happened, you idiot.

950
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,730
Oh, man..

951
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,560
Why not.

952
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,350
Because I am your age, 
and that's too old for you.

953
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,470
And anyway, I am not your type.

954
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,130
You don't have a type, Rhea.

955
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,800
You're different.

956
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,540
I wish my ex-husband knew that.

957
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,620
You know, 
I always wanted a relationship..

958
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,370
..where I would feel belonged.

959
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,990
But I never found that intimacy.

960
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,910
Jazz, what are you doing?

961
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,580
What are you doing?

962
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,040
What were you doing?

963
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,120
- I thought.. 
- No, what.. What did you think?

964
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,570
I thought..

965
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,740
What did you think?

966
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,530
- I thought we had a moment. 
- No!

967
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,610
I had an emotional moment.

968
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,610
And you were hitting on me.

969
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,690
We're friends, Jazz.

970
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,110
I am sorry.

971
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,020
Jazz..

972
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,520
..you're amazing.

973
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,890
But you behave like 
this with other girls.

974
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:32,170
Can't we try real friendship?

975
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,870
Jazz..

976
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,660
I am just joking.

977
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,470
Move grand dad .. 
your father must be one!

[indistinct chatter]

979
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:15,230
Listen, I'll send the 
manuscript over for translation.

980
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,480
Okay, perfect.

981
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,430
Hi..

982
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,300
Hi.

983
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,130
He's Jazz..

984
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,670
They are from Oxford Publications.

985
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,790
They are here to discuss 
some translation work.

986
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:36,670
We'll be in touch.

987
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,540
What are you doing here?

988
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,280
I..

989
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,030
I just came to say hi.

990
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,070
See you.

991
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,690
What's wrong with your leg?

992
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:54,820
I was playing football.

993
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,860
At this age?

994
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:59,640
Come, I'll drop you home.

995
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,930
No, I'll manage.

996
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:03,350
Ohh..

997
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,720
..there's something 
I want to show you.

998
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:06,720
Just one minute.

999
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,050
I'll be right back.

1000
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,720
- Tia. 
- I'll be right back.

1001
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,080
Why isn't it working?

1002
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,870
I don't know. 
It was working fine until yesterday.

1003
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:19,620
What did you want to show me?

1004
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,860
My sonography.

1005
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,990
Leave the pen drive behind, 
I'll watch it later.

1006
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,070
Are you okay?

1007
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,190
I am feeling sick, 
it's been like this since morning.

1008
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,730
What happened?

1009
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,220
Hello.

1010
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:41,300
Where are you?

1011
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,300
At home, why?

1012
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,760
I'll be there in two minutes.

1013
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,340
Two minutes?

1014
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,750
Hello. Hello..

1015
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,250
Sh**

1016
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,330
Better?

1017
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,580
Listen, Tia. 
I'll watch your sonography later.

1018
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,700
You're not well. 
Go home.

1019
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:00,700
Why?

1020
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,530
Okay, my brother is coming over.

1021
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,400
Uncle.

1022
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,060
But he's not normal.

1023
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:12,980
I want to meet him.

1024
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,980
No, no, Tia, 
this is not the right time.

1025
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,230
I'll introduce you two later.

1026
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,850
I won't say a word.

1027
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,180
I just want to see him.

1028
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,010
He's an ugly guy.

1029
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
Why do you want to see him?

1030
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,260
Just once. Please.

1031
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,210
Please.

1032
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:29,670
Okay.

1033
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,750
One look, and you leave.

1034
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,000
And if anyone asks, 
then we're just good friends.

1035
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,960
Nothing more.

1036
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,830
You should at least 
check your messages.

1037
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,120
I don't expect you to give a reply.

1038
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,610
But those two ticks at least 
indicate that you're still alive.

1039
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,360
Hi.

1040
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,070
Hello.

1041
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,650
That's Tia, my friend.

1042
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,730
And that's Dimpy, my brother.

1043
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,390
It's so nice to meet you.

1044
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:06,430
What happened?

1045
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,590
Who is she?

1046
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,090
No one.

1047
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,090
She's as old as 
your daughter, Jassi.

1048
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,960
Stop calling her my daughter.

1049
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,210
Who is?

1050
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,040
Then get to the point.

1051
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:18,870
Grover came over.

1052
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,290
He was asking about Malika.

1053
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,490
Investors are putting 
pressure on him.

1054
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,160
Buy some more time 
from the investors.

1055
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,240
I'll handle everything.

1056
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,650
What about Mrs. Malika?

1057
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,030
I'll find a way.

1058
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,150
Calm down.

1059
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,560
Meow..

1060
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:36,980
Hi..

1061
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,480
Tan..vi..

1062
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,680
Sorry to drop in unannounced.

1063
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,590
I heard you met with an accident.

1064
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,430
So I came over to check on you.

1065
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,920
You're so sweet..

1066
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,340
..and caring too.

1067
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,750
But right now we're having 
some family problems at home.

1068
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,700
Actually, my brother is 
having some girlfriend trouble.

1069
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,990
And my health is also...

1070
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,610
Can we meet tomorrow, please?

1071
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,610
I thought since today is a Sunday, 
you'll be kind of free.

1072
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,520
Today is Sunday.

1073
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,440
Jassi..

1074
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,220
- Mom, Dad.. 
- Take the bags?

1075
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,100
So you can come 
to work from tomorrow.

1076
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,590
I'll pay you extra for the dishes.

1077
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,050
Meow..

1078
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,790
She doesn't look like a maid..

1079
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,000
Yes, she is educated.

1080
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:41,830
But likes to clean.

1081
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,370
Where does her mother work?

1082
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:47,120
By the way, I hope your brother 
patches up with her girlfriend.

1083
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:48,370
Bye.

1084
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,070
What?

1085
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,400
kunal loves football.

1086
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,280
And Khushi..

1087
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,150
Khushi is busy with 
her dollhouses all the time.

1088
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,770
You know, when I was young 
I used to love dollhouses.

1089
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,020
Are you serious?

1090
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,430
So Dimpy, what's going on?

1091
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,050
Tia, they are Dimpy's parents.

1092
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:11,470
Mine too.

1093
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,080
Hello.

1094
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:29,160
Hello.

1095
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,910
Greetings.

1096
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,150
Sorry, I am a little nervous.

1097
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,360
No need to be nervous. 
We're all family.

1098
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:39,980
Sorry.

1099
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,230
Please excuse me.

1100
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,470
You guys take a seat, 
and I'll be right back.

1101
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,170
All okay?

1102
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,610
There, you got your wish. 
Are you happy now?

1103
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,320
Hello, Greetings..

1104
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,530
Now leave. Please, leave.

1105
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,530
I beg you.

1106
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,610
But we haven't even 
been introduced properly.

1107
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,480
Do you want them to 
go for a DNA test as well?

1108
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,520
So..

1109
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,350
So it's been going on like this..

1110
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:19,770
For how long?

1111
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,930
Couple of months..

1112
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,390
The deal's finally sealed.

1113
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,090
Once that woman signs the papers, 
then that's it.

1114
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,800
Otherwise, I'll lose on this one.

1115
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,540
Dimpy, you have a wife and kids, 
but no shame.

1116
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,630
What?

1117
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,080
What are you guys saying?

1118
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:38,460
Yes, of course, Mr. Grover.

1119
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,000
Yes... 
We're on our way.

1120
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,120
That was Grover on the phone.

1121
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,280
We've to leave now.

1122
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:46,610
So..you guys go home.

1123
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,910
Dimpy and I will come over.

1124
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,950
Great.

1125
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,900
We're being forced out of the house.

1126
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,070
Are you going to say something?

1127
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,730
There's no reason 
to be sentimental, mom.

1128
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,770
What is that?

1129
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,230
My projector, but it doesn't work.

1130
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,730
What is that?

1131
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,970
That's my sonography.

1132
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,390
What ..

1133
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,180
You..

1134
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,800
..you are pregnant.

1135
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:07,760
Yes.

1136
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,630
Dimpy..

1137
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,460
You stupid fool..

1138
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,050
Oh you!

1139
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,670
I've done nothing.

1140
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,670
Weren't you ashamed to have an 
affair with a young girl like her?

1141
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,120
Shame on you.

1142
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,160
Please listen to me

1143
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,370
Wait a second..

1144
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,990
You're getting me wrong.

1145
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,570
Mom! 
Mom!

1146
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,570
This is my child.

1147
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,690
This is your child?

1148
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:37,560
No..

1149
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,600
This is my child.

1150
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,140
This is your child and she's 
pregnant with Dimpy's child..

1151
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,430
Mom..

1152
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,390
She is my daughter, I am her father.

1153
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,970
And she is pregnant 
with her boyfriend's child.

1154
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,010
Dimpy is her uncle.

1155
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,260
You're her grandparents..

1156
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,920
..and now you two are soon 
to become great grandparents.

1157
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,160
Don't listen to him.

1158
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,580
Come home whenever you want to.

1159
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,540
Okay

1160
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,660
Take care.

1161
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,120
I've never felt so happy before.

1162
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:43,700
I came looking for my father 
but found a family instead.

1163
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,070
Thank you.

1164
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,110
Goodnight.

1165
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,060
Tia..

1166
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,010
Yes.

1167
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:01,550
Come home.

1168
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

1169
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:03,720
No.

1170
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,510
Bring your stuff.

1171
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,920

moments together.."

01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,730
"..and spend some moments 
together right now."

"Let's not make any promises, 
whether big or small."

1177
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,630
"..don't stop to think."

01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,460
Excuse me, I am looking for Tia.

1212
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:29,410
Tia. There, room no. 3.

1213
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:37,280
Tia.

1214
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,450
Are you okay?

1215
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:40,570
What happened?

1216
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,530
Hiccups.

1217
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,150
Hiccups?

1218
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,650
I was getting hiccups 
and got scared.

1219
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,440
False alarm.

1220
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,190
Thank God.

1221
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,480
Yeah..

1222
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,220
I am thinking about telling Rohan.

1223
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,390
You haven't told your boyfriend yet.

1224
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:01,220
And anyway, 
what will he do when he finds out.

1225
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,300
Relax, he's a nice guy.

1226
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,960
Fine, tell him.

1227
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,130
All the best.

1228
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,870
But don't get your hopes too high.

1229
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,290
Men brag about how brave 
they are all their lives.

1230
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,740
But pregnancy scares 
them out of their wits.

1231
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,740
Why are you wearing 
sunglasses at night?

1232
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,360
What are you? Feroz Khan?

1233
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,480

1234
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:28,520

Cupcakes, 
pastries, and chocolate brownies.

1238
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,330
What's the reason for all this love?

1239
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,200
What do you want in return?

1240
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,280
She's beginning to understand me.

1241
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,990
No, but I am getting to know you.

1242
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,070
Okay, we need some 
help with our business?

1243
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,650
Is it anything illegal?

1244
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,940
Do we look the goony type to you?

1245
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,060
Not us, just you.

1246
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,140
Okay, tell me.

1247
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:12,770
The deal's stuck 
because of one owner.

1248
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,060
She doesn't seem to agree..

1249
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,300
..and the investors 
are putting pressure on us.

1250
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,590
I fear that they 
might cancel the deal.

1251
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,510
Okay.

1252
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,260
And the owner is Mrs. Malika.

1253
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,920
Okay, I can try.

1254
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,780
Hi!

1255
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,200
How are you?

1256
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,450
I am fine, how are you?

1257
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,240
I'm good. 
Seeing you after a long time.

1258
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,610
Yeah, I know I was 
a little tied up..

1259
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:15,250
Oh so sorry, I forgot to call.

1260
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,490
What do you mean you forgot?

1261
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,240
Come up..

1262
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:21,950
Come up..

Let it be.

1273
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,350
You always give me 
that goony type feeling..

1274
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,520
..which is why I never talk to you.

1275
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:21,390
But Tia explained me the 
deal so nicely, that I thought..

1276
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:26,180
..I should make this investment 
for my grandchildren.

01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,670
..you know everything 
about this deal.

1279
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,580
Yes.

1280
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,750
And you're ready to sign.

1281
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,160
- Yes.. 
- I mean..

1282
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:39,580
..if I bring the 
papers over tomorrow..

1283
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,080
..then you will sign.

1284
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,370
I am drinking alcohol, 
and you sound drunk.

1285
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,450
She is saying yes.

1286
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,150
I always knew she is your daughter.

1287
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,400
But what about your wife?

1288
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,110
She died in a car crash.

1289
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,480
Oh, I am so sorry.

1290
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,890
I'm bringing papers tomorrow.

1291
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,680
But I have one condition.

1292
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:01,720
What?

1293
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,390
When I was 5-years-old..

1294
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,260
..my father gave 
me a small willow tree.

1295
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,880
And said take care of it.

1296
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,000
Him and me, we grew up together.

1297
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:22,450
But look how tall he grew, 
and I didn't.

1298
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,120
Will they hack it down?

1299
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,610
But nothing grows on it.

1300
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,690
But I have many memories with it.

1301
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,980
Will this remain?

1302
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,070
Yes.

1303
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,690
Can I come over 
sometimes to take a look?

1304
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,100
Of course, whenever you want.

1305
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:41,100
Then it's fine!

1306
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,560
Bring the papers, and I'll sign it.

1307
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,510
Are you happy now?

1308
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,010
Oh yeah.

1309
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,920
Oh yeah.

1310
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:51,880
Oh yeah.

1311
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,050
Congratulations.

1312
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,340
Thank you.

1313
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,620
By the way, what are you going 
to make in this beautiful place?

1314
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,790
We'll make it more beautiful.

1315
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,080
Why? It's perfect.

1316
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,280
Perfect doesn't make money.

1317
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,820
And what will be my percentage?

1318
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,610
Ohh..

1319
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:15,440
What do you want?

1320
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,230
Just don't cut down her tree.

1321
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:20,390
Done.

1322
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,850
Congratulations, Singh Brothers.

1323
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,930
Finally you two got 
everyone's signatures.

1324
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,390
Actually, we're three now.

1325
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,380
Whatever..but you guys are great.

1326
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,380
Investors are very happy.

1327
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:35,380
As soon as the vacancy's done, 
we'll start construction.

1328
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,750
Will you let the tree be?

1329
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,120
What tree?

1330
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:41,420
The tree that's in the middle.

1331
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,790
The willow tree.

1332
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:46,040
Take the kids to the mall.

1333
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,240
We'll take care of 
the trees and gardens.

1334
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,030
Thanks to his quick thinking we're 
going to build towers in that place.

1335
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,820
And now he wants 
to bask in the garden.

1336
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:59,820
Rohan's coming.

1337
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:01,740
What?

1338
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,280
He wants to take me to Amsterdam.

1339
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,320
Where was he for nine months?

1340
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,230
With mom.

1341
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,230
They were both running 
a Vipassana course.

1342
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:09,980
It's pretty famous out there.

1343
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:13,720
Rich Indians come all the way to Amsterdam 
from India to enroll in this course.

1344
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,430
Jaswinder Singh.

1345
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:16,970
Yes, sir.

1346
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,050
Do you get sleep at nights?

1347
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,260
Yes...a good one!

1348
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,510
Shame. Do you have any shame?

1349
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,090
Does your word have any worth?

1350
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,670
What happened, sir?

1351
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:34,660
You sold me a property claiming 
it will be the next Soho.

1352
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,910
It's been five years.

1353
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,200
And the property's 
price has plummeted.

1354
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,450
What are you saying?

1355
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,860
Must be someone else.

1356
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,280
And anyway, that's your luck.

1357
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,940
If you haven't cheated, 
then what are you scared about.

1358
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,000
I hope you won't do the 
same thing with Mrs. Malika.

1359
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:15,540
No, I..

1360
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,410
Somethings are not in my control.

1361
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,990
And anyway, there's nothing Mrs. 
Malika can do.

1362
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,560
Good morning.

1363
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,560
Morning..

1364
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,850
Is it 3 o'clock already?

1365
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,180
Very funny.

1366
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:41,600
It's 9.

1367
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,840
In the morning.

1368
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,840
I'm Getting better.

1369
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,720
Of course.

1370
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,090
Early day at work?

1371
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,500
I am not going anywhere today.

1372
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,330
I want to chill 
with this little one.

1373
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,200
You're a very cute 
grandpa on the inside.

1374
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,060
Tia.

1375
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,480
Yes?

1376
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,480
Hey.. 
- Tia..

1377
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,430
Tia..

1378
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,590
Hi.

1379
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,470
Tia..

1380
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,260
Oh my, God.

1381
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,300
Tia..

1382
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,750
Look at this.

1383
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:38,250
Rohu.

1384
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,700
Rohu.

1385
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:40,990
Rohu.

1386
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,990
Mama, Rohan is unconscious.

1387
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,740
The energy in this 
house is not good.

1388
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:46,660
Whose house is it?

1389
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,700
Dad.

1390
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,690
Whose dad?

1391
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,860
My dad.

1392
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,150
You found him.

1393
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:53,900
Who is he?

1394
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,350
Guys, this is really embarrassing.

1395
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,880
I can't believe I've 
to introduce my mom to my dad.

1396
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,130
Mom, that's dad.

1397
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,670
Dad, that's mom.

1398
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:34,690
Papa, can you help, please?

1399
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,100
Are you sure this drug-addict 
is the father of your child?

1400
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,100
Why?

1401
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,760
Her father can be a sex-addict..

1402
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,100
..but lover can't be a drug addict.

1403
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,010
Mom..

1404
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,840
Is he dead?

1405
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,290
No, it's an old problem.

1406
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,790
He faints whenever 
he gets too emotional.

1407
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,000
What are you doing?

1408
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,750
Oh my, God. 
- Careful.

1409
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:01,790
What?

1410
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,040
Tia, are you sure this 
negative guy is your dad.

1411
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,490
Are you sure this 
hippie's your mother?

1412
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,910
Okay, guys, stop. 
Please, stop it.

1413
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,070
Rohu.

1414
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,860
Rohu baby, are you fine?

1415
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,570
Are you okay?

1416
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,730
Yeah..

1417
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:17,810
I mean..

1418
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,310
I missed you.

1419
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:21,350
I missed you too.

1420
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,930
- I love you. 
- I love you too.

1421
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,350
Shall we get married?

1422
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,890
I think I am hungry.

1423
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,550
Can I get something to eat?

1424
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,760
Can you please get something to eat?

1425
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,760
Of course, ma'am.

1426
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,810
You looked pretty sweet 
in your younger days, Jassi.

1427
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,440
It's Jazz.

1428
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:54,510
Between meditation and hashish, 
I found inner peace.

1429
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,800
But I took one look at 
you and my penance were broken.

1430
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:04,830
You completely disturbed my nirvana.

1431
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,210
"Can someone stop time."

1432
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:13,120
"I don't want this 
night to get over."

1433
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:16,740
Remember Jazz.

1434
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,200
Okay, I am sorry. Okay?

1435
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:23,360
Right now there's nothing I can do 
for you except make this sandwich.

1436
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,360
I don't want anything from you.

1437
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,060
The Universe is listening to me.

1438
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,390
What nonsense.

1439
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,840
You dye your hair.

1440
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,260
No.

1441
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,590
It's natural.

1442
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,170
Don't try to teach me about nature.

1443
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,300
It causes cancer.

1444
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,580
You shouldn't use the microwave.

1445
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,490
Why? Will I get cancer?

1446
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:56,490
You chew tobacco all day..

1447
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:58,110
..and do cheap drugs..

1448
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,530
and microwave's cause cancer.

1449
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:00,360
Hippie.

1450
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,730
There was a time when 
you liked..this hippiness.

1451
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,110
But wasting your entire 
life on drugs isn't.

1452
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,440
I am very happy.

1453
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
Because of you, I found my path.

1454
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:12,020
My calling.

1455
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:15,230
When you got me 
pregnant and ran away..

1456
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,850
Okay, listen Ananya.

1457
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,810
20-years-ago we had..

1458
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,840
Sex..

1459
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,180
That's it.

1460
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:26,050
There is no other connection 
between you and me.

1461
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,920
And anyway, this is your fault.

1462
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:32,290
For 21-years you didn't 
tell me that I had a daughter.

1463
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,040
You could've called.

1464
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,700
I hate phone calls.

1465
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,870
Because that causes cancer, 
doesn't it?

1466
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,280
You must have sold 
your phone to buy drugs.

1467
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,820
You're trying to disturb my chakras.

1468
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,900
No, I am feeling dizzy.

1469
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:51,810
The sandwich is ready, move aside.

1470
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,350
Accept it, we have a child together.

1471
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,060
No, we do not have a child together.

1472
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,270
You had a child, 
And that child lives with me now.

1473
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,890
Pass me my sandwich.

1474
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:03,590
Excuse.

1475
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,260
Be better than this guy ya?

1476
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:14,920
Okay, great. 
I'll book a hotel for you guys.

1477
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,080
Time and space is just a concept.

1478
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,250
Then live on the streets.

1479
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,370
Okay, please.

1480
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,860
For a few days..

1481
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,860
..can we all just stay together..

1482
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,190
..like a family?

1483
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,980
- Goodnight, papa. 
- Goodnight.

1484
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:00,790
What now?

1485
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,160
That's my question, Jazz.

1486
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,480
What happened to us?

1487
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,690
What?

1488
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:15,480
When?

1489
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,690
Tia..

1490
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,470
Close your eyes 
and feel this moment..

1491
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,010
..and atone for your sins.

1492
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,170
Imagine..

1493
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,170
..sometime ago we were 
together in Amsterdam.

1494
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,450
One body, two souls.

1495
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:48,320
We're prisoners of time, Jazz.

1496
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,360
Youth is a lie.

1497
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,070
You know..

1498
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:58,060
..according to the 
calendar of rebirth..

1499
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:00,310
..I've turned 2370 years old.

1500
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:09,970
Let's reminisce our old memories 
and let our energies meet.

1501
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:12,720
Let's do it.

1502
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,630
What?

1503
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:17,500
Sex.

1504
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:19,580
No, no, no, Ananya, no.

1505
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:21,710
Tia needs a brother.

1506
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:23,330
- No, no. 
- All the stars have aligned.

1507
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,040
No..

1508
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,910
All the stars have aligned.

1509
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,740
Tia..

1510
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,940
Rhea?

1511
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:38,610
She is not on work today.

1512
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:50,470
Where are you? 
We need to talk.

1513
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:51,300
Go on.

1514
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,760
Where are you?

1515
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,760
At Jack's Cafe.

1516
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,080
[Indistinct chatter]

1517
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,410
- You won't believe what happened. 
- Hi, Jazz.

1518
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,320
Hi..

1519
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,400
Are you guys on a date?

1520
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:15,570
- No. 
- Yeah.

1521
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:17,070
- Yeah? 
- No?

1522
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,190
Decide first.

1523
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,270
Let's talk later.

1524
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,060
Will you tell me what happened?

1525
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,640
You didn't tell me either.

1526
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:29,970
Is he your boyfriend?

1527
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,050
If you go on dates 
with such flat faces..

1528
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,800
..you're bound to 
lose faith in love.

1529
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,050
What do you mean?

1530
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,130
Nothing, I was just..

1531
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:47,500
Jazz.

1532
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,240
Jazz, stop.

1533
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,620
- Why are you behaving like this? 
- Listen, I am sorry, okay.

1534
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,200
Go back inside and hold his hand.

1535
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,740
We'll discuss my problem later.

1536
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,940
Jazz, don't act like you're 
my boyfriend and I cheated on you.

1537
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,900
But it seems like one.

1538
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:02,440
That guy is normal.

1539
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,350
He wants to talk to me.

1540
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,600
He didn't attack me as you did.

1541
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,180
Come on, Jazz, I am not 
like those girls in the club.

1542
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,260
Do you even know what I want?

1543
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:13,970
I want old-school love.

1544
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:17,170
That has the maturity, affection..

1545
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,840
..and not just lust.

1546
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,250
Let me know if you want to talk.

1547
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:24,000
I want a friend, not drama.

1548
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:27,460
Breathe out.

1549
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,430
And push, Tia.

1550
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,100
Push.

1551
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,850
Breathe out and push.

1552
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,600
Push.

1553
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,010
Breathe out and push.

1554
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:36,220
Push.

1555
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,550
Breathe out and push.

1556
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,420
Push.

1557
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:40,670
I will shit in my pants.

1558
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,960
You don't have to push. You just 
have to support Tia, spiritually.

1559
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:44,880
Excuse me.

1560
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:46,580
What's going on?

1561
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:48,040
Practising for delivery.

1562
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:48,870
What for?

1563
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,540
So she has a natural delivery.

1564
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:53,990
To save ourselves from 
the fraud hospitals and doctors.

1565
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,120
We'll do it at home.

1566
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:56,240
In the bathtub.

1567
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,360
In the bathtub?

1568
01:33:57,450 --> 01:33:58,490
That's what she's saying.

1569
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:02,320
Come on, baby.

1570
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,110
We've to go back to breathe out..

1571
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:05,730
- Come on, breathe. Push. 
- Come on, come on.

1572
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,270
Breathe..push..

1573
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:09,390
- Breathe..push.. 
- Breathe out..

1574
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,100
Okay, everybody listen.

1575
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:11,890
Lie down..

1576
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:13,720
Breathe..push..

1577
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:14,640
Listen..

1578
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,840
Everyone listen!

1579
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:21,550
First I suddenly find out 
that I have a pregnant daughter.

1580
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:23,710
Later her mother 
arrives and so do you.

1581
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:26,170
My home, 
kitchen, bathroom, my life..

1582
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,290
..you guys took over 
everything but I said nothing.

1583
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,540
But my grandchild's delivery 
will happen in a clean hospital..

1584
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,830
..under the observation of a doctor.

1585
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:35,290
And not in the bathroom.

1586
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:39,950
And you two won't talk like a bunch of 
drug addicts in front of my daughter.

1587
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,450
Understood!

1588
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:55,310
He needs meditation!

1589
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:57,050
She needs help.

1590
01:34:58,350 --> 01:34:59,260
Wow..

1591
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:03,510
Dimpy, how does it look?

1592
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,050
Looks huge.

1593
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:09,290
As I said, after this deal you guys 
will be the biggest brokers in London.

1594
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:11,210
Quite marvellous, isn't it?

1595
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,290
Now ask why I brought this here?

1596
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,500
Come on, ask.

1597
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:16,700
Well..if we build homes, 
it needs to be sold.

1598
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:18,280
And who is going to sell them?

1599
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:19,660
Singh Brothers.

1600
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,610
I am telling you, you guys 
are going to make a lot of money.

1601
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,570
A lot of money.

1602
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,860
No looking back.

1603
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,780
God bless.

1604
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,070
Where is the tree?

1605
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:30,100
What tree?

1606
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
This is a money tree.

1607
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,140
Guys, get ready to start selling..

1608
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:39,140
..the most expensive 
pent house in London.

1609
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:45,260
Dimpy, tell your staff that 
whoever sells the most homes.

1610
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,090
I'll raise the stake.

1611
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:50,210
Whoever sells the most 
number of penthouses in a month..

1612
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:53,170
Yeah, not in a week, but a month..

1613
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:54,620
I'll give you the ground floor.

1614
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,950
Tia, wait.

1615
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,950
At least listen to me.

1616
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,740
You're cheating Mrs. Malika.

1617
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,070
They are giving her a lot of money..

1618
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:07,070
..and pretty soon she 
will forget her tree.

1619
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:09,110
This is worth millions.

1620
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,770
Emotions often ruin deals.

1621
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,600
I promised her.

1622
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:16,230
You used me.

1623
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:17,640
Please don't overreact.

1624
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,390
Life teaches you to adjust.

1625
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,100
She will too.

1626
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,640
Then why didn't you?

1627
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:26,130
Why can't you accept 
the concept of time and age?

1628
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,880
Your word is your responsibility.

1629
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,960
But what do you know 
about responsibility?

1630
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:34,670
You've never cared for anyone 
in your life, except for yourself.

1631
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,290
Okay, I've had enough 
of your free advice.

1632
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,620
I am great the way I am.

1633
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:42,990
People often mistake their 
guilt for their responsibility.

1634
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:44,610
Like I feel for you.

1635
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,690
I don't want anyone in my life.

1636
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:49,150
You came here looking for me.

1637
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,900
And now that you're 
a part of my life..

1638
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:52,810
..you'll have to live by my rules.

1639
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,230
I came here looking for my dad..

1640
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,850
..but found a topmost 
broker instead.

1641
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:35,110
What's going on?

1642
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,940
We're going to Amsterdam.

1643
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:39,810
And Tia.

1644
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:41,930
She's coming too.

1645
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,370
Tia..

1646
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,200
My intentions weren't to hurt you.

1647
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:04,070
I want to buy a home 
for us with this deal.

1648
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:05,570
I am doing this for us.

1649
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:08,940
Why are you leaving, Tia?

1650
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,980
We'll meet..on birthdays.

1651
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,270
There's always phone and texting.

1652
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:15,470
We'll stay in touch.

1653
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,680
Tia. Tia.

1654
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:20,390
Hurry up, we're getting late.

1655
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:22,800
Hello, sir.

1656
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,260
What time is the train?

1657
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,630
The train leaves 
at 11 o'clock tomorrow.

1658
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,090
But we're getting late right now.

1659
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,000
Are you ready?

1660
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:33,910
Thank you, sir.

1661
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,900
Your house keys.

1662
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:50,690
Thank you.

1663
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,990
"How could you be so cruel, Lord..."

1664
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:29,900
"Born to someone and taken 
away by another, we are."

1665
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:33,770
"How could you be so cruel, Lord..."

1666
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:41,890
"Born to someone and taken 
away by another, we are."

1667
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:48,260
"I feel as if the 
world is upset with me."

1668
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,340
"I am the apple of your eye."

1669
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,710
"Tears won't stop, I wonder why."

1670
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:57,750
"Why turn back?"

1671
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:00,950
"Heartbroken everyone is."

1672
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:04,110
"I see everyone weep."

1673
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,940
"I won't be coming back."

1674
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:13,810
"Oh my dearest father,"

1675
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,980
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1676
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:20,220
"Oh my dearest father."

1677
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:23,390
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1678
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:26,630
"Oh my dearest father, 
Look at me."

1679
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,670
"I am leaving you forever."

1680
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,920
"Oh my dearest father."

1681
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:37,040
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1682
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:49,680
Excuse me.

1683
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:52,130
Mr. Rajendra Sharma please.

1684
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,130
Room no.204 sir. 
This way please.

1685
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,860
Jazz.

1686
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,360
Come in.

1687
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:20,310
What happened?

1688
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:21,810
Nothing.

1689
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:26,020
My youth can't tolerate my ageing.

1690
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,350
Doctors are stupid.

1691
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,890
They are saying 
change your lifestyle.

1692
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:36,380
I said come to my club, 
I'll change your lifestyle.

1693
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,460
Don't you have any family?

1694
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,210
Flying solo..

1695
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,250
Remember!

1696
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:48,870
I'll stay with you tonight.

1697
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,870
No, bro.

1698
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,870
You go and enjoy.

1699
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:54,200
I will rest here. It's okay.

1700
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,150
Don't tell anyone I am here.

1701
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:00,150
I told everyone that I am 
in Ibiza for the music festival.

1702
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:04,100
Okay.

1703
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:11,760
"My tears are drying out."

1704
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:18,010
"My feet won't stop."

1705
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:21,380
"My tears are drying out."

1706
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:24,460
"My feet won't stop."

1707
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:27,710
"My wishes won't oblige me."

1708
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:31,700
"My fate is testing me."

1709
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:40,480
"I feel as if the 
world is upset with me."

1710
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:43,440
"I am the apple of your eye."

1711
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:46,890
"Tears won't stop, I wonder why."

1712
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:50,100
"Why turn back?"

1713
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:53,300
"Heartbroken everyone is."

1714
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:56,220
"I see everyone weep."

1715
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:59,170
"I won't be coming back."

1716
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,000
"Oh my dearest father,"

1717
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:09,160
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1718
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:12,370
"Oh my dearest father,"

1719
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:15,570
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1720
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:18,820
"Oh my dearest father," 
"Look at me."

1721
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:22,030
"I am leaving you forever."

1722
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:25,270
"Oh my dearest father,"

1723
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,520
"Your baby girl is leaving."

1724
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:05,570
"It feels as if the 
whole house left with you."

1725
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:11,350
"Beautiful seasons, 
weather and cherished memories too."

1726
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:16,470
"It feels as if the 
whole house left with you."

1727
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:19,550
"Beautiful seasons, 
weather and cherished memories too."

1728
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,840
"There is no movement, no sound."

1729
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,500
"This house without 
you is like a raw wound."

1730
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:35,580
"I feel as if the 
world is upset with me."

1731
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:38,620
"I am the apple of your eye."

1732
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:41,990
"Tears won't stop, I wonder why."

1733
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:45,070
"Why turn back?"

1734
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:48,310
"Heartbroken everyone is."

1735
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:51,310
"I see everyone weep."

1736
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:53,800
Grover.

1737
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:58,420
You won't cut Mrs. Malika's tree.

1738
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:59,630
What?

1739
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,540
You're joking right.

1740
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,250
Do you know what this means?

1741
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,200
The deal will get cancelled.

1742
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:09,660
I don't care.

1743
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:12,410
What nonsense is this?

1744
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,200
The cheque is ready.

1745
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,690
Don't you want to get paid?

1746
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,940
Dimpy, talk some 
sense in your brother.

1747
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,570
Otherwise, he'll be a jack 
of all for the rest of his life.

1748
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:22,110
But never become a businessman.

1749
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:25,770
If you love plants and 
trees then go work in a nursery.

1750
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:27,060
Why do you claim to be a broker?

1751
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:29,140
Won't cut the tree.

1752
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:31,970
He said you won't cut the tree..

1753
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:33,970
..then that's it.

1754
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:43,290
"I feel all alone."

1755
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:46,420
"My baby girl is leaving."

1756
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,660
"I feel all alone."

1757
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,740
"My baby girl is leaving."

1758
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:55,990
"I feel all alone."

1759
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:59,240
"My heart is leaving me."

1760
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:02,400
"I feel all alone."

1761
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,770
"My baby girl is leaving."

1762
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:23,000
"How could you be so cruel, Lord..."

1763
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:29,910
"Born to someone and taken 
away by another, they are."

1764
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:50,600
Tia.

1765
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,300
I will fix everything.

1766
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,640
Go away.

1767
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:00,340
Keep your energy away 
from Tia and her child.

1768
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,470
Please.

1769
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,300
I don't care about this deal.

1770
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:08,370
I am only worried 
about you and your child.

1771
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:11,080
He is lying again 
like he did 20-years-ago.

1772
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:16,660
I didn't see you grow up..

1773
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:20,990
..but I want to see your child grow.

1774
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:24,110
I want to take him to school..

1775
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:28,270
I have only lived for myself..

1776
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:30,930
..but now I want to live for you.

1777
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:34,930
Please give me this chance, 
stay with me.

1778
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,010
I am fine with everything.

1779
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,760
Even him.

1780
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:42,220
I need you.

1781
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:44,750
And I can't live without you.

1782
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:52,080
I never fell in love.

1783
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,950
You're my first love.

1784
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:58,780
I love you.

1785
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,410
Don't go.

1786
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,070
Please.

1787
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,320
Tia.

1788
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,810
Tia, say something.

1789
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,020
Papa, my water broke.

1790
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,970
Oh my, God. 
Call the Police!

1791
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,760
I meant an ambulance.

1792
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:29,790
I love you.

1793
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,660
It's a girl.

1794
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,370
She's seven pounds.

1795
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,070
No, I am scared.

1796
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,530
It will be okay.

1797
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,680
She is beautiful.

1798
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:40,260
Like you.

1799
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:42,710
I think she looks just like you.

1800
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,810
Rocky.

1801
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,390
Grandpa, you took your 
time to open the door.

1802
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:16,260
I brought a gift for you.

1803
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,210
Hi..

1804
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,170
Tia invited me.

1805
01:50:29,210 --> 01:50:31,080
- And that flat face? 
- He was never in the picture.

1806
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,620
Okay..

1807
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:37,910
- Okay-okay.. 
- Easy, Jazz.. take it slow!

1808
01:50:42,030 --> 01:50:45,320
Tia, never leave 
me alone with Kiara.

1809
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,190
Why?

1810
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,940
Because if she does 
anything cute I'll faint.

1811
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,260
I'll check on her.

1812
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:07,920
Okay.. Okay..

1813
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,710
